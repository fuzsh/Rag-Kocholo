It is about the size of Ireland. It is about 28 kilometres (18 mi.) off the south-eastern coast of India with a population of about 22 million. Density is highest in the south west where Colombo, the country's main port and industrial center, is located. The net population growth is about 0.7%. Sri Lanka is ethnically, linguistically, and religiously diverse.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation of Sri LankaYearPop.±% 1827[a] 889,584— 1871 2,400,380+169.8% 1881 2,759,738+15.0% 1891 3,007,789+9.0% 1901 3,565,954+18.6% 1911 4,106,350+15.2% 1921 4,498,605+9.6% 1931 5,306,871+18.0% 1946 6,657,339+25.4% 1953 8,097,895+21.6% 1963 10,582,064+30.7% 1971 12,689,897+19.9% 1981 14,846,750+17.0% 1990 17,325,773+16.7% 2000 18,777,601+8.4% 2010 20,261,737+7.9% 2020 21,413,249+5.7%Source: [3][4][5][6][7]\n\nAccording to the 2012 census the population of Sri Lanka was 20,359,439, giving a population density of 325/km2.[7] The population had grown by 5,512,689 (37.1%) since the 1981 census (the last full census), equivalent to an annual growth rate of 1.1%.[7] 3,704,470 (18.2%) lived in urban sectors - areas governed by municipal and urban councils.[8]\n\n5,131,666 (25.2%) of the population were aged 14 or under whilst 2,525,573 (12.4%) were aged 60 or over, leaving a working age (15-59) population of 12,702,700.[9] The dependency ratio was 60.2%.[7] The mean age was 32 years and the median age was 31 years.[7] The sex ratio was 94 males per 100 females.[7] The fertility rate for married females aged 15 or over was 2.65 live births.[10] There were 5,264,282 households, of which 3,986,236 (75.7%) were headed by males and 1,278,046 (24.3%) were headed by females.[7]\n\nOf the 15,227,773 aged 15 or over, 10,322,105 (67.8%) were married, 3,927,602 (25.8%) were never married, 792,947 (5.2%) were widowed and 185,119 (1.2%) were divorced or separated.[11]\n\nOf those aged 15 or over, 7,857,370 (51.6%) were economically active, 4,199,558 (27.6%) did housework, 1,431,105 (9.4%) were students, 914,934 (6.0%) were unable to work and 346,084 (2.3%) were pensioners.[12] 521,938 (6.6%) of the economically active were unemployed.[7] 604,540 Sri Lankans were living aboard for more than six months but were intending to return to Sri Lanka, mostly in the Gulf states (373,050 61.7%).[13]\n\nThe overall literacy rate for those aged 10 and over was 95.7% but amongst those living in the estate sector it was only 86.1%.[14] Of the 18,615,577 aged 5 or over, 499,563 (2.7%) had received a higher education qualification, 2,293,841 (12.3%) had passed G.C.E. A/L, 3,159,402 (17.0%) had passed G.C.E. O/L and 700,419 (3.8%) had no formal schooling.[15] The remaining 11,962,352 (64.3%) had left school with no qualifications or were currently at school.[15]\n\nSri Lanka's population is aging faster than any other nation in South Asia and has the fifth highest rapidly growing population of older people in Asia after China, Thailand, South Korea and Japan.[16][17][18] In 2015, Sri Lanka's population aged over 60 was 13.9%, by 2030 this will increase to 21% and by 2050 this number will reach 27.4%.[17][18] Sri Lanka's rapidly growing older population has ignited concerns of the socio-economic challenges that the country will face because of this.[19]\n\nEthnicity\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sinhalese make up 74.9% of the population (according to 2012 census) and are concentrated in the densely populated south-west and central parts of the island.[20]\n\nThe Sri Lanka Tamils, who live predominantly in the north and east of the island, form the largest minority group at 11.1% (according to the 2012 census) of the population.[20]\n\nThe Moors, descendants of Arab + Indian traders and native Sri Lankan Tamils, form the third largest ethnic group at 9.3% of the population.[20] These Tamil-speaking Muslims are mostly concentrated in urban areas in the southern parts of the island with substantial populations in the Central and Eastern provinces. During times of Portuguese colonization, Moors were persecuted, and many forced to retreat to the central highlands and the eastern coast.[citation needed]\n\nThere are also Indian Tamils who form a distinct ethnic group comprising 4.1% of the population.[20] The British brought them to Sri Lanka in the 19th century as tea and rubber plantation workers, and they remain concentrated in the \"tea country\" of south-central Sri Lanka. The Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka were considered to be \"stateless\" and over 300,000 Indian Tamils were deported back to India, due to the agreement between Sri Lanka and India in 1964.[21] Under the pact, India granted citizenship to the remainder, some 200,000 of whom now live in India. Another 75,000 Indian Tamils, who themselves or whose parents once applied for Indian citizenship, now wish to remain in Sri Lanka. The government has stated these Tamils will not be forced to return to India, although they are not technically citizens of Sri Lanka. By the 1990s most Indian Tamils had received Sri Lankan citizenship, and some even were not granted Sri Lankan citizenship until 2003.[21][22]\n\nSmaller minorities include the Veddas, the indigenous people of Sri Lanka; Malays who descend from Austronesian settlers; the Burghers, who are descendants of European colonists, principally from Portugal, the Netherlands and, the UK; the ethnic Chinese migrants who came to the island in the 18th and 19th centuries; and the Kaffirs, a small population who are descended from Africans.\n\nPopulation of Sri Lanka by ethnic group 1881 to 2012[20][23][24] Year Sinhalese Sri Lankan Tamils[b] Sri Lankan Moors[c] Indian Tamils[b] Sri Lankan Malays Burghers/\n\nEurasian Indian Moors[c] Others Total\n\nNo. No. % No. % No. % No. % No. % No. % No. % No. % 1881 Census 1,846,600\n\n66.91%\n\n687,200\n\n24.90%\n\n184,500\n\n6.69%\n\n8,900\n\n0.32%\n\n17,900\n\n0.65%\n\n14,500\n\n0.53%\n\n2,759,700 1891 Census 2,041,200\n\n67.86%\n\n723,900\n\n24.07%\n\n197,200\n\n6.56%\n\n10,100\n\n0.34%\n\n21,200\n\n0.70%\n\n14,200\n\n0.47%\n\n3,007,800 1901 Census 2,330,800\n\n65.36%\n\n951,700\n\n26.69%\n\n228,000\n\n6.39%\n\n11,900\n\n0.33%\n\n23,500\n\n0.66%\n\n20,000\n\n0.56%\n\n3,566,000 1911 Census 2,715,500\n\n66.13%\n\n528,000\n\n12.86%\n\n233,900\n\n5.70%\n\n531,000\n\n12.93%\n\n13,000\n\n0.32%\n\n26,700\n\n0.65%\n\n32,700\n\n0.80%\n\n25,600\n\n0.62%\n\n4,106,400 1921 Census 3,016,200\n\n67.05%\n\n517,300\n\n11.50%\n\n251,900\n\n5.60%\n\n602,700\n\n13.40%\n\n13,400\n\n0.30%\n\n29,400\n\n0.65%\n\n33,000\n\n0.73%\n\n34,600\n\n0.77%\n\n4,498,600 1931 Estimate 3,473,000\n\n65.45%\n\n598,900\n\n11.29%\n\n289,600\n\n5.46%\n\n818,500\n\n15.43%\n\n16,000\n\n0.30%\n\n32,300\n\n0.61%\n\n36,300\n\n0.68%\n\n41,800\n\n0.79%\n\n5,306,000 1946 Census[d] 4,620,500\n\n69.41%\n\n733,700\n\n11.02%\n\n373,600\n\n5.61%\n\n780,600\n\n11.73%\n\n22,500\n\n0.34%\n\n41,900\n\n0.63%\n\n35,600\n\n0.53%\n\n48,900\n\n0.73%\n\n6,657,300 1953 Census[e] 5,616,700\n\n69.36%\n\n884,700\n\n10.93%\n\n464,000\n\n5.73%\n\n974,100\n\n12.03%\n\n25,400\n\n0.31%\n\n46,000\n\n0.57%\n\n47,500\n\n0.59%\n\n39,500\n\n0.49%\n\n8,097,900 1963 Census 7,512,900\n\n71.00%\n\n1,164,700\n\n11.01%\n\n626,800\n\n5.92%\n\n1,123,000\n\n10.61%\n\n33,400\n\n0.32%\n\n45,900\n\n0.43%\n\n55,400\n\n0.52%\n\n19,900\n\n0.19%\n\n10,582,000 1971 Census 9,131,241\n\n71.96%\n\n1,423,981\n\n11.22%\n\n855,724\n\n6.74%\n\n1,174,606\n\n9.26%\n\n43,459\n\n0.34%\n\n45,376\n\n0.36%\n\n15,510\n\n0.12%\n\n12,689,897 1981 Census 10,979,561\n\n73.95%\n\n1,886,872\n\n12.71%\n\n1,046,926\n\n7.05%\n\n818,656\n\n5.51%\n\n46,963\n\n0.32%\n\n39,374\n\n0.27%\n\n28,398\n\n0.19%\n\n14,846,750 2001 Census[f] 2011 Census[g] 15,250,081\n\n74.90%\n\n2,269,266\n\n11.15%\n\n1,892,638\n\n9.30%\n\n839,504\n\n4.12%\n\n44,130\n\n0.22%\n\n38,293\n\n0.19%\n\n25,527\n\n0.13%\n\n20,359,439\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Religion in Sri Lanka\n\nAccording to the 2012 census Buddhists make up 70.2% of the population, Hindus 12.6%, Muslims 9.7% and Christians 7.6%.[26] Most Sinhalese are Buddhist; most Tamils are Hindu; and the Moors and Malays are mostly Muslim. Sizeable minorities of both Sinhalese and Tamils are Christians, most of whom are Roman Catholic. The Burgher population is mostly Roman Catholic or Presbyterian. The Veddas have Animist and Buddhist practices. The 1978 constitution, while assuring freedom of religion, gives \"the foremost place\" to Buddhism.[27][28]\n\nPopulation of Sri Lanka by religion 1881 to 2012[26][29][30] Year Buddhist Hindu Muslim Christian Others Total No. % No. % No. % No. % No. % No. 1881 Census 1,698,100\n\n61.53%\n\n593,600\n\n21.51%\n\n197,800\n\n7.17%\n\n268,000\n\n9.71%\n\n2,300\n\n0.08%\n\n2,759,800 1891 Census 1,877,000\n\n62.40%\n\n615,900\n\n20.48%\n\n212,000\n\n7.05%\n\n302,100\n\n10.04%\n\n800\n\n0.03%\n\n3,007,800 1901 Census 2,141,400\n\n60.06%\n\n826,800\n\n23.19%\n\n246,100\n\n6.90%\n\n349,200\n\n9.79%\n\n2,500\n\n0.07%\n\n3,566,000 1911 Census 2,474,200\n\n60.25%\n\n938,300\n\n22.85%\n\n283,600\n\n6.91%\n\n409,200\n\n9.96%\n\n1,100\n\n0.03%\n\n4,106,400 1921 Census 2,769,800\n\n61.57%\n\n982,100\n\n21.83%\n\n302,500\n\n6.72%\n\n443,400\n\n9.86%\n\n800\n\n0.02%\n\n4,498,600 1931 Estimate 3,266,600\n\n61.55%\n\n1,166,900\n\n21.99%\n\n354,200\n\n6.67%\n\n518,100\n\n9.76%\n\n1,100\n\n0.02%\n\n5,306,900 1946 Census 4,294,900\n\n64.51%\n\n1,320,400\n\n19.83%\n\n436,600\n\n6.56%\n\n603,200\n\n9.06%\n\n2,200\n\n0.03%\n\n6,657,300 1953 Census 5,209,400\n\n64.33%\n\n1,610,500\n\n19.89%\n\n541,500\n\n6.69%\n\n724,400\n\n8.95%\n\n12,100\n\n0.15%\n\n8,097,900 1963 Census 7,003,300\n\n66.18%\n\n1,958,400\n\n18.51%\n\n724,000\n\n6.84%\n\n884,900\n\n8.36%\n\n11,400\n\n0.11%\n\n10,582,000 1971 Census 8,536,868\n\n67.27%\n\n2,238,666\n\n17.64%\n\n901,785\n\n7.11%\n\n1,004,326\n\n7.91%\n\n8,252\n\n0.07%\n\n12,689,897 1981 Census 10,288,325\n\n69.30%\n\n2,297,806\n\n15.48%\n\n1,121,717\n\n7.56%\n\n1,130,568\n\n7.61%\n\n8,334\n\n0.06%\n\n14,846,750 2001 Census[f] 2012 Census[g] 14,272,056\n\n70.10%\n\n2,561,299\n\n12.58%\n\n1,967,523\n\n9.66%\n\n1,552,161\n\n7.62%\n\n6,400\n\n0.03%\n\n20,359,439\n\nLanguages\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Languages of Sri Lanka\n\nSinhala, an Indo-Aryan language, is the first language of Sinhalese people.\n\nTamil, a Dravidian language, is the first language of native Sri Lankan Tamils. Tamil is also the first language of the majority of Sri Lankan Moors and the Indian Tamils - according to the 2012 census 98% of Sri Lankan Moors could speak Tamil but only 59% could speak Sinhala.[31]\n\nEnglish is fluently spoken by approximately 23.8%[32] of the Sri Lanka's population, and widely used for official and commercial purposes.\n\nMalays speak Sri Lanka Malay, a Creole language mixing Sinhala, Tamil and Malay. Many of the Burghers speak Sri Lankan Indo-Portuguese although its use has declined and the majority now speak Sinhala.[31] The Veddas speak Vedda, a Creole language closely based on Sinhala. Use of English has declined since independence, but it continues to be spoken by many in the middle and upper middle classes, particularly in Colombo. According to the 2012 census 24% of the population could speak English.[31] The government is seeking to reverse the decline in the use of English, mainly for economic but also for political reasons. According to the constitution Sinhala and Tamil are official languages whilst English is the link language.[33]\n\nVital statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nUN estimates:[34]\n\nPeriod Live births per year Deaths
