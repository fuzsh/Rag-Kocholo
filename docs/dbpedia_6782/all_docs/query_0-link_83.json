        "text": "The tables for “All of France” bring together data for metropolitan France and the four overseas départements (DOMs). These figures do not include Mayotte, which became the fifth DOM on 31 March 2011, or the overseas territories and collectivities (New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Saint Barthélémy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna). INSEE includes the DOMs in its annual demographic overview and in most of the tables in its detailed annual study of the demographic situation in France.\n\nTotal population\n\nProjections\n\nThe population of France by sex and age is estimated by INSEE each year. A provisional estimate is first issued and final figures are published at a later date. Censuses are conducted in certain years to enumerate the population. The population estimates are adjusted on the basis of census data, for the whole of France and for the different départements and regions.\n\nPopulation Pyramid\n\nPopulation by sex and age\n\nPopulation by age\n\nCentenarians\n\nPopulation by region\n\nMunicipalities\n\nThe population changes from one year to the next. Natural change is the difference between births and deaths, and can be determined precisely from vital records. Net migration is the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants. It is estimated on the basis of available statistics. Adjustments are sometimes made to establish overall consistency between census population figures and inter-census estimates of population change. To estimate its relative scale, population change is often expressed in relation to the mean population of a given year. Rates of birth, death, natural increase and total variation are obtained in this way.\n\nBirths, deaths, migrations\n\nFertility rates, mortality rates, natural increase\n\nRegistered births are recorded in statistical bulletins which provide a rich source of information. Births are counted on the basis of many different characteristics: parents’ marital status and nationality, sex of the child, twin births, etc. Information on the mother’s age is used to calculate annual fertility indicators, such as the total fertility rate expressed as a total number of children per woman. Completed cohort fertility is also calculated every year. For example, women born in 1970 were 34 years old in 2004. We know how many children they have had before age 34 and we can estimate how many children they will have during their reproductive life.\n\nTotal births by sex\n\nBirths outside marriage\n\nBirths by parents’ place of birth\n\nMultiple births\n\nChanges in fertility\n\nMean age at maternity\n\nCohort fertility\n\nFertility can be controlled by means of contraception and induced abortion. Information on contraceptive practice in France is obtained through surveys conducted regularly by INED since 1978 among the entire female population. The number of induced abortions is estimated on the basis of abortion notifications and hospital statistics. INED is responsible for publication of abortion statistics.\n\nAbortions\n\nContraception\n\nThe first task in a population census is to enumerate dwellings. Persons living in the same dwelling form a household, so each household comprises all the persons living in a single dwelling. According to the census definitions, a household may comprise one or more families. A family is a group of persons comprising a couple with no children, a couple with children, or one adult and his/her children.\n\nCouples\n\nHousehold size\n\nHousehold structure\n\nStructure of families with child(ren)\n\nNumber of child(ren) in the family\n\nChildren of families\n\nDeath registers provide a means to measure variations in mortality. Deaths by sex and age are used to construct life tables which give life expectancy at birth, i.e. the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life. The mortality of children under the age of one year is also specifically calculated. When a person dies, a doctor records the cause of death on a death certificate which is sent to INSERM where all causes of death are coded.\n\nLife expectancy\n\nLife expectancy by social class\n\nLife table\n\nTotal deaths by sex\n\nMortality rates by sex and age\n\nCauses of death\n\nInfant mortality\n\nTwo statistical series drawing on different sources are presented. INSEE uses annual census surveys that provide an overview of net migration and entries and departures of non-immigrants and immigrants (including undocumented foreigners). INED, meanwhile, counts the number of non-EU foreigners admitted who have obtained an initial residence permit of at least one year (AGDREF file, French Interior Ministry).\n\nMigration flows of immigrants\n\nMigration flows of non-immigrants\n\nCharacteristics of immigration flows\n\nResidence permits by continent of origin\n\nResidence permits by nationality\n\nResidence permits by reasons for admission\n\nPopulation censuses provide an opportunity to count the number of inhabitants who were born outside France. Among foreign-born inhabitants, a distinction is generally made between persons born with French nationality and immigrants, who are born with a different nationality. Inhabitants are distinguished by their nationality, i.e. French or foreign and, among French citizens, those who were born French and those who have been naturalized. The census provides information on current nationality and nationality at birth. Foreigners and immigrants form two different categories. Immigrants \"born abroad as a foreign national\" may still be foreigners at the time of the census or may have become French. Foreigners, for their part, may have been born abroad (in which case they are immigrants) or in France (in which case they are not immigrants).\n\nImmigrant and foreign population\n\nImmigrants by country of birth\n\nDescendants of immigrants by country of origin\n\nDescendants of immigrants by age and country of origin"
