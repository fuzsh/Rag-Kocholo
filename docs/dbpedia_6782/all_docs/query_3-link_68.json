The ArcFuel extension of ArcGIS 10.4 was used to derive landscape file using three geographic raster layers (elevation, slope, aspect) and five forest characteristics raster layers. Findings from this research suggested that the forest fire hazards in the dry zone of Sri Lanka could significantly increase for the near future under projected climate change conditions. Most interestingly, fire damage under the future projected climate change scenario in the Mulaitive district has significantly increased. Out of the total forest fire damages, about 53% was reported in Monaragala districts under climate change conditions and this would be about 50% in baseline level in Badulla districts. Based on the fire damages, number of fires, and fire damage per fire occurrence, 25 districts in Sri Lanka were classified into risk, moderate and low risk areas. Fire simulation output results of burn probability, damage areas and fire intensity level provide evidence that under the projected climate condition fire severity, fire intensity is significantly increased in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, especially in the Monaragala, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Badulla districts. Moreover, forest types like dry monsoon forest, shrublands, open and spare forest, and savannah forest have higher forest fire vulnerability and hazardous levels under the climate change."
