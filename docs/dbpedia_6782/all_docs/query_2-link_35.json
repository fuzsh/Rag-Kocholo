        "text": "South Asia region program 2021–22\n\nPartner country\n\nNo. projects\n\nBangladesh\n\n11\n\nIndia\n\n7\n\nNepal\n\n5\n\nPakistan\n\n13\n\nSri Lanka\n\n2\n\nNote that a project may be conducted in several countries,\n\ntherefore the total number of projects in this table will be\n\ngreater than the number of projects in the region.\n\nSouth Asia is an immensely diverse and densely populated region. It is home to 1.5 billion people – one-quarter of the world’s population. South Asia has the highest concentration of poor people in the world, with more than 500 million people living in extreme poverty.\n\nDespite the population pressure, the region has shown impressive annual economic growth at an average of 6.7%. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is projected to significantly and negatively impact on the economic growth of the region, pushing another 71 million people into extreme poverty. Many more people, particularly women, live marginally above the poverty line but do not have the opportunity to participate in the process of economic growth.\n\nCompared with other regions in the world, South Asia has the highest regional Global Hunger Index and a very low Human Development Index. Half of the population depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Although the share of agriculture in rural employment remains high, growth of the rural non-farm sector is accelerating and now provides a sizeable share of rural income and employment, primarily in services.\n\nMalnutrition is prevalent in South Asia. The region has among the highest burdens of child undernutrition in the world. Thirty-six per cent of children under age 5 are stunted, or too short for their age, which is an indicator of chronic undernutrition. Sixteen per cent are wasted, or too thin for their height, which is an indicator of acute malnutrition. South Asia also has a high prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies, overconsumption and diet-related non-communicable disease.\n\nWhile the countries of South Asia face common challenges and opportunities in agriculture, there are also fundamental differences between and within these countries, in terms of the broad characteristics that influence the nature and success of agriculture. India has 15 distinct agroecological zones. Nepal has 3 distinct topographical zones. The northern hilly region of Bangladesh is geographically distinct from the southern coastal areas, mostly alluvial, with fertile floodplains associated with 3 major rivers. Pakistan’s Indus plains are in sharp contrast to the arid regions of Sindh and the hilly and semi-arid areas of the north-west. Sri Lanka’s landscape is clearly defined by its dry and wet zones. These regional variations throughout South Asia must be considered when designing a meaningful program for research collaboration to accommodate regional distinctions and varying degrees of vulnerability of the local population.\n\nAccording to the International Food Policy Research Institute’s 2021 global food policy report: transforming food systems after COVID-19, South Asia faces continuing and, in some cases, intensifying problems related to climate change, natural disasters, poor food safety and distortionary policies. Fall armyworm devastated Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of India and Nepal in 2020. Bangladesh and India struggled with flooding during the pandemic and, in India, bird flu caused a nationwide food-safety scare. Distortionary policies, and the increasing costs of implementing them, remain, despite overwhelming evidence of their negative impacts and the potential to repurpose these much-needed resources for climate-smart investments or to build robust food-safety institutions. A perplexing reality remains the relatively low volume of agricultural trade among the countries of South Asia.\n\nGiven the high population densities and large numbers of vulnerable people, the COVID-19 pandemic has been an especially huge challenge for South Asia. Agriculture is highly dependent on informal labour, which has been severely limited during lockdowns and restricted by social distancing measures. These are all disruptive factors for supply chains and agriculture markets.\n\nPartner countries in the South Asia region\n\nDrivers of regional collaboration\n\nCountries in South Asia share many opportunities and threats that drive the need for regional cooperation, especially in the Eastern Gangetic Plains. Rice and wheat are the region’s major staple crops, accounting for about two-thirds of total dietary energy. However, food consumption patterns have changed in the region over the past few decades, and the changes are most apparent in rural areas. Consumption of cereals is declining while consumption of animal-sourced foods, fruits, vegetables and processed foods is increasing. Pressure to expand food production to meet growing demand is putting stress on natural resources. The resulting expansion and intensification of agriculture is leading to land degradation, deterioration of soil quality and loss of biodiversity, potentially jeopardising the region’s capacity to meet future food demand.\n\nAgricultural growth also poses risks for water resources. Facing the world’s lowest per capita renewable freshwater resources, millions of rural people in South Asia have benefited from the growing use of groundwater. But aquifers are being depleted and, across the region, watertables are falling, particularly in India. Water quality is also deteriorating throughout the region due to nutrient overloads and industrial pollution, raising concerns about food safety and drinking water quality.\n\nLarge areas in several countries of South Asia are prone to natural disasters. Bangladesh and coastal parts of India are threatened frequently by cyclones and floods. Recurring droughts are a common feature in the arid and semi-arid parts of India and Pakistan. The impact of natural calamities is most severe on food-insecure households.\n\nClimate variability, competing and increasing demands from agriculture and industry (including energy production) and population growth are creating severe demands on water availability. Regional cooperation is increasingly essential to manage these shared resources and address shared issues. There are also significant opportunities in regional cooperation to improve the productivity and diversification of agricultural crops, especially beyond cereals, and to improve the sustainability of farming systems through technical, institutional, value-chain and policy research and development.\n\nACIAR South Asia region program\n\nAustralian agricultural and resource management expertise is highly regarded in the South Asia region. ACIAR has a long history of research collaboration in improving crop productivity, forestry, water use efficiency and policy reforms. The South Asia regional program of the Australian Government seeks to underpin Australia’s economic engagement in the region by addressing some of the key regionwide barriers to sustainable economic growth and connectivity through the Sustainable Development Investment Portfolio (SDIP) and South Asia Regional Trade Facilitation Program. Gender equality is a focus in all the investments under the regional program.\n\nOur strategy in South Asia focuses on communities, production systems and resource management in the 3 main ecosystems of the region – highlands, plains and coastal areas – that are common to Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka.\n\nResearch in these areas looks to identify appropriate reform policy, increase adoption of technology (including post-harvest management), improve productivity and livelihoods in marginalised communities, and improve the productivity of crop, livestock, forestry and fisheries systems.\n\nThe major pathways of development in the region are modernisation of agrifood systems, technology support, strengthening service providers, developing rural non-farm sector, and local governance at district and state level. Overproduction in some areas and unequal distribution networks due to poorly developed supply-chain management are the major issues in India. Addressing these could play a major role in achieving food and nutrition security and stability in the region.\n\nThe medium-term to long-term strategy in the region focuses on creating regional collaborations that:\n\nsustainably intensify and diversify cropping systems using conservation agriculture/zero tillage, farm mechanisation, saline land management and adaptation to climate change\n\neradicate extreme poverty through improved productivity of food-grain crops (especially wheat and pulses), livestock (in Pakistan), agroforestry (in Nepal) and fisheries (in Sri Lanka)\n\nbetter manage agricultural water, including rainfed areas in the Eastern Gangetic Plains and coastal zone\n\ninfluence policy about agricultural and farmers’ livelihoods and climate change\n\nincrease the emphasis on meaningful gender inclusion and empowerment.\n\nCurrent and proposed projects in the South Asia region, 2021–22"
