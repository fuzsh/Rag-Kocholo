        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nThe first Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century B.C., probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced circa 250 B.C., and the first kingdoms developed at the cities of Anuradhapura (from circa 200 B.C. to circa A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In the 14th century, a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom in northern Sri Lanka. The Portuguese controlled the coastal areas of the island in the 16th century followed by the Dutch in the 17th century. The island was ceded to the British in 1796, became a crown colony in 1802, and was formally united under British rule by 1815. As Ceylon, it became independent in 1948; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972. Prevailing tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in July 1983. Fighting between the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) continued for over a quarter century. Although Norway brokered peace negotiations that led to a cease-fire in 2002, the fighting slowly resumed and was again in full force by 2006. The government defeated the LTTE in May 2009.\n\nDuring the post-conflict years under President Mahinda RAJAPAKSA, the government initiated infrastructure development projects, many of which were financed by loans from China. His regime faced significant allegations of human rights violations and a shrinking democratic space for civil society.Â In 2015, a new coalition government headed by President Maithripala SIRISENA of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Prime Minister Ranil WICKREMESINGHE of the United National Party came to power with pledges to advance economic, governance, anti-corruption, reconciliation, justice, and accountability reforms. However, implementation of these reforms has been uneven. In October 2018, President SIRISENA attempted to oust Prime Minister WICKREMESINGHE, swearing in former President RAJAPAKSA as the new prime minister and issuing an order to dissolve the Parliament and hold elections. This sparked a seven-week constitutional crisis that ended when the Supreme Court ruled SIRISENAâs actions unconstitutional, RAJAPAKSA resigned, and WICKREMESINGHE was reinstated. In November 2019, Gotabaya RAJAPAKSA won the presidential election and appointed his brother, Mahinda, prime minister. Since Gotabaya RAJAPAKSAâs election, there have been concerns about his administrationâs commitment to pursuing justice, human rights, and accountability reforms, as well as the risks to foreign creditors that Sri Lanka faces given its ongoing economic crisis. A combination of factors including the impact of the worldwide COVID pandemic; severe shortages of food, medicine, and fuel; and power outages have triggered increasingly violent protests in Columbo. Longtime parliamentarian and former five-time prime minister, Ranil WICKREMESINGHE replaced Mahinda RAJAPASKA as prime-minister in mid-May 2022, with a mandate to resolve the country's economic problems.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern Asia, island in the Indian Ocean, south of India\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n7 00 N, 81 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAsia\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 65,610 sq km\n\nland: 64,630 sq km\n\nwater: 980 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 122\n\nArea -

Major infrastructure development of rural and civil war-impacted areas remains a major focus, as does small business development. Sri Lankaâs longstanding high debt and large civil service have contributed to historically high budget deficits and remain a concern. Sri Lankan tourism soared since the end of conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, but the 2018 constitutional crisis, the 2019 Easter bombings, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have since destabilized this key industry, leading Sri Lanka to nearly expend all foreign currency reserves. Regionally, Sri Lanka has engaged China on major infrastructure projects and currently owes $6.5 billion, which may soon be restructured.\n\nFiscally, Sri Lankaâs focus on domestic goodsâinstead of export growthâfurther increased Sri Lankaâs trade imbalance, despite its EU preferential trade status allowing tax-free garment and gem exports to the EU. From 2019 until its repeal in 2021, Sri Lankaâs agricultural import ban on chemical fertilizers resulted in disastrous reductions in rice, tea, and rubber yields, increasing Sri Lankaâs import dependencies for these goods. The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War has also decreased fuel supplies and significantly increased prices. India is providing both direct fertilizer and fuel aid to offset these shortages. Power shortages plague business climates, and further stoke existing labor shortages. Additionally Sri Lanka is also considering privatizing several state-owned entities to try to spur industrial and service sectorsâ growth.\n\nMonetarily, Sri Lanka remains in a dire position, further exacerbated by the 2019 tax cuts that contributed to the countryâs ongoing economic calamity. Already one of the highest indebted emerging markets, Sri Lanka defaulted on its current public debt payments in May 2022, and its ongoing currency crisis has crippled domestic revenues, tax collections, and economic activity, ushering in the countryâs worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. As a result, inflation is skyrocketing (nearing 40%), and food, fuel, and medicine shortages have led to widespread unrest and economic collapse. Sri Lanka currently seeks an immediate $3 million IMF bridge loan and $75 million in foreign currency to pay for essential goods and fuel.The World Bank, India, and the G7 countries have agreed to aid Sri Lanka in securing debt relief, but the IMF maintains that Sri Lanka must raise interest rates and taxes to secure any loan.\n\nCurrent Sri Lankan priorities focus on the following goals:\n\nSecuring a bridge loan from the IMF;\n\nImproving its foreign currency reserves through continued promotion of tourism and privatization of state enterprises;\n\nRecovering from COVID-19 pandemic-related economic disruptions and demand shocks;\n\nIdentifying alternative fuel supply chains; and\n\nRestructuring preexisting infrastructure debts to China.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$274.8 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$284.97 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$278.68 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 55\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n2.29% (2019 est.)\n\n3.32% (2018 est.)\n\n3.58% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 122\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$12,500 (2020 est.)\n\n$13,100 (2019 est.)\n\n$12,900 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 119\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$84.016 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n4.3% (2019 est.)\n\n4.2% (2018 est.)\n\n6.5% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 173\n\nCredit ratings\n\nFitch rating: CCC (2020)\n\nMoody's rating: Caa1 (2020)\n\nStandard & Poors rating: CCC+ (2020)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 7.8% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 30.5% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 61.7% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 62% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 8.5% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 26.3% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 10.2% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 21.9% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -29.1% (2017 est.)\n\nAgricultural products\n\nrice, coconuts, sugar cane, plantains, milk, tea, cassava, maize, poultry, coir\n\nIndustries\n\nprocessing of rubber, tea, coconuts, tobacco and other agricultural commodities;

while the country suffers from a relatively poor fixed-line infrastructure and a correspondingly strong mobile sector, demand for traditional phone services increased 14% in 2020; preliminary results suggest a further jump of up to 13% can also be expected in 2021; this will take Sri Lankaâs fixed-line penetration to levels not seen since 2013; the most reason behind the marketâs reversal of fortunes is the Covid-19 crisis and Sri Lankaâs ensuring lock downs; these forced much of the population back inside and reverting to âtraditionalâ methods of communication for both voice and data services; the fixed broadband market was equally robust, growing 20% in 2020 alone; Sri Lanka possesses a relatively low number of computers per household so the fixed broadband marketâs success comes off a small base; the one area of the telecommunications market that experienced a fall was the mobile segment; up until the start of the pandemic, Sri Lanka had a very high mobile penetration rate of 155%; this near-saturation level reflected the preponderance for subscribers to carry multiple SIM cards to take advantage of cheaper on-net call rates; the reduction in demand and traffic because of the pandemic led to a sharp drop in the number of active subscriptions, down to just 135% â a 17% decline in just one year; the market is expected to bounce back quickly, as soon as the country eases back on its lock down measures and reduces travel restrictions; it will also be boosted, come 2022, by the anticipated launch of commercial 5G mobile services (2021)\n\ndomestic: fixed-line roughly 11 per 100 and mobile-cellular nearly 139 per 100; national trunk network consists of digital microwave radio relay and fiber-optic links; fixed wireless local loops have been installed; competition is strong in mobile cellular systems and mobile cellular subscribership is increasing (2020)\n\ninternational: country code - 94; landing points for the SeaMeWe -3,-5,Â Â Dhiraagu-SLT Submarine Cable Network, WARF SubmarineÂ Cable, Bharat Lanka Cable SystemÂ and the Bay of Bengal Gateway submarine cables providing connectivity to Asia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and Europe; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) (2019)\n\nnote: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services\n\nBroadcast media\n\ngovernment operates 5 TV channels and 19 radio channels;
