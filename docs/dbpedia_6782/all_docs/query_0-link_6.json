The ranking by population density is headed by far by microstates like Monaco, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nThe second line is dominated by countries well known for their poverty rates. Here, large families are protection against elderly poverty. The giants in export and industry like Taiwan or South Korea can also be found near the top.\n\nThe United States comes 83rd with a density of 35.2 inhabitants per square kilometer."
