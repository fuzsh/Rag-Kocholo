These countries typically have limited land areas and are often located in remote regions or island territories. Many of them are also known for their pristine natural environments, attracting tourists who seek untouched beauty and tranquility.\n\nSeveral of the least populated countries are small island nations, such as Nauru, Palau, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. These countries face unique challenges due to their geographical isolation and limited resources. They often rely heavily on tourism and fisheries as key sources of income. Additionally, some countries like San Marino and Monaco have small populations but are known for their affluent economies and high standards of living.\n\nThe least populated countries may also have distinctive cultural identities and traditions. Countries like Andorra, Luxembourg, and Iceland, despite their small populations, have rich histories and vibrant cultures. They often take pride in preserving their cultural heritage and promoting local customs.\n\nSmallest Countries by Population\n\nCountries With Smallest Population\n\nNauru is the least populated country in the world, and it is a sovereign state with a population of 10,873 people. Palau, the second least populated country, is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean, and it is home to 18,174 individuals. The British Virgin Islands, with a population of 30,423, are a British overseas territory known for their beautiful beaches and clear waters. San Marino is the fourth least populated country in the world with a population of 34,010 people. Liechtenstein is the fifth least populated country and has a population of 38,254. The Turks and Caicos Islands, with a population of 39,226, are a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean. Monaco is the seventh least populated country reporting 39,520 people. The Faroe Islands, an autonomous territory of Denmark, have a population of 49,053. The Northern Mariana Islands, with a population of 57,910, are a U.S. Commonwealth in the western Pacific Ocean. Lastly, the Marshall Islands is the tenth least populated country with a population of 59,618.\n\nThe ten least populated countries and territories in the world are:\n\n1. Nauru – 10,873\n\n2. Palau – 18,174\n\n3. British Virgin Islands – 30,423\n\n4. San Marino – 34,010\n\n5. Liechtenstein – 38,254\n\n6. Turks and Caicos Islands – 39,226\n\n7. Monaco – 39,520\n\n8. Faroe Islands – 49,053\n\n9. Northern Mariana Islands – 57,910\n\n10. Marshall Islands – 59,618\n\nLeast Populated Country\n\nNauru is the least populated country in the world, with a population of just 10,873 people. This island nation, located in Micronesia in the Central Pacific, covers a land area of only 21 square kilometers. Despite its small size and population, Nauru has a rich history and cultural heritage. It gained independence from Australia in 1968 and has since faced various challenges, including the depletion of its phosphate reserves, which were once the country’s primary source of income. Today, Nauru’s economy relies heavily on aid, offshore banking, and the operation of regional processing centers for asylum seekers.\n\nAdvertisement"
