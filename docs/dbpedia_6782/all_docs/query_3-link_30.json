        "text": "BASIC SOCIOECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS\n\nThe total population of Middle South Asia was estimated to be more than 837 million in 1975 (UN Assessment of 1973), of which more than 90 percent was concentrated in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. This does not mean that the remaining six countries are small in terms of population size. This is true only of Bhutan and the Maldives; the population of the other four countries taken together was 79 million in 1975.\n\nOne striking characteristic of several countries of this region is their high population density. This is particularly crucial since, unlike many countries in developing regions of the world, they have no agricultural frontier for expansion and thus must depend on increases in yields for badly needed increases in agricultural production. Bangladesh, with an average of more than 558 inhabitants per square kilometer, has one of the highest population densities in the world. India and Sri Lanka have average densities approaching or exceeding 200. Besides occupying territories that are small relative to their populations, these countries are experiencing rather high average annual rates of demographic growth. Although generally lower than the averages for Africa and Latin America, growth rates are still of a magnitude that implies a potential doubling of the population in 30 years or less in most countries of the subregion. It should be further emphasized that, with the exception of Sri Lanka and to a lesser extent India, these intermediate-level rates of growth are not due to decreases in fertility but rather to continuing high mortality. In Afghanistan, the estimated life expectancy at birth in 1975 was only 35 years. Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal had life expectancies at birth below 45 years in 1975, while the value for India, Iran, and Pakistan was around 50. The only country having a life expectancy similar to that registered in several Latin American countries and in some Eastern European countries was Sri Lanka at 68 years (World Bank, 1978, table 17).\n\nTogether with Indonesia in South-East Asia, three countries of this subregion (India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan) contain two-thirds of the world’s absolute poor (World Bank, 1978, p. 38). This is in part revealed by the level of per capita gross national product (GNP), which was US$110 in Bangladesh, US$150 in India, and US$170 in Pakistan in 1976. The only country of the sub-region having a per capita GNP exceeding US$200 was oil-exporting Iran, with a value approaching US$2000. Of course, one should not over-interpret the significance of this indicator. As pointed out in the preceding chapter, it does not adequately reflect how the national product is actually distributed or the availability of social services among the different sectors of society. This has been evident when comparing certain social indicators for Iran and Sri Lanka. Although Iran had a per capita GNP almost ten times higher than Sri Lanka, adult literacy was 50 percent in 1974 as compared to 78 percent in Sri Lanka. Also, Sri Lanka had a life expectancy at birth in 1975 seventeen years higher than that in Iran. In addition, its average annual crude birth rate was less than 29 per 1,000 in the period 1970–1975, while the same index for Iran remained above 45 per 1,000 during this period. The level of Sri Lanka’s fertility reflects the social changes that have taken place among its population and is not related to a high percentage of urbanization (a relatively low 24 percent in 1975 as compared with 44 percent in Iran in the same year). These differences are still more striking if one considers that, during the 1960–1976 period, GNP increased annually at an average rate of 2 percent in Sri Lanka and at 8 percent in Iran.\n\nDuring the first half of the 1970s the other countries of the subregion, with the exception of Pakistan (with an average annual growth in GNP of 3.1 percent), were economically near stagnation, principally due to the very slow growth of the agricultural sector, upon which the majority of the population depends in these predominantly rural countries. All the other countries of the subregion except Iran have a very low percentage of urban population. In Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, for example, this percentage was below 10 in 1975. Even in India, with 11 cities of 1 million and over, the percentage of urban population was only about 22 percent in 1975 (World Bank, 1978, table 14). It is clear that in Middle South Asia, more than in any other Third World region, development efforts need to be concentrated in the rural areas, which will also be contributing to an increased pressure of population on the land.\n\nPOPULATION ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT POSITIONS ON POPULATION\n\nIn 1952 India became the first country of the world to adopt an official policy aimed at reducing fertility. This decision was preceded by many years of public debate on the significance of population growth and its impact on development possibilities (Desai, 1978, pp. 16–18). Since that date, the Indian average annual crude birth rate seems to have dropped from a level of 42.3 in the period 1950–1955 to 39.9 in 1970–1975. Many explanations have been advanced for the modest results of the activities addressed at achieving a reduction of fertility in India: lack of effective official implementation of the program, poor administration at the service level, cultural barriers, low level of social development. There have been, however, examples of success in reducing birth rates in certain parts of India. The most frequently cited case is the state of Kerala, where fertility started to decline in the early 1960s. Kerala has been described as having the highest population density (549 per square kilometer), the highest rate of female literacy (54 percent), the largest average village size, and one of the lowest urban and rural infant and general mortality rates (Dandekar, 1977, p. 360). All of these favorable indicators, together with a higher average age at marriage, have contributed to produce a birth rate that in 1974 was around 26 in both urban and rural areas. Kerala has also been singled out as a state with a dynamic and progressive political leadership over a long period of years--a factor that has contributed to its present advanced level of social development. This has been cited in support of the argument that “low levels of fertility result from public policies which effectively increase levels of social justice and economic equity throughout society” (Ratcliffe, 1978, p. 16).\n\nOther countries of Middle South Asia that have official policies addressed at curtailing the level of fertility are--in the order of date of adoption--Pakistan (1960), Sri Lanka (1965), Nepal (1966), and Bangladesh (1971). All of them have set quantitative targets. The government of Iran entrusted the Ministry of Health in 1970 with the development of a family planning program. The only country that can claim an important degree of success is Sri Lanka, where a 25 percent decrease in the birth rate has been accomplished in a 20-year period. This has occurred almost simultaneously with a shift toward a pattern of marriage at later ages. As pointed out above, Sri Lanka also presents some very favorable social indicators.\n\nIt is worth noting that in the cases of Bangladesh and Nepal, the population policy adopted has set targets for the reduction of general mortality in the first country and of infant mortality in the second. Furthermore, in Nepal the policy has the following additional objectives: (a) to check immigration into Nepal; (b) to control existing patterns of migration from rural to urban areas; (c) to increase the density of population in agricultural areas; and (d) to develop small towns in selected areas. This places Nepal in the category of countries that have a rather comprehensive population policy (Desai, 1978, pp. 21–22).\n\nWith the rather low level of urbanization, very high average density, and scarcity of agricultural land found in several of the countries of this region, internal migration policies would appear to be very important. According to the UN Population Commission’s (1976) report on “Measures Undertaken at the National, Regional and International Levels to Implement the World Population Plan of Action,” India, Iran, the Maldives, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are implementing policies intended to decrease the flow of internal migration, while Bhutan appears to be attempting to accelerate it and Bangladesh to reverse it.\n\nIt is also understandable that, faced with conditions such as those described above, international migration is not a primary concern in these countries. Iran is the only country of the subregion that has adopted measures addressed at increasing international migration.\n\nIn summary, the recognition of population growth as representing one kind of a problem or another is quite general in the countries of Middle South Asia. This is also true to some extent of Afghanistan, whose 1972–1977 economic plan takes note of such issues as high mortality, unemployment, and population distribution. Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan have experimented with incentive schemes to lower fertility and the first two plus Iran have included delayed marriage as part of their population policy. Concern about the interrelation between socioeconomic development and fertility decline is reflected in the policies of Bangladesh (Desai, 1978, pp. 20–25).\n\nSTATUS OF POPULATION RESEARCH, DATA BASE, AND INSTITUTIONAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH\n\nRecent Research Directions\n\nPopulation research in Middle South Asia has a longer history than that in any other developing region, with Indian scholars having taken the lead. An examination of the population studies conducted in the subregion in the recent past reveals the overwhelming participation of Indian professionals (Desai, 1978). Desai’s survey shows that in the six-year period 1971–1976, more than 1,600 pieces of literature on demographic topics were prepared in India. In contrast, the other six large countries of Middle South Asia together produced only a little over 1,000 titles, even when the search is extended as far back as 1950. Among these, the largest contribution was that of Pakistan, followed by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. While numbers tell nothing about the quality of the work performed, 14/ they serve as a rough indication of the importance of population studies in the different countries, and to some extent of the level of human resources available to undertake such studies.\n\nIn India, as in many other developing countries, family planning as a topic initially received the most research attention: for the period through 1970, 30 percent of all published research on population was devoted to family planning. While the predominance of family planning as a research topic appears to have declined somewhat (27 percent of all population literature, including unpublished materials, during the period 1971–1976), nuptiality--an important variable in the determination of fertility levels--remains a neglected subject, accounting for only 2 percent of writings since 1970. Internal migration (20 percent) has been the second most frequent subject of study for population specialists in India. The bulk of the writings under this heading refer to urbanization and are concerned with examining the urban situation rather than with analyzing the process of urbanization. Population growth--including trends, projections, and general policy prescriptions--accounted for 14 percent of all literature on population during 1971–1976, while 12 percent referred to fertility and 10 percent to structure and composition of the population. Mortality and morbidity studies were very few (7 percent), and international migration was almost entirely neglected during the period.\n\nNearly one-half (47 percent) of the total stock of Indian population literature identified by Desai consisted of methodological exercises related to data collection, evaluation, processing and analysis, or general discussions of trends and status. Such studies fall precisely into the first two “steps” in the evolution of population research referred to earlier (see Chapter 1, pp. 15). They provide the basis for creating an awareness concerning the consequences of population trends for economic and social development. Materials concerned with the interaction between population and development variables (grouped by Desai under the three categories of consequences of population trends, their determinants, and interrelations between demographic and other socioeconomic factors) together accounted for less than one-third of the total volume, with the bulk of the writings on determinants relating to fertility and family planning.\n\nIf the above classification of demographic research undertaken in India during the early 1970s is valid, we can conclude that population research has remained at a rather low level of development, with very little, if any, theoretical sophistication. Considering that India has had a well-defined population policy since 1952 and that basic data have been more plentiful than in other developing nations, research has lagged well behind the demands posed to population scholars by social, economic, and political events.\n\nThe classification of literature for the rest of Middle South Asia (again, including “processed” as well as published materials, but here covering the period roughly 1950–1976) yields a broadly similar picture. Here too, family planning claims first place in descending order of importance, with 30 percent of the total. Internal migration, including urbanization, has received considerably less attention (5 percent), while population growth (including trends, projections, and general policy prescriptions and general writings account for a much larger share of the total; together they form over 31 percent of the literature as compared to the corresponding figure of 21 percent for India. It may also be noted that international migration has received, comparatively speaking, more attention in the case of the rest of Middle South Asia, though still very little (3 percent). Descriptive and methodological writings claim an even larger bulk of the total (60 percent) than in India. Potentially policy-relevant writings--studies of consequences, determinants, and interrelations--represent only 21 percent of the population literature of these six countries (Desai, 1978, tables B1–B17).\n\nThe Data Base\n\nThe availability of basic demographic data in this subregion varies among the countries. Nevertheless, considering the overwhelming numerical preponderance of India’s population, it can be argued that demographic data are available for most of the population of the subregion, unlike in other developing regions. India possesses a sizeable data base, together with an infrastructure of institutions, centers, and official establishments that generate all manner of data on population. The basic sources of demographic data are: the decennial census, which has a 100-year history; the vital registration system, initiated in some parts at about the same time as the census; the National Sample Survey, established along with the introduction of planning; the Sample Registration Scheme, launched in the mid-sixties to provide an alternative source of estimates of vital rates to the vital registration system, which had always been grossly inadequate; and a great number of sample surveys on population variables, with an emphasis on fertility and family planning. A staggering quantity of raw statistics has accumulated and continues to do so at a rapid pace. Yet, for the purpose of research, it has been necessary for individual scholars to use all possible ingenuity to evaluate and process the data according to their own needs (Desai, 1978, pp. 34–35).\n\nIn Nepal a data base has been created by conducting three successive censuses (1952–1954, 1961, and 1971). Analysis of the census data does not, however, seem to be well developed. In addition, a demographic sample survey was conducted in 1974–1975.\n\nBangladesh and Pakistan share with India a common history of population census-taking and vital registration up to the time of independence in 1947. Between 1947 and 1971, in addition to census and vital registration data, efforts to produce up-to-date data on mortality and fertility in Bangladesh and Pakistan included the Population Growth Estimation Project in the early 1960s, the National Impact Survey conducted during 1968–1969, and the Population Growth Survey, begun about the same time. In 1974, Bangladesh conducted both a census and a Retrospective Survey of Fertility and Mortality.\n\nTo add to the significant wealth of data on the subregion, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka have already published a first report within the World Fertility Survey program and Bangladesh will be issuing one soon.\n\nIn addition to the data that can be considered of a traditional nature, Middle South Asia abounds in examples of non-traditional sources of data useful for population studies, such as village-level studies conducted by anthropologists, demographers, economists, and other social scientists. As in other developing regions, there is also a valuable fund of knowledge on population phenomena that has been generated by other kinds of studies, for example, in the field of regional development and urban planning.\n\nTo conclude, it appears as if Middle South Asia is one of the subregions of the developing world where a more ample data base exists.\n\nInstitutional and Human Resources\n\nConsidering the presence of Indian institutions and scholars, this subregion can perhaps be assessed as having a reasonably adequate capacity for demographic and related social science research. If this capacity is placed against the size of the subregion’s population, however, then the emerging picture is of a deficient capacity. A survey undertaken on the occasion of the Second Asia Population Conference (UN, 1975, p. 401) reported that there were 56 institutions undertaking research, and teaching in the population field in India. Of these institutions, 10 had population and demography as their major field of interest. The largest group listed economics as their main area of emphasis, followed by social sciences, and two indicated the subject of family planning as their special concern. Many of these institutions offer training at the post-graduate level. Another training facility that has contributed significantly to the increased availability of personnel trained in population is the International Institute for Population Studies (IIPS), the first center for demographic training and research established by the United Nations in 1957. Sponsored by the Indian government, the IIPS provides training at both the national and regional levels to prepare personnel capable of designing and carrying out scientific and didactic activities in the field of population. IIPS offers a one-year “certificate” and a two-year “diploma” course. Doctoral degrees awarded by the University of Bombay, with which IIPS is affiliated, can also be obtained in demography under the guidance of the Institute. During the period 1957–1971, almost 400 students graduated from IIPS, 79 percent from the “certificate” course. Only five students worked toward a Ph.D. degree in demography at IIPS during this period. The national distribution of graduates shows a very strong representation of Indian students (64 percent). Less than 9 percent of graduates were from Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, and the remainder came from other Asian countries.\n\nThe other countries that reported the existence of population research and training institutions to the UN survey were Pakistan (12), 15/ Iran (6), and Sri Lanka (6), but only in Iran were some of these institutions primarily concerned with population and demography.\n\nThe UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is another important contribution to the training of personnel capable of carrying out different activities in the field of population. The Commission has regularly organized seminars and working groups in which valuable exchange of knowledge and experiences, particularly in the field of family planning programs, has taken place. It has also convened numerous expert groups to examine specific fields of activity. These groups evaluate the situation in a specific field, recommending guidelines for its future development. One of the groups convened in 1977 examined the field of population and development planning.\n\nAnother important contribution of ESCAP, because of its value in maintaining liaison and communication between scholars of the region, is the publication of a Directory of Key Personnel and Periodicals in the Field of Population for the entire region and the quarterly Asian and Pacific Population Programme News. Another useful guide is the Directory of Institutions Engaged in Research, Teaching and Training in Demography, first published in 1972 and twice up-dated.\n\nThe preceding succinct examination of the institutional capacities for population teaching and research in Middle South Asian countries suggests that they are insufficient, with India enjoying a slight advantage over the others. While most of these governments seem to be seeking to implement population policies, our brief examination of the type of population studies undertaken in the recent past suggests that research remains at a rather incipient level of development. There is no doubt that descriptive and methodological research has been useful in identifying and quantifying the basic characteristics of specific demographic situations and their expected future evolution. In most circumstances, it has been the only basis for policy decisions. Policy-makers, however, require a better understanding of how demograhic dynamics interact with social, economic, and political phenomena, which are precisely the areas to which public policies are generally addressed.\n\nIndia, with a recognized tradition of research in the general social science area, 16/ could probably play an important role in helping to support, expand, and strengthen the move already under way in the population field toward emphasizing theory construction and testing as a means of studying causation. There are already examples in India of the important contributions that scholars in disciplines other than demography, notably economics, can make. Top academic economists have not only contributed to the development of good scientific research, but have also played a significant role in policy-making. The task is one of going beyond the traditionally restricted definition of “demographic” research.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nDandekar, Kumudini. 1977. “Relationship between acceptance of contraception and socio-economic factors: comparative studies of Kerala and Uttar Pradesh.” In International Population Conference, Mexico 2:357–374.
