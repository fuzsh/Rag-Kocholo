        "text": "Ecological factors\n\nAgriculture remains the mainstay of Asia, though the proportion of the population engaged in agriculture is steadily declining. Although marginal lands in many parts of South and East Asia have been brought under cultivation, and many former pastoral ranges in Southwest and Central Asia are now irrigated, the broad ecological factors touched upon above have continued to give rise to geographic variations in population and economic activity. Parts of South and East Asia can support dense populations. Moister regions in the southwest—for example, in Turkey and northern Iran—support large populations.\n\nIn Southwest and Central Asia in general, however, agricultural productivity and population density vary markedly with the regional pattern of precipitation or the availability of water from humid highlands nearby. In the Central Asian republics the older pastoral nomadism has been transformed into organized transhumance (i.e., the seasonal migration of stock between lowlands and mountains); consequently, the families that were formerly nomadic have become permanent residents in villages, and only herders accompany the flocks and herds. Northern Asia remains a semideveloped frontier region with short-season crops growing in favoured southern localities, even though breeding of newer varieties has extended agriculture northward. The Arctic fringe is being developed on the basis of mineral resource exploitation, but only in particular localities. Siberia has remained lightly populated, with the population concentrated in scattered local centres. The agriculturally productive river plains of South Asia, China, and Southeast Asia have supported dense rural populations and large cities since the beginnings of civilization. Irrigated agriculture has provided the surplus to sustain urban elites.\n\nRural settlement\n\nPopulation densities have everywhere increased, and the modernization of agriculture, increased mineral exploitation, and industrialization have brought cultural change. Some of the small ethnic groups have been dying out, but larger groups often have accepted change and have increased in numbers. In South and East Asia, growing lowland populations have been pressing hard on the available land as population densities exceed 2,000 persons per square mile (750 per square km). In Indonesia, government programs have encouraged farmers to relocate from Java, one of the most densely populated places on Earth, to more thinly populated Indonesian islands, where ethnic Javanese have sometimes come into conflict with indigenous peoples.\n\nSimilarly, in Central Asia, both Chinese and Russian settlement programs have moved peoples from heavily populated regions into frontier zones in order to develop both agricultural and industrial resources. In southern Siberia the Soviet settlement program spread a thick wedge of European Russians and assorted ethnic minorities eastward to the Pacific Ocean and northward along every river valley to the Arctic Ocean. As a result, many of the Paleo-Siberian ethnic groups have been submerged and absorbed. Old trading posts, oasis towns, and the few old cities of southern Siberia and the Central Asian republics have been developed into modern industrial centres; those locations have been linked to modern transport systems by which raw materials and manufactured products flow to the European regions. Most new cities have been populated largely by European Russians, with Asian peoples remaining chiefly in the rural areas. The modernization of Southwest Asia—through the renaissance of Turkey and the impact of petroleum exploitation on the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, and Iran—has altered many of the old patterns of ethnic groupings in those areas. A further alteration of the historic pattern came in 1948 with the creation of the State of Israel, to which large numbers of Jews from North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North America have migrated.\n\nUrban settlement\n\nMore than two-fifths of all Asians live in and around cities and towns, and increasing urbanization is heightening regional contrasts in population density. Israel, Japan, and Singapore are among the most highly urbanized countries in the world, and Asia claims several of the world’s largest metropolises. Two basic factors account for that concentration: natural population growth in the cities themselves and large-scale rural-to-urban migration. In many cities, such as Kolkata (Calcutta), Mumbai (Bombay), Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, and even Shanghai, the ceaseless influx overwhelms the existing capacity to provide jobs, services, and appropriate shelter for new arrivals. The results are squatter settlements and shantytowns that may contain as many as half of the city’s people. Such areas typically lack proper water supply, electricity, sanitation, and transportation facilities, although over time the quality of the makeshift dwellings often improves.\n\nA distinctive adaptation on a large scale, called the extended metropolis, is emerging in some areas. In such a development, the expanding peripheries of the great cities merge with the surrounding countryside and villages, where a highly commercialized and intensive form of agriculture continues yet where an increasing portion of the farmers’ income is derived from nonfarm work. Some decentralization of urban industry occurs, and many new industrial and service jobs become available for the rural population. Movement of goods and people is extensive, if basic, achieved with bicycles, mopeds, carts, trucks, buses, and trains. The quasi-rural environs of urban centres offer to investors and residents alike advantages such as lower land costs, better labour markets, and less congestion and environmental pollution than exist in the cities proper. The extended metropolis model is thus an alternative form of urban growth that helps to divert what might otherwise be an overwhelming flood of migrants to the great cities. Beijing-Tianjin, Shanghai-Nanjing, Hong Kong–Guangzhou, Delhi–New Delhi, Mumbai-Pune, and Seoul are examples of a form of growth that can lead eventually to the kind of megalopolitan development found in the Tokyo-Yokohama–Ōsaka-Kōbe corridor of Japan.\n\nSripati Chandrasekhar Clifton W.
