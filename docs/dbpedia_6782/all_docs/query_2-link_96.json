        "text": "Hint:Population density is a measurement of population per unit area, or exceptionally a unit volume. It is frequently applied to living organisms, most of the time to humans. It is a key geographical term.\n\nComplete answer:\n\nThe most densely packed places on earth include Macau, Monaco, and Singapore, with Macau topping the list. High population density can lead to innovative living solutions, as well as increased opportunities.\n\nOption A) China – is an incorrect answer because Macau is a Special administrative region (SAR) of China and as such is not an entirely a country in its own right. Macau is located southwest of Hong Kong but it is not a sovereign country. Thus, it is incorrect here.\n\nOption B) Monaco – is a correct answer because it is the second most densely populated country on earth after Macau but Macau is not an entirely a country in its own right. So, Monaco becomes the first and most densely populated country of the world with about 50,818 people per square mile. The official language in Monaco is French. It is a correct answer.\n\nOption C) India – is an incorrect answer because India is the 29th most densely populated country of the world. It is not on the 1st rank. India is the second most populated country in the world after China. So, it is incorrect here.\n\nOption D) Sri Lanka – is an incorrect answer because Sri Lanka is 40th most densely populated country in the world. It is not on the 1st rank. Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, is in Southern Asia. It is incorrect here.\n\nHence the correct answer is option ‘B’.\n\nNote:The capital of the countries are:\n\nChina - Beijing\n\nMonaco - Monaco\n\nIndia - Delhi\n\nSri Lanka - Colombo"
