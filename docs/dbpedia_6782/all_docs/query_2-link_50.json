        "text": "Project on Common Mental Disorders\n\nOur strategy was to build a population-based twin registry through a specific project. In this update we describe a relatively low cost method to ascertain older twins (over 18 years) through a census conducted in the Colombo district. This project was funded by the Wellcome Trust and conducted as a collaboration between the Institute of Psychiatry (IOP), King’s College, London; The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Human Genetics Programme, and the SLTR. This collaboration was built on existing mental health research links between the IOP and SLTR. We also obtained clearance from ethical review committees at the IOP, WHO (Geneva) and Sri Jayewardenepura University of Sri Lanka.\n\nOur objective was to build a population-based twin register in the district of Colombo for a twin study on common mental disorders. We aimed to identify a random sample of 4000 twins (2000 twin pairs), ascertained by the twin census. We also aimed to identify a parallel sample of 1000 nontwins ascertained using the same sampling procedure. Several features made this study unusual: First, it was based on a true population sample. Second, it took place in a developing country, with a population experiencing wide disparities of environmental risk factors. Third, we sought to measure the environmental risk factors directly, instead of only relying on the equal environments assumption. Finally, we aimed to identify a nontwin sample ascertained in the same way, in order to determine the degree to which twins were representative of the wider population.\n\nWe translated and adapted several questionnaires including the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI; WHO, 1997) using current and life-time psychiatric diagnoses, the Bradford Somatic Inventory (Mumford et al., 1991), the Chalder Fatigue Scale (Chalder et al., 1993), the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (Smith et al., 2002), SF-36 Health Status Survey Questionnaire (Ware & Sherbourne, 1992), and the Life Events Questionnaire (Bhugra & Cragg, 1990). We developed questionnaires on suicidal ideations, exposure to war and tsunami, and socioeconomic deprivation. We trained 25 research assistants (RA), with the goal of interviewing 5000 participants. The minimum interview duration was 120 minutes. Funding was provided for buccal smear testing of same gender twins in order to determine zygosity.\n\nTwin Register\n\nFor administrative purposes, Sri Lanka is divided into nine provinces and 25 districts. The district of Colombo is the most populous district (population 2,251,274), with 12% of the total population (Department of Census and Statistics, 2005; ). It is divided into 13 divisional secretariat divisions (DSDs) and each DSD is further divided into several grama niladhari divisions (GNDs). The GND is the smallest administrative unit, and is headed by a grama niladhari (GN). Colombo district has 557 GNDs. The GN is a civil servant, and visits each home in their administrative division once a year to update the electoral register. They distribute, and subsequently collect, a form to each house, in order to collect data about each occupant over 18 years. Sri Lanka has a vibrant and participatory democracy, with over 80% of the population participating in recent general and presidential elections. As failure to register on the electoral roll results in a loss of the right to vote as well as exclusion from other administrative and welfare activities carried out by the state, distribution and completion of registration forms is performed with diligence by both the administration and the electorate.\n\nA national population census was most recently conducted in 2001. During this census all streets and byroads were marked, and housing as well as non-housing units were identified and counted. Four of the most densely populated DSDs are situated in Colombo city itself (Colombo, Thimibirigasyaye) and adjacent suburbs in the south along the coast (Rathmalana, Dehiwala; shaded rows and ).\n\nTable 1\n\nDSD in Colombo districtPopulationDensity* Housing unitsHI (%)HPBPLColombo380,94621,33769,80012.139,819Thimbirigasyaya266,15411,89554,4604.49672Rathmalana108,716826925,6774.24058Dehiwala101,83012,12423,8102.11896Moratuwa177,563924639,92510.316,908Hanwella94,00164424,70014.212,562Maharagama185,193495842,8073.55973Kaduwela209,251238552,9106.011,614Kolonnawa161,247619336,1338.212,292Homagama186,050156347,3386.410,797Kesbewa209,619341151,2345.210,326Padukka54,33851815,01010.75439Kotte116,366704627,0312.72750Total2,251,2743310.84510,8356.0144,106\n\nThe GNDs in these four DSD areas are therefore also heavily populated (average population per GND is 12,826) so GNs are assisted by electoral department officers (EDOs) to update the electoral register. The other nine DSD are semiurban and rural areas, and individual GNs conduct the electoral register update unassisted (average population per GND is 2820).\n\nThe cooperation of necessary public officials was obtained to collect data about twins during the annual update of electoral register in 2003. A separate form was devised in the three main languages of Sinhalese, Tamil and English, which inquired about the informant’s name, telephone, address and details about twins known to the informant. This was distributed and collected by GNs along with the electoral register update form. GNs and EDOs were given a financial incentive for conducting the survey. In one of the four DSD divisions (Dehiwala), GNs took a collective decision to distribute twin census forms themselves, instead of giving them to EDOs, resulting in only three DSDs where EDOs collected twin census forms.\n\nWe distributed 510,835 forms (one to every housing unit of the district), and received back 66% completed (range of 13 SDSs 33%-83%). To be considered as a housing unit, three conditions needed to be met: the unit should be a place of dwelling of human beings, it should be separated from other places of dwelling, and it should have a separate entrance. This was a two-visit survey by the GN: forms were distributed and collected 6 to 8 weeks later; no penalty or coercion was exerted to ensure filled twin census forms were returned. Some occupants posted the completed forms directly to the register.\n\nIn the 489 GNDs where GNs collected the twin census forms, completion was 75.3%. This compares to 49.3% completion in the 68 GNDs where EDOs and GNs collected the forms ( and ). Twin pairs were identified in 2.1% of households when GNs collected census forms and 1.3% of households when EDOs and GNs collected the forms. GNs are members of the community appointed by the government and serve as the link between the government administration and the people. As each GND is responsible for issuing identity cards, birth and death registration and other administrative and welfare activities, GNs have a close rapport with the people in their GND. GNs are available to the public 3 days per week in their offices, and they are can also usually be contacted at other times at their residence. The census officers only visit once a year to update the electoral register, and probably have less rapport with the people. Due to this, the distribution and collection of twin census forms by EDOs instead of GNs may have resulted in low returns from the areas covered by EDOs. There was a negative correlation (r = –.81) between population density and the number of twin pairs (per thousand people) in the DSDs and there was a positive correlation (r = .74) between the number of twin pairs (per thousand) and the percentage of returned forms (from each DSD). This shows that with increasing population density the number of twin pairs ascertained by the census decreases. It also demonstrates that as population density increases, so too does the percentage of returned and filled census forms. The correlation between the percentage of people living below the poverty line in a DSD and the number of twin pairs (per thousand) in that DSD, was .15 (Department of Census and Statistics, 2005). Although it was speculated that the percentage of completed and returned census forms and subsequently the number of twins ascertained would be low from poorer areas (DSDs) of the district, the low correlation did not support this.\n\nTable 2\n\nDSDForms DistributedForms received% ReceivedTwin pairs reportedTwin rateColombo69,80034,58849.5510972.88Thimbirigasyaye54,46017,73732.576532.45Rathmalana25,67714,35355.902492.29Dehiwala23,81016,15667.853032.98Moratuwa39,92532,49481.396093.43Hanwella24,70021,72487.955966.34Maharagama42,80730,19270.5310075.44Kaduwela52,91041,52878.4910785.15Kolonnawa36,13324,09166.679475.87Homagama47,33838,01480.3010755.78Kesbewa51,23438,45875.0611835.64Padukka15,01012,43182.823426.29Kotte27,03116,79962.155094.37Total510,835338,56566.289,6484.29"
