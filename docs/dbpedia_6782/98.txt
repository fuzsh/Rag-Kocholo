Sri Lanka population 2024

During 2024 Sri Lanka population is projected to increase by 109,441 people and reach 21,910,505 in the beginning of 2025. The natural increase is expected to be positive, as the number of births will exceed the number of deaths by 212,778. If external migration will remain on the previous year level, the population will be declined by 103,337 due to the migration reasons. It means that the number of people who leave Sri Lanka to settle permanently in another country (emigrants) will prevail over the number of people who move into the country (to which they are not native) in order to settle there as permanent residents (immigrants).

Population change rates in 2024

According to our estimations, daily change rates of Sri Lanka population in 2024 will be the following:

980 live births average per day (40.84 in an hour)

397 deaths average per day (16.55 in an hour)

-283 emigrants average per day (-11.80 in an hour)

The population of Sri Lanka will be increasing by 300 persons daily in 2024.

Demographics of Sri Lanka 2023

As of 1 January 2024, the population of Sri Lanka was estimated to be 21,801,064 people. This is an increase of 0.50 % (108,895 people) compared to population of 21,692,169 the year before. In 2023 the natural increase was positive, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 211,716. Due to external migration, the population declined by 102,821. The sex ratio of the total population was 0.974 (974 males per 1,000 females) which is lower than global sex ratio. The global sex ratio in the world was approximately 1,016 males to 1,000 females as of 2023.

Below are the key figures for Sri Lanka population in 2023:

355,968 live births

144,253 deaths

Natural increase: 211,716 people

Net migration: -102,821 people

10,756,287 males as of 31 December 2023

Sri Lanka population density

Sri Lanka population density is 332.3 people per square kilometer (860.6/mi2) as of August 2024. Density of population is calculated as permanently settled population of Sri Lanka divided by total area of the country. Total area is the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines of Sri Lanka. The total area of Sri Lanka is 65,610 km2 (25,332 mi2) according to the United Nations Statistics Division .

Sri Lanka age structure

As of the beginning of 2024 according to our estimates Sri Lanka had the following population age distribution:

24.9 67.2 7.9

- percentage of population under 15 - percentage of population between 15 and 64 years old - percentage of population 65+

In absolute figures (estimate):

5,434,569 young people under 15 years old ( 2,771,787 males / 2,662,782 females)

14,654,675 persons between 15 and 64 years old ( 7,163,612 males / 7,491,064 females)

1,711,820 persons above 64 years old ( 737,748 males / 974,072 females)

We prepared a simplified model of the population distribution pyramid which is broken down into 3 main age groups. The groups are the same as we used above: population under 15, between 15 and 64 and population which is over 65 year old.

65+

15-64

0-14

male female

Note: The pyramid provided is not corresponding to data given above because the age groups have different number of years.

As we can see the Sri Lanka population pyramid has an expanding type. This type of pyramid is common for developing countries with high birth and death rates. Relatively short life expectancy, as well as low level of education and poor health care are also describe such kind of population age distribution model.

Age dependency ratio

Dependency ratio of population is a ratio of people who are generally not in the labor force (the dependents) to workforce of a country (the productive part of population). The dependent part includes the population under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over. The productive part of population accordingly consists of population between 15 and 64 years.

This ratio shows the pressure on productive population produced by the dependent part of population.

The total dependency ratio of population in Sri Lanka is 48.8 %.

The value of 48.8 % is relatively low. It shows that the dependent part of population is less than a half of the working part. In other words the working population (labor force) in Sri Lanka must provide goods for itself and cover expenditure on children and aged persons. And this part of population is less than 50% of working population. The value of less than 50% means that the pressure on productive population in Sri Lanka is relatively low.

Child dependency ratio

Child dependency ratio is a ratio of people below working age (under 15) to workforce of a country.

Child dependency ratio in Sri Lanka is 37.1 %.

Aged dependency ratio

Aged dependency ratio is a ratio of people above working age (65+) to workforce of a country.

Aged dependency ratio in Sri Lanka is 11.7 %.

Life expectancy

Life expectancy at birth is one of the most important demographic indicator. It shows the number of years a newborn infant would live assuming that birth and death rates will remain at the same level during the whole lifetime.

Total life expectancy (both sexes) at birth for Sri Lanka is 75.7 years.

This is above the average life expectancy at birth of the global population which is about 71 years (according to Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations).

Male life expectancy at birth is 72.2 years.

Female life expectancy at birth is 79.4 years.
