Though truthfully, I was aiming at a pheasant; the silver snow and the silver birches played tricks with the light, and as if by magic, pheasant turned into sparrow.\n\nWhen I saw what my arrow had done, I cried with empty eyes, too dry to make tears. The sparrow wouldn’t amount to a mouthful of grotty bones–and even a starving woman knows songbirds are sacred to at least one goddess.\n\nMy knees plowed into the snow beside the small creature. “How, how, how?” I fretted. “How did you become a sparrow, pheasant?” The bird did not answer, but when I reached to remove the arrow piercing its body, the accusatory glare of a beadish eye stopped me. A trickle of blood slid from its nares, and the bright eye closed.\n\n“Do not be dead!” I cried. “I would give anything for you not to be dead.”\n\nAnd while the breath-mist of this rash statement still hung in the air, a bear-god waddled out of the forest, lumbering and large.\n\nThe bear-god said: “The sparrow will not die, if you live as my wife for a year and a day.”\n\nI licked my lips, tasting the clear, salty snot that comes of crying, and said, “I already have a husband.”\n\nThe bear-god regarded me with placid eyes. “And I already have a wife.”\n\nI stared at him, the dying sparrow lying in a bloody lump between us, struggling to breathe.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “Yes, anything.”\n\nShow Notes\n\nRated R because those unionbusters don’t play around, and they might just be genuine bloodsuckers.\n\nSmokestacks Like the Arms of Gods\n\nby Ben Burgis\n\nAt the time, it was pretty exciting stuff. The flaming torches on the tunnel walls as me and half a dozen of my fellow inductees rushed to the ceremony. The older guys who’d known my Da all standing around and beaming down at me as I pricked the drop of blood from my fingertip and pledged eternal loyalty to my fellow workers. Then the singing of the Anthem of the Red Flag and my first taste of whiskey.\n\nRaise the scarlet standard high,\n\nBeneath its folds we’ll live and die…\n\nI knew Guilds weren’t exactly legal, but everyone still seemed to be in one. I’d heard some talk of Guilds sabotaging machinery when conditions got really bad, even walking off the job. In the excitement of the induction ceremony, I didn’t realize just yet that Guilds didn’t do that sort of thing any more.\n\nIn our grandfathers’ era, they might have gone on strike. Now that the companies have smartened up and started using drinkers instead of regular humans for plant security, we pretty much drink whiskey and hold induction ceremonies and sing. Good jaunty song, though, real nice beat to it.\n\nLet cowards flinch and traitors sneer,\n\nWe’ll keep the red flag flying here…\n\nShow Notes\n\nRated R for fierce princesses, bloody warlords, and living rocks who will grind you down.\n\nThis episode was brought to you by audible, your destination for the widest selection of digital audiobooks available for download.\n\nLove Among the Talus\n\nby Elizabeth Bear\n\nYou cannot really keep a princess in a tower. Not if she has no brothers and must learn statecraft and dancing and riding and poisons and potions and the passage of arms, so that she may eventually rule.\n\nBut you can do the next best thing.\n\nIn the land of the shining empire, in a small province north of the city of Messaline and beyond the great salt desert, a princess with a tip-tilted nose lived with her mother, Hoelun Khatun, the Dowager Queen. The princess‚ whose name, it happens, was Nilufer‚ stood tall and straight as an ivory pole, and if her shoulders were broad out of fashion from the pull of her long oak-white bow, her dowry would no doubt compensate for any perceived lack of beauty. Her hair was straight and black, as smooth and cool as water, and even when she did not ride with her men-at-arms, she wore split, padded skirts and quilted, paneled robes of silk satin, all emerald and jade and black and crimson embroidered with gold and white chrysanthemums.\n\nShe needed no tower, for she was like unto a tower in her person, a fastness as sure as the mountains she bloomed beside, her cool reserve and mocking half-lidded glances the battlements of a glacial virginity.\n\nShow Notes\n\nRated R for unusual unicorns and deflowered virgins.\n\nStay tuned for the announcement at the end.

It smells like a storm. Clouds stack on top of each other in thick blankets. Lightning flashes in the west. It fires an electrical impulse into my body, and I push the window open. I’m on the fourth floor. “Hello!” I call out the window, leaning forward into the hundred-degree heat. The blast of hot air buoys me up like boiling water, burning me but supporting me, and I’m sure I can fly away if I just let go.\n\nMaddoc hauls me back in the window. “Are you crazy? Get back in here. You’ll fall and kill yourself.” It’s like Maddoc, to make sure everyone and everything is safe.\n\nShow Notes\n\nRated PG for feral children and the winners who write history.\n\nThis episode was brought to you by The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, out now from Orbit. You can read the first three chapters of the book at www.Nkjemisin.com.\n\nA Light in Troy\n\nby Sarah Monette\n\nSince she was literate, she had been put to work in the fortress’s library. It was undemanding work, and she did not hate it; it gave her something to do to fill the weary hours of daylight. When she had been brought to the fortress, she had expected to be ill-treated‚ a prisoner, a slave‚ but in truth she was mostly ignored. The fortress’s masters had younger, prettier girls to take to bed; the women, cool and distant and beautiful as she had once been herself, were not interested in a ragged woman with haunted half-crazed eyes. The librarian, a middle-aged man already gone blind over his codices and scrolls, valued her for her voice. But he was the only person she had to talk to, and she blurted as she came into the library, “I saw a child.”\n\n“Beg pardon?”\n\n“On the beach this morning. I saw a child.”\n\n“Oh,” said the librarian. “I thought we’d killed them all.”\n\nUnseen Academicals by Terry Pratchett\n\nReviewed by Bill Peters\n\nPodCastle’s very first review!\n\nIt is remarkably hard to review Unseen Academicals, what Terry Pratchett says will likely be his penultimate work. Most people who’ve read Pratchett and liked it have gotten attached to him in a way they don’t to other authors. Part of this is certainly due to the regular and breakneck pace at which he writes, averaging at least one book a year since the first Discworld novel was published in 1983, twenty five years ago. The other part is that many of us would like to live in his world, and we know it will soon be robbed from us.\n\nMinor Spoilers Ensue! (Don’t worry – we don’t tell you how it ends or anything!)\n\nShow Notes\n\nRated R for carnivorous mermaids, sexual shenanigans in the presence of a minor, and near death experiences. This one’s not for the kiddies.\n\nThis episode was brought to you by The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, out now from Orbit. You can read the first three chapters of the book at www.Nkjemisin.com.\n\nThe Mermaid’s Tea Party\n\nby Samantha Henderson\n\nThe mermaid barely slowed her breakneck pace as she approached and ran herself halfway up a yellow beach, belly-down and arching her back so her torso was almost upright. At the same time, she flung Cassandra casually upon the sand, half-knocking the breath out of her. Cassandra gulped for air, then scrambled as best she could up the beach, out of reach of the mermaid’s grasp — or so she profoundly hoped.\n\nThe mermaid watched her and made no move towards her, a nasty grin on her face.\n\n“I’ll find the tea, and you’ll make us a party,” she said. “Then, maybe, I’ll bring you some food.”\n\nCassandra stared. Then the import of the creature’s words struck her and she looked around, beginning to panic. The island was perhaps a mile around and very flat, save where white ridges were raised above the surface. A large wave would have swamped it. A few trees she recognized from picture books as palms clustered off-center, a green haze underneath them. There was not much else.\n\nNothing to eat, certainly.\n\nThe sand clung in a fine film to her dress and bare legs, and itched. Miss Murchinson would have been scandalized.\n\nShow Notes\n\nRated PG for wooden puppets with no desire to be human.\n\nAnn Leckie month comes to a conclusion with this rousing tale. We hope you enjoyed her choices as much as we did. Thanks, Ann!\n\nSir Hereward and Mr. Fitz Go to War Again\n\nby Garth Nix\n\n“Do you ever wonder about the nature of the world, Mister Fitz?” asked the foremost of the two riders, raising the three-barred visor of his helmet so that his words might more clearly cross the several feet of space that separated him from his companion, who rode not quite at his side.\n\n“I take it much as it presents itself, for good or ill, Sir Hereward,” replied Mister Fitz. He had no need to raise a visor, for he wore a tall lacquered hat rather than a helmet. It had once been taller and had come to a peak, before encountering something sharp in the last battle but two the pair had found themselves engaged in. This did not particularly bother Mister Fitz, for he was not human. He was a wooden puppet given the semblance of life by an ancient sorcery. By dint of propinquity, over many centuries a considerable essence of humanity had been absorbed into his fine-grained body, but attention to his own appearance or indeed vanity of any sort was still not part of his persona.\n\n(Continue Reading…)"
