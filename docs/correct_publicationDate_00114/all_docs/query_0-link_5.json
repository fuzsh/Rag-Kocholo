He has frequently been asked if his name is a pseudonym, to which he has responded, \"I guess people ask me because it sounds like the perfect name for a writer of fantasy. However, it is my real name.\"[1]\n\nBorn in Melbourne, Nix was raised in Canberra.[2] He attended Turner Primary School, Lyneham High School and Dickson College for schooling.
