        "text": "Since mid-March, I‚Äôve been furloughed from both of my part-time jobs (one as a TA at a school, one a customer service position at a non-essential business), but have been lucky enough to have a stable living situation so I don‚Äôt need to stress about not being able to pay rent or buy groceries, etc.\n\nSo I‚Äôve had a lot of time to myself, and to prevent my anxiety flaring up, I‚Äôve been losing myself in a lot of books. I‚Äôd like to recommend ten books today that I‚Äôve fallen in love with since quarantine started. These will be books that I‚Äôve rated four or five stars that I read after quarantine started. For obvious reasons, I‚Äôve purposely limited myself to either standalones or first in a series so that you can pick these up without worrying about ‚Äúneeding to read the series in order‚Äù lol.\n\nAll links in this post lead to Bookshop.org, an online indie retailer that supports local bookstores everywhere.

Always shop local rather than resorting to the mighty ‚ÄòZon! üòâ\n\nFantasy books for the quarantined soul\n\nClariel by Garth Nix (Buy on Bookshop.org)\n\nThough this is marked #4, this prequel to the bestselling Abhorsen series can be read as a standalone. Taking place 600 years before Book One, we follow Clariel, who is a young woman with the blood of both the legendary Abhorsens and the king, but whose dreams of living a simple life as a forest ranger are hijacked when her mother moves her to the big city of Belisaere and tries to arrange a marriage to a young man whom Clariel knows to be a killer. Everyone around her expects Clariel to be the one to solve all the problems and Clariel gets a little pissed off that they‚Äôre expecting a teenage girl to save the day. This is such a fun subversion of the Chosen One trope, and Clariel is not your typical hero. Having read Sabriel, Lirael, and Abhorsen already, I was expecting Clariel to be a typical hero like Sabriel and Lirael were in their books: forced into unfortunate circumstances and find within herself the courage to rise above it and do the right thing and save the day. I don‚Äôt want to spoil it any more than that, but I‚Äôll just say that the quote on the cover, ‚ÄúA passion thwarted will often go astray‚Äù definitely does not refer to anything you might expect and this book blew my actual mind, proving once again that Garth Nix is the god of fantasy and is very worthy of being my favorite author of all time.\n\nPeter and the Starcatchers by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson (Buy on Bookshop.org)\n\nA long time ago in high school, my friend pushed this book into my hands and told me to read it. Before I could finish it to the last page, however, she suddenly had to transfer schools and so I gave her back the copy and told myself I would just buy my own at some point and finish it later. Well, that point is now. Ten years later, I have finally finished this book. This is a prequel to Peter Pan, and as I understand it, it is meant to be a prequel specifically to the Disney movie, though it does keep to the original story very well.\n\nWe follow Peter as an orphan, being shipped off to a foreign country with his best friends to be a literal slave in the palace of the neighboring kingdom, Rundoon. What Peter doesn‚Äôt realize is that A) their ship carries a valuable treasure, and B) the most fearsome pirate captain of the entire ocean is after this treasure.\n\nThis was just a really fun read featuring one of my favorite tropes ever (pirates, duh xD) and I can‚Äôt wait to get my hands on the sequel.\n\nMagician‚Äôs Rivalry by HL Burke (Buy on Bookshop.org)\n\nOkay, okay, so this was a reread, technically. But it deserves its spot on this list because it got even better the second time around!\n\nI read this book for the first time in 2017, before starting my book blog. When I gave it a reread this past April, it BLEW MY ACTUAL MIND and I literally had to ask myself why I‚Äôd even given it four stars in the first place.\n\nAfter studying in the big city to hone his magic, Auric Spellsmith returns to his family home, expecting to finally earn his father‚Äôs approval and be able to run their little magic shop his way. Except he returns home to find that his father has hired another apprentice, Jericho Carver. Jericho has essentially replaced Auric in his father‚Äôs mind, taking his job and his father‚Äôs love. But just as Auric is getting ready to go back to the city and never see his father again, Master Spellsmith vanishes into thin air, followed quickly by Auric‚Äôs sister, and he‚Äôs forced to work together with his rival to save his father and sister. This is a fun buddy comedy adventure with a splash of steampunk fantasy, and Burke has managed to take one of my least favorite tropes (‚ÄúGood Job Breaking It, Hero!‚Äù, aka, the hero is stupid and causes the plot to happen because of stupidity or carelessness) and subvert it. I laughed at Auric‚Äôs stupidity, got the feelz for Rill‚Äôs love for her older brother Auric, and cheered for Rill and Jericho‚Äôs budding romance.\n\nSorcery of Thorns by Margaret Rogerson (Buy on Bookshop.org)\n\nEnchanted libraries from an author who‚Äôs said to be ‚Äúthe next Diana Wynne Jones‚Äù? YES PLEASE!\n\nI will admit that the first third of this book reads like a carbon copy of Howl‚Äôs Moving Castle, but with a lot less explanation about what is what, who is who, or the geography of the land. But then it kicks it into high gear and you learn that we were being fed wrong information because Elisabeth herself was being fed wrong information!\n\nFor example, in the first third or so of the book, you see that everyone is afraid of sorcerers yet does their utmost to preserve ancient spellbooks and sorcerers are allowed pretty much free access to most of the library. But then once Elisabeth is accused of murdering the woman who basically raised her when no one else would and is exiled from her home, we see that inside the library and outside the library are completely different worlds and get a much better understanding of the government and the geography.\n\nI just had so much fun reading this and it did what I hoped it would: distracted me from thoughts of the seemingly-endless pandemic and how stupid America‚Äôs current president is.\n\nThe Blackthorn Key by Kevin Sands (Buy on Bookshop.org)\n\nThis is actually the one I‚Äôve finished most recently, as of writing this post. It really surprised me. I don‚Äôt usually like historical fantasy, but this one just blew my mind.\n\nIf I may be completely honest, I was under the (mistaken) impression that the average rating for this on Goodreads was 3.71, so I had rather low expectations for it. But apparently, I had gotten the page count and average rating confused, because it was a 4.14 average and 371 pages long. xD\n\nChristopher is the apprentice to Master Blackthorn, a well-respected apothecary, and a string of murders has been targeting the city‚Äôs apothecaries. Of course, Christopher is slightly worried that the murderer will strike them next (spoiler alert: the murderer kills Master Blackthorn‚Äìthe book tries to pretend that it‚Äôs this giant shock when the reader had Blackthorn pegged the whole time as ‚Äúyou gonna die,‚Äù but I felt like that was too obvious of a plot point; also I dare you to name one wise mentor/parental figure who survives to the end of a typical YA fantasy novel. xD)\n\nThis was just a fun read and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. ALSO SHINY COVER AND YOU SHOULD BUY IT.\n\nMy next five books are a mix of genres, but they all are by authors of color and/or featuring characters of color. So I‚Äôd like to introduce some Diverse books for you to give a try, as well!\n\nHaroun and the Sea of Stories (Buy on Bookshop.org)\n\nThis book has such a long history with me; I won‚Äôt go into it here. Long story short, my fifth grade teacher was reading this to the class when I suddenly had to transfer schools in the middle of the year, so she gave me a copy of my own so I could finish the story on my own, and almost twenty years later, I finally read this book to the last page.\n\nHaroun‚Äôs father is a legendary storyteller, motivated by the love he has from his wife and son. But when Haroun‚Äôs mother abandons the family, Haroun‚Äôs father loses the ability to tell stories. And then Haroun discovers the real reason his father is such a great storyteller: he gets magic tap water from the Sea of Stories. Haroun sets out on an adventure to save the Sea of Stories from being destroyed forever and hopefully restore his father‚Äôs abilities to spin legendary tales. If you like stories about stories such as Inkheart, fun whimsical adventures like The Enchanted Forest Chronicles, or portal fantasies like The Wishing Spell, definitely pick this one up and give it a read.\n\nSand Chronicles by Hinako Ashihara (Buy on Bookshop.org)\n\nThis manga was on my radar for quite a while because it takes place in Shimane, a prefecture in Japan I never got to visit but always wanted to due to the fact that one of my favorite Youtubers, who was also a big inspiration for me to go to Japan, lived in Shimane for over a decade and talked about his life there.\n\nAnn Uekasa moves with her mother to her mother‚Äôs hometown in rural Shimane prefecture after her parents divorce. Ann can‚Äôt stand the small, tight-knit community and lack of good shopping and resists the move at first. But then tragedy strikes, and Ann comes to rely on that kindness that she once rejected.\n\nI zipped through this book in one sitting and can‚Äôt wait to get my hands on Volume 2. This is a hard-hitting contemporary that doesn‚Äôt pull any punches, so if you‚Äôre like me and you‚Äôre used to more lighthearted stories like Marmalade Boy, Ultra Maniac, or even Alice 19th, you might be in for a bit of shock. So I‚Äôd recommend going into this manga with zero expectations and just letting the story take you as it will.\n\nExtra Credit by Andrew Clements (Buy on Bookshop.org)\n\nThis is a cute middle-grade contemporary about two kids from opposite sides of the world: one in America and one in Pakistan. We start in Pakistan, with Sadeed learning that a letter has just arrived from a girl in America. She wants to be matched as a pen pal to one of the children in their village so she can learn about another culture besides her own. But even though Sadeed is the best student who can write in nearly-perfect English, it is his little sister Amira who is chosen to reply to this American girl; after all, it‚Äôs not appropriate for a boy and a girl to exchange letters like that. And so begins their unlikely friendship.\n\nThis was just so cute, albeit a bit rushed in places, and I loved so much about it. The brother-sister relationship between Sadeed and Amira, the friendship that blossomed between Sadeed and Abby, Abby‚Äôs love for the outdoors. Definitely pick this one up and give it a read, especially if you are tired of being stuck at home and are feeling a bit of wanderlust! üôÇ\n\nKatherine by Anchee Min (Buy on Bookshop.org)\n\nThis is a historical fiction novel set in 1970s communist China, about an adult ESL class that gets a new teacher only known as Miss Katherine. Through the eyes of one of the female students in the class, we see how Katherine comes to earn the love and respect of her students, and how Katherine‚Äôs Western ways come to the attention of the Chinese government, leading to her deportation. This was a really heartwarming read for me, because I recently finished a two-year stint of teaching English in Japan, so I got a kick out of Katherine talking about how much she hates the English textbook (give you one guess as to whether or not I also hated the English textbook I was forced to teach from during my contract) or trying to introduce cultural lessons, or inspiring her students to learn English for themselves. It just made me all nostalgic for my students, even though my teaching experience was thirty and some change years later, in a different Asian country, with elementary-aged kids instead of adults.\n\nSnow Flower and the Secret Fan (Buy on Bookshop.org)\n\nSpeaking of historical fiction set in China‚Ä¶\n\nThis was technically a reread for me, but I just love this one so much. This book has been one of my favorites ever since high school, and I know the entire story by heart. In fact, I‚Äôm pretty sure I would have never read any of the historical fiction and become such a fan of the genre had I not read this way back when.\n\nLily is a young girl in 1800s China in a so-so family with a so-so future. Then the matchmaker visits her home, declares her special, and matches her as a laotong, a lifelong sisterhood between two girls that improves a young woman‚Äôs marriageability and status. She and her laotong, Snow Flower, share secrets and friendship as they go from little girls to young women to married ladies. OHMYGOSH this book was amazing. One thing I will always remember about this book is that I read it only a few days before the start of my freshman year of high school. Then, in my English class, our teacher took us to the school‚Äôs library and had each of us choose a book to read and write a report on. I was procrastinating on choosing a book, and trying to figure out whether or not I could get away with rereading the Warriors series, when I saw this book sitting out on display. Without hesitation, I picked it up and remarked to myself, ‚ÄúOh, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan! I loved this book so much! Maybe I should read it again for this assignment.‚Äù At which point my teacher overheard me and immediately pushed another book into my hands: Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden, telling me, ‚ÄúIf you liked that book, this is a great one to try!‚Äù\n\nSo, yeah. If you liked Memoirs of a Geisha, then Snow Flower and the Secret Fan would be a good one for you to pick up. Or if you liked Katherine and wanted another historical Chinese book‚Ä¶\n\nSo there you have it, ten books I‚Äôve fallen in love with since quarantine started.
