They must reach the Castle of the Seven Towers, home for Tal, but a dangerous and strange place for Milla.\n\nFrom the deadly Hall of Nightmares to the magical chambers of Tal's great-uncle Ebbitt, they must navigate the Castle without being discovered. Sinister forces are conspiring against them and it will take all their strength just to survive...\n\nAll of our books are second hand, and while you may not get the exact copy shown in the picture, all of our books are in very good condition.
