        "text": "Romeo & Juliette. Those who hear those names instantly know of Shakespeare romantic tragedy. There are countless movies about it with different takes and of course books with their own variation on the tale, including changes in the ending. In many ways, the play itself has become its own genre in terms of the trope of star-crossed lovers. Many books will have similar themes to the play, but with their own set of characters and situations that differ but take inspiration from the source material.\n\nThese Violent Delights by Chloe Gong is one such tale. Taking place in a 1920s inspired Shanghai, it tells the story of Juliette Cai and Roma Montagov, both heirs to rival gangs, the Scarlets and the White Flowers. Juliette is a former flapper, who has returned to assume her role as heiress as head of the Scarlet Gang, whose power is higher than the law. Both the Scarlets and the White Flowers have fought for generations and the key player behind every move is the White Flowers heir, Roma. Both Juliette and Roma have a shared history as each other’s first loves that ended in betrayal. Things change when a mysterious contagion begins to make itself known and the stability of both gangs begins to crumble. Now Juliette and Roma must set their differences aside and work together before their gangs and the city are destroyed.\n\nGong weaves a bloody and fantastic narrative with great protagonists who are compelling as they are fun to read about. The book also has several nods to its inspiration while still coming off as its own story as well, touching on various themes and topics that are woven quite well throughout the narrative. The mystery that makes up the primary plot of the novel is well paced and one that readers will either try to guess along the way or figure out immediately.\n\nThere are many political references made through the book as well in regards to some of the things Shanghai was facing in reality during the 1920s, things the author handles very well and gives the readers something to think on in regards to history.\n\nOverall, the book is a thrilling read that will have you reaching for the sequel as soon as you reach the ending. These Violent Delights is available now along with its sequel, Our Violent Ends.\n\nYou can read several past Shakespeare inspired posts here and here and here.\n\nWritten by:\n\nLauren Lapinski\n\nInformation and Digital Services Library Assistant\n\nBitter Waters\n\nby Vivian Shaw\n\nI was disappointed when Vivian Shaw said that Grave Importance was the final book in the Dr. Greta Helsing trilogy, since I felt the modern fantasy series about a doctor who helped treat creatures of myth like vampires and mummies, had so much potential for additional fun adventures. I was therefor delighted when Bitter Waters, a stand alone novella featuring Greta, who must solve the mystery and come to the aid of a newly bitten vampire child, Lucy was announced. This one will be especially popular with vampire fans with vampires Varney, Ruthven, and Grisaille all coming to the aid of Greta in helping Lucy recover from her ordeal. I also enjoyed Shaw’s interpretation of Dracula and his part in the story as well as the small side story about a cranky elder barrow-wight. Much of the joy of the series is seeing those typically depicted as monstrous in a humanized way with regular every day issues such as dealing with an aging parent. The culprit for Lucy’s situation felt a little too easily wrapped up, offstage, but I felt like there were hints that all may not be as it seems and I’m wondering if we may be setting up for future stories; I certainly hope so. We had read the first novel in the series, Strange Practice, as apart of our Science Fiction and Fantasy book club. The group enjoyed the book and I highly recommend the series for those looking for a contemporary fantasy with British flavor.\n\nThe Left-Handed Booksellers of London\n\nby Garth Nix\n\nWe read the The Left-Handed Booksellers of London for our June book discussion on Monday, which all of the group members enjoyed. The book is marketed as for Young Adults, but has a lot that will resonate with New Adult readers and older readers may find themselves nostalgic for the 1983 setting. Susan has just moved to London and is excited to be living in the big city and the opportunity to find her father who she has never met and her spacey mother has only ever hinted about. What she finds out is that it isn’t just your average mugger she needs to look out for in the city, the things of legend really do begin to go bump in the night and her father is a being more powerful than any she could have conjured from her childhood fantasies. She is joined in her adventures by Merlin, who is amongst an unusual family of Booksellers, the Left-Handed of which like Merlin are the adventurous fighting type while the right handed are the more studious intellectual variety. The story revolves around Susan’s efforts to discover who her father is before his enemies can capture her. Lots of unique creatures romp through this creative and quirky story. For those wanting more you can check out The Sinister Booksellers of Bath.\n\nI hope you will consider joining us at next month’s Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Discussion Group where we will be discussing Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie.\n\nWritten by:\n\nAimee Harris\n\nInformation and Digital Services Manager"
