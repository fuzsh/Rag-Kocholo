        "text": "Second title in fantasy adventure series, THE SEVENTH TOWER, from bestselling author, Garth Nix. In the Dark World, society is ranked according to colour clans and the most precious commodity is light. In all the world there is only one place that ever sees the sun, a seven-towered castle on a mountain high above the desolate ice lands below.\n\nTal, a Chosen, and Milla, an Icecarl, have been thrown together on a dangerous quest to gain a Sunstone. They must reach the Castle of the Seven Towers, home for Tal, but a dangerous and strange place for Milla.\n\nFrom the deadly Hall of Nightmares to the magical chambers of Tal's great-uncle Ebbitt, they must navigate the Castle without being discovered. Sinister forces are conspiring against them and it will take all their strength just to survive...\n\nGarth Nix was born in 1963 and grew up in Canberra, Australia. After taking his degree in professional writing from the University of Canberra, he worked in a bookshop and then moved to Sydney. There he sank lower into the morass of the publishing industry, steadily devolving from sales rep through publicist until in 1991 he became a senior editor with a major multinational publisher. After a period travelling in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia in 1993, he left publishing to work as a marketing communications consultant . In 1999 he was lured back to the publishing world to become a part-time literary agent. He now lives in Sydney with his wife and two children."
