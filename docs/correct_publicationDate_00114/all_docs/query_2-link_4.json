The series was produced jointly by Beacon Pictures and ABC Studios.\n\nCreated by Andrew W. Marlowe, it primarily traces the lives of Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion), a best-selling mystery novelist, and Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), a homicide detective, as they solve various unusual crimes in New York City. Detective Beckett is initially infuriated at the thought of working with a writer and goes to great lengths to keep him out of her way. However, the two soon start developing feelings for each other. The overarching plot of the series focused on the romance between the two lead characters and their ongoing investigation of the murder of Beckett's mother.\n\nOn May 12, 2016, it was announced that despite some cast members signing one-year contracts for a potential ninth season, the show had been canceled.\n\nRichard Castle (Fillion) is a famous mystery novelist. Bored and suffering from writer's block, he kills off Derrick Storm, the main character in his successful book series. He is brought in by the New York Police Department for questioning regarding a copycat murder based on one of his novels, where he meets and becomes intrigued by Detective Kate Beckett (Katic), the officer assigned to the case. Castle is inspired to take Beckett as his muse for Nikki Heat, the main character of his next book series, and uses his friendship with the mayor to pressure the police to let him shadow Beckett. Castle's exuberant personality clashes with Beckett's more reserved and professional demeanor. However, as Beckett begins to appreciate Castle's assistance in helping her catch killers, the two eventually become friends and then lovers. Their cases often deal with murders occurring within various unusual subcultures or milieus, including reality TV shows, vampire enthusiasts, a science-fiction convention, and a man who claims to be a time traveler. A recurring plotline deals with the unsolved murder of Beckett's mother years before, an investigation that leads to an increasingly sprawling and dangerous conspiracy. The series also focuses on the backstories of supporting characters like Detectives Javier Esposito and Kevin Ryan, Medical Examiner Lanie Parish, Captain Roy Montgomery, and Captain Victoria Gates, through multiple episodes.\n\nMain article: List of Castle characters\n\nNathan Fillion as Richard Castle, born Richard Alexander Rodgers, a best-selling mystery writer.

As a tie-in, ABC and sister publisher Hyperion Books released that novel as a real book with \"Richard Castle\" as the author. It is entirely in character, from the dedication to the acknowledgments, although the latter mentions the principal cast and the show's creators by first name.[92] ABC released the first half of the novel in weekly increments on their website.[93] The complete novel was published in September 2009 as a hardcover, debuting at No. 26 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[94] In its fourth week on the list, Heat Wave broke into the top 10 at No. 6.[95] Heat Wave was released in paperback on July 27, 2010, and debuted at No. 34 on The New York Times Best Seller Paperback Mass-Market list.[96] It once again appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list on May 27, 2012, at No. 19.[97]\n\nNaked Heat, the sequel to Heat Wave, was released on September 28, 2010.[98] Naked Heat debuted at No. 7 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[99] As they did with Heat Wave, ABC released a series of the early chapters online as a promotional tool.[100] A third novel, titled Heat Rises, was released on September 20, 2011.[101] It debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list on October 9, 2011[102][103] and at No. 5 on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.[104]\n\nThe season three finale introduced a graphic novel based on Castle's previous novel character, Derrick Storm. Castle: Richard Castle's Deadly Storm was published by Marvel Comics on September 28, 2011.[105] It debuted at No. 3 on The New York Times Best Seller list on October 16, 2011.[106] This has been followed by three more graphic novels, published a year apart.\n\nA fourth novel, titled Frozen Heat, was released on September 11, 2012,[107] and debuted on The New York Times Best Seller list at No. 7 on September 23, 2012.[108] The fifth Nikki Heat novel Deadly Heat was released September 17, 2013 and debuted at No. 8 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[109] Raging Heat, the sixth novel, was released on September 16, 2014. It landed on No. 6 on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction Best Seller list[110] and on No. 17 on The New York Times Combined Print and E-Book Fiction bestseller list[111] on October 5, 2014. The seventh novel, Driving Heat,[112] was released on September 15, 2015.[113] It debuted on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction Best Seller list at No. 13[114] on October 4, 2015.\n\nOn May 20, 2016, it was announced that two more novels would be published in the Nikki Heat series, even though the show itself had been canceled. The eighth book in the series, High Heat, was published on October 25, 2016. The ninth, Heat Storm, was released in May 2017.[115]\n\nIn July 2018 a 10th Nikki Heat book was announced. Crashing Heat was published by Kingswell, a division of Disney Books, on March 12, 2019, almost three years after the TV series ended.[116]\n\nIn February 2012, Hyperion announced three e-book novellas as part of Richard Castle's famous Derrick Storm series. The first novella of the series, A Brewing Storm, was released in digital media on May 1, 2012. It debuted at No. 13 on The New York Times E-Book Fiction Best Seller list,[117] as well as No. 18 on The New York Times Combine Prints & E-book Fiction list[118] on May 20, 2012. On July 3, 2012, the second novella of the new Derrick Storm books, A Raging Storm, was released in e-book format. It landed on The New York Times Best Seller e-books list at #19[119] and at No. 31 for the combined Prints & E-book list, both on July 22, 2012.[120] The final Derrick Storm novella, A Bloody Storm, was released on August 7, 2012. It debuted on The New York Times Best Seller e-books list at #20[121] and at #34[122] on the combined Prints & E-book list on August 26, 2012.\n\nCastle: Never Judge a Book by its Cover was released on July 9, 2013.[123] The game was available on Steam and could be downloaded on most mobile devices. It is no longer available for download.[124] Players work with Castle and Beckett to find clues and stop a serial killer.[124]\n\nOn August 20, 2014, ABC announced that the early development stage had begun on a television series centered on Derrick Storm. The series was to have been a CIA procedural written by Gregory Poirier, who was to have executive-produced it with Castle's Andrew Marlowe and Terri Miller.[125] There were no subsequent announcements about a Derrick Storm TV series, indicating that development had concluded."
