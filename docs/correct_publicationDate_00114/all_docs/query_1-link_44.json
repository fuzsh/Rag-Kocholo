        "text": "I was tagged by Nikki Swift Reads to participate in the Mid-Year Book Freakout Tag, which I am renaming to the Mid-Year Book Reflections Tag because “freakout” is super-duper ableist. (for more information, see this Tumblr post written by an autistic blogger about why “freakout” is a problematic term and why) Anyway, this tag is a set of questions that you’re supposed to answer halfway through the year (aka right now) about how you’ve been doing on your reading goals so far and what you’d like to read before the end of the year. (I actually was not aware of this tag; in fact, I have a document on my computer labeled “Predictions for favorites of 2020 and reading goals for the second half of 2020” that I created before learning about this tag in which I inadvertently answered some of these questions without realizing it)\n\nAccording to my Goodreads, my average rating for books so far this year is 4.2, which isn’t bad. I’m a little surprised at that, because January and February were not good reading months for me and almost everything I picked up before lockdown started was not very good.\n\nMy goal this year is to read 120 books, and so far, I have accomplished about half of that. In fact, Goodreads thinks I’m eight books ahead of schedule right now, so that’s a very satisfying number.\n\nNow, onto the questions!\n\nBest Book You’ve Read So Far in 2020\n\nThat honor definitely belongs to A Confusion of Princes by Garth Nix. For my full thoughts on this book, you can click here to open my review of this book in a new tab, but this is definitely the top of my list of “contenders for favorite book of 2020.”I highly doubt that I’ll find anything I like more than this one (though I do have a few other Nix books I’m planning to read this year, so maybe one of those will take this spot), but this book, in summary:\n\n-Is VOICEY AF AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE I SPENT IN THIS BOOK\n\n-Was totally outside of my comfort zone (I definitely am not one to reach for space operas on a regular basis lol)\n\n-Is full of Nix’s trademark worldbuilding, and in only 330 pages and some change, he manages to craft a full world that feels satisfying enough to be a standalone (which it is).\n\n-Does something that I always love in a book, and that is THE PLOT TWIST THAT SMACKS YOU IN THE FACE WITH THE “HOW DID I NOT SEE THIS COMING” FACEPALM! The plot twists in this book were so well-done, typical of Nix, with just enough foreshadowing that it felt like a natural progression of the story, but not so much foreshadowing that you see it coming.\n\nBest Sequel You’ve Read So Far in 2020\n\nWell, this was going to be a tie between Clariel by Garth Nix or Inkdeath by Cornelia Funke, but then I realized that Clariel fits very well for a later question in this tag, as well as the fact that it’s a prequel, not a direct sequel, so I’m giving this honor to Inkdeath.\n\nInkdeath is the third and final book in the Inkworld trilogy by Cornelia Funke. I think my dad gave me the entire trilogy when I was in middle school. I did remember reading them, but I didn’t remember much about them, only that Meggie and her father were total bookworms and there was a book called Inkheart that her father read from that swallowed up her mother. So I read these as if I was reading them for the first time, essentially, and OH MY GOD THIS TRILOGY IS AMAZING. Of course, for those of you who follow my blog, you’ll remember from my 2019 Bookish Survey that Book 2 in this trilogy, Inkspell, earned the “best sequel of 2019” award, so you might have wondered where Book 3 was and if it would make the family proud by taking that honor in 2020. So far, it is.\n\nNew Release You Haven’t Read Yet, But Want To\n\nThis is a tie; one of these books is “Corinne owns me and has high expectations for me and is looking forward to reading me” and the other one is “Corinne does not have a copy of me and has low expectations for me and would just like to read me and get me out of the way so she can say ‘Been there, done that.’ and finally figure out how she feels about me.”\n\nThe one that I want to read out of obligation/pressure but I’m not expecting much out of is The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins. Though I loved the original Hunger Games trilogy, I am not particularly interested in spending 500+ pages with teenage Coriolanus Snow; I’d much rather have seen Mags’ Hunger Games (which was right around this time period, anyway) or Finnick, or Haymitch, or literally anyone else in the entire franchise. Hell, I’d have loved to see a Plutarch origin story, like what he was up to before he was appointed Head Gamemaker, how he got involved with the rebellion, and the political maneuverings he did during the 75th Hunger Games and afterward. If anyone of Suzanne Collins’ friends, family, critique partners, editorial team, agents, etc. are reading this, tell her to write that story next.\n\nThe other one is one that I’m way more excited for, and that I’ll probably be reading in July, and I have very high expectations for, and that is The Mermaid, The Witch, and the Sea by Maggie Tokuda-Hall.\n\nAll you had to say was “It’s got pirates and mermaids and it’s gay” and I was on board. (pun totally intended) But then you tell me that the author lives in my town (bonus points for supporting local authors) AND is a POC (I believe she’s Asian-American, and I specifically try and read books by BIPOC authors if I can) AND that cover AND it has a premise of a girl pirate disguising herself as a boy meaning that I can maybe use it as a comp book for my YA pirate fantasy when I’m ready to publish it? YAS PLEASE.\n\nMost Anticipated Release for the Second Half of 2020\n\nBefore I answer this, it should be noted that I’m just trying to catch up with books that have already been published, so there’s currently only one on my radar, and wouldn’t you know it, it’s another book by who could objectively be called the best author in the world. (and no, I’m totally not biased lol #sarcasm)\n\nThe Left-Handed Booksellers of London. I mean, all I really needed to know about this book was that it’s Garth Nix’s upcoming book to be released in September, but then it’s about booksellers and a girl is searching for her father (hello me who loves father-daughter relationships that drive the plot forward!) and it’s a historical fantasy, which I’ve really been getting more into lately and loving and I NEED THIS BOOK NOW\n\nBiggest disappointment\n\nI wrote down two books for this question because they fit this for similar reasons, though I don’t like to spew hate on my blog, so I’ll keep it short and sweet. Even though both of these authors passed away years ago, so I don’t feel as guilty saying bad things about these books.\n\nFirst, we have House of Many Ways by Diana Wynne Jones, which is the final book in the Howl’s Moving Castle trilogy, and which I was fully expecting to be a five-star read like its predecessors. However, it greatly disappointed, mostly because Charmain (I had to look up her name, she’s that forgettable) was just a boring POV character to hang out with. Howl and Sophie didn’t even seem like the same characters we’d met in Book One and seen briefly in Book Two. I’m not talking actually going through any sort of character development and that’s why they’re different. No, they feel like they actually went backwards in terms of character development!\n\nI did end up giving this four stars, but I feel about this book how I felt about Mockingjay–a disappointing, reluctant four stars to a third book in a trilogy that really didn’t live up to the hype.\n\nThe other disappointment was The Last Battle by CS Lewis, which is the seventh and final book in the Chronicles of Narnia series.\n\nI don’t even know what happened with this book. CS Lewis is still racist, is still trying to push religion onto kids too young to make their own decisions about it, and, dare I say it, is also a little bit sexist. Let’s take a look at the series as a whole, which I read in chronological order as opposed to publication order.\n\nBook One, The Magician’s Nephew? Four stars, a fun start to the series.\n\nBook Two, The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe? Five stars, and a new favorite!\n\nBook Three, The Horse and His Boy? *sucks in air through teeth* this is really racist and also gives the middle finger to everything we learned in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, but let’s just give it one star and move on, pretending this doesn’t exist…\n\nBook Four, Prince Caspian? Four stars, though I did enjoy the movie just a little bit more.\n\nBook Five, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader? Another four stars, though again, I enjoyed the movie just a bit more.\n\nBook Six, The Silver Chair? A very solid four stars and a fun adventure despite not being from the Pevensies’ POV!\n\nWhat have we learned today, children?\n\nThat when Lewis steps away from the religious allegory, sexism, and racism and focuses instead on writing the fun, whimsy, fantasy adventure part of the book, it’s a damn good book, so let’s just pretend that books 3 and 7 don’t exist and only reread books 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, and treat book 6 as the conclusion to the series!\n\nBiggest surprise of 2020?\n\nI’m not good at ambiguous questions like this, but from looking at how other people have answered this question, I take it to mean that it’s a book that you didn’t expect much from but were pleasantly surprised and ended up liking it more than you did. In which case, I’m going to go with The Blackthorn Key by Kevin Sands.\n\nI’ve already mentioned this in my Books I’ve Fallen In Love With During Quarantine post, but I wasn’t expecting much from this book because A) it was on the shelf at the thrift store for a good three months before I felt sorry for it and bought it, B) I mistakenly thought it had a 3.71 average rating on Goodreads (turns out I was mixing up the page number with the average rating, it’s 371 pages long with an average rating of 4.14!) and C) I hadn’t read much historical fantasy before this, and pretty much the only other MG historical fantasy I’d read up to this point was Endymion Spring by Matthew Skelton, which was a three-star read. But I liked this book way more than I thought I did–I gave it four stars and am probably going to buy a copy for a friend of mine who is a middle school teacher who is always looking for new books for her voracious reading students to enjoy, because there is no way I’m giving her my copy–I want to keep it and reread it! xD\n\nNew Favorite Author (debut or new to you)\n\nMERCEDES LACKEY MERCEDES LACKEY MERCEDES LACKEY MERCEDES LACKEY\n\nTechnically I’m still only halfway through this book, which is the first book of hers I’ve ever read, but I AM LOVING IT SO MUCH AND IT IS EVERYTHING I LOVE IN A BOOK AND IF THE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK IS THE SAME QUALITY AS THE FIRST HALF HAS BEEN IT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A FIVE STAR READ AND A NEW FAVORITE SERIES FOR ME, THIS ENTIRE SERIES AND WORLD IS AMAZING AND YOU CAN TELL SHE’S PUT SO MUCH THOUGHT INTO IT AND SHE ALSO WROTE SONGS FOR THIS STORY AND I LOVE THE SONGS AND I SHALL LINK THEM HERE AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO GO READ THIS SERIES AND LISTEN TO THESE SONGS.\n\nEntire playlist of Mercedes Lackey songs on Youtube (opens in a new tab)\n\nUnderrated Gem You’ve Discovered\n\nI just checked and this book only has 700-some ratings on Goodreads, so I feel like it’s not very well-known. Of course, I just published a blog post talking about how much I enjoyed this book, so I do feel slightly awkward bringing it up again, but… I really enjoyed Katherine by Anchee Min. Katherine is a historical fiction set in China’s Communist Revolution about a young woman (the titular Katherine) who goes to China to teach English. The story is told to us from the POV of one of Katherine’s adult students, and I may have been a bit biased in that any book about someone going to another country to teach English automatically gets bonus points in my book, but this was just a fun read in general. I’d say if you’re a historical fiction buff, or just like to nerd out about East Asian history, or want a good story about a Westerner who goes to a non-European country to teach English, this would be your book.\n\nRereads This Year?\n\nMy eternal answer whenever someone asks me which books I want to reread/which books I’ve been rereading/which books I plan to reread. So here we go, a collage of all my rereads this year, so far!\n\nOf all these rereads, I’d say two stand out the most: Magician’s Rivalry by HL Burke, which was four stars when I read it three years ago but has now jumped up to five stars upon reread, and the Abhorsen series by Garth Nix, which I devoured in the span of two days (as I usually do when rereading these books, even though each of them is a good chunker and book 2 is over 700 pages!)\n\nNewest Fictional Crush\n\nI don’t really get “crushes” on characters in books–occasionally I will get one on a TV or movie character, but I haven’t gotten any crushes on any characters (or real people for that matter) this year. So I’m just going to give a shout-out to my OG fictional crush, who will forever be my bae and I shall never stop loving him:\n\nDat smolder, tho… Oh, Legolas, you are just too darn cute!\n\nNewest Favorite Character\n\nYaichi from My Brother’s Husband.\n\nYaichi is our protagonist from My Brother’s Husband, who is a single father raising his daughter Kana. He answers the door one day to find a strange Canadian man named Mike Flannigan. Mike, who can speak some Japanese, tells Yaichi that he is Yaichi’s estranged brother Ryoji’s husband (hence the title of the book) and he came to Japan to learn more about Ryoji, who recently passed away unexpectedly. We see Yaichi come to terms with his own prejudices against gay people, develop a bond with his brother-in-law, and especially what I liked about this book, spend time with his daughter Kana. Y’all know I am trash for good father-daughter relationships in fiction, and Yaichi is such a good dad!\n\nBook that made you cry?\n\nI don’t cry very much over books, though I am very sensitive to stories about animal death (in fact, Inubaka volume 13 made me cry out all my feelz!) but there are two contenders for this spot. Both made me shed tears just a tiny teeny bit.\n\nMy Brother’s Husband volume 2\n\nThis is the last volume in this duology, and I got this as a birthday present recently and devoured it. Cried out some feelz at the end because it was over and Mike went back to Canada and they said good-bye and FAREWELLS BETWEEN FAMILY MEMBERS MAKE ME FEEL FEELINGS, AND WHEN I FEEL FEELINGS, I GET UPSET.\n\nI… don’t think I cried the first time reading this book, but during my most recent reread, I got a little choked up at the end and cried out some feels because as we’ve established before, when I feel feelings, I get upset because normally I’m an alexithymiac robot who doesn’t know feelings.\n\nBook that made you happy so far?\n\nPeter and the Starcatchers by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson. This was just a fun, high-seas adventure, reminding you that sometimes it’s okay to read a kids’ book because they’re a fun escape from the world’s bullshittery.\n\nFavorite book to film adaptation?\n\nI haven’t specifically watched any “new” adaptations, either newly released or new to me. I’ve been rewatching a bunch of stuff, so here’s some random books that I’ve read where I’ve also (re)watched the adaptation since 2020 started.\n\nThe City of Ember: The movie doesn’t have the best reviews, if you go and look at reviews of the movie, but I thought the movie was a stroke of genius that not only did justice to the story, but did some amazing cinematography at the same time.\n\nI did just recently rewatch this movie after rereading the book, and I do have to acknowledge that the first scene, when the kids are graduating and getting assigned to their jobs, was done a little better in the book. Because we can’t be privy to Lina’s internal monologue when we see her onscreen, we miss her fervent hope to get Messenger, or Greenhouse Helper, or another job that will allow her to be above the streets, and her stress and nerves about when she will finally take her turn and draw a job. There was also a good amount of page-time (two pages or so) where Lina sees all her classmates get good jobs, like greenhouse helper or timekeeper’s assistant, and this gives her courage to think that maybe there won’t be any bad jobs like mold scraper or potato peeler. But in the movie, those two or three pages of tension and suspense were boiled down to precisely one minute of screentime, and for the most part, Lina isn’t the focus of those shots, so the viewer isn’t focused on her and what she’s thinking, but merely the mechanics of the scene: the mayor going down the line of graduates and encouraging each of them as they choose their jobs.\n\n…Okay, I just realized that this is getting really long, so I’ll stop here. If y’all are interested, let me know in the comments section of this post if you’d like me to make a post comparing the book and the movie.\n\nThis was objectively a better movie than a book. After the first chapter, Susie (or rather, Susie’s spirit) just wandered around the city doing random stuff and watching her mom have sex. I’m just gonna leave that sentence there for you.\n\nThe movie threw all of that away, and instead made a proper story out of it: Susie’s obsession with discovering what happened to her, and telling her family what Mr. Harvey did, and seeking her own form of closure. This movie was a work of art, and I love it.\n\nI also would like to give a shoutout to The Lord of the Rings, which is my favorite movie adaptation of all time. I’m currently rewatching the movies and am going to reread Fellowship of the Ring in July.\n\nMost Beautiful Book You’ve Bought or Received\n\nOkay, NOW I get to talk about Clariel!\n\nThis really doesn’t do it justice, though. The actual book is twenty times more beautiful than this, with embossed Charter marks all over the dust jacket that gives a lovely sheen to the thing.\n\nThis is another book I recently discussed in another post, so click here to see my full thoughts on it!\n\nClariel is technically #4 in the Abhorsen series, but it’s a prequel, set 600 years before anything we see in Book One, and all the concepts/worldbuilding is plenty for a first-time reader to the series. Of course, if you have the ability to read the books in publication order, then yes, grab yourself a copy of Sabriel first. But if you happen upon this book at a secondhand bookstore or something and they don’t have Book One, not to worry! You can dive right into this one first, then go on to read Sabriel later.\n\nClariel is a highborn young woman who just wants to live a quiet life in the forest, but her parents have other plans for her. They’ve moved her to the big city of Belisaere, and have arranged a marriage for her to a killer. Meanwhile, the King is without a royal heir, putting more pressure on Clariel’s family, as they are of royal blood. Also in Clariel’s veins is the blood of the Abhorsens, the legendary heroes who set the dead to rest. The identity of the Abhorsen-in-Waiting is also put into question, and pretty much everyone around Clariel is expecting her to solve their problems for them. In the end, Clariel has to find her own way to get what she wants, even if that means using forbidden magic…\n\nBooks You Need To Read By the End of the Year\n\nThis year, I want to finish a bunch of series that I’ve started, such as:\n\nDragon Rider by Cornelia Funke\n\nThe Abhorsen series by Garth Nix\n\nSpellsmith and Carver by HL Burke\n\nThe Raven Cycle by Maggie Stiefvater\n\nHis Dark Materials by Phillip Pullman\n\nOrange by Ichigo Takano\n\nThe Books of Ember b Jeanne DuPrau\n\nHopefully I finish all of these by the end of the year, and most of the above listed series only have one more book before I finish them anyway, so let’s see how I do!\n\nFavorite post you have done this year\n\nI DON’T KNOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A FAVORITE POST I LIKE ALL OF THEM EQUALLY BUT HERE’S A SHOUTOUT TO MY READATHON GO PARTICIPATE\n\nLord of the Readathon Announcement!\n\nFavorite book community members\n\nSHOUTOUT TO MY GIRLS ARI AND AV GO CHECK OUT THEIR AWESOME BLOGS DOWN BELOW!\n\nAri @ Bookish Valhalla\n\nAvhlee @ Teacups and Torn Pages\n\nAlso shoutout to my favorite Booktuber of all time, Codie’s Book Corner!\n\nCodie’s Book Corner: Wheel of TBR May 2020\n\nCodie is adorbs, and funny, and her Wheel of TBR videos inspired me to create my own TBR game, Lord of the TBR, which you can view here:\n\nLord of the TBR: June 2020 via The Discerning Reader on Youtube\n\nAnd that is it!
