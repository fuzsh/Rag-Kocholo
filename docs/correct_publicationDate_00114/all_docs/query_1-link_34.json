        "text": "\"The Adventures of King Midas\" by Lynne Reid Banks - a fun children's book, a fairytale feel retelling of the story. King Midas would be quite comfortable in his cosy little kingdom with his young daughter, except he has this character flaw - well, he has several actually, but, one of the more prominent is his craving for.... of course... gold. He'd like everything to be gold - or so he thinks. Until a magician gives him the \"gift\" of turning everything he touches with his hands into gold. At first he is as happy as can be, and then he turns a rose into gold... and a bird... and his food... and then his dog - by this time he has certainly started to realise that the \"gift\" is more of a \"curse\", but the dog comes on him unawares from under the table and puts his head under Midas' hand... and then his daughter.... who comes to tend to him while he is asleep, and he wakes up to discover her all made into gold. And he must set out to undo what he has caused, and encounters many adventures. And there is a dragon. And a cat. Not a talking cat, but the dragon can talk cat. Dragons and cats make everything better. Anyway, I enjoyed this far more than her more famous \"The Indian in the Cupboard\".\n\nJ K Rowling: \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" - 6 down, one to go. Usually I prefer to read the books before I see the adaptation, but in this case the reverse has actually worked really well for me. Beginning from \"the Prisoner of Azkaban\", it has been fun discovering \"new\" (to me) stuff that didn't make it into the books - I could imagine it could have been annoying the other way around, waiting for scenes that never happen in the movies. Especially in \"Azkaban\", I think - Crookshanks! my favourite character in that book. I'd be sitting there going \"Where is Crookshanks? Why isn't there more Crookshanks?\" As it was it was a great fun discovery/surprise in the book. (Come to think, he could have been utilised more post the 3rd book as well - he has been pretty much missing in in/action since, hasn't he?) Anyway, really enjoyed the book - though Dumbledore - I found it more affecting in the book than I did in the movie. I hope to get to the 7th book some time next year and am both looking forward to and dreading those scenes with my favourite movie character - Snape...\n\nJ K Rowling: \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" - 6 down, one to go.

I hope to get to the 7th book some time next year and am both looking forward to and dreading those scenes with my favourite movie character - Snape...\n\nI found Harry Potter series just last year 2014 (of course I had heard of them but not read) as my daughter began reading them. Then she wanted to see the movies and we began watching them together. Then I became interested in the books and began reading them. My first one was the fourth book The Goblet of Fire. Sometimes I watched the movie first, sometimes I read the book first. I liked both even though books are much better describing so many details. I read the books two times each and my daughter read them 4 or 5 times. Very good that there are so many pages in those books.\n\nThere are many things I like in these books. The study of magic in the Hogwarts is not one of them except the defence against the dark arts. I love humour in these books (is it rare in fantasy books? I have not read many fantasy books) and the beginnings. Harry is always with the Dursleys in the beginning but it is always different and he gets to Hogwarts always in different ways. I like how the story is partly in the real world. That makes it feel more real and is fascinating. When I read them second time some things did not bother so much. I did not like the sixth book first as much as others but when I read it second time all these relationships things did not bother me any more and liked the book more. I read the books in Finnish. The Finnish translator translated some names, not all. I like it a lot. She translated Severus Snape as Severus Kalkaros. Rattlesnake is in Finnish kalkkarokäärme. So if a snake comes to mind from Snape, Kalkaros does the some for Finnish readers. Snape has not the same effect for me at least.\n\nYou have interesting days ahead as you will read the 7th book. It is different. I liked the last battlescene in the book much more than in the movie.\n\nI just finished John Stephens The Emerald Atlas and try to get the next one The Fire Cronicle soon. I liked the Emerald Atlas but compared to Harry Potter it is so serious."
