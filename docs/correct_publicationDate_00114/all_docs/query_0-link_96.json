        "text": "Product Description\n\nMust-have short story collection by Garth Nix, containing thirteen stories all introduced by the author himself.\n\nACROSS THE WALL brings together an eclectic mix of Garth Nix's writing spanning several years.\n\nThe opening story is the 2005 World Book Day novella and Old Kingdom story NICHOLAS SAYRE AND THE CREATURE IN THE CASE, winner of two prestigious Aurealis Awards.\n\nThe rest of the collection includes two tales inspired by Arthurian legend, a war story, a western, a traditional tale with a twist and a hilarious choose-your-own-adventure spoof.\n\nThe volume is introduced by the author himself and, even better, so is each story - giving context, anecdotes and a generous dollop of Nix's own wry humour.\n\nPlus! A final bonus section of frequently asked questions for which Garth Nix supplies vital answers.\n\nAll of our books are second hand, and while you may not get the exact copy shown in the picture, all of our books are in very good condition. Removing stickers from a book may damage it, so we refrain from doing so. If you see a price sticker on a book, please ignore it."
