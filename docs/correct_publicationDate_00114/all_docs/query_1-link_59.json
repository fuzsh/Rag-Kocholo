        "text": "Title: A Dance With Dragons\n\nAuthor: George R. R. Martin\n\nPublishing Information: July 12, 2011 by Bantam\n\nGenre: Adult, Epic Fantasy\n\nSeries information: Book 5 in A Song of Ice and Fire\n\nFormat: Kindle, 1016 pages\n\nSource: Bought for my personal library\n\nRecommended For: Anyone who enjoys fantasy. Seriously. Read this series.\n\nI made it! I read all 5 of the published books in A Song of Ice and Fire series! I FEEL SO ACCOMPLISHED!! Not only did I read them all (that‚Äôs around 5,000 pages) in TEN MONTHS! All while reading other books, working full time‚Ä¶and ya know LIVING LIFE! Also‚Ä¶I got a bit behind during Christmas, but I was determined. I made A Dance With Dragons my LAST READ OF THE YEAR and I literally read 57% of the book in five days. FIVE. *collapses* I feel accomplished, sure, but I also have quite the epic book hangover, and I miss those characters that were such a huge part of my life for almost a full year! Let‚Äôs get into the quickie review (no spoilers!)\n\nI had a lot of feels over this book‚Ä¶here are some of my updates via Goodreads:\n\nSo, as you can see I had many emotions while reading this one. I didn‚Äôt love Stannis, to be honest, he is kind of a jerk and I just want him to lighten up a bit. The Reek bits broke my heart to pieces, I was rooting for him throughout which was quite a change in perception for me. We didn‚Äôt see much of Cersei but for someone so ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù she does know how to play her part well to get what she wants, I respect that! We got to see a lot of Jon Snow in this one and his struggles with his vows and his love for his family, it was really quite tragic and heartfelt.\n\nThere were many parts of A Dance With Dragons that shocked me. For the most part these moments were not like the other books where something comes out of the blue (except at the end, which we will get to) but a lot of intrigue and things that came together from the other books that really surprised me. I am unsure how to feel about Dany‚Äôs part in A Dance With Dragons, I love her but I am not sure that she is moving forward in the best way for her cause. Arya‚Äôs plot is coming along nicely, I am actually very invested where she is going, as well as Bran‚Äôs ‚Äì which surprised me as prior to this novel they were falling a bit flat for me. There was a part (as you can see from above, it is near the end) that really gave me some feels. George R.R. Martin leaves the readers with quite an epic cliff hanger and honestly I went through so many stages of emotion. I was first SHOCKED and UPSET that this thing potentially happens..and then I was ANGRY. So angry. Honestly, who does this guy think he is? Just leaving his readers stranded at the edge like this with no end and answer in sight? Looking back I am still pretty angry and I think that is helping me cope with the potential devastation that will come if the THING that maybe happened actually happens.\n\nAll of that being said, I can‚Äôt WAIT for the next book (I see what you‚Äôre doing there, GRRM) and I am left with an epic book hangover that can only be cured by endless hours on forums dedicated to A Song of Ice and Fire.\n\n‚ÄúWomen do not forget. Women do not forgive.‚Äù\n\nI haven‚Äôt done a Book Hoarders post in a while so I thought to close out the year I would do a little survey like I did last year and focus on some of my favorite personal literary moments of the year! Sorry in advance..it‚Äôs link and picture heavy üôÇ\n\nBook that reminded me that I love to read: The Sandman series did this for me. The graphic novels are so different from anything that I have ever read and I found myself enamored at the inclusions of different character from history popping up into stories. It really made me think and remember what knowledge I had of these historical figures, or superheroes, etc. and that made me love it even more.\n\nFavorite BAMF: I think Daenerys takes the cake for this one. She is so incredibly young but so fierce. I love her so much. Especially when she says things like ‚ÄúDracarys!‚Äù\n\nFavorite companion: Ravens! Though not technically ‚Äúfantastical‚Äù by nature but some of the ones I read of this year were pretty amazing. Matthew, from The Sandman series and Fiacha from my (ahem 4th? 5th? re-read) of Son of the Shadows by Juliet Marillier is one of my favorite companions, EVER.\n\nFavorite debut author: For sure Cat Winters, the author of In the Shadow of Blackbirds. The book was absolutely fantastic and heartwrenching. Ms. Winters was so gracious and lovely after I reached out to her upon finishing the novel, and she moved quickly to the top of my auto-buy authors.\n\nBFF: Hands down Sybella from Dark Triumph. She was so dark and brave throughout the novel, I couldn‚Äôt help but love her. Truly, some of my closest friends describe her as my ‚Äúspirit animal,‚Äù and I can‚Äôt wait to see what she and the other ladies get in to in Mortal Heart.\n\nMost swoon-worthy lad: Okay, I am doing it, I‚Äôm cheating. I tried to look elsewhere but the title of most swoon-worthy lad goes to Captain Carswell Thorne, hands down. I can not tell you how many pictures I took of his lines and how many flailing texts were sent to my friends while reading Cress. He has made my top 5 of best swoons EVER, and that is saying A LOT.\n\nFavorite pick found while perusing: Dragon‚Äôs Bait by Vivian Vande Velde. I was handed this by a bookseller at The Book Barn because she noticed that I like Patricia C. Wrede and assured me that this title was a readalike. I was pleasantly surprised over the nostalgia, I obviously also loved the strength in the main lady and the swoons in the main dragon!\n\nFantastical creatures: Not sure if he counts but, Death personified! He was breathtaking in Keturah and Lord Death and I look forward to reading more novels with him in the center!\n\nThat bad boy you shouldn‚Äôt love, but‚Ä¶: UMM hello? THE DARKLING 4EVA. I love, love, LOVE him so very much‚Ä¶from his quartz like eyes to his brooding demeanor. I just picture him controlling darkness and I get all ‚Äúhumina humina‚Äù to MAH BONES. *swoons* Honorable mention goes to Morpheus from Splintered by A.G. Howard\n\nFavorite male lead: KVOTHE. Ohhhh Kvothe‚Ä¶I spent so much time with him this year (umm..over 50 hours of audio ‚Äì which reminds me, OH HAI, Nick Podehl <3) and my heart sang and broke for him at times. He is so interesting and witty and hello, he‚Äôs a ginger, how can I not love him so?!\n\nFavorite female lead: Eleanor, from Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell. For the good and the bad, she reminded me of me when I was in high school.\n\nBest summary in less than ten words: Scary vampires in an Amish setting. (Thanks, Ame!)\n\nA return to an old favorite (title, genre, etc.): WOO! ROBIN HOOD, BABY!! I chose Robin Hood as my focus for our Classics Retold event and I am so glad that I was able to go back to the story that I love in Hood by Stephen Lawhead. I am excited to read book 2 and 3 in the series as soon as possible!\n\nSo glad I judged by it‚Äôs cover: In the Shadow of Blackbirds by Cat Winters. The piercing gaze of the girl on the front and the ethereal being behind her, I had to have this book. I am so glad that I jumped to request this from Netgalley upon seeing it because it was one of my favorite reads of the year.\n\nBroke my Heart: The Fables installments from this year really got to me. I have become WAY too invested in the characters and have fallen in love with the story, I love these graphic novels so much but boy did they crack my heart a little. Let‚Äôs not even get started on A Song of Ice and Fire‚Ä¶\n\nHeightened by the narrator: For sure A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket narrated by Tim Curry is first in my mind when thinking of narrators who make the series for me. I started reading this series years and years ago and never finished because as I grew older I had a hard time making it through these novels in print. However, the audiobooks are absolutely stellar. The parts that I tended to read over because of annoyance or lack of interest, sprouted from my speakers and made me smile and laugh out loud.\n\nGave me the creeps (which I love): The Ghost of Graylock by Dan Poblocki, I sincerely hope that this author starts writing adult horror because he is FANTASTIC.\n\nIt‚Äôs in the words..: The Woodcutter by Kate Danley was so lyrical and beautiful that I found myself bookmarking every few pages. It was a simple, yet gorgeous read.\n\nBiggest disappointment: Hmm probably Towering by Alex Flinn. I have heard a lot of good things about this author and it might have just been a wrong book, wrong time sort of thing but I did not enjoy this novel AT ALL.\n\nWorth the hype: Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell. First, I was lucky enough to meet Rainbow at BEA this year and she was so fantastic, she also has great hair. Second, I am not a contemporary reader, and the sickly sweet romances are not usually my thing‚Ä¶HOWEVER Eleanor and Park was recommended to me by so many people that I trust and I fell so deeply in love with it, I immediately added all of Rowell‚Äôs books to my TBR. Never has hand holding been so romantic.\n\nNewest addiction: Audiobooks!! As some of you may know, I am incredibly picky when it comes to audiobook narrators. Jim Dale is an obvious love and I fell into loving Neil Gaiman as soon as I heard his free audiobook Click, Clack, the Rattlebag but I had a hard time finding someone else to enjoy. I seem to have a problem with the jarring tone of a female narrator and and I felt sort of lost for a while until Heidi and Amy convinced me to try Nick Podehl, the narrator of The Kingkiller Chronicles. Well WOO BOY am I happy that I gave him a listen! over 50 hours of audiobook later and I am IN LOVE! I was also lucky enough to find some audiobooks narrated by Tim Curry, The Series of Unfortunate Events and a lovely version of Dracula, while perusing!\n\nFavorite villain: Krampus wins this one, I think, though I don‚Äôt know for sure that he is considered a villain despite his ‚Äúevil‚Äù ways. This novel by Brom is absolutely enthralling, I read it almost a year ago and I still can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.\n\nFavorite laugh out loud moment: Like last year, I have to go with a Duncan moment from the second installment of The League of Princes: The Hero‚Äôs Guide to Storming the Castle. ‚ÄúOh, I disagree,‚Äù Duncan added. ‚ÄúIt makes me think of cow-owls. And those are horrifying. MOO-WHO! MOO-WHO!‚Äù This series is honestly fantastic and I can‚Äôt wait for book three!! Honorable mention goes to the final installment of A Tale Dark and Grimm: The Grimm Conclusion by Adam Gidwitz, this one had me laughing out loud as well!\n\nThe kissy bits: WOO Shadow & Bone had some yummy moments, as did Dark Triumph by LaFevers, Splintered by Howard, and Eleanor and Park had some epic hand holding (also CRESS because seriously..*faints*) Seriously, you guys‚Ä¶*FANS SELF*\n\nBiggest ugly cry moment: Ya know, I didn‚Äôt really have any ugly cry moments this year..I don‚Äôt usually read those kinds of books so I somehow missed out. I did, however, tear up a few times while reading Code Name Verity and Rose Under Fire by Elizabeth Wein. They were both lovely books, though I did not love them or get as attached as other readers.\n\nFavorite new to me genre/book: Historical fiction! Between In the Shadow of Blackbirds, and The Caged Graves, I quickly jumped on the historical fiction bandwagon and asked Hannah and April for some suggestions. Needless to say, my TBR pile grew a lot and I am excited to move into some non Tudor England historical reads!\n\nMind. Blown.: Man, I feel sorry that I can‚Äôt explain myself better here but‚Ä¶that THING that happens in A Storm of Swords (and it‚Äôs not the thing you think)..yeah, I did NOT see that coming. I am so thrilled that I read this series, I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how worth it it is to take on the epicness that is A Song of Ice and Fire.\n\nThank you, Netgalley!: Splintered by A.G. Howard was a titled that I found on a whim while looking through Netgalley. The cover was gorgeous and the synopsis sounded awesome ‚Äì a twisted fairytale, Alice in Wonderland meets Tim Burton in novel form? Sign me up! The world was vivid and the swoons were aplenty.\n\nNon-bookish THINGS that I loved in 2013:\n\nLOKI: Now, you all know that I love the villains SO MUCH and Loki isn‚Äôt really NEW on my radar since I have read and LOVED Norse mythology for as long as I can remember, but I started working hardcore on my WIP this year and‚Ä¶well..there are some Loki like bits in there. That got me delving more into his character, which only made me love him more. Also look how cute my new shirt is‚Ä¶\n\nGame of Thrones: Again, not so new, but some of you may know that I participated in a Song of Ice and Fire Read Along this year and though it was very time consuming‚Ä¶it was AWESOME. Honestly, it is totally worth it, the series is so epic and you just fall so into the world, I definitely recommend giving it a go.\n\nNeil Gaiman: Okay, I may have mentioned him a time or‚Ä¶five..but I was lucky enough to see Neil Gaiman THREE TIMES this year, and I MET HIM FACE TO FACE a few months ago and it was just a once in a lifetime experience. He is so amazing and gracious, and genius. Also his wife, she is pretty fantastic as well. No words.\n\nLiterary Lushes: I started a second website with my best friend Brittany (The Book Addict‚Äôs Guide) which focuses on ARC tours and Twitter chats. It has been such a great experience working with someone that I love and it has really opened me up to new bloggers and experiences which makes me incredibly happy!\n\nGoing forward I would like to introduce some new fun features on the blog ‚Äì (including a new review feature!) and obviously share some wonderful reviews with you all! What about you guys, what can you tell me about your favorite literary moments of the year? I look forward to seeing you all in 2014!! As always, thanks for reading!\n\nTitle: The Hallowed Ones\n\nAuthor: Laura Bickle\n\nPublishing Information: September 25, 2012 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt\n\nGenre: Young Adult, Paranormal, Vampires, Dystopia\n\nSeries information: First in a series\n\nFormat: Paperback, 320 pages\n\nSource: Borrowed from Amy (Tripping Over Books)\n\nRecommended For: Fans of a very different kind of vampire tale.\n\nKatie is on the verge of her Rumspringa, the time in Amish life when teenagers can get a taste of the real world. But the real world comes to her in this dystopian tale with a philosophical bent. Rumors of massive unrest on the ‚ÄúOutside‚Äù abound. Something murderous is out there. Amish elders make a rule: No one goes outside, and no outsiders come in. But when Katie finds a gravely injured young man, she can‚Äôt leave him to die. She smuggles him into her family‚Äôs barn‚Äîat what cost to her community? The suspense of this vividly told, truly horrific thriller will keep the pages turning (Via Goodreads).\n\nWhen Amy first told me about this book I was skeptical. Amish‚Ä¶and vampires? I am over the vampire thing and‚Ä¶well, the Amish community doesn‚Äôt really do it for me. She ensured that I would love it and that it wasn‚Äôt THAT kind of vampire story so I gave it a go, and you guys, she was right. The Hallowed Ones was in a word, surprising. The plot was incredibly engaging and the atmosphere was just perfect. I didn‚Äôt really fall into the ‚Äúhorror‚Äù of the novel, but I have a very high threshold. I did enjoy seeing the vampires as monsters and not humanized characters, it was really different from the norm and kept me on my toes.\n\nThe characters in The Hallowed Ones were all fantastic. I really enjoyed Katie and her rebellious yet not too rebellious ways. I found her to be believable and engaging, she didn‚Äôt rebel against the restrictions of her society for anything less than what she believed was right. In other words, she wasn‚Äôt the typical teenager who rebelled against limitations because WHY NOT, but she rebelled because she knew that letting someone die for their differences wasn‚Äôt right, and following your heart is sometimes just as important as following your head. Katie‚Äôs parents were a tad infuriating to me but I especially enjoyed Ginger, the ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù who was forced to remain in the Amish community after the ‚Äúattacks‚Äù started. Elijah annoyed me, he was a tool and I didn‚Äôt like how he treated Katie, he clearly knew little about her despite spending his entire life by her side. Then there is Alex‚Ä¶wooo boy did I love him. Alex is another ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù and boy does he turn Katie‚Äôs world upside down. Also, he has mythical tattoos that are yummy in my mind‚Äôs eye and also protect him from the bad things. Also, I can‚Äôt talk about characters without mentioning the Hexenmeister. That‚Äôs right, this book has it‚Äôs very own Hexenmeister. How awesome is that?! I loved this guy, I pictured him like an angry hermit who screams at kids to GIT OFF HIS LAWN but then also teaches them life lessons and how to shoot a shotgun. Kind of like Rafiki‚Ä¶but human and maybe kind of magical.\n\nYou guys I have to be honest, the blind faith thing? I can‚Äôt abide it. It really grinds my gears and makes me want to shake my fist and scream like an Amazonian woman. It is safe to say that I am not in the majority here but going into this book I was prepared to feel the rage over the limitations and blind following of the society presented. You know what though? I wasn‚Äôt rage filled (for the most part) and I really enjoyed the way Laura Bickle represented the Amish society. I grew up in a very small town in Pennsylvania, and I have some experience with this sort of lifestyle so it was really fun to read about it and see the connections. The ‚ÄúElders‚Äù pushed my buttons a little bit, but they were supposed to and I found my inner rebel (LOL she isn‚Äôt buried too deeply) screaming at them a time or two. The thing that really got to me about this novel though was the idea that hallowed ground is what kept certain people safe. All hallowed ground. That means that the Catholics in their church? SAFE. The Wiccans holed up in their sacred space? SAFE. The Amish in their community? ALSO SAFE. It really made me feel good to see this universal message of ‚ÄúWhat you believe, you become,‚Äù and support of faith and not just ONE FAITH.\n\nThe Hallowed Ones was a captivating read, I didn‚Äôt expect any of the big reveals, which is always a win for me. Laura Bickle has a knack for character and atmosphere development and I absolutely cannot wait to pick up the sequel;, The Outside, as soon as possible. For those of you looking for something that stands out in the young adult, paranormal genre, pick up The Hallowed Ones immediately. It had everything I needed, all of the best things, shock, mystery, and a delicious splash of romance."
