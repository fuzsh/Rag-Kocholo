        "text": "Something that Garth Nix says is destined to be a classic and written by Kiran Millwood Hargrave? Yes please!\n\nFor anyone who says that Middle Grade books are only for children, you haven't read Kiran Millwood Hargrave's books, complex worlds, interesting stories, sometimes difficult weighty topics (Julia and the Shark), some of her work are just masterpieces.\n\nIn The Shadow of the Wolf Queen didn't pack the punch of Julia and the Shark, but this is book one of a trilogy and a great start for middle grade readers starting to read longer narratives and slower-paced books while still with a sense of the adventure/quest story. The writing does not shy away from violence or death, there are some skirmishes and threats that have consequences, but nothing that feels gratuitous or overly detailed, just that, in a world where there is a tyrant queen, enemies, fear, and fighting, be aware that this is depicted on-page on occasion.\n\nThe world building and vivid writing is what makes this book for me. As a UK reader, I recognised the origins of the placenames and the real-world geography and mythologies that the story is rooted in and that made the story, or especially, the landscape within it, come alive for me: it felt rooted, ancient, and ancestral much like some of the work of Alan Garner, Philip Pullman, and some of Garth Nix's own inspirations. It also made me want to find out more about the places mentioned, explore my own country, and I would hope that adults sharing these books with children might also use it as a stepping stone to connecting the stories with the landscape too.\n\nThe first book seems to set up relationships and journeys, rather than having a conclusion in itself, so this can't be read as a standalone, I was a little disappointed that the first book felt like it ended just as things were starting to get somewhere, but what we have is a great start to what I hope will be a treasured trilogy, and in the meantime, I will be reading more of Kiran's work.\n\nIn the story of the book, we follow Ysolda's adventures as she searches for her missing sister, Hari, and at the same time we come across many different animals and their different relationship with humans, which was very interesting to me. Ysolda lived her life in the shadow of the wolf queen's tyrannical rule until one day a mysterious earthquake shakes the land and she is forced to strike a bargain with the wolf queen herself, she soon finds herself embroiled in a quest for a magic more powerful - and more dangerous - than she could ever have imagined.\n\nI really love Hargrave's writing. In every book the description of the world and characters are so real and exciting. What impressed me here was the beautiful description of the lands, the animals and the people with their traditions . This is a beautifully immersive story that makes the setting and world-building really tangible.\n\nI've always liked books where there are related characters and animals and here we have our hero Ysolda with her loyal hawk Nara. The story in the book is very interesting, and the development of the mc is amazing. But the only thing I didn't like was that at times there were too real descriptions of animals either in pain or unfortunately died. It was pretty hard for me to read it...\n\nAfter all I really enjoyed the book and can't wait for the next one.\n\nStory : üåüüåüüåüüåü\n\nEnjoyment level : ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®\n\nPlot: ‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è\n\n#netgalleyarcs #netgalleyreads #netgalleyarc #intheshadowofthewolfqueen\n\nIn the Shadow of the Wolf Queen is the first adventure in an epic new fantasy, the Geomancer trilogy, and what a stunning start it is! I was completely captivated by this all-encompassing story in a world where nature fights back, where elemental magic lives and where a sister‚Äôs love ignites an incredible adventure.\n\nYsolda is in her beloved Glaw Wood with her loyal sea hawk, Nara, trying to use her sister‚Äôs amulet to listen to the trees, a gift her sister Hari has, but one which evades Ysolda. When Nara is captured by a stranger, Ysolda follows and is saved from sinking into a bog by the stranger who is wearing the uniform of one of the fierce wolf queen‚Äôs guards. Running home, Ysolda discovers that the fierce wolf queen has sent her Ryders to the Glaw Wood to take its gifted. In the wake of a terrible earthquake that destroys her home, and sees her sister taken by the Ryders, Ysolda determines to rescue her.\n\nHer determination to save her sister brings her to make a bargain with the wolf queen which leads her on an epic quest filled with danger, discovery and daring. Could there be truth in the myth that the queen is hunting? Is there hope for a world in which queens and thanes fight for the power to control earth-magic? And, what happens when nature decides to fight back against those who would destroy if for their own ends?\n\nThis is a thrilling, action-packed adventure with incredible world-building that kept me turning pages as I was gripped by Ysolda‚Äôs quest and eager to find the truth of the myth. Danger and tension build perfectly side-by-side with beautifully lyrical, atmospheric writing.\n\nYsolda is a wonderfully strong and courageous girl who puts herself in great danger to save her sister. She understands the need to respect nature and to live in harmony with it. She has a gorgeous bond with her sea hawk, Nara, who is never far from her when needed.\n\nI found the wolf queen a fascinating and complex character and am really looking forward to finding out more about her and the goal she is prepared to do anything for, including sacrificing others, in order to achieve.\n\nThis really is an unmissable start to an enchanting, epic fantasy adventure. The ending has really made me eager to continue Ysolda‚Äôs quest to save her sister -and the world!\n\nI have long been a fan of Hargrave's adult fiction: The Dance Tree and The Mercies are perfection but this is the first of her children's fiction I have read so the rest of the coming trilogy is now highly anticipated.\n\nIn the Shadow of the Wolf Queen tells the story of Ysolda and her hawk Nara who meet a strange girl in the trees. Ysolda is trying to listen like her sister Hari with her amulet. When an earthquake shakes her community, she discovers her sister is missing and has been taken by Ryders. She follows the trail to the Wolf Queen and uses her intellect to help her achieve her goal.\n\nI loved the world building in this, which felt very simplistic and lovely, no need for lots of description but also would be great for a first foray into fantasy for any young person. Ysolda is clever but has such a love for her sister, she is a lovely character that many would warm to.\n\nA beautiful fantasy for children which leads to an exploration of those deeper questions of good versus evil; nature versus creation as well what really is worthwhile pursuing.\n\nAnything that Kiran Millwood Hargrave writes goes straight onto our TBR pile and so, when the opportunity to review the first in her new fantasy series came up via NetGalley, I couldn't resist. Following on from The Girl of Ink and Stars and The Way Past Winter, this is a fantasy adventure centred around a journey through unknown lands...\n\nYsolda lives in a forest that borders the Wolf Queen's territory - a tyrannical ruler whose reputation precedes her. But when the safe haven of the forest is shattered by an earthquake and Ysolda realises the queen's ryders have taken her beloved sister, she sets out on a quest to save her. But nothing is ever that simple! Soon Ysolda finds herself forced to make a deal with the Wolf Queen herself, accompanying her on her quest for a terrifying and unimaginable power.\n\nPacked full of lyrical and beautifully descriptive language, Kiran Millwood Hargrave weaves a captivating story with strong ecological themes, driven by sisterly love. For the most part, Ysolda is a solo protagonist, comforted by the presence of her loyal sea hawk, Nara, although the power of the earth feels like a character in itself. From mountains to forests to coastal caves and ancient islands, the storytelling feels as timeless as the landscape, each chapter reverberating with a deep, rumbling power which both soothes and disturbs and which leaves an echoing impact long after you've finished reading.\n\nAside from Ysolda, however, there's some great characters that give the story its heart and depth; tender Hari, heart-wrenching Sami, the mysterious general, bold and mischievous Eira and Seren, the ruthless Wolf Queen. I loved that we saw the Wolf Queen up close from early on in the novel - a strong, intriguing presence rather than a distant threat who reminded me of a more complex White Witch. Her relationship with the sea wolves, who I absolutely loved, raises a lot of questions about her character, drawing the reader under her spell. Then there's the brutal Thane Boreal, who provides some of the harder-hitting scenes of the novel. This is not an adventure for the faint-hearted!\n\nKiran Millwood Hargrave builds a lot of suspense and intrigue in this first instalment, setting the tone for the future books in the series. There's some seeding of the geomancer concept and murmurings of an ancient power, with the unspoken promise that the full darkness of this world is still yet to unfold. Then there's the lies Ysolda has spun to stay alive and to ensure her sister's safety. This feels like the beginning of something intoxicating and enthralling...and I am already enchanted.\n\nI've literally just finished this....I'm shocked that it finished, that it left the story at this point....\n\nThe description throughout this story would make it an amazing book to use through English but as a class novel just to read - with no \"strings\" it will be utterly amazing too.\n\nYsolda is a young girl from Glaw Wood, with seemingly no gift. Unlike her sister, Hari, who can hear the trees, even when the wood is used she can still hear them speaking. So unlike everyone else in Glaw Wood they live in a stone house at the top of a hill. When we meet her Ysolda has taken Hari's amulet to try to hear the trees talk. But she can't. Her Sea hawk, Nara, is by her side when suddenly she chases something - but too late Ysolda realises it's a trap. She chases after Nara, missing the sign and landing in a bog. When she is rescued by a young boy - who is actually a girl - she is not impressed. The girl wants to eat Nara! Ysolda manages to get the girls spear and free her hawk. Ysolda leaves the girl and runs home, but the normally open house of Gwyn and Gwen is all shut up, somethings wrong. At the next house Fyona pulls her inside. There are Ryders on their land, Ryders that are headed toward Ysolda and Hari's house. Ysolda leaves the house despite Fyona's insistence, then the land moves an earthquake. When Ysolda is able to get up the house is gone - disappeared inside a chasm that has opened up. Where is Hari?\n\nBut she isn't the only one looking for Hari - just as she's looking into teh chasm the girl turns up. But when she knows the riders got there first she says they will have Hari; she hasn't died. She tells the girl that because she has the amulet Hari didn't hear them.\n\nThe girl explains that she wanted to warn Hari, that the Wolf Queen, Seren, wants to take her. Seren is looking for the End-World Wood. But doesn't know where it is. The girl draws a map but Ysolda tells her that the direction they are looking in is wrong. But Ysolda wants to go to save Hari not the direction teh girl wants to go.\n\nWe follow Ysolda's journey to the castle of the Wolf Queen and to her sister Hari, at least for a while. But then is the biggest adventure of Ysolda's life. She is to be the navigator for the Queen. But The Forgiver (a seer that the Queen believes) says it won't be easy. And she gives Ysolda a HagStone that she says will help.\n\nThe journey is amazing. The description of the lands, the people and their traditions, foods and animals is just beautiful. I did not want this book to end and certainly not at that point!\n\nBuy it, read it, read it to children.....and wait for book 2! VERY IMPATIENTLY!\n\nYsolda has always lived in the Glaw Wood, with stories of the world outside of it and the tyrannical wolf queen. One day, when in the woods with her hawk Nara she is saved by a strange girl and at the same time the Ryders come to her village.\n\nThe Ryders come at the Queens behest and take people with gifts... one of these is Ysoldas sister, Hari. Also at this time, a strange earthquake shakes up her home land.\n\nNara wants to save her sister but what deals will she have to make with the Queen to save them both\n\nIn trade for her sisters freedom, Ysolda ends up on a quest, trying to find something she isn't sure even really exists. Can she make it out and also save the people she loves....\n\nThis is the the start of a trilogy and feels very much like that. I thoroughly enjoyed the journey and was left wanting more when the book ended.\n\nCan't wait to see where this series goes and thank you to NetGalley and Hachette/Orion Books for the chance to read and review this book before release\n\nA magical adventure from start to finish, packed full of action, myths, legends and Earth magic. I adored the power of nature in this book and how this is woven so tightly through this first book in what is sure to be an epic trilogy from Kiran Millwood Hargrove.\n\nThe world is brought to life on the page with vivid descriptions and characters to love, loathe and root for. I loved the relationships and respect between animals and humans from Nara the sea hawk to the many wolves. There were definitely a few tear jerking moments too!\n\nYsolda is a wonderful protagonist: ambitious, determined and loving. I also really liked many of the side characters and hope we‚Äôll see more of Eira and Hari in future instalments!\n\nThe Welsh person in me does also need to say how much I enjoyed there (unexpectedly) being so many Welsh links to names and vocabulary in this book too - things like this always make my heart sing!\n\nFast-paced and magical from beginning to end, I loved this new adventure and can‚Äôt wait to see what will happen next!\n\nThank you to Hachette, Kiran Millwood Hargrave and NetGalley for my early review copy in exchange of a fair and honest review."
