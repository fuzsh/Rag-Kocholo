        "text": "About the Author[]\n\nOther Names: other pen names or real name or both\n\nGenres: Young Adult Fantasy, Children's Fiction, Epic Fantasy, Necromancy\n\nWriting Style:\n\nBooks: Garth Nix Books\n\nBiography[]\n\nGarth Nix was born in 1963 in Melbourne, Australia, to the sound of the Salvation Army band outside playing 'Hail the Conquering Hero Comes' or possibly 'Roll Out the Barrel'. Garth left Melbourne at an early age for Canberra (the federal capital) and stayed there till he was nineteen, when he left to drive around the UK in a beat-up Austin with a trunk full of books and a Silver-Reed typewriter.\n\nDespite a wheel literally falling off the Austin, Garth survived to return to Australia and study at the University of Canberra. After finishing his degree in 1986 he worked in a bookshop, then as a book publicist, a publisher's sales representative, and editor. Along the way he was also a part-time soldier in the Australian Army Reserve, serving in an Assault Pioneer platoon for four years. Garth left publishing to work as a public relations and marketing consultant from 1994-1997, till he became a full-time writer in 1998. He did that for a year before becoming a part-time literary agent in 1999. In January 2002 Garth went back to writing full time again, despite his belief that full-time writing explains the strange behaviour of many authors.\n\nGarth currently lives in a beach suburb of Sydney, with his wife Anna, a publisher.[1]\n\nSeries[]\n\nOld Kingdom series[]\n\nGenres:Epic Fantasy, Necromancy\n\nTheme:\n\nSeries list:\n\nSabriel (Old Kingdom Book 1) (1996)\n\nLirael (Old Kingdom Book 2) (2001)\n\nAbhorsen (Old Kingdom Book 3) (2003)\n\nThe Creature in the Case (Old Kingdom 3.5) (2005)\n\nClariel (Old Kingdom Book 4) (2014)\n\nGoldenhand (Old Kingdom Book 5)(2016)\n\nTerciel and Elinor (Old Kingdom Book 0) (2021) - Prequel\n\nTo Hold the Bridge (2015)\n\nSeventh Tower[]\n\nGenres: Children's, Magical Adventure series\n\nTheme:\n\nSeries list:\n\nThe Fall (Seventh Tower Book 1) (2000)\n\nCastle (Seventh Tower Book 2) (2000)\n\nAenir (Seventh Tower Book 3) (2001)\n\nAbove The Veil (Seventh Tower Book 4) (2000)\n\nInto Battle (Seventh Tower Book 5) (2000)\n\nThe Violet Keystone (Seventh Tower Book 6) (2001)\n\nThe Keys to the Kingdom series[]\n\nGenres: YA, Children's, Magical Adventure series\n\nTheme: 7 days, 7 keys, 7 virtues. 7 sins.\n\nSeries list:\n\nMister Monday (The Keys to the Kingdom Book 1) (2003)\n\nGrim Tuesday (The Keys to the Kingdom Book 2) (2004)\n\nDrowned Wednesday (The Keys to the Kingdom Book 3) (2005)\n\nSir Thursday (The Keys to the Kingdom Book 4) (2006)\n\nLady Friday (The Keys to the Kingdom Book 5) (2007)\n\nSuperior Saturday (The Keys to the Kingdom Book 6) (2008)\n\nLord Sunday (The Keys to the Kingdom Book 7) (2010)\n\nTroubletwisters series[]\n\nGenres: Children's Fantasy & Magic Adventure\n\nTheme:\n\nCo-Author: Sean Williams\n\nSeries list:\n\nTroubletwisters (Troubletwisters Book 1) (2011)\n\nThe Monster (Troubletwisters Book 2) (2012)\n\nThe Mystery (Troubletwisters Book 3) (2013)\n\nThe Missing (Troubletwisters Book 4) (2014) aka Missing, Presumed Evil\n\nHave Sword, Will Travel[]\n\nGenres: Children's Fantasy Adventure, Magic, Humorous Fantasy\n\nTheme: Children find an old \"talking\" sword\n\nCo-Author: Sean Williams\n\nSeries list:\n\nHave Sword, Will Travel(Have Sword Will Travel Book 1) (2017)\n\nLet Sleeping Dragons Lie(Have Sword Will Travel Book 2) (2018)\n\nLeft-Handed Booksellers of London series[]\n\nGenres: Alt History, Urban Fantasy\n\nTheme: Book Sellers in London fight the evil from the \"Old World\"\n\nSeries list:\n\nThe Left-Handed Booksellers of London (2020)\n\nThe Sinister Booksellers of Bath (2023)\n\nOther Works[]\n\nNovels[]\n\nThe Ragwitch (1991)\n\nShade's Children (1997)\n\nA Confusion of Princes (2012)\n\nNewt's Emerald (2015)\n\nFrogkisser!
