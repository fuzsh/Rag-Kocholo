He has been doing well to shape his career as a talented writer who despising all odds made it to the list of the most creative, highly oriented and gifted writers of the modern times. His style is unique and so much influential. Many young people believe that his name is a pseudonym, but he keeps responding to the question that it sounds as the best name for a fantasy author, but it is his real name. We take this opportunity to highlight some of the sections on the books and characters Nix has written as we look forward to informing, educating and entertaining you about his passion as a writer and his quality writing style. We will also look at descriptions of his two early books in a series he wrote.\n\nIn addition to his active roles in producing fantasy novels, Nix has also written a number of articles and scenarios for role-play field. This involves some that have been used in The Traveller and Dungeons & Dragons. These pieces have been published in other related publications such as Multiverse, and Breakout! As a gifted writer, Nix has also produced a number of case studies that influence the world especially in the information technology world.\n\nSeries of his two earlier books\n\nGarth Nix has done much to contribute to the fantasy genre of writing. He has played major roles in developing some famous books that have opened sense in the genre of writing. The Seventh Tower and The keys to the kingdom are his earlier works that catapulted his writing style to the publishing world making an impact in the fantasy world. This is a review of his works:\n\n1. The Seventh Tower :The Fall (2000)\n\nThe seventh Tower consist a series of his six early books with a joint partnership with Scholastic and LuccasFilm. We will look at two of his books in this series. It resolves around two children coming from distinct societies and all living in a world where sun is non-existent. In this fantasy world, the sun is blocked by a magical Veil that leaves the lives of many in complete darkness. Tal is a character who is chosen from The Castel while Milla is another major character in this series that is depicted as Icecarl coming from the ice. They are in an odyssey of self-realization where they finally discover that there is an evil that was thought to have long vanished, but it is here to haunt the world. It perfectly sets a slow move to destroy the world and many people are not aware as it secretly sets its presence felt in all different ways. There is a pact broken and a war that has been dormant for 2000 years ready to be rekindled. The lives of many individuals are in danger and the lives of these children hangs in loose air as they team up with other band of heroes to finally save their world that has been cast in the dark.\n\nThe Fall produced in 2000, starts the journey of this story and it is a fantasy book that you must read. Tal climbs the Red Tower together with his shadow guard in a mission aimed at stealing the Sunstone. In his mission, he manages to reach near the Veil, but a cry below tends to thwart his mission. He panics thinking that he has been cornered, only to realize that the cry was coming from his younger brother who stealthily followed him. He however, ignores his brother only to reach the Veil and encounter another Spirit Shadow by the name Keeper. It overpowers him and pushes him down to the tower.\n\n2. The Seventh Tower: The Castle (2000)\n\nThis was a continuation of a story from Nixâ€™s early book- The Fall. The Castle is developed in a creative way to simply depict the life of Tal and Milla in their daily activities as they meet other characters. The book involves moments of shock, grief, anger and also moments of conquering, joy and rejoicing. Tal together with Millas finally makes it out of the dark world and they manage to reach the titular castle. They first think that this is a place of peace as they get to realize that there is more they were looking in this place and that they will get without any contradictions. However, their joy is short lived as they come to realize that the castle inhabitants do not want them around. Milla is the most unwanted and they now have to look for an alternative. The two are now in danger and they have to avoid conspiracies in order to survive. They are sharp oriented and highly active in their lives and therefore seek to be very keen while interacting with the locals. They fear for their lives and discover new ways to survive.\n\nThe Castle is a creatively written fantasy book with many illustrations that set the lives of many characters in a unique setting. The plot is perfect and offers many readers a perfect opportunity to digest reality and discover what Garth Nix wishes to illustrate in a sense of belonging. The characters are sharply oriented, funny, witty, daring and highly passionate with life. While darkness surrounds their lives, some are determined to find a lasting solution. We discover that there is greed and untamed passion to greatness. Some are moved by malice, while others are moved by humanistic instincts to help others. This is a smooth way of illustration that the author uses to make his book make an impact to majority of readers. As fantasy book, it moves the nerves of many and makes them see sense in a fictitious world.\n\nThe books were published at the turn of the 21st century and at a time when many conspiracies were surrounding the world concerning the lives of many people in the new millennium. Nix uses the opportunity to put sense to his writing style."
