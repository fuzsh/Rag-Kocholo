For Tal, a Chosen, the Castle is home--even though he is not welcome anymore.  For Milla, an Icecarl warrior, the Castle is a strange and mysterious place.  Her presence is a threat that the Castle dwellers want to stop...at any cost.  Sinister forces are conspiring against them.  It will take all their strength to survive.",
