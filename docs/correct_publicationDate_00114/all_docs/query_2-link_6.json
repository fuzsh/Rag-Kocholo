        "text": "November 26, 2021\n\n(A-) 80% | Very Good\n\nNotes: Essentially a spy story dressed up as a murder mystery, its militaristic air and snow globe setting give it a Soviet feel.\n\nFebruary 2, 2012\n\nThough a part of me wants to rebel against liking this book, I couldn't help it.\n\nThe big caveat is to keep in mind that this is a cross-media novel, it's a real-world novel written by a fictitious character in a TV show. But even without the crossover, the book works ok. It's a solid mystery through and through.\n\nBut what drives me to rate this as 5 stars is the depth of planning involved here. The first 2 books were all right and had their moments, but I truly felt that a lot of thought went into writing this. From trying to find ways of tying in the events that Richard Castle experienced in his ride-alongs with Kate Beckett, to the semi-frequent breaking of the fourth wall. Although, come to think of it...this book seems to break 7-dimensional \"walls\" with nodding references made to fans of Nathan Fillion's as well. But that's where the genius of this book lies...for fans of Castle, it makes reading even the Author's Notes as a hunt for clues into the mind of Richard Castle. You really can see how \"Rick\" decided what events to include into his book and how he planned on handling issues that might have been too personal for him to put to paper.\n\nBasically, the book succeeds in being better understood with a good knowledge of the TV show, but the TV show itself is in turn better understood with having read this novel. And that's why the stellar rating.\n\nFor those who don't watch Castle...well, why are you reading this book at all...but just for you, I'd give a 3.5 stars on the merits of the book taken by itself.\n\nOctober 14, 2012\n\nEven though they are a little cheesy, I like them, and I like the series, both book and television. I think its great and hilarious that they attribute the writing credit to the fictional character, I love all the Castle books, but this one the best. Each subsequent book is not only longer then the previous one, but in my opinion better. The intrigue and conspiracy that go up the ranks within the NYPD was suspenseful enough to keep you turning the pages as well as shocking.\n\nI love the parallels between the characters in the show and the books. Ochoa is Esposito, Raley is Ryan and their characters being attached at the hip as partners in the show and books they call them Roach, the new Captain in the show being Gates so they call them Irons in the book, Castle being Rook and not a author but a journalist who moonlights as a romance novelist.\n\nLike its predecessor \"Naked Heat\", \"Heat Rises\" includes some great little nuggest for fans. The main one being the mentioning of the word castle, the name of the show from which these books stem.\n\nAlso, an ex-con being interrogated by Nikki Heat says he watched \"Quantum of Solace\" on Blu-Ray and then adds that Nikki Heat could be a Bond Girl. The joke being that Stana Katic who plays Kate Beckett whom Nikki Heat is based on played a Bond Girl in \"Quantum of Solace\".\n\nAt the end of chapter nine, Rook (Castle) says the famous line from the Castle promos: \"I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?\"\n\nOn the first page of chapter sixteen, Rook mentions Malcolm Reynolds, the character Nathan Fillion portrayed on the show \"Firefly\" and in the movie \"Serenity\" before nabbing the role of Richard Castle on \"Castle\".\n\nNot being censored by TV panels and such, the book drops the occasional F-bomb, but overall remains true to the spirit and fun of the TV show. I found \"Heat Rises\", like \"Naked Heat\", to be fun, engaging, and entertaining. Only \"Heat Rises\" struck me as better. The twists, the turns, etc. Not just more of the same, but improved! The murder of a priest turns a conspiracy that threatens the lives of Nikki Heat and those around her. Including Rook. Even Captain Montrose comes under the magnifying glass.\n\nLike a great episode of the television series these books keep me engaged and coming back for me. Time to pick up \"Frozen Heat,\" book 4 of the series.\n\nJuly 29, 2012\n\nThese get better with each installment; I am really looking forward to #4.\n\nThis one had twists and turns and false leads that kept Heat, as well as the reader, guessing.\n\nThe most amusing thing in these books are the subtle ( or not so subtle) referenses to the \"author.\" The main character, Rook, is the main one but then at the end we get that lovely book title from Victoria St. Claire...priceless.\n\n(Plus if you are a fan of the TV show, you get a good laugh from some of the ways Castle describes Rook.\n\nHumor aside, the detective work and mystery solving is really good as is the character and relationship development.\n\nQuite enjoyable. I give it 4 stars.\n\nSeptember 25, 2011\n\nAt first I didn't think this book was going to be any better than the other two in the Nikki Heat series. But with the ending and with further thought about how well it complements what's happening on the show, I decided I liked it quite a bit more. (Or maybe I was just less invested in the show when I read the first two books?) The books are mostly just official fan fiction, most of which I could take or leave, and the mysteries in and of themselves didn't really interest me (especially the second book). But the mystery played out really well in Heat Rises and was further enriched by how interestingly it reflected the show and served as Castle's recreation of the events around Montgomery's death and Beckett's shooting.\n\nThe ending was kind of heartbreaking -- Rook taking the bullet for Heat when Castle couldn't take it for Beckett, with Heat at Rook's bedside in the way that Castle couldn't be for Beckett because she pushed him away. The story's resolution was also interesting as Castle's recasting of Montgomery's role in Beckett's mom's murder -- Montrose was the one to lead them to the solution after his death, while Montgomery, similarly blaming and sacrificing himself, was only able to help to a point and refused to lead them to the truth.\n\nAnd then of course Belvedere Castle (\"looking upward at the castle that had been her salvation\"!) and the Victoria St. Clair romance novel with Kate Sackett (Castle of her Endless Longing!) -- more fan-fiction-fare! So many layers, and instead of just being amusing as in the previous books, they're much more interesting and even moving, because there is more at stake in their relationship now than there was in the first three seasons, especially with the secrets it looks like they'll be keeping from each other in the coming episodes.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 6, 2017\n\nThis one had a really interesting plot, plus a dramatic ending. And all the meta as an icing on the cake <3\n\nAugust 29, 2014\n\nI can't quite figure out why I'm more embarrassed to admit that I read weird Cop-show not-really!tie-ins than erotic Three Musketeers-fanfiction with vampires but somehow I am. There was I thinking my time for reading books that are inspired by TV-shows are over but apparently they aren't.\n\nI enjoy the Nikki Heat books. They have the same humour as the show and were clearly written by someone who knows the canon (both point against Max Allan Collins being behind the pseudonym). Additionally the relationship between Rook and Nikki is refreshingly without 'let's make this drama bigger than it is because we refuse to talk to/listen to each other'. In the first two books the cases were also entertaining enough.\n\nThis however is the third book and here the case was...meh. Admittedly I'm not a big fan of major conspiracies in which people higher up than the lead-detective try everything to stop her (or him) from solving the case. Did I say 'not a big fan'? I meant 'hate with a burning passion'. So this book and I weren't really off to a good start and it didn't get better when a certain person turned up with a big flashy neon-sign over their head saying 'I DID IT'\n\nJuly 17, 2012\n\nI must say that, \"Mr. Castle\" keeps improving over time. The plot of this book was well-thought-out, including some cleverly placed references to the show and to Nathan Fillion's other acting projects (Firefly, anyone?), which devoted fans of the show and the man are sure to appreciate. I did not catch the plot twist, I am pleased to say. Good murder mysteries are supposed to be like that--it gets boring when you can predict everything that is going to happen. All in all, the third Nikki Heat was expertly written, and I was very pleased. Except with that ending. \"Mr. Castle,\" you do know you have to write another one now, right?\n\nApril 20, 2019\n\nТук вече си говорим!!! 😍 Чудесно криминале с обрати и много хумор. Направо усетих духа на сериала :) Браво.\n\nMarch 2, 2012\n\n1) Spot the Firefly reference :-)\n\n2) Can we all acknowledge that the Castle saved her?\n\n3) Kate Sakett.\n\n4) No German under 50 is called Horst. Also, is Meuller a typo or is it a lame attempt to conceal the clichéd Mueller? Do we all call you Americans John Smith just to establish that you are American? For instance, I'm German (in case you didn't know) and I have the same last name as one of the THe Avengers actors. So in the future, a little bit of imagination won't hurt. (Also, an info, we do know how to use contractions. *sigh*)\n\n5) It is still not my favorite lit. genre but it was okay. I still like Kate and Rick more though. :-)\n\nOctober 29, 2018\n\nBlog|Instagram\n\nComo siempre Richard Castle pone a la agente Heat en un caso de homicidio que da vueltas y vueltas y con muchos calcetines desparejados. El caso del padre Grant prepara un escenario moralista que se extiende a todos los aspectos d ella vida de Nikki, destaquemos, por favor, su vida amorosa y el detallista de Jameson Rook, con una trama laboral más desarrollada para el escritor en este libro. La relación de nuestra protagonista con el escritor se presenta inicialmente como un acuerdo algo verde, pero que podremos observar como avanza escopeteada.\n\nLa verdad es que encuentro este libro con mucho politiqueo dentro de el sistema policial de Nueva York, y yo me preguntaba ¿cuales van a ser las represalias para Nikki por todos sus actos mientras está suspendida?(Sí, la suspenden a las puertas de un gran ascenso) ¿la respuesta? Ningunas, lo cual me decepciona bastante pero tampoco me incomoda.\n\nLa trama da un giro inesperado con esta suspensión para la detective, privada de sus recursos de investigación habituales es divertido ver como se las apaña tirando de favores y lealtad.\n\nLa verdad es que durante este libro me ha costado un poco mantener el hilo, con más personajes de lo habitual que en los otros me he encontrado con pequeño inconveniente, a los cuales mis soluciones han sido: eres Sheldon Cooper, o te lees el libro d aun tirón, o te toca hacer un poco de memora de ve en cuando.\n\nFinalmente, no os voy a chafar el asesino ni el final, el causante de todo es alguien poderoso y cercano que ayuda a Nikki a ser descubierto ¿Hola? ¿Te faltan neuronitas?\n\nOh, Rook...\n\nApril 15, 2012\n\nI have no idea who's really writing these books, but the author sure does a great job making it sound as if the character of Richard Castle really is penning these. This book was another fun read, with Nikki Heat in line to be promoted to lieutenant but having to solve a mess of a crime first, one that stems from a priest's murder at a bondage club that soon leads her to question an arrogant and obnoxious CIA contractor, a human rights group that might be a front for something else, and all sorts of problems in between.\n\nThe story is complicated and engrossing, keeping me guessing until the end. Even though this is a book inspired by a TV show, it's a quality mystery in itself, and one that I don't think you'd have to be a fan of Castle to enjoy - although you'd definitely enjoy it more if you're a fan, since the characters are so obviously inspired by the ones on the show! There were also characters not from the show, including an incompetent detective Nikki can't wait to be free of, and I thought they were done very well too.\n\nI also really loved the way that Nikki is written as being completely in love with Jameson Rook but not wanting to admit it. It's exactly how I'd imagine a book written by Castle to be. One description that actually made me laugh out loud was when Nikki's noted as admiring Rook's \"magnificent ass\". Fans of Castle will no doubt agree when I say that this is the exact sort of thing you can imagine him writing - and Beckett being upset about.\n\nApril 2, 2012\n\nThis latest entry in the world of Castle is, so far, the strongest of the lot. The characters are firmly entrenched, there's no more need for back story and we can get down to the business of a murder, a conspiracy and a mission.\n\nAt first I was a little surprised by the lack of Rook until he finally stumbles in 1/5th the way through the book. And once he does join in the book really starts taking it up a notch. Without Rook the book wouldn't have been anywhere near as good as it was. Heat may be the star but Rook is the reason you keep reading.\n\nThe story here was great, the conspiracy nice and murky. Up until the end I didn't pick the killer so kudos on a great twist. The little references to Mal Reynolds were nice. As much as I love the show for the first time one of these cross-over books has outperformed it. And one of the reasons why? The romance. There was no more of this 'will they, won't they' crap. It's out the open, they're happy, the story can move on. The show writers really need to take a leaf out of this book.\n\nA great entry in what is shaping up to be a nice little series. Now if only they can get the next Derek Storm graphic novel up to the same levl.\n\nSeptember 28, 2011\n\nHeat Rises (Nikki Heat Book 3) by Richard Castle\n\nWith the background in these books following along with real events in NYC, this story took place during one of the coldest snowiest winters in the last hundred years. Better historically accurate writing I couldn’t find anywhere else! At least not in this type of book\n\nA dead priest in a S And M club starts off what quickly becomes a story filled with red-herrings and things that will make you assume things perhaps you shouldn’t.\n\nI have to say, that out of the three books written so far this is by far the most complicated mystery, and gave me plenty of enjoyable hours contemplating the “who-dun-it” aspect. There are many shocking plot twists, armed chases, drug lords and enough assorted other evil seeming characters to satisfy the most hard-boiled mystery aficionado The fact that we are left with a cliff hanger in Nikki’s personal life was mean, mean, mean and I loved it!. I cannot wait for the next book\n\nDecember 3, 2011\n\nOnce again, I'm really impressed with the writing in these books. Much better than what I would expect to find in a television tie-in novel and it makes me want to renew my efforts to identify the ghost writer. As with the previous book, various plotpoints were gleaned from the previous season of the television show, but then remixed and presented in new and clever ways... giving the impression that they really were things witnessed by the \"author\" and then incorporated into the plot for his novel. I find the layers within layers of fiction here very appealing.\n\nSeptember 29, 2011\n\n4.5 stars\n\nI started reading the Nikki Heat books as a lark because I'm a fan of the show Castle. I have been very pleasantly surprised by how good they've been, but I have to say that this one was aces. Great plot, lots of red herrings and a cliff hanger to boot (not that I don't know how it'll turn out).\n\nI have to recommend this series if you're looking for a light mystery with mostly sly, tongue in cheek humor.\n\nSeptember 19, 2017\n\nHalf the fun of reading these is trying to figure out how it fits into the season of the show, and this one was no exception. The romance simmers a bit, and the crime was somewhat interesting, with a few twists and turns on it's way there. It was easy reading, but nothing overly special.\n\nFebruary 17, 2018\n\nIn questo libro si respira praticamente la stessa aria della serie tv, leggera e divertente nonostante il caso e tutte le diatribe che ne conseguono. Allo stesso tempo però manca un po’, anzi, tanto, l’atmosfera tipica della serie tv, il che lascia abbastanza vuoto il libro. Inoltre rispetto alla serie tv (che sottolineiamo io conosco a memoria e adoro) manca la novità: il libro rispecchia molto quello che succede nella serie tv nella terza stagione, senza portare nulla di nuovo, ma solo sostituendo i nomi dei protagonisti, per cui potevo decisamente immaginarmi cosa sarebbe successo e chi sarebbe stato il cattivo del libro.\n\nI personaggi sono simpatici ed originali, esattamente come nella serie tv sono quello che danno il brio al romanzo e che rendono la lettura interessante, in particolare i Roach, ma quando si tratta di quei due io sono decisamente di parte, potrebbero anche essere solo nominati in una pagina in tutto il romanzo e io direi che sono la cosa migliore del romanzo.\n\nIl caso, invece, è il punto debole del romanzo: sotto certi punti di vista è molto semplice (con tutto quello che succede ai protagonisti si capisce sin da subito qual è la situazione), sotto altri è persino troppo complicato a causa dell’eccesso di nomi.\n\nSeptember 11, 2023\n\nMon préféré jusque maintenant! L’enquête était une dinguerie :D\n\nJe trouve franchement que les intrigues arrivent au niveau de la série ce qui est super cool car on en prend plein la vue, tant par la théorie farfelues de Rook que part l’enquête et ses péripéties.\n\nCe que j’ai aussi adoré c’est qu’il y a eu PLEINS de réf cachées à la saison. C’est hyper satisfaisant quand t’as suivi la série et *pop* une réplique toute discrète, et pourtant importante apparaît (bref la fangirl en moi était surex)! Et les remerciements… iiiii Je peux pas en dire plus pour risque de spoil ahah !\n\nÉvidemment que je lirai la suite des aventures de Nikki et Rook! J’ai hâte de me procurer le 4e tome :)\n\nPS: les review de Cliff et Anthony dans les commentaires résument bien ce que je pense pas écrit joliment ;)\n\nFebruary 22, 2024\n\nI really enjoyed this story I was a big fan of the show castle so I got the books well my amazing wife got me the first few a long time ago but then I forgot about them and never continued the series well I stumbled upon this one sitting on my book shelf and I am so pleased to start this series back up again it’s all ways hard to remember this is not a book about the castle TV show but the books he wrote in the show a super interesting concept I loved the story line and was convinced I had the ending figured out half way through but boy was I wrong I loved the surprise ending the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I am not a fan of how long the chapters are I would enjoy it more if it was broken up into more chapters but I guess that is just personal preference\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\n“It’s not about knowing. You can never really know someone. It’s really about trust.”\n\n“When you say things like that to me, I call it a Kardashian. Know why? Because I'm looking for the but.”\n\nA murdered captain.\n\nAn unexpected promotion.\n\nGun fights and murderous chases through Central Park.\n\nNikki Heat was backed into a corner after the alleged suicide of her mentor and captain. She’s determined to prove the relations between his death, the case she’d been handed and a murder taken place 10 years before. Putting herself in danger time and again, Heat doesn’t give up and instead found the connection and put all the puzzle pieces together, painting a devastating picture full of betrayal, abuse of power and a web of lies. Trusting nobody but Rook after her suspension, Nikki comes our stronger than ever.\n\nThe twists, turns, plot, character development and reveals were too good to be true. Unexpected mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entirety of the book.\n\nSeptember 17, 2012\n\nHeat Rises by Richard Castle\n\nMy rating: 5 of 5 stars\n\nSince there are so many glowing reviews I won't bother to write a long winded version. I started this series on a whim because I liked the Castle TV show, I was more than surprised to find that these books were actually well written (ghost writer should get an award). I had read the first 2 books and they were very entertaining and worth the money but months later I could not tell you too much about the plot of either book. That usually means that they were in the category of \"you remember it was a good book but not much else\" which may be overly simplified but close enough to true. Then I started Heat Rises (Nikki Heat 3) and after taking me a chapter or two to get involved I was hooked and by the end I had been mad, glad, frustrated, overjoyed, sad, and completely entertained. This was a book I will remember, the writing was exceptional and the story kept knocking you back on your heels because every time you thought you knew who did what ...... you were wrong. I can only hope that the next book Frozen Heat (Nikki Heat, Book 4) will be as good, but this was a great piece of reading in any world even if you never watched Castle, for me it was 5 Star reading but I would still recommend starting from the beginning at Heat Wave (Nikki Heat). If you are a Prime Member and have a Kindle you can get book 1 for free via the Kindle Lending Library and I would recommend you do it :)\n\nView all my reviews\n\nAugust 23, 2012\n\nThose who watch Castle on TV already know that Richard Castle is not really the author of Heat Rises. In fact Richard Castle is not a real author (or person). Instead, he is a fictitious author who is the lead character in the ABC television show. Mr. Castle is a writer who observes (and helps) the investigative process of a New York City Police Department homicide unit in the show. In addition, Richard Castle, the TV character, publishes novels based on the characters in the TV show using different names for them. Heat Rises is the third such book that has been published. It’s a unique idea. It is also a very successful and lucrative stratagem for enhancing the popularity of the television show by cultivating additional fans from the reading public. The real author (or authors) of the Heat books are not widely known. I have read all three of the Richard Castle “Heat” books and I enjoyed all of them very much. In Heat Rises, Jameson Rook (the Castle character in the book) helps Nikki Heat (the Kate Beckett character in the book) investigate the murder of a priest in a New York City bondage club. The plot becomes fairly complex and leads both Rook and Heat into mortal danger from violent attacks by heavily armed assailants. Nikki Heat also endures the death of a colleague and the potential end of her career when she is stripped of her badge by internal affairs. It’s a fun book with lots of interesting twists and setbacks for the characters. However it also reveals very close and caring relationships between the regular characters. I really liked this book and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes police crime novels and especially for all the fans of the Castle television show.\n\nNovember 8, 2012\n\nIf you are a fan of the ABC show, Castle, then you will most likely already have picked up on the books that tie in – apparently written by the fictional character of Richard Castle (the author picture on the back cover is of Nathan Fillion, who plays him). Fans will most definitely enjoy the in-jokes and recognise the “real” situations and characters from the show that have inspired the “fictional” counterparts in the novels. They will laugh their socks off when Jameson Rook says things like, “I really am ruggedly handsome, aren’t I?” and get a real kick out of every Castle-ish turn of phrase.\n\nHowever, even if they’ve never tuned into the programme (currently in its fifth season), crime fans will still be able to enjoy these books. Yes, they use every corny crime trope going, but it’s part of the fun.\n\nBecause that’s what these books are all about – having fun with the whole crime genre.\n\nThere’s no point in reading Heat Rises unless you have first read Heat Wave and Naked Heat, but once you have finished those, you’ll be champing at the bit to get hold of the next installment.\n\nFirst and foremost, it’s another very clever tie-in with an increasingly popular crime drama, but Heat Rises (along with the prior novels) holds up in its own right. There’s very real suspense – you’ll be kept guessing till the “big reveal” and will enjoy every twist and turn along the way.\n\nNovember 1, 2011\n\nI am used to the hokey banter of the characters on CASTLE, so this third installment of the book series did not take me by surprise. I am eager to see how the weave it into the show (I hold off and watch the show all at once after the season ends) and what eyebrows may rise after this book is discussed.\n\nThe storyline works well and the reader is never sure where it will go. We begin with a priest and a BDSM club and minds immediately drift to one conclusion; a kinky padre. However, as the story unfolds, it makes a lot more sense and things flesh themselves out. Castle does well to inch things along and while it seems to take a while, we do get some answers.\n\nSome surprising twists that I did not see coming make for an interesting sub-plot in the book. There is, in my opinion, an over use of the corny and hokey double entendre and sexualised interaction for no literary reason in the story. I suppose the reader is supposed to assume that Castle is writing this as an out to show Beckett how he feels, but it's a little overdone. Perhaps we will get some of this same commentary when I tune in to the show.\n\nKudos Castle for the stellar job! Keep it up!\n\nNovember 1, 2011\n\nI have to admit, I was a little disappointed in most of this book. The problem is, I've already seen this story on last season's Castle. Yes, yes, I know, the whole appeal of these books is that they're basically an extended episode of Castle. But usually they're *just* unique enough from the TV show to provide an entertaining experience. This one just didn't seem all that different from last season on Castle. I also didn't like that a big portion of the book was primarily Nikki Heat without Rook. Rook, like Castle, is really the only reason I read! The character of Nikki Heat just isn't that interesting to me. I felt my mind wandering through much of the actual plot, so I'm not even sure I could tell you what happened. I have to admit, though, the ending did leave me wanting for the next book in the series. And glad that it happens to be Monday night, so I can get a good dose of Castle. Oh, and props to whomever the ghost writer for this series is on the cute Firefly reference near the end of the book.\n\nOctober 24, 2011\n\nHeat Rises by Richard Castle (pp. 305)\n\nAnother in the series of books based on the TV series, Castle, written by the lead character on the show. The books are largely solid escapist entertainment. But there’s some extra fun in this offering . The series is starting to find its own voice. It is fascinating to see how the ghost writer manages to juggle the continuing TV storyline and backstory while maintaining its own story world. Occasionally, you start getting lost in which world is the more dominant or better developed.\n\nThe central plot surrounding the mystery of a murdered priest is multi-dimensional and follows more than the average police procedural. The child-like silliness of Nathan Fillion’s character comes through in the writing of his author alter-ego and often breaks the fourth wall.\n\nOverall a satisfying story with a little extra guilty pleasure thrown in. Without some of the goof-ball dialogue or tongue-and-cheek interactions, the story might hold its own among some of the more serious thriller writers. Recommended for fans of the series.\n\nNovember 22, 2011\n\nBrowsing the books on the shelf at the library my eyes came to rest on this book. At first I couldn't believe it, the title was the same one mentioned on one of my favorite shows, \"Castle.\" When I picked the book up I started giggling; it was real! There was Richard Castle on the book jacket and a brief excerpt about Nikki Heat. Huzzah! I rushed home to show my husband and was thrilled by the actual read. The book was fantastic and so true to the show. I LOVED that Niki had to circle and circle and circle the block to look for parking and that traffic in the city took forever to navigate. Thank you, \"Castle,\" for putting in small details that we New Yorkers laugh about when we see them omitted in other shows (I'm talking to you, Law and Order. Seriously, the GWB bus station is so crowded that the cops can't catch the suspect?! *snort*). I loved the alliteration midway through the book and took great delight in Castle's witty comments. Loved the book and can't wait to read the other ones.\n\nSeptember 24, 2011\n\nWhat happens when your mentor and boss mysteriously commits suicide? What happens when you get the promotion, ace the test, only to have your badge stripped when you investigate the suicide? When you get too close too fast, you find out who your true friends and enemies are. Nikki Heat is in the middle of a power struggle the likes she's never seen in the 12th precinct when her captain, under a deluge of bad press and Internal Affairs investigations into the job he's doing, suddenly commits suicide. She doesn't buy it from the start, and starts digging. She has only a few people she can trust, among them her sidekick/romantic partner and author Jameson Rook. Together, it gets downright ugly and emotional. Just when you think you have figured it all out, you are thrown a number of curves. Definitely the best of the three Nikki Heat novels I've read so far."
