        "text": "The sixth and final adventure in the thrilling fantasy series from award-winning author Garth Nix.\n\nTal and Milla are only one step away from death, while the evil that has controlled their world for so long is about to triumph. If the Veil is lifted, nothing can save the Dark World.\n\nTheir one glimmer of hope is to confront the monster Sharrakor and regain the Violet keystone. But first they must climb up to the highest levels and find their way into the Seventh Tower...\n\nGarth Nix was born in 1963 in Melbourne, Australia, to the sound of the Salvation Army band outside playing'Hail the Conquering Hero Comes' or possibly'Roll Out the Barrel'. Garth left Melbourne at an early age for Canberra (the federal capital) and stayed there till he was nineteen, when he left to drive around the UK in a beat-up Austin with a boot full of books and a Silver-Reed typewriter. He is now an award-winning author and one of the most influential names in contemporary fantasy."
