DeepField launched its first product six months ago and the IT startup is gaining traction with its customers as it prepares to launch more products in the coming weeks.

The downtown Ann Arbor-based startup's software that enables large corporations to adapt to the ever changing world of the Internet's back-end IT infrastructure. The technology, which is being branded as Cloud Genome, automatically identifies, tracks, and disambiguates the structure of all cloud-based services. DeepField's big-data platform analyzes and correlates telemetry from routers, switches, DNS, and more, decoding all of the morass of information. The end result is more visibility into all facets of the user's IT network.

DeepField launched this technology six months ago. It is now deployed at 25 large networks around the world. The company estimates its software is deployed along 20 percent of all online consumer traffic. The 2-year-old company plans to launch new products during the spring and summer of this year.

"The initial offering solved some big problems for our customers," says Craig Labovitz, co-founder of DeepField. "We're diving much deeper now."

DeepField recently made the move from its original home in the Tech Brewery to bigger officers in downtown Ann Arbor above the Michigan Theater. It has also opened satellite offices in Colorado, Amsterdam and Washington, D.C. With that growth has brought a doubling of the companyâ€™s staff to just under 20 hires. Labovitz expects the company to hit a staff size of 25-30 people by the end of the year to keep up with demand.

"We're basically doubling each year," Labovitz says.
