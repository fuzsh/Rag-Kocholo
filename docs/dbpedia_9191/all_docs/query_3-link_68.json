        "text": "deep field – Amanda Lilleston\n\nSeptember 15 – December 30, 2023\n\nMaine-based artist Amanda Lilleston explores biological narratives through woodcut printing and collage in her exhibition deep field. The prints highlight the concept of transformation, depicted in burgeoning colors of flora. Lilleston began this body of work about ten years ago – the idea stemming from, “a broader, general interconnectedness of systems: biological, physiological, and ecological.”\n\nThe themes that permeate her artwork reflect Lilleston’s educational and life experience – as well as motherhood. The artist explains that she has become, “acutely aware of my body being part of a larger environment.” Lilleston thoughtfully examines these natural subjects to allow for adaptation and change within the imagery. Modification of the printmaking is emulated in the reduction printing process whereby the artist repeats the process of carving and printing until the final look is achieved. Lilleston makes further alterations by cutting and combining the printed pieces in new ways. Upon closer inspection viewers may notice that some of the same botanical forms appear as collaged elements in multiple compositions. The vibrant use of vivid greens and radiant reds fill these representations with energy and life.\n\nLilleston earned her BA in biology at the Colorado College, Colorado Springs and received her MFA from the University of Michigan.\n\nLeft: AMANDA LILLESTON (American, born 1984). untitled, 2023.
