        "text": "PARIS — U.S. swimmer Katie Ledecky won the women’s 800-meter freestyle in the 2024 Paris Games, earning her ninth Olympic gold medal. She joins Michael Phelps as the only swimmers to win the same event at four straight Summer Games. Also, U.S. sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson finished second in the women’s 100 finals, losing to Julien Alfred of Saint Lucia.\n\nSwimming: For Ariarne Titmus, playing a small part in Katie Ledecky’s legacy will always be special\n\nTitmus and Ledecky shared a long embrace while still in the water moments after the 800 finish.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the games, she remembered watching Ledecky from Australia — “I was in grade six in primary school, that’s how remarkable she is” — when the swimmer won her first of four straight golds in the event at the 2012 London Games.\n\nTitmus tuned in again for Ledecky’s race in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games while racing a junior event in Hawaii.\n\n“It ended up being eight years later I challenged her in her fourth consecutive in the 800,” Titmus said. “So I’m really proud of myself and I feel very honored and privileged to be her rival, and I hope I’ve made her a better athlete. She has certainly made me become the athlete I am. I felt so privileged to race alongside her.”\n\nTrack: 100-meter winner Julien Alfred says she grew up too poor to buy shoes\n\nJulien Alfred said she watched Usain Bolt’s former races in the 100-meter dash on Saturday to prepare for her own gold medal run.\n\nAlfred’s victory was the first Olympic medal for Saint Lucia. Bolt won the men’s race in 2008, 2012 and 2016. Alfred said she studied how Bolt executed to deliver the win for her island.\n\nShe said she grew up in Saint Lucia too poor to buy shoes and had to run barefoot, in her school uniform, in poor facilities. She said she hopes winning the gold will lead to a new stadium being built in Saint Lucia to grow track and field.\n\nSwimming: Ledecky says she had to trust herself to win the gold\n\nKatie Ledecky sang the national anthem side by side with bronze medalist American teammate Paige Madden as a fan held a sign reading “Legendecky” before the medal ceremony.\n\nLedecky expected Ariarne Titmus “to give me everything she had” in the 800-meter final.\n\n“We got 36 hours of rest, so I knew it was going to be a tough race,” Ledecky said. “I felt confident coming into it but I knew it was going to be tough no matter what all the way down to the finish. I just had to stick in the race and trust myself, trust my training and trust that I know how to race that event.”\n\nSwimming: France’s Léon Marchand misses out on another medal\n\nFrench star Léon Marchand missed out on a medal in the 4x100-meter mixed medley relay, even after he nearly caught China and U.S. in his breaststroke leg.\n\nFrance finished fourth a night after Marchand capped his brilliant individual Olympics with four golds: in the 200 and 400 individual medleys, 200 butterfly and 200 backstroke.\n\nThe American foursome set a world record in 3:37:43. The event began with the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nSwimming: U.S. wins gold and sets world record in the 4x100-meter mixed relay\n\nThe American foursome set a world record in 3:37:43 -- the event began with the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nSwimming: Katie Ledecky makes Olympic history\n\nAmerican Katie Ledecky won the 800-meter freestyle in her fourth consecutive Olympics, becoming only the second swimmer to do so.\n\nHer ninth gold in all also tied for second most among all Olympians — Summer or Winter — behind Michael Phelps’ 23.\n\nLedecky won in 8 minutes, 11.04 seconds to edge Australia’s Ariarne Titmus in 8:12.29. The 27-year-old hugged U.S. teammate Paige Madden afterward on the pool deck.\n\nSwimming: Katie Ledecky wins women’s 800M freestyle for ninth Olympic gold medal\n\nU.S. swimmer Katie Ledecky has won the women’s 800-meter freestyle for her ninth Olympic gold medal. It is the fourth time she has won this event.\n\nTrack: Julien Alfred wins women’s 100M for Saint Lucia’s first Olympic medal\n\nThe women’s 100-meter dash was won in 10.72 seconds by Julien Alfred of Saint Lucia.\n\nAlfred trains in Austin, Texas and went to the University Texas, but the watch party was in Saint Lucia as the sprinter delivered her island its first ever Olympic medal.\n\nShe was sobbing with her nation’s flag draped over her shoulder as she briefly hugged American bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson.\n\nSha’Carri Richardson ran 10.87 for silver and Jefferson was third at 10.92. Alfred led the entire 100 meters.\n\nSwimming: Katie Ledecky in the pool for the women’s 800M freestyle final\n\nKatie Ledecky is off the starting blocks and underway in the 800-meter freestyle final as she chases her ninth gold medal and history.\n\nLedecky would join fellow American Michael Phelps as the only swimmers, male or female and from any country, to win four Olympic gold medals in the same event.\n\nIt also would match the second most Olympic wins — Summer or Winter — in any sport behind Phelps’ 23.\n\nLedecky would join Finnish distance runner Paavo Nurmi, Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina, American swimmer Mark Spitz and American sprinter Carl Lewis with nine.\n\nLedecky also is the record holder at the distance with a time of 8:04.79.\n\nTrack: Sha’Carri Richardson gets silver in the women’s 100 meters\n\nSha’Carri Richardson has won silver in the women’s 100-meter dash, losing to Julien Alfred in the final.\n\nMelissa Jefferson got bronze to give the Americans two medals in the event. Alfred won the first ever Olympic medal for Saint Lucia.\n\nTwo-time Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce of Jamaica was not in the final. She abruptly pulled out ahead of her semifinal heat.\n\nSwimming: American Alex Walsh disqualified in women’s 200M individual medley\n\nAlex Walsh of the United States was disqualified and denied the bronze medal in the women’s 200-meter individual medley.\n\nWalsh, who finished third, was disqualified for not completing the backstroke leg on her back and turning too soon, according to World Aquatics, which cited a referee. She declined to stop in the mixed zone to speak with reporters.\n\nFellow American Kate Douglass was second for silver in the race won by 17-year-old Canadian Summer McIntosh. It’s her third gold medal of the Paris Olympics.\n\nTrack: Rain continues to fall leading up to the women’s 100-meter dash\n\nThe women in the 100-meter dash are on a wet track preparing for the final.\n\nIt started to rain about 45 minutes before the women came out to try the starting blocks ahead of the final.\n\nIt was dry during the three semifinal heats, but the final will be run in both rain but also on a track that is pooling water in places.\n\nTrack: Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce’s quest for another 100M title abruptly ends\n\nTwo-time Olympic 100 champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce’s quest for another title ended abruptly when she pulled out of the 100-meter semifinal.\n\nNo immediate reason was given for Fraser-Pryce’s scratch, which came up on the scoreboard only moments before she was supposed to race Sha’Carri Richardson and Julien Alfred in the evening’s second semifinal.\n\nEarlier in the day, Fraser-Pryce was one of several athletes blocked from entering the training track, the Jamaica team said on its social media site. The team said she was eventually let in. It did not say whether that played into her sudden scratch.\n\nTrack: Ryan Crouser wins his third straight shot put gold\n\nAmerican Ryan Crouser is an Olympic champion again, taking home his third straight gold in shot put by once again holding off countrymate Joe Kovacs, who got silver.\n\nTrack: It’s raining hard ahead of the 100-meter final\n\nThe rain is really coming down at Stade de France about 15 minutes before Sha’Carri Richardson tries for gold in the 100-meter final.\n\nCameramen and others working around the field have had their hoods up for a while, trying to stay dry. Some water is even pooling on the inner edge of Lane 1 in the corners of the purple Olympics track.\n\nTrack: Femke Bol and the Netherlands beat the U.S. to win 4x400M mixed relay\n\nFemke Bol surged from fourth to cruise past leader Kaylyn Brown of the United States in the final 10 meters to give the Netherlands the gold medal in the 4x400 mixed relay. Bol ran the anchor leg in 47.93 seconds.\n\nBrown went 49.19 on the final leg after taking the baton with the Americans out front. The runner-up finish came one day after the U.S. team of Vernon Norwood, Shamier Little, Bryce Deadmon and Brown set the world record at 3 minutes, 07.41 seconds. The Netherlands won the event at 3:07.43.\n\nTrack: France pole vaulter Anthony Ammirati misses out on a medal\n\nFrench pole vaulter Anthony Ammirati missed out on earning a medal at his home Olympics when his crotch got caught on the crossbar.\n\nThe 21-year-old went to clear the crossbar when his crotch caught the bar and he fell to the ground. After four attempts, Ammirati finished with a combined score of 5.60 and in 12th position, not enough to advance to the final.\n\nTrack: Rain arrives at Stade de France\n\nIt is raining at Stade de France for Saturday night’s track and field events.\n\nThe rain started during the men’s shot put and women’s triple jump and ahead of the women’s 100-meter final, which features three Americans in the field.\n\nTrack: Terry joins Richardson and Jefferson in women’s 100M final\n\nAmerican sprinter Twanisha Terry earned a spot in the women’s 100-meter final even though she finished third in her heat.\n\nTerry ran an 11.07 to earn a spot based on speed. Through the three heats, three women ran inside 10.9 and eight inside 11.0 seconds.\n\nTerry joins fellow Americans Sha’Carri Richardson and Melissa Jefferson in the final later Saturday.\n\nTrack: Sha’Carri Richardson reaches the final in the women’s 100 meters\n\nAmerican sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson received a roaring ovation ahead of her heat in the women’s 100-meter semifinal, and then she finished second to earn an automatic berth into the final.\n\nRichardson ran 10.89 seconds but lost the heat to Julien Alfred of St. Lucia, who ran a 10.84. She and Richardson are the only two women at these Games to crack 10.8 seconds this year.\n\nTrack: Fraser-Pryce pulls out of the women’s 100M dash\n\nTwo-time Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce of Jamaica has pulled out of the women’s 100-meter dash.\n\nThe 37-year-old won the 100 in 2008 and 2012 and has said Paris will be her final Olympics. She is not entered in the 200 meters.\n\nFraser-Pryce gave no immediate reason for withdrawing. She was scheduled to run in the same heat as Sha’Carri Richardson.\n\nTrack: Jefferson advances to women’s 100M final\n\nU.S. sprinter Melissa Jefferson won the first of three semifinal heats to advance to the final of the women’s 100-meter dash.\n\nThe top two in each heat earn an automatic berth in the final. Jefferson ran it in 10.99 seconds.\n\nSha’Carri Richardson runs in the second.\n\nTrack: Crouser leads early in shot put showdown vs Kovacs\n\nTokyo shot put champion Ryan Crouser has an early lead in the Paris Olympics final.\n\nThe American opened with a mark of 22.64 meters, well clear of countrymate and Tokyo silver medalist Joe Kovacs at 21.69.\n\nCrouser’s gold in Tokyo came with a world record mark of 23.56. Still five attempts left for each of them.\n\nWhat to watch: Katie Ledecky looks to join a handful of Olympians with 9 gold medals\n\nNine total Olympic gold medals is what Katie Ledecky is going for on the second-to-last day of swimming competition at La Defense Arena.\n\nThat would match the second most Olympic wins — Summer or Winter — in any sport behind Michael Phelps’ 23.\n\nLedecky would join Finnish distance runner Paavo Nurmi, Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina, American swimmer Mark Spitz and American sprinter Carl Lewis with nine.\n\nIn the morning heats of the 800-meter race, Ledecky was fastest in 8 minutes, 16.62 seconds. She also is the record holder at the distance with a time of 8:04.79.\n\nThe women’s 800 meters is scheduled to begin at 10:08 p.m. CEST (4:08 p.m. EDT).\n\nTrack: Exciting finish in the men’s 1500-meter semifinals\n\nIreland’s Cathal Doyle went from sixth on the final turn of the 1500-meters to earn a spot in the semifinals.\n\nThe crowd was on its feet cheering for France runner Azeddine Habz, who was leading until Doyle surged from the middle of the pack and caught him at the line.\n\nThe top three finishers in each heat advance to the semifinals.\n\nBasketball: US rolls into Olympic men's quarterfinals as No. 1\n\nseed\n\nHalfway to its goal of gold, the U.S. men’s basketball team has the No. 1 seed going into the medal round at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAnd now the real games start.\n\nAnthony Edwards scored 26 points, six players reached double figures for the U.S. and the Americans wrapped up the top spot coming out of group play by rolling past Puerto Rico 104-83.\n\n— By Tim Reynolds\n\nTrack: Sha’Carri Richardson headlines second women’s 100M semifinal\n\nThe second semifinal of the women’s 100 meters has a deep field featuring Sha’Carri Richardson and Julien Alfred: the only two women at the Olympics to crack 10.8 seconds this year.\n\nAlso in the field is two-time Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. The 37-year-old won the 100 in 2008 and 2012.\n\nOnly the top two finishers in each heat automatically qualify for Saturday night’s final. That means at least one of those three will have to wait to see if they have one of the two best times among non-automatic qualifiers in the evening’s three semifinals to advance.\n\nIt was a similar situation at last year’s world championships — not the same three runners, but also heavily stacked — and it was referred to as “The Semifinal of Death.”\n\n— By Jenna Fryer\n\nTennis: Zheng Qinwen wins China’s first Olympic tennis singles gold\n\nZheng Qinwen has claimed China’s first tennis singles gold medal in Olympics history by defeating Donna Vekic of Croatia 6-2, 6-3.\n\nThe 21-year-old Zheng displayed the same powerful serves and groundstrokes she used to eliminate No. 1 Iga Swiatek in the semifinals and now has the biggest title of her career.\n\nNot that Zheng hasn’t shown plenty of promise already. She is ranked seventh in the world and was the runner-up to Aryna Sabalenka at the hard-court Australian Open in January.\n\n— By Howard Fendrich\n\nBoxing: Imane Khelif clinches medal at Paris Olympics\n\nBoxer Imane Khelif of Algeria clinched a medal following days of sharp scrutiny and online abuse as misconceptions about her gender have exploded into a larger clash about identity in sports.\n\nKhelif defeated Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary 5:0 in the quarterfinals of the women’s 66-kilogram bout.\n\nKhelif will win at least a bronze medal after defeating Hamori for the second victory of her tumultuous second trip to the Olympics.\n\n— By Greg Beacham\n\nSoccer: US beats Japan to advance to the semifinals\n\nThe U.S has advanced to the semifinals of the women’s soccer tournament at the 2024 Olympics in Paris after beating Japan 1-0 on Trinity Rodman’s goal in extra time.\n\nThe Americans will next face Canada or Germany on Tuesday with a spot in the final on the line.\n\nBoxing: Khelif and Hamori begin their bout\n\nAs Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Hungarian boxer Anna Luca Hamori begin their bout, they each score a few strong blows. Each blow by Khelif is met by a roar by Algerian supporters.\n\nHamori and Khelif have never sparred, but they have competed in the same tournament before.\n\n— By Megan Janetsky\n\nGymnastics: Simone Biles wins gold in vault\n\nSimone Biles has won the gold medal in women’s fault. It is his her seventh Olympic gold medal and 10th overall.\n\nSoccer: Trinity Rodman goal sparks US celebration\n\nTrinity Rodman collected the ball, cut inside and whipped a shot into the top corner of the net with her left foot just at the end of the first half of extra time.\n\nAfter giving the U.S. a 1-0 lead on Japan in the quarterfinal match, she was then swamped by celebrating teammates. Megan Rapinoe, watching from the stands, seemed to enjoy that, too.\n\n— By James Robson\n\nGymnastics: Rebeca Andrade from Brazil up next on the vault\n\nIt will soon be Rebeca Andrade’s turn to take to the vault runaway\n\nThe ace Brazilian gymnast is facing a tall order in the defense of her Olympic title. Biles was stunning on her two attempts, finishing with a score of 15.300.\n\nThere was speculation Andrade could attempt a Yurchenko triple twist during the final. Andrade has submitted the vault to be named after her in the sport’s Code of Points.\n\nAndrade has performed it at training but did not try it the all-around final when she finished second to Biles.\n\n— By Sam Petrequin\n\nGymnastics: Simone Biles nails her two vault attempts\n\nSimone Biles is on good position to win her second Olympic vault title.\n\nShe scored an average of 15.300 for her two vaults, a rotation that included her signature Yurchenko double pike, which is the hardest being done in competition by any female gymnast.\n\n— By Will Graves\n\nSoccer: US and Japan heading to extra time\n\nThe game is going to extra time after ending 0-0 in regulation.\n\nIt opened up in the final moments, with the U.S. finally stretching Japan’s defense consistently.\n\nThere will be 30 minutes of extra time, and if the game is still tied, it will go to penalties.\n\n—By James Robson\n\nBoxing: Algerians flock to support Imane Khelif\n\nLong before the bout begins, Algerian fans like 37-year-old Delilah Benrabah were already gathering outside the stadium cloaked in their country’s flag to support boxer Imane Khelif.\n\nShe said she was watching her social media in recent days and felt the spread of false information about Khelif was “shameful.”\n\n“She’s a very strong Algerian women,” Benrabah said. “In Algeria, we don’t accept people hurting Algerians. We are here to support our team. We have to be united. We are here to give her support and we wish she gets the gold medal.\n\n“She’s far from home, and we’re here to support her.”\n\n— By Megan Janetsky\n\nGymnastics: Simone Biles has two vault elements named after her\n\nSimone Biles has spent the last decade-plus redefining what is possible in gymnastics. The American star has had five skills named after her in the Code of Points after completing them in competition.\n\nTwo of those are in the vault, her upcoming event while seeking a seventh Olympic gold medal and 10th overall.\n\nBiles I (vault version)\n\nAs with a lot of gymnastics elements, Biles took a Cheng vault and added another layer of difficulty — this one an extra half twist on a vault originally done by China’s Cheng Fei.\n\nThe vault requires Biles to do a round-off onto the vault, then a half-twist onto the table before doing two full twists. It entered the Code after she made it part of her routine at the 2018 world championships.\n\nBiles II (vault version)\n\nThis may be the most dazzling, most daring one of them all.\n\nThe Yurchenko double pike had never been completed by a woman in competition, and few men have even tried. She began tinkering with it in 2021, but it’s in the last year that it has morphed into perhaps the most show-stopping thing done in the sport.\n\nThe vault asks Biles to do a round-off back handspring onto the table, then two backward flips in pike position with her hands essentially clasped to her knees. She does it with so much power, she can sometimes overcook it. At the U.S. Olympic trials last month, it drew a standing ovation.\n\n“No, it’s not normal,” longtime coach Laurent Landi said after she drilled it at the 2023 U.S. Championships. “She’s not normal.”\n\n— By Will Graves\n\n▶ Read more about Biles redefining her sport\n\nGymnastics: Jade Carey is set to compete in the women’s vault final\n\nJade Carey won’t defend the floor exercise gold medal she won three years ago in Tokyo, but she is in the vault final this afternoon.\n\nCarey is the second American gymnast competing among the eight top vaulters, along with Simone Biles.\n\nThe 24-year-old earned a spot in final following a third-place finish behind Biles and Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade. Carey made the vault final in Tokyo, finishing eighth.\n\n— By Sam Petrequin\n\nSoccer: US-Japan quarterfinal kicks off\n\nThe quarterfinal game between United States and Japan has kicked off at Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nIt looks like a full house again after the men’s match between the U.S. and Morocco on Friday.\n\nThe winner of this match plays either Canada or Germany in the semifinals in Lyon on Tuesday.\n\n— By James Robson\n\nGymnastics: Simone Biles’ name brings cheers well before she competes\n\nJust the name Simone Biles is enough to trigger applause.\n\nMore than an hour before the vault event that also features Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, the presenter at Bercy Arena announcing that expected duel set off wild shouts from the still half-empty venue.\n\nIf Biles wins, it will be her seventh Olympic gold medal, and 10th overall. Andrade was second to Biles in all-around.\n\n▶ Read more about Biles’ pursuit of history at the Paris Games\n\n— By Sam Petrequin\n\nSoccer: US makes a lineup change for its quarterfinal game vs. Japan\n\nThe U.S. women’s national team made one change to the starting lineup for its quarterfinal match against Japan in Paris.\n\nKorbin Albert replaced Sam Coffey in the midfield. Coffey was ineligible for the game because of yellow card accumulation.\n\nThe United States also made forward Jaedyn Shaw available after she missed the first three games with a leg injury.\n\n— By Anne M.
