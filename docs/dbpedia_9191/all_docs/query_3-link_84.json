        "text": "Home\n\nDeep Sky\n\nDeep Sky\n\nDeep Sky in IMAX® immerses audiences in the awe-inspiring images of the universe captured by NASA’s Webb Telescope.\n\nAbout\n\nDeep Sky brings the awe-inspiring images captured by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to IMAX® – taking audiences on a journey to the beginning of time and space, to never-before-seen cosmic landscapes, and to recently discovered exoplanets, planets around other stars. Directed by Oscar®-nominated filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn and narrated by Oscar®-nominated actress Michelle Williams, Deep Sky follows the high-stakes global mission to build JWST and to launch it into orbit one-million miles from Earth in an attempt to answer questions that have haunted us since the beginning of time: Where did we come from? How did the universe begin? Are we alone? 13 billion years in the making, Deep Sky reveals the universe as we have never seen it before, immersing audiences in the stunning pictures beamed back to earth by NASA’s new telescope and capturing their vast beauty at a scale that can only be experienced on the giant IMAX screen.\n\nRATING: G – General Audiences\n\nRUNTIME: Approx. 41 minutes.\n\nTickets for OMNIMAX® films are available online, at the Science Center or by calling our box office at 314.289.4400. Feature films may have special pricing. Discounts are available for groups of 10 or more.\n\nCLOSED\n\nDive Deeper\n\n“If there ever was a subject tailor-made for IMAX screens, this is it,” said Director Nathaniel Kahn. “The IMAX format allows you to appreciate the astonishing resolution of NASA’s new telescope and to immerse yourself in cosmic landscapes that leave you filled with awe.”\n\nDeep Sky goes behind the scenes of JWST, capturing its launch and the release of the mindblowing first full-color images seen by billions around the world. The film is a thrilling story that begins during the telescope’s construction, following it to the harrowing launch stage, and through the release of the first full-color images to the public on July 12, 2022 and beyond.\n\n“I’ve always been fascinated by the beauty and magnitude of space,” said Michelle Williams. “I’m excited to work with Nathaniel and IMAX to tell the story of the captivating images taken by this new telescope.”\n\nDeep Sky is written, produced and directed by Nathaniel Kahn, produced by Bonnie Hlinomaz and executive produced by John Turner, Matt Mountain, Sandra Evers-Manly, and Gerry Ohrstrom. The film was financed in part by a grant from the Northrop Grumman Foundation and is co-financed by IMAX. IMAX and the filmmakers are grateful to NASA, ESA, CSA, the Space Telescope Science Institute, and AURA for their assistance in making this film.\n\nMovie Pricing\n\nThis is a paid experience.\n\nAges\n\nPrice\n\nMembers FREE* Children (ages 2-12) $9.50 Adults (ages 13-59) $11.50 Seniors (ages 60+) $9.50 College Students with ID $9.50 Military $9.50\n\nWhat is the JWST?\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is the largest, most powerful space telescope ever built. It will allow scientists to look at what our universe was like about 200 million years after the Big Bang. The telescope will be able to capture images of some of the first galaxies ever formed. It will also be able to observe objects in our solar system from Mars outward, look inside dust clouds to see where new stars and planets are forming and examine the atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars. It will be hunting for signs of life on other planets.\n\nThe JWST launched on December 25, 2021 in French Guiana.\n\nIts first images were released immediately after the science instrument commissioning phase concluded. Webb’s first deep field image was released on July 11, 2022.\n\nLearn more about the JWST\n\nAn animation illustrating what the James Webb Space Telescope Looks like.

Webb’s near-infrared image was fused with its mid-infrared image, setting this star-forming region ablaze with new details.\n\nPhoto Credit: NASA\n\nHourglass L1527-NIRCam\n\nFeatured in the IMAX® documentary Deep Sky, the protostar within the dark cloud L1527, shown in this image from JWST’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), is embedded within a cloud of material feeding its growth. Ejections from the star have cleared out cavities above and below it, whose boundaries glow orange and blue in this infrared view.\n\nPhoto Credit: NASA\n\nPillars of Creation (MIRI)\n\nFeatured in the IMAX® documentary Deep Sky, JWST’s mid-infrared view of the Pillars of Creation strikes a chilling tone. Thousands of stars that exist in this region disappear – and seemingly endless layers of gas and dust become the centerpiece. The detection of dust by Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) is extremely important – dust is a major ingredient for star formation.\n\nPhoto Credit: NASA\n\nRho Ophiuchi (NIRCam Image)\n\nFeatured in the IMAX® documentary Deep Sky, this image from JWST displays star birth like it’s never been seen before, full of detailed, impressionistic texture. The subject is the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, the closest star-forming region to Earth.\n\nPhoto Credit: NASA\n\nLocation\n\nOMNIMAX Theater films take place in the OMNIMAX Theater on the 2nd floor of the main 5050 Oakland Building.
