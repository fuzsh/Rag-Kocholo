        "text": "wongblog: why smart people are better off with fewer friends\n\ni’m not sure how to square these findings with the fact that i’ve long said that in a parallel universe very close to our own i live alone in cabin in the middle of nowhere writing manifestos: “The effect of population density on life satisfaction was therefore more than twice as large for low-IQ individuals than for high-IQ individuals,” they found. And “more intelligent individuals were actually less satisfied with life if they socialized with their friends more frequently.”\n\neverything you think you know about thanksgiving is wrong.\n\nthe heart warming fable of thanksgiving, unsurprisingly, ends up being a whole lot more complicated than some of us were taught and answers the nagging question of how squanto spoke perfect english when the pilgrims arrived and what was happening during the 100 year interim between columbus and the pilgrims ( spoiler: it involves human trafficking, enslavement and villages being wiped out ). and if you’re a stickler for tradition, you should put ditch the turkey and cranberry sauce for salted pork and olives since the spanyiards were the first to celebrate thanksgiving 50 years before the pilgrims.\n\ni, for one, welcome our herbicide-free giant weed punching robot overlords.\n\n“…researchers from a Bosch startup called Deepfield Robotics presented a paper on “Vision-Based High-Speed Manipulation for Robotic Ultra-Precise Weed Control,” which has like four distinct exciting-sounding phrases in it.” IEEE Spectrum\n\ncracked: We Built Their Death Squads: ISIS’s Bizarre Origin Story\n\n“We learned that, if we’re not the father of ISIS, the United States is at least some sort of uncle.” cracked\n\ni’m suuuuuuure it’s an honest mistake on apple’s part.\n\nafter updating to iOS 9 and el capitan i’ve been having troubles synching photos from my iphone to my macbook air. the mac would recognize the iphone but no photos would show up in the photos application or image capture. it was driving me nuts. turns out, if you have non-apple services like dropbox running that sync your photos to non-icloud services you have to turn them off.\n\nPenn Live: Leroy Stolzfus clocks a 3:05 at Harrisburg Marathon in full Amish garb.\n\nhaving run a half a dozen marathons, i can’t imagine finishing in 3:05. even more unimaginable in full amish garb so kudos to leroy stolzfus. the whole article is great read but now i want to know more of the backstory on why he started to run: “A few years ago, Stolzfus got “involved with some stuff” he said he shouldn’t have. His brother-in-law suggested he start running instead when he was tempted. He took the suggestion to heart, and went out for a run.”\n\nsome of you will be deciphering cuneiform tweets this christmas\n\ni think i know what some of you will be getting for christmas! dumb cuneiform creates clay tablets of tweets. you’ll have big fun guessing if you got a trump tweet or a neal degrease tyson tweet. [ via Waxy links ]\n\nnyt: Viewfinder: Hogpen Hill Farm\n\nhuh, who knew edward tufte has a farm with 234-acres of landscape sculpture fields that he opens to the public once a year. i’d love to make a trip. and i also love the article’s description of tufte, “[he] is also known as a genius of data visualization, professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale, an author of books on information design, and a hater of PowerPoint.\n\nthe new yorker: what we think about when we run.\n\nso very, very true. “To run five or ten or twenty-six miles is, as much as anything else, to engage in a sustained way with the deep strangeness that is the human mind.”\n\nThe story of .io | Citizen Ex\n\n“The Chagossian people have a word, in their Creole language, for heartbreak: sagren. It is a profound sorrow which refers to the loss of a home, and the impossibility of returning to it. As we build new worlds with our technologies, knitted from fiber-optic light and lines of code, it is incumbent on us to ensure it does not reproduce the erasures and abuses of the old, but properly accounts for the rights and liberties of every one of us.” citizen-ex"
