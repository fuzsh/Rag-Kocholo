        "text": "odin has an appointment to get braces put on today so of course I had to take a ‚Äúbefore‚Äù photo as we raced out the door to get to school ( running behind because he didn‚Äôt get home from hockey until 10:30p.m. and mr sleepy sleepy needs his sleep so i tried to let him sleep in as long as possible ) . i‚Äôm still getting used to him wearing contacts so braces is going to be a whole new level of WHO IS THIS KID WHO IS GROWING UP SO FAST!\n\nalso, i forgot to mention that he recently reached a milestone that he‚Äôs been eagerly anticipating! He‚Äôs 5‚Äô6 which means he‚Äôs taller than his mother! ( literally grew an inch in a month ).\n\ni‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the lobby of hotels with hockey players and their parents but this is the first time i‚Äôve ever seen a game called klask. apparently it‚Äôs a popular new game that was recently invented in denmark.\n\nthe kids and parents both seemed to enjoy it thought kris and i stuck to old school cribbage.\n\nheya! a lot has happened since i went on a little blog hiatus! state hockey championships came and went. odin‚Äôs team lost the first game but won the remaining three which earned them a consolation prize.\n\nalso, odin decided to try out for the regional youth AAA hockey team, the jr. chill, and made the team! odin is just one of two 12 year olds who made the team so he‚Äôll be playing with and against, bigger and faster 13 and 14 year olds.\n\ntoday was their first game of their first tournament in elk river, minnesota.\n\nodin learned very quickly that the pace of play was quite a bit different! and it‚Äôs his very first time playing with checking!\n\ni thought they played well for their first game and trying to figure out how to come together as a team. they held the game within a point, 2-1, until the last five minutes when frustrations boiled over and two of his teammates when into the penalty box and the opposing team scored two quick goals to end the game 4-1.\n\nhi. ho. odin played great ( he‚Äôs in the blue jersey ), had fun and didn‚Äôt get intimated after getting knocked into the boards a couple of times üôÇ\n\nit‚Äôs hard to believe the regular hockey season is almost over with just a couple of games left for odin in his last year as a pee wee.\n\nhe‚Äôs a great player but if i‚Äôve learned anything over the years ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to take a great photo of defenseman in action ( much easier to take photos of offense shooting pucks into the net than taking photos of defense running down pucks ) üòÉ\n\nunfortunately they lost to dodgeville 3-6. there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll play them at the state championships in a few weeks so they‚Äôll need to step up their game if they want to take home a trophy.\n\nso proud of odin for studying hard all summer, passing the tests and becoming a hockey ref! his first game was today reffing viroqua versus black river falls. His first job! as an added bonus he had first experience of having parents swear at him from the stands.\n\nseriously, if you‚Äôre swearing at a 12 year old ref you really need to reevaluate your priorities. Happy the asshat parents didn‚Äôt phase odin and he‚Äôs very excited to keep reffing."
