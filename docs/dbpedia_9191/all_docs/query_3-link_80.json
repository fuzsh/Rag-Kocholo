        "text": "Photographed over ten days in December 1995 by the Hubble Space Telescope, showing the 'deepest-ever' view of the universe. He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth themall by their names: tutti-frutti, Cimabue, bracelets of Cartier, chock full o'Giotto spilled onto a black sky like Jujubes during a matinee. Anna-Eva Bergmanpainted Earth Seen from the Moon and then painted the moon—Grand rond gong in vinylique and metal leaf—as if it were the mirror she used for viewing her own paintings. In the cosmos of Dante, everyone enters deathbackwards, their past still before them, just as in some funeralprocessions there walks a saddled horse without a rider, boots reversedin the stirrups. If speech, as George Eliot claims, is but broken light upon the depth of the unspoken, then all musicplayed on the terraces of the audiences of the moon streams from the violino, the most prized salami in Lombardy—made from the haunches and shoulders of goat, deer, or chamois—shaped like a musical instrument and carved as a violin would be played: the paw graspedwith the left hand, the leg held firm beneath the chin, while in the right handa knife slides like a rosined bow. Traditionally accompanied by a Valtellina Superiore, Infernoriserva, it is eaten with a bit of Bitto cheese from the Celtic bitu, eternal, which can be kept for a very long time. The telescope showed us galaxiesso far away that their light has been traveling toward us for most of the history of the universe, even though the galaxies keep moving away, just as Augustine explained: So I can be far from glad in remembering myselfto have been glad, and far from sad when I recall my pastsadness, as in the descent into descant or chant, the Latincanere: to sing. Even now I see us on the boat leaving Venice—you facing forward, me looking back. You did not move toward me yet remained in view: your facecentered, in focus, with all of Venice receding behind you."
