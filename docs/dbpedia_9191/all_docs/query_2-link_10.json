        "text": "MUSKEGON — “The boys are back in town,” but this time homegrown rebels Pop Evil are testing uncharted waters.\n\n“We’re really excited because they’re playing acoustically,” said Misty Nichols, a manager of downtown Muskegon's Club Envy. “I love that!”\n\nThe ever-touring band members of Pop Evil (400 shows since the re-release of 2008’s “Lipstick on the Mirror”) have decided to slow it down for their Friday show, said bassist and Reeths-Puffer grad Matt DiRito. They'll even be chatting with the audience between songs and answering questions.\n\n“We’re changing it up so they (friends and family who travel to their Flint and Grand Rapids gigs) don’t have to see the same thing,” added charismatic front man Leigh Kakaty, a North Muskegon native. “The shows are cool. Fans can converse with us. I would’ve loved the opportunity to do that with (West Michigan’s) Verve Pipe back when they were hot.”\n\nA slave to the grind — but no worse for the wear — the band finds itself on top of a mountain, having their recently released “War of Angels” debut on Billboard’s rock album chart at No. 8. Produced by Chicago’s Johnny K (Disturbed, Megadeth), “Angels” is a concept album, they say, designed to take you on a journey.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\n• What: Pop Evil unplugged\n\n• When: Doors open 6 p.m. Friday\n\n• Where: Club Envy, 441 W. Western, Muskegon\n\n• Admission: $16, clubenvymuskegon.com or at the door\n\n• More info: 231-760-4756\n\nProminent local drummer Aron Robinson (Deepfield) says Evil's current single, “Monster You Made,” is “huge.”\n\n“They’re definitely a national band now,” he nodded.\n\nFMQB, a music industry magazine, recently named Pop Evil its Best New Artist of 2011, and Revolver Magazine hailed Pop Evil as a \"band to watch.\" ESPN and the NHL have used their song \"Last Man Standing\" to promote sporting events.\n\nAlso since their last Muskegon show, the band has released a song called \"In the Big House,\" a rockin' melody about University of Michigan's football program (see below). Needless to say, the track snowballed and has been embraced by virtually the entire eastern part of the state.\n\n“We wanted to give a rock track back to the rock generation,” Kakaty elaborated. “It’s done the Michigan way — blue collar.”\n\nNow the band finds itself in the running for WGRD’s 2011 Best Band of the Year nod, but insists that “it’s an honor to be grouped with other bands in consideration.”\n\nHumble and perpetually hungry for rock 'n' roll, Pop Evil’s mantra of good intentions, wrapped up simply by stating that “Pop Evil is about helping people musically,” seems to be steering the band in the right direction. They take their shots and roll with the punches, but always fall forward.\n\n“No one (in the music business) gave us any favors, being from Muskegon,” stated Kakaty.\n\nTouring with headliners like Papa Roach, Three Doors Down, and Theory of a Deadman, the group finds itself gaining fame in a competitive business. Kakaty says he receives more than 100 emails daily, but “We’re doing the best we can with it. ... keeping our feet on the ground.”\n\nWith the wheels constantly spinning, Evil just released a deluxe version of “Angels” with a new song,\n\n“Unstoppable,” a tune about the obstacles they’ve had to overcome.\n\n“It’s a lot of work, but I wouldn’t have it any other way — working for yourself and what you believe in,” claims DiRito.\n\nRounding out the band’s Muskegon performance will be local star Tony Greve (from Whitehall) on lead guitar, Dave Grahs also on guitar and Chachi Riot filling in on drums."
