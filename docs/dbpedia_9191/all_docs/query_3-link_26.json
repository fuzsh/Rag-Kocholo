        "text": "Grammy® award-winning American composer Eric Whitacre’s symphonic work Deep Field was inspired by the world’s most famous space observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, and its greatest discovery – the iconic Deep Field image. The new film – Deep Field: The Impossible Magnitude of our Universe – illuminates the score by combining Hubble’s stunning imagery, including never-seen-before galaxy fly-bys, with bespoke animations to create an immersive, unforgettable journey from planet Earth to the furthest edges of our universe.\n\nThe soundtrack features a new, epic Virtual Choir representing 120 countries: over 8,000 voices aged 4 to 87, alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Eric Whitacre Singers.\n\nThe score and film paint the incredible story of the Hubble Deep Field. Turning its gaze to a tiny and seemingly dark area of space (around one 24-millionth of the sky) for an 11-day long period, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed over 3,000 galaxies that had never previously been seen, each one composed of hundreds of billions of stars. The film is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between Grammy® award-winning composer & conductor Eric Whitacre, producers Music Productions, scientists and visualizers from the Space Telescope Science Institute and multi award-winning artists 59 Productions.\n\nRelease Date: 16 November 2018\n\nComposer & Artistic Director\n\nEric Whitacre\n\nExecutive Producer\n\nMusic Productions\n\nMusic\n\nComposer & Conductor…….Eric Whitacre\n\nRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nEric Whitacre Singers\n\nVirtual Choir 5\n\nAudio Production\n\nProduced by…….John Powell\n\nRecorded by…….Mike Hatch, Floating Earth\n\nMixed by…….John Traunwieser\n\nMixed at 5 Cat Studios, Los Angeles CA\n\nVirtual Choir Editing by…….John Michael Caldwell\n\nFilm By\n\n59 Productions\n\nSpace Telescope Science Institute\n\nLabel: UNQUIET, UNQ011\n\nListen Here\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
