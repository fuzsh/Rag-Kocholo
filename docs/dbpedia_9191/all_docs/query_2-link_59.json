        "text": "Looking back on very exciting days with a pop-up show in Munich in empty & impressive halls of a bare brickwork with a total of 19 paintings by me on board, 18 of them on show, totally around 100 works of 10 artists among colleagues like Renate Graf, Alexander Iskin, Till Broenner, Georg Hendricks, Claus Rudolph, reiner xaver sedelmeier uvm. What I enjoyed most was tipping different paintings from different times and phases into a cup like dice and shaking them vigorously - some landed on the edge, some formed a double or a straight - and some I was able to display and view for the very first time hanging on a large white wall - seeing what and who they are and how many (cube) eyes they have. Thank you very much Duska & Michael from Artwalk & STAN Studios & all guests coming - we've rocked this halls! Image 1: (f. l. t. r.)

Degenhardt Hedwig Eberle Esther Freund Thomas Groetz Philipp Haager Paula Karoline Kamps Maja Körner Steffen Krüger Mehmet & Kazim Nanne Meyer John Newsom Sandra Ratkovic Matthias Schaufler David Schutter Anna Steinert Frank Stürmer Alexandra Tretter Wolfgang Voegele Grace Weaver Margaret Welsh Ulrich Wulff Josef Zekoff Jan Zöller Close-reading ancient lore, Giorgio Agamben has expounded that there are four deities which watch over the birth of man: “Daimon” epitomizing the predestined path of life, “Tyche” that of fortunate coincidence or unfortunate chance, “Eros” love itself and “Ananke” that of fate’s necessary inevitability. Be it sooner or later in life, everyone will have to come face-to-face with them. They are ambiguous powers and living one’s life under their guidance entails being in a constant state of “adventure.” This adventure is not a grandiose folly or mere escapism, quite the contrary, it is the fundamental condition of our existence. Yet, one can only endure this certain uncertainty, because there is a fifth goddess, Agamben argues, discreetly guiding our lives from the pitch-black bottom of Pandora’s box, where she was once left: “Elpis”, the embodiment of hope. Friendship, far from being an isolated relation of two individuals, is an equally fundamental condition. Most primordially it is a form of life able to create a communal space of conviviality, in which one will be recognized, in which experience can be shared. Closeness and affinity. Therefore, Secci Gallery is exceedingly please to present »daß die Göttin nicht himmelwärts, sondern herab nach ihren Freunden blickt« in Florence from MAR 1 to APR 6, 2024. The group exhibition is a testimony to friendship. It brings together 32 international artists from multiple generations, backgrounds and continents. It borrows its title from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s Italian Journey (1786–1788), who, while enjoying a painting by Titian, realized the exceptional relatedness of the spiritual and the human realms: »that the goddess does not gaze up, but down towards her friends.« And thanks to such friendships the exhibition – hopefully – contributes to »a world becoming wider and art more abundant«. »daß die Göttin nicht himmelwärts, sondern herab nach ihren Freunden blickt« concurs with André Butzer’s Florentine exhibitions Liebe, Glaube und Hoffnung at the Museo Novecento (March 1 – June 9, 2024) and »… und der Tod ist auch ein Leben.« at the Museo Stefano Bardini (March 22 – June 9, 2024). https://lnkd.in/eBgjhpMZ\n\nLudwigsburg - we are open! Thank you all for coming last thursday - what a tremendous opening. As a first glimpse the headliner of the show - see more roomshots coming soon. PHILIPP HAAGER Postcards from LB 18 Jan – 24 Feb 2024 Philipp Haager creates his colorful and atmospheric paintings by building up myriad layers of ink on wet cotton or linen. These membranes capture, align, condense, and retain countless pigment particles and water droplets, binding them up in the ink. The resultant color-space paintings oscillate between luminescence and opacity, located somewhere in the nexus of Color Field, Abstract Expressionist, and Impressionist landscape painting. In their content, meanwhile, the creations picture memory and event horizons—lying on your back, gazing up, carefree, at passing clouds; sitting by the water and watching the last ray of sunshine disappear below the horizon; or marveling at the constellations of the night sky. With the help of scientific instruments such as space telescopes and electron microscopes, the works further provide views into the far reaches of our universe, unimaginably old galaxies and microscopically small matter. The tiny and particular meets the immense and endless. Showing now PERG Gallery, Haager’s most recent paintings continue the Nearfield and Deep Field paintings series, made up of superimposed mementos including memory pictures and nebulae of postcards. Since his studies at the Städelschule in Frankfurt, the artist has given his pictures titles such as Asperg, Monrepos, and Bottwartal, popular excursion destinations in the “local recreation area” of his hometown of Ludwigsburg. The sites are depicted as motifs on countless postcards, but as such cannot reflect personal memories of and encounters with these places. The title of the exhibition, Postcards from LB, questions if postcards as an image carrier are still significant in an age defined by the exponentially growing flood of digital images. Haager posits that a painting—dedicated to a place, a certain mood there, or a person—might also fulfill this function as its installation shots are distributed, sent, and duplicated by the media through the digital world. A limited edition of postcards with different motifs will be published to accompany the exhibition. image: Nahfeld (Nearfield) Series, The Postcard Nebulae Asperg (Last summer’s sunset), 2024 140 x 140cm, Indian ink, unprimed canvas PERG Asperger Str. 12 D - 71634 Ludwigsburg #perg #ludwigsburg #exhibition #asperg #colourfield #painting #lastsummerssunset #philipphaager #postcardsfromlb"
