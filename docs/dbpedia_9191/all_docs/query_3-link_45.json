        "text": "Facing the challenge\n\nIndustry demands are constantly increasing and by calculating 3D profiles we are able to deliver a better visualization of features present in a pipeline. Higher prediction quality and cost reduction in pipeline dig up activities require higher reliability and resolution of in-line inspection (ILI). It is time to overcome the technical boundaries of magnetic flux leakage (MFL) technology and its methodical ambiguity because 3D profiling has not been available for ILI tools that use MFL technologies - until now: Our disruptive new technology integrates high-quality data from axial and circumferential MFL inspections via physics and mathematics concepts to provide laser-like 3D profiles of a metal loss feature.\n\nDuring the prototype phase of Virtual Dig Up, several challenges confirmed its reliability:"
