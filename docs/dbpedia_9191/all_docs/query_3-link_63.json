The new film – Deep Field: The Impossible Magnitude of Our Universe – illuminates the score by combining Hubble's stunning imagery, including never-seen-before galaxy fly-bys, with bespoke animations to create an immersive, unforgettable journey from planet Earth to the furthest edges of our universe. The soundtrack features a new, epic Virtual Choir representing 120 countries: over 8,000 voices aged 4 to 87, alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Eric Whitacre Singers.\n\nThe smartphone App playing the Deep Field electronica should be triggered by audience members from bar 217 to the end of the piece, as cued by the conductor.
