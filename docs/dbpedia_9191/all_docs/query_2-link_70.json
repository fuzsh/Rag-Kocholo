In 1106, after the death of Howell ap Gronw, Henry I granted these lands to his minister, Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, who erected a castle at the mouth of the Gwaendraeth Fach. This formed one of a series of Norman strongholds designed to secure their newly won conquests in South Wales and to command the passage of the rivers across which the road to the west passed. A mention of the hall of the Castle in a document of 1115 or earlier shows that the building of Kidwelly must have been practically completed by that year. During the rising which followed the death of Henry I, the Battle of Maes Gwenllian was fought a short distance away from the castle (1136).\n\nThe Welsh chronicles record that, in 1190, the Lord Rhys built the castle of Kidwelly. This entry probably reflects a native conquest of the settlement, but the NormanÕs must have recovered it before 1201, when Meredith, son of Rhys, was slain by the garrison of the castle. In 1215 Rhys Grug, another son of the Lord Rhys, captured Kidwelly and burnt the castle. He remained in possession until 1220, when Llywelyn the Great forced him to restore these conquests. The male line of the de Londres had become extinct during these troubles, and Kidwelly had passed to an heiress, Hawise. In 1225 she married Walter de Braose, who died during the campaign of 1233-4. Kidwelly Castle was by that date again in the possession of the Welsh as a result of the rising of 1231, when Llywelyn the Great, previously a supporter of the royal authority, had turned his arms against Henry III. Hawise de Londres, left a widow, was unable to regain possession of Kidwelly which, in 1242, was still held by Rhys's son Meredith. Two years later Hawise married Patrick de Chaworth, who seems to have recovered these lands soon after this date. The Welsh rising of 1257 involved the destruction of the settlement at Kidwelly, but the invaders failed to capture the castle.\n\nThe prominent part taken by Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, in the civil wars of Edward II's reign led to his execution after the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322, but the forfeited title\n\nand estates were later restored to his younger brother, Henry. The extinction of the male line in 1361 caused a temporary partition of the Lancastrian possessions, but on the death of the elder co-heiress, Matilda, in the following year, the whole inheritance fell to her sister Blanche, wife of John of Gaunt, who became Earl and later Duke of Lancaster. On the accession of Henry IV, Kidwelly, together with the other Lancastrian possessions, passed into the hands of the Crown, and was of little importance during the fifteenth century. Henry VII granted the castle to Sir Rhys ap Tudor, whose grandson Rhys ap Griffith forfeited it in 1531. Later it was again alienated and passed to the Earls of Cawdor. The castle had long ceased to be habitable, but certain repairs were carried out during the nineteenth century. In 1927 the owner placed the ruins under the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works (now the Department of the Environment).\n\nSince that date extensive works of preservation have been undertaken. In 1930 and 1931 excavations were carried out by Sir Cyril Fox and the writer in order to recover the earlier history of the castle. The results are embodied in the present guide, and the interesting series of relics recovered may be seen in the National Museum of Wales.\n\nThe earliest remains at Kidwelly, dating from the beginning of the twelfth century, are the semi-circular moat surrounding the castle together with the rampart under the outer curtain, the true meaning of which was revealed by the investigations of 1930-1. Of the hall mentioned in the deed of 1115 and the other buildings of the twelfth century no trace remains, though it is possible that an extensive search under the 2ft to 7ft of debris with which the whole interior of the castle was leveled in the early fourteenth century would lead to the recovery of their plan. The only tangible relic of Norman buildings is a small capital belonging to an attached column and probably forming part of a fireplace. This was found walled into the masonry of the hall of c1300, and may be ascribed to a date at the end of the twelfth century. The ramparts and moats surrounding the northern and southern outworks cannot be exactly dated, but analogy with other sites shows that they may well belong to this early period.\n\nThe oldest surviving masonry is that of the towers and the curtain enclosing the inner ward. This occupies a rectangular area with a circular tower at each angle. There are two gates, on the south and north sides, each protected by a portcullis. The erection of these defenses within the circuit of the original bank and stockade marks the beginning of the re fortification of the castle in accordance with the ideas of the late thirteenth century. The awkward way in which the two western towers are brought close to the foot of the earlier bank can only be understood when the pre-existence of this defense is relapsed, while the simple character of the gates, so different from the elaborate gatehouses of the normal concentric castle, must be similarly explained. The south-east tower was designed for occupation, but the hall and other structures of the earlier castle probably remained in use. Most of the dressed stonework of this period has disappeared, but the few remaining details are of thirteenth-century character, and this taken in conjunction with the plan suggests that the construction of the inner ward was carried out by Payn de Chaworth, c1275.\n\nKIDWELLY is one of the Norman foundations strung out along the coastal plain of South Wales. There is no evidence of any occupation before the grant to Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, and even if a small Celtic settlement existed, it has been without influence on the subsequent development of the site. Like many other Norman settlements, which were then continually threatened by a hostile attack from the mountains, Kidwelly stands\n\nat the head of an estuary where the river was still navigable at high tide. This situation ensured a line of communications when the castle was surrounded and the roads cut by a Welsh rising.\n\nThe settlement consists of two parts, the castle and the walled town on the west bank, and the priory church with the new town on the other side of the river. The two are joined by a two-arched bridge of fourteenth- or fifteenth-century date. This carried the great road to West Wales, probably replacing an earlier structure. Modern development has greatly altered the appearance of the new town, the last of the picturesque medieval houses having recently been destroyed (1931). The priory church of St. Mary was founded by Bishop Roger before 1115, and became a cell of the abbey of Sherborne. Such foundations are typical of the Norman settlements in South Wales, the alien monks being introduced as a counterpoise to the patriotic sentiments of the native monasteries, which too often served as focuses of anti-Norman feeling. The present building dates from the fourteenth century.\n\nFrom the bridge the road to the castle leads through the defenses of the old town. The walls have mostly disappeared, but the main gateway, apparently of early fourteenth-century date, still spans the road. The line of the defenses can still be traced by the earthen bank, which preceded the walls. It encloses about eight acres including the castle, which it surrounds on all sides except the east. A transverse ditch running west from the castle moat divides it into two nearly equal halves, of which it is probable that only the southern was walled. The defenses consist of an earth bank and ditch except on the east, where the steep scarp above the river formed a natural protection. The date of these ramparts is not certainly known, but as the walling of the southern part is to be connected with grants of murage, c1280, and the erection of the gatehouse during the following century, there is good reason for suggesting that they form part of the original Norman settlement.\n\nAlthough the medieval buildings within the walls have been replaced with modern houses, the line of the existing roads probably follows the original layout. Another feature of exceptional interest is the ruins of the medieval mill, which with the contemporary weir and leat can be traced on the low ground between the old town and the river. At a comparatively modern date this was replaced by a more efficient type of mill, which in its turn is now disused.\n\nOur Walter Dalton must have visited this great castle many times. As you can see by the\n\nPicture, the castle is next to the Township of Kidwelly!\n\nAfter Walter Dalton and his surviving family settled down at Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, South Wales, his financial position appears to be good and he sent his son James to the Inns of Court of London where he qualified as a barrister-at-law. James, probably through both the VaughanÕs and Dalton connections, acquired the post of Receiver for the Duchy of Lancaster, which was in turn held by his eldest son John. Another son, Richard become Sheriff.\n\nWhy Walter Dalton should have gone to South Wales can be explained on several logical grounds. In the maps showing the balance of forces in the Civil War, Wales was almost entirely Royalist. Kidwelly and Monmouth were ancient Lordships of the Crown. Llanstephan and Langharne were others. The Lancashire influence was strong, which was\n\nthe ancestral home of the DaltonÕs, and the king had strong ties in South Wales. William Ashburnham was a Major General in the Royalist cause and John Ashburnham was in personal attendance to the King. The DaltonÕs and the AshburnhamÕs would later in Wales have many dealings with each other. Rowland Vaughan Jr. was with Walter at the Battle of Worcester and was his good friend. WalterÕs son James later married the daughter of Rowland Vaughan Jr. The VaughanÕs were a large and wealthy family in South Wales. South Wales is known as ÒThe land of a hundred castlesÓ.\n\nHere is some of whatÕs in Walter Dalton IIIÕs Will:\n\nNote: I have copies of all the wills listed in this chapter.\n\nWalter Dalton, Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, Wales, Gentleman\n\nDate of Will: 12- 3- 1666\n\nProbate Date: 5 - 26 - 1666\n\nWalter Dalton of Penbre Parish, by his will dated 12 Mar. 1666, proved 25 May 1666, & witnessed by Richard Brown & Robert Fisher, of Kidwelly, gave to St. Davids Cathedral 4d to the poor of Penbre parish 4 bushels of barley: to his niece Mary Hoskins, some cattle on the lower Burrows, a silver beaker &: to his nephew Walter Hoskins some cattle on the Lower Burrows, and to the same Mary & Walter, some more cattle that were relicts left of their fathers goods after his debts were paid,\" to be equally divided between them.

Pembrey is a name derived from the hill or ridge, which overlooks the village and juts out in a southwesterly direction towards Carmarthen Bay. Penbre the Welsh form is precise in its meaning, 'Pen' meaning head or end and 'bre' meaning ridge or hill.\n\nThe church is dedicated to St. Illtyd, who it is believed lived about 450 to 525 A.D., during the Age of Saints 5th to 8th Centuries; although not canonised his festival is celebrated on 6th November. It is generally accepted that he was an Amorican, a native of Brittany in Northern France. He was a well-known scholar and teacher at the monastery of Llanilltyd Fawr or Llantwit Major in Glamorganshire, then a famous centre of learning in biblical studies, law, literature and medicine. One of his disciples or followers may have named the original church after him.\n\nDuring the Age of Saints hundreds of devout and saintly men journeyed throughout Wales teaching and preaching the Christian message and helping the needy. Usually one of them would eventually settle in a particular place and preach to the local people from the most suitable spot, rise or mound; this chosen spot or enclosure gradually came to be regarded as hallowed ground, known in Welsh as 'Llan'. In time a simple crude church of wattle and timber would be established within the enclosure and the saint's name added to the 'Llan', resulting in hundreds of place names in Wales beginning with Llan, as in Llanelli and Llandeilo.\n\nNo exact date can be given for the foundation or building of the church, but it is one of several churches in this area mentioned in the 'Liber Landavensis' or 'Book of Llandaff' which dates from about 1066- 71. It also names three priests serving at that time in Pembrey, namely Cadfor, Gwrhi and Sedd. Pembrey parish was then in the diocese of Llandaff, with Herwald as bishop. It was he who consecrated the church and ordained the forementioned three priests. For several hundred years this church in common with other: churches in England and Wales owed allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church until the reign of Henry VIII, who declared himself head of the Anglican or English Church and ended all papal authority.\n\nBefore we continue with the histories of Walter DaltonÕs descendent's in South Wales, here is a description of some of the place nameÕs they lived in.\n\nClog-y-fran: home of John Dalton and Mary Powell in early 18th Century.\n\nCourt House: (Cwrt Pen bre): home of the Dalton's in early 18th Century.\n\nDalton's Point: headland on the north coast of Gower.\n\nGellygatrog: home of the Morris Family into which the Dalton's married. in particular, Joyce Dalton, daughter of Edward Dalton of Llanelly, married James Morris of Gellygatrog.\n\nGlasfryn: A home of the Beven family into which the Dalton's married.\n\nHurst House: possible site of Host House where the Powell family lived.

Two of its main sources were Coed Rhial (Royal Wood) and Coed Marchog (KnightÕs Wood); both woods have an ancient association with the Manorial lands of Pembrey Court, which was part of the Norman Lordship of Kidwelly. The coal was mined from a variety of outlets, including bell pits, adit mines, levels and slants, particularly from Coed Rhial.\n\nIt is worth noting here that Coed Marchog (rear of Butchers Arms) off the Pinged road is overlooked by the precipitous craggy western face of the famous Garreg Lwyd (Grey Rock). This was a traditional pilgrimage site for local children on Good Friday, for the twin purposes of sliding on the long smooth rock and to gather bunches of blue-bells from the adjacent hill. The rock is known to have been a prehistoric defensive settlement. A fierce fire during the prolonged hot summer of 1976 (which destroyed the Forestry\n\nCommission conifers and also the undergrowth on the rock hill) exposed some interesting defensive features. Excavations by the Dyfed Archaeological Trust in 1977 indicated that it was a settlement and that there were some \"finds\" of at least the \"Early Iron Age\".\n\nA section of the 1796-1818 Canal, from Pinged Road to Ty Mawr. Although overgrown, the canal is still well defined and the original towpath is now a public footpath.\n\nDetails of all coal experts between 1714 and 1721 have been recorded in a ledger by the brothers John and James Dalton, who were then joint estate agents of the Ashburnham Pembrey Estate. All the coal was carried by pack horses, and continued to be so carried for many years afterwards, from Coed Rhial and Coed Marchog and other nearby mines, to the Gwendraeth Fawr River estuary for export in small sailing ships. The vessels carried the coal to ports in Devon, Cornwall, Ireland and France.\n\nTowards the end of the 1700s, Lord Ashburnham (2nd Earl 1724-1812) perhaps enviously inspired by the success of KymerÕs Canal, from Kidwelly to Carway, decided to build a canal from near the coal mines to the Gwendraeth estuary. The canal would enable a far greater amount of coal to be shipped, and would allow Lord Ashburnham to dispense with the slow and costly pack horses and their owners, known as hauliers. All the hauliers fiercely opposed the plan, as they realized that they would lose their livelihood, but in spite of their opposition the building of the canal began in 1796. It started from a field near Waun-cae-Philip, below Coed Farm, off the Pinged to Pembrey road, and continued towards Ty Mawr Farm, then across Pinged Marsh (present R.A.F. and Motor Sport area) and, by 1801, ended at Pill Tywyn on the river estuary. Two shipping places and a dry dock had been built there by 1817. In 1805, a branch canal of 300 to 400 yards to the Ffrwd Farm was added. The canal was 1- ½ miles long with no locks, it cost and the size of its barges are unknown. During the canalÕs \"life\", there was no railway (1852) nor main road (1850) to cross, but several agricultural access bridges were built across the canal. It was not used after 1818, as the mines had become exhausted.Ó\n\nAs you read in the above paragraph, members of the Dalton family were Agents for the Ashburnham Pembrey Estate, so they witnessed quite a few leases. Details of all coal experts between 1714 and 1721 have been recorded in a ledger by the brothers, John and James Dalton.\n\n\"Local resident agents administered the Pembrey estate on behalf of the Ashburnhams.\n\nCharles Dalton, who lived at Pen y bedd, appears to have started as agent, from about 1656, for the Pembrey Vaughans, but after the marriage of Bridget Vaughan to John Ashburnham, in 1677, he became agent for the Ashburnhams. He was followed by his two sons John and James, who remained as agents until at least 1724. The brothers lived at Caldicot Farm, which is referred to as early as 1282. Caldicot sometimes was also called Cornel Mawr or Tywyn Point, which is the western end of Cefn Sida Sands.\"\n\n\"The brothers John and James Dalton, in a meticulously kept accounts book, recorded about 700 shipments of coal dispatched from the parish between 1714 and 1721. Each vessel's name, Master, home port, weight of cargo and cost was noted. Coal was regularly sent to Devon and Cornwall, Appledore, Northam, Falmouth, Barnstaple, Clovelly and St. Ives. Dublin and France are also mentioned. The main coal source was the Coed Rhial and Brindias areas on the western side of Pembrey mountain, and the coal was carried by pack horses to the Gwendraeth estuary to be loaded on the waiting vessels.\"\n\n\"Detailed records were kept by Lord Ashburnham of all aspects of farming and the other activities on the estates. Terse reminders were sent to the Dalton brothers, his Pembrey agents, that the rents were due and were to be paid in full and punctually every six months, on Lady Day, March 16th and Michaelmas Day, Sept. 29. One such note reads;\" Why Mr. Dalton, the way to remove my displeasure is to pay me up all you owe me, on other way can ever do it\"\n\nNote: In the about statements it tells us the ÒThe sons of Charles DaltonÓ I believe this to be wrong, as I have found no names of the sons of Charles Dalton.

Mr. Jones assisted in preparing their only son for the ministry; and when the youth left home for the University of Oxford he gave him such very excellent counsel, and prayed so cordially with him, both in the family and in private, that this child of many prayers.

Walter Vaughan lived at Pembrey in 1653, he married Alice Bond daughter of Thomas Bond and sister of George Bond of Ogbourn, Wiltshire.\n\nWalter died in 1660, and of several children, only one survived Bridget. Bridget sole heiress of Pembrey and last of the Vaughans, married John Ashburnham of Sussex, in Westminster Abbey on the 14 July 1687, when the Manor of Pembrey became the Lordship of Ashburnham. They lived at the Sussex seat, with occasional visits to the Welsh estates.\n\nJohn Ashburnham died at Bloomsbury on 21 January 1709 aged 44.

The last two both died young.\n\n7. Thomas in Holy Orders, died single.\n\nThe HISTORY of JAMES DALTON, 1650-1721:\n\nJames Dalton, the fifth child of Walter Dalton III, and Jane Needham was born in Curbridge, a little village just west of Witney, Oxfordshire England. James had 9 brothers and sisters. James Dalton was only 1 year old when his father had to pack up and leave the Witney area after the defeat of the Royalist forces at the Battle of Worcester in Sept. of 1651.\n\nJames Dalton was only 1 year-old when he took the long and terrible journey through one of the worst winters in history, where three of JamesÕs brothers died during the trip, little James and his family arrived in South Wales and settled near Kidwelly. Some time later\n\nthe Dalton Family moved to Pembrey, which is only 5 miles from Kidwelly. Pembrey in the 1700's only had about 20 houses, and most of these were farms, Pembrey today is still a small place, the old Church is still standing and there are 3 public houses, one paper shop, one small store, and that is all.\n\nThe History of Pembrey Court or Court farm, Pembrey:\n\nOn a slope overlooking the western approach to the Village of Pembrey was Court Farm. This manor was held by the Butler family as early as 1361, and remained in their hands until the early part of the 16th Century when it passed by the marriage of the Butler heiress, to the family of Vaughan of Bredwardine and Dunraven.\n\nOur Dalton family has a long history with this farm and Manor, having been tennets and Estates Agents for the Lord Ashburnham family. We can believe that some of our Dalton members actually lived in part of this very large Manor house.\n\nWalter Vaughan of Pembrey Court was High Sheriff in 1557, and his son Thomas served the same office in 1566 and 1570. The Vaughans in due course ended without male heirs and the mansion and estate came to Bridget Vaughan, sole heiress, who married John Ashburnham of Sussex in 1677, and thereafter remained in her Ashburnham descendants. Ashburnham made a tour of his wife's extensive Welsh estates in 1687, and noted in his journal that he had seen Pembrey House, which is an old stone house, large enough, and kept in pretty good repair. Two years later he was raised to the peerage as Baron Ashburnham. The third Baron was advanced to the dignity of Earl of Ashburnham in 1730.\n\nThe original caput of the manor of Pembrey was probably the mound castle now called 'the Twmpath' which is located about a mile and a half to the north-east of Burry Port Station. This tumulus is 100 feet in diameter, with a ditch about 12 feet wide and about 5 feet deep surrounding it.\n\nThe Twmpath has extensive views, but at some stage it became inconvenient and the caput of the manor was relocated to the site of the present Pembrey Court (Pen + bre meaning the top or end of a hill). The manor house is also known locally as Court Farm or simply Court or, in Welsh, as Cwrt Penbre or Cwrt-y-dre.\n\nThis location is about half a mile north of the church of Pembrey, next to the present Mountain Road that climbs up towards Penllwyn Uchaf and the uplands of Mynydd Penbre (Pembrey Mountain). However, Pembrey Court was originally approached by means of the Ffordd Fawr (the Big Road) which now forms the public footpath immediately below the house and which exits at Danlan Road, Pembrey.\n\nA knight's service to his lord consisted of: aids, relief, wardship, marriage and escheat and some of these feudal obligations were recorded at the Court of Foreignry, held at Kidwelly, where the jurors returned that:\n\nThe manor of Pembrey was held under the lord of Kidwelly by military service of one knight's fee; John Boteler was to do suit of court monthly 'at the Court of Foreignry of Kedewelly'; the lord of Kidwelly was to have wardship and marriage; in time of war John Boteler was to provide five archers to follow the lord so far as the limit of the 'Patrie' (ie\n\nthe lordship) for one day according to custom; tenants were to pay 10 shillings to the lord by the hands of the Beadle of Penrhyn; and the nativi were to give a day's ploughing to the lord at 2 pence and 1 penny for food, and to help with the hay for one day.\n\nNear Pembrey Court is an open strip of land locally known as the Llathed Fain, or Narrow Yard. There are three such fields in the parish of Pembrey, and two on Court land. The one near the house is one furlong long by one chain (220 yards) wide and was granted or leased by the lord of the manor to a favoured yeoman or servant, who marked-out his new territory with a hedge.\n\nThe John Butler lineage and its extinction with Anne Butler:\n\nThe Butlers favoured the Christian name John and no less than six John Butlers succeeded each other to the Pembrey and Dunraven estates.\n\nMembers of the Butler family married into other key Norman families in south Wales, including the de Londres, de la Bere, Tuberville and Cantelupe families.\n\nThe Butler link with Pembrey Court ended when Anne Butler, daughter of John Butler and Jane Basset of Beaupre, in Glamorgan, married Sir Richard Vaughan who became Sheriff of Bredwardine in Herefordshire (originally Breconshire) in 1530, and who was a descendent of the illustrious Moreiddig Warwyn, Lord of Brycheiniog.\n\nAfter the marriage, Sir Richard went to live with his wife at Dunraven Castle where their son, Walter, was born in 1500.\n\nThe Vaughan family and Pembrey Court:\n\nSir Richard Vaughan built the present Pembrey Court as a wedding gift for Sir Walter in about 1530.\n\nEvidence suggests that the Vaughan's L-shaped house was built eight feet away from the Butler's original first floor hall and that the two buildings were later fused into one dwelling by the addition of a two-story porch wing on the south side.\n\nSir Walter Vaughan was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1557 and had two sons, Thomas and Charles. Thomas succeeded to the Bredwardine, Dunraven and Pembrey estates upon the death of Sir Walter, in 1578. At that time the estates had a yearly value of £1,500, and to them Thomas later added the Fallersdon estate in Wiltshire.\n\nThomas became a justice of the peace and High Sheriff (1566 and 1570) for Carmarthenshire, and had two sons, Walter and John, who lived on the Fallersdon and Dunraven estates.\n\nAs the eldest son, Walter inherited the Vaughan estates. After Walter's death George, his eldest son by his second wife, succeeded him.\n\nSir George Vaughan was a keen Royalist. In 1648 he was imprisoned by Cromwell at Southwark, in London, and fined the huge sum of £2,609 by the Parliamentary party for 'delinquency'. The fine meant that Sir George had to sell the Dunraven estate for £600 in\n\n1649 and thereafter the Fallersdon estate.\n\nIn 1651 the Parliamentary party also confiscated the Pembrey estate, which was only returned when the monarchy was restored.\n\nSir George died without any legal issue, and so his younger brother, the Reverend Frederick Vaughan, succeeded to the family estates. Frederick was blinded by smallpox not long after birth and lived at Gussage in Dorset and Salisbury.\n\nFrederick's son, Walter, lived at Pembrey Court and Porthaml mansion. Walter married Alice, daughter of Thomas Bond, and they had a daughter, Bridget, who was born in 1660.\n\nIn 1661 Walter died (one year before his father) and in 1665 Alice married William Ball, a London lawyer of Grey's Inn, who became High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1682.\n\nWilliam Ball died in 1701, leaving Bridget Vaughan as the sole heiress of Pembrey Court.\n\nDuring the reign of Charles II, when portraiture was fashionable, the painters Van Dyke, Lely and Reynolds passed through Pembrey Court, and were kept busy painting portraits of members of the Vaughan family.\n\nOne of Pembrey Court's more impressive architectural features are the seven tall chimneys, made up of five single stacks and two diagonal twin stacks.\n\nThese reflect a house of substance with many hearths, but the 1672 Hearth Tax records the house as having only two fireplaces.\n\nAs an economy measure, many of the original fireplaces were blocked up in order to avoid paying Hearth Tax at the then substantial rate of two shillings per hearth.\n\nOn 22 July 1677, Bridget Vaughan married John Ashburnham of Ashburnham, Sussex, who became Baron Ashburnham on 20 May 1689.\n\nThe Ashburnham family had started out as modest Sussex gentry, but within a hundred years they had acquired extensive estates in Bedfordshire, Suffolk, Lancashire and Wales.\n\nJohn Ashburnham was Member of Parliament for Hastings on three occasions, and was Custos Rotulorum of Breconshire. The family lived in Sussex, but paid occasional visits to Wales.\n\nOn a visit to Pembrey Court on Sunday 3 July 1687, John Ashburnham noted in his diary:-\n\n\"I saw Pembrey House (Court), which is an old stone house, large enough and kept in pretty good repair. The land hereabouts is very good.\"\n\nThe blocking up of the windows:\n\nIn 1697 the government introduced a window tax of three shillings per window, and in\n\norder to reduce the amount of tax payable, the Ashburnham estate arranged for many of Pembrey Court's stone and wooden mullion windows to be blocked up.\n\nWindow tax was repealed in 1851, but the large windows on the west of the house have remained blocked to the present day.\n\nThe Mansel and Dalton families:\n\nAfter the death of William Ball, Pembrey Court was leased to Rawleigh Mansel of Beaulieu (in Llangunnor parish) and was clearly marked on Kitchen's map of 1701 as 'Court, Mansel, Esq.'\n\nRawleigh Mansel was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1679 and, according to The Red Dragon (1886) he went to live at Pembrey Court:\n\n\"Thoroughly repairing that old mansion for the purpose, and lived there for three or four years, and died there on 27 November 1702 in his 73rd year\"\n\nRawleigh Dawkin Mansel succeeded his grandfather to the lease of Pembrey Court, and during the latter period of his tenancy the house was divided into two units. Walls were added or removed, several doors and windows were blocked and new ones opened, additional stairs were fitted and at least two attic rooms were added.\n\nRawleigh Dawkin Mansel was High Sheriff for Carmarthenshire in 1730 and died 'under the agonizing pains of the Gout' in his 44th year in 1749.\n\nAfter the end of the Mansel's lease, the Pembrey estate was looked after by a series of estate agents, stewards and water bailiffs. They were also responsible for the disposal of wrecks and cargoes found along the coast.\n\nThe agents included three generations of the Dalton family, who appear to have come from Whitney in Oxfordshire, and some of whom are buried in Pembrey churchyard.\n\nJohn Ashburnham died at his London residence in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, on 21 January 1709-10 aged 44. His eldest son, William, succeeded him as second baron but died of smallpox on 16 June 1710.\n\nThe Ashburnham estate then passed to his brother John, who became third baron.\n\nOn 14 May 1730, John became Viscount St Asaph of the Principality of Wales and Earl of Ashburnham (a viscount being one step up in rank from the lowest rank of baron). He died on 10 March 1736-7 at the age of 49 and his only son, John, succeeded to the estate as second Earl.\n\nThe second Earl died on 8 April 1812 aged 87 and his only son, George Ashburnham, succeeded as third Earl.\n\nIn 1813, George Ashburnham took legal action to bar the entail of his Pembrey estate so that he could regain the freehold.\n\nAfter that he could mortgage the estate, which he did on 15 June 1824, together with his\n\nother Carmarthenshire and Breconshire properties.\n\nLord Lovaine and Robert Vyner, Esq. of Gautby, Lincolnshire were the mortgagees, and the loan was £19,403,4s, 6d.\n\nGeorge Ashburnham died on 27 October 1830 and his son Bertram became fourth Earl.\n\nWhen visiting the Pembrey estates George Ashburnham usually stayed at Pembrey House, which the family had built on the slope to the north east of Pembrey church in 1823. The house was occasionally let, with rooms being reserved for family use.\n\nIn 1831 Mr. Edward Driver, a surveyor, made a \"Survey and Valuation of the Manor of Pembrey and Estate\" on behalf of Bertram Ashburham.\n\nAt this time, Pembrey Court comprised 194 acres plus 12 acres of marshland, tenanted by Mr John Thomas (later succeeded by his son Hugh) who paid a yearly rent of £88.10s.\n\nMr John Thomas occupied a part of the mansion, whilst a Mr. T.E. Biederman occupied the other part.\n\nMr. Driver reported as follows:\n\n\"One portion of the Old Court House is occupied by Mr. Biederman. The other portion comprises a very good large kitchen, small cellar, old Entrance Hall, a parlour not inhabitable but now undergoing repairs and filling up, and a new staircase has been lately made to lead to two new formed bedrooms. At the back of the House is a range of offices comprising (besides some held by Mr. Biederman) a dairy and a cheese loft. A newly erected cowhouse and stable with slated roof, and enclosed yard. Adjoining the House is a good barn with cowhouse; coach-house at the end, hereafter described, and held by Mr. Biederman; a stock yard with cowhouse, and another barn, slated, and a lean-to carthouse, thatched, at the backÉ\"\n\nLater in the survey, Mr. Driver wrote:\n\n\"Part of the Court House and buildings, heretofore generally used by the Agent, but for the last 3 or 4 years was occupied by his brother and T. E. Biederman. The buildings comprise the old Court House, and was formerly a good residence; it is stone built with slated roof; part has been kept for the accommodation of the Agent to the Estate, and this is now occupied, and has so been for 3 or 4 years by Mr T. E. Biederman, and consists of the large principal room, now subdivided, leaving a good Parlor, a bedroom without a fireplace, and a passage leading to another bedroom; another bedroom, kitchen, and small scullery, and a small bedroom for a servant; a cellar under a part; coalhouse and room over; and a coach-house at the end of the barn; a stable in two divisions for four horses: all the above occupied by Mr. Biederman.\"\n\nThe Tithe Schedule and map dated 7 June 1839 shows Pembrey Court with 209 acres, a slight increase in landholding since the survey of Mr Driver, with Mr. John Thomas as tenant.\n\nGenerations of the Thomas family had tenanted Pembrey Court, from around 1738 to\n\n1902, and most of their baptisms, marriages and burials are recorded in the Pembrey church registers\n\nThe enterprising Thomas family undertook a number of different activities. They were farmers, butchers, shopkeepers, and ship owners. David Thomas was also well known in the locality as a self-taught bonesetter.\n\nThe 1878 Ordnance Survey map includes the first known ground plan of Pembrey Court.\n\nThe map indicates Pembrey Court as an L-shaped structure, with two wings enclosing a courtyard in the rear. Nearby, on the south side, is the barn. A large enclosed garden is outlined together with the Court Wood (said to have been planted by the Vaughans).\n\nRoof alterations at Pembrey Court;\n\nDuring its early period, Pembrey Court had a high, open trussed roof, visible from the floor of the main hall and of an elaborate design, with double roll and hollow moulding.\n\nBredwardine Court and Porthaml Mansion, two other ancestral homes of the Vaughans, have similar roofs.\n\nUnfortunately, part of the original roof of Pembrey Court was lowered and flattened during alterations made during the 1800s, and the carved ornamental detail of the original trussed roof was lost.\n\nIn addition, the original stone tiles, which needed a more steeply pitching roof, were replaced with Caernarvon slates (as reported in Mr. Driver's survey), and the roof valleys were finished off with lead flashing.\n\nIn the returns of Owners of Land in 1873, Bertram Ashburnham is shown as having substantial estates in Wales, with 5,685 acres producing an estimated annual rental of £3,547 in Carmarthenshire, and 1,881 acres producing an estimated annual rental of £1,963 in Breconshire. In Sussex, the family seat, 14,051 acres produced £13,069.\n\nBertram Ashburnham died on 22 June 1878 aged 80. His eldest of seven sons, also named Bertram, succeeded as fifth Earl and actively participated in the development of industry in Pembrey. He died in 1913 leaving an only child, Lady Mary Cathleen Charlotte Ashburnham.\n\nThe title thus passed to his younger brother, Thomas, the sixth and last Earl of Ashburnham, who had married Maria Elizabeth Anderson of Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada in 1903. By 1897 the mortgage debt on the Welsh properties had increased to £87,600 and in order to repay the loan, the Porthaml estate was sold in 1913 and the Pembrey estate in 1922.\n\nThomas Ashburnham died without issue on 12 May 1924, leading to the extinction of the Ashburnham title.\n\nBy 1902 the last of the Thomas family had left Pembrey Court and, in about 1902, William Bonnell (senior) and family became the new tenants, and the house once again\n\nbecame a single dwelling.\n\nThe Bonnell family farmed Pembrey Court until August 1922, when the whole of the Ashburnham Estate was sold.\n\nAt the auction, Mr William Bonnell (senior) purchased Penllwyn Uchaf Farm and thereafter vacated Pembrey Court.\n\nMr James Butler of Theorchy bought Pembrey Court at the auction of the Ashburnham estate in 1922.\n\nThe manor was then let to the family of Mr Sidney Thomas. They remained as tenants after the death of Mr Butler, in 1937, and the purchase of the manor by Mr Charles Harding from the Links, Pembrey.\n\nMr Harding bought Pembrey Court as a business proposition. He developed the Garreg Lwyd quarries, located on Court land, as a brickworks, and used material from the quarry for his brick mixture.\n\nThe brickwork project failed when the brick making machinery ran into technical difficulties. Probably as a result of these activities, a large front section of the quarry collapsed.\n\nIn 1942 Mr Harding sold Pembrey Court to Mr William Bonnell (Junior).\n\nHowever, the Thomas family remained as tenants until about 1948, after which Pembrey Court was left empty.\n\nMr William Bonnell (Junior) continued to live at Penllwyn Uchaf Farm until his death in January 1962 and during this time Pembrey Court was used for storage.\n\nOn the death of Mr William Bonnell (Junior), Pembrey Court passed to his younger brother, Mr Owen Bonnell. He died in January 1976 and the Court then passed to his nephew, Mr John Bonnell Davies, who remains the present owner.\n\nSource of above article is: The National Trust of Wales. www.sirgaerfyrddin.com/history\n\nInformation about the Pembrey area:\n\nCopied from the web pages of the Carmarthenshire Historical Society.\n\nThe Landscape from Llanelli via Pwll, Burry Port (which was known only as Towyn Bach at the time) Pembrey and on to Kidwelly, has changed considerably during the last two hundred years. Mainly because of manÕs will to build harbors and change river courses during this time, and the receding seas from this part of the world (whereas on the East coast of the United kingdom the sea is reclaiming the land) have all helped to change the coastline of the Burry Estuary to a shallow inlet barely navigable except at high water.\n\nThe sea at Stradey used to reach what is now known as Stradey Bridge at high tide and almost up to Pembrey road as far as Pwll which was a Rabbit warren, A road ran from Pwll to Achddu which was basically a dirt track, this was the main road, there was a pedestrian track over the burrows to PwH there was also a track from the main road from\n\nPwll to the sheep pastures at Towyn Bach, this is now called Church Road and Elkington Road similar, from the sheep pastures (the sheep pastures stretched from Dafad-ty (meaning sheep fold) to the Derwydd in the West) at Towyn Bach another track lead to the Derwydd and farther onward to Pembrey Village. From the end of PembreyMountain West as far as the Gwendraeth River was a long stretch of sand hills called Towyn Mawr and Towyn Canol which were littered with rabbit burrows. A part of the these low lands (flats) were being worked as farms named 'TowyrfÕ, 'Pen-y-Bedd' and 'Pwll- du'. The shortest way to Kidwelly was over the burrows to the point where the river Gwendraeth was crossed by a ford, this ford was used until the Commissioners Bridge was built in 1842, which is still known as 'Pont-y-Rhyd (Bridge over the ford).\n\nFrom the end of Pembrey Village (where the Butchers Arms now stands) to Kidwelly and as far as Lldyry were known as the the ÒPinged MarshesÓ which were flooded at high tides, Further East and South of Towyn Bach (Now Burry Port) were the ÔBacauÕ or marsh lands which was covered by the sea at high tides.\n\nPembrey Village was still very small and mainly centered around St. Illtyd's Church with farms scattered around, further along towards 'Towyn Bach' was 'Gors Farm and further north only a few farms existed and some cottages on the Graig. The whole of Pembrey Parish only had 1455 inhabitants in 1801, and LLanelli Parish only 2972, of the 2972 inhabitants of Llanelli Parish in 1801, it is stated that in 1795 less than 500 people lived in Llanelli Town. In comparison Pembrey Parish had 6448 and Llanelli Parish 32,034 inhabitants in 1891.\n\nAlthough 1800 seemed to be the turning point of Carmarthenshires introduction into the Industrial Revolution, Industrial development did not arrive overnight, intact industry had arrive in Trimsaran as early as 1540 in the shape of coal mining and shortly after at Pinged. A small Brewery was started in Llanelli in 1700, later to become Buckleys Brewery. Kidwelly lower tinplate works was founded in 1734, and in 1766 'Kyrners' Canal was built at Kidwelly, which was the first Canal in Wales. A Dock was also constructed at Kidwelly in 1766, Achddu Mill was built in 1770, the 'Wem' iron-foundry was established by Yaldon in 1784 in Llanelli, and by 1797 Eleven Coal Pits were mentioned in the Llanelli area. All the above industry had arrived before 1800 on the north coast of the Burry Inlet, between Llanelli and Kidwelly, and after 1800 the industry was about to change the way local inhabitants had lived for hundreds of years, and without doubt the Industrial Revolution changed the shape of the Burry Inlet Coastline.\n\nBefore 1815, West Wales had two Mail Coaches Daily: One from London Via Gloucester, Brecon. and Carmarthen Another from London, via Bristol, Swansea, Pontardulais, and Carmarthen. Llanelli was not on the main line from London to Carmarthen, because at that time the Loughor Bridge had not been built, and Llanelli was a long way off the main route. Local coach services did run via Llanelli, the route was Swansea, Pontardulais, Llanelli, Carmarthen and back. The Coach fare to Swansea was 3 shillings and to Carmarthen 4 shillings. Poor people obviously could not afford to travel by Coach, they would either walk, or travel by stage wagon, if they ever traveled at all, they would then sleep in the straw and hay at the inns they came across on there travels.\n\nCanals were the best means of transportation, as they could transport large amounts of merchandise from one place to another reasonably quickly compared to the horse and cart on uneven unkempt roads which were not very good at all.\n\nThe first canal was the Kymer Canal. Thomas Kymer Originally from Pembroke obtained permission to build a Canal from Kidwelly Quay to Pwllyllygod, which is near Carway. The Canal was said to have opened in 1769, from then until 1800 Kidwelly appears to have grown as a small port and shipbuilding town.\n\nThe Earl of Ashburnham Canal started at a coal level at Ffrwd near Pembrey, with a shorter branch built later at Coed, and served also by tramroads to other collieries near Pembrey, from there it ran straight to the far side of Kidwelly-Llanelli road, and then turned sharply to take it into what was later called Swan Pool Drain, and on to a creek called Till Towyd on the south side of the Gwendraeth Fawr. This Canal was built around about 1796.\n\nIt had been suggested around about 1793 to build a Canal with nine locks up the Gwendraeth Fawr valley to a point below Pontyberem. And a Canal branch from Spudders Bridge on Kymer's Canal to Llanelly. But the work on this Canal was delayed for some considerable time and was probably started at around 1815. The Canal was to run from Kymer's Canal at Spudders Bridge to Penn-y-Bedd on the way to Pembrey with a lock at 'Ty-Mawr'. This line passed the end of 'Bowser's' level and ended at a junction with the 'Earl of Ashburnham' Canal about half a mile from FFrwd. From this 'Spudder's Bridge' - 'Pen-y-Bedd' line a short branch about three-eighths of a mile long to Moat Farm which was continued to Trimsaran Colliery by a tramroad. Lastly, from a point near the top end of Kymer's Canal, the company extended their line up the river valley with two locks to Pontyates, at these points construction stopped for many years probably because of lack of money. Eventually in about 1825 when the New Harbour was built at what is now Burry Port, the canal was extended to end at the New Harbour.\n\nPembreyÕs Old Harbour was built in 1819 and towards the end of 1823 a private canal was began by Gaunt & Co. It was about two miles long with one lock near Penn-y-Bedd, and ran to a point about 400 yards from Pembrey Old Harbour, too the Pier it was connected by a tram-road, with branches of tram-road connecting the Harbour along a specially built embankment for about half a mile northwards to Pembrey New Pit.\n\nSource: Richard James. Carmarthenshire FHS, Llanelli, Wales.\n\nEnd.\n\nWe start again with our story of James Dalton who lost his father, Walter at the age of 16. What did this do to a young man whom now had to support himself and provide for his future career as a Barrister-at-Law.\n\nJames survived because he was an able and attractive young man who enlisted the sympathies of those who knew him, and that won him the hand of his future wife, Joyce\n\nVaughan, who was the daughter of Rowland Vaughan Jr. who was a friend of JamesÕ father. James Dalton and Joyce Vaughan married sometime in 1677 and with it the eventual possession of Caldicot House, on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean\n\nThis gave James Dalton the support of the famous Vaughan family. And then the\n\ntitle to the Vaughans land at Caldicot farms. Joyce Vaughan is thought to be of the Vaughan Family of Trimsaran, which is only a few miles from Pembrey.\n\nSome history about the Vaughan family and Joyce Vaughan:\n\nAs Sir Walter Vaughan (knighted in 1603 son of Thomas Vaughan) had decided to live on his Fullerston Estate, rather than Pembrey Court, which was then unoccupied, he agreed to allow his nephew Rowland Vaughan Sr., the fourth son of his brother John, to live at the Court until the next Vaughan heir, Rowland Jr. was old enough to occupy it. Rowland Vaughan Sr. has married Anne, the daughter of Sir Francis Mansel, Bart of Muddlescombe. After Rowland Vaughan Sr. departure from the Court, it was occupied by Charles Vaughan (Sir in 1608) son of Sir Walter by his first wife, but after living at the Court for some years, Sir Charles bought Porthaml Mansion and its small estate near Talgarth Brecs., where he lived for the remainder of his life. In the meantime Pembrey Court became the home of George Vaughan (knighted 1643) who was Sir Charles son by his second wife, he inherited the Pembrey and Porthaml Estates, and also the 320 acre\n\nCaldicot Farm after his fatherÕs death.\n\nSir George Vaughan, as a fervent Royalist supported King Charles 1 and his Cavaliers, against Oliver Cromwell and his Parliamentarians, in the Civil War of 1642-52. In 1648 Sir George as a result of his Royalist support was imprisoned by Cromwell, but far more\n\nserious for Sir George, was the huge sum of £2,609 he was fined for his 'Delinquency'. The year 1648 may be significant, as it is claimed that Oliver Cromwell and some of his soldiers passed through Pembrey parish in that year, and it is possible that his representatives may have visited the Court (home of the VaughanÕs), to charge and apprehend Sir George. After his short imprisonment, Sir George returned to the Court, but due to Cromwell's crippling fine, he was forced to sell, later in 1648, his Dunraven\n\nEstate, and in 1649 he has to sell his Fullerston Estate. By a remarkable coincidence, two Ashburnham brothers, early members of the family which succeeded the VaughanÕs, owners of the Court, were among King Charles's closest friends, and Cromwell also took revenge on the Royalist Ashburnhams after the King's execution, by sequestrating part of their large estate and imposing a heavy fine.\n\nIn 1636 Sir Walter and his son George leased Caldicot for a further 21 years to John Hughe, yeoman of Pembrey at a yearly rent of £22 and four pairs of conies.\n\nEventfully after the lease had expired, Joyce Vaughan, the daughter of Rowland Vaughan Jr. took control of Caldicot and when she married James Dalton in 1677 they moved onto the property. Later they must have moved into Court House. This is how our James Dalton started his life towards being called \"Gentleman\"\n\nJames Dalton may have had another wife:\n\nWe have also just learned (Dec. 2002) of some contrasting evidence regarding on just who James Dalton married. James was born in 1650 in Witney, Oxfordshire England. He was the sixth son of Walter Dalton III and Jane Needham. For many years the Dalton family tradition or legend that has been passed down to us, tells us James Dalton married Joyce Vaughan sometime in 1677 in Pembrey, Wales. She is of the famous Vaughan family of South Wales. There have been many articles written about this Dalton and Vaughan family connection. The Journal of the Dalton Genealogical Society of England, which was first organize in 1972 has always claimed this Joyce Vaughan as being married to James Dalton.\n\nMrs. Frances Edith Dalton Leaning in her ÒDaltonÓ book wrote between 1935-1951 states that Joyce Vaughan married James Dalton. On page 118 of this book is the following.\n\nThe F.B. (Family Bible) tells us that he was born in 1650, and lived to be 71, being Òof Caldecot in the Parish of Pembrey, CarmarthenshireÓ and buried there; and that he had seven children, and his wifeÕs name was Joyce. He died in 1721, and she ten years later on Mar. 14, 1731, age 84.\n\nThe entry in ÒBurke's Peerage, Baronetage & KnightageÓ adds to this that he died on May 5, 1721, and was buried Òunder a monument describing him as Son of Walter Dalton of Witney, Oxfordshire, GentÉ..Ó and further that he was a barrister-at-law. His wifeÕs family name was Vaughan.\n\nAmong the family papers, besides the entries from the family bible, is one on a different plan, in six columns. The first has the name of this James alone; the second, his children; the third their children, and so on, each getting fuller and fuller. I shall refer to this as the Six-Column pedigree, and we find that James in it is not only barrister-at-law, but a Receiver for the Duchy of Lancaster; and that Joyce his wife was Òdaughter of Rowland Vaughan of Caldicot House, Esq.Ó (end)\n\nÒI come to the conclusion that James Dalton was an able and attractive young man, who enlisted the sympathies of those who knew him; that won the hand of Joyce Vaughan, and with it the eventual possession of Caldicot House, Pembrey, and the support of the Vaughan allianceÓ\n\nSo according to the research that Mrs. Leaning did between 1935 and 1951 she found some records that show that in fact our James Dalton did married a Joyce Vaughan.\n\nThe Vaughans are mentioned many times in relationship to Walter Dalton, JamesÕ father and his brother Charles also is mentioned.\n\nOur own John Luther Dalton in his records as far back as 1889 lists Joyce Vaughan as the wife of James Dalton. These records of John Luther Dalton has on the cover page; ÒA Family Record Gotten up by John Luther DaltonÓ View this cover page below. John Luther Dalton history can also be read in Cousin Leslie Dalton CrunkÕs two books about our Dalton family.\n\nWe know that John Luther Dalton lived in Wales for a time and he must have found records on the things he wrote in his Dalton Family notes.
