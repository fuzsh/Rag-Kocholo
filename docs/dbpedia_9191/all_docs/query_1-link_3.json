        "text": "American rock musician\n\nMusical artist\n\nEric Bass (born William Frederic Bass Jr., October 23, 1974) is an American musician and record producer. He has been the bassist of the rock band Shinedown since 2008.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nBass was born into a conservative,[1] and very musical family, and was encouraged to sing and play piano from an early age. At 13 he received a trombone, before moving onto guitar the following Christmas.[2] In highschool he played drums in the marching band, which he recalls as being rhythmically invaluable to me throughout my music career.[3]\n\nBass currently lives in Charleston, SC with his wife and their two dogs. He owned a recording studio called Ocean Industries Studios (www.32tracks.com),[4] which was his second studio,[5] and now owns a studio called \"Big Animal Studio\", in which he recorded and produced Planet Zero.[6]\n\nBass is known to suffer from depression, which influenced his work, especially in Shinedown's sixth album, Attention Attention, which was influenced by Bass' condition along with frontman Brent Smith's addiction.[7][8][9][10][11][12][1]\n\nIn September 2021, it was reported that Bass tested positive for COVID-19, and would miss a few shows during the band's tour.[13][14]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDeepfield\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2002 Eric formed Deepfield with Baxter Teal. By 2003 they were signed to In De Goot records/McGathy Promotions, and began to produce their first record. However, Eric soon left the band after becoming more and more drawn by the producing, recording and studio process.[3]\n\nShinedown\n\n[edit]\n\nBass joined Shinedown in 2008, before the release of The Sound of Madness, as a permanent replacement for Brad Stewart. He did not record the album with the band (the album's bass parts were contributed by noted session bassist Chris Chaney), but is now touring with them. In addition to his bass duties, he also plays the keyboard in concert and contributes backing vocals.[15]\n\nBass soon became a prominent member in Shinedown, and wrote many of their songs, starting in Amaryllis.[8] After producing a few singles for the band, such as \"Diamond Eyes\" and Cut the Cord,[16] in 2018 he produced Shinedown's sixth album, Attention Attention,[17][2] and in 2022 he produced their seventh album, Planet Zero in his new studio, \"Big Animal Studio\".[6]\n\nInfluences\n\n[edit]\n\nBass never learned to play a guitar (or a bass guitar), and is self taught.[2]\n\nHe was influenced by bass players Robert DeLeo (Stone Temple Pilots), Chris Wolstenholme (Muse), Tim Commerford (Rage Against the Machine), and producers Rich Costey, Brendan O'Brien, Howard Benson, Andy Wallace, Chris Lord-Alge.\n\nProducer\n\n[edit]\n\nFraming Hanley - The Sum of Who We Are (2014)\n\nSleeper Agent - About Last Night (2014)\n\nCold Kingdom - Cold Kingdom (2017)[18]\n\nShinedown - Attention Attention (2018)\n\nShinedown - Planet Zero (2022)\n\nEquipment\n\n[edit]\n\n2008-2012 - Ernie Ball Music Man Sterling Bass[19]\n\n2012-2019 - Dean Eric Bass Hillsboro Bass[20]\n\n2019â€“Present - Prestige Eric Bass Signature Bass[21][22]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
