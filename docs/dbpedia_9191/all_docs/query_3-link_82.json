        "text": "U.S. internet consumption keeps increasing with more quarantined Americans conducting remote work and schooling, as well as streaming more video and playing more online games.\n\nBut at least so far, U.S. networks are “holding up well,” according to broadband data and insights unit Nokia Deepfield.\n\nThe group found that peak internet traffic increased another 10%-20% last weekend, which culminated the week starting Monday, March 16 and ending Sunday, March 22. The cumulative traffic increase amid COVID-19 social distancing is somewhere between 30%-50%, Nokia Deepfield said.\n\nIn some cases, peak traffic is 50% over what we’d see on a normal weekend.\n\nMost of the traffic is coming from video streaming. But Nokia has observed a 300% growth rate in remote conferencing traffic stemming from platforms including Zoom and Skype. It’s also detected a 400% increase in gaming traffic.\n\nIn Europe, Nokia Deepfield said bitrate curtailments initiated by Netflix and YouTube have “provided relief” to local networks.\n\nBut globally, “service providers are starting to see the increased strain and are approaching capacity on some peering likes and edge routers.”"
