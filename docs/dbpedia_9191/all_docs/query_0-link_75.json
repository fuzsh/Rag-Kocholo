        "text": "One of the main scientific justifications for building Hubble was to measure the size and age of the Universe and test theories about its origin. Images of faint galaxies give 'fossil' clues as to how the Universe looked in the remote past and how it may have evolved with time. The Deep Fields gave astronomers the first really clear look back to the time when galaxies were forming. The first deep fields – Hubble Deep Field North and South – gave astronomers a peephole to the ancient Universe for the first time, and caused a real revolution in modern astronomy.\n\nSubsequent deep imagery from Hubble, including the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, has revealed the most distant galaxies ever observed. Because of the time it has taken their light to reach us, we see some of these galaxies as they were just half a billion years after the Big Bang.\n\nDeep field observations are long-lasting observations of a particular region of the sky intended to reveal faint objects by collecting the light from them for an appropriately long time. The 'deeper' the observation is (i.e. longer exposure time), the fainter are the objects that become visible on the images. Astronomical objects can either look faint because their natural brightness is low, or because of their distance. In the case of the Hubble Deep and Ultra Deep Fields, it is the extreme distances involved which make them faint, and hence make observations challenging.\n\nUsing the different Hubble Deep fields astronomers were able to study young galaxies in the early Universe and the most distant primeval galaxies. The different deep fields are also a good gathering grounds to find the most distant objects ever observed.\n\n10 days in the making\n\nThe Hubble Ultra Deep Field\n\nThe Hubble Ultra Deep Field — Infrared\n\nThe only way to see further than the Hubble Ultra Deep Field is to look beyond the optical wavelengths and observe in infrared instead.\n\nThe Hubble Deep Field imaged in infrared. The Hubble Deep Field South imaged in infrared. Hubble’s 2004 infrared image of the Ultra Deep Field.\n\nHubble Ultra Deep Field - Infrared (2009)\n\nUsing NICMOS, its first near infrared camera, Hubble made infrared observations of the original Hubble Deep Field, the Hubble Deep Field South and Hubble Ultra Deep Field. These images revealed more distant objects, though the picture quality achieved by this instrument could not compete with optical images.\n\nThe next breakthrough came after the 2009 servicing mission in which astronauts installed a new instrument capable of making greatly improved infrared observations. The resulting image, covering most of the field of view of the 2004 Ultra Deep Field observations, is the deepest ever made of the cosmos. It is unlikely to be surpassed until the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope is operational, later this decade.\n\nThe 2009 infrared image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field has been an extremely fertile hunting ground for scientists who study the early Universe. Several candidates for the most distant galaxy ever observed have been spotted in this image.\n\nThe Hubble eXtreme Deep Field\n\n— and more\n\nThe Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (2012) combines all previous observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field\n\nPublished in 2012, the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field is not a new set of observations, but rather a combination of many existing exposures (over 2000 of them) into one image. Combining the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the Hubble Ultra Deep Field – Infrared, and many other images of the same small spot of sky taken over almost 10 years, the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field pushes the limit even further. It is made up of a total of 22 days of exposure time (and 50 days of observing time, as the telescope can only observe the deep field for around half of every orbit.)\n\nThe last Hubble Ultra Deep Field released in 2014 was observed in ultraviolet. This image allowed astronomers to study star formation in a region 5 to 10 billion light-years away from us. The study is called the Ultraviolet Coverage of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UVUDF) project. The addition of ultraviolet data to the Hubble Ultra Deep Field using Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 gives astronomers access to direct observations of regions of unobscured star formation and may help to fully understand how stars formed.\n\nThe Frontier Fields campaign\n\nThe Hubble Frontier Fields is a three-year, 840-orbit programme which created the deepest views of the Universe to date, combining the power of Hubble with the gravitational amplification of light around six different galaxy clusters to explore more distant regions of space than could otherwise be seen. These observations are helping astronomers understand how stars and galaxies emerged out of the dark ages of the Universe, when space was dark, opaque, and filled with hydrogen. In analysing how the light of more distant galaxies is bent by the cluster astronomers also learn about the distribution of normal matter and dark matter within such clusters.\n\nWhile one eye of Hubble was observing its main target, the massive galaxy clusters, the second eye — another instrument — was looking at a part of the sky right next to the cluster. These are called the Parallel Fields. Although not as spectacular as the light-bending clusters, these parallel fields are as deep as the main images and can even compete with the famous Hubble Deep Field as regards depth. They are therefore a valuable tool for studying the evolution of galaxies from the early epochs of the Universe until today.\n\nThe observations for the Frontier Fields campaign were completed in 2017.\n\nThe analysis of the data led to many discovery. Including some of the most distant known galaxies so far and the observation of a lensed supernova.\n\nThe galaxy cluster MACSJ0717.5+3745 was one of the six targets of the Frontier Fields project."
