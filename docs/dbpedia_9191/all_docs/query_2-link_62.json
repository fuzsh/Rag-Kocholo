        "text": "Welcome to Salt Lake City, and welcome back to Monster Energy AMA Supercross an FIM World Championship. After a break of 85 days, with 11 weekends off, a championship resumes. Seven races are slated to take place here in Utah in three weeks. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, many safeguards and social distancing rules are in places, which will result in a different look for supercross today. There are no fans in attendance, as the event is limited by the state of Utah to 900 total people, with a limit of 400 allowed in Rice-Eccles Stadium at any time. Teams are capped at 10 total staff members, and teams can only interact with those in their group. Riders will go to the starting line without mechanics, and we have heard that pit boards will not be used inside a revamped mechanic’s area.\n\nEveryone here took a COVID-19 test once they arrived in Utah, and riders and teams will operate within the state for the next three weeks. We’ve heard of several teams finding or building tracks here and getting in some riding to acclimate to the soil and weather, as Salt Lake City sits at about 4000 feet of elevation. The track designs will change for each of the seven rounds.\n\nFor a better breakdown on today's track and conditions, check out former pro Jason Thomas' Staging Area.\n\nThis first race will begin at 2 p.m. local time, in order to fit into live TV windows on NBCSN and NBC. The stadium opens at 7 a.m., there will not be a track walk or in-person rider’s meeting. The 450SX and 250SX East Regional classes will race today, running the traditional format of heats, a LCQ and a main event in each division.\n\nIn the 450SX class, Eli Tomac holds a slim three-point lead over Ken Roczen, with Cooper Webb 29 points back, and Justin Barcia 31 points behind. Due to the break, riders are healed up, rested and ready. Check out our breakdown of the 450 field.\n\n250 First Practice\n\nThese first sessions are not used for timed qualifying.\n\nIn the very first practice in supercross’ return, the B group of 250 riders rolled out on the track. Literally. Without track walk, riders are required to roll all the jumps for three minutes before resetting and hammering down. Kyle Peters led the group rolling around the track, but when they reset and started putting in lap times, it was Josh Osby—in his first race this year returning from injury—on top of the board. Jerry Robin, who has switched from Honda to Husqvarna since the break, was second, ahead of Hunter Sayles and Peters.\n\nIn the A group of 250 riders, Shane McElrath took off first, ahead of Enzo Lopes. McElrath’s time held for awhile, then Chase Sexton jumped to the top. McElrath put in another heater, but Sexton’s time remained at the top of the board to the end. Sexton’s GEICO Honda teammate Jeremy Martin was third. Colt Nichols, in his first race this season, was fourth, ahead of Lopes.\n\n450 First Practice\n\nThese first sessions are not used for timed qualifying.\n\nJustin Brayton was first rider on track and nailed the triple-triple on the first lap of the timed session. Ken Roczen then jumped to the top of the charts, but Cooper Webb looked frisky, going around Brayton and Barcia to become the lead bike on the track. On his fifth lap, he then took the top time of the session. The next lap, Webb bettered his lap time. It wasn’t enough, though, as Adam Cianciarulo surpassed that to take the top time later in the same lap. On the ninth lap, Eli Tomac surpassed Cianciarulo. Malcolm Stewart slotted into third ahead of Baggett and Webb.\n\nBy the way, the riders don’t have pit boards, and the “Beast” scoring tower is not here, so the riders have no idea where they stand on lap times during practices.\n\nOn the last lap, Malcolm Stewart put in a flyer to grab the top spot from Tomac! Tomac and Cianciarulo were second and third ahead of Webb and Barcia. Baggett, Wilson, Anderson, Bloss, and Brayton rounded out the top ten. Roczen was 15th.\n\n250 Second Practice\n\nIn the B group, Josh Osby was fast again in this one, but Kyle Peters stepped up his game in this one, rolling to the top spot. In the A group, Shane McElrath was fast early again in the seeded session, with Sexton and Shimoda chasing him around. Then Shimoda crashed. The corners have formed some deep ruts now, and dudes are railing them. Sexton then took the top spot on lap three, ahead of McElrath and Marchbanks. Then McElrath took the top spot away on the next lap. Sexton logged one more flyer, but it wasn’t enough, and McElrath’s time held. Martin was third again.\n\nWhile we’re not allowed to visit the pits, our Steve Matthes fired off a text to Ken Roczen. Roczen wrote that he didn’t feel like he hadn’t raced in three months—everything seemed normal. Plus, he doesn’t walk a practice track when it gets rebuilt, so he didn’t really think it was weird to jump into practice today without a track walk. I (of course) texted Justin Brayton and asked if the track is slick. He replied, “Yes, very.”\n\nThe track got watered between sessions. We'll see how that impacts the track.\n\nFinal 250 Session\n\nPeters showed the short way around the track again in this final 250 B session, leading Osby, Sanayei, Robin and Halpain. Late in the race, Sanayei jumped up to second ahead of Robin and Halpain, pushing Osby back to fifth.\n\nSexton jumped out quick in this session, but Jeremy Martin charged to the top on the fourth lap. Sexton then washed the front wheel and went down hard in a 180 left, he got back up and started logging laps again. McElrath then jumped to the top. The track started drying from the water, and times started to come down. Colt Nichols took the top spot away from McElrath. Times started coming in hot and heavy, with Sexton and McElrath leap frogging Nichols to go back to the top. That’s how it ended, with McElrath on top. Sexton, meanwhile, almost lost the front again in another corner. He hung on for second fastest—but traction is going to be the name of the game in these sessions, and possibly in the races later today.\n\n“I think for me, I have nothing to lose,” said McElrath, the fast qualifier. \"It’s crunch time for me and the team. They’re 1-2 in the West coast, and it’s go time. We’ve really been working. I really feel good in the altitude, I’m thinking it may work in my favor,“ “Colt [Nichols, teammate] is going fast. Don’t count him out, he’s been faster than me at the test track a few days. Hopefully we can go 1-2.”\n\nOther News\n\nJGR/Yoshimura Suzuki's bad luck hasn't changed one bit. Poor Broc Tickle has reinjured his hand in a practice crash today, and he's out at least for this event. Tickle was injured in his second race back this year, and even with the break, is dealing with injury again.\n\nJason Anderson moved on from long time trainer Aldon Baker over the break. He said he stayed in Florida briefly and rode with Dean Wilson and the Lawrence brothers at their track--which is Chad Reed's old place--and then headed back to his home state of New Mexico to build a supercross track at altitude. He has training advice now from Darren Stockton, who was a top trainer with a lot of riders about a decade ago, and is back on the scene.\n\nAnderson has had problems at times with altitude, and he has gotten a TUE from WADA to use altitude medicine. However, he can't use that here.\n\n\"I went home to New Mexico and I’ve been riding by myself at home for three weeks,\" he said. \"Usually I get some medicine I usuallu take, but the TUE is only good for three days. So I’m not able to take that at all these. So I built my own track, with some elevation. We'll see how it works out.\n\n\"I feel like three podiums in ten rounds, for what I’m hired to do, that’s not it,\" Anderson continued. \"I really want to be up there, get some podiums, get some wins, get my mojo back, I guess you could say. These guys aren’t going to make it easy on me. There’s a championship going on, but hopefully I can just be ahead of those guys.\"\n\nDean Wilson started this year coming off a major hip injury suffered at Monster Energy Cup. He rushed to Anaheim 1 and tried to build fitness between races, which is both A) not easy and B) something Dean is unfortunately used to doing.\n\n\"The break was good for me, coming into the season I was really behind on riding and testing and everything,\" he said. \"I’m stoked to get that little bit of a break and I feel like I’m a lot better off now. A big help for me, for sure.\n\n\"When your body is not caught up, you just stress out, you’re trying to catch up,\" Wilson explained, admitting that anxiety was getting the better of him. \"After a race your body would be sore but you have to get back after it.\"\n\nWilson is in much better shape, and spirits, now.\n\nBlake Baggett has not had the season he wanted, outside of a podium at San Diego. He's a distant 12th in points.\n\n\"Forget about the past four races, try to think about the results from San Diego and before that,\" he said. \"Last four rounds had some unfortunate stuff happen. I needed a little break, unfortunate that the virus caused this, but I’m just looking forward to redeeming myself. When you’re not racing, you don’t know what to do, we’ve been racing for so many years, it feels odd.\"\n\nCooper Webb is facing long odds to try to make up 29 points on Eli Tomac and 26 on Ken Roczen, but he knows the deep field could help him if riders steal some points from the leaders.\n\n\"With a handful of fourths and fifths, you’re making up eight or so points per race,\" said Webb, hoping to score a win and see Tomac and Roczen miss a podium. \"A lot of money to be made and a dream to chase. The goal is still the same—try to go out and win.\"\n\n250SX Heat 1\n\nWith a revised format of racing where the 250SX Last Chance Qualifier would run directly after both 250SX heat races, getting into the first heat race was suddenly a premium position for bubble spot riders. On the gate drop for the first race in 85 days, it was Chase Sexton taking the early lead with teammate Jeremy Martin right behind him.\n\nPierce Brown and Jo Shimoda engaged in a duel for third which put Brown into the spot. Then the Troy Lee Designs/Red Bull KTM rider applied pressure to Martin just ahead of him. Sexton was opening up a big gap out front over the rest of the field as the defending champ looked locked in as ever coming off the long break.\n\nThe track was moist in the early running as a lot of water was laid down between qualifying and the first heat race leaving a lot of riders searching for traction. Brown continued to keep the pressure on JMart as the time winded down.\n\nIn the end it was Sexton leading wire to wire and picking up the victory. Martin held off Brown for second with Shimoda and Jalek Swoll rounding out the top five. Grant Harlan crashed with a straightaway to go and nearly lost a transfer spot but was able to get up and hold onto the spot.\n\n450SX Main Event\n\nIn the 450 main event it was Blake Baggett getting the holeshot on front of Adam Cianciarulo, Justin Brayton, and Eli Tomac inside of the top five. Cianciarulo fell heavily out of second and was actually ran over by Webb in the process. The crash moved Tomac up to third with Webb and Ken Roczen right behind him.\n\nBaggett was opening up a small lead at the front as Brayton was dealing with the pressure from behind of the three title rivals. Tomac made a small mistake and allowed both Webb and Roczen by for third and fourth, respectively. With the track conditions deteriorating quickly, the battles up front remained close as everyone was taking their time to setup passes.\n\nRoczen then made a small bobble just after five minutes into the race and allowed Tomac back on through. Then all three of them moved around Brayton to set sail after Baggett. Tomac moved back around Webb to get up into second as the musical chairs continued.\n\nTomac quickly picked up his pace and ran down Baggett for the lead before the halfway point setting consistently fast laps to do so. Tomac quickly moved into the lead, and continued his breakneck pace as Webb and Roczen closed right up onto Baggett for second.\n\nBehind the chaos out front, Jason Anderson had moved into the top five and brought his teammate Zach Osborne with him for sixth. Webb moved Baggett out of the way just past the halfway point and the momentary blip for Baggett caused Roczen to slip by for third as well.\n\nThe pace began to settle in by the second half of the race as Tomac managed a few second lead over Webb with Roczen dropping back a few seconds behind the defending champion. Osborne charged up and moved past Baggett to find himself up in fourth.\n\nBaggett continued to descend through the field as Anderson also moved around him and then Martin Davalos was the next man by with about four minutes remaining. Justin Barcia sat in eighth place for most of the second half of the race after moving around Brayton just past the halfway point. Roczen had a huge moment with a couple laps to go when he landed on the Tuff Blox but rode out of it and continued on.\n\nIn the end, Eli Tomac claimed his sixth win of the season as he extended his points lead to eight points over Roczen as Webb claimed second and Roczen rounded out the podium."
