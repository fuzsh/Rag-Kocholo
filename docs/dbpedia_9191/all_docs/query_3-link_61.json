        "meta_description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to successfully predict molecular properties calculated based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT). Although this prediction is fast and accurate, we believe that a DNN model for KS-DFT must not only predict the properties but also provide the electron density of a molecule. This Letter presents the quantum deep field (QDF), which provides the electron density with an unsupervised but end-to-end physics-informed modeling by learning the atomization energy on a large-scale dataset. QDF performed well at atomization energy prediction, generated valid electron density, and demonstrated extrapolation.",
