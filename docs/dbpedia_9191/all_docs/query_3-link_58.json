        "meta_description": "Deep Field: The Impossible Magnitude of our Universe: With Sawyer Amadeus, Justin Bell, Alexander Karagiozov, Mary Losey. Grammy® award-winning American composer Eric Whitacre's symphonic work Deep Field was inspired by the world's most famous space observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, and its greatest discovery - the iconic Deep Field image. The new film - Deep Field: The Impossible Magnitude of our Universe - illuminates the score by combining Hubble's stunning imagery, including never-seen-before galaxy fly-bys, with bespoke animations to create an immersive, unforgettable journey from planet Earth to the furthest edges of our universe. The film is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between Grammy® award-winning composer and conductor Eric Whitacre, producers Music Productions, scientists and visualizers from the Space Telescope Science Institute and multi award-winning artists 59 Productions. The score and film paint the incredible story of the Hubble Deep Field. Turning its gaze to a tiny and seemingly dark area of space (around one 24-millionth of the sky) for an 11-day long period, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed over 3,000 galaxies that had never previously been seen, each one composed of hundreds of billions of stars.",
