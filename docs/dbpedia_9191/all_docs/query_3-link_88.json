        "text": "Jeff Vervoort, left, an associate professor in radiogenic isotope geochemistry at Washington State University, and John Goodge, a professor of geological sciences at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, are writing from their research expedition in Antarctica.\n\nSunday, Dec. 19\n\nThe weather broke, of course, on Sunday. Sunday is a day off for most of the nonscience support workers and, therefore, a no-fly day in Antarctica for the United States Antarctic Program. But a beautiful day it was, with bright sunny skies and no wind.\n\nA few of the CTAM staff organized a day trip to the mountains of the Queen Alexandra Range east of camp to look at the Glossopteris fossils preserved in the Permian sediments exposed there. This was a general outing for the hard-working staff, who get to see the nearby mountains every day, but do not routinely get a chance to experience them firsthand. The leaf fossils are from an ancient tree similar to today’s ginkgo and have been found in similar sediments in Antarctica, Australia, Africa and South America, providing a key piece of evidence demonstrating these continents were all connected in the supercontinent Gondwana some 260 million years ago.\n\nOn Monday the weather held, and after a week in CTAM we headed off for our camp in the Miller Range. The camp site is high on the Ascent Glacier, around 6,000 feet, just off the blue ice at the edge of the polar plateau. It is a relatively small tributary glacier by Antarctic standards (about two miles across at the camp site), and joins with the Argosy Glacier before flowing into the huge Marsh Glacier (10 to 15 miles across). By the time the Marsh joins the immense Nimrod Glacier, some 35 miles from our camp, the ice is on a rapid charge to the Ross Sea Ice Shelf.\n\nMost of our gear, including three snowmobiles and sleds, fuel, tents, geological field supplies, cooking gear and food, had been ferried here by several Twin Otter trips and were cached at our campsite. The five of us in our field party arrived with our sleep kits and personal gear several days after the last cargo flight, because of the weather delays from high winds in the previous week. Because of these winds, unfortunately, we had to do some serious excavation to get all of our gear out of a large mounded snowdrift.\n\nWhen snow blows into drifts here, the well-traveled and granular snow crystals quickly bond and form hard drifts, making digging out all the more difficult. This windblown snow has the consistency of dense, fine Styrofoam. The snowmobiles were the most difficult — the wind blew snow into every possible nook and cranny, including around the track and under the engine cover. Until we freed the track, undercarriage and skis, and excavated the engine components, we were going nowhere. We spent many hours with shovels, ice axes, bamboo sticks, whisk brooms and even kitchen spoons (to get at the places around the engine) unpacking the snowmobiles from the solid drifts.\n\nIn contrast to CTAM, where there is considerable infrastructure and Antarctic Program personnel to help accommodate our research and other needs, at the remote camp we are on our own and need to be self-sufficient. For our field party, our camp consists of our five personal mountain tents for sleeping, a large (10-by-20-foot) “Arctic Oven” tent for cooking, eating and gathering, and a traditional Scott tent that serves as a shelter for our latrine. Supplying all of this equipment, and making sure it is in good working order, is McMurdo’s Berg Field Center, which has been taking care of the field needs of the USAP-NSF science efforts for decades.\n\nI must admit, the prospect of camping for weeks at a time at 85 degrees south latitude and at 6,000 feet with temperatures hovering around 0 degrees Fahrenheit didn’t sound completely enticing. I had done my fair share of winter camping in northern Minnesota in similar temperatures, and although these were memorable adventures, they were not necessarily experiences I was looking to repeat while at the same time trying to do our research.\n\nIt was a pleasant surprise, therefore, to find the “camping” in Antarctica to be quite comfortable. The big difference, of course, is the sun, which never sets at this time of the year this far south. The sun moves in an inclined circle around the horizon, never too high, but never getting too low either. This results in only small variations in midday and “nighttime” temperatures and keeps the tents in the sun 24 hours a day. Even though the outside temperature is about 0 degrees Fahrenheit, it is generally 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit inside the mountain tents. In some cases it is too hot to get fully into the sleeping bags; frequently we need to open a vent to let in a little cold air!\n\nBut outside the comfort of our little tents, the conditions can be a bit less friendly. Our Miller Range camp is less than two miles from the edge of the polar ice cap, and when the katabatic winds blow, which they seem to do quite frequently (see John Goodge’s previous post), it is a straight shot down the Ascent Glacier to our camp. So far the winds have been, shall we say, persistent, which requires a full Antarctic wardrobe to go outside for any length of time.\n\nTo stay warm in the field, we use the same approach as in cold-weather climates everywhere — layers of wool, fleece, polyester and down, capped with a windshell. Although the United States Antarctic Program provides most of the essentials in Christchurch, New Zealand, as part of the Antarctic deployment, many people (including us) prefer to use their own gear. One absolute USAP requirement, however, is that all Antarctic personnel must have a full complement of ECW (Extreme Cold Weather) gear. This includes basic items such as balaclavas, goggles, base and over layers, wind pants and jackets, which many people bring, but two items most people will take at Christchurch are the classic Antarctic white military-style “bunny boots” and “Big Red,” the traditional heavy down Antarctic parka. The ECW, including the Big Red, must be taken along when venturing into the field — or when taking any flights or other transportation off station in Antarctica. Our usual gear for working in the field consists of wool or polyester base layers, lightweight fleeces, windproof bib overalls, heavier fleece tops or down vest/jacket, windproof shell, warm hat and sunglasses. If it gets colder we can add layers, and if it gets very cold and windy we reach for Big Red.\n\nAlthough we don’t spend much time in camp outside of working and sleeping, the Arctic Oven, which we use for cooking, eating and working after dinner, definitely makes life more comfortable. This also provides us with a place to work and hang out when the weather turns foul and we are hunkered down in camp with weather delays. Another important element of our camp is the traditional Antarctic Scott tent. As part of USAP regulations, we need to haul out all of our solid human waste (in some places, like the environmentally sensitive Dry Valleys, even all liquid waste needs to be packed out). We use a floorless Scott tent as our outhouse, which helps provide a shelter to make this basic function much more pleasant, especially when the wind is howling and the snow is blowing.\n\nOur daily routine, in many ways, is not much different from field work elsewhere: up for breakfast; gather field gear and pack lunches for a day in the field; out in the field with transport by Twin Otter, helicopter or snowmobile; return to camp for dinner and an hour or two of cleanup and after-dinner work in the Arctic oven; and into our sleep tents to get ready for the next day. We have now been in the Miller Range camp for a week and have enjoyed very scientifically productive days thanks to the confluence of good weather and the availability of Twin Otter support. As a result we have met many of our scientific objectives and are well on our way to completing our project on schedule.\n\nThe stunning, austere beauty of the Antarctic icescape is our constant companion. But as often happens, we get lost in the moment with our hooded heads bent down, wrapped up in the task at hand. This happens throughout the day as we do our research here. But it is when you pick up your head and look around that it really hits you: this is a very special place, and how extremely lucky you are to have the opportunity to be working here."
