        "text": "What is New?\n\nFLAMEX Mirror\n\nMirror of the Released FLAMINGOS Extragalactic Survey of the NDWFS Boötes and Cetus fields. Mirror Location on NOAO computer.\n\nUniversity of Florida Primary Server Version\n\nX-Boötes Survey Data Released\n\nThe matched optical and X-ray catalogs from the XBoötes Survey\n\n(12/12/2005) The optical and X-ray catalogs from the XBoötes Survey can be obtained through the above link, and by 12/13/2005, through the NOAO Science Archive. The XBoötes Survey is a 5-ks Chandra survey of the Boötes Field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey ( Murray et al. 2005 ). The catalog presents the 3,213 X-ray point-source in the XBoötes survey (reproduced from Kenter et al. 2005), and the matched optical and near-IR properties from the NDWFS DR3. The optical and near-IR catalog of the X-ray point sources is presented in Brand et al. 2006 (ApJ, in press, PDF version of paper). The catalogs are matched using a Bayesian identification scheme (see Brand et al. (2006) for details). All optical sources with >1% probability of being the match to an X-ray source are included. To select only the most probable optical counterpart (including no optical counterpart), one should select only the sources with optical rank=1.\n\nBoötes Field Third Data Release (NDWFS DR3)\n\nAt the above link, or through the NOAO Science Archive, you will find all of the processed optical MOSAIC-1 and ONIS IR images obtained of our 9.3 square degree Boötes field. You will also find single band catalogues. Multi-band matched catalogues, as well as additional IR imaging (using FLAMINGOS) will be made available in the near future. These images and catalogues comprise our third NDWFS data release. Full documentation of these data sets will be included in two papers under preparation and on the linked web pages. The content of the web pages documenting the release will continue to be expanded over the next few weeks.\n\nSome Pretty Pictures from the January 2001 Data Release\n\nSurvey Goal\n\nThe NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS) is a deep optical and near-infrared imaging survey that covers two 9.3 square degree fields. It was designed primarily for the study of the existence and evolution of large scale structures at redshifts z>1 as sampled by diverse populations of objects.\n\nThe Survey Characteristics (As Originally Proposed):\n\nField Locations:\n\nThe survey covers two regions of sky.\n\nThe 1st semester field (we call this the Boötes Field) is a 3x3 degree region near the North Galactic Pole, centered on approximately\n\nRA = 14h 30m 00s, DEC = +34o 30' 00'' (B1950)\n\nRA = 14h 32m 05.7120s, DEC = +34o 16' 47.496'' (J2000)\n\nGalactic Coordinates: l = 57.45, b = 67.28\n\nEcliptic Coordinates (equinox 2004.00): long = 200.52, lat = 45.99\n\nThe 2nd semester field (we call this the Cetus Field) is a 2.3x4.0 degree equatorial strip roughly 30o from the South Galactic Pole, centered on roughly\n\nRA = 2h 07m 29.15s, DEC = -4o 44' 08.24'' (B1950)\n\nRA = 2h 10m 00.00s, DEC = -4o 30' 00.00'' (J2000)\n\nGalactic Coordinates: l = 166.01, b = -60.62\n\nEcliptic Coordinates (equinox 2004.00): long = 28.75, lat = -16.56\n\nFor each of the above fields, the J2000 coordinates are the positions used as the reference positions for the projection of our reduced images.\n\nThese fields were selected for their low IRAS cirrus emission, low N(HI), and the eventual public availability of radio data from the VLA FIRST Survey for these fields. The equatorial field has F[100 microns] < 1.5 MJy/sr (over 80% of the area), N(HI) ~ 1.75x1020 cm-2, corresponding to E(B-V) < 0.04. The equatorial field is also only ~15o from the ecliptic, allowing a search for Kuiper belt objects.\n\nA giff format image of the POSS DSS data of the 1st semester (Boötes) field location is shown here.\n\nA giff format image of the POSS DSS data of the 2nd semester (Cetus; equatorial) field location is shown here.\n\nOptical pointing coordinates of subfields in both Deep Wide-Field Survey fields are given here.\n\nProposed Depth and Sensitivity:\n\nThe proposed optical survey depths (see Table) were selected to allow detection of an L* star-forming galaxy at z > 3.5. The IR imaging depths were selected to detect an \"unevolved\" L* elliptical galaxy at z=1.5, and passively evolving luminous systems to z=2. The planned depth will also permit the study of the Galactic halo stellar populations, the coolest high-latitude white dwarfs to ~1.5kpc, young (bright) field brown dwarfs (like GL229B) to ~75pc, distant supernovae, and distant radio sources.\n\nDocumentation of the achieved depths for the Boötes field will be presented in Jannuzi et al. 2005 (in preparation, for the optical imaging) and Dey et al. 2005 (in preparation, for the IR imaging) and off of the link for the October 22, 2004 data release above.\n\nNOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey Planned Detection Limits\n\n5-sig Detection Limit in 2\" Aperture 1-sig Surf. Brightness Limit per square arcsec Bands AB mag. Vega mag. AB mag. Vega mag. BW 26.6 26.6 29.0 29.0 R 26.0 25.8 28.4 28.2 I 26.0 25.5 28.4 27.9 J 21.0 20.2 23.4 22.6 H 21.0 19.6 23.4 22.0 K 21.4 19.5 23.8 21.9\n\nOriginal Observing Plan:\n\nWe planed to observe each region to the depths specified in Table 1 using several of the wide-field optical and IR imagers now available at NOAO. The optical observations were made with the Mosaic-1 (sometimes called Mosaic-I) camera on the Mayall Telescope at KPNO and the Mosaic-2 (sometimes called Mosaic-II) camera on the Blanco Telescope at CTIO (starting in the second semester of 1999). Prior to the availability of Mosaic-2 we used the Big Throughput Camera (provided by Drs. Tyson and Bernstein) at the Blanco. The IR observations were made with a series of IR instruments including ONIS, SQIID, and FLAMINGOS at the KPNO 2.1-m. The filters being used are all standard with the exception of the BW filter. This plot shows the transmission of the BW filter, and all the filters used in the survey. A blow-up of the transmission curve for the BW filter as compared to a Johnson B and a Stromgren U filter is here. An ascii file of the transmission of the filter as measured in the lab is here.\n\nObserving Status\n\nAll approved imaging observations for the survey have been completed. Both the Cetus and Boötes fields were imaged in the Bw, R, and I bands. The Boötes field was completely covered in K-band and partially covered in J and H. The Cetus field IR observations were only partially completed. Getting full coverage in the IR will have to depend on other surveys (including the FLAMEX survey being led Anthony Gonzalez at the University of Florida).\n\nOptical pointing coordinates of the subfields in both Deep Wide-Field Survey fields are given here.\n\nHow We Reduce Our Images:\n\nWe have a guide on how we reduce our NOAO Mosaic Images at this link. During 2004 we have made some additional refinements to our reduction process. A revised version of the guide is in preparation and should be available in January of 2005.\n\nThe Survey Team (Current and Past):\n\nBuell Jannuzi, Arjun Dey (Survey Co-PI's), Taft Armandroff, Ed Ajhar (St. Thomas University), Bob Blum, Todd Boroson, Kate Brand, Michael J.
