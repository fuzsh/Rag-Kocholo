        "text": "WednesdayAsheville Songwriter’s Showcase\n\n— Asheville has long been hailed as an artistic enclave, friendly to all sorts of creative types from painters to writers and, most especially, musicians. This package tour is banking on that reputation to bring you, the listener, out to hear the piano-centric songcraft of Ashley Chambliss, who recalls Rickie Lee Jones’ better moments; bluesy country-rock balladry from the tough-as-nails sounding Laura Blackley; and indie-rock attitude from Nikki Talley. Separate or together, they’re three names you might not be familiar with who represent a decent slice of Asheville’s current music scene. K. Oliver\n\nFive Points Pub: 10 p.m., $7; 253-7888, myspace.com/5pointspub.FridayDeepfield\n\n— The Hubble Telescope’s snapshot of the “deep field” — a photograph of a small region of the Ursa Major constellation that uncovered heretofore unknown young galaxies in 1995 — is widely regarded as the most important collage in the history of astronomy, as it allows stargazers to postulate on the metaphysics involved in the creation of our own universe. Similarly, Lowcountry rockers Deepfield have gazed into the galaxy of modern rock and have created their own little sonic universe, one that owes a great deal to the bombast of ‘70s arena rock and the driving anthems of modern behemoths such as Theory of a Deadman and Puddle of Mudd. Big-rock revivalists Leslie and hip-hop-rockers Infinite open. P. Wall\n\nHeadliners: 8 p.m., $5; 796-2333, headlinerscolumbia.com.Glass Gnats\n\n— Chances are that if you’re a guitarist in the metropolitan Columbia area, you’ve been recommended the services of Billy Chapman if your axe needs some doctoring. And chances are that if you’re a hockey player in the metropolitan Columbia area (and, granted, that’s quite a minority), you’ve run into Benoit St. Jacques before. Now here’s your chance to run into them at the same time: The two master guitarists form the fretboard-melting nucleus of Glass Gnats, which elder hipsters might remember for pushing the boundaries of new wave in the ‘80s. P. Wall\n\nHunter-Gatherer: 11 p.m., $3; 748-0540.\n\nKris Roe\n\nKris Roe\n\n— Santa Barbara’s The Ataris have long been a staple of the Fat Wreck Chords lineup, and on Friday, Ataris fans are in for a treat as lead singer Kris Roe plays the entirety of 1999’s Blue Skies, Broken Hearts … Next 12 Exits all by his lonesome. The band’s second full-length album and arguably its best, Blue Skies features such classic pop-punk tracks as “San Dimas High School Football Rules” and “Last Song I Will Ever Write About A Girl” (which, incidentally, turned out to be not entirely true). Dignan and Versus The Robot round out this early all-ages show. T. Baker\n\nNew Brookland Tavern: 6:30 p.m., $10; 791-4413, newbrooklandtavern.com.Joal Rush\n\n— Columbia expatriate Joal Rush has relocated yet again, this time from Atlanta to Charleston, and he and his band of merry men are returning once again to rock his hometown. On last year’s Imagination EP, Rush really stepped up the rock side of his straightforward pop/rock game. The emphasis on cranked amps and electric guitars should be a nice change of pace for fans used to seeing Rush’s acoustic performance. Pawley’s Islanders Ten Toes Up open with their blend of Southern rock and funk that includes a dual-drummer rhythm section. T. Baker\n\nFive Points Pub: 9 p.m., $3; 253-7888, myspace.com/5pointspub.\n\nJoal Rush\n\nSaturdayChris Ayer\n\n— Man, it has to be tough to be a singer-songwriter in New York City, what with so many aspiring artists plying their trade in the Big Apple. But Chris Ayer has a leg up on his competition — namely his mellifluously attractive folk-pop songs, one of which, “Evaporate,” was a winner of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest in the folk category. How NBC hasn’t snatched Ayer’s songs up for airplay on Grey’s Anatomy or Scrubs is beyond me. South Carolina singer-songwriters John Callaway and Hannah Miller join Ayer for an in-the-round performance: Callaway’s fun-loving pop owes a great deal to ‘90s poppers Sister Hazel, O.A.R. and Hootie; local chanteuse Miller has the deep, passionate songs to match her beautiful, resonant voice. P. Wall\n\nThe Watershed: 8:30 p.m., $5; 957-1887, watershedbooks.net.Jonathan Byrd\n\n— This Chapel Hill native has forged his own path through folk music by stoking his compositions with elements of old-time Appalachia, early country music and Stephen Foster-era minstrelsy. Along the way, he’s collaborated for an album with the world-music duo Dromedary (2004’s The Sea and the Sky) and written unlikely folk-gospel songs such as “Jesus Was a Bootlegger” (appearing on 2006’s This is the New That). Judging from the fervent response Byrd gets from folk music audiences, he can set up a musical tent revival just about anywhere and draw a crowd these days. K. Oliver Unitarian Universalist Fellowship Coffeehouse: 7:30 p.m., $12/$7 students ($10/$5 advance); 1-888-849-4224 ext. 4, uucoffeehouse.org.Goth Night\n\n— Too old to rock the pleather pants? Please. Goth night knows no age limit! The undead welcome all. Your host for a night of debauchery and indulgence is Atlanta’s Prognosis, for whom things have not been going very well. Quoth its MySpace page: “A lot has happened over the years. Most of it not good. All of the anger and hatred for people and life has been pounded into this sound.” Sweet. Prognosis has suffered so you, my dark fiend, may dance to the furious sounds of throbbing beats, tortured screams and hate, hate, hate. E. Greenwood\n\nArt Bar: 10 p.m., $3; 929-0198, artbarsc.com.Hypnotize Tour\n\n— If you’ve been near a radio within the past two years, you’d be hard-pressed not to have heard the likes of Plies, Lil’ Boosie and Rick Ross, especially in the Southeast, where this uprising trio of Southern-fried rappers has a monopoly on rap music outlets. The emcees make an appearance at the Township promoting their Hypnotize Tour, which features more rappers than American Gangster. Also on the bill is R&B vocalist The Dream, who’s been responsible for writing some of your favorite recent hits. (Can you say “Umbrella”?) You lucky folks will also get a preview of Rick Ross’ newest album,Trilla, which hits stores 10 days after the show. For people in the Metro thinking that there’s a lack of crunk in the community, fret no more, as this event will be the thing for you. P. Jacobs\n\nTownship Auditorium: 7 p.m., $33.50-$55.50; 783-2222, thetownship.org.Josh Roberts & The Hinges\n\n— Roberts has been making music — good music — for a long while, but on last year’s My War Cry is Armor, the son-of-a-gun painted his masterpiece. All hyperbole aside, My War Cry is Armor is a sprawling, cinemascopic set of blessed rock ‘n’ roll that only the South seems capable of producing. Then again, here’s the opener, Philadelphia’s Hoots and Hellmouth, playing a foot-stomping blend of mountain music. Also on the bill is Memphis’ Giant Bear, which fancies itself the world’s only five-piece orchestral funkabilly band, and Decatur, Ga.’s, Warm in the Wake, which has a streak of experimentalism in its roots-rock. K. Foster\n\nFive Points Pub: 10 p.m., $10 ($7 advance); 253-7888, myspace.com/5pointspub.The Working Title\n\n— Charleston’s The Working Title has a posse — well, street team. It also has a new EP entitled Heart, but you won’t find “Magic Man,” “Barracuda,” “Crazy on You,” “Alone” or any other Wilson sisters’ song therein. No, the heart of this digital EP (subtitled “Thrice By Our Powers Combined We Are Captain Planet”) is clearly on the sleeve of these acoustic ditties. Heart is quite a departure for a band that had a big enough sound to land a deal with major label Universal, a deal that’s since soured. Maybe this stripped-down approach is a cleansing of the palette, as it were. Opener Here’s Looking at You Kid is a team of Myrtle Beach youngsters with emo wishes and mall-punk dreams. K. Foster\n\nHeadliners: 8 p.m., $12 ($10 advance); 796-2333, headlinerscolumbia.com.MondayRAQ\n\n— If RAQ’s music were included in a Guitar Hero game, anyone playing it would probably resemble a person having an epileptic seizure; RAQ’s guitar wankery is intricate, intense and downright epic in length. Carrying on in the tradition of fellow Vermonters Phish, RAQ takes basic rock ‘n’ roll song structures and uses them as excuses to wander all over the musical landscape. The band’s released three albums, including 2006’s Ton These, but like any decent jam-rock band, the good stuff’s in the live shows, tons of which one can find online to prove the point. K. Oliver"
