The district extends from the edge of the Black Country conurbation in the south-east, to Telford in the west, and includes a large tract of rural Green Belt on the Staffordshire-Shropshire borders. The solid rocks at outcrop range from Precambrian to Triassic in age. The oldest rocks, pyroclastic tuffs, originated in an island-arc setting in south polar latitudes; the youngest are continental red-beds that formed in inland sabkha environments, when Britain lay just north of the equator.\n\nAlthough the geological record spans about 560 Ma, the modern landscape has been shaped largely by geological processes that operated during the last two million years. Successive glaciations have modified the landscape, and the superficial deposits of till and glacial outwash that blanket much of the district are the product of a Late Devensian glaciation. The Ironbridge Gorge and other meltwater channels also date from this period. Since the ice retreated about 13 000 years ago, the postglacial history has been one of drainage development, valley incision and terrace aggradation.\n\nThe district has a long industrial heritage dependent, until recently, on the mineral wealth of the Carboniferous rocks exposed in the South Staffordshire and Coalbrookdale coalfields. During the 18th and 19th centuries, settlements grew and prospered as industries were established, founded on a plentiful supply of coal, clay, ironstone and limestone. The relicts of these industries have left parts of the district with a legacy of difficult ground conditions, aspects of which are described in the applied section of this report. Today, mineral extraction is of less importance but brickclay, fireclay and some opencast coal are still produced, and the Triassic conglomerates are an important source of aggregate. The Permo-Triassic rocks of the Stafford Basin hold important groundwater resources from which large volumes of water are abstracted for public supply.\n\n(Table 1) Geological succession of the Wolverhampton and Telford district.\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nThis Sheet Description provides a summary of the geology of the district covered by the 1:50 000 Geological Series Sheet 153 (Wolverhampton), published as a Solid and Drift edition in 2001. A simplified map of the bedrock geology is shown in (Figure 1), and the geological succession is summarised in (Table 1). A brief summary of the geology is also provided by the Sheet Explanation that accompanies the published map. More detailed information can be found in the Technical Reports for the constituent 1:10 000 scale geological maps.\n\nThe district lies within the West Midlands Region and includes parts of the shire counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire (Figure 2). The Metropolitan Borough of Wolverhampton is the main centre of population in the south-east, while Telford, designated a New Town in 1968, is the major commercial and administrative centre in the west. The intervening rural tract is mainly Green Belt, but includes a number of small towns, including Penkridge, Breward and Codsall.\n\nThe relief is gently undulating, reaching a maximum elevation of 193 m above OD in the west. The main watershed divide of Central England passes in an irregular arc through the district and separates streams flowing northwards to the Trent (River Penk) from those draining southwards to the Severn (the River Worfe and Smestow Brook). In the south-west, the Ironbridge Gorge, famous as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, takes the deeply incised River Severn through a former (preglacial) watershed divide.\n\nThe geological sequence is dominated by the Permo-Triassic rocks of the Stafford Basin. These give rise to a subdued topography, punctuated by low ridges formed by harder sandstone and conglomerate beds. Upper Carboniferous red beds and Coal Measures crop out on either side of the basin in the coalfields of South Staffordshire and Coalbrookdale. To the south of the Coalbrookdale Coalfield, Lower Palaeozoic rocks form the highest ground in the district. In the north, the Lilleshall Inlier is a prominent topographical feature located on the line of the Church Stretton Fault. Included within its core are rocks of Cambrian and Precambrian age. The entire district was glaciated in Quaternary times, and the products of this glaciation cover all but the highest escarpments.\n\nThe economy of the district has long been dominated by traditional heavy industries based on the ready availability of raw materials. Coal, ironstone and brickclay, produced from the exposed coalfields, provided the stimulus for the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries. The decline of this industrial base and the move to a more diverse economy (consumer electronics, precision engineering, food processing) has left a legacy of derelict land, often with difficult ground conditions. Mineral workings (aggregate, coal, brickclay, fireclay) continue to be important to the local economy, and groundwater resources within the Permo-Triassic aquifers are extensively exploited as a source of potable water.\n\nOutline of geological history\n\nThe Precambrian volcaniclastic rocks of the Lilleshall Inlier are the most northerly exposures of the Uriconian Volcanic Group. Volcanic activity commenced around 566 Ma (Tucker and Pharaoh, 1991) when magmas of rhyolitic composition reached surface and were erupted explosively during oceanic plate subduction on the northern margins of the southern hemisphere continent of Gondwana (Thorpe et al., 1984; Pharaoh et al., 1987a, b; Gibbons and Horák, 1996). The geochemical evidence is consistent with eruption in a fault-bounded, ensialic marginal basin. Radiometric studies indicate that magmatic activity lasted until at least 560 Ma, after which oblique subduction brought about dismemberment of the arc system and accretion of the constituent elements on to the Gondwanan continental margin. The resulting crustal block, known as Eastern Avalonia, became detached from Gondwana in the early Ordovician, and migrated northwards, eventually colliding with the continental masses of Laurentia and Baltica. Avalonian rocks now form the basement to central and southern England. Western representatives of this crustal block, exposed at Lilleshall and elsewhere along the Church Stretton Fault, form part of the Wrekin Terrane (Pharaoh et al., 1987b).\n\nEarly Cambrian rocks preserve a record of marine transgression involving progressive submergence of the Avalonian microcontinent. It is most likely that this transgression commenced in latest Precambrian times, following a phase of rifting that established the Midland Platform as a periodically emergent high, flanked to the west by the more rapidly subsiding Welsh Basin. The Iapetus Ocean lay to the north. Fragmentary evidence of this marine transgression is found in the Lilleshall Inlier, where the Early Cambrian (Comley Series) is represented by shallow-water glauconitic sandstones. A break in deposition occurred during the Mid Cambrian (St David’s Series) but sedimentation resumed during the Late Cambrian (Merioneth Series) with deeper water mudstones. During the Ordovician (about 490 to 435 Ma), the Avalonian microcontinent separated from Gondwana and drifted northwards from subpolar to temperate latitudes. Collision with Baltica (Scandinavia) in late Ordovician times resulted in uplift and inversion, causing the sea to retreat to the west.\n\nSedimentation recommenced in the late Llandovery (about 427 Ma), probably as a result of a glacioeustatic global sea-level rise. As the Silurian sea spread eastwards across the Midland Platform, cycles of intercalated carbonates and siliciclastic sediments were deposited in a series of transgressive-regressive cycles. Final closure of Iapetus Ocean in the late Silurian resulted in a change from marine through brackish to continental conditions, culminating in Prídolí times in the deposition of red beds. Caledonian (Acadian) earth movements produced gentle folding, uplift and prolonged erosion.\n\nThe period from the late Devonian through to the end of the Dinantian (360 to 320 Ma) was a time of major crustal extension when Britain occupied an equatorial position, separated from oceans to the south by the Variscan Mountains. As warm, tropical seas began to transgress northwards, the emergence of a persistent, low-lying hinterland stretching from Wales through the Midlands (the Wales-Brabant High) strongly influenced the depositional pattern. Shallow-water carbonates and evaporites deposited on the Lilleshall High provide evidence of a mid-Courceyan (about 355 Ma) marine transgression on to the southern flanks of the Wales-Brabant landmass. Intra-Dinantian uplift followed before sedimentation resumed in late Asbian-Brigantian time with a succession of fluviatile sandstones, carbonates and contemporaneous extrusive lavas.\n\nBy late Dinantian times, as active extension was replaced by a pattern of more general thermal subsidence, an area of continuous sedimentation — the Pennine Basin — began to evolve north of the land barrier. Thin representatives of the deltaic Millstone Grit may be present in the subsurface in the north of the district, and there are other unconfirmed borehole provings at Lilleshall, and at sites in the Coalbrookdale and South Staffordshire coalfields.\n\nOver a period of four million years, (from about 315 Ma), Coal Measures of Langsettian, Duckmantian and early Bolsovian age (Westphalian A to C) were laid down, predominantly in delta plain, lacustrine and swamp environments. Persistent cycles of deposition reflect changing subsidence rates and worldwide fluctuations in eustatic sea level. A typical cycle commences with a marine mudstone, passes up into a clastic terrigenous phase and is capped by a coal, with a seatearth palaeosol at its base. Under conditions of reduced subsidence, full cycles are rarely developed, however. Towards the basin margin, peat accumulation was sustained on the delta top over long periods, resulting, after burial and compaction, in the closely spaced or amalgamated coal seams, so typical of the Coalbrookdale and Staffordshire Coalfields.\n\nDuring the latest Duckmantian to Bolsovian stages (Westphalian B-C), the style of sedimentation changed as a consequence of episodic Variscan uplift in areas to the south and west of the coal basin. This led to the regression of the coal swamps, and deposition of alluvial red beds of the Etruria Formation. A subsequent phase of igneous activity resulted in emplacement of the Wednesfield dolerite and associated sills into the Westphalian strata. A further period of folding, uplift and erosion occurred, before conditions reverted to those more typical of the early Westphalian. The fluvial sandstones and lacustrine mudstones that characterise the Halesowen Formation point to a period of fairly slow subsidence, when the alluvial plain was crossed by large river-systems, probably fed from the south.\n\nTowards the end of the Carboniferous Period (Westphalian D to Stephanian) renewed uplift within the Variscan foreland area resulted in rejuvenation of river systems flowing from rising uplands to the south of the Pennine Basin. Silts, sands and gravels carried northwards by these systems were deposited on broad, well-drained alluvial plains (Salop Formation). A change from a tropical to a more arid climate is indicated by the appearance in these red-bed sediments of well-developed calcretes.\n\nWidespread subaerial erosion of Variscan highs occurred in early Permian times, when sedimentation was essentially confined to fault-bounded basins. Initially, mud-rich fan deposits, derived from an eroding hinterland to the south, were deposited across more rapidly subsiding areas of the basin (Clent Formation). Later in Permian times, continued extensional movement on basement controlled north and north-east-trending faults, led to the formation of the Stafford Basin, and the accumulation of wind-blown dune sands (Bridgnorth Sandstone).\n\nDeposition within the Stafford Basin continued through the Triassic, when the region lay some 15 to 20º north of the equator. The earliest sediments, mainly conglomeratic and pebbly sandstones, were laid down by northerly flowing braided streams, sourced from the Armorican mountains in what is now the English Channel and Brittany. With time, the river system evolved into a more mature meandering system, and by mid-Triassic times, when the Mercia Mudstone was deposited, a more subdued landscape of broad floodplains and playa lakes had evolved, linked on occasion to the sea. The absence of all younger solid formations from the district is due mainly to uplift and erosion during the Tertiary caused by Alpine collisions to the south.\n\nThe widespread glacigenic deposits of the district are attributed to a Late Devensian ice sheet that advanced into the district sometime after 30 500 years BP. Organic deposits found beneath Devensian till at Four Ashes contain a biota indicative of interglacial and interstadial conditions, dating back to the Ipswichian Stage. Evidence of an earlier glaciation has been reported from buried valleys to the south and east of the district, and from beneath the Main Terrace of the River Severn (see for example Dawson, 1988); as yet, there is no unequivocal evidence for such deposits in the present district. Postglacial erosion has extensively modified the landscape and some of the debris is incorporated in the younger Quaternary river terrace and alluvial deposits.\n\nHistory of research\n\nThe Wolverhampton Sheet was originally surveyed at a scale of six-inches to one mile (1:10 560) in 1915–1923. The accompanying memoir (Whitehead et al., 1928) provides local details but is now out of print. Telford and the surrounding area was remapped in 1970–72, and the Telford 1:25 000 Special Sheet was published in 1977. This work was undertaken to provide an up-to-date geological basis for the development of the New Town. The accompanying memoir (Hamblin and Coppack, 1995) deals mainly with descriptions of the Coal Measures, but remains the primary source of detailed information for the western part of the district. The resurvey of the remaining part of the district was completed in 1993–98.\n\nThe resurvey has made use of recent red-bed research (Besly and Cleal, 1995, 1997; Powell et al., 2000a) to define unambiguously subdivisions within the barren measures of Upper Carboniferous and Early Permian age. Insights into the structural evolution of the district are given by Waters et al. (1994) and a synthesis of the deep structure of the district forms part of a wider study of the West Midlands and Cheshire region (Plant et al., 1999). Groundwater management remains an important area of research, and the Permo-Triassic aquifer is the focus of a major study currently being undertaken by the Environment Agency (Entec, 1998). The Quaternary deposits have received scant attention since the investigations at Four Ashes more than 30 years ago (A V Morgan, 1973). More recent works of note include Hollis and Reed (1981) on the Pleistocene deposits of the Worfe catchment, and Hamblin (1986) on the glacigenic deposits of the Telford area.\n\nSubdivision into tectonic areas\n\nThe main structural elements of the district are shown in (Figure 3). In the north-west, the Market Drayton Horst is an uplifted block, underpinned at shallow depth by Uriconian rocks, and bounded to the south-east by the Boundary Fault of the Coalbrookdale Coalfield. The Permo-Triassic Stafford Basin underlies the central part of the district. Structurally, it comprises a half-graben, controlled along much of its eastern margin by the Breward Fault. Towards the south of the basin, the importance of the Breward Fault declines, and control passes on to the Patshull-Pattingham Fault System; the latter is associated with a basement high (Codsall High). The Stafford Basin deepens to the west of this structure into the Worfield Sub-basin, and to the east into the Bratch Trough. The latter connects southwards to the Worcester Basin. The South Staffordshire Horst in the east includes part of the South Staffordshire Coalfield, where strata of Palaeozoic age crop out or lie at shallow depth. A small downthrown block at the western margin of this horst is termed the Heath Farm Block.\n\nChapter 2 Precambrian\n\nUriconian Volcanic Group [UV]\n\nPrecambrian rocks crop out in the Lilleshall Inlier, where they form the prominent ridge of Lilleshall Hill. The predominantly acidic tuffites exposed here are at least 120 m thick and were described first by Calloway (1879) and later, in more detail, by Whitehead et al. (1928), who suggested they consisted mainly of ‘albite rhyolites’ along with tuffs, breccias and possibly lava flows. The most recent review (Carney et al., 2000) has furnished additional details, summarised below.\n\nThe principal accessible exposures of Uriconian rocks are the crags along the eastern margin of the hill, extending northwards to just below the Memorial. The lower crags [SJ 7291 1554] consist of massive, pink to grey-weathering, lithic-lapilli tuffs and breccias containing 20 to 30 per cent of pale grey or pink, glassy volcanic clasts, together with subordinate crystals of grey, glassy quartz. The matrix is grey to cream and coarse grained, with devitrified glass shards and pumice lapilli. The tuff shows bedding at 1 to 2 m thick scale, about 4 m above the base of the crags. These higher beds include a 2.2 m bed of white-weathering tuff showing sinuous millimetre-scale lamination. This may be the lithology described as a vitric tuff by Whitehead et al. (1928). The sequence is near-vertical to steeply east-dipping, and locally slightly overturned, with a highly pervasive cleavage, visible at millimetre to submillimetre scale.\n\nAcross the summit of the Lilleshall Hill [SJ 7286 1554] and in exposures and crags along the western parts of outcrop, the sequence is mainly in unbedded grey to pink tuffs, with a ‘silty’ surface texture, and with sporadic lithic lapilli tuff layers up to several centimetres thick. Apart from the latter, these tuffs appear uniformly fine grained, but polished rock slabs show they contain abundant pale grey or cream lapilli between 2 and 8 mm in size. In thin section most of the shadowy fragments are seen to consist of devitrified scoria, interspersed with small quartz and K-feldspar crystals, classifying the rock as a pumice lapilli tuff. The tuffs dip westwards, hereabouts, and no cleavage structure is visible.\n\nBasic rocks are exposed in a former quarry near the south-western extremity of the hill [SJ 7275 1540]. In the south of the quarry, they occur as dark green chloritic schists overlying mylonitised siliceous tuffs within a major shear zone dipping 40° to the north. Farther north, the quarry exposes intrusive sheets of dark grey, fine to medium-grained, quartz microgabbro, which is possibly the unsheared equivalent of the chloritic schists.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Uriconian sequence at Lilleshall Hill includes a range of pyroclastic rocks indicative of a highly explosive style of volcanism. The presence of K-feldspar crystals in association with quartz and absence of plagioclase, suggests that the magmas were probably potassic and of rhyolitic composition. Based on tenuous way-up evidence, the succession may be interpreted as part of a density graded sequence characterised by a concentration of lithic material towards the base. Although an origin by processes of pyroclastic flow is possible, there is no evidence for significant welding and the few horizons with sedimentary structures indicate deposition on a wet substrate.\n\nConcealed Precambrian Basement\n\nBorings made by the Shropshire Coal Company from about 1860 onwards encountered what appeared to be Uriconian rocks at depths of between 50 and 100 m in the Hadley area [SJ 673 130] to the north of the Boundary Fault (Hamblin and Coppack, 1995, p.7). Three BGS boreholes sunk in the Leegomery–Kinley–Preston [SJ 671 148] also proved Uriconian banded tuffs and rhyolites beneath Upper Carboniferous beds. In the east of the district, the Heath Farm Borehole penetrated about 180 m of mafic and felsic tuffs of Uriconian affinity.\n\nChapter 3 Cambrian\n\nRocks of Cambrian age crop out in the faulted core of the Lilleshall Inlier. The sequence is poorly exposed, but the Croft Borehole provided a partial section through the Comley and Merioneth series (Lower and Upper Cambrian), which can be correlated with the more widely studied sequences of the Comley and Wrekin areas (Rushton et al., 1988). The absence of St David’s Series (Middle Cambrian) strata from the sequence is attributed (Smith and Rushton, 1993) to syndepositional movements on the Church Stretton Fault System, causing development of a tilt-block high in the Lilleshall area in mid-Cambrian times. Down-dip from Lilleshall, a more complete sequence interpreted as a Cambro-Ordovician basin-fill, is evident on seismic profiles (Chapter 8).\n\nComley (Lower Cambrian)\n\nThe informally named Lower Comley Sandstone [LCmS] comprises a sequence of shallow-water, current-washed, glauconitic sandstones. At Lilleshall, the formation crops out in faulted contact with Uriconian rocks. Sporadic exposures along the roadside to the south-west of the village show sandstone beds dipping at 23 to 50° to the south-east. The uppermost part (12 m) of the formation was also proved in the Croft Borehole, drilled just outside the village (Rushton et al., 1988). The cored sequence comprises green, pink, purple and grey, glauconitic sandstone with highly micaceous bands, and a carbonate matrix. Grey, structureless beds of chert are present towards the base, and bedding styles vary from finely laminated, or cross-bedded, to unbedded. The occurrence 6 m below the top of the formation of the small shelly fossil, Microdictyon, led Rushton et al. (1988) to suggest a correlation with the Strenuella Limestone (Ac4) division of the Lower Comley Limestones (Cobbold, 1921; Cobbold and Pocock, 1934). The sandstones beneath this level could be older but the fossils recovered are nondiagnostic.\n\nIn the Comley type area near Caer Caradoc Hill [SO 4845 9647], the Lower Comley Sandstone is overlain by the Lower Comley Limestones, a thin (2 m), highly condensed sequence of phosphatic sandy limestones, divisable into five members, each lithologically and faunally distinct and separated by disconformities. In the Croft Borehole, this sequence is represented by a single 0.25 m bed of pale grey to black, recrystallised, phosphatic algal limestone. This has yielded shells including Lapworthella, together with sponge spicules, inarticulate brachiopod fragments and Hyolithellus? fragments. Rushton et al. (1988) suggested a correlation with the Lapworthella Limestone Member of the type area.\n\nMerioneth (Upper Cambrian)\n\nThe informally named Dolgelly Beds [DB] are not exposed in the Lilleshall Inlier, but were proved by drilling. A reference section was provided by the Croft Borehole. This proved 53.75 m of black, micaceous shales resting unconformably on Comley Series strata. The sequence is distinctive for its repeated occurrence of parallel laminated or ripple cross-laminated siltstone interbeds. The source of this silt-grade material is not known, but Rushton et al. (1988) suggest derivation from an uplifted block within the Church Stretton Fault complex. Brachiopods and olenid trilobites are concentrated in thin bands, which are separated by greater thicknesses of sparsely fossiliferous mudstone. The sequence spans the zones of Parabolina spinulosa, Leptoplastus and Protopeltura praecursor. In the Comley area, these zones are represented by the Orusia Shales (below) and by the Bentleyford Shales (above). However, as neither of these formations show the characteristic siltstone interbeds noted above, they are not directly comparable, and the informal designation, Dolgelly Beds, adopted for the Telford area (Hamblin and Coppack, 1995), is retained here.\n\nChapter 4 Silurian\n\nSilurian rocks crop out beneath Coal Measures in the Lincoln Hill area [SJ 670 040] of Coalbrookdale, and more extensively in the south-west around Willey. A conformable sequence ranging in age from Wenlock to Prídolí is present at outcrop; older (Llandovery) rocks, equivalent to the Purple Shales and Pentamerus Sandstone formations of the adjoining Shrewsbury district, are presumed to be present in the subsurface.\n\nClassification\n\nThe classification of the Silurian rocks is shown in (Table 2). The subdivisions of the Llandovery Series are those used by Pocock et al. (1938) and Hamblin and Coppack (1995). The nomenclature of the Wenlock Series broadly follows the recommendations of Bassett et al. (1975). However, the term Tickwood Beds is no longer used for the sequence of siltstones and nodular limestones which is transitional between the siltstone-dominated Coalbrookdale Formation, below, and the predominantly limestone lithofacies of the Much Wenlock Limestone, above. Lateral facies variations within this part of the sequence have led to misuse of the term, and it is more appropriate to include these transitional beds within the Much Wenlock Limestone, thereby ensuring the integrity of this formation along its entire outcrop. The Benthall Beds (Hamblin and Coppack, 1995) form a locally distinct lithofacies, laterally equivalent to the reef facies of the Much Wenlock Limestone Formation. The traditional broad lithostratigraphical subdivision of the Ludlow Series is retained in preference to the more modern nomenclature which depends on both lithostratigraphical and biostratigraphical criteria. The approximate correspondence between the two schemes is shown in (Table 2). In the PÅídolí Series, the name Raglan Mudstone Formation is used to give continuity with areas recently mapped to the south-west.\n\nDepositional setting\n\nThe Llandovery, Wenlock and Ludlow rocks are mostly of shallow marine origin, comprising alternations of siliciclastic shelf deposits and shallow-water carbonates with variable amounts of terrigenous material. In mid-Llandovery times, an eastward marine transgression on to the western flanks of the Midland Platform deposited grits and finer grained sediments of the Pentamerus Sandstone and Purple Shales formations. These early Silurian deposits, of Aeronian and Telychian age, are not present at outcrop, but on the evidence of the Heath Farm Borehole are presumed to underlie much of the district. Continued deepening of the sea is indicated by the succeeding muddy and somewhat calcareous sediments of the Buildwas and Coalbrookdale formations. They are sparsely graptolitic but contain a rich shelly macrofauna. Interbedded thin bentonites are testimony to distant volcanic eruptions. Evidence of regression during the late Homerian is provided by the Much Wenlock Limestone Formation. The small reef bodies for which this unit is renowned grew in waters probably no more than 30 m deep (Scoffin, 1971). Corals, stromatoporoids and bryozoans provided the organic framework of the reefs, while reworked bioclastic detritus and carbonate-rich clays accumulated in inter-reef and off-reef environments. Deepening of the sea is generally postulated at the beginning of Ludlow times, followed by a gradual shallowing as the shelly muds of the Lower Ludlow Shales were replaced by shelf carbonates of the Aymestry Limestone. The succeeding Upper Ludlow Shales indicate a return to siliciclastic shoaling conditions with a low diversity brachiopod and bivalve fauna, and evidence of storm sedimentation. At the base of the PÅídolí Series lies the Ludlow Bone Bed. This denticle-rich unit occupies hollows in the uppermost surface of the Upper Ludlow Shales, and is the lowest member of the Downton Castle Sandstone Formation. It is generally regarded as a condensed, low stand, regressive lag deposit, which accumulated in a strandline or wave-winnowed offshore location before being reworked during a later transgressive event (Allen and Tarlo, 1963; Ainsworth et al., 1993). It is overlain by sandstones, siltstones and mudstones of offshore or intertidal facies, followed by sandstones of littoral marine or high-energy shelf facies (Allen, 1985; Ainsworth, 1991). The overlying Temeside Shales show sedimentological features typical of intertidal and subtidal environments subject to periods of prolonged exposure (Allen and Taro, 1963; White and Lawson, 1989). The red beds of the Raglan Mudstone Formation represent deposition on an alluvial coastal plain subject to marine tidal influence (White and Lawson, 1989).\n\nWenlock\n\nThe ‘Wenlock Shale’ of Murchison (1834) comprises two conformable formations, the Buildwas Formation and Coalbrookdale Formation (Table 2). The cover of glacial drift makes it difficult to map precisely the outcrop of these two subdivisions. However on the evidence of published maps (for example Bassett, 1989) and outcrop geometry, it is unlikely that the lower division, the Buildwas Formation, comes to crop. In the subcrop, an intervening limestone, correlated with the Barr Limestone Formation of the Dudley–Walsall area, was proved in the Heath Farm Borehole.\n\nThe Coalbrookdale Formation [Cbrd] consists of a monotonous sequence, about 160 m thick, of olive-grey to dark blue-grey silty mudstones. Thin calcareous siltstones and nodular limestone horizons occur sporadically, and there are numerous thin partings of bentonitic clay. The top of the formation is transitional with the overlying Much Wenlock Limestone, and is defined at the incoming of bands of coalesced limestone nodules which appear some 15 to 25 m below the main limestone development. Within the type area, the formation has a stratigraphical range from mid-Sheinwoodian to late Homerian.\n\nKey localities\n\nThe exposures originally described in Coalbrookdale railway cutting are now much overgrown, but beds in the upper part of the sequence crop out in Loamhole Dingle, just to the west of the district boundary. The largest exposure [SJ 6641 0555] reveals 15 m of blue-grey mudstone with beds of bentonitic clay up to 5 cm thick.\n\nThe succeeding Much Wenlock Limestone Formation [WeL] crops out at Lincoln Hill [SJ 670 040], but within a few hundred metres passes beneath the unconformable cover of Coal Measures. In the Wenlock type area, the formation is the uppermost lithostratigraphical division of the Wenlock Series (Bassett, 1974) and belongs to the ludensis biozone of the Homerian Stage. The formation is renowned for its diverse and generally well-preserved fauna. Palaeontological studies have focused mainly on brachiopods (Hurst, 1975), corals (Abbott, 1976; Powell, 1980) and stromatoporoids (Powell, 1980).\n\nThe basal part of the Much Wenlock Limestone comprises 15 to 25 m of grey shaly mudstones, with bands of discrete limestone nodules, and coalesced nodular beds. This basal unit corresponds to the Tickwood Beds of Pocock et al. (1938) and the Farley Member of the Coalbrookdale Formation (Bassett et al., 1975). The outcrop forms part of the scarp slope of the Much Wenlock Limestone feature. Pocock et al. (1938, p.11) found the fauna of these beds generally rather sparse. However, in contrast to the Coalbrookdale Formation, large benthic brachiopods are present suggesting a shallower water environment than that which prevailed previously. Locally, Gothograptus nassa is common, the basal part of the G. nassa Zone evidently straddling the boundary with the Coalbrookdale Formation. The upper limit of the zone is uncertain, but there is evidence that to the south of the district a horizon 0.9 m below the top of the ‘Tickwood Beds’ belongs to the overlying M. ludensis Zone (Bassett et al., 1975, p.8).\n\nThe main carbonate build-up comprises some 20 m of flaggy, shelly, crystalline limestone, interbedded with impersistent siltstones towards the base and top. The name Benthall Beds [Beb] was introduced (Hamblin et al., 1995) to distinguish this lithofacies from the reef-bearing nodular limestones and siltstones, which are mapped as a separate lithofacies in the adjoining district. At Lincoln Hill [SJ 6720 0415] the Benthall Beds were extensively worked underground and in deep quarries (Pocock et al., 1938, p.116). A middle unit, 12 to 15 m thick, of relatively pure, thickly bedded limestone separates upper and lower sequences of flaggy and concretionary beds. In the roof of the mined middle beds, a waxy, pale grey, bentonitic clay up to 0.1 m thick is present.\n\nThe highest beds of Wenlock age consist of 4 to 5 m of flaggy to thinly bedded crinoidal limestone. These overlie the Benthall Beds just to the west of the district.\n\nLudlow\n\nRocks of Ludlow age crop out in the south-west of the district between the Dean Corner and Willey faults [SJ 675 000], and in separate inliers in the valleys of Dean Brook [SO 695 990] and Linley Brook [SO 685 980]. Generally, the rocks have a gentle south-eastward dip, but low-amplitude folding along a north-easterly trend gives rise to local variations. The Ludlow Series is represented by three divisions: the Lower Ludlow Shales, the Aymestry Limestone and the Upper Ludlow Shales. The correlation of these mappable divisions with the standard Ludlow stratotype (Table 2) is based largely on information from the Dean Borehole, drilled 1.5 km south of Broseley.\n\nApart from an outcrop in the floor of the Severn Gorge at Ironbridge, the main proving of Lower Ludlow Shales [LLu] is in the Dean Borehole, which penetrated the top 44.27 m of the formation. The log records medium grey, argillaceous, calcareous, flaggy siltstones with shelly limestone beds and nodules, which gradually become less calcareous and more silty down-sequence. The top 25 m contain a prolific shelly fauna, dominated by large strophomenids, and are correlated with the Lower Bringewood Formation; the remainder of the sequence is probably equivalent to the Upper Elton Formation; brachiopods are less numerous than in the higher beds, while bivalves are well represented. A full faunal list is given by Hamblin and Coppack (1995, p.18).\n\nThe Aymestry Limestone Formation [AL] crops out in an inlier in the valley of Dean Brook, and along the axis of a north-east-trending anticline between Willey and The Dean, where it forms a prominent ridge. The lower and middle parts of the formation consist of calcareous siltstones and nodular limestones; the upper part comprises massive to flaggy crystalline limestones. Apart from the Dean Borehole, which proved Aymestry Limestone from a depth of 17.5 to 55.5 m, the most complete section was found in a small tributary that enters Dean Brook from the north [SO 699 992] (Whitehead et al., 1928). This exposed some 24 to 30 m of fossiliferous, calcareous mudstone and nodular limestone, commencing at an estimated 6 m above the base of the formation. The section is overgrown and degraded and has not been re-examined since the original survey. Whitehead et al. (1928) provide a comprehensive faunal listing.\n\nOther sections are noted by Hamblin and Coppack (1995).\n\nKey localities\n\nIn the Willey-Dean Anticline, about 6 m of beds in the upper part of the formation are exposed in a roadside section [SJ 6793 0045] 500 m north-west of The Dean. The section has yielded a characteristic Ludfordian assemblage, and the strata can be correlated with the Lower Leintwardine Formation.\n\nA small waterfall [SJ 6836 0025] in a tributary of Dean Brook exposes 0.7 m of coarsely crystalline limestone, taken to be the top bed of the formation.\n\nAbout 30 m downstream of the previous locality, 2 m of interbedded limestone and grey-green, blocky, silty mudstone have yielded faunas indicating a Ludfordian age, and thus a possible correlation with the Upper Leintwardine Formation.\n\nThe Upper Ludlow Shales [ULu] consist of about 50 m of olive-grey calcareous siltstone and mudstone. Limestone nodules and layers are common in the lower part, particularly towards the base in the transitional zone with the Aymestry Limestone. The basal 8 m have a fauna comparable to that occuring at the top of the Aymestry Limestone. The higher beds contain an abundant but restricted shallow-water fauna, in which brachiopods are well represented. The sequence of faunas can be matched with those of the Upper Leintwardine, Lower Whitcliffe and Upper Whitcliffe formations of the type area (Lawson and White, 1989). The Dean Borehole proved Upper Ludlow Shales to a depth of 17.52 m. The beds below 11.38 m are correlated with the Upper Leintwardine Formation, and those above this depth are considered to equate with the Lower Whitcliffe Formation.\n\nKey localities\n\nThe principal exposures are in Dean Brook.\n\nDean Brook [SJ 6752 0056] 2 m of silty mudstone in the middle part of the Upper Ludlow Shales.\n\nBank of sunken lane [SJ 6809 0001] at The Dean, Willey Upper Ludlow Shales, representing part of the Whitcliffe Formation, yielded numerous fossils, but of characteristically restricted variety, including bryozoa.\n\nLinley Brook Beds at the top of the Upper Whitcliffe Formation are exposed at two localities [SO 6862 9807]; [SO 6930 9822]. Details of the more westerly section are given by Bradfield and Tucker (1986).\n\nPÅídolí\n\nThe PÅídolí Series comprises the rocks of Old Red Sandstone facies, traditionally referred to as the Downtonian. Its base is placed at the base of the Downton Castle Sandstone Formation, the junction marked locally by the Ludlow Bone Bed Member. The classification of the Prídolí Series is shown in (Table 2). The principal outcrops are in Linley Brook, along Dean Brook, and on the flanks of the Willey-Dean Anticline.\n\nThe base of the Downton Castle Sandstone Formation [DCS] is exposed in Linley Brook [SO 6893 9816] (Bradfield and Tucker, 1986) and was formerly seen in an excavation in the base of an old quarry at Willey Park Hall [SO 6731 9912] (White and Coppack, 1977). A composite section is given in (Figure 4). In both sections, the basal member of the formation, the Ludlow Bone Bed, is marked by a thin siltstone (0.08–0.20 m), containing fish remains (mainly thelodont denticles) and small black horny brachiopod and annelid fragments. Scattered burrows extend up to 50 mm into the underlying Upper Ludlow Shales, those at Willey commencing immediately beneath the lowest denticle layer. The basal member is in sharp contact with the underlying Ludlow Series, but there is no evidence to suggest a major break in sedimentation.\n\nOverlying the Ludlow Bone Bed are the basal siltstones of the Downton Castle Sandstone, 0.97 to 2.5 m thick, commonly olive-grey, finely cross-laminated, and containing a typical Downtonian fauna of poorly preserved bivalves, ostracods, and brachiopods. Fish scales and spines are present in small numbers locally at the top of this unit. The siltstones are succeeded by thinly interbedded siltstones and sandstones, and a higher unit entirely of sandstone, in all totalling some 6.5 m. The sandstones are mostly yellow, fine grained, micaceous, ripple-laminated or cross-bedded, with scattered fossils including mainly lingulid brachiopods, mollusc and plant remains. A lenticular bone bed, up to 0.07 m thick, occurs about 3 m above the base of the formation at both localities. This horizon may be the lateral equivalent of the Downton Bone Bed of Downton Castle (Ellis and Slater, 1906, p.209).\n\nThe Temeside Shales Formation [TSh] is conformable on the Downton Castle Sandstone Formation, and is represented by a sequence, about 27 m thick, of olive-grey mudstones and siltstones with subsidiary, richly micaceous sandstones. A gully on the right-bank of Linley Brook yielded lingulid brachiopods, vertebrate detritus and plant remains (Whitehead et al., 1928, p.25–26).\n\nKey localities\n\nLinley Brook [SO 6901 9812] Section L18 of Whitehead (1928, p.25). Partial exposure of about 20 m of olive-grey mudstones and micaceous sandstones, including the junction with the Downton Castle Sandstone.\n\nLinley Brook [SO 694 977] Junction of Temeside Shales and Raglan Mudstone Formation.\n\nThe Raglan Mudstone Formation [Rg] succeeds the Temeside Shales, covering much of the higher ground between Willey and Linley. The rocks are chiefly red mudstones in which there are few good sections. Several persistent sandstone beds form hill-cappings. On the evidence of soil brash here, the dominant lithology is greenish grey and black spotted, flaggy, micaceous sandstone. Outcrops of sandstone in the adjoining Shrewsbury district (Sheet 152) have yielded Lingula, ostracods and fish fragments (Whitehead et al., 1928, p.27–28).\n\nChapter 5 Carboniferous and Lower Permian\n\nDinantian\n\nStrata of Dinantian age crop out in the Lilleshall Inlier, and have been proved at depth beneath the northern part of the Coalbrookdale Coalfield. The rocks are now not well exposed but limestone was extensively quarried and mined in the past. The writings of Murchison (1839) and Prestwich (1840) were, until recently, the only reliable sources of information. However, during the last decade, remedial work to counter mining subsidence in Lilleshall village has involved extensive drilling and provided an opportunity to re-examine parts of the sequence in more detail. The results reported here are based on logging and interpretations of selected cored boreholes, summarised by Riley (1998). Formal names are introduced to replace the six informal ‘groups’ recognised by Whitehead et al. (1928). A composite section of the sequence is included (Figure 5).\n\nThe earliest deposits are terrigenous sandstones and conglomerates, which are inferred to be of Late Devonian-Courceyan age. The succeeding carbonates (Jackie Parr Limestone) represent a condensed sequence deposited when Tournaisian seas transgressed on to the margins of the Wales-Brabant landmass. The absence of deposits attributable to the Chadian and Arundian stages signifies a period of intra-Dinantian uplift. Sedimentation resumed in the late Holkerian or Asbian, first with fluvial and alluvial-plain siliciclastics (Lydebrook Sandstone), and then with a further carbonate build-up (Sylvan Limestone).\n\nThe Village Farm Formation [Vlg], equivalent to ‘Group 1’ of Whitehead et al. (1928), comprises some 23 m of beds of predominantly continental facies. Two site investigation boreholes (Lilleshall L6, L17) penetrated the upper part of the unit; a third (Lilleshall L8) proved a full sequence, terminating in the underlying Lower Comley Sandstone.\n\nMuch of the formation consists of polymictic conglomerates, breccias and sandstones, forming upward fining units, 1 to 2 m thick. The breccias and conglomerates contain angular clasts up to 100 mm in diameter of sandstone, quartzite, granophyre and banded rhyolite as well as crinoidal chert and dolomite, indicating erosion of local Precambrian and Palaeozoic source rocks. The sandstones range in colour from red, through pale brown to green, with coarser varieties showing poor sorting and composition approaching greywackes. Beds in the uppermost 3 m are transitional with the overlying formation; they include calcareous sandstones with milletseed grains, and thin supratidal pedogenic carbonates. Intertidal influence is suggested by possible Diplocraterion burrows. In several boreholes, the top of the formation is defined by a fissured surface, which has been interpreted as an unconformity (Ove Arup and Partners, 1987). Whether this represents a significant hiatus is uncertain. If there is an upwards transition into the overlying Jackie Parr Limestone, as appears from the log of the Lilleshall L6 Borehole, then it is likely that the upper part of the formation is also early Tournaisian. However, a Late Devonian age cannot be discounted, particularly for the lower and middle clastic intervals.\n\nThe Jackie Parr Limestone Formation [JKP] is the lower of two marine-dominated intervals. The formation has a maximum thickness of 20 m, which reduces progressively from north to south due to differential overstep by the overlying Lydebrook Sandstone. The sequence is divisible into five lithofacies, L1–5, (Figure 5) which can be correlated throughout the Lilleshall area with the aid of downhole geophysical logs. Detrital carbonates occur at two levels; the lower unit, known colloquially as the ‘Red Limestone’ (L2), was formerly mined at Limekiln Lane [SJ 7330 1590] and Willmoor Lane [SJ 7351 1579]. It comprises 6 m of grey and pink, nodular limestone (packstone/grainstone). The upper unit (L4) is a coarse, dolomitised grainstone with abundant rolled and worn crinoid, brachiopod and bryozoan hash. This latter unit is probably the ‘Grey Limestone’ of Murchison. Units L1, L3 and L5 are predominantly clastic sediments but there are also localised evaporites at the base of the formation.\n\nThe association of lithofacies is indicative of a spectrum of sub-environments ranging from turbulent shallow marine to high intertidal/supratidal conditions. Evidence for the early Tournaisian age of this formation was reviewed by Mitchell and Reynolds (1981). Reynold’s conodont data suggest an assemblage in the Siphonodella Conodont Biozone. According to Mitchell, the macrofauna lies in the Vaughnia vetus Biozone.\n\nThe overlying Lydebrook Sandstone Formation [LyS] marks a return to clastic sedimentation. Borehole provings recorded a fairly uniform sequence, 20 to 23 m thick, of fine to medium-grained sandstone and siltstone, typically grey, purple or pink in colour, with some mudstone interbeds. The formation shows a decrease in thickness to 9 m towards the Boundary Fault, indicating possible synsedimentary movement on this structure during deposition. A maximum thickness of 37 m was recorded locally in the Pitchcroft Mine [SJ 7392 1720], just to the north of the district.\n\nThe base of the formation is severely erosional with overstep on to the underlying strata (see above). Channel-fill facies predominate, particularly where downcutting is greatest. Individual depositional units are organised into 1 to 3 m-thick, upward-fining packages. These commence with a thin basal pebble lag of quartz pebbles and mudstone rip-up clasts. Sandstone is the dominant lithology and this contains a high proportion of well-rounded ‘millet-seed’ grains (Whitehead et al., 1928). Internal structures are dominated by trough and planar cross-stratification, with ripple lamination present in the siltier upper parts of some channels. Plant debris is also preserved in these finely, laminated beds. Blocky siltstones and more rarely mudstones cap some units or form thicker aggradational sequences. These show evidence of pedogenesis, with rootlets, colour mottling and perturbation structures. The sequence is interpreted as a series of vertically and laterally stacked fluvial channels, interspersed with alluvial plain palaeosols.\n\nOn the basis of casts of bivalves and brachiopods recovered from an outcrop of the Lydebrook Sandstone in Wenlock Wood (3km west of the district boundary), Bracewell (1925) concluded that the Lydebrook Sandstone could be assigned an Asbian age: Dibunophyllum Zone (D1 subzone). More recent palynological studies from exposures in the Ironbridge Gorge area (Turner et al., 1995) yielded spores indicative of a late Dinantian (Asbian-Brigantian age).\n\nKey locality\n\nSouth-west of the Lilleshall inlier, outcrops of the Lydebrook Sandstone occur around Horsehay. Pocock et al. (1938) noted 4.5 m of yellow sandstone in an old overgrown quarry [SJ 6735 0625] near Woodlands Farm. Very pebbly sandstones can be seen in small disused quarries [SJ 6750 0645], west-south-west of Doseley Church.\n\nIn the Lilleshall Inlier, the Lydebrook Sandstone is overlain by the Sylvan Limestone Formation [Syl], a 20 m-thick sequence of nodular or rubbly limestone, which is only seen completely in one borehole (Lilleshall L18). The interval includes two thin basalt horizons, which are considered to be attenuated leaves of the Little Wenlock Basalt (see below).\n\nIn cored section, the limestones are nearly all strongly calcretised, and with multiple exposure surfaces. No primary sedimentary structures are preserved, and much of the original fabric has been replaced by fine-grained neomorphic calcite and/or dolomite. Crinoids, corals, brachiopods (Gigantoproductus) and other shell debris are scattered throughout the sequence. Whitehead et al. (1928) listed the fauna. Thin clays with calcrete nodules and fine-grained sandstones form a minor part of the sequence.\n\nThe age of the Sylvan Limestone is poorly constrained but spans the Asbian and Brigantian stages: beds below the lower basalt at Lilleshall definitely include strata of late Asbian age on account of the presence of the brachiopod Davidsoninia septosa (Lilleshall L18 Borehole). Evidence for a Brigantian age is based entirely on historical records of Lonsdaleia floriformis (Murchison, 1839, p.107–9). The Brigantian/Asbian boundary is drawn below the Little Wenlock Basalt in its type area, and is taken here, for present purposes, at the base of the lower basalt leaf at Lilleshall.\n\nDeposition of marine carbonates was interrupted in Asbian times by a volcanic episode that led to the extrusion of basaltic lava, Little Wenlock Basalt [LWB], across parts of the carbonate platform. In the adjoining Shrewsbury district, the basalt occupies a stratigraphical position a few metres above the Lydebrook Sandstone, a position maintained throughout much of its outcrop. In this district, the basalt has a restricted outcrop between Horsehay and Doseley. In a review of the main exposures, Pocock et al. (1938) noted that the basalt was extrusive, comprising highly vesicular and slaggy lavas, and with a bole below the apparently unaltered overlying sediment. Pillow-structures noted in some exposures indicate a local shallow submarine origin. Pocock et al. (1938) classified the rock as a ‘microporphyritic olivine basalt in which small well-formed phenocrysts of olivine occur in a matrix of slender labradorite laths, small granules and prisms of augite, and some finely divided magnetite’. As noted earlier, basalts believed to be contemporaneous with the Little Wenlock Basalt occur in two leaves in a borehole at Lilleshall (Lilleshall L18).\n\nKey locality\n\nThe disused Doseley Quarry [SJ 6750 0680] shows up to 60 m of basalt with fine examples of vertical and inclined columnar jointing.\n\nNamurian\n\nAlthough there are no outcrops which can be unequivocally assigned to the Namurian Stage, rocks resembling the Millstone Grit have been reported from a number of localities. In the Lilleshall Inlier, the Sylvan Limestone is overlain unconformably by a sequence of grey-green, fine to coarse-grained sandstones of uncertain affinity. Up to 12 m of beds are exposed in the limestone quarries to the north of the village [SJ 7356 1656], and a comparable thickness of strata was proved beneath superficial deposits in boreholes drilled down-dip. The beds appear to be dominantly fluvial in origin but much of the primary sedimentology has been overprinted by pedogenesis. In the first survey of the district, these strata were assigned to the Millstone Grit but in later surveys, they were regarded as the basal beds of the Lower Coal Measures, based on the presence of bivalves which were attributed to the species Carbonicola. Re-examination of these specimens has failed to confirm their identification due to poor preservation. Rather than erect a new lithological subdivision, the inclusion of these beds with the Coal Measures is accepted in the interim, pending further work.\n\nKey localities\n\nOther key localities for Namurian strata:\n\nLilleshall No. 2 Borehole The lowest 25 m of strata are conglomerates and sandstones succeeded by fireclays, shales and mudstones, which include a Lingula band. The last is tentatively equated with the basal Westphalian Subcrenatum Marine Band (Ramsbottom et al., 1978).\n\nIn the east of the district, none of the deep boreholes proved undoubted Millstone Grit. However, in the Hilton Main workings, Barnsley (1964) reported ‘some thin gritty sandstones between the Mealy Grey Coal and the pre-Carboniferous basement, which somewhat resemble the Millstone Grit in their lithology’.\n\nThe gamma-ray log for the Heath Farm Borehole shows a sandstone signature (about 710 to 720 m depth), below undoubted Coal Measures, which may correspond to a thin Namurian sequence.\n\nWestphalian to Lower Permian\n\nCoalfields in the east and west of the district contain rocks ranging from Upper Carboniferous to Lower Permian. In the South Staffordshire Coalfield and its concealed northern extension (the Cannock Chase Coalfield), up to 400 m of Coal Measures and 450 m of barren measures rest unconformably on Silurian rocks. A sequence of comparable thickness is preserved in the Coalbrookdale Coalfield. Seven marine bands are known within the Coal Measures, of which the identities of the lowest three (? Subcrenatum, Listeri and Amaliae) are uncertain as they have yielded only poor faunas (Figure 6). The Vanderbeckei Marine Band marks the boundary between the Lower and Middle Coal Measures, and is also the boundary between the Langsettian (Westphalian A) and Duckmantian (Westphalian B) stages. The boundary between the Duckmantian and Bolsovian (Westphalian C) stages is taken at the regionally important Aegiranum Marine Band. In most areas, this is normally the highest marine band found, however in northern parts of the Cannock Chase Coalfield, the Edmondia and Shafton (Silvester’s Bridge) marine bands are also present locally. In both coalfields, there is a diachronous upwards passage at about the level of the Aegiranum Marine Band from Middle Coal Measures into a red-bed-dominated lithofacies in which faunas are sparse, and biostratigraphical control is poor. The ages assigned to this latter group of sedimentary rocks are best estimates, based on studies of plant macroflora, miospore assemblages, nonmarine bivalves and pelycosaur (reptilian) remains (Waters et al., 1995).\n\nThe Upper Carboniferous succession was deposited during the latter stages of the Variscan orogeny. These coincided with a gradual change in climate from humid to semi-arid conditions, when coal-forming back-swamp deposition gave way to red-bed accumulation. Tectonic instability resulted in intermittent sedimentation with localised uplift, folding and erosion.\n\nCoal Measures\n\nThe Lower and Middle Coal Measures were deposited in a poorly drained, delta-plain environment close to the northern margins of the Wales-Brabant High (Guion et al., 1995). The succession consists predominantly of grey mudstone, with subordinate sandstone. The mudstone is typically laminated or pedogenically altered to seatearth with root traces, sphaerosiderite and sideritic ironstone nodules common throughout. Sandstone beds occur most commonly towards the base of the sequence, where they are coarse and pebbly. Coal seams comprise only a small part (13 to 17 per cent) of the total thickness of the sequence, but many of these have been worked extensively. The geology of the southern part of the South Staffordshire Coalfield was described by Whitehead and Eastwood (1927); details of the northern part, also known as the Cannock Chase Coalfield, were reported by Barnsley (1964) and Mitchell (1945). Hamblin and Coppack (1995) have provided a full account of the Coalbrookdale Coalfield.\n\nSouth Staffordshire Coalfield\n\nThe exposed coalfield underlies eastern parts of Wolverhampton, and is bounded to the west by the Western Boundary Fault. The Coal Measures are preserved in a broad south-east-plunging syncline from which the higher strata have been removed by erosion.\n\nThe Coal Measures in the South Staffordshire Coalfield show a gradual thickening northwards into the Pennine Basin. A delicate balance between subsidence and sedimentation is reflected in the variation in thickness of the coal seams and interseam thickness on either side of the Bentley faults. The area south of the faults experienced relatively little subsidence, which resulted in a relatively thin succession and the amalgamation of a number of seams to produce thicker seams such as the Staffordshire Thick Coal. North of the faults, more rapid subsidence led to a thickening of the clastic deposits separating individual coals, and the development of more coals partly due to seam splitting (Figure 6).\n\nShaft records from the exposed coalfield mostly date from the 19th century and provide few lithological details. The succession is illustrated by reference to the Ettingshall Lodge Colliery and Chillington shafts (Figure 7). The former provides the most complete section, penetrating 90 m of Lower Coal Measures [LCM], and a further 46 m of Middle Coal Measures [MCM]. The strata consist predominantly of grey mudstone, which typically shows root traces and a listric texture. Eight coal seams are known, of which the Thick Coal (up to 10.7 m) is the thickest and most persistent. Seam splits affect the Thick, Fireclay and Bottom coals.\n\nNotable thicknesses of sandstone occur below the Mealy Grey and above the New Mine Coal. Of these, the New Mine Rock is the most widely developed, varying between 12 and 30 m in thickness. This includes siltstone and sandy mudstone lithologies and is commonly coarse-grained and pebbly at the base.\n\nIronstones, in the form of sideritic nodules or thin beds, occur sporadically, but are best developed beneath the Mealy Grey Coal (Blue Flats and Diamonds Ironstone), above the Stinking Coal (Pennystone), below the Rubble Coal (New Mine) and below the Thick Coal (Gubbin).\n\nDolerite [D] sills, proved at depth in many boreholes, are thought to emanate from a steep-sided intrusion or stock in the Wednesfield area [SJ 950 005]. One of the thickest sills (up to 36.6 m) intrudes the sequence below the Fireclay Coal at New Cross Farm opencast site [SO 940 995], from where it transgresses to successively lower levels southwards. It lies just above the Bottom Coal at Bowmans Harbour [SO 939 994], and is found between the Bottom and Mealy Grey coals at Priestfield No. 78 pit [SO 6915 9995]. Although the sills have been dated radiometrically (Kirton, 1984), there are discrepancies between the radiometric dates and the deduced stratigraphical ages. However, the concensus is that the bodies were emplaced in Bolsovian times beneath a shallow Westphalian cover.\n\nCannock Chase Coalfield\n\nThe western (concealed) part of the Cannock Chase Coalfield was formerly worked from collieries at Hilton Main and Littleton. Information from these workings and the associated shafts, together with exploratory borings carried out from 1947 onwards has greatly improved knowledge of this area. Selected sections (Figure 7) show the main elements of the stratigraphy and additional details, summarised from Barnsley (1964), are given in (Table 3). About 365 m of Coal Measures are preserved at Holly Bank, increasing to over 400 m (unbottomed) in the Lodgerail Borehole in the north of the district. A much condensed sequence (less than 200 m) overlies a basement high, aligned approximately north-south through Brinsford. This structure appears to have been active throughout the deposition of the Coal Measures, resulting in the accumulation of thin coals and clastic units, which are difficult to correlate with the standard sequence. The Hilton Main Fold belt (Chapter 8) also shows interseam variations, which may relate to tectonic movements in advance of the main late Bolsovian deformation.\n\nCoalbrookdale Coalfield\n\nThe Coal Measures of the Coalbrookdale Coalfield crop out widely between the Lightmoor and Boundary Faults, and south of the Broseley Fault (Figure 1). These two areas represent the south-western limits of the Donnington and Madeley synclines, which plunge north-eastwards. A third, more southerly syncline, the Coalport Syncline, preserves measures, which have a more limited outcrop at Caughley. The variation in the Coal Measures is illustrated by two cross-sections (Figure 8) and additional details are summarised in (Table 4).\n\nLower Coal Measures strata below the Vanderbeckei Marine Band are thickest in the north-east of the coalfield, typically reaching 100 m. A thicker sequence proved in Lilleshall No. 6 Borehole (120.7 m, unbottomed) may have penetrated the highest beds of the Millstone Grit (see p.11). South-westwards, the Lower Coal Measures thin to 37.5 m at Madeley Meadow Pit. This thinning takes place almost entirely within the lower, arenaceous part of the sequence and is caused partly by basin margin onlap and by thinning of individual beds in the condensed sequence. There are few coals in the lower part of the Lower Coal Measures, and only the Little Flint coal has been worked. Higher in the sequence, sandstones become less dominant, and the remainder of the Lower Coal Measures is characterised by fireclays with several worked coals.\n\nThe Middle Coal Measures thicken north-eastwards but the detailed variations are difficult to quantify, due to the diachronous incoming of red beds in the north-east, and the removal of grey measures in the south-west beneath the sub-Etruria unconformity. The greatest overall thickness occurs in the Childpit Lane Borehole (154.2 m). The base of the sequence is defined by the Vanderbeckei (Pennystone) Marine Band. This is the thickest marine band in the coalfield and the only one to contain a significant fauna apart from Lingula. The marine band occupies the lower 1 to 2 m of the Pennystone Ironstone, so named for its small, flat, round nodules. The Pennystone Ironstone lies at the base of the most complete cyclothem in the productive measures, being succeeded by nonmarine mudstone, sandstone (Big Flint Rock), seatearth and the Big Flint Coal. The last was widely worked throughout the coalfield as a single 1.1 to 1.6 m seam, but it splits north-eastwards. Apart from the Big Flint Coal, the thick valuable coals lie in two distinct groups, referred to as the Top and Fungous Coal groups after the highest coal in each.\n\nWashouts affect the continuity of the coal seams in at least three areas. The most significant predates the Gur Coal. It follows a north-east-south-west trend, from Sheriffhales [SJ 760 120] to Dawley [SJ 684 078], and relates to a channel system wholly contained between the Limestone and Lightmoor faults. At its south-western end, it cuts down to the level of the Yard Coal, implying contemporaneous uplift at the basin margins, probably involving movement on the Lightmoor Fault (Hamblin and Coppack, 1995). A second, parallel washout, in the Madeley Syncline, predates the Double Coal, and cuts down to the level of the Vanderbeckei Marine Band at Broseley, in the south-west. A third affects strata down to the Gur Coal, north-west of the Lightmoor Fault.\n\nEtruria Formation [Et]\n\nThe Etruria Formation consists of a rather ill-defined group of mudstones, sandstones and breccio-conglomerates, variegated in shades of grey, red, purple and yellow. Their appearance in the sequence provides the first widespread evidence of Variscan uplift in source areas to the south and west of the coal basin and marks the transition from the poorly drained, alluvial backswamp conditions of the Coal Measures to the free-draining regime of an elevated floodplain. The genesis of these deposits was discussed by Besly and Turner (1983), and further overviews were given by Besly (1988), Besly and Fielding (1989), and Besly and Cleal (1997).\n\nThe formation crops out widely around the Coalbrookdale Coalfield, and is proved in boreholes on the Heath Farm Block (Figure 9). The junction with the underlying Coal Measures is diachronous in the east of the district, but over wide areas of the exposed Coalbrookdale Coalfield, is marked by an unconformity. The top, also marked locally by an unconformity, is taken at the incoming of the predominantly grey measures of the Halesowen Formation. In areas where the Halesowen Formation is also in red-bed facies, this junction may be difficult to identify, but is recognised unambiguously on the basis of sandstone composition, assemblages of detrital clay minerals, and geophysical log response (Besly and Cleal, 1997; Pearce et al., 1999). Sandstones of the Etruria Formation are rich in immature lithic grains, mainly comprising altered basic volcanic material, whereas those of the Halesowen Formation contain an abundance of low-grade metasedimentary grains (chlorite, biotite and muscovite). Much of the formation is probably of Bolsovian age, the transition to red beds occurring at horizons ranging from 10 to 40 m above the Aegiranum Marine Band. Where this marine band is unproven, the lowest strata may possibly be of Duckmantian age.\n\nThe bulk of the sequence consists of upwards-fining units of reddish purple, silty mudstones capped by palaeosols. Evidence of pedogenic alteration is ubiquitous and is recognised by loss of bedding, and distinctive patterns of colour mottling associated with oxidised rootlet beds in which the root traces have been replaced by hematite and goethite. The thickness of individual profiles and the intensity of pedogenic alteration provide an indication of soil maturity, and form a basis for classification (Besly and Fielding, 1989). Sandstones and breccias constitute a variable but locally significant part of the sequence. They are typically coarse grained, and crudely bedded, and are known colloquially as ‘espleys’.\n\nCoalbrookdale\n\nAround the Coalbrookdale Coalfield, the formation varies in thickness from less than 10 m to over 90 m. The isopachyte map (Figure 9) shows a series of north-east-trending troughs with intervening ridges, which parallel the dominant structural grain. The evidence indicates that synsedimentary movements on the major faults strongly influenced sedimentation. In the south of the coalfield the formation is unconformable on Lower and Middle Coal Measures but as the formation thickens into the basin, the basal unconformity becomes steadily less marked, until it dies out. Beneath the unconformity a reddened weathering profile is commonly developed, making it difficult to separate primary red beds from those resulting from secondary reddening. In the Madeley Wood boreholes, the reddening extends 14.3 m below the level of the unconformity.\n\nLithological variations within the Etruria Formation of the Coalbrookdale area were documented by Hamblin and Coppack (1995). Their north-south section (fig. 14) shows that channel-fill ‘espley’ deposits of coarse-grained sandstone and fine-grained breccia are concentrated to the south and west of the coalfield where the formation is thinnest, and where locally derived debris is associated with overstep of the Etruria Formation on to Lower Carboniferous, Silurian and Precambrian rocks.\n\nKey locality\n\nBlockley’s Brickpit [SJ 683 117] provides the type section for the area, exposing some 34 m of strata below the junction with the overlying Halesowen Formation. Red and variegated mudstones and silty mudstones make up 70 per cent of the exposed sequence. Evidence of pedogenic alteration is ubiquitous, and is recognisable by loss of bedding and colour mottling over intervals 2 to 5 m thick. Interbedded with the mudstones are sheet sandstone units and channel bodies, typically 30 to 40 m wide, showing single and multiple phases of fill. The sandstones are compositionally immature, and include matrix-supported breccio-conglomerates containing green mudstone fragments, angular quartz and Uriconian detritus. The mudstones are interpreted as distal fan deposits, and the sandstones as debris flows or channelised stream floods (Besly, 1988). Other brickpits providing similar good sections are those at Caughley [SO 6915 9995] (Plate 1) and at Donnington [SJ 711 114].\n\nSouth Staffordshire Coalfield, Heath Farm block and Stafford basin subcrop\n\nIn the exposed coalfield, the Etruria Formation crops out below drift against the Western Boundary Fault [SO 924 975]. On the adjoining Heath Farm Block, the formation is concealed by younger strata and its distribution is known only from shaft records and coal exploration boreholes. The thickest sequences are preserved in the axes of major synclines, with thinning over the crests of anticlines, owing to denudation beneath the sub-Halesowen unconformity (Figure 9). For example, in the Holly Bank Colliery Staple Pit, located close to the axis of the Windmill Syncline, at least 129 m were reported. This contrasts with provings over the Brinsford Anticline, where the basal Halesowen unconformity cuts down to levels below the Aegiranum Marine Band, and the Etruria Formation is entirely cut out. Farther north, thicknesses of about 70 m were recorded in the Lodgerail and Bangley boreholes. Locally, on the Heath Farm Block, the formation is divisible into an upper sandstone-rich, and a lower sandstone-poor unit, as seen in the Saredon Hill Borehole (Besly and Cleal, 1997). The distribution of the formation beneath the Stafford basin is not known, but it is apparently absent in the Stretton Borehole.\n\nHalesowen Formation [Ha]\n\nThe Halesowen Formation records a partial return to Coal Measures type sedimentation, in which grey measures predominate over red beds. The principal outcrops are around the Coalbrookdale Coalfield, where the base is marked by the widely developed Main Sulphur Coal. Palynological samples from this horizon have been dated as late Bolsovian (Owens, in Hamblin and Coppack, 1998, p.38), although this conflicts with the early Westphalian D age ascribed by Butterworth and Smith (1976) to a suite of samples from about this horizon. Macrofloral determinations on selected borehole material support a Westphalian D age but give consistently younger ages than those indicated by palynological studies (Besly and Cleal, 1999).\n\nComparative sections (Figure 10) show that the formation generally maintains a fairly constant thickness of between 120 and 150 m. The formation is present at depth beneath the Stafford Basin, and is also proved in boreholes on the Market Drayton Horst (Leegomery House Farm, Kinley Farm and Lodge Farm), where it rests directly on Uriconian basement, with no evidence of an intervening Etruria Formation.\n\nCoalbrookdale\n\nIn the Coalbrookdale area, the formation comprises roughly equal proportions of sandstone and mudstone. It includes 11 coals, all thin and pyritic, and several beds of Spirorbis limestone of lacustrine origin. Major, named sand bodies are distributed at the base of the unit, and more persistently through the mid-parts of the succession, where multistorey stacks 20 to 40 m thick occur. Individual bodies are sheet-like in form and can be traced for several kilometres. The Thick Rock is the best example, reaching 38.1 m at Kemberton Pit [SJ 7129 0556]. It consists of thickly bedded, medium to coarse-grained, locally conglomeratic sandstone, with much carbonaceous material, comminuted coal and scattered plant stems. The sandstones are a characteristic green colour when fresh, due to an abundance of rock fragments rich in muscovite, biotite and chlorite. Individual sandstone bodies fine upwards and are capped by well-bedded to blocky mudstones and silty mudstones. These, too, are commonly micaceous and dominantly greyish green, but red and purple mottling occurs throughout the formation, and is particularly prevalent towards the top. The upper formational boundary is gradational and is taken at the incoming of red-brown sandstones having the compositional characteristics of the Salop Formation (p.17). Exposures, many of them temporary, are listed by Hamblin and Coppack (1995).\n\nHeath Farm block and Stafford basin subcrop\n\nIn the concealed sequence of the Heath Farm Block, the Halesowen Formation rests unconformably on older strata (Whitehead et al., 1928, p.165; Mitchell, 1945, p.14; Hoare, 1959; Barnsley, 1964; Besly and Cleal, 1997). The effects of the unconformity are demonstrated most convincingly in the Hilton area [SJ 942 042], where the underlying Coal Measures and Etruria Formation are strongly folded, and the base of the formation rests on an eroded surface, ranging from 198 m above the Aegiranum Marine Band to 46 m below it (Figure 7). Secondary reddening of rocks beneath the unconformity is recorded in some boreholes, with staining penetrating to depths of several metres.\n\nAs in Coalbrookdale, there are major sand bodies in the lower and middle parts of the sequence but, towards the top of the sequence, there is a prominent argillaceous unit. This corresponds to the Dark Slade Member of other areas, and forms a distinctive facies, 40 to 50 m thick, comprising interbedded laminated mudstones, with caliche nodules, thin nonmarine limestones and rare sandstones. It is characterised geophysically by one or more high gammaray radiation peaks and is an important lithostratigraphical marker (Besly and Cleal, 1997). As the Halesowen Formation is traced eastwards into the Wood Lane-Cheslyn Hay area and to the north, the whole sequence passes laterally into red-bed facies.\n\nDepositional environment\n\nPetrographical and heavy mineral studies indicate that the source rocks for the Halesowen Formation were rich in mica-schist, with garnet and chloritoid the most significant heavy minerals (Hallsworth, 1992a, b). The Cornubian-Armorican Highlands, located far to the south of the Wales-Brabant Massif are considered the most likely source of this detritus. Deposition is thought to have occurred on a poorly drained alluvial plain, subject initially to conditions of high flux and low aggradation (Glover and Powell, 1996; Besly, 1988). These conditions resulted in a lack of accommodation space that allowed laterally persistent sand bodies to accumulate over wide areas. The association of carbonates and thin, laterally impersistent coals indicate that the water table was sufficiently high at times to allow local colonisation by plants and the establishment of peaty mires on the floodplain. During the latter stages of deposition, the association of colour-mottled palaeosols, laminated mudstones and fresh-water carbonates indicates a change from a fluvial-dominated system to one of mainly lacustrine facies.\n\nSalop Formation [Sal]\n\nThe Salop Formation, of assumed Westphalian D- Stephanian age, is a red-bed sequence, conformable on the Halesowen Formation, and overlain unconformably by the Permian Clent Formation (Figure 10). The formation was defined in the West Midlands (Powell et al., 2000a) to remove inconsistencies in nomenclature arising from miscorrelation of the lower mudstone-dominated part of the formation. The Salop Formation includes the former ‘Keele Formation’ of some areas (now Alveley Member) in its lower part, and the former Enville Formation (now Enville Member), in its upper part. The formation has an estimated maximum thickness in the east of the district of 290 m (proved in the Four Ashes Borehole). In Coalbrookdale, a similar thickness of strata is preserved, although wide variations are reported, which Hamblin and Coppack (1995) partly ascribed to a northward and eastward thickening of the measures, and partly to the fact that the base of the redbed facies transgresses diachronously down-sequence.\n\nAlveley Member [Alv]\n\nThis lower subdivision of the Salop Formation consists of red brown and purple, calcareous mudstones with beds of red brown, fine-grained sandstone, intraformational mud-flake conglomerates and caliche nodule layers. Thin, discontinuous beds of Spirorbis limestone are developed locally. The base of the member is gradational with the underlying Halesowen Formation but is taken at the upward change from micaceous sandstone of Pennant-type, to sandstones in which detrital carbonate material is the most distinctive constituent (Besly and Cleal, 1997). This transition coincides approximately with a change in dominant sediment colour from grey and purplish grey to bright orange-red.\n\nThe outcrop of the Alveley Member forms a north-south belt of low ground from Hugh’s Bridge near Lilleshall, to the Severn Gorge, west of Sutton Maddock. The beds are poorly exposed, owing to their low relief and an extensive cover of drift. Along its outcrop, the base of the unit is taken beneath a persistent sandstone, known informally as the Brookside Rock. As the sequence is traced east and north beneath younger cover rocks, red measures occur at progressively lower levels in the sequence, and the true base of the formation is difficult to locate. It may be that much of the sequence originally reported as ‘Keele Formation’ (i.e. Alveley equivalent) is in fact reddened Halesowen facies. The greatest thickness of strata reported above the Brookside Rock is 158.5 m in Lilleshall No. 6 Borehole, but, generally, thicknesses are around half that figure.\n\nEnville Member [En]\n\nThe Enville Member encompasses the sequence of sandstone and conglomeratic sandstone beds that dominate the higher parts of the formation. The sandstones are red brown, quartzose, pebbly in part, and include clasts of Carboniferous limestone, chert, Silurian sandstone, and quartzite. The base of the member is taken beneath the first distinctive pebbly sandstone with extrabasinal clasts. The upper boundary, with the Clent Formation is not exposed in the district but, in the subcrop, is taken fairly arbitrarily at the point on geophysical logs where there is an upwards change from a sandstone to a mudstone-dominated sequence. However, the recognition of Clent Formation lithologies depends on the identification of diagnostic volcaniclastic breccias (see below).\n\nThe lower sandstones in the sequence form a west facing scarp which runs southwards from Lilleshall Hall to Halesfield; higher sandstones form scarp features farther to the east. In the centre of the outcrop, west of Shifnal, six persistent major sandstones can be distinguished, of which the second and fifth include the most conglomeratic beds.\n\nKey locality\n\nEnville Member: M52 Motorway cutting [SJ 738 090] 14 m section of sandstone and pebbly sandstone (Plate 2a) and (Plate 2b). The mid-part of the section consists of strongly imbricated breccio-conglomerates, showing weak trough cross-bedding, and crude normal grading. Erosion surfaces delineate channelised bedforms, typically 15 to 20 m wide and only a metre or so thick. Clasts, which average 5 cm in diameter, but range up to 15 cm, include chert, Carboniferous limestone, jasper, quartz and quartzite.\n\nHeath Farm block and Stafford basin subcrops\n\nCoal exploration boreholes were mostly open holed through the Salop Formation but geophysical logs show the overall variation in proportions of sandstone to mudstone; Stretton Borehole: (Figure 10). The Alveley Member is up to 100 m thick, and the Enville Member up to 200 m. Surface exposures are limited to a small cutting along Holly Bush Lane [SJ 9610 0600], where poorly exposed sandstones are tentatively classified as Alveley Member.\n\nDepositional environment\n\nThe mud-dominated Alveley Member formed under slow rates of sedimentation on a semi-arid alluvial plain. Well developed caliche palaeosols and reworked caliche nodules provide evidence of an increasingly arid climate, with high rates of evapotranspiration. Sandstones are likely to have been deposited during flash floods or from high sinuosity fluvial systems (Glover and Powell, 1996). The Spirorbis limestones are considered to represent lensoid units rather than single continuous beds. This reflects their formation in localised shallow lakes resulting in their lateral impersistence and low preservation potential. The sand dominated Enville Member records renewed fluvial dominated sedimentation with material sourced from local sources, mainly from uplifted areas on the Wales-Brabant Massif (Pearce et al., 1999).\n\nClent Formation [Cle]\n\nIn its type area of the Clent Hills [SO 935 807] to the south of the district, the Clent Formation marks a major change in provenance and lithofacies from the underlying Salop Formation. Proximal breccias characterised by Uriconian volcaniclastic clasts form a distinctive lithofacies, and the formation is demonstrably unconformable on Upper Carboniferous strata (Whitehead and Pocock, 1947, p.94). As the formation is traced northwards (basin ward) from the Clent Hills, the proportion of breccias decreases with a concomitant increase in the proportion of mudstone and thin beds of sandstone. This more distal facies has been mapped to the south-west of Wolverhampton, (Powell, 1991), where it forms a subdued topography typified by broad slopes with only minor features formed by the coarser beds. The formation is assumed to extend northwards into the present district, but its distribution is poorly known because of the difficulty of distinguishing Clent lithologies from those of the underlying Salop Formation, particularly in the areas of thick drift cover. Consequently in the hanging-wall side (west) of the Western Boundary Fault, the two formations are shown undivided.\n\nIn central Wolverhampton, the Fallings Park Borehole proved some 91.4 m of ‘marl’ with subordinate sandstone, and similar lithologies were recorded in the 112 m deep Oxley (Wolverhampton Gasworks) boring. Both boreholes are thought to have been sunk mainly in the Clent Formation. Immediately to the west of the Bushbury Fault, the Clent Formation is absent below the sub-Triassic unconformity. However, the regional westward dip brings the formation to incrop farther west in the Heath Farm Block, where it was recorded in the Four Ashes Borehole. This penetrated the base of the Triassic at 179.7 m, then continued in a sequence of mudstones (sparsely sampled), before entering undoubted Enville Member conglomerates. It is difficult to define the base of the Clent Formation unequivocally in this borehole because of irregular sampling, but it is tentatively taken at 201.2 m, giving a total thickness for the formation, hereabouts, of 21.6 m.\n\nOther provings in which the Clent Formation has been tentatively identified form a set close to, and just north of, the northern boundary of the district (Bangley, Lodgerail, Teddesley and Ashflats boreholes). Gamma-ray logs show a mudstone-dominated unit, ranging in thickness from 38 m (Lodgerail) to about 100 m (Ashflats), unconformably overlain by Triassic strata and apparently downcutting in a north-easterly direction through sandstones of the Salop Formation (Enville Member). The boreholes were not cored through this interval, but if the assignation of these beds to the Clent Formation is correct, the correlation suggests that an angular unconformity is present at the base of the formation in the north-east of the district.\n\nThe Clent Formation is interpreted as the distal facies of a large-scale alluvial fan system, which was deposited under semi-arid conditions. Breccias and conglomerates represent more proximal elements derived from eroding uplands of Neoproterozoic and volcanic rocks to the south and west.\n\nChapter 6 Late Permian and Triassic\n\nThe central part of the district between the Coalbrookdale and South Staffordshire coalfields is underlain by up to 700 m of Late Permian and Triassic rocks forming the sedimentary fill to the Stafford Basin. Structure contours drawn on the base of the lowermost formation (Bridgnorth Sandstone or Kidderminster Formation) show the form of the basin (Figure 11a), and downhole geophysical logs for the Stretton Borehole illustrate the signatures of the constituent formations (Figure 12).\n\nBridgnorth Sandstone Formation [BnS]\n\nThe aeolian Bridgnorth Sandstone (Warrington et al., 1980) crops out in a relatively narrow belt on the western margins of the Stafford Basin, where it rests unconformably on, or in fault contact with, older rocks. It dips eastwards beneath younger strata towards the centre of the basin. The thickness of the formation is highly variable due to irregularities on the pre-existing topographical surface, and to syndepositional movements on major basin-bounding faults. However, the general trend is one of southward thickening into two sub-basins that lie on either side of the Codsall High (Figure 11b). The implication from the isopachytes is that synsedimentary growth occurred on the Pattingham-Patshull Fault System during deposition of this formation. On the Market Drayton Horst, boreholes record up to 80 m of beds. In the other western outcrops, to the east of the Coalbrookdale Coalfield, the formation thickens southwards from about 25 m at Woodcote Hill to about 130 m at Grindle. Thicknesses adjacent the Pattingham-Patshull Fault System exceed 300 m, although no boreholes have penetrated to the base. East of the Breward Fault, the formation is thin or absent from the north and central part of the Heath Farm Block, but thickens southwards into the Bratch Trough. There are no unequivocal provings east of the Bushbury Fault.\n\nLithologically, the sandstone is dull red-brown, fine to medium-grained and pebble-free. Grains are well rounded, often resembling ‘millet seed’ and are weakly cemented by a thin layer of iron oxide (Shotton, 1937). Large-scale, dune-bedding is characteristic (Plate 3), with solitary sets displaying planar cross-stratification and grouped sets, trough cross-bedding (Karpeta, 1990). Sets range up to 20 m high and 60 to 100 m across, with foreset dips of between 25 and 30°. Individual foresets show normal to reverse grading in units up to 10 cm thick, and less commonly, a diffuse bimodal grain-size lamination on a scale of a few millimetres. Coarser laminae are thought to represent sandflow deposits formed by material avalanching down the steep lee sides of migrating dunes; finer laminae are attributed to grainfall processes involving fall-out of material carried in suspension. Planar bedded units make up a small proportion (12 per cent) of the Hatton Grange core, and are interpreted as interdune dry sandsheets. Quartz is the dominant constituent (95 per cent) with minor feldspar and volcanics grains (Hough, 1997). Calcite concretions observed in cored samples may relate to rootlet activity, and indicate the development of poor soils (Hough and Barnett, 1998).\n\nKey localities\n\nWoodcote Hill [SJ 7645 1471] The basal beds (6.2 m) of the formation show red-orange, very well sorted sandstone with well-developed hummocky cross-bedding and brown, coarsegrained sandstone, with spherical and smooth-surfaced, millet-seed grains.\n\nBrimstree Hill road-cutting [SJ 7513 0582] The junction between Bridgnorth Sandstone and Kidderminster Formation\n\nApley Park [SO 7290 9681] A section in uppermost beds shows large-scale, high-angle, cross-stratified aeolian sets.\n\nDepositional environment\n\nShotton (1937) interpreted the Bridgnorth Sandstone as the product of the repeated westward migration of a system of simple barchan palaeodunes. In a refinement of this model, Karpeta (1990) working on the outcrops around Bridgnorth, concluded that three recurrent facies were identifiable; isolated large-scale transverse dunes (or draa), barchanoid draa and bimodal sand sheets with isolated dome dunes. His study confirmed that draa orientation was controlled by a prevailing easterly wind, but he also recognised the importance of medium-term fluctuations from a more northerly direction, affecting smaller scale dune bedforms.\n\nSherwood sandstone group\n\nThis name was introduced (Warrington et al., 1980) for the sequence of predominantly continental red beds that makes up the lower part of the British Triassic succession. The group comprises, in upwards sequence, the Kidderminster Formation, the Wildmoor Sandstone Formation and the Bromsgrove Sandstone Formation.\n\nThe Kidderminster Formation [Kdm] (Warrington et al., 1980) known formerly as the Bunter Pebble Beds, crops out on both sides of the Stafford Basin half-graben. It consists of texturally mature, pebble/cobble conglomerates, medium to coarse-grained sandstones and sparse, thin, mudstone beds, and ranges in thickness from 50 to 160 m. Outcrops on the western limb give rise to one or more parallel escarpments that are best developed in the northern part of the crop (north of Lizard Hill), and south of Stockton. Over the intervening ground, and particularly around the Sands [SJ 754 047], the escarpment is much subdued, and disrupted by faulting. Evidence from boreholes drilled down-dip to the east suggests that this may be due to the relatively poor development of a basal conglomeratic unit, hereabouts. In the eastern crop, the basal conglomeratic beds form a series of prominent hills stretching from Hatherton in the north, through Saredon Hill, to Bushbury Hill on the northern outskirts of Wolverhampton. The formation is unconformable on the Bridgnorth Sandstone west of the Breward Fault, and on Upper Carboniferous (Salop Formation) rocks over most of the Heath Farm Block. The junction with the overlying Wildmoor Sandstone Formation is transitional, and difficult to recognise, particularly in uncored boreholes, but is drawn conventionally at the point above which the sequence becomes pebble free.\n\nBorehole provings are too sparse too produce a detailed isopachyte map but thicknesses for the better constrained sites are given in (Figure 11c). Over much of the central part of the basin, thicknesses range from 100 to 150 m. These decrease to around 50 m in the north-west and north-east. A narrow graben, the Westward-Hayward Trough (Figure 17), on the margins of the exposed South Staffordshire Coalfield preserves a Triassic sequence, 226 m thick, the greater part of which is believed to be Kidderminster Formation.\n\nIn many parts of the basin the fill commences with a unit composed dominantly of clast and matrix-supported conglomerates, 40 to 60 m thick These contain pebbles of ‘liver-coloured’ and grey-brown quartzite, vein-quartz and rarer siliceous types including chert, rhyolite, and tuff. The pebbles display pitting and siliceous rims at points of contact, and are commonly bound by a carbonate cement. The conglomerate beds show a range of internal structures including poorly developed horizontal stratification and planar or trough cross-stratification. Interfingering sandstones, pebbly sandstones and red-brown micaceous mudstones form a minor part of the sequence (less than 30 per cent at Saredon Hill). Aeolian grains reworked from the Bridgnorth Sandstone are present in beds up to 8 m above the base of the formation (Hough and Barnett, 1998). On geophysical logs, the basal conglomeratic unit is readily distinguished by its uniformly low gamma-ray values and high sonic velocities (about 75 ms/ft). It is overlain, in places sharply, by a sandstone unit in which pebbles are dispersed or form discrete lenses or channel lags. The sandstones are typically red-brown, flecked white, fine to coarse grained and slightly micaceous. Primary structures include planar cross-stratification and multiple upward-fining packages. Although this twofold subdivision is recognisable at selected sites and in geophysical log profiles, the distribution and lateral continuity of the individual units is poorly known, and neither is mappable on a regional basis. As noted above, the basal beds in the western outcrops are relatively poor in conglomerates. One possible explanation is that the sequence onlapped westwards and the beds are younger than those proved in the axis of the basin.\n\nThe conglomerates are interpreted as having formed as mid-channel and longitudinal bars in a fluvial braided stream environment; the sandstones and pebbly sandstones represent deposition as subaqueous dunes and sand waves (Steel and Thompson, 1983). Regional palaeogeographical constructions (Wills, 1948; Fitch et al., 1966; Audley-Charles, 1970; Warrington and Ivimey-Cook, 1992) envisage deposition occurring in a northward-flowing, braided-river system sourced mainly from the Variscan mountains in the Wessex Channel area between England and France. The initial influx of coarse conglomeratic material was probably confined tectonically to the eastern margins of the developing half-graben, where the facies is thickest and syndepositional movement on major bounding faults can be demonstrated. The ensuing reduction in pebble size and volume, together with the increase in the proportion of sandstone to conglomerate, suggest a reduction in stream flow through time, possibly reflecting decreasing relief in the source areas.\n\nNo fossils are known from the formation in the district. However, occurrences of a crustacean (Euestheria) in the adjoining Lichfield district (Cantrill, 1913; Barrow et al., 1919) reflect a contemporary fauna. To the south, in the Droitwich district, Wills and Sarjeant (1970) recorded trace fossils, including Permichnium, of possible insect origin, and vertebrate tracks; the latter were restudied by Sarjeant (1996) but King and Benton (1996) considered these structures to be artefacts of inorganic origin. Warrington et al. (1980) assigned an Early Triassic age to the formation.\n\nKey localities\n\nSaredon Hill Quarry [SJ 946 080] (Plate 4a) and (Plate 4b) The quarry exposes an upwards passage from cemented pebbleconglomerates, through pebbly sandstones to pebble-free sandstones. The south-west corner of the quarry (at the time of inspection in 1996) shows pebble-conglomerates interbedded with sandstones in the proportions 70:30. The sandstones are up to 2 m thick, and show low-angle planar cross-bedding, with pebble ‘stringers’ on reactivation surfaces. The conglomerates vary from clast to matrix supported, are bimodal, locally imbricated, and display vague cross-stratification.\n\nStanton Hill Wood [SJ 7635 0780] This abandoned quarry exposes 8.8 m of sandstone with scattered pebbles and pebble stringers. A channel-fill conglomerate, 1m thick, occurs close to the top.\n\nEssington Quarry [SJ 944 038] A 16 m face shows thickly bedded, clast and matrix-supported pebble-conglomerate, with subordinate (less than 20 per cent) interbedded, discontinuous, planar cross-bedded sandstones. Foresets indicate flow to the north-west.\n\nHatton Grange [SJ 7626 0378] A 7 m section exposes medium to coarse-grained, trough cross-bedded sandstone. Sets are 0.3 to 1.3 m thick and have pebble lags (primarily angular mudclasts) mostly along set-bounding surfaces. Foresets indicate that flow was northwards (N006º).\n\nOld Forge Bridge, Grindleforge [SJ 7533 0323] A cliff section, 5 m high, through the lower part of the formation, is composed dominantly of lateral accretion (point-bar) sand bodies, ordered in sets 2 to 3 m thick, with rarer, thinner mudstone beds. Pebbles are sporadic, and rest on major and minor set surfaces and bedding planes. A small proportion of sand grains are well rounded and probably aeolian, reworked from the underlying Bridgnorth Sandstone Formation.\n\nThe name Wildmoor Sandstone Formation [WrS] was introduced (Warrington et al., 1980) for beds formerly termed Upper Mottled Sandstone. The formation crops out around the margins of the Stafford Basin half-graben, where it gives rise to a subdued topography, and, in drift free areas, red sandy soils. The maximum thicknesses are inferred to occur in the south of the district in two areas most clearly identified by Bouguer gravity data (see 1:50 000 sheet inset map). Boreholes drilled over the gravity anomaly to the west of the Pattingham Fault (Figure 11c) proved 240 m of strata at Stableford Pumping Station; a comparable thicknesss may be present beneath a second anomaly, coincident with the northern limit of the Bratch Trough. The formation thins towards the outcrop in the west (to around 50 m) and is overstepped "
