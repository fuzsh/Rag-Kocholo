        "text": "Saddam Hussein’s death sentence was celebrated by some Sunday as justice deserved or even divine, but denounced by others as a political ploy two days before critical U.S. midterm congressional elections.\n\nWorldwide, the range of reactions – including a European outcry over capital punishment and doubts about the fairness of the tribunal that ordered Saddam to hang – reflected new geopolitical fault lines drawn after America’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003 and depose its dictator.\n\nThe European Union welcomed the verdict but said Saddam should not be put to death.\n\nAt the Vatican, Cardinal Renato Martino, Pope Benedict XVI’s top prelate for justice issues, called the sentence a throwback to “eye for an eye” vengeance.\n\n“This is not the way to present the new Iraq to the world, which is different from Saddam, who was behind hundreds of thousands of deaths as well as death-penalty sentences,” said Hands Off Cain, an Italian organization working to rid the world of capital punishment.\n\nIslamic leaders warned that executing Saddam could inflame those who revile the United States, undermining President Bush’s policy in the Middle East and inspiring terrorists.\n\n“The hanging of Saddam Hussein will turn to hell for the Americans,” said Vitaya Wisethrat, a respected Muslim cleric in Thailand, which has its own Islamic insurgency in that country’s south.\n\nPraising the Iraqi judiciary for its independence, the White House denied arranging for the verdict to be announced just two days before pivotal elections in which Democrats are fighting for control of Congress.\n\n“The idea is preposterous,” said Tony Snow, Bush’s spokesman.\n\nAlthough some voiced doubts that Saddam would actually be hanged, the International Federation for Human Rights denounced the death sentence, warning that it “will generate more violence and deepen the cycle of killing for revenge in Iraq.”\n\nThe Council of Europe called it “futile and wrong” to execute Saddam.\n\nLouise Arbour, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, urged Iraq to ensure a fair appeals process and to refrain from executing Saddam even if the sentence is upheld.\n\nIn Pakistan, an opposition religious coalition claimed American forces have caused more deaths in 3 ½ years in Iraq than Saddam did during his 23-year rule, and insisted Bush should stand trial for war crimes.\n\nIn the Arab world, some Muslims saw the sentence as divine retribution, while others decried it as a farce.\n\nIran, which fought an eight-year war against Saddam’s Iraq and is a bitter opponent of the United States, praised the death sentence and said it hoped that Saddam – denounced by one lawmaker as “a vampire” – still would be tried for other crimes.\n\nKey U.S. allies – including Britain and Australia – welcomed Sunday’s verdict, which had been widely expected.\n\n“Appalling crimes were committed by Saddam Hussein’s regime. It is right that those accused of such crimes against the Iraqi people should face Iraqi justice,” British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said in a statement.\n\nAmnesty International questioned the fairness of the trial, and international legal experts said Saddam should be kept alive long enough to answer for other atrocities.\n\nKonstantin Kosachyov, the Kremlin-allied head of the international affairs committee in Russia’s lower house of parliament, said the sentence would deepen divisions in Iraq. But Kosachyov expressed doubts that Saddam would actually be executed.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said the verdict handed down to Saddam Hussein was the appropriate result – but she does not want him executed.\n\nTimeline of the court case\n\nJune 17, 2005: First criminal case filed against Saddam Hussein and seven co-defendants, charged in the deaths of about 150 Shiites after a 1982 assassination attempt against the Iraqi president in Dujail.\n\nOct. 19, 2005: The trial opened. Saddam said he would not recognize the court’s authority but pleaded not guilty. A dozen armed men seized a defense lawyer from his Baghdad office. His body was found in a lot nearby.\n\nNov. 8, 2005: Gunmen ambushed two defense lawyers, killing one and seriously wounding the other.\n\nNov. 28, 2005: The trial resumed. Saddam seized the floor for a verbal assault on American military guards.\n\nDec. 5, 2005: The first witnesses took the stand, offering gripping accounts of torture.\n\nDec. 21, 2005: Saddam accused American military guards of beating and torturing him and his co-defendants.\n\nJanuary 2006: The chief judge resigned, saying he was frustrated with the tribunal’s failure to defend him against widespread criticism.\n\nJan. 23, 2006: A new judge was appointed to take charge of the trial.\n\nJune 21, 2006: A senior lawyer on Saddam’s defense team was abducted, beaten and shot to death.\n\nJuly 23, 2006: Saddam was hospitalized and being fed with a tube after starting a hunger strike July 7.\n\nJuly 27, 2006: The trial ended after nine months.\n\nNov. 5, 2006: The verdicts were announced. Saddam was convicted of crimes against humanity and was sentenced to death by hanging.\n\nThe New York Times"
