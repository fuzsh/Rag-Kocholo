        "text": "US judge refuses to stay Saddam's execution; US forces put on alert for a surge in violence in Iraq and possible reprisals in America.\n\nBy AP, JPOST STAFF\n\nIraqi state-run television said that former dictator Saddam Hussein had been executed early Saturday morning. \"Criminal Saddam was hanged to death,\" state-run Iraqiya television said in an announcement. The station played patriotic music and showed images of national monuments and other landmarks. The station said Saddam's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court, were also hanged. \"The execution started with criminal Saddam, then Barzan, then Awad al-Bandar,\" an Iraqiya announcer said. The station broadcast national songs and had a tag on the screen that read: \"Saddam's execution marks the end of a dark period of Iraq's history.\" Other Arab TV stations, including Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya and US-financed Al-Hurra, aired live footage of the sun beginning to rise over Baghdad's Firdous Square, where US Marines hauled down a statue of Saddam on April 9, 2003. A US judge refused to stop the execution an hour earlier, rejecting a last-minute court challenge by the former Iraqi president. \"Petitioner Hussein's application for immediate, temporary stay of execution is denied,\" US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said after a hearing over the telephone with attorneys. The official witnesses to Saddam Hussein's impending execution gathered Friday in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone in final preparation for his hanging, as state television broadcast footage of his regime's atrocities. With US forces on high alert for a surge in violence, the Iraqi government readied all the necessary documents, including a \"red card\" - an execution order introduced during Saddam's dictatorship. \"US forces in Iraq are obviously at a high state of alert anytime because of the environment that they operate in and because of the current security situation,\" Defense Department spokesman Bryan Whitman said. Closer to home, US officials said that people should be vigilant about the possibility of a terror attack associated with Saddam's impending execution in Iraq. But an advisory that the FBI and the Homeland Security Department sent to local law enforcement agencies and intelligence community figures was routine and did not cite any specific threat. As the hour of his death approached, Saddam received two of his half brothers in his cell on Thursday and was said to have given them his personal belongings and a copy of his will. Najeeb al-Nueimi, a member of Saddam's legal team in Doha, Qatar, said he too requested a final meeting with the deposed Iraqi leader. \"His daughter in Amman was crying, she said 'Take me with you,\"' al-Nueimi said late Friday. But he said their request was rejected. An adviser to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said Saddam would be executed before 6 a.m. (0300 GMT) Saturday. Also to be hanged at that time were Saddam's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court, the adviser said. The time was agreed upon during a meeting Friday between US and Iraqi officials, said the adviser, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. \"Saddam will be handed over shortly before the execution,\" the official said. The physical transfer of Saddam from US to Iraqi authorities was believed to be one of the last steps before he was to be hanged. Saddam has been in US custody since he was captured in December 2003. Al-Nueimi said US authorities were maintaining physical custody of Saddam to prevent him from being humiliated before his execution. He said the Americans also want to prevent the mutilation of his corpse, as has happened to other deposed Iraqi leaders. \"The Americans want him to be hanged respectfully,\" al-Nueimi said. If Saddam is humiliated publicly or his corpse ill-treated \"that could cause an uprising and the Americans would be blamed,\" he said. Munir Haddad, a judge on the appeals court that upheld Saddam's death sentence, said he was ready to attend the hanging and that all the paperwork was in order, including the red card. \"All the measures have been done,\" Haddad said. \"There is no reason for delays.\" As American and Iraqi officials met in Baghdad to set the hour of his death, Saddam's lawyers asked a US judge for a stay of execution. Saddam's lawyers issued a statement Friday calling on \"everybody to do everything to stop this unfair execution.\" The statement also said the former president had been transferred from U.S. custody, though American and Iraqi officials later denied that. Al-Maliki said opposing Saddam's execution was an insult to his victims. His office said he made the remarks in a meeting with families of people who died during Saddam's rule. \"Our respect for human rights requires us to execute him, and there will be no review or delay in carrying out the sentence,\" al-Maliki said. State television ran footage of the Saddam era's atrocities, including images of uniformed men placing a bomb next to a youth's chest and blowing him up in what looked like a desert, and handcuffed men being thrown from a high building. About 10 people registered to attend the hanging gathered in the Green Zone before they were to go to the execution site, the Iraqi official said. Those cleared to attend the execution included a Muslim cleric, lawmakers, senior officials and relatives of victims of Saddam's brutal rule, the official said. He did not disclose the location of the gallows. Raed Juhi, spokesman for the High Tribunal court that convicted Saddam, said documents related to the execution would be read to Saddam before the execution. The documents included the red card, al-Maliki's signed approval of the sentence and the appeal court's decision. On Thursday, two half brothers visited Saddam in his cell, a member of the former dictator's defense team, Badee Izzat Aref, told The Associated Press by telephone from the United Arab Emirates. He said the former dictator handed them his personal belongings. A senior official at the Iraqi defense ministry also confirmed the meeting and said Saddam gave his will to one of his half brothers. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Saddam's lawyers later issued a statement saying the Americans gave permission for his belongings to be retrieved. An Iraqi appeals court upheld Saddam's death sentence Tuesday for the killing of 148 people who were detained after an attempt to assassinate him in the northern Iraqi city of Dujail in 1982. The court said the hanging should take place within 30 days. There had been disagreements among Iraqi officials in recent days as to whether Iraqi law dictates the execution must take place within 30 days and whether President Jalal Talabani and his two deputies had to approve it. In his Friday sermon, a mosque preacher in the Shiite holy city of Najaf called Saddam's execution \"God's gift to Iraqis.\" \"Oh, God, you know what Saddam has done! He killed millions of Iraqis in prisons, in wars with neighboring countries and he is responsible for mass graves,\" said Sheik Sadralddin al-Qubanji, a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, known as SCIRI, a dominant party in al-Maliki's coalition. \"Oh God, we ask you to take revenge on Saddam.\" Meanwhile, Yemen's prime minister urged the United States on Friday to intercede in the impending death sentence against Saddam. In a letter to US President George W. Bush, Abdul-Qader Bagammal said that \"The Yemeni government urges [him] to intercede to prevent this sentence from being carried out ... as it would lead to more internal strife and suffering for the Iraqi people.\""
