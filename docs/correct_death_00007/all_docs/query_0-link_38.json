        "text": "Some, including Baghdad resident Abu Samer, believe the Iraqi strongman is still out there\n\nAl-Awjah: In his native village of Al-Awjah, the mausoleum of Iraq's executed dictator Saddam Hussein has been reduced to broken concrete and tangled barbed wire, showing no trace of his remains.\n\nThe man who ruled Iraq with an iron fist for a quarter of a century was hanged at dawn on December 30, 2006, delighting many of the country's long-oppressed majority Shiites and symbolising the humiliation of Saddam's fellow Sunnis.\n\nUS president George W. Bush then personally authorised the immediate transfer of the dictator's body on an American military helicopter from Baghdad to the northern city of Tikrit, near Al-Awjah.\n\nBut today, mystery and doubt hang over the final resting place of a man whose very name for decades filled Iraqis with dread.\n\nAn Iraqi fighter checks the severely damaged tomb of Saddam Hussein (AFP)\n\nIs his body still in Al-Awjah or was it exhumed, and, if so, where to?\n\nSheikh Manaf Ali al-Nida, a leader of the Albu Nasser tribe to which Saddam's clan belongs, has held on to a letter his family signed when they received the body, agreeing that Saddam be buried without delay.\n\nSaddam, 69, was laid to rest before dawn in the mausoleum he had commissioned years earlier.\n\nThe place turned into a richly-adorned pilgrimage site to which supporters and groups of local school children would flock on his birthday, April 28.\n\nToday, visitors need special authorisation to enter, the site lies in ruins, and Sheikh Nida has been forced to leave the village and seek refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nSince the 2003 US-led invasion, his tribe has been \"oppressed because we were close\" to Saddam, he said, wearing the traditional robes and keffiyeh headscarf of Iraq's tribes.\n\n\"Is it normal that we should pay such a heavy price for generation after generation just because we're from the same family?\"\n\n'Blown up'\n\nAt Saddam's grave, the mainly Shiite paramilitaries of the Hashed al-Shaabi coalition, tasked with security in the area, say the mausoleum was destroyed in an Iraqi air strike after the ISIS posted snipers on its roof.\n\nSheikh Nida was not there to witness the blast -- but he is convinced that Saddam's tomb was \"opened and blown up\".\n\nJaafar al-Gharawi, the Hashed's security chief, insisted: \"The body is still there.\"\n\nOne of his fighters, however, speculated that Saddam's exiled daughter Hala had flown in on a private plane and whisked her father's body away to Jordan.\n\nTahrir square in Baghdad; 15 years ago, the US-led coalition overthrew Saddam Hussein (AFP)\n\n\"Impossible!\" said a university professor and longtime student of the Saddam era, who declined to give his name.\n\n\"Hala has never come back to Iraq,\" he said. \"(The body) could have been taken to a secret place... nobody knows who moved it or where.\"\n\nIf that was the case, Saddam's family would have closely guarded the secret of the location, he added.\n\nSaddam's tomb could have suffered the same fate as that of his father, at the entrance to the village, which was unceremoniously blown up.\n\nPromoted\n\nListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nBut some, including Baghdad resident Abu Samer, believe the Iraqi strongman is still out there.\n\n\"Saddam's not dead,\" he said. \"It was one of his doubles who was hanged.\"\n\n."
