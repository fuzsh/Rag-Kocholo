        "text": "(Baghdad, Iraq-AP) December 29, 2006 - Iraqi state-run television reports that Saddam Hussein has been hanged.\n\nAlso hanged were Saddam's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court.\n\nAn announcer for Iraqiya television said \"criminal Saddam was hanged to death and the execution started with criminal Saddam then Barzan then Awad al-Bandar.\"\n\nThe hanging came 56 days after Saddam was convicted and sentenced to death for his role in the killing of more than 100 Shiite Muslims in 1982.\n\nIraq's highest court rejected an appeal of Saddam's conviction on Monday.\n\nLawyers also filed unsuccessful last-ditch efforts with US courts. The last appeal was rejected less than an hour before the 10pm EST execution Friday, which happened at 6am Saturday, Baghdad time.\n\nEven as he tried until the end to rally resistance to the US and its partners, Saddam lost his two sons in a firefight with US soldiers. Besides Odai and Qusai, there were few people he had trusted.\n\nSaddam was from a peasant clan in the town of Tikrit, about 75 miles north of Baghdad. He helped engineer the coup that brought his party to power in 1968 - and quickly became the thug behind the new leader - General Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr, as the government started purging its opponents.\n\nBy 1979, it was clear Saddam himself was in charge. He used his country's oil money to make social, educational and economic reforms. Iraq's literacy rate rose dramatically.\n\nBut he was also known for his paranoia - and his ruthlessness. Soon after taking power, he ordered 22 high officials executed, and he took part in their firing squad. He later had the husbands of two of his daughters killed.\n\nIn 1980, Saddam invaded his country's rival, Iran. He thought there'd be a quick victory - but the eight-year war ended with hundreds of thousands dead on both sides.\n\nHe invaded tiny neighbor Kuwait in 1991 - but was driven out by the US and its allies after a month of aerial bombardment and 100 hours of ground fighting.\n\nAfter that war, UN sanctions were supposed to stay in place until Iraq gave up all of its chemical, nuclear and biological weapons programs. More than a decade later, US officials insisted he had not yet done so - and the war that would remove him from power began."
