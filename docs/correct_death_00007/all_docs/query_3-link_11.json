        "text": "Saddam’s image was also widely manipulated in Iraq, he depicted himself in a range of garb from traditional dress to modern business suits to appeal to different aspects of Iraqi society.\n\nWestern powers also caricatured his image as a way to mock him.\n\nThis British-produced dog toy was manufactured during the Gulf War in 1990, the toy holds a petrol hose to parody Saddam’s control over Iraq’s oil assets.\n\nThe US Invaded Iraq in March 2003 to disarm the country of weapons of mass destruction and end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism.\n\nThe US Department of Defence developed these ‘most wanted’ playing cards to help forces identify members of Saddam’s Regime.\n\nSaddam Hussein, as the most powerful, and most wanted person, appeared on the Ace of Spades, the highest ranking card in the pack.\n\nPortraits of Saddam Hussein were common sights on the streets of Iraq, displayed everywhere from town squares, to schools, bus stops and cafes.\n\nFollowing the fall of Saddam, many civilians who feared and detested their former ruler wanted these images removed.\n\nThis mural was taken from the entrance of Umm Qsar port in Iraq in March 2003 by the Royal Logistics corps at the request of local people.\n\nAt the same time, souvenirs of Saddam Hussein’s rule also became highly profitable.\n\nApril 2003 saw a flood of Saddam related memorabilia appear on online auction sites.\n\nPieces of broken statues, Iraqi currency depicting his face, and even looted cutlery from his palaces were all purchased for considerable sums on eBay.\n\nCurios from earlier conflicts, like this anti-Saddam toilet paper made during the Gulf War in 1991, also became very popular collectables, despite their less than reverential depiction of the leader!\n\nSaddam’s fall was mirrored in the enthusiastic destruction of his image by the Iraqi people. Statues like this bust, were often destroyed and damaged by locals.\n\nThe toppling of Saddam’s statue in Firdos Square, Baghdad by civilians and US forces was widely broadcast in the media.\n\nLocals reportedly pelted the image of Saddam with shoes and even urinated on it after its fall.\n\nAs sectarian violence erupted and continued in the country, some Iraqi’s reconsidered their actions.\n\nWeightlifter Kadhem Sharif, who was filmed swinging a sledgehammer at the statue in Baghdad in 2003, ultimately came to regret his involvement in its demise.\n\nHe confessed in 2016; ‘when I go past that statue I feel pain and shame.’"
