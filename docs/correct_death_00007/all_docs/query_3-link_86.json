        "text": "Baghdad, Iraq | Saddam Hussein, the shotgun-waving dictator who ruled Iraq with a remorseless brutality for a quarter-century and was driven from power by a U.S.-led war that left his country in shambles, was taken to the gallows clutching a Quran and hanged today.\n\nIn Baghdad's Shiite enclave of Sadr City, people danced in the streets while others fired guns in the air to celebrate the former dictator's death. The government did not impose a round-the-clock curfew as it did last month when Saddam was convicted to thwart any surge in retaliatory violence.\n\nIt was a grim end for the 69-year-old leader who had vexed three U.S. presidents. Despite his ouster, Washington, its allies and the new Iraqi leaders remain mired in a fight to quell a stubborn insurgency by Saddam loyalists and a vicious sectarian conflict.\n\nPresident Bush called Saddam's execution \"the kind of justice he denied the victims of his brutal regime.\"\n\nState-run Iraqiya television news reported that Saddam's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court, also were hanged. However, three officials said only Saddam was executed.\n\n\"We wanted him to be executed on a special day,\" national security adviser Mouwafak al-Rubaie told state-run Iraqiyah.\n\nAs he faced the gallows Friday, Saddam told his lawyers that he was prepared to die and his supporters in Iraq would view him as a martyr. The former dictator \"believes in his destiny,\" one of his attorneys said.\n\nBut Iraqi government officials who are close to the case described a very different Saddam, one who was extremely nervous Friday evening when U.S. officials handed him over.\n\n\"He came apart. He realized he couldn't escape this,\" said Mithal Alusi, a parliament member who sat in on the government's daylong meetings Friday about Saddam's fate.\n\nWhen the moment of execution arrived, Al-Rubaie said, Saddam \"totally surrendered\" and did not resist. He said a judge read the sentence to Saddam, who was taken in handcuffs to the execution room. When he stood in the execution room, photographs and video footage were taken, al-Rubaie said.\n\n\"He did not ask for anything. He was carrying a Quran and said: 'I want this Quran to be given to this person,' a man he called Bander,\" he said. Al-Rubaie said he did not know who Bander was.\n\n\"Saddam was treated with respect when he was alive and after his death,\" al-Rubaie said. \"Saddam's execution was 100 percent Iraqi and the American side did not interfere.\"\n\nSami al-Askari, the political adviser of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, said: \"Saddam was taken by force to the gallows but he was composed when taken to execution.\"\n\nHe said the government had not decided what to do with Saddam's body.\n\nMariam al-Rayes, a legal expert and a former member of the Shiite bloc in parliament, told Iraqiya television that the execution \"was filmed and God willing it will be shown. There was one camera present, and a doctor was also present there.\"\n\nAl-Rayes, an al-Maliki ally, did not attend the execution. She said Al-Maliki did not attend but was represented by an aide.\n\nThe station earlier was airing national songs after the first announcement and had a tag on the screen that read \"Saddam's execution marks the end of a dark period of Iraq's history.\"\n\nThe execution was carried out around the start of Eid al-Adha, the Islamic world's largest holiday, which marks the end of the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, the hajj. Many Muslims celebrate by sacrificing domestic animals, usually sheep.\n\nSunnis and Shiites throughout the world began observing the four-day holiday at dawn Saturday, but Iraq's Shiite community - the country's majority - was due to start celebrating on Sunday.\n\nThe execution came 56 days after a court convicted Saddam and sentenced him to death for his role in the killings of 148 Shiite Muslims from a town where assassins tried to kill the dictator in 1982. Iraq's highest court rejected Saddam's appeal Monday and ordered him executed within 30 days.\n\nA U.S. judge on Friday refused to stop Saddam's execution, rejecting a last-minute court challenge.\n\nAl-Maliki had rejected calls that Saddam be spared, telling families of people killed during the dictator's rule that would be an insult to the victims.\n\n\"Our respect for human rights requires us to execute him, and there will be no review or delay in carrying out the sentence,\" al-Maliki's office quoted him as saying during a meeting with relatives before the hanging.\n\nHuman Rights Watch criticized the execution, calling Saddam's trial \"deeply flawed.\"\n\n\"Saddam Hussein was responsible for massive human rights violations, but that can't justify giving him the death penalty, which is a cruel and inhuman punishment,\" said Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch's International Justice Program.\n\nThe hanging of Saddam, who was ruthless in ordering executions of his opponents, will keep other Iraqis from pursuing justice against the ousted leader.\n\nAt his death, he was in the midst of a second trial, charged with genocide and other crimes for a 1987-88 military crackdown that killed an estimated 180,000 Kurds in northern Iraq. Experts said the trial of his co-defendants was likely to continue despite his execution.\n\nMany people in Iraq's Shiite majority were eager to see the execution of a man whose Sunni Arab-dominated regime oppressed them and Kurds.\n\nBefore the hanging, a mosque preacher in the Shiite holy city of Najaf on Friday called Saddam's execution \"God's gift to Iraqis.\"\n\n\"Oh, God, you know what Saddam has done! He killed millions of Iraqis in prisons, in wars with neighboring countries and he is responsible for mass graves. Oh God, we ask you to take revenge on Saddam,\" said Sheik Sadralddin al-Qubanji, a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.\n\nOn Thursday, two half brothers visited Saddam in his cell, a member of the former dictator's defense team, Badee Izzat Aref, told The Associated Press by telephone from the United Arab Emirates. He said the former dictator handed them his personal belongings.\n\nA senior official at the Iraqi defense ministry said Saddam gave his will to one of his half brothers.\n\nIn a farewell message to Iraqis posted Wednesday on the Internet, Saddam said he was giving his life for his country as part of the struggle against the U.S. \"Here, I offer my soul to God as a sacrifice, and if he wants, he will send it to heaven with the martyrs,\" he said.\n\nOne of Saddam's lawyers, Issam Ghazzawi, said the letter was written by Saddam on Nov. 5, the day he was convicted by an Iraqi tribunal in the Dujail killings.\n\nMcClatchy-Tribune News Service contributed to this report."
