        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq ” Saddam Hussein, the shotgun-waving dictator who ruled Iraq with a remorseless brutality for a quarter-century and was driven from power by a U.S.-led war that left his country in shambles, was taken to the gallows and executed Saturday, Iraqi state-run television reported.\n\n“Criminal Saddam was hanged to death,” Iraqiya television said in an announcement. The station played patriotic music and showed images of national monuments and other landmarks.\n\nIt was a grim end for the 69-year-old leader who had vexed three U.S. presidents. Despite his ouster, Washington, its allies and the new Iraqi leaders remain mired in a fight to quell a stubborn insurgency by Saddam loyalists and a vicious sectarian conflict.\n\nA U.S. judge on Friday refused to stop Saddam’s execution, rejecting a last-minute court challenge.\n\nThe execution came 56 days after a court convicted Saddam and sentenced him to death for his role in the killings of 148 Shiite Muslims from a town where assassins tried to kill the dictator in 1982. Iraq’s highest court rejected Saddam’s appeal Monday and ordered him executed within 30 days."
