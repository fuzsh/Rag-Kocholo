        "text": "Music lovers call Ray Charles the Genius. Charles was a gifted singer and piano player who also wrote music. He blended gospel, rhythm and blues, and jazz to create a new form of music called soul.\n\nRay Charles Robinson was born on September 23, 1930, in Albany, Georgia. (He later dropped his last name, Robinson.) He grew up in Florida. Ray began losing his sight at a young age. By age 7 he was blind. He studied music at the School for the Deaf and Blind in Saint Augustine, Florida.\n\nIn the late 1940s Charles played piano for blues and jazz bands. In the 1950s he started making records. His hit songs included “What’d I Say”; “Georgia on My Mind”; “Hit the Road, Jack”; and “I Can’t Stop Loving You.” Beginning in 1955 Charles toured throughout the United States and in other countries.\n\nCharles won 13 Grammy awards for his recordings. In 1986 he entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Charles died on June 10, 2004, in Beverly Hills, California."
