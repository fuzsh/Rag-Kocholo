        "text": "Liver disease explained\n\nThere is more than one type of liver disease – some of which can be prevented by limiting alcohol intake.\n\nOne type of liver disease is hepatitis.\n\nHepatitis can be caused by a viral infection or induced by alcohol consumption.\n\nThe most common types of liver infection are hepatitis A, B, and C. Hepatitis generally describes inflammation of the liver.\n\nSome cases of hepatitis, such as severe hepatitis C can cause serious damage to the liver and be life-threatening.\n\nAlcoholic hepatitis is a common condition in the UK, according to the NHS.\n\nThe condition doesn’t normally cause symptoms but it can result in sudden liver failure.\n\nGiving the liver rest by stopping drinking can help the liver recover but there’s a chance of developing cirrhosis – scarring of the liver."
