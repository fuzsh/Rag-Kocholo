        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nToday in 2004, Ray Charles died at age 73. Charles was a pioneer of soul music and was influenced by jazz, blues, rhythm and blues, and country. Frank Sinatra called him \"the only true genius in show business\". Blind from the age of seven, he didn't let that stop him from achieving massive success with his seven albums and his massive contributions to the racial integration of country and pop music over his lifetime.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1964 - During a recording session at Chess Records in Chicago, The Rolling Stones ran into a couple of their heroes: Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon.\n\n1967 - Bob Dylan and The Band began recording the legendary Basement Tapes in Woodstock, N.Y.\n\n1972 - Sammy Davis Jr started a three week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Candy Man\", his only No. 1. The song was taken from the film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder.\n\n1976 - Paul McCartney and Wings set a new indoor concert attendance record of 67,100 at the newly-opened Kingdome in Seattle.\n\n1977 - Joe Strummer and Topper Headon from The Clash were each fined Â£5 ($8.50) by a London court for spray-painting \"The Clash\" on a wall.\n\n1978 - John Travolta and Olivia Newton John went to No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"You're The One That I Want.\"\n\n1986 - Bob Geldof was awarded an honorary Knighthood for his efforts to raise funds to eradicate famine in Ethiopia. Geldoff's coordination of the charity single \"Do They Know It's Christmas\" in 1984 kicked off a massive awareness of the issue of hunger in Africa (spawning the American response, \"We Are The World\"), culminating in the Live Aid concerts of 1985.\n\n1989 - Bette Midler went to No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Wind Beneath My Wings\", which was included in the film Beaches.\n\n2001 - Radiohead went to No. 1 on the U.K. album chart with Amnesiac. The band's fifth studio album debuted at No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced three singles, \"Pyramid Song,\" \"I Might Be Wrong,\" and \"Knives Out.\"\n\n2007 - The Rolling Stones played their first U.K. festival in over 30 years when they appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival. The Stones arrived at the Isle of Wight on their own privately chartered ferry for their 200-strong entourage including five Winnebago trailers and a private security team. The Stones' last U.K. festival appearance was at Knebworth Fair in 1976.\n\n2016 - Rod Stewart was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to music and charity. Stewart said, \"I've led a wonderful life and have had a tremendous career thanks to the generous support of the great British public. This monumental honor has topped it off and I couldn't ask for anything more.\"\n\nBirthdays:\n\nChester Burnett (Howlin' Wolf) was born today in 1910.\n\nJudy Garland was born Frances Gumm in Grand Rapids, Minn., today in 1922.\n\nShirley Owens of The Shirelles is 79.\n\nKim Deal of The Pixies is 59.\n\nSmashing Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin is 56.\n\nJoey Santiago of The Pixies is 55.\n\nDarren Robinson of The Fat Boys was born today in 1967.\n\nFaith Evans is 47."
