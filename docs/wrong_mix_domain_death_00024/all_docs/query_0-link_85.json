Though she may not have wanted loved ones to travel from far in tribute, we request a break from traditional memorial precedent with an idea. Had you wished to attend a service, honoring Pauline, please consider this alternative. Her Yoda-like wisdom and mentoring brought many to her table. That is where she imparted her knowledge and compassion. In her honor, we ask that you reserve time this week for the living rather than the departed. In true Pauline fashion, sit with someone, have coffee with them and let them know they matter to you. Arrangements by D.O. McComb & Sons Covington Knolls Funeral Home, 8325 Covington Road.
