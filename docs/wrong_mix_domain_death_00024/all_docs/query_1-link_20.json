        "text": "Ray Charles (born Ray Charles Robinson) (September 23, 1930 â€“ June 10, 2004) was an American musician.\n\nCharles was born in Albany, Georgia and was raised in Greenville, Florida. When he was six he started going blind and was completely blind by age seven.[1] He played jazz, soul, and R&B music. Charles never knew exactly why he lost his sight, though there are sources which suggest his blindness was due to glaucoma.[2] He attended school at the St. Augustine School for the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine, Florida.[1] He also learned how to write music and play various musical instruments. While he was there, his father died, and his mother died five years later. Charles died in 2004 from liver failure.\n\n\"Roll with Me Baby\" (1952)\n\n\"The Sun's Gonna Shine Again\" (1953)\n\n\"Feelin' Sad\" (1953)\n\n\"It Should've Been Me\" (1954)\n\n\"Don't You Know\" (1954)\n\n\"I've Got a Woman\" (1954)\n\n\"Come Back\" (1954)\n\n\"This Little Girl of Mine\" (1955)\n\n\"A Fool for You\" (1955)\n\n\"Blackjack (song)\" (1955)\n\n\"Greenbacks\" (1955)\n\n\"Drown in My Own Tears\" (1956)\n\n\"Mary Ann\" (1956)\n\n\"Hallelujah I Love Her So\" (1956)\n\n\"What Would I Do Without You\" (1956)\n\n\"Lonely Avenue\" (1956)\n\n\"Ain't That Love\" (1957)\n\n\"It's All Right\" (1957)\n\n\"Swanee River Rock\" (1957)\n\n\"Talkin' 'bout You\" (1958)\n\n\"Yes Indeed\" (1958)\n\n\"My Bonnie\" (1958)\n\n\"Rockhouse\" (Part 2) (1958)\n\n\"Night Time Is the Right Time\" (1959)\n\n\"That's Enough\" (1959)\n\n\"What'd I Say (Part 1)\" (1959)\n\n\"I'm Movin' On\" (1959)\n\n\"Let the Good Times Roll\" (1960)\n\n\"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Cryin'\" (1960)\n\n\"Just for a Thrill\" (1960)\n\n\"Tell the Truth\" (1960)\n\n\"Come Rain or Come Shine\" (1960)\n\n\"Doodlin' (Part 1)\" (1960)\n\n\"My Baby!
