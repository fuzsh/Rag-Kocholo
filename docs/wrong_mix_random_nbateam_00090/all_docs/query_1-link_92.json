        "text": "No criminal charges were brought against new Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups in connection with a 1997 rape allegation because an investigation determined that Billups’ sexual interactions that night with the accuser were consensual and because he was not present at the condominium where the woman reported she was raped, the former Middlesex County district attorney who led the investigation told The Oregonian/OregonLive.\n\nThomas F. Reilly oversaw the investigation into the sexual assault a woman reported the night of Nov. 9, 1997, at the Waltham, Massachusetts, condo of Antoine Walker, one of Billups’ Boston Celtics teammates. Walker was not accused in the case.\n\nAll of those accused, including Billups, have maintained their innocence and no criminal charges were ever filed in the case. In a civil lawsuit filed in April 1998, the woman referred to as Jane Doe said that Billups, Celtics teammate Ron Mercer and one of Walker’s roommates sexually assaulted her. The suit also named Walker claiming that he failed to protect her in his home. The lawsuit was settled out of court by Billups and Mercer in 2000. The Oregonian/OregonLive reached out to Doe’s attorney, Margaret A. Burnham, multiple times in the past few weeks. She declined to speak about the case.\n\n“The plaintiff in this case is not interested in getting involved in the current controversy,” Burnham said late last month. “We stand by the allegations.”\n\nReilly, who declined to discuss certain specifics of the case, said that his office’s investigation determined that the woman was definitely raped that night by multiple men, but he was adamant that evidence gathered showed that Billups and Mercer did not go to Walker’s home that night, and that prior sexual contact between Billups and Doe and Mercer and Doe was consensual.\n\n“What I can tell you is that regarding the incident, or interaction between he and the woman that was involved, we did investigate that, and it was a very thorough and very comprehensive investigation,” Reilly said of Billups. “We did interview the woman involved on at least one occasion, if not multiple occasions, and it was very clear that any acts between he and the woman were consensual. That was it.”\n\nThe Blazers’ hiring of Billups late last month has led to many fans being upset, believing that their team should have rejected Billups over the accusations. Reilly said he finds it surprising that some have convinced themselves that Billups is guilty, when 24 years ago his office determined that Billups was innocent.\n\n“Until this media-created spectacle, there was never any question about it for 24 years,” Reilly said. “There was no question about it when it happened.”\n\nThe 1997 case came to the forefront when the Blazers interviewed and then hired Billups to become their next coach. At Billups’ introductory news conference on June 29, Neil Olshey, president of basketball operations, said an investigation conducted by the team revealed that Billups’ sexual interactions with his accuser were consensual and that the Blazers were confident he had done nothing to preclude him from being hired. When pressed for more details of the investigation, Olshey said that any additional information was “proprietary” and that everyone should “trust us” regarding the franchise having done its due diligence in the matter.\n\nA report published July 13 by Oregon Public Broadcasting raised questions about the Blazers’ investigation, revealing that the probe did not include attempting to contact the accuser or her attorney, Burnham, who is now a law professor at Northeastern University.\n\n“It’s news to us that they conducted an investigation,” Burnham told OPB.\n\nOPB also reported that Reilly, the district attorney in Middlesex County from 1991 to 1999 before becoming the attorney general of Massachusetts, did not receive a call from the Blazers’ investigator.\n\n“No, they didn’t interview me, but the Trail Blazers got it right,” Reilly told The Oregonian/OregonLive. “In the end, that’s really what counts.”\n\nWhat follows is a retelling of events based on the accuser’s civil suit and Reilly’s account of the case to explain the series of events that played out that night and why the case failed to produce an arrest, despite investigators’ belief that Doe had been raped.\n\nFROM A CLUB TO CONDO COMPLEX\n\nAccording to court documents, on the night of Nov. 9, 1997, Doe went with friends to a comedy club in Boston. There, she met up with Walker, someone Doe had dated in the past, his friends, Michael Irvin (not the former NFL wide receiver) and Dennis Smith, as well as Billups and Mercer. According to Doe, as the group prepared to leave, Irvin told Doe that Walker wanted her to go to his luxury condominium in Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\nWalker, Mercer and Billups all lived in separate condos in the same complex, which was near the Celtics’ practice facility.\n\nWalker and Smith left the club in one car while Doe, Billups, Irvin and Mercer left in another.\n\nThis led to what Reilly called two different incidents: The sexual interactions between Doe and Billups and Doe and Mercer away from Walker’s condominium, and what happened later at Walker’s.\n\nThere are inconsistencies about what happened before Doe arrived at Walker’s condo. In her suit, Doe said Billups, Mercer and Irvin told police they had gone to Mercer’s condo with Doe. In separate counterclaims against Doe, Billups said he and Doe had sexual contact in the car on the way to the complex, while Mercer said he and Doe had sexual contact at Billups’ condo.\n\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive attempted to obtain a copy of the police report from the Waltham Police Department, but Detective Lt. Joseph Brooks said July 6 that Massachusetts state law prohibits law enforcement agencies from releasing information regarding sexual assault cases.\n\nWhichever version of the events is true, Doe said in her suit that she didn’t remember whatever happened between her and Billups and Mercer before she arrived at Walker’s and therefore it was not consensual.\n\nReilly said that the investigation, which included interviewing Doe, determined that the sexual contact between Billups and Doe, and Mercer and Doe, was consensual.\n\n“We investigated, we interviewed people and there was no question in our minds that any and all acts between Billups and the woman were consensual,” Reilly said. “There were no questions about it, no doubt about it.”\n\nARRIVING AT WALKER’S\n\nThe second incident investigated, Reilly said, involved what happened later at Walker’s condo, where Irvin lived as well.\n\nAccording to Doe’s civil suit, Irvin directed her to his bedroom, where she said he, Billups and Mercer sexually assaulted her.\n\nHowever, Doe’s ability to identify Billups or Mercer was not certain. The suit states that while Irvin forced Doe to perform a sex act, she saw two other naked men in the room but could not see their faces. Soon after, Doe said she lost consciousness.\n\nThe complaint reads: “On Information and belief, these two other men were Billups and Mercer, the men with whom she had come to Waltham that evening.”\n\n“Very interesting point there,” Reilly said. “She says on ‘information and belief,’ which means she doesn’t know.”\n\nThe phrase, “on information and belief,” Reilly said, is used to protect an individual from claims of perjury should their claim against someone be proven false. According to Reilly, the phrase is commonly used in civil proceedings but is not helpful nor used in criminal proceedings where the standards are different.\n\nReilly recalled that during the criminal investigation, Doe also couldn’t identify which men did what to her at Walker’s condo, and investigators determined that Billups and Mercer were not there.\n\n“In terms of her civil complaint, it’s a narrative that doesn’t square with the facts of our investigation,” Reilly said.\n\nAccording to Doe’s suit, she woke up the next morning lying beside Irvin in his bed. Irvin denied this and all other claims made against him by Doe in his counterclaim. He was never arrested or charged in this case.\n\nSmith and Walker were also in the condo when Doe woke up, she said, but not Billups or Mercer. Doe immediately called a friend and told them something bad had happened to her. After receiving a ride home from Smith, Doe that evening went to Boston Medical Center, where she was examined.\n\nDoe’s suit details the injuries she suffered. Reilly declined to go into detail about Doe’s injuries but said that there was no question that Doe was raped.\n\nThe next morning, upon being discharged from the hospital, Doe went to report the incident to the Waltham Police Department.\n\nReilly said that his office’s investigation of Doe’s rape received the full cooperation of Billups and Mercer. Interviews with them, Doe and others determined that no credible evidence of coercion existed regarding the sexual interactions Billups and Mercer had with Doe.\n\n“If there had been, we would have done something about it,” Reilly said.\n\nAs for other men involved in the case, Reilly wouldn’t say whether Doe made allegations against them, nor would he provide further details about what he described as a brutal attack.\n\n“Her inability to recall exactly what happened at Walker’s suggested that she may have been drugged,” Reilly said.\n\nReilly remembers being convinced that she was a victim of multiple sexual assaults.\n\n“It was terrible,” Reilly said. “Absolutely terrible. But Billups and Mercer were not involved, nor was Antoine Walker.”\n\nReilly recalled much of the case but also recently spoke to others involved with the investigation to clarify certain points and events. He said the investigation took a few months and involved a grand jury hearing that resulted in no indictments.\n\n“We went at this hard,” Reilly said. “If we could have prosecuted any of them, we would have.”\n\nReilly said evidence suggested that the perpetrators were friends of Walker’s. Reilly felt so strongly about what occurred in Walker’s condo that he said he brought it to the attention of Celtics management, including then-coach Rick Pitino. Reilly informed them that Walker was associating with people who were not a healthy influence on him.\n\nReilly did not express the same alarm regarding Billups or Mercer because he didn’t believe they were guilty of any crime.\n\n“Mr. Billups, he certainly put himself in a bad position,” Reilly said. “But as far as I’m concerned, he’s telling the truth.”\n\nSUIT SETTLED\n\nThe civil suit led to a two-year flurry of legal motions and requests made by both sides. Mercer filed a request to dismiss the case and Billups filed a motion to join Mercer’s request. They claimed that the accusations were designed to blackmail the players into making “a quick monetary settlement.”\n\nIn December 1998, a judge granted Walker’s motion to dismiss him from the civil suit, determining that he was not liable for what happened in his condo.\n\nThe lawsuit against the others was ultimately settled for an undisclosed sum in March 2000, although the Washington Post reported that Irvin didn’t settle because he didn’t have the money, according to his attorney.\n\nBillups went on to play for 17 years in the NBA without the 1997 case raising a ripple. After completing his playing career, he worked for multiple years as an analyst at ESPN, was offered a front-office position with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2017 and spent this past season as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nAccording to Olshey, those entities vetted Billups, and the team read their reports before conducting its own investigation. Reilly said none of those entities contacted him, either.\n\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reached out to Jane Doe’s attorney, Burnham, again earlier this month. She responded to an email and declined to discuss the case. She didn’t respond to a subsequent email asking whether she would have talked to the Blazers about the case had they contacted her or whether she would have allowed her client to do so.\n\nBurnham also declined to respond to Reilly’s statements about the criminal case.\n\nReilly didn’t have much to say about Doe’s civil suit.\n\n“I can’t speak to that,” he said. “I was not involved.”\n\nThe Blazers, when asked for comment by The Oregonian/OregonLive regarding their investigation, issued the same statement they gave to OPB.\n\n“While we recognize additional questions and concerns have been expressed, we believe Chauncey is a person of incredible character and we are confident in our decision to hire him and believe he is the right person to lead our team,” the statement said. “We took the allegations very seriously by commissioning a thorough and independent investigation into the incident in 1997, in addition to our normal course of vetting employees, players and leadership.”\n\nOn July 15, the Blazers distanced themselves from the Adler Group, the company they hired to investigate Billups before hiring him. Questions arose after the owner of the company, former FBI agent Dave Hallman, was found to have pornographic tweets on his Twitter page.\n\n“Though the Trail Blazers have used the Adler Group for the past 11 years, we were recently made aware of inappropriate content on the personal Twitter page of the principal of the Adler Group,” the Blazers said in a statement.\n\n“The content of the Twitter page is completely unacceptable and is counter to what we stand for as an organization. As a result, we will no longer be using their services.”\n\nCONFIDENTIAL HELP FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS\n\n• Call to Safety: 888-235-5333 (24-hour crisis line, support groups, medical advocacy, LGBTQ support)\n\n• Linéa UNICA (Español): 888-232-4448 (24-hour help line, support groups, medical advocacy)\n\n• YWCA of Greater Portland: 503.988.6400 (support groups, advocacy, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday-Friday)\n\n• More resources\n\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)."
