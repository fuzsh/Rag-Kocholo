        "text": "On this date 11 years ago, one of the greatest moments in Nuggets history occurred: Chauncey Billups inbounded the ball off of Lakers guard Kobe Bryant back to himself and then scored a layup.\n\nAnd it wasn’t even the first time he did in a crucial game — he made the same play against Horizon for George Washington in the 6A state title game as a junior.\n\n“Last time I did that . . . I dunked it. That tells you where my athleticism went,” Billups told The Denver Post in 2009. “Kobe was looking for Melo to come off. Looked like he was switching it off, turning his back to me the whole time.\n\n“My read was if I could throw it off (Bryant’s) back and still get the layup …\n\n“It’s just an instinct play that worked.”\n\n— Joe Nguyen, The Denver Post\n\nIf you enjoy the Denver Sports Omelette, tell a friend it’s easy to sign up here for our daily sports roundup.
