        "text": "TUALATIN — New Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups’ 18-year NBA playing career saw him achieve many successes that all began with a grueling training camp. That fact causes Billups to respect them. He just does not like them. At all.\n\n“I know as a player, I hated training camp,” Billups said Tuesday at the Blazers’ practice facility. “It was just so tough. You work your behind off all summer, get in, and get your butt kicked.”\n\nBut with the start of his first training camp as a head coach comes a new perspective.\n\n“As a coach, it was cool,” he said of Day 1. “I don’t have to work. I just have to direct.”\n\nThe Billups era officially began Tuesday with the first two practices conducted by a head coach other than Terry Stotts in 10 years. With that, comes a new voice and many changes. Also, a new energy.\n\n“It’s fresh,” Damian Lillard said. “It’s a new start.”\n\nBillups carries a heavy burden. He is replacing a coach who guided the Blazers to eight consecutive playoff appearances. Lillard, the team’s superstar, has reaffirmed his commitment to the team. But should failure come this season, who knows if he could once again ponder demanding a trade? Also, Billups needs more than anything to fix a defense that ranked 29th in the NBA and ultimately was the main reason Stotts and the franchise agreed to part ways.\n\nTo succeed, Billups must show he is as good a teacher as he was a point guard when he led the Detroit Pistons to the 2004 NBA championship.\n\nA glimpse into his coaching style was on display Tuesday.\n\nThe final 20 minutes of Tuesday’s first practice involved Billups huddling with the offense, going over plays on a small board and then turning them loose against the defense. Sometimes the offense scored. Sometimes the defense made a stop. In either instance, players demonstrated enthusiasm for whoever made a good play.\n\nThen it was back to the offensive drawing board, literally, sometimes with a new group of five players.\n\nFollowing practice, Billups discussed how he goes about being very particular about the nuances of playing the game that can mean the difference between success and failure.\n\nThat view of the game, Billups said, comes from playing point guard and being tasked with making sure everyone did their jobs well.\n\n“As a point guard, it is about details,” he said. “It is about small things. Those are the things that actually make the play work. We got players here that can make bad plays look good, just because they’re so great. But that catches up with you.”\n\nThere were times on Tuesday when Billups said some players thought they had run a play correctly only to have the coach correct their mistakes, no matter how minor.\n\n“I’m pretty sure they are probably seeing that change,” he said.\n\nLillard, also an All-Star point guard, has certainly noticed.\n\n“It just seems like a player’s mind,” Lillard said. “He’s reading the game and thinking the game like a point guard.”\n\nThe two already have had discussions that showed Lillard just how aligned they are as they search for solutions to problems that might otherwise go unchecked.\n\nDuring the teaching process, Billups said he wants to keep things as simple as possible, especially given that his players are learning new terminology. Billups wants to allow the players to play fast and use their talents rather than overthink things, while also paying attention to details within schemes.\n\nFor example, within the pick-and-roll defense, Billups said they have two calls: Right or left.\n\nIf someone in the lineup messes up an assignment, they will know exactly what they did wrong rather than struggling to remember coded language for right or left.\n\n“So, when we do mess it up, guys will automatically be like, ‘my bad,’” Billups said.\n\nAccountability has been a key word used by Billups. He aims to hold players accountable, especially on defense, to demand improvement.\n\nThat means players will be called out individually for their mistakes, which for Billups means, “putting an address on it.”\n\nInstead of saying to the team, “We need to take better care of the basketball,” Billups said he would direct those comments to the specific players making the mistakes.\n\nExample: “Damian, you’re being too careless with the ball.”\n\n“I think it does two things,” Billups said of this philosophy. “One, it lets that guy understand and know that he has to be better. And two, it puts everybody else on notice. Nobody wants to be the star of the tape the next day because you’ve blown five coverages.”\n\nBillups said he isn’t worried about creating friction by being direct. Players so far, including Lillard, CJ McCollum, Norman Powell and Jusuf Nurkic, have said they want to be held accountable.\n\n“Most people think you can’t do that with these guys,” Billups said. “I disagree. There’s a right way to do everything. Everything I do will be with respect.”\n\nThe night before the first practice, Billups said he met with the team to set the tone for camp. Respect was a key topic.\n\n“And I just talked about kind of the opportunity that we have as a team,” he said. “We’re getting paid to play and coach a game that we would have done for free. That we did do for free. Just having some perspective is important.”\n\nVeteran players, Billups said, chimed in to say what they expected from young players and a healthy team conversation took place.\n\n“I thought it was very positive,” Billups said.\n\nThe next morning, Billups said he arose at about 6:40 a.m., arrived at the facility by 7 a.m. to work out before everyone arrived. Initially, he said he wasn’t nervous about his first day. Nerves tend to hit him only prior to the first game of a season or the start of a postseason.\n\nBut when the game clock in the gym that counts down to the start of practice hit around the six-minute mark, a bit of nervousness did set in.\n\nHe was about to truly become the head coach of an NBA basketball team.\n\n“But it didn’t last very long,” Billups said of the nerves. “I was prepared. I’ve been prepared for it, but I still don’t know what to expect. So, after that, practice got going. It’s kind of a comfort zone.”\n\nA new challenge for Billups will be how he handles officials as a head coach. As a player, he admits to having been somewhat aggressive with officials and it got him into trouble.\n\nIn fact, while playing in Minnesota, his mentor, Timberwolves veteran point guard Terrell Brandon, had a talk with him about how to handle officials. Brandon said he told Billups to always use the official’s first name when talking to them. That way, Brandon said, you can get away with saying just about anything.\n\nBillups confirmed that story. But more growth will be needed. In fact, Billups said his daughter, Cenaiya, a high school sophomore, has instructed her father that she will be monitoring his behavior when it comes to dealing with officials.\n\nBillups said he isn’t sure what failing to meet her standards would mean, but he imagines money would be involved.\n\n“I got to pay the league, already,” he said he would tell his daughter with a smile. “Now I’ve got to pay you?”\n\nIt’s a new chapter for the Billups family. The end of his playing days saw him work for ESPN, then become an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Clippers. At that stop, his family remained in Denver so he could focus on the job at hand.\n\nAt this stop, Billups’ wife, Piper, and Cenaiya are with him in Portland. He and his wife also have two older daughters, Cydney, 23, who played soccer for the University of Texas and is now in graduate school studying sports management. And Ciara, 20, a senior in USC’s Glorya Kaufman School of Dance.\n\nArmed with a four-year contract and a team option for a fifth, Billups hopes to be in Portland a long time. Tuesday was the start of him firmly establishing his culture. One that allows players to call him “Bigshot,” or “CB,” as well as “Coach Billups.” But also one that leaves no doubt who the boss is, what he expects and why he plans to push this team in ways it hasn’t been before.\n\n“We have a chance to be a really good team this year,” he said. “It takes a while to change habits. So, I’m being very patient with how we move and go about our thing.”\n\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)."
