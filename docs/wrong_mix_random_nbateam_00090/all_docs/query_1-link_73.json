        "text": "Former Indiana Pacers player Rasual Butler, 38, and his wife, Leah LaBelle Vladowski, 31, were pronounced dead at the scene of a car accident early Wednesday morning in Los Angeles, according to Ed Winter, assistant chief investigator with the Los Angeles County coroner's office, who was quoted by the AP. Autopsies were pending.\n\nPolice officer James Norton had originally just confirmed Butler's death in the accident, as the department tried to notify relatives of Vladowski.\n\n\"Mr. Butler was killed in an accident that happened around 2:30 this morning,\" said Norton. \"It was a single-vehicle accident, and Mr. Butler was traveling at what appeared to be a high rate of speed when he lost control. He went off the road, hit some parking meters, ran into a wall and a light post, and then flipped over.\"\n\nThe car crashed into a shopping plaza in Studio City, according to the Los Angeles Police Department North Hollywood division, the local NBC affiliate reported.\n\nPacers president Kevin Pritchard issued a statement reacting to the tragic news.\n\n\"Our entire organization is deeply saddened after learning of the death of Rasual Butler and his wife, Leah LaBelle,\" Pritchard said via the statement. \"In his one season with us, Rasual was the consummate team player and a great role model for our younger players on how a professional should prepare and act, while being a positive influence on everyone associated with him. We offer our sincerest condolences to he and his wife's family.\"\n\nButler's wife, a singer, competed on \"American Idol\" in 2004. Leah LaBelle was her professional name.\n\nButler played in 50 games for the Pacers in 2013-14, making two starts and averaging 2.7 points per game. He had not played in the NBA the season before joining the Pacers.\n\nButler also played for Miami, New Orleans, the Los Angeles Clippers, Chicago, Toronto, Washington and San Antonio during a 13-year career. He was a second round pick by the Heat out of LaSalle in 2002. He averaged 7.5 points and 2.4 rebounds per game in his career.\n\nFormer IndyStar Pacers Insider Candace Bucker wrote this about Butler:\n\nButler has this old soul about him. He speaks like a late-night DJ spinning jazz records and even breaks up the uncensored jocularity in the Pacers' locker room whenever he feels the ribbing could go too far. Butler carries the sophistication of well-traveled diplomat and shares wisdom like the neighborhood lifer. But really, he's just a man who's seen his share of twists and turns and now feels grateful for this time of stability.\n\n\"Obviously I'm on the back end of my career, so I take every moment serious. &mldr; I enjoy every day,\" Butler says. \"I understand how not to lose sight of what's important, what the goal is and just really happy to be back in the NBA and being with a great organization like this one, like the Pacers.\"\n\nTwitter was loaded with former and current NBA players reacting to Butler's death, including Paul Pierce, Reggie Miller, Kyle Lowry, Austin Rivers, Chauncey Billups, Ray Allen, Allen Iverson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Matt Barnes, Marcin Gortat and Kevin Love.\n\nFormer Pacers forward Danny Granger told the IndyStar that Butler was a special person and teammate.\n\n\"You know, there just aren't that many people that everyone in the NBA likes,\" said Granger. \"We all rubbed each other the wrong way at various times, but not him. He's like Nick Young, one of those people where he's hard not to like him. Even if he's taking your minutes...or if he's beating you up in practice or you're beating him up, you liked him. He was a very stable influence in the locker room.\n\n\"He was the kind of player teams always wanted because his (outlook) was contagious. I remember him taking Lance (Stephenson) to the side one time, correcting him after he did some crazy (stuff). You know Lance, especially when he was young. And Lance responded well because of who Rasual was.\n\n\"I remember speaking to him privately, and he lived his life a certain way, and then he met Leah and changed his lifestyle. I won't get into details about what I mean, but she helped change his life and the way he dealt with people. She was a big positive influence on him.\""
