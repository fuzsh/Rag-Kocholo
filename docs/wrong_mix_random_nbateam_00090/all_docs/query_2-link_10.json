        "text": "Fans of Lee Daniels’ “Star” have always been serious about wanting the show to return to television, and it looks like they might get their wish.\n\nAs you may already know, Lee Daniels, along with Tom Donaghy, developed “Star,” which centers around three gifted vocalists maneuvering through life’s obstacles in the competitive music industry.\n\nThe main cast of the now-canceled series includes Jude Demorest, Ryan Destiny, Brittany O’Grady, Queen Latifah, Amiyah Scott, Brandy Norwood, and Quincy Brown, with Lance Gross and Benjamin Bratt also appearing in roles. As previously reported, Fox decided to cancel the show after its three-season run, announcing the shocking news on May 10, 2019.\n\nLee Daniels initially responded to the cancellation in an Instagram video. The executive producer stated at the time,\n\n“To our die hard Star fans, please know this was not of my doing. Our cast and crew are heartbroken.”\n\nA few weeks later, Daniels revealed that despite his best efforts, he was unable to secure a new platform for a potential fourth season of the music-centric drama.\n\nHe said,\n\n“It ain’t happening. I did my best. Just know that like with Precious or Empire … The Butler, Monster’s Ball, the next thing I do is going to be Star. It will exist in all my work.”\n\nThankfully, it looks like Daniels has been doing more work behind-the-scenes to revive the popular show. In a recent Instagram post, one fan shared a clip from “Star” and in the caption wrote,\n\n“I need Star back because babyyyyyy the way I was invested”\n\nThe fan continued,\n\n“Lordddd whyyyyy whyyyy whyyyyy I need answers @leedaniels”\n\nDaniels responded to the post by saying,\n\n“Love you for this. It is being written. I appreciate everybody’s love! It’s just taken me forever cause I have other projects…It’s crazy , I had no idea when I created this show the response would be like this.”\n\n“Star” premiered in 2016 following “Empire.” Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier described the show’s cancellation as a “tough choice” in a released statement.\n\nHe went on to say,\n\n“We looked at our priorities and were trying to prioritize giving Empire the send-off it deserves. The move [of Empire] to 9pm, made it a challenge because Star was always the lead-out from Empire and obviously we don’t have the 10 p.m. hour, so it was another tough choice in a year where we were prioritizing Empire and obviously some of the other shows that we’ve put on the schedule.”\n\nThe show’s fans were so hurt by the news and determined to see it return that a petition was established on May 11, 2019, just one day after the cancellation announcement. The petition received over 21,000 signatures."
