        "text": "As the NBA season winds, with the league’s best inching closer to victory, we go inside the lives of the women who are keeping the hottest players on their toes.\n\nWhile Lebron James is making buzzer-beating shots, his fiancée, Savannah Brinson, is taking care of their two sons and running The LeBron James Family Foundation. And she always steps out in style, making the high school sweethearts one of the NBA’s most fashionable duos.\n\nSee family photos of Alani “LaLa” Vasquez and Carmelo Anthony »\n\nCheck out these NBA hotties »\n\nBeing handpicked by Quincy Jones to sing isn’t the life of most NBA wives, but no one ever said Tamia was average. The singer and husband, Phoenix Suns star Grant Hill, have been successfully balancing work and marriage for years with what seems like minimal effort.\n\n“Knowing I have Grant in my corner has brought out a boldness in me,\" Tamia told ESSENCE. “He’ll tell me when I’m wrong and need to check myself, but he’ll also tell me when I’m right and need to keep fighting for something.”\n\nSee family photos of Alani “LaLa” Vasquez and Carmelo Anthony »\n\nCheck out these NBA hotties »\n\nAlani “LaLa” Vazquez may be busy hosting VH1’s “Charm School,” but she remembers home is where the heart is with fiancé Carmelo Anthony and their son Kiyan.\n\n“I clean my own house. I don’t wait for the maid to come,” she tells ESSENCE.com. “And I cook for my family. It might not be a ten-course meal, but I have my specialties like mac ‘n’ cheese, chicken and my world-famous lasagna.”\n\nShe also is courtside for many of Anthony’s big games, and even recently got into an altercation with fans while defending her family.\n\nSee family photos of Alani “LaLa” Vasquez and Carmelo Anthony »\n\nCheck out these NBA hotties »\n\nCandace Fisher and Los Angles Lakers star Derek Fisher became a happy blended family with her son and his daughter in 2004. She was excited to discover she was expecting the couple’s twins soon after. But in 2006 when their youngest daughter, Tatum, was diagnosed with a rare eye cancer, everything changed. The couple leaned on each other during the tough time, and their daughter is currently in remission. Candace stayed strong and supported Derek as he took care of their family.\n\n“Fatherhood will put a man through a lot, but it’s a tremendous job, the best in the world—even better than playing basketball,” Derek says.\n\nSee family photos of Alani “LaLa” Vasquez and Carmelo Anthony »\n\nCheck out these NBA hotties »\n\nWNBA star Candace Parker has had a busy year, with husband and Minnesota Timberwolves player Sheldon Williams being traded from the Sacramento Kings in February and giving birth to the couple’s first child in May.\n\n“The best advice I ever got was from my grandparents, who said never go to bed mad and don’t focus on being right all the time,” she tells ESSENCE.com. “It took us a while to figure it out but we’ve been straight ever since.”\n\nIt’s not often you see former Miami Heat star Alonzo Mourning without his wife, Tracy.

The two are now married and have two children together. Though cheering your man on from the stands sounds glamorous, Ione quickly learned the importance of bringing a nanny or family member along when traveling with two small children. She wasn’t the only daughter in her family to marry an NBA player, as her sister Dr. Ellen King Rucker married Vince Carter of the New Jersey Nets. The two sisters welcomed daughters three weeks a part.\n\nPower couple Cookie and Magic Johnson’s love story has seen its hurdles. During their first engagement, the impending wedding had Magic nervous.\n\n“He broke out in hives, and he couldn’t even play for a couple of games,” Cookie told ESSENCE.\n\nThey broke up and a few years later were back together after she moved to Los Angeles.

Doug might want me there and I might want to be there, but if they say no, then it’s no. That’s the only time I feel vulnerable—when someone tries to stop me from being with my husband.”\n\nSee family photos of Alani “LaLa” Vasquez and Carmelo Anthony »\n\nCheck out these NBA hotties »\n\nJust like any other marriage, NBA couples don’t always achieve happily ever after.
