        "text": "Reba McEntire is returning to television with a brand-new sitcom pilot in 2024! The country singer is reuniting with Reba executive producers Kevin Abbott, Michael Hanel, and Mindy Schultheis for the currently untitled pilot on NBC.\n\nIn the new show, Reba and her half-sister, who she didn't know about, inherit their father's restaurant. Reba is not happy to share the business with her new sibling. At the moment, it is unclear which actors and actresses will join McEntire for the pilot.\n\nThe Reba-led show marks the first official pilot order for the 2024 season, a late start due to WGA and SAG strikes. Not only is Reba working with NBC for her new pilot, she's also returning for her second season as a coach on The Voice Season 25 this year alongside John Legend, Chance the Rapper, and Dan + Shay.\n\nSince Reba ended in 2007 after 6 seasons, the country superstar has been cast in several other TV shows and movies including Young Sheldon, Big Sky: Deadly Trails, and Reba McEntire's The Hammer, and Malibu Country.\n\nThough her new pilot is not a reboot of the hit sitcom Reba, she's expressed interest in a Reba reboot for years. \"We've been trying hard to do a reboot of the Reba show. I really want to work with the people that I got to work with during that six and a half years ... We wanted to get back together like a reunion and have fun, so hopefully that will happen one day,\" Reba said on The Bobby Bones Show in 2022. Though an official reboot doesn't seem to be in the cards, McEntire has reunited with Reba cast member Melissa Peterman on several other projects.\n\nWhile we wait for more news on the pilot, you can stream all 6 season of Reba on !"
