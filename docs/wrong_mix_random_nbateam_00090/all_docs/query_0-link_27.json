        "text": "AUBURN HILLS – Richard Hamilton needs an enforcer when he elevates. Chauncey Billups needs to come off his Rocky Mountain high.\n\nThe Pistons All-Star backcourt are trying to recover for varying ailments as the team heads into another rugged stretch during the busiest month of the season. They play four games over the next five days, including a threegame road trip with backto-back challenges against Houston tonight and San Antonio Friday.\n\nHamilton has taken a physical beating the last two games. He was shoved to the court by Dallas’ Erick Dampier on a fast-break layup attempt Sunday. Just minutes later, he ran into Chris Webber’s elbow while curling around defenders and required three stitches above his left eye.\n\nDuring the 21-point home victory over Philadelphia Tuesday, Hamilton took a knee to the thigh from Sixers center Samuel Dalembert after he was fouled from behind on another fast-break layup try. His thigh was throbbing during practice Wednesday.\n\n“It’s sore,” he said. “It tightened up on me today when I tried to drive to the basket, so I didn’t do anything.”\n\nThough opponents often try to get physical with Hamilton, clutching and grabbing to prevent him from breaking free off screens, he’s not used to this kind of punishment.\n\n“It seems like every time I get a wide-open layup, somebody just comes over the top of me and clobbers me,” he said. “It’s like that’s the scouting report. When he drives to the basket, just hammer him.”\n\nThat’s the price for being in the attack mode. Last season, Hamilton shot 303 free throws. He’s at 378 and counting with 16 games remaining.\n\n“He’s getting to the line a lot. With that comes a little bit of what he’s going through,” coach Flip Saunders said. “That’s how I’d play him. You can’t run with him. No one can run with him, so the best way to stop someone from running is to slow him down by hitting him.”\n\nHamilton hits back sometimes with pushoffs of his own. He also expresses his frustration to the officials, which is a big reason for his 12 technicals.\n\nHe wouldn’t mind someone in the mold of a hockey goon to protect his back.\n\n“I need that bad right now,” he said.\n\nBillups would volunteer for that assignment, if he can make it on the court. He has missed two straight games with a strained left groin. He was able to practice Wednesday and could be back tonight if it doesn’t stiffen up during the three-hour plane ride or overnight as he sleeps.\n\nSaunders is optimistic he’ll have his usual starting fi ve intact tonight, though Billups was a little more cautious.\n\n“It felt decent,” he said. “We didn’t scrimmage but I was able to do pretty much everything. I felt better today, that’s for sure.”\n\nAs part of his recovery process, he was a guinea pig for the latest workout contraption inside the Pistons practice facility. A chamber called “Colorado Altitude Training” was constructed in the weight area, where high altitude can be simulated as players are working out on the bike or treadmill.\n\n“It’s like you’re at 9,000 feet,” strength and conditioning coach Arnie Kander said. “It’s set at whatever you want but 9,000 feet is the optimal level to train at.”\n\nBillups, a Denver native, is used to the training at high altitudes – but not that high.\n\n“As soon as I walked in there, I could feel the air was thin,” he said. “Denver’s only 5,200 feet, so it’s different. I only rode (the bike) 20 minutes and I wasn’t even riding at a high pace and it definitely gets you tired.”\n\nAnother thing that Billups is tired of is watching his backcourt partner get banged around.\n\n“They’re beating my buddy up,” he said. “You know he can’t take too much of a beating, anyway. I’ve got to get back and help my man out.”"
