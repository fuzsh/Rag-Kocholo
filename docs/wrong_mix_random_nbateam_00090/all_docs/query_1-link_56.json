        "text": "La La Anthony is disclosing what transpired in her relationship with former NBA player Carmelo Anthony that caused it to end.\n\nOn a recent edition of Alex Cooper's podcast Call Her Daddy, the actress discussed this. She explained that the couple's \"end\" began when he was traded from the Denver Nuggets to the New York Knicks in 2011.\n\n\"I'm from New York so being here is nothing new. When we lived here under all of that, that's when things became complicated,\" she said. \"Now that I look back, that was kind of the start of the demise of the marriage.\"\n\nAlong with fellow Nuggets players Chauncey Billups, Shelden Williams, Anthony Carter, and Renaldo Balkman, Melo was traded to the Knicks in 2011.\n\nWilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov, two future second-round draft picks, and a first-round draft pick from 2014 were sent to Denver in return.\n\nLa La Anthony explained the pressure it put on their relationship\n\nLa La claimed that going to New York resulted in more media scrutiny. \"It's incredibly difficult. Even if it wasn't the only factor, being in New York City and constantly having the public's attention on you made things difficult.\n\nLa La claimed that whereas Denver was \"laid back,\" New York made her feel as though she had to put in \"grind time.\" She claims that eventually she \"went into overdrive with my career.\"\n\n\"We had some great times. We have a beautiful son, Kiyan, who's amazing,\" she said. \"It wasn't all bad. We had great, great times. It ended bad, but we're still friends and we co-parent great.... Life is just about lessons and going through different phases, and that was a phase in my life, a chapter in my life. And now, that chapter's over but it's never really over when you have a kid with somebody.\""
