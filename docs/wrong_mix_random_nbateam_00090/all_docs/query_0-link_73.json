        "text": "AUBURN HILLS >> Chauncey Billups grew up a fan of the Bad Boys Pistons and the backcourt duo of Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars. He never imagined his jersey would hang in the rafters alongside Dumars and Thomas, but Wednesday night that became a reality as the Detroit Pistons organization retired Billups’ No. 1 jersey.\n\n‘It’s crazy, I really don’t believe that my name and my jersey is going to go up there with those guys and nobody will be able to wear that number again,’ Billups said. ‘As I went through my career, focused and did the best I could, I never shot for that. That was never a goal of mine. I just wanted to be the best that I could be, I didn’t know that, that was my best. It’s humbling.’\n\nBillups recalls his cousin being a huge Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan fan, while he favored the Pistons’ Thomas and Dumars. So after bouncing around the league and four teams in his first five seasons, fate would have it, Dumars was the one offering Billups a chance for stability and to be the point guard of the Pistons.\n\n‘The whole outfit was just tailor made for me I thought,’ Billups said of signing with the Pistons in the summer of 2002. ‘This team was already up and coming. This team wasn’t rebuilding. I personally was in a position where I thought I was ready. I didn’t find that out until we started playing. But I had been through a lot at that time.\n\n‘I was coming from a situation where I had two guys who really mentored me, really helped me in Terrell Brandon and Sam Mitchell, that meant the world to me. Taught me everything. Taught me how to study my game, study myself, study my opponents, study my plays, the other team, taught me so much about the game. Taught me how to dress, taught me everything.\n\n‘Not only on the floor did I think I was ready, but I thought I was ready to be in a leadership position off the floor as well. This situation presented itself in an unbelievable way.\n\n‘Everything was tailor made for me to make this decision. … The timing was perfect, the opportunity was perfect. I was ready. I thought what I brought to the table, the team needed. It was a perfect match, perfect timing.’\n\nThe Pistons would trade for Richard Hamilton the same summer Billups’ signed. Billups knew right away the chemistry between him and Hamilton was special, and they had the potential to do incredible things.\n\n‘You go through training camp and you’re just competing so hard,’ Billups said. ‘We’re all just trying to mark our territory, who are we going to be? What’s our role going to be? Not long after that, you start playing preseason games and I’m just seeing this dude is in constant motion at all times, high energy, unbelievable motor. Some of the things I’m not. I said, ‘This is going to be a perfect marriage, myself and Rip.’ The way we play is extremely competitive, we both are. Off the court, no egos, he likes to have fun, likes to joke, likes to laugh. It was just perfect. It didn’t take long at all for us to build a perfect bond.’\n\nThe Pistons would go on to make six straight Eastern Conference finals, two NBA Finals and win the NBA championship in 2004 with Billups being named NBA Finals MVP. But for Billups he looks back and feels like they could have done more.\n\n‘I feel like we almost underachieved here,’ Billups said. ‘I feel like we should have had more than one championship and been to the finals more than two times. Obviously, losing a Game 7, when you lose in a Game 7 of the finals that really tells you that both teams should have won. You play that long, you play that deep. But I do, I feel like two, maybe three championships, we were that good. Obviously, we have one. That’s something that we all have to live with and something we talk about.’\n\nThe championship was a special moment for Billups, but another favorite memory of his was checking into his first All-Star game along with Hamilton, Ben Wallace and Rasheed Wallace, who were all named All-Stars in 2006.\n\n‘There was no favorite moment,’ Billups said. ‘I would say obviously winning a championship, that was all I ever wanted to be, a champion. Not an MVP or anything, I just want to be a champion, especially coming from what I had been through my first five years in this league. So that was good. I would say my second biggest moment was when all four of us checked into the All-Star game. All four guys made the All-Star game that year. We checked in together. We played the same way that we play in the regular season, which was unpopular to do. That was a significant moment for me, it really was, to do it with my guys.’\n\nWallace already had his number retired by the Pistons last month and now Billups hopes after him, other members of the 2004 championship will have their numbers retired.\n\n‘It means a lot, … hopefully it will continue on this path, get other guys up there too,’ Billups said."
