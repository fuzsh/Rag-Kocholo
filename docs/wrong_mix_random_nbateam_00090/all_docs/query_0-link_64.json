        "text": "Our roundup of the latest news from metro Detroit and Michigan businesses as well as announcements from government agencies. To share a business or nonprofit story, please send us a message.\n\nPistonsâ Championship Point Guard Chauncey Billups Elected to Hoops Hall of Fame\n\nChauncey Billups, point guard and Finals MVP for the Detroit Pistonsâ 2004 NBA Championship team, has been elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2024. Billups becomes the second player from the 2004 championship team elected to the hall of fame and will be enshrined at the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass. Aug. 16-17.\n\nDrafted third overall by the Boston Celtics in the 1997 NBA Draft, Billups went on to play 1,043 career NBA games over 17 seasons with Boston, Toronto, Denver, Minnesota, Detroit, New York, and the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nBillups signed with Detroit in free agency in 2002 and played seven seasons with Detroit from 2002 to 2008 before returning to play his final NBA season â and eighth with the Pistons â in 2013.\n\nHe made five consecutive NBA All-Star teams (2006-2010), including three straight while playing for Detroit (2006-08). Billups was an All-NBA Second Team selection once (2006), All-NBA Third Team selection twice (2007 and 2009) and an All-Defensive Second Team selection twice (2005 and 2006).\n\nHe was also named the recipient of the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship award in 2008, the Joe Dumars Sportsmanship Award in 2009, and the Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year in the 2013.\n\nDuring his first stint with Detroit, the Pistons made the playoffs in all seven years, winning Eastern Conference Championships in 2004 and 2005 and the NBA Championship in 2004.\n\nâWe donât win a third NBA Championship without Chaunceyâs leadership,â says Joe Dumars, former Detroit Pistons player, president, and Hall of Famer.\n\nMint Cannabis Opens New Store in Oxford Township\n\nArizona-based Mint Cannabis has expanded its retail footprint in Michigan with the opening of its sixth location in the state. The new store, located at 592 Lakeville Road in Oxford Township, is the first Mint Cannabis location in Detroitâs northern suburbs.\n\nâWeâre thrilled to continue increasing the number of stores we operate in Michigan, as weâre aiming to double our retail footprint here within the next year,â says Fadi Kenaya, head of midwest region operations for Mint Cannabis, which operates additional Michigan locations in Monroe, Portage, Kalamazoo, Monroe, and Mt. Pleasant. âWe look forward to serving more markets not only in the Great Lakes State, but throughout the country.â\n\nThe Mintâs 2,500-square-foot store in Oxford Township offers more than 50 brands and more than seven registers to ensure there is little-to-no wait time.

This effort allows students to reduce the overall cost of obtaining a BSN degree by attending Schoolcraft College for two years to complete their ADN before transferring to Oakland University to finish a BSN.\n\nâWe are excited for this opportunity to work collaboratively with Schoolcraft to smooth the transition for students seeking their BSN at Oakland University,â says April Powell-Thomas, director of advising and student services Oakland University School of Nursing.\n\nFor more information, visit here.\n\nRoof Resource in Macomb Township Launches Be The Hero Partnership Program\n\nMacomb Township-based The Roof Resource, a company dedicated to simplifying roof replacement for homeowners at cost, is offering schools and local organizations a chance to âBe The Heroâ for their community and group by participating in a new affinity program.\n\nThe Roof Resourceâs Be The Hero affinity program reinvests funds into the community, enabling schools and community organizations to raise funding for initiatives such as sports, music programs, church outings, or any great cause, while helping those in need of a new roof share in the benefit by saving thousands of dollars on their project with roof replacement by The Roof Resource.\n\nThere is no cost to organizations to participate and each partner group receives an exclusive offer not available to the public that will help fund programs for their cause through the program. The Roof Resource also provides the tools necessary for successful fundraising including fliers, email and social messaging, and dedicated support for each organization.\n\nâSupporting the communities we serve is one of our core values and our Be The Hero program is just one of the ways we give back,â says Michael Harvey, founder and CEO of The Roof Resource. âIt is a simple, easy and safe way for people to raise money for their cause and help those in the market for a new roof recognize significant savings on that purchase â it is truly a win-win for everyone.â\n\nC3 Industries in Ann Arbor Offers Gas for Gas to Minnesota Consumers\n\nC3 Industries, which has its headquarters in Ann Arbor, announced its High Profile Ironwood dispensary in Minnesota is starting its Gas for Gas Campaign, giving consumers the chance to earn prepaid gas cards by shopping at the Ironwood location. The offer is good while supplies last.\n\nMinnesotans 21 years and older, who show their state driverâs license and spend $250 or more at High Profile Ironwood, will receive a $25 prepaid gas gift card, and also can take advantage of low-priced bundles and deals on cannabis products when they visit the newly opened dispensary.\n\nC3âs Gas for Gas Campaign pays homage to the term âgasâ or âgassy,â which is used to describe the distinctive scent of certain strains of cannabis. Originating from âgasoline,â it denotes the potent, refined fragrance reminiscent of fuel found in many popular varieties.\n\nWOW! Internet Construction Underway in Livingston County\n\nWOW! Internet, TV & Phone, a broadband services provider, has broken ground and begun construction of its all-fiber network in its greenfield market of Livingston County.\n\nThe construction continues the companyâs recent surge in market expansion momentum, with WOW! recording the most robust growth of its all-fiber network in the companyâs 25-year history.\n\nLate last year, WOW! announced plans to add 80,000 homes to its footprint in Michigan.\n\nâProviding customers with an array of fast, value-priced and comprehensive choices when it comes to broadband services is at the core of what we do at WOW!,â says Teresa Elder, CEO of WOW!. âWe continue to build and extend our footprint to reach even more customers and canât wait for these new communities to benefit from WOW!âs reliable, all-fiber network and our commitment to simplified pricing and an exceptional customer experience.â"
