        "text": "MIAMI BEACH, FL, November 30, 2017 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Five-time NBA All-Star, three-time All-NBA selection, and ESPN Analyst Chauncey \"Mr. Big Shot\" Billups is partnering with Miami Beach-based Gentera Center for Regenerative Medicine's newly launched Gentera Sports division. Gentera is a trusted pioneer in the regenerative medicine space. The center has an exemplary track record of serving current and former superstar athletes to heal from degenerative conditions so that they can reach their fullest potential.\n\n\"We are thrilled that Chauncey had such a positive experience with his own cell-based treatment at Gentera Center for Regenerative Medicine that he wants to advocate the regenerative health and lifestyle to the next generation of athletes,\" said Brian Pla, Co-Founder/CEO and partner Louis Arriola. \"He is a dynamic individual who played and succeeded at the highest level of the game. Partnering with Gentera will push us to deliver the same quality care and service to our patients so that they can exceed expectations with minimal limitations.\"\n\nWhen Billups aimed to get in optimal shape for the start of the Big3's Big 3-on-3 League that began over the summer, his goal was to strengthen and return to his pre-degenerative knee condition; therefore he came to Gentera for help. Together with Dr. Sharon McQuillan and Ft. Lauderdale's Ageless Health and Surgery Center, Gentera devised a treatment plan that included: bone marrow aspiration and Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), autologous stem cells were harvested from Billups' body, which were infused back into both of his knees. (Stem cells promote the body's ability to heal itself).\n\nIn nearly three months, the retired NBA All-Star felt ready to begin training and wanted to join Gentera to encourage professional athletes' both past and present to utilize this proactive lifestyle approach to health which will allow them to stay healthy longer and to bounce back from injury sooner.\n\nLocated in Miami Beach, Florida, Gentera Center for Regenerative Medicine is focused on enhancing patients' health, wellness, beauty, and longevity with a unique integrative approach to care.
