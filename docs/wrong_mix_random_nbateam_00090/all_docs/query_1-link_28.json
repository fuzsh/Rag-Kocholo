        "text": "BAR:\n\nHOUSTON’S\n\nHouston’s is a high-end chain of sleek American restaurants, with a new one that just opened in Cherry Creek North at 303 Josephine St. It’s one of the places where Chauncey and Piper Billups hang out. Houston’s is the flagship brand of Hillstone Restaurant Group, the people who also run the popular Cherry Creek Grill a few blocks away. A combo plays in the small Houston’s bar, which, combined with the open kitchen and sushi bar, adds a certain excitement to the space.\n\nGRILLED:\n\nCHAUNCEY & PIPER BILLUPS\n\nChauncey and Piper Billups, both 33, are Denver natives. They met at George Washington High School when they were 17 — and have been sweethearts ever since. Chauncey is a celebrated point guard for the Denver Nuggets; Piper is active in various charities in town. And they are both poised to begin their own nonprofits at a reception Oct. 30 at Neiman Marcus. Chauncey will launch the Chauncey Billups Foundation to fund local groups that help kids from low-income families. Piper will introduce the Spread Her Wings Foundation, an agency that aims to culturally enrich the lives of challenged girls in Colorado. $150 at 310-649-5222. Go to givingback.org for tickets. They both order lemonades.\n\nBH: No drinks?\n\nChauncey: I never drink.\n\nPiper: I’ll just have a glass of wine now and then.\n\nBH: Did you get into lots of fights in the playground with a name like Chauncey?\n\nChauncey: I got into a lot of fights, but it wasn’t because of my name. Being from the neighborhood with a name like Chauncey, people think I got picked on. But a lot of strange names come out of the neighborhood.\n\nBH: What about your nicknames?\n\nChauncey: You mean “Smooth” and “Mr. Bigshot.” I got “Smooth” when I was growing up. I got “Bigshot” playing in Detroit. People who know me from Denver call me “Smooth.”\n\nBH: You’re a big Broncos fan.\n\nChauncey: Diehard.\n\nBH: Would you rather watch football or basketball on TV?\n\nChauncey: Oh, football.\n\nBH: What is your greatest extravagance?\n\nPiper: Purses and shoes.\n\nChauncey: I’m a cars guy. We have four or five cars.\n\nPiper: We have eight.\n\nChauncey: I guess.\n\nBH: What’s your favorite car?\n\nChauncey: I drive a Range Rover almost every day, but my favorite is my ’69 SS Camaro.\n\nBH: You have three daughters: Cydney, Ciara and Cenaiya. And no pets?\n\nPiper: When we get a dog, it has to be a boy. He feels outnumbered.\n\nBH: Do you miss not playing H.O.R.S.E. with a son?\n\nChauncey: I don’t know, I’ve never had a son. But I have lots of boy cousins, a lot of substitutes.\n\nPiper: And he plays with the girls all the time.\n\nBH: What are your favorite restaurants?\n\nPiper: We love Del Frisco’s. The filet and the lemon cake. And Houston’s. Jing.\n\nBH: What do you eat when you’re not training?\n\nChauncey: Burgers. Cheeseburgers. Fried chicken. French fries. All the bad stuff.\n\nPiper: And he’s a sweet eater. We have an aunt who makes caramel cakes.\n\nChauncey: Oh, man.\n\nBH: What’s on your iPods?\n\nPiper: Our favorite right now is Jay-Z.\n\nChauncey: I am a big music guy. Hip-hop, R&B, old school, jazz.\n\nBH: Do you watch TV?\n\nPiper: When I’m not busy with the girls. My favorite is “King of Queens.”\n\nChauncey: Yeah, that’s funny.\n\nBH: What talent would you like to have?\n\nChauncey: If I was blessed by another profession, I wish I could sing.\n\nPiper: I wish I could, too.\n\nBH: When and where were you the happiest?\n\nPiper: Right now.\n\nChauncey: Yes. This very minute, man. And I had a blast in high school. A blast.\n\nBH: They say it’s a blessed man who knows he’s happy when he’s happy.\n\nChauncey: I am definitely happy.\n\nPiper: We’re just happy to be home, have all our friends and family around. We just had a cookout. We played dominos and cards with all the kids playing and running around and playing soccer.\n\nBH: How do people in Denver treat you?\n\nChauncey: Everybody is good to me, man. This town has seen me grow up and become who I have become.\n\nBH: What about your life off the court? The interviews? The endorsements?\n\nChauncey: It’s not hard, but you get tired of it. I like to talk about my foundation. I’ve said enough about myself.\n\nBH: Well, sorry.\n\nChauncey: No, you’re cool. This is cool.\n\nBH: Your greatest fear?\n\nChauncey: One of them used to be cats. But I’m not as scared of them as I used to be. My biggest fear is the ocean, getting wet. I like looking at the ocean, but not going into it.\n\nPiper: That’s why we’ve never gone on a cruise. You hear all those stories about people getting lost, going overboard.\n\nBH: What’s your favorite vacation spot?\n\nChauncey: Maui.\n\nBH: But you’re surrounded by water!\n\nChauncey: Yeah, but not in the water.\n\nBH: On what occasion do you lie?\n\nChauncey: I lie all the time. Like when I am supposed to be someplace, someone calls me and I always say I am just around the corner.\n\nPiper: And he could be just leaving the house. But all his friends know.\n\nBH: What’s the quality you like most in Chauncey?\n\nPiper: His sense of humor.\n\nBH: Chauncey?\n\nChauncey: There are so many of them. She’s the most loyal person I have ever met.\n\nBH: What would you change in yourself?\n\nPiper: I wish I was a little taller.\n\nChauncey: I wish I had a better memory. And am just emotionless sometimes. I would show my emotions more.\n\nBH: Motto?\n\nChauncey: Oh, I have a lot of them.\n\nPiper: What about your tattoos?\n\nChauncey: On my right arm it reads “No pain.” On the left, “No fame.”"
