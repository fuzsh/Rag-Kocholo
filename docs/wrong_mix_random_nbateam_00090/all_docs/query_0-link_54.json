        "text": "NEW YORK – The NBA today released its complete game schedule and broadcast schedules of ABC, TNT, ESPN, NBA TV, and NBA on ESPN Radio for the 2010-11 season.\n\nThe countdown to Kia Motors NBA Tip-Off ’10 has begun, with opening night 78 days away. This is the third consecutive season that Kia Motors, the Official Automotive Partner of the NBA, has been the lead partner of NBA Tip-Off.\n\nThe league’s 65th season tips off on Tuesday, Oct. 26, with two games on TNT – the 15th straight season the league opens with a doubleheader on TNT. Kia Motors NBA Tip-Off ’10 features a combined eight nationally televised games in the first four days on TNT and ESPN, which opens its ninth consecutive year of NBA coverage on Wednesday, Oct. 27, with a doubleheader.\n\nKia Motors NBA Tip-Off ’10 includes the two-time defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers and Finals MVP Kobe Bryant beginning their quest for the team’s third consecutive title when they host the Houston Rockets in the much anticipated return of All-Star center Yao Ming (TNT, Oct. 26, 10:30 p.m. ET). Before the game, TNT will televise the championship ring ceremony.\n\nThe 2010-11 schedule includes the first NBA regular-season games to be played in Europe when two of the league’s best young big men – Brook Lopez of the New Jersey Nets and Andrea Bargnani of the Toronto Raptors – and their teams tip off twice at The O2 arena in London on March 4-5, as part of NBA Games – London 2011. To date, the NBA has staged a total of 13 regular-season games outside of the United States and Canada – in Japan and Mexico – since 1990.\n\nReturning this season are Heritage Week, featuring classic rivalries with teams wearing Hardwood Classics uniforms, and the NBA’s Noche Latina program, which celebrates the league’s Hispanic heritage with special telecasts and in-arena festivities. Dates and teams for both will be announced at a later date.\n\nHighly anticipated television matchups throughout the regular season include:\n\nBoth games between 2010 Finals opponents, the Boston Celtics and Lakers, will be televised nationally. The Lakers, with All-Stars Bryant and Pau Gasol, host All-Stars Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo and the rest of the Celtics on Sunday, Jan. 30 (ABC, 3:30 p.m. ET). The Lakers then travel cross-country to take on the Celtics on Thursday, Feb. 10 (TNT, 8 p.m. ET).\n\nBoth games between the NBA champion Lakers and the Miami Heat, led by their All-Star triumvirate of Chris Bosh, reigning NBA Most Valuable Player presented by Kia Motors LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade, will air nationally. The Lakers host the Heat on Christmas Day on ABC (5 p.m. ET), with the Heat hosting in Miami on March 10 on TNT (8 p.m. ET).\n\nOne of the league’s most experienced and battle-tested teams matches up against one of its youngest and most explosive squads on Nov. 19, when Boston’s quintet of stars – Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O’Neal, Paul Pierce and Rajon Rondo – hosts reigning scoring champion Kevin Durant, emerging star Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder (ESPN, 7 p.m. ET).\n\nTNT’s Thanksgiving night doubleheader will begin with All-Stars Joe Johnson and Al Horford leading the Hawks against the Washington Wizards and John Wall, the top overall selection in the 2010 NBA Draft (8 p.m. ET). The second game features Blake Griffin, last year’s top overall selection, and the Los Angeles Clippers hosting reigning T-Mobile NBA Rookie of the Year Tyreke Evans and the Sacramento Kings (10:30 p.m. ET).\n\nIn James’ first visit to Cleveland as an opposing player, the Heat takes on Antawn Jamison and the Cavaliers on Dec. 2 (TNT, 8 p.m. ET).\n\nIn one of the league’s best rivalries, All-Stars Chauncey Billups and Carmelo Anthony lead the Denver Nuggets when hosting the Los Angeles Lakers and All-Stars Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol on Friday, Jan. 21 (ESPN, 10:30 p.m. ET).\n\nThe Orlando Magic, led by reigning Defensive Player of the Year Dwight Howard and star guard Jameer Nelson, hosts All-Star Derrick Rose and the new-look Chicago Bulls, including star forward Carlos Boozer, on March 4 (ESPN, 7 p.m. ET).\n\nTwo of the league’s most potent offenses go head-to-head when the Steve Nash-led Phoenix Suns, which led the league in scoring last year, host the Denver Nuggets and their high-octane offense, powered by All-Stars Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups, on Thursday, March 10 (TNT, 10:30 p.m. ET).\n\nIn its 27th year of NBA coverage, TNT will televise 52 regular-season games, including 44 as part of Thursday night doubleheaders and a doubleheader on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. TNT will also exclusively televise NBA All-Star 2011 festivities in Los Angeles Feb. 18-20, culminating with the NBA’s 60th All-Star Game on Sunday, Feb. 20.\n\nESPN will televise 75 regular-season games, which include 27 games on Wednesdays and 35 on Fridays. ESPN telecasts are also available via ESPN3.com, with nearly all on ESPN Mobile TV. ESPN Deportes (ESPN’s Spanish-language U.S. sports network) will also televise 22 regular-season games and, for the first time, select games will be available on ESPN3D. The ABC national television schedule consists of 13 exclusive regular-season broadcasts and tips off with a doubleheader on Christmas Day.\n\nThe NBA on ABC and ESPN presents flexible scheduling throughout the regular season in order to provide the most compelling matchups to a national audience.\n\nNBA TV tips off its 96-game regular season schedule on Saturday, Oct. 30, when the Rockets welcome the Nuggets at 8:30 p.m. ET. For the third consecutive year, NBA TV will feature Fan Night on Tuesdays throughout the season, debuting Nov. 2. On Fan Night, NBA fans are given the opportunity to vote for the games they want to see televised nationally on NBA TV on that particular night.\n\nThe NBA on ESPN Radio’s 26-game regular-season schedule begins opening night, with the Celtics hosting the Heat. The NBA on ESPN Radio will also broadcast all the events from NBA All-Star 2011 in Los Angeles.\n\nFor the eighth straight season, ABC will exclusively broadcast The Finals, which tips off in June 2011. This season, TNT is the exclusive home of the 2011 NBA Eastern Conference Finals and ESPN will exclusively televise the 2011 NBA Western Conference Finals.\n\nOnce again, NBA LEAGUE PASS will offer up to 40 out-of-market games per week. NBA LEAGUE PASS, launched in 1994, is the ultimate viewing experience for basketball fans who want to watch their favorite teams, players and matchups from outside their local markets (blackout restrictions apply). Games included in NBA LEAGUE PASS are in addition to those available on ABC, TNT, NBA TV, ESPN, ESPN2 and local networks (such as a regional sports network and/or over-the-air station). NBA LEAGUE PASS is available on DIRECTV, DISH Network, and most digital cable and telephone providers.\n\nNBA.com offers day-by-day and team-by-team schedules as well as regular-season telecast schedules of the league’s North American broadcast partners – ABC, ESPN, TNT, NBA TV, and the NBA on ESPN Radio.\n\nNBA games and programming are currently seen in 215 countries and territories in 41 languages."
