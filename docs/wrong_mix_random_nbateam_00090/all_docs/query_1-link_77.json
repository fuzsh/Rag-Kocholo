        "text": "Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n\nBacklash over the Portland Trail Blazers' negotiations with Chauncey Billups to become their next head coach could reportedly lead to Damian Lillard requesting a trade.\n\nChris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reported Lillard was not consulted on the pending hire of Billups, who was accused of rape along with former teammate Ron Mercer in 1997. Concerns over the Blazers' inability to build a contender reportedly are also factoring into Lillard's uncertain future in Portland.\n\nLillard endorsed Billups and Jason Kidd in an interview with Jason Quick and Shams Charania of The Athletic and said \"Jason Kidd is the guy I want\" in a previous interview with Haynes.\n\nIn light of the pushback from several members of the fanbase against Billups' hire—and Lillard's presumed role in making that happen—the All-NBA guard tweeted he was not aware of the past allegations against Billups and Kidd:\n\nKidd pleaded guilty to spousal abuse against his ex-wife, Joumana, in 2001. During their 2007 divorce proceedings, Joumana accused Jason of repeated physical and emotional abuse throughout their relationship.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks hired Kidd as their new head coach last week, despite the organization being three years removed from an investigative report that uncovered serial sexual harassment against women within the organization.\n\nA woman filed a civil lawsuit against Billups and Mercer in 1997, saying they raped her at the home of then-teammate Antoine Walker. A rape kit performed the day after the alleged assault found injuries to the woman's throat, cervix and rectum, along with bruising on her back. Semen was also found inside her vagina.\n\nAccording to her testimony, Billups and Mercer forced her to perform several \"unwanted\" sexual acts before she blacked out.\n\nBillups and Mercer later settled the civil suit. No formal charges were ever filed.\n\nWhile Lillard says he was unaware of the alleged violence against women, fans are understandably critical. The only two candidates Lillard publicly endorsed have been the subject of a domestic violence conviction and a rape allegation.\n\nEven if he didn't know of those issues, one could argue Lillard has a responsibility to speak out against their candidacy as the star of the organization."
