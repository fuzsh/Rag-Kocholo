        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — With the Lakers announcing that rookie guard Jalen Hood-Schifino has started his “return to play progression,” Coach Darvin Ham on Friday offered insight into what that process will look like.\n\nHood-Schifino, the No. 17 pick in June’s NBA draft who has been sidelined for a month because of a right patella contusion, will spend time with the organization’s G League affiliate, the South Bay Lakers.\n\n“Our G League system will help with that process,” Ham said ahead of the Lakers’ in-season tournament road game against the Portland Trail Blazers. “It’s just about him getting back in tune with just getting his game legs back under him and going up and down against competition. Our G League [team], that’s what that part of the program is for each and every team.\n\n“Not only to discover new talent, up-and-coming talent, but to also try to maintain and have maintenance, availability for your guys, your current young guys. Between us and South Bay, I think he’ll get brought up to speed pretty quickly.”\n\nLike most teams, the Lakers’ practice sessions will be limited with them fully entrenched in the rigors of an NBA regular-season schedule.\n\nThat will result in Hood-Schifino practicing against the team’s “stay-ready” group when he’s with the NBA team – players who play low or no minutes.\n\n“The biggest thing is trying to help him get into a rhythm,” Ham added. “It’s already a lot of challenges with him being a rookie, let alone that. I’m not worried. He’s a smart kid. He absorbs information well. And again, we have that segment of our program, South Bay, that’s going to assist us along with our stay-ready groups and whatnot that’s going to help bring him up to speed.”\n\nHam responded “we’ll see” when asked whether Hood-Schifino will spend the majority of his progression window with South Bay.\n\n“God forbid we have someone go down or whatever, that could change the circumstances,” Ham said. “Just having him back available and healthy is the No. 1 goal. And we’re excited about that.”\n\nLONGEVITY\n\nBlazers coach Chauncey Billups was an opponent of LeBron James for James’ first preseason NBA game – a matchup between James’ Cleveland Cavaliers and Billups’ Detroit Pistons on Oct. 7, 2003.\n\nMore than 20 years later, Billups, 47, is in his third season as Portland’s head coach and James, 38, is still dominating with the Lakers.\n\nJames, the league’s all-time leading scorer, was averaging 24.6 points (57% shooting), 8.6 rebounds and 6.1 assists in the 11 games he’s played this season entering Friday.\n\n“It’s just been incredible to watch him,” Billups said before Friday’s game. “He was dominant then, he’s dominant still now. It’s just different though now. He’s always played from the neck up. It’s probably been one of his best qualities, is he’s always two, three steps ahead in the way that he plays. He used to be such a freak of nature with his speed and getting around you. Every single time, like, if he’d get a quarter of a step on you, you’re done.\n\n“He doesn’t have that type of speed anymore, so a lot of times he’s kind of backing down now. He’s, most of the time, the biggest guy on the court with the way the game is now. So he’s using his body more and better in ways that he can back down in the post, in the mid-post, and get where he needs to go.”\n\nBillups was also an opponent of James for one of his greatest performances, when James scored the last 25 points for the Cavaliers in their double-overtime victory over the Pistons in Game 5 of the 2007 Eastern Conference finals.\n\n“He’s probably going to go down when he’s done as the greatest player of all time based on the longevity and how dominant he’s been the entire time,” Billups said. “I feel lucky to have been a part of that. Probably one of his most iconic games I was a part of, on the wrong end of it – when he had like 25 straight points on us. We all, one day when we get really old, we’ll be telling our grandkids and stuff that we watched that whole movie. So we’re all pretty lucky to be able to say that, to be honest.”"
