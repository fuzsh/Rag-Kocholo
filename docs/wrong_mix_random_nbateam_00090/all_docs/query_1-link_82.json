        "text": "User Note: This page is updated as of Tuesday, June 25, 2024.\n\nOnce upon a time, Chauncey Billups was the lead floor general for the beloved mid-2000s Detroit Pistons. In fact, it was Billups who took home Finals MVP in 2004 when the Pistons won it all. Now that his playing days are behind him, Billups is on to coaching. Billups is currently in the middle of his third season as a head coach with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nBut how much does this player-turned-coach make? In this post, we discuss Billups’ contract, his net worth, his coaching record, and more.\n\nChauncey Billups Contract And Salary\n\nBillups is going into the fourth year of a five-year deal with the Blazers (the final year is a team option). According to Salary Swish’s database, Billups’ contract is a 5-year, 10-million dollar deal. So, he is making about two million dollars annually.\n\nThat figure is on the lower side, even for first-time head coaches. For instance, Adrian Griffin (a first-time head coach) was making four million dollars annually on his deal with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nChauncey Billups Playing Career Earnings\n\nAs we mentioned, Billups had a long and prosperous playoff career spanning nearly two decades with seven different NBA teams. And as a multiple-time All-NBA guard and Finals MVP, Billups made himself quite a bit of money during that time.\n\nAccording to HoopsHype, Billups made about 106.2 million dollars during his playing days. When adjusted for inflation, that is the equivalent of 159.2 million dollars today.\n\nChauncey Billups Net Worth\n\nAccording to the website Celebrity Net Worth, Billups’ net worth is roughly 35 million dollars. He’s only been a coach for four years (three with Portland and one with the Los Angeles Clippers). So, it is safe to assume that most of this wealth came from his time as an NBA player.\n\nChauncey Billups Head Coaching Record\n\nIn 246 regular season games, Billups has a record of 81-165 (win percentage of 32.9%). Those marks don’t put him too high up the all-time head coaching leaderboards. As it stands, Billups is 170th all-time in regular season wins and tied for 260th all-time in win percentage (with Red Kerr and Jerry Reynolds).\n\nBillups has never been the head coach of a playoff game.\n\nChauncey Billups Wife\n\nBillups is married to Piper Billups. The couple has been married since 2001. They met each other in high school. Billups and his wife have three daughters: Cydney, Ciara, and Cenaiya."
