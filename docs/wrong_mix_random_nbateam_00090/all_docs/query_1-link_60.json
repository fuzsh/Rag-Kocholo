        "text": "Blake Griffin’s girlfriend gets a lot of press attention because he’s a famous dude. The following women are all too familiar with this phenomenon. However, that’s the price of dating a pro basketball star. In fact, a young model named Samantha Hoopes wondered aloud how it would be to date the man. Good luck, Samantha! Now that Blake dated a few ladies in the public eye, let’s list them all and talk about them in…\n\nDwane Casey’s wife Brenda Casey is the mom to the Raptors’ coach two kids. Justine and Zachary were born in 2008 and 2011 respectively. Dwane was already deep into his coaching career, serving as an assistant coach in Dallas when both kids were born. Heading North of the Border Since his time in Dallas, Dwane has moved to Toronto as the head coach. Dwane has become the king of the North, unfortunately, until the year…\n\nChauncey Billups’ wife Piper Billups met him at George Washington High School in Denver, Colorado. That was back in the mid 90’s. They stayed together ever since then, and the couple married in July of 2001. In fact, Piper said they met at a barbecue at the age of fifteen, according to The Baller Life. She said they hung out every day after that. Apparently they went out to dinner with friends the same day they met…\n\nStanley Johnson’s mother Karen Taylor bred him to be an NBA player. She was known as “Coach K” when Stanley was a kid because of her deep knowledge of the game. Karen was formerly a collegiate player at Jackson State and was apparently pretty slick. She would spend most of her days as a mom in the gym with Stanley, coaching him and training him to knock down jumpers. She started a special AAU basketball…\n\nThe many lives of Jenna Shea. Andre Drummond’s “girlfriend” Jenna Shea seems to have a knack for getting together with famous athletes and celebrities. In the strictest sense, Jenna Shea is certainly not a girlfriend. She has a long history of making this fact clear. Back in 2013, she went on a huge Twitter rant about how she is no one’s girlfriend. This involved Peyton Siva thanking her on national television, and we talked about…\n\nIsiah Thomas’ wife Lynn Kendall has had a lot of emotional supporting to do over the years. Her husband, though a phenomenal player, followed a coaching path that just never seemed to work in any way, and no matter where Isiah went and what direction he turned, he could never seem to get wins out of his clubs. But one great win that he achieved off the court was nabbing Lynn. Lynn was Isiah’s girlfriend…\n\nGod, I’m getting old. iCarly is a thing? To who? My kid sure doesn’t watch it, but apparently it’s a big kids show? Seriously, do people know this? Apparently the Pistons big man knows about iCarly, as seen in Andre Drummond’s girlfriend Jennette McCurdy. McCurdy held a role on the Nickelodeon teen-driven show, iCarly, from 2007 to 2012.
