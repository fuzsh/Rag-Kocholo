        "text": "Orlando fails in an \"aggressive\" bid to land former Pistons point guard on bench for next season\n\nIf Chauncey Billups is destined to join the NBA coaching ranks, it won't be with the Orlando Magic next season.\n\nBillups, the former Detroit Pistons point guard who was named NBA finals MVP during the Pistons' 2004 championship run, declined an offer to become the top assistant to Frank Vogel and the Orlando Magic, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical.\n\nBillups is working for ESPN as an NBA studio analyst, but could make the jump to a coaching or front-office role in the future, Wojnarowski reported.\n\n\"The Magic were prepared to make Billups one of the NBAâ€™s highest-paid assistant coaches, an opportunity to which Billups gave serious consideration before deciding to stay in his role as a network television analyst,\" Wojnarowski wrote.\n\nBillups, 39, retired after the 2013-14 season, when he returned to the Pistons for one year and played in 19 games. He has career averages of 15.2 points, 5.4 assists and 2.9 rebounds from 1998-2014."
