        "text": "A year ago, Chauncey Billups decided he wanted to try something new.\n\nThe former Finals MVP, who had been an NBA studio analyst for ESPN since retiring in 2014, wanted to branch out and call games as a color commentator. Although Billups had no experience as an in-game analyst, ESPN granted his wish.\n\nBillups called “about 10 games” for the network, including two playoff games, during the 2018-19 season. His priorities quickly shifted. He was hooked on the thrill of providing real-time analysis.\n\n“I realized it was a ton harder than doing ‘NBA Countdown,'” Billups told The Athletic over the phone. “But I liked it. I was able to talk more basketball, able to give my insight on the game a lot more. So I just fell in love with it. I really enjoyed it.”\n\nWith his ESPN contract up this summer, and ESPN reshuffling the “NBA Countdown” crew, Billups entered media free agency intending to become a color commentator full-time. The surface-level analysis and hot takes of a studio show no longer appealed to him. Billups wanted to analyze basketball strategy: Xs and Os, schemes, lineups, etc.\n\nThe dilemma was that ESPN’s crop of in-game analysts was relatively set. Billups lacked the seniority and experience of Jeff Van Gundy, Mark Jackson, Doris Burke and Hubie Brown. There were still spots for him in ESPN’s national schedule, but not enough to satiate his hunger.\n\n“I’m like the new guy there as far as calling games,” Billups said. “There wasn’t a lot of inventory, so, me being me, I know that there’s no way I’m going to get a lot better without a ton of reps.”\n\nWhile Billups negotiated with ESPN, the Clippers and FOX Sports/Prime Ticket reached out to him about the broadcast’s vacant in-game analyst role. FOX Sports/Prime Ticket was leaning towards hiring Brian Sieman to replace Ralph Lawler and wanted to test how Billups would mesh with him in the booth.\n\nThe two were brought in to audition and announce part of a game together. They immediately clicked. Sieman’s enthusiasm was balanced out by Billups’ calm, cool demeanor.\n\n“I know right now, for sure, the chemistry’s going to be really good,” Billups said of his connection with Sieman. “We haven’t called any games together, but I can tell just by the energy and the little bit we called then it won’t take us long at all to become really cohesive on air. He’s a professional. He’s really good at what he does.”\n\nSieman, who spoke with The Athletic last week, said of the audition: “There was a built-in rapport that will get better as we go on. But it was easy because he has no ego. He doesn’t need to be touted as who he is: a former Finals MVP and a five-time All-Star. I don’t think he really cares about that. He just wanted to talk hoops.”\n\nNot long after his audition, Billups re-signed with ESPN to call some national TV games and signed with FOX Sports/Prime Ticket to announce two-thirds of the Clippers’ season alongside Sieman, with Corey Maggette and Mike Fratello splitting the remaining third.\n\n“I just thought it’d be the perfect marriage,” Billups said. “I was a Clipper at one point late in my career. I feel like I was a part of the turnaround of the Clippers. The year that I got there, the excitement kind of changed. Chris (Paul) was traded there. They brought me there off of amnesty. Blake (Griffin) and Chris were really young.\n\n“The tide turned a little bit for the organization.”\n\nAt first glance, there aren’t many similarities among the Clippers’ new broadcast team outside of each member being a first-timer in their respective roles and the crew being collectively on the younger side.\n\nSieman, 44, has been the Clippers’ radio play-by-play announcer for 12 years and in the business for more than 20 years. Billups, 43, entered TV five years ago after a 17-year NBA career. And Noah Eagle, who is replacing Sieman as the team’s radio announcer on AM 570 L.A. Sports, is a 22-year-old recent graduate of Syracuse and the son of renowned sports announcer Ian Eagle.\n\nBut the commonality that the Clippers and FOX Sports/Prime Ticket believe will make the trio a success is their dogged work ethic. Last season’s Clippers drew praise around the league for their hard-nosed, blue-collar approach on the floor. The Clippers, as an organization, have tried to replicate that culture with the rest of their employees as well.\n\nAll three broadcasters, in separate interviews with The Athletic, acknowledged the unique and exciting opportunity ahead of them next season — one that will certainly challenge them. Billups and Eagle, in particular, have to win over the fan base as fresh faces.\n\n“It really is almost like playing if you want to do a good job,” Billups said. “You have to put that time and effort and energy into it.”\n\nChampionship-caliber teams don’t come around often. Success draws more attention, and thus, more responsibility and pressure. There’s no chest-puffing or accolade-touting among the group. It’s just about the work.\n\n“I don’t expect to be perfect right away,” Eagle told The Athletic. “I expect to continue to improve throughout the season. … I’m hoping that I can continue to take steps forward by game 30 and then by game 60 and by game 82, I hope that I am in a good rhythm and have a groove going.”\n\n“I just live by a simple rule in this business,” Sieman said. “Work hard and be a good person. That’s really it. … I just feel so blessed to be in the NBA that I’m always happy when I go to work. I just feel like I’m the luckiest guy on the planet. I sincerely feel that way.”\n\nBillups, who enjoyed a Hall of Fame-worthy NBA career and is probably the face of the broadcast team given his stature and pedigree, humbly admits his inexperience and room for improvement with calling games.\n\n“I’m eager to continue to get better,” Billups said. “I’ve always just been a worker. I’m a hard worker and a guy that’ll just kinda keep my head down and work.\n\n“That’s just who I am no matter what I do.”\n\nWhat he lacks in broadcasting experience Billups tries to make up for with his deep-seated knowledge of the game and rigorous preparation.\n\nFirst, he’ll go back and watch each team’s previous two-to-four games. Then, he’ll read recent articles from the teams’ beat writers, scouring for quotes and videos from players and coaches. After that, he’ll comb through recent boxscores and season-long data, looking for statistical trends.\n\nAnd finally, before each game, he makes a point to head to the court to talk to as many players and coaches as he can to get their perspective on storylines and strategy.\n\n“This year, I’m gonna go to training camp (in Hawaii),” Billups said. “I won’t miss a practice. I want to know what the concepts and principles are. I need to get to know some of these guys and their personalities.”\n\nThe Clippers claimed Billups off of waivers when the Knicks used the amnesty clause on him following the 2011 lockout. A few days later, the team executed a blockbuster trade for Chris Paul and the Lob City era was born.\n\nAt the time, Billups was the starting shooting guard, sharing ball-handling duties with Paul and spreading the floor with his 38.7 percent career 3-point shooting. While in the twilight of his career, Mr. Big Shot was still a productive player. His championship experience and vocal leadership were also welcomed additions in a younger locker room.\n\nBillups was averaging 15 points and four assists through 20 games when he suffered a torn left Achilles tendon in February 2012. The injury ended his season and, effectively, his career.\n\nHe would go on to play 41 more games over his final two seasons, one with the Clippers and one with the Pistons, averaging 6.2 points and 2.2 assists. The injury, at 35 years old, was too debilitating to fully recover from.\n\n“I was at the end of my career, really just trying to help the young guys, knowing I was far past my prime,” Billups said. “My experience was awesome. I was playing with Chris. Blake was ascending into one of the better players in the game, as was DJ (DeAndre Jordan).\n\n“I really, really enjoyed my two years playing with the Clippers.”\n\nBillups still resides in Denver, Colo., where he lives with his wife, Piper, and youngest daughter, Cenaiya. His eldest daughter, Cydney, is a soccer player at the University of Texas, and his middle daughter, Ciara, is a dance student at USC — which is less than two miles from where Billups will be announcing games at Staples Center.\n\nReturning to Los Angeles to cover the Clippers is a full-circle moment for Billups, who has the chance to rewrite a premature ending.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of success they’ve had the last seven, eight years,” Billups said. “For me to have the opportunity to call their games with the excitement that they have now, bringing in a Finals MVP (Kawhi Leonard) and Paul George, who’s an MVP candidate, and the team that they already had around them with (Lou Williams) and Montrezl (Harrell) and (Patrick Beverley) and some of these young guys.\n\n“I’m just really, really excited to not only cover them but watch the progress all year.”\n\n(Top photo of Chauncey Billups: Sarah Stier / Getty Images)"
