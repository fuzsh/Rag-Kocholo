        "text": "She’s a big shot and smooth on the field, but Cydney Billups is in need of her own nickname.\n\n“When I was little, I called myself ‘Lil’ Big Shot,'” Billups said, “but I don’t have a nickname anymore.”\n\nThere’s no question the eldest daughter of former University of Colorado-Boulder standout and NBA star Chauncey Billups will earn one. After all, she’s already making a name for herself in a sport of her own.\n\n“I kind of wanted to make my own name in soccer, because we already have [the Billups name] in basketball,” she said.\n\nBillups started the sport in elementary school, where she played on a coed team with all of her friends. While she participated in basketball in middle school, her first love always stayed with her.\n\n“I just fell in love with soccer right when I played,” she said. “It was about my seventh or eighth grade year when I saw all of the older girls going on their [college] visits. [I thought] this is definitely something I would like to do.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Billups committed to play soccer at the University of Texas. While the future Longhorn toured her father’s alma mater first, Austin and burnt orange ultimately stole her heart.\n\n“CU already has my name there and everything, and I just wanted to create a new name for myself, and Texas was the perfect place to do it,” she said.\n\nBillups initially committed to the school in January of her sophomore year. Since then, she transferred to Mountain Vista, where she was forced to sit out a season due to transfer rules. In the past twelve months, she has also been through her share of hardships, but her family has been there to help her through.\n\n“They’re so supportive, the most supportive they could be,” Billups said. “I’ve been through a few injuries within the past year and they’ve been supportive through the surgeries. They come to all of my games. My sisters are there, my parents, my grandparents… they’re always there when I need them.”\n\nThat means we can expect the Billups cheering section this spring, when Cydney hopes to help the Golden Eagles to another state championship. However the season turns out, however, Billups will take the big shots in her life with someone who will make it a smooth transition no matter what.\n\n“It’s a big deal to have my dad behind me, because he knows the sport life, he definitely knows how hard I have to work,” Billups said."
