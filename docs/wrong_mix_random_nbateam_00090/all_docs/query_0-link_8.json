        "text": "Taj Gibson signed a one-year contract with the Hornets earlier this month. So he’ll spend most of the 2024-25 NBA season in Charlotte, about 600 miles away from his hometown of Fort Greene. Despite that distance, Gibson will still have a daily presence in his old neighborhood. Gibson and two lifelong friends recently formed a community-driven development firm, GFB, that will play a vital role shaping a new multi-use real estate project in Fort Greene. For Gibson and his partners, Tameek Floyd and Malik Brown, the project is an opportunity to uplift members of the community that molded them. Gibson, Floyd and Brown will be directly involved in the planning and implementation of the new project at the 240 Nassau Street Navy Yard Clubhouse. The site will have a community center with programming for Fort Greene residents of all ages and housing that will include a significant number of affordable apartments.\n\n“Growing up in NYCHA was a blessing and a curse – it made me who I am today, but I’ve also seen how limited resources and poor housing conditions can take a toll on families. We want to do our part in changing that cycle,” Gibson, who grew up in Ingersoll Houses in Fort Greene, said in a release. “This project will rethink and reopen a vital neighborhood resource informed directly by the needs of this community. Because when residents are involved in planning for the future of their neighborhood, it makes for better outcomes for everyone.”\n\nGibson, a former Knick, has a long history of community work in Fort Greene. Through the Taj Gibson Foundation, he provided support and unique opportunities for residents of his old neighborhood and beyond. This project is another opportunity for the 39-year-old Gibson to give back. “There’s so much work to do, and we’re ready to do our part,” he says.\n\n“I like big screens so you can see a lot of information,” Clippers owner Steve Ballmer said at the team’s unveiling on Friday in Inglewood. “That is important to me. I don’t like those corner boards that you sometimes have to look at, particularly if you’re sitting courtside in expensive seats. I like boards that are crisp.”"
