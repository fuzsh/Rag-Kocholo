        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n11 Aug 2023, 12:08\n\nCredit: BBC\n\nWhen Line of Duty reached the end of its most recent season, it was initially assumed that the hit BBC drama had finished for good.\n\nAfter six tense seasons, the drama, starring Vicky McClure, Adrian Dunbar and Martin Compston, reached what appeared to be its conclusion in 2021. However, with the finale seriously dividing opinion amongst fans, reports have since suggested that LoD will be back for more episodes.\n\nBut how did the story end, what is actually happening with potential new episodes, and what are the show’s stars saying?\n\nWhat happened at the end of Line of Duty series six?\n\nThe big reveal was that the mastermind behind the network of police corruption was seemingly hapless detective Ian Buckells (played by Nigel Boyle).\n\nThis left many fans disappointed.\n\n\"All the time we were here, thinking we were chasing some criminal mastermind, but no,\" Superintendent Ted Hastings (Dunbar) said to Buckells: \"Your corruption was mistaken for incompetence.\"\n\nWill there be a new series of Line of Duty?\n\nNothing official has been announced by the BBC, but reports suggest that Line of Duty is indeed coming back.\n\nIn December of last year, The Sun reported that the show will continue with “three new episodes of the smash-hit cop drama\" and that it would provide an ‘explosive climax’.\n\nWho will be in series seven of Line of Duty?\n\nWith nothing having been confirmed about the return of the show, there obviously isn't anything official about who would be in it, but it’s safe to assume that Martin Compston, Adrian Dunbar and Vicky McClure will be back as DS Steve Arnott, Superintendent Ted Hastings and DC Kate Fleming, respectively.\n\nThe trio sent fans into a frenzy by posting a reunion photo with the show’s creator, Jed Mercurio, last year.\n\nWhat are the stars of Line of Duty saying about a new series?\n\nWhen speaking exclusively to virginradio.co.uk at the Women of the Year Awards 2022, Vicky McClure admitted that she and her AC-12 pals would definitely be up for more episodes of the BBC drama. “We love the show. We desperately would love to do more,” she said.\n\nLast year, Adrian Dunbar intriguingly teased that the real criminal boss, known as “H” was still at large. “He’s not H,” he told Radio Times when speaking about Buckells. “We just got the guy we could actually pin a charge on. We didn’t get H, we got Buckells, the patsy.”\n\nHe added: “There’s been talk about a movie or a four-parter or two [episodes of] 90 minutes. We’d love to do it again. I’m really hoping something might happen next year.”\n\nMartin Compston has previously said: “We’re all delighted people still want us back. That conversation, we had a really honest one whether we were all up for doing it again, and I believe we all are.\"\n\nHe added, however: “There’s nothing immediate, there’s nothing coming very soon.”\n\nWhen will the potential new series of Line of Duty be out?\n\nWell, it was originally suggested that filming could have started as early as spring 2023, and that we might see new episodes as early as this Christmas. However, with no official announcement yet, and with spring now a distant memory, it doesn’t look like we’ll be seeing any new episodes for a while.\n\nPerhaps the reason for this is that Martin Compston is returning for a second season of Amazon’s The Rig. Upon the announcement of the actor’s involvement in the new season, reports suggested that he would be required to film through the summer, meaning that he probably wouldn’t be able to pull on his Steve Arnott waistcoat until October 2023 at the earliest.\n\nKeep an eye on virginradio.co.uk for more Line of Duty updates.\n\nMeanwhile, Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio has got a new ITV drama in the works, which will be led by Downton Abbey star Joanne Froggatt.
