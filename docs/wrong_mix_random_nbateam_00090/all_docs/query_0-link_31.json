        "text": "TUALATIN — The Portland Trail Blazers introduced Chauncey Billups as their new head coach Tuesday at the team’s practice facility, with Neil Olshey, team president of basketball operations, wasting little time addressing the issue that knocked this search back on its heels as soon as Billups was mentioned as a candidate.\n\nOlshey, with Billups sitting to his right, began by saying that the team had conducted an “expansive, thorough, equitable search” that landed on Billups.\n\nDuring that process, Olshey said, the franchise dug deep into a 1997 incident in which a woman accused Billups, then a 20-year-old rookie with Boston, a second Celtics player and another man of raping her after meeting at a comedy club.\n\nBillups, 44, was never charged in the case. The accuser filed a lawsuit in December 1998 that was settled out of court in January 2000.\n\nThe case left many Blazers fans recoiling at the idea of him becoming the Blazers’ head coach. Olshey said that he and everyone in the organization understood the concerns.\n\n“We took the allegations very seriously,” Olshey said. “And we treated them with the gravity that they deserved.”\n\nThe franchise came away from its independent investigation convinced that Billups had not engaged in wrongdoing, Olshey said.\n\n“The findings of that incident corroborated Chauncey’s recollection of the events that nothing non-consensual happened,” Olshey said. “We stand by Chauncey, everyone in the organization, and believe he’s the right choice to be our head coach, and the right choice to be the kind of ambassador in the Portland community everybody here has become accustomed to.”\n\nWith his wife, Piper, and three daughters at the news conference, Billups also addressed the allegations.\n\n“There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about how every decision that we make can have a profound impact on a person’s life,” Billups said. “I learned at a very young age as a player, not only a player but as a young man, a young adult, that every decision has consequences. That’s led to some really, really healthy and tough conversations that I’ve had to have with my wife, who was my girlfriend at the time in 1997, and my daughters about what actually happened, and about what they may have to read about me in the news and in the media.”\n\nBillups added that the experience shaped his life in many ways.\n\n“My decision making, obviously, who I allow to be in my life,” he said. “The friendships and the relationships that I have and how I can go about them. It’s impacted every decision that I make. It really has. And it’s shaped me in some unbelievable ways.”\n\nWith that, the news conference moved along, but not without questions regarding the entire search process that began June 4 when the Blazers and Terry Stotts agreed to part ways after nine seasons.\n\nBillups spent 17 seasons as a player in the NBA before becoming an analyst with ESPN. Cleveland in 2017 offered him the job of president of basketball operations in 2017. Billups landed his first coaching job last summer with the Clippers.\n\nOlshey said that even though those entities hired Billups, the Blazers wanted to make sure they had gone through their process.\n\nOlshey declined to offer more clarity regarding the vetting process, the firm hired to run the investigation or the information uncovered.\n\n“That’s proprietary,” Olshey said.\n\nDespite the negative reaction from some fans, Billups said his desire to accept the job never waned.\n\n“I’ve been around this game for a long time,” he said. “I know how this media thing goes. My dream was to be a head coach of a storied franchise. And when I tell you this is a dream job for me, I mean what I say. Obviously, having a player like Dame, and having CJ (McCollum), and having some of the great players that we have, makes any job more attractive. But at the end of the day, I wanted to be a head coach of a storied franchise, so it didn’t deter me at all from going after my dream. It didn’t then and it doesn’t now. So, I’m excited for that opportunity, regardless.”\n\nMcCollum and Blazers forward Robert Covington attended the news conference.\n\nBillups, who helped lead the 2003-04 Detroit Pistons to the NBA title as a point guard and was named Finals MVP, received a four-year contract, with a fifth-year team option.\n\nOlshey said that the team offered a lengthy deal despite Billups’ limited coaching experience because the franchise wants him to grow within the organization. They were looking for someone with “unrealized potential.”\n\n“We really believe in Chauncey,” Olshey said. “We want this to be a long-term hire. And we’re confident that it’s going to work out. … We didn’t hire the most experienced coach, but we think we hired the coach with the highest ceiling.”\n\nOlshey lauded Billups’ basketball IQ and competitive fire and said he has experienced success in his life, on and off the court.\n\n“Chauncey checked a lot of the boxes,” Olshey said. “We’re looking for leadership. He’s renowned as one of the great leaders we’ve had in the NBA. He’s a Hall of Fame point guard, in my opinion.”\n\nThe timing involving leaks about Billups being the hire and the team announcing it left star Damian Lillard in an awkward position and created an anxious few days for fans.\n\nOlshey said he couldn’t control the information leaks and that the delay in introducing Billups was due to scheduling issues given that the Clippers are playing in the Western Conference finals.\n\nThe team announced Billups’ hire on Sunday. The Clippers won Game 5 at Phoenix on Monday. The Blazers introduced him Tuesday, and he was set to fly to Los Angeles for Game 6 on Wednesday with his team down 3-2.\n\n“We know he’s the right choice for our franchise,” Olshey said.\n\nNow it’s up to Billups to win over his detractors. He said all he can do in that regard is be himself.\n\n“I’m just gonna be me at all times,” Billups said. “And it’s always worked for me in my life. I’m comfortable with who I am. My passion for the game, I’m passionate to win, my passion to lead and compete. Same for me, that’s what this fan base is all about. … I’ll come in and try to do the best job that I can, try to lead our guys the best I can. And everything just kind of happens organically, in my opinion.”\n\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)."
