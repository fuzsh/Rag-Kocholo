        "text": "The considerable attention thrown his way began when Chauncey Billups was a youth.\n\nIt started to turn legendary as an inner-city high school basketball star. He established a Boulder benchmark as a collegian. And while his NBA accolades came slowly despite being the third pick in the 1997 draft, his career, still alive going into Monday’s start of free agency, has included historical marks for 3-point and free-throw shooting, an NBA title, a Finals MVP award, five all-star appearances and the citizenship award for having the best character in the league.\n\nBut if there’s one thing that Billups, a former George Washington High School and University of Colorado star, can’t stand — despises, really — it’s the failure of others to acknowledge those who matter most to him.\n\n“My biggest pet peeve is when we’re out and people recognize me and want an autograph or something, and are acting like my family is invisible,” Billups said last week. “I want them to know they’re very important. I’m no more important than they are. They’re more important than me.”\n\nThe “King of Park Hill,” who began as the kid referred to as “Smooth” and turned into the man known as “Mr. Big Shot,” is 36 years old and a husband and father who wouldn’t have it any other way. He is one with his high school sweetheart and wife, Piper, and their daughters Cydney (15), Ciara (12) and Cenaiya (7).\n\n“It’s a balancing act, one that is more important to me now than basketball is,” Billups said. “I can’t tell you it was always like that, but I’ve been so blessed.”\n\nHe reached another milestone Thursday, when he joined former Notre Dame and Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann and Harrison Dillard, 89, the oldest living 100-meter Olympic sprint champion, in a 13-member Class of 2013 inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame.\n\n“When I started, I didn’t even know something like that existed,” Billups said.\n\nOthers did and felt strongly that Billups should be a part of it.\n\n“His character, integrity, personal commitment to youth and his willingness to accept the mantle of leadership is critically important as a role model for athletes of all ages,” said Bert Borgmann, the Colorado High School Activities Association assistant commissioner. “He defines the values and characteristics we hope that students playing high school activities learn and demonstrate as they move on in their lives.”\n\nBillups’ strength came into shape while he was raised near the corner of 29th and Poplar in northeast Denver. He was a regular at the Skyland Recreation Center (now named in honor of Hiawatha Davis), where he said he learned everything from basketball and swimming to checkers and dominos — in addition to leadership.\n\n“I’ve always been a leader since I was a kid. I never wanted to misuse that,” Billups said. “Not everybody had an opportunity to do that. I identified it at a young age and I embraced it, loved it.”\n\nOn to George Washington, where the son of parents (Ray and Faye) in the grocery industry was The Denver Post’s only four-time player of the year and a McDonald’s All-American. He starred on two state championship teams and reshaped his targets.\n\n“My goal when I was playing ball in ninth grade was to embark on a good high school career, then my goal was just to go to college,” Billups said. “My goals were shortsighted. I thought that If I didn’t get a scholarship, my parents wouldn’t have been able to afford that, they would have had to work more and even harder. … My strength and working hard came from them, and I was just trying to get to college. I wanted to be the first in my family to go to college and graduate.”\n\nIt didn’t go unnoticed. Former CHSAA commissioner Bob Ottewill, a part of the throngs who flocked to see Billups play for George Washington in the first half of the 1990s, said “he never big-timed you. He was always an outstanding kid.”\n\nFormer Denver Prep League district athletic director Leslie Moore always will be thankful that Billups was able to help fill the new Thunderdome at Manual, when Billups was a junior, “and it sure helped our budget.”\n\nBillups thrilled the Rocky Mountain region by selecting CU, even though he could have attended just about any college in the country.\n\n“If I had to do it again, 10 times over, I would still be a Buff,” he said.\n\nHe stayed for two seasons, leading CU to its first NCAA Tournament berth in nearly three decades.\n\nThe next 16 years in the NBA came with ups and downs, including trades, injuries and playing for seven teams, including the Nuggets on two occasions.\n\n“But I could never get down. I was still living my dream,” Billups said. “I couldn’t get in a funk against a little bit of adversity because I didn’t have any.”\n\nIt showed with the respect that made him one of the game’s most endearing personalities of the era. That was highlighted by his selection as the MVP of the 2004 NBA Finals, when he helped the Detroit Pistons upset the Los Angeles Lakers in five games. In 2008, Billups was named the NBA’s citizen of the year.\n\n“You know,” Faye Billups said, “growing up I would never have guessed Chauncey would have made it this far. I’m just so proud of him. It’s just beautiful.”\n\nNow healed after an Achilles tendon tear, Billups yearns to play two more seasons. And on the eve of NBA free agency, Billups said he has been pleased with the interest, perhaps hooking on with a team “that can win it.”\n\nIf not, he will pursue other options — ideally, something in the front office, although he hasn’t ruled out coaching — but they’ll have to be modified. Piper has done much of the work raising the girls, particularly while completing her marketing degree. Chauncey has become a soccer dad, watching Cydney during her freshman season at Valor Christian and emerging in club play. Ciara and Cenaiya are more into dance. All are strong students.\n\nWhat’s missing? Another generation of Billups kids on the basketball court.\n\n“I didn’t want my girls to play,” he said. “I didn’t deter them from it, but I’ve loved it. I didn’t want them to deal with that part, the pressure of being basketball players and me as their father.”\n\nBillups had seen younger brother Rodney go through the usual expectations. After playing at George Washington and the University of Denver, Rodney has climbed to be a key assistant on Tad Boyle’s staff at CU.\n\nAs the oldest daughter, Cydney rode the first wave of being a local star’s child, carrying the name and all that comes with it. She hasn’t blinked.\n\n“It’s really good to look up to someone like him,” Cydney said. “He’s a great person who not only has achieved a lot, but he’s also a good teammate and he’s good to everyone.”\n\nShe added that they value their privacy and family time, but her father knows more is coming. When Cydney starts dating, for example, does a teenager really want a still-chiseled Chauncey Billups answering the door after pulling into their driveway?\n\n“I’m not going to be the dad to not let my daughter live,” he said. “But the thing is, if you are a young man to meet and take my daughter out, or whenever it happens, you’re going to have to be a very respectful young man. I’ll let them grow up and experience life, but at the same time, I’m a dad.”\n\nBillups has a college degree in business management that he completed while rehabilitating his leg injury. It was a promise he made to his mother and something else he can point to when he and Piper continue applying the lessons of the three G’s to their children — guide, guard and govern.\n\nBillups realizes his king-of-the-court status is coming to a close as a player, but it doesn’t mean his job as head of the family is anywhere near an end.\n\n“It’s been like a fairy tale,” he said. “I was just playing and never even knew these things were out there. … I wanted to work my behind off and be the best player to ever come out of here. That’s what I shot for, wanted to do and in the process all of these things manifested.\n\n“It’s going so fast. I’m just so blessed, my life could have been so different. I’m just so happy with the way it has gone.”"
