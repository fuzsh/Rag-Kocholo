Uric acid, reduced glutathione, human serum albumin, and ascorbic acid (ASC) inhibited the consumption of pyrogallol red, but only ASC generated an induction time. Human blood plasma and human urine protected efficiently pyrogallol red. In these assays, both biological fluids generated neat induction times that were removed by ascorbate oxidase. From these results, ORAC-PGR method could be proposed as a simple alternative to evaluate an ORAC index and, simultaneously, to estimate the concentration of ascorbic acid in human blood plasma or human urine.\n\nComparison of Zika virus (ZIKV) RNA detection in plasma, whole blood and urineÂ - Case series of travel-associated ZIKVÂ infection imported to Italy, 2016.\n\nPubMed\n\nRossini, Giada; Gaibani, Paolo; Vocale, Caterina; Cagarelli, Roberto; Landini, Maria Paola\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe capability to detect ZIKV RNA is of crucial importance for cases confirmation. However, due to the short-lived viremia, the detection of ZIKV RNA in plasma/serum is challenging for samples collected more than one week after onset of clinical illness. We compared the window time and detection rate of ZIKV RNA in different specimen types (plasma, whole blood and urine) collected simultaneously at several times post-symptom onset. We examined the presence of ZIKV RNA in matched specimens of whole blood, plasma and urine collected in the same date (3-28 days after symptom onset) from 10 ZIKV infected patients. ZIKV RNA was found in plasma as late as 10 days after symptoms onset and tested positive in all 5 (100%) and in 2 of 6 (33,3%) plasma samples collected 1-5 and 6-10 days after symptoms onset, respectively. ZIKV RNA was positive in urine through the 21st day after symptom onset; the detection rate of ZIKV RNA in urine samples was 100% (11/11) for samples collected 1-10 days from symptoms onset, decreasing at later times of sampling. The detection rate of ZIKV RNA in whole blood was comparable to that in urine samples but extended the window of detection of ZIKV RNA up to 26 days after symptom onset. Our results highlight the usefulness of simultaneously testing multiple specimen types in order to extend the rate and the time frame of ZIKV RNA detection, increasing the possibility of cases confirmation through direct diagnosis in convalescence-phase of infection, supplementing serological data which are often difficult to interpret.

Living plants preferentially incorporate atmospheric 14CO2, vs 13CO2, vs 12CO2, which result in unique signature. Furthermore, plants and the food chains they support also have unique carbon isotope signatures. Humans, at the top of the food chain, consequently acquire isotopic concentrations in the tissues and body fluids depending on their dietary habits. In preparation of ADME and PBPK studies, 12 healthy subjects were recruited. The human baseline (specific to each individual and their diet) total carbon (TC) and carbon isotope 13C (Î´13C) and 14C (Fm) were quantified in whole blood (WB), plasma, washed red blood cell (RBC), urine, and feces. TC (mg of C/100Î¼L) in WB, plasma, RBC, urine, and feces were 11.0, 4.37, 7.57, 0.53, and 1.90, respectively. TC in WB, RBC, and feces was higher in men over women, P < 0.05. Mean Î´13C were ranked low to high as follows, feces < WB = plasma = RBC = urine, P < 0.0001. Î´13C was not affected by gender. Our analytic method shifted Î´13C by only Â± 1.0 â° ensuring our Fm measurements were accurate and precise. Mean Fm were ranked low to high as follows, plasma = urine < WB = RBC = feces, P < 0.05. Fm in feces was higher for men over women, P < 0.05. Only in WB, 14C levels (Fm) and TC were correlated with one another (r = 0.746, P < 0.01). Considering the lag time to incorporate atmospheric 14C into plant foods (vegetarian) and or then into animal foods (non-vegetarian), the measured Fm of WB in our population (recruited April 2009) was 1.0468 Â± 0.0022 (meanÂ±SD), the Fm of WB matched the (extrapolated) atmospheric Fm of 1.0477 in 2008. This study is important in presenting a procedure to determine a baseline for a study group for human ADME and PBPK studies using 14C as a tracer.

An LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of D3G and C3G in human plasma and urine was developed and validated. After sample preparation by SPE, chromatographic separation was performed with an RP-C(18) column, using a water/methanol linear gradient. The quantitation of target compounds was determined by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, using ESI. The method showed good selectivity, sensitivity (LOD = 0.05 and 0.10 ng/mL for C3G in plasma and urine, respectively; LOD = 0.10 ng/mL for D3G in plasma and urine), linearity (0.20-200 ng/mL; r >or= 0.998), intra- and interday precision and accuracy (plasma and urine. Stability of analytes in plasma and urine has been investigated in detail. This method was successfully applied to the determination of D3G, C3G and CMG levels in human plasma and urine after the ingestion of a single dose (500 mL) of blood orange juice.\n\nBarium determination in gastric contents, blood and urine by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in the case of oral barium chloride poisoning.\n\nPubMed\n\nÅukasik-GÅÄbocka, Magdalena; Sommerfeld, Karina; HanÄ, Anetta; Grzegorowski, Adam; BaraÅkiewicz, Danuta; Gaca, MichaÅ; ZieliÅska-Psuja, Barbara\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA serious case of barium intoxication from suicidal ingestion is reported. Oral barium chloride poisoning with hypokalemia, neuromuscular and cardiac toxicity, treated with intravenous potassium supplementation and hemodialysis, was confirmed by the determination of barium concentrations in gastric contents, blood, serum and urine using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method. Barium concentrations in the analyzed specimens were 20.45 Âµg/L in serum, 150 Âµg/L in blood, 10,500 Âµg/L in urine and 63,500 Âµg/L in gastric contents. Results were compared with barium levels obtained from a non-intoxicated person. Â© The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

S. L.; Tam, V.; Putcha, L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAn intranasal gel formulation of scopolamine (INSCOP) was developed for the treatment of Space Motion Sickness. The bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (PK) were evaluated under the Food and Drug Administration guidelines for clinical trials for an Investigative New Drug (IND). The aim of this project was to develop a PK model that can predict the relationship between plasma, saliva and urinary scopolamine concentrations using data collected from the IND clinical trial with INSCOP. METHODS: Twelve healthy human subjects were administered three dose levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg) of INSCOP. Serial blood, saliva and urine samples were collected between 5 min to 24 h after dosing and scopolamine concentrations measured by using a validated LC-MS-MS assay. Pharmacokinetic Compartmental models, using actual dosing and sampling times, were built using Phoenix (version 1.2). Model discrimination was performed, by minimizing the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), maximizing the coefficient of determination (rÂ²) and by comparison of the quality of fit plots. RESULTS: The best structural model to describe scopolamine disposition after INSCOP administration (minimal AIC =907.2) consisted of one compartment for plasma, saliva and urine respectively that were inter-connected with different rate constants. The estimated values of PK parameters were compiled in Table 1. The model fitting exercises revealed a nonlinear PK for scopolamine between plasma and saliva compartments for K21, Vmax and Km. CONCLUSION: PK model for INSCOP was developed and for the first time it satisfactorily predicted the PK of scopolamine in plasma, saliva and urine after INSCOP administration. Using non-linear PK yielded the best structural model to describe scopolamine disposition between plasma and saliva compartments, and inclusion of non-linear PK resulted in a significant improved model fitting. The model can be utilized to predict scopolamine plasma concentration using saliva and/or urine data that\n\nPharmacokinetic Modeling of Intranasal Scopolamine in Plasma Saliva and Urine\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWu, L.; Tam, V. H.; Chow, D. S. L.; Putcha, L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAn intranasal gel dosage formulation of scopolamine (INSCOP) was developed for the treatment of Space Motion Sickness (SMS). The bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (PK) were evaluated under IND (Investigational New Drug) guidelines. The aim of the project was to develop a PK model that can predict the relationships among plasma, saliva and urinary scopolamine concentrations using data collected from the IND clinical trial protocol with INSCOP. Twelve healthy human subjects were administered at three dose levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg) of INSCOP. Serial blood, saliva and urine samples were collected between 5 min to 24 h after dosing and scopolamine concentrations were measured by using a validated LC-MS-MS assay. PK compartmental models, using actual dosing and sampling time, were established using Phoenix (version 1.2). Model selection was based on a likelihood ratio test on the difference of criteria (-2LL (i.e. log-likelihood ratio test)) and comparison of the quality of fit plots. The results: Predictable correlations among scopolamine concentrations in compartments of plasma, saliva and urine were established, and for the first time the model satisfactorily predicted the population and individual PK of INSCOP in plasma, saliva and urine. The model can be utilized to predict the INSCOP plasma concentration by saliva and urine data, and it will be useful for monitoring the PK of scopolamine in space and other remote environments using non-invasive sampling of saliva and/or urine.\n\nPlasma and urine levels of electrolytes, urea and steroid hormones involved in osmoregulation of cetaceans.\n\nPubMed\n\nBirukawa, Naoko; Ando, Hironori; Goto, Mutsuo; Kanda, Naohisa; Pastene, Luis A; Nakatsuji, Hiroki; Hata, Hiroshi; Urano, Akihisa\n\n2005-11-01\n\nCetaceans are well adapted to their hyperosmotic environment by properly developed osmoregulatory ability. A question here is how they regulate water and mineral balances in marine habitats. In the present study, we determined blood and urine levels of various chemicals involved in osmoregulation, compared them with those in artiodactyls, and characterized the values in the whales. Blood and urine samples obtained from baleen whales of common minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), sei (B. borealis), and Bryde's whales (B. brydei), and toothed whales of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) were analyzed for osmolality, major electrolytes, urea, steroid hormones and glucose. The urine osmolality and Na(+) concentrations in the cetaceans were much higher than those in the cattle. Furthermore, the cetaceans had 5 to 11-fold urea in plasma than the cattle, and 2 to 4-fold urea in urine. There were no significant difference in the plasma concentrations of corticosteroids between the cetaceans and the cattle. The present results indicate that the osmoregulatory parameters seem to be not affected by the reproductive stage and sex steroid hormones. The concentrations of urea in plasma and urine of the baleen whales were higher than those of the sperm whales, indicating a possibility that their osmoregulatory mechanisms may be correlated to their feeding habits. The present results suggest that cetaceans have unique osmoregulatory mechanisms by which they excrete strongly hypertonic urine to maintain fluid homeostasis in marine habitats.\n\nBlood-urine barrier formation in mouse urinary bladder development.\n\nPubMed\n\nJezernik, K; Pipan, N\n\n1993-04-01\n\nFormation of the blood-urine permeability barrier in differentiating mouse transitional urothelium was studied. It was established that the development of superficial cell barrier is a two-phase process: beginning with formation of the tight junctions, followed by formation of fusiform vesicles and asymmetric apical plasma membranes. Fusiform vesicles differentiate during days 15 and 17 of gestation and fuse with the apical plasmalemma. Thus a thick membrane is formed before the excretion of hypertonic urine into the embryonic bladder. Through some degenerative superficial cells slough between fetal day 17 and the day of birth, the bladder epithelium in mice does not lack an effective permeability barrier.\n\nFabric phase sorptive extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-photo diode array detection method for simultaneous monitoring of three inflammatory bowel disease treatment drugs in whole blood, plasma and urine.\n\nPubMed\n\nKabir, Abuzar; Furton, Kenneth G; Tinari, Nicola; Grossi, Laurino; Innosa, Denise; Macerola, Daniela; Tartaglia, Angela; Di Donato, Valentina; D'Ovidio, Cristian; Locatelli, Marcello\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis paper reports a novel fabric phase sorptive extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (FPSE-HPLC-PDA) method for the simultaneous extraction and analysis of three drug residues (ciprofloxacin, sulfasalazine, and cortisone) in human whole blood, plasma, and urine samples, generally administered in human patients to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The drugs of interest were well resolved using a Luna C 18 column (250â¯mmâ¯Ãâ¯4.6â¯mm; 5â¯Î¼m particle size) in gradient elution mode within 20â¯min. The analytical method was optimized and validated in the range 0.05-10â¯Î¼g/mL for whole blood, 0.25-10â¯Î¼g/mL for human plasma, and 0.10-10â¯Î¼g/mL for human urine. Blank human whole blood, plasma, and urine were used as the sample matrix for the method development and validation; while methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate was used as the internal standard (IS). Weighted-matrix matched standard calibration curves showed a good linearity up to a concentration of 10â¯Î¼g/mL. The intra- and inter-day accuracy values (precision and trueness) were found in the range from -10.9% to 12.3%, and the performances of the validated FPSE-HPLC-PDA were further tested on real IBD patient samples. This is the first FPSE procedure applied simultaneously to whole blood, plasma, and urine samples for the determination of residual IBD drugs, which possess a wide range of polarity (logP values ranging from 2.30 for Ciprofloxacin, to 1.66 for Cortisone, and 2.92 for Sulfasalazine). The new approach exhibits high potential for immediate adoptation as a rapid, robust and green analytical tool for future clinical and pharmaceutical applications. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Studies on the fate of a particular dose of creatine require that the creatine be labeled, and for studies in humans the use of a stable isotopic label is desirable. The concentrations of total creatine and total creatinine were determined using HPLC. Creatine and creatinine were then separated using cation exchange chromatography and each fraction was derivatized with trifluoroacetic anhydride and the ratio of the deuterated:undeuterated species determined using GC-MS. Ratios of creatine:creatine-d(3), and creatinine:creatinine-d(3), and the concentrations of each of these species, were able to be determined in urine, plasma and red blood cells. Thus, the uptake of labeled creatine into plasma and red blood cells and its excretion in urine could be followed for a subject who ingested creatine-d(3). Creatine-d(3) was found in the plasma and red blood cells 10 min after ingestion, while creatine-d(3) and creatinine-d(3) were found in the urine collected after the first hour.\n\nPlasma chemistry and urine analysis in Salmonella-induced polyuria in racing pigeons (Columba livia).\n\nPubMed\n\nGevaert, D; Nelis, J; Verhaeghe, B\n\n1991-09-01\n\nPolyuria-polydipsia is a frequent observation in pigeons with salmonellosis. These are accompanied by a decreased albumin/globulin ratio, increased creatinine and haptoglobin concentrations, and decrease in the chloride concentration in the blood plasma. The urine was found to have a low density with red and white blood cells frequently present in the sediment. A water deprivation test was conducted on three animals: polyuria disappeared and plasma urea increased significantly.\n\nStandard operating procedures for pre-analytical handling of blood and urine for metabolomic studies and biobanks.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernini, Patrizia; Bertini, Ivano; Luchinat, Claudio; Nincheri, Paola; Staderini, Samuele; Turano, Paola\n\n2011-04-01\n\n(1)H NMR metabolic profiling of urine, serum and plasma has been used to monitor the impact of the pre-analytical steps on the sample quality and stability in order to propose standard operating procedures (SOPs) for deposition in biobanks. We analyzed the quality of serum and plasma samples as a function of the elapsed time (tÂ =Â 0-4Â h) between blood collection and processing and of the time from processing to freezing (up to 24Â h). The stability of the urine metabolic profile over time (up to 24Â h) at various storage temperatures was monitored as a function of the different pre-analytical treatments like pre-storage centrifugation, filtration, and addition of the bacteriostatic preservative sodium azide. Appreciable changes in the profiles, reflecting changes in the concentration of a number of metabolites, were detected and discussed in terms of chemical and enzymatic reactions for both blood and urine samples. Appropriate procedures for blood derivatives collection and urine preservation/storage that allow maintaining as much as possible the original metabolic profile of the fresh samples emerge, and are proposed as SOPs for biobanking.\n\n[Analysis of Arsenic Compounds in Blood and Urine by HPLC-ICP-MS].\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, L; Zhang, S J; Xu, W C; Luo, R X; Ma, D; Shen, M\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTo establish an analysis method for the detection of 6 arsenic compounds [AsC, AsB, Asï¼â ¢ï¼, DMA, MMA and Asï¼Vï¼] in blood and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry ï¼HPLC-ICP-MSï¼, and apply it to real cases. Triton was used to damage cells, and then EDTAÂ·2NaÂ·2H2O was used to complex arsenic compounds in cells, and sonication and protein deposition by acetonitrile were performed for sample pretreatment. With the mobile phase consisted of ammonium carbonate and ultrapure water, gradient elution was performed for obtaining the arsenic compounds in samples, which were analysed by ICP-MS with Hamilton PRP-X100 column. The limits of detection in blood were 1.66-10 ng/mL, while the lower limits of quantitation in blood ranged from 5 to 30 ng/mL. The limits of detection in urine were 0.5-10 ng/mL, while the lower limits of quantitation in urine were 5-30 ng/mL. The relative standard deviation of inter-day and intra-day precisions was less than 10%. This method had been successfully applied to 3 cases. This study has established an analysis method for detecting 6 common arsenic compounds in blood and urine, which can be used to detect the arsenic compounds in the blood and urine from arsenic poisoning cases as well as the patients under arsenic treatment.

The quantification of metals was based on the 1+4 water dilution of CSF, serum and urine, the acid-assisted microwave digestion under atmospheric pressure of blood and final determination by sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS). Results indicated a significant increase of Pb and V concentrations in blood and urine ( Pâ¤0.03, in both cases) related to the disease. Parkinson disease also seemed to be closely associated ( Pâ¤0.003) with a reduction in levels of Al, Cd, Hg and Pb in serum and of Cd, Co, Cr, Hg, Pb in CSF. As regards Mn, a lower mean concentration was found in the CSF and whole blood of PD patients than in control group, although this trend was not statistically significant. Levels of peroxides were also increased ( Pâ¤0.001), while antioxidant capacity was lower ( Pâ¤0.002) in PD patients than in controls.\n\nBlood in the Urine (Hematuria) (For Parents)\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... weeks later, just to make sure the urine is free of red blood cells.

This paper presents a reliable, sensitive method for the determination of Ba in blood and urine: inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) after microwave digestion of samples. The overall procedure was checked using Seronorm Whole Blood L-2, Trace Elements Urine and spiked blood and urine samples (0.5-10 Âµg/mL of Ba). The accuracy of the whole procedure (relative error) was 4% (blood) and 7% (urine); the recovery was 76-104% (blood) and 85-101% (urine). The limits of detection and quantification (Ba Î» = 455.403 nm) were 0.11 and 0.4 Âµg/L of Ba, respectively; precision (relative standard deviation) was below 6% at the level of 15 Âµg/L of Ba for blood. This method was applied to a case of the poisoning of a man who had been exposed at the workplace for over two years to powdered BaCO3, and who suffered from paralysis and heart disorders. The concentrations of Ba, in Î¼g/L, were 160 (blood), 460 (serum) and 1,458 (urine) upon his admission to the hospital, and 6.1 (blood) and 4.9 (urine) after 11 months (reference values: 3.34 Â± 2.20 Âµg/L of Ba for blood and 4.43 Â± 4.60 Âµg/L of Ba for urine).\n\nDynamics of L-Carnitine in Plasma and Urine in Patients Undergoing Cisplatin Chemotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nGomi, Daisuke; Tanaka, Aika; Fukushima, Toshirou; Kobayashi, Takashi; Matsushita, Hirohide; Sekiguchi, Nodoka; Sakamoto, Akiyuki; Sasaki, Shigeru; Mamiya, Keiko; Koizumi, Tomonobu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSeveral studies have indicated that cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II; CDDP) causes urinary excretion of L-carnitine (LC). However, the underlying cofactors affecting the increased urinary excretion remain unclear. The present study was performed to evaluate the dynamics of LC in plasma and urine after CDDP chemotherapy and to examine the relations with clinical parameters, such as gender, body mass index (BMI), and renal function. Twenty-two patients treated with CDDP therapy were selected. Blood and urine samples were taken from patients before starting CDDP treatment (day 0), on the next day (day 1), and on the seventh day (day 7). We measured plasma and urine concentrations of total, free, and acyl-LC, and examined the relationships with gender, age, treatment cycle, skeletal muscle mass, BMI, glomerular filtration rate, and change in creatinine concentration after CDDP administration. Both urinary and plasma concentrations of 3 types of LC increased markedly on day 1 and subsequently reverted to the pre-CDDP level on day 7. There was a positive correlation between the % changes in plasma and urine LC (correlation coefficient 0.59, p = 0.003) on day 1, but no significant relations were seen in other clinical parameters. CDDP transiently increased plasma LC levels. The mechanism seemed to involve recruitment for marked urinary loss of LC. However, these changes in plasma and urinary LC levels were not related to clinical factors, suggesting that the dynamics of LC were independent of preexisting physical parameters. Â© 2017 S.

Evaluation of a Low Plasma Bicarbonate Using the Urine Anion Gap.\n\nPubMed\n\nBatlle, Daniel; Chin-Theodorou, Jamie; Tucker, Bryan M\n\n2017-09-01\n\nHypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

At the point of maximum efficiency, plasma free metanephrines showed 100% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity, compared with plasma catecholamines (78.6% and 70.7%), urine catecholamines (78.6% and 87.8%), urine metanephrines (85.7% and 95.1%), and urine hydroxymethoxymandelic acid (HMMA or VMA) (93.0% and 75.8%). All patients with phaeochromocytoma had plasma free metanephrine concentrations at least 27% above the upper limit of the reference range. Only three other patients (two on haemodialysis and one in ICU) had PFM concentrations more than 50% above the upper limit of the reference range. In patients with phaeochromocytoma, plasma free metanephrines displayed superior diagnostic sensitivity and specificity compared with other biochemical markers of catecholamine output and metabolism.\n\nInterlaboratory trial for the measurement of total cobalt in equine urine and plasma by ICP-MS.\n\nPubMed\n\nPopot, Marie-Agnes; Ho, Emmie N M; Stojiljkovic, Natali; Bagilet, Florian; Remy, Pierre; Maciejewski, Pascal; Loup, Benoit; Chan, George H M; Hargrave, Sabine; Arthur, Rick M; Russo, Charlie; White, James; Hincks, Pamela; Pearce, Clive; Ganio, George; Zahra, Paul; Batty, David; Jarrett, Mark; Brooks, Lydia; Prescott, Lise-Anne; Bailly-Chouriberry, Ludovic; Bonnaire, Yves; Wan, Terence S M\n\n2017-09-01\n\nCobalt is an essential mineral micronutrient and is regularly present in equine nutritional and feed supplements. Therefore, cobalt is naturally present at low concentrations in biological samples. The administration of cobalt chloride is considered to be blood doping and is thus prohibited. To control the misuse of cobalt, it was mandatory to establish an international threshold for cobalt in plasma and/or in urine. To achieve this goal, an international collaboration, consisting of an interlaboratory comparison between 5 laboratories for the urine study and 8 laboratories for the plasma study, has been undertaken. Quantification of cobalt in the biological samples was performed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Ring tests were based on the analysis of 5 urine samples supplemented at concentrations ranging from 5 up to 500Â ng/mL and 5 plasma samples spiked at concentrations ranging from 0.5 up to 25Â ng/mL. The results obtained from the different laboratories were collected, compiled, and compared to assess the reproducibility and robustness of cobalt quantification measurements. The statistical approach for the ring test for total cobalt in urine was based on the determination of percentage deviations from the calculated means, while robust statistics based on the calculated median were applied to the ring test for total cobalt in plasma. The inter-laboratory comparisons in urine and in plasma were successful so that 97.6% of the urine samples and 97.5% of the plasma samples gave satisfactory results. Threshold values for cobalt in plasma and urine were established from data only obtained by laboratories involved in the ring test. Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AICAR has attracted considerable attention recently in the field of doping control because of a study showing the enhancement of endurance performance in unexercised or untrained mice, resulting in the term 'exercise pill'. Its use has been classified as gene doping by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and since it is endogenous, it may only be possible to control deliberate administration of AICAR to racehorses after establishment of an appropriate threshold. Herein we report our studies of AICAR in post-race equine urine and plasma samples including statistical studies of AICAR concentrations determined from 1,470 urine samples collected from thoroughbreds and standardbreds and analyzed in Australia, France, and Hong Kong. Quantification methods in equine urine and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were developed by the laboratories in each country. An exchange of spiked urine and plasma samples between the three countries was conducted, confirming no significant differences in the methods. However, the concentration of AICAR in plasma was found to increase upon haemolysis of whole blood samples, impeding the establishment of a suitable threshold in equine plasma. A possible urine screening cut-off at 600Â ng/mL for the control of AICAR in racehorses could be considered for adoption. Application of the proposed screening cut-off to urine samples collected after intravenous administration of a small dose (2Â g) of AICAR to a mare yielded a short detection time of approximately 4.5Â h.

This study therefore directly compared the performance of AKI biomarkers in urine and plasma. Methods This single-center, prospective cohort study included 110 unselected adults undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass between 2009 and 2010. Plasma and/or urine concentrations of creatinine, cystatin C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM1), and albumin as well as 15 additional biomarkers in plasma and urine were measured during the perioperative period. The primary outcome was AKI defined by AKIN serum creatinine criteria within 72 hours after surgery. Results Biomarkers in plasma showed markedly better discriminative performance for preoperative risk stratification and early postoperative (within 24h after surgery) detection of AKI than urine biomarkers. Discriminative power of urine biomarkers improved when concentrations were normalized to urinary creatinine, but urine biomarkers had still lower AUC values than plasma biomarkers. Best diagnostic performance 4h after surgery had plasma NGAL (AUC 0.83), cystatin C (0.76), MIG (0.74), and L-FAPB (0.73). Combinations of multiple biomarkers did not improve their diagnostic power. Preoperative clinical scoring systems (EuroSCORE and Cleveland Clinic Foundation Score) predicted the risk for AKI (AUC 0.76 and 0.71) and were not inferior to biomarkers. Preexisting chronic kidney disease limited the diagnostic performance of both plasma and urine biomarkers. Conclusions In our cohort plasma biomarkers had higher discriminative power for risk stratification and early diagnosis of AKI than urine biomarkers. For preoperative risk stratification of AKI clinical models showed\n\nProfile and Content of Betalains in Plasma and Urine of Volunteers after Long-Term Exposure to Fermented Red Beet Juice.\n\nPubMed\n\nSawicki, Tomasz; Topolska, Joanna; Romaszko, Ewa; Wiczkowski, WiesÅaw\n\n2018-04-25\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine profile and content of betalains in volunteers' plasma and urine after long-term exposure to fermented red beet juice. During 6 weeks, 24 healthy volunteers consumed juice with a dose of 0.7 mg betalains/kg body weight. Betalains were analyzed by means of micro-HPLC-MS/MS. Twelve betalain derivatives were found in blood plasma and urine after juice intake. The highest betalains level in blood plasma (87.65 Â± 15.71 nmol/L) and urine (1.14 Â± 0.12 Î¼mol) was found after the first and second week of juice intake, respectively. During juice consumption, the contribution of betalain metabolites was higher than that of native betalains, and interindividual variability in profile and content of betalains was observed. Summarizing, it was observed that long-term and regular consumption of the juice causes stabilization of profile and content of betalains in physiological fluids of volunteers, which include native compounds and their decarboxylated and dehydrogenated metabolites.\n\nDetection of recombinant EPO in blood and urine samples with EPO WGA MAIIA, IEF and SAR-PAGE after microdose injections.\n\nPubMed\n\nDehnes, Yvette; Shalina, Alexandra; Myrvold, Linda\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe misuse of microdoses of performance enhancing drugs like erythropoietin (EPO) constitutes a major challenge in doping analysis. When injected intravenously, the half-life of recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) like epoetin alfa, beta, and zeta is only a few hours and hence, the window for direct detection of rhEPO in urine is small. In order to investigate the detection window for rhEPO directly in blood and urine with a combined affinity chromatography and lateral flow immunoassay (EPO WGA MAIIA), we recruited nine healthy people who each received six intravenously injected microdoses (7.5âIU/kg) of NeoRecormon (epoetin beta) over a period of three weeks. Blood and urine samples were collected in the days following the injections and analyzed with EPO WGA MAIIA as well as the current validated methods for rhEPO; isoelectric focusing (IEF) and sarcosyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SAR-PAGE). For samples collected 18âh after a microdose, the sensitivity of the EPO WGA MAIIA assay was 100% in plasma and 87.5% in urine samples at the respective 98% specificity threshold levels. In comparison, the sensitivity in plasma and urine was 75% and 100%, respectively, with IEF, and 87.5% in plasma and 100% in urine when analyzed with SAR-PAGE. We conclude that EPO WGA MAIIA is a sensitive assay for the detection of rhEPO, with the potential of being a fast, supplemental screening assay for use in doping analysis.\n\nD-Dimer and prothrombin fragment 1â+â2 in urine and plasma in patients with clinically suspected venous thromboembolism.\n\nPubMed\n\nWexels, Fredrik; Seljeflot, IngebjÃ¸rg; Pripp, Are H; Dahl, Ola E\n\n2016-06-01\n\nIncreased levels of urine prothrombin fragment 1â+â2 was recently reported to be associated with imaging-verified venous thromboembolism. In this study we evaluated the relationship between plasma D-dimer and plasma and urine prothrombin fragment 1â+â2 in patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. Urine and blood samples were collected from patients with suspected pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. The samples were analysed with commercially available ELISA kits. The diagnosis of venous thromboembolism was verified with contrast-enhanced computer tomography of the pulmonary arteries or lower extremity deep vein compression ultrasound and venography as appropriate. Venous thromboembolism was diagnosed in 150 of 720 patients. Significantly higher levels of plasma D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1â+â2 in plasma and urine were found in those with imaging-confirmed venous thromboembolism versus those without (Pâ<â0.001). The correlation between the three biomarkers was statistically significant (range of rs values 0.45-0.65, Pâ<â0.001). Plasma D-dimer had the highest diagnostic accuracy followed by prothrombin fragment 1â+â2 in plasma. Further development of ELISA analyses for urine testing of prothrombin fragment 1â+â2 may improve its diagnostic accuracy.\n\nCapillary electrophoresis coupled with chloroform-acetonitrile extraction for rapid and highly selective determination of cysteine and homocysteine levels in human blood plasma and urine.\n\nPubMed\n\nIvanov, Alexander Vladimirovich; Bulgakova, Polina Olegovna; Virus, Edward Danielevich; Kruglova, Maria Petrovna; Alexandrin, Valery Vasil'evich; Gadieva, Viktoriya Aleksandrovna; Luzyanin, Boris Petrovich; Kushlinskii, Nikolai Evgen'evich; Fedoseev, Anatolij Nikolaevich; Kubatiev, Aslan Amirkhanovich\n\n2017-10-01\n\nA rapid and selective method has been developed for highly sensitive determination of total cysteine and homocysteine levels in human blood plasma and urine by capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled with liquid-liquid extraction. Analytes were first derivatized with 1,1'-thiocarbonyldiimidazole and then samples were purified by chloroform-ACN extraction. Electrophoretic separation was performed using 0.1Â M phosphate with 30Â mM triethanolamine, pH 2, containing 25Â Î¼M CTAB, 2.5Â Î¼M SDS, and 2.5% polyethylene glycol 600. Samples were injected into the capillary (with total length 32Â cm and 50Â Î¼m id) at 2250Â mbar*s and subsequent injection was performed for 30Â s with 0.5Â M KÐÐ. The total analysis time was less than 9Â min, accuracy was 98%, and precision was <2.6%. The LOD was 0.2Â Î¼M for homocysteine and 0.5Â Î¼M for cysteine. The use of liquid-liquid extraction allowed the precision and sensitivity of the CE method to be significantly increased. The validated method was applied to determine total cysteine and homocysteine content in human blood plasma and urine samples obtained from healthy volunteers and patients with kidney disorders.

The state-of-the-art ICP-MS instruments analyze metals in laboratories, resulting in lengthy turn around time, and are expensive. In response to the growing need for metal analyzer for on-site, real-time monitoring of trace metals in individuals, we developed a portable microanalyzer based on flow-injection/adsorptive stripping voltammetry and used it to analyze Pb in rat blood and urine. Fouling of electrodes by proteins often prevents the effective use of electrochemical sensors in biological matrices. Minimization of such fouling was accomplished with the suitablemoreÂ Â» sample pretreatment and the turbulent flowing of Pb contained blood and urine onto the glassy electrode inside the microanalyzer, which resulted in no apparent electrode fouling even when the samples contained 50% urine or 10% blood by volume. There was no matrix effect on the voltammetric Pb signals even when the samples contained 10% blood or 10% urine. The microanalyzer offered linear concentration range relevant to Pb exposure levels in human (0-20 ppb in 10%-blood samples, 0-50 ppb in 50%-urine samples). The device had excellent sensitivity and reproducibility; Pb detection limits were 0.54 ppb and 0.42 ppb, and % RSDs were 4.9 and 2.4 in 50%-urine and 10%-blood samples, respectively. It offered a high throughput (3 min per sample) and had economical use of samples (60 ?L per measurement), making the collection of blood being less invasive especially to children, and had low reagent consumption (1 ?g of Hg per measurement), thus minimizing the health concerns of mercury use. Being miniaturized in size, the microanalyzer is portable and field-deployable. Thus, it has a great potential to be the next-generation analyzer for biomonitoring of toxic metals.Â«Â less\n\nStress-induced changes in corticosteroid metabolism.

The 33 elements in 272 blood and 300 urine samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The normality test of data was conducted using SPSS 17.0 Statistics. The data was compared with other reports. The normal reference values of the 33 elements in the blood and urine samples from the general population in Sanmen County were obtained, which of some elements were found to be similar with other reports, such as Co, Cu, Mn and Sr, while As, Cd, Hg and Pb were generally found to be higher than those previously reported. There was a wide variation between the reports from different countries in blood Ba. The normal reference values of the 33 elements in the blood and urine samples from the general population in Sanmen County are established, and successfully applied to two poisoning cases.\n\nComparison of Urine and Plasma Peptidome Indicates Selectivity in Renal Peptide Handling.\n\nPubMed\n\nMagalhÃ£es, Pedro; Pontillo, Claudia; Pejchinovski, Martin; Siwy, Justyna; Krochmal, Magdalena; Makridakis, Manousos; Carrick, Emma; Klein, Julie; Mullen, William; Jankowski, Joachim; Vlahou, Antonia; Mischak, Harald; Schanstra, Joost P; ZÃ¼rbig, Petra; Pape, Lars\n\n2018-04-03\n\nUrine is considered to be produced predominantly as a result of plasma filtration in the kidney. However, the origin of the native peptides present in urine has never been investigated in detail. Therefore, the authors aimed to obtain a first insight into the origin of urinary peptides based on a side-by-side comprehensive analysis of the plasma and urine peptidome. Twenty-two matched urine and plasma samples are analyzed for their peptidome using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS; for relative quantification) and CE or LC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (CE- or LC-MS/MS; for peptide identification). The overlap and association of abundance of the different peptides present in these two body fluids are evaluated. The authors are able to identify 561 plasma and 1461 urinary endogenous peptides. Only 90 peptides are detectable in both urine and plasma. No significant correlation is found when comparing the abundance of these common peptides, with the exception of collagen fragments. This observation is also supported when comparing published peptidome data from both plasma and urine. Most of the plasma peptides are not detectable in urine, possibly due to tubular reabsorption. The majority of urinary peptides may in fact originate in the kidney. The notable exception is collagen fragments, which indicates potential selective exclusion of these peptides from tubular reabsorption. Experimental verification of this hypothesis is warranted.

There is great individual variation in both components, and evidence of changes in metabolism during the early weeks. 4 Urinary excretion may be influenced by pH, but between pH 6.0-7.0 about 1% of the daily dose appears in 24 h urine as the following: free thioridazine in microng quantities, M/S and ring sulphoxide each in mg amounts. 5 Patients attain steady state conditions, although plasma levels rise considerably after each dose and settle again in about 10 h. After chronic treatment is stopped to half-life is at about 30 h. 6 Plasma levels cannot be related to therapeutic response when this is slow, as in schizophrenia, but interpretations are complicated by the production of clinically active metabolites, and by plasma protein binding.

A total of 18 120 subjects aged 6~60 years were enrolled from 24 regions in 8 provinces in Eastern, Central, and Western China from 2009 to 2010 based on the method of cluster random sampling. Questionnaire survey was conducted to collect the data on living environment and health status. Blood and urine samples were collected from these subjects, and the levels of Rb, Cs, Be, Sr, and Ba in these samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The distribution of these elements in blood and urine in male or female subjects living in different regions was analyzed statistically. In the general Chinese population, the concentration of Be in the whole blood was below the detection limit (0.06 Î¼g/L); the geometric mean (GM) of Ba in the whole blood was below the detection limit (0.45 Î¼g/L), with the 95th percentile (P95)of 1.37 Î¼g/L; the GMs (95% CI)of Rb, Cs, and Sr in the whole blood were 2 374(2 357~2 392) Î¼g/L, 2.01 (1.98~2.05) Î¼g/L, and 23.5 (23.3~23.7) Î¼g/L, respectively; in males and females, the GMs (95%CI)of blood Rb, Cs, and Sr were 2 506 (2 478~2 533) Î¼g/L and 2 248 (2 227~2 270) Î¼g/L, 1.88 (1.83~1.94) Î¼g/L and 2.16 (2.11~2.20) Î¼g/L, and 23.4 (23.1~23.7) Î¼g/L and 23.6 (23.3~23.9) Î¼g/L, respectively(P<0.01, P>0.05, and P>0.05). In the general Chinese population, the GM of urine Be was below the detection limit (0.06 Î¼g/L), while the GMs (95%CI)of urine Rb, Cs, Sr, and Ba were 854 (836~873) Î¼g/L, 3.65 (3.56~3.74) Î¼g/L, 39.5 (38.4~40.6) Î¼g/L, and 1.10 (1.07~1.12) Î¼g/L, respectively; in males and females, the GMs (95%CI)of urine Rb, Cs, Sr, and Ba were 876 (849~904) Î¼g/L and 832 (807~858) Î¼g/L, 3.83 (3.70~3.96) Î¼g/L and 3.47 (3.35~3.60) Î¼g/L, 42.5 (40.9~44.2) Î¼g/L and 36.6 (35.1~38.0) Î¼g/L, and 1.15 (1.12~1.19) Î¼g/L and 1.04 (1.01~1.07) Î¼g/L, respectively\n\nEffect of 14 days of bed rest on urine metabolite excretion and plasma enzyme levels\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPace, N.; Grunbaum, B. W.; Kodama, A. M.; Rahlmann, D. F.; Newsom, B. D.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nAfter 1 week of ambulatory base-line measurement, a group of 8 men 19-26 years of age remained continuously recumbent for 14 days. Studies were continued for 1 week following the prolonged recumbency. Urine excretion rates for a number of constituents were determined 2 days before bed rest, on day 14 of bed rest, and day 6 after bed rest. Blood plasma samples were also obtained at these times, and analyzed for several enzymes. On day 14 of bed rest significant increases were observed in urine excretion of total osmotically-active substances, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, creatinine, hydroxyproline, and 17-OH corticosteroids. A decrease occurred in urinary glucose excretion. Plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase and LDH-3 were depressed, while plasma GPT was elevated. Many of these changes persisted on day 6 after bed rest, and are interpreted as concomitants of the disuse atrophy of the musculoskeletal system that characterizes prolonged bed rest and weightlessness.\n\nA method for estimating radioactive cesium concentrations in cattle blood using urine samples.\n\nPubMed\n\nSato, Itaru; Yamagishi, Ryoma; Sasaki, Jun; Satoh, Hiroshi; Miura, Kiyoshi; Kikuchi, Kaoru; Otani, Kumiko; Okada, Keiji\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn the region contaminated by the Fukushima nuclear accident, radioactive contamination of live cattle should be checked before slaughter. In this study, we establish a precise method for estimating radioactive cesium concentrations in cattle blood using urine samples. Blood and urine samples were collected from a total of 71 cattle on two farms in the 'difficult-to-return zone'. Urine 137 Cs, specific gravity, electrical conductivity, pH, sodium, potassium, calcium, and creatinine were measured and various estimation methods for blood 137 Cs were tested. The average error rate of the estimation was 54.2% without correction. Correcting for urine creatinine, specific gravity, electrical conductivity, or potassium improved the precision of the estimation. Correcting for specific gravity using the following formula gave the most precise estimate (average error rateÂ =Â 16.9%): [blood 137 Cs]Â =Â [urinary 137 Cs]/([specific gravity]Â -Â 1)/329. Urine samples are faster to measure than blood samples because urine can be obtained in larger quantities and has a higher 137 Cs concentration than blood. These advantages of urine and the estimation precision demonstrated in our study, indicate that estimation of blood 137 Cs using urine samples is a practical means of monitoring radioactive contamination in live cattle.

After aliquoting plasma and urine samples, and adding internal standard (IS) manually, the robot executed buffer and organic solvent addition, liquid-liquid extraction, solvent evaporation and on-line LC injection steps for plasma samples, whereas, BenchMate performed buffer and organic solvent addition, liquid-liquid and solid-phase extractions, and on-line LC injection steps for urine samples. Chromatographic separations were carried out on Beckman Octyl Ultrasphere column using the mobile phase composed of 12% (v/v) acetonitrile and 88% of either an ion-pairing reagent (plasma) or 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (urine). The eluent from the column was monitored with UV detector (271 nm). Peak heights for HCTZ and IS were automatically processed using a PE-Nelson ACCESS*CHROM laboratory automation system. The assays have been validated in the concentration range of 2-100 ng ml-1 in plasma and 0.1-20 micrograms ml-1 in urine. Both plasma and urine assays have the sensitivity and specificity necessary to determine plasma and urine concentrations of HCTZ from low dose (6.25/12.5 mg) administration of HCTZ to human subjects in the presence or absence of losartan.\n\nDevelopment of the Abbott RealTime ZIKA assay for the qualitative detection of Zika virus RNA from serum, plasma, urine, and whole blood specimens using the m2000 system.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrankel, Matthew B; Pandya, Kinnari; Gersch, Jeffrey; Siddiqui, Sarah; Schneider, George J\n\n2017-08-01\n\nZika virus is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that has rapidly developed into a world-wide concern. Discovered in 1947, the virus was relatively obscure until an outbreak occurred in 2007 in the Yap islands and spread eventually to the Americas in 2015. Only 20% of patients infected with Zika virus develop symptoms. However, there can be serious consequences of infection including birth defects in developing fetuses and links to Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. The swift rise in infections has necessitated the development of diagnostic tests for both the detection of viral RNA and the presence of virus-specific antibodies. Abbott has developed a dual target RT-PCR assay for the detection of Zika virus RNA within serum, plasma, whole blood, and urine using the automated m2000 system for sample extraction to result reporting. The Abbott RealTime ZIKA assay has a limit of detection of 30 copies per mL in serum, 40 copies per mL in plasma and urine, and 120 copies per mL in whole blood and demonstrates high specificity against challenges from closely related infectious agents.

We have previously shown that urine/plasma-based prostate-specific biomarkers can predict high grade PCa. Our objective was to determine the accuracy of a test using cell-free RNA levels of biomarkers in predicting prostatectomy results. This multicenter community-based prospective study was conducted using urine/blood samples collected from 306 patients. All recruited patients were treatment-naÃ¯ve, without metastases, and had been biopsied, designated a Gleason Score (GS) based on biopsy, and assigned to prostatectomy prior to participation in the study. The primary outcome measure was the urine/plasma test accuracy in predicting high grade PCa on prostatectomy compared with biopsy findings. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using standard formulas, while comparisons between groups were performed using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-Square, and Fisher's exact test. GS as assigned by standard 10-12 core biopsies was 3â+â3 in 90 (29.4%), 3â+â4 in 122 (39.8%), 4â+â3 in 50 (16.3%), and > 4â+â3 in 44 (14.4%) patients. The urine/plasma assay confirmed a previous validation and was highly accurate in predicting the presence of high-grade PCa (Gleason â¥3â+â4) with sensitivity between 88% and 95% as verified by prostatectomy findings. GS was upgraded after prostatectomy in 27% of patients and downgraded in 12% of patients. This plasma/urine biomarker test accurately predicts high grade cancer as determined by prostatectomy with a sensitivity at 92-97%, while the sensitivity of core biopsies was 78%.

This protocol is based on the World Health Organization report on sample storage and stability, but the recommendation lacks good supporting data. We studied the effect of storage temperature and time on osmolality measurements. Blood and urine samples were obtained from 16 patients and 25 healthy volunteers. Baseline serum, plasma and urine osmolality measurements were performed within 30âmin. Measurements were then made at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36âh on samples stored at 4-8â and room temperature. We compared baseline values with subsequent measurements and used difference plots to illustrate changes in osmolality. At 4-8â, serum and plasma osmolality were stable for up to 36âh. At room temperature, serum and plasma osmolality were very stable for up to 12âh. At 24 and 36âh, changes from baseline osmolality were statistically significant and exceeded the total allowable error of 1.5% but not the reference change value of 4.1%. Urine osmolality was extremely stable at room temperature with a mean change of less than 1 mosmol/kg at 36âh. Serum and plasma samples can be stored at room temperature for up to 36âh before measuring osmolality. Cooling samples to 4-8â may be useful when delays in measurement beyond 12âh are anticipated. Urine osmolality is extremely stable for up to 36âh at room temperature.

Present study aimed at verifying the correlation of vanadium levels among different matrices and assessing reference levels of the ion in a population of patients wearing a well-functioning hip prosthesis. Vanadium was measured using Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) in whole blood, serum and urine of 129 patients implanted with a TiAlV-alloy hip prosthesis. The values in the serum were above the upper limit of the reference values in 42% of patients (29% in urine and 13% in whole blood). A good correlation among matrices was observed (p < 0.001). The cohort of patients (N = 32) complaining of pain or in which a loosening or damage to the prosthesis was assessed showed a significantly higher excretion of vanadium in urine as compared with the remaining asymptomatic patients (p = 0.001). The 95th percentile distribution of vanadium in the cohort of patients with a well-functioning prosthesis was 0.3 Î¼g/L in whole blood, 0.5 Î¼g/L in serum and 2.8 Î¼g/L in urine, higher that in the unexposed population, especially for urine. The presence of a prosthesis, even though well-functioning, may cause a possible release of vanadium into the blood and a significant urinary excretion. The reference values of vanadium of the asymptomatic patients with titanium alloy hip prostheses supplied information regarding the background exposure level of the ions and their lower and upper limits.\n\nStability of serum, plasma and urine osmolality in different storage conditions: Relevance of temperature and centrifugation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSureda-Vives, MaciÃ ; Morell-Garcia, Daniel; Rubio-Alaejos, Ana; ValiÃ±a, Laura; Robles, Juan; BauÃ§a, Josep Miquel\n\n2017-09-01\n\nOsmolality reflects the concentration of all dissolved particles in a body fluid, and its measurement is routinely performed in clinical laboratories for the differential diagnosis of disorders related with the hydrolytic balance regulation, the renal function and in small-molecule poisonings. The aim of the study was to assess the stability of serum, plasma and urine osmolality through time and under different common storage conditions, including delayed centrifugation. Blood and urine samples were collected, and classified into different groups according to several preanalytical variables: serum or plasma lithium-heparin tubes; spun or unspun; stored at room temperature (RT), at 4Â°C or frozen at -21Â°C. Aliquots from each group were assayed over time, for up to 14days. Statistical differences were based on three different international performance criteria. Whole blood stability was higher in the presence of anticoagulant. Serum osmolality was stable for 2days at RT and 8days at 4Â°C, while plasma was less stable when refrigerated. Urine stability was 5days at RT, 4days at 4Â°C and >14days when frozen. Osmolality may be of great interest for the management of several conditions, such as in case of a delay in the clinical suspicion, or in case of problems in sample collection or processing. The ability to obtain reliable results for samples kept up to 14days also offers the possibility to retrospectively assess baseline values for patients which may require it. Copyright Â© 2017.

Î9-THC-COOH was used as a template molecule, whereas ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was used as a functional monomer, divinylbenzene (DVB) as a cross-linker, and 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator. The prepared MIP was found to be highly selective for cannabinoids typically found in blood and urine, and also for cannabinol (CBN) and cannabidiol (CBD). MIP beads (50Â mg) were loaded inside a cone-shaped device made of a polypropylene (PP) membrane for microsolid-phase extraction (Î¼-SPE) in batch mode. Optimum retention of analytes (0.1 to 1.0Â mL of plasma/urine) was achieved by fixing plasma/urine pH at 6.5 and assisting the procedure by mechanical shaking (150Â rpm, 40Â Â°C, 12Â min). Optimum elution conditions implied 2Â mL of a 90:10 methanol/acetic acid and ultrasound extraction (35Â kHz, 325Â W) for 6Â min. Good precision was assessed by intra-day and inter-day assays. In addition, the method was found to be accurate after intra-day and inter-day analytical recovery assays and after analyzing control serum and urine control samples. The limits of quantification were in the range of 0.36-0.49Â ngÂ L -1 (plasma analysis) and 0.47-0.57Â ngÂ L -1 (urine analysis). These values are low enough for confirmative conclusions regarding marijuana abuse through blood and urine analysis. Graphical Abstract á .\n\nImmunoassay detection of drugs in racing horses. IX. Detection of detomidine in equine blood and urine by radioimmunoassay\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWood, T.; Tai, C.L.; Taylor, D.G.\n\n1989-02-01\n\nDetomidine is a potent non-narcotic sedative agent which is currently in the process of being approved for veterinary clinical use in the United States. Since no effective screening method in horses is available for detomidine, we have developed an /sup 125/I radioimmunoassay for detomidine in equine blood and urine as part of a panel of tests for illegal drugs in performance horses. Our /sup 125/I radioimmunoassay has an I-50 for detomidine of approximately 2 ng/ml. Our assay shows limited cross-reactivity with the pharmacodynamically similar xylazine, but does not cross-react with acepromazine, epinephrine, haloperidol or promazine. The plasma kinetic data frommoreÂ Â» clinical (greater than or equal to 5 mg/horse) as well as sub-clinical doses indicate first-order elimination in a dose-dependent manner. Within the first 30 minutes after intravenous (IV) administration of 30 mg/horse, plasma levels peak at approximately 20 ng/ml and then decline with an apparent plasma half-life of 25 minutes. Diuresis can occur with administration of clinical doses of detomidine and this effect was accounted for in the analysis of urine samples. Using this method, administration of 30 mg/horse can be readily detected in equine urine for up to 8 hours after IV injection. Additionally, doses as low as 0.5 mg/horse can be detected for short periods of time in blood and urine with use of this assay. Utilization of this assay by research scientists and forensic analysts will allow for the establishment of proper guidelines and controls regarding detomidine administration to performance horses and assurance of compliance with these guidelines.Â«Â less\n\nDetermination of N-methylsuccinimide and 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide in human urine and plasma.\n\nPubMed\n\nJÃ¶nsson, B A; Akesson, B\n\n1997-12-19\n\nA method for determination of N-methylsuccinimide (MSI) and 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide (2-HMSI) in human urine and of MSI in human plasma was developed. MSI and 2-HMSI are metabolites of the widely used organic solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). MSI and 2-HMSI were purified from urine and plasma by C8 solid-phase extraction and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the negative-ion chemical ionisation mode. The intra-day precisions in urine were 2-6% for MSI (50 and 400 ng/ml) and 3-5% for 2-HMSI (1000 and 8000 ng/ml). For MSI in plasma it was 2% (60 and 1200 ng/ml). The between-day precisions in urine were 3-4% for MSI (100 and 1000 ng/ml) and 2-4% for 2-HMSI (10,000 and 18,000 ng/ml) and 3-4% for MSI in plasma (100 and 900 ng/ml). The recoveries from urine were 109-117% for MSI (50 and 400 ng/ml) and 81-89% for 2-HMSI (1000 and 8000 ng/ml). The recovery of MSI from plasma was 91-101% (50 and 500 ng/ml). The detection limits for MSI were 3 ng/ml in urine and 1 ng/ml in plasma and that of 2-HMSI in urine was 200 ng/ml. The method is applicable for analysis of urine and plasma samples from workers exposed to NMP.\n\nREACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES IN WHOLE BLOOD, BLOOD PLASMA AND BREAST MILK: VALIDATION OF A POTENTIAL MARKER OF EXPOSURE AND EFFECT\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are recognized to contribute to the pathobiology of many diseases.

The plasma lead concentration (PPb) and the mobilization yield of lead in urine by CaEDTA were highest during the period between 1 and 2 hr after the infusion was started. In contrast, the lead concentration in erythrocytes (EPb) and in whole blood (BPb) remained unchanged during the 24 hr following infusion. Plasma zinc concentration (PZn) also fell rapidly following CaEDTA infusion; the decline was followed by a gradual rise in the zinc concentration in erythrocytes (EZn) without alteration in the zinc in whole blood. The mobilization yield of zinc in urine by CaEDTA (MZn) reached its highest level within 1 hr after the start of the infusion. Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity in erythrocytes gradually increased for 5 hr following CaEDTA infusion. These observations suggest that (1) PPb concentration is a more sensitive indicator of the body burden of chelatable lead than is either BPb or EPb; (2) MZn is mobilized mostly from plasma during the first several hours following the start of CaEDTA infusion, and the fall in PZn concentration following infusion is compensated first by a rise in EZn concentration and then by an immediate redistribution of zinc in other organs to the blood; and (3) Pb-inhibited ALAD activity is reactivated by the increased EZn during and shortly after CaEDTA infusion.\n\nHuman Excretion of Bisphenol A: Blood, Urine, and Sweat (BUS) Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGenuis, Stephen J.; Beesoon, Sanjay; Birkholz, Detlef; Lobo, Rebecca A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an ubiquitous chemical contaminant that has recently been associated with adverse effects on human health. There is incomplete understanding of BPA toxicokinetics, and there are no established interventions to eliminate this compound from the human body. Using 20 study participants, this study was designed to assess the relative concentration of BPA in three body fluidsâblood, urine, and sweatâand to determine whether induced sweating may be a therapeutic intervention with potential to facilitate elimination of this compound. Methods. Blood, urine, and sweat were collected from 20 individuals (10 healthy participants and 10 participants with assorted health problems) and analyzed for various environmental toxicants including BPA. Results. BPA was found to differing degrees in each of blood, urine, and sweat. In 16 of 20 participants, BPA was identified in sweat, even in some individuals with no BPA detected in their serum or urine samples. Conclusions. Biomonitoring of BPA through blood and/or urine testing may underestimate the total body burden of this potential toxicant. Sweat analysis should be considered as an additional method for monitoring bioaccumulation of BPA in humans. Induced sweating appears to be a potential method for elimination of BPA.

[to combat orthostatic intolerance\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFrey, Mary A.; Riddle, Jeanne; Charles, John B.; Bungo, Michael W.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nTo compensate for the reduced blood and fluid volumes that develop during weightlessness, the Space Shuttle crewmembers consume salt tablets and water equivalent to 1 l of normal saline, about 2 hrs before landing. This paper compares the effects on blood, urine, and cardiovascular variables of the ingestion of 1 l of normal (0.9 percent) saline with the effects of distilled water, 1 percent glucose, 0.74 percent saline with 1 percent glucose, 0.9 percent saline with 1 percent glucose, and 1.07 percent saline. It was found that the expansion of plasma volume and the concentration of urine were greater 4 hrs after ingestion of 1.07 percent saline solution than after ingestion of normal saline and that the solutions containig glucose did not enhance any variables as compared with normal saline.\n\nFlow-injection chemiluminescence determination of melamine in urine and plasma.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Xiaoshuang; Shi, Xiyan; Tang, Yuhai; Yue, Zhongjin; He, Qiqi\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA novel flow-injection chemiluminescence method for the determination of melamine in urine and plasma was developed. It was found that melamine can remarkably enhance chemiluminescence emission from the luminol-K(3) Fe(CN)(6) system in an alkaline medium. Under the optimum conditions, chemiluminescence intensity had a good linear relationship with the concentration of melamine in the range 9.0 Ã 10(-9) -7.0 Ã 10(-6) g/mL, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9992. The detection limit (3Ï) was 3.5 ng/mL. The method has been applied to determine the concentration of melamine in samples using liquid-liquid extraction. Average recoveries of melamine were 102.6% in urine samples and 95.1% in plasma samples. The method provided a reproducible and stable approach for the sensitive detection of melamine in urine and plasma samples.

Three Holstein cows received daily oral cadmium administrations (as cadmium chloride) of 0.182Â mg/kgÂ bodyÂ weight/day for 21Â days followed by a 63-day withdrawal period. Blood, milk, hair, feces, and urine were collected during treatment and withdrawal periods. Cadmium concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Cadmium concentrations in blood (0.61-1.12Â Î¼g/L), milk (0.39-1.04Â Î¼g/L), and urine (0.41-2.05Â Î¼g/L) were low. Comparatively, cadmium concentrations in feces were higher, especially on treatment day 14 (20.11Â mg/kg dry matter). Fecal cadmium concentrations decreased to baseline levels (0.12Â mg/kg dry matter) on withdrawal day 21. Hair cadmium concentrations increased with treatment, reaching the highest levels on withdrawal day 7 (24.33Â Î¼g/kg). Most of the cadmium was excreted via the feces and very little was present in urine or milk. Cadmium residues were detected in blood and milk more than 63Â days after cadmium withdrawal. Hair cadmium concentrations may reflect exposure to the metal.\n\nComparison of Cannabinoid Concentrations in Plasma, Oral Fluid and Urine in Occasional Cannabis Smokers After Smoking Cannabis Cigarette.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarsot, AmÃ©lie; Audebert, Christine; Attolini, Laurence; Lacarelle, Bruno; Micallef, Joelle; Blin, Olivier\n\nA randomized cross-over, double blind placebo controlled study of smoked cannabis was carried out on occasional cannabis smokers. The objective of this research was to describe the pharmacokinetic parameters of THC and its metabolites in plasma, oral fluid and urine, from samples obtained simultaneously to provide estimations of THC and metabolites concentrations after smoking a cannabis cigarette. Blood, oral fluid and urine samples were collected until up to 72 h after smoking the cannabis cigarette (4% of delta-9-tetrathydrocannabinol (THC)). THC, 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH were analyzed by gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from these data. Eighteen male healthy adults participated in the study. In total, 560 plasma, 288 oral fluid and 448 urine samples were quantified for cannabinoids. Plasma, oral fluid and urine pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. A wide range of median THC Cmax (1.6-160.0 Âµg/L and 55.4-123120.0 Âµg/L in plasma and oral fluid, respectively), 11-OH-THC Cmax (0-11.1 Âµg/L in plasma) and THC-COOH Cmax (1.0-56.3 Âµg/L in plasma) was observed. When expressed as a percentage of the total available THC dose, and corrected for molar equivalents, mean percentage of total THC dose excreted was 1.9 +/-2.5 % with range of 0.2-7.5%. This high inter-individual variability was also observed on other calculated pharmacokinetic parameters. Prediction of plasma THC concentration from THC oral fluid concentration or from THC-COOH urinary concentrations is not feasible due to the large variations observed. The results from this study support the assumption that a positive oral fluid THC result or a positive urine fluid result are indicative of a recent cannabis exposure.Â This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

Blood, however, may be difficult to draw in some patients, especially in children, and sampling during outbreak investigations or epidemiological studies may face logistical challenges or limited compliance to invasive procedures from subjects. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of using saliva and urine samples instead of blood for dengue diagnosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Serial plasma, urine and saliva samples were collected at several time-points between the day of admission to hospital until three months after the onset of fever in children with confirmed dengue disease. Quantitative RT-PCR, NS1 antigen capture and ELISA serology for anti-DENV antibody (IgG, IgM and IgA) detection were performed in parallel on the three body fluids. RT-PCR and NS1 tests demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 85.4%/63.4%, 41.6%/14.5% and 39%/28.3%, in plasma, urine and saliva specimens, respectively. When urine and saliva samples were collected at the same time-points and tested concurrently, the diagnostic sensitivity of RNA and NS1 detection assays was 69.1% and 34.4%, respectively. IgG/IgA detection assays had an overall sensitivity of 54.4%/37.4%, 38.5%/26.8% and 52.9%/28.6% in plasma, urine and saliva specimens, respectively. IgM were detected in 38.1% and 36% of the plasma and saliva samples but never in urine. Conclusions Although the performances of the different diagnostic methods were not as good in saliva and urine as in plasma specimens, the results obtained by qRT-PCR and by anti-DENV antibody ELISA could well justify the use of these two body fluids to detect dengue infection in situations when the collection of blood specimens is not possible.

The objective of the current study was to describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of isoflupredone acetate as well as time-related urine and synovial fluid concentrations following intra-articular administration to horses. Twelve racing-fit adult Thoroughbred horses received a single intra-articular administration (8 mg) of isoflupredone acetate into the right antebrachiocarpal joint. Blood, urine and synovial fluid samples were collected prior to and at various times up to 28 days post drug administration. All samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Plasma data were analyzed using a population pharmacokinetic compartmental model. Maximum measured plasma isoflupredone concentrations were 1.76 Â± 0.526 ng/mL at 4.0 Â± 1.31 h and 1.63 Â± 0.243 ng/mL at 4.75 Â± 0.5 h, respectively, for horses that had synovial fluid collected and for those that did not. The plasma beta half-life was 24.2 h. Isoflupredone concentrations were below the limit of detection in all horses by 48 h and 7 days in plasma and urine, respectively. Isoflupredone was detected in the right antebrachiocarpal and middle carpal joints for 8.38 Â± 5.21 and 2.38 Â± 0.52 days, respectively. Results of this study provide information that can be used to regulate the use of intra-articular isoflupredone in the horse.

Fourteen workers handling borax at jobs of low, medium, and high dust exposures were sampled throughout full shifts for 5 consecutive days each. Airborne borax concentrations ranged from means of 3.3 mg/m3 to 18 mg/m3, measured gravimetrically. End-of-shift mean blood-boron concentrations ranged from 0.11 to 0.26 microgram/g; end-of-shift mean urine concentrations ranged from 3.16 to 10.72 micrograms/mg creatinine. Creatinine measures were used to adjust for differences in urine-specific gravity such that 1 ml of urine contains approximately 1 mg creatinine. There was no progressive increase in end-of-shift blood- or urine-boron concentrations across the days of the week. Urine testing done at the end of the work shift gave a somewhat better estimate of borate exposure than did blood testing, was sampled more easily, and was analytically less difficult to perform. Personal air samplers of two types were used: one, the 37-mm closed-face, two-piece cassette to estimate total dust and the other, the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) sampler to estimate inspirable particulate mass. Under the conditions of this study, the IOM air sampler more nearly estimated human exposure as measured by blood- and urine-boron levels than did the sampler that measured total dust.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) PMID:7889874\n\nDetermination of modafinil in plasma and urine by reversed phase high-performance liquid-chromatography.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwertner, Harvey A; Kong, Suk Bin\n\n2005-03-09\n\nModafinil (Provigil) is a new wake-promoting drug that is being used for the management of excessive sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. It has pharmacological properties similar to that of amphetamine, but without some of the side effects associated with amphetamine-like stimulants. Since modafinil has the potential to be abused, accurate drug-screening methods are needed for its analysis. In this study, we developed a high-performance liquid-chromatographic procedure (HPLC) for the quantitative analysis of modafinil in plasma and urine. (Phenylthio)acetic acid was used as an internal standard for the analysis of both plasma and urine. Modafinil was extracted from urine and plasma with ethyl acetate and ethyl acetate-acetic acid (100:1, v/v), respectively, and analyzed on a C18 reverse phase column with methanol-water-acetic acid (500:500:1, v/v) as the mobile phase. Recoveries from urine and plasma were 80.0 and 98.9%, respectively and the limit of quantitation was 0.1 microg/mL at 233 nm. Forty-eight 2-h post-dose urine samples from sham controls and from individuals taking 200 or 400 mg of modafinil were analyzed without knowledge of drug administration. All 16-placebo urine samples and all 32 2-h post-dose urine samples were correctly classified. The analytical procedure is accurate and reproducible and can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring, pharmacokinetic studies, and drug abuse screening.\n\nQuantitative liquid chromatographic determination of bromadoline and its N-demethylated metabolites in blood, plasma, serum, and urine samples.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeng, G W; Sood, V K; Rykert, U M\n\n1985-03-01\n\nBromadoline and its two N-demethylated metabolites were extracted into ether:butyl chloride after the addition of internal standard and basification of the various biological fluids (blood, plasma, serum, and urine). These compounds were then extracted into dilute phosphoric acid from the organic phase and separated on a reversed-phase chromatographic system using a mobile phase containing acetonitrile and a buffer of 1,4-dimethylpiperazine and perchloric acid. The overall absolute extraction recoveries of these compounds were approximately 50-80%. The background interferences from the biological fluids were negligible and allowed quantitative determination of bromadoline and the metabolites at levels as low as 2-5 ng/mL. At mobile phase flow rate of 1 mL/min, the sample components and the internal standard were eluted at the retention times within approximately 7-12 min. The drug- and metabolite-to-internal standard peak height ratios showed excellent linear relationships with their corresponding concentrations. The analytical method showed satisfactory within- and between-run assay precision and accuracy, and has been utilized in the simultaneous determination of bromadoline and its two N-demethylated metabolites in biological fluids collected from humans and from dogs after administration of bromadoline maleate.\n\nRelationship between mercury in kidney, blood, and urine in environmentally exposed individuals, and implications for biomonitoring\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAkerstrom, Magnus, E-mail: magnus.akerstrom@amm.gu\n\nBackground: Individuals without occupational exposure are exposed to mercury (Hg) from diet and dental amalgam. The kidney is a critical organ, but there is limited information regarding the relationship between Hg in kidney (K-Hg), urine (U-Hg), blood (B-Hg), and plasma (P-Hg). Objectives: The aim was to determine the relationship between K-Hg, U-Hg, B-Hg, and P-Hg among environmentally exposed individuals, estimate the biological half-time of K-Hg, and provide information useful for biomonitoring of Hg. Methods: Kidney cortex biopsies and urine and blood samples were collected from 109 living kidney donors. Total Hg concentrations were determined and the relationships between K-Hg, U-Hg,moreÂ Â» P-Hg, and B-Hg were investigated in regression models. The half-time of K-Hg was estimated from the elimination constant. Results: There were strong associations between K-Hg and all measures of U-Hg and P-Hg (r{sub p} = 0.65â0.84, p < 0.001), while the association with B-Hg was weaker (r{sub p} = 0.29, p = 0.002). Mean ratios between K-Hg (in Î¼g/g) and U-Hg/24h (in Î¼g) and B-Hg (in Î¼g/L) were 0.22 and 0.19 respectively. Estimates of the biological half-time varied between 30 and 92 days, with significantly slower elimination in women. Adjusting overnight urine samples for dilution using urinary creatinine resulted in less bias in relation to K-Hg or U-Hg/24h, compared with other adjustment techniques. Conclusions: The relationship between K-Hg and U-Hg is approximately linear. K-Hg can be estimated using U-Hg and gender. Women have longer half-time of Hg in kidney compared to men. Adjusting overnight urine samples for creatinine concentration resulted in less bias. - Highlights: â¢ The first study of the relation between Hg in kidney, blood and urine at low U-Hg â¢ Simultaneous samples were collected from healthy kidney donors. â¢ There was a linear relationship between mercury in kidney and urine. â¢ Kidney Hg can be estimated using U-Hg and gender. â¢ Women\n\nDetermination of tetrahydrozoline in urine and blood using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).\n\nPubMed\n\nPeat, Judy; Garg, Uttam\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTetrahydrozoline, a derivative of imidazoline, is widely used for the symptomatic relief of conjunctival and nasal congestion; however, intentional or unintentional high doses can result in toxicity manifested by hypotension, tachycardia, and CNS depression. The detection of the drug in blood and urine is helpful in the diagnosis and management of a toxic patient. For the analysis, plasma, serum, or urine is added to a tube containing alkaline buffer and organic extraction solvents, and tetrahydrozoline from the sample is extracted into the organic phase by gentle mixing. After centrifugation, the upper organic solvent layer containing the drug is removed and dried under stream of nitrogen at 40 degrees C. The residue is reconstituted in a hexane-ethanol mixture and analyzed using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry. Quantitation of the drug is done by comparing responses of unknown sample to the responses of the calibrators using selected ion monitoring. Naphazoline is used as an internal standard.\n\nOligosaccharides in Urine, Blood, and Feces of Piglets Fed Milk Replacer Containing Galacto-oligosaccharides.\n\nPubMed\n\nDifilippo, Elisabetta; Bettonvil, Monique; Willems, Rianne H A M; Braber, Saskia; Fink-Gremmels, Johanna; Jeurink, Prescilla V; Schoterman, Margriet H C; Gruppen, Harry; Schols, Henk A\n\n2015-12-23\n\nHuman milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are absorbed into the blood (about 1% of the HMO intake) and subsequently excreted in urine, where they may protect the infant from pathogen infection. As dietary galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) have partial structural similarities with HMOs, this study investigated the presence of GOS and oligosaccharides originating from milk replacer in blood serum, urine, and cecal and fecal samples of piglets, as a model for human infants. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis with fluorescence detection, oligosaccharides originating from piglet diet including 3'-sialyllactose and specific GOS ranging from degree of polymerization 3 to 6 were detected in blood serum and in urine of piglets. In blood serum, GOS levels ranged from 16 to 23 Î¼g/mL, representing about 0.1% of the GOS daily intake. In urine, approximately 0.85 g of GOS/g of creatinine was found. Cecum digesta and feces contained low amounts of oligosaccharides, suggesting an extensive GOS intestinal fermentation in piglets.\n\nThe determination of ethanol in blood and urine by mass fragmentography\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPereira, W. E.; Summons, R. E.; Rindfleisch, T. C.; Duffield, A. M.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nA mass fragmentographic technique for a rapid, specific and sensitive determination of ethanol in blood and urine is described. A Varian gas chromatograph coupled through an all-glass membrane separator to a Finnigan quadripole mass spectrometer and interfaced to a computer system is used for ethanol determination in blood and urine samples. A procedure for plotting calibration curves for ethanol quantitation is also described. Quantitation is achieved by plotting the peak area ratios of undeuterated-to-deuterated ethanol fragment ions against the amount of ethanol added. Representative results obtained by this technique are included.\n\nBLOOD PLASMA PROTEIN GIVEN BY VEIN UTILIZED IN BODY METABOLISM\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHolman, Russell L.; Mahoney, Earle B.; Whipple, George H.\n\n1934-01-01\n\nLarge amounts of normal blood plasma can be given intravenously to normal dogs over several weeks without causing any significant escape by way of the urine. There appears to be no renal threshold for plasma protein even with high plasma protein concentration (9.7 per cent). Dogs receiving sugar by mouth and plasma by vein can be kept practically in nitrogen equilibrium and it would seem that the injected protein must be utilized by the body. If this can happen in this emergency we may suspect that normally there is a certain amount of \"give and take\" between body protein and plasma protein. Plasma protein fed by mouth under identical conditions shows the same general reaction as noted with plasma by vein but the urinary nitrogen is a little higher and suggests that the injected protein is utilized a little more completely to form new protein. The difference may be explained as due to deaminization in the case of protein by mouth. During fasting periods the blood plasma proteins are used up and the total circulating protein may even decrease to one-half the normal level. The plasma protein concentration changes but little and the significant change is a shrinkage of plasma volume. All these facts point to a dynamic equilibrium between tissue protein and plasma protein depending upon the physiological needs of the moment. In the absence of food protein the body can use material coming from one body protein to fabricate badly needed protein material of different character.

The objective of the current study was to identify the metabolic phenotype associated with the BCAAs intake level that could be linked to the animal growth performance. Three dose-response studies were carried out to collect blood and urine samples from pigs fed increasing levels of Ile, Val, or Leu followed by a nontargeted LC-MS approach to characterize the metabolic profile of biofluids when dietary BCAAs are optimum for animal growth. Results showed that concentrations of plasma hypoxanthine and tyrosine (Tyr) were higher while concentrations of glycocholic acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid, and taurocholic acid were lower when the dietary Ile was optimum. Plasma 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid and creatine were lower when dietary Leu was optimum. The optimum dietary Leu resulted in increased urinary excretion of ascorbic acid and choline and relatively decreased excretion of 2-aminoadipic acid, acetyl-dl-valine, Ile, 2-methylbutyrylglycine, and Tyr. In conclusion, plasma glycocholic acid and taurocholic acid were discriminating metabolites to the optimum dietary Ile. The optimum dietary Leu was associated with reduced plasma creatine and urinary 2-aminoadipic acid and elevated urinary excretion of ascorbic acid and choline. The optimum dietary Val had a less pronounced metabolic response reflected in plasma or urine than other BCAA.\n\nEx vivo spontaneous generation of 19-norandrostenedione and nandrolone detected in equine plasma and urine.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuan, Fuyu; Uboh, Cornelius E; Soma, Lawrence R; You, Youwen; Li, Xiaoqing; McDonnell, Sue\n\n2012-01-01\n\n19-Norandrostenedione (NAED) and nandrolone are anabolic-androgenic steroids (AASs). Nandrolone was regarded solely as a synthetic AAS until the 1980s when trace concentrations of apparently endogenous nandrolone were detected in urine samples obtained from intact male horses (stallions). Since then, its endogenous origin has been reported in boars and bulls; endogenous NAED and nandrolone have been identified in plasma and urine samples collected from stallions. More recently, however, it was suggested that NAED and nandrolone detected in urine samples from stallions are primarily artifacts due to the analytical procedure. The present study was undertaken to determine whether NAED and nandrolone detected in plasma and urine samples collected from stallions are truly endogenous or artifacts from sample processing. To answer this question, fresh plasma and urine samples from"
