        "text": "Long Island’s KJOY 98.3 will spend the holiday season granting wishes to Long Islanders in need. In partnership with NEFCU, the stationwill provide toys, appliances, and more to recipients nominated by listeners, as part of K-98.3 Christmas Wish.\n\n“Our Christmas Wish program is one of the most rewarding things we do at K-98.3,” said Jon Daniels, WKJY Program Director. “We’re more than justMusic That Makes You Feel Good – we’re Long Islanders too, and we feel great about being able to help the community when we can, especially during the holiday season.”\n\nWith K-98.3 Christmas Wish, listeners nominate a friend, family member, or co-worker to receive a ‘wish.’ Station staff selects wishes to fulfill, and works with community organizations to obtain products as necessary. Requestswill be judged based on a number of pre-set criteria, including sincerity, persuasiveness, and need. Wish recipientswill be notified on-air throughout December.\n\nLast year, one such wish recipient was Kelly M. from Farmingville, who had her wish hand-delivered to her and her young daughters by Frosty The Snowman.\n\n“We’re so excited to partner with K-98.3 on this wonderful holiday promotion. This fun and rewarding sponsorship exemplifies what true holiday spirit is all about. During this season of giving, we’re fortunate to be able to help bring such joy to our fellow Long Islanders” said Valerie Garguilo, Vice President of Marketing and Community Relations for NEFCU.\n\nAbout Connoisseur Media Long Island\n\nWe are Connoisseur Media, a broadcast media company that delivers quality Radio to listeners, advertisers and communities.
