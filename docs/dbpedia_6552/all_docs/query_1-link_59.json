        "text": "5: Favorite male leads\n\nI can’t choose between these two. They share some of the same qualities (both are petty as f*ck, but also incredibly protective), but most importantly I just love them both for being outside the drama male lead archetypes.\n\nDokko Jin\n\nI love Dokku Jin. He is basically the most bonkers male lead in all of dramaland. Instead of the cold genius, we have the over-the-top, vain as f*ck, selfish, diva of a male lead. (Ironically, the typical dramaland male lead traits went to the second lead, the cold, rich, geeeeeenius character with a heart of gold.) Best Love is one of my all-time favorite dramas. It’s got a fairly simple set-up, but it’s brilliance lies in its execution, something which relied very heavily in the leads being dynamic, interesting and likable and having chemistry for days. And part of that meant that whoever played Dokku Jin needed to be able to ground this over-the-top character in the smallest ways so the audience could see his humanity. Cha Seung-won did this brilliantly, and he brings the character to life in unexpected ways, grounding him in the little things: the way he loved his stupid little potato flower, and the way he took care of Ding Dong, the way he’s sentimental and petty at the same time. He grows in the drama, not into a better person, but into a more grounded one. He never loses that arrogance that makes him Dokku Jin, and I love him all the more for it. He’s a testament to the fact that you can have a character who is vain and arrogant and still likeable."
