Rex, early Stones and early AC/DC, then look no further than The Compulsions. This New York City band is raw, gritty and most certainly amazing. Led by Guns N' Roses guys Richard Fortus and Frank Ferrer, ex-Hanoi Rocks bassist Sami Yaffa and lead vocalist/guitarist Rob Carlyle, they rock old school with bite. They've just released Dirty Fun and that's pretty much what we experienced at the Mercury Lounge. The grime and sweat of this club was reproduced through The Compulsions' sound – a perfect match! They opened with what I thought was a cover of \"Let There Be Rock,\" but in actuality it was \"Rock 'N' Roll Johnny\" from their 2009 extended-play. Of course, they plucked a few gems from the aforesaid Dirty Fun including the Stones-like \"Hellbound Babies,\" the sleazy \"House Of Rock,\" and a gloriously raunchy cover of Little Richard's \"Long Tall Sally.\" Their first full-length, Beat The Devil, got some play too. The AC/DC-like \"Hired Gun\" rolled along at a sharp pace, as did all 45 seconds of the punk rave-up, \"Eat My Dust.\" \"Evil Bastards\" could be Mott the Hoople jamming with Angus Young – so good! \"Lucky\" is, again, all about re-creating that old Stones feel – a real guitar-slung-low kinda song. The Compulsions are the greatest band you've never heard of!\"\n\nRead Tony Pijar's full review of The Compulsions' recent Mercury Lounge performance in Issue #176 of Powerplay Magazine UK! Also includes Duncan Jamieson's glowing review of Dirty Fun as \"A Loose-Hipped, Sleazy Rock 'N' Roll Affair.\" Grab it at newsstands now! Or order your copy at the link below!\n\n29 April 2015\n\n\"The band that you're about to read about has so much cool it's off the damn charts. Sure, they have the pedigree (lead guitarist Richard Fortus and drummer Frank Ferrer are alumnus of Guns N' Roses, and bass player Sami Yaffa was in New York Dolls and Hanoi Rocks), but it's much more than that. It's gritty, down 'n' dirty, honest rock 'n' roll. It's a guitar player slinging a beat-to-shit Telecaster with a lit cigarette in the headstock. It's lyrics like 'there's a deal going down in the basement, while the Devil waits in his Jaguar.'\"\n\nHit the link below now to read Richard Rosenthal's epic new article about Rob Carlyle & The Compulsions in Screamer Magazine!\n\n19 April 2015\n\n\"Everyone's heard 'Long Tall Sally' done a zillion times, but they've never heard it done the way this band did it. Carlyle's vocal delivery converted the tune from a stale bar band staple to a sensual, risqué aural bump 'n' grind. By the end of the set, 'Shake Hands With The Devil' showed why there's a buzz about this band. Fortus played a screaming slide guitar solo, Ferrer showed why he earned the nickname 'Thunderchucker' and the audience was rockin' and groovin'. The Viper Room. The Compulsions. That's the shit. They're the real deal.\"\n\nVisit the link below now to read Richard Rosenthal's entire review in Screamer Magazine!\n\n17 April 2015\n\n\"The Compulsions took the stage without any fuss and laid down a solid 40-minute set of punk-infused rock 'n' roll, decorated by guitar solos by Richard Fortus, the skillful rhythm section of Frank Ferrer and fill-in bassist Alec Morton, and excellent frontmanship by Rob Carlyle. It came across as simple, no-bullshit, unpretentious heavy rock and the Viper Room was the perfect setting for it. The Compulsions showcased appreciable variety within their set, with tunes ranging from minute-long breathless punk to slow blues rock jams. It was also another proof of the undeniable and criminally underrated talent the members of the current Guns N' Roses lineup possess. It was a treat to watch Fortus and Ferrer in this intimate environment, and they certainly imposed their musical stamp on The Compulsions' performance here. The Compulsions are no overhyped supergroup and are experts in doing the things that matter most to the rock 'n' roll lover.\"\n\nVisit the link below now to read Andrew Bansal's entire review in Metal Assault!\n\n9 April 2015\n\n\"The aptly-titled Dirty Fun is the release that should put the New York City-based band on the national radar. The set opens with the harmonica-enhanced rocker \"Hellbound Babies\" while \"Lucky\" is straight out of the Rolling Stones songbook.\n\nCarlyle has a slightly smoky voice that is perfect for shading songs like \"Evil Bastards\" and \"House Of Rock\" with hints of danger and he also sounds eerie talk-singing about \"the coolest band in the world\" on the narcotic haze of \"The Feel.\" That song is a sharp contrast to \"I Still Got The Hots For You, Baby,\" a barrelhouse rocker that mashes up The Stones with Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nThe Compulsions aren't trying to reinvent the wheel here but they roll it pretty damn good, as you'd expect from a veteran line-up. Dirty fun indeed.\"\n\nRead more of Kevin Wierzbicki's Dirty Fun review in antiMusic at the link below!\n\n7 April 2015\n\nTo celebrate the release of their second full-length album, Dirty Fun, The Compulsions will perform at The Mercury Lounge in New York City on Tuesday, April 14 at 10 pm – with very special guests Ten Ton Mojo and The Nuclears! Two days later, The Compulsions will perform at The Viper Room in West Hollywood on Thursday, April 16 at 10 pm – with Delta Rose and Flashback Heart Attack! Note: Alec Morton (ex-Raging Slab) will fill in on bass for Sami Yaffa! Several guest musicians will also join The Compulsions on stage so keep checking back for updates! See you at the shows!
