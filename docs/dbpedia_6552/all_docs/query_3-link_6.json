        "text": "Connoisseur Media today announced it has reached an agreement to sell its Frederick, MD radio stations, WFRE-FM and WFMD-AM, to Local Daily Media, of Williamsburg, VA.\n\nWFRE-FM (99.9 WFRE – Free Country) and WFMD-AM (930 Free Talk) are both top rated stations in the Frederick, MD market according to Nielsen.\n\nJeffrey Warshaw, CEO of Connoisseur, said, “While it is difficult for us to part with our Frederick stations, we were convinced that Local Daily Media’s management leadership\n\nand its focus in the Maryland/Virginia region could move these stations forward in a way we would be proud of. Senior management of Local Daily Media includes longtime Connoisseur partner Mike Dufort who we have worked with closely and respect. Mike understands local radio and shares our view on the need for radio to be involved with and serve the local community.”\n\nAdam Crotty, CFO of Local Daily Media, said “We’re incredibly fortunate to welcome these legendary stations, along with their talented and dedicated teams, to our growing organization. Their rich history of supporting and improving the vibrant Frederick community will undoubtedly inspire our entire team to find new ways to positively impact each community we serve.”\n\nMike Dufort, President of Local Daily Media, added, “With my nearly 11 years of working with Jeff and the entire Connoisseur team, I deeply understand and appreciate the care and nurturing that went into building these stations and I’m excited for the opportunity to continue along their journey to reaching even greater heights.”\n\nThe purchase is subject to FCC approval and other customary closing conditions. Prior to that time, Connoisseur will continue to be in control of and will be operating the radio stations.\n\nAbout Connoisseur Media:\n\nConnoisseur Media owns market-leading radio stations in regions including Nassau-Suffolk, NY, Metro Fairfield County, CT and New Haven, CT as well as these stations in Frederick, MD. After the sale, it will operate 11 radio stations and its digital media solutions company, Ferocious Digital in markets that include New York and Connecticut. Often regarded as one of the most respected media companies in the country, Connoisseur is a forward-thinking media company dedicated to helping brands grow and advertisers to succeed.\n\nAbout Local Daily Media:\n\nLocal Daily Media operates in two markets: Virginia’s Historic Triangle, encompassing Williamsburg, Jamestown, and Yorktown, and Wilmington, North Carolina. The company serves these communities through two online hyperlocal local news publications, four radio stations, and an innovative e-commerce platform.\n\nConnoisseur Media proudly announces the acquisition of The Ruden Report, Fairfield County’s premier source for high school sports news and information. This acquisition aligns with Connoisseur Media Connecticut’s commitment to delivering relevant, local content to the residents and listeners in the communities they serve.\n\nDave Ruden, the well-respected founder of The Ruden Report, will partner with Connoisseur Media to expand coverage and ultimately provide more comprehensive reporting to the residents of Southern Connecticut. Connoisseur Media plans to leverage its extensive assets, including six radio stations, to enhance local sports coverage.\n\n“We are beyond thrilled to welcome The Ruden Report into our Connecticut portfolio,” stated Kristin Okesson SVP/General Manager of Connoisseur Media Connecticut. “We look forward to partnering with Dave and his loyal following and building upon the outstanding coverage that he has produced over the years. This addition to our programming lineup is a perfect fit for each station and their audiences. As someone who values high school sports coverage, I’m excited to bring The Ruden Report to our six radio stations. I know our Southern Connecticut listeners will enjoy the local updates and in-depth coverage of their favorite teams, athletes, and games.”\n\nLocal sports enthusiasts, parents, players, alums and listeners will be able to hear The Ruden Report high school sports coverage on Connoisseur Media radio stations in Connecticut starting this fall. Connoisseur Media operates and/or owns WEBE 108, STAR 99.9, WYBC, WICC, 99.1 WPLR, and 95.9 The Fox in Connecticut. The integration of The Ruden Report into this portfolio marks a significant enhancement in local content delivery.\n\n“We’re happy to have Dave and The Ruden Report join our Connoisseur Media family,” shared Jeff Warshaw, owner and CEO of Connoisseur Media, LLC. “We look forward to offering our audience local content with his exceptional reporting.”\n\nDave Ruden commented, “The success of The Ruden Report and the support from the readership community over the last 11 years has been quite humbling. Traffic to the site continues an upward trajectory. Still, the biggest complaint I receive is “why can’t you cover us?” That has been my ongoing goal — to cover more — which is why I have decided to partner with Connoisseur Media, a company that has both a longstanding tradition of excellence and the infrastructure to help take The Ruden Report to the next level. I am excited about the future, working with Jeff Warshaw, Kristin Okesson and the rest of the talented team at Connoisseur.”\n\nFor more information about Connoisseur Media and its Connecticut radio stations click here.
