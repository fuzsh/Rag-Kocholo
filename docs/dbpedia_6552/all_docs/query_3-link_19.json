        "text": "D-8 before Sabine Matheson and I will present the Case Study \"Leading with transparency, regaining influence and impact as a minority co-shareholder\" at the FBN Global Summit 2023 ! Read the pitch : Several years after their merger with another big legal publisher, the result of which was the Lefebvre-Sarrut Group, European leader in legal, tax and regulatory knowledge, the Sarrut family, now a minority shareholder, realised they were facing new and different challenges. Sabine Matheson, granddaughter of the founders of “Les Editions Legislatives” and Vice-President of the Board of the group, thought it was time to act, for the sake of the family asset, family dynamics, and the business itself. Thanks to her transparent leadership, a new path was taken, involving all major stakeholders: the Sarrut family, the Sarrut holding and its administrators, the majority co-shareholder, and the board and leaders of the firm. This new, more efficient governance resulted in a clearer vision, raison d’être, and strategy. Great Key learnings ahead ! ✨ ELBConseil supported Sarrut in its process of defining a vision and raison d'être with the shareholders, writing a family charter and doing the evaluation of the board. ✨ #FBN #governance #transparency #leadership #coconstruction #fun\n\nThank you to Tammy Dowley-Blackman for moderating an insightful conversation with panelists Bob Beckler, Sue Buchanan, Wendy Burden, Andria Long, and Arun T Saha during Tuesday’s DDI Program – “Understanding Board Opportunities: Mature Private Companies and the Family-owned Business.” Here are some key takeaways: 1. Private company boards, in general, provide more opportunities than public companies to be involved in developing strategy and to see the day-to-day operations of the company. 2. The workload of and compensation for private company board directors is generally less than that for directors of publicly traded companies, but time demands can change dramatically if there is a significant transaction going on. PE portfolio company boards also may meet monthly, and sometimes even weekly, for brief updates on the business. 3. When imagining the typical pyramid-shaped business structure, you can think about three rooms with stakeholders in the top room, the board in the middle room, and the executive management in the room at the base. With a family-owned company, there is a fourth room, the “family room,” that traverses all three levels of the pyramid, because family members can serve on the board, be shareholders, and they can be part of management. Board members need to understand the dynamic this creates. 4. For family-owned companies, it is important to understand “the family’s purpose.” For instance, is it long-term value creation or finding a buyer to provide liquidity to the family shareholders?\n\nThis is a spot-on assessment by Anjli Raval. The value of hiring consultants has always been access to knowledge, expertise, experience, and proven methodologies. A one-stop model waters down the value proposition and directly leads to the failed projects we now constantly read about in the news. In some ways, this is an example of consultants eating their own dog food. For decades, consulting firms peddled diversification as a solution to market downturns, slow growth, and revenue cyclicality. Remember, #consultants turned companies like GE into conglomerates that could supposedly build an aircraft engine with the same skills and experience needed to run a television network. Later, consultants advised companies like GE to divest non-core assets and win based on focus, specialization, and excellence. Many consulting firms are diversifying in the same way in an effort to maintain growth. Some consultancies may have started as accounting firms and grown into global consulting powerhouses. However, the leap from accounting to software development is not that different from the leap GE took when it went from designing wind turbines to writing television sitcom scripts. There is no better example of this than every firm's pivot towards #AI. A quick stroll through the Wayback Machine shows how many firms claiming deep AI expertise had precisely zero AI offerings or projects mentioned on their websites just a few years ago. Similarly, according to old bios and LinkedIn profiles, many of the anointed AI experts and thought leaders at these firms were working in unrelated fields as recently as two years ago. Clients are doing more Googling and reference checking, and it's becoming much harder to maintain the \"we are world-class experts in everything\" veneer. The more firms diversify offerings, the more clients look to proven niche experts. As the larger firms face slowdowns in growth, the smaller, more focused firms are seeing unprecedented demand.\n\n“Wear white, light up the night” These were the instructions for yesterday evening’s event at the Boardroom, their summer party to bring the London network together. Well, I don’t own anything white (having been told many years ago it doesn’t suit me) so after a frantic, last-minute scour of Vinted, I gave up and wore black (if you can't be good, be different!) While I still have a few months to go of this year’s programme, the education section is now complete, so I’ve been reflecting on what I’ve learned over the last six months or so. The greatest insight was that curiosity and humility are essential qualities of successful board members, but that there are many incredible women out there who could do with a bit less of the latter. If you could see what I see, you'd definitely back yourself! I realised my experience is very specific to small, growing businesses making the transition from SME/founder-led to the professionalisation required to scale to the next level, or companies going through disruptive change (given that’s my consulting background) rather than large, well-established companies. The niche rules out a lot of board positions, but that's OK - I'm in no rush and will continue to build my skillset in the meantime. One of my favourite sessions was Stuart Warner's full day on Finance for board members – especially the tricks that exec teams can use to tell a story that may skew the reality. But all 5 modules were insightful and well delivered by Andrew Lawley (Board Governance), Emma de Ronde and Clementine Hogarth (Legal Framework), Kit Bingham (How to get on a board) and Roderic Yapp (Leadership). The evening talks were incredible, from what PE firms look for in board members (thanks, Nina Koenig, Tracey Huggett and Fiona Satchell) to F*ck being humble (Stefanie Sword-Williams FRSA (she/her), Lead like a Girl (Dalia Feldheim) and Executive Presence with Mathew Dixon. Maya Hennerkes did an excellent session on ESG and other topics ranged from AI (Susan Furnell, Aileen Dalisay), Ambidexterity (Dr Katharina Lange) and how to build a successful portfolio NED career (Moni Mannings OBE). These were just the sessions I attended – what were your favourite sessions, Libby Vincent Aileen Dalisay Kate McLaughlin Rajni Kumar Christina Stavrou, Emma de Ronde, Maya Hennerkes (my 'inner circle' – so many more incredible members I don’t have the space to tag!!!)\n\nPrivate Company Governance is quickly maturing. Private company boards are increasingly assuming many of the same responsibilities and best practices as public companies. That's been a huge takeaway from this week's Private Company Governance Summit - amazing companies, growing quickly, quietly & humbly, with the oversight and guidance of insightful and effective boards. But here's the thing. Owners can vest the board with authority, and the board chair can ensure that governance is superb.....but you need the right directors, including independents; selected for culture, expertise, fit against the skills matrix, etc. Sometimes those are unicorns - but you have to keep looking and upgrade appropriately. The days of lifetime sinecures are over, and the pool extends well beyond neighbors and acquaintances. Great session on How to Find Great Board Members with Bill Etnyre, Sally Washlow, fellow Private Directors Association® member Alyssa Gelbard, and moderated by NACD (National Association of Corporate Directors) Marcel Bucsescu. Key takeaway from Sally, don't forget your target market. You may find an ideal independent director among your customers and prospects. #IndependentDirector #BoardGovernance #Governance #RecruitingDirectors #BoardOversight MLR Media Private Company Director Directors & Boards\n\n𝗖𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗮 𝗼𝗻𝗲-𝘀𝗶𝘇𝗲-𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀-𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. It's a nuanced decision that can pivot the future of your business. Recently, I found myself in discussions with an IT company seeking advisory board members. Interestingly, they saw value in my perspective, not for my IT expertise, but for my outsider's view. It's a powerful reminder: 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝘀 𝗱𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁. In the evolving landscape of business, where challenges are as diverse as the solutions, having a board that mirrors this diversity could be a game-changer. It can lead to innovative ideas, pushing the company beyond its comfort zone, unlocking the full potential of the business.
