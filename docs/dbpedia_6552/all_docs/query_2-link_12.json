        "text": "Thank you to Tammy Dowley-Blackman for moderating an insightful conversation with panelists Bob Beckler, Sue Buchanan, Wendy Burden, Andria Long, and Arun T Saha during Tuesday’s DDI Program – “Understanding Board Opportunities: Mature Private Companies and the Family-owned Business.” Here are some key takeaways: 1. Private company boards, in general, provide more opportunities than public companies to be involved in developing strategy and to see the day-to-day operations of the company. 2. The workload of and compensation for private company board directors is generally less than that for directors of publicly traded companies, but time demands can change dramatically if there is a significant transaction going on. PE portfolio company boards also may meet monthly, and sometimes even weekly, for brief updates on the business. 3. When imagining the typical pyramid-shaped business structure, you can think about three rooms with stakeholders in the top room, the board in the middle room, and the executive management in the room at the base. With a family-owned company, there is a fourth room, the “family room,” that traverses all three levels of the pyramid, because family members can serve on the board, be shareholders, and they can be part of management. Board members need to understand the dynamic this creates. 4. For family-owned companies, it is important to understand “the family’s purpose.” For instance, is it long-term value creation or finding a buyer to provide liquidity to the family shareholders?\n\nD-8 before Sabine Matheson and I will present the Case Study \"Leading with transparency, regaining influence and impact as a minority co-shareholder\" at the FBN Global Summit 2023 ! Read the pitch : Several years after their merger with another big legal publisher, the result of which was the Lefebvre-Sarrut Group, European leader in legal, tax and regulatory knowledge, the Sarrut family, now a minority shareholder, realised they were facing new and different challenges. Sabine Matheson, granddaughter of the founders of “Les Editions Legislatives” and Vice-President of the Board of the group, thought it was time to act, for the sake of the family asset, family dynamics, and the business itself. Thanks to her transparent leadership, a new path was taken, involving all major stakeholders: the Sarrut family, the Sarrut holding and its administrators, the majority co-shareholder, and the board and leaders of the firm. This new, more efficient governance resulted in a clearer vision, raison d’être, and strategy. Great Key learnings ahead ! ✨ ELBConseil supported Sarrut in its process of defining a vision and raison d'être with the shareholders, writing a family charter and doing the evaluation of the board. ✨ #FBN #governance #transparency #leadership #coconstruction #fun\n\nThis is a spot-on assessment by Anjli Raval. The value of hiring consultants has always been access to knowledge, expertise, experience, and proven methodologies. A one-stop model waters down the value proposition and directly leads to the failed projects we now constantly read about in the news. In some ways, this is an example of consultants eating their own dog food. For decades, consulting firms peddled diversification as a solution to market downturns, slow growth, and revenue cyclicality. Remember, #consultants turned companies like GE into conglomerates that could supposedly build an aircraft engine with the same skills and experience needed to run a television network. Later, consultants advised companies like GE to divest non-core assets and win based on focus, specialization, and excellence. Many consulting firms are diversifying in the same way in an effort to maintain growth. Some consultancies may have started as accounting firms and grown into global consulting powerhouses. However, the leap from accounting to software development is not that different from the leap GE took when it went from designing wind turbines to writing television sitcom scripts. There is no better example of this than every firm's pivot towards #AI. A quick stroll through the Wayback Machine shows how many firms claiming deep AI expertise had precisely zero AI offerings or projects mentioned on their websites just a few years ago. Similarly, according to old bios and LinkedIn profiles, many of the anointed AI experts and thought leaders at these firms were working in unrelated fields as recently as two years ago. Clients are doing more Googling and reference checking, and it's becoming much harder to maintain the \"we are world-class experts in everything\" veneer. The more firms diversify offerings, the more clients look to proven niche experts. As the larger firms face slowdowns in growth, the smaller, more focused firms are seeing unprecedented demand.\n\nSo excited to share our latest research on professional services partners and what the top \"doer-sellers\" do differently in today's more competitive client buying environment. The article will appear in the Nov/Dec issue of Harvard Business Review but is available to download on the site now (link in comments below!). Lots of hard work by a large team of folks, and plenty of thanks to go around, starting with: Our truly world-class team here at DCM Insights. I'm so lucky to work and partner with Matt Dixon, Rory Channer, and Karen Freeman every day. I could write paragraphs praising Matt (again?!?) and Karen for their rare talents. Rory in particular has been out there working with partners and associates on business development for years and his expertise shaped the study in profound ways. Kevin Acker was our quant guru who put up with about a million emails from me. :) He is a real expert and the study benefitted tremendously through his work. Our UK managing director, Alexander Low, added and continues to add key industry and technology perspective. And we're thankful to have received early support and expertise from our longtime friend and colleague Lara Ponomareff. Scott Fitzgerald, Lavinia Calvert and the whole team at Intapp for their ongoing and enthusiastic support of this important research. It's rare to find partners like Scott who, more than two years ago, really saw the potential of a \"Challenger-style\" study of professional services partners. We were lucky to have interviewed and gained important perspective from visionary leaders at some amazing firms. In particular, I'd like to thank the nearly 1,800 partners who participated in the study and the 80+ top rainmakers who generously gave us their scarce time for interviews. Thanks also to the full team at Harvard Business Review, especially Juan Martinez and Christina Bortz. We're honored to be included and appreciate your help and support. If you'll be in NYC this Wednesday or San Francisco on the 26th there are launch events you can attend. Matt will also be presenting the research on a LinkedIn Livestream on 10/23. Message any of us at DCM Insights and we'll provide details. #professionalservices #consulting #investmentbanking #law #accounting #executivesearch #publicrelations #talentadvisory #businessdevelopment"
