        "text": "History\n\nWGMB was located in Georgetown, South Carolina for many years prior to a power increase from 3,000 to 50,000 watts. The station originally signed on the air as WINH-FM, a companion to WINH(AM) owned by the Winyah Bay Broadcasting Company in September 1971. In 1975 the station’s call letters changed to WGMB and became known as “98 Rock.” That slogan later changed to “Rock of the Bay” as the marketplace adopted digital tuners. For a brief time in the mid-1980s, the station was adult contemporary with the name WMXX \"Magic 97.7\", and the logo used on billboards resembled that of WMAG in High Point, North Carolina.\n\nAfter the station improved its signal, it was known as WBPR \"Power 98\" and had a rhythmic CHR format. Later the format moved in a more mainstream CHR direction. The change to the current name and call letters was made in the early 90s, and a hot adult contemporary format was used for several years. The signal was eventually improved to 100,000 watts and the city of license was moved to Garden City Beach.\n\nRoot Communications of Daytona Beach bought WWXM in a deal announced in June 1997 and moved it from Waccamaw Pottery to studios shared by WWSK and WGTR near the back gate of the former Myrtle Beach Air Force Base. As of 2000, Booger and Leanne Sullivan co-hosted the morning show. Qantum Communications Inc. purchased Myrtle Beach's Root Communications Group LP stations in 2003.\n\nWWXM aires The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show."
