        "text": "(김비서가 왜 그럴까 / Gimbiseoga Wae Geureolkka)\n\nMyDramaList rating: 8.5/10\n\nHello hello~ It’s drama review time~!\n\nThis time I watched a series which I have been looking forward to for a VERY long time and I actually skipped two other dramas to get to this one first because I simply couldn’t wait any longer, haha. I’m so glad I finally watched it and I have a lot of comments!\n\n(I can already spoil that this is going to be a very positive review haha)\n\nSo let’s not wait any longer and get right to it!\n\nHere we go~\n\nSo, I don’t think I need to explain why this drama was on my list to begin with. If you have to ask, I love both the main actors, Park Seo Joon and Park Min Young. I think they are great actors and great people (I love Min Young in the Netflix detective variety show Busted!, she’s so incredibly charming and super smart!) So that was enoughj reason for me to put it on my list.\n\nI do have to say that I thought the story would be a little different, but I’ll get to that after writing a simple summary.\n\nWhat’s Wrong With Secretary Kim? is a 16-episode drama (so oldschool-style, 16 episodes with a duration of about 1 hour each) about the Vice Chairman of Yumyung Group, a large corporation, Lee Young Joon (played by Park Seo Joon). He is known to be very picky and also slightly narcissistic. His secretary, Kim Mi So (played by Park Min Young) has been with him for 9 years in which she’s had to answer to his every demand. Although she started out awkward, she has now become the person Young Joon depends on the most since she knows all the ins and outs and doesn’t even have to be asked for certain tasks anymore since it’s all become a habitual routine for her. Young Joon honestly wouldn’t know what he’d do without her. And then, out of the blue, Secretary Kim suddenly announces that she’d like to quit. Completely thrown off, Young Joon starts looking for reasons that might be the cause of this decision and he decides it must be because she likes him and cannot continue to work besides him anymore because of her feelings/she can’t stand it when he spends time with other women. So he takes it on himself to woo her, without knowing Mi So’s side of the story.\n\nThis is how the story starts, and in this phase we are led to think that this is just a clueless arrogant Vice Chairman that wants to keep his trusted Secretary by his side no matter what. And this was also what I thought the drama would be mostly about, about him guessing the reason she wants to quit and with her remaining kind of a mystery. But that wasn’t the case.\n\nBecause from Mi So’s side, it becomes quite clear why she wants to quit and this has everything to do with her backstory.\n\nAnyways, as Young Joon suddenly starts throwing stuff at her like ‘I’ll marry you so you won’t have to quit your job and can stay by my side forever’, she’s put off by it in the beginning.\n\nBut there’s something else that will bring them together, and when that is revealed everything suddenly gets a different twist, a different kind of load.\n\nLet me explain by placing both Young Joon and Mi So’s background stories next to each other.\n\nYoung Joon was born as the youngest son of the Yumyung Group Chairman, he has one older brother, Sung Yeon (played by Lee Tae Hwan). Young Joon is a kid genius, he is way smarter than other children of his age so he skips a couple of years in school and gets into the same school as his four year older brother. Older brother doesn’t really like that his younger brother gets all the attention and starts bullying him a little. This bullying escalates on a day when Sung Yeon leaves Young Joon on a deserted street under the pretense that he’s going to buy some drinks for them (but he just leaves him there). Young Joon then is kidnapped by a crazy lady. For three days, Young Joon is kept inside a creepy abandoned house before he manages to escape.\n\nMi So was only 5 years old when her mother gets sick (and eventually passes away). Her father, a man with a passion for rock music, leaves her and her two older sisters alone at home to spend the night at the hospital. Mi So wakes up in the middle of the night and thinks she sees her mom outside so she runs after her. This woman turns out to be the same crazy lady that kidnapped Young Joon, and she lures the little girl with her under the pretense that she’ll help her find her mom. As a result, little Young Joon and little Mi So are kept inside that house where, at the end of the day, the crazy lady hangs herself in front of them.\n\nYoung Joon witnesses this and does everything he can to make sure Mi So doesn’t. He tells Mi So that it’s not the crazy lady hanging there, but a big spider that she can’t look at no matter what.\n\nAs a result of this cognitive error, Mi So later on develops arachnophobia.\n\nThe two manage to escape and Young Joon brings Mi So back to her house, where he promises that he’ll come back to visit her, but on the way home he himself is hit by what happened and he wakes up in the hospital, traumatized.\n\nSo, this is an event that has already bound the two together, even though Mi So can’t remember everything since she was only 5 years old at the time. She does remember that there is a boy she needs to find and her search for him is one of the reasons she wants to quit her job and start living her own life. Although she can’t remember his name clearly.\n\nOn the other hand, Young Joon still has nightmares – whenever he closes his eyes he is haunted by images of the crazy lady, and because his feet were bound with cable ties during the kidnapping, he has developed a trauma for cable ties. The scars on his ankles are also still there.\n\nSlowly but surely, Mi So starts finding little clues that lead her to think that Young Joon might actually be the boy from her past. However, then she is led astray because of his brother Sung Yeon, who is now a famous writer under the pen name Morpheus. In his newest book, he describes a scene that is almost identical to the images she remembers and when she confronts him, he himself also admits that he was kidnapped, although he doesn’t remember her being there.\n\nThis was probably the part that confused me the most for the longest time. It was almost clear by Young Joon’s behavior that he was the one who had been kidnapped, and that he had a good reason for hating his brother, but then suddenly his older brother was also hating him for some reason and was also claiming that he had been kidnapped.\n\nIn the end, it turns out that Sung Yeon has altered his own memory as a result of the guilt he felt as a child when he found out what had happened to his younger brother after he had abandoned him on that street. He altered his memory after visiting the house Young Joon had been kept at and this caused him to think that he himself had been the one that had been kidnapped and that Young Joon had been the one who left him there.\n\nYoung Joon, who still remembered everything, was extremely put off by this and the two brothers starting fighting a lot. But one time Young Joon finds out how much his parents are also suffering because of Sung Yeon’s ‘temporary’ confusion and he decides to pretend to pass out and wake up without any memories of the incident. He goes along with the story that his brother was the one who had been kidnapped because of him, to give his family some peace and to decrease the things they had to worry about even by a little. Also, because Young Joon was born as Sung Hyun, a name really close in pronunciation to his older brother’s, he changed his name to Young Joon to decrease his brother’s confusion as well. As everyone kept talking about Sung Hyun being kidnapped, Sung Yeon misheard this as his own name, which strengthened his belief that it had happened to him.\n\nIt seems complicated, but I really like how they came up with this. I think it was a really clever and well-thought decision to build the whole situation on the cognitive errors of a child. For Mi So, it was the same. Not only with the spider, but with her trying to remember the name of the boy who had helped her. She comes as far as ‘Lee Sung…’ and thus she easily accepts it has to be Lee Sung Yeon. However, when things don’t add up (his mother also gives her some information that makes her think again), she comes up with the idea that it may have been a false memory.\n\nHis mother asks her to tell her what exactly happened to ‘our Hyun’.\n\nIt just shows how sharp Mi So is, to make the link all by herself. I mean, she figures out Young Joon’s name used to be Sung Hyun all by herself.\n\nCan I just take this moment in-between to give a huge shoutout to the 3 child actors that portrayed young Mi So, young Sung Hyun and young Sung Yeon? I mean, I was blown away by their performances. They were no older than 11, yet all of them acted so incredibly! Little Mi So (played by Kim Ji Yoo, who was only 8 at the time) was so freaking adorable and so credible in portraying a 5-year old! I discovered Moon Woo Jin, who plays young Sung Hyun, was also in a couple of other dramas I’ve seen, but he acted so maturely for an 11-year old! And the same went for Bae Kang Yoo, who played little Sung Yeon. It seems so difficult for a young child to be able to act like he’s suffering from a psychological trauma, but they did so incredibly well! I really hope they grow up to become splendid actors if they are already so talented!\n\nSo, now that I’ve already covered the heaviest part of the drama, let’s focus on the cute, fun and romantic parts, because there were a lot! And once the whole trauma background story was revealed and concluded and everyone made up with each other, all that was left was just enjoying everything.\n\nThe chemistry between Park Seo Joon and Park Min Young as the main characters was S I Z Z L I N G. I actually started feeling warm watching them. And although there were some mishaps and interruptions (still can’t get over the scene where he pushed her away in the chair), when they finally got together their kissing scenes were amazing. So passionate yet so tender, so mature! It was very satisfying to watch (is this a weird thing to say? I don’t care haha).\n\nAlthough there were some moments that I agreed with Mi So, in which he did kind of ‘bulldozer’ his way into her life. He did have a habit of forgetting that she wasn’t used to all the rich world stuff and that she wasn’t completely comfortable with it, either. But in those moments she also reprimanded him (girl powerr) and they always came through in the end. It was so wholesome. Everytime they realized their own mistakes and they always made up. And their wedding T^T they looked so perfect!!\n\nAs we’re on the topic of couples, I gotta say some things about the work team at Yumyung Group, since they were important side characters.\n\nI liked the scenes with the team since they were all really funny, but I think in the end my favorites were the ones that got together.\n\nKim Ji Ah (played by Pyo Ye Jin) was hired as Mi So’s replacement for when she quits. (Another ‘Secretary Kim’.) She’s very cutesy and motivated, but at the same time also quite sharp to what’s happening around her.\n\nI have to admit, in the first 2 episodes, Bong Se Ra (played by Hwang Bo Ra) really annoyed me. Just how everything about her was so overly exaggerated and it felt like she was excessively trying to be funny that it was a little too much? And also how she was so mean to Ji Ah in the beginning. But eventually she really turned out to be a good person.\n\nI really liked when Se Ra and Ji Ah stood up to some mean girls gossipping about the relationship between Young Joon and Mi So.\n\nThis was extra annoying because we had just found out about their whole shared trauma and backstory together, so then hearing some people say Mi So used her looks to work her way up to becoming a secretary (suggesting she seduced Young Joon to get the job) was really frustrating. But then those two stood up for ‘our Mi So’ and won the mop fight.\n\nThe team leader, Mr. Jung (played by Lee Yoo Joon) was super funny, those faces he pulled! Then there was the guy who kept competing for Young Joon’s favor and the girl who loved eating (big mood). And the intern.\n\nAnd then there was Go Gui Nam (played by Hwang Chan Sung), the company’s ‘most handsome hard-working guy’ who seemed like a bit of weirdo at first because he literally didn’t care about anything besides work. I like that they created this little love story between him and Ji Ah, it didn’t get in the way of the main storyline and it was just nice to have some in-between light romance. Although it didn’t become real romance until the end, because they first didn’t really like each other. But when they started liking each other it was super cute. And I really appreciated Ji Ah’s speech to him that he also needed to focus on loving himself and not just caring about work whilst neglecting his own health. That was powerful.\n\nAnd Driver Yang (played by Kang Hong Suk), to finish it off. I really like this actor for some reason because he is such a big guy but he always acts so cute, lol. He was the ultimate gentleman and it was so funny to see Se Ra fall for him and they’re interactions were hilarious.\n\nI also have to mention Young Joon’s friend Park Yoo Shik (played by Kang Ki Young) who was working at the same company. I really like this actor. He is not only actually a really good actor but he is so freaking hilarious, I always laugh at loud at his facial expressions and timing. He doesn’t get a lot of serious roles because of his comical talent, but he was really outstanding in this drama as well, with the whole thing going on with his ex-wife and everything. And Secretary Seol (played by Kim Ye Won), his secretary, who was the opposite of Mi So, and screwed up literally everything. She was hilarious too. And it’s nice that he kept her by his side even though he was fully aware of her lacking abilities.\n\nThere were so many fun characters in this show! I really appreciated the balance they created between the comical, romantic, and angsty scenes.\n\nEveryone performed really well. I also really liked Mi So’s sisters, Pil Nam (Baek Eun Hye) and Mal Hee (Heo Soon Mi), they were such a nice trio of caring sisters.\n\nAlso!! LOVED that they chose Lee Min Ki and Jung So Min!! the couple from Because This Is My First Life!! as the younger versions of Mi So’s parents in the flashback!! I was so happy to see them back as a couple.\n\nNow that I look back, BTIMFL was filmed only a year before this one, so they might have still been fresh in the director’s memory haha. Loved that.\n\nAnd lastly I’ll mention the parents, because they were very important pillars in the series as well. And finally, there were no strict parents that sabotaged the relationship! I mean, Mi So’s father pretended to, but it all ended in a good way. Everyone got along and it was all good and well.\n\nI’m really glad I finally watched this. Now I can finally talk about it with my friend who recommended this to me about 5 times (which also made me decide to skip ahead to it this time). I think they build up the story really well. They had all these plot lines, but they managed to fit them all in equally, nothing was rushed, nothing felt like it was too much, everything made sense. They took the right amount of needed time to cover the whole past trauma story, and everything was explained in a nice and calm pace.\n\nI really liked it, there were so many parts that made me squeal out loud and other parts that made me almost tear up. And everyone got their happy ending! Even Yoo Shik got back with his ex-wife, one big party.\n\nI believe that I’ve already covered most of the cast while I was describing the characters, but let me just say something final about the main actors.\n\nPARK SEO JOON. Need I say more? This guy can do anything. I do admit that when I first saw a trailer of this drama I was a bit concerned because he looked really skinny compared to what I’ve seen of him last – Fight For My Way. I have really liked him as a buff guy so far, so I had to get used to him as a kind skinny ‘flower boy’ guy. But he made my heart skip a few beats during the series. He is such a versatile actor and I can’t wait to watch Itaewon Class, because there his character is like the opposite of Young Joon and more closer to his role Fight For My Way, I think.\n\nPARK MIN YOUNG. This woman is so incredibly stunning?! I’m really becoming more and more of a fan. After also seeing her in Busted, I’m also convinced she’s super cool in real life and so clever and she also has shown many different sides to her acting. She was like a Barbie doll in this series, with her perfect figure and her perfect ponytail (seriously, anyone else shook by the flawlessness of her ponytail??). And still, she is such a strong woman. I really want to watch her most recent drama, I believe it’s called ‘When the Weather is Nice’? Or something like that. Gotta watch!\n\nAnd I know Lee Tae Hwan from some other series as well. Wasn’t he the bodyguard friend in W – Two Worlds as well? And one of the high school friends in King of High School Conduct? (< in this last one he also acted with Kang Ki Young (and Seo In Guk ofc <3) – this drama was only 6 years ago and they were actually playing high school students, I mean imagine that.)\n\nI like his face! Haha. In the beginnin Sung Yeon seemed to be kind of the threatening second male lead, but after learning what happened to him as a child and how he guilt-tripped himself into believing he had gone through that instead of his brother, I couldn’t hate him. And in the end he was such a cinnamon roll? He deserves more prominent roles."
