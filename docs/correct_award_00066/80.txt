Frans Emil Sillanpää is probably Finland’s most well known writer who was awarded the

Nobel Prize for literature in 1939 and who beat Herman Hesse and Johan Huizinga to the

Vote. He was born into a peasant family in Hämeenkyrö at Myllykolu croft village. His

Father Frans Henrik Koskinen was an impoverished labourer while his mother Louiisa

Vilhelmina Koskinen was a servant. Although poor they managed to send their son to

Tampere grammar school, where he faired well.

In later years he became a heavy drinker and also adopted the ideas of the so called

‘YOUNG FINLAND MOVEMENT’. He saw man as a small and important part of the

Universe and shared the theory about the unity of all nature and the land and how

Dependant they were on the sun to bring life and energy into their lives.

Sillanpää gained international recognition in 1931 when NUORENA NUKKUNUT,

Were (The Maid Silja) was translated into English. The story depicts the loss of a farm

And an entire family, which ends with the farmers daughter dying. He died in 1964.

The house of his birth still stands in Myllykolu and is now a museum, which one can visit all year round although the house closes in September until the spring. During the summer though,

At the back of the property plays of his life and stories are acted out on a rustic stage with

Amphitheater next to the river.
