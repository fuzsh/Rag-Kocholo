        "text": "‘I Am A Finn,’ James Tate\n\nI am standing in the post office, about to mail a package back to Minnesota, to my family. I am a Finn. My name is Kasteheimi (Dewdrop). Mikael Agricola (1510-1557) created the Finnish language. He knew Luther and translated the New Testament. When I stop by the Classé Café for a cheeseburger no one suspects that I am a Finn. I gaze at the dimestore reproductions of Lautrec on the greasy walls, at the punk lovers afraid to show their quivery emotions, secure in the knowledge that my grandparents really did emigrate from Finland in 1910 – why is everybody leaving Finland, hundreds of thousands to Michigan and Minnesota, and now Australia? Eighty-six percent of Finnish men have blue or grey eyes. Today is Charlie Chaplin’s one hundredth birthday, though he is not Finnish or alive: ‘Thy blossom, in the bud laid low.’ The commonest fur-bearing animals are the red squirrel, musk-rat, pine-marten and fox. There are about 35,000 elk. But I should be studying for my exam. I wonder if Dean will celebrate with me tonight, assuming I pass. Finnish Literature really came alive in the 1860s. Here, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, no one cares that I am a Finn. They’ve never even heard of Frans Eemil Sillanpää, winner of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Literature. As a Finn, this infuriates me.\n\nJames Tate (1943--2015) was an American poet, born in Kansas City, Missouri. His first book, The Lost Pilot, was published in 1967 while Tate was still a student at the University of Iowa’s Writer Workshop. After graduating, Tate taught creative writing, teaching at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1971 onwards. James Tate passed away on July 8th, and I confess I had forgotten about Tate’s poetry until I read about his death, and took a morbid joy in rediscovering his writing. Tate was equally influence by the conversational and colloquial poetry of William Carlos Williams and the surreal and startling poetry of Benjamin Péret, and this infusion rings out in his writing. ‘I Am A Finn,’ from Tate’s 1990 collection Distance from Loved Ones is a favourite Tate poem of mine for the way it perfectly infuses humour and the philosophy of poetry without diminishing from either. The speaker, Kasteheimi is wholly realized, a lively and surprisingly relatable character.\n\nA neurotic, the key to Kasteheimi comes in the line ‘But I should be studying for my exam.’ Tate has the confidence to let the reader wait for this line, and uses the rhythm and structure of the poem to make it simultaneously stand out and be unremarkable. The numerous references to Finns and Finland are paradoxically unconscious distractions from his real concern about his exam results (and therefore, his future) which we find out in ‘I Am Still A Finn,’ he has failed. Kasteheimi’s constant reassurance that he is still a Finn could therefore be seen as a point of comfort; that he will fail his exams because he is a Finn in America, where they do not appreciate Finnish literature. Moreover, he is attempting to find a point of pride to soothe a hurt ego. However there is also a beautiful metafictional game being played. The title is almost taunting--we are well aware that James Tate is not a Finn. The facts that Kasteheimi brings up about Finnish people are superficial: ‘Eighty-six percent of Finnish men have blue / or grey eyes.’ Tate draws us in and pushes us out with his weaving of poetical language and plain prose, creating humour in the understood gap between the narrator and the writer. The final stanza almost dares us to believe him: ‘They’ve never even heard of Frans Eemil Sillanpää, / winner of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Literature. / As a Finn, this infuriates me.’ Kasteheimi is obsessed with his identity, but the poem inherently undermines him at every step; and therefore calls to question our own ways in which we write our identity. There are three people in this poem--Kasteheimi, Tate-Kasteheimi, and Tate alone as the author--and all combine to create the identity of Kasteheimi that we as an audience then interpret.\n\n‘I Am Still A Finn’ therefore ridicules both the act of reading a poem, and the stability of identity. But it is still a joyful, exciting and pleasurable poem to read--there is an adventure in both acts that forces us to take part, regardless of its possible irrationality.\n\n‘The Autumn Outings,’ Maurice Rutherford\n\nThat autumn I was quick getting away: only about one-twenty on the rain-drenched Wednesday I locked the premises and motored out, all staff sent home, all workshop plant closed down, all sense of any kind of business gone, and not until I'd driven fifteen miles along fast-flooding roads back into town, past rival complexes just clinging on, did rain let up and vision clear: those files\n\nI'd never see again; that desk, the phone that shrilled all day when first it was installed; not hear the moan compressors made, be soothed by lathes, nor say 'Good morning George, alright?', or 'Nice one, Bert', the human touch, no more, not to distract them too long from their work, but just enough to let them see I cared, and not to hurt old feelings as I tried to breast the fact of cancelled orders, creditors turned rough.\n\nThe friendly bank soon bared its teeth – drew blood; and then that bane, the Tax Man, claimed his pound. And so, the flood. (fine detail dims again as, too, the pain recedes three autumns on; yet loss stays true.) The rain comes vicious now – wipers full speed, dipped headlights on, rear fogs – the journey seems to lengthen every time I live it through, involuntarily, as when the need for sleep is scuppered by recurring dreams.\n\nMy crowd was breast-fed clichés, meal on meal: to pull its weight, nose to the grindstone, shoulder to the wheel, and, once it stepped inside the factory gate, was wedded to its work; slapped all the time by Newbolt's hand: Play up, and play the game. Well, this sounds fine; but what about the bloke who's anorexic, short-nosed, cannot climb to reach the wheel, and never makes the team? For him such wedding tales are guffs of smoke.\n\nAgain the morning paper hits the floor – banner headlined PIT CLOSURES SHOCK – and umpteen thousand more are facing broken marriages to mines. A few, lured by that bit-of-fresh, fool's gold, pin hopes on boarding-houses, market-stalls; one man sits out his protest down the pit, while lefties call for strikes with all the old clenched-fist salutes, and aerosol the walls: SCARGILL FOR KING and TARZAN IS A SHIT.\n\nTheir first few days of idleness will see in those it hits undreamed-of traits in personality: some will get by and others go to bits; the strong become the weak, the weak make good as quickly as it's said. Then, as the days stack up to months or, as in my case, years, high principles get trampled in the mud where guile and self-survival point new ways to quick back-pocket jobs, fiddles and fears\n\nof being caught. But fears will yield, in time, a sort of pride, though not the social pride that saw men climb from old-world swamps: a sense that one's defied the odds, the system; finger-licked the crème, nose-thumbed some top brass, bested those who made the rules and all the running. What survives? Of Us: too early yet to tell. Of Them: 'Indifferents and Incapables'; their trade in UB40s and P45s.\n\nIn brass-lined boardrooms up and down the land deep in regret a million more redundancies get planned, while chairmen's hiked-up salaries are set, and Urban Councils chase arrears in rents. Wide-boys, insider-dealers, some M.P.s grow richer by a second home in Spain, a custom-plated white Mercedes Benz, that new portfolio. True-blue disease. The spores of loss, somewhere becoming gain.\n\nMaurice Rutherford (1922--) is a British poet, born in Hull, currently living in Bridlington. He worked for many years as a technical writer in the ship-building industries in Hull.\n\n‘The Autumn Outings,’ from Rutherford’s 1994 collection Love is a Four-Letter World, directly references Monday’s poem, Philip Larkin’s ‘The Whitsun Weddings’. The intertextuality of the poem is unusual, though: it is not a parody, nor even a pastiche; instead, it is as if Rutherford uses Larkin’s poem as a seed text to begin his own meditation.\n\nIf there is a link between the poems--beyond the replicated structure and key phrases such as ‘all staff sent home, all workshop plant closed down, / all sense of any kind of business gone’ (’ All windows down, all cushions hot, all sense / Of being in a hurry gone.’)--it is in the theme of distancing.\n\nIn Larkin’s poem, it is the speaker who is distanced from the people he observes; capitalizing on this vantage point he observes the way all people are fatally connected. But Rutherford is far closer to his subjects, and speaks of them in affectionate terms: ‘umpteen thousand more / are facing broken marriages to mines.’ From the very beginning he is consumed with sympathy for his fellow works.\n\nInstead, the distance is between the managers and the workers, and the consequences are catastrophic. The final two stanzas are a condemnation of the indifference of managers and politicians who are more concerned with abstract figures than the reality of their decisions--however, Rutherford is clever in not making this a blind polemic but suggesting it is a consequence of the adversarial system they exist in: ‘a sense that one's defied / the odds, the system.’\n\nThis finally culminates in ‘The spores of loss, somewhere becoming gain,’ a line that somewhat has an irony to it: the distance between manager and worker is false; the effects are real and long-reaching. By utilizing Larkin’s poem, Rutherford is able to examine other aspects of postmodernism and the complex systems of hierarchy which exist within it.\n\n‘The Whitsun Weddings,’ Philip Larkin\n\nThat Whitsun, I was late getting away: Not till about One-twenty on the sunlit Saturday Did my three-quarters-empty train pull out, All windows down, all cushions hot, all sense Of being in a hurry gone. We ran Behind the backs of houses, crossed a street Of blinding windscreens, smelt the fish-dock; thence The river's level drifting breadth began, Where sky and Lincolnshire and water meet. All afternoon, through the tall heat that slept For miles inland, A slow and stopping curve southwards we kept. Wide farms went by, short-shadowed cattle, and Canals with floatings of industrial froth; A hothouse flashed uniquely: hedges dipped And rose: and now and then a smell of grass Displaced the reek of buttoned carriage-cloth Until the next town, new and nondescript, Approached with acres of dismantled cars. At first, I didn't notice what a noise The weddings made Each station that we stopped at: sun destroys The interest of what's happening in the shade, And down the long cool platforms whoops and skirls I took for porters larking with the mails, And went on reading. Once we started, though, We passed them, grinning and pomaded, girls In parodies of fashion, heels and veils, All posed irresolutely, watching us go, As if out on the end of an event Waving goodbye To something that survived it. Struck, I leant More promptly out next time, more curiously, And saw it all again in different terms: The fathers with broad belts under their suits And seamy foreheads; mothers loud and fat; An uncle shouting smut; and then the perms, The nylon gloves and jewellery-substitutes, The lemons, mauves, and olive-ochres that Marked off the girls unreally from the rest. Yes, from cafés And banquet-halls up yards, and bunting-dressed Coach-party annexes, the wedding-days Were coming to an end. All down the line Fresh couples climbed aboard: the rest stood round; The last confetti and advice were thrown, And, as we moved, each face seemed to define Just what it saw departing: children frowned At something dull; fathers had never known Success so huge and wholly farcical; The women shared The secret like a happy funeral; While girls, gripping their handbags tighter, stared At a religious wounding. Free at last, And loaded with the sum of all they saw, We hurried towards London, shuffling gouts of steam. Now fields were building-plots, and poplars cast Long shadows over major roads, and for Some fifty minutes, that in time would seem Just long enough to settle hats and say I nearly died, A dozen marriages got under way. They watched the landscape, sitting side by side --An Odeon went past, a cooling tower, And someone running up to bowl - and none Thought of the others they would never meet Or how their lives would all contain this hour. I thought of London spread out in the sun, Its postal districts packed like squares of wheat: There we were aimed. And as we raced across Bright knots of rail Past standing Pullmans, walls of blackened moss Came close, and it was nearly done, this frail Travelling coincidence; and what it held stood ready to be loosed with all the power That being changed can give. We slowed again, And as the tightened brakes took hold, there swelled A sense of falling, like an arrow-shower Sent out of sight, somewhere becoming rain.\n\nPhilip Larkin (1922--1985) was an English poet, novelist and librarian. Disqualified for military service due to his poor eyesight, he begun his English degree at Oxford University in 1940 and graduated three years later, taking up a librarian position in in Wellington, Shropshire.\n\nAfter a five-year stint as librarian at Queen’s University Belfast, Larkin became the University Librarian at the University of Hull, a position he held until his death; Larkin is often admired as much for his librarianship as his writing. Larkin is often characterised as a traditionalist, holding out against the wave of Modernism, but his distinctive voice is built upon contemporary language and turns of phrase, and a pessimistic, ironic which captured post-war British attitudes.\n\nIn ‘The Whitsun Weddings,’ Larkin recounts a train journey he took--presumably from Kingston-upon-Hull to London--and a procession of wedding parties he sees upon a train platform along the way. ‘Whitsun’ refers to a Christian holiday which occurs seven weeks after Easter; before 1978 in the UK ‘Whit Monday’ was a bank holiday, making the weekend popular for travel and weddings.\n\nLarkin is slow to get to the weddings; he first etches out glimpses of the countryside and railside towns. Away from the ‘hurry’ of the city we get a sense of yearning for the pastoral scenes, still tainted by ‘the reek of buttoned carriage-cloth.’ An uneasy continuity is formed between the city and countryside, with the train threading together the two sets of images.\n\nWhen the wedding parties do enter it is with vibrant clashes of vision and sound: ‘fathers...with seamy foreheads; mothers loud and fat; / an uncle shouting smut...The lemons, mauves and olive-ochres that / Marked off the girls unreally from the rest.’ Larkin’s vocabulary is concise and evocative, bringing to life the chaotic bustle of emotions as several newly-weds board the train.\n\nLarkin realises that although there are many wedding parties at the station, the couples are focused only on themselves: ‘And none / Thought of the others they would never meet / Or how their lives would all contain this hour.’ An observer on the train, flitting between towns, Larkin occupies a liminal space where only he is able to see the connections between the groups and the ‘frail travelling coincidence.’\n\nBut despite the slight derision with which Larkin views the ‘farcical’ scenes, this is not a tragic moment. Alluding to Cupid’s arrows, he imagines the ‘power’ of this moment being loosed, creating a fertile and cleansing rain ‘out of sight.’ From his privileged position as a poet, Larkin is able to realise the redeeming power of change, progress and life.\n\n‘Jasmine,’ John Eppel\n\nWhen they cried freedom, when the sweet mingling of woodsmoke and jasmine with dust – grass, granite, antelope bone – gathered into wrists which turned\n\nlight the colour of blood, darkness a memory of the colour of blood – when their voices lifted that song and sent it echoing\n\nacross Africa, I knew it. Sibanda had taught it to me, polishing the family's shoes, squatting outside the scullery\n\ndoor. We both wore khaki trousers many sizes too big; no shirt, no shoes. I spat on the toecaps while he brushed: and while he brushed\n\nwe sang: 'Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika…' over and over till the birds joined in. August birds. '… Maluphakanisw' udumo lwayo …' *\n\nIt comes back to me, this August, now that the jasmine is blooming and the air is stilled by woodsmoke; how they cried freedom, and how I\n\nknew their song. A lingering chill pinches Zimbabwean sunsets into the cheeks of my children squatting beside me as I write.\n\nIt is their song too. I teach it to them, over and over, till my tired eyes are pricked with tears held back, sweet smoke, dust and jasmine.\n\n*\"God bless Africa … Raise up her spirit.\"\n\nJohn Eppel (1947--) is an African poet, born in Lydenburg, South Africa. His miner father moved the family to Colleen Bawn in Zimbabwe when Eppel was 4, and he currently teaches English in Bulawayo.\n\nFlowers are a common image in Eppel’s poetry, as seen in this example from his 1995 collection Sonata for Matabeleland. He has meditated on different flowers in his ‘Flower Poems’ series, and often uses them as a symbol of hope or tranquility as in his poem ‘Star of Bethlehem’ where he recalls finding the eponymous flower as a soldier “and stuffed it in my combat / jacket on top of a phosphorous bomb.”\n\nHowever, in ‘Jasmine’ it is not clear that the flower unambiguously represents hope. As we first delve into the poem there is a rush of images which impressionistically flow into one another: the ‘sweet / mingling of woodsmoke and jasmine’ morphs into ‘wrists [which turn] light the colour of blood.’ The images of darkness and violence all spring from the cry of ‘freedom’ which opens the poem but we are not allowed to make easy judgments about this cry, and are constantly unsettled by the shifting meter and enjambment.\n\nAs we are introduced to the main memory of the poem, however, the images solidify a little and a calmer meter takes precedence. ‘I knew it. / Sibanda had taught it to me.’ Assuming the speaker is white like Eppel, we are given an image of two lower-class boys, wearing identical clothes, sharing the work of polishing shoes. Sibanda teaches the speaker the pan-Africa anthem ‘Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrica’ and they seem to regard each other as equals. But we also know the relative privileges of each boy and the massive societal changes which will occur after this memory.\n\nIs there a bitterness to the image of woodsmoke and jasmine mingling? The speaker remembers ‘how they cried freedom, and how I / knew their song.’ Implied is that this freedom never came to the speaker and even as he teaches, still speaks as that boy polishing the family’s shoes.\n\nHowever, as the jasmine returns for the third time we see that it is still hopeful, and progressive. The speaker continues to teach the song of liberation and believes in the message of freedom for all: ‘my tired eyes are pricked with tears / held back, sweet smoke, dust and jasmine.’ Ending the poem, we see that the jasmine and woodsmoke have transcendental qualities which cross beyond memory, tying in the speaker’s experiences and his love for the people of Zimbabwe.\n\n‘And Then It Was Less Bleak Because We Said So,’ Wendy Xu\n\nToday there has been so much talk of things exploding into other things, so much that we all become curious, that we all run outside into the hot streets and hug. Romance is a grotto of eager stones anticipating light, or a girl whose teeth you can always see. With more sparkle and pop is the only way to live. Your confetti tongue explodes into acid jazz. There are small typewriters that other people keep in their eyes clicking away at all of our farewell parties. It is hard to pack for the rest of your life. Someone is always eating cold cucumber noodles. Someone will drop by later to help dismantle some furniture. A lot can go wrong if you sleep or think, but the trees go on waving their silly little hands.\n\nWendy Xu (1987--) is a Chinese-born, American raised poet currently living in Brooklyn, New York. She studied at the University of Iowa and the University of Massachusetts Amherst and has published one collection of poetry, You Are Not Dead.\n\nXu typically writes one stanza’d, almost prose-like poems that uses line breaks and sudden juxtaposition to oscillate between the personal and the public--and explore the meaning of this in the 21st Century. Themes of artificiality and alienation are prominent in her poetry. ‘And Then It Was Less Bleak’ has this at the (literal) centre of the poem: ‘There are small typewriters / that other people keep in their eyes.’\n\nXu has said of poetry: ‘I think language is always waiting patiently on us to engage it, to play with it and arrange its parts, to build something weird out of it ...’. I think we can see how she applies this to her poetry here in the bombardment of images and sensations she throws at the reader: ‘Romance is a grotto of eager stones / anticipating light, or a girl whose teeth / you can always see.’ There is a refusal to contemplate these images, and the combination of short declarative sentences and consistent enjambment creates a belting pace that calls to mind the information overload of modern media culture.\n\nHowever, while lesser poets attempting a similar style can overreach--with paper-thin, overly mawkish and romanticised images--Xu is clever with her word choices and line break decisions. Here, she opens with imagery that calls to mind war or acts of terrorism (‘Today there has been so much talk of things exploding’) but this is quickly situated at a distance from the speaker (’we all become curious, that we / all run outside into the hot streets’). With the striking first line hanging over the poem, the rest of the narrative focuses on finding a real meaning in life while indirectly participating or benefiting from invasions of third-world country (which reminds me of John Forbes ‘Love Poem’). But there remain constant reminders of violence throughout the poem: ‘sparkle and pop’, ‘confetti tongue explodes’.\n\nThe speaker desires some stability or progression in life--’It is hard / to pack for the rest of your life’--but the split lines themselves seem to undermine this desire, as if the deep contradiction that makes their life possible also prevent it from having a true spiritual meaning: ‘A lot can go wrong / if you sleep or think...’. It is through this logical if erratic narrative that Xu’s imagery bombardment still manages to resonate, the final line cut short as if to invite the breath of relief, the moment of contemplation. It also gives us a chance to revisit the title, which starting mid-sentence as it does could even be added onto the end of the poem: a defiant but ironic shout that suggests we must take an active part in traversing the contractions of late capital.\n\n‘Rites of Passage: II,’ Robert Duncan\n\nSomething is taking place. Horns thrust upward from the brow. Hooves beat impatient where feet once were. My Son, youth grows alarming in your face. Your innocent regard is cruelly charming to me now. You bristle where my fond hand would stir to stroke your cheek--I do not dare. Irregular meters beat between your heart and mine. Snuffling the air you take the heat and scan the lines you take in going as if I were or were not there, and overtake me, and where it seems but yesterday I spilld the wine, you too grow beastly to become a man. Peace, peace. I’ve had enough. What can I say when song’s demanded. I’ve had my fill of song? My longing to sing grows full. Time’s emptied me. And where my youth was, now the Sun in you grows hot, your day is young, my place you take triumphantly. All along, it’s been for you, for this lowering of your horns, She had Her will of me and will not let my struggling spirit in itself be free.\n\nRobert Duncan (1919--1988) was an American poet, most identified with the Black Mountain College (despite only spending a small time at the school). Born in Oakland, California, he was adopted and raised by a Theosophist couple as the conditions of his birth met their prophetic demands. An anarchist and open homosexual, Duncan was a prominent figure in pre-Stonewall gay culture and his essay The Homosexual in Society is considered a landmark of gay history.\n\n‘Rites of Passage: II’ comes from Duncan’s 1984 collection Ground Work: Before the War. It is part of a serial poem titled ‘Poems from the Margins of Thom Gunn’s Moly’ and is a recontextualising of Gunn’s poem ‘Rites of Passage,’ which we discussed on Monday. (As an aside, the collection I first found this poem in was published in 1974--featured on the behest of Gunn alongside his poem. Duncan deliberately did not publish work between 1969--1984 but did pass around chapbooks during this time; very little of the poem changed before Ground Work aside from a linebreak inserted after ‘overtake me’.)\n\nWhile Gunn’s poem seems very personal, Duncan’s is far more public: possibly a knowing joke considering it was literally written in the margins of Gunn’s published collection. Puns on poetic composition such as ‘Irregular meters’ and ‘scan / the lines’ highlight the differences between Gunn’s restrained formal poetry and Duncan’s free verse, while also drawing attention to the poem’s artificiality.\n\nDuncan recontextualises Gunn’s poem to have the father as the speaker, and it is interesting to see how this changes the meaning of ‘Rites of Passage.’ Gunn’s speaker is rebellious, wild and angry; Duncan’s is sentimental (’where my fond hand would stir / to stroke would cheek’), somewhat regretful (’My longing to sing grows full’), but also hopeful (’my place you take triumphantly’). Duncan’s lines are longer but far more of them have a regular rhythm and there is hardly any enjambment until the final stanza, giving the voice a feeling of measure and wisdom.\n\nThe third stanza is the heart of the poem, with its major caesuras and enjambment creating a shift from the opening meditation to the final hopes: ‘Peace, peace. I’ve had enough. What can I say / when song’s demanded. I’ve had my fill of song?’. It draws our attention to a subtler pun: ‘passage’ meaning a journey but also an artistic movement in song or poem. Coming in at the end of the sequence ‘Poems from the Margins...’ it seems to suggest much like Gunn’s poem that change is to be embraced--Duncan realises his artistic passages may be coming to an end, but willing passes the torch onto a new generation: ‘now the Sun in you grows hot.’\n\n'Black Art,' Amiri Baraka\n\nPoems are bullshit unless they are teeth or trees or lemons piled on a step. Or black ladies dying of men leaving nickel hearts beating them down. Fuck poems and they are useful, wd they shoot come at you, love what you are, breathe like wrestlers, or shudder strangely after pissing. We want live words of the hip world live flesh & coursing blood. Hearts Brains Souls splintering fire. We want poems like fists beating niggers out of Jocks or dagger poems in the slimy bellies of the owner-jews. Black poems to smear on girdlemamma mulatto bitches whose brains are red jelly stuck between 'lizabeth Taylor's toes. Stinking Whores! We want \"poems that kill.\" Assassin poems, poems that shoot guns. Poems that wrestle cops into alleys and take their weapons leaving them dead with tongues pulled out and sent to Ireland. Knockoff poems for dope selling wops or slick halfwhite politicians. Airplane poems, rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . . .tuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuh . . .rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . . . Setting fire and death to whities ass. Look at the Liberal Spokesman for the jews clutch his throat & puke himself into eternity . . . rrrrrrrr There's a negroleader pinned to a bar stool in Sardi's eyeballs melting in hot flame. Another negroleader on the steps of the white house one kneeling between the sheriff's thighs negotiating coolly for his people. Aggh . . . stumbles across the room . . . Put it on him, poem. Strip him naked to the world! Another bad poem cracking steel knuckles in a jewlady's mouth Poem scream poison gas on beasts in green berets Clean out the world for virtue and love, Let there be no love poems written until love can exist freely and cleanly. Let Black people understand that they are the lovers and the sons of lovers and warriors and sons of warriors. Are poems & poets & all the loveliness here in the world We want a black poem. And a Black World. Let the world be a Black Poem And Let All Black People Speak This Poem Silently or LOUD\n\nAmiri Baraka (1934--2014) was an American writer of poetry, plays, fiction and essays. He was an immensely important figure in the Black Arts Movement as well as the poetry scene of the 1950's and 60's, founding with his then-wife Hettie Totem Press, which published the early works of many Beat poets. He was also the editor of various poetry magazines throughout his life. Controversial for his aggressive and sometimes offensive poetry, Baraka helped define much of the Black radical poetry which appeared in the latter half of the 20th Century.\n\n'Black Art' is as much a declaration and thesis as it is a poem, a constitution for the Black Arts Movement and the position of poetry within the Black Power movement. Baraka was deeply critical of 'assimilationist' blacks (and Jews), and much of the early African-American literature such as that produced by the Harlem Renaissance writers. He felt that those writers--like Langston Hughes and W. E. B. DuBois--were too eager to imitate white writers, and please white audiences, writing 'middle-class poems' instead of '\"poems that kill\" / Assassin poems, poems that shoot / guns.'\n\nFor Baraka it was the duty of the radical black writer to produce work that was fully integrated within the struggle against racism. Like William Carlos Williams or Ezra Pound he wrote as an objectivist, focusing on real concrete images to make his black audiences see themselves in the poem, and here writes about his wish to have 'poems that wrestle cops into alleys / and take their weapons leaving them dead.' Black poetry, he felt, should imagine a revolutionary world where African-Americans had the agency to reverse the dynamics of power between white and black people. The deliberately shocking and surreal movements this poem takes are all part of that, using slang of the black community as if daring white audiences to try to understand it.\n\nWritten in 1966, after the assassination of Malcolm X radicalised Baraka and he left the Beats in New York to live in Harlem, it is a reflection of the frustration and anger Baraka felt at the time and his then belief that the entire American system had to be overthrown for any real liberation of the black community to occur. Only then could they ' understand / that they are the lovers and the sons / of lovers and warriors and sons / of warriors. Are poems & poets & / all the loveliness here in the world.'\n\nLater in life Baraka would recant much of his Nationalist stance after reading Marx and becoming an advocate for Third World Socialism, but his taste for controversy and wish for radical change never wavered, with his template for 'Black Art' inspiring the work of a generation."
