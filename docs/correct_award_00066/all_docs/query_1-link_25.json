        "text": "Frans Eemil Sillanpää was born in 1888 in a croft at Myllykolu in Kierikkala, a small farming community about 40 km west of Tampere. While his parents were poor crofters, they managed to send their youngest and only-surviving child \"Fransu,\" to Tampereen Suomalaiseen Reaalilyseoon (Tampere Grammar School).\n\nEducation\n\nSillanpää did well and in 1908 started studies in natural science at the University of Helsinki with the aim of progressing to a medical degree. There he became friends with fellow student, Heikki Järnefelt, son of renowned painter Eero Järnefelt. Through the Järnefelt family, who lived in the artists' colony of Tuusula north of Helsinki, Sillanpää got to meet the earlier great men of Finnish writing, music and painting: Juhani Aho, Sibelius and Pekka Halonen.\n\nAfter five years at university, he left without a degree. Although his studies had imbued him with a scientific outlook on life --which influenced his later writing-- his interests were more inclined to the arts. Sillanpää returned to his parents’ home at Myllykolu in 1913 and occupied himself with farming and writing. The next year he went to Sweden and Denmark, writing newspaper articles with the thought of becoming a journalist.\n\nEarly Success\n\nIn 1916, he wrote his first novel: Elämä ja aurinko (Life and Sun), which follows a young man’s erotic relationships with two girls over one idyllic summer of enjoyment, heedless of the World War being fought on the continent. In spite of being criticized as almost pornographic (or, perhaps, because it was), it became an instant success, being since compared with the novels of D.H. Lawrence (of Lady Chatterley’s Lover fame).\n\nThe same year, Sillanpää married 18-year old Sigrid Maria Salomäki, with whom he was to have eight children.\n\nHurskas kurjuus\n\nAfter a book of short stories, his novel Hurskas kurjuus (Meek Heritage) was published in 1919. Following the tale of a poor crofter from the time of the 1860s famine, it explores the background reasons that the working class and rural workers rose in revolt. The novel ends with the crofter's was wrongful execution by the Whites in 1918 for murder. Although Sillanpää had supported the Whites in the war, his novel condemned the reprisals that followed it.\n\nSeveral short stories novellas followed, but there would be no further novel until the early 1930s, when Sillanpää published three. Nuorena nukkunut (The Maid Silja), published in 1931, brought Sillanpää international fame. The tale follows a family in decline. After losing their farm, they leave an orphan daughter, Silja, who becomes a servant and dies of tuberculosis after being jilted by her lover. The novel was translated into Swedish the same year it was originally published in Finland.\n\nMiehen tie (The Way of Man), published in 1932, and Ihmiset suviyössä (People in the Summer Night) published in 1934, both capture peasant culture. All three books were translated into English and other modern languages within a few years.\n\nPolitical Stance\n\nDuring the 30s, Sillanpää maintained a neutral stance between the political left and right, and thus fell out of favour with both sides. Joulukirje diktaattoreille (Christmas Letter to the Dictators), published in 1939 and aimed at the likes of Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin, caused the German translations of his work to be withdrawn from sale in Germany.\n\nThat same April, Sigrid, Sillanpää’s beloved wife, died of pneumonia. A few months later, he married his secretary, 38-year-old Anna von Hertzen.\n\nAwards\n\nThe Nobel Committee had considered Sillanpää a candidate for the literature prize for some years, and, finally in 1939, awarded it to him after the publication of his collection of short stories called Myllykolu-- named after his birthplace. The prize was awarded to him, \"for his deep understanding of his country's peasantry and the exquisite art with which he has portrayed their way of life and their relationship with Nature.\"\n\nSoon after the announcement of the award, the Winter War began. During his military training, Sillanpää wrote Marssilaulu (Marching Song), which became very popular, particularly amongst the soldiers. After travelling to Sweden to receive his prize, he stayed there to raise money for Finland, returning just before the war ended in March 1940.\n\nLater Years\n\nSillanpää's second marriage was not successful. The couple were divorced in 1941, after which Sillanpää entered hospital. He suffered from the consequences of a lifetime of heavy drinking paired with exhaustion. His deteriorating health required forcible hospital confinement from 1941 to 1943. Afterwards, he made regular broadcasts on Finnish radio, and he gave his ever-popular Christmas talks from the end of the war until he died.\n\nHe enjoyed wider popularity as a performing artist than for his many written works. His popularity and grandfatherly appearance resulted in his nickname \"Taata\" (Granddad). He wrote relatively little at this time, but two novels were produced in the 1940s and, in the next decade, he wrote his reminiscences and published two collections of his earlier articles.\n\nDeath\n\nSillanpää died in Helsinki 1964 at 75 years of age.\n\nLegacy\n\nSillanpää’s works have been translated into thirty languages, and made into films and theatre productions. Today, when new readers discover his works, they are enchanted by his style and the values of a rural life and an era long gone.\n\n​\n\nIn July and August of 2017, an opera based on Sillanpää’s life will be premiered for a two week period at Myllykolu’s Summer Theatre, next to the croft in which he grew up.\n\nWritten by Barry Lambert\n\n​\n\nPrincipal Sources: A History of Finland’s Literature, George C.
