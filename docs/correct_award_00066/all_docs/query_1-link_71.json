        "text": "I don’t have too much good to say about the Swedish Academy, which decides who will receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. If you look at the list of its recipients, it would not take too much effort to produce a list of as great as or even greater literary figures who have not received the laureate. Let me take a stab at it:\n\nKobo Abe (Japan), Woman in the Dunes\n\nChinua Achebe (Nigeria), Things Fall Apart\n\nRyunosuke Akutagawa (Japan), Rashomon\n\nJorge Amado (Brazil), Gabriela: Clove and Cinnamon\n\nW. H. Auden (UK), Poetry\n\nGeorges Bernanos (France), Mouchette\n\nJorge Luis Borges (Argentina), Ficciones\n\nJoseph Conrad (UK/Poland), Nostromo\n\nRichard Flanagan (Australia), The Narrow Road to the Deep North\n\nGraham Greene (UK), The Heart of the Matter\n\nVassili Grossman (Russia), Life and Fate\n\nHenry James (US/UK), The Ambassadors\n\nJames Joyce (Ireland), Ulysses\n\nYashar Kemal (Turkey), Memed, My Hawk\n\nGyula Krúdy (Hungary), The Red Post Coach\n\nStanislaw Lem (Poland), Solaris\n\nOsip Mandelstam (Russia), Poetry\n\nVladimir Nabokov (US/Russia), Lolita\n\nFernando Pessoa (Portugal), The Book of Disquiet\n\nMarcel Proust (France), In Search of Lost Time\n\nArkady and Boris Strugatsky (Russia), Roadside Picnic\n\nItalo Svevo (Slovenia), Confessions of Zeno\n\nLeo Tolstoy (Russia), Novels and Stories\n\nMark Twain (US), Novels and Stories\n\nEvelyn Waugh (UK), Brideshead Revisited\n\nVirginia Woolf (UK), Mrs Dalloway\n\nAs you can see, I have not overloaded the list with the names of American authors, in the interests of being fair. If I wanted to, I can add names like Philip Roth, Ursula K. Le Guin, Joyce Carol Oates, Philip K. Dick, Cormac McCarthy, James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, and a few others.\n\nThese can replace such figures as the following, whose reputations have not kept up with the times: Bjornsterne Bjornson, José Echegaray, Giosue Carducci, Rudolf Christoph Eucken, Paul von Heyse, Verner von Heidenstam, Karl Adolph Gjellerup, Henrik Pontopiddan, Carl Spitteler, Jacinto Benavente, Grazia Deledda, Erik Axel Karlfeldt, Pearl S. Buck, Frans Eemil Sillanpaa [SIC], Johannes Vilhelm Jensen, Earl Russell, and a few dozen others—mostly Scandinavian nonentities which at one time were highly thought of by a couple dozen mouldy Swedish academics. (Please forgive me for being lax about the diacritical marks in the above names.)"
