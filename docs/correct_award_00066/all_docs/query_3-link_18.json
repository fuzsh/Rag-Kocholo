Ahlfors worked for decades at Harvard University as a professor.\n\nPentti Eskola\n\nThe Vetlesen Prize in 1964\n\nGeologist Pentti Eskola (1883–1964) achieved international recognition in 1915 for his theory on the formation of the metamorphic facies of rocks, which is part of the basics of geology and mineralogy. In 1964 Eskola received the Vetlesen Prize, which is the highest scientific distinction in his field. Pentti Eskola was a professor of geology and mineralogy at the University of Helsinki from 1924 to 1953.\n\nLinus Torvalds\n\nThe Millenium Technology prize in 2012\n\nLinus Torvalds (born 1969) began to study computer science at the University of Helsinki in 1988.
