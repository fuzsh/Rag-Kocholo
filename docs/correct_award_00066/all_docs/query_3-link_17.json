He was born in Finland when it was part of Russia. His father was a farmer and peasant, and Sillanpää's work was frequently centered on peasant life. His best-known work, Nuorena Nukkunut (published in English as The Maid Silja or, alternately, Fallen Asleep While Young) tells the story of a farm family's financial ruin, their peasant daughter's subsequent work as a chambermaid, her illicit affair with her employer, and her eventual death from tuberculosis. His novels have been adapted into movies several times, most notably the well-received 1988 Finnish film Ihmiselon Ihanuus Ja Kurjuus (The Loveliness and Wretchedness of Human Life).\n\nFather: Frans Henrik Henriksson a/k/a Frans Henrik Koskinen (farmer)\n\nMother: Loviisa Vilhelmiina Mäkelä Iisaksdotter\n\nWife: Sigrid Maria (b. 1898, dated 1912-16, m. 1916, d. 1939, eight children)\n\nWife: Anna Armia von Hertzen (Sillanpää's secretary, m. 1939)\n\nHigh School: Tampere Grammar School, Tampere, Finland (1908)\n\nMedical School: University of Helsinki (attended 1908-13)\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1939\n\nAsteroid Namesake 1446 Sillanpää\n\nRisk Factors: Alcoholism\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nElämä ja Aurinko (Life and Sun) (1916)\n\nIhmislapsia Elämän Saatossa (Children of Man in Life's Procession) (1917)\n\nHurskas Kurjuus (Meek Heritage) (1919)\n\nRakas Isänmaani (Beloved Fatherland) (1919)\n\nHiltu ja Ragnar (Hiltu and Ragnar) (1923)\n\nEnkelten Suojatit (Wards of the Angels) (1923)\n\nOmistani ja Omilleni (About my Own and to my Own) (1924)\n\nMaan Tasalta (From the Earth's Level) (1924)\n\nTöllinmäki (Shanty Hill) (1925)\n\nRippi (Confession) (1928)\n\nKiitos Hetkistä, Herra (Thanks for the Moments, Lord) (1930)\n\nNuorena Nukkunut (The Maid Silja) (1931)\n\nMiehen Tie (A Man's Way) (1932)\n\nVirranpohjalta (From the Bottom of the Stream) (1933)\n\nIhmiset Suviyössä (People in the Summer Night) (1934)\n\nViidestoista (The Fifteenth) (1936)\n\nElokuu (August) (1944)\n\nIhmiselon Ihanuus Ja Kurjuus (The Loveliness and Wretchedness of Human Life) (1945)\n\nPoika eli Elämäänsä (The Boy Lived His Life) (1953, memoirs)\n\nPäivä Korkeimmillaan (Day at its Highest) (1956, memoirs)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
