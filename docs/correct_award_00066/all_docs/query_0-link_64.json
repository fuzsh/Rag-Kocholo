He was born into a peasant family in Hämeenkyrö at Myllykolu croft village.

Although poor they managed to send their son to\n\tTampere grammar school, where he faired well.\n\tIn later years he became a heavy drinker and also adopted the ideas of the so called \n\t‘YOUNG FINLAND MOVEMENT’. He saw man as a small and important part of the\n\tUniverse and shared the theory about the unity of all nature and the land and how \n\tDependant they were on the sun to bring life and energy into their lives.\n\tSillanpää gained international recognition in 1931 when NUORENA NUKKUNUT,\n\tWere (The Maid Silja) was translated into English. The story depicts the loss of a farm\n\tAnd an entire family, which ends with the farmers daughter dying.
