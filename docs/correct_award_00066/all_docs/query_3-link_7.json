        "text": "(1888–1964). A student of natural science as well as a writer, Frans Eemil Sillanpää viewed his characters from a biologist’s standpoint, as an integral part of their surroundings. In 1939 he became the first Finnish writer to win the Nobel prize for literature.\n\nThe son of a peasant farmer, Sillanpää was born on September 16, 1888, in Hämeenkyrö, Finland, which was then part of the Russian Empire. He began studying natural science but in 1913 returned to the country, married, and began to write. His first short stories were published in journals in 1915. His first novel, Elämä ja aurinko (1916; Life and the Sun), the story of a young man who returns home in midsummer and falls in love, reflects his conviction that people are essentially part of nature and that instinct rules human actions.\n\nShocked by the Finnish Civil War of 1918, Sillanpää wrote his most substantial novel, Hurskas kurjuus (1919; Meek Heritage), describing how a humble cottager becomes involved with the Communist Red Guards without clearly realizing the ideological implications. The novelette Hiltu ja Ragnar (1923; Hilda and Ragner) is the tragic love story of a city boy and a country servant-girl. After several collections of short stories in the late 1920s, Sillanpää published his best-known, though not necessarily his best, work, Nuorena nukkunut (1931; The Maid Silja), a story of an old peasant family. Later novels include Miehen tie (1932; Way of a Man) and Ihmiset suviyössä (1934; People in the Summer Night), which is stylistically his most finished and poetic novel. His reminiscences, Poika eli elämäänsa (1953; Telling and Describing) and Päivä korkeimmillaan (1956; The High Moment of the Day), throw new light on him as a writer. Sillanpää died on June 3, 1964, in Helsinki, Finland."
