The film stars Eila Peitsalo, Tea Ista, Pertti Weckstrom, Paavo Hyttila and Ture Junttu. The movie is a Finnish film, the original title of which is POIKA ELI KESAANSA. The film was produced by Fennada-Filmi in Finland, and was distributed by Exclusive International Films in the U.S. in 1960. This poster dates from 1960. The film is based on a novel by Nobel Prize Winner Frans Eemil Sillanpaa. Sillanpaa, very famous in Finland, won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1939 for \"his deep understanding of his country's peasantry and the exquisite art with which he has portrayed their way of life and their relationship with Nature.\" This poster was used in a theater and we have graded in good condition. There is a fold separation of about seven inches, which we have reinforced with archival tissue. MovieArt Original Film Posters in Austin, Texas guarantees that this poster is an authentic U.S. poster for this film. MovieArt Austin does not sell reproductions.\n\nROLAND af HALLSTROM - Director"
