        "text": "Finnish commemorative 2 euro coins 2013, 125th Anniversary of the Birth of Nobel Prize winning Author Frans Eemil Sillanpää\n\nCommemorative 2 euro coins from Finland\n\nDescription: The inner part of the coin depicts Sillanpää's portrait. At the top, in semi-circle, the words ‘F. E. SILLANPÄÄ’. At the left, the year ‘1888’ and the mint mark. At the right, the year ‘1964’, the indication of the issuing country ‘FI’ and the year of issuance ‘2013’. This is a special coin to commemorate the grandfather of a whole nation. F. E. SILLANPÄÄ was a master of style who brought deep insights about the relationship between people and nature into Finnish literature. He was awarded the Nobel prize in 1939 based in particular on the works Meek Heritage and The Maid Silja. This masterful author gained even more national renown with his popular radio appearances and memorable Christmas columns. After the war years, the master writer evolved into the long-bearded ‘Taata’, the unofficial grandfather to the country. From recollections of his childhood Christmases emerged a well-loved tradition: Grandpa gathered the whole nation devoutly around their radios with his easy-going Christmas ‘talks’. The coin’s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.\n\nReverse: left from the coin centre face value: 2, on the right inscription: EURO; in the background of the inscription a map of Europe; in the background of the map vertically six parallel lines ending on both sides with five-pointed stars (the reverse is common for all euro coins)\n\nIssuing volume: 1,500,000 coins\n\nDate of issue: 4 November 2013\n\nFace value: 2 euro\n\nDiameter: 25.75 mm\n\nThickness: 2.2 mm\n\nWeight: 8.5 gr\n\nComposition: BiAlloy (Nk/Ng), ring Cupronickel (75% copper - 25% nickel clad on nickel core), center Nickel brass\n\n€2 Edge Inscription: The Finnish €2 coin edge inscription is 'SUOMI FINLAND', followed by three lion heads.\n\nMint Location: Rahapaja Oy, in Helsinki-Vantaa, Finland.\n\nNational Identification: Abbreviation: FI - Finland.\n\nFrans Eemil Sillanpää\n\nFrans Eemil Sillanpää (16 September 1888 – 3 June 1964) was one of the most famous Finnish writers and in 1939 became the first Finnish writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nFrans Eemil Sillanpää was born into a peasant farming family in Hämeenkyrö. Although his parents were poor, they managed to send him to school in Tampere. In 1908 he moved to Helsinki to study medicine. Here his acquaintances included the painters Eero Järnefelt and Pekka Halonen, composer Jean Sibelius and author Juhani Aho.\n\nFive years later, in 1913 Sillanpää moved from Helsinki to his old home village, married, and devoted himself to writing.\n\nHe won international fame for his novel Nuorena nukkunut (The Maid Silja / Fallen Asleep While Young) in 1931.\n\nIn 1939, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his deep understanding of his country's peasantry and the exquisite art with which he has portrayed their way of life and their relationship with Nature.\"\n\nThe asteroid 1446 Sillanpää, discovered on January 26, 1938 by the renowned Finnish astronomer and physicist Yrjö Väisälä, was named after him.\n\nSillanpää died on 3 June 1964 in Helsinki aged 75."
