        "text": "Frans Eemil Sillanpää (born Sept. 16, 1888, Hämeenkyrö, Finland, Russian Empire—died June 3, 1964, Helsinki, Fin.) was the first Finnish writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature (1939).\n\nThe son of a peasant farmer, Sillanpää began studying natural science but in 1913 returned to the country, married, and began to write. His first short stories were published in journals in 1915. From 1924 to 1927 he worked for a publishing company in Porvoo. A new creative period followed in the early 1930s, when he wrote several of his best works.\n\nSillanpää’s first novel, Elämä ja aurinko (1916; “Life and the Sun”), the story of a young man who returns home in midsummer and falls in love, is characteristic. People are seen as essentially part of nature. Instinct, through which life’s hidden purpose is revealed, rules human actions."
