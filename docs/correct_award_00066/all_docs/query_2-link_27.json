        "text": "The following is from the book Christmas in Scandinavia, edited by Sven H. Rossel and Bo Elbrond-Bek and translated by David W. Colbert:\n\nA Farm Owner’s Christmas Eve\n\nFinnish novelist Frans Eemil Sillanpää received the Nobel Prize in literature in 1939. Sillanpää gained international recognition with the naturalistic novel from the bloody Finnish civil war of 1918, Hurskas Kurjuss (1919: Meek Heritage). His following novels are characterized by a more poetic mood. They are set in the countryside, and the narrative, often focusing on love and sexuality as the ruling forces of human life, is framed by sensitive descriptions of nature.\n\nVisti-Mina, an elderly woman and mistress and owner of the freehold farm Visti, assessed at 0.003 of a holding, had been awakened by the cat’s mewing, and in letting it out she noticed that it was rather cold in the room; even without looking she could tell that the water was frozen in the water cask by the door. And how might the poor little girl be doing, then? But she was still sleeping soundly in the middle of the bed under half the quilt. It had been necessary to move her sleeping space farther down, away from the right side of the bedstead. If Mina had her lying right alongside her, then she would kick all night against Mina’s sensitive midriff. She is Ida’s daughter, Mina is the child’s maternal grandmother. God only knows where Ida herself is gadding about …\n\nThese dry sticks and twigs up in the chimney vault were really true treasures on a winter’s morning; they were almost like edible delicacies. When you put them on the hearth under the trivet, they caught fire at once, and with their help you could then also get the damp firewood smoldering. And the coffee simmered, its fragrance filling the room, which was warmed bit by bit. The windowpanes, which just now were coated with a thick crust of ice, were already beginning to thaw on their uppermost edges; while the coffee was settling Mina could peer through the thawed-out spots to the yard, where a reddish-yellow December morning had just dawned. From the farms the smoke was rising straight up to the sky, and she thought she heard the crunch of sleigh runners. Now look how long I’ve slept.—Well, and then it’s Christmas Even, too, by golly!—Up with you in a hurry lass!\n\nFrom under the covers two little eyes were opened and aimed at the room and at Mina, whose familiar features quickly dispelled the memory of the tangled splendors of the child’s dreams. The blazing fire in the fireplace, the frozen windowpanes, and the confidently puttering old woman gave the child’s mind full compensation, auguring a long, clear day with thousands of adventures.\n\n………………………………………\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nFrom Conquistador\n\nDedication\n\n“O frati,” dissi, “che per cento milia\n\nPerigli siete giunti all’ occidente.”\n\n(“O brothers,” I said, “who through a hundred thousand/Perils have reached the West.” The speaker is Ulysses, encouraging his shipmates to continue with their last voyage of exploration from Ithaca westward, as reported by himself to Dante in hell. They ultimately discovered a new land in the west, but were wrecked before reaching it.)\n\nThe Divine Comedy\n\nInferno, canto XXVI, lines 112-113\n\nPrologue\n\nAnd the way goes on in the worn earth;\n\nand we (others)—\n\nWhat are the dead to us in our better fortune?\n\nThey have left us the roads made and the walls standing:\n\nThey have left us the chairs in the rooms:\n\nWhat is there more of them—\n\nEither their words in the stone or their graves in the land\n\nOr the rusted tang in the turf-roof where they fought—\n\nHas truth against us?\n\n(And another man\n\nWhere the wild geese rise from the Michigan the water\n\nVeering the clay bluff: in another wind. . . .)\n\nSurely the will of God in the earth alters:\n\nTime done is dark as are sleep’s thickets:\n\nDark is the past: none waking walk there:\n\nNeither may live men of those waters drink:\n\nAnd their speech they have left upon the coins to mock us:\n\nAnd the weight of their skulls at our touch is a shuck’s weight:\n\nAnd their rains are dry and the sound of their leaves fallen:\n\n(We have still the sun and the green places)\n\nAnd they care nothing for living men: and the honey of\n\nSun is slight in their teeth as a seed’s taste—\n\nWhat are the dead to us in the world’s wonder?\n\nWhy (and again now) on their shadowy beaches\n\nPouring before them the slow painful blood\n\nDo we return to force the truthful speech of them\n\nShrieking like snipe along their gusty sand\n\nAnd stand: and as the dark ditch fills beseech them\n\n(Reaching across the surf their fragile hands) to\n\nSpeak to us?\n\nas by that other ocean\n\nThe elder shadows to the sea-borne man\n\nGuarding the ram’s flesh and the bloody dole . . . .\n\nSpeak to me Conquerors!\n\nBut not as they!\n\nbring not those others with you whose new-closed\n\n(O Brothers!

Many came to mind: Christmas in Connecticut with Barbara Stanwyck, The Bishop’s Wife with Loretta Young, White Christmas with Rosemary Clooney, The Bells of St. Mary’s with Ingrid Bergman, Holiday Inn, Miracle on 34th St., It’s A Wonderful Life.\n\nSomething about the final scene in A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote captures memories I have about Memphis and the woman who helped raise me and places and people there I still feel connected to even though I will never see them again. She was just as kind and loving to me as the character of Geraldine Paige is in Capote’s story and just as much fun to be with.\n\nWhen my family and I would decorate the Christmas tree each year, I’d pull out all our old Christmas albums. Songs by Barbara Streisand, Bing Crosby and Doris Day filled our living room as we scooted around boxes to wind strings of lights around the tree. My mother made cinnamon cake, while my father and I loaded the tree with ornaments and silver tinsel and made runs to and from the drugstore for replacement bulbs.\n\nYears later after I left home and was divorced, I celebrated Christmas one year by placing an ornament on a tree by an open space trail I hiked on in Boulder. Over the next few weeks, more ornaments began to appear, all angels. The local paper wrote a story about The Angel Tree, and there were debates and editorials about whether the ornaments should be allowed and the defacement of public land and who started it. The controversy even made a blip on national news.\n\nOne night the ornaments were stolen. They were found later in a garbage can on the downtown mall. Since The Camera had been covering the story, the ornaments were left at the newspaper and people could retrieve them there if they wanted. My ornament was a porcelain silhouette of my own face my mother had made of me as a child, so I went down to the paper to claim it.\n\nWhen I sat at the reporter’s desk, he asked me if I knew who started the tree, and I told him no and then he asked if I believed in angels. I hesitated at first. I was working as a journalist myself then at a local magazine and had a sense whatever I said was going to appear as a pullquote in the story the next morning. I finally told him I believed people were angels. There are people walking around who look human but are really angels in disguise, I said. I don’t remember what chapter and verse that comes from in the Bible anymore, but that was the pullquote that appeared in the story the next day.\n\nThis year as Christmas approaches, I’d do anything to decorate a tree with my parents again and listen to a 1967 version of Streisand sing I Wonder As I Wander. When I watched Geraldine Paige in this final scene of A Christmas Memory last night talk about seeing the Lord, I realized something about Christmas I never have before. The holiday is more about the faces and occurrences in our everyday lives than it is about the silver tinsel and traditions of our childhoods.\n\nI think that’s what struck a nerve in people about The Angel Tree. It was such a simple gesture. I put that angel on the tree as a possibility of hope or love in my life during a time I felt very alone, separate from the living rooms and Christmas trees I saw through the windows I passed, full of colored lights and wonder and permanence.\n\nWhen the other angel ornaments began to appear in their various shapes and sizes, they looked like fellow travelers, strays left at the bottom of the box who were also looking for a home. I imagined children hiking with their parents who wanted to place an ornament on the tree or people like me who lived alone and wanted to feel part of a larger community effort.\n\nChristmas, I’m reminded again, is not the elaborate traditions we celebrate with our families each year either joyfully or reluctantly. It is something much more ordinary and plain. It is that person we find in life who knows us and listens to us and accepts us for who we are. That is the most enchanting thing in the world. So many people are searching for that. There’s something so pure and childlike in that need. It shines like a star in the tops of all our trees. It is the angel we are all looking for.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nPearl S. Buck (1892-1973) is the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize and the first woman to win both the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes. She won both awards for her book The Good Earth, published in 1931, which revolves around family life in a Chinese village before the 1949 Revolution.\n\nHere are two quotes from the novel: “There was only this perfect sympathy of movement, of turning this earth of theirs over and over to the sun, this earth which formed their home and fed their bodies and made their gods…Some time, in some age, bodies of men and women had been buried there, houses had stood there, had fallen, and gone back into the earth. So would also their house, some time, return into the earth, their bodies also. Each had his turn at this earth. They worked on, moving together-together-producing the fruit of this earth.”\n\n“As he had been healed of his sickness of heart when he came from the southern city and comforted by the bitterness he had endured there, so now again Wang Lung was healed of his sickness of love by the good dark earth of his fields and he felt the moist soil on his feet and he smelled the earthy fragrance rising up out of the furrows he turned for the wheat.”\n\nBuck is also known for her humanitarian work: “In 1949, outraged that existing adoption services considered Asian and mixed-race children unadoptable, Pearl established Welcome House Inc., the first international, interracial adoption agency. In nearly five decades of work, Welcome House has placed over five thousand children. In 1964, to support children who were not eligible for adoption, Buck established the Pearl S. Buck Foundation to ‘address poverty and discrimination faced by children in Asian countries.’ In 1965, she opened the Opportunity Center and Orphanage in South Korea, and later offices were opened in Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. When establishing Opportunity House, Buck said, “The purpose…is to publicize and eliminate injustices and prejudices suffered by children, who, because of their birth, are not permitted to enjoy the educational, social, economic and civil privileges normally accorded to children.” (source Wiki). The Pearl S. Buck International Web site can be found at www.psbi.org.\n\nHere are the opening paragraphs from her biography, Pearl S. Buck, A Cultural Biography, written by Peter Conn and published in 1996: In April, 1899, six-year-old Pearl Sydenstricker wrote a letter from Chinkiang, China, to the editor of the Christian Observer, in Louisville, Kentucky. It was her first published writing, and it appeared under the headline “Our Real Home in Heaven”:\n\n‘I am a little girl, six years old. I live in China. I have a big brother in college who is coming to China to help our father tell the Chinese about Jesus. I have two little brothers in heaven. Maudie went first, then Artie, then Edith, and on the tenth of last month my little brave brother, Clyde left us to go to our real home in heaven. Clyde said he was a Christian Soldier, and that heaven was his bestest home. Clyde was four years old, and we both love the little letters in the Observer. I wrote this all myself, and my hand is tired, so goodbye….’\n\nAs an adult, she would completely reject the religion in which she was raised, but it was the source of everything she learned about values as a child. Living in a small Chinese city, she was separated from her own country and its culture almost from birth….In the end, Pearl was inevitably shaped by both her parents. She rejected her father’s religious beliefs and his narrow-mindedness, but she inherited his evangelical zeal, his sense of rectitude, his passion for learning. Though she stopped believing in Christian ideas of salvation, she became, in effect, a secular missionary, bringing the gospels of civil rights and cross-cultural understanding to people on two continents.\n\nHere is a clip from the 1937 film:\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nPearl S.

We don’t have the instinct\n\nof migrant birds. Late and out of season,\n\nwe suddenly throw ourselves to the wind\n\nand fall into indifferent ponds. We\n\nunderstand flowering and fading at once.\n\nAnd somewhere lions still roam: so magnificent\n\nthey can’t understand weakness.\n\nEven when fully intent on one thing,\n\nwe feel another’s costly tug. Hostility\n\nis second nature to us. Having promised\n\none another distance, hunting, and home,\n\ndon’t lovers always cross each other’s boundaries?\n\nThen for the sketchwork of an eye-wink,\n\na contrasting background’s painfully prepared\n\nto make us see it. Because it’s very clear\n\nwe don’t know the contours of our feeling,\n\nbut only what shapes it from without.\n\nWho hasn’t sat anxious in front of his heart’s\n\ncurtain? It would go up; another parting scene.\n\nEasy to understand. The familiar garden\n\nswaying slightly; then came the dancer.\n\nNot him. Enough! However graceful he may be,\n\nhe’s disguised, turns into a suburbanite,\n\nand walks into his house through the kitchen.\n\nI don’t want these half-filled masks.\n\nI’d rather have a doll. That’s whole.\n\nI’ll put up with the empty body, the wire, and\n\nthe face that’s only surface. Here. I’m waiting.\n\nEven if the lights go out; even if\n\nI’m told, “That’s all”; even if emptiness\n\ndrifts toward me in gray drafts from the stage;\n\neven if none of my silent ancestors\n\nwill sit next to me anymore, not a woman,\n\nnot even the boy with the squinting brown eyes —\n\nI’ll stay here. One can always watch.\n\nAren’t I right? Father, you who found\n\nlife so bitter after tasting mine,\n\nthe first opaque infusion of my must,\n\nas I kept growing, you kept on tasting\n\nand, fascinated by the aftertaste\n\nof such a strange future, tried my clouded gaze —\n\nyou, my father, who in my deepest hope\n\nso often since your death have been afraid for me\n\nand, serene, surrendered the kingdoms of serenity\n\nthe dead own, just for my bit of fate —\n\naren’t I right? And aren’t I right,\n\nyou who loved me for the first small impulse\n\nof love for you I always turned from,\n\nbecause the space in your faces, even while\n\nI loved it, changed into outer space\n\nwhere you no longer were . . . when I’m in the mood\n\nto wait in front of the puppet stage — No,\n\nto stare into it so intensely that finally\n\nan angel must appear, an actor to counteract\n\nmy stare and pull up the empty skins.\n\nAngel and doll: a real play at last.\n\nThen what we continually divide\n\nby our being here unites there.\n\nThen the cycle of all change can finally\n\nrise out of our seasons. Then the angel\n\nplays over and above us. Look at the dying,\n\nsurely they suspect how everything we do\n\nis full of sham, here where nothing\n\nis really itself. O hours of childhood,\n\nwhen more than the mere past was behind\n\neach shape and the future wasn’t stretched out\n\nbefore us. We were growing; sometimes we hurried\n\nto grow up too soon, half for the sake of those\n\nwho had nothing more than being grown-up.\n\nYet when we were alone, we still amused\n\nourselves with the everlasting and stood there\n\nin that gap between world and toy,\n\nin a place which, from the very start,\n\nhad been established for a pure event.\n\nWho will depict a child just as it stands? – place it\n\nwithin its constellation, give it the measure of distance\n\ninto its hand? who make the death of children\n\nout of grey bread, which hardens like a stone,\n\nor place it in the cherry mouth as it were the core\n\nof a shiny apple? Murderers are\n\neasy to fathom. Only this: to take on death\n\ncompletely, before even life begins,\n\ncontain it lightly and without complaining,\n\nbereaves description.\n\nDie vierte Elegie\n\nO Bäume Lebens, o wann winterlich?\n\nWir sind nicht einig.

Und wenn er auch so leicht tut,\n\ner ist verkleidet und er wird ein Bürger\n\nund geht durch seine Küche in die Wohnung.\n\nIch will nicht diese halbgefüllten Masken,\n\nlieber die Puppe. Die ist voll. Ich will\n\nden Balg aushalten und den Draht und ihr\n\nGesicht aus Aussehn. Hier. Ich bin davor.\n\nWenn auch die Lampen ausgehn, wenn mir auch\n\ngesagt wird: Nichts mehr – , wenn auch von der Bühne\n\ndas Leere herkommt mit dem grauen Luftzug,\n\nwenn auch von meinen stillen Vorfahrn keiner\n\nmehr mit mir dasitzt, keine Frau, sogar\n\nder Knabe nicht mehr mit dem braunen Schielaug:\n\nIch hleibe dennoch. Es giebt immer Zuschaun.\n\nHab ich nicht recht? Du, der um mich so bitter\n\ndas Leben schmeckte, meines kostend, Vater,\n\nden ersten trüben Aufguß meines Müssens,\n\nda ich heranwuchs, immer wieder kostend\n\nund, mit dem Nachgeschmack so fremder Zukunft\n\nheschäftigt, prüftest mein beschlagnes Aufschaun, –\n\nder du, mein Vater, seit du tot bist, oft\n\nin meiner Hoffnung, innen in mir, Angst hast,\n\nund Gleichmut, wie ihn Tote haben, Reiche\n\nvon Gleichmut, aufgiebst für mein bißchen Schicksal,\n\nhab ich nicht recht? Und ihr, hab ich nicht recht,\n\ndie ihr mich liebtet für den kleinen Anfang\n\nLiebe zu euch, von dem ich immer abkam,\n\nweil mir der Raum in eurem Angesicht,\n\nda ich ihn liebte, überging in Weltraum,\n\nin dem ihr nicht mehr wart …..: wenn mir zumut ist,\n\nzu warten vor der Puppenbühne, nein,\n\nso völlig hinzuschaun, daß, um mein Schauen\n\nam Ende aufzuwiegen, dort als Spieler\n\nein Engel hinmuß, der die Bälge hochreißt.\n\nEngel und Puppe: dann ist endlich Schauspiel.\n\nDann kommt zusammen, was wir immerfort\n\nentzwein, indem wir da sind. Dann entsteht\n\naus unsern Jahreszeiten erst der Umkreis\n\ndes ganzen Wandelns. Über uns hinüber\n\nspielt dann der Engel. Sieh, die Sterbenden,\n\nsollten sie nicht vermuten, wie voll Vorwand\n\ndas alles ist, was wir hier leisten. Alles\n\nist nicht es selbst. O Stunden in der Kindheit,\n\nda hinter den Figuren mehr als nur\n\nVergangnes war und vor uns nicht die Zukunft.\n\nWir wuchsen freilich und wir drängten manchmal,\n\nbald groß zu werden, denen halb zulieb,\n\ndie andres nicht mehr hatten, als das Großsein.\n\nUnd waren doch, in unserem Alleingehn,\n\nmit Dauerndem vergnügt und standen da\n\nim Zwischenraume zwischen Welt und Spielzeug,\n\nan einer Stelle, die seit Anbeginn\n\ngegründet war für einen reinen Vorgang.\n\nWer zeigt ein Kind, so wie es steht? Wer stellt\n\nes ins Gestirn und giebt das Maß des Abstands\n\nihm in die Hand? Wer macht den Kindertod\n\naus grauem Brot, das hart wird, – oder läßt\n\nihn drin im runden Mund, so wie den Gröps\n\nvon einem schönen Apfel? …… Mörder sind\n\nleicht einzusehen. Aber dies: den Tod,\n\nden ganzen Tod, noch vor dem Leben so\n\nsanft zu enthalten und nicht bös zu sein,\n\nist unbeschreiblich.\n\n………………………\n\nTranslated by A. Poulin Jr.\n\nRead Full Post »"
