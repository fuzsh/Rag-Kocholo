        "text": "HELSINKI, June 3— Frans Eemil Sillanpäl, the Finnish novelist who won a Nobel Prize in 1939, died in a hospital here early today. He was 75 years old.\n\nMr. Sillanpälä, known throughout Finland as “Taata,” an old diminutive for “Grandpa,” had suffered a brain hemorrhage a week ago.\n\nAs the news of his death spread, Finns almost invariably commented that Christmas Eve would not be the same this year. For no longer could young and old gather around radio or television to hear Taata tell his annual tales of Christmases of long ago in his small rural home town of Hameenkyro in south‐central Finland.\n\nProbably not many of his young listeners knew that Taata had received the Nobel prize in literature “for his exquisite art in painting the peasant life and nature of his country.” To them he was the personification of Finnish Christmas, a storytelling big old man with a gray beard and only one tooth who covered his bald head with a black cap.\n\nTo their elders, however, he was a distinguished novelist who wrote, mostly about his home district, with an epic sweep that depicted life as though humans were passive creatures in a biologicai setting. This may have been a reflection of his university studies in ology, which he interrupted when he began writing.\n\nHe was no literary trail blazer. He fitted comfortably in the school of writers of his youth, who concentrated on the classical Finnish tale of primitive life in the country.\n\nThere was much talk in Stockholm when the Nobel Prize was awarded to him that the Swedish academy was more bent on honoring Finland for her heroic stand in the winter war against the Russians than on honoring the novelist. But Rafael Koskimies, professor emeritus of modern literature at the University of HeLsinki, has said that Mr. Sillanpää was fully worthy of Nobel honors already in 1919.\n\nIn that year, the second of Finland's independence from Russia, after a civil war in which the so‐called White forces crushed the Red Guard, he published what was then considered a daring novel. “Meek Heritage” painted a sympathetic portrait of an old Finnish Red.\n\nMr. Sillanpää, had begun his career as an author three years before, when he was 28 years old. “Meek Heritage” was his second work.\n\nIn 1931 he wrote “The Maid Silja considered by many to have been his best book. It tells of a farm servant girl who dies of consumption. Another well‐known Sillanpää novel is “Man's Way,” published in 1932, the story of a young farmer's tortuous path to an inner equilibrium.\n\nMr. Sillanpää wrote a host of short stories and four novels, the last in 1945. But by then his creative powers were waning.\n\nHe had come to Helsinki a tall, robust, hard‐living man who looked like a peasant. His wife, Sigrid, a strong‐willed servant girl whom he married in 1916, died the year he received the Nobel Prize and friends say that much of his life went with her.\n\nThe couple had four daughters and four sons. One of the sons also is dead.\n\nShortly after his wife's death, Mr. Silianpää married his secretary, but that marriage lasted only until the following year.\n\nAfter World War II he began consciously to take on the role of Taata. Lauri Viljanen professor of Finnish literature at Helsinki University, once interpreted this as a withdrawal into “a kind of posthumous life.”\n\nMr. Sillanpää still did some writing in the postwar years, but he concentrated on reminiscences. He delighted in playing the part of a very old man and children's favorite in a park near the Helsinki home of his eldest daughter, with whom he lived.\n\nLike Jean Sibelius, the composer with whom he shared the adoration of his fellow countrymen, love of Finland dominated Mr. Silianpää's work.\n\nThe theme of “Meek Heritage” was the soil, and the mood was northern, very stark and monotonous, like the landscape itself. The novel was a gentle, poignant story of a simpleminded peasant, Jussi Toivola, whose life was detailed against the backdrop of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. An English translation was published here in 1938,\n\n“There are pathos here, and pity, and tenderness, which come from comprehension,” wrote one critic. “Now and again the prose rises to a qualitv which may be called poetry.”\n\nThe American critics were especially impressed by a part of the novel in kvhich Jussi comes to the conclusion that life is “like some sour, silly substance of which every human being was given more than he could handle, so that he was always in a state of semiexhaustion always on the point of being suffocated by it”"
