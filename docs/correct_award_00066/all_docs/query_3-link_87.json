        "text": "Programme\n\nComposer Paavo Korpijaakko presents his opera “People in the Summer Night”, with a libretto by dramaturge Elina Snicker. The work is based on the eponymous 1934 novel by Nobel prize-winning author Frans Eemil Sillanpää, and was premiered in Hämeenkyrö in the summer of 2023.\n\nThe lecture will be primarily in English\n\n“There is almost no summer night in the north; only a lingering evening, darkening slightly as it lingers, but even this darkening has its ineffable clarity. It is the approaching presentiment of the summer morning.”\n\nFurther information: Matthew Whittall, matthew.whittall@uniarts.fi\n\nMannerheimintie renovation project\n\nAccess to the Musiikkitalo from the direction of Mannerheimintie will be difficult. We recommend that you allow enough time for your arrival and use the entrance on the side of Kansalaistori if possible. According to current information, the entrance to Mannerheimintie will also remain in use throughout the renovation, but pedestrian routes can be challenging at times."
