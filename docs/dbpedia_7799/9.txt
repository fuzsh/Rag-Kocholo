The Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture, in association with Joe Conzo, Sr., is proud to present a night of Latin music brilliance – “Mambo Diablo: Honoring Tito Puente,” on Saturday, November 11, 2023, at 8:00 p.m. (EST). This concert will feature a spectacular lineup of world-class musicians and vocalists at the Main Theater of Hostos Community College celebrating the enduring legacy of the King of Latin Music.

The former members of the Tito Puente Orchestra unite as the world-renowned Mambo Legends Orchestra led by John “Dandy” Rodríguez, and musically directed by José Madera, alongside Mitch Frohman – each of whom boasts over 25 years collaboration with Tito Puente. Together, in a live onstage performance, they will take you on a remarkable journey through Tito Puente’s most iconic compositions and songs. These include those immortalized by the likes of La Lupe, Celia Cruz, Santos Colón, Vicentico Valdés, and other legends.

The evening will be further enriched by heartfelt tributes from Puente’s sons, Ronnie Puente and Tito Puente Jr., as well as performances by special guest artists who shared the stage and studio with Tito Puente. Among them are bassist Carlos Henríquez, percussionists Jimmy Delgado and Louis Bauzó, and trumpeters Ray Vega and Humberto Rámirez. Yolanda Duke will enchant the audience with her renditions of La Lupe’s iconic songs, while Lucrecia will captivate with her interpretations of the unforgettable collaborations between Celia Cruz and Tito Puente. Jeremy Bosch will serenade the crowd with the timeless songs and boleros associated with Vicentico Valdés and Santos Colón during their partnership with Puente and his Orchestra.
