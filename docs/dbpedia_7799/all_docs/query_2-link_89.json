        "text": "To start off music news, this is the full video of Maxine Waters grilling Steve Mnuchin. This is the Gospel arrangement by Mykal Kilgore. This is the video of the audience of the view clapping off beat.\n\nMartin Shkreli went to jail and was released on a $5mil bond. These are the details on him buying the Wu-Tang album for $2mil.\n\nSpotify adds social sharing buttons to their site. Tips and hidden tricks to navigating Apple music. YouTube Music allows you to download songs, albums and playlists.\n\nThis is the band The Mambo Legends that \"Dandy\" refers to and how you can follow them.\n\nThis is a discography of albums Martin Cohen put out on his label.\n\nThis is the Cal Tjader song/album featuring the Vibraslap referred to in the podcast.\n\nThis is the Pupi Campo orchestra feat Tito Puente and the later formed Picadilly Boys. This is the Tito Puente Latin Jazz Orchestra with \"Dandy\" on bongos.\n\nJose Mangual Sr. was the bongo player \"Dandy\" modeled his playing after. Here's a recording with both Jr & Sr. Diegito Iglesias was another player mentioned. Tata Guines played on all the Cachao recordings pre-1970.\n\nSterno cans are typically used to keep food warm. They were also used to tune tacked drum heads and sometimes injuries would occur.\n\nJuan \"Papi\" Cadavieco and Victor \"El Negrito\" Pantoja are two of the unsung heroes that are brought up. He also mentions Vicent \"Palacio\" Gonzalez in Joe Cuba's and Tito Rodriguez's band.\n\nOther musicians that aren't well known that Johnny mentions are Ralph Marzan, Pat Rodriguez-Timbales for Tito Rodriguez, Henry Rosa-Bongos for Machito, Luis Cocochea-Left Handed Conga player, Jose \"Papi\" Torres, \"Papi\" Pagani, Uba Nieto-Timbales for Machito, Luis Miranda, David Perez-Bass for Eddie Palmieri, & Frankie Malabe. (Here's a cool vid featuring Frankie Malabe).\n\nThat Ray Barretto futuristic album was called \"La Cuna\", but the album \"The Message\" is one of the iconic albums with a lineup to match. This was the song \"Cocinando\" recorded under red lights."
