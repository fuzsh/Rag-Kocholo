        "text": "You already said that, why repeat? And add even more rumor? If she had some issues it doesn’t mean she had them all; no need to pile more based on assumptions.\n\n“La Lupe's impulsive behavior on stage led to rumors that she took drugs, a charge her close friends vehemently deny. ''La Lupe is the most slandered person in the world…''” Quote from here: http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/27/arts/resurrecting-la-lupe-a-wild-and-soulful-singer-whose-life-fell-apart.html?pagewanted=1\n\nI prefer more solid info than rumor… Like I said, there’s a lot written about her, including a book: Demystifying a Diva: The Truth Behind the Myth of La Lupe, by Juan A. Moreno-Velazquez.\n\nIn any case, I know her life lends itself to gossip, but shouldn’t this thread be more about her artistry?\n\nThis thread is about her. When someone is as talented and as fascinating as she was, it is interesting to discuss all parts of her life including their personal life. I wrote in my first post that some denied she used drugs so that was covered. And I simply said I had heard (also read) that she had a thing with T.P. He had such a squeaky clean reputation I'm sure even if it was true it was kept under wraps. If La Lupe had hot affairs good for her!!!!\n\nMany many fantastic artists have had issues with drugs, alcohol, mental illness and men/women, actually most of the greats did. Billie Holiday one of my favorite singers of all time had an addiction that took her life... it doesn't take nothing away from her art. Nor does discussing La Lupe's personal life take any thing away for her art or talent!\n\nI am not one to promote rumors and I have read a lot about her...\n\nHere is a quote for her very good friend Izzy Sanabria...\n\n\"Due to her strong voice, torrid love affairs, drug problems, poor financial management and a large following of gays, the media referred to her as the Latina \"Judy Garland.\"\"\n\nHey guys,\n\nLa Lupe DID, in fact, imbibe in drugs. Her drug of choice was cocaine. Does this make her a drug abuser? Well, its kind of like the person who likes to go have a drink at the bar when they are out and about on a social level. Are they lushes or bad drunks?\n\nShe snorted cocaine on a \"casual\" basis. That is a fact and there is even video evidence of this that I personally saw which is not uploaded onto youtube and I hope it never is. And no, she was not a \"devoted\" practitioner of Santeria, despite the hearsay. It's kind of like the folks who claim to be catholic or religious, but you see by their lifestyle they are nowhere near the level of devotion as compared to \"Mother Teresa\" or any real completely serious and devoted person. It represented for her more as traditional \"costumbre\" as anything else. That religion was a part of her culture.\n\nNo kid with Puente and the affair with Mongo is something I've never personally heard about, but wouldn't doubt it. She was married to Willie Garcia, a Cuban sonero who sang with Libre, Grupo Folklorico, Son primero and so many other bands. The one who suffered from mental illness was Willie and not La Lupe.\n\nBesides cocaine, La Lupe imbibed in pills [uppers and downers]. In that video clip that Cali Chris posted where she is wearing what looks like a nightgown, that is that she was \"on.\" Uppers. And you can tell.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a whole lot more that would make a lot of things more clearer, regarding her and the artists she was associated with, but can't be talked about openly. There's family members to consider and some things are better left unsaid.\n\nBTW-Don't believe for a minute that FANIA/Masucci thought La Lupe was too difficult to handle and decided not to market her. That's an \"answer for public consumption\" that writers have repeated from certain sources. Masucci invested a lot of money in a sick Cheo Feliciano who was withdrawing from heroin use and waited two years for him to get 'clean' and risked being embarrased if he \"fell off the wagon.\" Hector LaVoe was a straight up addict, was constantly late to engagements and failed to show up to a lot of them. That didn't stop Masucci from pouring money into recording him. La Lupe was denied for the same reason that Tito Puente was denied, along with Joe Cuba, Charlie P., and various other band leaders that were already well established stars in the industry. It was about money. heo had a 1 year contract, every year. There was never any guarantee. Hector LaVoe had zero publishing rights to his compositions and was another artist who was low balled by Fania.\n\nLa Lupe was at her peak in 1972. She had mainstream crossover notoriety. Why would Jerry Masucci care if she was a pill? That she couldn't be handled. That's a lot of bogus. He didn't want to pay her. They ripped off all of their artists. Fact. She was phased out the same way Tito Puente got phased out. He didn't record again until the late 1970s. FANIA did the exact same thing that the commercial Salsa Romantica record labels of the 1990s did to the 70s Salsa generation. They phased them out and paid off the jockeys to play their artists and signed them to what amounted to deals that benifitted the record company moreso than the artist. Few, if anyone at RMM, got any royalties. Including the ones like La India and several others whose contracts stipulated they were supposed to.\n\nLa Lupe was not homeless. Her home burned down that she lived in with Willie Garcia. She was living in her apartment in the Bronx. It was a house like before, but she was neither homeless, nor destitute. In fact, the scene itself, the promoters and even some band leaders who I won't mention publicly because it would raise a major stink had a hand in her being left out to dry.\n\nOne thing you gotta know about the scene and life in general is that there's a lot more \"legend\" than there is truth. Unfortunately, more people want the legend. Because, for the, it makes for a much better story, than to learn that their heroes were pond scum and were not very nice people.\n\nI'm sorry guys. That should read \"It was NOT a house like before...\".\n\nI hope it not true that she was broke but I have read many many times that she was destitute. Here are a couple...There are many sides to any story.\n\n\"By 1975, Fania’s new rising star was Cruz, and La Lupe’s career was on the decline. Fania Records ended her contract, and Lupe became destitute.\n\nBy 1985, La Lupe had rebounded from a descent into homelessness. Having been a lifelong practitioner of Santeria, she then became a born-again Christian, preaching in evangelical testimonials.\" PBS.org\n\n\"La Lupe's life soon became consumed by alcoholism and drug addiction. Her drug-addict husband, who was later diagnosed as a schizophrenic, became abusive towards her. Between his hospital bills and her endless donations to Santeros, she went broke. The despair that now defined her life began to taint her professional life as she became more and more of a burden to her associates. According to Tito Puente, she her refusal to convert to salsa music and sticking with traditional musica tropical would soon make her a hasbeen. He decided to part ways with her.\"\n\n\"In \"Oriente,\" she beautifully emotes her falling out with Tito Puente as she shouts \"Ay ay ay, Tito Puente me botó!\"- a loose translation of 'he kicked me out.' She was the first Latin singer to sell out of Madison Square Garden, but some how once ended up homeless and destitute. She traveled around the world, wowing audiences with her musical genius but is relatively unknown to many fans of Latin music. La Lupe was as much passionate and talented as she was troubled. Once loved, but now forgotten, she lived a life free of apologies or restrictions. It may have worked to her detriment but that's what makes her legacy so incredible.\"\n\n\"Fania Records, ended her contract in the late 1970s, perhaps simply because of falling sales. She retired in 1980, and found herself destitute by the early 1980s. In 1984 she injured her spine; she initially used a wheelchair, then later a cane. An electrical fire made her homeless. After being “healed” at an evangelical Christian Crusade, La Lupe abandoned her Santeria roots and became a born-again Christian. In 1991, she gave a concert at La Sinagoga in New York, singing Christian songs.\"\n\nBeing Latino\n\nI know she was a star then...But 68 was the year she stopped touring with Puente, as far as I have read.\n\nSo what does that tell you? If she was so crazy, why did he hook up with her? Why did Mongo bother with her before TP? Why was TICO records invested in her? The split had nothing to do with her personality or what people have assumed her persona to have been like.\n\nAnd I have read Mambo Diablo...but there are always other stories that don't make it into biographies.\n\nThe point I was making to you is that if you read the book, this squeaky clean image he was supposed to have had, is a unicorn.\n\nYeah IMO T. Puente had a clean cut image...I think she was probably a bit out there for him.\n\nWithout trying to sound arrogant about it, I recommend you read the book again. Was an image presented to the public that revolved around him smiling and saying no to drugs and being a positive figures that represented the music? Yes. Certainly. Did it reflect real life? What does the book show? What type of language was he using behind closed doors. What kind of leisurely past time did he indulged in off stage? Take that into account when examining whether or not La Lupe was \"too out there for him.\"\n\nShe was way ahead of her time\n\nShe was an artist. She was a composer. All the BS that has been perpetuated about her personal life and every other imperfect artist merely takes away from people looking at them or the music in any serious manner. This is a general comment and not squarely directed towards you. The personal stuff is interesting and sometimes even fascinating. But it definitely takes away from viewing La Lupe as we should. The same way audiences focus on Hector LaVoe. A high, drunken buffoon. It takes away from the fact that these people devoted their lives to a craft. They studied. They created. Contributed. Innovated. That is what gets lost in these re-interpretations and guessing about the quirks within their lives. Hector LaVoe is a perfect example of this. When you mention his name, they don't think \"Composer.\" People automatically think \"Junkie.\" In real life, people are complex. They are technicolor. Not Black or White.\n\nI hope it not true that she was broke but I have read many many times that she was destitute. Here are a couple...There are many sides to any story.\n\nI agree with you. However, many of the claims in those stories can actually be verified and corroborated and or disproven.\n\n\"By 1975, Fania’s new rising star was Cruz, and La Lupe’s career was on the decline. Fania Records ended her contract, and Lupe became destitute.\n\nThat's the generaliation that was made. The reality was that La Lupe had no contract with FANIA. Her deal was with TICO Records. Fania controlled TICO by 1972. She was blacklisted by Masucci before 1975. What's my proof? Name a recording issued by TICO under FANIA prior to 1975? They blacklisted Tito as well. Her contract ended, she was not renewed. She was going through personal problems, which FANIA helped to create by putting a muzzle on her recording career. But she was STILL performing at clubs, theaters, etc. She performed at the Teatro Puerto Rico in the late 1970s backed by the Machito Orchestra. This event was documented thru video. What I saw was an audience clamoring for her just like they did at Carnegie Hall years earlier when she reunited on stage with Tito Puente for the TICO-ALEGRE concert. So this idea that she was on the decline is a point of view by someone who wrote a text for a documentary of her life. If that was the case, then one coudl argue that Tito Puente and Joe Cuba and many other artists were on the decline in the 1970s, based on their total recording outputs. But they were gigging 7 nights a week. That is a fact. You have to look at books and some written text that is out there as primer's and not as gospel. Any decline or rise is purely subjective. To say that Celia was a rising star in 1975 when he had been singing since 1947, is pretty ridiculous. I understand the context it was posed as. It was in direct relation to her asociation as a Fania artist. But Celia was already an established star. It was the newbies and johnny come latelys, the youth of the era of the '70s who were being introduced to her via this vehicle called \"Salsa.\"\n\nBy 1985, La Lupe had rebounded from a descent into homelessness. Having been a lifelong practitioner of Santeria, she then became a born-again Christian, preaching in evangelical testimonials.\" PBS.org\n\nAccording to her daughter Rainbow, she was living with her. La Lupe was living in the projects when she passed. The term homelessness makes it come across as if she were on the street with a sign that read \"Will sing for food.\" She was not financially capable in comparison to her personal finances of the late 1960s and early '70s, but its a stretch to convey her as having been homeless. It's not meant to be literal. I wish there was some way I could offer a smoking gun but I can't. Its the text on PBS.org versus my text on a public forum. PBS.org will always win hands down. All I can tell you is that they are using half truths and over-dramatizing her biography, for what it's worth.\n\nAccording to Tito Puente, she her refusal to convert to salsa music and sticking with traditional musica tropical would soon make her a hasbeen. He decided to part ways with her.\"\n\nReading this comment, does this make sense? Tito, the man who claimed \"Salsa\" was for food and not a music?\n\nThat is a line of BS, whoever wrote that. Tito would never have made such a comment.\n\n\"In \"Oriente,\" she beautifully emotes her falling out with Tito Puente as she shouts \"Ay ay ay, Tito Puente me botó!\"- a loose translation of 'he kicked me out.'\n\nThis proves that he kicked her out. But it doesn't suggest why.\n\nIf you have two bulls in a cage with a prime rib steak in between them, only one of them is going to eat it. Focus on this analogy and apply it to these musical figures.\n\nShe was the first Latin singer to sell out of Madison Square Garden\n\nThis is false and anyone can actually prove this by making a phone call to MSG, as I did. The ONLY \"Salsa\" or Latin Music artist that has ever sold out Madison Square Garden, all by their lonesome has been Marc Anthony. No one else before him. This is directly form the offices of MSG. For concerts, the arena hold sup to 19K. Fania All-Stars have never sold out. The annual Salsa Festivals there had never sold out. They came close, But never completely selling out the arena. Just like the numbers for the Yankee Stadium attendance being 50K for the Fania All Stars is also false.\n\nShe traveled around the world, wowing audiences with her musical genius but is relatively unknown to many fans of Latin music.\n\nA huge misconception with this statement. Ask anyone at FANIA today or yesterday. The Codigo company or the eMusica folks who owned it before them. Aong the artists in the catalog who sold units, La Lupe was among them. It's Hector LaVoe, Willie Colon, Ruben Blades, Celia Cruz and La Lupe. Every other artist is a distant second, third, etc. It's why most compilations are revolved around their music.\n\n\"Fania Records, ended her contract in the late 1970s, perhaps simply because of falling sales.\n\nWhoever wrote this was speculating and again, what sales? She did not record again until the late 1970s. By then, she was not being promoted.\n\nShe retired in 1980, and found herself destitute by the early 1980s. In 1984 she injured her spine; she initially used a wheelchair, then later a cane. An electrical fire made her homeless. After being “healed” at an evangelical Christian Crusade, La Lupe abandoned her Santeria roots and became a born-again Christian. In 1991, she gave a concert at La Sinagoga in New York, singing Christian songs.\"\n\nThis sounds a lot more like reality. They stuck to what could be corroborated. Although I do remember she was still performing during this same period. She still had a fan base and in one concert which is on youtube, Tito Puente joined her on stage. This would have been around 1986.\n\nI completely disagree...Personal lives of artists are fascinating and shape who they are and often comes out in their art. I know that Jim Morrison was a alcoholic, Hendrix, Joplin and many other amazing artists were addicts and troubled but that takes nothing away from their music or art. Absolutely nothing.\n\nIt does take away. Case in point is how they have been depicted in biopics and what how they are revisioned by others.\n\nThese things should only be discussed as it relates in some fashion to the music. A song like \"El Cantante\" is significantly related to Hector's drug use because he recorded it during a period when his personal demons were really knawing at him and the song came at the right time and kind of reinvigorated his career because he now had a mega-hit on his hands.\n\nIf you're just talking about his arrest record for the sake of talking about it because its fascinating, what does it have to do with the music itself? Ismael Rivera's experiences being incarcerated in the tombs can be discussed since he wrote a song about it called LAS TUMBAS. You explain it in that context. What does anyone gain by referring to his last days living all by himself, asking people for money so he could have a fix? Nothing is gained by sharing those sort of anecdotes and it DOES, in fact, take away from their personal artistry because it takes the spotlight away from what they put into that artistry. Hector's so great and his music speaks for itself, but how come more people know that he abused drugs at one point in his life than they know about how many composition he wrote. How many would identifyhim as a composer over being a singer and heroin addict. Something the film by Jennifer Lopez dropped the ball on as far as accuracy was concerned. By 1975 he had kicked his habit and became a Santero. Yet, the opening of that film has him in some shooting gallery in the lower east side shooting up. Another false impression created by people's own imagination.\n\nIt's something to think about. It's a responsibility no one ever thinks about when they attempt to cover an artist's life. You don't have to put every single thing a person does or engages in. Not when the focus of one's attention or introduction to a figure is by way of their craft. None of the anti-social behavior has or had anything to do with it and should only be inserted into the dialogue if its necessary. As in whether the art reflects life or not. But to just have XYZ was being followed by the DEA in such and such year, why should people know this? Any more than sharing that they cheated on their spouses or hit their children, etc."
