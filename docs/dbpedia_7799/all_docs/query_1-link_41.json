        "text": "June is Caribbean Heritage Month and this Friday in New York City La Lupe, one of the most important singers in Caribbean music, will be celebrated with a tribute show in conjunction with the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute and the City College of New York and Pregones Theater.\n\nBorn Lupe Victoria Yol√≠ Raymond, La Lupe (also known as La Yiyiyi) was instrumental in bringing Latin music to America and was one of the most groundbreaking female artists of her time. Rising to fame during the 1960s with a sound that has been compared to Eartha Kitt and Janis Joplin, the Cuban-born singer and innovator quickly became known for her vibrant and energetic performances and paved the way for some of today's most popular artists like Rihanna. She was also part of the group of performers under the renowned Fania record label who worked to internationalize Afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nFriday night's La Diva-La Lupe! show is the culmination of a week's worth of activities surrounding the iconic singer and will bring together Nuyorican poet, vocalist, and award-winning performer Caridad de La Luz \"La Bruja,\" Nina Rodriguez, and Puerto Rico's Calma Carmona, with special guests like mambo legend Johnny \"Dandy\" Rodriguez, to honor the life and legacy of La Lupe.\n\nDon't miss La Diva-La Lupe! on Friday, June 9 at 7:30 p.m. at Aaron Davis Hall at the City College of New York. Get tickets here."
