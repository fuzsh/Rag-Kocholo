        "text": "On Friday, June 9, Cuban-born legend La Lupe was honored with a tribute concert at CUNY's Aaron Davis Hall.\n\nCurated by the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute, City College Center for the Arts, and Pregones Theater, the show brought together the new divas of Latin music in celebration of the life of the Queen of Latin Soul, who was instrumental in bringing Latin music to America and was one of the most groundbreaking female artists of her time. The headlining acts—Caridad De La Luz \"La Bruja,\" Nina Rodriguez, and Calma Carmon—brought La Lupe's music into the 21st century by integrating modern sounds and spoken word with traditional rhythms.\n\nThe night kicked off with an incredibly inspired performance from Bronx-born poet, actress, and vocalist \"La Bruja,\" who mesmerized the audience with passion-infused vocals.\n\nThe divas were also joined by special guest Johnny \"Dandy\" Rodriguez, mambo legend and former member of the Tito Puente Orchestra who often performed with La Lupe. He was brought on stage to share his experience working alongside the two music heroes.\n\nLa Lupe paved the way for acts like Rihanna to rise to fame. Friday night's show was the culmination of a series of activities surrounding the iconic Cuban performer and her legacy. With a a highly involved audience that sang and danced along with the artists throughout the night, La Diva-La Lupe! was a sold-out success."
