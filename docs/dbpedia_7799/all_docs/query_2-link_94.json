        "text": "Today’s Google Doodle is honouring US Hispanic Heritage Month with an animation of the prominent American “Nuyorican” musician and internationally-renowned entertainer, Tito Puente.\n\nThe doodle, which is illustrated by New York-based Puerto Rican artist Carlos Aponte, shows Puente drumming through various points in his life.\n\nWho was Tito Peunte?\n\nBorn Ernest Anthony Puente Jr on 20 April, 1923, Tinto Puente was an American musician, songwriter and bandleader of Puerto Rican descent – best known for his dance-orientated mambo and Latin jazz pieces.\n\nHis parents were both from Puerto Rico and the family lived in New York City’s Spanish Harlem area. He lived in the city until he was drafted into the Navy in 1942 to serve in World War II. He was discharged after three years in order to study music at Juilliard School of Music, where he learned to conduct and orchestrate.\n\nHe grew to the height of his popularity in the 50s, when he helped bring Afro-Cuban and Carribean sounds to the masses in America. He played multiple instruments including piano, saxophone, vibraphone, and timbales – a type of twin drum often used in Latin music.\n\nHis compositions spanned an acclaimed 50-year career, which saw him compose famous songs like Oye Como Va and soundtracks to many films, such as The Mambo Kings and Calle 54. He also made some famous appearances on shows including the Simpsons and Sesame Street.\n\nTito died after suffering a massive heart attack following a show in Puerto Rico in 2001. He was flown to New York, where he passed away from surgery complications on June 1 2001, aged 77.\n\nTito Puento’s songs\n\nDance Mania, was probably Puente’s most famous album – but he was well-loved for hundreds of songs, including:\n\nRan kan kan\n\nMambo Gozon\n\nQuimbara\n\nQue te pedí\n\nI Like it\n\nMambo Birdland\n\nAy Cariño\n\nOye como va\n\nNiña Y Señora\n\nTimbale Solo\n\nSalsa Y Sabor\n\nPara Los Rumberos\n\nMambo Beat\n\nMambo Gallego\n\nPicadillo\n\nTito On Timbales\n\nOyo como va\n\nEl Rey del Timbal\n\nDéjame Soñar\n\nHong Kong Mambo\n\nEl Cayuco\n\nTake Five\n\nPachito Eché\n\nBabarabatiri\n\nLa Guarachera\n\nHay que trabajar\n\nSabor Gitano\n\nAbaniquito\n\nMaria Cervantes\n\nA Gozar Timbero\n\nLullaby of Birdland\n\nWhat is US Hispanic Heritage Month?\n\nEvery year, the USA holds National Hispanic Heritage Month from September 15 to October 15 – celebrating the history, music and culture of its citizens whose family background originates from Spain, Mexico, the Latin Caribbean and Central and South America.\n\nSeptember 15 is significant because it is the anniversary of independence for Latin American countries Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua"
