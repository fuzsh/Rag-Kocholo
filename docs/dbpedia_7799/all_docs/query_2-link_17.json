        "text": "(1923–2000). American bandleader, composer, and musician Tito Puente was one of the leading figures in Latin jazz, known for his bravura showmanship. He was nicknamed the “King of Mambo,” referring to a dance form of Cuban origin. With other Latin musicians such as Tito Rodríguez and Pérez Prado, Puente helped give rise to the golden age of mambo in the 1950s.\n\nErnesto Antonio Puente, Jr., was born on April 20, 1923, in New York, New York. The son of Puerto Rican immigrants, he grew up in New York City’s Spanish Harlem neighborhood. Puente became a professional musician at age 13. He later studied at the Juilliard School, a prestigious school of music and other performing arts in New York City. Eventually Puente learned to play a number of instruments, including the piano, saxophone, vibraphone, and timbales (paired high-pitched drums). After an apprenticeship in the historic Machito Orchestra (a Latin jazz group), he served in the navy during World War II.\n\nIn 1947 Puente formed his own 10-piece band. Two years later he expanded the group to include four trumpets, three trombones, and four saxophones, as well as a number of percussionists and vocalists. The band had a string of mambo dance hits, and Puente’s infectious energy and dynamic stage presence quickly made him a star. As his reputation grew, so too did his repertoire. In addition to mambo, he began to play other Latin and Afro-Cuban dance rhythms such as Dominican merengue, Brazilian bossa nova, and Cuban cha-cha—music styles that were later called salsa. Aside from his activities as a bandleader and instrumentalist, Puente also wrote many songs. His most popular songs were “Babarabatiri”, “Ran Kan Kan”, and “Oye Como Va.”"
