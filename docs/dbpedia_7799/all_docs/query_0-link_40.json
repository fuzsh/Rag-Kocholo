        "text": "La Lupe was born Dec. 23, 1936, in Santiago, Cuba, and given the name of Lupe Victoria Yoli Raymond. She grew up listening to such vocalists as Rita Montaner, Olga Guillot and Celia Cruz.\n\nLupe came from a family of very modest means. She studied hard and eventually became a schoolteacher. Still, her heart was captivated by music.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Lupe landed a job with a trio in Cuba. Her experience with them taught her what paying her dues was all about.\n\nIn 1958, she went solo and started singing at a cabaret called La Red, where she interpreted songs by Nat \"King\" Cole, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and even Elvis Presley. As a result, Lupe — who was only 23 — began to get noticed, along with other Cuban singers such as Elena Burke, Omara Portuondo and Celia Cruz and the Puerto Rican singer Myrta Silva. She was standing her ground with some of the big names of her time. In 1961 Lupe recorded her first album, \"La Lupe — con el Diablo en el Cuerpo Fiebre\" — translation: \"Fever.\" Yes, folks, it was the Peggy Lee hit. Well, guess what? It was also a big hit for La Lupe.\n\nLA LUPE STAYED in Cuba until 1962. In spite of the Castro regime, she was permitted to leave; many other artists did, too. La Lupe wanted to pursue the American dream and reach a level of fame similar to that of Chita Rivera, Rita Moreno, Miguelito Valdez, Machito and his sister, Graciela (Latin music's \"First Lady of Song\").\n\nThrough contacts and friends, La Lupe found work at the famous La Barraca nightclub. News of the new singer traveled fast, reaching even the man of \"Mister Watermelon Man\" fame, Mongo Santamaria. It was through Riverside Records that Mongo recorded the \"Mongo Introduces La Lupe\" album. This won her instant national recognition. She performed with Santamaria at the Apollo Theatre, the Palladium Ballroom, plus other prominent venues. In 1963, she was pregnant, and stopped touring with Santamaria.\n\nIn 1964, Lupe debuted with the \"King of Latin Music,\" Tito Puente. It was during that time that I first met La Lupe. I found her to be eccentric, witty and funny. For me, she was an artist who was ahead of her time. She performed with Puente on many of the major television shows, including those hosted by Dick Cavett and Johnny Carson.\n\nPUENTE BECAME a mentor to La Lupe. He provided support and nurturing and helped her refine her style of singing. When they appeared live, he provided her with an atmosphere where she could express her creativity. Contrary to popular belief, La Lupe was not part of the Tito Puente Orchestra. She recorded with him and appeared with him but only as contracted. After Tito and La Lupe recorded five albums together, they did not record together again.\n\nWhen La Lupe sold out Carnegie Hall in 1969, she was the first Latin female artist to do so. She was also the first Latin female artist to appear at Madison Square Garden's first Latin concert, where she performed alongside Tito Puente's Orchestra.\n\nLa Lupe was considered a major force in Latin music during the 1960s and '70s. By the early 1980s, her popularity started to fade. Her flamboyant style, combined with poor management, brought her professional era to an end.\n\n?Vamos!\n\nBy Suehaydee Rivera\n\nsrivera@th-record.com\n\n?
