        "text": "American Latin jazz and mambo musician (1923–2000)\n\nMusical artist\n\nErnest Anthony Puente Jr. (April 20, 1923 – June 1, 2000),[1] commonly known as Tito Puente, was an American musician, songwriter, bandleader, timbalero, and record producer. He composed dance-oriented mambo and Latin jazz music.\n\nPuente and his music have appeared in films including The Mambo Kings and Fernando Trueba's Calle 54. He guest-starred on television shows, including Sesame Street and The Simpsons two-part episode \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\".\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nPuente was born on April 20, 1923, at Harlem Hospital Center in the New York borough of Manhattan, the son of Ernest and Felicia Puente, Puerto Ricans living in New York City's Spanish Harlem.[2][3] His family moved frequently, but he spent the majority of his childhood in Spanish Harlem.[2] Puente's father was the foreman at a razor blade factory.[4] His family called him Ernestito, Spanish for Little Ernest, and this became shortened to \"Tito\".[5]\n\nAs a child, he was described as hyperactive, and after neighbors complained of hearing seven-year-old Puente beating on pots and window frames, his mother sent him to 25-cent piano lessons.[4] He switched to percussion by the age of 10, drawing influence from jazz drummer Gene Krupa.[4] He later created a song-and-dance duo with his sister Anna in the 1930s and intended to become a dancer, but an ankle tendon injury prevented him from pursuing dance as a career.[3][4] When the drummer in Machito's band was drafted to the army, Puente subsequently took his place.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nPuente served in the Navy for three years during World War II after being drafted in 1942.[6] He was discharged with a Presidential Unit Citation for serving in nine battles on the escort aircraft carrier USS Santee (CVE-29) where his duties included playing alto saxophone and clarinet in the ship's big band as well as occasionally drum set, piano during mess hall, acting as the ship's bugler, and serving as a machine gunner during battles. The G.I. Bill allowed him to study music at Juilliard School of Music, where he completed his formal education in conducting, orchestration, and theory after three years.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Puente was at the height of his popularity and helped to bring Cuban and Caribbean sounds like mambo, son, and cha-cha-chá, to mainstream audiences. His album Dance Mania was released in 1958.\n\nAmong his compositions is the cha-cha-chá song \"Oye Cómo Va\" (1963),[8] popularized by Latin rock musician Carlos Santana and later interpreted, among others, by Julio Iglesias, Irakere and Celia Cruz. In 1969, he received the key to the City of New York from former Mayor John Lindsay. In 1992, he was inducted into the National Congressional Record and in 1993, he received the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal from the Smithsonian Institution.[9]\n\nPuente is one of the subjects of La Época – The Palladium Era,[10] a documentary about the Palladium era in New York, Cuban music and rhythms, mambo and salsa as dances and music and much more. The documentary discusses many of Puente's, as well as Arsenio Rodríguez's, contributions and features interviews with some of the musicians Puente recorded with.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nPuente's oldest son Ron Puente is from a first marriage to Mirta Sanchez. Richard \"Richie\" Puente was the percussionist in the 1970s funk band Foxy. Puente's youngest son, Tito Puente Jr., has performed and recorded many of Puente's songs. His daughter Audrey Puente is a television meteorologist for WNYW and WWOR-TV in New York City.\n\nAfter a show in Puerto Rico on May 31, 2000, Puente suffered a massive heart attack and was flown to New York City for surgery to repair a heart valve, but complications developed, and he died on June 1, 2000.[11] He was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003.\n\nAwards and recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1995, Puente received the Billboard Latin Music Lifetime Achievement Award.[12]\n\nOn September 10, 2007, a United States Post Office in Spanish Harlem was named after him at a ceremony presided over by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Charles Rangel and Rep. José Serrano.\n\nAn amphitheater was named after him at Luis Muñoz Marín Park, next to the Roberto Clemente Coliseum, in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nIn 1995, Puente was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.[13]\n\nPuente performed at the closing ceremonies at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. The timbales he used are displayed at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1997, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts.[14]\n\nIn 1990, he received a Star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame.[15]\n\nIn 1984, he received an honorary Decree from the Los Angeles City Council.\n\nOn June 5, 2005, Puente was honored by Union City, New Jersey with a star on the Walk of Fame at Union City's Celia Cruz Park.[16]\n\nIn 1999, he was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.[17]\n\nOn May 19, 1999, he received an honorary Mus.D degree from Columbia University.[18][19]\n\nOn August 20, 2000, East 110th Street in Spanish Harlem was named 'Tito Puente Way'.\n\nIn 2011, the US Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp in his likeness as part of their Latin Legends series. [20]\n\nOn October 11, 2022, Puente was honored with a Google Doodle in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month.[21]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAs leader\n\n[edit]\n\nAs sideman\n\n[edit]\n\nWith Dizzy Gillespie\n\nRhythmstick (1990)\n\nWith Benny Golson\n\nRemembering Clifford (Milestone, 1998)\n\nWith Quincy Jones\n\nQuincy Plays for Pussycats (Mercury, 1959–65 [1965])\n\nWith Hilton Ruiz\n\nRhythm in the House (RMM, 1976 [1998])\n\nWith Sonny Stitt\n\nThe Matadors Meet the Bull (Roulette, 1965)\n\nWith Bobby Sanabria\n\n¡NYC Aché!

In the shows, Puente joins Springfield Elementary School as a music teacher after the school discovers it is located over an oil well. However, Mr. Burns manages to pump the oil first, which makes him the legal owner of the well. This causes the school to fall into debt with budget cuts to the music and maintenance departments, causing Puente to lose his job. When Burns is later shot, Puente becomes one of the prime suspects but manages to clear himself by performing one of his songs for Chief Wiggum. Seven alternative endings were filmed of various characters shooting Burns; Puente is one of the alternates. Although all endings were animated, the ending of Maggie Simpson shooting Burns was the ending chosen to air.\n\nThe Emmy-nominated song \"Señor Burns\" from the episode is featured on both the 1997 album Songs in the Key of Springfield and the 1999 album Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nSteven Loza (1999) Tito Puente and the Making of Latin Music, University of Illinois Press\n\nJosephine Powell (2007) \"Tito Puente: When The Drums Are Dreaming\", (Authorhouse 2007)"
