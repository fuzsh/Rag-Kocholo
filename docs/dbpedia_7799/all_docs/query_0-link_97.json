        "text": "Jessi Campo first began singing and writing songs on her guitar at the age of 12. Jessi’s specialty is to capture a memorable moment through her lyrics and interpretations so that each person who is present feels her music. As a bilingual singer-songwriter and accomplished entertainer, Campo has toured Asia extensively, and had a performance role singing in Hebrew in the feature film Striptease during a scene featuring Burt Reynolds.\n\nInspired by family, especially parents Giovanni and Nina, who performed with many famous Latin music icons such as Tito Puente, Perez Prado, Beny More, and more, Jessi has released four full-length recordings: How Can I (2000), 2013’s At Last, Con Corazon in 2014, and La Pasión de La Lupe (2016). Seven of her songs earned placement in the 2016 Dream Act legislation feature film called El Sueño, which premiered in El Paso, TX.\n\nFriday, Jan 5, 2018 8:00pm – 10:00pm\n\nEvent Fees\n\nGeneral Admission $ 30.00\n\nReserved Table Seating $ 40.00\n\nPremium Table Seating $ 45.00"
