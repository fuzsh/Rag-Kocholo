        "text": "Mi Socio - Tito Puente Jr featuring Melina Almodovar \"La Muñeca de La Salsa!\" Review written by Jimmy Castro for Ritmo Caribe Promotions (May 27, 2017)\n\nAfter listening to Tito Puente Jr’s new single “Mi Socio” featuring Puerto Rican vocalist Melina Almodovar “La Muñeca de La Salsa”, which is a remake of the original version (1965) arranged, produced and performed by his father Tito Puente featuring Cuban vocalist La Lupe, I have absolutely nothing but “rave” comments about it!\n\nIn my opinion, Tito Puente Jr for many years, and to this day, had and has been compared to his father’s style and sound of music. I will admit, I at times have to include myself in that judgement. Today, I personally don’t think that was the case for Tito Puente Jr, in that I believe he has only been committed to paying homage, through his own music and career, to a man he dearly loved and respected, and also had to have found it a distinct honor to be compared, positively or negatively, to his father, Tito Puente.\n\nNow to the tune, “Mi Socio” which is celebrating its official worldwide release on June 2, 2017. As, not only a promoter of Latin music, but as a fan of Salsa music, Tito Puente Jr’s new version of “Mi Socio” gave me a piece of everything I want in a Salsa tune, and then some! It gave me a taste of that great Mambo era sound, which his father was of course a big part of….it gave me a taste of that old school Salsa, and that distinct “Fania” sound that continues to try to be emulated by today’s Salsa artists from around the world (no offense to those Salsa artists, in which there are some great ones)….it gave me a taste of the excellent coros, that in my opinion are still a vital ingredient in a tune becoming a true hit in today’s market….it gave me a taste of an excellent arrangement, even though “Mi Socio” is a remake of an original, the arrangement was unique in its own way….it gave me a taste of an excellent brass and rhythms section, also vital in a true Salsa hit….it gave me a taste of an excellent timbal solo (which in my opinion was a bit too short)….it gave me a taste of an incredible vocal performance, which definitely did justice to the original tune’s vocal performance….and finally, it gave me a taste of a Salsa tune that will have dancers around the world jumping up from their seats, if they are not on the dance floor already, as soon as the first note is played at their favorite Salsa clubs!\n\nThis tune makes me so proud and honored to be a Latin music promoter with Ritmo Caribe Promotions, and I want to personally congratulate Tito Puente Jr for producing a tune that many, including his father, will also be proud of, and are sure to enjoy. In addition, I would like to congratulate my friend, Melina Almodovar “La Muñeca de La Salsa” for being the best choice as lead vocalist on this tune, “Mi Socio!” Te Botaste Melina!\n\nIf you haven’t heard this tune as of yet, after reading this review, you can purchase at the Amazon link below! If you don’t agree with my review, that's cool, no problem…but if you agree, please share this information (and tune) with anybody you know who is a fan of Salsa! ©RitmoCaribePromotions\n\nTO PURCHASE \"MI SOCIO\" BY TITO PUENTE JR.
