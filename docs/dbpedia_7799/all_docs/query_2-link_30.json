        "text": "Tito Puente - Biography\n\nb. Ernesto Antonio Puente Jnr., 20 April 1923, Harlem Hospital, New York City, New York, USA. Born of Puerto Rican parentage, Tito began piano lessons when he was seven years old and around the age of 10 he started tuition in drums and percussion, which became his forte. Around 1936, Puente commenced his professional career as a drummer with the orchestra of Noro Morales. In 1941 he played with the Machito band. World War II intervened and Tito was drafted into the US Navy for three years' service. After his discharge he took courses at New York's Juilliard School of Music and did stints with the bands of JosÈ Curbelo and Fernando Alvarez between 1946 and 1947. With Curbelo, Puente performed alongside Tito RodrÌguez, who later became his arch-rival.\n\nTito's reputation as a sizzling arranger quickly grew and led to numerous assignments from prominent bandleaders. Even RodrÌguez hired him to write the charts for four numbers he recorded with his Mambo Devils on Gabriel Oller's SMC (Spanish Music Center) label. In the late 40s, while Tito was performing the roles of contractor, arranger and timbales player with Pupi Campo's orchestra, he organized a group that promoter Federico Pagani dubbed the Picadilly Boys ('Picadillo' meaning: beef or pork hash) after being impressed by their performance of the latin jam style (descarga). With them, Puente recorded a number of sides for SMC. Shortly afterwards, he renamed his aggregation Tito Puente And His Orchestra. Tito used two lead vocalists, Angel Rosa and then Paquito Sosa, before settling for Cuban Vicentico ValdÈs as his resident lead singer. In late 1949, Puente organized a line-up of four trumpets, three trombones, four saxophones and a full rhythm section for a recording session for Tico Records. One recording from this session, leaving out the trombones and saxophones, resulted in a fiery version of 'Abaniquito'. With the help of English translation by disc jockey Dick 'Ricardo' Sugar, the song became one of the first crossover mambo hits. Between the late 40s and mid-50s, Puente issued recordings on Tico. During a suspension of recording by the company in 1950 - due to a wrangle between the co-founders, George Goldner and Art 'Pancho' Raymond - Puente recorded for the Seeco, Verne and RCA labels. Along with Tito RodrÌguez and Machito, Puente became one of the kings of the 50s mambo era. His consistent top billing at New York's Palladium Ballroom, the famed 'Home of the Mambo', became one of the areas of friction between himself and RodrÌguez. Puente switched to RCA Victor Records and between 1956 and 1960 he released a string of albums on the label, including the notable Cuban Carnival and his all-time bestseller, Dance Mania. The album marked the debut of Santos ColÛn (b. 1 November, Mayag¸ez, Puerto Rico) as Puente's new lead singer. ColÛn arrived in New York in 1950 and performed with the bands of Jorge LopÈs, Tony Novos and JosÈ Curbelo before joining Tito. He remained with Puente until 1970, when he departed to pursue a solo career and released a series of albums on Fania Records. Several of Puente's Tico and RCA Victor releases between the mid- to late 50s were entirely devoted to the cha cha ch· rhythm, which was enjoying considerable popularity at the time. At the beginning of the 60s, the pachanga style took over. One of the prime-movers of the dance craze was Afro-Cuban singer Rolando La Serie's 1960 smash hit recording of 'La Pachanga' with the Bebo ValdÈs band. The following year, while the fad was still raging at full force, Puente teamed up with La Serie to make Pachanga In New York for Gema Records. In 1960, Tito and His Orchestra journeyed to the west coast of America to record Exciting Band In Hollywood (aka Puente Now! ) for GNP Records. Upon his arrival, Puente contacted Los Angeles-based flautist Rolando Lozano (b. JosÈ Calazan Lozano, 27 August 1931, Cienfuegos, Santa Clara Province, Cuba), an alumnus of Orquesta AragÛn, Orquesta AmÈrica, Orquesta Nuevo Ritmo, Mongo SantamarÌa and Cal Tjader. Puente rejoined Tico Records (and remained with them until the mid-80s) to make Pachanga Con Puente, which yielded the big hit 'Caramelos'. 1962's El Rey Bravo was essentially a descarga set: an untypical Puente album, it stands as one of his strongest recordings. The disc featured Cuban violinist/flautist Pupi Legarreta and spawned the original version of Puente's perennial classic 'Oye Como Va', which was given a latin-rock treatment by Santana in 1970. Around 1965, Tito linked up with Alegre Records for Y Parece Bobo, which was produced by the label's founder, Al Santiago, and featured Chivirico D·vila on lead vocals. Santiago also co-produced Cuba Y Puerto Rico Son...on Tico, Puente's first in a series of collaborations with the 'Queen of Salsa' Celia Cruz. Tito also recorded a string of successful albums with La Lupe between 1965 and 1967, and made a couple of albums with Beny MorÈ's widow, Noraida, at the beginning of the 70s. On his late 60s releases, 20th Anniversary and The King Tito Puente, Tito was obliged to bow to the overwhelming popularity of the R&B/Latin fusion form called boogaloo. 'The Boogaloo meant nothing to me. It stunk', he said forthrightly in 1977. 'It hurt the established bandleaders. It was a dance Eddie Palmieri, I and other bandleaders didn't want to record but had to in order to keep up with the times' (quote from Latin Times )."
