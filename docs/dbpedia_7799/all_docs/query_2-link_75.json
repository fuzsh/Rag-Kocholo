José Feliciano is recognized as the first Latin Artist to effectively cross over into the English music market, opening the doors for other artists who now play an important role in the American music industry. As importantly, Feliciano has been acclaimed by critics around the world as “The greatest living guitarist.” José Feliciano has been awarded over forty-ﬁve Gold and Platinum records; he has won nineteen Grammy nominations, earned 9 Grammy Awards, including the “LARAS Award for Lifetime Achievement.”\n\nSon of the legendary American salsa and Latin jazz musician Tito Puente, TITO PUENTE, JR. carries his father with him. It’s in his looks, his joy, and his music. Always honoring his father’s legacy, he has also made a name for himself as one of the most exciting Latin musicians touring today. Tito Jr. is on a passionate mission, determined to nurture the musical legacy left by his father. He has found captive audiences who echo his passion. Crowds lured to a venue by the father are returning to see the son — and to once again participate in the high voltage celebration that takes place on stage. “A dazzling show filled with charisma, flair and all the right dance moves. His skill at playing, singing, and dancing was undeniable…Tito Puente Jr. shined with a talent that was all his own.” –The Examiner"
