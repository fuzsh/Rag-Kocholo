        "text": "You might say Tito Puente was born to connect cultures.\n\nPuente, after all, is the Spanish word for bridge.\n\nThe New York City native, born to parents from Puerto Rico, found fame the world over as the Latin King, the Mambo King or, simply, El Rey — the King, in Spanish.\n\nHis story is all American.\n\nFOX NATION'S NEW SERIES ‘MEET THE AMERICAN WHO’ TELLS OF ORDINARY AMERICANS WHO GAVE US EXTRAORDINARY INNOVATIONS\n\nBeloved for his multicultural percussion, Afro-Cuban rhythms and crossover compositions, Puente enjoyed acclaim that spanned generations and genres.\n\nThe timbale, a set of high-standing drums developed in Cuba in the early 20th century, was his specialty.\n\n\"Master drummer, percussionist, pianist, saxophonist, vocalist, composer, orchestrator, arranger and conductor,\" the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College wrote in a 2011 tribute about the favorite son.\n\n\"Out of the lengthy list of musicians who have contributed to the development and acceptance of our music throughout the world, none is more recognized than the man known simply as ‘the king.’\"\n\nHe was a \"master drummer, percussionist, pianist, saxophonist, vocalist, composer, orchestrator, arranger and conductor.\"\n\nYet much of his personal story is largely unknown, most notably his service at sea and his survival of one of the most frightening moments in the history of naval warfare.\n\nTeenage Puente joined the U.S. Navy at the outbreak of World War II and fought in battles across the globe.\n\n\"He was a proud American,\" his son, musician Tito Puente Jr., told Fox News Digital.\n\nPuente was buried with the full military honors of a grateful United States in New York State after his death in 2000.\n\nBut like many members of the Greatest Generation, he rarely talked about his war service.\n\nPuente had an infectious style of musicianship on stage — a wide smile and a look of joy that permeated his energetic performances.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO FOX NATION\n\nSaid Puente Jr., however, \"if you looked closely at his face, you could see the scars from World War II on his face.\"\n\nProdigy faces peril at sea\n\nErnest Anthony \"Tito\" Puente Jr. was born on April 20, 1923, in New York City.\n\nHis parents, Ernest Anthony and Ercilla (Ortiz) Puente, reportedly arrived in Manhattan shortly before their famous son was born.\n\nPuente’s father provided for his wife and children by working at a razor factory in Brooklyn.\n\nThe family lived at the corner of East 110th Street and Madison Avenue, according to Puente Jr., just a block from Central Park, in Spanish Harlem.\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO WROTE ‘AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL,' KATHARINE LEE BATES, PROFESSOR-POET PRAYED FOR UNITY\n\nPuente was a musical prodigy. He learned the piano at age 7, turned professional at age 13 and played over a dozen instruments.\n\n\"He got his first big break as a professional playing with the Machito Orchestra as the drummer in the early 1940s,\" Zach Smyers of the Hampton Roads Naval Museum wrote earlier this year.\n\n\"The Machito Orchestra, formed by Frank ‘Machito’ Grillo in 1939, combined Afro Cuban Jazz with traditional salsa music. The popularity of this hybrid genre continued to grow with fans.\"\n\nPuente was on the cusp of musical fame.\n\nThe world had other ideas.\n\n\"If you look closely at his face, you could see the scars from World War II on his face.\" — Tito Puente Jr.\n\nHe was just 18 when Japan launched its surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.\n\nHe was drafted by the U.S. Navy in 1942 and served aboard the escort carrier USS Santee (CVE-29) until the end of the war.\n\nHe was a shipboard musician and bugler. \"He's the one who played taps,\" said Puente Jr.\n\nBut like every sailor, he was trained to fight at sea.\n\nHe had plenty of opportunity aboard the Santee. The ship earned nine battle stars, from the invasion of North Africa in 1942 to the invasion of Okinawa in 1945.\n\n\"He never told us about it,\" said Puente Jr.\n\nThere is likely one day that his dad never forgot, even if he never shared the story.\n\nThe date Oct. 25, 1944, is heroic in military lore — it's known as St. Crispin's Day.\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO ‘WON THE WAR FOR US': ANDREW JACKSON HIGGINS, WORLD WAR II NEW ORLEANS BOATBUILDER\n\nThe Battle of Agincourt was fought on St. Crispin's Day in 1415. King Henry V, according to Shakespearean drama, delivered his famous \"Band of Brothers\" speech before defeating the French that day.\n\n\"From this day to the ending of the world/But we in it shall be remember’d/We few, we happy few, we band of brothers/For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.\"\n\n\"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\" immortalized by Alfred Lord Tennyson, took place on St. Crispin's Day in 1854.\n\nJapan unleashed a frightening new form of aerial warfare on St. Crispin's Day in 1944. The first kamikaze suicide planes attacked the U.S. Navy that day during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\n\n\"I believe it was very traumatic for him,\" said Puente Jr. \"He went from being a professional musician to watching his friends get killed in the war.\"\n\nThe USS Santee was among the first vessels struck by one of the desperate pilots.\n\nThe bomb-laden plane crashed into Puente's ship at top speed, tore a hole through the flight deck and exploded in the hangar, sending a fireball high above the carrier.\n\nFour crewmen, four of Santee's band of brothers, were killed in the explosion. An untold number were wounded.\n\nThe carrier was struck by a torpedo shortly afterward, causing the massive ship to list six feet.\n\n\"I believe it was very traumatic for him,\" said Puente Jr. \"He went from being a professional musician to watching his friends get killed in the war.\"\n\nWhether wounded during the kamikaze attack or in one of the ship's eight other battles, the musician bore minor shrapnel scars on his face the rest of his life, his son told Fox News Digital.\n\nTwo of the musician's three children, Tito and Audrey — the latter a meteorologist with Fox 5 in New York City — received a commendation from the Military Honor of the Purple Heart in their dad's honor in 2018.\n\nPuente Jr. never knew the details.\n\n\"I guess he got home and just wanted to hone in on music and composition,\" the son said. \"It's fortunate that his amazing talent survived the tragedy of nine battles.\"\n\n‘Oye Como Va’\n\nPuente indeed returned to music after the war, with an assist from Uncle Sam in honor of his service.\n\nHe attended New York City’s world-famous Juilliard School on the G.I. Bill and by the 1950s had emerged as a pioneering hitmaker of a hot new postwar American soundtrack.\n\nLatin music, flavors, cocktails and culture swept the nation, with Puente providing its most popular rhythms.\n\n\"Fans enjoyed the way Puente put a big band spin on traditional Latin dances, mixing Latin sounds with jazz and other genres,\" according to Biography.com.\n\n\"Puente later added other Latin and Afro-Cuban rhythms to his repertoire, including cha-cha, merengue, bossa nova and salsa, and his continuous experimentation and creativity earned him a reputation as a musical pioneer.\"\n\n\"Fans enjoyed the way Puente put a big band spin on traditional Latin dances, mixing Latin sounds with jazz and other genres.\"\n\nHe wrote and recorded his signature hit, \"Oye Como Va,\" in 1962.\n\nA modernized version of a traditional cha-cha, his \"Oye Como Va\" was essentially a Latin and pop crossover hit and a live performance favorite. It's now recognized as a standard of American music.\n\n\"Few songs have embraced so much of the Latin American spirit in popular music as ‘Oye Como Va,’\" Grammy.com reported in a review of the tune.\n\nIt became a worldwide smash for Mexican-American guitar prodigy Carlos Santana in 1970, who recorded and released it soon after his breakout performance at Woodstock.\n\n\"Santana’s version of ‘Oye Como Va’ … introduced Puente to a much larger audience,\" music editor Matt Micucci wrote for Jazziz.com in 2017.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\n\"As a result, Puente reintroduced the song in his repertoire. Furthermore, ‘el Rey’ began to get booked again at a difficult time when he had been struggling to keep his big band.\"\n\nThe huge hit for Santana also provided a windfall of royalties for the songwriter, who by then was pushing 50 — a dinosaur age (back then) with a big-band history in a world that had embraced pop and rock music.\n\nYet Puente's music still connected with a new generation of fans.\n\nPuente misread a royalty check soon after Santana's \"Oye Como Va\" became a hit, according to one tale.\n\nHe thought it was for $35. Instead, it was a check for $35,000.\n\n\"Everybody's heard of Santana. Santana! Beautiful Santana!\" Puente beamed later. \"He put our music, Latin rock, around the world, man!\"\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO FIRST RECORDED THE BLUES, NATION'S ORIGINAL POP DIVA MAMIE SMITH\n\nThe song continues to captivate global musicians and audiences.\n\nSantana re-recorded a version of the Puente tune in 2022 featuring 20 musicians from around the world.\n\n\"‘Oye Como Va’ has endured the test of time and continues to bring people together to dance and sing together, around the world,\" Puente Jr. told Rolling Stone magazine last year.\n\n‘Known all over the world’\n\nErnest Anthony \"Tito\" Puente Jr. died in a New York City hospital after he suffered heart trouble on May 31, 2000. His family was by his side.\n\nHe was 77 years old.\n\nThe \"popular bandleader\" was \"adored by fans across the globe\" and \"several supporters waited in line for days to say goodbye\" to him, wrote Biography.com of the vigil outside the hospital.\n\nHe’s buried at St. Anthony’s Church Cemetery in Nanuet, New York.\n\n\"Several supporters waited in line for days to say goodbye\" to Tito Puente.\n\n\"I can tell you that it's just a sad day, a sad day for the Latin music industry,\" Eddie Rodriguez, Puente's manager, told media outlets in the hours that followed the musician's death.\n\n\"Tito was known all over the world.\"\n\nHis success in music earned his children a lifestyle not known by the previous generation. He raised his children on the Upper West Side, not far from Lincoln Center, Manhattan’s sprawling entertainment complex, and his alma mater, The Juilliard School.\n\n\"We were the Puerto Rican Jeffersons,\" joked Puente Jr.\n\nIn 1997, Puente had released a 50-song multi-CD compendium of his greatest works — and shortly before his death he recorded his 120th album.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nHe received the National Medal of Arts from President Bill Clinton in 1997 and was honored by the Library of Congress as a \"living legend\" before his passing in 2000.\n\nEast 110th Street in Spanish Harlem, his childhood home, has since been dubbed Tito Puente Way.\n\nA huge mural of Puente playing timbale brightens the corner of Puente Way at Third Aveneue.\n\nPuente is celebrated with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nHe received six Grammy Awards, including a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003.\n\nHe played live for several presidents, his music provided beats for movie soundtracks and he starred, most notably, as himself in the 1992 movie \"The Mambo King.\"\n\nTo read more stories in this unique \"Meet the American Who…\" series from Fox News Digital, click here.\n\nHe even had a recurring role as himself on \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nPuente was \"the most influential artist in the development of Latin American music in the United States in the 20th century,\" biographer Steven Loza wrote in \"Tito Puente and the Making of Latin Music,\" noting the artist’s \"overwhelming\" body of work.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It is clear that Tito Puente ranks with the Ellingtons and the Beethovens — or, as those artists might put it, they rank with him.\""
