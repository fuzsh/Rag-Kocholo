        "text": "Tito Puente Jr. continues to keep his father’s musical legacy alive, while displaying his own extraordinary talents. Audiences that once filled venues to watch the King of Latin Music perform are lining up with their families to watch his son’s charisma shine on stage. He credits his father for the opportunities that have become available worldwide to all Latin artists. That special Puente magic is evident during all of his performances including shows at performing arts centers, casinos and jazz festivals throughout the country.\n\nI recently had the opportunity to conduct a phone interview with Tito Puente Jr. His positive energy and passion were evident from the start of our call.\n\nTito: Good morning. (Friendly and upbeat)\n\nMabel: Tito, thank you for taking the time to talk to me this morning. I really appreciate it. Everyone was familiar with your father’s musical legacy. They called him the King of Latin Music. I read somewhere that you jokingly say that you are not the prince, but more like the court jester. Why is that?\n\nTito: (He giggles.) Well, they use the terminology the King, el Rey. My father earned that title for being an excellent and prolific composer, arranger, producer and timbalero. He played 13 instruments, received multiple Grammy Awards and made hundreds of records. I can go on and on about his accolades. He earned that title. I think most would agree that standing next to Tito Puente, as a drummer, and watching him play was like being around music royalty. I felt very intimidated as many musicians. He was an absolute genius and a phenomenal percussion player –one of if not the best in Latin percussion. I like the court jester reference because it’s almost like the clown, if you will, next to the King. I use that term in a sporadic and jokester way. He was an incredible percussion player and very disciplined. I think it would take me longer than the length of his 50-year career to even come within an ounce of his talent. (He giggles and proceeds to speak with emotion.) He was just an amazing father, singer, humanitarian and percussion player. He was an all-around entertainer. That’s how I felt around him–less than worthy.\n\nMabel: I’m sure that your fans hold you up to very high standards as well. I find it interesting that despite growing up with your father, his music and all of the icons that he played with for years, you really enjoyed listening to Mötley Crüe and Aerosmith. Is it true that you didn’t have an interest in Latin music when you were younger?\n\nTito: (He laughs.) I had no interest in Latin music. I can honestly tell you that. I did not have an interest during my youth or while in high school. I was not feeling the Latin music. I thought it was very tropical (he pauses and ponders for a moment) and very street. It’s very authentic to the Caribbean. I wasn’t embracing my roots at that time. I was born and raised in New York City and had a fluctuation of different music entering into my home all the time. I was listening to hip-hop, rock and rap music. That was my first love. I still enjoy all those different genres of music. If you listen to my iPod, I have everything from Metallica to Slayer all the way to Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald (he giggles), along with everything in between. I wasn’t guiding my career towards Latin music. It wasn’t until I went on the road with my father. It was the clave, the rhythm. I gravitated to that more and more. That’s what really drove me to start playing Latin music in general. Then, of course, I went into Latin pop and Latin house music; But, I have always liked rock drummers. There’s Phil Collins and the group Rush. I am a fan to this day. I still love that style of playing, but the Latin rhythm has really captured me. My father enjoyed playing the guaguanco rhythms of the Afro-Cuban styles of mambo, rumba and cha-cha-cha, but his first love was always jazz. When he was growing up he liked Duke Ellington, Count Basie—that was his bag. He wanted to be a jazz guy. However, he was born and raised in New York City. He had those Puerto Rican traditional roots from the island and a love for Afro-Cuban rhythms. I guess he decided to mix the two and make Latin jazz. It was a whole new sound and vibe. Back in the 1950s, you had the big band sound. My father was one of the first orchestras to integrate jazz orchestrations with horns, Latin music and Latin percussion. He was one of the first to bring the Latin percussion to the front section of the orchestra. It had always been in the back. He was very innovative. That’s why Tito Puente will always be one of a kind. It’s a shame that we lost him 11 years ago. I try to continue his tradition today. I think it’s only right that my children, my son especially, continues that tradition too. Hopefully, he’ll pick up the sticks. He’s only three years old (he laughs), but I hope he’ll continue his grandfather’s tradition of performing Latin music.\n\nMabel: You called one of your albums “En los Pasos de Mi Padre,” which means in my father’s footsteps. What did that album mean to you? Was it difficult to make because it was somewhat personal?\n\nTito: It was 2003. This was about two years after he passed away. I went through a whole year of just mourning. The following year was a period of confusion as far as my direction. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my career. At that point, I was already touring and performing Latin house music and dance music. It was then that I started crossing over a bit and began playing percussion. I honed in on the timbales, congas, bongos and the sounds of the 2-3 clave, 3-2 clave and really caught on to it. I felt I needed some sort of guidance. With the blessings of my mom Margaret, my brother Ronnie and my sister Audrey, I created my own band. They said, “Why don’t you continue pop’s legacy? Do it the right way.” I was seeing a lot of tribute shows, concerts and tribute bands honoring my father, but they weren’t authentic. Nothing was coming from the heart. Why not include a family member in whatever tribute is done? Musicians have always had a lot of respect for my father. They were performing his music, but I felt there should have been something more. You can’t let a legacy like that just die. It needs to continue. For example, I don’t expect Michael Jackson’s children to take over and do what their father did. However, I do expect the kids to keep his traditions alive, learn the ways he did business and perhaps entertain in some way.\n\nMabel: Were you surprised by the success you had with the album “En los Pasos de Mi Padre?”\n\nTito: I could never replace my father. Those are big shoes to fill. I just do my best to keep his name alive around the world. The songs on the album represented the essence of Tito Puente from the dance mania era and the days of the Palladium. It was really a tribute record. I never thought in my wildest dreams that the album would take me around the globe twice. It really guided me to where I am today. I am 40-years-old. It took me a long time to get to this mental state of mind. Now, I continue a righteous and awesome path that was carved out by God and, of course, my father.\n\nMabel: Your new album “Got Mambo” has been described as a mixture of the old and new. What was your vision for this album?\n\nTito: My vision for this album is as you just expressed it. If you notice, there are vocalists in the first five songs of the record. The second half of the album has no vocalists. I actually did instrumental songs. That was to show the different sides of Tito Puente Jr. I wanted to ease everybody from what I was doing with “En los Pasos de Mi Padre.” I did include some great hits from that era like “Cua Cua,” as well as original songs like “Charanga Pa’ Nueva York,” my dedication to New York City. It’s where my father and the whole Puente regime were born. The second half of the album goes into some Latin jazz. I got great arrangers like Marlow Rosado, who is my musical director. I told Marlow I wanted to work on arrangements where we could cut into Latin jazz. It was when we returned from touring that I decided I wanted to stay away from the old tunes and do some original material. You know, make my little staple in the music industry. I worked on that Latin jazz vibe. I think my efforts were definitely noticed. I ended up getting great reviews for it. I like that style. I’m following that same direction in the next album, which is coming out next spring. It’ll be great Latin jazz, more original stuff and I’ll probably do one or two remakes.\n\nMabel: How many albums have you released?\n\nTito: Well, professionally I started back in 1992. My first record was all about Latin pop. “Sound of the Latin Rhythm” was the name of it. I did other records with a few different labels, but as far as a complete album, I think this will be my fifth. When it comes to Latin mambo music or salsa, “Got Mambo” will be my second effort. The next album will showcase more of that live performance with timbales. I plan to bring in some great artists for the next record. I’m looking at some really heavy hitters that worked with my father. Hopefully, we can do some great music together.\n\nMabel: You recently had the opportunity to work with some great musicians. It was a project produced by Alex Arias. It was called “La salsa más larga del mundo.” It featured artists such as Eddie Santiago and Rey Ruiz. Talk to me about that project.\n\nTito: That project came from the heart. Alex asked me to participate in something that I hope will go into the Guinness Book of World Records as one of the longest salsa songs. It is about 44 minutes and 35 seconds. It was amazing being around these artists. Every singer on that record worked with my father. It was like seeing my uncles in the studio. I’m happy about working on such a great project. I had the chance to do my timbale solo and showcase Tito Puente Jr. I was in my own comfort zone. I hope it becomes a real success. There’s some historical stuff there.\n\nMabel: Did you ever take a step back and think wow I am collaborating with performers that worked with my father?\n\nTito: Yeah. If you look at the lineup of musicians on most of my albums, you’ll see that I always have one or two musicians that played in the original Tito Puente Orchestra. “En los Pasos de Mi Padre” I brought in the late, great Mario Rivera who worked with my dad for over 35 years. He was an incredible saxophone player who passed away. I have Hansel y Raul, the Kings of charanga music, on my latest album. They played with my father for years as far back as the 1970s. There are also some great musicians, horn players that worked with the Tito Puente Orchestra. I always have that little magic touch. I like to use new guys, but I always love to have a piece of that Tito Puente magic.\n\nMabel: What type of advice did your father give you?\n\nTito: Learn how to read and write music and get into the trenches. I have to quote him on this, “Pay your dues.” Paying your dues means learning and that’s exactly how he did it. He went to the Juilliard School of Music on the G.I. Bill. He got his education first in the military. He learned how to compose and arrange. He then honed in on his craft of playing timbales and becoming an entertainer. I’m glad that he did that. It makes me have more discipline and respect for what he did and accomplished. I encourage our youth or anybody that’s trying to get into the music industry to hone in on your craft and really practice. Get involved with your instrument, whether it be vocals, horns or whatever instrument you like. My father was not a very patient man I got to tell you. He was all about discipline. He didn’t have time to sit with anyone and say learn this or teach anyone about a paradiddle or a seven stroke roll. I was able to go on the road and watch the great master timbale player perform some 250 shows per year. I think those were the best lessons. It influenced how I studied. I mean what better way to learn than from hanging out with a genius. I got the firsthand magic and saw what really drove him.\n\nMabel: Were you formally trained? Did you go to a particular school or just absorb what you were seeing around you?\n\nTito: I did take band classes in junior high and high school. Then, I went to the SUNY schools in upstate New York. I wasn’t really feeling the whole thing. It was the late 80s, early 90s and my father was touring a lot. I felt sitting in a classroom wasn’t really giving me what I needed. I thought traveling with him would be better, but he decided I should take the time and really study. I went to a school called Five Towns College just outside of Seaford, Long Island. It’s a vocational school for music and engineering. I did two semesters there and enjoyed that type of discipline. I had to go and do a gig in order to get credits for a class. That really helped my performance level. I felt myself branch out into Tito Puente Jr.–the entertainer and performer. I knew I had to get to gigs on time. The business side of the industry connected when I went to that school. Afterwards, I traveled with my father for a year. I then decided to work on my craft a bit more and moved out to South Florida in 1992. The music industry was much different. I felt it was time to go where I could start feeling the Latin rhythms. In Florida, I’ve gotten closer to the Cuban sound without going to Cuba. Of course, my dream is to go to Cuba and really learn from the streets.\n\nMabel: Educational outreach was very important to your father. Is that an area that you focus on as well?\n\nTito: Absolutely. As I said before, he was very adamant about me going to school. I try to make sure that the youth have scholarship funds that help up-and-coming musicians who show a lot of skill and talent, especially in percussion. We have a scholarship fund right now at the Hackley School of Music in Tarrytown, New York. There are a few other scholarships in the name of Tito Puente. I encourage our youth to go to school. I can’t say it’s just music education, but education in general. I have a 3-year-old and a 5-year-old. I got up at 5 o’clock this morning and drove them to school. (He giggles and says proudly.) They love it. I know they are little right now and chances are they may not like it as much when they become teenagers. My father taught me that education and discipline are key. He would come home from a gig and tell me to get up and go to school. (He laughs and shortly after imitates his father a bit.) I would say I don’t feel like it. Pop would say, “I’m telling you, you’re going to love it.” You get a lot out of sitting in a classroom and really listening and learning all you can about your instrument. It teaches you discipline and that’s important to becoming a working musician. You need to have that attention span because you are going to have to listen for cues, breaks, of course, the conductor. As a musician, you are going to mess up if you don’t listen. That will hurt your reputation and you won’t get work. That’s the reality.\n\nMabel: Another cause that I know has been important to you is the USO. How did you get involved? Are you still a part of that?\n\nTito: It’s so funny that you are mentioning that because I just back from Germany. I did some USO concerts. I am going back in January to a military base in Frankfurt, Germany. I just worked with Lenny Kravitz. It was amazing.\n\nMabel: Oh, pretty cool.\n\nTito: I’ll be doing my 8th USO tour in January. I’ll then do it again in October. I always support our men and women in the armed forces. They are doing a fabulous job. Everyone thinks USO concerts are just like doing any other concert. It totally isn’t. I go out there totally on my own dime. I do not get paid or receive anything. I usually reroute my trips. I’ll go two days before so that I can visit some troops. I do this whenever I know I’ll be going to a place where there’s a military facility. I try to visit the troops that have been injured in the line of duty and are trying to recover. That’s what I did on my last trip, which was really cool. I met some great soldiers. There were a lot of guys from California, Georgia, Brooklyn, New York and from around the nation. It’s great to give them moral support and show them that we do care as Americans and as Latin Americans. It’s also dear to my heart because my father served in World War II and it was very traumatic for him. I say kudos to our men and women in the armed forces. Hopefully, they will all come home healthy to see their families.\n\nMabel: You have talked about your father and the influence he’s had on you. I’m familiar with a particular collaboration that you did with him early on in your career. You were doing contemporary dance music. I believe the album was entitled “Guarachando.” What was that experience like? Did you work with him on other projects?\n\nTito: Yes. I worked with him on some projects. I actually remember when I started singing with the band a little bit. I kind of snuck my way in. The guys in the band were like yeah, come on up here. My dad said, “What is he doing? He should be backstage setting up my drums.” (He giggles) I was more of a band boy to my pop, but the rest of the band was very encouraging. I did start playing with them. It was really something to see. It was amazing performing with him on my album. Then, I won a billboard that year for best video of the year. That was great. You know, I always looked at my dad as a pop icon. It was funny how I asked him to be a part of it. I said hey dad, you know I would like for you to be on my record and video. Is that possible? He said, “Well, it’s going to cost you.” I was like wow, damn, my dad is going to charge me, but instead he says, “Give me a kiss.” I gave him a kiss on the cheek. Later at the Billboard Awards, he makes a comment in front of a big crowd that my kisses are very expensive. (He laughs a bit.) I thought that was kind of cute. I think deep down my father wanted me to continue his legacy. He did name me Tito Puente Jr. I always wondered why he did it. His real name, of course, was Ernesto Antonio Puente. I remember him saying, “Surround yourself with creative people my son, thus you will be creative.” I have done that for the past 11 years since his passing. I’m happy to say that I feel great about my future. The record industry is different, but live music is resilient. Seeing a live performance gives you the full impact of the music.\n\nMabel: How do you think music has changed since your father’s era?\n\nTito: Well, the industry itself has changed with downloading, CDs and vinyl records phasing out, but I don’t see the fans going away. The fans are growing. There’s a generation who heard Tito Puente when they were little kids. People will tell me they remember my father’s music from back then and it’s become like part of their tradition. My father was an ambassador for Latin music. He took our music as Latin Americans around the world. He took it to places where you would never believe that there would be Latin music like Jakarta, Indonesia, China, Japan, Russia and Berlin. I saw it firsthand this past year, while touring in Australia, Israel and Germany. You wouldn’t think that people in these countries dance salsa and listen to Latin music. They actually love Tito Puente songs and know the lyrics. His music has gone so far. He helped open a lot of doors.\n\nMabel: As a musician, do you ever place much focus on the indigenous roots of Latin music?\n\nTito: I believe that’s something I will always be learning. With that said, I actually got a call the other day that really excited me. A camera crew will be following me when I go to Africa next year.\n\nMabel: Wow!\n\nTito: That’s where you find the essence of indigenous music. The percussion was created there. I can’t wait to go. It’s all going to be filmed for a documentary. My father went to Africa, then Cuba. There he learned the guaguanco rhythms, the djembe rhythms and 6/8 time. I think that’s really where I am going to get my schooling. Kids look at that stuff in textbooks. I get to go and experience it. I’m very excited.\n\nMabel: I read somewhere that you have an interest in developing a film about your father’s life. Is that true?\n\nTito: Yes. That is true. I think his story should be told. I believe it’s way over due. I’m not sure how my family feels about it. I know my mom is very meticulous about what is presented on screen. She’s so smart. (He giggles and proceeds to be amused.) She’s like if they want to talk bad about your father wait until I’m dead. She’s one of those New York thinkers; but yes, I have great interest in doing it. I have writers right now coming up with scripts. I am the buffer between the Tito Puente estate and Hollywood. They want to portray Tito Puente in a good light. I just want everyone to understand that my father was a human being first. I want that to be seen on screen. I think that will show the true essence of Tito Puente and what drove him. The process takes an extremely long time in Hollywood. It’s not like musicians. We go into the studio and do an album in two or three days. It’s a little bit harder with movies and there’s a lot of red tape. I want to get this movie going and be able to show the true genius behind this amazing man.\n\nMabel: I have a question for you that I doubt anyone has ever asked you. What three or four recordings would you share with students if you had the opportunity to teach a master class at Juilliard in New York City? Why would you select those recordings?\n\nTito: Wow. Good question. You’re right. No one has ever asked that. (He giggles.) Well, first I can tell you honestly that I’ll probably never be able to teach a master class at Julliard. (Laughter follows.) There are too many professionals there. I would feel silly. Of course, I would be the court jester over there. (This is a reference to an earlier comment.) My brother happens to go there, which makes it funny. Let’s see, what albums? I would say “Dance Mania.” It was one of the top 100 albums of the century. It’s a dancer’s delight. According to many sources, it’s one of the best dance albums of all time. “Dance Mania” was done in 1957 with RCA Victor by Tito Puente. It has cha-cha-cha, rumba and guaguanco rhythms. There’s also the famous “Ran Kan Kan” song, which was one of my father’s first recordings in 1949. I think that song really showed off his skills on the timbales. There’s a record called “Top Percussion” and another one called “Puente in Percussion.” These are albums that the record company uniquely declined, but he decided to encourage them to put it out. “Top Percussion” sold over 2 million copies. I would encourage you to listen to them if you really want to learn guaguanco and Afro-Cuban rhythms. (Slight pause as he thinks.) Of course, there’s the great “Oye Como Va.” That was one of the top 100 songs of the century.\n\nMabel: That’s definitely a popular one and familiar to many.\n\nTito: I think it’s funny that the Santana version actually came out in 1971, the same year I was born. The original record came out in 1963 and the album was called “El Rey Bravo.” I believe it’s one of the best records in my dad’s repertoire. The song “Oye Como Va” was a cha-cha-cha. The record flopped. I think it sold 2 or 3 thousand copies. So, why would a guitar player from Guadalajara, Mexico move to San Francisco and redo one of Tito Puente’s crappiest songs? It then became a worldwide hit. I would encourage students at Juilliard to ask themselves, why was that? Analyze the song. Sometimes it’s the simplest tune using let’s say, the C7 chord, that can make the greatest hits.\n\nMabel: Well, I want to thank you Tito. Even though you commented that you would be the court jester at Juilliard, I feel like I just took a master workshop there. Early on, you mentioned something I didn’t realize about you and your father and it pertains to your name.\n\nTito: Yeah. His full name was Ernesto Antonio Puente Jr. My grandfather was Ernesto Antonio Puente Sr. Tito is the derivative of something small in the Spanish language like un poquito, which means a little bit. Dad was vertically challenged. (He giggles.) He was only 5–foot–3. He was always the shortest kid on the block. My dad would play stickball on the streets of Spanish Harlem. My grandmother would scream out the window “Ernesito, Ernesito, venga aqui,” come here. She spoke Spanish and had the accent. The kids would then say, “Hey Tito, your mom is calling you.” That was his nickname. (That pleasant giggle is heard again.) That’s where Tito came from. My official name on my New York state license is Tito Anthony Puente. My dad actually named me Tito. My son’s name is Tito Anthony Puente Jr.\n\nMabel: Tito, it’s been a pleasure. Thank you for taking the time to share with me stories about your life and career. I look forward to hearing your next album and finding out about your upcoming performances.\n\nTito: Let’s stay in touch. I’ll definitely let you know when I’m in the area. Thank you for the call.\n\nFor more information on Tito Puente Jr. and his upcoming performances visit: http://www.gotmambo.com"
