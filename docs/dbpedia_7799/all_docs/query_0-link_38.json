        "text": "As Lupe Yoli starts singing, she seems quite restrained. But when the rhythm intensifies, the bad girl of Latin music belts out her Spanish-language cover of My Way in a deep, raspy voice with an almost disturbing sexual abandon. Dressed in a skintight gold lamé catsuit, she clutches her breasts, squeals \"Ay! Aieeyyee!\" in mock pain, grunts and removes her gold stilettoes. Think Eartha Kitt, but camper. Watching this clip of the Afro-Cuban bombshell's \"manic cavorting\" (as the New York Times had it) on the Dick Cavett Show in 1973, it is easy to understand why Pedro Almodóvar used her song Puro Teatro in his film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.\n\n\"La Lupe\" was a cult figure in pre-revolutionary Cuba, a musical legend who pioneered salsa. Her flamboyant stage persona and soulful torch songs brought her international success in the 1960s and 1970s and made her a gay icon in the Latin world. But after a series of tragedies she became a devout Christian, vowed never to perform again and died in poverty and obscurity in her early 50s.\n\nNow, 16 years after her death, a documentary, La Lupe - Queen of Latin Soul, has sparked renewed recognition of her place both in musical history and as a feminist icon. The documentary includes rare footage and interviews with the salsa greats, and, since being shown on television in the US, has been screened in many countries. And it is only one part of a major posthumous comeback for La Lupe. Earlier this year, Fania Records (the salsa equivalent of Motown) released Dance With the Queen, an album of club remixes of her songs, and this summer saw publication of a novel, The Island of Eternal Love, featuring a character based on her.\n\nThe director of the documentary is a Cuban-born New Yorker, Ela Troyano, who feels that the singer was \"an amazing artist who has never been given her due because she was black and because her lyrics and her stance were very working class\". Troyano's fascination with La Lupe began in New York in 1987 when she spotted a poster advertising an audience with the fallen star. She went along to a hall on the Lower East Side expecting to find a drag-queen impersonator; instead she found the legend herself sitting at the altar of a community church in front of 200 smartly dressed Latinos. This audience was listening to the story of La Lupe's supposedly lifelong spiritual quest, and it turned out that she was doing the rounds of Latino churches, relating her experiences and selling tapes of her music - with the more risque lyrics toned down. Troyano remembers being mesmerised but also wondering \"if she was hustling, somehow lying to herself\". The audio recording of that encounter became the germ of her film.\n\nLa Lupe was born Guadalupe Victoria Yoli Raymond in December 1936 in the working-class barrío of San Pedrito, Santiago de Cuba. From an early age she showed a natural musical talent and, influenced by the performances of Cuban bolero singer Olga Guillot, declared that she wanted to be a performer. Her disciplinarian father insisted that she train as a teacher, and, having done so, she married the musician Eulogio \"Yoyo\" Reyes and they formed the Tropicuba Trio.\n\nNorma, La Lupe's sister, says that the singer fell passionately in love with Reyes, but that the relationship proved tempestuous - Reyes had an affair with the other singer in the trio, Tina, which led to the breakup of both the marriage and the group in 1960. By this time La Lupe had a son with Reyes, although Norma says in the film that she believes her sister miscarried twice as a result of Reyes' beatings.\n\nThe divorce devastated La Lupe, but determined to prove she could make it alone, she began performing solo in a small nightclub, La Red. It was here, in the hothouse era of the Cuban revolution, that she forged her style and developed a countercultural following. Her pianist, Homero Balboa, describes the crowd as \"hippies and existentialists - people who wore their shirts backwards, that was her audience\".\n\nShe wore heavy makeup and revealing clothes more conventionally associated with putas (prostitutes). She would laugh wildly, cry, swear at the audience, bite and scratch herself, hit Balboa with her shoes, lift her skirts, sit on people in the audience and moan and groan orgasmically. The academic Vanessa Knights writes that she was \"the most outrageous female performer in Cuba at that time, breaking with social norms of decorum and passivity for women in her explosively dynamic performances\". But while her radical, aggressive style was well-suited to the edgy La Red, it didn't suit the mainstream culture of Castro's new Cuba. In 1962 she left for New York.\n\nLa Lupe's big break in the US came when the king of Latin music, Tito Puente, invited her to sing with his orchestra. This led to huge commercial and critical success and she went on to record 23 albums in the next 20 years. Puente had been playing traditional Cuban rhythms, but La Lupe adapted his big band sound so it was more like the funkier, brasher music of the barrío latino, and had the rhythms that would become known as salsa. Her performances were impossible to ignore, and in 1964 Susan Sontag cited La Lupe as one of the 17 entries that defined \"camp\" in her landmark essay, Notes on Camp.\n\nBut Puente began to feel threatened by his singer's notoriety, and he fired her in 1968, complaining of her lack of discipline. Shortly afterwards, he hired two drag queens to \"do Lupe\" in her stead. She fought back in style, writing a song about his betrayal (in La Dueña del Cantar she demands to be recognised as a central figure in the development of salsa) and in 1969 she sold out Carnegie Hall. But, as the salsa brand established itself through Fania Records, La Lupe was sidelined. Puente teamed up with another, much more demure Cuban singer, Celia Cruz, who became the official face of salsa.\n\nTroyano believes La Lupe's public identification as a Santeros (a follower of the African-Caribbean religious tradition Santeria) contributed to the way she was abandoned. \"Santeria was seen as 'ghetto',\" explains Troyano, \"so most Latin musicians at that time didn't identify with it publicly - for instance, Celia Cruz would never say that she was a Santero [despite recording songs to the orishas or saints].\"\n\nIn a 1971 interview with Look magazine, La Lupe said: \"I think people like me because I do what they like to, but can't get free enough to do.\" Sadly that year was to be a low point, from which she never fully recovered. Her second husband, Willy García, was diagnosed with schizophrenia and she was fired from the Broadway production of The Two Gentlemen of Verona. However, after a successful tour of Venezuela she returned to New York and recorded two of her most famous and heart-wrenching boleros, La Tirana (The Tyrant), a woman's feisty defence against a demonising ex, and Puro Teatro (Pure Theatre), in which the singer denounces a deceitful lover.\n\nLittle is known of La Lupe's life between an electrifying performance at Madison Square Garden in 1977 and her admission to hospital with two broken vertebrae in 1986, where she met an evangelist. She later became an ordained Pentecostal minister and preacher in the South Bronx, and it was here that she died of a heart attack on February 28 1992.\n\nToday, there is a street in the Bronx named after La Lupe, as well as a gay bar in Madrid. Troyano is developing a feature film based on her story and a new generation is discovering her music. Sofia Buchuk, a Peruvian singer and musicologist, has become a fan since seeing Troyano's film. She likens La Lupe to Frida Kahlo. \"A very intelligent woman and a pure artist who transcended a folk tradition, enjoyed her body and expressed herself freely\""
