        "text": "Ernest Anthony Puente Jr., commonly known as Tito Puente, was an American musician, songwriter, bandleader, timbalero, and record producer. He composed dance-oriented mambo and Latin jazz music. Puente and his music have appeared in films including The Mambo Kings and Fernando Trueba’s Calle 54.\n\nBorn: April 20, 1923, Harlem, New York, NY\n\nDied: June 1, 2000 (age 77 years), New York, NY\n\nEvery day on KUVO is Jazz Appreciation Day, but since 2001, the Smithsonian Institution (aka the National Museum of American History) has coordinated events, recognition, and resources to recognize and celebrate the extraordinary heritage and history of jazz throughout April. At KUVO, we use Jazz Appreciation Month (JAM) to dig a little deeper and present why this music is so amazing and so important.\n\nThroughout the month, KUVO will spotlight many of the jazz birthdays in April, and we’ll finish the month with deep dives into some of the cities and regions that have spawned so much music (NYC, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Chicago, Latin America, Washington D.C. and Baltimore, the Midwest, including Kansas City, Memphis and Dallas, and the West Coast. We’ll also highlight music in the KUVO library from the many great jazz festivals around the world. On April 30, we’ll celebrate International Jazz Day with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and UNESCO Ambassador for Intercultural Dialogue Herbie Hancock.\n\nOur sister station on the TV side Rocky Mountain PBS has a great lineup of TV specials, documentaries, and features to entertain and enlighten. See the list here: RMPBS Jazz Appreciation Month Lineup\n\nThe Smithsonian Jazz project’s Education page is a motherlode of jazz training content, including text and commentary on figures like Benny Carter and Duke Ellington, and an 88-page curriculum on the impact of Louis Armstrong. It’s got full music tracks of classic, modern, and contemporary jazz designed to capture the attention of elementary and middle school students. There’s even an oral history tutorial for teachers and students. American History /Smithsonian Jazz Education\n\nAlso, the Smithsonian Jazz project has loads of ideas to help you celebrate, with specific individual strategies for parents, historians, collectors, and more. Organizations like museums, foundations, libraries, worship centers, and jazz societies will find unique ways to celebrate JAM at the Smithsonian Jazz Hub.
