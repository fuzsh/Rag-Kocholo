        "text": "Ernesto Antonio Puente, Jr., was born on April 20, 1923, in New York, New York. His parents were from Puerto Rico. He grew up in New York City’s Spanish Harlem neighborhood. Puente dropped out of school at the age of 16 to become a full-time musician. About this time, music from Puerto Rico and Cuba began to merge and could be heard in dance halls all over New York City. Puente began to play this music in various bands. In 1942 Puente was drafted to serve in the navy during World War II (1939–45). After the war he attended the Juilliard School of Music (now the Juilliard School) where he studied various subjects.\n\nIn 1949 Puente formed the Tito Puente Orchestra The orchestra had its first performance on July 4, 1949, in Atlantic Beach, New Jersey. By the end of the year the orchestra included four trumpets, three trombones, and four saxophones, as well as a number of vocalists and percussionists. In the following decade Puente, along with other Latin musicians, helped to give rise to the golden age of mambo, a popular Cuban dance.\n\nOver the course of his career, Puente continued to orchestrate and write songs that drew from other Latin American music, such as Brazilian bossa nova and Cuban cha-cha. At one point Latin American dance music styles began to be grouped under the term salsa. Puente did not approve of the term, as salsa means “sauce” and has nothing to do with music. However, the term eventually became widely used to describe the kind of music Puente played.\n\nPuente also wrote many songs. His most popular songs included “Barbarabatiri”, “Ran Kan Kan”, and “Oye Como Va”. Puente recorded some 120 albums and kept a busy performance schedule. He also performed in several films, including Radio Days (1987) and The Mambo Kings (1992). He was responsible for introducing American audiences to a number of Latin musicians, notably Cuban singer Celia Cruz. Puente received five Grammy Awards as well as many other honors. He continued to play 200 to 300 engagements a year until shortly before his death. Puente died on May 31, 2000, in New York City."
