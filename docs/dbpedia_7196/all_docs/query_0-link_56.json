        "text": "Oscars night has come and gone, and now that all the red carpet looks have been served and the Academy Awards have been handed out, only one question remains: Where can I watch all those Oscar-winning films?? Thankfully, we've got the answers.\n\nThe beauty of living in the streaming era is that you can watch this year's Oscar winners on Netflix, Hulu, AppleTV+, , and other popular streaming platforms if you didn't catch them in theaters (some are still showing, btw!). Below, you'll find a full rundown of where to watch 2024 Oscar winners. But don't worry movie buffs, we've also got the deets on where to stream 2024 Oscar nominees that were robbed—*cough* Killers of the Flower Moon *cough*—too.\n\nAll snubs aside, the feature films, documentaries, and shorts that took home this year's Little Gold Men are definitely worth adding to your watchlist. So grab your Stanley cup, your snacks, and potentially, your Fandango tix because it's movie time!\n\nOppenheimer\n\nChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer took home the most Oscar wins this year, which shouldn't come as a huge surprise, seeing as it was nominated for 13 awards. It stars Cillian Murphy, who won Best Actor, as the titular J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Robert Downey Jr., who won Best Supporting Actor. Prepare to be wowed by the Oscar-winning Ludwig Göransson score, too.\n\nWhere to Stream: You can watch Oppenheimer on Peacock and AppleTV+ or rent or buy it on .\n\nWon: Best Picture; Best Actor (Cillian Murphy); Best Director (Christopher Nolan); Best Supporting Actor (Robert Downey Jr.); Best Cinematography (Hoyte van Hoytema); Film Editing (Jennifer Lame); Original Score (Ludwig Göransson)\n\nPoor Things\n\nPoor Things took home an armful of Academy Awards, including Emma Stone's Best Actress win for her portrayal of Bella Baxter. Adapted from a 1992 , the movie tells the story of Bella Baxter, an adventurous young woman brought back to life by an unorthodox scientist. Its whimsical costumes and prosthetic makeup also snatched awards.\n\nWhere to Stream: You can watch Poor Things on Hulu or buy it (with bonus content) on . Poor Things is also still playing in select theaters, so check Fandango for showtimes and tickets.\n\nWon: Best Actress in a Leading Role (Emma Stone); Costume Design (Holly Waddington); Makeup and Hairstyling (Nadia Stacey, Mark Coulier and Josh Weston); Production Design (James Price, Shona Heath and Zsuzsa Mihalek)\n\nBarbie\n\nThough Ryan Gosling's \"I'm Just Ken\" performance will go down in Oscars history, it was a fellow Barbie hit, Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For, that took home Best Song.\n\nWhere to Stream: You can watch Barbie on Max and AppleTV+ or rent or buy it on .\n\nWon: Best Original Song (What Was I Made For?, Music and Lyric by Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell)\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nThe Holdovers might've only won one award at the 2024 Oscars, but it's still well worth a watch. The film follows a grouchy but loveable teacher at a New England prep school (played by Paul Giamatti) tasked with babysitting misfit students who have nowhere to go over Christmas break—and it'll pull at your heartstrings just as much as Da'Vine Joy Randolph did during her acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nWhere to Stream: You can watch The Holdovers on Peacock.\n\nWon: Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Da’Vine Joy Randolph)\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nBased on the 2001 novel , American Fiction follows a frustrated writer/professor (played by Jeffrey Wright) who writes a Black book to prove a point about outdated tropes and offensive stereotypes used in Black entertainment. Both the bestselling book and the Oscar-winning movie will leave you questioning why our current culture has such an obsession with stereotypes.\n\nWhere to Stream: You can rent or buy , YouTube and AppleTV+. The film is still playing in a handful of theaters, so check Fandango for showtimes and tickets.\n\nWon: Best Adapted Screenplay (Cord Jefferson)\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nThe French-language film Anatomy of a Fall follows a woman suspected of her husband's murder—and her blind son who's the sole witness to his fatal fall. Turn the subtitles on and strap in for a complex character study that goes far beyond your average courtroom drama.\n\nWhere to Stream: You can watch Anatomy of a Fall on AppleTV+ or rent or buy it on —and it will begin streaming on Hulu on March 22. It's still showing in select movie theaters, so check Fandango for showtimes and tickets.\n\nWon: Best Original Screenplay (Justine Triet and Arthur Harari)\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nInspired by the 2014 , the UK's International Feature Film submission, The Zone of Interest, follows the commander of Auschwitz and his wife as they attempt to create their dream life directly next to the Nazi concentration camp. FYI: The film is in German, so you'll probs need subtitles.\n\nWhere to Stream: You can purchase . The film is also playing in select theaters, so check Fandango for showtimes and tickets.\n\nWon: Best International Feature Film; Sound (Tarn Willers and Johnnie Burn)\n\nThe Boy and the Heron\n\nThe Boy and the Heron is rumored to be the last movie from director Hayao Miyazaki (who's already won Oscars for classics like Spirited Away, The Wind Rises, and Howl’s Moving Castle), so it's a must-see for any Studio Ghibli fan—especially now that it's an Oscar winner.\n\nWhere to Stream: You can watch The Boy and the Heron on AppleTV+. It's also playing in select theaters, so check Fandango for showings near you.\n\nWon: Best Animated Feature Film (Hayao Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki)\n\n20 Days in Mariupol\n\nIf you thought Mstyslav Chernov's acceptance speech was moving, just wait until you watch the Pulitzer Prize-winning—and now Oscar-winning—Ukrainian journalist's first documentary feature film. 20 Days in Mariupol melds Chernov’s daily news dispatches and personal footage together into a vivid account of what it's like to report from the middle of a war zone. Though the subject matter is heavy, it's an important Oscar winner to watch.\n\nWhere to Stream: You can .\n\nWon: Best Documentary Feature Film (Mstyslav Chernov, Michelle Mizner and Raney Aronson-Rath)\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nGodzilla Minus One's Oscar win shows just how far special effects have come since the first Godzilla movie premiered seventy years ago. And how cute was the squad that accepted the award (and those tiny Godzillas they brought on stage with them)?!\n\nWhere to Stream: Godzilla Minus One is not yet available for streaming, so you'll need to keep an eye out on Fandango for potential showings near you.\n\nWon: Visual Effects (Takashi Yamazaki, Kiyoko Shibuya, Masaki Takahashi and Tatsuji Nojima)\n\nThe Last Repair Shop\n\nIf you thought 12-year-old Porshe Brinke was adorable on-stage at the Oscars, just wait until you see her and the other musicians in the Oscar-winning documentary short, The Last Repair Shop.
