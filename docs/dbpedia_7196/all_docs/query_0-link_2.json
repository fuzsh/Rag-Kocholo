        "text": "Academy Award for best actor, award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, located in Beverly Hills, California. It honours the male actor in a leading role who delivered the most outstanding performance in a movie of a given year, as determined by the academy’s voting members. The prize was presented in 1929 at the first Academy Awards ceremony, and it recognized work in films from 1927–28. It was not until the seventh ceremony, in 1935, that only performances in movies released the previous year were eligible for consideration. The winning actors are given a gold-plated statuette known as an Oscar. Daniel Day-Lewis has won the most Academy Awards for best actor (three), and a number of actors have received two such Oscars, including Spencer Tracy and Tom Hanks, both of whom won in consecutive years. Below is a list of the winning actors and the films for which they won. The year is when the award was presented."
