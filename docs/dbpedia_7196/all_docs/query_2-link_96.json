        "text": "In 2016, inspired by the #OscarsSoWhite conversation and other conversations about racial diversity at the Oscars that started around it, I volunteered to write a post listing all the white actors who had been nominated for Oscars for playing people of color. As I did the research for that post, however, a few other things came up that I wanted to look into, and thus this project quickly evolved into something more.\n\nFirstly, I wanted to add milestones to the timeline about when actual people of color were nominated for Oscars, but what I was learning in order to pinpoint these milestones was so interesting that I started looking further. Before long, I‚Äôd created an extensive spreadsheet situation holding a wealth of data I‚Äôve only just begun to analyze.\n\nSecondly, throughout my research I grew increasingly interested in other ways white people have acquired Oscars on the backs of people of color or otherwise refused to cede the floor, like through white savior narratives. I noticed alarming patterns like the Academy‚Äôs habit of nominating films with majority-Asian casts for Best Picture and not a single acting nomination.\n\nNow, it has become an annual ritual to assess and update this post after each subsequent Oscars ceremony. Let‚Äôs get into it.\n\nThis post was most recently updated in March 2023.\n\nEast, Southeast and South Asian Actors\n\n2023 was a huge year for Asian actors ‚Äî Everything Everywhere All At Once earned more acting nominations and wins than any previous film with a majority-Asian cast and became the first to win multiple Acting Awards as well as Best Picture. Also, Hong Chau was nominated for her role in The Whale. Previously, biggest gains in this category happened in 2021, when Youn Yuh-jung and Steven Yeun were both nominated for Minari, and Youn won, making her the first Korean actor to win an Academy Award.\n\nPatterns throughout history: many of the actors are white-passing and/or play white roles, a lot of Ben Kingsley, and a lot of movies about war. I also found a troubling trend in Best Picture nominees: films with majority-Asian casts that were nominated for Best Picture failed to garner any acting nominations. This happened again in 2020 when Parasite was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best International Feature Film, Best Production Design and Best Editing ‚Äî without a single solitary nomination for Acting. There have been major snubs in recent years, includingThe Handmaiden, Crazy Rich Asians,The Farewell, Coming Home, Burning, The Grandmaster, Court, The Big Sick, Downsizing, A Taxi Driver and Decision to Leave.\n\nLatinx and Latin American Actors\n\nThere were no stand-out patterns amongst performances that garnered nominations for Latinx actors, aside from the fact that a lot of them were playing white/anglo characters. Four nominations come from Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu movies. The only updates required for this infographic since 2016 were to account for two actresses nominated for Roma, Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira; and for Ariana DeBose‚Äôs 2022 win for West Side Story (which made her the first openly queer woman of color to be nominated for an Academy Award for acting.) Aparicio, who is of Mixtec and Trique descent, is also the first Indigenous American woman to receive a nomination for Best Actress. Snubs in recent years include actors in Knives Out, Hustlers and Beatriz at Dinner.\n\nBlack Actors\n\nQuite a few Black actors and actresses have been nominated for Academy Awards, but it‚Äôs still pretty paltry, especially when so many films featuring black actors are snubbed year after year. As discussed in What Does The Academy Value in a Black Performance?, there are certain themes that emerge when looking at what the films earning nominations were about: celebrities (e.g., Ray Charles, Muhammad Ali, Tina Turner, Billie Holiday, Ma Rainey), criminal behavior and incarceration, slavery, black people working for or taking care of white people and narratives centered on white saviors and/or white sidekicks. Also, a lot of Martin Ritt and Stanley Kramer movies.\n\nThis was the area that required the most updates from 2016 to 2023 ‚Äî 25 Black actors were nominated for Academy Awards in the last six years, and several won. Films written and directed by Black people like Mudbound, Judas and the Black Messiah, Get Out, Black Panther, Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk, Ma Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom, One Night in Miami and BlacKkKlansman received nominations in various categories. Still, major snubs abounded in the 2020s: Lupita Nyong‚Äôo for Us, Eddie Murphy for Dolemite is My Name, Jennifer Hudson for Respect, Viola Davis for The Woman King and Danielle Deadwyler for Till, among others. In 2023, Jordan Peele‚Äôs Nope was shut out altogether and at the ceremony, Angela Bassett was amongst three women of color passed over for the Supporting Actress win.\n\nThe Lead Actress category continues to offer Black women nominations but never a win.\n\nNorth African and Middle Eastern Actors\n\nNorth African and Middle Eastern Acting Nominees are few and far between. There are four who have been nominated (included in the timeline below): Omar Sharif in 1962 and Shohreh Aghdashloo in 2003. In 2019, Rami Malek became the first actor of Egyptian heritage to win an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Bohemian Rhapsody. In the 2021 ceremony, British-Pakistani actor Riz Ahmed was nominated for Best Actor for Sound of Metal. The lack of representation in this area is especially egregious considering the accolades heaped upon multiple all-white editions of Cleopatra and the fact that a lot of Academy Award winning films are set in the Middle East. (Here‚Äôs a great article about typecasting of Muslim-American actors specifically: You May Know Me From Such Roles as Terrorist #4.)\n\nNative American / Indigenous / First Nation Actors\n\nOnly four Native American / Indigenous / First Nation actors have been nominated for Academy Awards, which is particularly shameful when you consider Hollywood‚Äôs rich legacy of redface and the number of films about Native Americans that have garnered awards for white people, such as Dances With Wolves, The Lone Ranger, The Last of the Mohicans, Broken Arrow, Pocahontas, The Revenant and Stagecoach. In 2019, Yalitza Aparicio became the first Indigenous and second Mexican woman nominated for a Best Actress award.\n\nActress Keisha Castle-Hughes is the only Pacific Islander nominated for an Academy Award I could find ‚Äî for the really kickass movie Whale Rider.\n\nSome sources count Russell Crowe, nominated for Gladiator, because he has a MƒÅori great grandmother.\n\nRacism at the Academy Awards: A Timeline\n\nNow, let‚Äôs get into the timeline, which I hope will give a good overview of how the Academy has handled race and how white people are often more celebrated for stories about people of color than the people of color themselves. Feel free to add more conversation in the comments!\n\n1928\n\nWhite actor Warner Baxter wins Best Actor for his portrayal of Mexican character The Cisco Kid in In Old Arizona.\n\n1930\n\nWhite actor George Arliss wins Best Actor for playing South Asian character The Raja in The Green Goddess.\n\n1932\n\nShanghai Express, nominated for Best Picture, features Marlene Dietrich as a courtesan named Shanghai Lily and Swedish actor Warner Oland playing an ostensibly East Asian character Henry Chang. Oland, who was Swedish, had great success playing Asian characters throughout his career, including 16 films in which he played Chinese detective ‚ÄúCharlie Chan.‚Äù Chinese-American actress Anna Mae Wong played Hui Fei, one of her few leading roles. Despite taking place in China, very few Chinese actors appeared in the film.\n\n1934\n\nCleopatra, an Egyptian queen of North African and Greek heritage, is pretty much always played by white actresses, like Claudette Colbert did in this version. It was nominated for Best Picture.\n\nAlso in 1934, The Hays Code, which strongly recommended against onscreen depictions of relationships between white people and black people, went into effect and lasted into the ‚Äô50s.\n\n1935\n\nFirst Asian-American Nominated For an Academy Award for Acting: Merle Oberon becomes the first Asian actor nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Kitty Vane in The Dark Angel. She is also the first Asian actress nominated for Best Lead Actress. However, Oberon claimed to be white throughout her career and passed as white. Merle was born in Bombay and raised by a part-Sinhalese and possibly part-Maori mother. The intricacies of Merle‚Äôs background and family situation are reported differently by every source I have consulted, and much of it remains muddled, although all agree that Merle‚Äôs actual mother was the woman she believed to be her half-sister, who had birthed Merle following a sexual assault at the age of 12.\n\nOberon didn‚Äôt reveal her Indian heritage until 1978, a year before her death.\n\n1936\n\nRussian-born Armenian actor Akim Tamiroff is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Chinese warlord General Yang in The General Died at Dawn. According to Wikipedia, ‚Äúmakeup artist Charles Gemora applied sponge rubber eyelids for one of the actors.‚Äù\n\n1937\n\nWhite actress Louise Rainer wins Best Actress for playing Chinese servant O-Lan in the film adaptation of Pearl S. Buck‚Äôs novel The Good Earth. The Good Earth was also nominated for Best Picture. Every main character in the cast was played by a white actor in heavy prosthetics and makeup.\n\nWhite actor H.B Warner is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Chinese character Chang in Lost Horizon.\n\n1939\n\nFirst Black Actor and First Black Woman to be Nominated for or to Win an Academy Award for Acting, First Person of Color to Win An Academy Award For Acting: Black Actress Hattie McDaniel becomes the first black actor to be nominated for and to win an acting Academy Award for playing Mammy, the house slave of Scarlett O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs family, in Gone With The Wind. She and her escort were made to sit at a segregated table for two in the back at the Ambassador Hotel during the Oscars ceremony and she was prohibited from entering the after-party attended by her cast mates.\n\nIt would be 50 years before another Black woman would win an Academy Award for Acting.\n\n1943\n\nTwo white actors, Armenian actor Akim Tamiroff and Greek actress Katina Paxinou, both get Supporting Actor/Actress nominations for playing Pablo and Pilar in For Whom The Bell Tolls. The characters were of Spanish descent and therefore not necessarily dark-skinned, but the filmmakers went all-out with the bronzer regardless.\n\n1944\n\nWhite actress Aline MacMahon gets a Best Supporting Actress Nomination for playing Chinese character ‚ÄúLing Tan‚Äôs Wife‚Äù in Dragon Seed. Her daughter was played by Katherine Hepburn in one of the most egregious examples of yellowface ever.\n\n1946\n\nWhite actress Jennifer Jones is a Best Actress Nominee for playing Mestiza character Pearl Chavez in Duel in the Sun.\n\n1946\n\nWhite actress Gale Sondergaard is nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Siamese character Lady Thiang in Anna and the King of Siam. White actors Rex Harrison and Linda Darnell also played Siamese characters in the film. (Siam is now known as Thailand.)\n\n1947\n\nFirst Hispanic Person Nominated For an Academy Award for Acting: Thomas Gomez is nominated as Best Supporting Actor for playing Pancho in Ride the Pink Horse. The white lead character befriends Pancho and is rewarded with Pancho‚Äôs loyalty and devotion. White actress Wanda Hendrix played Mexican-American character Pila.\n\n1949\n\nWhite actress Jeanne Crain is nominated for a Best Actress for playing half African-American woman Pinky Johnson in Pinky. In the film, the grandmother who raised Pinky, an illiterate black laundress, is played by Ethel Waters, who was also nominated for an Academy Award. Black actresses Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge were interested in the role of Pinky, but were turned down in favor of Jeanne Crain. A fight over the censorship of this film by racist assholes in Texas went all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n1950\n\nWhite actor Jeff Chandler is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Chiricahua Apache chief Cochise inBroken Arrow. White actress Debra Paget also played a Native American role in the film. Canadian First Nations actor Jay Silverheels was cast as Geronimo. Silverheels later went on to an iconic television role as Tonto, the faithful companion to The Lone Ranger.\n\nFirst Latino Person To Win An Academy Award for Acting: Jos√© Ferrer became the first Puerto Rican nominated for Best Supporting Actor when he got a nod in 1948 for playing the King of France in Joan of Arc, but he makes history again in 1950 when he wins Best Actor for playing another French character, Cyrano de Bergerac. He‚Äôd later be nominated for playing the French poet Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in Moulin Rogue. He was the first Latino actor to be nominated more than once for an Academy Award.\n\n1952\n\nMarlon Brando is nominated for Best Actor for his role as Mexican Revolutionary Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata! A blog I stumbled across while looking for images managed to encapsulate everything wrong with this type of casting when they wrote, ‚ÄúThe black and white cinematography (and that glorious mustache) help make [Brando] look more like a Mexican, but it‚Äôs his acting deserves the credit for making his performance so believable. It‚Äôs not just that he is convincing in the role, he was even nominated for Best Actor, meaning that his performance as a Mexican was one of the best of the year.‚Äù\n\nFirst Mexican Person To Win an Academy Award for Acting, First Latino Person To Win For Playing a Latino Character: Mexican-Irish actor Anthony Quinn was a three-time Oscar nominee; in 1957 for Wild Is the Wind (he played an Italian character), in 1964 for Zorba the Greek (he played a Greek character) and ‚Äî the time he won ‚Äî for ‚ÄúViva Zapata! in 1952. This would be the first time a Latino actor would win an Academy Award for playing a Latino character. Most of the film‚Äôs other main characters were played by white actors ‚Äî in fact, Pancho Villa was played by the same guy who voices Fred Flintstone.\n\n1954\n\nFirst Mexican Woman To Be Nominated For An Academy Award for Acting: Mexican-American actress Katy Jurado was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for playing American Indian character Se√±ora Devereaux in Broken Lace, the Comanche wife of Spencer Tracy‚Äôs character, Matt Devereaux. Her character is called ‚ÄúSe√±ora‚Äù because, as her son tells his girlfriend, ‚Äúpeople in town like to pretend she‚Äôs Spanish, figure it looks better.‚Äù The film is mostly centered on how racism against American Indians impacts her half-white son and white husband.\n\nFirst Black Person Nominated For Lead Actress: Dorothy Dandridge is nominated for her role as Carmen Jones in Carmen Jones.\n\n1955\n\nWhite actress Jennifer Jones is nominated for Best Actress for playing Chinese doctor Dr. Han Suyin in Love is a Many Splendored Thing.\n\n1956\n\nThe Ten Commandments, a film based on a Biblical story where characters of Middle Eastern descent were played by white actors, wins Best Picture.\n\nAlso in 1956, the legendary Russian actor Yul Brynnr earns a Best Actor Academy Award for playing King Mongkut of Siam (Siam is now known as Thailand) in The King and I, a role he played on Broadway and on screen and was very well known for.\n\nBrynner also portrayed Egyptian character Rameses II in The Ten Commandments.\n\nBut here‚Äôs a twist: Brynner claimed to be of part-Mongol parentage, but this probably wasn‚Äôt altogether true. Sources are conflicting on this matter, but it‚Äôs pretty intriguing, as Brynnr is one of only two actors listed on Wikipedia as an Asian Best Lead Actor nominee. (The other is Ben Kingsley, who is half-Indian.)\n\nSometimes Brynner said he was half-Japanese and half-Swiss. He consistently claimed that he was born ‚ÄúTaidje Khan‚Äù on a Russian island, which wasn‚Äôt true. In truth, he was born in the Far Eastern Republic of Russia, moved to China when he was 6, and Paris shortly thereafter. His father was Swiss/German/Russian and his mother was Russian. His paternal grandmother was said to maybe be of part Mongolian/Buryat ancestry.\n\n1957\n\nFirst Openly Asian-American Woman To Win An Academy Award for Acting, First Japanese-American Woman Nominated for an Academy Award for Acting: Japanese-American actress Miyoshi Umeki wns Best Actress for playing Katsumi, the wife of an American Airman, in Sayonara. The movie‚Äôs plot centered around two white soldiers who fell in love with Japanese women and are ostracized because of it it.\n\nFirst Japanese-American man nominated for an Academy Award for Acting: Sessue Hayakawa, considered ‚Äúthe first Asian-American leading man,‚Äù is nominated for his role as Colonel Saito in The Bridge on the River Kwai.\n\n1958\n\nFirst Black man nominated for an Academy Award for Acting: Sidney Poitier receives his first of three nominations for playing Noah Cullen, a black prisoner shackled to a white prisoner (played by Tony Curtis). The two escape prison when a truck crashes in The Defiant Ones and are forced to overcome their differences and work together to survive.\n\n1959\n\nWhite actor Hugh Griffith wins Best Supporting Actor for playing Middle Eastern character Sheik Ilderim in Ben-Hur. Ben-Hur also wins Best Picture.\n\nSusan Kohner, a Czech-Mexican actress, is nominated for Best Supporting Actress for playing a white-passing African-American woman in the wildly successful film Imitation of Life. Black actressJuanita Moore is nominated for Best Supporting Actress for playing the single mother Sarah Jane rejects in order to pass as white.\n\n1961\n\nWhite actor George Chakiris wins Best Supporting Actor for playing Puerto Rican gang member Bernardo Nu√±ez in West Side Story. Natalie Wood, a white actress, plays the Puerto Rican female lead in West Side Story, which also won Best Picture.\n\nFirst Puerto Rican and first Latina Woman to Win an Academy Award for Acting for playing a Latina character: Rita Moreno wins Best Supporting Actress for playing Anita in West Side Story.\n\n1962\n\nWhite actor Alec Guinness gets a Best Actor Nomination for playing the Middle Eastern Prince Faisal in Lawrence of Arabia. Lawrence of Arabia also wins Best Picture.\n\nOmar Sharif becomes the first Egyptian and the first North African actor nominated for an Oscar with a Best Supporting Actor nod for Lawrence of Arabia.\n\n1963\n\nWhite actress Patricia Neal wins Best Actress for playing Alma in Hud. In the original novel, Alma‚Äôs character was a black housekeeper named ‚ÄúHalema,‚Äù but the director changed the character to be white because they didn‚Äôt think the film would sell with a Black actress at the helm.\n\nAnother whitewashed remake of Cleopatra, this one starring Liz Taylor, wins Best Picture in 1963.\n\nSidney Poitier becomes the first black actor to win a Lead Acting Oscar for his performance in Lilies in the Field, where he plays a handyman who helps a bunch of nuns build a church.\n\n1965\n\nWhite actor Laurence Olivier is nominated for Best Actor for playing Othello in Othello. Othello was described as ‚ÄúMoorish,‚Äù a term used at the time of the play‚Äôs writing to describe a wide array of darker-skinned people. This is just ridiculous:\n\n1967\n\nBlack actress Beah Richards is nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for playing Mrs. Prentice in Guess Who‚Äôs Coming To Dinner, the mother of a black doctor played by Sidney Poitier whose white fianc√©‚Äôs parents are not excited about the possibility of their daughter marrying a black person.\n\n1970\n\nFirst Native American Nominated for an Academy Award for Acting: Chief Dan George becomes the first Native American nominated for an Academy Award when he‚Äôs up for Best Supporting Actor for playing Old Lodge Skins in Little Big Man. Little Big Man is the story of Jack, a white boy raised by the compassionate Old Lodge Skins in his Cheyenne village after Jack‚Äôs parents are massacred by Pawnees. Prior to giving the role to George, it was offered to Marlon Brando, Paul Scofield and Laurence Olivier. All the extras were played by American Indians, however.\n\n1971\n\nCherokee/Irish actor Ben Johnson wins Best Supporting Actor for playing a white pool hall owner in The Last Picture Show.\n\n1972\n\nMarlon Brando boycotts the Academy Awards ceremony to protest the treatment of Native Americans by the film industry, and sends Apache-Yaqui-Pueblo-French-German-Dutch actress and activist Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his award for Best Actor for The Godfather. Brando had written a 15-page speech inspired by the Wounded Knee Siege but the producer only gives Littlefeather 60 seconds, so she improvises and reads the rest backstage. The Academy forbids proxy acceptance going forward. This remains the only time a Native American woman has given an Oscar acceptance speech, although technically the Oscar was declined.\n\nFirst film with African-American nominees for Best Actress and Best Actor: Black actor Paul Wildfield is nominated for Best Actor and Cicely Tyson for Best Actress for Sounder, about a sharecropping family in Louisiana whose father is sent to prison camp for a petty crime. It was well-reviewed, and according to Wikipedia ‚Äúwas praised as a welcome antidote to the contemporaneous wave of black films, most of which were considered low quality, low budget and exploitative. The film‚Äôs depiction of a loving family was hailed as a banner accomplishment for black filmmakers and audiences.‚Äù\n\nDiana Ross is nominated for Best Actress for playing Billie Holiday in Lady Sings the Blues. This was the first time more than one black actress was nominated for Best Actress in the same year.\n\nThey lost to Liza Minelli for Cabaret.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1980, no actors of color are nominated for Oscars.\n\n1981\n\nIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is nominated for Best Picture. It includes a Welsh actor, John Rhys-Davies, playing an Arab-Egyptian character named Sallah Mohammed Faisel el-Kahir.\n\n1982\n\nLinda Hunt wins Best Supporting Actress for playing an Chinese-Australian person with dwarfism named Billy Kwan in The Year of Living Dangerously. Yup.\n\nBen Kingsley wins a Best Actor statue for starring in Gandhi, which also wins Best Picture. In doing so, he becomes the first East, Southeast or South Asian actor to win an Academy Award for Lead Actor. Kingsley‚Äôs mother is British and his father is Indian, and his skin was darkened to play the role.\n\nLouis Gossett, Jr, is the first black man to win Best Actor in a Supporting Role for playing a Naval Officer Trainer in An Officer and a Gentleman.\n\n1984\n\nThis was a big year for movies that weren‚Äôt (just) about white people: Best Picture nominees included A Soldier‚Äôs Story, with a mostly-black cast set in Louisiana near the end of World War II; The Killing Fields, set in Democratic Kampuchea during Vietnam with a Cambodian actor, Haing S. Ngor, winning Best Supporting Actor; and A Passage to India, set in India during the British Raj. Although only white actors were nominated for A Passage to India, three actors of color were nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1984. Japanese-American actor Pat Morita was nominated for playing Mr. Miyagi in The Karate Kid.\n\nBetween Haing S. Ngor‚Äôs win in 1984 and Youn Yuh-jung‚Äôs in 2021; no East, Southeast or South Asian actors would win an Oscar.\n\n1985\n\nThe Color Purple is nominated for 11 awards, including Best Picture and acting nods for black actresses Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery. It does not win in any category.\n\nKiss of the Spider Woman, a book adaptation from Brazilian director H√©ctor Eduardo Babenco, is nominated for Best Picture, and white actor William Hurt wins a Best Actor Oscar for playing a gay Latino character named Luis Molina. Molina is in a Brazilian prison with leftist revolutionary Valentin Arregui, played by Puerto Rican actor Ra√∫l Juli√°.\n\nBut Best Picture and a bunch of other awards went to Out of Africa, an intensely problematic colonialist fantasy that has since inspired many themed weddings and a Taylor Swift music video.\n\nIn fact, despite the many people of color represented in top feature film categories that year, all the winners were white.\n\n1987\n\nThe Last Emperor, produced by Jeremy Thomas, wins Best Picture without acquiring a single acting award nomination, one of 11 films in Oscar History to do so. It also becomes one of the most nominated films of all time. All in all, The Last Emperor wins 9 Oscars, representing 15 different human beings, 13 of whom were white. (The two non-white winners were Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto and Chinese composter Cong Su.)\n\nAt this point in Oscar history we start seeing a lot less white people playing people of color and a lot more white people telling stories about people of color that are centered on white people or include white savior elements.\n\nCry Freedom, a standby on the white savior list, earns Denzel Washington his first Academy Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nMorgan Freeman is also nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing a pimp named ‚ÄúFast Black‚Äù in Street Smart.\n\nArgentinian actress Norma Aleandro is nominated for Best Supporting Actress for playing a Mexican character, Florencia S√°nchez Morales, in Gaby: A True Story.\n\n1988\n\nWhite actors Gene Hackman and Frances McDormand are nominated for Acting Oscars for Mississippi Burning, a white savior narrative which sees two FBI agents investigating the murder of a black Civil Rights Organizer in the south. Director Alan Parker said of the choice to center the story on white people, ‚ÄúThe two heroes in the story had to be white. That is a reflection of our society as much as of the film industry. At this point in time, it could not have been made in any other way.‚Äù\n\nMexican-American actor Edward James Olmos is nominated for Best Actor for playing math teacher Jamie Escalante in Stand and Deliver.\n\n1989\n\nDenzel Washington wins an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Glory, playing an escaped slave who joins a platoon during the Civil War. It‚Äôs a good movie but like many of Ed Zwick‚Äôs flicks, there‚Äôs some serious white savior narratives going on.\n\n1990\n\nDances With Wolves, the epitome of a white savior narrative, wins Best Picture. Canadian First Nations actor Graham Greene is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role and many other Native actors appeared in the film. White actors Kevin Costner and Mary McDonnell also earn nominations, and Kevin Costner wins for Best Director.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg wins Best Supporting Actress for playing Oda Mae Brown in Ghost, a con artist posing as a medium who helps Patrick Swayze‚Äôs ghost communicate with his wife.\n\n1992 ‚Äì 1994\n\nOver this span of time six black actors, one Puerto Rican actress (Rosie Perez, Fearless) and one Chinese-Canadian actress (Jennifer Tilly, Bullets Over Broadway) are nominated for Academy Awards for acting in films including Shawshank Redemption, Malcom X, What‚Äôs Love Got To Do With It, The Crying Game and Pulp Fiction. All acting winners for all three years are white. No actors of color were nominated in 1995 or 1997.\n\n1996\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. triumphantly wins Best Actor in a Supporting Role for playing Rod Tidwell in Jerry Maguire, a rare case of a black actor nominated or winning for a comedic role. (Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost might be the other best example of this.)\n\nBlack British actress Marianne Jean-Baptise is nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Secrets & Lies, the first Black British actress to get a nomination.\n\n2000\n\nThe Green Mile, a film described by AlterNet as ‚Äúso racist because its storyline is one of the most unbelievable in Hollywood history. It is only believable through the illogic of racist ideas,‚Äù is nominated for Best Picture. Black actor Michael Clarke Duncan is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing John Coffey, a character Alternet describes as a ‚Äúpicture perfect rendition of racists beloved archetypal ‚ÄòMagic Negro.'‚Äù\n\nDenzel Washington is also nominated for Best Actor for playing boxer Rubin Cartner in the The Hurricaine. All acting winners are white.\n\n2001\n\nBenicio del Toro wins Best Supporting Actor for Traffic.\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is nominated for Best Picture and nine other Academy Awards. Taiwanese-American director Ang Lee wins Best Director, but no actors from the film are nominated for Academy Awards.\n\n2002\n\nFirst Black Woman to Win Lead Actress Oscar: Halle Berry wins Best Actress for Monster‚Äôs Ball!\n\nFirst Black Actor to Win an Oscar for a Movie Directed By A Black Person: Denzel Washington wins Best Actor for Training Day (beating Will Smith, nominated for Ali).\n\nWhite actress Jennifer Connelly wins Best Supporting Actress for playing El Salvadorian Alicia Nash in A Beautiful Mind.\n\n2003\n\nQueen Latifah is nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Best Picture winner Chicago.\n\n2004\n\nFirst Pacific Islander Nominated for an Acting Award: Australian-MƒÅori actress Keisha Castle-Hughes becomes the first Pacific Islander nominated for an Academy Award for Acting when she is nominated for her performance in Whale Rider, as a 12-year-old MƒÅori girl who wants to be chief of her tribe. This also makes her the youngest Academy Award nominee for Lead Actress.\n\nFirst Middle Eastern Actress Nominated for an Academy Award for Acting: Iranian actress Shohreh Aghdashloo is nominated for playing Nadereh ‚ÄúNadi‚Äù Behrani in The House of Sand and Fog.\n\nBlack actor Djimon Hounsou is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for In America. He is the first black actor born in Africa to be nominated.\n\nBenecio Del Toro is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for 21 Grams.\n\nJapanese actor Ken Watanabe is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Lord Katsumoto in The Last Samurai. It‚Äôs another film from Glory‚Äòs Ed Zwick, with similar white savior overtones (white army official personally embodies an effort to liberate people of color). Tom Cruise, despite not being the Last Samurai referenced in the title, was made to seem that way on the movie poster, to much confusion.\n\nAll acting winners are white.\n\n2005\n\nSix actors of color are nominated in 2004. Morgan Freeman wins Best Supporting Actor for Million Dollar Baby and Jamie Foxx is nominated twice ‚Äî Supporting for Collateral, and Best Actor for Ray, which he wins. AND Don Cheadle is nominated for Best Actor for Hotel Rwanda! AND AND AND Sophie Okonedo is nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Hotel Rwanda!

The film was produced by Clint Eastwood, Robert Lorenz, and Steven Spielberg, with an Oscar-nominated Screenplay by Japanese-American screenwriter Iris Yamashita and Paul Haggis. The majority of the film‚Äôs cast are Japanese characters played by Japanese actors, including Ken Watanabe. No actors are nominated for Academy Awards for Letters From Iwo Jima.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is nominated for Best Actor in Blood Diamond, a white savior narrative in which he plays a racist white mercenary who rescues a Sierra Leonese prisoner and his son from revolting rebels. As written in a review of the film in The Age, ‚ÄúIf there is anything black people the world over have learned from Hollywood ‚Äì and there isn‚Äôt a whole lot ‚Äì it‚Äôs that no matter how bleak the situation seems, they can always rely on some resourceful, charismatic white person to bail them out.‚Äù Black actor Djimon Hounsou, who played the prisoner befriended by DiCaprio, is also nominated for an Oscar.\n\n2008\n\nBlack actress Ruby Dee is nominated for Best Supporting Actress for playing the mother of an up-and-coming crime lord in American Gangster.\n\n2009\n\nTaraji P. Henson is nominated for Supporting Actress for playing Queenie, Benjamin Button‚Äôs caretaker in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Viola Davis is nominated for playing Mrs. Miller in Doubt.\n\n2010\n\nSandra Bullock wins Best Actress for The Blind Side, another pitch-perfect example of a white savior narrative. Her character is a white mother and football fan who takes in and raises black future Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Micheal Oher. The Blind Side is also nominated for Best Picture.\n\nAlso nominated for Best Picture in 2009 is Avatar, which embodies every white savior narrative ever. In i09, Annalee Newitz writes that Avatar ‚Äúis the essence of the white guilt fantasy, laid bare.‚Äù\n\nMo‚ÄôNique wins Best Actress in a Supporting Role for playing Precious‚Äôs abusive mother in Precious, for which Gabourey Sidibe is also nominated but loses (to Sandra Bullock). Morgan Freeman gets a Best Actor nod for playing Nelson Mandela in Invictus.\n\nSlumdog Millionaire, a British film shot in India with a majority Indian cast, wins Best Picture!

Black actress Octavia Spencer wins Best Supporting Actress for playing outspoken maid Minny Jackson.\n\nViola Davis is nominated for Best Actress for playing maid Aibileen Clark. In The New York Times‚Äô recent analysis of which black characters earn Oscar nominations, it is noted that ‚Äúin the history of the Oscars, 10 black women have been nominated for best actress, and nine of them played characters who are homeless or might soon become so. (The exception is Viola Davis, for the 2011 drama ‚ÄúThe Help.‚Äù)‚Äù\n\n2013\n\nWhite actor Ben Affleck plays Hispanic CIA Agent Tony Mendez in Argo, which inexplicably wins Best Picture.\n\nWhite director Quentin Tarantino and white actor Christopher Waltz win Oscars for Django Unchained, the story of a white bounty hunter and the slave he freed, Django, who set out to free Django‚Äôs wife from a sadistic plantation owner.
