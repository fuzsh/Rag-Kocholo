        "text": "Academy Award nominees vying for Oscars statuettes at annual award ceremonies generally happen on a Sunday evening in the last week of February in Los Angeles. The Academy Awards -- more commonly known as the Oscars -- are the oldest and most influential of film awards, often serving as an influencing model from which other types of performing arts award ceremonies fashion their format. The awards, first presented in May 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, are overseen by AMPAS, a non-profit professional organization whose acronym stands for \"Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\" AMPAS is based in Beverly Hills, California, and was founded in 1927.\n\nThe awards ceremony was first broadcast to radio in 1930 and televised for the first time in 1953. It is now seen live in more than 200 countries and can be streamed live online. Pricewaterhouse (now PricewaterhouseCoopers) has managed the Academy Awards balloting process since 1935 - all but the first six years of the Oscars. Ever since 1941, when their now-famous confidential envelope system was introduced, marking the first year of complete secrecy, \"the Envelope Please\" has become a familiar phrase that evokes the thought of the Academy Awards® ceremony.\n\nExcept for the early years of the institution, the awards honored films made during the previous 12-month calendar year. At first, to be eligible for an award, a film had to open in Los Angeles during the twelve months ending on July 31 of the preceding year. To allow each ceremony to cover films for a single calendar year - matching the eligibility period, the 1932/33 awards were based on a 17-month qualifying period. Ever since then, beginning with the 1934 awards ceremony, all awards have been based on openings in the previous calendar year.\n\nThrough whatever qualifying format changes that might have evolved through the years, recognition of a core group of awards, known as the \"Big Five,\" Oscars has been more of a constant throughout the Academy Awards evolution. The so-called \"Big Five\" awards are categorized as:\n\nBest Picture\n\nActor in a Leading Role\n\nActress in a Leading Role\n\nDirecting\n\nWriting (either Original Screenplay or Adapted Screenplay)\n\nRight up to the 88th Academy Award nominations in 2016, 42 films have been nominated for the \"Big Five\" including three 1967 films (\"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,\" and \"The Graduate\") and three 1981 films (\"Atlantic City,\" \"On Golden Pond,\" and \"Reds\").\n\nThe following video, 'The history of the Oscars' from The Telegraph newspaper, will provide a comprehensive annotated summary set to music of the Academy Awards through the years, including how the famous Oscar gold trophy statue was awarded its name, as well as to take a look at some of the most famous Oscar moments over the years.\n\nMake sure to check the AMPAS news stream below the Oscars history chart.\n\nOscars Instagram\n\nOscars' Big 5 winners from the beginning of its history\n\nYear\n\nBest Picture\n\nActor in a Leading Role\n\nActress in a Leading Role\n\nDirecting\n\nWriting (Original Screenplay/Adapted Screenplay)\n\n1927/28 (1st) Wings (Paramount Famous Lasky) Emil Jannings -- The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh Janet Gaynor -- 7th Heaven, Street Angel, and Sunrise Frank Borzage -- 7th Heaven Benjamin Glazer -- 7th Heaven 1928/29 (2nd) The Broadway Melody (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) Warner Baxter -- In Old Arizona Mary Pickford -- Coquette Frank Lloyd -- The Divine Lady Hans Kraly -- The Patriot 1929/30 (3rd) All Quiet on the Western Front (Universal) George Arliss -- Disraeli Norma Shearer -- The Divorcee Lewis Milestone -- All Quiet on the Western Front The Big House -- Frances Marion 1930/31 (4th) Cimarron (RKO Radio) Lionel Barrymore -- A Free Soul Marie Dressler -- Min and Bill Skippy -- Norman Taurog Cimarron -- Howard Estabrook 1931/32 (5th) Grand Hotel (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) Wallace Beery -- The Champ Helen Hayes -- The Sin of Madelon Claudet Bad Girl -- Frank Borzage Bad Girl -- Edwin Burke 1932/33 (6th) Cavalcade (Fox) Charles Laughton -- The Private Life of Henry VIII Katharine Hepburn -- Morning Glory Cavalcade -- Frank Lloyd Little Women -- Victor Heerman, Sarah Y.
