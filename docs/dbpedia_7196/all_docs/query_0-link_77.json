        "text": "Variety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony Awards ceremonies, curated by Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\nVisit the prediction pages for the respective ceremonies via the links below:\n\nOSCARS | EMMYS | GRAMMYS | TONYS\n\n2024 Oscars Predictions:\n\nBest Original Song\n\nWeekly Commentary (Updated March 7, 2024): With an original song win, Billie Eilish, 22, and Finneas, 26, would become the youngest artists ever to win two Oscars before the age of 30. The pair won for James Bond theme “No Time to Die” in 2022, and are nominated this year for “What Was I Made For,” from “Barbie.” Only three individuals have clinched two Oscars before turning 30: Luise Rainer earned back to back Oscars by the time she was 28 for “The Great Ziegfeld” (1936) and “The Good Earth” (1937); Jodie Foster in 1989 for “The Accused” (age 26) and in 1992 for “The Silence of the Lambs” (29); and Hilary Swank in 2000 for “Boys Don’t Cry” (26) and in 2005 for “Million Dollar Baby” (29).\n\nMeanwhile, Diane Warren faces a less enviable milestone with her 15th nomination for “The Fire Inside” from “Flamin’ Hot,” potentially tying with the late Alex North and the still-active Thomas Newman for the second-most number of nominations without a win, just behind sound mixer Greg Russell’s 16.\n\nWill Win: “Barbie” (“What Was I Made For?” by Billie Eilish, Finneas O’Connell)\n\nCould Win: “Barbie” (“I’m Just Ken” by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt)\n\nShould Win: “I’m Just Ken”\n\nShould have been here: “The Iron Claw” (“Live That Way Forever” by Laurel Sprengelmeyer and Richard Reed Parry, Little Scream) and “The Color Purple” (“Workin’” by Blitz Bazawule and Nick Baxter)\n\nRead: Variety’s Awards Circuit for the latest Oscars predictions in all categories.\n\nThe 96th Oscars will be held on Sunday, March 10.\n\nAnd the Nominees Are:\n\nEligible Titles (Alphabetized by Studio)**\n\n2022 category winner: “RRR” (Variance Films) — “Naatu Naatu” by M. M. Keeravani (music) and Chandrabose (lyrics)\n\nOscars Predictions Categories\n\nBEST PICTURE | DIRECTOR | BEST ACTOR | BEST ACTRESS | SUPPORTING ACTOR | SUPPORTING ACTRESS | ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY | ADAPTED SCREENPLAY | ANIMATED FEATURE | PRODUCTION DESIGN | CINEMATOGRAPHY | COSTUME DESIGN | FILM EDITING | MAKEUP & HAIRSTYLING | SOUND | VISUAL EFFECTS | ORIGINAL SCORE | ORIGINAL SONG | DOCUMENTARY FEATURE | INTERNATIONAL FEATURE | ANIMATED SHORT | DOCUMENTARY SHORT | LIVE ACTION SHORT\n\nAbout the Academy Awards\n\nThe Academy Awards, better known as the Oscars, is Hollywood’s most prestigious artistic award in the film industry. Since 1927, nominees and winners have been selected by members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). Seventeen branches are represented within the nearly 10,000-person membership. The branches are actors, associates, casting directors, cinematographers, costume designers, directors, documentary, executives, film editors, makeup and hairstylists, marketing and public relations, members-at-large, members-at-large (artists’ representatives), music, producers, production design, short films and feature animation, sound, visual effects and writers."
