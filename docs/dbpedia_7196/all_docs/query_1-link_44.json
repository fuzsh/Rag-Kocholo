        "text": "Jon Batiste performs emotional ballad \"It Never Went Away\" at Oscars\n\n“It Never Went Away” couldn’t be more personal for Jon Batiste.\n\nThe celebrated New Orleans artist performed the song from “American Symphony,” the documentary that tells the story of him trying to write a symphony as his wife, author Suleika Jaouad, battled leukemia.\n\nBatiste brought his full self to the performance of a song which, with its poignant lyrics, very much feels like a love letter to their relationship.\n\nThe piano intro alone is moving and the Grammy-winning artist made clear why the song was nominated.\n\nFellow nominee Billie Eilish was shown clapping enthusiastically for Batiste.\n\nDid you spot Angelina Jolie's cameo on the Oscars red carpet?\n\n“American Symphony” documentary star Suleika Jaouad arrived at tonight’s Academy Awards in a gown crafted by an up-and-coming designer who knows the red carpet well — Angelina Jolie.\n\nJolie was not seen crossing the red carpet this evening herself, but her creation commanded attention worthy of an A-Lister. A head-turning detail was on the back of the gown: hand-drawn illustrations — courtesy of the artist Chaz Guest — of a composer directing his orchestra adorning the silk.\n\nJolie was inspired by the documentary’s message of resilience and the healing powers music can have, she told Vogue, and wanted to feature Jaouad’s husband, Jon Batiste, who also stars in the documentary (and is nominated for best original song).\n\n\"Oppenheimer,\" which many expect to have a big night, has picked up another win\n\nThe Oscar for best editing goes to “Oppenheimer.”\n\n“Oppenheimer” was the highest grossing R-rated movie of 2023, and “marks the fastest a Universal R-rated film has hit the $200 million threshold domestically,” according to Universal Pictures.\n\n\"Godzilla Minus One\" has won the Oscar for best visual effects\n\nThe Oscar for best visual effects has gone to “Godzilla Minus One.”\n\nRobert Downey Jr. has won his first Oscar\n\nDon’t call it a comeback.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. won the best supporting actor Academy Award for his role in this season’s award show darling: “Oppenheimer.”\n\nIt follows his best supporting actor wins at the Golden Globes and BAFTA, and marks his first Oscar win.\n\nHe also thanked his wife, Susan Downey, “for loving him back to life.”\n\nThe actor’s role as Lewis Strauss — the man who clashed with J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb — has been hailed as one of his best performances.\n\nJohn Cena gives out costume design Oscar in his birthday suit\n\nThank goodness that envelope was extra large.\n\nJohn Cena couldn’t open the winner’s envelope because he appeared naked on stage, and used it to cover his private parts.\n\nAfter hiding behind the set design, Kimmel coaxed him out after a conversation about a streaking bit he was originally supposed to do live on stage.\n\n“The male body is not a joke,” Cena said.\n\n“Mine is,” Kimmel replied.\n\n“Dude I don’t wrestle naked, I wrestle in jorts,” Cena said. (“Jorts” are jean shorts, for the uninitiated).\n\n“Jorts are worse than naked,” Kimmel said.\n\nCena then had the crowd in fits as he walked out, covered in nothing but the envelope.\n\nBehind the bit: Cena wasn’t actually naked, a source close to production tells CNN.\n\n“He was covered in the groin and butt crack area — and the envelope was velcroed to him,” this source says.\n\nThe reason for the safety measures around Cena’s private parts? The show had to make sure there were no FCC violations, CNN understands.\n\nJonathan Glazer speaks out against war in Gaza as he accepts Oscar for \"The Zone of Interest\"\n\n“The Zone of Interest” has been awarded the Oscar for best international feature film.\n\nWriter and director Jonathan Glazer used his acceptance speech to speak about the war in Gaza.\n\n“Whether the victims of October 7 in Israel, or the ongoing attack on Gaza, all are victims of this dehumanization,” Glazer continued.\n\nAbout the movie: The United Kingdom-made film centers on the real-life Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss and his family, who live bucolic and seemingly mundane lives next door to the infamous concentration camp.\n\nBut viewers never see the unspeakable horrors taking place just on the other side of the garden wall. Instead, they hear them.\n\nCNN’s Harmeet Kaur contributed reporting to this post.\n\nEmily Blunt And Ryan Gosling get competitive over \"Barbenheimer\" while presenting\n\nEmily Blunt and Ryan Gosling were in competitive mode while acknowledging movie stunts on stage at the Oscars.\n\nThe two starts of the movies talked about the cultural phenomenon of what’s been termed “Barbenheimer,” the massive popularity of two recent movies, “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.\n\nBlunt noted how the night was going for “Oppenheimer,” saying to Gosling, “And the way this awards season turned out, wasn’t that much of a rivalry so let it go.”\n\nGosling replied, “It’s true. You guys are doing very well, congratulations. But I think I figured out why they call it Barbieheimer and they didn’t call it Oppenbarbie.”\n\n“Why?” Blunt asked.\n\nGosling explained, “I think you guys are at the tail end of that because you were riding Barbie’s coattails all summer.”\n\n\"Poor Things\" is on a roll with third Oscar of the night\n\n“Poor Things” has earned its third Oscar of the night, this time for best costume design. It earlier won the awards for best production design and for best makeup and hairstyling.\n\nHolly Waddington accepted the award and thanked her fellow nominees for inspiring her to become a costume designer.\n\nShe also thanked the cast for going with whatever she threw at them — especially Emma Stone, the lead actress in the film.\n\nIn “Poor Things,” Stone plays a child-like woman who is reanimated by a mad professor-type using the brain of her unborn child.\n\nThe post was updated with Waddington’s remarks from the stage,\n\n2nd Oscar of the night for \"Poor Things\"\n\n“Poor Things” has won the Academy Award for best production design, the second award tonight for the movie by Yorgos Lanthimos.\n\nBillie Eilish offers beautiful, stripped down rendition of \"What Was I Made For\"\n\nBillie Eilish was joined by her brother, Finneas, for her performance of her hit song from “Barbie.”\n\nWith just the two of them — Finneas on piano — she offered an emotional version of the song.\n\nThe song feels so deeply personal that many people have assumed that it’s about the singer, something she denies.\n\n“It was so purely about ‘Barbie’ and how she feels, and I felt I could look through her eyes and see the world and write from her perspective,” she told the Los Angeles Times recently. “And I was truly not thinking about myself. We weren’t talking about my life.”\n\nEilish was simply made for this.\n\nRyan Gosling, Jon Batiste and Billie Eilish among performers for tonight's show\n\nRyan Gosling isn’t just Ken, he’s also now officially a celebrated singer.\n\nIt was announced last month that the “Barbie” star will perform the movie’s hit song “I’m Just Ken,” along with collaborator Mark Ronson at today’s Academy Awards ceremony.\n\nProducers of the Oscars appear to be leaning to star power at this year’s show.\n\n“I’m Just Ken” is up for best original song as Gosling is competing in the best supporting actor category.\n\nAnd it’s not the only “Barbie” song up for the sought-after award.\n\n“What Was I Made For?” from the soundtrack is also nominated and will be performed by Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O’Connell. The song recently snagged a Grammy for song of the year.\n\nJon Batiste is set to perform “It Never Went Away” from the film “American Symphony,” while Becky G will hit the stage with “The Fire Inside” from “Flamin’ Hot.”\n\nScott George and the Osage Singers are set to perform “Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People)” from “Killers of the Flower Moon.”\n\nAmerica Ferrera sparkles in Barbie-pink chainmail gown\n\nIn a night of muted tones (so far), America Ferrera wowed in a slinky, shimmering pink gown, courtesy of Versace.\n\nPer E! News, stylist Karla Welch said the luxury house cycled through 10 different types of chainmail to arrive at the final look.\n\n“Barbie” has provided a wealth of inspiration for cast members’ red-carpet looks during the year, from Margot Robbie’s literal adaptations of famous Barbie dolls to Ryan Gosling’s Kenergy-infused suits.\n\nTonight, Ferrera hopes to take home the award for best supporting actress for her role as mom Gloria in the blockbuster hit, which would be a historic win — only two other Latina actors have won in the category with Mercedes Ruehl in 1991 and Ariana DeBose in 2021.\n\nOscars host Jimmy Kimmel on the role of politics during the Oscars\n\nOscars host Jimmy Kimmel is not planning to devote much time to on Sunday is politics. However, it all depends on the news cycle.\n\nThat likely means no jokes about former President Donald Trump, though Kimmel has had a lot to say about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on his late-night show in the past.\n\nKimmel said that he’s prepared for how another Trump administration would impact late-night television, but he’s “more worried about the country than my monologues.”\n\n“I just cannot believe that anyone thinks it would be a good idea to put him back in the White House,” Kimmel said.\n\nDespite his strong opinions about Trump, Kimmel told CNN he’d like to have a conversation with him on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” “I would absolutely have him on the show,” Kimmel said. “I do think there are a lot of questions I would like to ask him, and I would like to get actual answers. I think most of the interviews that he does don’t require those.”\n\nWatch his response in the clip below:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n1e2e8839-3534-4ebf-9dfc-a6448421ff2f.mp4\n\n01:19 - Source: cnn\n\nRamy Youssef, Mark Ruffalo and Billie Eilish are wearing matching pins to Oscars. What do they represent?\n\nRamy Youssef, Mark Ruffalo and Billie Eilish wore matching red lapel pins to the Academy Awards, but what do they mean?\n\nThe pins call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. A group of over 400 stars have joined Artists4Ceasefire, which in late October first published a letter urging the US Congress and President Joe Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel through Artists4Ceasefire.org.\n\nIn a press statement, Artists4Ceasefire said: “The pin symbolizes collective support for an immediate and permanent cease-fire, the release of all of the hostages and for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza.”\n\nOther stars who have signed the letter include Cate Blanchett, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez, Bradley Cooper, Annie Lennox and America Ferrera.\n\nThe post was updated with the detail that Mark Ruffalo was also wearing the ceasefire pin.\n\nWhy Taylor Swift or Aaron Rodgers jokes won't likely come up in Kimmel's monologue\n\nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce may have been the buzziest subject of football season, but for award season, Jimmy Kimmel isn’t so sure the celebrity couple will get a mention in his opening monologue at the Oscars on Sunday.\n\nWhen asked if he plans to talk about Swift and Kelce onstage during his fourth time as host of Hollywood’s biggest night, Kimmel told CNN in an interview this week that the duo is “not off limits, but probably played out.”\n\nIt’s a careful balance, Kimmel explained, to poke fun at the celebrities gathered inside the Dolby Theatre, while not offending them.\n\nOn Aaron Rodgers, who ignited a controversy with Kimmel after falsely suggesting the comedian would be mentioned in court documents connected to the Jeffrey Epstein case, Kimmel quipped, “Uh, I don’t know who that is.” Jokes aside, Kimmel said he doesn’t plan to mention Rodgers during the Oscars ceremony, and the athlete is not likely to be invited onto “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” anytime soon.\n\n“Probably not,” Kimmel responded when asked if there’s a world in which he would have Rodgers on his show as a guest. “The way I look at it,” he continued, “The next step is for Aaron Rodgers to reach out to me – not the other way around. So, I don’t see that happening. Listen, we have some major differences in the way we think.”\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" leads Oscars contenders with 13 nominations\n\nAs expected, “Oppenheimer” had a strong showing when the 96th Academy Awards nominees were revealed last month.\n\nThe Christopher Nolan film leads Oscar contenders with 13 nominations.\n\nThe fantasy film “Poor Things,” starring Emma Stone, followed with 11, while the Martin Scorsese drama “Killers of the Flower Moon” got 10 nominations.\n\nThe summer blockbuster “Barbie” earned eight nominations.\n\nHere are the nominees in three key categories, and check out the full list of nominees here.\n\nBest picture:\n\n“American Fiction”\n\n“Anatomy of a Fall”\n\n“Barbie”\n\n“The Holdovers”\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\n“Maestro”\n\n“Oppenheimer”\n\n“Past Lives”\n\n“Poor Things”\n\n“The Zone of Interest”\n\nBest actor in a leading role:\n\nBradley Cooper, “Maestro”\n\nColman Domingo, “Rustin”\n\nPaul Giamatti, “The Holdovers”\n\nCillian Murphy, “Oppenheimer”\n\nJeffrey Wright, “American Fiction”\n\nBest actress in a leading role:\n\nAnnette Bening, “Nyad”\n\nLily Gladstone, “Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\nSandra Hüller, “Anatomy of a Fall”\n\nCarey Mulligan, “Maestro”\n\nEmma Stone, “Poor Things”\n\nWolfgang Puck previews menu for the exclusive Governors Ball after the Oscars\n\nFamed chef and restaurateur Wolfgang Puck spoke to CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister on the red carpet a short time ago.\n\nHe’s the man behind the menu at the exclusive Governors Ball, the lavish after-party held after each Academy Awards.\n\nSome of the night’s biggest stars will feast on smoked salmon, macaroni and cheese, mushroom risotto with truffles, Peking duck and much more, Puck said.\n\nHe also told Wagmeister about some of his favorite interactions with A-listers, including the time actor Joaquin Phoenix stepped into the kitchen to enjoy his meal with the staff, and the time Julia Roberts kissed the chefs as she exited through the kitchen.\n\nLegendary funny-man Bill Murray also made an appearance on one occasion, throwing steak salt everywhere.\n\nAnalysis: \"Barbie\" saved the box office, but \"Oppenheimer\" is the movie awards voters have been waiting for\n\n“Barbie” might have saved the summer box office, but as the lengthy build-up to the Oscars nears its end, “Oppenheimer” is clearly the movie that award voters have been waiting for.\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan’s historical epic about the father of the atomic bomb added awards from the Screen Actors Guild and the Producers Guild of America over the weekend – the latter having emerged as one of the most reliable bellwethers for the Academy Awards, aligning with the best-picture winner 11 of the last 14 years.\n\nThrow in the film’s 13 Academy Award nominations and previous wins at the Golden Globes, Directors Guild of America, the BAFTAs and the Critics Choice Awards, and while there could always be some stunning surprise, to all appearances the Oscar race is likely over except for the acceptance speeches thanking the Academy and Universal Pictures.\n\nIn hindsight, the golden hardware showered on “Oppenheimer” should have been predictable, given all the boxes that the film checks. Near the top of that list, despite trailing “Barbie” in revenues the film still grossed nearly $1 billion worldwide, providing award voters with a rare mix of prestige – a star-studded cast, a long-admired director and weighty material – and the kind of commercial success that actually might help attract TV viewers.\n\nRead more about Oppenheimer\n\nRyan Gosling says what everyone’s thinking about \"Barbie\" Oscar nomination omissions: Read his full statement\n\nRyan Gosling is grateful for his Oscar nomination, but joined the chorus of people who question the omission of his costar Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig from their individual respective categories.\n\nGosling was nominated in the supporting actor category for his portrayal of Mattel’s Ken doll in “Barbie,” last year’s biggest blockbuster, starring alongside Robbie’s titular Barbie.\n\nHis nomination counts as one of the eight nods that the film received, but the furor over the hit movie’s director Gerwig and Robbie not earning individual nominations in the director and lead actress categories, respectively, has been ongoing since the nominations were announced. (“Barbie” was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nWhile Gerwig and Robbie were not recognized individually, they did each earn Oscar nominations this week. Gerwig was recognized in the adapted screenplay category alongside her “Barbie” co-writer (and husband) Noah Baumbach, and Robbie was nominated as a producer with the film’s best picture nomination, alongside three others.\n\nIn his statement, Gosling also honored his costar America Ferrera, who earned a surprise supporting actress nod for her performance in the film.\n\nRead Gosling’s full statement, as provided to CNN.\n\n\"Godzilla: Minus One\" team steps onto the red carpet in clawed heels\n\nMethod dressing on the red carpet has reached new heights this season (most recently with the incredible looks from the “Dune: Part Two” press tour), and the creative team from “Godzilla: Minus One” certainly got the memo with matching clawed heels.\n\nDirector Takashi Yamazaki, and CGI and visual effects directors Masaki Takahashi, Kiyoko Shibuya and Tatsuji Nojima each got a little lift with reptilian claws cupping their heeled shoes and boots. They also posed with Godzilla figures from the kaiju film.\n\n“Godzilla: Minus One” nabbed a slew of awards at the Japan Academy Film Prize (otherwise known as the Japanese Academy Awards) two days ago, and the team hopes to take home the Oscar for Visual Effects tonight. They are up against the teams from “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” “The Creator” and “Napoleon.”"
