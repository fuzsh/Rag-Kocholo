        "text": "Submitted for your consideration last year were 15 films with local ties that either won or were nominated for Academy Awards. Given Hollywood’s history of casting the versatile High Desert in its productions, that list could only grow upon further research. So it has.\n\nHere, then, are 11 more films shot in the High Desert, a vast region that includes parts of San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Kern and Inyo counties. This crop amassed 16 statuettes and 47 nominations. Once again, they are listed chronologically by release year.\n\n1. “In Old Arizona” (1928): This Pre-Code Western is among the only adaptations to remain faithful to O. Henry’s original short story in depicting the Cisco Kid as a cold-blooded killer, according to historian Chon Noriega. “In Old Arizona” received five Academy Award nominations in 1930. Warner Baxter won for Best Actor. It was shot, in part, in Joshua Tree and the surrounding desert.\n\n2. “Lost Horizon” (1937): Before John Ford used Lucerne Valley’s Rabbit Dry Lake for the “Stagecoach” chase scene, director Frank Capra transformed the same flat space into an isolated airplane refueling depot en route to Shangri-La in the Himalayas. “Lost Horizon” earned seven Oscar nominations in 1938, winning for Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing.\n\n3. “The Grapes of Wrath” (1940): Speaking of Ford, two years after his Lucerne Valley trip, the director took to farther reaches of the High Desert for scenes in his adaptation of John Steinbeck’s novel. In the film, the Joad family enters Needles after crossing into California via Route 66’s Old Trails Bridge. Another scene places them just east of Daggett at a state inspection station. “The Grapes of Wrath” received seven nods from the Academy. Ford won for Best Director while Jane Darwell took Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Ma Joad.\n\n4. “The Great Lie” (1941): This dramatic gem was tentatively titled “Far Horizon” when Bette Davis and Mary Astor were brought to Victorville’s 3 Sage Hens Ranch — near modern-day Spring Valley Lake — in December 1940 for a 4-day shoot. A Victor Press article noted “fine weather” meant the crew wrapped up its work in just two days, but that pace didn’t thwart the opportunity for a photograph of the actresses with the Philips family, who owned the ranch. Astor’s role won her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.\n\n5. “The Story of G.I. Joe” (1945): Locals buzzed in November 1944 when the cast and crew of this William A. Wellman-directed World War II film descended on “the outskirts of Victorville” to shoot what eventually stood in for North African locales. The story focuses on infantrymen as detailed in columns by war correspondent Ernie Pyle. Hundreds of soldiers were part of the cast. They camped in tents locally during a two-week stay. Many of them, along with Pyle, were killed during the Battle of Okinawa before the film’s premiere. “G.I. Joe” received four Academy Award nominations, including the only one of Robert Mitchum’s storied career.\n\n6. “The Bad and the Beautiful” (1952): Kirk Douglas was no stranger to the High Desert. He frequented the Apple Valley Inn and learned to ride horses at the Apple Valley Livery Stables for 1951’s “Along the Great Divide.” This film, though, was no Western. “The Bad and the Beautiful,” details the seedy inner workings of Hollywood with Douglas, Lana Turner and Dick Powell at its center. Several scenes were shot in Lake Arrowhead. Directed by Vincente Minnelli, the film scored five Oscars from six nods. Douglas was the lone miss, losing Best Actor to Gary Cooper in “High Noon.”\n\n7. “The Great White Hope” (1970): Iconic actor James Earl Jones received his only Academy Award nom to date for his portrayal of Jack Jefferson in this film that drew from the life of Jack Johnson, the first African American world heavyweight boxing champ. Jane Alexander was nominated in the Best Actress category. A scene wherein the two drive to the mountains for a tryst was shot at Cedar Lake just south of Big Bear Lake. Though neither won, Jones and Alexander earned Tony Awards in 1969 while “The Great White Hope” was on Broadway.\n\n8. “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” (1977): Two years after “Jaws” made Steven Spielberg the most popular filmmaker in Hollywood, “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” made him one of the most acclaimed. The film follows Richard Dreyfuss’ journey toward contact with extraterrestrial life, garnering nine Oscar nominations along the way. \"Encounters\" won Best Cinematography and the Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing. The opening scene, which depicts Mexico’s Sonora Desert, was filmed on El Mirage Dry Lake, 10 miles northwest of Adelanto.\n\n9. “Jurassic Park” (1993): And lest we forget Spielberg’s little dinosaur drama, which was sadly overshadowed by some colorless fare remembered today for being a “Seinfeld” punchline. While “Schindler’s List” (also Spielberg) stole the 66th Academy Awards, “Jurassic Park” makes this list for the archeological dig scene filmed at Red Rock Canyon State Park located 86 miles northwest of Barstow. It won Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Sound and Sound Effects Editing.\n\n10. “Iron Man” (2008) and “Iron Man 2” (2010): In their characters, themes and proliferation, superhero pictures are, no doubt, today’s Westerns. As such, it’s hard to find one that wasn’t shot in some remote desert. But Jon Favreau’s first “Iron Man” stands apart for its multiple High Desert locations. Lone Pine’s Alabama Hills, Edwards Air Force Base and Palmdale Regional Airport all make appearances. “Iron Man 2” was shot at Edwards, too, but it’s only here because Marvel Studios mandated it. The films combined for three nods in the Sound Editing and Visual Effects categories.\n\nMatthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.
