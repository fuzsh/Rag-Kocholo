        "text": "THE ACADEMY AWARDS, 1929-2024\n\nThe Academy Awards (better known as “The Oscars”) are the most prominent film award in the United States. Though there will always be debate over whether certain year’s winners were really the best, as opposed to just the favorite, winning an Oscar still carries enormous prestige. The Awards are given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a professional honorary organization which currently has a voting membership of over 9,400. Actors make up the largest voting bloc with a membership of over 1,300. Academy Awards are nicknamed “Oscars,” which is also the nickname of the statuette that is awarded. (No one knows for certain, but one commonly accepted story is that the name was born when Academy librarian Margaret Herrick first saw the statuette and said “It looks just like my uncle Oscar!”). When the Awards first began, in order to qualify a film had to open in Los Angeles during the twelve months ending on July 31 of the previous year. Beginning in 1934, it was changed so that each year’s Awards are given to films that actually opened at any time in the previous calendar year, January 1 to December 31. Awards are usually presented in February or March, for the previous year’s films.\n\nThe following listing gives the Academy Award winners for Best Motion Picture, Actor in a Leading Role, Actress in a Leading Role, Director, and International Feature Film. (Prior to the awards for 2019, this last category was called Foreign Language Film. Competitive awards for Best Foreign Language Film began with the awards for 1956, though between 1947-1955 the Academy did present special honorary awards to the best foreign language film.)\n\nWinners are CAPITALIZED and listed first; other nominations for that year are listed following the winner. Note that this listing is by the year the award was presented (for movies from the previous year), NOT by the year of the movie’s release.\n\n2024\n\nPicture:\n\nOPPENHEIMER, American Fiction, Anatomy of a Fall, Barbie, The Holdovers, Killers of the Flower Moon, Maestro, Past Lives, Poor Things, The Zone of Interest\n\nActor:\n\nCILLIAN MURPHY in Oppenheimer, Bradley Cooper in Maestro, Colman Domingo in Rustin, Paul Giamatti in The Holdovers, Jeffrey Wright in American Fiction\n\nActress:\n\nEMMA STONE in Poor Things, Annette Bening in Nyad, Lily Gladstone in Killers of the Flower Moon, Sandra Hüller in Anatomy of a Fall, Carey Mulligan in Maestro\n\nDirector:\n\nCHRISTOPHER NOLAN for Oppenheimer, Justine Triet for Anatomy of a Fall, Martin Scorsese for Killers of the Flower Moon, Yorgos Lanthimos for Poor Things, Jonathan Glazer for The Zone of Interest\n\nInternational:\n\nTHE ZONE OF INTEREST (United Kingdom)\n\n2023\n\nPicture:\n\nEVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE, Elvis, The Fabelmans, Tár, Top Gun: Maverick, Triangle of Sadness, Women Talking\n\nActor:\n\nBRENDAN FRASER in The Whale, Austin Butler in Elvis, Colin Farrell in The Banshees of Inisherin, Paul Mescal in Aftersun, Bill Nighy in Living\n\nActress:\n\nMICHELLE YEOH in Everything Everywhere All at Once, Cate Blanchett in Tár, Ana de Armas in Blonde, Andrea Riseborough in To Leslie, Michelle Williams in The Fabelmans\n\nDirector:\n\nDANIEL KWAN AND DANIEL SCHEINERT for Everything Everywhere All at Once, Martin McDonagh for The Banshees of Inisherin, Steven Spielberg for The Fabelmans, Todd Field for Tár, Ruben Östlund for Triangle of Sadness\n\nInternational:\n\nALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Germany)\n\n2022\n\nPicture:\n\nCODA, Belfast, Don't Look Up, Drive My Car, Dune, King Richard, Licorice Pizza, Nightmare Alley, The Power of the Dog, West Side Story\n\nActor:\n\nWILL SMITH in King Richard, Javier Bardem in Being the Ricardos, Benedict Cumberbatch in The Power of the Dog, Andrew Garfield in tick, tick...BOOM!, Denzel Washington in The Tragedy of Macbeth\n\nActress:\n\nJESSICA CHASTAIN in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Olivia Colman in The Lost Daughter, Penélope Cruz in Parallel Mothers, Nicole Kidman in Being the Ricardos, Kristen Stewart in Spencer\n\nDirector:\n\nJANE CAMPION for The Power of the Dog, Kenneth Branagh for Belfast, Ryusuke Hamaguchi for Drive My Car, Paul Thomas Anderson for Licorice Pizza, Steven Spielberg for West Side Story\n\nInternational:\n\nDRIVE MY CAR (Japan)\n\n2021\n\nPicture:\n\nNOMADLAND, The Father, Judas and the Black Messiah, Mank, Minari, Promising Young Woman, Sound of Metal, The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nActor:\n\nANTHONY HOPKINS in The Father, Riz Ahmed in Sound of Metal, Chadwick Boseman in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Gary Oldman in Mank, Steven Yeun in Minari\n\nActress:\n\nFRANCES McDORMAND in Nomadland, Viola Davis in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Andra Day in The United States vs. Billie Holiday, Vanessa Kirby in Pieces of a Woman, Carey Mulligan in Promising Young Woman\n\nDirector:\n\nCHLOÉ ZHAO for Nomadland, Thomas Vinterberg for Another Round, David Fincher for Mank, Lee Isaac Chung for Minari, Emerald Fennell for Promising Young Woman\n\nInternational:\n\nANOTHER ROUND (Denmark)\n\n2020\n\nPicture:\n\nPARASITE, 1917, Ford v Ferrari, The Irishman, Jojo Rabbit, Joker, Little Women, Marriage Story, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nActor:\n\nJOAQUIN PHOENIX in Joker, Antonio Banderas in Pain and Glory, Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Adam Driver in Marriage Story, Jonathan Pryce in The Two Popes\n\nActress:\n\nRENÉE ZELLWEGER in Judy, Cynthia Erivo in Harriet, Scarlett Johansson in Marriage Story, Saoirse Ronan in Little Women, Charlize Theron in Bombshell\n\nDirector:\n\nBONG JOON-HO for Parasite, Sam Mendes for 1917, Todd Phillips for Joker, Martin Scorsese for The Irishman, Quentin Tarantino for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nInternational:\n\nPARASITE (South Korea)\n\n2019\n\nPicture:\n\nGREEN BOOK, Black Panther, BlacKkKlansman, Bohemian Rhapsody, The Favourite, Roma, A Star Is Born, Vice\n\nActor:\n\nRAMI MALEK in Bohemian Rhapsody, Christian Bale in Vice, Bradley Cooper in A Star Is Born, Willem Dafoe in At Eternity’s Gate, Viggo Mortensen in Green Book\n\nActress:\n\nOLIVIA COLMAN in The Favourite, Yalitza Aparicio in Roma, Glenn Close in The Wife, Lady Gaga in A Star Is Born, Melissa McCarthy in Can You Ever Forgive Me?\n\nDirector:\n\nALFONSO CUARÓN for Roma, Yorgos Lanthimos for The Favourite, Spike Lee for BlacKkKlansman, Adam McKay for Vice, Pawel Pawlikowski for Cold War\n\nForeign:\n\nROMA (Mexico)\n\n2018\n\nPicture:\n\nTHE SHAPE OF WATER, Call Me by Your Name, Darkest Hour, Dunkirk, Get Out, Lady Bird, Phantom Thread, The Post, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\nActor:\n\nGARY OLDMAN in Darkest Hour, Timothée Chalamet in Call Me by Your Name, Daniel Day-Lewis in Phantom Thread, Daniel Kaluuya in Get Out, Denzel Washington in Roman J.
