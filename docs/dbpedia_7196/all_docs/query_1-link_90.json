        "text": "If you cringe at films that reimagine Hitler, Hoffa and hallucinating villains in greasepaint, you still might consider tuning in to Sunday night’s Academy Awards to discover whether five Oscar-winning actors can achieve one of the rarest of Hollywood distinctions.\n\nIn the 91 previous award presentations, only seven actors and three actresses have won at least one competitive acting Oscar AND have either starred or co-starred in three movies that won the Best Picture award. Of this elite group of 10, only three have received more than one acting Oscar: Dustin Hoffman (two) and Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson (three each).\n\nBut the nominations this time represent an opportunity for at least one of five established Oscar winners to either meet this standard or set a new standard. In line for this honor are two nominees — Al Pacino and Leonardo DiCaprio — and three un-nominated former winners — Streep, Robert De Niro and Colin Firth.\n\nFor readers who think appearing in at least three Best Pictures isn’t much of a heavy lift for stars with mantels filled with statuettes, try answering this question:\n\nHow many Best Pictures have featured these five multiple Oscar winners: Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda and Denzel Washington?\n\nAnswer: None of them has ever been featured in a Best Picture winner, even though they accumulated an astounding 12 competitive acting Oscars.\n\nIf that answer seems surprising, you might want to brush up on Hollywood history by taking our Oscar Quiz at the end of this column. By attempting to answer 10 multiple-choice questions, you might gain some insight into how past nominees found their way to victory under conditions similar to those facing current nominees.\n\nFor now, here are how these five former Oscar winners got their chance to add a rare Academy Award distinction to their resumes:\n\nRobert De Niro | “The Irishman” and “Joker”\n\nThis multiple Oscar winner (for “The Godfather Part II” and “Raging Bull”) isn’t nominated for acting in either of these movies, although each film is vying for the Best Picture award. If either one wins, De Niro would become the fourth multiple-Oscar winner to be featured in three Best Pictures by virtue of his earlier starring roles.\n\nAl Pacino | “The Irishman” and “Once Upon a Time &mldr; in Hollywood”\n\nBy winning a second Oscar — as Best Supporting Actor for playing Jimmy Hoffa in “The Irishman” — Pacino would also join this elite group, but only if either one of his two movies wins the Best Picture award. (He has a cameo in “Once Upon a Time.”) Even if he fails to win the supporting-role Oscar and “Irishman” loses to “Once Upon a Time,” he would still become one of only 11 Oscar winners to appear in three Best Pictures by virtue of his roles as Michael Corleone in “The Godfather” and “The Godfather Part II.”\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio | “Once Upon a Time&mldr; in Hollywood”\n\nIf his movie wins for Best Picture and he captures his second Best Leading Actor award, DiCaprio would become the latest multiple-Oscar winner to join Streep, Nicholson and Hoffman by virtue of his roles in two earlier Best Pictures: “Titanic” and “The Departed.” And like Pacino, a loss in the acting category would still rank him with seven other single-Oscar winners featured in Best Pictures.\n\nMeryl Streep | “Little Women”\n\nAlthough she was not nominated, Streep’s role in this movie would make her the only multiple-Oscar-winning actress to appear in four Best Pictures by virtue of her three earlier winners: “The Deer Hunter,” “Kramer vs. Kramer” and “Out of Africa.” She won acting Oscars for “Kramer,” “Sophie’s Choice” and “The Iron Lady.”\n\nColin Firth | “1917”\n\nAlthough he also is not nominated, Firth’s role in this film would make him the only Oscar-winning actor to appear in four Best Pictures by virtue of his roles in three earlier winners: “Shakespeare in Love,” “The English Patient” and “The King’s Speech,” for which he won the Best Leading Actor award.\n\nAnswers are listed below:\n\nEntertainment: Go see 1970 hit 'Love Story,' back in theaters this February, and never say you're sorry\n\nBeckerman: The cult of 'Cats': Is this the next 'Rocky Horror'?\n\nOscar quiz answers\n\n(Dates cited refer to the years in which the movies were released, not the years of the Oscar presentations.)\n\n1. F. All of the Above. All five appeared in three Best Pictures. So did Clark Gable, who was the first to achieve this milestone.\n\n2. E. King Henry II played by Peter O’Toole in “Becket” and “The Lion in Winter”\n\n3. B. Jessica Lange. She won a Best Supporting Actress award for “Tootsie” (1982) but lost the Best Actress Oscar for “Frances” to Meryl Streep in “Sophie’s Choice.” The other nominees were unsuccessful in both categories. Except Weaver, however, the remaining three managed to win Oscars in later years.\n\n4. C. Maximilian Schell in “Judgment at Nuremburg.”\n\n5. D. \"The Color Purple.\"\n\n6. B. “Amélie” (2001). It lost the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar to “No Man’s Land,” the Bosnia/Herzegovina entrant. “Amélie’s” nominations for Screenplay, Art & Set Direction, Sound and Cinematography failed to produce any Oscars.\n\n7. G. Crosby, Tracy and Fitzgerald. Crosby won the Best Actor Oscar for playing Father Charles “Chuck” O’Malley in “Going My Way” (1944) and was nominated for the same role in “The Bells of St. Mary\" (1945). Fitzgerald won the Supporting Actor Oscar for playing the older Father Fitzgibbon in “Going My Way” but lost the Best Oscar prize to Crosby (a double nomination that’s no longer permitted). Tracy was nominated for Best Actor for playing Father Tim Mullin in “San Francisco” (1936), and he won the award for his portrayal of Father Edward Flanagan in “Boys Town” (1938).\n\n8. D. \"Birdman.\"\n\n9. B. “The Racket” (1928). The silent film starring Thomas Meighan as an honest detective, was remade in 1951 starring Robert Mitchum. Both movies were produced by Howard Hughes. “On the Waterfront” (1954) was the first mob movie to win for Best Picture.\n\n10. D. Chester Morris. He was given a Best Actor nomination for playing gang leader Chick Williams in “Alibi,” a 1929 talkie that was nominated for what was then called Outstanding Picture. Morris lost to Warner Baxter in “Old Arizona.” (It may be hard for some to believe, but frequent tough guy Edward G. Robinson — listed in “C” in Question 10 — was never nominated for a competitive Oscar.)"
