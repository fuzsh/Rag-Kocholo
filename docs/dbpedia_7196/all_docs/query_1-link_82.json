        "text": "Send us a Text Message.Victor McLaglen, a member of John Ford's stock company, won his Oscar for his performance in the memorable movie, THE INFORMER. In this episode, I speak about McLaglen's globe-trotting life and career, which includes time as a muscleman and crossing paths with some historical personages.\n\nSend us a Text Message.Clark Gable's Oscar win for IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT made him the biggest male movie star of the 1930's. An avatar of masculinity, he showed a warmer, funnier side of his personality in the movie, which became a huge, word-of-mouth hit. In this episode, we'll hear about Gable's life and career and the women who helped him and loved him along the way.\n\nSend us a Text Message.In Oscar's sixth year, the Best Actor award went to a brilliant over-actor, Charles Laughton for the surprisingly comic THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII. Despite struggles with self-esteem and his sexual orientation, Laughton worked for decades for directors like Lean, Kubrick, and Hitchcock. And he may be best remembered for a movie that he didn't star in. Learn all about him in the latest episode.\n\nSend us a Text Message.At the fifth Academy Awards, a tie occurred in the Best Actor category for the first and only time. In this episode, we hear about Wallace Beery as THE CHAMP and his miserable disposition, and Fredric March's watershed performance in the DR. JECKYLL AND MR. HYDE.\n\nSend us a Text Message.The fourth Best Actor winner was Lionel Barrymore, a member of an acting dynasty that extends from the early 19th century to the present. Barrymore won for his work in A FREE SOUL. In this episode, I look at Barrymore's performance and career, as well as the year's contest and why it's connected to peanut butter.\n\nSend us a Text Message.George Arliss, who acted in the grand tradition of 19th century theater, won an Oscar for DISRAELI. Arliss's victory was marked by a number of firsts. We'll discuss his performance, his competition, and many other aspects of his career."
