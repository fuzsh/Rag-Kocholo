        "text": "I'm a bit of a history buff. I love times past, the pathways of human endeavour and all that sort of thing, to a degree that one might describe as pathological. Seriously. If one were to calculate how much time I've spent fantasizing about having a time machine, I think the result may not be a flattering one. So, it should go without saying that I love historical films. The Prisoner of Shark Island is such a film, and quite right up my alley.\n\nLoosely based on real events, the setting is the immediate end of the war between the states. Lincoln and his people have kept the union intact, while also shattering the slavery tradition in the south forever (one certainly hopes). In retaliation, Lincoln is assassinated by John Wilkes Boothe; our film begins in this way. Boothe, as we know, was injured in his escape, and he and his co-conspirator are trying to make their getaway with him in this condition, on horseback, at 5a.m., in torrential rain.\n\nNot a good omen, certainly!\n\nThey find their way to the home of a southern doctor, Dr. Samuel Mudd, played by Warner Baxter. Dr. Mudd is a character that wouldn't get much play these days, as he was a slave owner and a southerner, but, as presented, was a fair and decent chap. In this spirit he fixes Boothe's leg, and Boothe goes off into the night...but the identity of Lincoln's assassin was not known to the doctor. later that day Boothe's pursuers arrive, and they arrest him, the fervor of righteous justice blinding them to his innocence.\n\nHis trial goes in a similar fashion. The nation had no sympathy for supporters of the assassination at that time, and in reality, a number of regular people were lynched across the country for expressing that view. Although he escaped the hanging that was the punisment of the direct conspirators, the doctor is put into a brutal prison on an island in the Dry Tortugas (off the tip of Florida, now a national park), plagued by the prerequisite dastardly guard (played so well by John Carradine), consumed by that doomed feeling that would certainly accompany such an injustice. It will be his own dignity and medical knowledge that will help him to survive.\n\nWill his lovely wife find a way to get him released, or will he have to find his own escape?\n\nI loved this film. Warner Baxter was so incredibly multi-layered, and I'm more and more becoming a fan of his stuff. He's very good in this; he's both noble and irritable, and the fact that he was a slave holder and a confederate don't dull my sympathy for his character. After watching him as the Cisco Kid relatively recently (reviewed HERE), as well as his turn in the Crime Doctor series, he has become one of those names that I'm starting to keep an eye out for, more and more. John Carradine was also great in this, being his usual dastardly self, and yet his humanity was not at all in question throughout. The rest of the cast was quite fine, and the direction and staging was perfect and precise; everything was worth looking at, and the story had no fluff or flab. One can attribute these qualities to the sure hand of director John Ford, who consistently amazes me with his projects.\n\nThe 1930's. For so long they've been seen as the imperfect precursor to the 40's; that primitive period between the golden decade of silent film, and the perfected era during WWII. I so disagree. The 30's were a great and wild time, full of imagination and zip! The pulp fiction vibe, the radio drama vibe, tinges of classic novels, with silent-era colour and drama. The Prisoner of Shark Island has all that and more.\n\nFor an added bonus, Dr. Mudd was played on the radio by Gary Cooper in Lux Radio Theater's production of the story. It's highly enjoyable, and just as well produced. It has the interesting addition of the then-elderly daughter of the real Samuel Mudd, sharing an anecdote of her father's life. Both the film and the otr audio are well worth seeking out, in both cases!\n\n\"Cisco Kid was a friend of mine\" ~ The Chicano band WAR ~ song: 'Cisco Kid'\n\nAlong with the lyrics of the funky song mentioned above, most people today only know the southwestern hero character The Cisco Kid from the popular 50's television series starring Duncan Renaldo; in truth, the character of The Cisco Kid has a longer and broader history. I've been a fan of the show for most of my life (Cisco is on my list of hero ideals), but only in the last decade or so did I realise how many films, radio shows, comic books featured Cisco.\n\nThe Cisco Kid had his origins in the short story The Caballero's Way, by the mustachioed writer William Sydney Porter, better known by his pen name, O. Henry. This was a different Cisco Kid from the one that we've all come to know and love; he was a wild killer, wanted and hunted from all quarters. Here's how Cisco was introduced to the world:\n\nThe Cisco Kid had killed six men in more or less fair scrimmages, had murdered twice as many (mostly Mexicans), and had winged a larger number whom he modestly forbore to count. Therefore a woman loved him.\n\n...and here's another bit:\n\nHe killed for the love of it—because he was quick-tempered— to avoid arrest—for his own amusement—any reason that came to his mind would suffice.\n\nInteresting, wot? As I first read those lines, I tried to imagine the suave and gentle Duncan Renaldo murdering people; it did not compute. \"Winging\" and \"scrimmaging\" are very much a part of the character that I know, but the murdering part had been weeded out of my mind by subsequent portrayals of this personal hero of mine, not only by Renaldo, but also by Cesar Romero and Gilbert Roland. I found it interesting, the contrast between the two Ciscos, and I wondered where the divide between the two began. The idea that a Latin American character existed as an American icon in the first half of the 20th century is a miracle in itself (along with the most famous of them all, Johnston McCulley's Zorro), but a foreign killer (with brown skin) being transformed into a dashing hero is fascinating. Especially in these days of overblown southern border issues and illegal immigration concerns. On the other hand, there have been more Hispanic-American action films of the last few decades, including Robert Rodriguez' blood-fest, Machete, and the earlier El Mariachi. I'm certain that the original Cisco Kid would not be out of place in those, but the Cisco Kid as an Oscar winner in 1930? Both amazing and seemingly unlikely.\n\nWarner Baxter\n\nReleased in 1929, the film In Old Arizona is interesting on so many levels. It is apparently the first sound film to be made outdoors, and the first major western to have sound. It stars the charming actor Warner Baxter as a very dashing Cisco Kid. Apparently the famed actor & director Raoul Walsh was slated for the role, but the auto accident that gave him his characteristic eye patch made it impossible. Luckily, Batxer was chosen, and was quite as perfect a choice as a non-hispanic actor could be. I have mixed feelings on that subject. It seems as if choosing an ethnically-correct actor would be best, but I love my Mr. Moto films, and the Warner Oland Charlie Chan movies are staples in my viewing experience. I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else in those parts. In any case, Duncan Reynaldo was actually Romanian-American, so in the end, it's the acting that matters to me. That, and the respect given the character by the filmmaker and the script. In Old Arizona has these things in spades.\n\nBaxter was a more rakish Cisco than Renaldo, which fits the film, as he's an actual bandit, versus Renaldo's Cisco, who is basically a Mexicanised Hopalong Cassidy. It's a very interesting film, structure-wise, as well. The story wanders around more than a later film would; I think that some modern film-watchers might find it a bit too loose. Silent movie people will really enjoy it, I think. I thought it was a great example of early western drama. Also, being one of the first talkie westerns, in singing a couple of charming songs in the picture, Baxter may also be the first singing gunslinger. I was surprised by how pleasant a voice he had. I'm a big fan of his Crime Doctor films, so to hear his musical side was a treat for me. At the time of the film's release, these various elements swirled together in such a pleasant way as to garner five nominations in the second-ever Academy Awards, with Baxter winning in the category of best actor! As the Cisco Kid!\n\nIn the end, the reason that I chose The Cisco Kid (and in turn the film itself) as a good representative of Hispanic culture in America, is the very notoriety of the character. So many of my Mexican-American friends have talked about how Cisco was the only character on TV that shared their background, and in fact, that song by WAR was created out of the same feeling; to see their \"one of us\" in the media was important for so many who grew up in the mid 20th Century. To have him be idolised by the mainstream was big-time stuff. To have that same Latino character win the most important film award must have felt incredible, especially in the late 1920's, when racism against Latinos was pretty strong in southwestern America.\n\nI highly suggest that film fans seek it out; it's a fun, important movie, and Warner Baxter fans will love to see him as Cisco!\n\nA few images of the various Cisco Kids...including the unfortunate one on the end...\n\n(click image to enlarge, then use the arrow keys ← → to change images )"
