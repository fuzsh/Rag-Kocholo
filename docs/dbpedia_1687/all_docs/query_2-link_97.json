The aim was to try to get Billy McNeill fully fit for the game. Hunter also needed some treatment to a back injury. Jimmy Johnstone and Bobby Lennox did not travel through injury and nor did new signing Jimmy Bone.\n\nBilly McNeill was declared fit but Ally Hunter was more critical and eventually Evan Williams was preferred. It was his first game in over a year. Sadly, it was to be his last for Celtic.Hunter had so far played in every game this season.\n\nCeltic return to Basle for the third time after previous games in 1963 and 1969.The game had been brought forward by a week to avoid the carnival period in Basle.\n\n7pm kick off time. Celtic had not played under floodlights since back in November.\n\nBasle were in their winter break.\n\nDalglish scores Celtic's 100th European goal.\n\nFuture Borussia Dortmund manager Ottmar Hitzfeld scored for Basle.\n\nScotland under 23's beat Wales 3-0 at Pittiodrie on the same day. Celtic players were excused as they were on Euro duty.\n\nOn the following day the nation went to the polling booths. The result was indecisive with Labour gaining the most seats but not enough for a conclusive majority. It looked like another election would be needed.\n\nReview\n\nJock Stein said before the game that Celtic would attack and he was true to his word. Stein wanted the tie finished in the first leg but it did not work out the way he wanted.\n\nCeltic started brightly and Wilson scored a tremendous volley from Brogan's deep cross in 20 minutes they had the game under total control as Basle had not yet threatened. However the roof fell in when Basle scored twice in two minutes before half time when Williams allowed Hitzfeld's shot to slip under him and Odermatt then scored with a powerful 30 yard free kick.\n\nOdermatt had been rated at 40% fitness before the match but he was now the game's most influential player. McNeill was also a doubt and played on bravely after receiving an eye injury but looked limited in what he could do.\n\nWilson was Celtic's best player and went close twice to equalising with great efforts at goal before half time.\n\nCeltic looked more organised in the second half and Dalglish cooly scored with a flick after great build up play by McGrain down the right flank.\n\nWilliams' misery was rounded off in 63 minutes when his poor kick out resulted in Connelly giving away a penalty which Hitzfeld converted. Williams then slightly redeemed himself with a fine save from a Mundschen header late on.\n\nEven allowing for their blunders Celtic were now strong favourites to reach the semi finals.\n\nTeams\n\nBasle:\n\nLaufenberger, Munschin, Fischli, Demarmels, Stohler, Hasler, Odermatt (Wampfler), Rahmen, Hitzfeld, Balmer, Wenger (Tanner).\n\nGoals: Hitzfeld 2 (28 63 pen), Odermatt (30)\n\nCeltic:\n\nWilliams, McGrain, Brogan, Connelly, McNeill, Hay, Hood, Murray, Deans (Callaghan 60), Dalglish, Wilson.
