But he is also able to run onto the defender with the ball on his feet. He feels most comfortable within the opponent‚Äôs 18 yard box, though. This is where he shines as he has a nose for the right movement. He also tries to get a part of his body onto every ball played into the box. He has the will to score goals and he shows it often. But that‚Äôs not everything. Don‚Äôt let him shoot from outside the box. He scored a wonder goal against FC Zurich this season, where he smashed the ball into the net from 35 yards out. Technically he‚Äôs good, with the occasional miscontrol when running with the ball, and he has decent speed. He excels with his physicality though.
