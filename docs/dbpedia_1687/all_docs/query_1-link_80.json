        "text": "Here is a look at the eight new additions.\n\nFilip Jorgensen\n\nThe now-former Villarreal goalkeeper joined the Blues this week, making his first appearance on Wednesday against Club América.\n\nIt seems that some Chelsea fans may be questioning the addition of the Denmark international while already having Robert Sánchez, Djordje Petrovic, Gabriel Sloina, and the current youngsters who are on tour in America.\n\nHowever, Chelsea's decision to sign the 22-year-old shot-stopper makes sense, given the stats and data used here by Squawka, which compare Jörgensen to his London counterparts.\n\nCaleb Wiley\n\nFew people know about the American fullback. After joining from Atlanta United, the 19-year-old will be sent to Strasbourg on loan to continue his development after the Olympics.\n\nDuring his time at Atlanta, Caleb Wiley impressed, registering six goals and six assists across 77 games.\n\nIt makes sense to the Blues to sign the American. The futures ofBen Chilwell and Marc Cucurella are in doubt, so it makes sense to see why the US international has been brought in to develop a year in Europe before potentially being added to the squad come the 2025/26 season.\n\nRenato Veiga\n\nAfter pulling out of the race to signRiccardo Calafiori, Chelsea turned their attention elsewhere, moving discreetly and quietly and finding Renato Veiga.\n\nWhat makes this signing interesting is that the versatile defender was the replacement for Calafiori when he was at Basel.\n\nThe 21-year-old has played for Portugal at all youth levels and has captained the under-21s.\n\nWhat makes the £12m signing interesting is his versatility. Although he is a midfielder by trade, he can also play in the back line as a left-back or a central defender.\n\nThis makes Veiga perfect for Enzo Maresca. With his ability on the ball and his six foot three build, he adds height to a Chelsea team, which was needed, according to former Blues manager Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nA look into his last season at FC Basel:\n\nPer 90 against Swiss League midfielders, Veiga finished first in the following categories: Long passes, progressive passes, passes into the final third, average pass length and blocked shots.\n\nThe Sporting CP Academy graduate finished second in forward passes and through passes. He is certainly a player who could well and truly be a bargain for the West Londoners.\n\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall\n\nThe second-oldest player to join the two-time Champions League winners this summer.\n\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall comes into this Chelsea team with plenty of experience. The Englishman has experienced the highs and lows in football with both relegation and promotion whilst at Leicester City.\n\nThis signing is interesting because he is one of the few players who has played for Enzo Maresca before and knows his system inside out. With this experience, he will be a crucial boost and an addition to a squad that needs leaders.\n\nThe player he is most likely replacing at Chelsea is Conor Gallagher, who is potentially on his way out of the club. Here is a comparison on Squawka between the two players this season.\n\nHowever, to take into consideration, the now-former Leicester City man was in a high-flying team with a squad worth £263m in the Championship, which made them the second most expensive squad compared toSouthampton, which was worth a staggering £320m.\n\nFurthermore, with the way Enzo Maresca will be playing football at Chelsea this season, a signing like Dewsbury-Hall makes sense for all parties.\n\nFor £30m, it could be a smart buy for Chelsea, with the midfielder just entering his prime.\n\nMarc Guiu\n\nA name that surprised many, Marc Guiu could be a player who exceeds expectations at Chelsea this season.\n\nThe La Masia graduate made his first appearance forBarcelona last season from the bench. He scored with his first touch against Athletic Club, being the hero in a 1-0 victory.\n\nUnfortunately, minutes did not arrive for the youngster after that. Still, with his small release clause of £6.6m, the Blues made sure to trigger it.\n\nSo far, Guiu has impressed in the USA pre-season tour, leading the line in every game. The Spaniard's work rate and effort has caught the eyes of many.\n\nFurthermore, in the games against Wrexham, Celtic, and Club América, his runs and ability to hold up play and link with others have surprised many.\n\nHaving a build of six foot two, Guiu knows how to utilise his body well, and getting his first goal for the Blues against the Mexican giants will only give the 18-year-old more confidence.\n\nOmari Kellyman\n\nAnother signing that caught many off guard was Omari Kellyman, who joined the Blues for a fee of £19m. Despite only making six first-team appearances for Aston Villa, Kellyman's arrival raised questions about why Chelsea spent so much on someone with very little first-team experience.\n\nHowever, like many of Chelsea's signings, age and experience should be taken with a pinch of salt. Many of them have yet to be given the first-team platform to show their ability, and Kellyman is one of those players.\n\nHaving played with the Aston Villa Under-21s last season, the attacking midfielder had a strong campaign, netting ten goals and one assist.\n\nRecovering from an injury at the end of last season with Villa, Chelsea will have to wait and see what Kellyman produces. However, he remains a player with high potential who could surprise many.\n\nEstêvão Willian\n\nTipped to be a future genius, Estêvão Willian is one of Brazil's most exciting talents.\n\nThe 17-year-old will join the Blues next season alongside Kendry Paez, another name that has caught the eye of football clubs worldwide.\n\nThe forward is tipped to be even better than former teammate Endrick.\n\n\"Trust me, this boy is something different. Estêvão is just something I've never seen in my career,\" said Palmeiras boss Abel Ferreira.\n\nIn the Brasileiro Serie A season, Estêvão scored five goals and picked up four assists while starting just 14 game. He has been one of the best creators in the league and is vital to the Palmeiras attack.\n\nCosting Chelsea £29.5m, the Blues will be eagerly waiting for his arrival next season. According to Fabrizio Romano, he will join the first-team immediately, with no planned loan.\n\nThis is one of the many talents Chelsea fans can be excited about.\n\nTosin Adarabioyo\n\nThe 26-year-old is the oldest summer signing so far for the former Club World Cup winners, with the centre-half graduating from the Manchester City academy. Adarabioyo is someone that Chelsea needed with the departure of Thiago Silva.\n\nAlready showing signs of leadership in pre-season, the former Fulham man has been consistent. So far, his calm authority on the ball and ability to read the game has been two standout attributes.\n\nPlaying in the centre of a back three against Club América, it was clear why Chelsea signed him on a free transfer.\n\nIt is interesting to see how Adarabioyo compares to the defenders with whom he is looking to compete with this season, such as Levi Colwill, Benoit Badiashile, and Axel Disasi.\n\nMaking just 25 appearances last season and scoring two, the six foot five defender will be a perfect player on set pieces this season under new set piece coach Bernardo Cueva, who joined from Brentford this summer."
