        "text": "A local journalist at Brendan Rodgers’ press conference described Liverpool’s last appearance in Basel as “a legendary night for Swiss football”. Steven Gerrard would beg to differ. The 12th of November 2002 will never rate highly in the Liverpool captain’s legend but the formative experience of that night helps explain his enduring influence almost 12 years on.\n\nThe night in question saw Christian Gross’ team race into a three-goal lead inside 29 minutes, Liverpool storm back to draw 3-3, but exit the Champions League group stage having failed to clinch the win they required in Basel.\n\nGerrard, replaced by Salif Diao at half-time and watching the recovery while in torment, would have to wait to play a starring role in a three-goal European fightback.\n\nLiverpool’s soon-to-be captain was subject to scathing public criticism from Gérard Houllier the following day, the manager accusing Gerrard of being distracted by the excesses of stardom when the truth, hidden by the player from Houllier, was that his parents’ divorce was the cause. Football had taken a back-seat in the midfielder’s life but the lessons of that humiliating Champions League trip were learned. Liverpool, and now Rodgers, continue to reap the benefit.\n\n“I spoke to Steven about it a few weeks ago. It was an experience that helped his career,” said the Liverpool manager before his side’s second outing in Group B. “He was brought off at half-time and there was the aftermath. He obviously had a fantastic relationship with Gérard Houllier and, as a young player at that level, he learned very early on you need to perform and you need to prepare. He played in the first half of that game and speaking to him I know he benefited from the experience.”\n\nNowadays for Gerrard it is about leading Rodgers’ young Liverpool team while subject to the unforgiving scrutiny that falls on a 34-year-old who has been top of the pile for so long. A bad performance at West Ham United and it is time to call it a day. Another good one in Saturday’s Merseyside derby against Everton and, as the cupped-ear celebration that followed his goal indicated, his importance has to be recognised again. There appears no middle-ground with Gerrard outside Liverpool. Inside, Rodgers does not hide his appreciation for a player in the final year of his contract and who he would like to stick around for a good while yet.\n\n“It is something we are looking at as a club and with him and how he feels,” said Rodgers. “He is still in a good physical condition, 34 years old, never needs a day’s rest, and we are talking about a genuine superstar, a world-class player consistently for so many years. He will play and prepare himself right the way through to the very end. When he still strikes a ball there are not many like him, both in his passing and his shooting. It is something to respect and behold at the moment. Every football person knows the qualities and influence he still has and he is a real catalyst for everything the team has done in the last 18 months.”\n\nGerrard will make his 126th European appearance for Liverpool in Basel, the Swiss champions beaten 5-1 by Real Madrid in their opening game. He has scored a club record 40 European goals in that time, lifted the Champions League after the three-goal comeback that really counted for Liverpool in 2005, and remains the man his team-mates will look to before they step out at the always testing St Jakob Park.\n\nRodgers said: “The players, especially the younger players, look at how calm Stevie is and they know he has been at the level before and gone right the way through and won this tournament. They can draw inspiration from that.\n\n“He is calm whether it is the Champions League or a league game. His focus is very much the same. Even against Basel, when the atmosphere is good and you need a calm head to dictate the tempo of a game, there are not many better than him in world football.\n\n“He is right in the thick of it. That is the position I have put him in so that he can orchestrate the team. That is something he has done magnificently and the players respond to that.”"
