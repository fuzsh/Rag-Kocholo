        "text": "Take a look back at our live commentary as Liverpool slumped to a 1-0 defeat to Basel.\n\nBrendan Rodgers’ side made an unconvincing start to life back among European football’s elite when edging out Bulgarian side Ludogorets 2-1 at Anfield on Matchday One.\n\nA vast improvement will be required if they are to take anything from a trip to Switzerland, with Basel having fared admirably against English opposition in recent times.\n\nThe Swiss champions took maximum points off Chelsea in last season’s competition, prevailing 2-1 at Stamford Bridge and 1-0 on home soil.\n\nBasel will also recall holding Liverpool to two draws the last time they met in the Champions League group stage back in 2002/03.\n\nA 3-3 stalemate on Merseyside, as the hosts hit back from three goals down, was not enough to see the Reds pip their continental rivals to a place in the last-16.\n\nA 5-1 mauling at the hands of holders Real Madrid a fortnight ago suggests Paulo Sousa’s side may not be as strong as they once were, but they remain a formidable proposition at St Jakob Park.\n\nLiverpool will be hoping that there are weaknesses to be exploited, though, as their victory over Ludogorets remains their only success in their last five outings in all competitions.\n\nA spark is required from somewhere, with an epic Capital One Cup contest with Middlesbrough, which ended 14-13 on penalties, and a tense derby date with Everton sapping important early-season energy.\n\nTeam news\n\nStriker Daniel Sturridge has not made Liverpool's squad after failing to recover from a thigh strain.\n\nThe England international has missed five matches with the problem and while he is edging closer to a return he will not be risked on Wednesday.\n\nDefender Mamadou Sakho has also not travelled to Switzerland.\n\nThe France international centre-back stormed out of Anfield on Saturday after not being selected for the match-day squad to face Everton, although he subsequently issued an apology.\n\nForward Lazar Markovic is available after serving a suspension in the Reds' opening game.\n\nMarcelo Diaz will sit out the second game of a three-match ban following his dismissal in Basel's Europa League quarter-final second leg tie against Valencia last season.\n\nBasel coach Sousa, who knows all about British football from his time in charge of Queens Park Rangers Swansea City and Leicester City, is hoping his side can extend their hoodoo over Premier League clubs by beating Liverpool.\n\nIn the last three years, the Swiss side have beaten Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United in European competition, and adding Rodgers' Reds to that list would be an achievement to match those, according to the Portuguese."
