        "text": "Before this game, the Reds have played 180 fixtures in the European Cup, with 102 victories, 38 draws and 40 defeats.\n\nLiverpool have played against Swiss opponents 11 times, winning six and losing twice; however, they have never beaten Basel in three previous attempts, drawing twice and losing once.\n\nAt Anfield against Swiss clubs, meanwhile, the Reds have won three and drawn two of five games, scoring 14 times and conceding six, never failing to hit the target.\n\nHistory could be made this evening if Brendan Rodgers' side achieve progression, as never before have Liverpool reached the knockout rounds of the Champions League when they have automatically qualified for the group stage.\n\nThe Reds could become only the seventh team in Champions League history to progress from the first group stage with seven points, as would Basel with a draw. The last was Stuttgart in 2009-10, while only one English club - Newcastle United in 2002-03 - has come from such a position to qualify at that stage of the competition.\n\nWatch the video here Â»\n\nOnly Simon Mignolet has started all five of the Reds' European games this season, although Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling have appeared in all.\n\nThe skipper is in line to play his 130th European match for Liverpool - he has 40 goals. Midfield colleague Lucas Leiva could become the 20th player to reach the milestone of 50 European games for Liverpool.\n\nLiverpool have conceded only one goal in their past three fixtures, their meanest run since February.\n\nBasel's record in European Cup football currently shows 91 encounters, with 39 victories, 17 draws and 35 defeats for the Swiss outfit.\n\nThey have won the Swiss league title in each of the last five seasons, on nine occasions in the last 13 years and 17 times in total. They have also lifted the Swiss Cup 11 times, with the most recent success coming in 2012.\n\nTheir coach, Paulo Sousa, has faced Rodgers three times as a manager. In November 2008, his first game in charge of Queens Park Rangers saw his team lose 3-0 at home to Watford. In August 2009, he was Swansea City manager as his team drew 0-0 with Reading, and then oversaw Basel's win in October."
