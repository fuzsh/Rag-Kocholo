        "text": "About\n\nUsing a state-of-the-art data assimilation system and surface pressure observations, the NOAA-CIRES-DOE Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project has generated a four-dimensional global atmospheric dataset of weather spanning 1836 to 2015 to place current atmospheric circulation patterns into a historical perspective.\n\n20th Century Reanalysis and PSL\n\nFour-dimensional historic weather reconstructions, or reanalyses, provide a crucial instrument-based link between long paleoclimate reconstructions and climate model forecasts. But until recently, the earliest reanalyses began with the year 1948, leaving out many important 20th century climate events, such as the 1930’s Dust Bowl.\n\nTo expand the coverage of global gridded reanalyses, the 20th Century Reanalysis Project is an effort led by NOAA's Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL) and CIRES at the University of Colorado, supported by the Department of Energy, to produce reanalysis datasets spanning the entire 20th century and much of the 19th century. These reanalyses assimilate only surface observations of synoptic pressure into NOAA’s Global Forecast System and prescribe sea surface temperature and sea ice distribution in order to estimate e.g., temperature, pressure, winds, moisture, solar radiation and clouds, from the surface to the top of the atmosphere throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n20CR uses an ensemble filter data assimilation method which directly estimates the most likely state of the global atmosphere for each three-hour period, and also estimates uncertainty in that analysis. The most recent version of this reanalysis, V3, provides 8-times daily estimates of global tropospheric variability across 75 km grids, spanning 1836 to 2015 (with an experimental extension from 1806 to 1835.) There are three previous versions of the reanalysis: V1, V2, and V2c.\n\nThe project has greatly benefited from international cooperation under the Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth (ACRE) initiative, which undertakes and facilitates the recovery of historical instrumental surface terrestrial and marine global weather observations to underpin 4D weather reconstructions spanning the last 200 to 250 years. Additional support has been provided by the Global Climate Observing System and the World Climate Research Programme.\n\nVersion 3 covers 1836-2015 Available from PSL\n\nVersion V2c covers 1851-2012 (experimental 2013-2014 extension) Available from PSL\n\nVersion V2 covers 1871-2012 Available from PSL\n\nVersion V1 covers 1908-1958 Available from NCAR\n\nRecreating the Great California Flood of 1862 — A Case Study\n\nBackground\n\n9 December 1861 – 20 January 1962 — The Great Flood of 1862 dropped a record-setting amount of rain along the U.S. West Coast from December 1861 through January 1862. While the flooding affected Washington and Oregon, California was hit especially hard. San Francisco and Sacramento, CA recorded 34 and 37 inches of rain respectively over the course of two months. The flooding was exacerbated by warm rainfall in the mountains, causing significant snow melt to flow into communities. Sacramento's streets and sidewalks were under water, and farms within the Central Valley were completely flooded. This prompted Sacramento to improve their levee system and begin a significant effort to raise the city above flood level. Ultimately, the floods were estimated to have cost at least 4,000 lives and $50-100 million (approximately $3 billion today). Recently, scientists have hypothesized that these floods were not due to an El Niño event, but rather the result of several atmospheric rivers repeatedly aiming at California.(References: Wikipedia and \"California Washed Away: The Great Flood of 1862\")\n\nReconstruction of Conditions\n\nThis four-panel plot shows weather conditions during the Great Flood of 1862, as reconstructed by the NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20th Century Reanalysis Version 3. Panel (a) includes the best estimate of sea level pressure (contours), observation locations (filled circles), and sea level pressure confidence (shading); Panel (b) includes the best estimate for geopotential heights at 500 hPa (a variable commonly used by forecasters to understand large-scale weather patterns) and its confidence field; Panel (c) shows the best estimate for 2m air temperatures; and Panel (d) shows the best estimate for precipitation accumulated over 6 hours prior to 12Z (4am PST) on 27 December 1861. “Confidence” measures uncertainty in the best estimate: smaller values refer to less confidence (more uncertainty) and higher values refer to more confidence (less uncertainty).
