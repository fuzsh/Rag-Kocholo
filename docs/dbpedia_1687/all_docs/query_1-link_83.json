        "text": "Arsenal have completed the signing of defender Riccardo Calafiori from Bologna on a long-term contract.\n\nThe 22-year-old will wear the No 33 shirt and becomes Arsenal’s third signing of the summer, after 18-year-old goalkeeper Lucas Nygaard arrived from FC Nordsjaelland and David Raya was signed on a permanent transfer from Brentford.\n\nCalafiori, who enjoyed an incredible 2023/24 breakthrough season, played a crucial role in Bologna’s UEFA Champions League qualification for the first time in 60 years.\n\n“Riccardo is a big personality and character, with specific skills which will make us stronger as we push to win major trophies. He has already shown great development in recent seasons with his performances for both Bologna and Italy, with his progression and development in the past year being really impressive,” manager Mikel Arteta said on the club's website.\n\n“We’re looking forward to working with Riccardo, integrating him into the squad, and supporting him in the years to come.”\n\nWho is Riccardo Calafiori?\n\nBorn in Rome, Calafiori is a product of the Roma academy and made his professional debut for the club in a 3-1 win against Juventus in August 2020.\n\nCalafiori was deployed as a left-back during his time with Roma and played 18 times for them before being loaned to Genoa in January 2022. He was then sold to Basel later that summer.\n\nIt was during his time at the Swiss club that he switched to a new role as a centre-back, shining in his natural position and earning a return back to Serie A in 2023/24 with Bologna.\n\nCalafiori’s performances earned him a call-up for Italy's Euro 2024 squad, and he made his international debut less than two weeks before the tournament began.\n\nHis experience playing as both a centre-back and left-back has established Calafiori as a versatile defender.\n\nHe is also very comfortable in possession and registered five assists for Bologna last season, the joint-fourth best among defenders in Serie A.\n\nSee: 15 things you need to know about Calafiori\n\nCalafiori's ability on the ball was highlighted with his role in Italy's late equaliser in their 1-1 draw with Croatia to send them through to the Euro 2024 knockout stages.\n\nWhen might Calafiori be in action for Arsenal?\n\nArsenal continue their pre-season preparations against Liverpool on 1 August. They start their Premier League campaign at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday 17 August."
