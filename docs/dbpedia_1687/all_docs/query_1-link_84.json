        "text": "Mohamed Salah kick-started the scoring for Liverpool on Wednesday, leaving Arsenal stunned with a stunning solo goal in Philadelphia.\n\nHarvey Elliott masterfully threaded a pass to Salah down the right wing, and the Egyptian effortlessly outpaced Oleksandr Zinchenko while fending off both Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior. Salah then coolly slotted his shot under Arsenal's goalkeeper Karl Hein, showcasing to the packed US crowd why he's ranked among the world's top players.\n\nInside Lincoln Financial Field, the home turf of NFL team Philadelphia Eagles, Liverpool was clearly the crowd favorite with Arsenal fans being outnumbered. However, the US-based Reds might have had some pre-game jitters as Salah seemed off-target during the warm-ups.\n\nThe 32-year-old was unusually off the mark during shooting drills, sending most of his shots over the bar or wide of the goal. Salah appeared visibly frustrated, but when it mattered most, things were very different and he delivered as always.\n\nREAD MORE: Caiomhin Kelleher narrowly avoids embarrassing Liverpool moment in Arsenal friendly\n\nREAD MORE: Riccardo Calafiori denied debut vs Liverpool after Arsenal transfer\n\nThis encapsulates Salah's tenure at Liverpool, consistently making an impact on games even when not performing at his peak. His lightning-fast run was classic Salah, and new head coach Arne Slot will be hoping that the winger maintains his world-class form into the next season.\n\nSalah, is one of Liverpool's most prolific scorers, currently ranking fifth in the club's all-time scoring charts with a whopping 211 goals. Since his arrival from Roma in 2017, he has been instrumental in transforming the Reds' fortunes.\n\nThe success story of Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp owes much to Salah's influence, as he blossomed into the player Chelsea had envisioned when they signed him back in 2014. After making waves at Basel, former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho brought Salah on board, but he soon found himself out of favor.\n\nA successful loan spell at Roma led to a permanent move in 2016, and after just one season, Liverpool swooped in, tripling Roma's investment. Despite the hefty price tag, it's considered one of the best deals in Liverpool's history given the subsequent success.\n\nAs we look ahead to next season, Salah's importance to Liverpool remains undiminished. However, Slot faces an early challenge as Salah enters the final year of his contract. When he inked a three-year deal in July 2022, Salah became the highest-paid player in Liverpool's history, earning around $450,000, (£350,000) per week.\n\nHowever, if Liverpool fail to secure a contract extension with Salah, he could leave on a free transfer next summer. At his peak, Salah was valued at hundreds of millions and it would be a significant blow for the Reds to lose him without any financial return.\n\nYet, a sale this summer seems unlikely. For both Liverpool and Salah, it's a case of all or nothing."
