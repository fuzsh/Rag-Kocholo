You’re probably right then about the Catalonian banks helping them out or they are getting money from some shady “unofficial” source. They are supposedly broke.\n\nWhy great? You want Arsenal to get Nico Williams?\n\nNo, so WE can buy him.\n\nHe will be available for the same price next summer. They will buy him then.\n\nUnless he only wants Barca, which might be the case since nobody is going for him this window so far. If not, they won’t get a free run at home, especially being skint as they are.\n\nSo we can buy him hehe\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#126\n\ngiorno\n\nboob novice\n\nJoined\n\nJul 20, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n28,255\n\nSupports\n\nReal Madrid\n\nGreat.

Where he was apparently involved with Ferdinand being allegedly tapped up by Chelsea at one point and more tapping up stuff with Ashley cole.

Lewandowski being crap for most of last season was why they failed to at least push Madrid for the title. Assuming Olmo will compete with Lewandowski for the starting spot, my guess would be they'll try to spread the goals around"
