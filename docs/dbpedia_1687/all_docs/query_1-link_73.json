        "text": "Background\n\nBorn 6 December 2002 in Rome Italy, Riccardo Calafiori joined Roma’s youth team at the age of nine. He rose through the ranks and attracted attention due to his speed, skill and potential. As a 15-year-old, Calafiori played a key role in Roma’s under-17 league-and-cup double in the 2017-18 season.\n\nIn October 2018, Calafiori’s career was almost cut short due to a horrendous injury suffered against Viktoria Plzen in a UEFA Youth League match. The youngster was on the wrong end of a studs-up challenge from Vaclav Svobada that ruptured all of the ligaments in his knee along with his meniscus and articular capsule. Calafiori was sidelined for a year before returning to competitive action for Roma’s Primavera side in 2019-20.\n\nHe made his first-team debut for Roma in a Europa League game against Borussia Monchengladbach in 2019. He then made his Serie-A debut as a sub against Bologna in March 2020. In a bid to gain more playing time and experience at the top level, Calafiori joined Genoa on loan in 2022.\n\nCalafiori moved to Basel in a permanent 3-year deal in August 2022, making his domestic debut for Basel in a 1-0 defeat to Lugano. He returned to Italy by joining Bologna on 31 August 2023. He grabbed his first Seria-A goals by scoring a brace in a 3-3 thriller against Juventus on 20 May 2024. Calafiori helped Bologna secure Champions League football by finishing fifth in Serie-A last season.\n\nStyle of Play\n\nWidely known to resemble some of Italy’s greatest defenders like Maldini and Nesta, Calafiori offers a lot more than looks. Standing 6-foot-2, he can play left-back or center-back. The youngster featured as a left-back during his time at Roma. He tried center-back at Basel and quickly became of the best in his new role while at Bologna.\n\nCalafiori is a defender who is very assured on the ball, so it’s no surprise that he mentioned Man City’s John Stones as his key reference. Last season, Calafiori recorded a pass accuracy of 89.6% and 3.68 progressive passes per 90 minutes (70th percentile). The Italy international completed 1600 passes, 76 long balls, completed 13 dribbles, and also created 17 chances last season.\n\nThese are impressive numbers for a center-back, pointing to him being comfortable with the ball at his feet. He is clearly someone who will be crucial in Mikel Arteta’s setup, which involves defenders being able to play out from the back and also carry the ball forward to break up the opposition structure.\n\nCalafiori recorded 1.61 interceptions per game last season, the third-best among defenders in Serie-A. He also averaged 1.50 tackles per game, 11th best among defenders. These stats show that he is as good defensively as he is going forward. He possesses the perfect mix of defensive capabilities and attacking skills to thrive under Mikel Arteta. His immense physical strength and ability to read the game should hasten his adaptation to Premier League football.\n\nFantasy Prospects\n\nAs a center-back, Calafiori assisted five goals for Bologna last season, the joint most of any center-back in Europe’s top five leagues. The Italian international also scored two goals and had an aerial duel win rate of 71.4%. Arsenal struggled with the left-back spot last season, the likes of Kiwior, Zinchenko, and Tomiyasu all enjoying spells as first-choice, but no one was able to nail down the spot.\n\nCalafiori’s versatility means the left-back position might be his best route into the Gunners back line that conceded the fewest goals in the league last season. The center-back duo of Saliba and Gabriel have developed a formidable partnership, so it is hard to see Arteta tampering with them for a player without Premier League experience.\n\nA role at left-back might prove beneficial for FPL managers looking to snap up Calafiori — It would grant greater license to move into the opposition half of the field. Calafiori will add to Arsenal’s already scary threat from set pieces that saw them score the most headed goals in the league last season.\n\nIn Fantrax, his new-boy status means price volatility. If you don’t draft him pre-season, at least add him to your watch-list. Along with several other tantalizing new-boy assets, be especially vigilant in GW-1 and GW-2, prepared to lock in either his pre-season price before the first barn-door closes, or (even better) lock his crash price before the second.\n\nEverything points towards Calfiori being Arsenal’s first choice left-back this season, and his stats show that he is worth risking a slot.\n\nWhat do you think of Calafiori? Will you look to give him a chance in your fantasy teams? Please register at SB Nation and let us know in the comments!\n\n~"
