That is different from \"0\" for nothing at all....\n\nPosted by avirosemail\n\nnorthern CA\n\n2638 posts\n\nThen it would be O standing for Orange maramalade -- the bitter Seville kind.\n\nThose oranges could grow in southern Spain and Portugal but they weren't very tasty as-is. The solution, of course, is to give them to Brits in a form that they get excited about, marmalade. When you amble about Sevilla you find not just walled orange mini-orchards that used to be the side yards/gardens of mosques, but also old shops that catered to visitors from the colder parts of Europe who developed a taste for bitter marmalade.\n\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/the-last-bitter-word-about-the-origins-of-seville-oranges-1.3953631\n\nhttps://www.missfoodwise.com/2018/03/bitter-seville-orange-marmalade-make.html/\n\nPosted by David\n\nSeattle, WA, USA ‚òîÔ∏è\n\n6788 posts\n\nOK, I'll play.\n\nP is for Pico, an island in the Azores.\n\nPico is the second largest island (by area) in the Azores. It‚Äôs also the name of tallest mountain in all of Portugal (including mainland Portugal), a volcano of the same name located on the island. Sometimes referred to as Ilha Preta (‚ÄúBlack Island‚Äù) because of its predominant black rocks and soils, all of volcanic origin. First settled in the 15th century, Pico‚Äôs economy has been historically based largely on fishing, agriculture, commercial whaling (now replaced with whale watching), and wine production. They‚Äôre still making great wine, though not as much as they once did.\n\nPhoto: An old winery on Pico I shot on a 2021 visit\n\nPosted by Claudia\n\nLand of La\n\n8947 posts\n\nP\n\nParliament Square in London\n\nThe most popular tourist destination in London as it includes the Houses of Parliament with Elizabeth's Tower with the Big Ben bell inside, and nearby Westminster Abbey. Its also adjacent o Westminster Bridge.\n\nEdit: beaten to the punch by 8 minutes because I had turn the kettle off.\n\nPosted by Carlos\n\nBarcelona + Sweden\n\n4066 posts\n\nQ is for Queralbs\n\nA medieval stone village in the Catalan Pyrenees with an intact 9th century Romanesque Church. Just outside of Queralbs is a rack railway (there are several departure times every day) up to the Vall de N√∫ria. The Vall de N√∫ria is a sacred valley in the high Pyrenees, there is a holy sanctuary and old 1930s hotel at the top, plus a small lake and plenty of hiking trails for all aptitudes. Very picturesque and popular with local Catalan families, although hardly known to foreign tourists. Makes for a fun day trip from Barcelona!\n\nPosted by Webmaster\n\nEdmonds, WA, USA\n\n980 posts\n\nR\n\nRennes, France. Pronounced: ren. I lived there for a semester, and I probably stayed living there permanently in another life as I really enjoyed it. It's the capital of Brittany, a historically Celtic region, and it's where many tourists likely get off the TGV to head to Le Mont St Michel. It's got a few great old-town streets with half-timber houses and it can be lively with college drinkers on weekend evenings. Eating a galette in this region is required. Maybe a local cidre. It is otherwise not high on the typical tourist's agenda except as a launching point to other parts of Brittany. It's a very livable city and I think it used to be the smallest city with a metro/subway system (Lausanne apparently holds this title now).\n\nPosted by Claudia\n\nLand of La\n\n8947 posts\n\nT\n\nThames River Path\n\nhttps://ramblingman.org.uk/planningatrip/planning-a-thames-path-walk/\n\nHave walked a lot of it but on each trip to London I amble some more.\n\nPosted by BigMikeWestByGodVirginia\n\nAlmost Heaven\n\n3034 posts\n\nNigel, you're saucy.\n\nPosted by Cyn\n\nColorado Mountains, USA\n\n7694 posts\n\nU\n\nUnder the Wire, meaning just reaching a place before it‚Äôs too late, something I try to avoid but that my husband consistently tries to make. That‚Äôs resulted in a few conflicts - when to leave for the airport, when to get to the gate, when to get to a train station or bus or tram stop, when to leave for a museum or concert, etc., etc.\n\nIt‚Äôs thrilling (and apparently efficient) when one arrives just Under the Wire, but it‚Äôs nerve-wracking. I‚Äôm trying to ensure that we don‚Äôt go there very often, leaving things until the very last minute. Getting someplace with adequate time‚Ä¶is that then ‚ÄúOver the Wire?‚Äù\n\nPosted by Cyn\n\nColorado Mountains, USA\n\n7694 posts\n\nV\n\nVery Exclusive Status - a place that Priscilla achieved with her final place name to the first Traveling Through the Alphabet thread. With her 5,000th post, a yellow star in a dark blue square now appears next to her name. Then again, even I have actually also reached that number 5,000 so perhaps it‚Äôs not such an exclusive status. Anyone who sticks around here long enough can get a star, of one color or another.\n\nA Naugahyde Star, now that‚Äôs another story.\n\nPosted by AussieNomad\n\nAustralia\n\n1058 posts\n\nW is for Wellington New Zealand which is a lovely city in New Zealand. It has colourful wooden houses and a cable car and is sometimes called the San Francisco of the southern hemisphere.\n\nJust don't get Wellington New Zealand confused with Wellington Australia. While Wellington Australia does have some lovely caves it also has a huge crystal meth problem and as a consequence lots of petty crime.\n\nPosted by Janis\n\nWA State\n\n3961 posts\n\nW for Warta, River, Poland\n\nThis river flows through Pozna≈Ñ and is a popular with nature lovers and sports enthusiasts. Poznan is known for it‚Äôs universities and it‚Äôs old town with Renaissance-style buildings. Pozna≈Ñ is situated between Berlin & Warsaw.\n\nPosted by Allan\n\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada\n\n4340 posts\n\nTo get us by X...Route 8X in Banff, Alberta. If you don't have a car, this is the bus you want to hop on to get you from Banff to Lake Louise and back.\n\nPosted by Janis\n\nWA State\n\n3961 posts\n\nY for Yokohama, Japan\n\nIt's the second largest city in Japan. Less than a half hour from Tokyo by train. Popular city among expats. It also has one of the largest Chinatowns (who knew). What piqued my interest- it's where Kirin Beer is produced. The only beer I like! Wonderful with Japanese Food. Another destination?\n\nPosted by AussieNomad\n\nAustralia\n\n1058 posts\n\nZ is for Zizkov telecommunications tower in Prague. It has excellent views over Prague and cool hammocks to lounge in at the top.\n\nPosted by Janis\n\nWA State\n\n3961 posts\n\nA for Altamura, Italy\n\nHistorical town in the heart of Puglia. Best known for its Cathedral and Museum of Archaeology. Altamura is known as the ‚Äúcity of bread.‚Äù It is known that the bread is so good that the local McDonalds was forced to close after two years! In addition, the infused walnut liqueur is famous there.\n\nPosted by Eatsrootsandleaves\n\nKamarooka\n\n425 posts\n\nB\n\nB is for Boyup Brook a small town in the SW of Western Australia. It apparently is well known for it's country and western music festival something we only found out when we got there.\n\nBut for my wife and I it wasn't the music it was the petrol.\n\nWe were travelling around WA by campervan. Our previous night was in Mt Barker. A massive storm cell had arrived in the SW so our plan was to just hit the road and get to the city of Bunbury.\n\nMy wife usually does the driving (nervous passenger) and I navigate.\n\nOff we go in pouring rain and howling winds along predominantly uninhabited forested countryside. No internet no phone reception. After about 100 kms of driving my wife casually mentions the fuel gauge is sitting just above empty.\n\nI casually reply that there are no towns for 80 kms.\n\nAs we pass a sign indicating Boyup Brook is 66 kms away, my wife informs me the petrol light has come on.\n\nIt was a fairly nervous 66 kms (buffeted by viscious crosswinds). We crawl into Boyup Brook on fumes, roll to a pump and fill up. Never has a place been such a joy to find. It is actually a cute little town and we had a great lunch. But for the 2 of us that petrol bowser was a highlight of our Western Australia travels.\n\nPosted by Nigel OP\n\nNorthamptonshire, England\n\n33347 posts\n\nThanks to Janis for putting us over into Round 79\n\nand thanks to all for following us to our new home.\n\nHand stitched Naugahyde star for Janis, and Nauga confetti and party poppers all over the room. Nice celebration party. Pull up a chair, and enjoy some things on sticks and some bubbly, both alcoholic and N/A.\n\nCongrats to all...\n\nonwards and upwards..\n\n(by the way, I don't think I'll ever forget Boyup Brook ) wow.\n\nPosted by avirosemail\n\nnorthern CA\n\n2638 posts\n\nD is for Drancy internment camp outside Paris --\n\nmost people have some awareness of its use as a holding facility for Jews being sent on for extermination by Vichy and Nazi German authorities during the middle of WWII, but before it was holding Jews it was holding refugee opponents of the Franco-ist takeover of Spain.\n\nSome photos here:\n\nhttp://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/gallery/dran.htm\n\n\"Over 6,000 Jewish children from France were imprisoned and transported to Nazi extermination camps to their deaths between July 17th and September 30, 1942.\"\n\nThere is a large thick book at the museum by the Seine where I could turn the pages and run my finger over the listings of deportees who had the same last name as me, and one (at least) of my uncles who survived.\n\nPosted by AmandaR\n\nPhoenix, AZ\n\n330 posts\n\nE is for Ein Gedi, an historic and lush nature preserve in Israel near the Dead Sea.\n\nEin Gedi has been a refuge for people and animals since Biblical times. It features a waterfall, stream and cave that David hide from Saul in and showed mercy by not killing the king who wanted to kill him. It's an easy hike to follow the stream up to the waterfall, which is impressive in the midst of an area that is barren and dry. You will most likely see animals in the area as the stream, plants and trees give life to many types of insects and animals. More can be seen if you're adventurous: there's a different trail that goes to another waterfall and even beautiful lookouts over the Dead Sea.\n\nEin Gedi is easy to get to as you drive from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea. Don't miss it!\n\nhttps://en.parks.org.il/reserve-park/en-gedi-nature-reserve/\n\nPosted by avirosemail\n\nnorthern CA\n\n2638 posts\n\nF is for Fountains Abbey, where Friar Tuck made merry with Maid Marian before joining the band of Robin Hood.\n\nIt's near Aldfield in north Yorkshire and you can see where Robin and Marian and the Friar practiced hiding from the Sheriff.\n\nWith the messy divorce between Henry VIII and the Pope, the property switched hands a bunch of times and was altered a lot, so it might be that Friar Tuck really was from another abbey, depending on whether you like the Revised Standard Version or the New International translation. Unclear whether they ran into David or Saul as well.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountains_Abbey\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friar_Tuck\n\nPosted by Janis\n\nWA State\n\n3961 posts\n\nG for Gallipoli, Italy\n\nLocated in SW corner of Puglia. It‚Äôs accessible via sea or 16th century bridge. Known as ‚Äúbeautiful city‚Äù in Greek. The main attraction is in the old quarter & sea. You can reach Gallipoli by train from Lecce, in about one hour. Another area on my radar!\n\nPosted by BigMikeWestByGodVirginia\n\nAlmost Heaven\n\n3034 posts\n\nH for, Hell, Michigan.

Get away from the November chills and the consumerism of the holiday season by basking in the violet shades of beautiful city foliage in the districts where tourists spend their time -- Recoleta, Palermo, and Belgrano.\n\nhttps://buenosaires.gob.ar/noticias/el-jacaranda-simbolo-de-la-primavera-en-buenos-aires\n\nThose trees have been popular here in California with city planners, too, but they look even sweeter when you're on the other side of the equator.\n\nhttps://toptropicals.com/html/toptropicals/articles/trees/Jacaranda-mimosifolia.htm\n\nPosted by Jean\n\nIdaho, USA\n\n7552 posts\n\n‚ÄúK‚Äù is the first letter for so many lovely places in Hawaii!

Nigel is going to get a whopper of a bill. :-)\n\nPosted by Janis\n\nWA State\n\n3961 posts\n\nO for Otranto, Italy\n\nThis beautiful historic town is located alongside the Adriatic Sea and Salento. It‚Äôs a Puglian city with cobbled streets, & gorgeous vistas. It boasts a UNESCO old Town ‚Äòcentro storico‚Äô and a medieval castle. It‚Äôs in the province of beautiful Lecce.\n\nPosted by avirosemail\n\nnorthern CA\n\n2638 posts\n\nP is for Pau, France in the Pyr√©n√©es not far from the Spanish border.\n\nIt's remarkable that here in the USA the Wright Brothers are such important icons of American progress and derring-do, and everyone and his sister knows the tale of Kitty Hawk and the first flight, but a key part of their story is that the brothers couldn't get any American investors for several years after those first flights, so they instead got support from far-sighted French businesspeople in the city of Pau:\n\nhttps://www.pau.aeroport.fr/airport/history\n\nNote that this is just one, more recent, feather in the furry cap of Pau's distinctions.\n\nIt was their air shows in France that made the Wright Brothers international celebrities; it wasn't until they moved back to the US that they were invited by Pres. Taft to visit the Whitehouse.\n\nPosted by Allan\n\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada\n\n4340 posts\n\nQ for Quillan, France It's a coincidence that avirosemail in the the above post listed Pau, because Quillan is also close by the Spanish border and about a 45 minute drive south of Carcassonne. Until yesterday, I'd never heard of it and so I can't be as informative or interesting as the Pau post is, but some very good friends called us to get our input on a trip they're planning for September to Quillan where they've been invited to stay by some other friends. Now I can't wait for them to go on their trip so we can determine if we need to add this region to our every growing list.\n\nPosted by Wil\n\nIJzendijke, The Netherlands\n\n2039 posts\n\nR for Reimerswaal was during the Middle Ages the third largest city in the Dutch delta region but doesn‚Äôt exist any more. As it was once built on reclaimed land it was lost in the early 18th century during one of the many storm surges we have had in our history. Nowadays it‚Äôs one of the over two hundred so called drowned villages in this part of the Netherlands, only the foundations of the city walls and houses are left and some of it only visible during low tide. Not every village was lost as a result of a storm surge, some because of military inundation.\n\nNowadays is Reimerswaal the name of a municipality.\n\nPosted by Janis\n\nWA State\n\n3961 posts\n\nS for Scanno, Italy\n\nOne of the most beautiful villages in Italy. Also known for their traditional clothes. Considering it‚Äôs heart month, there is a myth that Lake Scanno has the shape of a heart. Located in Abruzzo, hidden in the Marsicane mountains. Just another off the beaten path to explore.\n\nPosted by Mona\n\nCalifornia USA\n\n4003 posts\n\nT is for Terme. Look at any map of central and southern Italy, like the town Janis mentions above and search for terme nearby and you‚Äôll see many possibilities for thermal pools, baths, spas, etc.\n\nPosted by Mona\n\nCalifornia USA\n\n4003 posts\n\nU is for Uldingen-M√ºhlhofen on Bodensee/Lake Constance. I‚Äôve mentioned nearby Unteruldingen before as that‚Äôs where the Stone Aged pile houses are recreated on the shore, visible when cruising on the lake. The town center, U-M, has one of the most varied schnitzel restaurants near the train station. Did I also mention, I‚Äôm sure I did, that my favorite town of √úberlingen is just a few miles away?\n\nPosted by Janis\n\nWA State\n\n3961 posts\n\nV is for Viareggio, Italy\n\nLocated in Tuscany it is well known for its Carnevale. This year it is celebrating it‚Äôs 150th birthday this month. You can reach Viareggio by train directly from Florence, Pisa, Lucca, La Spezia, and CT. The city is known for it‚Äôs seaside on the Tyrrhenian, the Villa Paulina Civic Museum & Art-deco architecture, just to name a few.\n\nPosted by Wil\n\nIJzendijke, The Netherlands\n\n2039 posts\n\nW for Wadden Sea is an intertidal zone in the southeastern part of the European North Sea. It stretches from Den Helder in the northwest of the Netherlands, past the great river estuaries of Germany to it‚Äôs northern boundery at Skallingen in Denmark, along a total coastline of 500 km and a total area of about 10,000 km¬≤. It‚Äôs famous for it‚Äôs rich flora and fauna, especially birds and well known too for mudflat hiking.

The town was part of the Mark Brandenburg. I set foot here twice, never checked it out.\n\nGoing to Gdansk in 2003 from Berlin (Bahnhof Zoo) required then two train changes , one in Germany, ie Angerm√ºnde, and one in Poland before proceeding to Gdansk, making the entire ride 9 hours. I was there only at the train stop in Angerm√ºnde waiting for the next train.\n\nIn 2015 I was there again , this time doing a day trip from Berlin to Greifswald, I changed my mind en route and got off in Angerm√ºnde to ride back. I should have stayed at least one hour or so walking around and exploring this little town in this backwater Prussian area.\n\nPosted by Wil\n\nIJzendijke, The Netherlands\n\n2039 posts\n\nAround the World in Eighty Alphabets!\n\nPosted by Janis\n\nWA State\n\n3961 posts\n\nB for Braga, Portugal\n\nRegarded as the religious center of Portugal.

I was looking (stretching) to find a way to compliment a B&B during chitchat with a staff person in the dining room, and I said that I really liked the bed linens.

Fantastic...if I only had known that !\n\nIn modern European history Inowroclaw was occupied by the Poles , Prussians, the French, then was part of Germany until WW1 , suffered at the hands of the Germans and Soviets in WW2.

It's a long narrow barrier island and is a vacation spot for Germans on the Ostsee (Baltic Sea). Peenem√ºnde is at the North end of the island, which was area used by Nazi Germany to test rockets. The South end of the island in in Poland. When I visited the island in 2006, I was amazed at how warm the water was. Because Ostsee is a shallow sea, it heats up faster in the summer than the Mediterranean. In fact, it was warmer than the Med when I stayed. It is also much less saline than the oceans, because of the many rivers flowing into it.\n\nEdited to add: We went there for a wedding at the pier at Heringsdorf. The bride and in-laws were from East Germany and we stayed in Koserow. They showed us the bunk housing used there for summer camp.

I was on a tour, so not in control of the length of time in the city, but it would be worth more than an overnight. It is small and manageable (for Indian cities), and only a short train ride from New Delhi. The Taj Mahal doesn't disappoint with its majestic white marble domes, but the gardens and external buildings are also of interest. There are nearby gardens and viewpoints to see the building from across the river or through a screen of trees.

In May of 2009, we bicycled here from Colmar to view the town and vineyards. We arrived the week before the Stork Festival, so the town was all prettied-up with lots of geraniums in planter boxes. As were the storks, with nests on the central castle. In the RS guide book, he calls Eguisheim \"nearly too cute\". We didn't stay long, as tour busses were starting to off load. After seeing the nests here, once we started looking up in Colmar we found plenty more, particularly on the Dominican Church.\n\nEdited to add: This is bringing back other memories. I'd known the Alsace has a history of been fought over between France and Germany. The French want the border to be the Rhine River and the Germans believe the border to be the Vosges Mountains. We visited a friend's friend, a 30 year old woman at the time. Her Grandmother, Mother, and she were all born in the same house.

Nothing since, so I‚Äôm not current on Bingo lingo.\n\nLooking it up on the Interweb just now, I‚Äôm told that in the UK, every one of the 90 possible Bingo numbers has a nickname. So 89 is ‚ÄúNearly there.‚Äù Other numbers seem to have a Cockney rhyming slang connection. Lots of the nicknames would likely be completely lost on Americans because of British-specific references.

Over an area of 25km¬≤, up to 12,000 people worked simultaneously on guided weapons, most famously the world‚Äôs first cruise missiles and the first ever functioning large-scale rockets. Both were designed as a weapon of terror against the civil population, made mostly by forced labourers and from 1944 they began to be used in the Second World War as ‚ÄúVergeltungswaffen‚Äù (V-weapons).\n\nThe Peenem√ºnde Historical Technical Museum reconstructs the history of the creation and use of these weapons.

It is located off the Pomeranian coast in the Baltic Sea and belongs to the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The island is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Germany.\n\nThe first bathing facility on R√ºgen opened in 1794 and to this day you will find the typical architecture (B√§derarchitektur) in several seaside resorts. Till today it has lost none of its charm.\n\nDuring WWII Prora was constructed as a mass tourist resort but it was never finished. The 4,5 km long building complex still exists today and can be partially visited. A creepy megalomaniac relic from the Nazi era.\n\nSeveral seaside resorts are accessible via an historic narrow gauge railway employing steam locomotives, called the \"Rasender Roland\". Tourist destinations, other than seaside resorts, include Jasmund national park with interesting chalk cliff formations, the wood-covered Granitz hills with their hunting lodge and the classicist buildings of Putbus.\n\nThe island offers a huge variety of different beach and shore areas. R√ºgen is often visited by windsurfers and kitesurfers.\n\nPosted by Mignon\n\nMunich\n\n556 posts\n\nS is for Stralsund Germany\n\nThe Hanseatic City of Stralsund is located at the southern coast of the Strelasund, a sound of the Baltic Sea separating the island of R√ºgen from the Pomeranian mainland. City rights were granted in 1234, making it the oldest city in Pomerania.\n\nDuring the Nazi period Stralsund's military installations expanded, and a naval training base opened on the nearby island of D√§nholm. In WWII the city was subjected to repeated Allied bombing. The 354th Rifle Division of the Red Army occupied Stralsund.\n\nDuring the period of the German Democratic Republic, Stralsund saw the construction of numerous Plattenbau prefabricated apartment blocks. Its economic life centered on the now state-owned shipyard, which largely focussed on building ships for the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter German reunification in 1990, the city's historic old town was thoroughly restored, and Communist-era apartment blocks were renovated and upgraded. In 2002 the old town of Stralsund was listed as UNESCO World Heritage site because of its outstanding Brick Gothic buildings and importance during the Hanseatic League and Swedish rule.\n\nPosted by MariaF\n\nOntario, Canada\n\n4632 posts\n\n@Nigel, Queen Street West still has that vibe, and Chinatown is as bustling as ever. Still great Dim Sum around.\n\nAnd as we have arrived at 'T'....T is for Toronto, Ontario, Canada Despite its size Canada only has 3 truly major cities with Toronto being one of them. It is the capital of Ontario, but not the capital of Canada. For a short time, when still called York, it was the capital of Upper Canada (pre-Confederation), however, its vulnerable location made it less than ideal as a country's capital in the long run.\n\nIt is, however, ideally placed for a vacation stop. It is a primary airport hub, but also accessible from the US by car or boat. You can hit the beach on Toronto Island for the afternoon, and attend the theatre or opera by night. The city still holds neighbourhoods like 'Little Italy', or 'Little Portugal' where habits, decor and language from the 'old country' is still evident. It is well connected to many other tourist cities, from Niagra Falls, to Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City. The last 3 are well connected to Toronto by train, but also by a major highway. A scenic secondary highway also connects and all take you through some of Canada's oldest settled landscape.\n\nConsider it for a winter break, as the lakeshore location moderates the snow and coldest weather. The major downtown is linked by the PATH, 30 kms of (mostly) underground walkways, and has good subway and light rail connections to the airport, train station and further communities.\n\nPosted by Paul636\n\nMunich\n\n210 posts\n\nU - Uhudler, a regional wine speciality from Southern Burgenland, Austria\n\nUhudler is one of the most distinctive wines produced in Austria. It originates from the area around Heiligenbrunn in southern Burgenland. Uhudler wines are usually made red or as a kind of ros√© from the Noah, Isabella, Concord, Clinton and Delaware grape varieties. These grapes were imported from the United States to Europe after wine louse had destroyed much of the European vines in the 1860s.\n\nThat area of Austria, close to the Hungarian border, does rather not see any overseas-visitors and it does not look like Austria.\n\nhttps://traveltoaustria.info/heiligenbrunn-the-cradle-of-the-uhudler-wine/\n\nThat said it‚Äôs worth a visit for its vine culture and it‚Äôs not too far away from some of the best thermal spas (e.g. Bad Loipersdorf, Bad Blumau) in Austria.\n\nPosted by Fred\n\nSan Francisco\n\n14580 posts\n\nAnother vote for Stralsund, it was controlled by the Swedes for part of its history when the Baltic became the \"Swedish lake\" If you're interested in German naval history, the famous Marine-Museum is located in Stralsund.\n\nSome years back I got on the train in Berlin Hbf , the terminus of which was Stralsund.

About 85% got off, obviously they were going to see the Camp , (the KZ) , I was going to Neustrelitz to see the Prussian Schloss connected with the monarchial dynasty, the Hohenzollerns, when this town was known as Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nPosted by Fred\n\nSan Francisco\n\n14580 posts\n\nV\n\nis for Vauchamps, France,\n\nLocated east of Paris near Chateau-Thierry on the Marne and Montmirail.\n\nThanks to a French local, an older woman, (quite helpful), who had her daughter translate her information on the significance of this place regarding Napoleon to me in English, Vauchamps is part of \"La Route des Quatre Victoires\", (road of the 4 victories ) where in Feb 1814 Napoleon was on a roll beating the invading Allies in 4 different towns within a 2 week period.\n\nVauchamps was one of these sites, the main memorial to Napoleon is outside of Montmirail. Of course, the woman had told me not miss that either. I didn't.

Actually, it‚Äôs 122 Great Titchfield Street, but would this go under the O‚Äôs, as in ‚ÄúOne-Twenty-Two?‚Äù Anyway, we‚Äôre at the G‚Äôs, and this is the place that initiated the idea of listing lodging spots in this thread, when Nigel responded to a different thread that was discussing it. This is our new favorite place to stay in London.\n\nWe‚Äôd had a favorite B&B in Marylebone, in northwestern Central London, but they didn‚Äôt reopen after the Pandemic. But for last year, we found 122 Great Titchfield Street (notice how many B&B‚Äôs are named simply by the address, unless they‚Äôre given some cutesy name like ‚ÄúThe Nest‚Äù), and it‚Äôs in Fitzrovia, northern Central London, an easy walking distance to the British Museum, Oxford Street, Soho, the BBC, Regent‚Äôs Park, and Tube stations for a short ride to everywhere else. And in an expensive city like London, the more affordable price is one of its best features.\n\nIt‚Äôs not enormous, with two smaller rooms and one larger self-catering apartment. The apartment has a well-equipped kitchen, and an unusual bathroom, designed as a ‚Äúwet room,‚Äù where the shower head hangs from its ceiling and gets the floor wet when in use. It‚Äôs an efficient use of space, but needs a bit of squeegeeing afterwards, to be able to use the toilet or get to the sink. Not a big deal, but it does take a bit of getting used to.\n\nMike, the owner, is very accommodating, We‚Äôre staying there again, on our next trip.\n\nPosted by Cyn\n\nColorado Mountains, USA\n\n7694 posts\n\nH\n\nHoliday Inn. The original (fictional) place was from the movie of the same name, with music by Irving Berlin. It was only open on holidays, and somebody named Bing Crosby was part of the entertainment. Some Astaire guy, too.\n\nBut a chain of hotels was formed, using the name, but open year ‚Äòround. All Holiday Inns off a main road could be immediately identified by a big, green sign with an arrow going around the perimeter, pointing to a big star. The signs have been retired, but it‚Äôs another American success story, with locations worldwide. There‚Äôs even a Holiday Inn just up the street from 122 Great Titchfield Street, mentioned just above. It‚Äôs got a covered driveway at the entrance, so you could arrive dry, even in pouring rain.\n\nBack in the 1970‚Äôs, select Holiday Inns introduced the Holidome. All under one roof, surrounded by the front doors of the rooms, was an enclosed courtyard playground with miniature golf on Astroturf, and varieties of pool - indoor for swimming, and tables for shooting. Thermal spa pools, too. Those are now gone (like the green signs), but we once stayed at one in Nebraska - a hotel with an amusement park, as opposed to Disney amusement parks that started having affiliated lodging.\n\nI‚Äôm dreaming, of a ‚Ä¶\n\nPosted by MariaF\n\nOntario, Canada\n\n4632 posts\n\nI is for Inn Harking back to the Romans, inns were establishments that provided lodging with food and drink as well as care and stabling for your horse..often in rural locations. As roads and wealth improved, and the use of stage coaches as well as private coaches increased, posting, or coaching, inns appeared. They had offered quick meals for stage coach passengers while the coach horses were traded out for fresh teams. Private coaches could also switch horse teams to allow for quicker travel. The heyday of coaching inns were the regency period until the advent of train travel.\n\nThese days, the word \"Inn\" is often attached to a lower budget hotel, with minimal ammenities, to differentiate itself from a \"motel\".\n\nPosted by Cyn\n\nColorado Mountains, USA\n\n7694 posts\n\nJ\n\nJurys Inn, once with locations throughout Ireland and the UK. It seems that William Jury started in the 1880‚Äôs what became a sizeable lodging success story. I haven‚Äôt stayed at any, but it was clear that there were several in Dublin a few years ago, and another in Cork. It appears these aren‚Äôt all ‚Äúbudget‚Äù Inns. But the Jurys in Cork doesn‚Äôt seem to be horribly expensive‚Ä¶ or maybe make that wasn‚Äôt.\n\nApparently last year, all Jurys Inns were renamed Leonardo Hotels, after being acquired by an Israeli billionaire. But the Website for the Cork location mentions both names, and even includes a picture of its exterior with a prominent ‚ÄúJurys‚Äù affixed to the side of the building, which is somewhat confusing. Perhaps their transition is taking some extra time, while clients and staff get used to the new identity. And hotel versus inn? Maybe a name change instantly transforms the status of a place, or maybe there‚Äôs no immediate categorization of lodging, based on the name. Hostels are clearly very different from hotels or inns, but I‚Äôm not so sure that an inn or a hotel are automatically more or less budget than the other.\n\nPosted by Mona\n\nCalifornia USA\n\n4003 posts\n\nK is for Kimpton.

Every time I‚Äôve stayed in Florence, I‚Äôve reserved an apartment in the Oltrarno neighborhood, on the west side of the Tiber river, across from the main city. It hasn‚Äôt always been the same apartment, but the locations have all been outstanding- a short walk across a bridge to many popular tourist sights and museums, and the Oltrarno itself has wondrous places - Boboli Gardens, Brancaci Chapel, and really my favorite restaurants and gelaterias in Florence.

We arrived at night, and Peri‚Äôs is located conveniently close to the airport, so we didn‚Äôt have too far to go to get to our room for the night. We hadn‚Äôt had dinner yet, and although the small hotel didn‚Äôt have a restaurant, there was one just down the street, which would be closing soon. The hotel desk had a menu for our perusal, and called a to-go order for us, which was deli to our room shortly thereafter. It had been a long travel day, and getting dinner delivered to us made things much, much easier.\n\nThe owner drove us to Piraeus Harbor the next morning, so we could catch our ferry for Hydra Island. Rough seas prevented ferries from sailing that morning (we waited for the second and third scheduled ferries, which didn‚Äôt depart either) and we wound up sharing a taxi with another couple. But that wasn‚Äôt Peri‚Äôs fault. They‚Äôre not adjacent to the Acropolis, so maybe not the first choice for many visitors, and we didn‚Äôt stay there upon our next time in Athens, but their customer service couldn‚Äôt have been better. For the right customers who need the right location at the right time (and the right price - very affordable), Peri‚Äôs makes a great Athens stop.\n\nPosted by Cyn\n\nColorado Mountains, USA\n\n7694 posts\n\nQ\n\nQuality Inn, a chain brand that‚Äôs part of the Choice Hotels, mentioned above. It seems to me that I‚Äôve stayed at one or more Quality Inns, but it would‚Äôve been nearly 40 years ago. Apparently the Quality Courts United, an informal group of Florida motels in 1939, formally became the first hotel chain in the U.S.A. in 1941.\n\nQuality isn‚Äôt everything, though, as the Quality Inns are not as high-end as the Clarion Hotels in the corporate family.\n\nPosted by Cyn\n\nColorado Mountains, USA\n\n7694 posts\n\nR\n\nRabbit Ears Motel, Steamboat Springs, Colorado. This is an iconic place in northwestern Colorado. Nicknamed Ski Town, USA, Steamboat Springs is just down US Highway 40 from the Steamboat ski resort, and has been the home for more U.S. olympic athletes (mostly Winter Games) than anywhere else. Farther up Hwy. 40 is Rabbit Ears Pass, a steep mountain pass overseen by a rock formation that features two slender rock towers that resemble a rabbit‚Äôs ears from a distance.\n\nThe motel features a sign out front with a big rabbit head, with very long ears and googly eyes. It‚Äôs lit up in neon at night. The eyes used to have a switch that made it look like the they were looking left, then right, then left, then right ‚Ä¶ they had to stop the eyes‚Äô automation because it was distracting drivers, leading to accidents.\n\nWe‚Äôve stayed at the Rabbit Ears many times. As the ski resort has expanded and gotten more and more development over the years (this was its 60th anniversary), condos and hotels closer to the lifts have become more and more numerous. The once very inexpensive motel‚Äôs prices have risen over time, but it remains a definite alternative to the glitzy places up on the hill, 3 miles up the road.\n\nPosted by Cyn\n\nColorado Mountains, USA\n\n7694 posts\n\nS\n\nStar Motel, Rapid City, South Dakota. Place close to Mount Rushmore in the 1960‚Äôs, pretty inexpensive, with a pool for the kids? The Star Motel was the place. On the sign on a pole out front, there was even a big star! Clever marketing idea, huh?\n\nI hadn‚Äôt been near there in decades, so I looked it up just now to see if it‚Äôs still around. Well, apparently at other spots in Rapid City, there‚Äôs a Gold Star Motel, and also a Stardust Motel - no relation. But where the Star Motel once stood is now the Star Village Apartment community. An aerial image on my Maps app shows there‚Äôs still a kiddie pool, and the bigger pool, too. Many of the original buildings may still be standing, perhaps virtually unchanged. So some things apparently never change much, but I‚Äôll bet the black and white TV‚Äôs are all gone.\n\nPosted by Mona\n\nCalifornia USA\n\n4003 posts\n\nTA TripAdvisor, one of the first online places to look for hotel reviews.

A lodge can mean different things to different people, but to me a lodge is a rustic edifice built in the woods or on a lake for summer (or winter) getaways. Think of the lodges of the Adirondack, Yellowstone, or Rocky Mountains. Today is Ottawa's first heat advisory for the season (92F).

Thirty years ago, this was an appealing idea ‚Ä¶ pay for 2 weeks out of the year, one during the week of Fourth of July, and the other around Thanksgiving, and other Timeshare owners are covering the expenses of the condo for the rest of the year.\n\nWe had a Timeshare place (shared with friends) in the Colorado Mountains - Ski Country, USA - and stayed there for our appointed weeks many times. But we also did a timeshare trade twice - swapping our Colorado week for a week in Austria (Ski Country, Europe), and in southern Spain. The Spain stay was at an enclosed resort, with only Brits except for us, and a thumping disco went on until late at night. It was so loud that it was impossible to get to sleep until it stopped. That didn‚Äôt bother others, because I think they never left the property the entire week, getting up at 10:00 or 11:00 and siting by the pool until it was time to Disco again. We did daily daytrips, driving long distances to places in southern Spain that Rick Steves and other guidebooks recommended.\n\nWe sold our share many years ago, and got our own place. There‚Äôs no one now to split the maintenance cost, and no way to still trade our ‚Äúweek‚Äù for a week somewhere else. So the trade wasn‚Äôt a perfect situation, but it did provide options.\n\nPosted by Den\n\nVancouver, WA\n\n513 posts\n\nUllapool, on Scotland's northwest coast.

In April, 1917 the Canadians and UK troops fought a 4 day battle against the German 6th Army. It was one of Canada's earliest WW1 successes and a pivital battle. As a school age child learning about our Canadian war time history, this was the battle that left a lasting impression. Following peace, France gave the ground of the Vimy Ridge Memorial, and a surrounding 100 hectares to Canada for use in perpetuity as a battle ground park and memorial. Though most of the park grounds are still off limits for safety reasons, there is a section of trenches and tunnels open for visitors.\n\nPosted by Allan\n\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada\n\n4340 posts\n\nMaria, me too.

Moretti in Italy, Tecate in Mexico...I wonder if the Australians know that Fosters is owned by Molson in Canada?\n\nPosted by Cyn\n\nColorado Mountains, USA\n\n7694 posts\n\nA\n\nAnother Round ‚Ä¶ regarding beer, and in this Alphabet Travel. As mentioned by Allan, Australia‚Äôs Foster‚Äôs is brewed in the USA (in Texas), but Canada‚Äôs Molson is brewed in the U.S. as well (in addition to in Canada). Then there‚Äôs Coors, which merged with Molson several years ago, adding to the international conglomeration of beers situation. The Coors brewery complex in Golden, Colorado, a few short miles west of Wheat Ridge down 32nd Avenue, remains the largest single brewery on Earth. Today, June 5, is the 96th anniversary of the death (murder?) of company founder Adolph Coors, but that‚Äôs another story.\n\nBack to travel and beers of mingled geographic history, we just returned from London last night, after almost a month in Ireland. Nearly every pub and bar in Ireland has taps for Guinness and for Coors Light - two brews that couldn‚Äôt possibly be more visually different. Guinness is part of the corporation that includes Heineken and Budweiser, and started out in Dublin. It also now owns and makes Murphy‚Äôs, a rival stout begun in Cork. Murphy‚Äôs is still brewed in Cork, at the Heineken brewery (which you will pass on the way to the Butter Museum, if you‚Äôre walking from the east). But so is Coors - rival to Bud in America, and a different corporation. What if Ford made Chevy, or Fiat made Jeep, or BMW made Mini ‚Ä¶ wait, ignore that last part.\n\nSo in Ireland, rival beers from ostensibly different makers are brewed by the same place. A waitress in a restaurant in Galway had said she was surprised there was any Coors other than the Light that she‚Äôd only heard of. A barman in Glenbeigh asked about why Coors Light has now changed to just ‚ÄúCoors,‚Äù and pointed to the tap handle, which had no ‚ÄúLight‚Äù wording. I‚Äôd seen many other taps that had all said Coors Light. I half-joked that the change must‚Äôve happened because ‚ÄúCoors‚Äù and ‚ÄúLight‚Äù were redundant. But I see now that whomever is making Coors for the European market doesn‚Äôt need to make the distinction needed in North America, because that Coors in Ireland is the only Coors. Taking the ‚ÄúLight‚Äù off the package cleans it up. It also saves room for a small mountain image (the Rocky Mountains symbolized for a British Isle) on the can, which is gray when room temperature but turns blue when cold, and he showed me the new can. Have a cold one, but it may have done less traveling than you‚Äôd expect.\n\nPosted by Allan\n\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada\n\n4340 posts\n\nTo keep up with the current theme, B for Bottega della Birra in Sorrento. I like to track down local craft beers wherever I am and discovered this little gem of a pub in Sorrento. It features craft beers from across Europe and I found an outstanding Italian stout from Radiocraft Brewery called Papercut. It's got a cinnamon hint to it; almost not memorable though as I was lightheaded after one beer and discovered its alcohol content was 10.5%.\n\nNot only an astonishing number of beer choices at this pub, but they had a bruschetta made with a pistachio pesto that was almost as outstanding as my 10.5% cinnamon beer.\n\nPosted by avirosemail\n\nnorthern CA\n\n2638 posts\n\nI like this theme!!

Our trip one October included a couple of notable restaurants, and Estrella Damm was promoted as the highly regarded, ideal beer for the Catalan food. Several years later, in London in March 2020 (a week before the horrible Pandemic was declared), we discovered a Spanish restaurant close to our B&B. They had Estrella Damm! But they were down to a very few bottles, as the Spanish couple who owned and ran the restaurant had decided to move back to Spain, and this was their final week in London. That was lucky for us to have found their small place before things changed so much for everyone. I hope they‚Äôre doing well, wherever they are. Estrella Damm may still be a factor in that, on some level.\n\nPosted by Cyn\n\nColorado Mountains, USA\n\n7694 posts\n\nG\n\nGuinness, an iconic stout from Ireland. The Widget in the cans of Guinness is a brilliant invention for releasing nitrogen into the beer, and achieving the kind of double-pour experience at home that you‚Äôd get at a pub. At the higher altitudes of Colorado, the pressure differential between the contents of the can and the atmospheric pressure in the room can cause an immediate overflow, so pouring quickly into a glass is a useful skill.\n\nSeveral years ago, a talented local group that performed Irish traditional music mostly for their own enjoyment was having a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day gathering, and cans of Guinness were available. Almost no one sought out a glass, and were drinking straight from the can. I asked for, and obtained a glass, and mentioned how that was the way Guinness meant their beer to be enjoyed, but one guy with just the can said ‚Äúthis is Okay.‚Äù O.K.\n\nLast month, entering ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù Macroom, Ireland from the northwest, there‚Äôs a building on the right with a big, dark gray wall. The only thing on the side of the wall, up high, besides a window, is a life-sized painting of a white cat, with a dark shadow. It looks like the cat has jumped from the window, and is partway on its long descent. The effect is very lifelike, but I wondered whether it was distracting enough that it had caused any traffic conflicts on the narrow street into town. It turns out that the cat image had been part of a Guinness mural, but pressure from some in the community caused all of it but the cat and its shadow to get painted over. Apparently there was concern that the mural would corrupt younger residents. It‚Äôs not as if there aren‚Äôt many other places to see Guinness promoted and displayed.\n\nIronically, a town nearby had a mural of the Murphy‚Äôs Stout logo, being painted by a child on a dangling scaffold. Maybe the child painter wasn‚Äôt being corrupted, seeing what he was painting, or maybe he was already corrupted. He wasn‚Äôt having a pint, though, just a paint.\n\nPosted by Mona\n\nCalifornia USA\n\n4003 posts\n\nH is for Hasser√∂de Bier brewed in the Harz area.

Back when ships were the primary means of getting from Britain to India, and sailors were issued their regular ration of beer, that beer needed to withstand the length of the journey without spoiling. By adding extra hops to what would have otherwise been regular Pale Ale, a hoppier, more bitter beverage was created, which also had a longer storage life, and was suitably called india Pale Ale. In the past 25 or so years, IPA seems to have become the darling of the U.S. microbrewing industry, with some varieties just puckeringly bitter. Hops for hops‚Äô sake, making brews that were virtually undrinkable, but unquestionably the hoppiest IPA around, seemed to be their goal. Ska from Colorado and Stone from California are very hoppy, but seldom too hoppy. Others are simply extreme.\n\nBesides classic beers in Britain, I believe that some British IPA‚Äôs have become popular, in the land where IPA began. I haven‚Äôt actually had an IPA across the pond, but there could be one in my future. Maybe one in India, too ‚Ä¶ maybe.\n\nPosted by isn31c\n\nLake District, England\n\n6946 posts\n\nJ is for Jennings Brewery in Cockermouth, England.\n\nThe Company was founded in 1828 i"
