        "text": "Liverpool continue their Champions League campaign with their away trip of the group stage.\n\nTonight they travel to Basel knowing a win would go a long way to sealing their passage from Group B.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about tonight's clash:\n\nWhat time does it start?\n\nThe match will kick off at the St Jakob Park at 7:45pm.\n\nWhat channel is it on?\n\nCoverage of the game will begin on Sky Sports 5 at 7pm.\n\nFacts and stats\n\nFC Basel have lost last two European matches, conceding five goals in both matches. They have not lost three European games in a row since October 2008.\n\nBasel defeated fellow English side Chelsea both home and away in the 2013-14 Champions League group stages.\n\nThese two sides have met just twice before, these coming in the 2002-03 Champions League: they played out two score draws (1-1 and 3-3).\n\nLiverpool have not lost any of their last nine matches against Swiss opponents (W6 D3).\n\nThe last five European games that Liverpool have played against Swiss teams have seen 29 goals scored; an average of 5.8 goals per game.\n\nMario Balotelli only managed two goals and didn't assist a single goal in the 2013-14 CL for AC Milan. He already has one goal in one CL app for Liverpool.\n\nBalotelli has 10 touches in the opposition box on MD1 - no player managed more than this.\n\nBreel Embolo (17y 214d) was one of only two 17 year olds to play on MD1 of the Champions League this season.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nOnes to watch\n\nMarco Streller : Basel-born, vastly experienced forward who at 33 knows every trick in the book and leads the team with an incredible work ethic.\n\nFabian Schär : Central defender who has been linked with almost every big club in Europe – including Liverpool. Massive threat on set-pieces with his heading ability.\n\nDerlis Gonzalez : Lightning quick winger from Paraguay creates and takes chances,\n\nand at just 20 is seen as hugely promising for the future in Basel.\n\nPrevious meetings\n\n2002/03:\n\nFC Basel 3-3 Liverpool (Champions League)\n\nLiverpool 1-1 FC Basel (Champions League)\n\nSee the best pictures from the clash with Ludogorets last time out:\n\nWho's saying what?\n\nPaulo Sousa: “We need to be successful domestically, but we also want to compete in European football so that we can have the likes of Real Madrid and Liverpool here on a regular basis. After that, the target is to beat them and to reach the knockout stages. If we can do that this season then great, but it is early days.”\n\nBrendan Rodgers: “He learnt very early on that you need to prepare. I think that whenever the younger players look how calm Stevie is, they know he has been at that level before. They know he has been right the way through and won the tournament. They can draw inspiration from that. He is calm and, whether it is a Champions League game or a league match, his focus is very much the same. Even here, where the atmosphere is good and you need a calm head to dictate the tempo, there are not many better in world football.\"\n\nWhat's on the line?\n\nP\n\nW\n\nD\n\nL\n\nF\n\nA\n\nPts\n\nReal Madrid\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1\n\n3\n\nLiverpool\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\nLudogorets\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\nBasel\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n5\n\n0\n\nWho's going to win?\n\nBasel: 12/5\n\nLiverpool: 23/20"
