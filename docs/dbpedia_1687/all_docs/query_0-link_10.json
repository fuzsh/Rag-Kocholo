        "text": "4.1. Recognition\n\nThe vast majority of related literature has focused on game style recognition. Historically, explanations for the performance of teams and individual players were based on singular events or isolated behaviors. Basevitch, Yang and Tenenbaum [4], and Castellano and Echeazarra [42] tried to match separate variables with the playing style of teams. Then, they tried to identify variations on the specific variables between the teams. Despite the significance of the information offered by these studies, they cannot cover the complexity of the soccer game, which requires the connection of different performance indicators for recognizing a team’s styles of play or tactical pattern [7,8]. To bridge this gap, Kempe, Vogelbein, Memmert, and Nopp [32], introduced two indexes to differentiate between possession play and direct style. Each index was the sum of z-values of performance indicators considered by the authors to determine game control and offensive behavior. The research was limited by the absence of validation for the two indexes, as the variables employed in their formulation were selected based on the authors’ subjective perceptions. K-means cluster analysis was also used by Gollan, Ferrar, and Norton [36] to recognize playing styles. Three game style clusters were identified: (1) moderately favoring established defense, (2) dominant in transition offense and transition defense, and (3) strong in established offense and set pieces. The disadvantage of this method is that it does neither recognize playing styles, nor is it capable of quantifying them; instead, it categorizes the teams based on the phases in which they excel. Finally, the studies of Drezner, Lamas, Farias, Barrera and Dantas [43], Fernandes, Camerino, Garganta, Hileno and Barreira [46], and Tenga and Larsen [29] relied on the construction of their own models for game style recognition. The first two divided the field into sections (18 and 14, respectively). After recording the sequences of passes throughout each ball possession (from the beginning to its completion), Chi-Square analysis was performed. The first research found different styles between teams for ball circulation, while the second focused on defensive behavior patterns. Due to the time-consuming aspect of studying all ball possession sequences, it is difficult for the aforementioned studies to investigate a large sample of matches. Thus, nine matches were analyzed in the first and 12 in the second. In a match between Norway and Brazil, Tenga and Larsen [29] utilized a similar technique involving the development of their own model and Chi-Square analysis. However, they did not divide the field into zones.\n\nAmong all studies that applied inductive statistics, those that used factor analysis with PCA ( ) were the ones that managed not only to distinguish distinct styles, but also to identify the characteristics of each style (based on the variables that loaded each component). In addition, they were able to quantify playing styles based on the factor scores. Nonetheless, as shown in and , the styles of play identified in published research have not been able to account for all phases and sub-phases of the game. For example, the absence of defensive set pieces can be seen. Despite the fact that, in the research of Gómez, Mitrotasios, Armatas, and Lago-Peñas [8], two factors have been given the names set pieces and free kicks, it is clear (from observing the variables that load them) that they concern the attacking set-pieces and the attacking free-kicks, respectively. This subjectivity in the naming of latent variables is a disadvantage of studies using factor analysis [64]. Factors may not have been correctly labeled, and it should not be assumed that two factors with the same name are the same thing (jingle fallacy) [65]. For example, in the research of Lago-Peñas, Gómez-Ruano, and Yang [34], factors 4 and 5 are given the general name transitional play. However, observing the variables that load the factors, we find that the variables of factor four (lost balls) can only appear in situations of defensive transition, while the variables of factor five (picking up free balls) can only appear in situations of offensive transition. Similarly, Ruan, Ge, Gómez, Shen, Gong, and Cui [50] give factors 6 and 8 the same name (defense of goalkeepers) even though, as the authors report, different teams have higher values in each of them. Moreover, in the study by Gómez, Mitrotasios, Armatas and Lago-Peñas [8], factor four was named counter-attack despite the fact that one of the loaded variables is lost balls, which cannot result in a counter-attack. So, either it should be clarified that the style concerns the game as a whole (for both teams together) or if the authors wish to adopt it as a single team’s style, a more general label (such as transitional play) should be given, which can cover both offensive and defensive transitions. In the same study, factor six is exclusively related to the variable actions in own fourth (they had divided the field into fourths along its length and by own fourth they meant the one near the team’s goal). However, from what has come to our attention, it is unclear why this particular factor was called transitional play and more explanation should be provided by the authors.\n\nTable 3\n\nArticleFactors’ Names[28]Possession style, Crosses, High press [31]Finishing efficiency, Ball possession performance, Counter-attack efficiency, Type of defense (man to man to man/ mixed), Redirection of the opposing team’s attack build-up[33]Possession directness, Width of ball regain, Use of crosses, Possession width, Defensive ball pressure, Progression of the attack[34]Possession style, Set pieces attack, Counterattacking play, Transitional play (2) *[8]Ball possession, Ending actions, Individual challenges, Counter attack, Set pieces, Transitional play, Fouling actions, Free-kick[39]High press, type of attack[47]High intensity play, Possession and passing, Offensive actions, Defensive actions, Individual challenges, Serious fouls, Attacking aggressively[50]Defense close to the own goal, High intensity confrontation, Mid positioning defense with pressure, Error, Defense in advanced zones, Receiving a dangerous situation, Defense of goalkeeper (2) *[51]Constant, Receiving a dangerous situation, Defense closed to the own goal, Error, Keeper claim, High intensity confrontation, Mid-positioning defense with pressure, Defense in advanced zones, Keeper smother\n\nTherefore, although factor analysis is an excellent solution for grouping variables to construct playing styles, special care is required when interpreting and naming components based on the variables that load on them. If this obstacle can be cleared away, then factor analysis could be considered as a valuable tool that offers useful information in distinguishing, identifying and quantifying playing styles. Many playing styles, such as those that concern the first sub-phase of the attack (the “build up from the back”) and others, have yet to be identified in a factor-based study. As examples, we mention the offside trap, which is a very common tactical tool of coaches [66,67,68,69], the passing tempo that gives very useful information about the playing style of a team [12,40,70], the counter-pressing [71,72] and so on. Further, only two studies employing factor analysis with PCA [47,50] had access to physical performance variables. However, they found no association between these variables and the styles emerging from technical-tactical variables. Lastly, despite the fact that nearly all of the aforementioned research referred to phases of the game, none of them gave a structured model classifying the detected styles in the various key moments and sub-phases.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence methods in studies related to the playing styles of teams in soccer has given new dimensions to the research on this specific topic. The first to adopt a simplistic form of artificial intelligence for game style recognition were Gyarmati, Kwak, and Rodriguez [52], who used two clustering techniques (K-means and Ward hierarchical). Both methods showed that Barcelona had a unique style (based on its passing motifs) compared to all the other teams. The same year, Bialkowski, Lucey, Carr, Yue, Sridharan, and Matthews [53], employed K-means clustering and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and distinguished five different styles adopted by teams during matches. Two years later, the same author published a similar article in which agglomerative clustering was also utilized [54]. Brooks, Kerr, and Guttag [55] divided the field into 16 zones and counted the number of passes that originated from each zone. The classification task was then accomplished using K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classifier and a heatmap of pass origins. The field has also been divided into zones (20) by Amatria, Maneiro and Anguera [62]. They recorded the origin and destination of each pass in each distinct sequence of ball possession. At the same time, technical actions (ball control, dribbling) were recorded. Then they applied T-pattern detection to identify patterns of play in possession. Finally, Bekkers and Dabadghao [56] used a mean shift algorithm to cluster teams based on their passing motifs, where four clusters emerged.\n\nNarizuka and Yamazaki [57] adopted the Delaunay network to get (as adjacency matrix A(t)) the formation of a team at time t. Then, using hierarchical clustering, they obtained not only the average formation (i.e., “442”, “4141”, “433”, “541” or “343”) for each team in the match but also the positional exchange of players within the match formations. Decroos, Roy, and Davis [58] used mixture models to achieve a representation of soccer actions. In the first stage, for each action type, a mixture model was fitted to the locations (x, y). Then, for each component of each mixture model in stage 1, a new mixture model was fitted to the directions of the actions in that component. Using the learned mixture models, each action was encoded as a weight vector. It was concluded that using specific vectors, game styles could be identified based on each type of action. Finally, García-Aliaga, Marquina Nieto, Coterón, Rodríguez-González, Gil Ares, and Refoyo Román [60] employed the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) clustering algorithm, which can process large multivariate datasets and visualize them into a 2D plot [73]. Consequently, the various placements of the teams in the plots reflect the disparity between their playing styles.\n\nAs demonstrated above, a small number of studies focused solely on the possession phase of the ball [52,55,56,62]. The studies of Bialkowski, Lucey, Carr, Yue, Sridharan, and Matthews [53], Bialkowski, Lucey, Carr, Matthews, Sridharan. and Fookes [54], and Narizuka and Yamazaki [57] reached only conclusions regarding team formations. Bialkowski, Lucey, Carr, Yue, Sridharan, and Matthews [53] and Bialkowski, Lucey, Carr, Matthews, Sridharan, and Fookes [54] distinguished five different styles of play, however without information about the characteristics of each style, they are of limited practical value to coaches. After classifying the teams, García-Aliaga, Marquina Nieto, Coterón, Rodríguez-González, Gil Ares, and Refoyo Román [60], used the RIPPER method to find the variables that contribute most to the categorization of the teams. This has practical value, as opposed to simply grouping things together. The vectors of the actions which were created in the research of Decroos, Roy, and Davis [58] gave more information than simple numbers, but they also refer to separate variables. However, the ability to examine them simultaneously can provide valuable information to the coaching staff.\n\n4.2. Contextual Variables\n\nContextual variables (specific match factors) have an impact on competitive demands and influence performance metrics [74,75]. In recent years, there has been a strong tendency to study the effect of contextual variables on the teams’ adoption of different playing styles. As shown in and , twelve of the thirteen relevant studies were conducted from 2018 onwards. The Treemap in shows that the majority of studies have explored the effect of match location. Particularly, Lago [30], Santos, Lago-Peñas, and García-García [35], Gómez, Mitrotasios, Armatas, and Lago-Peñas [8], Fernandez-Navarro, Fradua, Zubillaga, and McRobert [37], Bekkers and Dabadghao [56], Gollan, Bellenger, and Norton [44], and Gonzalez-Rodenas, Aranda, and Aranda-Malaves [45], dealt with the impact of the variable match location on the playing styles adopted by the teams. From all the above studies it seemed that home teams tried to build up from the back, rather than adopt direct play, resulting in a more combinational, possession-based style of play. They also seemed to try to speed up the match and press their opponents high, whereas in general, their game was more offensive.\n\nTeam’s ranking, opponent’s ranking, and match status are also variables whose effect on playing styles has been studied extensively. The research of Gonzalez-Rodenas, Aranda, and Aranda-Malaves [45], showed that high-ranked teams were less likely to use direct attacks than combinative attacks in comparison with low-ranked teams. García-Aliaga, Marquina Nieto, Coterón, Rodríguez-González, Gil Ares, and Refoyo Román [60] found that the top-ranked teams in the EPL differentiated from the rest of the teams in the same league by making less long passes, playing more vertically, even at the expense of accuracy, and dribbling. In [44], using EPL data of the 2015–2016 season in which Leicester shocked the league by winning it, it was demonstrated that established defense was prevalent among lower-ranked teams, while the champion was dominant in transitions and the rest of the high-ranked teams dominated established attack and set pieces. In this case, there appears to be a disadvantage associated with studies that collect their sample data from a single competition or, even worse, from a small number of matches. In such cases, generalizing the outcomes is inherently risky, as teams like Leicester, for instance, rarely win the league. As shown in , only 13 of the 40 studies processed data from more than one competition. As demonstrated by Lago [30], Santos, Lago-Peñas, and García-García [35], Fernandes, Camerino, Garganta, Hileno, and Barreira [46], Gollan, Bellenger, and Norton [44], and Gonzalez-Rodenas, Aranda, and Aranda-Malaves [45], the quality of the opposition exhibited similar trends with math location. Finally, match status appears to influence the adoption of different playing styles significantly. In particular, winning teams present higher probabilities of attacking by means of counterattacks and direct attacks than combinative attacks compared to losing teams. In addition, they apply high pressure less frequently [37,41,45,46].\n\nHowever, there are some contextual variables whose effect on playing styles has received little or no attention. Comparisons between different competitions were performed amongst the top four leagues in Europe according to the UEFA ranking (English, Spanish, German, and Italian). Although Gonzalez-Rodenas, Aranda, and Aranda-Malaves [45] found no statistically significant differences between the English and Spanish leagues during the 2017–2018 season, Mitrotasios, Gonzalez-Rodenas, Armatas, and Aranda [40] discovered that Spain La Liga had a higher proportion of long and combinative attacks, the English Premier League had a higher tendency of progressing through fast and direct attacks, the German Bundesliga had the most counter-attacks, and the Italian Serie A had the shortest offensive sequences as well as a higher proportion of counter-attacks and direct attacks than combinative and fast attacks. García-Aliaga, Marquina Nieto, Coterón, Rodríguez-González, Gil Ares, and Refoyo Román [60] found a distinction between the English teams and the rest of the teams in the other leagues, determined by fewer free kicks, fewer long passes but more vertical, more errors in ball control, and greater success in dribbling, using data from the specific four countries from five different seasons (from 2014/2015 to 2018/2019).\n\nThe effect of match half time (first or second) was examined in two studies. One for the attacking phase [45] and one for the defensive phase [46]. The first found that progressing by counterattacks was less likely in the first half than progressing with combinative attacks in the second half. In the latter, the national teams of Germany and Argentina displayed defensive tactics in the second half that did not exist in full matches. The effect of five contextual variables on the playing styles (type of grass, stage of the competition, coaches, changes along years, and opponent’s style) was explored in just one study for each variable. Andersson, Ekblom, and Krustrup [3] observed fewer sliding tackles and more short passes during games on artificial turf as compared to natural grass. According to Yi, Gómez, Wang, Huang, Zhang, and Liu [63], teams performed better in passing, pass accuracy, and delivery into the attacking third when playing against direct-play teams than when playing against possession-play teams. Bekkers and Dabadghao [56] found that when teams change managers, their flow motifs change, adopting the style of the specific manager’s prior teams. Fernandes, Camerino, Garganta, Hileno, and Barreira [46] found that some teams may change defensive patterns along stages. Finally, Zhou, Lago-Peñas, Lorenzo, and Gómez [47] found that high-intensity play and offensive actions of Chinese SL increased substantially with time (from 2012 to 2017). It is impressive that the effect of formation on the playing style of teams has not yet been studied, despite that fact that it is an important element of their tactics [76], while the scientific literature has already shown that it affects physical and technical performance indicators [77,78]. The effect of other contextual variables could also be studied, such as the period of the season [79] or the market value of the teams [80]."
