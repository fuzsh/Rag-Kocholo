        "text": "Danilo’s penalty ten minutes from time gave Porto a deserved draw and a precious away goal at Basel as their tetchy Champions League round-of-16 first-leg clash ended 1-1.\n\nThe Swiss side took an early lead when Fabian Frei played an outstanding 40-yard pass for Derlis Gonzalez, who controlled it beautifully before sliding it past the onrushing Fabiano.\n\nRemarkably, that was to be the Swiss side’s only shot all game as they surrendered all control to the Portuguese visitors.\n\nTransfers\n\nTottenham may face AC Milan battle for Fulham defender Adarabioyo - Paper Round\n\n14/04/2024 at 08:00\n\nPorto thought they had equalised just after half-time, only for Casemiro’s finish on the rebound to be ruled out by Mark Clattenburg for interference from two Porto players in front of the goalkeeper.\n\nThe visitors had finished celebrating and were back on the halfway line when Clattenburg, after a long consultation with his linesman, disallowed Casemiro's goal for offside.\n\nDanilo, who was Porto’s star man on the night, ensured a potentially frustrating night ended on a high, however, winning a penalty when his low cross was blocked by Walter Samuel’s arm, before driving the spot-kick into the bottom left corner.\n\nBasel's Paraguayan midfielder Derlis Gonzalez (L) vies with Porto's Brazilian defender Alex Sandro during the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg football match between Basel (FCB) and Porto (FCP) at the St. Jakob-Park stadium (AFP)\n\nImage credit: AFP\n\nKEY MOMENTS\n\n10’ – GOAL! Basel 1-0 Porto. First attack, first goal! It's a fantastic touch from Derlis Gonzalez, after a wonderful long ball forward by Frei, and he gets away from Marcano and Alex Sandro in the Porto defence brilliantly. Bursting through on goal, the Paraguayan confidently slides the ball home with goalkeeper Fabiano closing in.\n\n30’ – PENALTY APPEAL: Tello feeds a low cross in to Jackson Martinez from the right wing and the Colombian controls it well with his back to goal before he appears to be hauled down by Walter Samuel. Nothing is given by Mark Clattenburg but it probably should have been a penalty.\n\n49’ – DISALLOWED GOAL: It seems certain that Porto had equalised as Casemiro pokes in after Maicon's header was parried away by Vaclik. The players celebrate but Mark Clattenburg eventually rules it out after the linesman spotted two Porto players in front of the goalkeeper who were interfering with play. Great decision.\n\n58’ – CHANCE: Good save by Veclik as Tello gets in behind after a brilliant hooked pass from Herrera. The Spaniard hares towards goal and drives the ball towards the near post, but Veclik has his angles covered.\n\n79’ – GOAL! Basel 1-1 Porto. Danilo wins a penalty after his low cross from the right hits Walter Samuel on the arm. The Brazilian fullback takes the spot-kick himself and confidently knocks into the bottom left-hand corner.\n\nPorto's Casemiro (2L) scores a disallowed goal during their Champions League round of 16 first leg soccer match against FC Basel.\n\nImage credit: Reuters\n\nKEY STATS\n\nMark Clattenburg gave nine yellow cards in the game, the most in any Champions League game this season.\n\nFC Basel's Derlis Gonzalez (R) scores a goal against Porto's goalkeeper Fabiano during their Champions League round of 16.\n\nImage credit: Reuters\n\nTALKING POINT\n\nWhy did Basel show so little ambition? Having taken an early lead it was frustrating to see the Swiss side sit back for the next 70 minutes of the game before finally conceding the equaliser. To manage just one shot all game was a feeble effort and they now have to score in the return leg to have any chance of going through.\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH\n\nDanilo (Porto): The Brazilian international won and scored his side’s late penalty and was a driving force for the visitors all game, getting beyond Tello and providing a threat on the overlap. On this evidence it's easy to see why he's seen as Brazil’s new first-choice right-back.\n\nPLAYER RATINGS\n\nFC BASEL: Vaclik 7, Xhaka 7, Suchy 7, Samuel 6, Safari 6, Elneny 6, Frei 7, Zuffi 5, Gonzalez 7, Streller 5, Gashi 5. Subs: Hamoudi 5, Embolo 6, Calla 6.\n\nFC PORTO: Fabiano 6, Danilo 8, Maicon 6, Marcano Sierra 6, Alex Sandro 6, Herrera 7, Casemiro 6, Oliver 7, Tello 5, Martinez 6, Brahimi 6. Subs: Quaresma 6, Quintero 6, Neves 6.\n\nMATCH IN A TWEET\n\nChampions League\n\nConceicao accuses Arteta of 'insulting my family' after Arsenal beat Porto\n\n13/03/2024 at 10:27\n\nChampions League\n\n'Ticking along beautifully' - Keown says Arsenal will fancy Champions League chances\n\n13/03/2024 at 07:30"
