        "text": "Player Profile\n\nName\n\nRiccardo Calafiori\n\nSquad number\n\n33\n\nBorn\n\nMarch 19, 2002/Rome\n\nNational team\n\nItaly\n\nItaly international Riccardo Calafiori joined us from Serie A side Bologna in July 2024, having been a member of the Azzurri squad at Euro 2024.\n\nRiccardo started his career in the youth academy at Roma, where he spent 12 years developing from the youth set-up into the first-team. During his time there, he gained valuable experience on loan at fellow Italian side Genoa during the 2021/22 season.\n\nIn August 2022, the young defender, who has represented his national team at every age group, moved to Swiss side Basel, where he was a regular and made 26 league appearances that season. His high-quality performances resulted in a return to his homeland, with the imposing defender transferring to Bologna in August 2023.\n\nLast season, Riccardo was a leading figure in their backline, emerging as one of the strongest and most consistent performers in Serie A. He played an integral role in helping ‘I Rossoblu’ to an impressive fifth position and Champions League qualification for the first time in 60 years. Riccardo’s dominant and physical performances were not only recognised with his Euros call-up, but by him also winning the Serie A Player of the Month for May 2024."
