        "text": "Lavras do Sul: A New Equilibrated Ordinary L5 Chondrite from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZucolotto, M. E.; Antonello, L. L.; Varela, M. E.; Scorzelli, R. B.; Ludka, Isabel P.; Munayco, P.; dos Santos, E.\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe new Brazilian chondrite, Lavras do Sul, was found in 1985 at Lavras do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul State-Brazil (33Â°30'48â³S; 53Â°54'65â³W). It consists of a single mass weighing about 1 kg, covered by a black fusion crust with grayish interior. Four polished thin sections were prepared from a slice weighing 67 g on deposit at the Museu Nacional/UFRJ. It consists mostly of chondrules and chondrule fragments dispersed in a recrystallized matrix. Most chondrules are poorly defined and range in size from 300 to 2,000 Î¼m, although some of them show distinct outlines, particularly when viewed under cross-polarized transmitted and reflected light. The texture of chondrules varies from non-porphyritic (e.g., barred-olivine, radial-pyroxene) to porphyritic ones (e.g., granular olivine as well as olivine-pyroxene). The meteorite contains mainly olivine (Fa24.9), low-Ca pyroxene (Fs22.6) and metal phases, with minor amounts of plagioclase, chromite and magnetite. MÃ¶ssbauer Spectroscopy studies indicate that the metal phase is kamacite, tetrataenite and antitaenite. Veins of secondary iddingsite crosscut the thin section and some ferromagnesian silicates. The chemical composition indicates that Lavras do Sul is a member of the low iron L chondrite group. The poorly delineated chondritic texture with few well-defined chondrules, the occurrence of rare clinopyroxene and plagioclase (and maskelynite) with apparent diameters ranging from 5 to 123 Î¼m led us to classify Lavras do Sul as an equilibrated petrologic type 5. The shock features of some minerals suggest a shock stage S3, and the presence of a small amount of secondary minerals such as iddingsite and goethite, a degree of weathering W1. The meteorite name was approved by the Nomenclature Committee (Nom Com) of the Meteoritical Society (Meteoritic Bulletin NÂº99).\n\nLAGO: The Latin American giant observatory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSidelnik, IvÃ¡n; Asorey, HernÃ¡n; LAGO Collaboration\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) is an extended cosmic ray observatory composed of a network of water-Cherenkov detectors (WCD) spanning over different sites located at significantly different altitudes (from sea level up to more than 5000 m a.s.l.) and latitudes across Latin America, covering a wide range of geomagnetic rigidity cut-offs and atmospheric absorption/reaction levels. The LAGO WCD is simple and robust, and incorporates several integrated devices to allow time synchronization, autonomous operation, on board data analysis, as well as remote control and automated data transfer. This detection network is designed to make detailed measurements of the temporal evolution of the radiation flux coming from outer space at ground level. LAGO is mainly oriented to perform basic research in three areas: high energy phenomena, space weather and atmospheric radiation at ground level. It is an observatory designed, built and operated by the LAGO Collaboration, a non-centralized collaborative union of more than 30 institutions from ten countries. In this paper we describe the scientific and academic goals of the LAGO project - illustrating its present status with some recent results - and outline its future perspectives.\n\nSedimentation Survey of Lago Guerrero, Puerto Rico, May 2001\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nLago Guerrero, a small reservoir owned by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, is part of the Isabela Hydroelectric System and is located in Aguadilla, in northwestern Puerto Rico. The reservoir had a storage capacity of about 127,376 cubic meters in May 2001 and a maximum depth of about 5.8 meters. Records on dam construction and original topography and storage capacity were not available; therefore, sedimentation rates could not be determined. However, Lago Guerrero resumably was constructed during the 1930?s because it receives water from lago Guajataca, which was constructed in 1928. The May 2001 bathymetric survey of Lago Guerrero established baseline data that are essential to calculate sedimentation rates, sediment yields, storage loss, and sediment deposition sites within the reservoir.\n\nSedimentation Survey of Lago Icacos, Puerto Rico, March 2004\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Lago Icacos, a small reservoir built in 1930 and owned by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, is part of the Rio Blanco Hydroelectric Power System. The reservoir is located in Naguabo, within the Caribbean National Forest in eastern Puerto Rico. The original storage capacity of the reservoir was 19,119 cubic meters in 1930. The bathymetric survey conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in March 2004 indicates a storage capacity of 7,435 cubic meters or 39 percent of the original storage capacity, and a maximum depth of 5.3 meters. The reservoir has been dredged several times to restore lost storage capacity caused by high sediment loads and the frequent landslides that occur upstream from the dam, which have partially or completely filled the Lago Icacos. Because sediment removal activities have not been documented, sedimentation rates could not be determined using storage volume comparisons. A reservoir sedimentation rate was calculated using the daily sediment load data gathered at the U.S. Geological Survey Rio Icacos streamflow station upstream of the reservoir, the estimated Lago Icacos sediment trapping efficiency, and the estimated sediment yield of the Lago Icacos basin extrapolated from the Rio Icacos sediment load data. Using these properties, the Lago Icacos sedimentation rate was estimated as 71 cubic meters per year, equivalent to about 1 percent of the original storage capacity per year. The Lago Icacos 7.47-square-kilometer drainage area sediment yield was estimated as 7,126 tonnes per year or about 954 tonnes per square kilometer per year. Based on the current estimated sedimentation rate of 71 cubic meters per year, Lago Icacos has a useful life of about 105 years or to year 2109.\n\nSedimentation survey of Lago Caonillas, Puerto Rico, February 2000\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nBased on the ratio of storage capacity to inflow rate, the estimated trapping efficiency of Lago Caonillas is about 93 percent for 2000. The sediment yield of the Lago Caonillas net sediment-contributing drainage area (total drainage area minus the reservoir surface area) of 218.74 square kilometers, is about 1 ,266 megagrams per square kilometer per year. This represents an increase of about 69 percent in the material transport and deposition process of the Lago Caonillas basin between 1990 and 2000. The life expectancy of Lago Caonillas was more than 300 years in 1995; however, at the storm-accelerated sedimentation rate, the life expectancy has decreased to about 164 years. This implies that the reservoir could be filled with sediments by the year 2164 if major hurricanes continue to pass through Puerto Rico regularly (every 2 to 4 years).\n\nSedimentation History of Lago Dos Bocas, Puerto Rico, 1942-2005\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Lago Dos Bocas Dam, located in the municipality of Utuado in north central Puerto Rico, was constructed in 1942 for hydroelectric power generation. The reservoir had an original storage capacity of 37.50 million cubic meters and a drainage area of 440 square kilometers. In 1948, the construction of the Lago Caonillas Dam on the Rio Caonillas branch of Lago Dos Bocas reduced the natural sediment-contributing drainage area to 310 square kilometers; therefore, the Lago Caonillas Dam is considered an effective sediment trap. Sedimentation in Lago Dos Bocas reservoir has reduced the storage capacity from 37.50 million cubic meters in 1942 to 17.26 million cubic meters in 2005, which represents a storage loss of about 54 percent. The long-term annual water-storage capacity loss rate remained nearly constant at about 320,000 cubic meters per year to about 1997. The inter-survey sedimentation rate between 1997 and 1999, however, is higher than the long-term rate at about 1.09 million cubic meters per year. Between 1999 and 2005 the rate is lower than the long-term rate at about 0.13 million cubic meters per year. The Lago Dos Bocas effective sediment-contributing drainage area had an average sediment yield of about 1,400 cubic meters per square kilometer per year between 1942 and 1997. This rate increased substantially by 1999 to about 4,600 cubic meters per square kilometer per year, probably resulting from the historical magnitude floods caused by Hurricane Georges in 1998. Recent data indicate that the Lago Dos Bocas drainage area sediment yield decreased substantially to about 570 cubic meters per square kilometer per year, which is much lower than the 1942-1997 area normalized sedimentation rate of 1,235 cubic meters per square kilometer per year. The impact of Hurricane Georges on the basin sediment yield could have been the cause of this change, since the magnitude of the floods could have nearly depleted the Lago Dos Bocas drainage area of easily erodible and\n\nSedimentation survey of Lago de Matrullas, Puerto Rico, December 2001\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nLago de Matrullas reservoir, constructed in 1934, is located at an altitude of approximately 730 meters above mean sea level in the municipality of Orocovis in central Puerto Rico, and has a drainage area of 11.45 square kilometers. The reservoir is part of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority Toro Negro Hydroelectric Project, which also includes the Lago El Guineo reservoir and a hydroelectric plant to the south of the insular hydrographic divide. Historically, the drainage area had been protected from soil erosion by dense vegetation and the lack of basin development. However, transportation, potable water, and electric power infrastructure construction has facilitated development in rural areas resulting in the clearing of land. This trend in land-use changes is impacting the useful life of Lago de Matrullas. The reservoir storage capacity has been reduced from 3.71 million cubic meters in 1934 to 3.08 million cubic meters in 2001. This represents a total storage-capacity loss of 0.63 million cubic meters by 2001 (17 percent), or a long-term annual storage loss of 0.25 percent per year. The sediment trapping efficiency of Lago de Matrullas has been estimated at approximately 90 percent. If the current long-term sedimentation rate continues, Lago de Matrullas would fill by the year 2328. However, this life expectancy could be reduced at a faster than predicted rate as a result of rural development in the Lago de Matrullas basin and the high sediment trapping efficiency of the reservoir.\n\nAssessment of radiation protection practices among radiographers in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nEze, Cletus Uche; Abonyi, Livinus Chibuzo; Njoku, Jerome; Irurhe, Nicholas Kayode; Olowu, Oluwabola\n\n2013-11-01\n\nUse of ionising radiation in diagnostic radiography could lead to hazards such as somatic and genetic damages. Compliance to safe work and radiation protection practices could mitigate such risks. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge and radiation protection practices among radiographers in Lagos, Nigeria. The study was a prospective cross sectional survey. Convenience sampling technique was used to select four x-ray diagnostic centres in four tertiary hospitals in Lagos metropolis. Data were analysed with Epi- info software, version 3.5.1. Average score on assessment of knowledge was 73%. Most modern radiation protection instruments were lacking in all the centres studied. Application of shielding devices such as gonad shield for protection was neglected mostly in government hospitals. Most x-ray machines were quite old and evidence of quality assurance tests performed on such machines were lacking. Radiographers within Lagos metropolis showed an excellent knowledge of radiation protection within the study period. Adherence to radiation protection practices among radiographers in Lagos metropolis during the period studied was, however, poor. Radiographers in Lagos, Nigeria should embrace current trends in radiation protection and make more concerted efforts to apply their knowledge in protecting themselves and patients from harmful effects of ionising radiation.\n\nTEMPOROMANDIBULAR PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME IN PATIENTS ATTENDING LAGOS UNIVERSITY TEACHING HOSPITAL, LAGOS, NIGERIA.\n\nPubMed\n\nEweka, O M; Ogundana, O M; Agbelusi, G A\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTemporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome (TMJPDS) is the most common temporomandibular disorder. This condition presents with symptoms of pain, restricted jaw movement and joint noise. Other symptoms include otalgia, headache, neck pain and trismus. To determine the pattern of Temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome patients managed at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria. A descriptive study of patients with signs and symptoms of Temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome attending the Oral Medicine Clinic of Lagos University Teaching Hospital. Twenty-one patients with Temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome were enrolled into the study, out of which 10(48%) were females and 11(52%) were males. The age range was 23-81years with a mean of 45.2 Â± 18.9 years. Majority of the patients 20(95.2%) complained of pain around the joint, in the pre-auricular region, in the muscles of mastication and the ear. While 7(35%) complained of clicking sounds, 10(47.6%) complained of pain on mouth opening and during mastication only. In all 5(23.8%) had impaired movement of the jaws, mouth opening was normal in 18(85.7%) but reduced in 3(14.3%) patients. Over half of patients 12(57%) experienced clicking sounds, there was tenderness around the temporomandibular joint in 16(76.2%) cases, pain in the ear of 7(33.3%) patients and 13(61.9%) people presented with tenderness of the muscles of mastication. Conservative management of all the cases resulted in resolution of the symptoms. Temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome has diverse clinical presentation and though distressing, it responds to prompt and effective conservative management.\n\nSedimentation Survey of Lago El Guineo, Puerto Rico, October 2001\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nLago El Guineo has lost about 17.5 percent of its original storage capacity in 70 years because of sediment accumulation. The water volume has been reduced from 2.29 million cubic meters in 1931, to 2.03 million cubic meters in 1986, and to 1.89 million cubic meters in 2001. The average annual storage-capacity loss (equal to the sedimentation rate) of Lago El Guineo was 4,727 cubic meters for the period of 1931 to July 1986 (or 0.21 percent per year), increasing to 5,714 cubic meters for the period of 1931 to October 2001 (or 0.25 percent per year). Discrepancies that could lead to substantial errors in volume calculations in a small reservoir like Lago El Guineo, were found when transferring the field-collected data into the geographic information system data base 1:20,000 U.S. Geological Survey Jayuya, Puerto Rico quadrangle. After verification and validation of field data, the Lago El Guineo shoreline was rectified using digital aerial photographs and differential global positioning data.\n\nMigration of 137Cs in tributaries, lake water and sediment of Lago Maggiore (Italy, Switzerland) - analysis and comparison with Lago di Lugano and other lakes.\n\nPubMed\n\nPutyrskaya, Victoria; Klemt, Eckehard; RÃ¶llin, Stefan\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis paper describes the behaviour of 137Cs in Lago Maggiore and other pre-alpine lakes as a consequence of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing fallout and the fallout from the nuclear accident in Chernobyl. It presents data on the 137Cs distribution in tributaries, lake water, bottom sediments and reveals the role of (137)Cs as a marker of the sedimentation processes. The run-off of 137Cs from the watershed to the lake is described with a simple compartment model. Measurements of the activity concentration of (137)Cs in sediments are compared with the output of a model (diffusion-convection type) which describes the input of 137Cs into and its vertical distribution within the sediment. Varying sedimentation rates (0.05-0.90g(cm2y)(-1)) in Lago Maggiore are compared with data of other authors. Sedimentation rates and total distribution coefficients (of about 10(5) Lkg(-1)) in Lago Maggiore are discussed and compared with those of Lago di Lugano, Lake Constance, and Lake Vorsee.\n\nDam failure analysis for the Lago El Guineo Dam, Orocovis, Puerto Rico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGÃ³mez-Fragoso, Julieta; Heriberto Torres-Sierra,\n\n2016-08-09\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, completed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses to assess the potential hazard to human life and property associated with the hypothetical failure of the Lago El Guineo Dam. The Lago El Guineo Dam is within the headwaters of the RÃ­o Grande de ManatÃ­ and impounds a drainage area of about 4.25 square kilometers.The hydrologic assessment was designed to determine the outflow hydrographs and peak discharges for Lago El Guineo and other subbasins in the RÃ­o Grande de ManatÃ­ hydrographic basin for three extreme rainfall events: (1) a 6-hour probable maximum precipitation event, (2) a 24-hour probable maximum precipitation event, and (3) a 24-hour, 100-year recurrence rainfall event. The hydraulic study simulated a dam failure of Lago El Guineo Dam using flood hydrographs generated from the hydrologic study. The simulated dam failure generated a hydrograph that was routed downstream from Lago El Guineo Dam through the lower reaches of the RÃ­o Toro Negro and the RÃ­o Grande de ManatÃ­ to determine water-surface profiles developed from the event-based hydrologic scenarios and âsunny dayâ conditions. The Hydrologic Engineering Centerâs Hydrologic Modeling System (HECâHMS) and Hydrologic Engineering Centerâs River Analysis System (HECâRAS) computer programs, developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, were used for the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, respectively. The flow routing in the hydraulic analyses was completed using the unsteady flow module available in the HECâRAS model.Above the Lago El Guineo Dam, the simulated inflow peak discharges from HECâHMS resulted in about 550 and 414 cubic meters per second for the 6- and 24-hour probable maximum precipitation events, respectively. The 24-hour, 100-year recurrence storm simulation resulted in a peak discharge of about 216 cubic meters per second. For the hydrologic analysis, no dam failure conditions are\n\nDocumenting 35 years of land cover change: Lago Cachet Dos drainage, Chile\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFriesen, Beverly A.; Nimick, David A.; Mcgrath, Daniel; Cole, Christopher J.; Wilson, Earl M.; Noble, Suzanne M.; Fahey, Mark J.; Leidich, Jonathan; O'Kuinghttons Villena, Jorge I.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Special Applications Science Center is monitoring temporal changes at the Colonia Glacier and Lago Cachet Dos, Northern Patagonia Icefield of southern Chile. This location is one of the newest international sites in the USGS Global Fiducial Program (GFP)âa program which provides systematic monitoring of dynamic and environmentally critical areas with high-resolution imagery (http://gfp.usgs.gov/). In 2008, Lago Cachet Dos began experiencing glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) during which the entire pool of water (about 200 million cubic meters) rapidly drains from the lake and flows south-southeast through the Colonia Glacier. These catastrophic events cause massive erosion of valley-fill deposits and consequent upstream expansion of Lago Cachet Dos towards Lago Cachet Uno.Â Panchromatic and multispectral images for 1979, 2007, and 2014 highlight the dramatic changes that have occurred at this site over a 35-year period. The lake was smallest in 1979, when the Colonia Glacier was at its maximum extent during the study period. Between 1979 and 2007, the glacier shrank causing an increase in the surface area of the lake. The size of the lake increased substantially, from 2.98 square kilometers (km2) in 1979 to 4.41 km2Â in 2014, primarily due to erosion of valley-fill deposits upstream of its northern edge by the 15 GLOFs that occurred between April 2008 and February 2014. Ongoing studies of the Colonia Glacier and Lago Cachet Dos are focused on providing real-time monitoring of Lago Cachet Dos lake levels, understanding the history of advances and retreats of the Colonia Glacier, and determining the physical mechanisms and hazards associated with the GLOFs that come from Lago Cachet Dos.\n\nInfertility in Women: Hysterosalpingographic Assessment of the Fallopian Tubes in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAkinola, R. A.; Akinola, O. I.; Fabamwo, A. O.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTubal disease constitutes a major factor in infertility especially in developing countries. This study was undertaken to assess the hysterosalpingographic patterns seen in infertile patients in an urban centre in Lagos. Two hundred and twenty patients who reported from the gynaecology clinic to the radiology department of Lagos State Universityâ¦\n\nSedimentation survey of Lago Caonillas, Utuado, Puerto Rico, SeptemberâNovember 2012\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-Lopez, Luis R.\n\n2016-11-09\n\nDuring SeptemberâNovember 2012, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, conducted a sedimentation survey of Lago Caonillas to estimate current (2012) reservoir storage capacity and the recent (2000â2012) reservoir sedimentation rate by comparing the 2012 bathymetric survey data with the February 2000 data. The Lago Caonillas storage capacity, which was 42.27 million cubic meters in February 2000, decreased to 39.55 million cubic meters by SeptemberâNovember 2012. The intersurvey (2000â2012) storage capacity loss was about 6 percent, corresponding to a decrease of about 0.5 percent per year; this loss represents a reservoir sedimentation rate of about 226,670 cubic meters per year between 2000 and 2012. On a long-term basis, however, the sedimentation rate has remained nearly constant, decreasing from about 257,500 to 251,720 cubic meters per year during 1948â2000 and 1948â2012, respectively. Most of the sediment accumulation and associated storage capacity loss of Lago Caonillas has occurred within the eastern and RÃ­o Caonillas branches of the reservoir. In the vicinity of the Caonillas Dam, minor sediment deposition and scour have occurred. The Lago Caonillas drainage area sediment yield has decreased by about 2 percent since the previous survey, from 1,266 cubic meters per square kilometer per year in 2000 to 1,237 cubic meters per square kilometer per year in 2012. If the long-term sedimentation rate of 251,720 cubic meters per year remains constant, the useful life of Lago Caonillas may end in about 2169.\n\nRoad Traffic Injury in Lagos, Nigeria: Assessing Prehospital Care.\n\nPubMed\n\nIbrahim, Nasiru A; Ajani, Abdul Wahab O; Mustafa, Ibrahim A; Balogun, Rufai A; Oludara, Mobolaji A; Idowu, Olufemi E; Solagberu, Babatunde A\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIntroduction Injuries are the third most important cause of overall deaths globally with one-quarter resulting from road traffic crashes. Majority of these deaths occur before arrival in the hospital and can be reduced with prompt and efficient prehospital care. The aim of this study was to highlight the burden of road traffic injury (RTI) in Lagos, Nigeria and assess the effectiveness of prehospital care, especially the role of Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS) in providing initial care and transportation of the injured to the hospital. A three-year, retrospective review of road traffic injured patients seen at the Surgical Emergency Room (SER) of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, Nigeria, from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 was conducted. Parameters extracted from the Institution Trauma Registry included bio-data, date and time of injury, date and time of arrival in SER, host status, type of vehicle involved, and region(s) injured. Information on how patients came to the hospital and outcome in SER also were recorded. Results were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS; IBM Corporation; Armonk, New York USA) version 16. A total of 23,537 patients were seen during the study period. Among them, 16,024 (68.1%) had trauma. Road traffic crashes were responsible in 5,629 (35.0%) of trauma cases. Passengers constituted 42.0% of the injured, followed by pedestrians (34.0%). Four wheelers were the most frequent vehicle type involved (54.0%), followed by motor cycles (30.0%). Regions mainly affected were head and neck (40.0%) and lower limb (29.0%). Less than one-quarter (24.0%) presented to the emergency room within an hour, while one-third arrived between one and six hours following injury. Relatives brought 55.4%, followed by bystanders (21.4%). Only 2.3% had formal prehospital care and were brought to the hospital by LASAMBUS. They also had significantly shorter arrival time. One hundred and nine patients\n\nHalitosis amongst students in tertiary institutions in Lagos state.\n\nPubMed\n\nArinola, J E; Olukoju, O O\n\n2012-12-01\n\nHalitosis is defined as a noticeable unpleasant odor from the mouth. It is a medico-social problem that affects a significant number of people around the world. Research reveals that nearly 50% of the adult population has halitosis. To determine level of awareness of halitosis and prevalence of the condition amongst students in tertiary institutions as a baseline survey. For this project, 100 students from three tertiary institutions in Lagos state were chosen: University of Lagos, Lagos State University, Ojo campus and Yaba College of Technology. A semi-structured questionnaire and practical testing/diagnostic tool were utilized. Data collected was collated and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2007 and SPSS statistical software. Most of the respondents were single and Christian. Level of awareness of halitosis was high. Results showed that 15%, 2% and 22% from UNILAG, LASU and YCT respectively said they had halitosis. Using the diagnostic tool, 6%, 8% and 2% respectively were positive for halitosis. There is high level of awareness of halitosis among the respondents. The prevalence of the disorder is low, however, it is recommended that enlightenment campaigns be mounted in schools to improve level of awareness and treatment seeking.\n\nSedimentation Survey of Lago Guerrero, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, March 2006\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nLago Guerrero is located in Aguadilla, northwestern Puerto Rico (fig. 1). The reservoir has a surface area of about 32,000 square meters and is excavated in Aymamon Limestone of Miocene age. This bedrock consists of chalk interbed-ded with solution-riddled hard limestone (Monroe, 1969). The reservoir was constructed in the 1930s as part of the Isabela Hydroelectric System to regulate flows to two hydroelectric plants-Central Isabel No. 2, at an elevation of about 110 meters above mean sea level, and Central Isabel No. 3, at about 55 meters above mean sea level. Hydroelectric power generation was discontinued during the early 1960s, although the exact date is unknown (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, written commun., 2007). The principal use of the reservoir since then has been to regulate flow to two public-supply water filtration plants and supply irrigation water for the Aguadilla area. Flow into the reservoir is derived from Lago Guajataca through a 26-kilometer-long Canal Principal de Diversion concrete canal (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, written commun., 2001). Additional inflow occurs on an incidental basis only during intensive rainfall from the immediate drainage area. The present Lago Guerrero drainage area is undetermined, due to the irregular and complex topography of the limestone terrain and anthropogenic modifications to the stormwater drainage system. Stormwater runoff, however, is presumed to be negligible compared to the almost constant inflow to the reservoir of about 59,300 cubic meters per day from Lago Guajataca (CSA Group, 2000). On March 9, 2006, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Caribbean Water Science Center, in cooperation with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), conducted a bathymetric survey of Lago Guerrero to determine the storage capacity of the reservoir and sedimentation amount since a previous survey conducted on May 30, 2001. The March 2006 survey was made to develop a bathymetric map of the reservoir\n\nSedimentation survey of Lago Cerrillos, Ponce, Puerto Rico, April-May 2008\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nLago Cerrillos dam, located in the municipality of Ponce in southern Puerto Rico, was constructed in 1991 as part of the multipurpose Rio Portugues and Bucana Project. This project provides flood protection, water supply, and recreation facilities for the municipio of Ponce. The reservoir had an original storage capacity of 38.03 million cubic meters at maximum conservation pool elevation of 174.65 meters above mean sea level and a drainage area of 45.32 square kilometers. Sedimentation in Lago Cerrillos reservoir has reduced the storage capacity from 38.03 million cubic meters in 1991 to 37.26 million cubic meters in 2008, which represents a total storage loss of about 2 percent. During July 29 to August 23, 2002, 8,492 cubic meters of sediment were removed from the Rio Cerrillos mouth of the reservoir. Taking into account this removed material, the total water-storage loss as of 2008 is 778,492 cubic meters, and the long-term annual water-storage capacity loss rate is about 45,794 cubic meters per year or about 0.12 percent per year. The Lago Cerrillos net sediment-contributing drainage area has an average sediment yield of about 1,069 cubic meters per square kilometer per year. Sediment accumulation in Lago Cerrillos is not uniformly distributed and averages about 3 meters in thickness. This represents a sediment deposition rate of about 18 centimeters per year. On the basis of the 2008 reservoir storage capacity of 37.26 million cubic meters per year and a long-term sedimentation rate of 45,794 cubic meters per year, Lago Cerrillos is estimated to have a useful life of about 814 years or until the year 2822.\n\nSedimentation Survey of Lago Toa Vaca, Puerto Rico, June-July 2002\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe Lago Toa Vaca dam is located in the municipality of Villalba in southern Puerto Rico, and is owned and operated by the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority. Construction was completed in 1972 as the first phase of a multi-purpose project that contemplated four possible diversions from other basins to mitigate the rapid storage capacity loss of Lago Guayabal, located immediately downstream of the Toa Vaca dam. The latter phases of the intra-basin diversions were cancelled, and currently, the reservoir receives runoff from only 56.8 square kilometers of its drainage area. Lago Toa Vaca reservoir when constructed was to be used for irrigation of croplands in the southern coastal plain. The reservoir had an original storage capacity of 68.94 million cubic meters. Sedimentation has reduced the storage capacity by only 7 percent between 1972 and 2002 to 64.08 million cubic meters. This represents a long-term sedimentation rate of about 162,000 cubic meters per year. Based on the 2002 sedimentation survey, Lago Toa Vaca has a sediment trapping efficiency of about 98 percent and a drainage area-normalized sedimentation rate of about 3,086 cubic meters per square kilometer per year between 1972 and 2002. At the current long-term sedimentation rate the reservoir would lose its storage capacity by the year 2400.\n\nSedimentation History of Lago Guayabal, Puerto Rico, 1913-2001\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe Lago Guayabal dam, located in the municipality of Villalba in southern Puerto Rico, was constructed in 1913 for irrigation of croplands in the southern coastal plains and is owned and operated by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. The reservoir had an original storage capacity of 11.82 million cubic meters and a drainage area upstream of the dam of 112 square kilometers. Sedimentation has reduced the storage capacity to 6.12 million cubic meters in 2001, which represents a storage loss of about 48 percent. However, the actual sediment accumulation in the reservoir during the 88 years is greater, because some sediment removal was conducted between 1940 and 1948 by dredging and sluicing. This report summarizes the historical data from a 1913 land survey and eight bathymetric surveys conducted between 1914 and 2001, and the relation of high sedimentation to agricultural land practices within the Lago Guayabal basin and six major hurricanes which made landfall on the island. The reservoir had an area-normalized sedimentation rate of about 1,863 cubic meters per square kilometer per year between 1913 and 1936 from a 112 square kilometer basin. In 1972, a new dam upstream along the Rio Toa Vaca impounded runoff from 57.5 square kilometers, and sediment transport to Lago Guayabal was reduced. A comparison of bathymetric survey results between 1972 and 2001 indicates an area-normalized sedimentation rate of 1,120 cubic meters per square kilometer per year or about 60 percent of the rate between 1913 and 1936. The significant reduction (almost half) of the sedimentation rate after the Toa Vaca dam was built may indicate that erosion susceptibility of the Rio Toa Vaca watershed is about twice that of the Rio Jacaguas watershed impounded by Lago Guayabal.\n\nPublic-private mix for TB and TB-HIV care in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaniel, O J; Adedeji Adejumo, O; Abdur-Razzaq, H A; Ngozi Adejumo, E; Salako, A A\n\n2013-09-01\n\nPrivate and public tuberculosis (TB) treatment centres in Lagos State, Nigeria. To assess the contribution of private health care providers to TB and TB-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) case finding in Lagos State. A retrospective review of programme data submitted to the Lagos State TB and Leprosy Control Programme in 2011 by public, private for-profit (PFP) and private not-for-profit (PNFP) health care providers. A total of 8425 TB cases were notified by 31 private (11 PFP and 20 PNFP) and 99 public health facilities in Lagos State. Overall, the private facilities were responsible for 10.3% (866/8425) of the total TB cases notified. The proportion of TB patients tested for HIV was respectively 86.2%, 53.1% and 96.5% among public, PFP and PNFP facilities. Overall, 22.4% of the TB patients were HIV-positive. The HIV positivity rate among public, PFP and PNFP facilities was respectively 23.8%, 7.8% and 9.9%. Uptake of cotrimoxazole preventive therapy was respectively 69.6%, 25% and 38.2% among public, PFP and PNFP facilities, while that of antiretroviral therapy was respectively 23.8%, 8.3% and 9.1% in public, PFP and PNFP facilities. There is a need to scale up collaboration with the private sector, and particularly PNFP health providers.\n\nSedimentation survey of Lago Dos Bocas, Utuado, Puerto Rico, January 2010\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLago Dos Bocas reservoir was completed in 1942 to provide water for hydroelectric power generation along the northern coast of Puerto Rico. The reservoir had an original storage capacity of 37.50 million cubic meters (Mm3). The dam is located about 9 kilometers (km) northeast of the town of Utuado, immediately downstream of the original confluence of the RÃ­o Grande de Arecibo and the RÃ­o Caonillas (fig. 1). The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) owns and operates the Lago Dos Bocas reservoir, and since 1996, the reservoir has become an essential part of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) North Coast Superaqueduct Project. The Superaqueduct is supplied by controlled releases for hydroelectric power generation that replenish the public-supply raw-water intake pool located about 10 km downstream from the Lago Dos Bocas Dam (fig. 1). As of 2005, the Superaqueduct supplies about 4.03 cubic meters per second (m3/s) (348,192 cubic meters per day [m3/d]) of potable water to communities along the northern coast, from Arecibo to the San Juan metropolitan area. Because of the importance of the reservoir to the North Coast Superaqueduct, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with PRASA, conducted a sedimentation survey of Lago Dos Bocas in January 2009. The results of this survey were used to estimate the useful life and the firm yield of the reservoir, and evaluate the need to dredge the reservoir.\n\nAnalysis of Management Practices in Lagos State Tertiary Institutions through Total Quality Management Structural Framework\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAbdulAzeez, Abbas Tunde\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis research investigated total quality management practices and quality teacher education in public tertiary institutions in Lagos State.

This study was conducted to evaluate the level of rare earth elements (REE) and the variability of their anomalous behavior in groundwater samples collected from Lagos and Ogun States, Southwest, Nigeria. REE concentrations were determined in 170 groundwater samples using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, while the physicochemical parameters were determined using standard methods. Lagos State groundwater is enriched with REE [sum REEs range (meanÂ Â±Â SD)]; [0.365-488 (69.5Â Â±Â 117)]Â ÂµgÂ L -1 than Ogun State groundwater [sum REEs range (meanÂ Â±Â SD)]; [1.14-232 (22.6Â Â±Â 41.1)]Â ÂµgÂ L -1 . Boreholes are more enriched with REEs than wells. Significant (PÂ <Â 0.05) positive correlation (RÂ =Â Pearson) was recorded in Lagos State groundwater between sum REEs and Fe (RÂ =Â 0.55). However, there were no significant correlations between sum REEs, pH (RÂ =Â 0.073) and HCO 3 2- (RÂ =Â 0.157) in Ogun State groundwater. Chondrite-normalized plot shows that Lagos groundwater exhibits positive Ce anomaly, while Ogun State groundwater does not. The source of REE in Lagos State may be from the ocean and leaching from wastes dumpsites, while the source in Ogun State groundwater may be from the rocks.\n\nThe effects of Hurricane Hugo on suspended-sediment loads, Lago Loiza Basin, Puerto Rico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGellis, A.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nIn the two main tributaries that enter Lago Loiza, Rio Grande de Loiza and Rio Gurabo, 99 600 tonnes of suspended sediment was transported by 58.2??106 m3 of runoff in a 48 h period. The storm-average suspended-sediment concentration in the Rio Grande de Loiza for Hurricane Hugo was 2290 mgl-1, the second lowest for the 12 storms that have been monitored at this site. In Rio Gurabo the storm-average suspended-sediment concentration was 1420 mg l -1, the sixth lowest recorded out of 15 monitored storms. In Quebrada Salvatierra, a small tributary to Rio Grande de Loiza, suspended-sediment concentrations were as low as 33 mg l-1 during peak runoff of 20m3s-1. Normally the suspended-sediment concentrations at this discharge are 300 mg l-1. Hurricane force winds seem to be the most important factor contributing to the lower than expected suspended-sediment loads. High winds caused vegetation and debris to be dislodged and displaced. Debris accumulated on hillslopes and in small channels, blocked bridges and formed debris dams. These dams caused local backwater effects that reduced stream velocities and decreased suspended-sediment loads. -from Author\n\nClimatology of equatorial stratosphere over Lagos, Nigeria\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOyekola, Oyedemi Samuel\n\nWe have used 12 complete calendar years (January 1993-December 2004) of monthly averages of measurements made by the Dobson spectrophotometer instrument over an urban site, Lagos (6.6oN, 3.3oE), southwest Nigeria, to study equatorial stratospheric column ozone variations and trends. Our results indicate that the time-averaged total column ozone has a seasonal cy-cle, which maximizes in June and July with a value of 259 Dobson units (DU) and minimizes in February with a magnitude of 250 DU. Statistical analysis of the climatological mean monthly total Dobson O3 record for 1993-2004 show that the local trend is approximately +0.041Â±0.0011 DU/year (+0.49Â±0.013% per decade). Spectral analysis was applied to the monthly averages series. The significant periodicity at 95% confidence level demonstrate prominent spectra peaks near 1.9 and 3.6 years, representative of quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and quasi-triennial oscillation (QTO), respectively. Signal due to semiannual variation is also identified at Lagos sounding site. Comparison with the ozone observations from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrom-eter (TOMS) on board the Earth-Probe (EP) satellite for the period from 1997 to 2002 reveal that EP/TOMS instrument consistently larger than the ground-based measurement from Dob-son station. Percentage mean relative disparity ranges from -11% to 15%. The root mean square error (RMSE) between satellite and ground-based observations over Lagos ranges be-tween Ë35-83 DU with largest and lowest variability occurring during the ascending phase of solar activity (1999, 10.7 cm radio flux, F10.7 equals 154 flux units) and during the peak phase of solar activity (2001, F10.7 equals 181), respectively.\n\nAssessment of communication skills among Pharmacy students of the University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAina, BA; Ogunbiyi, OO\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: Communication skill is the bridge between the pharmacists and the patient. Communication in health can contribute to all aspects of disease prevention and health promotion. In order to become successful pharmacists, one needs to possess excellent communication skills to serve clients. This study was conducted at the University of Lagos to assess communication skills of Pharmacy students. METHOD: The study was descriptive and cross sectional. It was carried out between May and July 2009. Questionnaires were used for data collection. The questionnaire had two sections - the bio data section and pre-formulated questions on communication skills which has three options and one of these is the best option. RESULTS: A total number of 125 respondents were involved in the study which included 25 students from 200level, 50 from 300level and 50 from 500 level. Majority of them were between 18-25 years old (89.6%). There were more females (71.2%) than males (28.8%). Also most of them were Christians (71.2%). Among the respondents, about 62% picked the best options as their answer while the rest picked other options. There was no statistical difference in the choice of best options between the different levels of study. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded from the results of this study that majority of Pharmacy Students at the University of Lagos had good communication skills and they will be able to discharge their duties as pharmacists when they eventually graduate.

The isolated lake is unique because the geographic and geologic context provides information relating to the westerly wind patterns, interaction of multiple water sources (hot springs, glacial meltwater, precipitation, groundwater), and tectonic dynamics along a major transform fault. In March, 2005, four students and three teachers from Boerne High School, south-central Texas joined scientists from the United States, Argentina and Switzerland engaged in a geophysical survey of this lake. Lago Fagnano potentially contains within its sediments an undisturbed record of the geotectonic and global climate variability of past 20,000 years. The science team imaged the lake floor with a boat specially equipped to collect both high resolution data (high frequency), imaging the upper 10-15 meters of the sediment, and long range data (low frequency), penetrating 100 or more meters into the sediment. The group conducted field research of existing tectonic features at the eastern end of Tierra del Fuego, an activity directly tied to the research objectives of the science team. They also collected water and soil samples to assess chemical and isotopic trends in the Lago Fagnano region. The research performed can help to characterize the modern geochemical setting of the lake. Analyses of dissolved oxygen, NH4+, PO42-, pH (water) and N, P, and pH (soils) demonstrate a link between low nutrient levels and low biodiversity (which was confirmed by observation) in Tierra del Fuego. Water and soil data are incorporated into a database to facilitate comparisons to North American samples collected and analyzed during the Boerne High School summer field courses. Twenty-three ^18O and ^D analyses yielded a south-north isotopic trend across the Lago Fagnano region. ^18O and ^D transition from -11.92 to -3.53% and -87.81 to -40.26%, respectively, moving south to the Beagle Channel.

Although anti-trading regulations were gender-neutral in their language, girls were disproportionately sanctioned for engaging in street trading and related activities. In defending their concentration on girl sellers over boy sellers, colonial welfare officials painted a picture of the urban context as an inherently dangerous context and of girls as being particularly at risk of violent assault in the city, making them particularly in need of protection from town life. Sources which show that parents generally resisted or ignored the street trading regulations and continued permitting their daughters to sell despite entreaties, warnings, or fines from colonial officials, suggest that African parents and British colonial officials may have had conflicting views on the inherent danger of the city, on what constituted child endangerment, and on the gendered nature of childhood. This article argues that the girl saving campaigns of development era Lagos were as much about the legitimization of a colonial state facing a crisis of legitimacy as they were about debates between African parents and colonial welfare officials in Lagos concerning ideas of children and childhood and the dangers of street trading by African girls.\n\nUsing satellite images to monitor glacial-lake outburst floods: Lago Cachet Dos drainage, Chile\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFriesen, Beverly A.; Cole, Christopher J.; Nimick, David A.; Wilson, Earl M.; Fahey, Mark J.; McGrath, Daniel J.; Leidich, Jonathan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDuring 2008â2013, 14 GLOFs were released from Lago Cachet Dos and created environmental and safety concerns for downstream residents and to infrastructure. If GLOFs and the consequent headward erosion continue, the moraine that creates Lago Cachet Uno could be destabilized and breached, and the two lakes could merge. If the two lakes become connected, the volume of future GLOFs likely would be greater and thus cause longer and (or) more extensive flooding downstream. Additional GLOFs from Lago Cachet Dos are expected in the future, and continued environmental monitoring could provide an early warning system as well as scientific information that could increase our understanding of GLOFs and their consequences. GLOFs occur in glaciated areas around the world and remote sensing technologies can allow researchers to better understandâand potentially predictâfuture GLOF events.\n\nCalibration of a large water-Cherenkov detector at the Sierra Negra site of LAGO\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGalindo, A.; Moreno, E.; Carrasco, E.; Torres, I.; CarramiÃ±ana, A.; Bonilla, M.; Salazar, H.; Conde, R.; Alvarez, W.; Alvarez, C.; Araujo, C.; Areso, O.; Arnaldi, H.; Asorey, H.; Audelo, M.; Barros, H.; Bonnett, M.; Calderon, R.; Calderon, M.; Campos-Fauth, A.; CarramiÃ±ana, A.; Carrasco, E.; Carrera, E.; Cazar, D.; Cifuentes, E.; Collogo, D.; Conde, R.; Cotzomi, J.; Dasso, S.; De Castro, A.; De La Torre, J.; De LeÃ³n, R.; EstupiÃ±an, A.; Galindo, A.; GarcÃ­a, L.; Gomez Berisso, M.; GonzÃ¡lez, M.; Guevara, W.; Gulisano, A.

It is dedicated to the study of various issues related to astrophysics, space weather and atmospheric physics at the regional scale. In this paper we present the design and implementation of the front-end electronics and the data acquisition system for readout of the WCDs of LAGO. The system consists of preamplifiers and a digital board sending data to a computer via an USB interface. The analog signals are acquired from three independent channels at a maximum rate of ~1.2Ã105 pulses per second and a sampling rate of 40 MHz. To avoid false trigger due to baseline fluctuations, we present in this work a baseline correction algorithm that makes it possible to use WCDs to study variations of the environmental radiation. A data logging software has been designed to format the received data. It also enables an easy access to the data for an off-line analysis, together with the operational conditions and environmental information. The system is currently used at different sites of LAGO.\n\n[Water quality evaluation in rural areas of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil, 1999-2000].\n\nPubMed\n\nRocha, Christiane Maria Barcellos MagalhÃ£es da; Rodrigues, Luciano Dos Santos; Costa, Claudionor C; de Oliveira, Paulo Roberto; da Silva, Israel JosÃ©; de Jesus, Eder Ferreira Moraes; Rolim, Renata G\n\n2006-09-01\n\nIn addition to personal interviews, laboratory analyses were performed using 80 water samples from 45 rural areas that are crossed by the Agua Limpa and Santa Cruz streams close to the city of Lavras, southern Minas Gerais State. The results allowed comparing the quality of water used for agriculture and the identification of determinant factors. The Agua Limpa stream mostly crosses an area used primarily for housing and characterized by low schooling. Many houses are supplied by shallow water wells and have ordinary cesspits for human waste disposal. All springs are polluted. The Santa Cruz stream displays a different scenario. The land is used mostly for agricultural purposes. Most owners live in town, with widely varied levels of school, from none to university. The houses are supplied by surface water. Most of the springs are polluted. The perception by both home and land owners concerning quality of the drinking water is determined solely by the water's physical and organoleptic characteristics. Sanitary parameters are not taken into account. Moreover, there is no relationship between fecal contamination and the type of spring. Land use and anthropic activity are far more important than the type of spring for water quality.\n\nAssessing the deep drilling potential of Lago de Tota, Colombia, with a seismic survey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBird, B. W.; Wattrus, N. J.; Fonseca, H.; Velasco, F.; Escobar, J.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nReconciling orbital-scale patterns of inter-hemispheric South American climate during the Quaternary requires continuous, high-resolution paleoclimate records that span multiple glacial cycles from both hemispheres. Southern Andean Quaternary climates are represented by multi-proxy results from Lake Titicaca (Peru-Bolivia) spanning the last 400 ka and by pending results from the Lago Junin Drilling Project (Peru). Although Northern Andean sediment records spanning the last few million years have been retrieved from the Bogota and FÃºquene Basins in the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes, climatic reconstructions based on these cores have thus far been limited to pollen-based investigations. When viewed together with the Southern Hemisphere results, these records suggest an anti-phased hemispheric climatic response during glacial cycles. In order to better assess orbital-scale climate responses, however, independent temperature and hydroclimate proxies from the Northern Hemisphere are needed in addition to vegetation histories. As part of this objective, an effort is underway to develop a paleoclimate record from Lago de Tota (3030 m asl), the largest lake in Colombia and the third largest lake in the Andes. One of 17 highland tectonic basins in Eastern Cordillera, Lago de Tota formed during Tertiary uplift that deformed pre-foreland megasequences, synrift and back-arc megasequences. The precise age and thickness of sediments in the Lago de Tota basin has not previously been established. Here, we present results from a recent single-channel seismic reflection survey collected with a small (5 cubic inch) air gun and high-resolution CHIRP sub-bottom data. With these data, we examine the depositional history and sequence stratigraphy of Lago de Tota and assess its potential as a deep drilling target.\n\nSedimentation survey of Lago Lucchetti, Yauco, Puerto Rico, September 2013âMay 2014\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGÃ³mez-Fragoso, Julieta\n\n2016-08-23\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey conducted a sedimentation survey of Lago Lucchetti, Yauco, Puerto Rico, in 2013â14 in cooperation with the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority. The survey updated a previous survey, conducted in 2000, and provided accurate information regarding reservoir storage capacity and sedimenÂ­tation rate using bathymetric techniques and a global positioning system coupled with a depth sounder device. The results of the 2013â14 survey indicated a total storage capacity for Lago Lucchetti of 10.21 million cubic meters and a longÂ­-term sedimentation rate loss of 0.16 million cubic meters per year based on the original capacity in 1952. Sediment accumulation was about 10.14 million cubic meters over the life of the reservoir, which represents a storage decrease of about 50 percent of the original capacity in 1952. On the basis of a comparison between the 2013â14 and 2000 surveys, the useful life for Lago Lucchetti is projected to end in 2076.\n\nGeology, petrology and geochronology of the Lago Grande layered complex: Evidence for a PGE-mineralized magmatic suite in the CarajÃ¡s Mineral Province, Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTeixeira, Antonio Sales; Ferreira Filho, Cesar Fonseca; Giustina, Maria Emilia Schutesky Della; AraÃºjo, Sylvia Maria; da Silva, Heloisa Helena Azevedo Barbosa\n\n2015-12-01\n\nultramafic lithotypes render Nd model ages between 2.94 and 3.56 Ga, with variably negative ÉNd (T = 2.72 Ga) values (-0.32 to -4.25). The crystallization sequence of the intrusion and the composition of cumulus minerals, together with lithogeochemical and Nd isotopic results, are consistent with an original mantle melt contaminated with older continental crust. The contamination of mafic magma with sialic crust is also consistent with intra-plate rifting models proposed in several studies of the CMP. Lithogeochemical and isotopic data from the Lago Grande Complex may also be interpreted as the result of melting an old lithospheric mantle, and alternative models should not be disregarded. PGE mineralizations occur in chromitites and associated with base metal sulfides in the Lago Grande Complex. Chromitite has the highest PGE content (up to 10 ppm) and is characterized by high Pt/Pd ratio (4.3). Mantle-normalized profile of chromitite is highly enriched in PPGE and similar to those from Middle Group (MG) and Upper Group (UG) chromitites from the Bushveld Complex. Platinum group minerals (PGM) occur mainly at the edge of chromite crystals in the Lago Grande chromitite, consisting of arsenides and sulfo-arsenides. Sulfide-bearing harzburgite samples of the Lago Grande complex have PGE content of up to 1 ppm and low Pt/Pd (0.2-0.3) ratios. The 2722 Â± 53 Ma U-Pb zircon age determined in this study for the Lago Grande Complex overlaps with the crystallization age of the Luanga Complex. Previous interpretation that the Lago Grande and Luanga layered intrusions are part of a magmatic suite (i.e., Serra Leste Magmatic Suite) is now reinforced by similar fractionation sequences, comparable petrological evolution and overlapped U-Pb zircon ages. The occurrence of the same styles of PGE mineralization in the Lago Grande and Luanga complexes, together with remarkably similar chondrite-normalized PGE profiles and PGE minerals for chromitites of both complexes, support the concept that\n\nStorage capacity and sedimentation trends of Lago Garzas, Puerto Rico, 1996-2007\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-Lopez, L.R.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLago Garzas is located in west-central Puerto Rico, about 3.5 kilometers southwest of the town of Adjuntas, in the confluence of the RÃ­o Vacas and three other unnamed tributaries (fig. 1). The dam is owned and operated by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), and was constructed in 1943 for hydroelectric power generation and municipal water use along the southern coast. The dam is a semi-hydraulic earthfill embankment lined with boulders, and has a height of 61.57 meters, a top width of 9.14 meters, a base width of 365.76 meters, and a crest length of 227.37 meters; State Road PR-518 crosses the top of the dam. A morning-glory-type spillway is located near the west abutment of the dam at an elevation of 736.12 meters above mean sea level (Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority, 1969). Figure 2 shows an aerial photograph of the Lago Garzas earthfill dam and the morning-glory spillway section. Additional information and operational procedures are provided in Soler-LÃ³pez and others (1999). During July 17-18, 2007, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Caribbean Water Science Center, in cooperation with the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, conducted a bathymetric survey of Lago Garzas to update the reservoir storage capacity and update the reservoir sedimentation rate by comparing the 2007 data with the previous 1996 bathymetric survey results. The purpose of this report is to describe and document the USGS sedimentation survey conducted at Lago Garzas during July 2007, including the methods used to update the reservoir storage capacity, sedimentation rates, and areas of substantial sediment accumulation since 1996.\n\nDrivers and Pattern of Social Vulnerability to Flood in Metropolitan Lagos, Nigeria\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFasona, M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nLagos is Africa's second largest city and a city-state in southwest Nigeria. Population and economic activities in the city are concentrated in the greater Lagos metropolitan area - a group of barrier islands less than a thousand square kilometer. Several physical factors and critical human-environmental conditions contribute to high flood vulnerability across the city. Flood impact is highly denominated and the poor tend to suffer more due to higher risk of exposure and poor adaptive capacity. In this study we present the pattern of social vulnerability to flooding across the Lagos metropolis and argued that the pattern substantially reflects the pattern and severity of flooding impact on people across the metropolis. Twenty nine social indicators and experiences including poverty profile, housing conditions, education, population and demography, social network, and communication, among others, were considered. The data were collated through field survey and subjected to principal component analysis. The results were processed into raster surfaces using GIS for social vulnerability characterization at neighborhood levels. The results suggest the social status indicators, neighborhood standing and social networks indictors, the indicators of emergency responses and security, and the neighborhood conditions, in that order, are the most important determinants of social vulnerability. Six of the 16 LGAs in metropolitan Lagos have high social vulnerability. Neighborhoods that combine poor social status indicators and poor neighborhood standing and social networks are found to have high social vulnerability whereas other poor neighborhoods with strong social networks performed better. We conclude that improved human living condition and social network and communication in poor urban neighborhoods are important to reducing social vulnerability to flooding in the metropolis.\n\nHourly global and diffuse radiation of Lagos, Nigeria-correlation with some atmospheric parameters\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChendo, M.A.C.; Maduekwe, A.A.L.\n\n1994-03-01\n\nThe influence of four climatic parameters on the hourly diffuse fraction in Lagos, Nigeria, has been studied. Using data for two years, new correlations were established. The standard error of the Liu and Jordan-type equation was reduced by 12.83% when solar elevation, ambient temperature, and relative humidity were used together as predictor variables for the entire data set. Ambient temperature and relative humidity proved to be very important variables for predicting the diffuse fraction of the solar radiation passing through the humid atmosphere of the coastal and tropic city of Lagos. Seasonal analysis carried out with the data showed improvementsmoreÂ Â» on the standard errors for the new seasonal correlations. In the case of the dry season, the improvement was 18.37%, whole for the wet season, this was 12.37%. Comparison with existing correlations showed that the performance of the one parameter model (namely K[sub t]), of Orgill and Hollands and Reindl, Beckman, and Duffie were very different from the Liu and Jordan-type model obtained for Lagos.Â«Â less\n\nNutritional status of urban and rural primary school pupils in Lagos State, Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nEkekezie, O O; Odeyemi, K A; Ibeabuchi, N M\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study was carried out in Lagos State in Ikorodu LGA (rural), a largely agrarian area producing raw materials for agro-allied industries and Ikeja LGA (urban), a highly-developed metropolis and commercial centre. Hitherto, studies showed that undernutrition had been the main form of malnutrition among Nigerian children. However with influences from urbanization, westernization and globalization in cosmopolitan Lagos, it is imperative to find out if the global epidemic of overweight and obesity has caught on. To compare the nutritional status of primary school pupils in urban and rural LGAs in Lagos State, Nigeria. This was a cross , sectional comparative study. A multistage sampling method was adopted. Data were collected from 529 pupils with an interviewer administered questionnaire. Their weight and height were recorded in pre-designed proforma and converted to nutritional indices. The prevalence rates of underweight, stunting and wasting in the rural area were 49.6%, 50.8% and 24.2% respectively; while it was 15.1%, 16.6% and 13.6% in the urban area respectively. There was overnutrition in the urban area: 15.1% were overweight and 13.2% were obese. The mean nutritional indices were significantly lower among the rural pupils than urban pupils (p<0.001) in each case. Undernutrition is still a major health problem among school children in Lagos State, Nigeria, more so in the rural area. There is an emergence of overweight and obesity in the urban area. A comprehensive programme to improve nutritional status is recommended as part of a well funded school health programme.\n\nEstimating urban trees and carbon stock potentials for mitigating climate change in Lagos: Case of Ikeja Government Reserved Area (GRA)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nElias, P. O.; Faderin, A.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nUrban trees are a component of the urban infrastructure which offers diverse services including environmental, aesthetic and economic. The accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere resulting from the indiscriminate distribution of human populations and urban activities with the unsustainable consumption of natural resources contributes to global environmental change especially in coastal cities like Lagos. Carbon stocks and sequestration by urban trees are increasingly recognized to play significant roles for mitigating climate change. This paper focuses on the estimation of carbon stock and sequestration through biomass estimation and quantification in Ikeja GRA, Lagos. Ikeja possesses a characteristic feature as a microcosm of Lagos due to the wide range of land uses. A canopy assessment of tree population was carried out using itree canopy software. A GPS survey was used to collect an inventory of all trees showing their location, spatial distribution and other attributes. The analysis of the carbon storage and sequestration potential of both actual and potential tree planting sites involved biomass estimations from tree allometry equations. Trees were identified at species level and measurements of their dendrometric values were recorded and integrated into the GIS database to estimate biomass of trees and carbon storage. The trees in the study area were estimated to have a biomass of 441.9 mg and carbon storage of 221.395 kg/tree. By considering the potential tree planting sites the estimated carbon stored increased to 11,352.73 kg. Carbon sequestration value in the study area was found to be 1.6790 tonnes for the existing trees and 40.707 tonnes for the potential tree planting sites (PTPS). The estimation of carbon storage and sequestration values of trees are important incentives for carbon accounting/footprints and monitoring of climate change mitigation which has implications for evaluation and monitoring of urban ecosystem.\n\nThe glacial geomorphology of the Lago Buenos Aires and Lago PuerreydÃ³n ice lobes, Central Patagonia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBendle, Jacob; Thorndycraft, Varyl; Palmer, Adrian\n\n2016-04-01\n\nPatagonia is ideally located for reconstructions of late Quaternary ice-climate interaction(s) in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, yet many questions remain concerning post-LGM ice sheet retreat dynamics across the region. While modern-day glaciation is restricted to three small icefields (the North and South Patagonian and Cordillera Darwin icefields), during the Quaternary, and at the LGM, episodes of significant ice advance culminated in an expansive Patagonian ice sheet (PIS) centered over the southern Andes, for which a long and well-preserved landform record exists. Previous mapping in the region has either aimed to achieve regional coverage, necessarily omitting more subtle/complex features suggestive of certain ice-marginal processes, or has focused on the identification of palaeo-ice limits (e.g. moraine ridges) for geochronological applications, with little attention given to other (e.g. glaciofluvial, glaciolacustrine) features that are significant for understanding post-LGM ice sheet retreat dynamics. This poster presents a comprehensive and highly detailed (<30m spatial resolution) map of the glacial geomorphology of the Lago Buenos Aires (46.4Â°S) and Lago PuerreydÃ³n (47.2Â°S) ice lobes, major outlet glaciers of the central sector of the former PIS. The map allows refined reconstructions of glacial and, in particular, deglacial ice-marginal processes, and will underpin further analysis on the retreat history of the palaeo-ice lobes using high-resolution lithostratigraphic (varve) analyses.\n\nSedimentation Survey of Lago La Plata, Puerto Rico, July 2006\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nLago La Plata dam is located between the municipalities of Naranjito and Toa Alta in north central Puerto Rico, about 5 kilometers south of the town of Toa Alta and about 5 kilometers north of the town of Naranjito. The reservoir impounds the waters of the Rio de La Plata, the Rio Guadiana, and the Rio Ca?as, and is part of the San Juan Metropolitan Water District, which provides about 35 percent of the total water demand for the area (Soler-Lopez and others, 2000). The reservoir has a drainage area of about 469 square kilometers. The dam was constructed in 1974 and is a concrete gravity structure with a normal pool elevation of 52.00 meters above mean sea level (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, 1979). During October 1998, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Caribbean Water Science Center, in cooperation with the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) conducted a bathymetric survey of Lago La Plata to assess the impact of Hurricane Georges on the storage capacity of the reservoir. Between July 17 and 20, 2006, the USGS and the PRASA conducted an additional bathymetric survey of Lago La Plata to update the reservoir storage capacity and determine the reservoir sedimentation rate by comparing the 2006 survey data with the 1998 survey data.. The purpose of this report is to update the reservoir storage capacity, sedimentation rates, and areas of substantial sediment accumulation since 1998. Historical (1974) data are referenced as needed to account for long-term storage capacity loss trends...\n\nSedimentation Survey of Lago de Cidra, Puerto Rico, August 2007\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSoler-LÃ³pez, Luis R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nLago de Cidra is a reservoir located on the confluence of Rio de Bayamon, Rio Sabana, and Quebrada Prieta, in the municipality of Cidra in east-central Puerto Rico, about 3.0 kilometers northeast of the town of Cidra. The dam is owned and operated by the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA), and was constructed in 1946 as a 6.54-million-cubic-meter supplemental water supply for the San Juan metropolitan area. The reservoir impounds the waters of Rio de Bayamon, Rio Sabana and Quebrada Prieta. The reservoir has a drainage area of 21.4 square kilometers. The dam is a concrete gravity and earthfill structure with a length of approximately 165 meters and a structural height of 24 meters. The spillway portion of the dam is an ungated ogee crest about 40 meters long with a crest elevation of 403.00 meters above mean sea level. Additional information and operational procedures are listed in Soler-Lopez (1999). During August 14-15, 2007, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Caribbean Water Science Center (CWSC), in cooperation with the PRASA, conducted a bathymetric survey of Lago de Cidra to update the reservoir storage capacity and actualize the reservoir sedimentation rate by comparing the 2007 data with the previous 1997 bathymetric survey data. The purpose of this report is to describe and document the USGS sedimentation survey conducted at Lago de Cidra during August 2007, including the methods used to update the reservoir storage capacity, sedimentation rates, and areas of substantial sediment accumulation since 1997.\n\nHealthcare waste management status in Lagos State, Nigeria: a case study from selected healthcare facilities in Ikorodu and Lagos metropolis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLonge, Ezechiel O\n\n2012-06-01\n\nA survey of healthcare waste management practices and their implications for health and the environment was carried out. The study assessed waste management practices in 20 healthcare facilities ranging in capacity from 40 to 600 beds in Ikorodu and metropolitan Lagos, Lagos State, Nigeria. The prevailing healthcare waste management status was analysed. Management issues on quantities and proportion of different constituents of waste, segregation, collection, handling, transportation, treatment and disposal methods were assessed. The waste generation averaged 0.631 kg bed(-1) day(-1) over the survey area. The waste stream from the healthcare facilities consisted of general waste (59.0%), infectious waste (29.7%), sharps and pathological (8.9%), chemical (1.45%) and others (0.95%). Sharps/pathological waste includes disposable syringes. In general, the waste materials were collected in a mixed form, transported and disposed of along with municipal solid waste with attendant risks to health and safety. Most facilities lacked appropriate treatment systems for a variety of reasons that included inadequate funding and little or no priority for healthcare waste management as well as a lack of professionally competent waste managers among healthcare providers. Hazards associated with healthcare waste management and shortcomings in the existing system were identified.\n\nLagos \"Area Boys\", Substance Usage and Potential Risk Factors\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSalaam, Abeeb Olufemi; Brown, Jennifer\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe current study explores the rate at which members of Lagos' \"area boys\" engage in drug and alcohol use, and determines the predictive roles of parental and neighbourhood characteristics in the gang patterns of psychoactive substance misuse behaviour.

The dam is owned and operated by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and was constructed in 1913 for the irrigation of croplands in the southern coastal plains of Puerto Rico. The reservoir impounds the waters of the Rio Jacaguas and those of the Rio Toa Vaca, when the Toa Vaca dam overflows or releases water. The reservoir has a drainage area of 53.8 square kilometers. The dam is a concrete gravity structure with a normal pool (at top of flashboards) elevation of 103.94 meters above mean sea level (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, 1988). During October 2006, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Caribbean Water Science Center, in cooperation with the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) conducted a bathymetric survey of Lago Guayabal to update the reservoir storage capacity and actualize the reservoir sedimentation rate by comparing the 2006 data with the previous 2001 bathymetric survey results. The purpose of this report is to describe and document the USGS sedimentation survey conducted at Lago Guayabal during October 2006, including the methods used to update the reservoir storage capacity, sedimentation rates, and areas of substantial sediment accumulation since December 2001. The Lago Guayabal sedimentation history up to 2001 was published by the USGS in 2003 (Soler-Lopez, 2003); therefore, this report focuses on the comparison between the 2001 and current bathymetric surveys of Lago Guayabal.\n\nArterial injuries in civilian practice in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nThomas, M O; Giwa, S O; Adekoya-Cole, T O\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThis is a retrospective study of patients managed at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital for peripheral arterial injuries from January 1995 to April 2003. The aim was to study the pattern of peripheral arterial injuries in Lagos. Nigeria and to look at the outcome of management and see what improvements could be made in future. Data was collated from case notes of patients, operation register in theatre and admission and discharge books from the surgical wards and the data bank of consultants involved in patients' management. Forty-one patients. 37 males and 4 females. were treated within the study period (M:F ratio of 9:1). Twenty three patients (56.1%) suffered gunshot injuries during armed robbery attacks while 9 patients (22.0%) had stab injuries in civilian violence. Twenty-one patients (3 with gunshot injuries and 18 non gunshot penetrating injuries) were managed by direct suturing of vessels. Eight patients had prosthetic graft interposition while 2 patients had reversed saphenous vein grafts. Two patients had the superficial branches of their radial arteries tied up at the wrist. Gun shot injuries from armed robbery attack was the commonest cause of peripheral arterial injuries in this environment during the period of study.\n\nMonitoring mountain lakes in a changing Alpine cryosphere: the Lago Nero project (Ticino, Switzerland)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScapozza, Cristian; Bruder, Andreas; Domenici, Mattia; Lepori, Fabio; Pera, Sebastian; Pozzoni, Maurizio; Rioggi, Stefano; Colombo, Luca\n\n2017-04-01\n\nMountain lakes and their catchments of the Alpine cryosphere are facing global pressures including climate warming and deposition of atmospheric pollutants. Due to their remoteness, often low buffer capacities and sensitive biotic communities, alpine lake catchments are particularly well suited as sentinels of environmental change. Lago Nero is the object of an intensive survey, aimed at developing predictive models of catchment-wide ecosystem responses to environmental change (Bruder et al. 2016). Lago Nero is located at the head of Val Bavona (Canton Ticino, southern Switzerland), in a southwest-facing catchment, with altitude ranging from 2385 to 2842 m asl. The substrate is dominated by gneissic bedrock with patches of grassy vegetation and shallow soils. The catchment is snow-covered approximately from November to May. For a similar period, the lake is ice-covered. Lago Nero is an oligotrophic, soft-water lake with a surface of approximatively 13 ha and a maximal depth of 73 m. According to the regional model of potential permafrost distribution in the southern Swiss Alps (Scapozza & Mari 2010), the presence of discontinuous permafrost is probable in almost the entire surface of the catchment covered by loose debris. A direct evidence of permafrost occurrence is the presence of a small active/inactive rock glacier in the south-eastern part of the catchment (front altitude: 2560 m asl). Monitoring of the site began in summer 2014, with an initial phase aimed at developing and testing methodologies and at evaluating the suitability of the catchment and the feasibility of the monitoring program. The intensive survey at Lago Nero measures a wide array of ecosystem responses, including runoff quantity and chemistry, catchment soil temperature (also on the rock glacier) and composition of terrestrial vegetation. Sampling frequency depends on the parameter measured, varying from nearly continuous (e.g. runoff and temperature) to five-year intervals (e.g. soil and\n\nElectricity supply efficiency and organizational growth and profitability in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAdeleke, Adedeji Tajudeen\n\nA modern and efficient infrastructure is a basic necessity for economic development and integration into the global economy. The specific problem was the inadequate and unreliable supply of electricity to manufacturing corporations in Lagos, Nigeria. The purpose of the current quantitative correlational research study was to examine if there was a correlation between electricity supply efficiency and organizational growth and profitability in manufacturing corporations in Lagos, Nigeria. The population of the current correlational research study involved 28 out of 34 manufacturing corporations from various industrial sectors in Lagos, Nigeria, that are listed and traded on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Spearman rho correlations were used to assess the relationships between independent variables of electricity supply efficiency levels and the dependent variables of organizational growth and profitability. The result of the correlational analysis of the data revealed that there was a statistically significant, strong positive correlation between the Average Gross Income (1998-2007) and Average Actual Electricity supply efficiency level (1998-2007), rho = 0.57; p = 0.002. A statistically significant, strong positive correlation was found between the Average Balance Sheet Size (1998-2007) and Average Actual Electricity Supply Efficiency Level (1998-2007), rho = 0.54; p = 0.003. A statistically significant, strong positive correlation between the Average Profit After Tax (1998-2007) and Average Actual Electricity Supply Efficiency Level (1998-2007), rho = 0.60; p = 0.001, was found. No statistically significant correlation between the Average Return on Investment (1998-2007) and Average Actual Electricity supply efficiency level (1998-2007), rho = 0.19; p = 0.33, was discovered.\n\nMotivations for Gang Membership in Lagos, Nigeria: Challenge and Resilience\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSalaam, Abeeb Olufemi\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe current study explores the major challenges (in the form of risk factors) that may influence unemployed youths' involvement in gang and criminal activity in Lagos, Nigeria.

Of the 320 patients assessed, 240 were determined to have died from tuberculosis. Tuberculous meningitis was the main cause of death. Forty-two percent of the deaths occurred in the age group of 0 to 10 years old, and 47.5 percent of the patients died within one week of diagnosis. Potentially avoidable factors contributing to death include late reporting by patients to medical personnel, lack of bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) vaccine, irregular taking of medications by patients, and late referral of patients to specialized hospitals. There is a need for improved education of patients and medical personnel about the management of tuberculosis in Lagos.

As such, understanding domestic dog ecology has been recognized as central to the design of effective rabies control programmes. This study was conducted to determine the dog ecology in Lagos State using compound dog count and street dog count in the three senatorial districts (Lagos West, East and Central) of Lagos State from February, 2011 to January, 2012. A total of 546 questionnaires were distributed for the compound dog count and all were completed and returned. Various aspects of dog ecology were determined, including size, sex, breed of the dog population, management of dogs and rabies awareness among the respondents. Out of the 546 compounds surveyed, 518 (94.87%) owned at least one dog. A total of 1,427 dogs were counted from the street counts while a total of 1,447 dogs (2.8 dogs/compound) were counted from the compound count. The dogs comprised of 583 males and 864 females, out of which 64.10% are confined. The dog vaccination coverage in the dog population surveyed was 64.10% and administered majorly (91.30%) by veterinarians. Security (60%) and pets (26%) were the major reasons for keeping dogs. Majority (88.80%) of the respondents were aware of rabies and its mode of transmission, but still believed in the use of concoctions (40.40%), herbs (19.90%) and consumption of the organ of the offending dog (11.50%) for the treatment of rabies. The findings of this study showed a male: female ratio of dog to be 1:1.5 and a dog: human ratio of 1:5.6. There was also a responsible dog ownership as majority of the respondents do confine, vaccinate and provide food for their dogs. Vaccination coverage of the total dog population was however below the 70-80% target recommended by the World Health Organization to achieve herd immunity.

Ongoing environmental pressures exerted by large-scale land reclamation for residential quarters, refuse and sewage dumping, and other uses, however, are suspected to have had a substantial impact on ecological health of the Lagos wetland ecosystems over the last few decades. To determine the impact of these pressures, we examined spatial changes in three wetlands areas- Badore/Langbasa (BL), Festac/Iba/Ijegun (FI) and Ologe/Otto-Awori (OO) through field sample collection and analyses of surface water, sediments, air-water interface gas fluxes and vegetations. Surface water conductivity, total suspended solids (TSS), alkalinity, chloride, biological oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate, phosphate and heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Fe, Na, Mn, Pb, Cd, K and Ni) exhibited relative spatial stability while other water quality parameters varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the wetland areas. Also, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) contributed to most of the total dissolved solids (TDS) since only DIC correlated significantly with TDS (r = 0.889; P = 0.05, n = 12) and TS (r = 0.891; P = 0.05, n = 12), suggesting a strong capacity for carbon sequestration and carbon sink across the wetland areas. None of the encountered vegetation species are in the vulnerable category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). There are indications of steady rise in greenhouse gas levels in Lagos since air CO2 value at BL have reached global threshold of 400 ppm with OO and FI closely approaching. We conclude that the Lagos wetland ecosystems, especially OO and FI still have some semblance of natural habitat. However, further destruction and unwise use of the resources could cause damage to physical, chemical, geological and biological processes in nature, which could result to grave socio-economic and cultural consequences to the local\n\nDecision scenario analysis for addressing sediment accumulation in Lago Lucchetti, Puerto Rico\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nA Bayesian belief network (BBN) was used to characterize the effects of sediment accumulation on water storage capacity of a reservoir (Lago Lucchetti) in southwest Puerto Rico and the potential of different management options to increase reservoir life expectancy.

The majority of the city's residents are poor. The residents make a heavy demand on resources and, at the same time, generate large quantities of solid waste. Approximately 4 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) is generated annually in the city, including approximately 0.5 million of untreated industrial waste. This is approximately 1.1 kg/cap/day. Efforts by the various waste management agencies set up by the state government to keep its streets and neighborhoods cleanmoreÂ Â» have achieved only minimal success. This is because more than half of these wastes are left uncollected from the streets and the various locations due to the inadequacy and inefficiency of the waste management system. Whilst the benefits of proper solid waste management (SWM), such as increased revenues for municipal bodies, higher productivity rate, improved sanitation standards and better health conditions, cannot be overemphasized, it is important that there is a reduction in the quantity of recoverable materials in residential and commercial waste streams to minimize the problem of MSW disposal. This paper examines the status of recovery and recycling in current waste management practice in Lagos, Nigeria. Existing recovery and recycling patterns, recovery and recycling technologies, approaches to materials recycling, and the types of materials recovered from MSW are reviewed. Based on these, strategies for improving recovery and recycling practices in the management of MSW in Lagos, Nigeria are suggested.Â«Â less\n\nPattern and outcome of cases seen at the Adult Accident and Emergency Department of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, Lagos.\n\nPubMed\n\nUzoechina, N S; Abiola, A O; Akodu, B A; Mbakwem, A; Arogundade, A R; Tijani, H; Adegbesan-Omilabu, M A\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe accident and emergency department constitutes one of the vital entry points of patients into the healthcare facility of the hospital the world over. It responds to and manages variety of cases in all the clinical areas and thus pr vides an insight to the quality of care available in the health institution. The aim of this study is to determine the pattern of cases seen as well as the causes of deaths at the adult accident and emergency department of the Lagos UniversityTeaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, Lagos. Retrospective review of records of all patients attended to at the adult accident and emergency department of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital in 2009 and 2010 was carried out. Data spread sheet was used to collect data on demographic indices, diagnosis, outcome, date admitted, date discharged and amount paid from casualty attendance register and Nurses' report books. Data was collated and analysed using Epi-Info version 3.4.1 statistical software package. Out of the 5,427 available patients' records reviewed, 4,761(87.7%) were recorded as \"discharged alive\", 546 (10.1%) were recorded as \"died\", while 120 (2.2%) were recorded as \"brought in dead\". Of those discharged alive, male attendance was 2,376 (49.10%) while that of the female was 2,385 (50.10%). Majority of these patients were aged 20-39 years and the mean age of the patients was 39.96 +/- 18.22 yrs. Majority of cases seen were medical in origin (53.7%) and highest medical case seen was cerebrovascular accident, Commonest cause of death was from medical cases [69.2%] (cerebrovascular accident 22.0%). Male mortality was 55.3% while female mortality was 44.7%, mean age was 46.86 +/- 17.61. Most affected age group was 40 - 59 years (35.4%) and highest number of death was seen in December. The commonest case seen as well as commonest cause of death was cerebrovascular accident. A high number of heart failure, head injuries, road traffic accidents, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and post partum\n\nProfile of medical waste management in two healthcare facilities in Lagos, Nigeria: a case study.\n\nPubMed\n\nIdowu, Ibijoke; Alo, Babajide; Atherton, William; Al Khaddar, Rafid\n\n2013-05-01\n\nProper management and safe disposal of medical waste (MW) is vital in the reduction of infection or illness through contact with discarded material and in the prevention of environmental contamination in hospital facilities. The management practices for MW in selected healthcare facilities in Lagos, Nigeria were assessed. The cross-sectional study involved the use of questionnaires, in-depth interviews, focused group discussions and participant observation strategies. It also involved the collection, segregation, identification and weighing of waste types from wards and units in the representative facilities in Lagos, Nigeria, for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the MW streams. The findings indicated that the selected Nigerian healthcare facilities were lacking in the adoption of sound MW management (MWM) practices. The average MW ranged from 0.01 kg/bed/day to 3.98 kg/bed/day. Moreover, about 30% of the domestic waste from the healthcare facilities consisted of MW due to inappropriate co-disposal practices. Multiple linear regression was applied to predict the volume of waste generated giving a correlation coefficient (R(2)) value of 0.99 confirming a good fit of the data. This study revealed that the current MWM practices and strategies in Lagos are weak, and suggests an urgent need for review to achieve vital reversals in the current trends.\n\nAnti-malarial drug quality in Lagos and Accra - a comparison of various quality assessments\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Two major cities in West Africa, Accra, the capital of Ghana, and Lagos, the largest city of Nigeria, have significant problems with substandard pharmaceuticals. Both have actively combated the problem in recent years, particularly by screening products on the market using the Global Pharma Health Fund e.V. MinilabÂ® protocol. Random sampling of medicines from the two cities at least twice over the past 30 months allows a tentative assessment of whether improvements in drug quality have occurred. Since intelligence provided by investigators indicates that some counterfeit producers may be adapting products to pass Minilab tests, the results are compared with those from a Raman spectrometer and discrepancies are discussed. Methods Between mid-2007 and early-2010, samples of anti-malarial drugs were bought covertly from pharmacies in Lagos on three different occasions (October 2007, December 2008, February 2010), and from pharmacies in Accra on two different occasions (October 2007, February 2010). All samples were tested using the MinilabÂ® protocol, which includes disintegration and active ingredient assays as well as visual inspection, and most samples were also tested by Raman spectrometry. Results In Lagos, the failure rate in the 2010 sampling fell to 29% of the 2007 finding using the MinilabÂ® protocol, 53% using Raman spectrometry, and 46% using visual inspection. In Accra, the failure rate in the 2010 sampling fell to 54% of the 2007 finding using the MinilabÂ® protocol, 72% using Raman spectrometry, and 90% using visual inspection. Conclusions The evidence"
