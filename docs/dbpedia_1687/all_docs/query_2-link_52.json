        "text": "Liverpool's Champions League challenge ended in a 1-1 draw against FC Basel, who booked their spot in the last 16 on Wednesday (AEDT) after withstanding a late fightback sparked by a stunning Steven Gerrard free kick.\n\nGerrard curled the ball into the top corner with eight minutes remaining to cancel out Fabian Frei's rasping first-half drive, but the Premier League side, who had been reduced to 10 men following the second half sending off of Lazar Markovic, could not find the crucial winner.\n\nBarring their late flurry, it was a largely a dismal home performance from Liverpool who finished third in Group B on five points, two adrift of second place Basel.\n\nLiverpool, whose poor start to the season shows no sign of improving, will now drop into the demanding Europa League.\n\nReal Madrid made it six wins out of six Champions League group games, and set a Spanish record for consecutive victories when a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty set them on the way to a 4-0 success at home to 10-man Ludogorets.\n\nAlready through to the last 16 as group winners, holders Real romped to a 19th straight victory in all competitions, surpassing the record of 18 they jointly held with Barcelona.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's men came close to scoring several times before the Bulgarian champions were reduced to 10 men after 19 minutes when midfielder Marcelinho handled at a corner to keep out a Raphael Varane header and was shown a straight red card.\n\nRonaldo slotted his spot kick down the middle with a cheeky chip for his 72nd Champions League goal, overtaking former Real striker Raul (71) and moving into second overall behind Barcelona forward Lionel Messi (74).\n\nGareth Bale headed in off the underside of the crossbar at a corner to make it 2-0 in the 38th minute, Alvaro Arbeloa added an 80th-minute third and substitute Alvaro Medran struck the fourth for the dominant home side two minutes from time.\n\nFired by Ronaldo's prolific scoring form, Real have won all their games since a 2-1 La Liga defeat at home to city rivals Atletico Madrid in September.\n\nThey also won all six Champions League group games under Jose Mourinho in 2011-12, a feat previously achieved by four other clubs - AC Milan in 1992-93, Paris St Germain in 1994-95, Spartak Moscow in 1995-96 and Barcelona in 2002-03.\n\nLudogorets had a chance of securing third place and claiming a berth in the Europa League ahead of 2005 European champions Liverpool if they had avoided defeat at the Bernabeu.\n\nInstead, Liverpool go into the continent's second-tier club competition after the draw with Basel.\n\nGunners thrash Galatasaray 4-1 but fail to top Group D\n\nIn other matches, stunning goals from Lukas Podolski and Aaron Ramsey, who both scored twice, gave Arsenal a morale-boosting 4-1 win over Galatasaray as they finished in second place in Group D.\n\nThe Gunners were already assured of a place in the last 16 for the 15th successive season with the only issue to be decided being whether they could overtake Borussia Dortmund to finish top of the standings.\n\nBut Borussia's 1-1 draw with Anderlecht meant the Germans topped the section on 13 points, the same as Arsenal but top on goal difference, followed by Anderlecht on six and Galatasaray on one.\n\nAymen Abdennour and Fabinho's second-half goals helped Monaco beat Zenit St Petersburg 2-0 at home and send the principality side into the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\nCentre-back Abdennour headed home in the 64th minute and Fabinho doubled the tally with a low shot one minute from time as Monaco clinched top spot in Group C with 11 points from six games.\n\nBayer Leverkusen, who were held to a goalless draw at Benfica, finished one point behind.\n\nJuventus had veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon to thank as they scraped into the Champions League knockout stage with a goalless draw at home to Atletico Madrid.\n\nThe stalemate also suited Atletico who were already qualified and guaranteed top spot in Group A. Juventus, who went out in the group stage last season, made sure of second place with 10 points, three behind Atletico.\n\nIn the other Group A game, Olympiakos beat Malmo 4-2 to finish third."
