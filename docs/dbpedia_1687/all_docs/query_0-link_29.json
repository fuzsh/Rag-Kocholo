        "text": "The authors use sports data to study the effects of manager replacement on firm performance. Using match results of the major Italian soccer league (“Serie A”), the effects of coach (manager) changes on team performance are analyzed. To control for the “Ashenfelter dip” and to compare similar teams facing similar opponents two alternative econometric strategies are undertaken: the estimation of a number of team-season fixed effects models and the use of a matching estimator. From team-season fixed effects estimates, it emerges that changing the coach does not produce a positive effect on team performance, with the exception of the number of goals scored. Matching estimates confirm that changing the coach does not affect team performance neither when considering as dependent variable the number of points per match nor when looking at the number of goals scored or conceded.\n\nThe abstract will not exceed 100 words. It will mention the aim of the paper, research goals and expected results. The management of human resources is a component of the general management of an entity and has become, in the last decades, an area in continuous expansion in what concerns theoretical, methodological and applicative research, this being one of the direct consequences of evolution in the management practice and thought. The scientific approach in this paper is based on the conviction that success, performance and competitiveness of a football club and of other entities depend largely on the quality of the employees. Employees are a key to the success of any business, they are the difference between the use of human resources and the provision of competitive services. This is why I would like to emphasize in this paper, by using case studies based on scientific rigour, the potential of human resources management in football, a field known more for its effects and less f...\n\nAfter the 1990’s, the changes in the football world had helped to develop and to grow the economy of football rapidly. The development of digital broadcasting led to build a bigger commercial structure. With the effect of those changes, commercial incomes, sponsor revenues, stadium and facilities incomes, and betting incomes have increased over time. This rapid change also brings several problems. UEFA has published UEFA criteria in order to protect football’s sustainability and viability in a long term. Depending on license criteria that is published by UEFA, it has used a road map for football clubs, regarding of corporate structure of UEFA to work, that identified the general rules like in a company structure and management that should be all the necessary factors of production in a systematic and effective way in order to transform football clubs to a corporate organization and make them sustainable.
