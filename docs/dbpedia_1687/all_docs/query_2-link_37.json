        "text": "Manchester United made a winning return to the Champions League with a deserved home victory over Swiss side Basel.\n\nMarouane Fellaini, who came on for the injured Paul Pogba in the first half, rose highest to head United ahead from an Ashley Young cross with 10 minutes to go to the break.\n\nRomelu Lukaku strengthened their grip on the encounter by converting from among a group of players in the box from a Daley Blind cross following a short corner.\n\nMarcus Rashford fired in his side's third from a Fellaini low cross seven minutes after coming on. The striker has now scored in his first appearance in the Champions League, Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup, League Cup and for England.\n\nThe scoreline could have been even greater for Jose Mourinho's dominant side, making their first appearance in Europe's premier club competition since 2015, having qualified by winning the Europa League in May.\n\nThey created numerous clear-cut chances, the best of which Henrikh Mkhitaryan side-footed against the post from close range after being found by a Lukaku cut-back.\n\nBasel were pinned back in their own half for much of the game but could have forced a different outcome had Luca Zuffi not fired wide from an unmarked position in the box just before Fellaini's opener.\n\nMohamed Elyounoussi also forced David De Gea into a fine save with a rising shot from inside the box as the visitors became more ambitious in the final quarter of the match.\n\nIn the other game in Group A, CSKA Moscow beat Benfica 2-1 in Portugal.\n\nRashford is making it impossible for Mourinho to leave him out of the United side.\n\nHaving started three of his side's four Premier League matches to date this season, the England forward was left out to allow Anthony Martial a turn from the start.\n\nShortly after being introduced, he once again demonstrated his awareness of an impending opportunity and ability to locate space in which to capitalise, darting into the box to dispatch Fellaini's cross.\n\nHis connection wasn't the truest, but it was enough to carry the ball past Tomas Vaclik.\n\nIt was his third goal of the campaign, the third game in succession in which he has scored and another debut goal to further underline his status as one of the most natural finishers in the English game."
