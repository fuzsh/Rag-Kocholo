        "text": "Basel 2-0 Celtic (Agg 3-3 - Basel win on away goals)\n\nCeltic tumbled out of the Champions League at the qualifying stage after a disappointing defeat in Switzerland.\n\nBasel ran the Scottish champions ragged in the opening stages and goals from Christian Giminez and Murat Yakin were enough to give them an early lead.\n\nCeltic, who had a 3-1 lead from the first leg, battled gamely to get back into the match but lacked creativity in the final third of the pitch and fell victim to the away goals rule.\n\nMartin O'Neill's men enjoyed the bulk of possession in the second half and carved out a number of chances, but a mixture of good goalkeeping and squandered opportunities means a Uefa Cup campaign beckons for Celtic.\n\nBasel started at a whirlwind tempo and Celtic could have been a goal behind after just three minutes when Paul Lambert had to stretch to block a shot from Ivan Ergic just a few yards out.\n\nCeltic were caught out by the pace and clever movement of the Swiss in the eighth minute when a delightful reverse pass from Hakan Yakin split the visiting defence, allowing Gimenez to race through and slide the ball under Robert Douglas.\n\nThe Glasgow side should have been on level terms soon after but Henrik Larsson's firm header from just five yards out went straight at Basel keeper Pascal Zuberbuhler.\n\nCeltic started with an unfamiliar back four and, without the width provided by their normal 3-5-2 formation, lacked menace going forward.\n\nThe home team, backed by a noisy capacity crowd, had their tails up and they were rewarded with another goal after 22 minutes when Murat Yakin rose above Bobo Balde and Ulrik Laursen to head home a corner kick.\n\nBalde had two good chances to get a goal back for Celtic when he found room in the opposition box, but was denied by a good save from Zuberbuhler and later headed over from a good position.\n\nCeltic made changes at half time with Didier Agathe and Steve Guppy coming on to play on the flanks. Laursen and Paul Lambert were the men to make way.\n\nThe Scots were immediately on the offensive and a deflected shot from Stilian Petrov flashed narrowly wide.\n\nPlaying with determination and drive, Celtic were on top for long spells of the second half, but struggled to create good goal-scoring chances.\n\nChris Sutton had a near post header saved and a long range effort from Momo Sylla was easily dealt with.\n\nSubstitute John Hartson almost scored with his first touch in the 71st minute but Zuberbuhler stuck out a hand to block the Welshman's close range header.\n\nDouglas produced a wonderful diving save to keep Celtic's hopes alive in the 85th minute and immediately afterwards Larsson volleyed over the bar from eight yards as play raged from one end to the other.\n\nThe final minutes saw a Sutton shot slide inches wide of the post as Celtic laid siege to the Swiss goal.\n\nFC Basel: Zuberbuhler, Quennoz, Vila Varela, Hakan Yakin, Barberis, Gimenez, Murat Yakin, Duruz, Cantaluppi, Ergic, Juilio Rossi. Subs: Koumantarakis, Tum, Savic, Rapo, Streller, Degn, Thimothee Atouba.\n\nCeltic: Douglas, Valgaeren, Balde, Mjallby, Laursen, Sylla, Lambert, Lennon, Petrov, Larsson, Sutton. Subs: McNamara, Hartson, Fernandez, Agathe, Hedman, Guppy, Crainey.\n\nReferee: Anders Frisk (Sweden)"
