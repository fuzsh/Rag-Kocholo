        "text": "Premier League clubs spent £100 million in the 2024 January transfer window -- the lowest single-window expenditure in the men's game since 2012 (£60m) and a significant drop from the record £815m splashed out in 2023, according to Deloitte.\n\nAfter record-breaking spending in the past three transfer windows, things seem to have slowed. But English clubs' total spending of £2.5 billion during the 2023-24 season was still the second-highest ever, and across the rest of Europe's Big Five leagues, January spending actually rose from €255m to €455m.\n\nWhat can we expect this time around? Here are grades for all the major confirmed summer transfers in the men's game, with each day's moves listed in order of highest fee.\n\nAll fees are reported unless confirmed with an asterisk.\n\nAug. 30\n\nAARON RAMSDALE\n\n£18m ($23.7m)\n\nArsenal: B\n\nSouthampton: A\n\nSouthampton's summer-long search for a goalkeeper has ended in a way they probably didn't think possible and signing Ramsdale is a bit of a coup for the club.\n\nWith starting goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu out with a torn achilles, it was imperative that the newly promoted side recruited not only a good and experienced No. 1, but one that suited a possession style too. Ramsdale ticks all the boxes. Add-ons could see the deal reach £25m in total, which remains good value for Saints, but could also see Arsenal make their initial £24m outlay back in time.\n\nAug. 29\n\nROMELU LUKAKU\n\n€30.9m (£26m; $34.4m)\n\nChelsea: C-\n\nNapoli: B+\n\nLukaku's €115m grand return to Chelsea from Inter in 2021 ended in grand failure. He didn't suit Thomas Tuchel's style of play and was sent out to Italy on loan twice, and now moves there permanently.\n\nAll parties will be happy with this transfer, although only to varying degrees. The happiest will be Lukaku, who reunites with Antonio Conte in a league he loves; then comes Napoli, who are are getting a striker they can trust to do the business in Italy; then lastly Chelsea, who got a transfer fee back for him, but can't escape the fact that spending such a huge amount three years was, in hindsight, a big mistake.\n\nFEDERICO CHIESA\n\n€11.9m (£10m; $13.2m)\n\nJuventus: C+\n\nLiverpool: B+\n\nLiverpool are taking a risk with Chiesa, but at this price it's a risk well worth taking. Three years ago he looked like one of the most devastating wingers in world football, but an ACL injury completely derailed him. That led to a point where Juventus felt it was time to move on, but have had to wait all summer for a bite on the market. And £10m (plus £2.5m in add-ons) isn't the price they were looking for.\n\nAs the team's sixth attacker, Chiesa can take his time to get up to speed. There's a chance it never happens for him, but if it does then the Blues will have gotten a bargain.\n\nKEPA ARRIZABALAGA\n\nLoan\n\nChelsea: C\n\nBournemouth: B\n\nChelsea's cohort of goalkeepers continues to thin out, as the world's most expensive goalkeeper (he moved from Athletic Club in August 2018 for €80m) joins Bournemouth for a season-long loan. The Blues would likely have preferred a permanent deal as it's clear he's not in the club's long-term plans, but a loan is better than nothing.\n\nThe Spain international seems slated to be the new No. 1 for the Cherries, as they're well stocked in terms of goalkeeping numbers and had no need to pursue quantity given club captain Neto is set to move to Arsenal on loan.\n\nAug. 28\n\nTEUN KOOPMEINERS\n\n€52m ($57.9m)\n\nAtalanta: B\n\nJuventus: B+\n\nJuventus have had their hearts set on Koopmeiners for a long time and for good reason: He's an excellent and extremely well-rounded midfielder capable of doing pretty much everything at a high level. His final act at Atalanta was to help win the Europa League.\n\nHe'll suit Juve manager Thiago Motta's possession style brilliantly, so while the fee is on the hefty side, his quality is clear and his tactical fit is strong too. Atalanta will miss him dearly and won't be able to replace him like-for-like, but they've held firm for a good fee, essentially quadrupling their money after three great seasons.\n\nWhere does Mikel Merino fit in at Arsenal?\n\nGab Marcotti and Stewart Robson discuss where Mikel Merino could fit in in this Arsenal side.\n\nAug. 27\n\nMIKEL MERINO\n\n€33m (£28m; $36.6m)\n\nReal Sociedad: B-\n\nArsenal: A\n\nYet another Euro 2024 winner from Real Sociedad who earns a big move, Mikel Merino will be sorely missed. A €33m fee doesn't feel particularly expensive for a player of his quality -- but considering he only had one year left on his contract and thus their negotiating position was weak, the Basque club have at least recouped enough to replace him.\n\nArsenal should be delighted with another very quality addition to their team who looks likely to assimilate to Mikel Arteta's style well. Merino is good at almost everything a midfielder needs to be good at and, at 28, should be arriving in his peak years.\n\nGIORGI MAMARDASHVILI\n\n€29.7m (£25m; $33.1m)\n\nValencia: D\n\nLiverpool: A\n\nMamardashvili emerged as one of the stars of Euro 2024, playing a pivotal role in a brave Georgia campaign that enchanted the world. His 11-save performance against Czechia in particular was sensational. His goalkeeping style -- big build, incredible shot stopper, huge presence between the sticks, but with some work to do on his distribution -- has attracted fair comparisons to Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nSo Liverpool have secured the best young goalkeeper in the world for about a third of the fee the elite players in this position tend to go for. It's very cheap, it's a great deal for the Reds, and it's a quizzically poor deal for Valencia even if they do get to keep him on loan for one more season.\n\nJOÃO CANCELO\n\n€25m ($27.9m)\n\nManchester City: B\n\nAl Hilal: A\n\nCancelo's time in Manchester City limbo is over. After 18 months of loan spells with Bayern Munich and Barcelona, he becomes the latest star to swap Europe for Saudi Arabia.\n\nA transfer fee of €25m isn't much to pay for what is still one of the world's best full-backs, so in terms of outlay this is a fantastic deal for Al Hilal. Cancelo joins a cluster of Portuguese-speaking stars there, including Neymar and Rúben Neves, so should jell quickly. For City, it's closure -- finally -- and a chunk of money back, while he's also unlikely to come back and haunt them if he's no longer in Europe.\n\nAug. 26\n\nVITOR ROQUE\n\nLoan\n\nBarcelona: F\n\nReal Betis: A-\n\nVitor Roque's January move to Barcelona was supposed to be a dream, but instead it turned into something closer resembling a nightmare. Eight months later, he's joined Real Betis on a loan, with an option to extend that loan, plus an option to make him permanent.\n\nIn other words, Barça are happy to move on from him -- just a year on from spending an initial €35m (plus some hefty possible add-ons) to land him. His exit won't help alleviate their player registration concerns as the Brazilian wasn't registered to begin with.\n\nReal Betis are sorely lacking in numbers up front -- they've started the season with a winger playing striker -- so this is a fantastic move for them.\n\nCLEMENT LENGLET\n\nLoan\n\nBarcelona: C+\n\nAtlético Madrid: B\n\nAtlético Madrid said goodbye to four centre-backs this summer, so it felt like a matter of time before they acquired some extra depth. Clément Lenglet is that depth. Loaning the Frenchman is a cheap, smart way to build out the squad and make sure they have enough cover.\n\nBarcelona likely would have preferred to make it a permanent move -- this is Lenglet's third straight season out on loan, he hasn't played for Barça since 2022 -- but this is better than nothing, as he wouldn't be registered to play in LaLiga anyway.\n\nAug. 23\n\nILKAY GÜNDOGAN\n\nFree\n\nBarcelona: D\n\nManchester City: A\n\nIt's a bit of a shock to see Gündogan's Barcelona adventure come to an end after just one year, but the club once again find themselves under financial pressure, and it's been reported that the German's exit takes them a step closer to being able to register new signing Dani Olmo to play.\n\nSo while there's logic in allowing him to depart for free, the fact remains they're losing an incredible player for nothing, in part due to their own mismanagement; that results in a low grade. Meanwhile, Manchester City are all too happy to welcome the 33-year-old back with open arms, bagging an easy A for their efforts.\n\nWill João Félix shine after signing long-term deal with Chelsea?\n\nIan Darke breaks down how he thinks Chelsea signing João Félix will fare in the coming seasons.\n\nAug. 21\n\nJOÃO FÉLIX\n\n€50m (£42.6m; $55.4m)\n\nAtlético Madrid: C+\n\nChelsea: B\n\nFélix's awkward stay at Atlético Madrid is finally over. Having spent the past 18 months out on loan, he can now start an official new chapter in a new, permanent home. He's by far the biggest winner of this deal, with both Chelsea and Atleti having to make concessions to make it happen.\n\nChelsea have spent more on him than they had planned to spend on Samu Omorodion -- whose deal to join the Blues collapsed -- and there's no obvious place for him in the XI, despite his clear quality. Meanwhile, Atleti have swallowed a big loss on a player they signed for more than €126m in 2019, but at least they got something.\n\nCONOR GALLAGHER\n\n€42m (£36m; $45m)\n\nChelsea: D\n\nAtlético Madrid: A\n\nChelsea's near-total squad clearout continues with the exit of Gallagher -- and this will hit some fans particularly hard. An academy product who often captained the club last season follows a plethora of homegrown talent out the door for a middling fee, which is representative of the fact his contract had just one year left on it.\n\nThe Blues' loss is Atlético's gain, though, and Gallagher looks a tremendous fit for Diego Simeone's style of play: He's a devilishly hard worker and has the technical quality to thrive at the top of LaLiga.\n\nAug. 20\n\nGEORGINIO RUTTER\n\n£40m ($51.6m)\n\nLeeds United: A\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion: B-\n\nRutter is a thrilling watch; he has this game-changing ability to power forward, shrugging off challenges as he heads towards goal, and it causes mayhem amongst the opponent's ranks. The talent is obvious to anyone who watches him, but Brighton's gamble here is that they can refine the edges of his game.\n\nJust seven goals from 128 shots last season in the Championship was noted as a problem, and while his 15 assists certainly took the edge of any major concerns, Georginio remains an unpolished gem. For such a price, there's a fair bit of risk in this deal for Brighton.\n\nAug. 17\n\nDÉSIRÉ DOUÉ\n\n€50m ($55.4m)\n\nRennes: B-\n\nParis Saint-Germain: B+\n\nPSG's restyling as the home of the best French footballing talent continued with the signing of Doué, who broke out in a big way last season for Rennes. He scored four and assisted four in 1,626 league minutes, but far more impressive than that were his dribbling numbers: He ranked in the 99th percentile across Europe for successful take-ons and progressive carries, while he also ranked in the 95th percentile for shot-creating actions.\n\nEither as a left winger or as a No. 10, he should thrive in the capital. Meanwhile, Rennes have been relatively fairly compensated for his talent.\n\nAug. 13\n\nMATTHIJS DE LIGT\n\n€45m (£38.5m; $49.1m)\n\nBayern Munich: B-\n\nManchester United: A-\n\nAjax, Juventus, Bayern Munich and now Manchester United. Few are lucky enough to play for four superclubs, fewer still achieve it before the age of 25. De Ligt is bringing all of that experience to Old Trafford now and should form a strong partnership with Lisandro Martínez. They complement each other well: De Ligt is a brilliant box defender (if a little on the slow side), while Lisandro is snappy, aggressive and quick. The Dutchman will also be a great mentor for fellow summer arrival Leny Yoro.\n\nFor €45m plus €5m in add-ons, this feels like a shrewd deal for United. For Bayern, it's definitely a loss on their €77m investment -- although they are stacked at centre-back these days.\n\nFÁBIO CARVALHO\n\n£20m ($25.5m)\n\nLiverpool: C+\n\nBrentford: A\n\nCarvalho was one of Liverpool's standout pre-season performers, so it comes as something of a shock to see his excellent summer result in a transfer. That said, his path to the first XI is blocked by a glut of established stars, so if he's ready to fly, it may well have to be elsewhere.\n\nIt's a £20m deal that could rise to £27.5m with add-ons, which is good (but not great) compensation for a player whose ceiling is very high. Brentford will rightly be feeling very smug about this signing, especially given Carvalho is an academy graduate of their fierce local rivals Fulham.\n\nAARON WAN-BISSAKA\n\n£15m ($19.1m)\n\nManchester United: C+\n\nWest Ham: A-\n\nThe time feels right for Wan-Bissaka to seek fresh adventure. After a rock-solid start to life at Manchester United following a £45m move from Crystal Palace in 2019, the right-back has steadily slipped down the pecking order under Erik ten Hag these last two years.\n\nIn signing him, West Ham are upgrading and now have a proven Premier League full-back in his prime (26). His one-on-one tackling is some of the best in the game, and while there are some shortcomings on the ball, the Hammers' style will suit him a better than United's.\n\nNOUSSAIR MAZRAOUI\n\n€15m (£12.8m; $16.4m)\n\nBayern Munich: B-\n\nManchester United: B+\n\nMazraoui follows De Ligt to United and becomes the fifth former Ajax player to sign for the club under Erik ten Hag. Is anyone sensing a theme here? A fee of €15m, plus another €5m in add-ons, is pocket change for Mazraoui, who has established himself not only as a good right-back in a possession system, but also very strong cover on the left flank too.\n\nThe only knock on his résumé is his injury record: He has missed 73 games since the start of the 2020-21 season for an assortment of different physical issues. That's presumably why Bayern are happy to say goodbye.\n\nNicol questions Julian Alvarez's move to Atletico Madrid\n\nSteve Nicol discusses Julian Alvarez's imminent move to Atletico Madrid from Manchester City.\n\nAug. 12\n\nJULIÁN ÁLVAREZ\n\n€75m (£64m; $82m)\n\nManchester City: A-\n\nAtlético Madrid: B\n\nThis is a blockbuster deal and a blockbuster fee, which could reach a whopping €95m with add-ons. Álvarez is intent on taking the next step in his career and moving for just shy of nine figures is certainly one way to do it. He's an exceptional footballer who delivered 20 goals and assists combined in the Premier League last season, not only helping Erling Haaland up top for Manchester City but filling in ably for him too. Add that to his ferocious workrate and never-say-die attitude and it's easy to see why Diego Simeone wants him.\n\nCity get a high grade as they've made a huge profit (from an initial €16m) on a player who isn't necessarily an automatic starter for them. Atleti get a solid B, as the player suits the club and manager brilliantly, but it is an awful lot of money to lay down.\n\nEMERSON ROYAL\n\n€15m (£12.9m; $16.4m)\n\nTottenham: A\n\nAC Milan: D\n\nMilan's two-month long pursuit of Emerson has finally concluded. The Rossoneri will pay €15m plus add-ons to sign the 25-year-old Brazilian.\n\nIt's a slightly confusing move on paper, as while Milan could clearly benefit from some enhanced quality at right-back, Emerson may not be it. He struggled to assimilate into Ange Postecoglou's attacking, possession-based style at Spurs, which does not bode well considering Milan manager Paulo Fonseca coaches similarly.\n\nAug. 11\n\nPEDRO NETO\n\n£51.4m ($65.6m)\n\nWolves: B-\n\nChelsea: B-\n\nWhen fit, Pedro Neto has been torching Premier League defences for the past five years. His speed, dribbling ability and remarkable two-footedness makes him dangerous to even the very best in the business. The \"when fit\" part is pretty crucial, though. Had it not been for quite serious injury issues setting in -- he's missed 102 games since 2020 began -- he likely would have been whisked away from Wolves far sooner.\n\nChelsea are taking a big risk here, one that other top clubs have shied away from, but there's no denying the talent. Regardless of his injuries, it's a big blow to Wolves, who have lost their best player -- albeit for a handsome fee.\n\nAug. 10\n\nDOMINIC SOLANKE\n\n£55m ($70.2m)\n\nAFC Bournemouth: A\n\nTottenham Hotspur: B-\n\nA £55m initial fee, potentially rising to £65m, is big, big money for Dominic Solanke. It completes a long-awaited and circuitous route back to the top for him. He was a lethal finisher at youth level for Chelsea but struggled to show the same prowess at senior level until last season, when he bagged 19 Premier League goals for Bournemouth. That tally, in addition to his link-up play and work rate, made him one of the stars of the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nFor Spurs, it's an expensive but logical addition, with Richarlison previously the club's only senior player whose best position is at centre-forward. For the Cherries, it's a club-record transfer made when Solanke's stock is at its highest.\n\nAug. 9\n\nDANI OLMO\n\n€60m ($65.6m)\n\nRB Leipzig: A\n\nBarcelona: B-\n\nIt felt inevitable that Barcelona would sign one of Spain's Euro 2024 stars, and while the early summer signs pointed towards Nico Williams, it's Olmo who has made the big move to Camp Nou.\n\nA stunning former La Masia youth player, Olmo is capable of producing magic in the box and scoring decisive goals, and his ability to play as an attacking midfielder or out wide should mean he plays a sizable, varied role for Barça over the course of the season.\n\nThe one concern is his injury record. Olmo has missed at least 19, 20 and 29 games due to injury in each of the past three seasons respectively. As a result, he hasn't been a core part of the RB Leipzig team, so banking €60m for this transfer earns them an A grade.\n\nWILLIAN PACHO\n\n€40m ($43.6m)\n\nEintracht Frankfurt: A\n\nParis Saint-Germain: B+\n\nPSG have struggled with injuries at centre-back over the past year, so it's no surprise to see them dip into the market for a fresh face. After missing out on Leny Yoro, who went to Manchester United, they've plumped for Copa América star Pacho. The Ecuador international had a brilliant single season for Eintracht Frankfurt; his busy, active, front-footed style of defending led to plenty of tackles and interceptions, he's extremely quick and he can fill in at left-back in a pinch too.\n\nFor €40m plus a possible €5m in add-ons, this is a good investment by PSG, while Eintracht have more than quadrupled their money in the space of a year, having signed him for just €9m in 2023.\n\nAug. 5\n\nJOÃO NEVES\n\n€70m ($76.8m)\n\nBenfica: A\n\nParis Saint-Germain: B+\n\nIt wouldn't be a transfer window without yet another incredibly talented Benfica youngster flying the nest; Neves, a superb central midfielder, is the next one off a frankly incredible production line. He may be diminutive in stature (5-foot-9), but he doesn't play like it. He's aggressive and tenacious and his leap is tremendous -- as well as showcasing all the technical skills in tight spaces that top teams require, of course.\n\nNaturally, Benfica secure a high grade here as they've not only earned a high fee, but they've negotiated the return of one of their own, Renato Sanches, in a linked deal on loan too. PSG come out looking pretty good too, as like with Leny Yoro, this is a young talent well worth betting big bucks on.\n\nNICLAS FÜLLKRUG\n\n€31.4m (£27m; $34.4m)\n\nBorussia Dortmund: A\n\nWest Ham: B-\n\nFüllkrug is another heartwarming story of a late bloomer finally finding his way to the top level. It was only a couple of years ago that the 31-year-old was playing the German second tier; now he's scored for his country at Euro 2024, played in a Champions League final and made a big move to the Premier League.\n\nWest Ham badly needed a striker and Füllkrug has clear pedigree, but they're marked down a little bit for paying a fairly significant fee and handing a four-year deal to player heading towards the end of his career. There's a bit of risk there.\n\nDortmund, meanwhile, have doubled their money in the space of a year and replaced him with Serhou Guirassy for half the price. That's A grade behaviour.\n\nXAVI SIMONS\n\nLoan\n\nParis Saint-Germain: A\n\nRB Leipzig: A\n\nDespite strong interest from Bayern Munich this summer, Simons has returned to Leipzig for a second campaign on loan. He racked up 19 total goal involvements in the Bundesliga last season, finishing joint-second for assists (11), and impressed many at Euro 2024 for Netherlands. If he takes another step forward in the 2024-25 campaign, he could be on for a truly sensational campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, parent club PSG can sit back and watch him either grow into a player they can incorporate in 2025, or watch his transfer stock rise and rise. It's a win-win.\n\nAug. 3\n\nROBIN LE NORMAND\n\n€34.5m ($37.4m)\n\nReal Sociedad: C\n\nAtlético Madrid: A-\n\nLe Normand is the second Euro 2024 winner to earn a notable move this summer, after Álvaro Morata, as he brings an eight-year stay with Real Sociedad to an end -- and it feels like a bit of a steal. In the modern game, €34.5m for a prime age (27), hugely experienced and accomplished defender with a near-spotless injury record doesn't seem like much at all. Atleti desperately needed to address this position having said goodbye to two senior centre-backs (Mario Hermoso, Stefan Savic) this summer, and this is an excellent fix.\n\nLa Real will struggle to replace his quality and overall impact like-for-like.\n\nALEXANDER SØRLOTH\n\n€32m ($34.9m)\n\nVillarreal: B+\n\nAtlético Madrid: B-\n\nIn their attempts to replace Morata up front, Atlético kept things simple: They initially tried to sign LaLiga's top scorer last season, Artem Dovbyk, who netted 24, and when that failed, went for Sørloth, who scored 23. It was the 28-year-old's best campaign to date without a doubt, though concern does linger due to the fact he massively overperformed his xG (expected goals) by 10.7 -- the highest in LaLiga by some margin.\n\nSørloth has never settled anywhere -- Atleti will be his 11th club -- so there is risk here that Villarreal are seemingly happy to cash in on.\n\nYAN COUTO\n\nLoan\n\nManchester City: B\n\nBorussia Dortmund: A-\n\nDortmund said goodbye to a lot of full-back talent this summer, so bolstering this position with the addition of Couto makes a lot of sense, and they will land him on a permanent deal for €30m next year.\n\nHe's been exceptional on loan at Girona and has emerged as a brilliant dribbling, creative right-sider. The fee is hefty by BVB's standards, but by pushing the payment back to next year via an initial loan, subject to certain sporting conditions being met, they're giving themselves enough room to continue spending this summer.\n\nCouto never made an appearance for Man City in four years there, so it's tough to say they'll miss him, as talented as he is.\n\nAug. 2\n\nEMILE SMITH ROWE\n\n£27m ($34.5m)\n\nArsenal: B+\n\nFulham: B\n\nIt wasn't supposed to end like this. There's a reason Arsenal fans created a song jointly honouring Bukayo Saka and Smith Rowe: They were supposed to lead the club to glory, together. Sadly for Smith Rowe, injuries have heavily disrupted his past two seasons, resulting in just three Premier League starts. During that time, the Arsenal squad has evolved to the point that it's left him behind to an extent.\n\nFulham are smart to pounce for a player who could yet reach the top level, but are gambling slightly on him proving his fitness -- hence holding them back from an A grade.\n\nAug. 1\n\nPASCAL GROß\n\n€7m (£5.9m; $7.5m)\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion: D\n\nBorussia Dortmund: A\n\nBrighton held out for as long as they could, but in the end accepted Groß's wish to move on. In losing him, they not only lose the heartbeat of their midfield and passing game, but the player who provided the most Premier League goals and assists (14) in a Seagulls shirt last season.\n\nThe low fee is reflective of his age (33), but not of his ability: Groß was part of Germany's Euro 2024 squad and stepped in effectively when needed. He's an excellent addition to a Dortmund side looking to reshape under new manager Nuri Sahin.\n\nJuly 31\n\nFILIP JÖRGENSEN\n\n€24.5m (£20.7m; $26.5m)\n\nVillarreal: B+\n\nChelsea: B-\n\nThe 2023-24 campaign saw Filip Jörgensen break out between the sticks for Villarreal, starting 36 league games and really heating up just before Christmas, which is when people started to take note of his skills.\n\nChelsea have decided they like what they see and haven't had to part with too much money to secure his signature. His comfort on the ball will suit Enzo Maresca's style, although the Blues now have an overspill of goalkeepers that must be sorted.\n\nJuly 30\n\nMATÍAS SOULÉ\n\n€26m (£21.9m; $28.1m)\n\nJuventus: C+\n\nRoma: A\n\nMatías Soulé was considered one of Juventus' crown jewels and, while on loan at Frosinone last season, leapt to the fore in a breakout season that saw him hit double figures in goals from the right flank.\n\nThe fact they've decided to move on from him off the back of that has certainly raised a few eyebrows -- especially when you consider they've sent him to an Italian rival. Roma's gain is Juve's loss; Soulé will very likely blossom in the capital.\n\nJuly 29\n\nRICCARDO CALAFIORI\n\n€40m (£33.7m; $43.4m)\n\nBologna: C+\n\nArsenal: A\n\nFrom the moment Riccardo Calafiori set foot on the pitch at Euro 2024, his Bologna career was over; there was simply no way the elite clubs were going to pass up on what they were seeing.\n\nIt's Arsenal who have got the deal over the line, and for €40m plus €5m in add-ons the fee looks pretty good for such a young, multi-talented defender who can do so many different things. It's also important to understand he's not simply a \"tournament signing\" -- he had a phenomenal 2023-24 campaign in Serie A and has always boasted huge potential, but injuries previously held him back. Bologna will lose a sizable chunk of the fee to FC Basel due to a clause in the deal which took him to Italy 12 months ago, and they won't come close to replacing his quality like-for-like in the market.\n\nJuly 28\n\nRAPHAËL VARANE\n\nFree\n\nComo: B\n\nComo are back in Serie A and offering one of the most glamorous market propositions going: Top-level football, managed by Cesc Fàbregas, living by the lake. As a result, experienced players are flocking there, with Raphaël Varane -- who was released by Manchester United when his contract expired at the end of June -- the latest to sign up.\n\nThe France international, now into his 14th professional season at the age of 31, may be past his peak (injuries have certainly played a part in that) but he can still produce dominant defensive displays. He'll be a big influence as Como seek to stave off relegation.\n\nJuly 24\n\nMOUSSA DIABY\n\n£50.5m ($65.3m)\n\nAston Villa: A\n\nAl Ittihad: A-\n\nDiaby's time in the Premier League was short and (relatively) sweet. Villa did well to beat off competition from the Saudi Pro League to sign him last summer, but just one year on he's made the move. The club should be satisfied with the chunky fee they've received, as it represents a small profit on the £45m they paid in 2023 and Diaby did not finish the season as a key player -- despite a red-hot start to life in England.\n\nThe Saudi Pro League will also consider it a win, as it has attracted a renowned, prime-age (25) player to its growing project.\n\nJuly 22\n\nAMADOU ONANA\n\n£50m ($64.6m)\n\nEverton: A\n\nAston Villa: B\n\nA big signing, in more ways than one. Villa have paid through the nose to secure the 6-foot-6 Belgium international, who is one of the best young midfielders in England. A fee of £50m will create plenty of expectation, but not only is Onana proven at the top level, he'll slot in alongside fellow Belgian Youri Tielemans, which should help.\n\nOnana has particular strengths, such as aerial duels and box defending, which Villa are crying out for if they're to move forward. It's a loss of talent for Everton but it's also a big fee and an opportunity to strengthen across the board.\n\nPIERRE-EMILE HØJBJERG\n\nLoan\n\nTottenham: B+\n\nMarseille: B-\n\nSpurs will be happy to get a decent fee for a player whose contract had just a year to run, as the loan contains an obligation to sign him permanently for €20m when it expires. Højbjerg didn't seem to command the trust of Ange Postecoglou -- he only made eight league starts in 2023-24 despite plenty of injury issues affecting the team -- so it's a smart play.\n\nMarseille's summer so far has seen them appoint a manager from Brighton (Roberto De Zerbi), sign a striker from Manchester United (Mason Greenwood), and now a midfielder from Tottenham. Usually it's English clubs plucking talent from Ligue 1, so they're really flipping the script. Højbjerg is a solid addition and a perfect professional. At 28, he's got plenty left in the tank and will anchor the midfield well.\n\nWill Leny Yoro be fit to start the season for Man United?\n\nManchester United's new defender Leny Yoro has been seen on crutches and wearing a foot protector, raising doubts about his fitness ahead of the new season.\n\nJuly 18\n\nLENY YORO\n\n€62m (£53.3m; $67.5m)\n\nLille: A\n\nManchester United: B+\n\nYoro is one of the finest young central defenders that football has seen in some time. At just 18 years old, there are some understandably rough edges to his game, but most who see him agree that we're looking at a potential great.\n\nLille will be sad to lose him after only one full season, but with only one year left on his contract, they're understandably willing to cash in while they can. Some are questioning Man United for paying a significant fee in order to sign someone who would be a free agent in 12 months, but the reality is that if they don't buy him now, Yoro would be likely holding a Real Madrid shirt this time next year. It does hold them back from an A grade, though.\n\nÁLVARO MORATA\n\n€13m ($14.2m)\n\nAtletico Madrid: D\n\nAC Milan: A\n\nHe is perhaps the ultimate modern journeyman striker, and after captaining Spain to Euro 2024 victory, he embarks on yet another new adventure, this time with AC Milan.\n\nThe fee is a very small price to pay for a player whose goal-scoring record at the top level is more than proven, as is his mentality, work ethic and will to win. He even has strong Serie A experience, having won two titles with Juventus in the past.\n\nUltimately, Atlético Madrid's hand was forced -- Milan activated a release clause -- and they'll have to part with a lot more money in order to sign his replacement.\n\nMASON GREENWOOD\n\n€30m (£25.2m, $32.8m)\n\nManchester United: B\n\nMarseille: B\n\nOnce Manchester United decided Mason Greenwood would not be part of the club moving forward, their goal became simple: find a club willing to spend. All things considered, what they got from the French side isn't bad going.\n\nThe loan to Getafe last season, in which he scored eight goals and provided six assists, was an excellent reminder of what he's capable of and was enough to convince Marseille to take him on. He remains a very good footballer, so he should succeed in Ligue 1.\n\nJADEN PHILOGENE\n\n€15.4m (£13m, $19m)\n\nHull City: C\n\nAston Villa: A-\n\nEleven months ago, Jaden Philogene left Aston Villa in search of first-team football despite greatly impressing on their preseason tour. Now, after one stellar campaign in the Championship, he's back.\n\nThis price is a bargain for Villa: Ipswich Town had originally agreed an £18m deal, only for Villa to step in, turn his head and use the sell-on clause they negotiated last summer to get a discount. Hull will struggle to replace his quality like for like.\n\nSÁVIO\n\n€40m (£33.7m, $43.6m)\n\nTroyes: A+\n\nManchester City: A\n\nSávio was the true breakout star of La Liga last season, scoring nine goals and providing 10 assists and helping Girona into the Champions League. This blazing form came out of nowhere, as his previous campaign consisted of just eight substitute appearances for PSV Eindhoven split up by injury.\n\nManchester City have seen fit to move him across the CFG portfolio, from Troyes to Girona and now to the Premier League. Pep Guardiola will love his dynamism, burst and unselfish delivery, plus the fact he can operate on either flank without issue. Troyes will love the €40m fee; you'd imagine they can do a lot with that in the French third tier.\n\nGEORGES MIKAUTADZE\n\n€18m ($19.6m)\n\nMetz: B+\n\nLyon: A\n\nGeorges Mikautadze was one of the surprise stars of Euro 2024, scoring three goals as Georgia made history and won admirers across the globe. He's had a curious career so far, but in making this move, you get the impression he's now firmly back on the track to the top.\n\nBoth clubs get a strong grade for the deal: Lyon must spend a small sum for a quality, young striker, while for Metz have essentially made a profit after signing him permanently from Ajax despite getting relegated from Ligue 1 last season, safe in the knowledge they'd be able to find him a new club just a few weeks later.\n\nSERHOU GUIRASSY\n\n€18m ($19.5m)\n\nStuttgart: D\n\nBorussia Dortmund: A-\n\nSerhou Guirassy set the Bundesliga ablaze last season with an incredible goal-scoring campaign, netting 28 from just 25 starts. Those are remarkable, Robert Lewandowski-type numbers. When it was revealed his release clause was a lowly €18m, it became a matter of time before he earned a move to one of Europe's elite. Somewhat predictably, Dortmund have pounced.\n\nThe reason we're holding this grade back from a full-blown A is that up until last season, Guirassy had never surpassed 11 league goals in a season; now, suddenly, at age 28, he's scored 28. Is it a one-off? Or the new normal? There's a very small amount of risk here, hence the minus.\n\nJuly 14\n\nJOSHUA ZIRKZEE\n\n€42.5m (£35.7m, $46m)\n\nBologna: B\n\nManchester United: B\n\nZirkzee was once viewed as Robert Lewandowski's heir at Bayern Munich, but things didn't quite go to plan. Years later, after a long, circuitous route back to the top, he has signed for Man United after an impressive campaign helping Bologna into the Champions League.\n\nFans may need to be patient with the 23-year-old initially, as they did with Rasmus Højlund, because Zirkzee scored only nine non-penalty goals in Serie A last season. His real brilliance came in linking play, creating chances for others and pressing well.\n\nA €42.5m fee isn't much to stake on a good, young, still developing player -- but the fact that Zirkzee hasn't shown that killer instinct just yet holds him back from an A grade.\n\nJuly 12\n\nRENATO VEIGA\n\n€14m (£11.8m, $15.2m)\n\nFC Basel: C\n\nChelsea: A-\n\nCentre-back? Left-back? Defensive midfielder? Veiga is only 20, but so far he has flashed the ability to do all of the above to a strong level. That's an impressive level of versatility for one still learning his trade.\n\nThe €14m fee is a small price to pay for such potential, with Veiga standing out as yet another example of Chelsea's strong scouting at younger ages. Exactly how big his role will be to begin with is not clear, but he does profile well as an inverted full-back for new manager Enzo Maresca.\n\nJuly 11\n\nJOÃO PALHINHA\n\n€50m (£43m, $54.8m)\n\nFulham: C\n\nBayern Munich: B\n\nLast summer, on deadline day, Bayern got Palhinha all the way to Munich, through a medical and even into a photo shoot in the kit ... only for the €65m deal to then fall through. A year on, they've acted much earlier and sealed the deal; this time, they got their man even cheaper.\n\nPalhinha has been incredible for Fulham: A duel-winning machine, a set-piece nuisance and a massive influence on midfield proceedings. He's the best player to wear the shirt for some time and will be impossible to replace like-for-like. The fee is fine, but not quite standout. Bayern clearly see his qualities and, in signing him at age 28, must believe he can have a big impact on their team from the start.\n\nJuly 10\n\nKHÉPHREN THURAM\n\n€20m ($21.6m)\n\nNice: B-\n\nJuventus: B+\n\nJuventus' midfield is going to look very different in 2024-25, as Thuram follows hot on the heels of Douglas Luiz signing from Aston Villa. Thuram is a super-smooth midfielder with press-resistant qualities and who can glide through the middle of the park with ease. The issue last season was that he didn't necessarily show these qualities often enough, which may explain why the fee comes fairly cheap.\n\nPerhaps moving to the club his legendary father, Lillian, played for will inspire Khéphren and restore him back to his top level?\n\nJuly 7\n\nMICHAEL OLISE\n\n€60m (£50.7m; $64.4m)\n\nCrystal Palace: A\n\nBayern Munich: B\n\nHarry Kane in 2023; Olise in 2024. Bayern are sensing opportunity in the English market in a way they rarely have before. They've plumped for Olise in an attempt to refresh their wing corps, no doubt swayed by the remarkable creative inventiveness and goal-scoring form the Frenchman finished the 2023-24 season in (four goals and three assists in his final six games).\n\nFrom Palace's perspective, it's a massive fee -- by far the largest in their history -- and it's always better to move players to a club on the continent, as there's significantly less chance Olise will score and break local hearts on a return to Selhurst Park.\n\nJuly 6\n\nTHIAGO ALMADA\n\n$21m (€19.6m)\n\nAtlanta United: B\n\nBotafogo: B\n\nAlmada's long-anticipated MLS exit has finally happened, although somewhat surprisingly, he hasn't taken the step to Europe ... yet.\n\nIn a curious deal, Almada has initially joined Botafogo with a view to joining French side Lyon later down the line, according to ESPN Brasil. Both clubs are owned by the same group, Eagle Football Holdings. Atlanta will be devastated to lose one of the league's finest players but have at least earned a record MLS fee in return: $21m rising to a potential $29m with add-ons.\n\nJuly 5\n\nMICHELE DI GREGORIO\n\n€18m ($19.5m)\n\nMonza: C\n\nJuventus: A\n\nIt's time for a new era between the sticks for Juventus. After seven years and over 250 appearances for the Old Lady, Wojciech Szczesny will move on to new things; in his place comes Di Gregorio, who has shot to prominence thanks to an incredible 2023-24 campaign with Monza.\n\nStatistically speaking, he was the best shot-stopper in Serie A last season, conceding 10.4 fewer goals than expected based on the shots he faced. He also showcased true prowess with the ball at his feet, which is a quality new manager Thiago Motta will be extremely attracted to. All that for just €18m? It's a brilliant deal for Juve.\n\nJuly 4\n\nDAVID RAYA\n\n£27m ($34.3m)\n\nBrentford: B-\n\nArsenal: B+\n\nArsenal made Raya's loan deal permanent for £27m (plus £3m in add-ons) after an excellent 2023-24 campaign. He took little time to usurp Aaron Ramsdale and then never looked back, contributing strongly to the Premier League's best defensive unit. The price they've ended up paying feels like it's on the cheap side for a trusty, dependable No. 1, and it's clear he has earned great faith from Mikel Arteta and the coaching staff.\n\nThere's no risk to this deal whatsoever. The only thing holding it back from an A grade is that Raya still has a way to go before he can be considered one of the world's best at his position, but at 28 there's still room for him to grow.\n\nJuly 2\n\nARCHIE GRAY\n\n£40m ($50.7m)\n\nLeeds United: A\n\nTottenham: B\n\nFailure to get promoted back to the Premier League at the first time of asking comes with many costs, chief among them the loss of treasured players. To Leeds, Gray was not only a phenomenal prospect and player, but also family: His father (Frank) played for Leeds, while his uncle (Eddie) was a true Leeds great.\n\nAt the very least, he's gone for a great fee, and £40m is no small sum to part with for Tottenham, but they'll be rightly confident in Gray as a footballer. When you watch him, it becomes immediately apparent that the midfielder/right-back is highly intelligent and talented in so many ways; his confidence and positional versatility belie the fact that he's still just 18.\n\nKIERNAN DEWSBURY-HALL\n\n£30m ($38m)\n\nLeicester City: D\n\nChelsea: B+\n\nDewsbury-Hall reunites with manager Enzo Maresca at Chelsea. They combined to guide Leicester City to promotion to the Premier League last season and will now combine at Stamford Bridge. It's a solid addition for the Blues. Dewsbury-Hall is a good player who will help with the squad's adaption to a very different new style -- although he doesn't solve any problem positions for Chelsea.\n\nFrom Leicester's perspective, though, they've not only lost arguably their best player upon promotion, but the fee seems pretty low compared to some of the other deals being struck around this time.\n\nEmotional Endrick struggles to hold back tears during unveiling\n\nReal Madrid's newest signing Endrick struggled to hold back tears as he was unveiled at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n\nJuly 1\n\nENDRICK\n\n€72m ($77.3m)\n\nPalmeiras: A+\n\nReal Madrid: A-\n\nThere are plenty in Brazil who believe that we're looking at football's next great No. 9 striker. And when Brazilians say that, you sit up and listen -- they know a thing or two about what makes a goal scorer. Securing his signature early continues Real Madrid's quest to hoover up all of the best Brazilian talent, with Endrick following in the recent footsteps of Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo. Though he can't join officially until he turns 18 on July 21 because of FIFA regulations.\n\nIt's a lot of money to spend on a teenager, but he's quite experienced for his age, having clocked more than 50 top-level appearances in South America, and he's off the mark for his nation too. Moving to Real Madrid is a huge step, but the evidence so far suggests he'll take it in his stride.\n\nIGOR THIAGO\n\n€35m (£30m, $38m)\n\nClub Brugge: A\n\nBrentford: B\n\nBrentford are almost always one step ahead of the game, and in agreeing to sign Thiago well ahead of the transfer window they've prepared well for whatever may happen this summer with regard to the potential departures of Ivan Toney and Bryan Mbeumo.\n\nThiago was named Europa Conference League Young Player of the Season after scoring five goals for Club Brugge, showcasing strength, powerful shooting and a love for the rough-and-tumble side of forward play -- which is a good sign when it comes to transitioning to the Premier League, as it's a big step and nothing is guaranteed.\n\nLUIS GUILHERME\n\n€30m (£25.3m, $32.4m)\n\nPalmeiras: A\n\nWest Ham: B\n\nEndrick is not the only talented teenager from Palmeiras on the move this summer, as Luis Guilherme became an early statement signing for West Ham. He's still fairly inexperienced at senior level (he has just five league starts to his name) but has shown flashes of great potential both off the bench for his club and for Brazil in youth tournaments.\n\nHis turn of pace is good, as is his control in tight spaces, but as ESPN's South American expert Tim Vickery notes, he has work to do on his weaker right foot. This is both an exciting signing for the Hammers and yet another big transfer windfall for Palmeiras.\n\nCHARLES DE KETELAERE\n\n€24m ($25.7m)\n\nAC Milan: B\n\nAtalanta: A\n\nDe Ketelaere's €32m move to AC Milan from Club Brugge in 2022 simply did not work out, but at Atalanta he seems to have found a home. He made 25 league starts while on loan there last season, scoring 10 and assisting eight, plus he played a significant role in La Dea's Europa League win in May.\n\nFor Atalanta, making him a permanent fixture just makes sense; the fee is pretty reasonable for a 23-year-old attacking midfielder who they already know suits the team and manager. For Milan, there's certainly some lost potential at play, but recouping a decent amount of the original fee allows them to strengthen other areas of the squad.\n\nHIROKI ITO\n\n€23m ($25m)\n\nStuttgart: B\n\nBayern Munich: A\n\nStuttgart's rise to second place in the Bundesliga was one of the stories of the 2023-24 season, but even securing Champions League football hasn't stopped the top teams moving for their top players.\n\nIt's a blow for Stuttgart to lose such an important player; Ito was excellent in splitting his time between left-back and centre-back for a defence that conceded just 39 goals. No doubt that versatility and flexibility -- along with the fact he's left-footed -- was key to Bayern's interest. Only Benjamin Pavard (€35m) has left Stuttgart for a bigger fee in the club's history, but even still, in this market, €30m might feel a touch low in their eyes.\n\nMATVEY SAFONOV\n\n€20m ($21.4m)\n\nKrasnodar: A\n\nPSG: B\n\nIt can be tough for goalkeepers to earn top-level exposure when they're young, but Safonov broke into Krasnodar's first-team as a teenager in 2018 and never looked back. Now 25, he's Russia's No. 1, has more than 175 appearances under his belt and is ready for the next step.\n\nPSG is a slightly odd landing spot, given the goalkeeping quality already present, but the capital club have never been shy about adding depth and quality in that position. Safonov will now battle Italy No. 1 Gianluigi Donnarumma and Spain's Under-19 European Championship winner in Arnau Tenas for playing time; serial Champions League winner Keylor Navas will depart the club this summer.\n\nTAYLOR HARWOOD-BELLIS\n\n£20m ($25.5m)\n\nManchester City: A-\n\nSouthampton: A\n\nHarwood-Bellis was a vital cog in Southampton's successful charge to promotion in 2023-24, starting 43 games in the heart of defence and showcasing incredible poise and prowess on the ball. He quickly became key to a possession-based style that swept opponents away with ease.\n\nAchieving promotion triggered a £20m clause for Saints to sign him permanently, and it's a deal that perfectly suits all parties: Southampton have paid an acceptable fee for an excellent young English defender, Harwood-Bellis can finally test himself fully at Premier League level and Man City continue to make good money from allowing their academy players to leave, which is key to funding their spending.\n\nIBRAHIM OSMAN\n\n€18.95m (£16m, $20.4m)\n\nNordsjaelland: A\n\nBrighton: B+\n\nOver the past five years or so, FC Nordsjaelland have produced a litany of exciting young wingers who have all made big moves to top European clubs: Mohammed Kudus headed to Ajax (then West Ham), Ernest Nuamah signed for Lyon, Kamaldeen Sulemana moved to Rennes (then Southampton); and Osman is the next off the production line.\n\nBrighton know exactly what they're doing here, as two years ago they signed winger Simon Adingra from the Danish club and have now returned for Osman. He scored six goals and had seven assists in the Danish Superliga in 2023-24 and some of his goals were absolutely spectacular.\n\nASSAN OUÉDRAOGO\n\n€10m (£8.5m, $10.8m)\n\nSchalke 04: C\n\nRB Leipzig: A\n\nSchalke have a rich history of producing fine footballers from their academy -- Manuel Neuer, Leroy Sané and Mesut Özil spring to mind -- and it looks like Ouédraogo could be the next to have developed there.\n\nHe was ripe for the picking thanks to Schalke's struggles in the second division and a lowly €10m release clause, although there is a chance they'll get him back on loan after a summer assessment. Leipzig have played the role Bayern Munich traditionally do here, swooping in early for top domestic talent in determined fashion.\n\nLUCAS BERGVALL\n\n€10m (£8.5m, $10.8m)\n\nDjurgårdens: A\n\nSpurs: A\n\nBack in February, Spurs agreed to the signing of Bergvall ahead of Barcelona and will welcome him to the club this summer. It's a big move that completes his meteoric rise from the Swedish second division to the Premier League in just two years.\n\nEach club gets an A grade, as it's a deal that works for all. A fee of €10m isn't a lot for Spurs to put down on a player who is full of potential, and having graduated from the same academy as Dejan Kulusevski in Sweden, the 18-year-old will have help settling in. But €10m is a lot for Djurgårdens, though; in fact, it's the biggest outgoing transfer fee in Allsvenskan history.\n\nMARC GUIU\n\n€6m (£5.1m; $6.4m)\n\nBarcelona: D\n\nChelsea: B+\n\nThe striking thing about the Barcelona academy graduate is that he's not very Barcelona at all. At 6-foot-2, with a centre-forward build and skillset to match, he's a far cry from the type of player you typically associate with La Masia. The 18-year-old burst on to the scene last season, scoring with his first touch on his debut against Athletic Club, but slipped back down the pecking order and ended up back with the B team in April.\n\nAfter paying his release clause of just €6m, Chelsea were happy to gamble on such a player; Barça, understandably, aren't particularly happy to see him go so soon.\n\nTIMO WERNER\n\nLoan\n\nRB Leipzig: C\n\nSpurs: A\n\nWerner made a positive impact on loan at Spurs last season, so the decision to bring him back for another 12 months was likely an easy one. His direct, quick style of play suited Ange Postecoglou's tactics and his low crosses into the box from the left flank became a feature of their late-season play. Having qualified for the Europa League, Spurs clearly need more players to fill out the squad, so nabbing Werner on loan again -- with a €10m option to sign him permanently in 2025 -- is smart, risk-free business.\n\nFrom RB Leipzig's perspective, though, it's another year without much of a return from a player they paid €20m to sign from Chelsea in 2022.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo vs. Kylian Mbappe: Whose 'Hala Madrid' was better?\n\nAfter Kylian Mbappe repeated Cristiano Ronaldo's \"Hala Madrid\" shout to the Bernabeu crowd from 2009, take a look at who did it better.\n\nKYLIAN MBAPPÉ\n\nFree\n\nPSG: F\n\nReal Madrid: A+\n\nFootball's worst-kept secret is finally out in the open. Mbappé, arguably the world's best player, will join the reigning European champions Real Madrid. He makes an already sensational attack even stronger, ensuring everyone will be tuning in to watch Los Blancos in 2024-25.\n\nThe Frenchman's whopping signing-on fee (reported to be €100m) means this isn't really a free transfer, but Madrid have capped the cost of a superstar somewhat -- and PSG received absolutely nothing for him, having paid €180m to sign him from Monaco in 2017.\n\nSERGIŇO DEST\n\nFree\n\nBarcelona: C+\n\nPSV Eindhoven: B-\n\nDest enjoyed an excellent season on loan with PSV Eindhoven in 2023-24, only for a torn ACL to cut his campaign short in April and force him to miss the Copa América for the USMNT too. The Dutch club are taking something of a risk here, gambling on him making a full recovery in 2025, but are unsurprisingly comfortable doing so on the basis it's a free transfer -- having turned down an €11m option to sign him previously.\n\nBarcelona get no transfer fee, having signed him for €20m back in 2020 from Ajax, but ESPN sources confirmed that they will get a percentage of any future transfer fee. They're under pressure to bring their hefty wage bill down for registration purposes anyway, so it's ultimately a deal that seems to suit all parties.\n\nTOSIN ADARABIOYO\n\nFree\n\nFulham: F\n\nChelsea: A\n\nWith Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) hanging heavily over Premier League clubs, free transfers have arguably never been more attractive. Although Chelsea look pretty well stocked for centre-backs -- Levi Colwill, Axel Disasi, Wesley Fofana, Benoît Badiashile and Trevoh Chalobah are already in the squad -- signing Adarabioyo for free makes sense.\n\nOver the past four seasons with Fulham, he has blossomed into a very solid centre-back whose long, threaded passes forward can change a game in an instant. They'll be crestfallen to lose him for nothing, and even more so that he's headed to their west London rivals.\n\nLLOYD KELLY\n\nFree\n\nBournemouth: D\n\nNewcastle United: A+\n\nLike with Tosin, Kelly quickly marked himself out as one of the most attractive early transfers this summer by virtue of being available for free. He plays both left-back and centre-back -- two positions Newcastle have had terrible injury luck in -- so he feels like an extremely astute addition that potentially solves two problems at once.\n\nAdd that to the fact that not only is he homegrown, but he's worked with Magpies manager Eddie Howe before on the south coast, and it's a transfer that just seems clever in every way.\n\nSAMUEL ILING-JUNIOR & ENZO BARRENECHEA\n\n€22m (£18.6m; $23.6m)\n\nJuventus: B\n\nAston Villa: B\n\nOne of Aston Villa's summer targets is to deepen their squad ahead of a Champions League campaign, so scooping up two young talents from Juventus' conveyor belt of next generation excellence is a solid strategy.\n\nSamuel Iling-Junior is returning to England, having successfully made the jump into senior football abroad, and is an exciting, explosive wide player. Enzo Barrenechea is rewarded for a breakout 2023-24 campaign on loan at Frosinone with an intriguing next step. Juve won't be thrilled to lose either of these players, but funds needed to be raised to sign Douglas Luiz.\n\nJune 30\n\nDOUGLAS LUIZ\n\n€50m (£42.5m; $53.6m)\n\nAston Villa: B\n\nJuventus: B\n\nThere's no doubt Villa will be distraught to lose Douglas Luiz; he was one of their best players last season and means a lot to the fans, having been at the club since 2019. But Villa's position with regard to Profit and Sustainability Regulation (PSR) rules forced them into allowing a big exit and Luiz was the one to go. A fee of €50m is a lot to receive in return, but it's still a tough one to take.\n\nVilla's loss is Juventus' gain, though, and incoming manager Thiago Motta will love the fact he has a new playmaking midfielder to utilise as a brand new era in Turin begins.\n\nELLIOT ANDERSON\n\n€50m (£35.5m; $44.4m)\n\nNewcastle United: A\n\nNottingham Forest: C\n\nNewcastle found themselves needing to make a sale to comply with Profit & Sustainably Rules so, in what has been a theme for the summer, they turned to an academy graduate in their hour of need.\n\nAnderson, 21, was the reluctant pick. He's been a handy squad player for Newcastle over the last few seasons and clocked just over 1,000 Premier League minutes in 2023-24 while battling a back injury. Still, the £35m fee attached to him feels massive, and therefore an awful lot for Forest in terms of investment.\n\nYANKUBA MINTEH\n\n€50m (£33m; $41.7m)\n\nNewcastle United: A\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion: B-\n\nYankuba Minteh's Newcastle career came and went in a flash! He signed for around €7m in the summer of 2023, headed straight out on loan to Feyenoord for the season, notched 10 goals and five assists in just 1,463 Eredivisie minutes, and has now moved to Brighton more than four times that initial fee.\n\nHe's a reluctant, yet lucrative and necessary transfer for the Magpies who were under pressure to make some money on outgoings. For Brighton, it's yet another young talented in the door -- although at a significantly higher price than we're used to seeing.\n\nOMARI HUTCHINSON\n\n€50m (£20m; $25.3m)\n\nChelsea: C+\n\nIpswich Town: A\n\nIpswich Town smashed their transfer record to sign Omari Hutchinson permanently following his exceptional loan spell at Portman Road in 2023-24. He got better as the season went on, developing into a key player who scored 10 goals, assisted five, provided some stunning moments and pressed extremely effectively from the front.\n\nUndoubtedly, this is a big get for Ipswich, who need quality difference-makers if they're to survive a Premier League campaign. Chelsea book a tidy profit, which is no bad thing in 2024, but it's hard to escape the feeling that for a player of Hutchinson's potential, £20m may end up looking a little cheap in the end.\n\nHow Chelsea are making £32 million from a swap deal with Aston Villa\n\nGab & Juls explain the details of Chelsea's Ian Maatsen swap deal for Aston Villa's Omari Kellyman.\n\nJune 29\n\nOMARI KELLYMAN\n\n£19m ($24.1m)\n\nAston Villa: A\n\nChelsea: B\n\nChelsea's quest to hoover up as much young potential as possible has continued this summer with the signing of Kellyman. The 18-year-old joined Villa from Derby County two years ago and is now on the move once again.\n\nIn the handful of senior minutes Kellyman received last season, he looked a player brimming with potential -- smooth on the turn, clever in his positioning and capable of playing across the forward line or as the No. 10. Villa will be sad to lose such a player, but it still goes down as a great bit of business from their point of view, as the club were under pressure to generate revenue ahead of June 30's PSR deadline.\n\nJune 28\n\nIAN MAATSEN\n\n£37.5m ($47.7m)\n\nChelsea: A\n\nAston Villa: B\n\nAs the cliché goes, qualifying for the Champions League opens up fresh possibilities for clubs in the transfer market. Aston Villa are the latest to take advantage of this, signing Netherlands left-back Maatsen in part thanks to their new position among Europe's elite.\n\nMaatsen shone on loan at Borussia Dortmund over the second half of last season, playing a key role in the German side's run to the Champions League final. He's both a significant addition to Unai Emery's side and a significant source of funds for Chelsea, who found themselves under PSR pressure ahead of the June 30 deadline."
