Facts and stats

FC Basel have lost last two European matches, conceding five goals in both matches. They have not lost three European games in a row since October 2008.

Basel defeated fellow English side Chelsea both home and away in the 2013-14 Champions League group stages.

These two sides have met just twice before, these coming in the 2002-03 Champions League: they played out two score draws (1-1 and 3-3).

Liverpool have not lost any of their last nine matches against Swiss opponents (W6 D3).

The last five European games that Liverpool have played against Swiss teams have seen 29 goals scored; an average of 5.8 goals per game.

Mario Balotelli only managed two goals and didn't assist a single goal in the 2013-14 CL for AC Milan. He already has one goal in one CL app for Liverpool.

Balotelli has 10 touches in the opposition box on MD1 - no player managed more than this.

Breel Embolo (17y 214d) was one of only two 17 year olds to play on MD1 of the Champions League this season.

Predicted line-ups

Ones to watch

Marco Streller : Basel-born, vastly experienced forward who at 33 knows every trick in the book and leads the team with an incredible work ethic.

Fabian Schär : Central defender who has been linked with almost every big club in Europe – including Liverpool. Massive threat on set-pieces with his heading ability.

Derlis Gonzalez : Lightning quick winger from Paraguay creates and takes chances,

and at just 20 is seen as hugely promising for the future in Basel.

Who's saying what?

Paulo Sousa: “We need to be successful domestically, but we also want to compete in European football so that we can have the likes of Real Madrid and Liverpool here on a regular basis. After that, the target is to beat them and to reach the knockout stages. If we can do that this season then great, but it is early days.”

Brendan Rodgers: “He learnt very early on that you need to prepare. I think that whenever the younger players look how calm Stevie is, they know he has been at that level before. They know he has been right the way through and won the tournament. They can draw inspiration from that. He is calm and, whether it is a Champions League game or a league match, his focus is very much the same. Even here, where the atmosphere is good and you need a calm head to dictate the tempo, there are not many better in world football."
