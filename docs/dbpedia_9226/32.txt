Octalux is our new black octopus with sequins and golden eyes. It is beautifully luxurious and incredible to the touch. She will know how to soothe the most anxious and calm the most agitated.

Why put weight in a plush?

The weight helps create a sense of calm in several situations.

The octopus can be used when a child is feeling anxious, when he/she needs help to calm down, during meals (by laying the octopus on the childâ€™s knees) and to promote concentration during homework, at school, at preschool or at home.

*To be used under adult supervision

*The weight of the plush should not exceed 10% of the child's weight

*Do not put the plush or its contents in the microwave

*Suitable for children aged 3+ years.
