        "text": "“As the album started to take shape, we wanted to add in nods and references to all the music we grew up listening to, so once it was for sure, we were doing a full-length album tonight of decisions, both consciously and unconsciously, we made.”\n\n“‘Writhe’ is supposed to have the feel of Chase’s (our drummer’s) favorite tune by a well-known band that is no more. The radio intro was one of the last things added to the album, as the out-of-tune acoustic had been there as a nod to another well-known band that is still going. The opening lyric is a nod to a progressive band from a bygone era, and the overall message of the song is about maturing, be it from child to adult or from amateur to professional, and all of the decisions that make that happen and the proper mindset one should adopt to make it the best. The radio voice is actually a nod to our first album (From the Planet of Love), as the same person did a spoken word piece on that album. The song title is a reference to The Golden Girls, as one of the characters (Dorothy) says the words ‘Svelte’, which means thin or skinny, and ‘Writhe’, which means to move around continually. To me, it sounds like those two words are from a lost era, and since we already had a song called ‘Svelte’ (for the Golden Girls reason stated above), I went with ‘Writhe’, as the movement (sometimes uncomfortable but always constant) is what it takes to mature.”\n\nOctalux will starting shows promoting the new album ‘Amen to Oblivion’.\n\nThey also are putting on their own music festival called I-we-Y (eye we why) specifically for individuals with disabilities on October 8th, 2023.\n\nThe band is about to shoot a video for the next single.\n\nOctalux stands for truth, energy, love, and self-assurance.\n\nThey stand for the lost, the found, and everyone in between.\n\nDespite the current trends in music, rock’n’roll is eternal, and they are proud to be the bearers of the torch for those who want to take life and make it their own."
