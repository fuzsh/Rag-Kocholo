        "text": "We are more than excited to presentn to you the logo of Thessaloniki 2024: 101st International Session of the #EYP designed by Nikita Salukvadze (GE), a valued member of the European Youth Parliament (EYP)‚òÄ In his words: \"With this logo, I wanted to focus on merging the human and more organic aspects of societies with the more technological future we are advancing towards. You can see a tree, a universal symbol of growth and life, tansposing into elements similar to a circuit board, often associated with technological advancements and efficiency. Ultimately, the logo represents our ability to coexist, synergise, and most importantly, evolve into a more technological world. I imagine this topic will be very present throughout Thessaloniki 2024.\" Follow our page for more information on our event and how you can become part of the #HarbourofInnovation üåä\n\nIn fewer than 6 weeks from now, Bangalore International Exhibition Centre will host Confederation of Indian Industry's Excon 2023, arguably South Asia's Largest Construction Equipment Event (source: event website). For 5 days starting Dec 12. Supported by the ICEMA (The Indian Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association) as Sector Partner, the expo is likely to draw 1,300 exhibitors and over 60,000 professionals as visitors. That means literally millions of conversations in a 5 day period. Some of them will be useful, meaningful and productive. Most will be noise. If you are an exhibitor Excon 2023, with significant money and people commitments and you take exhibitions seriously, you have just a 2 week window to plan to succeed - that means planning to have strong, meaningful conversations, to listen, share and to capture feedback from prospects, partners and customers. That's where Helpie Event can help. Talk to us. We love listening and helping you listen.

The regions of Egypt, the Middle East and North Africa offered many first-time exhibitors the opportunity to invest in these growth markets. 383 exhibitors from 19 countries took the opportunity to show their colors in Cairo. In addition to local companies, exhibitors from the UK, France, Austria, Belgium, Turkey, Spain, Switzerland, Morocco, the USA and Germany, among others, also came to Egypt. The Egyptian trade fair organizer AGEX (Arabian German Exhibitions & Publishing Ltd) has already been holding its METAL & STEEL EGYPT trade fair since 2010. The cooperation with Messe D√ºsseldorf results in valuable synergies for all sectors involved. üöÄ There was noticeable interest in the exhibition halls right from the start of the five trade fairs. Over 7,000 professionals (around 10% international) traveled to Cairo over three days to network and find out about trends and innovations from the industries and discover the latest machinery, equipment, products and services from the #metal and #steel industry and the #wire, #cable, #tube, #foundry and #metallurgy sectors. üóìÔ∏è There will be another edition of the trade fairs in the first half of 2025. At that time, the five industry players will once again present themselves in Cairo. The exact date will be found with the regional organizer and in consideration of all satellites of the metal trade fair portfolio made by Messe D√ºsseldorf. ‚ÑπÔ∏è In the meantime, up-to-date information will be shared here: www.gifa-mea.com www.metec-mea.com\n\nWith just one year remaining until its grand opening, the preparations for the 2025 World Exposition in #Osaka are accelerating üöÄ. Several nations have commenced construction on their own pavilions in recent months. Yet, there are lingering concerns regarding the lack of public enthusiasm ü§î. #Expo2025 has faced challenges related to escalating costs, particularly in venue development, which have surged to nearly double the initial estimate, reaching $1.5 billion üí∏. The financial burden will be shared equally among three entities: the central government, the Osaka prefectural and city governments, and the business sector. #Japan #worldexpo #Osakaexpo https://lnkd.in/dbbaeYjC"
