        "meta_description": "A lasting friendship! Our plushes are weighted. That means they are heavy—They weigh 1.5 to 2 kilograms. They have several benefits. Even the sequins on their tentacles have a purpose! They help satisfy children’s sensory and attentional needs. Kids love to touch and handle them. Why put weight in a plush? The weight helps create a sense of calm in several situations. Our plushes can be used when a child is feeling anxious, when he/she needs help to calm down, during meals (by laying the octopus on the child’s knees)They promote concentration during homework, at school, at preschool, or at home.",
