        "text": "(INTERVIEWER): EVANGELIST, JERIC YURKANIN.\n\nTHREATPOINT FACEBOOK PAGE\n\nName: Matthew Van Fleet\n\n‚Äì Age: 31 Hometown:\n\n-Old Forge High School: Old Forge High School\n\n‚Äì Favorite Movie: Out Of The Furnace was the last movie I really enjoyed and watched several times.\n\n‚Äì Favorite TV Show: I watch a lot of crime shows on Investigation Discovery. I also enjoy The Family Guy\n\n‚Äì Favorite Actor: I like Matt Damon because he is a real stand-up guy with good character. Very rare to have that in Hollywood.\n\n‚Äì Favorite Band: I listen to such a wide variety of music, it‚Äôs very difficult to narrow it down to one band.\n\n‚Äì Favorite Song: So many amazing songs out there, I just can‚Äôt choose one, haha\n\n‚Äì Favorite Restaurant: Any mom and pop shop and local business. I am not into corporate chain restaurants.\n\n‚Äì Favorite Coffee Shop: Any coffee shop! I drink about a pot of coffee a day üôÇ\n\n‚Äì Favorite Food: Pizza, Wings, Burgers, and French Fries. All the healthy stuff!\n\n‚Äì Bands played in: (5) Octalux (Kentucky), Bury The Wicked (Kentucky), Breakfree Christian Band (local), Cause of Affliction (local), and Threatpoint (Local/Current Band) ‚Äì List of CDs Released and Band Links:\n\nI‚Äôve recorded 5 full-length albums:\n\n‚ÄúNo Apologies For Broken Hearts‚Äù- Octalux\n\n‚ÄúFreedom Is A Lie‚Äù and ‚ÄúTime To Rise‚Äù ‚Äì Cause of Affliction\n\n‚ÄúR.I.P.‚Äù and the Acoustic Album with Threatpoint that will be released in the Summer of this year.\n\nYou can find both Threatpoint and Cause of Affliction on Reverbnation, ITunes, CDbaby, Spotify, Gallery of Sound, or even pick up some Threatpoint merchandise and CDs if you make it out to a show!\n\n1) If you can have dinner with one person from the past or present, who would it be and why?\n\nAnswer: Jesus. It would be such a privilege to be able to share a meal with our Savior and witness all the miracles and teachings he has done while here on Earth.\n\n2) If you can travel to one place in the world, where and why?\n\nAnswer: Since I‚Äôve been to several 3rd world countries, there‚Äôs no place like America. I‚Äôm sure there is so much beauty in the world, but I‚Äôve always wanted to see The Grand Canyon and Niagra Falls. However, I have heard some great things about Europe.\n\n4) If you had the power to change one thing in the world, what would it be?\n\nAnswer: Rid the world of all Iphones, Androids, and all the other touch phone nonsense that people have their faces in 75% of the day. People choose to neglect their families and significant others by putting all their time into these stupid devices by looking at these stupid devices all day. People don‚Äôt think about all the time they waste and life they miss out on by being occupied hours a day by these devices.\n\n5) When did you first fall in love with music?\n\nAnswer: I got a late start as a musician at the age of 23.\n\n6) What musician is your role model, and why?\n\nAnswer: When I became a musician, I never really had any influences or role models. I have high amounts of respect for people who have been successful and have never given up and persevered through all the ups-and-downs of being a musician. Unfortunately, being in a band and touring is very hard. It takes a lot of work and sacrifice to get little, to no recognition. People see the success of bands by seeing them on the big stage, the tours, etc. But regular people have no idea what them bands have gone through to get to that level. The late nights, the out-of-pocket tours, vans breaking down, gear maintenance, driving hours on end and playing to nobody, getting no money or pay from venues, people feeling entitled to ‚Äúfree merch‚Äù because you‚Äôre a ‚Äúbottom of the barrell‚Äù band. It takes years and years of perseverance through all the hard-knocks and setbacks you have as a musician. So I respect any band or musician that has ‚Äúmade it‚Äù and is able to make a living by doing something they are talented and passionate about, even if I am not a fan of their music.\n\n7) Talk about your most memorable show?\n\nAnswer: I‚Äôve had several. Definitely my very first show is one I will never forget. Opening up for Queensryche was awesome, playing at the church opening for Third Day was great. Playing the first ‚ÄúNight Behind the Veil‚Äù show with Breakfree was amazing. You truly felt God‚Äôs presence there, it was a feeling I will never forget. I‚Äôve played hundreds of shows and played all across the country, so it‚Äôs hard to narrow down the best ones.\n\n8) Can you talk about what people can expect when attending a Threatpoint show?\n\nAnswer: Lots of in-your-face type energy and a great stage show. We are a very professional band; stage lights, banners, smoke machines, the whole nine yards. Even though we are a metal band, we aren‚Äôt just a bunch of noise and screaming. Our music is clear and you can understand what Chris is saying, haha. However, you‚Äôre going to have to come out and see for yourself. Our next local show is April 9th at the VSpot in Scranton.\n\n9) Threatpoint has released some songs on soundcloud.com, can you tell me little about the their originals? What can people expect when listening to them?\n\nVery driving, heavier sounding songs with a melodic edge. The songs are very well-written with very good dynamics and great musicianship. Threatpoint had two full-length albums ‚ÄúDead To Rise‚Äù and ‚ÄúCareful What You Wish For‚Äù before I joined the band this past August. We have just recorded our 3rd studio album along with an acoustic album as well. The songs on the 3rd album were already in the process of being written when I joined Threatpoint, however, I was able to contribute my ideas to the songwriting process and put my own bass lines in the songs. Since I am a bassist, I like to play with drummer and accent the hits as much as I can. My job as a bass player to to lock-in with the drums while also following the guitar riffs. I have never just followed the guitar player. If that was the case, I might as well just be a guitarist. Bass players have to have a totally different mind-set when playing a song.\n\nEach song impacts every person in a different way. Listeners usually interpret their own meaning to songs they listen to. Chris writes all the lyrics, I am by no means lyrically savvy. I do know that he uses a lot of biblical references in his lyrics. I don‚Äôt really know much about his lyrical approach, but I do know Chris writes about the hardships and experiences that he has had in life. Also about things he notices in the world today that are so twisted and backwards. But you‚Äôre going to have to ask him more of what people can expect from our songs.\n\n10) A few years ago you played in a Christian band, ‚ÄúBreakfree Band‚Äù, how has that experience help you get to where you are today?\n\nAnswer: Breakfree has helped me become a very well-rounded bassist. Hard Rock and Metal is my roots, however, playing Christian type music is all chords/chord progressions. It was nice to play actual chords and harmonize them to give the songs more flavor. There is a lot of room to really think outside the box and try new things. You learn what works and what doesn‚Äôt. However, the key to being a well-rounded, experienced player is to serve the song. I do incorporate a lot of what I learned by playing Christian music to my current writing style today by using walking bass lines and outline the chords when the song calls for it.\n\n11) How does God play a role in your everyday life and in your profession as a musician?\n\nMy relationship with God is what keeps me grounded and level-headed each day. There are times of course when I backslide and allow the busyness of life and temptations to get in the way and take me away from God. I can definitely feel a difference in my life and attitude when I put God on the back-burner. However, I think about God all the time and spend time with Him in fellowship by prayer and reading His word. I know it is impossible to live the Christian life up to God‚Äôs standards, but His grace and sacrifice of His son has allowed all of us the privilege of having a relationship with Him. I try to glorify God in my playing and not waste the talent and ability He has blessed me with. The environment we play in is pretty tuff sometimes because we aren‚Äôt playing Christian festivals or Churches. However, God needs the light in darkness, it‚Äôs not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. Sometimes I do fall into the temptation of what that environment has to offer, but I have had the opportunity to witness to dozens of people who have approached me and asked me questions because of my biblical tattoos. I‚Äôve had people talk with me and then find out I am a Christian, then just flat out walk away from me. Most people do genuinely listen and are very interested in knowing more about God, so that‚Äôs all I can do is just plant the seed and let God do the rest. Deep down, everyone knows that God is real, you just need to try to let God work through you and put things in a different perspective for them. However, It is our own choice to either receive salvation or deny it. Overall, I try to carry myself, with the help of the Holy Spirit, in a way that glorifies God in everything I do. The Christian life is by no means easy, we are all sinful by nature. So everyday is a struggle, I just leave it all to God and let Him guide me in this life."
