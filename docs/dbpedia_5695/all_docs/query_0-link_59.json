        "text": "POLY and WAVE are the new soft-synths from Samplefuel, a company headed-up by Danny Lux – soundtrack composer for Grey’s Anatomy, My Name is Earl and Boston Legal.\n\nThe synths are based around Steinberg’s Halion Sonic multisample player and share some neat features. The core concept behind POLY and WAVE are the intuitive “Main Page” section, which features a handful of carefully selected parameters designed for quick-and-easy access.\n\nBoth Samplefuel synths feature pages of more advanced controls to really fine-tune your sound – Motion, FX, Synth, Arp, XY and MIDI Play tabs allows you to quickly dial in more advanced parameters or settings.\n\nAt its core POLY is a 3-oscillator synth with up to eight tunable voices, presets can be arranged in layers and multi-timbral stacks for intuitive performances. Wave is a similar concept, but instead of a classic oscillator configuration, it hosts a wavetable engine with a rather awesome looking visual display. Both synths come packed with a huge amount of presets made by Danny himself, with various thoughtfully assigned macros.\n\nThe FX page provides 18 different insert FX to choose from, from compressors and distortion to delays and even a convolution reverb to round it all out.\n\nWhat do you need to get it working?\n\nPOLY and WAVE are both designed for Steinberg Halion Sonic engine, however it also works in the free version from Steinberg – so no extra charge on top of the synths which are each priced at USD $34.99 (Around R500) not bad for a product of such lineage. Samplefuel is also offering a free version of POLY, so you can experience the sound before forking out.\n\nIf you’re keen on POLY or WAVE, head over to the Samplefuel website."
