        "text": "There is no law that says you have to enter into a compulsory license agreement with any organization in South Africa for performing rights. However, if the user chooses not to enter into a license with GRM, it may not perform any of GRMâ€™s repertoire. We strongly discourage this approach, as the nature of the copyright in music is extremely fragmented & most songs will have multiple rights owners. If you chose to play a song that GRM represents without the necessary license, your business will be in infringing upon our copyright which is an offense in South Africa and if you are a broadcaster this may place your license to broadcast at risk.\n\nGRM is committed to a transparent process of licensing & collections on behalf of its principals, and in the unlikely event that GRM along with another claimant make a claim on the same musical work in copyright, the user may select/opt to place the royalties due into an escrow account with its attorneys for the specific musical work until the dispute has been settled between the conflicting parties."
