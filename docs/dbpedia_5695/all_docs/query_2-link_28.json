        "text": "SESAC honored its stellar roster of top film and television composers with the annual SESAC Film & Television Composers Awards Dinner. The invitation-only event was held on June 7, at the chic Casa Del Mar Hotel in Santa Monica, CA, and celebrated the composers of music featured in 2011’s biggest films, primetime television shows and cable programs.\n\nThe SESAC event bestows awards to music composers in the categories of Network TV, Local TV, Cable TV and Film Composing. With over 60 awards given during the evening, some of the most highly rated shows acknowledged were Grey’s Anatomy, Dateline NBC, Parenthood, Two And A Half Men and House among many others.\n\nA major highlight of the evening was the Legacy Award presentation to composer/musician Bruce Miller in recognition of “his outstanding contribution to the world of music” he has made through musicianship, creativity, professional leadership or entrepreneurial contributions. Miller has composed music for such television shows as “Frasier”, “Designing Women” and “Becker” as well as his work on the groundbreaking documentary, “A Man From Hope”, that was a integral part of the Bill Clinton presidential campaign. Miller was on hand to accept the award in front of his family and colleagues."
