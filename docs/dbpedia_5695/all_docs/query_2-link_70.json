        "text": "EMPYREAL AD: THE ULTIMATE ATMOSPHERE DESIGNER\n\nEMPYREAL AD is an advanced atmosphere designer, streamlined to be as creative and as easy to use as possible. For too long, manually designing quality atmospheres has been a painful and intricate process with much sample editing and layering of effects. Now you can use the EMPYREAL engine to bring your soundscapes to life with cutting edge tools. Use the huge number of supplied samples or drag-and-drop your own atmospheres. Adjust and animate loop points, playback direction and loop position with ease to create constantly evolving timbres that you’ll never hear the same way twice. Add a host of FX and chains that can be animated on the fly for total creative freedom, all packed into a logical and ergonomic user experience. This means easy navigation with an efficient dual core sound engine geared perfectly for tempo-synced motion via LFOs, FX sequencers and an automatable blend mixer. With over 1,000 sounds and the ability to load your own samples, EMPYREAL is a virtual instrument environment that will become your new go-to for generating atmospheres without limits!\n\nINTERFACE ERGONOMICS\n\nFor instant gratification, EMPYREAL makes it easy to achieve quick and dirty results, but with little effort take a deep dive into the engine’s myriad of parameter pages to unleash its true core power. It all begins with the interface divided into 4 main sections that govern the two cores (A/B): Main, Edit, FX, Master. This provides an efficient management system for interacting with each core. Easily adjust the individual elements of either core and switch back and forth on the fly. Once you’ve set up the instrument to your needs, use the main view to access only the essential parameters, keeping your workflow clutter-free and streamlined.\n\nMAIN: The Main view is the central dashboard view, where you can blend between 2 atmospheres cores and change any of the major playback aspects of the instrument. With multiple preset browsers, swap out core presets, sound sources, or the entire main instrument preset. In love with a preset? Favorite it right inside the browser so you can revisit it at any time. The Main section is not only a home for your instrument, but a launching point to access the atmosphere’s waveform parameters, core level FX and the master FX chain.\n\nEDIT: The Edit view is where you can make in-depth adjustments with surgical precision. Tweak loop points, loop position, playback direction, volume, pan, tuning, filtering and envelopes. Most of these parameters can also be animated, for surprising playback characteristics.\n\nFX: The FX view offers up a host of powerful hot-swappable FX, powered by the latest features of Kontakt’s internal FX engine, all fully integrated into the EMPYREAL. Along with the built-in FX chain presets and predesigned customizable animations, the creative possibilities are limitless.\n\nMASTER: The Master view is where core A & B come together, with a customizable mastering FX chain to really make your sounds sparkle. Choose from more than 30 powerful mastering FX to polish your finalized atmosphere, making it mix-ready for any production.\n\nINTELLIGENT RANDOMIZATION\n\nGenerate your own unique atmosphere in less than a second! Simple to use, yet fiendishly potent, the randomization features of EMPYREAL will keep your creative juices flowing. Rapidly tap into trillions of starting point combinations with added creative FX. Simply arm the randomizable parameters that you need, then roll the dice. The interface’s intelligent randomization technology will generate inspiring results on the spot, every time!"
