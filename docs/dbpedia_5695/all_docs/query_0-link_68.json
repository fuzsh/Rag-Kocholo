        "text": "The Society of European Stage Authors and Composers (SESAC) went online Wednesday to announce its annual Film & Television Composer Awards, honoring music composers and publishers.\n\nAmong the winners were Christophe Beck for “Frozen II” and Randy Newman for his work on “Marriage Story” and “Toy Story 4.” The celebration took place online and honored music composers in the categories of film, streaming media, cable television, network television and local television.\n\n“It’s been an extraordinarily challenging year for all music creators,” said John Josephson, chairman-CEO of SESAC Rights Management. “This year, more than ever, it’s important that we pause to recognize the excellence of our film and television composers. Without their outstanding contributions to the creative process, the movies and television shows we love would be only a shadow of what they are. We’re beyond thrilled to honor our talented composers and publishers and look forward to celebrating their many accomplishments for years to come.”\n\n“Film and television music is the best it’s ever been, thanks to our wonderful composers,” said Erin Collins, SESAC’s VP of film, television and developing media. While we miss celebrating with them in person this year, their incredible work continues and inspires us all,”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nSESAC was found in 1931 by Paul Heinecke on the principle that “music is the common denominator… a communications instrument that knows no language barrier”.\n\nAwards recipients’ video speeches can be viewed below:\n\nThe full list of honorees is below:\n\nFILM\n\nChristophe Beck: “Frozen II”\n\nThe Newton Brothers (Andy Grush): “Dr. Sleep”\n\nThe Newton Brothers (Taylor Stewart): “Dr. Sleep”\n\nRandy Newman: “Marriage Story,” “Toy Story 4”\n\nDaniel Lopatin: “Uncut Gems”\n\nSTREAMING MEDIA\n\nAndy Grush\n\nBruce Miller\n\nChristophe Beck\n\nChristopher Tyng\n\nDanny Lux\n\nGabriel Mann\n\nJason Derlatka\n\nJon Ehrlich\n\nMatt Mariano\n\nTaylor Stewart\n\nCABLE Television\n\nBen Zebelman\n\nBruce Miller\n\nChristophe Beck\n\nChristopher Tyng\n\nCraig Sharmat\n\nDanny Lux\n\nDennis C.
