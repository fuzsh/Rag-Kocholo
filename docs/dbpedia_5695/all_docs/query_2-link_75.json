        "text": "\"Thank you Emergence Audio for creating such inspiring tools for us composers. Every time I throw Steel Tongue or Clarinet Textures on track I’m writing, I immediately find myself enjoying the music even more. At the same time, these libraries easily serve as some of the best cue starters that I own. They provide the extra layer of organic textures and movement I’ve been looking for in sample libraries for a long time.\"\n\n\"Emergence Audio virtual instruments have quickly become staples of my composing palette. Their string textures are an instant source of inspiration and experimentation, and their vocal textures are a haunting blend of organic and otherworldly. Gems like the infinite bird whistle and clarinet textures fit perfectly in the sonic world of Castlevania: Nocturne, where we are in constant need of sounds that are equal parts evocative and playable. The clarinet multiphonics patch is a particular favorite of mine! These instruments are a fountain of creativity and were clearly built by composers, for composers.\"\n\n\"I find the Emergence Audio instruments to be a breath of fresh air in the realm of sampled strings. There’s a level of emotion and texture in these sounds that I find to be incredibly inspiring and real. They’re now an indispensable part of my writing template.\"\n\n\"I found using Quantum and Violin Textures incredibly intuitive and inspiring. I appreciate how the process to get a desired sound can be as intricate or simple as you'd like while still landing in a great (and usable!) sonic space. The evolution and sense of space the patches have from the get-go make integrating these into my template a breeze!\"\n\n\"Emergence Audio instruments have become a daily source of inspiration and a go-to in my work as a composer. Textures, pads, and pulses that have life and blend perfectly with live instrumentation. Evocative and beautiful in their simplicity. Sounds with a heartbeat. Emergence Audio has created a set of libraries that sound like nothing else out there.\"\n\n“Really enjoying the infinite possibilities of Quantum. The sounds are very cool with a lot of analog character, and it’s lovely to just play some chords and hear the sonorities evolve. The GUI is easy to navigate, but there’s loads of control so you really feel like you can sculpt, modulate and perform to your own taste. I can see this being really useful for scoring anything from dramas to dark thrillers.“\n\n\"Emergence Audio’s Violin and Cello Textures are a new go-to favorite for intuitive organic pad design. As a violinist and electronic musician, I love how this library brings the human lyricism of live bowed instruments together with an innovative automated filter structure. This makes it fun, easy and inspiring to dial in new textures with a few twists of the virtual knobs. These libraries sound beautiful, tactile, and engaging.\"\n\n“The pads are all tasteful and totally usable, none of those ‘filler’ presets that you get with so many libraries. Each one is so well crafted, I love this thing!“\n\n“Violin Textures is a fantastic addition to my scoring template. I am always on the search for sounds that can be used in a hybrid style of scoring. These sounds bridge between organic and electronic in a very inspiring way. They will get a lot of use in the future.“\n\n\"Quantum has become an essential instrument in my toolkit for adding rich texture and movement to my compositions. It features an intuitive GUI that inspires endless possibilities from scratch, while delivering beautifully crafted atmospheric and rhythmic presets ready to plug and play for the busy composer. Quantum is surely a secret weapon for the working professional and hobbyist!\"\n\n“Soprano Textures has become a big part of my template. It adds such magic and color to my pieces. It also blends quite naturally with my voice. I cannot think of a better way to be inspired. So many ideas flourished because of it!“\n\n“Violin Textures is an incredible library that has the power to be the central and forefront part of a cue, or the nuance and subtlety of being an additional textural layer over a lush orchestration. Where Emergence Audio really shines is with how playable all the libraries are. EA’s libraries sound incredible even when playing and sketching them on a midi keyboard, whereas often other company libraries can sound artificial with unrealistic release/decays on the samples. Violin Textures sounds ready to go out of the box and there is a diverse range of presets, pads, pulses and controls to make it stand out in your own music!“\n\n\"Being a creator in multi-genres, Quantum has easily become an essential part of my creative palette. Immediately after going through a few presets, I was easily inspired by the quality, playability and ease of the GUI. Finding the sound you didn't know you were searching for comes quick and effortlessly. I'm happy to include this superb tool to my sonic template.\"\n\n“The Emergence Audio Violin Textures is a perfect tool for creating organic atmospheres and slowly building dramatic passages. Since the engine allows you to combine two articulations, the instrument is at its best creating natural feeling musical conversations; and there’s always a new story waiting!“\n\n“My search is over for a library that bridges the orchestral and soundscape worlds. Quantum is amazing out of the box, and customized, the options are endless. Emergence Audio truly captured the feeling of infinity – it's an all-around great plug-in, a must-have for all studios, and a great addition to my dual synth keytar.“"
