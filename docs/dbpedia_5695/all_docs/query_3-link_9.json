        "text": "I’m not sure when it was, but around the 7th season of Grey’s Anatomy, the quality is not what it used to be. I really do not get the same high from listening to their soundtrack, but I watch the show nonetheless. The soundtrack for many of these early years were released on 4 CDs between 2005 and 20111, all of which I purchased because I enjoyed the music so much. Much of this music I consider as favorites and have them on my iPhone for replaying them regularly (see below). Some of these tracks have been not only used more than once since their original airing on Grey’s Anatomy, but also played with covers. Episode 18 in season 7, the so called Grey’s Anatomy: The Music Event has covers, sung by the show actors, of six of my favorites listed below, as indicated by ‘(1)’.\n\nWhat happened to the quality of the Grey’s Anatomy soundtrack since these were released in the first seven seasons? Did the person responsible for selecting the music for the soundtrack leave? Danny Lux is apparently the Music Coordinator for the show, but I have a hard time believing it’s currently the same Music Coordinator. If the same Music Coordinator is selecting the music, maybe what Rhimes did to the music with the Grey’s Anatomy: The Music Event caused a stroke?\n\nMy Favorites of Released Grey’s Anatomy Soundtracks\n\nOn Volume 1\n\nThe Postal Service “Such Great Heights“\n\nTegan and Sara “Where Does the Good Go?”\n\nMike Doughty “Looking at the World from the Bottom of a Well”\n\nGet Set Go “Wait” (1)\n\nRilo Kiley “Portions for Foxes”\n\nThe Ditty Bops “There’s a Girl”\n\nThe Radio “Whatever Gets You Through Today”\n\nInara George “Fools in Love”\n\nOn Volume 2\n\nThe Fray “How to Save a Life” (1)\n\nMoonbabies “War on Sound”\n\nKT Tunstall “Universe & U” [acoustic extravaganza version] (1)\n\nMetric “Monster Hospital“\n\nGomez “How We Operate” [radio edit] (1)\n\nGet Set Go “I Hate Everyone” [clean version]\n\nFoy Vance “Homebird”\n\nSnow Patrol “Chasing Cars” [acoustic version] (1)\n\nOn Volume 3\n\nPeter, Bjorn & John “Young Folks“\n\nThe Bird and the Bee “Again & Again”\n\nFeist “Sealion“\n\nBill Ricchini “A Cold Wind Will Blow Through Your Door”\n\nGrace Potter & The Nocturnals “Falling Or Flying”\n\nKoop “Come to Me”\n\nKeisha White “Don’t Mistake Me”\n\nJesus Jackson “Running On Sunshine” (1)\n\nPaolo Nutini “Million Faces”\n\nMat Kearney “Breathe In, Breathe Out”\n\nGomez “Moon and Sun”\n\nJohn Legend “Sun Comes Up”\n\nIngrid Michaelson “Keep Breathing”\n\nBrandi Carlile “The Story” (1)\n\nVolume 4\n\nLykke Li “Get Some“\n\nScars on 45 “Heart on Fire”\n\nKatie Herzig “Way to the Future”\n\nThe National “England”\n\nGraffiti6 “Stare Into the Sun”\n\nLissie “Worried About”\n\nCorreatown “Further”\n\nThe Republic Tigers “The Infidel”\n\nTim Myers “Entwined”\n\n(1) Featured in soundtrack for the season 7 episode 18 “Song Beneath the Song“\n\nREFERENCES"
