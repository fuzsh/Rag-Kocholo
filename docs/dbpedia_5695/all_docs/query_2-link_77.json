        "text": "\"I'm envious of people who just let life happen to them, because all the bad things, they can just blame on the devil and all the good things they get to thank God and they’re just a victim of their life,\" Caesar says. \"But for me, every time I do something I’m like, 'Oh s—, I made that happen and I made this thing happen.' By taking responsibility for all your own actions, you are now responsible for all the misery in your own life and all the hurt caused to other people.\"\n\nHis honey-sweet voice is still a major draw, as he glides across songs like \"Homiesexual\" and \"Superpowers\" with Olympic-level grace. Never Enough also sees Caesar progressing and experimenting sonically on the psilocybin-y \"Do You Like Me,\" with its distorted vocals and groovy guitar, as well as \"Shot My Baby,\" with its serrated riffs and bristling drums.\n\nAhead of the release of his third album, GRAMMY.com caught up with Daniel Caesar in New York to discuss how success at an early age forced him to reconsider his goals, the much darker album he scrapped before Never Enough, and his thoughts on the sentiments behind toxic R&B.\n\nA consistent theme across songs like \"Toronto 2004\" and \"Cool\" is your sense of nostalgia and yearning for when things were all ahead of you. I’m curious, are you generally a nostalgic person or is that a sensation that has come upon you in the last few years?\n\nYeah, I think it’s come upon me. For most of my life, my mother would always tell me [that] I was always in a rush to grow up, as so many of us are. I guess through COVID I got to this place where I was like, \"Oh s—, I’m old.\" Like today, at lunch, I stood up really fast at the table and I felt my knee do a thing, you know? I hate that feeling so much. That’s a very literal interpretation of it, but I’ve been feeling nostalgic, missing being younger.\n\nThis time passed during the early part of the pandemic doesn’t feel like it counts, but it does. You can’t recoup it on the backend.\n\nIt’s so insane. Just two years feels like [it was] down the drain. It was the worst time in my life, but then it did become the best time of my life.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nI wouldn’t have taken that time to stop had I not been forced to. So much of my life had become about doing what I want when I want to do it, and that was one of those times where I couldn’t do what I wanted. I’m not used to that. I’m always a get-around-the-rules kind of guy, so, I couldn’t. [I] had to face things and work through things.\n\nWhen I was in COVID just in complete isolation, I set up a studio in my guest house and I put whiteboard paint all over the walls. I think everything I made from then is still up. The apartment is still as I left it and it looks like a madhouse.\n\nYou were drawing on the walls?\n\nYeah. I wrote out a list of rules that I had to abide by, little phrases. I just went nuts and that’s how I set out. I remember when my little brother came back home, he came in there and saw what I was up to, and he said something that really [stuck with me]. I was completely isolated and I was really going through it. I was showing him the music and he was like, \"Yo, this is sick, but it doesn’t sound like you’re enjoying doing this. It all sounds like you’re sad and laboring through this.\" He was 19, 20 at the time. He’s fresh, he’s green, he’s just like, \"You don’t sound like you’ve been in here vibing.\" It was all slow driving in-the-rain music, you know?\n\nI got to the end of making the album and I was like, \"It’s not good enough yet.\" It was how I was feeling, I wasn’t feeling happy, so it was an honest representation. But I wondered, is that what I want the world to feel? Is that what I want to give the world? So, then it turned into this more ambiguous, \"I’m just going places and vibing things out and the album is creating itself.\" I made three albums in the process of making this album.\n\nWhen you say the three albums, were each of them very distinct in terms of the tone? Was there an optimistic album, this darker one, or was it all different moods interspersed?\n\nThe first was dark. The second was a refining of the first one, I guess. It was like a gradual arc, but it was dark to dark themes dressed up pretty and happy.\n\nThe Trojan horse thing.\n\nThe Trojan horse thing. Put the pill in the peanut butter. I didn’t want to be negative, but at the end of the day, I can’t deny that negativity plays a role in my life, and sometimes that’s what drives me to write a song.\n\nEspecially being in isolation, I was dealing with love where the honeymoon phase had come before COVID. I had gotten separated from my love because she lived in America and I lived in Canada, so this album is not about falling in love, it’s about the flipside of love.\n\nThe song that really stuck with me when I was listening was \"Buyer’s Remorse.\" That concept gets explored in music in the sense of \"Oh, being famous isn’t what I bargained for,\" but to hear it being very literally applied to a romantic relationship was interesting, because most people aren’t that frank about it.\n\nThat one we did in New York. Omar [Apollo] was there and Sean Leone was there. I just had the line \"I guess I got what I paid for\" and I dunno what was going on around the time, but I was going through this lust phase. Being heart-hurt, being in love — I’ve always been hyper vulnerable and growing up you realize that if you carry yourself super vulnerably with all women all the time, [you’ll get hurt].\n\nIt’s like, This way I’ve been living my life isn’t conducive, it’s not safe. So let me just separate love and lust. I’ve been in love before, but at the same time, I have this sexual attraction to all these different women, strippers and prostitutes. It’s fine, you separate the two things and then you have them mastered. I was going through this whole era of transactional sex. I don’t love this person, but we’re gonna go on a date and I don’t have a crush on you, but it’s sex devoid of love.\n\nYou have this one interaction and then you go your separate ways and you maybe never talk again or don’t see each other for months.\n\nAnd it’s not just about that, but that’s kind of where [the lyric] came from, \"I guess I got what I paid for.\" It might not be apparent all the time, but I do have a strong self belief and feel like I am in control of my reality. I make things happen. I make an action, then something happens, and I don’t always like the consequences.\n\nI’m envious of people who just let life happen to them, because all the bad things, they can just blame on the devil and all the good things they get to thank God and they’re just a victim of their life. By taking responsibility for all your own actions, you are now responsible for all the misery in your own life and all the hurt caused to other people.\n\nThere are downsides to that approach, too, because you can’t run around pretending you have no agency.\n\nIt’s tricky. Being human is tough, it's just coping. What’s the best way I can be human to cope with being a human? I wanted to change my life so badly at one point, I was like, \"Let me just take responsibility for everything.\" I don’t want to sound pious, because I feel like I can very easily skirt responsibility for things off myself.\n\nEvery time in an interview I say something and then I think of four examples of me doing the opposite, so I’m like, \"Oh, I’m a fucking phony.\" It makes it hard to speak sometimes.\n\nYour rise in music coincided with the boom in toxic R&B, which indulges in that \"I can’t help myself,\" sentiment. But I feel like when you write a song about having done something wrong, there’s a real sense of turmoil and trying to figure out how you move forward.\n\nI think why it connects is because there’s a certain level of religious guilt to everything I do and say. It’s a real self-chastisement, so it’s not for aesthetics. I admire the aesthetic of \"Ah f—, girl. I’m such a bad guy.\" It’s not like I don’t engage in that sort of [toxic] behavior, I just have a different psychology when I’m doing it. I just do it in a different way so you don’t even get the glorified sexualization of that behavior.\n\nI just feel bad about it and I don’t even weaponize it. That’s not even like, to be pious or whatever, it’s just like ick. It is what it is, but it’s interesting.\n\nDoes the songwriting process allow you to work through things emotionally?\n\nI’ll go into a song thinking something and then, a lot of times, what I’m thinking is reflected in the song. Other times, I do the song just vibing and then I’m like, \"Oh s—, I didn’t even know that I thought that.\" I found it after.\n\nI go into an album thinking I know what I’m gonna sing about or write about, and then ¾ of the way through the album, it always changes. Every time I pick a title starting an album, I know it’s gonna change, but I pick it so that I have a bearing. I can’t stick to a program, so I know it’s gonna tell me what it is. With songs, too, I learn about myself by writing.\n\nWas there another title before it was Never Enough?\n\nIt was called Pseudomutuality at one point.\n\n\"Pseudomutuality\" is really interesting because thematically, it fits with the first two albums, but I think some of the most interesting stuff on the record is about your relationship with your audience. The \"Vince Van Gogh\" song is fascinating. Why was he the figure you wanted as that tragic artist archetype?\n\nVan Gogh’s art became valuable after he died. I thought about my last album, which was about death. I think about death all the time, and it was a decision that I was going to figure out more than just making songs.\n\nThat’s another big struggle. I say all the time, there are so many things I’m really bad at, but when I need a boost of confidence, I think about the fact that I’m really good at making songs.Marketing is a part of this job that I don’t enjoy. I don’t like the fact that I have to figure out TikTok. I’m still working, I’m still figuring it out, but \"Vincent Van Gogh\" was [saying] it’s not gonna be like \"Oh that guy’s dead? He was f—ing great.\" I want to be here, I want to experience it.\n\nThere’s also a point, I can imagine, where you don’t want to feel that sense of responsibility.\n\nAll the time. I’m an artist and I’m inconsistent and I flip flop emotionally. Given the music business, [I’ve been] having this conversation the past year, like \"Yo, can you please just be consistent.\" We were just talking about this earlier, like, \"Yo, can you pick an outfit you like and wear it every day so when people think about this outfit they think about you\" And I’m like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" And then tomorrow I’m gonna wake up and put on shorts and flip-flops and socks. I’m just working through it.\n\nDo you feel like at this point, having gone through the last couple of years and making this record that you’re at a more sustainable place? It sounds like you were pretty burnt out prior.\n\nYeah, I was burnt out. It’s still tough all the time, but I’ve proven to myself that at least I’m not gonna give up. The horse is gonna have to buck me off, I don’t even know if it’s in me to bow out gracefully and get off the horse.\n\nI wonder if you had released that darker first iteration of the album and had to deal with that, maybe it’d be hard for that to get you back to the place where it motivated you to keep making music.\n\nI don’t think so. I think, regardless, I would’ve wanted to make [something] again. I don’t want to sit here and pretend like I don’t want commercial success. That’s another big part of why I’m fighting; that’s why I’m not only focusing on things I enjoy. I’ve proven to myself that I can make songs and make a comfortable living, but I want to push myself. I also want commercial validation, but if no one buys the album, I’m still gonna make another album.\n\nIt’s all about how you frame it. If you say \"I want plaques,\" that’s cynical. But if you say \"I want a large number of people to connect with this and keep playing it the way they did with [the last two],\" that’s understandable. You want to reach a wide audience and have them dig it.\n\nI got a plaque just the other day. Plaques are boring to me and award shows are boring to me. I don’t enjoy sitting through the GRAMMYs. I was looking for a feeling like, \"I respect myself and I know I did something and I can feel that the respect from my peers and the people who enjoy it is real.\"\n\nAfter getting the first GRAMMY, I was depressed. I was like I achieved that thing. I thought it would be way harder to get this. It’s like, okay you’re in the club, you’re on the world stage of making music and can make music with other really good people. You’re not an amateur.I can’t really express it through words, but there’s a certain feeling I’ll probably never get , which is why I’ll keep making albums.\n\nLarry June On His 'Great Escape': How The Posi-Rapper's New Album With Alchemist Reflects His Healthy Hustle\n\nEditor's Note: The 2022 GRAMMYs Awards show, officially known as the 64th GRAMMY Awards, has been rescheduled to Sunday, April 3, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The below article was updated on Tuesday, Jan. 18, to reflect the new show date and location.\n\nThese days, a song's visual component is practically as important as the song itself. The artists nominated for Best Music Video at the 2022 GRAMMY Awards show understand that well, and now one of them will have a GRAMMY to prove it.\n\nThis year's lineup spans pop, hip-hop, rock, and even a jazz classic: AC/DC's 'Shot In The Dark', Jon Batiste's 'Freedom', Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga's 'I Get A Kick Out Of You', Justin Bieber's 'Peaches' (featuring Daniel Caesar & Giveon), Billie Eilish's 'Happier Than Ever', Lil Nas X's 'Montero (Call Me By Your Name)' and Olivia Rodrigo's 'good 4 u.\"\n\nAs we wait for the 64th GRAMMY Awards — airing on CBS on April 3, 2022 — to find out who will take home Best Music Video (which is awarded to the artist, video director, and video producer), revisit this year's nominees below.\n\n\"SHOT IN THE DARK\" — AC/DC\n\nDavid Mallet, video director; Dione Orrom, video producer\n\nhttps://youtu.be/54LEywabkl4\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/54LEywabkl4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//54LEywabkl4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nWhen AC/DC needed a music video that matched the muscle of their 2020 comeback single, \"Shot In The Dark,\" the legendary hard rock band turned to longtime friend and collaborator David Mallet.\n\nMallet is a rock lifer, having directed music videos and concert films for rock royalty like Queen's Freddie Mercury, Def Leppard and, of course, AC/DC. His relationship with the band dates back to his music video for the reissued \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" in 1986.\n\nFor \"Shot In The Dark,\" which appears on AC/DC's 17th album (and first since 2014), Power Up, Mallet captures the band in full flight on an arresting black and red stage. Flashes of singer Brian Johnson, lead guitarist Angus Young, bassist Cliff Williams, and rhythm guitarist Stevie Young illuminated with bolts of light — \"electric sparks,\" as they might say — trade off with the epic performance.\n\nThe video is reminiscent of their performance-based \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" clip, and watched side-by-side, it's hard to believe 35 years have passed.\n\nRead More: Take A Deep Dive Into This Year's Best Pop Vocal Album Nominations | 2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show\n\n\"FREEDOM\" — Jon Batiste\n\nAlan Ferguson, video director; Alex P. Willson, video producer\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3YHVC1DcHmo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nFollowing the March 2021 release of his eighth artist album, WE ARE, singer and band leader Jon Batiste clearly sensed the world needed some cheering up.\n\nIn June, Batiste unveiled the music video for \"FREEDOM,\" a track from WE ARE, the singer's eighth album that's full of bright horns, body-moving percussion and the singer's distinctive vocal tones. The video for the uplifting song brings that vivacity to life.\n\nShot over two days in the Seventh Ward of New Orleans — Batiste's hometown — \"FREEDOM\" brings in all the joy and spirit of the neighborhood (and its marching bands) with a high-energy street party.\n\nDirector Alan Ferguson is a virtuoso behind the camera, as evidenced by his past music videos for Lizzo, Solange and Janelle Monáe. Ferguson's video for Batiste's soul-lifting anthem is all quick cuts and bursts of color. By the time the song hits the first \"let me see you wobble\" refrain, you'll want to do just that.\n\nRead More: Who Has The Most GRAMMY Nominations This Year? The 2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show Nominees By The Number\n\n\"I Get a Kick Out Of You\" — Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga\n\nJennifer Lebeau, video director; Danny Bennett, Bobby Campbell & Jennifer Lebeau, video producers\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/iTdHQ065A_o ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIt's always an occasion when mutual admirers Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga get together in the studio, and the pair's 2021 version of Cole Porter's \"I Get A Kick Out of You\" carries even more gravitas.\n\nThe song appears on Bennett and Gaga's second collaborative album (and Album Of The Year nominee), Love for Sale. Featuring 10 covers of Porter's jazz standards, the project has been billed as Bennett's final album, capping one of the great American musical careers.\n\nThe heartwarming video for \"I Get A Kick Out of You\" sees Gaga and Bennett trading off verses as they record the track at New York City's Electric Lady Studios. It's both touching and emotional, as Gaga adoringly watches Bennett croon, at one point with tears in her eyes.\n\nIndustry veteran Jennifer Lebeau caught the mood in the lighthearted visual, as it mirrors the song's laidback feel and analogue warmth — perfectly capturing the affection between the cross-generational collaborators.\n\nRead More: Meet This Year's Best New Artist Nominees | 2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show\n\n\"Peaches\" — Justin Bieber featuring Daniel Caesar & Giveon\n\nCollin Tilley, video director\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tQ0yjYUFKAE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n\"Peaches,\" featuring R&B favorites Daniel Caesar and Giveon, the fifth single from Justin Bieber's latest Album Of The Year nominee, Justice, has proven to be the LP's biggest hit. A purely feel-good jam, the song needed a music video with charm to match.\n\nBieber called on in-demand director Colin Tilley, who has since directed the singer's video for his Kid LAROI collab \"STAY\" and his emotionally raw \"Ghost\" clip. For \"Peaches,\" Tilley shot Bieber, Caesar and Giveon cruising a neon-lit cityscape in a vintage car, taking turns riding on the hood and top of the vehicle to deliver their lines.\n\nThe vid flips between two other scenes that allow the singers to dance as they serenade, the first showing the song's title in massive letters lining a mirrored runway. Finally, the trio gather inside a dome with flashing colored lights, with Bieber sporting a fittingly peach-colored suit.\n\nRead More: Meet This Year’s Song Of The Year Nominees | 2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show\n\n\"HAPPIER THAN EVER\" — Billie Eilish\n\nBillie Eilish, video director; Michelle An, Chelsea Dodson & David Moore, video producers\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GJWxDKyk3A ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nBillie Eilish's hugely anticipated second album, Happier Than Ever developed a slower, slinkier tone for her sophomore effort to delve deep into the anxieties and contradictions of life in the spotlight. Lead single \"my future\" and its follow-up \"Therefore I Am\" set that pensive mood, with the latter's music video directed by Eilish herself.\n\nEilish returned as director on the music video for title track \"Happier Than Ever,\" which arrived in conjunction with the album's release in July. It mirrors the song's slow build to a cathartic pay-off, as Eilish escapes from a flooded house and lets it all out on the rainswept roof.\n\nCompared to the intentionally lo-fi feel of the \"Therefore I Am\" visual, \"Happier Than Ever\" marked an ambitious step up, with Eilish using the shoot to confront her own fear of water.\n\nRead More: Meet This Year's Record Of The Year Nominees | 2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show\n\n\"MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)\" — Lil Nas X\n\nLil Nas X & Tanu Muino, video directors; Frank Borin, Ivanna Borin, Marco De Molina & Saul Levitz, video producers\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6swmTBVI83k ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIf Lil Nas X hadn't already made it clear that he's not afraid to push boundaries, his \"MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)\" did the trick. The controversial clip takes an untraditional approach to biblical and mythology-inspired scenes, including The Garden of Eden, a Roman colosseum, and heaven and hell.\n\nLike the song itself, the \"MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)\" video serves as a representation of Lil Nas X's unabashed openness about his sexuality (the rapper came out as gay in 2019). He kisses a snake, dresses in Marie Antoinette-esque drag, and pole dances, before the video reaches its pinnacle shock-factor moment that sees the rapper giving the devil a lap dance — sporting thigh-high heeled leather boots, no less.\n\nWhile it certainly caused a stir among conservative and religious groups upon its release, the \"MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)\" video is actually quite a thought-provoking combination of themes. Above all, it was an important bold statement for Lil Nas to make, with a Variety article even stating that the video \"has changed everything for queer music artists.\"\n\nRead More: Meet This Year's Album Of The Year Nominees | 2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show\n\n\"good 4 u\" — Olivia Rodrigo\n\nPetra Collins, video director; Christiana Divona, Marissa Ramirez & Tiffany Suh, video producers\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gNi_6U5Pm_o' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nAfter the runaway success of the heartbreak anthem \"driver's license,\" Olivia Rodrigo quickly proved she wasn't going to be a one-hit wonder with \"good 4 u\" — both thanks to its scream-along chorus and its nostalgia-inducing video.\n\nThe noughties-channelling pop-punk smash about a scorned lover demanded an acid-dipped visual, and millennial expert Petra Collins perfectly executed that need. In the clip, Rodrigo plays a revenge seeking high school cheerleader — referencing characters from feminist horror movies like Jennifer's Body and Audition — as she raises hell across an unsuspecting high school.\n\nAt the song's bridge, Rodrigo (who has done her fair share of acting, most notably in the Disney+ series High School Musical: The Musical: the Series) looks into the camera, hauntingly caressing it with her black leather gloves. Meanwhile, a messy-haired version of herself sets her ex-boyfriend's bedroom ablaze, giving a devilish grin before delivering the final \"good for you\" howl.\n\n2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show: Complete Nominations List\n\nEditor's Note: The 2022 GRAMMYs Awards show, officially known as the 64th GRAMMY Awards, has been rescheduled to Sunday, April 3, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The below article was updated on Tuesday, Jan. 18, to reflect the new show date and location.\n\nWhat were the songs that defined your 2021, a year where the world tentatively felt its way back to normalcy? Were they Olivia Rodrigo's bedroom-floor ruminations? Billie Eilish's hushed revelations? Lil Nas X's colorful odes to LGBTQ+ romance? Silk Sonic's gilded funk-soul throwbacks?\n\nWell, all those artists are up for Song Of The Year at the 2022 GRAMMYs Awards show — as are Ed Sheeran (\"Bad Habits\"), Alicia Keys feat. Brandi Carlile (\"A Beautiful Noise\"), Olivia Rodrigo (\"drivers license\"), H.E.R. (\"Fight for You\"), Billie Eilish (\"Happier Than Ever\"), Doja Cat feat. SZA (\"Kiss Me More\"), Silk Sonic (\"Leave The Door Open\"), Lil Nas X (\"MONTERO [Call Me By Your Name]\"), Justin Bieber feat. Daniel Caesar and Giveon (\"Peaches\") and Brandi Carlile (\"Right On Time\").\n\nWhile the 2022 GRAMMYs Awards show will offer all the esteemed categories viewers have come to expect, there's truly no category like Song Of The Year. It's a testament to artists who have mastered how to pack personality, punch and poetry into just a few minutes.\n\nThese are artists who best leveraged their outlets to shepherd us through uncertain times, find joy in the small things and weave the sounds, rhythms and melodies that drive our days and nights. Ahead of the ceremony on April 3, 2022, here are the nominees for Song Of The Year.\n\nNominations for the 2022 GRAMMYs Awards show are officially here! See the full list of nominations.\\\n\n\"Bad Habits\" — Ed Sheeran\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//orJSJGHjBLI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nDon't let the title of \"Bad Habits\" — or Sheeran's Dracula-fanged visage in its video — tell you otherwise. The four-time GRAMMY winner's slinky lead single from his new album, =, is a guilt-free pleasure.\n\nAnd the tune's sheer pop patina belies a surprising fact: Sheeran didn't initially hear \"Bad Habits\" as the single.\n\n\"My single was scheduled to come out in June, and I was like, 'I don't know if the world needs a depressing sad, slow acoustic song when it's all opening up,'\" he told James Corden on The Late Late Show in 2021. \"So, I was in the studio and we created this song and it's just fun, I think.\"\n\nThat's an understatement when it comes to its firepower — \"Bad Habits\" is a sly, hooky delight.\n\nRead More: Fall 2021 Album Guide: From Taylor Swift to ENHYPEN to NBA Youngboy, 10 Upcoming Releases To Listen To As The Seasons Change\n\n\"A Beautiful Noise\" — Alicia Keys feat. Brandi Carlile\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//_yU1x-p_OdY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nThere's no lever of democracy like the power to vote — so why do roughly half of those eligible in America choose not to do so?\n\nThe answer is complicated and manifold, but that didn't stop Keys and Carlile — plus a consortium of other powerful female songwriters, from Brandy Clark to Lori McKenna to Linda Perry — from doing something about it ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Together, they concocted the impactful \"A Beautiful Noise,\" a gentle-yet-firm song of urging to get regular folks to use their oft-neglected democratic powers.\n\nSure, one person's vote might be a drop in the ocean, Keys acknowledges in the song. But together, the electorate is like an unstoppable deluge.\n\n\"When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze,\" she sings. \"But when you band together, it's a choir of thunder and rain.\"\n\nTake A Look Back: For The Record: Inside Alicia Keys' Masterpiece Songs in A Minor At 20\n\n\"drivers license\" — Olivia Rodrigo\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//ZmDBbnmKpqQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nThe lovelorn ballad that leveled the internet proved to only be the beginning for Rodrigo. Her 2021 album Sour uses it as a diving-board into a multitude of styles.\n\nStill, it arguably remains her signature song. Why? Because it's possible no other songwriter has captured this very specific locus on the map of heartache.\n\n\"drivers license\" is about spending your entire relationship ideating the point where you can drive to your beau's pad — only for him to move on right at the moment of truth.\n\nThe gut punch? \"Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me,\" Rodrigo sings in the chorus. \"'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street.\"\n\n\"Fight For You\" — H.E.R.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//Nu8TS2Vr6lo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIf the global racial reckoning in 2020 was like the cauterization of a wound, H.E.R.'s \"Fight for You\" is like those first spasms of pain — good, necessary, authentic pain.\n\nFrom Gabi Wilson's first, wordless aria to the spectral chorale that carries it to the end, the song feels like a Pandora's box of psychological nightmares, finally exorcised into the ether.\n\n\"Their guns don't play fair/All we got is a prayer,\" she sings over a rhythm-and-blues backing that wouldn't sound out of place on a Marvin Gaye or Donny Hathaway record. \"It was all in their plans/Wash the blood from your hands.\"\n\nMusically, it shows Silk Sonic weren't the only vanguards for horn-fueled soul in 2021: H.E.R.'s contribution to Judas and the Black Messiah feels like a throwback in the most vivid, meaningful way.\n\nTake A Look Back: H.E.R. Wins Song Of The Year For \"I Can't Breathe\" | 2021 GRAMMY Awards Show\n\n\"Happier Than Ever\" — Billie Eilish\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//5GJWxDKyk3A' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nLet's set lyrics aside for a second and talk about pure sound: is there another pop phenom doing more with less than Eilish?\n\nThe title track to 2021's Happier Than Ever is little more than guitar, voice and some subtle, spacey ambience from her brother and co-conspirator FINNEAS.\n\nAs for the words themselves, they're economical and beautiful: \"When I'm away from you/ I'm happier than ever,\" she croons in the chorus. \"Wish I could explain it better/ I wish it wasn't true.\"\n\nBut then, the production tilts from dreamland into realism, and the words shift with the vibe: the object of her heartache is careening drunk while behind the wheel. Eilish, too, swerves from philosophical to flat-out vindictive. And as the song explodes into punishingly noisy and bitcrushed dimensions worthy of a Microphones track, it all crescendos with five words: \"Just f***ing leave me alone!\"\n\nRead More: Billie Eilish's Road To Happier Than Ever: How The Superstar Continues To Break Pop's Status Quo\n\n\"Kiss Me More\" — Doja Cat feat. SZA\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//0EVVKs6DQLo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nPut yourself in this character's shoes. A fetching spaceman — played by Grey's Anatomy actor Alex Landi — winds up in a far-flung galaxy populated by (you guessed it) Doja Cat and SZA.\n\nJust as things get steamy, it's revealed that he's unconscious in a tube of liquid, his consciousness plugged into a video-game netherworld. In other words, he's a plaything.\n\nSuch is the girl-power message of the duo's \"Kiss Me More,\" where sex and love and flirtation are on their own terms. But the sentiment wouldn't mean much without a high-thread-count pop song to match, and every second of the hooky track delivers.\n\n\"I feel like me and SZA are similar in the way that we both grew up with spiritual backgrounds, but she was perfect for this song,\" Doja — who grew up in Alice Coltrane's ashram — told Capital XTRA Breakfast at the time. \"She was in my heart when I wrote this.\"\n\nRead More: From Meme Queen To Popstar: Revisiting Doja Cat's Inevitable Breakout\n\n\"Leave the Door Open\" — Silk Sonic\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//adLGHcj_fmA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nTake it from a writer who combs through hundreds of hyperbolic pitches about the Next Big Thing per day — it's nice to finally get some truth in advertising.\n\n\"We're making music to make women feel good and make people dance, and that's it,\" Anderson .Paak, who is one half of the R&B/soul duo Silk Sonic with Bruno Mars, recently told Rolling Stone. \"It's not gonna make people sad.\"\n\nThis frank evaluation of what Silk Sonic does may not seem particularly deep at first blush, but this simplicity is a feature, not a bug.\n\nOn a musical level, Mars and .Paak are making far more than feel-good party music. Even YouTube music dissector Rick Beato was blown away by the sophisticated, jazzy chords they brought back to the airwaves decades after AOR classics like Steely Dan's Aja.\n\nSilk Sonic finally dropped their debut full-length, An Evening With Silk Sonic, after months of living with the funky, soulful, glittery highlight \"Leave the Door Open.\"\n\nEven with all these other tunes to enjoy, it remains the gravitational center of the release — and a reminder that Beato-friendly music is hurtling back into the zeitgeist.\n\nRead More: The 64th GRAMMY Awards: Everything You Need To Know About The 2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show & Nominations\n\n\"MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)\" — Lil Nas X\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//6swmTBVI83k' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nOn 2019’s smash \"Old Town Road,\" we met Lil Nas X: a TikTok star with a boy-next-door grin even as he participated in a subversive, age-old cultural fusion of Black and white culture.\n\nBut in 2021, with the hat and spurs and Billy Ray Cyrus in the rearview, we met Montero.\n\nThat's the real name of the born Montero Lamar Hill, and the name of his long-awaited debut album. And on the titular single \"MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name),\" his Blackness and gayness — and musical intrepidity — are on fearless display.\n\n\"I feel like we've come to a time in music where everything is nice and nothing is really cutting-edge or starting conversations any more,\" Lil Nas X recently told Time about its delightfully racy video. \"I want to be part of a conversation that actually applies to my situation and so many people that I know.\"\n\n\"MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)\" hasn't just started a conversation — it set the course for the rest of this American original's career.\n\nTake A Look Back: Lil Nas X, BTS & Billy Ray Cyrus Enter The \"Old Town Road\" Multiverse At The 2020 GRAMMYs\n\n\"Peaches\" — Justin Bieber feat.

The below article was updated on Tuesday, Jan. 18, to reflect the new show date and location.\n\nRight off the bat, 2021 showed promise for another year of massive hits with unforgettable hooks thanks to Olivia Rodrigo's record-breaking smash \"driver's license.\"\n\nLess than two months later, Anderson .Paak and Record Of The Year veteran Bruno Mars kicked off the Silk Sonicera with the instantly memorable jam \"Leave the Door Open.\" In the months that followed, Billie Eilish struck again with her sophomore album, Doja Cat and SZA teamed up for one hell of an earworm, and both Lil Nas X and ABBA shook the world (for very different reasons).\n\nSuffice to say, the race for Record Of The Year — which is awarded to the artist and the producer(s), recording engineer(s) and/or mixer(s) and mastering engineer(s) — is going to be a tight one at the 2022 GRAMMY Awards show.\n\nWith ABBA, Jon Batiste, Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, Brandi Carlile, Lil Nas X, Billie Eilish, Doja Cat and SZA, Olivia Rodrigo, Silk Sonic, and Justin Bieber, Daniel Caesar and Giveon delivering equally impactful tunes, it's really anyone's to win.\n\nBefore tuning into the show on April 3, 2022, get fully acquainted with this year's ROTY nominees below.\n\nNominations for the 2022 GRAMMYs Awards show are officially here! See the full list of nominations.\n\nABBA — \"I Still Have Faith in You\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pAzEY1MfXrQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nABBA sent the world into a frenzy upon their much-anticipated return in September, when they released the first two songs from Voyage, their first album in 40 years.\n\n\"I Still Have Faith In You,\" a heartfelt ode to their friendships that have endured throughout their time apart, is a song that the group wrote in 2018 along with its partner single, \"Don't Shut Me Down.\"\n\n\"New spirit has arrived/ The joy and the sorrow/ We have a story and it survived,\" the Swedish superstars sing on the chorus over a majestic rhythm, building to a series of dazzling harmonies for the song's epic finish. It's a musical odyssey that is oh-so-classic ABBA.\n\nBelieve it or not, this nomination marks ABBA's first GRAMMY nomination in their career. (\"Dancing Queen,\" however, was inducted into the Recording Academy's Grammy Hall of Fame in 2015.)\n\nConsidering that the group's Agnetha Fältskog has suggested that this album (and forthcoming tour) might be their last, there will likely be many fans glued to their TV to find out if ABBA get to call themselves GRAMMY winners.\n\nJon Batiste — \"FREEDOM\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3YHVC1DcHmo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIn an era where more and more artists are advocating acceptance, New Orleans musician Jon Batiste brought a big-band flair to an important message.\n\nBacked by jazzy instrumentation and a snappy beat, \"FREEDOM\" is an anthem for simply feeling good and feeling free. \"Free to live (How I wanna live)/ I'm gon' get (What I'm gonna get)/ 'Cause it's my freedom,\" Batiste proclaims in the chorus.\n\nThe three-time GRAMMY nominee encapsulated the culture and energy of his hometown in three uplifting minutes, his soulful and impassioned voice bringing listeners on a joyful journey of celebrating themselves.\n\nUltimately, \"FREEDOM\" is lyrically and melodically what today's sociopolitical climate needs.\n\nRead More: Jon Batiste Talks New Album We Are, His Brain-Breaking Itinerary & Achieving \"Freedom\" From Genre\n\nTony Bennett & Lady Gaga — \"I Get a Kick Out Of You\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/iTdHQ065A_o' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nWho would've ever thought that a song first sung in 1934 would be nominated for a GRAMMY — let alone the coveted Record of the Year — in 2021?\n\nLady Gaga and Tony Bennett made that possible with their take on the classic \"I Get a Kick Out of You,\" the lead single from Love for Sale, the duo's second collaborative album of jazz standards by composer Cole Porter.\n\nTheir adoring, decade-long friendship is apparent on the lively track, which builds from a mellow piano beginning into full jazz and swing orchestration by the song's end.\n\nBetween the two of them, Gaga and Bennett have 30 GRAMMYs (12 and 18, respectively). Yet, taking home Record of the Year would mark a special moment for the pair, as Gaga has never won the award and Bennett's last ROTY win was in 1963.\n\nWhat's more, Love for Sale is said to be Bennett's last album, as the 95-year-old was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2016, just before he and Gaga began recording the LP.\n\nTake A Look Back: For The Record: The Liberating Joy Of Lady Gaga's Born This Way At 10\n\nJustin Bieber Featuring Daniel Caesar & Giveon — \"Peaches\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tQ0yjYUFKAE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nJust one year after Justin Bieber released his R&B-tinged LP, Changes, he unveiled what would become his biggest R&B hit to date, \"Peaches.\"\n\nThe suave track, which features R&B stars Daniel Caesar and Giveon, incorporates swirling production and a wavy melody, creating a perfect soundtrack for a windows-down cruise.\n\nThe fifth single from Bieber's sixth studio album, Justice, \"Peaches\" has been highly praised as an album standout. The stats prove it: With nearly 1 billion streams on Spotify alone, the song gave Bieber his eighth Hot 100 No. 1 (and his only No. 1 from Justice).\n\nBut the achievement that may be Bieber's proudest is notching a No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, a feat he couldn't quite manage with last year's GRAMMY-nominated \"Yummy.\"\n\nIt also marks his first Record of the Year nomination as the lead artist (he received a nod for his role on Luis Fonsiand Daddy Yankee's \"Despacito\" in 2017), making \"Peaches\" a true career highlight for the Biebs.\n\nRead More: The 64th GRAMMY Awards: Everything You Need To Know About The 2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show & Nominations\n\nBrandi Carlile — \"Right On Time\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOpWqWK0q4U' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nAnother timely tune, Brandi Carlile's \"Right On Time\" is a commentary on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting on conflict and regret.\n\nThe piano-laced ballad put Carlile's powerful vocals at the forefront, particularly on the dynamic chorus that's reminiscent of the singer's previous ROTY nominee, 2017's \"The Joke.\" Perhaps that's because Carlile herself has said she believes in \"Right On Time\" as much as she did \"The Joke,\" something she has been waiting to feel for years.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, the singer/songwriter expounded on the song's meaning: \"There's something really human about the obstacles that we've put in front of ourselves, and then deciding to just somehow explode through it and say, maybe I didn't come out of this right, maybe I didn't handle this the right way, maybe it wasn't right, but something had to happen — so it was right on time.\"\n\nGRAMMY Flashback: Backstage At The 63rd GRAMMYs: Brandi Carlile Praises The \"Artistic Threads That Chain Us All Together\" Ahead Of Music’s Biggest Night\n\nDoja Cat feat. SZA — \"Kiss Me More\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EVVKs6DQLo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIf the hook of \"Kiss Me More\" sounds familiar, try listening to Olivia Newton-John's 1981 hit \"Physical.\"\n\nDoja Cat and SZA's bouncy collab brilliantly interpolates the single, but swelling production and a punchy beat make \"Kiss Me More\" anything but a cheap ripoff. The lead single from Doja Cat's highly acclaimed third album Planet Her, the track spotlights the star's prowess as both a singer and a rapper, bringing in SZA for a flawless match-up of female power.\n\nThe song's rolling melody made it an instant radio hit (and, in turn, inescapable), earning Doja Cat her second No. 1 at pop radio and SZA her first.\n\nIt reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it became the longest-running all-female top 10 hit in the chart's history, surpassing Brandy and Monica's GRAMMY-winning 1998 duet \"The Boy Is Mine.\"\n\nRead More: From Meme Queen To Popstar: Revisiting Doja Cat's Inevitable Breakout\n\nBillie Eilish — \"Happier Than Ever\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GJWxDKyk3A' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nAfter two back-to-back Record of the Year wins, Billie Eilish strikes again with \"Happier Than Ever.\"\n\nThe five-minute track is essentially two songs in one: The first half focuses on Eilish's softer register as she begins to tear into everything that was wrong in a past relationship (\"When I'm away from you/ I'm happier than ever,\" she declares in the chorus); the second part elevates into a gritty guitar-driven, cathartic tell-off as Eilish demands at the song's finish, \"Just f–kin leave me alone.\"\n\nEilish calls \"Happier Than Ever,\" the titular track from her sophomore album, \"probably the most therapeutic song I've ever written or recorded, like ever, ever, ever, 'cause I just screamed my lungs out,\" according to Genius.\n\nBut like much of Eilish's catalog, she presents that therapy session with a captivating melodic ride that keeps listeners hanging on with every word.\n\nIt's an amalgamation of everything Eilish has brought to the table in her whirlwind career thus far: haunting vocals, raw lyrics and a mosh-pit-worthy finale.\n\nRead More: Billie Eilish's Road To Happier Than Ever: How The Superstar Continues To Break Pop's Status Quo\n\nLil Nas X — \"MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6swmTBVI83k' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIt's hard to imagine that Lil Nas X could make a song more ubiquitous than 2019's \"Old Town Road,\" but he put a solid player in the ring with \"MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name).\"\n\nThe track became the talk of the industry upon the release of its controversial video, which featured raunchy scenes with the devil himself (yes, you read that right).\n\nBut beyond the shock factor, \"MONTERO\" played an important role in Lil Nas X's career, as it was his first official single to address his sexuality since he publicly came out as gay in 2019 (\"C7osure [You Like]\" from his debut EP, 7,touched on it, but was not released as a single).\n\nIt also ushered in a new sound for the rapper, leaning more into hip-hop and trap and eliminating any country influence he brought with his first project.\n\nThe pivot worked: \"MONTERO\" debuted atop the Hot 100, earning Lil Nas X his second No. 1. The song has more than 1 billion streams on Spotify — and though that's only half of the stream count for \"Old Town Road,\" \"MONTERO\" ultimately proved that Lil Nas was no one-hit wonder.\n\nTake A Look Back: Lil Nas X, BTS & Billy Ray Cyrus Enter The \"Old Town Road\" Multiverse At The 2020 GRAMMYs\n\n\"driver's license\" — Olivia Rodrigo\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZmDBbnmKpqQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nWhether you're 16 or 65, Olivia Rodrigo tugged at your heartstrings this year with her anthemic power ballad of teenage heartbreak, \"driver's license.\"\n\nThe piano-driven smash first gained traction when Rodrigo teased a snippet on social media last year, resulting in an almost unbelievable debut for the then 17-year-old upon its January release.\n\nThe song broke the Spotify record for the most single-day streams for a non-holiday song, subsequently debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it stayed for eight consecutive weeks — earning Rodrigo the title of the youngest artist to debut atop the chart as well as the longest-running number-one debut.\n\nStarting off with an apropos car engine start (a sound that seamlessly flows into the song's plinking piano), \"driver's license\" allows Rodrigo's tender voice to shine before she lets out howls of heartbreak on the chorus.\n\nThe narrative becomes a full-on sing-along at the song's climax, a bridge you can't help but belt out.\n\nWith so many layers and infectious hooks, the single became such a phenomenon that it even got its own sketch on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Therein, one character summed it up perfectly: \"If Olivia taught us anything, it's that pain can be creatively generative.\"\n\n\"Leave the Door Open\" — Silk Sonic\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/adLGHcj_fmA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nA week after Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak announced that they were joining forces for a superduo back in February, the pair — together, named Silk Sonic — released their first single, \"Leave the Door Open.\"\n\nAnd it did not disappoint: The sensual track calls back to the '70s funk and soul music that inspires both singers (after all, Bootsy Collins did bestow them their name), with twinkling instrumentation and a finger-snapping beat that immediately gets you tapping your toes.\n\nThe tune showcases each of their vocal specialties in masterful form, also incorporating their knack for lyrics as smooth as they are cheeky (for one, \"And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets\").\n\nWhile Mars is no stranger to No. 1s, \"Leave the Door Open\" gave Anderson his first No. 1 on the Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and Rhythmic Airplay.\n\nIf the song takes home Record of the Year, it'll be the four-time GRAMMY winner's first ROTY win, and the 11-time winning Mars' third.\n\n2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show: Complete Nominations List"
