        "text": "May 8, 2018 –\n\nThis advanced seminar will examine the technical and musical requirements of the film, television and video game industries with a focus on using Cubase / Nuendo. The discussion will cover approaches to music composition, template setup, mixing and deliveries to help the participant find adaptable solutions to their own workflow. Cubase and Nuendo are mature, complex and powerful tools that can solve all the challenges and demands placed on the modern composer. Drawing from decades of experience, the panelists will share their insights and methods.\n\nMODERATED BY KEN JACOBSEN\n\nPANELISTS: DANNY LUX, GERARD MARINO, SOPHIA MORIZET\n\nOne of the most prolific and successful multiple Emmy nominated prime time composers currently on television, Danny Lux has scored over 1800 episodes covering all categories from dramas to comedies to horror feature films.\n\nCurrent and past hit shows include Grey’s Anatomy, Boston Legal, My Name Is Earl, Ally McBeal, The Good Wife, Melrose Place, Dawson’s Creek and Suits.\n\nGerard Marino exploded onto the game music scene in 2005 as the principal composer for the original God of War series and further cemented his reputation for larger-than-life thematic orchestral writing with his contributions to League of Legends, DC Universe Online, and The Amazing Spiderman. But his musical journey started in Orlando as a “stack-of-synths” rock/pop/funk/new wave keyboard player and was tempered by 5 years of DJing through college. One month out of USC he was a go-to electronica producer for renowned film composers Christopher Lennertz, Christophe Beck, and Christopher Young which lead to collaborations with club icons Paul Oakenfold, Andy Gray, and Carmen Rizzo and on Swordfish, The Matrix Reloaded and The Agency.\n\nGerard has now fused his past with his present to synthesize future bass in GKM, his controllerist DJ project. GKM mashes up, remixes, and re-arranges beloved orchestral game themes from Western composers of the last decade with current club tracks and beats: Kratos vs. Kill The Noise, Abzu vs. Aoki, Overwatch vs. Oakenfold, and everything in between. GKM first appeared in February of 2017 with the Stetson Chamber Orchestra and had its grand debut at the Mayan Theater in downtown Los Angeles on the first night of E3 2017. It has since played the Brazilian International Game Festival in Sao Paolo, The Indiecade Awards Show in Los Angeles, and Fantoku in Orlando, Florida.\n\nSophia Morizet moved from Paris to Los Angeles in 1996 and joined Media Ventures (now Remote Control Productions), the music production company of Oscar®-winning composer Hans Zimmer. There she wrote scores for CGI projects, in addition to composing music for commercials such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Chrysler.\n\nAfter starting her own music production company, Sophia created scores for Japanese companies like Panasonic and Toshiba, for British TV channels like BBC and Channel 4, for American indie films and for French TV series like Law and Order Paris (“Paris Enquètes Criminelles”). Prior to this, Sophia’s work as a programmer appeared on numerous gold and platinum albums, feature films and TV films in Europe. In Paris, she owned and ran the multi stage recording studio “Studios Ferber “.\n\nCurrently, she scores two hour-long television series for France’s number one broadcast network, TF1.\n\nKen Jacobsen is a versatile Film, TV and Video game composer, with a degree in classical composition from Mannes conservatoire/NYU and a successful background in heavy metal, studio engineering and production. Credits include: (TV) NHL, NFL, NBC, ESPN, (Film) Mania, Helles Belles and Jacobs Honor, (Games) Spiderman and Lost Planet, (Band) Metallica, Unleashed Power and more."
