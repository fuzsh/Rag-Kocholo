        "text": "Pink has revealed that Robin Williams once performed a stand-up comedy routine for her after he sensed she was sad at an awards show.\n\nThe singer/songwriter recalled her disappointment at the 2003 Grammys when she lost the two categories she had been nominated in to Norah Jones.\n\n“I was with [now-husband] Carey, and I was holding on to his arm so f***ing tight because I wanted it so bad,” she told Billboard.\n\nShe remembered being visibly disappointed, to the extent that Williams, who was sitting in front of her, had noticed.\n\n“He launched into a 15-minute stand-up routine for me,” she said. “He made fun of everybody that walked by. He was so compassionate and lovely to me that it ended up being one of my favourite moments of my career.”\n\nShe continued, “I was so glad I f***ing lost. My Grammy would be sitting down at my guesthouse collecting dust, but I have the memory of Robin Williams being an amazing person.”\n\nPink would collect her first solo Grammy, for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, a year later.\n\nIn the same interview, Pink also suggested that she may soon retire from music.\n\n“I always said I was going to go out on top, so maybe this it,” she explained. “But then you look at Bette Midler, and you’re like, ‘She’s having so much fun, maybe I’ll never quit!’”"
