        "text": "Co-Founder Becomes Program Director of SUU Music Technology Graduate Degree\n\nPublished: June 15, 2021 | Author: Ashley H Palmer | Read Time: 3 minutes\n\nThe Department of Music at Southern Utah University is honored and excited to welcome Dan Anderegg to their faculty as the new Program Director of the Master of Music in Music Technology. Anderegg teaches music technology with a focus on project based learning. He is a composer for film and television with music airing on major network television shows such as Grey's Anatomy (ABC), Franklin and Bash (CBS), Save Me (NBC), and Vampire Diaries (CW). After studying piano at the University of Utah, he decided to transition to composition for film and TV. Anderegg completed a Master of Fine Arts degree at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. Upon graduation, he landed a prestigious internship with the Emmy's Foundation which took him to Los Angeles where he worked as a composer's assistant for Danny Lux.\n\nAnderegg said, “I see a lot of opportunity with the formation of new degrees such as the BFA in Film and the BM in Commercial Music. I'm looking forward to contributing to the formation of an on-campus model entertainment industry that will mimic what students will work in upon graduation providing the most realistic experience possible to our learners. SUU is willing to innovate in ways that other schools shy away from because of the amount of effort. That's why I love SUU.”\n\nHe helped found the Master of Music in Music Technology program at SUU with Dr. Steven Meredith and has played a leading role in the development of the curriculum as it evolves year after year. He started teaching because he loved the challenge of helping create a master’s degree in music delivered entirely online. He still sees this as an exciting challenge and is humbled by the success the program has exhibited.\n\nDr. Lawrence Johnson, Chair of the Department of Music at SUU, shared, “The SUU Master of Music in Music Technology program will continue to thrive under the leadership of its director, Dan Anderegg. Dan has already done so much for the program as faculty and interim director, including the alignment of courses in order to join with Academic Partnerships to grow the program, and the creation of a ‘carousel’ class rotation for students to matriculate in any semester and still graduate in the normal amount of time. Now that Dan is officially the full-fledged director, the MMMT program couldn't be in better hands and the music department looks forward to a prosperous future for the program.”\n\nThe College of Performing and Visual Arts at SUU is excited for Dan Anderegg to serve as the Program Director for the Master of Music in Music Technology and to continue working with and engaging the graduate students.
