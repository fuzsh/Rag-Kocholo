If you cannot find this email, please check your spam folder to make sure it isn’t there. If you have any further questions regarding installation please send us a support request via the button at the bottom right of this website.\n\nYes, provided both machines are owned and used solely by you for the production of music. The best way to install CSS on another machine is to copy the CSS folder from the first to the second computer via an external HD. Once you have done that, you will need to run through the same installation process as you would have when you originally installed it, i.e. click “add library,” and then locate the CSS folder. You will also then need to click “authorise” and enter your serial number, so your second installation will be registered in our database.\n\nSorry to hear that! But don’t worry – you can download Cinematic Studio Strings any time via Native Access. First, please make sure you download and install the latest version of Native Access, which you can find here. After installing, open Native Access and use the “Re-install” function (click here to see a brief video example of this process). However please note that CSS is the only library of ours available via Native Access, and so to re-download brass, woodwinds or any of our other libraries, you’ll still need to use our installer (please contact us for more info about that)."
