        "text": "LOS ANGELES, June 7, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- SESAC, a music rights organization, hosted its annual Film & Television Composer Awards at the Casa del Mar in Santa Monica, Calif., last night. The invitation-only event was attended by some of the industry's top executives, composers and publishers.\n\nThe awards dinner honored music composers in the categories of film, network television, local television, cable television, advertising and streaming media. In addition, SESAC announced plans for a grant program that will be unveiled later this year.\n\nAmong the honorees, Christophe Beck was honored for his film composition of Ant-Man and the Wasp. In other categories, more than 40 television composers, including Danny Lux, Gabriel Mann and Devin Powers, took home awards, recognizing the compositions to some of the industry's most highly-rated shows to include Grey's Anatomy, Modern Family, The Late Late Show with James Corden, The Inspectors, The Resident, and 48 Hours to name only a few.\n\nDuring the event, SESAC also provided an update on SESAC Scores: The Beck Diversity Project, an initiative that launched last year in partnership with composer Christophe Beck to create opportunities for underrepresented composers to advance in the field of film and TV composing. Six events were held over the course of the year in Los Angeles that supported over 350 participants, and the livestream events drew in almost five thousand viewers. These events were hosted by key industry influencers, including Beck, John Swihart, Richard Kraft, and more. Lastly, SESAC announced plans to help fund Beck's new endeavor, The Key Change Foundation, which provides grants to support films scored by emerging film composers from underrepresented groups.\n\nBelow is a full list of honorees:\n\nFILM\n\nChristophe Beck: Ant-Man and the Wasp\n\nSTREAMING MEDIA\n\nChristopher Tyng\n\nDanny Lux\n\nJohn Swihart\n\nJon Ehrlich\n\nMatt Mariano\n\nSaunder Jurriaans\n\nADVERTISING\n\nBrian Yessian\n\nMaggie McDermott\n\nMichael Yessian\n\nRory Doggett\n\nCABLE Television\n\nBen Zebelman\n\nChristophe Beck\n\nChristopher Tyng\n\nCraig Sharmat\n\nDanny Lux\n\nDennis C.
