        "text": "“Aeon is yet another fine example of the sonic brilliance we’ve come to expect from Heavyocity. The instantly usable sounds, mixed with the customizable intuitive controls make these sounds a dream to work with.”\n\n\"Call of Duty\", \"Jade Empire\", \"Mass Effect\", \"Splinter Cell\"\n\n“AEON does to melody and harmony what Evolve and DAMAGE did to percussion, loops and fx. It provides a great repertoire of sounds and sequences for scoring, using a clear and clever interface and the right tools to bring life to your track. The quality is outstanding, the choices are always edgy and perfectly contemporary. I hope it will be followed by more products like this one. The more you will use it the more you will love it…”\n\n\"Inkheart\", \"Pan's Labyrinth\", \"The Warrior's Way\", Oscar-Nominated Composer\n\n“AEON is a welcome addition to my studio’s sound library. There’s a really nice organic essence to the sounds, plus the tweakability of the interface gives even more scope to do something different.”\n\nArcade Fire, Depeche Mode, DJ Shadow, Metallica, Mixer/Engineer for Bjork, The Killers, The Prodigy, Trust\n\nAeon is so tweakable and easy to make your own. What a sound! I’ve never heard synths that sit so well in my mixes without touching a thing – full and fat without taking up too much space.\n\n\"Command and Conquer\", \"Dead Space\" Series, \"The Order: 1886\", \"Tomb Raider\", Far Cry Primal\n\nI knew in about two minutes that Aeon would be welcomed with open arms into my studio. “This thing is awesome!” was the initial reaction. The sounds are really well done, very creative and very useful.\n\n\"Battleship\", \"Desperate Housewives\", \"Gangster Squad\", \"Transformers\", \"Transformers\" (3 films)\n\nHeavyocity has done it again with Evolve Mutations. This is another no brainer library to own. The sounds are so relevant and useable right out of the box for many types of scoring projects that I work on.\n\n\"Boston Legal\", \"Grey's Anatomy\", \"My Name Is Earl\"\n\n“Mutations is a fantastic upgrade to Evolve. The sounds blend perfectly with the rest of my libraries and provide more of the same edgy kind of material I love using to spice up my tracks.”\n\n\"Need For Speed Underground 2\", \"Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter Series\", \"Tom Clancy’s H.A.W.X.\"\n\n“Heavyocity has raised the bar again. Mutations 2 is another must have for any composer’s arsenal. Not only does it sound great, but the sounds are highly useable and sit just right in a mix.”\n\n\"Iron Man 2\", \"Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor\", \"Sin City\", \"The Passion of the Christ\", Academy Award Nominated Composer\n\nEvolve Mutations 2 has the most inspiring collection of sonics under one instrument, that I’ve heard in years! When it comes to edgy glitchy, industrial beats, nothing comes close.\n\n\"District 9\", \"G.I. Joe\", \"Men Who Stare At Goats\", \"Nightmare On Elm Street\", \"Terminator Salvation\", \"The Informant\", \"The Latin Project\", Remixer/Producer/Composer (Alanis Morissette - Bebel Gilberto - Morcheeba)\n\n“Just when Evolve had become one of my ‘go to’ musical sound design instruments, Heavyocity piles on the awesomeness with Mutations 2. 2 thumbs way up and a big grin on my face. Very useful stuff!”\n\n\"The Fast & Furious 1/2\"), Audio Director - Electronic Arts (Need for Speed Series), Sound Designer (Feature Film Trailers\n\n“Evolve Mutations 2 take the core musical and sonic coolness of Evolve to a completely different level. The sounds are extreme and evocative. A really great tool for anyone in music production.”\n\n\"Bangkok Dangerous\", \"Eagle Eye\", \"Fast & Furious\", \"Law Abiding Citizen\"\n\nThe quality of the samples is superb, and the loops are flawless. On top of that this library is very easy to operate, so it just makes my life easier. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\n\"Dragon Age Origins\", \"Fallout 3\", \"Prince of Persia Series\"\n\nThis library is a beast! It opens up a whole new playground for keeping the “sound of the sound” alive and responsive—and, above all, inspiring. With Mutations 2 Heavyocity have ‘upped the game’… again.\n\n\"Project Runway\", \"The Amazing Race\", \"The Bachelor\"\n\n“Evolve captures the top qualities I look for in a library: cinematic gravitas. In a market flooded with anaemic sample libraries, Evolve steps up to the plate with killer content and a sonic aesthetic that is simply inspired.”\n\n\"The Hills Have Eyes II\", \"The Tudors\"\n\n“Your product is great, and the sounds are really super useful. As you know we’re always looking for something a little different to stay current, and Evolve definitely fits that bill.”\n\n\"CSI: Miami\", \"Star Wars - The Clone Wars\"\n\n“Every once in a while a sample library comes along that raises the bar. Evolve has done just that, it’s outstanding, and should be on the must-have list for any composer.”\n\n\"Cole\", \"Contraband\", \"District 9\", \"Normal\"\n\nMutations delivers dry, in-your-face sounds that ooze style and character. The simple but powerful interface allows radical manipulation and sonic mayhem, which is a must for those of us looking to make every sound ‘our own.’\n\n\"Dead Space\" Series, \"The Order: 1886\", \"Tomb Raider\", Far Cry Primal\n\n“The creative possibilities of this library really feels endless. You will have certain expectations with a product called DAMAGE, and Heavyocity’s new offering will shatter all of them.”\n\n\"The Forbidden Kingdom\", \"The Good Wife\", \"The Town\"\n\n“I’ve always been a beats man and this percussion hits big and hard. It’s the cinematic width and sound that makes it very different to anything else out there.”\n\nThe Prodigy\n\n“Within seconds of installing DAMAGE it became an essential part of my studio. It’s unique tempo-synced loops and dynamic multi-sampled percussive instruments immediately inspired creation. DAMAGE feels neither old or new- it feels just right, like it has always belonged in my studio toolkit.”\n\n\"The Raid\", Oblivion, Tron: Legacy\n\nI like having a huge pallet of sounds to draw from, and DAMAGE has extended mine further. There’s so many ways to mold or mangle the sounds into a shape that works.\n\nArcade Fire, Bjork, The Killers\n\n“AEON Melodic and Rhythmic are two extremely powerful instruments packed with high end sounds and I can’t wait to explore them further in the next weeks! Expect some new tunes from me with AEON sounds involved!”\n\nGreenhorn Records, Kling Klong, Systematic Recordings, Yoshitoshi\n\nThe dynamic range across all 6 gigs of content is astounding. The quality and production of Evolve from top to bottom is by far the biggest bang for your buck on the market today.\n\n\"Aliens: Colonial Marines\", \"Gears of War2\", \"Hunted: The Demon's Forge\", Batman Unlimited\n\nWithout fail, Mutations steps it up a notch. A very hard dirty industrial creepy notch! These sounds lit a massive brush fire of ideas in my head, that kept spreading and expanding. An all around a must have!\n\n\"City of Villains\", \"Gears of War\", \"Unreal Tournament 3\", ATROPA, Batman Unlimited, Higher Power\n\nDAMAGE has become an integral part of my palette and it blends seamlessly regardless of the genre of music I’m working on. I was amazed at how versatile this library truly is!\n\n\"Desperate Housewives\", \"Gears Of War 2+3\", \"The Lying Game\", \"The Sims 3\"\n\n“With the release of AEON, Heavyocity maintains their status as a leader in the sonic domain. I’m personally blown away by the depth of what this collection offers to my musical world.”\n\nVeteran Keyboardist – Dreamtheater\n\n“Both AEON Melodic and Rhythmic contain a lot of inspiring sounds and sequences. It’s a big world of sounds to discover and I definitely will use this a lot.”\n\nDJ / Producer, Label Owner of Kling Klong Records, Mastering Engineer\n\n“After using Aeon Melodic and Rhythmic for just one week I am really taken away by its proficiency. I normally swear by my hardware but have found new light and faith in this absolutely brilliant instrument.”\n\nAll Day I Dream, Bedrock Records, Circus Recordings, Get Physical, Rejected, Souvenir\n\n“The sound of the DM-307 is awesome! You don´t need to add tons of plugins to get it to sound good. The sounds are ready to use in your productions.”\n\n100% Pure, Drumcode, Owners - KD Music, Terminal M\n\n“There are so many interesting sounds in the DM-307 that I plan to use. I found there to be a lot of really nice dark percussion and cool hi hats. Very dark-techy….and also a little bit electro!”\n\nD-Floor, Desolat, Snatch! Records, Suara, VIVa Music\n\n“Really powerful as well as clean. What I also like is that it doesn’t sound “digital” like many other plugins. I was astonished by the ease of use and amount of possibilities. Haven’t seen anything like this in a while!”\n\n8bit, Cadenza, Defected Records, Owner - Clarisse Records\n\n“The DM307 is an extremely versatile groove making powerhouse. The range of this instrument amazed me. From out-of-box killer grooves to being able to meticulously craft your own by using their new GRID and LOOP MUTATOR features.

We know we’re just scratching the surface on what seems to be an infinitely limitless production tool! The sounds and flexibility are amazing!”\n\n\"Almost Human\", Platinum Selling Electronic Music Duo\n\n“DM-307 took me by surprise. I wasn’t sure what to expect but after experiencing what this library has to offer it has found a unique home in my studio. I’ve always lamented the shortage of good percussive libraries that sound great and feel great. Between DM-307, Damage, and Aeon, Heavyocity has brought composers’ libraries that elevate our work and inspire creativity.”\n\nOblivion, The Bourne Legacy, Tron: Legacy\n\n“I’m loving the DM-307, it’s got that signature Heavyocity attitude, rock solid timing and an incredible variety of ultra-tweakable sounds. The GUI is among the best I’ve ever used in a Kontakt instrument.
