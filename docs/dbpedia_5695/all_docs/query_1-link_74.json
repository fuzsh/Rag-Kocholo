        "text": "reel change: the fund for diversity in film scoring announces first recipients of the grant program\n\na SESAC, Christophe Beck & New Music USA collaboration\n\nLos Angeles, CA (May 11, 2021) – Reel Change: The Fund for Diversity in Film Scoring, powered by SESAC and Christophe Beck and administered by New Music USA, announces the first recipients of the grant program. The mission of Reel Change’s five-year grants and mentorship program is to elevate the careers and opportunities of composers of diverse backgrounds who have been marginalized in film composition. The first four grant recipients are composers Sultana Isham, Cali Wang, Emer Kinsella, and Daniel Jimenez Afanador.\n\nComposer Christophe Beck explained, “The Reel Change fund was born not only of a desire to promote opportunity for underrepresented composers, but also to enrich the art of film scoring itself by embracing a wider breadth of musical perspectives. With deep gratitude to my partners at SESAC and New Music USA, I’m proud to witness this idea finally come to fruition.”\n\nErin Collins, SESAC’s VP of Film, Television and Developing Media, says: “Christophe Beck and I knew that something needed to be done to solve the problem of underrepresented voices in the world of film scoring. When we suggested this project, SESAC’s chairman and CEO John Josephson immediately agreed and approved one million dollars towards the effort. We’re excited to hear fresh, innovative scores that more accurately represent the world we live in, and can’t wait to see these composers smash through the glass ceiling. This has been a long time coming, and SESAC is honored to be part of the journey.”\n\nVanessa Reed, President and CEO of New Music USA, says: *“In 2020, 95% of the top 250 films at the box office were scored by men; no data has been published about the representation of BIPOC composers in film scoring. Reel Change is the first fund to tackle these inequities. We’re proud that New Music USA will make this program happen, and we look forward to hearing from music creators whose voices will define the soundtracks of today and tomorrow.”\n\nComposer and Reel Change Advisory Board member Kris Bowers says: “The type of content that’s been made with people who look like me has affected the way that I see myself as a person of color. Pushing the boundaries and figuring out how we can be represented in beautiful, complex and positive ways is something I want to be part of.”\n\nReel Change grantee Sultana Isham says, \"The support I received from Reel Change was instrumental in the completion of my score for The Neutral Ground. This fund allowed me to connect and build positive relationships with an international network of orchestras, choirs, and engineers. I am extremely grateful for this deeply affirming initiative as I was allotted more space to grow as a composer.\"\n\nReel Change grantee Cali Wang says, \"I cannot thank SESAC, Christophe Beck, and New Music USA enough for supporting aspiring composers with Reel Change: The Fund for Diversity in Film Scoring program. As a working female professional, the competition in a male dominated business has always been fierce. With the fellowship, I was able to collaborate with many talents in the industry and take my career to the next level.\"\n\nReel Change grantee Emer Kinsella says, \"The opportunity to realize my music score the way I truly envision it with the support of the Reel Change Fund for Diversity in Film Scoring is an invaluable experience, which has given me the time and resources that has allowed me to make full use of the artistic process of exploration between composer and director on a very unique, visceral and impactful film.\"\n\nReel Change grantee Daniel Jimenez Afanador says, \"My career in music has been a long and challenging road, particularly as a Latino immigrant. To me, this grant signifies an effort to create a thriving and diverse music industry. Thanks to this grant, I'll be able to record all the instruments necessary to create a truly exceptional score that could be a stepping stone in my career. Not only will I benefit, but also the musicians in my community. I'm tremendously grateful!\"\n\nMiriam Wiener, General Manager of Spitfire USA says, “Spitfire Audio is honored to partner with the Reel Change Film Fund to support and encourage diversity in film scoring.”\n\n\"Reel Change is making a difference with its mentorship program for talented film composers from a wide range of different backgrounds. Steinberg appreciates the opportunity to support this fund that will contribute to improving diversity in the film scoring industry,\" comments Stefan Trowbridge, global PR manager at Steinberg.\n\n“We are thankful for the opportunity to partner with the Reel Change Fund for Diversity in Film Scoring. Success in the industry is as much about having access to the right tools and instruments as it is about being part of a supportive and thriving community. We are excited to collaborate with Reel Change and help create more opportunity for film composers from diverse backgrounds,” says Jonas Sudendorf, Director of Community & Partnerships at Native Instruments.\n\nThe five-year fund, established in 2020, accepts applications from US-based composers. It supports film projects currently in production, by providing additional funding, gear, and mentoring to assist composers at a pivotal moment in their careers. Four to six grants averaging $20,000 are allocated each year of the program. Supported expenses include composer compensation, musician fees, recording and sound mastering fees, studio expenses, orchestration, production equipment, and more. Sponsors are Spitfire Audio, Steinberg, and Native Instruments. Spitfire Audio will donate $1K in software packages to each grantee and promotional support of the Reel Change program. Steinberg will provide hardware and software packages. Native Instruments will provide the flagship music production suite Komplete Collectors Edition for each grantee.\n\nApplications are reviewed on a rolling timeline by an advisory board made up of leading composers of film music, including Christophe Beck, Jongnic “JB” Bontemps, Kris Bowers, Miriam Cutler, Chanda Dancy, Tony Morales, and Pinar Toprak. Members of this advisory board offer additional support and mentorship for interested applicants.\n\nInformation and applications are available from New Music USA here.\n\nMedia: Digital assets are available here.\n\n*Statistics and research: https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2020_Celluloid_Ceiling_Report.pdf\n\nABOUT THE SELECTED COMPOSERS AND THEIR PROJECTS\n\nSULTANA ISHAM\n\nSultana Isham is a film composer, violinist, writer and ethnomusicologist based in New Orleans, LA.
