        "text": "Raised in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, two-time Emmy nominated composer, Danny Lux was passionate about music from a young age. After high school, he opted not to attend college but rather to delve into the composing world, where he quickly began work with the legendary Mike Post. After collaborating with Post for about a decade, Lux ventured out on his own. One of his first solo credits was for the feature film \"Halloween: Resurrection.\" After this he created music for such popular shows as the family drama \"Party of Five,\" the ensemble sitcom \"NewsRadio,\" and the teen romance \"Dawson's Creek.\" He found his niche in drama, and wrote the title theme songs to a number of shows, including theme music for \"Sliders,\" \"Million Dollar Mysteries,\" and \"Crisis Center.\" The latter earned him his first Emmy nod, and he gained a second nomination for his title music work on \"Profiler\" in 1998. Lux also picked up three BMI TV Music Awards in the 1990s, two for his work on \"NYPD Blue,\" alongside Mike Post, and the third for the romantic comedy series \"Ally McBeal.\" In the 2000s, he continued to explore the lighter side of TV, crafting music for comedy series like \"My Name Is Earl\" and \"Boston Legal.\""
