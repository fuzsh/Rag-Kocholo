        "text": "Been out of work since May, (despite my book being bang up to date with a campaign that was live during the 'Paris Olympics'), so in-between my job hunting commitments that I signed up for whilst on 'Universal Credit', I made a short film, (seems it's true that the devil will find work for idle hands). It's called 'Get Milk', and is about a suicidal dad who has failed to make a film, and is left with nothing but debt, and dead-ends. The budget was ¬£162.23p, (no, it was not made with benefit money). I really must be tripping because somehow, it's just received it's second selection for a film festival! üò≥ üêÑ ü•õ üìΩ üçø There's an ocean of goodwill behind this film, with the grace and favour of many who have gone above and beyond to help me get this over the line. I owe a debt of gratitude to each and every one of you, most especially to Paula Flack. Thank You. üíñ #peckhamandnunheadfilmfestival #cannesshortfilmfestival #malibufilmfestival #getmilk #shortfilm #pnfff #scottmarshall #ann√©kulonen #kristinaerdely #andythompson #paulaflack #keithbell #mikewallington #madeleinefarley #budgetfilm #fujifilm #R√òDE #urthfilters #manfrotto #neewer #kentfilmoffice #sussexfilmoffice #mentalhealth #sertraline #talkingtherapies\n\nAustralian musician Ben Lee's music career that started aged 14 Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth) heard his band and loved the music.

Find out why he decided to go solo so soon after finding huge success with Noise Addict? What do Mike D and Money Mark have to do with Ben working with T-Bone Burnett and how did their song end up on the end credits of the film Best Men? How did Ben‚Äôs song ‚ÄúHow to Survive a Broken Heart\" become integral to a scene in the Farrelly Brothers classic film There‚Äôs Something About Mary? And how happy was Ben to discover what music sync is and the exposure it brings? Ben‚Äôs music has been in many films and TV shows including Greys Anatomy, Scrubs and Deuce Bigalow; European Gigolo.
