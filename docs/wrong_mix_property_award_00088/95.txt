Sigrid Undset, one of the authors to appear on a bank note, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928, mainly for her novel Kristin Lavransdatter. The book is a trilogy about life in Norway during the Middle Ages (its 3 books are The Wreath, The Wife and The Cross), and I’ve been re-reading it with enormous pleasure. Kristin is a heroine on the lines of Becky Sharp and Scarlett O’Hara, a feisty and wilful woman whose life is a tumultuous one.

There is an excellent new translation available by Tiina Nunnally (Penguin Classics). Do think of giving it a try. It’s not a short book, but it’s a Norwegian classic and was controversial when published in the 1920s because of its portrayal of female sexuality. It is a moving story. Undset was much praised for her historical accuracy. I look forward to visiting places connected with the novel on my Scandinavian literary tour next year.
