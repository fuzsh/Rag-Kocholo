        "text": "Ahhhh…. a good old crime novel, a thriller actually, where I don’t have to think a lot. I don’t usually try to figure out “who done it,” I just go with the flow, ideas drifting through my head. What … Continue reading →\n\nI’ve read and loved a couple of books by Joseph Conrad, The Secret Agent and Heart of Darkness – both quite good. I’ve tried to read Lord Jim prior but could never get past the second chapter for some … Continue reading →\n\nIt happened again! I started listening to this and then at some point realized it is really quite good, like meaningfully good. Furthermore, I’m wasn’t “getting it” all. So I stopped, maybe 1/3 through, and download the Kindle version. I … Continue reading →\n\nChosen by the All-nonfiction Group as the selection for March, I likely would have passed on this book because, although I’m interested in the subject, i feel kind of burned out on reading bad stuff about life in the US. … Continue reading →\n\nThis incredible classic was on sale (I still can’t believe that!) and I snatched it up because although I’d read the first volume of the trilogy, The Wreath, I wanted to reread it and continiue with the whole thing.

(I gave it a … Continue reading →\n\nI’m as much a fan of Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen – 1813) as most moderately well-read folks, probably – it’s a great book, funny and very insightful as well as being nicely-written and it’s definitely stood the test … Continue reading →\n\nOh my – I started reading Longbourn by Jo Baker – it’s a 21st century take-off of Pride and Prejudice and goes through the same events except from the point of view of the servants. I figured I could … Continue reading →\n\nTaking place in 1982, Nick Mannino is just out of law school and working in legal aid for low income clients when he gets a case where he truly believes the client is innocent of sexually molesting the young boys … Continue reading →\n\nI read this back in May, I think, and then in November or something the Booker Prize Reading Group decided to read it so I figured a reread was probably worth it. My first review is here: … Continue reading →"
