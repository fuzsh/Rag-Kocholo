She is recognized today as one of the renowned Norwegian writers of the 20th Century. Her writing \"was rich and extensive, from contemporary novels to powerful medieval novels, short stories and articles.\" She is perhaps best known for her medieval novels about Kristin Lavransdatter and Olav Audunsson, which she wrote at her home in Bjerkebaek near Lillehammer.[1]\n\nShe was born 20 May 1882 at Kalundborg, Denmark, the daughter of the archeologist Ingvald Undset and Charlotte Gyth . [2]\n\nAt the time of the 1891 census, Sigrid was living in Oslo at 89 Keysers Gade with her parents, Ingvold Martin Undset (born 1853 in Tronheim) and Anna Marie Charlotte Undset (born 1855 in Kalundborg, Denmark), and siblings, Ragnhild (1884) and Signe (1887), along with two servant girls.[3]\n\nAt the time of the 1900 census, Sigrid was living in Oslo at Pilestraedet 49a with her mother and sisters. At this time, Sigrid was working as a secretary and her sister were attending school.[4]\n\nAt the time of the 1910 census, Sigrid was living in Oslo at Eilert Sundtgate 50, along with her mother, Charlotte, and sisters, Ragnhild and Signe. Sigrid was working as a writer, Ragnhild as a teacher, and Signe as a secretary.[5]\n\nOn 29 June 1912, Sigrid married the artist Anders Castus Svarstad in Antwerp, Belgium. He and Sigrid were the parents of three children: Anders born 1913 in Rome, Italy (and later baptized at Ski near Oslo),[6], Maren Charlotte, born 1915; and Hans Benedict Hugh, born 1919. They were divorced in 1927.[7]\n\nDuring World War II, Sigrid fled the Nazis and lived in the United States, where she worked on helping to liberate her country. After the war, she came back to her home, where she again took up fiction writing.\n\nShe died 10 June 1949 in Lillehammer, Norway.[8]\n\nThere are many sources online that provide additional information about Sigrid's life and work.\n\nBjerkeboek Sigrid Undset's Home provides information about the Nobel Laureate, a short chronology, and her family.\n\nThe Lillehammer Musuem provides a brief biography, along with photos of the family.\n\nWikipedia Norway provides a more comprehensive biography of Sigrid that includes her family, her literary work, and her Nobel Prize.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Sigrid Undset at the Lillehammer Museum.\n\n↑ \"Danmark Kirkebøger, 1484-1941,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QG8Y-NWPZ : 15 March 2018), Sigrid Undset, ; Birth, Kalundborg, Vor Frue, Holbæk, Danmark, 25, Rigsarkivet, København (The Danish National Archives), Copenhagen.\n\n↑ Folketelling 1891 for 0301 Kristiania kjøpstad.\n\n↑ Folketelling 1900 for 0301 Kristiania kjøpstad.\n\n↑ Folketelling 1910 for 0301 Kristiania kjøpstad.\n\n↑ Record of the baptism of Anders Castus Svarstad baptized 24 January 1913 at Akershus, Ski, page 108.\n\n↑ Familien of Sigrid Undset.\n\n↑ \"Find A Grave Index,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVVZ-9DF6 : 13 December 2015), Sigrid Undset, 1949; Burial, Lillehammer, Lillehammer kommune, Oppland fylke, Norway, Lillehammer Kirke; citing record ID 10491878, Find a Grave, http://www.findagrave.com."
