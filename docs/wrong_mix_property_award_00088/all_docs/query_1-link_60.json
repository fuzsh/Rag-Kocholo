        "text": "Born: 20-May-1882\n\nBirthplace: Kallundborg, Denmark\n\nDied: 10-Jun-1949\n\nLocation of death: Lillehammer, Norway\n\nCause of death: Respiratory failure\n\nRemains: Buried, Lillehammer Church, Lillehammer, Norway\n\nGender: Female\n\nReligion: Roman Catholic\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Author\n\nNationality: Norway\n\nExecutive summary: Kristin Lavransdåtter\n\nSigrid Undset spent ten years as an office worker, writing in her evenings and spare time. Her first novel was rejected by publishers as un-interesting, so her next effort was somewhat racier, with the title character, Fru Marte Oulie (Mrs. Marta Oulie) admitting to adultery in the book's first sentence. It was quickly snatched by a publisher, and as prudish critics condemned it, the book became popular.\n\nHer father was an archeologist specializing in the Middle Ages, and Undset became best known for her epic historical novels. Her most famous work, the three-volume novel Kristin Lavransdatter, tells the story of a medieval Norse woman's life, beginning with her youth, continuing through her unhappy marriage to an unworthy man, to her reckoning with God and finally chronicling the protagonist's death from bubonic plague. Undset was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1928, for \"powerful descriptions of Northern life during the Middle Ages\", and Kristin Lavransdatter has never gone out of print. She donated her Nobel cash honorarium (about $42,000) to children's charities.\n\nShe was born in Denmark, but Undset's family moved to Norway when she was an infant. In 1912 she married an artist, Anders Castus Svarstad, raising his three children and birthing two more before leaving him in 1919, while pregnant with a third child. When she converted to Catholicism in 1924, the marriage was dissolved due to her husband's previous divorce, and her post-conversion novels took on more vivid religious themes of guilt and absolution. In World War II, as the Nazis invaded Norway, she fled to Sweden and eventually came to the United States before returning to Norway after the war. Her portrait appears on Norway's 500 kroner banknote.\n\nLiv Ullmann played the title role in a 1982 mini-series based on Undset's novel Jenny. Ullmann also wrote and directed a three-hour film based on Kristin Lavransdatter in 1995, which was wildly popular in Norway but poorly-received beyond the Scandinavian Peninsula.\n\nFather: Ingvald Martin Undset (archeologist, b. 1853, d. 1893)\n\nMother: Charlotte Gyth\n\nHusband: Anders Castus Svarstad (artist, m. 1912, annulled 1919, three children)\n\nHigh School: Mrs Ragna Nielsen's School, Stensgaten, Norway\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1928\n\nNorwegian Ancestry\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nFru Marte Oulie (Mrs. Marta Oulie) (1907)\n\nDen lykkelige alder (The Happy Age) (1908)\n\nGunnar's Daughter (1909)\n\nFortællingen om Viga-Ljot og Vigdis (1909)\n\nUngdom dikte (1910)\n\nJenny (1911)\n\nFattige Skjebner (1912)\n\nVaaren (1914)\n\nFortællinger om Kong Artur og Ridderne av det Runde Bord: Fortalt På Norsk (1915)\n\nSplinten av Troldspeilet (Images in a Mirror) (1917)\n\nDe kloge jomfruer (1918)\n\nEt kvindesynspunkt (1919)\n\nKransen (The Garland) (1920)\n\nKristin Lavransdatter (1922, three volumes)\n\nHusfrue (The Mistress of Husaby) (1925)\n\nKorset (The Cross) (1925)\n\nOlav Audunssøn i Hestviken (The Master of Hestviken) (1927, four volumes)\n\nKatholsk Propaganda (1927)\n\nGymnadenia (The Wild Orchid) (1929)\n\nEtaper (1929)\n\nDen Braendende Busk (The Burning Bush) (1930)\n\nIda Elisabeth (1932)\n\nEtapper (Stages on the Road) (1933, memoirs)\n\nTo Europeiske Helgener (1933)\n\nElleve aar (Eleven Years, a/k/a Return to the Future) (1934, memoirs)\n\nNorske Helgner (1934)\n\nDen Trofaste Hustru (The Faithful Wife) (1936)\n\nSelvportretter og Landskapsbilleder (1938)\n\nMadame Dorothea (1939)\n\nTilbake til Fremtiden (1945)\n\nSteen Steensen Blicher (1946)\n\nLykkelige Dager (1947)\n\nMiddelalder Romaner (1949)\n\nCaterina av Siena (1951, published posthumously)\n\nThe Unknown Sigrid Undset (2001, collected works, published posthumously)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
