        "text": "Getty ImagesCopyright: Getty Images\n\nWe're ending our live coverage soon - thank you for reading.\n\nIt has been a joint effort by Nadia Ragozhina, George Wright, Emily Atkinson and Paul Gribben.\n\nHere's a round-up of what's been happening in Stockholm today.\n\nNorwegian Jon Fosse has won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nThe Swedish Academy in Stockholm praised his innovative plays and prose and said he gave voice to the unsayable\n\nFosse said he was \"overwhelmed and somewhat frightened\" at getting the prestigious award\n\nThe 64-year-old's major works include the novels \"Boathouse\" (1989) and \"Melancholy\" I and II (1995-1996)\n\nNorwegian PM Jonas Gahr Støre said the whole country '\"is proud today\"\n\nIn 1958, Soviet writer Boris Pasternak was awarded the prize for his novel Doctor Zhivago, which had been published in Italy the previous year but not at home. His award angered the Soviet authorities so much (the state-controlled media called it an \"artistically squalid, malicious work\") that he was forced to turn it down.\n\nIn 1964, French writer Jean-Paul Sartre refused the prize. Archives opened in 2015 revealed that he had written a letter informing the Swedish Academy of his intention to decline the prize, were it to be offered to him, but the letter arrived after the jury had already made its decision.\n\nHe later said he didn’t want to accept as he had always refused all official honours in the past.\n\nWe've said earlier that Fosse writes in Nynorsk - one of Norway's two versions of the Norwegian language.\n\nThis is what it means.\n\nModern Norwegian consists of two written forms: Nynorsk, literally the new Norwegian, and Bokmål, the book language.\n\nUntil 1814, Danish was the standard written language used in Norway. After Norway declared its independence from Denmark, the name of the Danish language in Norway became a hot topic of debate throughout the 19th century.\n\nIt was during that time that Nynorsk was formulated by Ivar Aasen - a botanist and self-taught linguist, who travelled around the country to collect words and examples of grammar from different dialects in different regions. Eventually, Nynorsk was born and is now used mainly in the west of the country, and by roughly by 10% of the population.\n\nBokmål developed from Danish-Norwegian which was the elite language after the union of Denmark and Norway in the 16th and 17th centuries and is much more commonly used in Norway today. According to some estimates, it is the written standard of 85-90% of Norwegians.\n\nAnother look at previous famous winners\n\n2013 Alice Munro\n\nCanadian author Alice Munro won the award for being a “master of the contemporary short story”. The Swedish Academy said they hadn’t been able to contact her ahead of the announcement so they left a message on her answering machine, informing her of her win.\n\nOften compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town.\n\n2007 Doris Lessing\n\nBritish-Zimbabwean author Doris Lessing said winning the award had been a “bloody disaster”. The increased media interest in her had meant that writing a full novel was next to impossible, she told the BBC the year after winning.\n\nThe Swedish Academy described Lessing as an \"epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny\".\n\nShe became the oldest winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature when in 2007 she won the award for her life's work aged 88. Her best known works include The Golden Notebook and The Good Terrorist.\n\nJeff Overs / BBCCopyright: Jeff Overs / BBC\n\n1993 Toni Morrison\n\nWhen American writer Toni Morrison (above) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the academy described her as an author \"who in novels characterised by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality”. Her 1987 book Beloved told the story of a runaway female slave and was made into a film starring Oprah Winfrey in 1998.\n\nProfessor Noliwe Rooks told the BBC her debut novel, whose protagonist was a young black girl, had broken new ground when it was released in 1970.\n\n\"At this moment when [The Bluest Eye] comes out - who's writing about black girls? Who's writing about this kind of trauma? Who's writing about the interior lives of someone like that? Who's writing about black communities?\" said Rooks.\n\nHere's a look at some of the previous winners of the literature prize.\n\n2017 Kazuo Ishiguro\n\nThe Japanese-born British writer was praised by the Swedish Academy as someone \"who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world\".\n\nHis most famous novels The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go were adapted into highly acclaimed films.\n\nIn a curious twist, when contacted by the BBC for a comment, Ishiguro admitted he hadn't heard from the Nobel committee and wasn't sure whether it was a hoax - you can watch the moment the BBC called the author here.\n\nDave J Hogan/Getty ImagesCopyright: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images\n\n2016 Bob Dylan\n\nBob Dylan became the first songwriter to win the award. He received the prize \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\". Dylan at first failed to acknowledge his prize, with a member of the Swedish Academy calling him “impolite and arrogant”.\n\nThe artist took his stage name from Welsh poet Dylan Thomas and had long been tipped as a potential prize recipient. Few experts, though, expected the academy to give the award to a genre such as folk or rock music. One BBC writer said the decision false“elevates song lyrics to being on a critical par with literature, poetry and playwriting”.\n\n2015 Svetlana Alexievich\n\nAnnouncing the Belorussian writer as the winner of the award, then-Swedish Academy chair, Sara Danius, called her writing“ a monument of courage and suffering in our time”.\n\nThe best-known works of Alexievich in English translation include Voices from Chernobyl, an oral history of the 1986 nuclear catastrophe, and Zinky Boys, a collection of first-hand accounts from the Soviet-Afghan war. The title refers to the zinc coffins in which the dead came home.\n\nAgnete BrunCopyright: Agnete Brun\n\nSo, there we have it, Jon Fosse has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nHe is known, and revered, for his revelatory use of form, simple language and silence.\n\n\"What's not being said is more important than what's being said,\" he told French paper Le Monde in 2023 - inviting comparisons to playwright Henrik Ibsen, a master of the unsaid.\n\nThe AFP news agency reports that Fosse was born in 1959 on the west coast of Norway to a family which followed a strict form of Lutheranism.\n\nThe author is said to have rebelled by playing in a band and declaring himself an atheist. At 64 years old, he converted to Catholicism.\n\nHe made his literary debut in 1983 with the novel Red, Black. Other major works including Boathouse (1989), Melancholy I and II (1995-1996) and his latest book, Septology were to follow.\n\nFosse was married three times and fathered six children. He gave up alcohol after being treated in hospital for alcohol poisoning.\n\nAfter a 10-year hiatus, he returned with a new piece for the theatre entitled Sterk Vind (Strong Wind).\n\nJon Fosse began writing stories as a child, with his breakthrough novel, Boathouse, published in 1989.\n\nHaving established himself as a novelist, poet and children's author - he then turned his attention to plays.\n\nNamnet - which was first staged in 1995 - remains one of his most performed works.\n\nIt tells a claustrophobic story about a pregnant woman returning to her family home with the reluctant father-to-be in tow.\n\nHis sparse, Pinteresque style brought him to international attention, though commercial success has eluded him in the UK.\n\nFosse was nominated for the Booker Prize, won the Ibsen Prize and was awarded the French Order of Merit in 2007.\n\nHe has said he is \"overwhelmed and somewhat frightened\" at becoming a Nobel Laureate.\n\nHis latest book, \"Septology\", a semi-autobiographical magnum opus – is in seven parts spread across three volumes. It runs to 1,250 pages. Without a single full stop.\n\nMore now from Nobel committee chairman Anders Olsson on Jon Fosse, who he describes as \"a fantastic writer in many ways\".\n\n\"What is special with him is the closeness in his writing. It touches on the deepest feelings that you have - anxieties, insecurities, questions of life and death - such things that every human being actually confronts from the very beginning.\n\n\"In that sense I think he reaches very far and there is a sort of a universal impact of everything that he writes. And it doesn't matter if it is drama, poetry or prose - it has the same kind of appeal to this basic humanness.\"\n\nFor those not familiar with Fosse and don't know where to start, all his plays are \"extremely readable\", Olsson said.\n\nOf his prose, 2000 novella Morning and Evening is \"a wonderful little piece\" - and his Septology, a seven-novel sequence, is \"fantastic\".\n\nQuote Message: He touches you so deeply when you read him, and when you have read one work you have to continue from Nobel committee chairman Anders Olsson\n\nHe touches you so deeply when you read him, and when you have read one work you have to continue\n\nNobel committee chairman Anders Olsson\n\nJon Fosse is the first Norwegian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature since 1928.\n\nSigrid Undset won the award then \"principally for her powerful descriptions of Northern life during the Middle Ages\".\n\nUndset wrote novels, short stories, and essays.\n\nIn her earlier years she wrote about strong, contemporary women struggling for emancipation before later focusing on the Middle Ages.\n\nHer best known work is Kristin Lavransdatter, which deals with themes of honour, religious faith, and the common life shared by women and men in 15th-century Norway.\n\n\"With solid historical knowledge, deep psychological insight, a vivid imagination, and a vigorous language, Undset brings to life both communities and individuals,\" the Nobel Prize website says.\n\nShe later fled Nazi-occupied Norway to the US where she continued to write about her war-torn country.\n\nAlan Davey, former controller of BBC Radio 3, wrote a blog in 2020 when the station presented a new production of one his works, I Am The Wind.\n\n\"Writing in Nynorsk, a spare form of Norwegian with a relatively small number of words, his characters live in abstract, poetic worlds characterised by cold, harsh internal and external reality.\n\n\"Like the Icelandic sagas the characters speak little, and description of external surroundings is spare.\"\n\nDavey added: \"Characters begin sentences and don’t finish, dialogue ebbs and flows like inconclusive waves as fears of revealing inner feelings make characters hold back.\n\n\"It's not like the kind of narrative theatre that is popular in this country, and passions are laid bare by what is not said as much as what is said. It is poetry and abstract music rather than prose that gets the plot done.\"\n\nAnd pens down....\n\nDid you get the right answers?\n\nLet's begin.\n\n1. Who said it was a \"bloody disaster\" after being awarded the prize? Doris Lessing\n\n2. Which writer had to publicly reject the award under pressure from their government? Boris Pasternak was instructed by the Soviet government to reject the prize. He is the author of Doctor Zhivago.\n\n3. Which British prime minister won this particular prize? Winston Churchill.\n\n4. Who was the first woman to win? Selma Lagerlöf of Sweden.\n\n5. Which author only found out he had won after a phone call from the BBC? Kazuo Ishiguro - watch him tell the story of how it happened below.\n\nNo prizes for correct answers but you do get to bask in the glory of knowing your stuff.\n\nGetty ImagesCopyright: Getty Images\n\nAnother writer who could be in with a chance of winning is Canadian poet and novelist Margaret Atwood.\n\nOne of the world’s bestselling authors, she has published more than 60 books, including the dystopian classic The Handmaid’s Tale, and won the Booker Prize twice.\n\nNow 83, she is still writing, recently publishing a new collection of short stories, Old Babes In The Woods.\n\nAtwood recently said she believes the first five pages of a book are the most important.\n\n\"If you can’t get the reader past the first five pages, your beautiful theory of truth and beauty on page 76 they will never read because they won’t keep going,\" she told BBC Radio 4.\n\n\"Hook me in. Present me with a mystery. Make me want to know more. That’s a good beginning of a book.\""
