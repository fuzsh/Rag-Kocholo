        "text": "The Norwegian playwright, author and poet Jon Fosse was honoured with the Nobel Prize for literature in a ceremony in Stockholm.\n\nAnders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel Committee for Literature, said that Fosse's work is about the difficulties of finding a path in life.\n\n\"Jon Fosse is not a difficult writer. He uses the simplest of words and writes about experiences to which we can all relate: separation, death and the vulnerability of love,\" Olsson said during the award ceremony on Sunday.\n\nSwedish King Carl XVI Gustaf presented the 64-year-old with the award in Stockholm, where Nobel Prizes in scientific categories were also handed over.\n\nFosse is the first Norwegian winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature since novelist Sigrid Undset 95 years ago.\n\nFollowing his first literary work \"Red, Black\" (1983), Fosse has published several novels, volumes of poetry, essay collections and children's books.\n\nThe awards had all been announced in October. The prizes, which were initiated by the inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), are formally presented on the anniversary of his death, December 10."
