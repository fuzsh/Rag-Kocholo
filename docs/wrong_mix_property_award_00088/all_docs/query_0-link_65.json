        "text": "Tag Archives: Norwegian\n\nThe Year – Tomas Espedal (tr. James Anderson)\n\nAs I have previously mentioned, Norwegian Tomas Espedal is always going to be compared to countryman Karl Ove Knausgaard, they address the same themes, one in minute detail the other in pared down broad-brush strokes. And when Espedal mentions reading Knausgaard, or when Karl Ove becomes a “character” it is inevitable that comparisons are going to be made.\n\nIn ’Against Nature’ (also translated by James Anderson) Tomas Espedal explored love, happiness:\n\nFor a long time I dreamt of writing a series of little books. A little book about love. A little book about friendship. A little book about writing. A little book for my daughter. A little book about happiness, et cetera.\n\nThe book about happiness could never be a long one, anyway.\n\nNot a long book, nor yet a profound book, the language of happiness is straightforward and banal, there is no depth to happiness, or is there?\n\nThe book about happiness must be brief. Brief and fragmentary; it is impossible to create a continuous narrative about happiness. No chronology. No logic or sense, it’s impossible to write a novel about happiness.\n\nThe opening of the novel shifts in time and space and style, the lovers become Abélard and Héloïse from 1132, the story shifts to the first person, they become poetry, they are Ovid.\n\nImot nature (‘Against Nature’), was published in 2011, and Aret (‘The Year’) appeared five years later in 2016, a lot has changed over that time. Espedal is no longer exploring happiness, he is now looking at the loss of that love, paring back his prose even further to present a bare novel in verse. And instead of Abélard and Héloïse our author looks to Petrarch:\n\nOn Monday the sixth of April\n\nin 1327\n\nFrancesco Petrarca sees\n\nLaura\n\nfor the first time.\n\nIn what’s known as the Laura note\n\nwhich Petrarch made on a loose sheet\n\nafter Laura’s death\n\nhe wrote: That Laura\n\nso famed for her personal attributes\n\nand so long exalted in my poems\n\nI first set eyes on\n\nin my early youth\n\nit was in the year 1327 in the month of April\n\nduring matins in the church of holy Clare\n\nat Avignon.\n\nAnd in the same town\n\nin that same month of April\n\non the same sixth day\n\nat the same hour in the morning\n\nbut in the year 1348\n\nthe earth was deprived\n\nof the light of her eyes.\n\nSo Laura lived\n\nin Petrarch’s memory\n\nfrom the sixth of April\n\nto the sixth of April\n\nshe dies aged thirty-four.\n\nWhen he saw her for the first time\n\nshe was thirteen\n\nfrom that day on\n\nhe loved no one\n\nbut her.\n\nPetrarch was twenty-three\n\nand for the next thirty-one years\n\nhe would write his songs to her\n\nand after Laura’s death\n\nto her memory\n\nin the great work Canzoniere\n\nwhich has been called\n\na long and incomparable dialogue to the nature of lover.\n\nThe Canzoniere comprises 366 poems\n\none for each days of the year\n\nfrom the sixth of April to the sixth of April.\n\nEspadal is going to write a novel, every day detailing how he still loves his “Laura”, the woman who has left him, exploring for one complete year, from the sixth of April to the sixth of April, travelling in Petrarch’s shoes:\n\nwalking this Petrarch\n\nleg so that I can write a book about love.\n\nThat’s what I want to do.\n\nThis novel’s first section it titled “Spring”, and it commences on the sixth of April, blending Petrarch’s teachings with self-reflection, anecdotes of writer’s festivals, journeys with his ageing father, drinking and melancholic musings on his unrequited love. He climbs Mont Ventoux as Petrarch did:\n\nIn a letter he writes\n\nthat he’s suffering bouts of depression\n\nlooks out of his window towards Mont Ventoux\n\nand decides to climb the mountain.\n\nThe letter in which he describes the climb\n\nis a masterly piece of prose.\n\nPetrarch sums up the last ten years\n\nand thinks about what is to come\n\nhis move from Avignon\n\nhis retreat to Vaucluse\n\nthe books he’s going to write there\n\nsimultaneously he describes walking\n\nso that the ramble becomes a fusion\n\nof reflections and description of nature\n\nan essay\n\nabout climbing a mountain.\n\nAnd when he and his brother reach the summit\n\nthat windswept height\n\nMont Ventoux\n\nwhere he enjoys the view\n\nThe joy of being able to see so far\n\nPetrarch feels the need to dip into\n\nAugustine’s Confessions\n\nwhich he always carries with him.\n\nHe opens the book at random\n\nand reads to his brother: Men walk\n\nto admire the high mountains and the great rivers\n\nand the movements of the stars but forget to examine\n\nthemselves.\n\nI\n\nleave the town\n\nEspedal acknowledges that he is examining himself, “I” as a single line in the prose.\n\nThere is a reason that this is a “verse” novel, the only punctuation being full stops, you are to slow down, pause, contemplate, examine the minutiae, “Those who live busy lives don’t’ live at all”. It may also be a tool for the writer to document his drunken ramblings!\n\nWe are led to believe that Espedal is going to examine himself for a year, from the sixth of April to the sixth of April, and lead us through the seasons, starting with “Spring”, a period of love, travel and regeneration. However, the book doesn’t contain “Summer”, we move directly to “Autumn”, a time of dead leaves, refugees drowning. Espedal is in the twilight of his career, he’s fifty-three and has done all he wanted:\n\nThe Final Book\n\nThat’ll be the title.\n\nThinking about a new book\n\nalways makes me excited\n\nand especially this one\n\nwhich will be the last.\n\nI want to write a book about death\n\na good death\n\nthe sort that comes when it’s supposed to.\n\nNot the death that comes too early\n\nwhich cuts short a life\n\nnot accident not murder not terrorism\n\nnot poverty starvation suffering from disease\n\nor the long painful death\n\nRilke describes in The Notebook of Malte Laurids Brigge:\n\nEach has the death that suits him.\n\nNot a romantic death\n\nnot a beautiful death\n\nnot the mystical death\n\nnor yet the believer’s death\n\nwhich Bach sings about in his cantata\n\nCome, Thou Lovely Hour of Dying.\n\nNot death as a beginning\n\nof a new life\n\nbut death as an ultimate end\n\ndeath that naturally results from a\n\nlived life\n\nthe humdrum death\n\nthat most of us\n\ndie and will die.\n\nThis melancholy reflection taking place s Espedal contemplates the death of his lover’s love for him, the fact that she now lives, and loves, another, an ex-friend of Espedal’s, somebody he contemplates physically harming. He reads some letters, and the narrative shifts to the third person, Espedal is observing himself:\n\nSome letters he reads\n\nover and over again\n\nit’s peculiarly painful\n\nto read\n\nthe letters she wrote\n\nwhen she loved him.\n\nI have never and will never\n\nlove anyone like I love you\n\nhe reads\n\nover and over again\n\nas if the letters have the power\n\nto conjure up\n\nher love\n\nmany years after\n\nshe stopped loving him.\n\nAn examination of Espedal’s life, where his views on “climate change and catastrophe” sit alongside his “daily devastations” where the melancholic reflections are often seen through the bottom of a glass (or more to the point a number of bottles). The opening two lines of this book are:\n\nI want to write a book about the seasons\n\nspring autumn summer winter\n\nAnd he’s only managed to have two sections, spring and autumn, is this an unfinished work or does an examination of love, love lost and death suffice? As per his previous works Tomas Espedal has managed to present an awkward examination of a flawed human, his journey through his relationships, with not only his ex-lover Janne, but also his daughter, his father. Another interesting work in the sequence exploring what it is to be human, he may have said that he wanted to write a final book on “death”, but the book that came after this one is titled ‘Elsken’ (‘Love’), it appears as though he can’t let it go (this title is yet to be translated into English).\n\nThe Year by Tomas Espedal is translated by James Anderson and published by Seagull Books, my copy is a personal copy.\n\nThe Unseen – Roy Jacobsen (translated by Don Bartlett and Don Shaw) – 2017 Man Booker International Prize\n\nIsolation, seclusion, subjects that have always interested me in literature. The vast plains, deserts, remote farmlands, mountain sides, all wonderful settings for introspection and self-discovery and now we have Roy Jacobsen adding to the locations choosing a single island, Barrøy (named after the family that lives there), from an archipelago of ten thousand.\n\n“The Unseen” is a simple tale, a family story set on remote islands off the coast of Norway, and with slow contemplative language the feelings of isolation, of being cut off, slowly come to the fore. Even when discussing rubbish washed up on the shore, the introspection of a single remote family is the central subject;\n\nOn rare occasions they find a message in a bottle, a mixture of longing and personal confidences intended for others than the finders, but which, if they were to have reached the intended recipient, would have caused them to weep tears of blood and move all heaven and earth. Now, in all their indifference, the islanders open the bottles, pick out the letters and read them, if they understand the language they are written in, that is, and reflect on their contents, superficial, vague reflections – messages in bottles are mythical vehicles of yearning, hope and unfulfilled lives – and then they put the letters in a chest reserved for objects which can neither be possessed nor discarded, and boil the bottles and fill them with redcurrant juice, or else simply place them on the windowsill in the barn as a kind of proof of their own emptiness, leaving the sunbeams to shine through them and turn green before refracting downwards and settling in the dry straw littering the floor. (p19)\n\nThis novel has a deep personal connection, exploring the lives of the isolated family, their plans, dreams, battles. Three generations living in a home built, and renovated to accommodate the current size, one not sitting at the dinner table simply because there are insufficient chairs, their daily lives consist of planning to improve their island living conditions, and income so they can improve the quay, therefore connecting them, in some way, to the mainland. A work that shows a deep link to the environment;\n\nIt is a little under a kilometre from north to south, and half a kilometre from east to west, it has lots of crags and small grassy hollows and dells, deep coves cut into its coast and there are long rugged headlands and three white beaches. And even though on a normal day they can stand in the yard and keep an eye on the sheep, they are not so easy to spot when they are lying down in the long grass, the same goes for people, even and island has its secrets. (p77)\n\nAlthough the islanders accept visitors, the local priest, fishermen, family from other islands, into their idyllic world, a stranger arrives by row boat, invading their paradise. “Nothing has been taken from the island, nothing has been stolen or destroyed. Yet the stranger has robbed them of the most important thing they had, which they can never regain.” (p138) The pervading sense of their idyll being shattered, the children needing to head to the mainland to attend school, the family battling the economic downturn and having to seek employment are all subjects bubbling along the periphery.\n\nA novel that is made up of fifty-three short chapters, it is meticulous in construction, we even have a chapter on ‘silence’, the rarity and meaning of silence… “But silence on an island is nothing. No-one talks about it, no-one remembers it or gives it a name, however deep an impression it makes. It is the tiny glimpse of death they have while they are still alive.” (p103)\n\nProgress, and financial realities, come to this remote part of Norway, with the family asking if their island can be included in the “milk run” where a boat stops by to pick up milk every few days, for a family used to isolation and introspection this is a major shift in their lives, however they must attend meetings on the mainland and there they hit bureaucracy and corruption;\n\nMaria notices that no coffee is served, and that has nothing to do with the budget, and the conversation treads water for a while until it suddenly acquires a philosophical dimension, the admin officer remembers that for years Hans Barrøy has sabotaged the civilised world’s need for a seamark, a lamp or a beacon that ships can use to navigate, on Barrøy or one of its close-lying islets or skerries, after all his property lies right in the middle of the fairway, or more precisely, on its seaward side.\n\nHans askes what this has to do with his case and is told that the admin officer has had an idea, perhaps they can strike an informal deal, you see, his son works for the Lighthouse Authorities, so what about three calls a week on the milk route in exchange for them being allowed to set up a beacon on, shall we say, Skarvholmen, what does Hans Barrøy say to that, to this rock being of use for once instead of just a skerry in the sea?\n\nHe doesn’t know what to think.\n\nIt ruins his sleep. (p176)\n\nOne of my preferred titles on the 2017 Man Booker International Prize longlist with the slow contemplative language and situations presenting the isolated family in a manner that suits their situation. A work that reminds me of previous Independent Foreign Fiction Prize or Man Booker International Prize longlisted works, and divergent from a number on the 2017 list. Translated by long time Karl Ove Knausguaard collaborator Don Bartlett, along with Don Shaw, the simple poetic language is a pleasure to read.\n\nCan it win the 2017 Man Booker International Prize? I think the simple subject matter will play against it when it comes to the main gong, but personally it should be included on the shortlist. It simply depends if the current judges still have a hint of Boyd Tonkin in their reading preferences or they are diverging radically from previous incarnations of the prize, we will know more on 20 April when the shortlist is revealed.\n\nThe Wreath – Kristin Lavransdatter Trilogy Part 1 – Sigrid Undset (Translated by Tiina Nunnally)\n\nI started my Classics Club reading with a couple of books by male readers, but to ensure equal representation and to ensure there is better exposure for female writers from years gone by, my Classics Club list of fifty works includes twenty-nine books by women writers (so I’ve gone 58% representation). About time I read and reviewed one.\n\nMy Classics Club reading and reviewing commenced with the Norwegian novel “Hunger” by Knut Hamsun, and now I pick up the Norwegian female writer Sigrid Undset. Both Knut Hamsun and Sigrid Undset have won the Nobel Prize for Literature being two of only three writers from Norway to have won the prize (the other being Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in 1903). Sigrid Undset won the Prize in 1928 “principally for her powerful descriptions of Northern life during the Middle Ages.”\n\nThe first novel in her epic “Kristin Lavransdatter” trilogy (the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition running to 1,144 pages including explanatory notes) is “The Wreath”. The whole trilogy following the life of Kristin Lavransdatter, starting with her childhood in Middle Age Norway;\n\nKristin was used to playing almost every day up here on the church hill and in the cemetery; but today she was going to travel so far that the child thought the familiar sight of her home and village looked completely new and strange. The clusters of buildings at Jørundgaard, in both the inner and outer courtyards, seemed to have grown smaller and grayer down there on the lowlands. The glittering river wound its way past into the distance, and the valley spread out before her, with wide green pastures and marches at the bottom and farms with fields and meadows up along the hillsides beneath the precipitous gray mountains.\n\nFrom early on we leave of the child who is becoming world wise, she is learning that she is simply a small speck in the larger scheme of things. A classic rural opening to the novel, with the particulars of the village life being brought into perspective of the grander size of all that “spreads out”, and our heroine moving to adulthood through her experiences that are grander than the local events.\n\nEarly on in the novel the Middle Ages myth is very much to the fore, as our protagonist becomes embroiled in tales of folklore, goblins, elves, we have the Elf Maiden who approaches Kristin, beckons her with a wreath of gold…is this “The Wreath” of our title? Counterpoint to the mythology is Kristin’s father Lavrans, who is a god fearing pious man, wisdom and age lead to Christianity and faith?\n\nAs our heroine becomes older we learn of her arranged marriage to Simon;\n\nBut as time passed and her dowry chests were filled and she listened to the constant talk of her marriage and what she would take to her new home, she began to yearn for the matter to be bound with a formal betrothal and for Simon to come north. After a while she began to think about him a great deal and she looked forward to seeing him again.\n\nAs a young teenager, and arranged marriage on the horizon, Kristin is very much a product of her time, the independence and the role of a “modern” woman is literature is yet to come to the fore. Her prettier sister Ulvhild (although Kristin is “exceedingly beautiful…tall and small-waisted, with slender elegant limbs, but she…also buxom and shapely”) has an accident and becomes crippled, she recovers slightly, after the attentions of the local priest and the accused ‘witch’, Fru Aashild, now able to walk with the aid of a crutch:\n\nYet everyone said that if the accident had not befallen Ulvild, she would have been many times more beautiful than her sister. She had the prettiest and sweetest face, white and pink like roses and lilies, with white-gold, silky-soft hair that flowed and curled around her slender neck and thin shoulders. Her eyes resembled those of the Gjesling family: they were deep-set beneath straight black brows, and they were as clear as water and grayish blue, but her gaze was gentle, not sharp. The child’s voice was also so clear and lovely that it was a joy to listen to her whether she spoke or sang. She had an agile talent for book learning and for playing all types of stringed instruments and board games, but she took little interest in needlework because her back would tire quickly.\n\nWritten in the early 1920’s, the novel isn’t simply an historical account of Middle Ages Norway, it blends strong characterisation, historical accuracy with a headstrong main character, legends, religious fervour and romanticism. Of course, early on in the piece, we are yet to experience Kritsin’s independence, with the theme of a woman becoming a man’s “possession” prominent in the early stages.\n\nUnlike the introduction to the Penguin Classic’s Deluxe Edition I won’t actually give away the storyline (note – I would avoid the introduction before reading this later translation as I felt it revealed too much and impacted the novel’s revelations), but needless to say we do have arranged marriages, love, scoundrels, and family honour being brought into question. To explain Kristin’s lost virginity…” the situation is such that Simon is too good to gnaw on the bare branch from with another man has broken off the blossom.”\n\nWithin 100 odd pages, our “maiden” moves to independence, falls in love with Edwin and takes control of her own destiny:\n\nUp until the day when she gave Erlend her promise, she had always tried diligently to do everything that was right and good, but she had done everything at the bidding of other people. Now she felt that she had grown up from maiden to woman. This was not just because of the passionate, secret caresses she had received and given. She had not merely left her father’s guardianship and subjected herself to Erlend’s will. Brother Edwin had impressed on her the responsibility of answering for her own life, and for Erlend’s as well, and she was willing to bear this burden with grace and dignity. So she lived among the nuns during the Christmas season; during the beautiful services and amidst the joy and peace, she no doubt felt herself unworthy, but she consoled herself with the belief that the time would soon come when she would be able to redeem herself again.\n\nWith clever openings, the novel ensures you follow onto work number two “The Wife”;\n\nA slight fear began to stir inside her – faint and dim, but always present – that perhaps, in some way, it might be difficult for them when they were finally married, because they had been too close to each other in the beginning and then had been separated for far too long.\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, the historical references are meticulously researched with the feeling of medieval times, through ballads, fairy tales, chivalry all building to a convincing setting. The role of women as “possessions” of men is not only presented through our main character but we have the accused “witch” living in “sin”, scorned women as their partners move on layered with the behaviour and chivalric actions of male influential members of society. A multi layered presentation of Medieval times. An example of the legends still bearing true even though a nation is moving towards Christianity is the family members witnessing the betrothed going to their wedding bed, unmarried women being the only females to wear their hair loosely, and the fashions of the times intricately detailed;\n\nHe was dressed in dark attire: a silk surcoat, pale brown interwoven with a black-and-white pattern, ankle-length and slit and the sides. Around his waist he wore a gold-studded belt and on his left hip a sword with gold on the hilt and scabbard. Over his shoulders hung a heavy, dark-blue velvet cape, and on his black hair he wore a black French silk cap which was shirred like wings at the sides and ended in two long streamers, one of which was draped across his chest from his left shoulder and then thrown back over the other.\n\nThe two further novels in the trilogy “The Wife” and “The Cross” are also included in my Classics Club reading so I’ll be getting to them over the coming months/years.\n\nTo read more about the Classics Club go here, to see my list of the fifty works I will be reading and reviewing over the next five years go here."
