        "text": "I have recently been re-reading the Nobel Prize winning Norwegian epic, Kristin Lavransdatter, by Sigrid Undset.\n\nThe story takes place in medieval Norway, in a world of structure and order. Social guidelines and traditions have been embedded into the people for generations; the whole culture is founded upon a fortress of rock solid, unbreakable customs. This sense of tradition is interlaced with the vivid reality of the Christian world; angels and saints not only adorn beautiful churches, but they also make themselves felt in every home in tokens, relics, symbols, and rich stories of old.\n\nIn almost mystical prose, Sigrid Undset paints a vivid picture of snow laced mountains, green valleys, castles, knights and maidens. She makes it very clear: the characters of her story are real humans, just like us. They are body and soul, form and matter. They pray, they suffer; yet they feast, hunger, adventure, and dance. As with all humans, her characters sway back and forth between the rich spiritual world in which they believe and the tangible stuff of the earth in which they live.\n\nFor the main character Kristin, evil is both spiritual and material. It’s real. She desires freedom beyond the restraints of her family, her culture, and the narrow possibilities medieval womanhood provides her. She grows restless in farm work and being engaged to a man she does not love. When she meets the controversial excommunicate Erlend, she is surprised by the burning passion their relationship kindles. She is quick to surrender her morals for sweet, stolen nights in barns and caves. In her mind, she struggles to distinguish between her natural desire, as a woman, to be intimate with the man she loves and the lifestyle she has chosen for herself: fueled by lust and deep rebellion towards her family. It is sweet tasting sin. She laments, “All my days I have longed equally to travel the right road and to take my own errant path.”\n\nShe runs to God and the saints.\n\nShe knows that earthly life is like a raw wound. We can feel things beyond surface level emotions: we know true intimacy, deep sorrow, and profundity. She comes to know forgiveness in radical, slow and painful ways.\n\nKristin falls to her knees in confession, but it is a reality she comes back to again and again. The transformative love of Christ is ongoing: one time does not fix all for her. She has to come back time after time to be forgiven, transformed, lifted up. She chooses the good, falls back to dark sin, and stumbles back to Him again.\n\nThe passages of the book reveal one writer’s wisdom in knowing the true historical and moral imagination: Christ’s sacrifice is real. The passion is not a fairy tale for Kristin. She needs it more than the air she breathes. Ancient folklore and fairy tales pale in comparison to that ultimate event of Calvary. It is a reality made present to Kristin Lavransdatter, weeping and lonely on the frozen altars of Husaby: “Saint Olav turned her eyes toward Christ on the cross—see, Kristin: God’s love.”\n\nThe passion of God is not a stone statue in a dark church, but a man gasping for air, arms outstretched, blood running, heart burning…for her. For her failures. He redeems her love.\n\nI, like Kristin, am a real, sensual, passionate, broken, and complicated woman. I have experienced those same moments of indifference to great sin, of burning tears, of a deep yearning for holiness. Sometimes all in the same day.\n\nMy confession means surrender. As I go and kneel on hard wood in the church, I face a screen; a sort of veil which separates me from eternity and the bliss of freedom for which I long. I am not there yet. I confess, I listen. God speaks. The man on the other side may be wearing a collar, but another resides there, who listens with patience, who knows the inner mazes of my soul with joyous familiarity.\n\nOn my knees, I am forgiven again and again.\n\nMy soul touched the sky when my knees hit the ground. Burdens are cast off. Restorative grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I was blind, but now I see.\n\nOh, that undeserved, painful, mighty grace.\n\nKristin Lavransdatter continues to stay with me, even after I close her book. She has taught me: the deeper the wound, the more profound and tender the healing. She is a fictional character, but her story pierces my mind and heart in provoking ways.\n\nAnd isn’t that the beauty of great literature, after all? It is supposed to change us."
