Biography

Sigrid Undset is Notable.

"Writing was living my own life and doing my own work." --Sigrid Undset

Sigrid Undset was a writer and the winner of the 1928 Nobel Prize in Literature. She is recognized today as one of the renowned Norwegian writers of the 20th Century. Her writing "was rich and extensive, from contemporary novels to powerful medieval novels, short stories and articles." She is perhaps best known for her medieval novels about Kristin Lavransdatter and Olav Audunsson, which she wrote at her home in Bjerkebaek near Lillehammer.[1]

She was born 20 May 1882 at Kalundborg, Denmark, the daughter of the archeologist Ingvald Undset and Charlotte Gyth . [2]

At the time of the 1891 census, Sigrid was living in Oslo at 89 Keysers Gade with her parents, Ingvold Martin Undset (born 1853 in Tronheim) and Anna Marie Charlotte Undset (born 1855 in Kalundborg, Denmark), and siblings, Ragnhild (1884) and Signe (1887), along with two servant girls.[3]

At the time of the 1900 census, Sigrid was living in Oslo at Pilestraedet 49a with her mother and sisters. At this time, Sigrid was working as a secretary and her sister were attending school.[4]

At the time of the 1910 census, Sigrid was living in Oslo at Eilert Sundtgate 50, along with her mother, Charlotte, and sisters, Ragnhild and Signe. Sigrid was working as a writer, Ragnhild as a teacher, and Signe as a secretary.[5]

On 29 June 1912, Sigrid married the artist Anders Castus Svarstad in Antwerp, Belgium. He and Sigrid were the parents of three children: Anders born 1913 in Rome, Italy (and later baptized at Ski near Oslo),[6], Maren Charlotte, born 1915; and Hans Benedict Hugh, born 1919. They were divorced in 1927.[7]

During World War II, Sigrid fled the Nazis and lived in the United States, where she worked on helping to liberate her country. After the war, she came back to her home, where she again took up fiction writing.

She died 10 June 1949 in Lillehammer, Norway.[8]
