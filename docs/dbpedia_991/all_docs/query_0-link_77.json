        "text": "You use hanging indents in a bibliography, reference list, and works cited. A hanging indent is where the second and subsequent lines of a citation are indented five spaces. Learn how to create a hanging indent in Google Docs and Microsoft Word. See examples of how a hanging indent is used in MLA and APA style.\n\nWhat Is a Hanging Indent?\n\nAlso called a second line indent or reverse indent, a hanging indent is the formatting used for the second line and subsequent lines of a citation in MLA, APA, and Chicago. In terms of what hanging indents look like, it’s five spaces or 1/2 inch from the left margin. Therefore, the first line of your citation lines up with the left margin, and every other line is indented.\n\nYou can create hanging indents by doing a manual return and hitting the space bar five times for each citation. Since that can get really tedious, applications like Word or Google Docs have created a special indentation feature. You can access this feature on your computer, tablet, and even your phone. To make sure that everything is super clear for how to indent the second line, images guide you through the process in Word and Google Docs.\n\nHow to Create a Hanging Indent in Microsoft Word\n\nThe easiest way to create an inverse indent for an MLA works cited list in Microsoft Word on a PC or Mac is to open a document and type out or paste your citations from a citation generator. Then, to indent a citation, you can format each entry by following these steps.\n\nPlace your cursor at the beginning of your entry and highlight it.\n\nRight-click and choose “Paragraph.”\n\nSee the “Indents and Spacing” tab.\n\nSelect “Hanging” in the “Special” field under “Indentation.”\n\nClick, “OK.”\n\nIndent a Citation Using the Drop-Down Menu in Word\n\nIn addition to right-clicking, you can also use the menu drop-down tab to create a second line indent for your works cited. For this method, follow these steps:\n\nPlace your cursor at the beginning of your works cited entry.\n\nClick on the “Home” tab.\n\nMove to the “Paragraph” toolbar.\n\nClick on the small arrow located on the bottom right, next to the word “Paragraph.”\n\nView the “Indents and Spacing” tab.\n\nPick “Hanging” in the “Special Indent” field.\n\nClick, “OK.”\n\nHow to Make a Hanging Indent in Google Docs\n\nFor how to indent a citation and create a hanging indent in Google Docs, follow these steps:\n\nPlace the cursor at the beginning of your text, highlighting the entry or entries.\n\nGo to the “Format” drop-down menu.\n\nSelect “Align & indent.”\n\nSelect “Indentation options.”\n\nIn the “Special indent” field, select “Hanging.”\n\nThe default indentation amount setting is 0.5 inches.\n\nClick “Apply.” This is how the hanging indents in your MLA works cited list should look after applying these settings to your text.\n\nMLA Hanging Indent Examples – Works Cited\n\nOnce you know how to indent a citation, hanging indents for an MLA works cited are pretty easy to create. If your works cited entry is longer than two lines, keep using the hanging indent for additional lines. The hanging indent is used in formatting bibliographies, reference lists, and works cited pages to make each entry easier to read. Remember to double-space your citation sources as well.\n\nMLA Works Cited Examples:\n\nSteele, Thomas J., S.J., and Rowena A. Rivera.
