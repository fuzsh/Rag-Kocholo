        "text": "I savings bonds earn interest monthly. Interest is compounded semiannually, meaning that every 6 months we apply the bondâs interest rate to a new principal value. The new principal is the sum of the prior principal and the interest earned in the previous 6 months.\n\nThus, your bond's value grows both because it earns interest and because the principal value gets bigger.\n\nWe list interest rates for all I bonds ever issued in 2 ways:\n\nMatrix showing fixed rates, inflation rates, and combined rates together\n\nSee rate chart (PDF)\n\nSee Series I Bond Rate History\n\nSeparate tables for fixed rates, inflation rates, combined rates\n\nSee âI bonds interest ratesâ\n\nWith a Series I savings bond, you wait to get all the money until you cash in the bond.\n\nElectronic I bonds: We pay automatically when the bond matures (if you havenât cashed it before then).\n\nPaper I bonds: You must submit the paper bond to cash it.\n\nSee Cash in (redeem) an EE or I savings bond.\n\nYou can cash in (redeem) your I bond after 12 months.\n\nHowever, if you cash in the bond in less than 5 years, you lose the last 3 months of interest. For example, if you cash in the bond after 18 months, you get the first 15 months of interest. See Cash in (redeem) an EE or I savings bond.\n\nIf you have a Series I electronic bond, you can see what it is worth in your TreasuryDirect account.\n\nTo see what your paper Series I bond is worth, use our Savings Bond Calculator.\n\nFederal income tax: Yes\n\nState and local income tax: No\n\nFederal estate, gift, and excise taxes; state estate or inheritance taxes: Yes\n\nYou choose whether to report each year's earnings or wait to report all the earnings when you get the money for the bond.\n\nIf you use the money for qualified higher education expenses, you may not have to pay tax on the earnings.\n\nSee more in\n\nTax information for EE and I savings bonds\n\nUsing savings bonds for higher education"
