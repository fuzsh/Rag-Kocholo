        "text": "There are few things more powerful than connecting over a shared love of music. So over the past few years, Spotify has unveiled a wide range of new features, including Collaborative Playlists and Blend, that make sharing the music you love easier than ever. And fans love them: they’ve already created more than 45 million Blends. And in the past month alone, they’ve cumulatively spent over 200 million hours listening to the Collaborative Playlists they’ve created alongside those closest to them.\n\nToday we’re introducing Jam, a personalized, real-time listening session for your group to tune into together. Jam builds on some of our popular social features and combines them with our personalization technology to take real-time listening with pals to the next level. With Jam, Premium subscribers will be able to invite others to contribute through a shared queue and enjoy a musical experience made exclusively for everyone listening.\n\nHow Jam works\n\nJam is rolling out for all Spotify users globally starting today—so make sure your app is up-to-date. Premium listeners everywhere can start a Jam and anyone on Spotify can join. Simply invite your squad and Jam will help you find the perfect songs to add to the queue, finding the overlaps in your listening preferences to deliver music recommendations that everyone will love. You’ll have the ability to see who’s added which track so you know whom to thank for that crowd pleaser, whether you’re prepping food together in the kitchen or enjoying games in the backyard.\n\nOnce you start a Jam, you can invite a group of friends or family—Free or Premium users, or a mix—so they can share the experience. Premium listeners can join from wherever they are, whether they’re in the same room or across the world.\n\nTo get grooving, select a playlist or song you’re feeling excited about. You’ll see a “Start a Jam” button by clicking the speaker icon at the bottom of your screen or by hitting the three dot menu within your favorite playlist or song. You can also select a device to play on, whether that’s your phone or speaker. Those in your household on your shared Wi-Fi will also be prompted to join the Jam when they open Spotify.\n\nYou can then invite your squad in one of three ways:\n\nTurn on Bluetooth, then tap your phones together\n\nHave your friends scan the QR code on your host screen\n\nHit “share” to send the link through social, text, SMS, and more\n\nEveryone in the Jam can add songs to the queue, see who added which song, and receive recommendations, all from their own devices. The host also has the ability to determine who’s in the Jam, change the order of the tracks, or remove a song that doesn’t fit the vibe.\n\nGet ready for a deeper way to connect through the artists, songs, and albums that unite you—and to discover some unexpected gems with those around you.\n\n*Update as of March 13, 2024: Jam is now available on Desktop, making listening together easier than ever. To start a Jam from Desktop:"
