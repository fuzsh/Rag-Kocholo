        "text": "The Way Home wrapped up season 2 on Hallmark, and it's easy to say this season brought many twists no one ever saw coming.\n\nAs the TV drama centered around Kat Landry (Chyler Leigh), her mother Del (Andie MacDowell) and her daughter Alice Dhawan (Sadie Laflamme-Snow) trying to find out where Kat's missing brother Jacob went in her childhood, Kat's surprise time jump to 1814 delivered the ultimate surprise — her sibling is still alive! In fact, adult Jacob (Spencer Macpherson) had been through quite a lot, and wasn't entirely sure about going back to the future with his sister.\n\nWhat's more, Kat's childhood friend Elliot (Evan Williams) continued to harbor romantic feelings for her, and she seemingly had some as well ... despite being married to her daughter's father Brady Dhawan (Siddharth Sharma) and kissing Thomas (Kris Holden-Reid), who shot her at the beginning of the season.\n\nWith the season 2 finale prompting more questions than answers, fans are desperate to know if more stories from the Landry family are in our midst. Well, they're about to get the ultimate surprise about what's to come, because the network dropped the most epic news about a potential season 3.\n\nHere's what to know about The Way Home season 3, including cast, news, release date, episodes and more:\n\nMake sure you hit \"save\" at the top of this article to stay up-to-date on the latest news about The Way Home season 3.\n\nIs there a season 3 of The Way Home?\n\nIn a surprise announcement made by Deadline on March 20, Hallmark announced The Way Home had been renewed for season 3. According to the outlet, the drama is the \"No. 1 most-watched program overall on entertainment cable among homes, viewers and women and persons 18+,\" giving no doubt for the network to continue the series.\n\n\"Once again, our cast, writers and entire crew have used their impressive talents to create a story that is just as compelling and addictive as the first season,\" said Lisa Hamilton Daly, EVP Programming at Hallmark Media in a statement to the publication. \"We’re grateful to the fans who are so passionate about the series and can’t wait for them to see what and when is ahead for Season 3.\"\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the network dropped the news in a joint Instagram post with Chyler Leigh, Sadie Laflamme-Snow and Evan Williams ... along with a key detail about when new episodes will premiere. \"#BREAKING! The moment you’ve been waiting for is here!\" read the caption. \"#TheWayHome Season 3 is coming in 2025!\"\n\nNaturally, fans were ecstatic that more installments of The Way Home were on the way. \"YES YES YES !!! Such amazing news and SOOOOO well deserved. What a great show,\" one person exclaimed in the comments. \"👏👏👏 Thrilled to learn this! Thank you!!!! 🥰💖,\" another rejoiced. \"👏👏👏 The best series that Hallmark has ever produced!!!\" a different viewer declared.\n\nWho will be in the cast of The Way Home season 3?\n\nBased on the events of season 2, here's who fans may expect to return for The Way Home season 3:\n\nAndie MacDowell as Del Landry\n\nChyler Leigh as Kat Landry\n\nAlex Hook as Teen Kat Landry\n\nSadie Laflamme-Snow as Alice Dhawan\n\nEvan Williams as Elliot Augustine\n\nDavid Webster as Teen Elliot Augustine\n\nJefferson Brown as Colton Landry\n\nRemy Smith as Jacob Landry\n\nSiddharth Sharma as Teen Brady Dhawan\n\nAs for the status of Spencer Macpherson (adult Jacob Landry)'s future on the show, fans will need to wait and see if his character chooses to stay in the 1800s or join his family in the present. Given how the show loves to throw major curve balls, it's truly up in the air whether he'll make another appearance.\n\nDo we know what The Way Home season 3 will be about?\n\nLike most Hallmark shows, plans for the storyline of The Way Home season 3 are being kept close to the vest. But in an interview with Us Weekly about Kat and Elliot's building romantic connection, Evan commented how he thinks the two are eventually going to be endgame.\n\n\"The thing we love about the show is that audiences know that they can expect the unexpected,\" he told the outlet in March. \"We’re giving it everything we’ve got. I think we’re trying to play the love that is worth it.\"\n\nChyler noted in the same interview that while Kat and Elliot do have something brewing, the road to romance may take a little while. \"I don’t think anything’s going to happen in the way of her feelings [for Elliot]. I think it’s just a matter of timing,\" she added. \"It’s like when you do have that love of your life [come into] your life, once you feel it, you can’t not feel it. It just changes.\"\n\nWhat's more, when co-showrunner Heather Conkie spoke in an FYC panel at the ATX TV Festival on May 8 about Kat's romance options in season 3, she teased that there's a lot more to potentially explore ... including Kat potentially being single sometime down the line.\n\n\"It’s always confusing,\" she said, per Variety. \"We know that Kat can’t leave her daughter and stay in the past, because that would be the ultimate sacrifice. At the same time, it’s wonderful to keep Elliot’s love story with Kat and the Thomas slow burn. They really didn’t like each other at all and we watched it go step by step by step until they were actually kissing for the first time in episode 10.\"\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, co-showrunner Alexandra Clarke confirmed one more important element to The Way Home season 3 — another time jump.\n\n\"We definitely can confirm that we do have to do a time jump, purely because of when we shoot,\" she said, per Variety. \"We left them, obviously, in November of 2024, and we’re going to be shooting in August. So yeah, we do have to, that’s just the nature of our show. We do have to jump. But TBD on how much we do cheat things and stay and pick up right where we left off, you know very similarly to how we started Season 2 and then jumped.\"\n\nHow can I watch and stream The Way Home season 3?\n\nWhen new episodes of The Way Home season 3 air, viewers can catch them live on Hallmark every Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. But for those who'd rather wait until they can watch the show on their own time, Peacock will have the installments available to stream as well.\n\nViewers who prefer to watch The Way Home season 3 on Peacock will first need to create a profile. The streamer offers plans starting at $5.99 per month or $59.99 per year. Once you're all ready to go, click on the show's on or on the .\n\nWhile you're waiting for new episodes, why not watch (or re-watch) previous seasons of The Way Home? That way you'll be all caught up by the time the show returns next year. Happy viewing!"
