        "text": "This is a centrifugal fan. The fan blades can be straight, curved towards spinning direction or against spinning direction. This will affect the noise level and efficiency of the fan, but the direction will always be that air flows from the center outwards. The unit you have has forward curved blades, which gives larger pressure and less noise, but is less energy efficient.\n\nReversing the motor will not reverse the flow of air.\n\nThe fan must be installed so that the motor is on the intake side. If that is not suitable for your installation location, you need a different model of fan.\n\nIf the outlet of the fan is obscured or has too much backpressure, you may feel a small draft near the motor. This is due to a spinning vortex forming, but the flow will be much less than normal. To check, you can unmount the fan and run it on its own to feel which direction it blows.\n\nA forward-curved centrifugal fan should also have a scroll which is not visible in your photos. This is the spiral-shaped enclosure with an outlet at the widest point. Without the scroll, the fan will not work correctly.\n\nIf the fan does not have a scroll (and assuming it's not just a missing part), then it is indeed supposed to be a backward-curved fan and Transistor's instructions on reversing the motor should help. Backward curved fans can operate without a scroll, but forward curved fans cannot.\n\nYou can also compare the orientation of the exhaust port to the images on Wikipedia - the exhaust port should be oriented so that the rotation \"throws\" the air towards the outlet.\n\nIf the red arrow in your second photo is correct, it is spinning the wrong way and if it's brand new, send it back! The information about reversing the motor is interesting but just get one that works.\n\nWhile you're waiting for the replacement you should verify the duct isn't blocked, because that would cause turbulence and backdraft. But if the fan is turning the wrong way that should be the first thing you attend to.\n\nIf the first picture (installed) is of the bathroom ceiling, it is installed the right way. As you wrote, you can't install it the wrong way (the duct would be in the bathroom). There is no A/C polarity, as you know although the wire-reversing sanity check is something we all might have done because nothing in the real world behaves like in a high school physics class. Taking it apart and observing the blade direction was the golden test."
