        "text": "When should I file a claim?\n\nFile your claim during your first week of total or partial unemployment. If you wait, you may lose benefits. You may not file for a week when you work more than 30 hours or earn more than $504 gross pay between Monday and Sunday. You must wait until the next Monday to file, if you are still unemployed.\n\nTo request credit for a period for which you did not file a valid claim, write to:\n\nNew York State Department of Labor\n\nCentral Support Unit\n\nP.O. Box 15130\n\nAlbany, New York 12212\n\nYour letter should include your:\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nPhone number\n\nSocial Security number\n\nDates for which you request credit\n\nReason why you did not file a claim at that time\n\nWe will investigate and decide if you qualify for benefits.\n\nWhat is the Monetary Determination?\n\nAfter you file your claim, we will send you a Monetary Determination. This letter shows your base period and the employers and wages used to determine if you have enough earnings to establish a claim. Review this form for accuracy. Be sure you agree with the amount of earnings reported. Check the list for all your employers. Do not return this form. Keep it for your personal records. NOTE: The Wage Reporting System does not show wages earned:\n\nWith the federal government\n\nIn a branch of military service or\n\nFor work done outside of New York State\n\nThus, the initial Monetary Determination may not list them. If we fail to list an employer, job or earnings, fill out a Request for Reconsideration (found in the claimant handbook). We will use those wages to calculate your correct benefit rate.\n\nWhat is a Request for Reconsideration?When you receive your determination letter in the mail, it will show your weekly benefit rate for Unemployment Insurance (UI). If the wages shown on the form are wrong or employment or earnings are missing, then you can make a request to have your Monetary Determination reconsidered. This is called a Request for Reconsideration.Where can I get a Request for Reconsideration form?The Request for Reconsideration form can be found on our website here (or by visiting on.ny.gov/reconsideration) and in the Claimant Handbook. In addition to mailing or faxing the form, you can submit a Request for Reconsideration through DOL’s secure online messaging system. If you submit your request through your online account, first select “Submit Documents” and then “Submit Wage Documents.” Please use the subject line “Wage Documentation”.The Request for Reconsideration form says that I can submit it by mail or fax. Is there a way to submit the Request for Reconsideration form and my wage documentation online?Yes. You can submit a Request for Reconsideration through DOL’s secure messaging system in your online account at labor.ny.gov/signin. If you submit your Request for Reconsideration through your online account, first select “Submit Documents” and then “Submit Wage Documents.” Please use the subject line “Wage Documentation”.If I sent my 1099 to DOL, will DOL review it and adjust my rate even if I did not send a Request for Reconsideration form?Yes. DOL will review all wage documents, including 1099s, and make proper adjustments on a case-by-case basis. Sending a Request for Reconsideration form, however, will help your case get routed to the correct DOL representatives.What if I do not have a 1099 from the business that paid me? Can I send in paystubs?Yes. DOL will review all wage documents, including paystubs. Please note that complex or voluminous records will take longer for a DOL representative to review.If I make a Request for Reconsideration, could my benefit rate go down?Your rate will depend on the details of your income. If you were overpaid benefits, the DOL will notify you.Can I estimate my weekly Unemployment Insurance benefit amount?Yes, you can use the benefit rate calculator on our website. Please note that the tool gives an estimate only. It does not guarantee that you will be eligible for benefits or a specific amount of benefits. You must file an Unemployment Insurance claim to find our if you are eligible and learn your actual benefit amount.What if I don’t agree with the Monetary Determination?If you qualify, the Monetary Determination will show your weekly benefit rate. You use the Request for Reconsideration form only if:\n\nThe wages shown on the form are wrong or\n\nYour employment and earnings are missing from the base period\n\nBe sure to include proof of your employment and wages, such as a copy of pay stubs that total the amount of earnings you list on the form for the time in question.\n\nIf you have no pay stubs:\n\nSend any documents you may have that we can use as proof\n\nOR\n\nExplain why you have no proof of earnings (for instance, you were paid in cash or \"off the books\").\n\nIf the information shown on the Monetary Determination is correct, you do not need to take any action.\n\nIf you do not qualify, the Monetary Determination will explain why. Check that the Monetary Determination form is correct. Fill out the Request for Reconsideration if:The wages shown on the form are wrong or\n\nYour employment and earnings are missing\n\nSend correct wage information for all four Basic Base Period Quarters and the Alternate Quarter. To speed up the review of your claim, be sure to include proof of your employment and wages, such as pay stubs that total the amount of earnings you list on the form for the time in question.\n\nIf you have no pay stubs:\n\nSend any documents you may have that we can use as proof\n\nOR\n\nExplain why you have no proof of earnings.\n\nYou may read and print the UI Claimant Handbook.\n\nWe will review your Monetary Determination based on the proof you submit. We may contact your base period employer(s) to verify the wages paid to you in that time. If your benefit rate changes, we will mail you a revised Monetary Determination.\n\nWe process your request and set a hearing date if:The review does not change your benefit rate and\n\nYour rate is less than the maximum rate of $504\n\nIt is important to keep pay stubs and other proof of wages from your base period. This helps you provide an accurate estimate. Wages include the dollar value of:Tips\n\nBonuses\n\nMeals and lodging\n\nCommissions\n\nVacation and holiday payWhat if I think my rate will be higher using the alternate base period?\n\nYou should complete the Request for Alternate Base Period form only\n\nIF\n\nYou already have a benefit rate using the Basic Base Period\n\nBUT\n\nYour \"high quarter\" wages are in the Alternate Base Period quarter\n\nAND\n\nYou wish to request a rate based on the Alternate Base Period wages\n\n(See your Monetary Determination for specific dates and wages.)\n\nThere is a deadline for us to consider you for the Alternate Base Period. Fill out the Request for Alternate Base Period form. The Department of Labor must receive your completed form within 10 days from the \"Date Mailed\" on the Monetary Determination.\n\nOnce wages are \"used,\" they cannot be included in a future claim. If you choose to use the Alternate Base Period wages, you will not be able to use this employment and wages again. This may affect your entitlement to a later claim.\n\nI received a notice that my weekly benefit rate was increased. What happens now?\n\nYou should begin receiving a higher weekly benefit when you certify for weeks of unemployment. Additionally, you may be entitled to receive back payments for weeks you were previously paid at the lower weekly benefit rate. If you have not received your back payments within three weeks of receiving a notice from the DOL that your weekly benefit rate was increased, you can let us know by sending a message through the secure messaging system in your online account or by calling us at 888-209-8124.\n\nTo contact us about your increased benefit rate through our online system, log in to labor.ny.gov/signin with your NY.gov username and password. Select “Go to My Inbox” and then “Compose New.” Select “Payments Due After Benefit Rate Increase” for the subject line, compose your message with the dates you would like investigated, and then click “Send.\"\n\nI received an increase in my weekly benefit rate after receiving benefits but have not received back payments for the weeks that I was previously paid at the lower weekly benefit rate. What should I do?\n\nIf you have not received your back payments within three weeks of receiving a notice from the DOL that your weekly benefit rate was increased, you can let us know by sending a message through the secure messaging system in your online account or by calling us at 888-209-6851.\n\nTo contact us about your increased benefit rate through our online system, log in to labor.ny.gov/signin with your NY.gov username and password. Select “Go to My Inbox” and then “Compose New.” Select “Payments Due After Benefit Rate Increase” for the subject line, compose your message with the dates you would like investigated, and then click “Send.”\n\nI can’t get through when I try calling the DOL about my back payments. What should I do?\n\nPlease wait at least three weeks before reaching out because your payment may still be in process. If you do not receive your payment, you can let us know by sending a message through the secure messaging system in your online account or by calling us at 888-209-8124.\n\nTo contact us about your increased benefit rate through our online system, log in to labor.ny.gov/signin with your NY.gov username and password. Select “Go to My Inbox” and then “Compose New.” Select “Payments Due After Benefit Rate Increase” for the subject line, compose your message with the dates you would like investigated, and then click “Send.”\n\nCan I have my benefit rate calculated using my average weekly wage?Yes, if you think your benefit rate may be higher using your average weekly wage.\n\nComplete the Request for Rate Based on Weeks form included in the back of your Claimant Handbook. If you are a seasonal worker or other worker who did not work all weeks in your high quarter, this request may give you an increased benefit rate.\n\nFirst, finalize the base period and the high quarter wages to establish your rate. Then, we can reconsider your benefit rate.\n\nTo qualify for this recalculation, you must have:\n\nAt least 20 weeks of work in your base period\n\nAND\n\nAny benefit rate increase must be at least $5 more than your current benefit rate\n\nBUT\n\nCannot exceed the maximum benefit rate (currently $504)\n\nYou must offer proof, such as paycheck stubs, for each week of work. For unemployment purposes, a \"week of employment\" is a Monday through Sunday period. If you choose to have your rate based on weeks of employment, we will calculate your benefit rate as one-half your average weekly wage. See instructions for completing the Request for Rate Based on Weeks form in the Claimant Handbook.\n\nYou must submit the form and your proof of weeks of work within 10 days of the date of your most recent Monetary Determination. We will review the form and the proof. If your Monetary Determination changes, we will mail you a revised determination.I filed a claim, what next?\n\nFor each week you wish to receive benefits, you must request payment by claiming benefits for that week.\n\nBefore we can pay any benefits, you must serve an unpaid waiting period. This equals one full week of unemployment benefits. You must claim credit for your waiting week during the period that:\n\nBegins on the first Sunday after you file your claim and\n\nEnds the next Saturday\n\nThe waiting period extends into the next week if you:\n\nWork at all during the week in which you filed your claim or\n\nDo not serve a full waiting period for other reasons\n\nEach week that you are unemployed, you must certify that you are eligible for payment if you want to receive unemployment benefits. Be very careful in reading questions and in answering truthfully. You certify that weekly claim on Sunday, for the week ending that day.\n\nHow do I claim my weekly benefits?\n\nSee the Guide for Claiming Weekly Unemployment Insurance Benefits Fact Sheet\n\nWARNING: Use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or internet anonymizer service may cause problems with your ability to apply or certify for benefits. Turn these services off before accessing online services.\n\nYou may claim your weekly unemployment benefits:\n\nOn the web with your NY.gov ID\n\nCall Tel-Service at 888-581-5812, using a touch-tone phone.\n\nBoth systems are available in English and Spanish. The Tel-Service system is also available in other languages, including Haitian-Creole, Russian, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Polish, Bengali, Arabic, French, Italian, Hindi, Vietnamese, Urdu, Nepali and Tagalog.\n\nIf you use TTY/TDD equipment, call a relay operator first at 800-662-1220, and ask the operator to call the Telephone Claims Center at 888-783-1370.\n\nIf you are claiming weekly benefits online, you may do so:\n\nBeginning Sunday - all day\n\nMonday through Friday - 7:30 a.m. to midnight\n\nSaturday - all day\n\nAn unemployment week runs Monday through Sunday. If you wish to claim benefits for a week of unemployment, you have from the Sunday date at the end of that week through the next Saturday to do so.\n\nThe first week of your claim is a waiting period and is not paid. Remember, you must claim benefits for each week and get credit.\n\nWhen you claim weekly benefits, you must answer questions to certify how many hours you were ready, willing and able to work during the past week. The certification system only handles certification for one week at a time.\n\nYou cannot claim for a given week more than a week later either online or using Tel-Service. The system will not accept certifications for any back weeks or other periods of time. If you miss claiming benefits for a week during which you were unemployed, you can request credit for this week by secure message, fax or regular mail. Do not call the Telephone Claims Center to request back credit for a week.\n\nTo submit a request by secure message, sign in to your account at https://apps.labor.ny.gov/IndividualReg/ and click on the envelope icon on the My online Services page. To fax your request, send to (518) 457-9378.\n\nBy mail, send to:\n\nNew York State Department of Labor\n\nPO Box 15130\n\nAlbany, NY 12212-5130\n\nBe sure to include the beginning and ending dates of the time period for which you did not claim benefits and the reason you did not claim benefits promptly in your request. Also, include the last four digits of your Social Security number on the upper right corner.\n\nWe will review your request and decide if you are eligible to receive benefits for that time period. This review can take two to three weeks, unless we need more information. In that case, it may take longer. During this time, be sure to continue claiming benefits for all weeks you are unemployed and eligible for benefits. If we write or call you to request more information, please respond promptly so the review is not delayed.\n\nWhen you use the phone or online systems to claim your weekly benefits, you must certify for yourself. Having someone else claim your weekly benefits for you is a serious offense. It can lead to severe penalties, including criminal prosecution and jail time.\n\nWhat should I do if I make a mistake on my weekly certification?You should call the Telephone Claims Center right away, at 888-209-8124. Call during the hours of operation: Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm. (Please note that you may have difficulty reaching a representative when there is high call volume.) If you claimed for the entire week but you worked between 11-30 hours, it is very important for you to contact us. If you don’t contact us, you may have to repay benefits and be subject to civil penalties and the loss of future benefits.What if I work part time?\n\nNYS DOL’s new partial unemployment system uses an “hours-based” approach. Under the new approach, claimants can claim partial unemployment for a week if they work 30 hours or fewer and earn $504 or less in gross pay excluding earnings from self-employment. With this change, claimants’ benefits will not be reduced for each day they engage in part-time work and will be reduced in increments based on total hours of work for the week.\n\nPartial benefits are available as follows:\n\n0 – 10 hours of work (equivalent to 0 days worked): 100% of weekly benefit rate\n\n11 – 16 hours of work (equivalent to 1 day worked): 75% of weekly benefit rate\n\n17 – 21 hours of work (equivalent to 2 days worked): 50% of weekly benefit rate\n\n22 – 30 hours of work (equivalent to 3 days worked): 25% of weekly benefit rate\n\n31+ hours of work (equivalent to 4 days worked): 0% of weekly benefit rate\n\nIf you earn more than $504 in any week, no matter how many hours you worked, you cannot receive benefits for that week.\n\nPlease note: If you are certifying for benefit weeks prior to August 16, 2021, you must use the prior guidelines, which can be found at on.ny.gov/partialui.\n\nCan I file a claim if I lost my full-time work, but still work part-time?\n\nYes, if you work 30 hours or fewer in a week and earn $504 or less, you may receive partial UI. When you file your UI claim:\n\nYou will be asked to enter the date of your last day worked. Enter the last day you worked physically reported to work, regardless of whether this was your part-time or full-time work.\n\nYou will also be asked to enter information about your last or most recent employer. The last or most recent employer is where you most recently reported to work, regardless of whether this was your part-time or full-time employer. If it was your part-time employer, and you will continue to work part-time, enter \"lack of work\" as the reason for separation.\n\nI’m back to work, but only part time. How should I answer the question “Have you returned to work?” when I certify?When certifying weekly, you will be asked if you have returned to work. If you have returned to work, answer “yes” — even if you have only returned part time. If you work 30 hours or fewer in a week and making $504 or less per week (in gross wages), you may be eligible for partial unemployment benefits. Continue to accurately report your hours worked and wages earned each week to receive partial benefits if you are eligible. If you are receiving unemployment benefits through the Shared Work program, please visit dol.ny.gov/how-file-claim-under-shared-work-programWill working a second, part-time job affect my benefit rate?Yes. Any work with a different employer or self-employment will reduce the amount of Shared Work benefits that you may receive each week. As with regular unemployment. For each day that you work in a week as defined under rule that applies to the period you worked, you lose one-quarter of your Shared Work benefits. For example, if you normally receive $80 in Shared Work benefits and you work 20 hours in a week at your additional part-time job, your benefit amount would be reduced by half to $40. Get more information about partial unemployment at on.ny.gov/partial.What should I do if I was furloughed initially, and then laid off? Will there be an impact on my unemployment benefits?If you are collecting benefits because you were temporarily laid off (furloughed) and told you would be called back to your job, but now you do not have a job to return to, then you still qualify for unemployment benefits. The only change is that you must now engage in a diligent search for new work (see: Work Search Frequently Asked Questions). Continue to certify weekly, accurately noting any hours worked and whether your earned more than $504 in gross wages until you are back to work for good.I received an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). Will that impact my unemployment?\n\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) are not like the Paycheck Protection Program because they do not have to be used for payroll. Therefore, you may be able to receive both an EIDL and unemployment insurance or pandemic unemployment assistance benefits.\n\nIf you are receiving an Economic Injury Disaster Loan, please note:\n\nThe time spent applying for EIDL or taking care of other business matters is considered work, and you should not claim benefits for those hours.\n\nIf you do use the EIDL for one week's payroll, you will not be entitled to unemployment benefits for that week. If you are still unemployed the next week, you can continue claiming.\n\nIf you use the EIDL for something other than payroll (e.g., paying other business expenses like bills), you may have partial eligibility for that week. Because any time you spend taking care of business matters is considered work, you can only claim for benefits for hours you do not take those actions.\n\nWhat does the Department of Labor consider work?\n\nWe consider you employed in any week when you perform any services for more than four hours total, whether this work is:\n\nAn hour or less in self-employment\n\nOn a free-lance basis or\n\nFor someone else\n\nIt makes no difference whether this work is covered employment or whether you are paid for that day. For example, work on a straight commission basis is still work. It does not matter that you may not receive the commission until sometime later. It also does not matter if you have not made any sales or received any compensation.\n\nYou must report all of the work you do, whether it is for:\n\nYourself\n\nA friend\n\nA relative or\n\nAn employer\n\nYou must report any activity that brings in or may bring in income at any time.\n\nIf you are:\n\nDoing freelance work\n\nSelf-employed\n\nStarting a business or\n\nDoing \"favors\" for another business\n\nCall the Telephone Claim Center and give all the details before you claim your weekly benefits.\n\nWhat if I do freelance work or other self-employment?\n\nYou must report any activity that brings in or may bring in income at any time. If you are:\n\nDoing freelance work\n\nSelf-employed\n\nStarting a business or\n\nDoing \"favors\" for another business\n\ncall the Telephone Claim Center and give all the details before you claim your weekly benefits.\n\nWhat if I want to help a friend or relative?We may consider you employed on any day or any part of a day when you perform even minor duties or \"favors\" for a friend's or relative's business. It does not matter whether you are paid or not. Call the Telephone Claim Center and give all the details before you claim benefits.What if I do volunteer work?In certain instances, you may collect unemployment benefits while you do volunteer work. You must meet all of these conditions: The volunteer work is for a charitable, religious or cultural organization\n\nAND\n\nYou do not receive payment in any form for your volunteer work\n\n(Example: if you \"volunteer\" at a school in exchange for tuition abatement or scholarship, we do not consider this true volunteer work. This work would affect your eligibility for unemployment benefits.)\n\nAND\n\nThe volunteer work is not a precondition to being hired or rehired into a paid position(Example: if you volunteer while on a layoff from a social services agency that is between budgets or grants, we do not consider this true volunteer work. This work would affect your eligibility for unemployment benefits.)\n\nAND\n\nYour volunteer duties do not interfere with your ability to search for work\n\nAND\n\nDo not affect or limit the number of days and hours you are willing to workWhat if I want to start my own business?\n\nTell the Telephone Claims Center before you take any steps to start a business. Unless you are part of the Self-Employment Assistance Program (SEAP), these activities may result in the loss of unemployment insurance benefits. See more information on SEAP. The Department of Labor considers you employed if you operate or start a business:\n\nBy yourself\n\nWith a partner, or\n\nIn a corporate arrangement\n\nIf you spend time during the day or evening or on weekends getting ready to start or actually operating a business, we may consider that as work. It does not matter if you have not made any sales or received any compensation.\n\nHow will I receive my unemployment payments?\n\nWe issue payments through:\n\nA debit card\n\nOR\n\nDirect deposit into your checking account\n\nDebit Card\n\nThe debit card lets you withdraw your benefits via an ATM or at a Point-of-Sale terminal. Debit cards are safer than checks. Only the Department of Labor can deposit money into the debit card account. For details, visit our Debit Card for Unemployment Insurance Benefits page. The debit card provided by the Department is free. We encourage you to avoid using third-party debit cards typically purchased at stores.\n\nDirect Deposit\n\nYou may choose to have your weekly benefits electronically transferred into your checking account, if your bank has a direct deposit program. For details, visit our Direct Deposit Information page.\n\nHow do I protect my unemployment benefits?\n\nDo not respond to emails or text messages from unknown sources that ask you to disclose personal information, such as your:\n\nSocial Security number\n\nDebit card number\n\nDirect deposit bank account number\n\nPIN number\n\nThis is a clear mark of potential fraud. NOTE: The Department of Labor may use DocuSign, emails and texts to communicate with you about the status of your claim. These communications will be clearly labeled as being sent from the Department of Labor. See the DocuSign FAQs.\n\nIf you think someone has compromised your account, contact:\n\nYour bank (for direct deposit), or\n\nWay2Go Program Customer Service Line (for debit cards) at (844) 649-9845\n\nNever tell anyone your PIN or write your PIN down where others can see it. As a safety measure, we also recommend that you reset your PIN often. You should also reset your PIN any time you think someone else knows it. To change your PIN, call the Telephone Claims Center at (888) 209-8124 and follow the menu options to change your PIN. You may need to speak with a representative. Call during the hours of operation: Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm.\n\nWhat if I think my payment is late?\n\nFirst, see if we have released your benefit payment. Then, check to see if we deposited your benefit payment into your checking account or your debit card account.\n\nFor debit card users:\n\nTo find out if we have released a payment, log in with your NY.gov ID click on 'Unemployment Services'. Then, click on 'View Payment History.'\n\nIf we have released the payment:m check your debit card account by going to GoProgram.com, using the Way2Go Card mobile app, or calling the Way2Go Program Customer Service Line at (844) 649-9845\n\nYou will need your PIN.\n\nFor direct deposit users:\n\nTo find out if we have released a payment, log in with your NY.gov ID and click on 'Unemployment Services'. Then, click on 'View Payment History.'\n\nIf we have released the payment, check with your bank three business days after the payment release date to see if the payment is in your checking account.\n\nIf there is a problem on your claim, the Telephone Claims Center may contact you. Follow the directions they give you. If we have not credited your payment and the Telephone Claims Center has not contacted you in two weeks, you should call the Telephone Claims Center.\n\nHow can I speak to a claims specialist at the Telephone Claims Center?At the main menu, choose option #5 \"To speak to a representative about a claim you have already filed\" and follow the instructions.\n\n*If you are a person with a disability, who cannot access our services without help from another person, you may take that help. However, you must be with the person each time they access the services, including the entry of the PIN. You will be responsible for the actions of your agent. You may be subject to penalties, including loss of benefits, if you are not present when your agent accesses our services.When is the best time to call the Telephone Claims Center?The Telephone Claims Center is usually less busy on Thursday and Friday afternoons. During heavy call times, you may hear a message that all representatives are busy with other customers. You will need to call back to speak with a representative. (Please note: We have experienced extremely high call volume due to the COVID-19 emergency, and you may have difficulty reaching an agent.)\n\nTo reach the Telephone Claims Center:\n\nCall toll-free at 888-209-8124 during the hours of operation: Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm.What if I leave the area?If you leave your normal labor market to travel to another area, you must call the Telephone Claims Center before you leave. They will tell you whether your benefit rights can be protected while you are away. You could lose your benefits if you fail to advise the TCC before you leave. Also, when you travel to a foreign country (except Canada), you should not use our web or phone systems to claim benefits. If you attempt to do so, your access will be blocked, and your claim will be put on hold. Be sure to respond to the questionnaires we will send through your secure two-way communication mailbox. If we learn that you received benefits while outside of the United States, or that you had someone else claim for you, we will issue a fraud overpayment determination. That makes you liable to repay any benefits that you were not entitled to receive, includes financial penalties, and will cause you to lose the right to future benefits.\n\nYou are in a foreign country when you go outside of the United States or a U.S. Territory (except Canada). Claimants may file for UI benefits from Canada using our web or phone systems. However, if you plan to leave your normal labor market to travel to Canada, you still must call the Telephone Claims Center before you go.What kind of work must I accept?\n\nYou must be ready to accept \"suitable\" work while you collect benefits. Suitable work is work that you can reasonably do through your past training and experience. This means that you have to look for work in all your most recent occupations, especially if the chance of getting work in your primary skill area is not good. After you have claimed 10 full weeks of benefits, suitable work also includes:\n\nAny work that you can do, even if you have no experience or training in such work; unless you are hired through a union hiring hall or have a definite date to return to work.\n\nSuch work must pay at least 80% of your high-quarter base-period wages. Any work offered must pay the prevailing wage for such work. See Prevailing Unemployment Insurance Rates.\n\nYou must also be willing to travel a reasonable distance to get work. As a rule, we consider a reasonable distance to be travel of:\n\nOne hour by private transportation, or\n\nOne and one-half hours by public transportation.\n\nWhat should I do when I return to work?When you return to work, you should claim credit for the last days you were out of work.

If you work 30 hours or less in a week and do not earn over the maximum benefit rate, you may be eligible to receive a partial benefit payment.\n\nMake sure to keep your PIN, NY.gov identification, password, and debit card (if you have one) in a safe place in case you need to start claiming benefits again.What should I do if I lose my job again?If you lose your job again, for any reason, and your benefit year has not expired, you have the right to reopen your claim.

If you were the sole contributor to the pension, then your benefit rate will not be reduced. The Telephone Claim Center will make a determination of any reduction in your weekly unemployment benefit rate. As with other determinations, you may request a hearing if you disagree with the reduction.\n\nIt is your responsibility to notify the Telephone Claims Center if you become eligible for a pension while receiving benefits.
