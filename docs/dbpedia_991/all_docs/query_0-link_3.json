In this way I will get another version of the text. However, I do not want to have two strings representing each version of the text since there are a lot of \"repetitions\" (similarities) between the two subsequent versions. In other words, the differences between the strings are small, so that it makes more sense just to save differences between them. For example, the first versions.\n\nThis is my first version of the texts.\n\nThe second version:\n\nThis is the first version of the text, that I want to use as an example.\n\nI would like to save these two versions as one object (it should not necessarily be XML, I use it just as an example):\n\nThis is the <removed>my</removed> <added>first</added> version of the text<added>, that I want to use as an example</added>.\n\nNow I want to go further. I want to save all subsequent edits as one object. In other words, I am going to have more than two versions of the text, but I would like to save them as one object such that it is easy to get a given version of the text and easy to find out what are the difference between two subsequent (or any two given) versions."
