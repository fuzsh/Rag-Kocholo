        "text": "Theories are formulated to explain, predict, and understand phenomena and, in many cases, to challenge and extend existing knowledge within the limits of critical bounded assumptions or predictions of behavior. The theoretical framework is the structure that can hold or support a theory of a research study. The theoretical framework encompasses not just the theory, but the narrative explanation about how the researcher engages in using the theory and its underlying assumptions to investigate the research problem. It is the structure of your paper that summarizes concepts, ideas, and theories derived from prior research studies and which was synthesized in order to form a conceptual basis for your analysis and interpretation of meaning found within your research.\n\nAbend, Gabriel. \"The Meaning of Theory.\" Sociological Theory 26 (June 2008): 173–199; Kivunja, Charles. \"Distinguishing between Theory, Theoretical Framework, and Conceptual Framework: A Systematic Review of Lessons from the Field.\" International Journal of Higher Education 7 (December 2018): 44-53; Swanson, Richard A.

However, in their most simplified form, a theory is simply a set of assumptions or predictions about something you think will happen based on existing evidence and that can be tested to see if those outcomes turn out to be true. Of course, it is slightly more deliberate than that, therefore, summarized from Kivunja (2018, p. 46), here are the essential characteristics of a theory.\n\nIt is logical and coherent\n\nIt has clear definitions of terms or variables, and has boundary conditions [i.e., it is not an open-ended statement]\n\nIt has a domain where it applies\n\nIt has clearly described relationships among variables\n\nIt describes, explains, and makes specific predictions\n\nIt comprises of concepts, themes, principles, and constructs\n\nIt must have been based on empirical data [i.e., it is not a guess]\n\nIt must have made claims that are subject to testing, been tested and verified\n\nIt must be clear and concise\n\nIts assertions or predictions must be different and better than those in existing theories\n\nIts predictions must be general enough to be applicable to and understood within multiple contexts\n\nIts assertions or predictions are relevant, and if applied as predicted, will result in the predicted outcome\n\nThe assertions and predictions are not immutable, but subject to revision and improvement as researchers use the theory to make sense of phenomena\n\nIts concepts and principles explain what is going on and why\n\nIts concepts and principles are substantive enough to enable us to predict a future\n\nGiven these characteristics, a theory can best be understood as the foundation from which you investigate assumptions or predictions derived from previous studies about the research problem, but in a way that leads to new knowledge and understanding as well as, in some cases, discovering how to improve the relevance of the theory itself or to argue that the theory is outdated and a new theory needs to be formulated based on new evidence.\n\nA theoretical framework consists of concepts and, together with their definitions and reference to relevant scholarly literature, existing theory that is used for your particular study. The theoretical framework must demonstrate an understanding of theories and concepts that are relevant to the topic of your research paper and that relate to the broader areas of knowledge being considered.\n\nThe theoretical framework is most often not something readily found within the literature. You must review course readings and pertinent research studies for theories and analytic models that are relevant to the research problem you are investigating. The selection of a theory should depend on its appropriateness, ease of application, and explanatory power.\n\nThe theoretical framework strengthens the study in the following ways:\n\nAn explicit statement of theoretical assumptions permits the reader to evaluate them critically.\n\nThe theoretical framework connects the researcher to existing knowledge. Guided by a relevant theory, you are given a basis for your hypotheses and choice of research methods.\n\nArticulating the theoretical assumptions of a research study forces you to address questions of why and how. It permits you to intellectually transition from simply describing a phenomenon you have observed to generalizing about various aspects of that phenomenon.\n\nHaving a theory helps you identify the limits to those generalizations. A theoretical framework specifies which key variables influence a phenomenon of interest and highlights the need to examine how those key variables might differ and under what circumstances.\n\nThe theoretical framework adds context around the theory itself based on how scholars had previously tested the theory in relation their overall research design [i.e., purpose of the study, methods of collecting data or information, methods of analysis, the time frame in which information is collected, study setting, and the methodological strategy used to conduct the research].\n\nBy virtue of its applicative nature, good theory in the social sciences is of value precisely because it fulfills one primary purpose: to explain the meaning, nature, and challenges associated with a phenomenon, often experienced but unexplained in the world in which we live, so that we may use that knowledge and understanding to act in more informed and effective ways.\n\nThe Conceptual Framework.

Developing the Framework\n\nHere are some strategies to develop of an effective theoretical framework:\n\nExamine your thesis title and research problem. The research problem anchors your entire study and forms the basis from which you construct your theoretical framework.\n\nBrainstorm about what you consider to be the key variables in your research. Answer the question, \"What factors contribute to the presumed effect?\"\n\nReview related literature to find how scholars have addressed your research problem. Identify the assumptions from which the author(s) addressed the problem.\n\nList the constructs and variables that might be relevant to your study. Group these variables into independent and dependent categories.\n\nReview key social science theories that are introduced to you in your course readings and choose the theory that can best explain the relationships between the key variables in your study [note the Writing Tip on this page].\n\nDiscuss the assumptions or propositions of this theory and point out their relevance to your research.\n\nA theoretical framework is used to limit the scope of the relevant data by focusing on specific variables and defining the specific viewpoint [framework] that the researcher will take in analyzing and interpreting the data to be gathered. It also facilitates the understanding of concepts and variables according to given definitions and builds new knowledge by validating or challenging theoretical assumptions.\n\nII. Purpose\n\nThink of theories as the conceptual basis for understanding, analyzing, and designing ways to investigate relationships within social systems. To that end, the following roles served by a theory can help guide the development of your framework.\n\nMeans by which new research data can be interpreted and coded for future use,\n\nResponse to new problems that have no previously identified solutions strategy,\n\nMeans for identifying and defining research problems,\n\nMeans for prescribing or evaluating solutions to research problems,\n\nWays of discerning certain facts among the accumulated knowledge that are important and which facts are not,\n\nMeans of giving old data new interpretations and new meaning,\n\nMeans by which to identify important new issues and prescribe the most critical research questions that need to be answered to maximize understanding of the issue,\n\nMeans of providing members of a professional discipline with a common language and a frame of reference for defining the boundaries of their profession, and\n\nMeans to guide and inform research so that it can, in turn, guide research efforts and improve professional practice.\n\nAdapted from: Torraco, R.

Many social science research papers fit into this rubric. For example, Peripheral Realism Theory, which categorizes perceived differences among nation-states as those that give orders, those that obey, and those that rebel, could be used as a means for understanding conflicted relationships among countries in Africa. A test of this theory could be the following: Does Peripheral Realism Theory help explain intra-state actions, such as, the disputed split between southern and northern Sudan that led to the creation of two nations?\n\nHowever, you may not always be asked by your professor to test a specific theory in your paper, but to develop your own framework from which your analysis of the research problem is derived. Based upon the above example, it is perhaps easiest to understand the nature and function of a theoretical framework if it is viewed as an answer to two basic questions:\n\nWhat is the research problem/question? [e.g., \"How should the individual and the state relate during periods of conflict?\"]\n\nWhy is your approach a feasible solution? [i.e., justify the application of your choice of a particular theory and explain why alternative constructs were rejected. I could choose instead to test Instrumentalist or Circumstantialists models developed among ethnic conflict theorists that rely upon socio-economic-political factors to explain individual-state relations and to apply this theoretical model to periods of war between nations].\n\nThe answers to these questions come from a thorough review of the literature and your course readings [summarized and analyzed in the next section of your paper] and the gaps in the research that emerge from the review process. With this in mind, a complete theoretical framework will likely not emerge until after you have completed a thorough review of the literature.\n\nJust as a research problem in your paper requires contextualization and background information, a theory requires a framework for understanding its application to the topic being investigated. When writing and revising this part of your research paper, keep in mind the following:\n\nClearly describe the framework, concepts, models, or specific theories that underpin your study. This includes noting who the key theorists are in the field who have conducted research on the problem you are investigating and, when necessary, the historical context that supports the formulation of that theory. This latter element is particularly important if the theory is relatively unknown or it is borrowed from another discipline.\n\nPosition your theoretical framework within a broader context of related frameworks, concepts, models, or theories. As noted in the example above, there will likely be several concepts, theories, or models that can be used to help develop a framework for understanding the research problem. Therefore, note why the theory you've chosen is the appropriate one.\n\nThe present tense is used when writing about theory. Although the past tense can be used to describe the history of a theory or the role of key theorists, the construction of your theoretical framework is happening now.\n\nYou should make your theoretical assumptions as explicit as possible. Later, your discussion of methodology should be linked back to this theoretical framework.\n\nDon’t just take what the theory says as a given! Reality is never accurately represented in such a simplistic way; if you imply that it can be, you fundamentally distort a reader's ability to understand the findings that emerge. Given this, always note the limitations of the theoretical framework you've chosen [i.e., what parts of the research problem require further investigation because the theory inadequately explains a certain phenomena].\n\nThe Conceptual Framework.
