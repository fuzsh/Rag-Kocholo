        "text": "confirmation bias\n\npsychology\n\nconfirmation bias, people’s tendency to process information by looking for, or interpreting, information that is consistent with their existing beliefs. This biased approach to decision making is largely unintentional, and it results in a person ignoring information that is inconsistent with their beliefs. These beliefs can include a person’s expectations in a given situation and their predictions about a particular outcome. People are especially likely to process information to support their own beliefs when an issue is highly important or self-relevant.\n\nBackground\n\nConfirmation bias is one example of how humans sometimes process information in an illogical, biased manner. The manner in which a person knows and understands the world is often affected by factors that are simply unknown to that person. Philosophers note that people have difficulty processing information in a rational, unbiased manner once they have developed an opinion about an issue. Humans are better able to rationally process information, giving equal weight to multiple viewpoints, if they are emotionally distant from the issue (although a low level of confirmation bias can still occur when an individual has no vested interests).\n\n(Read Steven Pinker’s Britannica entry on rationality.)\n\nOne explanation for why people are susceptible to confirmation bias is that it is an efficient way to process information. Humans are incessantly bombarded with information and cannot possibly take the time to carefully process each piece of information to form an unbiased conclusion. Human decision making and information processing is often biased because people are limited to interpreting information from their own viewpoint. People need to process information quickly to protect themselves from harm. It is adaptive for humans to rely on instinctive, automatic behaviours that keep them out of harm’s way.\n\nAnother reason why people show confirmation bias is to protect their self-esteem. People like to feel good about themselves, and discovering that a belief that they highly value is incorrect makes them feel bad about themselves. Therefore, people will seek information that supports their existing beliefs. Another closely related motive is wanting to be correct. People want to feel that they are intelligent, but information that suggests that they are wrong or that they made a poor decision suggests they are lacking intelligence—and thus confirmation bias will encourage them to disregard this information.\n\nEvidence\n\nResearch has shown that confirmation bias is strong and widespread and that it occurs in several contexts. In the context of decision making, once an individual makes a decision, they will look for information that supports it. Information that conflicts with a person’s decision may cause discomfort, and the person will therefore ignore it or give it little consideration. People give special treatment to information that supports their personal beliefs. In studies examining my-side bias, people were able to generate and remember more reasons supporting their side of a controversial issue than the opposing side. Only when a researcher directly asked people to generate arguments against their own beliefs were they able to do so. It is not that people are incapable of generating arguments that are counter to their beliefs, but, rather, people are not motivated to do so.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

When seeking information to support their hypotheses or expectations, people tend to look for positive evidence that confirms that a hypothesis is true rather than information that would prove the view is false (if it is false).\n\nConfirmation bias also operates in impression formation. If people are told what to expect from a person they are about to meet, such as that the person is warm, friendly, and outgoing, people will look for information that supports their expectations. When interacting with people whom perceivers think have certain personalities, the perceivers will ask questions of those people that are biased toward supporting the perceivers’ beliefs. For example, if Maria expects her roommate to be friendly and outgoing, Maria may ask her if she likes to go to parties rather than asking if she often studies in the library.\n\nImportance\n\nConfirmation bias is important because it may lead people to hold strongly to false beliefs or to give more weight to information that supports their beliefs than is warranted by the evidence. People may be overconfident in their beliefs because they have accumulated evidence to support them, when in reality they have overlooked or ignored a great deal of evidence refuting their beliefs—evidence which, if they had considered it, should lead them to question their beliefs. These factors may lead to risky decision making and lead people to overlook warning signs and other important information. In this manner, confirmation bias is often a component of black swan events, which are high-impact events that are unexpected but, in retrospect, appear to be inevitable.\n\nImplications\n\nConfirmation bias has important implications in the real world, including in medicine, law, and interpersonal relationships. Research has shown that medical doctors are just as likely to have confirmation biases as everyone else. Doctors often have a preliminary hunch regarding the diagnosis of a medical condition early in the treatment process. This hunch can interfere with the doctor’s ability to assess information that may indicate an alternative diagnosis is more likely. Another related outcome is how patients react to diagnoses. Patients are more likely to agree with a diagnosis that supports their preferred outcome than a diagnosis that goes against their preferred outcome. Both of these examples demonstrate that confirmation bias has implications for individuals’ health and well-being.\n\nIn the context of law, judges and jurors sometimes form an opinion about a defendant’s guilt or innocence before all of the evidence is known. Once a judge or juror forms an opinion, confirmation bias will interfere with their ability to process new information that emerges during a trial, which may lead to unjust verdicts.\n\nIn interpersonal relations, confirmation bias can be problematic because it may lead a person to form inaccurate and biased impressions of others. This may result in miscommunication and conflict in intergroup settings. In addition, when someone treats a person according to their expectations, that person may unintentionally change their behavior to conform to the other person’s expectations, thereby providing further support for the perceiver’s confirmation bias.\n\nBettina J.
