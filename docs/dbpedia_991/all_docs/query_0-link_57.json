        "text": "The Bureau of Public Work and Prevailing Wage Enforcement is responsible for enforcing New York State's prevailing wage laws, which are found in Articles 8 & 9 of the Labor Law.\n\nOn the first of July each year, the Bureau publishes the annual wage schedule. Links to this year's schedule and an archive for prior years can be found below.\n\nWe also handle underpayment complaints made by employees on public work and covered projects. After receiving a complaint, we conduct an investigation to determine whether or not the contractor or subcontractor has paid the proper prevailing rate of wages and supplements. In addition to the repayment of wages, offenders may also be assessed interest and penalties. Willful violations of prevailing wage laws may also result in debarment from being able to bid on public work projects.\n\nNew York workers are essential to public work projects, so we at the Bureau of Public Work and Prevailing Wage Enforcement are here to protect you.\n\nOverview of the Prevailing Wage and Bureau of Public Work\n\nWhat is the difference between Articles 8 & 9?\n\nNew York State Labor Law Article 8 covers public work and certain private construction projects receiving public funds.\n\nNew York State Labor Law Article 9 covers building service workers employed by a contractor under a contract with a public agency that is in excess of $1,500.\n\nWhat is Public Work?\n\nA three-prong test is applied to determine whether a particular project is public work and subject to the prevailing wage requirements of Labor Law ยง 220 and article I, ยง 17 of the State Constitution. First, a public agency must be a party to a contract involving the employment of laborers, workmen, or mechanics. Second, the contract must concern a project that primarily involves construction-like labor and is paid for by public funds. Third, the primary objective or function of the work product must be the use or other benefit of the general public.\n\nWho makes the determination whether a project is \"Public Work\"?\n\nGenerally, projects for construction, reconstruction or maintenance done on behalf of a public agency (entity) are public work. In instances where there is a question regarding whether this condition exists, the Bureau of Public Work and Prevailing Wage Enforcement will make a determination based on the project details.\n\nWhat is considered a Public Agency?\n\nA Public Agency is the State, any of its political subdivisions, a public benefit corporation, a public authority or commission or special purpose district board appointed pursuant to law, and a board of education.\n\nHow does the DOL determine which rate applies to a particular task?\n\nThe Bureau of Public Work and Prevailing Wage Enforcement looks at all factors, including:\n\nNature of the work\n\nCollective bargaining agreements\n\nJurisdictional agreements\n\nJurisdictional decisions\n\nHistorical practice\n\nPast DOL recognition\n\nCase law precedents\n\nIf you have additional questions, please see out additional FAQs for Article 8 and article 9 of Public Work.\n\nArticle 8 FAQ Article 9 FAQ"
