        "text": "Glycolysis is the pathway in which one glucose molecule is degraded into two pyruvate molecules. Interestingly, during the initial phase, energy is consumed because two ATP molecules are used up to activate glucose and fructose-6-phosphate. Part of the energy derived from the breakdown of the phosphoanhydride bond of ATP is conserved in the formation of phosphate-ester bonds in glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-biphosphate (Figure 4).\n\nIn the second part of glycolysis, the majority of the free energy obtained from the oxidation of the aldehyde group of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) is conserved in the acyl-phosphate group of 1,3- bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG), which contains high free energy. Then, part of the potential energy of 1,3BPG, released during its conversion to 3-phosphoglycerate, is coupled to the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The second reaction where ATP synthesis occurs is the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate. PEP is a high-energy compound due to its phosphate-ester bond, and therefore the conversion reaction of PEP to pyruvate is coupled with ADP phosphorylation. This mechanism of ATP synthesis is called substrate-level phosphorylation.\n\nFor complete oxidation, pyruvate molecules generated in glycolysis are transported to the mitochondrial matrix to be converted into acetyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by the multienzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase (Figure 5). When Krebs proposed the TCA cycle in 1937, he thought that citrate was synthesized from oxaloacetate and pyruvate (or a derivative of it). Only after Lipmann's discovery of coenzyme A in 1945 and the subsequent work of R. Stern, S. Ochoa, and F. Lynen did it become clear that the molecule acetyl-CoA donated its acetyl group to oxaloacetate. Until this time, the TCA cycle was seen as a pathway to carbohydrate oxidation only. Most high school textbooks reflect this period of biochemistry knowledge and do not emphasize how the lipid and amino acid degradation pathways converge on the TCA cycle."
