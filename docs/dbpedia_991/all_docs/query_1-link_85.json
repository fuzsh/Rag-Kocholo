Top candidates are well-rounded students from diverse backgrounds who demonstrate curiosity, team-orientation, excellence, a passion for exploration, agility, and resilience. Prior experience is not required! During the hiring process, we assess the following 12 competencies:\n\n•Accountability, Attention to Detail, Customer Service, Decision Making, Flexibility, Integrity/Honesty, Interpersonal Skills, Learning, Reading, Self-Management (Achievement), Stress Tolerance, and Teamwork\n\nThe Experience\n\nAs a Pathways Intern, we invest in you on purpose—assigning you with challenging, meaningful work aligned with your academic or career interests, providing you with life-long learning and growth opportunities, and cultivating a supportive community that offers you a home away from home.\n\nCareers After Graduation\n\nThroughout your Pathways Internship, you’re given the autonomy to define your own career trajectory at NASA. At the beginning of your internship, we will work with you to develop an “Individual Development Plan” that will help put your experience and path in your hands by defining assignments, training events, and learning opportunities that will help you achieve your career goals.\n\nAs you get closer to graduation, we will evaluate your experience and consider you for full-time employment that would begin after you complete your degree. No additional job applications needed!\n\nTypes of Internships\n\nWe offer a variety of internship opportunities across a variety of disciplines within the following OPM occupational classifications. We post the specific disciplines and skillsets we hire for in the weeks prior to applications opening.\n\nEngineering, Science, and Technology\n\nGS-899: Engineering\n\nGS-1399: Physical Sciences\n\nBusiness\n\nGS-0099: Safety & Occupational Health\n\nGS-199: Social Sciences\n\nGS-299: Human Resources\n\nGS-399: Administration and Program Management & Analysis\n\nGS-599: Accounting & Budget\n\nGS-1099: Communication & Public Relations\n\nGS-1199: Procurement and Contracts\n\nGS-1599: Math & Statistics\n\nGS-2299: Information Technology\n\nWhere We Work\n\nThere are several NASA centers located across the nation engaged in a variety of work.

Each vacancy lists multiple NASA Center locations and has different educational requirements (e.g., specific academic majors). To begin the process, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Do your research. Learn about the type of work performed at each of our NASA facilities so that you’ll be able to find where you’d best fit at NASA based on your academic and career interests.\n\nStep 2: Prepare your application. Visit USAJobs.gov to create your profile, build your resume, and set up a notification that will alert you when our positions open. Check out our tips below for building your resume.\n\nStep 3: Apply to a vacancy during the open application window. When you apply, be sure to apply to the vacancy that aligns with BOTH your academic major and preferred geographic location(s) in order to route your application to the type of work you’re interested in. Take a look at our Applicant Guide for lots of information on what to expect during the application process.\n\nUse of Artificial Intelligence\n\nCan I use ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence tools to assist in drafting application and assessment responses?\n\nNASA prohibits candidates from plagiarizing any portion of their employment application to include responses to questions in which you must provide a narrative response. You must create your own responses originally and not copy or adapt them from other sources. While NASA encourages you to create your narratives with great care, including correct use of grammar and style, you are prohibited from using any artificial intelligence (AI) or AI-assisted tool, to include but not limited to ChatGPT. Any information you provide during the application process is subject to verification. NASA will discontinue your candidacy if we find you have violated this prohibition on use of AI tools in the application process.\n\nWriting Your Resume\n\nNASA wants to get to know you and see your story – so be clear and concise, but elaborate! Your resume is your best opportunity to demonstrate what sets you apart from other applicants. Write your USAJobs resume in a narrative format, where you highlight your accomplishments by using the CAR method (Challenge/Action/Result).\n\nMeet Our Interns\n\nAre you ready for your NASA Internship?
