        "text": "Organize the backlog: Sometimes known as backlog grooming, this event is the responsibility of the product owner. The product ownerâs main jobs are to drive the product towards its product vision and have a constant pulse on the market and the customer. Therefore, he/she maintains this list using feedback from users and the development team to help prioritize and keep the list clean and ready to be worked on at any given time. You can read more about maintaining a healthy backlog here.\n\nSprint planning: The work to be performed (scope) during the current sprint is planned during this meeting by the entire development team. This meeting is led by the scrum master and is where the team decides on the sprint goal. Specific user stories are then added to the sprint from the product backlog. Â These stories always align with the goal and are also agreed upon by the scrum team to be feasible to implement during the sprint.\n\nAt the end of the planning meeting, every scrum member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.\n\nSprint: A sprint is the actual time period when the scrum team works together to finish an increment. Two weeks is a pretty typical length for a sprint, though some teams find a week to be easier to scope or a month to be easier to deliver a valuable increment. Dave West, from Scrum.org advises that the more complex the work and the more unknowns, the shorter the sprint should be. But itâs really up to your team, and you shouldnât be afraid to change it if itâs not working! During this period, the scope can be re-negotiated between the product owner and the development team if necessary. This forms the crux of the empirical nature of scrum.\n\nAll the events â from planning to retrospective â happen during the sprint. Once a certain time interval for a sprint is established, it has to remain consistent throughout the development period. This helps the team learn from past experiences and apply that insight to future sprints.\n\nDaily scrum or stand up: This is a daily super-short meeting that happens at the same time (usually mornings) and a place to keep it simple. Many teams try to complete the meeting in 15 minutes, but thatâs just a guideline. This meeting is also called a âdaily stand-upâ emphasizing that it needs to be a quick one. The goal of the daily scrum is for everyone on the team to be on the same page, aligned with the sprint goal, and to get a plan out for the next 24 hours.\n\nThe stand up is the time to voice any concerns you have with meeting the sprint goal or any blockers.\n\nA common way to conduct a stand up is for every team member to answer three questions in the context of achieving the sprint goal:\n\nâ¢ What did I do yesterday?\n\nâ¢ What do I plan to do today?\n\nâ¢ Are there any obstacles?\n\nHowever, weâve seen the meeting quickly turn into people reading from their calendars from yesterday and for the next day. The theory behind the stand up is that it keeps distracting chatter to a daily meeting, so the team can focus on the work for the rest of the day. Â So if it turns into a daily calendar read-out, donât be afraid to change it up and get creative.\n\nSprint review: At the end of the sprint, the team gets together for an informal session to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment. The development team showcases the backlog items that are now âDoneâ to stakeholders and teammates for feedback. The product owner can decide whether or not to release the increment, although in most cases the increment is released.\n\nThis review meeting is also when the product owner reworks the product backlog based on the current sprint, which can feed into the next sprint planning session. For a one-month sprint, consider time-boxing your sprint review to a maximum of four hours.\n\nSprint retrospective: The retrospective is where the team comes together to document and discuss what worked and what didnât work in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, or even for certain ceremonies. The idea is to create a place where the team can focus on what went well and what needs to be improved for the next time, and less about what went wrong."
