        "text": "Introducing low cost, multi camera, live production with advanced broadcast features.\n\nATEM Mini switchers make it easy to create professional multi camera productions for live streaming to YouTube and innovative business presentations using Zoom, Teams or Skype! Simply connect ATEM Mini and you can switch live up to 8 high quality video camera inputs for dramatically better quality images. Or connect a computer for PowerPoint slides or gaming consoles. The built in DVE allows exciting picture in picture effects, perfect for commentary! There are loads of video effects too! ATEM Mini has a built in hardware streaming engine for live streaming via ethernet, or stream via the USB which also works like a webcam. ATEM Mini even has secret broadcast features for high end work! Find Reseller\n\nFaster Video Production plus Live Streaming\n\nLive production is the fastest way to complete a finished program, plus you can stream it to a live global audience via YouTube at the same time. ATEM Mini models feature a built in hardware streaming engine, which works with any streaming software so you can directly stream via ethernet to popular social media platforms! With up to 8 HDMI inputs, depending on the model, you can set up multiple camera angles such as wide shots and close ups of each person in the performance. Then connect to a computer with a PowerPoint slide show or websites and gaming consoles. All switching is in real time so you can live stream your show to platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitch and many more!\n\nATEM Mini’s compact all in one design includes both a control panel as well as connections. The front panel includes easy to use buttons for selecting sources, video effects and transitions. The source buttons are large so it’s possible to use it by feel, letting the presenter do the switching! You even get buttons for audio mixing! You also get buttons for record and streaming control, as well as output selection buttons that let you change the video output between cameras, program and multiview. On the rear panel there are HDMI connections for cameras or computers or even gaming consoles, extra microphone inputs, USB for webcam out plus an HDMI \"aux\" output for program video.\n\nThere's never been a switcher that’s easier to use, as you simply press any of the input buttons labelled by number on the front panel to cut between video sources. You can choose between cut or effects transitions by selecting the cut or auto buttons. Unlike cut, the auto button tells ATEM Mini to use a video effect when switching inputs. You can select from exciting transitions such as dissolve, or more dramatic effects such as dip to color, DVE squeeze and DVE push. Add a DVE effect for picture in picture effects with customized picture positions and background. There are even \"media players\" which are a still store for titles and graphics that you can load via external software control.\n\nATEM Mini is ideal for interviews as you can connect multiple cameras for close ups of the host or interviewee, as well as wide shots plus ATEM Mini is so small the host can even switch in small studios. Plus ATEM Mini’s built in streaming supports live streaming to YouTube, Facebook and more!\n\nWith 4 or 8 HDMI inputs depending on the model, you can connect multiple cameras for different views. Video cameras with HDMI outputs are better quality than simple webcams as they use higher quality lenses and have better low light sensitivity. All video sources will re-sync to the switcher if they operate at different video standards so you don't have to worry about connecting video devices as they all just work! Cameras with HDMI often support interchangeable lenses so you can change to wide angle lenses for wide shots and zoom lenses for close ups. Imagine taking advantage of the low light capability of better cameras for theater production, weddings, school concerts and music videos!\n\nTo ensure maximum compatibility, all ATEM Mini models feature USB that operates as a simple webcam source. That means you can plug into a computer and get working with any video software! The software is tricked into thinking the ATEM Mini is a common webcam, but it's really a live production switcher. That guarantees full compatibility with any video software and in full resolution 1080HD quality. Choose any software you like, such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams or Skype for a new way to do presentations with a professional multi camera broadcast quality style! The ATEM Mini webcam output also works with streaming software such as Open Broadcaster, XSplit Broadcaster and more!\n\nATEM Mini has a built in hardware streaming engine for live streaming via their Ethernet connections without the need for a computer. That means you can live stream to YouTube, Facebook and Twitch in better quality, without dropped frames and with simpler settings. Just select the streaming service and enter the streaming key! There are palettes in ATEM Software Control for streaming setup, plus streaming status is also displayed in the multiview. Streaming status is easy to understand as the data rate indicator shows internet speed required for the video format you're using. If you're technically minded, you can update the streaming profiles in an XML settings file to load new services.\n\nIf you’re doing live production on location then ATEM Mini supports connecting an Apple or Android smartphone to the USB port to use mobile data! It's also a great backup for the main Ethernet connection. Phone tethering works with the latest high speed 5G phones plus the more common 4G phones! The ATEM Mini switcher will automatically detect when a phone is connected to the USB port and switch its internet connection to use it, eliminating the need for changing settings. When connected, the phone will draw power from the USB port so it remains charged from the switcher. By using phone tethering and mobile data, ATEM Mini switchers become the perfect mobile production solution!\n\nRecord Direct to USB Flash Disks\n\nATEM Mini also supports direct recording of your streaming data to USB flash disks! That means you get very long recording times in the same H.264 video files with AAC audio that you streamed, so you can directly upload to any online video site, such as YouTube or Vimeo more quickly. Recording to multiple disks is also supported via a USB hub or Blackmagic MultiDock, so when a disk fills recording can continue to a second disk for non-stop recording. Record settings and disk selection are set up in ATEM Software Control and there's a record status view in the built in multiview. You can even remotely trigger recording on connected Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Cameras!\n\nThis model adds all the features of ATEM Mini Pro plus it records 5 H.264 video streams in real time! That's a clean feed of all inputs plus the live program! A DaVinci Resolve project is also saved so you can open your live production to adjust edits, remix audio and add color correction!\n\nThis model includes all the features of ATEM Mini Extreme, plus also records 9 separate H.264 video streams in real time, allowing capture of all 8 clean feed inputs as well as the program video. A DaVinci Resolve project file is also saved allowing the project to be recreated and edited later!\n\nThe ISO models also save a DaVinci Resolve project file, so with a single click you can open your live production as a video edit. All cuts, dissolves and media pool graphics will be loaded. This means you can fine tune edit points or even completely replace shots! The DaVinci Resolve Sync Bin lets you select new shots via a multiview so it's very easy to use. You can even relink to Blackmagic RAW camera files for adding professional color correction and finishing in Ultra HD!\n\nLearn more about DaVinci Resolve > Download Demonstration Project >\n\nOne of the benefits of ATEM Mini is the professional production values that are possible using the range of built in video effects! The cut button ensures an instant cut when switching between sources. The auto button is a professional term that's used on large broadcast switchers to enable video effect transitions. There are duration buttons for video effects allowing 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 second settings. You can also select the type of effect you want including mix, which does a smooth transition between sources, and dip which fades via a color during the transition. Or use fun DVE effects that move the image off screen when transitioning between sources!\n\nWith two independent 3.5mm stereo audio inputs, you can connect desktop and lapel microphones. You can even connect a music player to generate introduction music after the live stream commences but before the program starts. With 2 extra stereo audio inputs, you can ensure a host and guest both have lapel microphones when doing interviews. All audio inputs to ATEM Mini include buttons on the panel for adjusting audio level and enabling inputs into the audio mixer. Plus all models feature a Fairlight audio mixer with all HDMI inputs and both microphone inputs are all connected to the audio mixer so you can live mix from all audio sources. The ATEM Mini Extreme also adds a headphone output.\n\nEach of the HDMI inputs feature their own dedicated standards converter. That means ATEM Mini will automatically convert 1080p, 1080i and 720p sources to the switcher video standard! By default the switcher will set its video format automatically, however you can also set the switcher to any video standard! The HDMI outputs are a true \"aux\" output so you can clean switch each HDMI input to the output. You can even \"direct\" switch input 1 to the HDMI output for low latency eSport productions. Plus ATEM Mini Extreme models support 2 low latency direct loops! The HDMI output can display a full multiview that lets you see all inputs, program, preview and streaming status on a single monitor!\n\nWhile ATEM Mini is easy to use, it's also hiding very powerful broadcast features! If you're interested in a career in the television industry, then ATEM Mini is perfect for training as it has the same features as switchers in high end broadcast studios. You get an ATEM Advanced Chroma Key, Fairlight audio mixer, DVE, still store for graphics and much more! Simply run the free ATEM Software Control app on Mac or Windows while connected via USB or Ethernet to access the extended features of the ATEM Mini. With a little experimentation you can learn how to produce broadcast quality live production. Only ATEM Mini is a true broadcast switcher hidden in a tiny and affordable design!\n\nThe ATEM Software Control app unlocks the hidden power of ATEM Mini and allows access to every feature in the switcher. ATEM Software Control features a visual switcher user interface with parameter palettes for making quick adjustments. Although you can normally connect via USB, if you connect using Ethernet it's possible for multiple users to connect to ATEM Mini using separate copies of ATEM Software Control on different computers! The software lets you access full audio mixing with effects, load still frames and even do advanced macro programming! You can even save the switcher state as an XML file! If you need clip playback, you can even control HyperDeck disk recorders via Ethernet.\n\nOne of the most exciting features on ATEM Mini is the digital video effects processor, commonly referred to as a \"DVE\", that allows picture in picture effects and crazy DVE transitions! The DVE lets you create professional picture in picture effects with customizable 3D borders, shadows and lighting. The image quality is the same as high end ATEM switcher models and the DVE supports position, resize and scale, all in real time. The DVE can also be used to create amazing transitions with 16 different DVE squeeze and DVE push effects for adding excitement to your programming. The DVE features a \"fly key\" so you can use it with custom graphics to create graphic wipe transitions!\n\nATEM Mini includes a wide range of broadcast quality HD native transitions such as mix, dip, wipe and more. All transitions can be customized by adjusting parameters such as duration, border color, border width, position and direction. You can also use the DVE in transitions, allowing a graphic to be moved over the wipe edge which is called a graphic wipe, and is used in sports programming. To eliminate errors, ATEM Mini has a preview transition feature so you can check your transitions before putting them to air!\n\nBuilt-in Graphics with Photoshop Plug-In\n\nThe built in \"media pool\" allows the loading of up to 20 separate broadcast quality RGBA graphics for titles, opening plates and logos. The media player is used to output the selected image so it appears as an extra internal video source for use in graphics and titles. You can even use still frames for complex effects such as graphic wipes. ATEM Mini can also grab stills from the video output and add them to the internal media pool. Graphics can be loaded via ATEM Software Control or downloaded directly from Photoshop using the ATEM Photoshop plug-in. The Photoshop Plug-in is perfect for graphics that change often, such as scoreboards, as you can download directly into the media player.\n\nThe ATEM Mini Extreme models include 4 upstream chroma keyers and this allows you to build exciting virtual sets! With 4 independent chroma keyers, you get a keyer per camera so you can build a virtual set for up to 4 cameras. With ATEM Mini Extreme you have 8 inputs, 4 to use for cameras and the other 4 can be connected to a virtual set computer for the rendered backgrounds. Or you don't need to move your cameras, you can do fixed camera virtual sets by loading pre rendered still image backgrounds from the media players and media pool. You can setup macros to change cameras and load the correct background into the media players! Or even use a DeckLink Quad HDMI and live virtual set software!\n\nIn addition to 2 independent DVEs in the ATEM Mini Extreme models, there's also a powerful SuperSource multi layer processor with 4 extra DVE layers plus a background layer, that all appear to ATEM Mini Extreme as an additional input source. Any ATEM Mini Extreme video input can be used for each SuperSource DVE, then it’s all layered together over a media pool custom background. SuperSource is perfect for doing multiple picture in picture displays with people being interviewed because you can set up the effect before putting it to air, still keeping both main DVEs free for other tasks. SuperSource is just like having an extra multi-layer VFX switcher built in!\n\nAlthough ATEM Mini works in \"cut bus\" mode when first purchased, it can also be changed to \"program/preview\" style operation, which is the way large broadcasters use live production switchers. Cut bus switching is easy and selecting any input will instantly switch to that source. However if you want to operate ATEM Mini like a true professional then you can change the switcher to program/preview using ATEM Software Control. Mix effects operation allows a source to be selected but it won't be put on air until you press the cut or auto buttons. That 2 step program/preview process means fewer mistakes. Program/preview operation is best for training students for a career in broadcast!\n\nMonitor Sources and Status with Multiview!\n\nWhen doing larger live productions with multiple cameras, it’s very useful to see all your video sources at the same time on a single monitor. All ATEM Mini models include a professional multiview that lets you see all video inputs, preview and program on a single HDMI television or monitor! Simply select M/V on the front panel video output control buttons to select multiview! Each camera view includes tally indicators so you know when each source is on-air, and each view also has custom labels and audio meters. Plus the ATEM Mini Extreme models allow you to select up to 16 custom views! Multiview even allows you to monitor critical statuses for recording, streaming and the audio mixer!\n\nWith a built in Fairlight audio mixer, ATEM Mini makes it possible to do complex live sound mixing. The internal mixer features enough channels for each HDMI input so you can mix audio from all sources! That’s audio from all HDMI sources and the 2 stereo mic inputs. Each input channel features the highest quality 6 band parametric EQ and compressor, limiter, expander and noise gate as well as full panning. You can even set up the software to auto mix between inputs as you switch \"AFV\" or to live mix multiple sources together all at once. All this audio power can be controlled via ATEM Software Control, or you can add a Mackie compatible panel or even a massive Fairlight Audio Console!\n\nThe Ethernet connection also allows customized control solutions! Even though ATEM Mini includes ATEM Software Control, you can use the Ethernet to control the ATEM remotely, anywhere in the world. A popular workflow is to use the Ethernet to allow the ATEM Mini to be positioned near the HDMI cameras, but the control is positioned remotely in a quieter space, such as a control room. Imagine using the switcher from a control room and building a professional broadcasting studio where the control room can be separated away from the performance or interviews. Ethernet allows you to add as many panels as you like all at the same time, or you can build custom solutions using the developer SDK!\n\nThe HDMI program output is perfect for connecting ATEM Mini to an external recorder or monitor! ATEM Mini supports external recorders such as Blackmagic Video Assist. You get a high quality output with switcher program video, plus live audio from the internal audio mixer. The HDMI output can even be connected to video projectors in large venues. If you connect ATEM Software Control you can even ISO record from one of the inputs. Plus you can generate multiple formats by recording from the HDMI program output in a high quality format such as ProRes, while simultaneously using the built-in recording to H.264 video stream on a USB flash disk!\n\nWith Ethernet built in, ATEM Mini can use hardware control panels for high end workflows that take advantage of the hidden broadcast features in the switcher! The ATEM 1 M/E Advanced Panel features the fast program/preview style with separate source buttons for both program and preview rows. Get direct access to all transitions automatically or manually using the t-bar. For accurate control of the DVE the joystick provides X, Y positioning with rotation setting DVE size. You also get LCD menus to control features that don't have dedicated knobs and buttons. You can even program and trigger macros! Plus you can use ATEM 1 M/E Advanced Panel later if you upgrade to a bigger ATEM switcher!\n\nWhen working on live production, it’s critical all cameras are perfectly matched with good color balance for a consistent look as you cut and transition between the different cameras. Go beyond software control by adding an ATEM Camera Control Panel to control all 4 cameras connected to your ATEM Mini! Each camera controller includes a large LCD screen with soft buttons and knobs and a full set of professional controls for live camera adjustments, so you get a very clear indication of camera parameters. The large joystick allows direct adjustment of iris and rotates to set black level. There's even red, green and blue knobs for fine control of camera color tint!\n\nATEM 1 M/E Advanced Panel 10\n\nThis model features a single M/E row with 10 input buttons and 1 system control LCD screen with user customizable colors and label LCDs. There's also a joystick for the DVE and T-bar fader.\n\n$3,079"
