        "text": "Your employer should report the injury as soon as possible, but no later than seven (7) days after their knowledge. The insurance company must send you an informational brochure within three (3) days after receiving notice from your employer. The brochure will explain your rights and responsibilities, as well as provide additional information about the workers' compensation law. A copy of the brochure can be viewed on this website under “Publications”.\n\nReference: Section 440.185, Florida Statutes\n\nIn most cases, your benefit check, which is paid bi-weekly, will be 66 2/3 percent of your average weekly wage. If you were injured before October 1, 2003, this amount is calculated by using wages earned during the 91-day period immediately preceding the date of your injury, not to exceed the state limit. If you worked less than 90% of the 91 day period, the wages of a similar employee in the same employment who has worked the whole of the 91-day period or your full-time weekly wage may be used. If you were injured on or after October 1, 2003 , your average weekly wage is calculated using wages earned 13 weeks prior to your injury, not counting the week in which you were injured.\n\nIn addition, if you worked less than 75% of the 13 week period, a similar employee in the same employment who has worked 75% of the 13-week period or your full time weekly wage shall be used.\n\nReference: Section 440.02(28) & 440.14, Florida Statutes\n\nIt is your decision whether or not to hire an attorney. However, the EAO can assist you and attempt to resolve the dispute. If unable to resolve, the EAO can further assist you in completing and filing a Petition for Benefits. This service is provided at no cost to you. For assistance call: (800) 342-1741 or e-mail wceao@myfloridacfo.com. For the location of the nearest EAO, see District Offices.\n\nReference: Section 440.191 & 440.192, Florida Statutes\n\nIf you were injured on or after January 1, 1994 , the claim is closed one (1) year from the date of your last medical treatment or payment of compensation. This period of time is referred to as the Statute of Limitations. If you were injured before January 1, 1994 , the period is two (2) years.\n\nReference: Section 440.19(2), Florida Statutes\n\nNo. -- The “personal information” in s. 119.071 (4)(d), F.S. is defined as your address, telephone number, photograph, and social security number. Although photographs are not collected by our office, your social security number will always be redacted from any public record request pursuant to s. 119.071 (5) 5., F.S.. However, s. 119.071 (4) (d) 2., F.S., requires you or your employer to formally write to the custodial agency that is in possession of your personal information in order to claim the exempt status. Our office accepts emails, faxes or written correspondence when claiming the personal information exempt status. You must provide your occupation (title or description), name of employer, and date of injury associated with any Florida workers’ compensation claim you filed, if applicable. You must also provide your date of birth and the last 4 digits ONLY of your social security number in order for us to establish accurate confidential record information. To request exemption of personal information maintained by our Division, you should email, fax or write to the following:\n\nDivision of Workers' Compensation\n\nATTN: Records Privacy Section\n\n200 E. Gaines Street\n\nTallahassee, FL 32399-4226\n\ndwcrecordsprivacy@myfloridacfo.com\n\nFax: 850-488-3453\n\nRecords Privacy Forms are located under Records"
