        "text": "In detail\n\nDoes the data ‘relate to’ an identifiable data subject?\n\nIs the content about an individual?\n\nDoes the purpose of the processing make information personal data?\n\nDoes the data impact, or have the potential to impact, on an individual?\n\nIs data that refers to an identifiable individual, but does not relate to them, personal data?\n\nIs inaccurate information about an individual still personal data?\n\nDoes the data ‘relate to’ an identifiable data subject?\n\nIt will often be clear where data ‘relates to’ a particular individual. However, sometimes this is not so clear and it may be helpful to consider in more detail what ’relates to’ means.\n\nData which identifies an individual, even without a name associated with it, may be personal data if you are processing it to learn or record something about that individual, or where the processing has an impact on that individual. Therefore, data may ‘relate to’ an individual in several different ways, the most common of which are considered in this section.\n\nIs the content about an individual?\n\nInformation may be obviously about a particular individual or about their activities. This information is personal data regardless of the purpose for which you are processing the data.\n\nIn many cases data may be personal data simply because its content is ‘obviously about’ an individual. Alternatively, data may be personal data because it is clearly ‘linked to’ an individual as it is about his or her activities and you are processing it for the purpose of determining or influencing the way in which that individual is treated. Data may also be personal data if it is biographically significant or has a particular individual as the focus.\n\nThere are many examples of data that ‘relates to’ an individual because the content of the information is clearly about that individual. For example:\n\nmedical history;\n\ncriminal record;\n\na record of an individual’s performance at work; or\n\na record of an individual’s sporting achievements.\n\nThere are also many examples of records which will clearly be personal data where the content of the information is about their activities not about the individual themselves. For example:\n\npersonal bank statements; or\n\nitemised telephone bills.\n\nThere will also be many cases where data is not in itself personal data but, in certain circumstances, it will become personal data where it can be linked to an individual to provide particular information about that individual.\n\nDoes the purpose of the processing make information personal data?\n\nIf the data is used, or is likely to be used, to learn, evaluate, treat in a certain way, make a decision about, or influence the status or behaviour of an individual, then it is personal data.\n\nThere are many other examples of data which 'relate to' a particular individual because it is linked to that individual and informs or influences actions or decisions which affect an individual.\n\nFor example, an individual’s data about their phone or electricity account clearly determines what the individual will be charged. However, data about a house is not, by itself, personal data.\n\nContext is important here. Information about a house is often linked to an owner or resident and consequently the data about the house will be personal data about that individual.\n\nDoes the data impact, or have the potential to impact, on an individual?\n\nIf data is occasionally processed to learn something about an individual, even though it was not the controller’s primarily purpose for processing the data, this data will be personal data as the processing does, or is likely to, impact on the individual (see next question, below).\n\nWhen considering data about objects, if the data is processed to provide information about an individual (for example, productivity) then the data is personal data. If the data about objects is not currently processed to provide information about an individual, but could be, then the data is likely to be personal data.\n\nIt depends on whether the processing of the information has or could have a resulting impact upon the individual even though the content of the data is not directly about that individual, nor is there any intention to process the data for the purpose of determining or influencing the way that person is treated.\n\nIs data that refers to an identifiable individual, but does not relate to them, personal data?\n\nData can contain references to an identifiable individual, or be linked to them, but not ‘relate to’ them as it is not about that individual but is about another topic entirely. Depending on the circumstances, this data may or may not be personal data.\n\nIs inaccurate information about an individual still personal data?\n\nIf information seemingly relating to a particular individual is inaccurate (ie it is factually incorrect or it is information about a different individual), the information is still personal data, as it relates to that individual.\n\nIf the information is inaccurate so that no individual can be identified from that information on its own or in conjunction with additional information, then the information is not personal data.\n\nAn opinion relating to an individual is also capable of constituting personal data, irrespective of the accuracy of that opinion."
