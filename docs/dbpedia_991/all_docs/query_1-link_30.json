        "text": "This post originally appeared on Tor.com.\n\nIâve been asked to introduce The Way Of Kings to you. And I have no idea how to start.\n\nThis is an odd position for me. Before, Iâve found it easy to explain my novels. Each one was built around one or two central premises. The gang of thieves who want to rob an immortal emperor. A man cast down by a terrible, magical disease and forced to rebuild a society among those similarly afflicted. A boy who finds that librarians secretly rule the world.\n\nKings has stymied me each time Iâve tried to describe it. I often end up talking about its creation. (How I started work on it over fifteen years ago. How Iâve written hundreds of thousands of words worth of worldbuilding for it. How much the project has come to mean to me over the decades.) But such things describe the book but donât actually tell you anything. And so this time, Iâm going to try to talk about what The Way Of Kings is.\n\nItâs a book about characters I love. Iâve begun to build a reputation as the âmagic systemâ guy. The author who creates interesting types of magic for every book he writes. On one hand, this delights me, as I do put a lot of effort into the magic in my books. But a great book for me isnât about a magic, itâs about the people that the magic affects.\n\nThe book started its life many years ago being about a young man who made a good decision. I wrote the entire book that way before realizing Iâd done it wrong. So I started over from scratch and had him take the other fork, the more difficult fork. The fork that cast him into some of the worst imaginable circumstances, ground him against the stones of a world where there is no soil or sand on the ground.\n\nMy goal: to prove to myself, and to him, that the âgoodâ decision was not actually the best one. The Way Of Kings is his story, though he shares the space with several others. Theyâll get their own books later in the series.\n\nI want to tell you more, but I donât have the space here. I want to talk about the art in the book (itâs ambitious, unlike anything Iâve seen tried in an epic fantasy novel before.) I want to talk about the scope of the series, the distinctive world which is so much larger and more real than anything Iâve worked on before. I want to explain the book.\n\nBut, for now, I think itâs best to just show you instead.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nI long for the days before the Last Desolation.\n\nThe age before the Heralds abandoned us and the Knights Radiant turned against us. A time when there was still magic in the world and honor in the hearts of men.\n\nThe world became ours, and we lost it. Nothing, it appears, is more challenging to the souls of men than victory itself.\n\nOr was that victory an illusion all along? Did our enemies realize that the harder they fought, the stronger we resisted? Perhaps they saw that the heat and the hammer only make for a better grade of sword. But ignore the steel long enough, and it will eventually rust away.\n\nThere are four whom we watch. The first is the surgeon, forced to put aside healing to become a soldier in the most brutal war of our time. The second is the assassin, a murderer who weeps as he kills. The third is the liar, a young woman who wears a scholarâs mantle over the heart of a thief. The last is the highprince, a warlord whose eyes have opened to the past as his thirst for battle wanes.\n\nThe world can change. Surgebinding and Shardwielding can return; the magics of ancient days can become ours again. These four people are key.\n\nOne of them may redeem us.\n\nAnd one of them will destroy us.\n\nWidely acclaimed for his work completing Robert Jordanâs Wheel of Time saga, Brandon Sanderson now begins a grand cycle of his own, one every bit as ambitious and immersive.\n\nRoshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.\n\nIt has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars are fought for them, and won by them.\n\nOne such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.\n\nBrightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by overpowering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.\n\nAcross the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under the eminent scholar and notorious heretic Jasnah Kholin, Dalinarâs niece. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallanâs motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.\n\nThe result of more than ten years of planning, writing, and worldbuilding, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.\n\nSpeak again the ancient oaths,\n\nLife before death.\n\nStrength before weakness.\n\nJourney before destination.\n\nand return to men the Shards they once bore.\n\nThe Knights Radiant must stand again.\n\nThe eagerly awaited sequel to the New York Times bestselling The Way of Kings.\n\nSix years ago, the Assassin in White, a hireling of the inscrutable Parshendi, assassinated the Alethi king on the very night a treaty between men and Parshendi was being celebrated. So began the Vengeance Pact among the highprinces of Alethkar and the War of Reckoning against the Parshendi.\n\nNow the Assassin is active again, murdering rulers all over the world, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassinâs master has much deeper motives.\n\nExpected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status darkeyes. Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.\n\nBrilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and their civilization-ending Desolation. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but even arriving there proves more difficult than she imagined.\n\nMeanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The consequences for Parshendi and humans alikeâindeed, for Roshar itselfâare as dangerous as they are incalculable."
