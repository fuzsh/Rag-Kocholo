If you choose Clear, then the music in your queue is replaced with the music you've selected to play.\n\nShare control of a music queue on Apple TV or HomePod\n\nIf you're at a friend's house or have guests over, you can all add music to the queue on an Apple TV or HomePod. Everyone that wants to add music needs a subscription to Apple Music and an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\n\nConnect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to the same Wi-Fi network as the Apple TV or HomePod.\n\nOn your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, open the Apple Music app.\n\nTap the player at the bottom of the screen.\n\nTap Airplay .\n\nScroll and tap the card for HomePod or Apple TV.
