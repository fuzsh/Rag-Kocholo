        "text": "Eligible construction business owners can apply to have themselves exempted from Tennessee's workersâ€™ compensation requirements. Exempt owners are still required to have insurance coverage for all of their employees, even if they have only one employee. This registry serves as a publicly accessible list of those who have been granted this exemption. Individuals listed in this registry in no way reflects the validity of their license or certification status. A list of business types that are eligible for this registry can be found here.\n\nIf you have received a request for additional information, please send the necessary documentation or corrected information to wc.exemption@tn.gov.
