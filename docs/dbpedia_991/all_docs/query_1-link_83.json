        "text": "The critics must be crazy. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. This time, it’s Star Wars: The Acolyte that has aroused the profoundly odd sensibilities of the professional media class. That and the broken aggregation system that is Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe latest show from the House Of Mouse is fine (at best) but you wouldn’t know it perusing the internet. Behold:\n\nThat’s a wide divide. There are many reasons for it. We’ll get there momentarily. First:\n\nA Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far, Far Away . . .\n\nSeriously, it was a long time ago. 100 years before the rise of the Empire. The Acolyte takes place in the High Republic’s final days, just before the long era of peace and prosperity came crashing down into turmoil and strife—at least partly thanks to the arrogance of the Jedi Order itself. Partly, too, thanks to a mysterious new villain who (we can only hope) turns out to be Darth Plagueis.\n\nIt’s a cool idea for a new Star Wars setting that before now we’ve only seen in games, comics and books. We’ve been stuck in the Skywalker era for so long. Even a show like Andor which has no Jedi and never mentions the Force or Luke Skywalker, still takes place within the years of the Imperial rise and fall. It’s a breath of fresh air to see a Star Wars show actually branch out.\n\nUnfortunately, The Acolyte retains many of the franchise’s worst habits and does next to nothing with the new setting that makes it actually feel new. This could be set two years before the prequel trilogy and nobody would be the wiser.\n\nI wrote a review covering the first two episodes of the show before I’d watched the next two. You can read that right here. It’ll catch you up on the story without too many spoilers. I was tentatively optimistic after two episodes. I’ve become decidedly less so after four. Quite frankly, even if the final four episodes of the season turn out to be fantastic, the first four will hold it back from greatness. And how often does a series get that much better in its second half?\n\nDisney and the show’s creators have billed this series as a “darker” delve into Star Wars. Critics have echoed this sentiment, calling it a show that makes “bold choices.” Inverse says that The Acolyte is “An experimental, galvanizing standalone story that establishes a new caliber of what Star Wars TV can do.” Galvanizing! New caliber!\n\nGosh, we must be watching different shows.\n\nElsewhere we get such quotes as:\n\n“'The Acolyte' presents in its first few episodes, a dashing adventure of mystery, action, impressive fight sequences and a cat and mouse game that keeps you intrigued from one episode to the next.”\n\n“Showrunner Leslye Headland, best known as the co-creator of the Netflix series Russian Doll, breathes new life into the Star Wars universe with The Acolyte.”\n\n“[Leslye] Headland has created one of the best Star Wars series to date making it a character driven revenge story over one relying on copious action scenes, light sabers battles or legacy characters to drive the series.”\n\nAgain, I feel like I’m living in an alternative universe reading these, one in which being a critic no longer requires you to be critical, but rather rewards you for simply liking the Right Things and disliking the Wrong Things. One of these quotes gushes over the “impressive fight sequences” while another says it doesn’t rely on “copious action scenes.” But really, the number of reviews calling this some version of a “compelling mystery” or a “riveting thriller” or “STAR WARS HAS NEVER DONE THIS THING BEFORE’ simply boggles my mind. None of this is even remotely true. I say this as someone who has been mildly entertained by this series so far and will gladly watch the next four episodes. But really, you have to be realistic about these things. The only ground being broken here is in the cemetery where they bury our hopes and dreams.\n\nNothing here, beyond the era, is actually all that new. And very little about it is particularly compelling or well-written. It is, however, very, very diverse and I suspect that this focus on diversity drives a great deal of both the positive critical reception and negative audience reviews. When you commit so utterly to making a social cause the thing that defines your show, you effectively guarantee that it becomes just another shouting match in the never-ending culture wars. As I’ve noted elsewhere, there are better ways to approach this (Andor!)\n\nMany positive critic reviews are . . . less crazy, however. They’re marked Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, but they include phrases such as:\n\n“[The Acolyte] doesn’t really offer anything new to the universe in the way that Andor did, and ultimately feels a bit forced.”\n\n“It’s not amazing, but it’s not terrible.”\n\n“This is not the worst we’ve seen from Star Wars TV, nor is it the best.”\n\nThere are tons of these, and because Rotten Tomatoes is a binary—Rotten or Fresh—there’s no middle-ground upon which they can fall. Another juicy tomato: Many critics don’t even pick whether their review should be regarded as “Fresh” or “Rotten.” They have that option, but Rotten Tomatoes can also just pick that for you instead. I discuss other issues with the review aggregator in the video below:\n\nThe Acolyte Is Bombing With Audiences\n\nAudience scores reflect another extreme. At 39% (as of this writing) the show is decidedly rotten. Is that an accurate representation of actual audience opinions? Are people just mad because The Acolyte is so diverse? The Star Wars reddit doesn’t seem too upset or too thrilled. I get an overall sense of ‘meh’. Maybe not 39% but far, far from 93%.\n\nWhatever you might think on this front, most of the complaints I’ve seen so far don’t focus on the diversity issue, but rather on the stilted dialogue, predictable plotting and so forth. Mostly, longtime Star Wars fans just continue to feel generally deflated by the overall mediocrity and lack of ambition that Disney is bringing to the table. A sampling:\n\n“The show was watchable, which was an improvement over Obi-Wan and the listless Ahsoka but there is no sign of genuine creative ambition in this show and it suffers from the same sense of weightlessness and lack of dramatic sense as Ahsoka. The characters don't grab my interest and I haven't spent two seconds thinking about the plot during or after watching.”\n\n“Ugh. This is as bad as you've heard. Visually, it looks...OK, I guess? The fights are fine but being massively overrated by Disney-friendly media. The rest is a garbage fire. Terrible acting, weird pacing, bargain basement writing, and pointless changes to Star Wars mythology. It just \"feels\" wrong throughout, even compared to other Disney Star Wars”\n\n“Having thus far watched the first 2 episodes the show is just very....eh. Like a lot of folks are saying the score is fantastic & it's probably the highlight. But good sound can't carry a show. Thus far the characters are all a bit bland - I'm hopeful of further character development in the next episode.”\n\nI’ll have more to say about the core, fundamental problems with The Acolyte in a separate post now that I’ve watched the first four episodes, but I have to largely agree with these commenters. It’s just incredibly underwhelming. The critics gushing praise for this series sound out of touch with Star Wars and its fandom (and what makes it tick!) and really out of touch with good writing in general. The Acolyte is just okay. It might get better; it might get worse. Maybe the back half of the season will blow our minds. But right now? The Acolyte is just a deeply bland Star Wars series with some cool fight scenes and a handful of cool characters who I’m afraid will ultimately be wasted, just like the cast of the sequel trilogy.\n\nI’ve written about this before, and I’ll say it again: Relentless mediocrity is what’s killing Star Wars and Marvel and DC and so much of pop culture. The majority of Disney’s Star Wars shows and movies have been watered-down and disappointing affairs that seem to want to capitalize on the property without bothering to understand what makes us love it to begin with. They have just enough redeeming qualities to prevent them from being truly terrible. Mostly, they’re just bland and forgettable and lacking the great charm and heroics that made the original trilogy such an iconic entry in the history of cinema.\n\nWhat a shame. It could have been so much better, so much more. The unlikely existence of Andor proves my point. A diamond in the rough. Or as the Mandalorian would put it: This is the way."
