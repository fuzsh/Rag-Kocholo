        "text": "AWAY GAME v BUCKIE THISTLE FC\n\nBREEDON HIGHLAND LEAGUE\n\nVICTORIA PARK, BUCKIE AB56 1BJ\n\nWEDNESDAY 3 APRIL 2024 – KO 8pm\n\nSo this Wednesday night under the floodlights of Victoria Park we face our first encounter with Buckie Thistle this season. We were to meet in Grantown in October but advice from the Scottish Government regarding inclement weather postponed that fixture and water problems at Viccy Park last month postponed our meeting there – so this is Buckie’s home match and our home date still has to finalised.\n\nBuckie have had a marvellous season so far- last Wednesday’s win against Brechin put them very much back in contention in the title race but a draw on Saturday against Deveronvale, who incidentally we beat a couple of weeks ago may have dented their aspirations so we can expect a very motivated Buckie – although they may be beginning to feel the effects of playing so many games over the past few weeks…… In their ranks are two regulars from the Strathspey area, defender Sam Morrison and forward Josh Peters who will both no doubt do us no favours whatsoever…and rightly so!\n\nSATURDAY’S GAME v NAIRN COUNTY\n\nOur game on Saturday against Nairn County was severely affected by a colossal rain and hale storm which started about thirty minutes before kick off and continued throughout the first half…..the second half was a calm spring afternoon with blue sky…..and a big thank you to all spectators who braved the weather….although we were all duped by the beautiful sunny morning we had in Grantown!!!!\n\nNairn managed the conditions better and were well worthy of their 3-0 lead by half time, but as is the case yet again with the Jags this season, they more or less dominated much of the second half and had four really excellent scoring chances, none of which were converted unfortunately and a very good penalty shout, before Nairn scored again in the dying minutes of the game.\n\nSadly, the weather conditions turned most of the pitch into a quagmire and with that, the obvious damage to the playing surface. With ten days to our next home match we’re hoping that the weather will now be kind and help the pitchfixers in their task of getting the surface back to the condition it was before.\n\nThat’s it sports fans- be back on Friday with the weekend preview….\n\nHOME GAME v NAIRN COUNTY FC\n\nBREEDON HIGHLAND LEAGUE\n\nSEAFIELD PARK, GRANTOWN-ON-SPEY, PH26 3HY\n\nSATURDAY 30 MARCH 2024 – KO 3pm\n\nAnother home game and for this one we welcome, from twenty-two miles down the A939, players, officials and fans of Nairn County FC.\n\nWe last met at Station Park, Nairn way back on a sunny day in September, with if I recall correctly, a very good and encouraging first half performance by the Jags, rather let down by a weak second half – a habit we seemed to have incorporated into most of the season so far, unfortunately. Although we did score a decent goal late on, it was by then far too late, and Nairn ran out winners 4 – 1.\n\nSince then Nairn have had generally a very good season and currently sit in eighth position and competing for a top six place. Player manager Steven MacKay will be hoping for a return to winning ways after last week’s goalless draw at Forres.\n\nBut, after the last couple of weeks the Jags can feel a bit more confident and we would hope that caretaker manager Mike and the boys will put in another excellent performance and perhaps make it three games in a row without loss.\n\nIf any of the Nairn travelling support want to familiarise themselves with what’s on in Grantown – click here for more information.\n\nThere will still be car parking available in the adjacent Golf Club car park but this will be the last game for a while as the golf club’s season opening match takes place the following Saturday ( April 6 ).\n\nLAST SATURDAY v CLACHNACUDDIN\n\nThe Jags won again last Saturday in a hard fought match against Clachnacuddin at Seafield Park to bring our total of league points into double figures, although we still unfortunately sit at the bottom of the table.\n\nA great pass through the right side of the Clach defence, in the thirty-sixth minute by captain James McShane, sent Iain Ross through on goal evading a couple of tackles then scoring what was an excellent goal, chipping the onrushing ‘keeper. It remained that way until Clach were awarded a penalty mid-way through the second half which Connor Bunce converted. Ten minutes from time Daniel Whitehorn collected the ball about twenty yards out, spun and shot into the bottom left corner of the net putting us 2-1 ahead. The defence marshalled again by young Ethan Rae, with another excellent performance in goal, then held out comfortably to enable the Jags to get full points for the second game in a row.\n\nAssisting caretaker manager Mike Rae was Charlie Brown who told the local press that he had never seen the faces around Seafield Park looking so happy…..and he was full of praise again for the work rate, effort and commitment of all the Jags players, and especially pleased for Iain Ross, who last week had travelled from working on Saturday morning in Braemar to Banff in time for for last week’s Deveronvale game, and Daniel Whitehorn, who because of work has not been able to play very regularly but had put in a massive shift on Saturday and was out on his feet when he was substituted soon after scoring – in fact Charlie thought that’s why Daniel shot as he was too tired to run any more with the ball!!!\n\nSpeaking of smiles on faces everyone concerned with the Jags would like to thank all those who turned out to view the game – there was a great atmosphere and it was great to see a lot of local faces supporting the Jags, who hopefully enjoyed the game and by doing so will be back for this Saturday’s match against Nairn, which is winnable.\n\nNEXT MATCH\n\nJust a wee reminder that our next two matches are away from home – on Wednesday we travel to Buckie and on Saturday we visit Turriff, which means our next home game is on April 13 against Fraserburgh…….and with home and aways against both Buckie and the Broch too, not an easy finish to the season!!\n\nLOTTERY\n\nAs ever we conclude this week’s meanderings offering you a jackpot win of £5200 on our online fundraising lottery – click here if you want to play…\n\nLOTTERY CH-CH-CHANGES\n\nAs intimated a couple of weeks ago after the current jackpot, has been won therefore completing that game there will be couple of changes.\n\nThere will still be a weekly prize of £100 for a consolation winner if their entry matches four of the five numbers drawn, however instead of a weekly increase in the jackpot of £100, this will now be increased monthly.\n\nThe game is to forecast 5 winning numbers, which are drawn at random, from 1-20. The 5 numbers chosen are to be marked by a cross (X).\n\nThe Jackpot prize starts at £1,000 and the game continues until it is won and starts afresh. As applicable, the Jackpot increases by £100 immediately after the first draw in each calendar month, up to a maximum of £5,000. The Jackpot is then capped at £5,000 until it is won in a weekly draw.\n\nIf more than one player has 5 winning numbers, the Jackpot will be divided equally among the winning players.\n\nShould no entry forecast all 5 winning numbers, then any player matching 4 numbers will be entered into a draw for a single Consolation Prize of £100.\n\nTHE DRAW will take place every SUNDAY at 7pm unless otherwise advised.\n\nThe entrant named on the ticket must be at least 16 years of age.\n\nAll winners will be notified.\n\nHOME GAME v CLACHNACUDDIN FC\n\nBREEDON HIGHLAND LEAGUE\n\nSEAFIELD PARK, GRANTOWN-ON-SPEY, PH26 3HY\n\nSATURDAY 23 MARCH 2024 – KO 3 pm\n\nThis Saturday we host Clachnacuddin FC in a 3pm kick off Breedon Highland League match at Seafield Park.\n\nIn a week which has been quite turbulent for both teams off the park it’ll be good to get back on the park for a good game o’ fitba.\n\nClachnacuddin club stalwarts chairman Alex Chisholm, and directors Scott Dowling and Chris Forbes resigned after many years of service and we wish them well in their futures away from the hustle and bustle of running a Highland League football club – we will be sorry not to welcome them in an official capacity on Saturday.\n\nThis is the return game of what was an eight goal thriller at Grant Street Park back in November – a game we should have won as we were winning by three goals to nil at half time. I don’t know what the chats were but a different Clach emerged from the dressing room for the second half and fought their way back to level, with what was effectively the last kick of the game making the final score 4 – 4.\n\nAs you can imagine the neutrals and the Clach supporters enjoyed the game far more than the Jags fans so hopefully on Saturday we can repeat our start and manage game second half so we can add another three points to the three we won last week.\n\nWe wish Mike and the boys all the best in what has the makings of a cracking match and hope we can make it two wins in a row.\n\nIf any of the Clach supporters would like a refresher on what is available in Grantown please click here.\n\nThis will be the last Saturday that we will be able to utilise the neighbouring Golf club’s car park before their season starts so please do so if there is no parking available at the Burnfield Car Park approx 200 m from the ground.\n\nStrathspey Thistle would like to thank Grantown-on-Spey Golf Club for their help with parking over the winter months.\n\nLAST SATURDAY’S GAME v DEVERONVALE IN BANFF\n\nAt last we secured three points after an excellent performance winning 3 – 0 against Deveronvale at Princess Royal Park in Banff.\n\nAfter our only league win, so far this season, strangely enough against Deveronvale at Seafield Park in November there was perhaps a mindset that perhaps we could get something from the game.\n\nActing manager Mike Rae and his assistant on Saturday, ex-Jags boss Charlie Brown, were delighted with the team’s efforts and well deserved their win.\n\nAfter we missed a penalty in the fifty-fourth minute, Mike McKenzie scored three minutes later. Owen Loveland doubled our lead in the sixty-second minute and Ross Logan sealed the win in the eighty-ninth. As you can imagine it was all smiles and happiness after the game and hopefully more of the same this Saturday.\n\nPROPOSED MERGER WITH LOCH NESS FC\n\nVarious talks had taken place over the past couple of weeks regarding a possible merger with North Caledonian League team Loch Ness FC but after another committee meeting on Monday night both parties decided against the idea.\n\nLOTTERY\n\nSo, the £5000 jackpot wasn’t won last Sunday so this week we are offering you a jackpot win of £5100 on our online fundraising lottery – click here if you want to play…\n\nLOTTERY CH-CH-CHANGES\n\nAfter the current jackpot has been won therefore completing that game there will be couple of changes.\n\nThere will still be a weekly prize of £100 for a consolation winner if their entry matches four of the five numbers drawn, however instead of a weekly increase in the jackpot of £100, this will now be increased monthly.\n\nThe game is to forecast 5 winning numbers, which are drawn at random, from 1-20. The 5 numbers chosen are to be marked by a cross (X).\n\nThe Jackpot prize starts at £1,000 and the game continues until it is won and starts afresh. As applicable, the Jackpot increases by £100 immediately after the first draw in each calendar month, up to a maximum of £5,000. The Jackpot is then capped at £5,000 until it is won in a weekly draw.\n\nIf more than one player has 5 winning numbers, the Jackpot will be divided equally among the winning players.\n\nShould no entry forecast all 5 winning numbers, then any player matching 4 numbers will be entered into a draw for a single Consolation Prize of £100.\n\nTHE DRAW will take place every SUNDAY at 7pm unless otherwise advised.\n\nThe entrant named on the ticket must be at least 16 years of age.\n\nAll winners will be notified.\n\nSo that’s all sports fans, hopefully, we will see you at Seafield Park next Saturday in a Breedon Highland League match against Nairn County FC kick off 3pm.\n\nAWAY GAME v DEVERONVALE FC\n\nBREEDON HIGHLAND LEAGUE\n\nPRINCESS ROYAL PARK, BANFF AB45 1AZ\n\nSATURDAY 16 MARCH 2024 – KO 3pm\n\nFirstly we can’t go further without letting you participate in this weeks fundraising lottery especially as the jackpot has reached a milestone amount – £5000.\n\nJoin the players in celebrating this…..\n\nPaper tickets for the draw for this week and every other week are available in the following Grantown businesses…..The Wee Shop, Grantown Diner, Ashers Bakery, Claymore Bar, the Ben Mhor Hotel and the Legion in The Square. If you can’t get to these establishments you can go online CLICK HERE and play along… over-sixteens only I’m afraid!\n\nTHIS WEEK AT THE COAST\n\nSo it’s a return to the coast and to the Princess Royal Park in Banff and our return meeting this season with Deveronvale FC.\n\nAs it was our only win of the season so far, I would imagine The Vale will be out to reverse that and by doing so keep all three points in Banff.\n\nAlthough only two places above us in the league sitting in sixteenth place, Deveronvale have accumulated nineteen points by having won four games and drawing seven and as both teams try to recover from heavy defeats this week a hard fought match is very much in store and we wish Mike Rae and his boys all the best.\n\nWEDNESDAY NIGHT’S GAME v WICK ACADEMY\n\nAgain, it was a game of two halves – After a very very poor first half performance we found ourselves four-nil down at the break. Again a mention must be made of young Ethan Rae in goal with some excellent saves – one in particular, tipping the ball over the bar from a shot from about twenty yards out in what was definitely goal bound. In the second half we improved and despite Owen Loveland converting a penalty in the sixty-third minute we lost a further two goals making the final score 6-1 to Wick…not a good day at the office!!\n\nMaybe playing three games in seven days took its toll…..\n\nAfter Saturday’s game we have no game midweek and look forward to next Saturday’s visit to Seafield Park from Clachnacuddin and please remember we will be back to a 3pm kick off.\n\nLOTTERY\n\nAs ever we conclude this week’s meanderings offering you a jackpot win of £5000 on our online fundraising lottery – click here if you want to play…\n\nLOTTERY CH-CH-CHANGES\n\nAs intimated after the current jackpot, has been won therefore completing that game there will be couple of changes.\n\nThere will still be a weekly prize of £100 for a consolation winner if their entry matches four of the five numbers drawn, however instead of a weekly increase in the jackpot of £100, this will now be increased monthly.\n\nThe game is to forecast 5 winning numbers, which are drawn at random, from 1-20.

Hopefully on Wednesday night the wind will be a lot more benign and not influence the game quite so much.\n\nCurrently sitting in fourteenth place and on twenty three points Wick Academy have had some very good results over the past month or so, although they did lose 3-1 to Inverurie last Saturday.\n\nAll Jags fans will be hoping the boys put in the same effort and performance as they did in Saturday’s game against Keith FC.\n\nSATURDAY’S GAME v KEITH\n\nIn a hard fought ninety or so minutes at Seafield Park, Keith finished up 2-1 winners.\n\nThey went ahead after twenty minutes, although we did have one glorious chance to level before half-time.\n\nMike Mckenzie equalised on fifty-eight minutes finishing off a very good move and the game see-sawed after that until the seventy-fourth minute when a high through ball bounced awkwardly over our defence setting up Keith’s Mikey Taylor to lob the ball over the advancing keeper Ethan Rae. Ethan, on loan to the Jags from Ross County until the end of the season, produced another excellent individual performance.\n\nProbably a draw would have been a fair result but no-one could fault any of the Jags for not giving one hundred per cent.\n\nFOCUSSING ON………\n\nThe Club would like to thank Betty and Davie Love for all their help and dedication over the past twenty years or so, Davie as grass cutter and groundsman and Betty (aided and abetted by Davie) for cleaning the dressing rooms, The Shack and the toilet block making them spick and span for the next home game – as well as turning out every home game to support the Jags.\n\nThanks again to you both and we look forward to seeing you both at every home game at Seafield Park!!\n\nReferee Billy Baxter is retiring at the end of the season after twenty five years service to the game.\n\nThe Jags and Keith FC wished to pay tribute to the fact as this was scheduled to be Billy’s last time officiating either club this season.\n\nKeith compiled a double sided list of all the games involving Keith FC over the past twenty-five years officiated by Billy, as well as a bottle from one of Keith’s finest whisky distilleries and The Jags presented him with 30-Year StrathspeyThistle commemorative plaque.\n\nLOTTERY MILESTONE\n\nThis week the jackpot has reached £5000 – and our photographer managed to capture the boys celebrating the milestone figure…..\n\nTickets for the draw for this week and every other week are available in the following Grantown businesses…..The Wee Shop, Grantown Diner, Ashers Bakery, Claymore Bar, the Ben Mhor Hotel and the Legion in The Square. If you can’t get to these establishments you can go online CLICK HERE and play along… over-sixteens only I’m afraid!\n\nDATE FOR YOUR DIARY\n\nWEDNESDAY 3 APRIL AWAY MATCH v BUCKIE THISTLE FC\n\nSee y’all on Friday….\n\nHOME GAME v KEITH FC\n\nBREEDON HIGHLAND LEAGUE\n\nSEAFIELD PARK, GRANTOWN-ON-SPEY, PH26 3HY\n\nSATURDAY 9 MARCH 2024 – KO 2pm\n\nROBERT MACCORMACK\n\nOn Thursday manager Rob MacCormack decided that he wanted to resign from his post with immediate effect. He had intimated to the committee that he would be leaving at the end of the season but had reconsidered and thought it would be more beneficial to both himself and the Club if he did not wait until the season’s end.\n\nAgain, we as a Club would like to reiterate what we said last week and wish Robert all the best for the future and thank him for his dedication and hard work in trying to make this a success, and if all the work Rob put in had been mirrored on the park we would have been a top six club no problem!\n\nAssistant manager Mike Rae will take the reigns for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnd with no real relevance to the above the eagle eyed readers would probably have seen a report, in the on-line edition of The Press & Journal, on Thursday morning accompanying Thursday’s story, on the Strathy on-line page, with regards to talks between Loch Ness FC and ourselves about a possible merger – the STFC Committee will be meeting early next week to further discuss the matter.\n\nSo back onto the park and this Saturday we welcome Keith FC to Seafield Park. Having been beaten by three goals to one back in November at Kynoch Park, we obviously want to balance the points – this time we win all three!\n\nKeith although sitting in fifteenth place have have had a pretty good February results wise, picking up nine points, so it’ll not be easy but hopefully the boys will want to restore some pride after Wednesday night.\n\nIn the last of our winter floodlight saving 2pm kick offs, we look forward to welcoming the Keith fans and if any want a recap in the town’s facilities click here.\n\nWednesday Night v Brora Rangers\n\nAs has been the case all season we play only one half! This was again prevalent in our midweek performance at home to Brora Rangers.\n\nAfter a well fought first half performance but with the usual conceded early and late goal, we went in at half time two nil down and then proceeded to concede eight more in the second half…..the only highlight being an excellent headed goal by the Jags’ Owen Loveland.\n\nFinal Score Thistle 1 – Brora 10.\n\nSTEWART FULTON\n\nPreceeding the game on Wednesday night was a minute’s silence in memory of Stewart Fulton who died last week.\n\nStewart, from Edinburgh, came to prominence in the Planning Office at the Scottish Office and was CEO of the Cairngorm Partnership here in Grantown, the forerunner of the Cairngorms National Park.\n\nStewart was instrumental in his help in gaining Highland League status for Strathspey Thistle and was a regular visitor, along with his good friend Stuart Black to Seafield Park, before returning to Edinburgh three years ago.\n\nStrathspey Thistle Football Club send our condolences to Stewart’s family and friends.\n\nLOTTERY\n\nAs ever we conclude this week’s meanderings offering you a jackpot win of £4900 on our online fundraising lottery – click here if you want to play…\n\nLOTTERY CH-CH-CHANGES\n\nAs intimated a few weeks ago, after the current jackpot has been won which therefore completes that game there will be couple of changes.\n\nThere will still be a weekly prize of £100 for a consolation winner if their entry matches four of the five numbers drawn, however instead of a weekly increase in the jackpot of £100, this will now be increased monthly.\n\nThe game is to forecast 5 winning numbers, which are drawn at random, from 1-20. The 5 numbers chosen are to be marked by a cross (X).\n\nThe Jackpot prize starts at £1,000 and the game continues until it is won and starts afresh. As applicable, the Jackpot increases by £100 immediately after the first draw in each calendar month, up to a maximum of £5,000. The Jackpot is then capped at £5,000 until it is won in a weekly draw.\n\nIf more than one player has 5 winning numbers, the Jackpot will be divided equally among the winning players.\n\nShould no entry forecast all 5 winning numbers, then any player matching 4 numbers will be entered into a draw for a single Consolation Prize of £100.\n\nTHE DRAW will take place every SUNDAY at 7pm unless otherwise advised.\n\nThe entrant named on the ticket must be at least 16 years of age.\n\nAll winners will be notified.\n\nSo that’s all from what’s been a hectic week hopefully we will see you at Seafield Park on Wednesday night when we host Wick Academy FC.\n\nHOME GAME v BRORA RANGERS FC\n\nBREEDON HIGHLAND LEAGUE\n\nSEAFIELD PARK, GRANTOWN-ON-SPEY, PH26 3HY\n\nWEDNESDAY 6 MARCH 2024 – KO 8pm\n\nI think that this will be third time that this game has been scheduled – and so far the weather forecast looks good and hopefully all things weather and fate will align so that the game can eventually go ahead.\n\nThis match is the first of three home games in a row for the Jags so we welcome to Grantown, players, committee and supporters of Brora Rangers on what we hope will be a calm evening under the floodlights at Seafield Park.\n\nBrora who are currently sitting in 9th place in the league but have only played twenty-one games which is five games in hand on the co- leaders Bank’s O’ Dee and three games with Brechin City. I think Brora would have been considering themselves very much title contenders but recent results- two draws and a loss, mean that may not be the case this season but even so, they will come to Seafield Park intent on getting the win.\n\nThe last time we played Brora, back in August at Dudgeon Park, we played very well. Although being two down at half time, we pulled a goal back through Jack Davison but, we lost a very late goal to make the final score 3-1 to the home side…but for a lot of the game we matched or bettered The Cattachs.\n\nAnother effort like that from the boys on Wednesday night and, with a different and more positive result, would give the Jags a fair boost for the remainder of the season. Recent results have not been very kind to us and it would be great to get something out of the game.\n\nIf any of the Brora supporters returning to Grantown need any reminder of what’s here or maybe it’s your first visit, click here for more information.\n\nLAST SATURDAY’S GAME v BUCKIE THISTLE.\n\nUnfortunately like many this season we had another postponed game – after a late morning pitch inspection the decision was made that the ground was waterlogged – a scenario that has been quite common this season unfortunately at Victoria Park, as there seems to be an underground burst pipe or similar – no-one seems to quite know where the water is coming from and with that problem along with heavy overnight rain there could be no other outcome other than postponement. Buckie have been playing some home games at Lossiemouth but had managed to host Clachnacuddin the previous week.\n\nPITCH FIXING\n\nAs already mentioned this is the first of three home games in a row, so that means on the following mornings The Merry Forkers will be down at Seafield Park on Thursday 7, Tuesday 12 and Thursday 14 March at about 10am preparing the pitch for the next game – all you need is a fork and a pair of wellies…..if it’s wet…. and a couple of hours of your time – it would be very much appreciated.\n\nAWAY GAME v BUCKIE THISTLE FC\n\nBREEDON HIGHLAND LEAGUE\n\nVICTORIA PARK, BUCKIE AB56 1BJ\n\nSATURDAY 2 MARCH 2024 – KO 3pm\n\nROBERT MACCORMACK\n\nMaking the headlines on the back pages this week was manager Robert MacCormack’s decision to step down as manager next season. He stated in an interview in Wednesday’s Press & Journal saying that primarily the task ahead of building a new squad for next season over the summer was something that he was unable to dedicate one hundred per cent of his time to as he wanted to spend more time with his family, something he has had to sacrifice this year and now had even more admiration for Highland League managers for all the time and effort they give their clubs.\n\nHe was very appreciative to the Jags for giving him the opportunity of managing a Highland League club, and we as a club have appreciated the amount of dedication Rob has put in since his appointment from Alness United just over a year ago, and although we are disappointed the committee fully understand his decision. He also intimated that if a new manager is appointed before the end of the season he is quite willing to step aside.\n\nWe wish him all the best for the future and he will always be welcome at Seafield Park especially after his comments in his interview with Niall Harkiss in the local paper – The Strathy – click here\n\nIt is plain for all to see that in our current league position the great amount of work Rob would have had to do behind the scenes to put together a different squad for next year, as many of the current player’s contracts finish at the end of this season.\n\nThere is also a possibility we may not be in the Highland League.\n\nCurrently the only club with the correct credentials are Lochee Utd from Dundee,who sit second in the Scottish Midland League but their chances of winning it took a backward step on Wednesday night when current league leaders Broughty Athletic beat them 3-0. As a result of this win Broughty went fourteen points ahead with nine games to go – albeit Lochee have three games in hand but have to play Broughty away, so The Jags are keeping a close watch on the proceedings in the Dundee area…..\n\nAlso on the subject of the future of Strathspey Thistle there have seemingly been rumours going about about our future demise – at our monthly meeting the other night nothing could be further from the truth, and although disappointed with Rob’s decision we must carry on….and I would say that off the field we are as strong as we have been for a long time ….so as Mark Twain said “ reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated” …..\n\nBUCKIE THISTLE – 2 MARCH 2024\n\nSo this week we face the onerous task of heading to Victoria Park for our first encounter with Buckie Thistle this season. We were to meet in Grantown in October but advice from the Scottish Government regarding inclement weather postponed that fixture.\n\nBuckie have had a marvellous season so far- apart from last Saturday’s defeat at home to Clach – and are currently sitting in third place in the league on fifty-two points trailing the leaders Brechin City by seven points but with three games in hand they are very much in contention of winning the league.\n\nSo it will be a very tough afternoon on Saturday – hopefully Buckie will be feeling the effects of playing so many games over the past few weeks……which included their trip to Parkhead where they played Celtic live on television in a Scottish Cup tie and did the Highland League proud. In their ranks are two regulars from the Strathspey area, defender Sam Morrison and goal scorer supreme Josh Peters who will both no doubt do us no favours whatsoever…and rightly so!\n\nCurrently we will arrive at Victoria Park with a depleted squad mainly due to injuries…..but as we always say in the words of the great Greavsie….”It’s a funny old game, Saint”……you never know…..\n\nLAST SATURDAY IN HUNTLY\n\nThe least said about our first half’s performance the better as we went in to the half-time break trailing by six goals to nil. There was a slight resurgence in the second half only conceding one more goal and finishing the game with a seven nil defeat.\n\nA major concern to us all was losing Ross Logan early in the first half with a head injury and after going to Dr Gray’s Hospital in Elgin he was sent to Aberdeen for surgery to an eye injury – all our best wishes go to him in recovering from what must be a very uncomfortable injury.\n\nDATES FOR YOUR DIARY\n\nConfirmed dates from the Highland League are the following rearranged fixtures with three home games as follows.\n\nWednesday March 6 v Brora Rangers KO 20.00hrs\n\nWednesday March 13 v Wick Academy KO 20.00hrs\n\nSaturday March 30 v Nairn County KO 3pm\n\nPITCH SIDE ADVERTISING\n\nWe have created a page on the website thanking the companies who have this year taken the opportunity of pitch side advertising boards – to view the page click here\n\nLOTTERY\n\nAs ever we conclude this week’s meanderings offering you a jackpot win of £4800 on our online fundraising lottery – click here if you want to play…\n\nLOTTERY CH-CH-CHANGES\n\nAs intimated a couple of weeks ago after the current jackpot, has been won therefore completing that game there will be couple of changes.\n\nThere will still be a weekly prize of £100 for a consolation winner if their entry matches four of the five numbers drawn, however instead of a weekly increase in the jackpot of £100, this will now be increased monthly.\n\nThe game is to forecast 5 winning numbers, which are drawn at random, from 1-20.
