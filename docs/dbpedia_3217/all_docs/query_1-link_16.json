        "text": "Dundee Football Club is proud of its history that has developed ever since it became the first professional football club founded in the city in 1893. That history has not been achieved by time but by the achievements, star quality and inspirational characteristics of the players and management who have served our great Club.\n\nIn 2008 the Directors of the Club decided to mark the achievements of these legendary figures and a Committee was set up decide the criteria for the Hall of Fame. The public were asked to vote for their favourites through the official matchday programme, website and local newspapers and the idea sparked great debate amongst the Dark Blue support. After hundreds of votes were cast, a total of eight legendary players were inducted in the inaugural Dundee Football Club Hall of Fame on Friday 3rd April 2009\n\nInductees\n\nWILLIAM “PLUM” LONGAIR – 2009 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nThe first Inductee into the Hall of Fame was William “Plum” Longair who served the club for 33 years, captaining the side in its first ever match in 1893 against Rangers at West Craigie Park. He went on to make over 100 appearances and brought international recognition to Dundee by becoming its first ever-international player when capped against Wales in 1894. After his retirement from playing he helped train the team, including the Scottish Cup winners of 1910 and in over 20 years of coaching he never missed a game.\n\nOn his death in 1926 an estimated 20,000 people lined the streets as his coffin was taken from his home in Victoria Street to Eastern Cemetery to honour one of the greatest footballing figures in the early development of football in the city.\n\nDOUG COWIE – 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nThe next entry into the Hall of Fame was Doug Cowie who played 446 games for the club in a 16-year spell; a club record. The highlight of his career came when Dundee won the League Cup in successive seasons against Rangers and Kilmarnock in 1951 and 1952. The winner’s medals were overdue after Dundee and Doug sadly lost the League title on the last day of the 1948/49 season.\n\nPlaying at either wing-half or centre-half made no difference to Doug, his skill and elegance on the ball was always on show. Even the bullish Billy Steel admitted that his half back could “play a wee bit”.\n\nIn 1953 Doug made his international debut alongside Billy as Scotland drew 2-2 against England at Wembley. It was the first of 20 full caps for the national side and all gained whilst playing for Dundee. He is the only Dundee player to represent his country in two World Cup Finals.\n\nCLAUDIO CANIGGIA – 2009 INTERNATIONAL AWARD\n\nThe first ever International Award was given to Claudio Caniggia whose arrival in the City of Discovery in many ways mirrored that of Billy Steel fifty years previously. Both arrivals stunned the Scottish football scene and brought massive media attention and while both arrived with a reputation as controversial characters, they were quickly taken to the hearts of a Dens public who recognised their undoubted ability.Caniggia was aged 33 in September 2000 and hadn’t played for months but from the moment he took to the field for his debut as a substitute at Pittodrie there was no doubt that he was still the real deal. His last minute goal was pure theatre and 3,000 Dark Blue fans headed south from the Granite City that evening ready to tell anyone who hadn’t been lucky enough to make the trip “I was there when Claudio played for Dundee for the first time.”In the weeks and months that followed it was unusual to see a replica top with anything other than ‘Caniggia 33’ on the back as ‘The Tayzurri’ revelled in the Argentinean’s presence on Tayside – and on the field the darting runs of a man who still had phenomenal acceleration over short distances lit up a season when entertainment almost seemed more important than results. It was a brief stay on Tayside but full of so many fond memories for Dundee supporters.\n\nBARRY SMITH – 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nCaniggia’s captain Barry Smith was next into the Hall of Fame. Few would have imagined that when Barry arrived at Dens in 1995 as part of the deal which saw Morton Wieghorst move to Celtic, that the club would be welcoming a man who would go on to be one of the finest captains in the clubs history. Barry’s time at Dens spanned over 11 years and as captain led the club to the First Division Championship, a Scottish Cup Final and the club’s return to Europe after a 27 year absence.Dundee spent seven seasons in the SPL with Barry as captain, in the first year the side finished 5th under the management of Jocky Scott. The next few seasons saw Barry as the Scottish heart in Ivano Bonetti’s continental Dees before Jim Duffy took over and led the club to the Scottish Cup Final. His legendary status was further enhanced on how he captained the side through the pain of Administration in November 2003 before going on to taste success winning the Icelandic league with FC Valur. In late 2008, Barry was welcomed back to Dens as part of Jocky Scott’s backroom staff. Taking charge of the under 19’s he was given the chance to join Brechin on loan to continue playing until the club came calling again in October 2009 and asked him to take up the position of caretaker-manager when the club fell into Administration for a second time. The heroic efforts in overcoming a draconian 25-point penalty from the Scottish Football League to avoid relegation had many wondering if he could be voted into the Hall of Fame for a second time.\n\nBILLY STEEL – 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nIn September 1950 the next entrant of the Dundee Hall of Fame had developed into one of the first football superstars with 17 Scottish caps to his name and since his wonder goal for Great Britain against the Rest of the World in 1947, he was regarded as one of the best inside forwards in the world. George Anderson wanted the best for Dundee and in Billy Steel there was no finer inside forward so when an initial approach was rejected he re-doubled his efforts and offered a new record British transfer fee of £23,500.\n\nBilly’s outstanding ability gave him a confidence, often seen as arrogance, however a year after his arrival Dundee beat Rangers to win the League Cup with Billy setting up Alfie Boyd for the winning goal. Success bred more success and the following year Dundee became the first club to retain the League Cup by beating Kilmarnock in the final.\n\nBilly Steel played a total of 131 games for the club scoring 45 goals and also gained a further 13 Scotland caps during his Dens career, playing alongside Doug Cowie in two Internationals against England and Sweden. In over 40 years involvement in local football Tommy Gallagher regarded Billy Steel as the best player ever to play for Dundee and many who were lucky to watch him would agree.\n\nJOCKY SCOTT – 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nJocky Scott’s place in the Club’s Hall of Fame was never in doubt after a 45-year connection with the Club after arriving as a 16 year old in 1964 and made his debut in a 6-0 win over Motherwell at Dens. Two weeks later he scored the first of his many career goals for The Dee with his double putting Dundee on the way to a 4-1 derby win at Tannadice.The creative part of his game was as important as the goals he scored and a succession of Dens strikers would testify to the service supplied by the keen football brain of Scott and he was part of the Dundee that beat Celtic on a rain swept day in 1973 to win the League Cup Final at Hampden and bring the cup back to Tayside for the third time. The run to the Scottish Cup semi-final in the same season saw Dundee regarded as the best in the country at the time. Jocky returned to Dens as a player in 1980 playing five more first team games but it was as a coach that his future would map out. He progressed to assistant-manager at Dens under Archie Knox and took over the hot seat when Knox returned to Aberdeen. It was the first of three spells in charge at Dens.\n\nALAN GILZEAN – 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nThere have been some great forwards in Dundee’s history but none have had a strike rate to match Alan Gilzean, the Coupar Angus born hit-man delivering 169 goals in 190 top-flight competitive appearances in the club’s colours.\n\nHe holds almost every club goalscoring record – most career goals, most goals in a season, European top scorer, most hat-tricks and shares the honour of scoring most goals in a game when he netted an incredible seven goals against Queen of the South in December 1962. That season Gillie’s fame spread throughout the Continent as Dundee progressed to the European Cup semi-final, beating Cologne, Sporting Lisbon and Anderlecht on the way.\n\nAmazingly the following season he surpassed his impressive scoring rate with 52 goals in 48 games and a winner for Scotland against England in April 1964. A month later he scored twice as Scotland drew 2-2 with West Germany in Hanover and by now it was obvious that English clubs would come calling for his talents. In December 1964 he moved to Tottenham Hotspur but not before signing off in style with a hat-trick against St Johnstone.\n\nBOBBY COX – 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nThe inaugural Hall of Fame Dinner came to a fitting close with the final Legends Award going to whom Dundee supporters simply called Mr Dundee – Bobby Cox.\n\nHe was born overlooking Dens Park and was educated at nearby SS Peter and Paul then St. Johns,signing for Dundee in 1955 and a year later after only four reserve games he was given his debut at home to Queens Park. The story of a Legend had begun.\n\nBobby was an almost ever present in the side for the next decade only missing out for injuries to his cartilage and slipped disc. He was given the honour of taking over the club captaincy from Doug Cowie and thus leading the club into its finest hour at Muirton Park on 28th April 1962.\n\nThat League championship brought qualification to the European Cup and Bobby led the team on the brilliant aggregate defeats of Cologne, Sporting Lisbon and Anderlecht. Injury against Motherwell ruled him out against AC Milan in the semi-final and robbed Dundee of one of its most influential players. Bobby would experience further European ties in the European Cup Winners Cup and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.\n\nIn 1964 he captained the team in the Scottish Cup Final on 25th April 1964 against Rangers, their last appearance at that stage of the tournament for 39 years.\n\nBobby retired in 1969 after 14 years with club but the association would not stop there for this one club man and through his hosting of the hospitality lounges at Dens he gave the club a loyal service for over 50 years.\n\nBOB SHANKLY – 2010 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nThe second recipient of the Heritage Award was Bob Shankly, manager of what many regard as the greatest team in the club’s history.\n\nHe managed Dundee to their one (and only) League Championship in 1962 then into the European Cup beating the famous names of Cologne, Sporting Lisbon and Anderlecht before falling at the semi-final stage against Italian giants AC Milan. His free scoring side reached the Scottish Cup final in 1964 during a season in which they scored an incredible 141 goals.\n\nShankly once recalled what he looked for in a player “I look for character. I want lads with guts and go, who won’t crumple when things don’t go their way.” No one could argue with his philosophy or how he moulded his team into winners. He let his players express themselves but earned their utmost respect and they rewarded him with the greatest days in the club’s history.\n\nGIORGI NEMSADZE – 2010 INTERNATIONAL AWARD\n\nThe International Award went to Giorgi Nemsadze, a player who had a nomadic existence in Europe before arriving at Dens in 2000. His ability was without question as he had almost 50 caps for his country but as part of the Tayzurri he had his longest stay at any club in his career and that stability brought the best out of him.\n\nThe man with the dancing feet brought joy to the terraces at Dens. He could command a match from the centre of midfield and when he scored they were memorable.\n\nIn November 2000 at Tannadice he linked with Barry Smith and Claudio Caniggia before chipping united keeper Alan Combe. A goal that sent 5,000 Dundee supporters into ecstatic celebration. His goal against Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2003 gave the club their first Scottish Cup final appearance in 39 years. That was a mark of a Dundee Legend – he always brought joy to Dundee supporters when they watched him. One reporter even commented on his play at Dundee: “The Georgian’s close control was such that one wondered if he had wiped his boots with glue rather than polish”.\n\nGORDON WALLACE – 2010 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nAsk any Dundee supporter who Gordon Wallace is and you will get the reply: “He’s the man who scored the winner in Dundee’s League Cup victory over Celtic in December 1973!” And so he did, chesting down a Bobby Wilson free-kick with his back to the goal, turning and, almost all in the one movement, firing the ball past the desperately diving Ally Hunter for one of the best goals ever seen in a Hampden Cup Final.\n\nBorn and bred in the city, Gordon watched Billy Steel make his debut at Dens in 1950 and overcome the setback of being released by Dundee in his early career to make his way into the club’s Hall of Fame.\n\nIn a career laden with goals his 265 League goals was a Scottish record for over 20 years until broken by Ally McCoist. In 1968 he broke an Old Firm monopoly and was awarded the Scottish Writers Player of the Year for almost single-handedly keeping Raith Rovers in Division One with his goals.\n\nHe managed the club in 1989 and won the Scottish League Centenary Cup the following year.\n\nALEX HAMILTON – 2010 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nAlex Hamilton was one of the Scottish game’s great characters both on and off the pitch. Crew cut hairstyle, driving a white jaguar and forming a pop band Hammy and the Hamsters was all show.\n\nSo was his football. Pace, self-confidence and the ability to sell dummies like a salesman in a tailor’s shop made him one of the first overlapping full-backs in the country. He would very soon become the best in the country with 24 full Scottish International caps to prove it. At his peak in 1964, declared himself, Mohammed Ali-style, to be “The Greatest” right-back in Europe – a claim not without foundation as that very year he appeared for the Rest of Europe against Scandinavia.\n\nHe formed a formidable full back partnership with lifelong friend Bobby Cox and in 1961-62 Hammy was an ever present in the side that won the Scottish League Championship as he was the following season in the European Cup campaign that saw the Dark Blues reach the semi-final.\n\nAlex made 359 appearances for Dundee in ten seasons, won a club record 24 International caps, 2 International Trial Appearances, 8 Scottish League Caps and most importantly that League Championship medal.\n\nJIM DUFFY – 2010 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nIn 2009 Jim Duffy hosted the first Dundee Hall of Fame Dinner but twelve months later he was himself inducted into the legends of the club for his tremendous service in his various roles as player, coach, assistant-manager and manager in his four spells with the club.\n\nHe was a tremendous centre-half for Dundee and a rock in a Dark Blue jersey and a solid inspiration not just to the fans but also to all around him. Only the wealth of talent in the Scottish defence at the time prevented him from gaining any full international caps. His playing career was cruelly curtailed when a knee injury forced him to give up the game in 1987, just as Dundee looked to be challenging again for honours. Fellow Dundee Legend Gordon Wallace declared upon resuming his playing career in 1989 that if he had retuned earlier the team would not have been relegated.\n\nJim has had two spells as manager at Dens. In his first spell as manager, he led Dundee to the League Cup Final and then to the semi final the following season, a tremendous feat for a First Division side. His second spell at the helm saw him lead Dundee to their first Scottish Cup final since the days of Bob Shankly, capture a top six finish with a fourteen match unbeaten run and lead Dundee into Europe for the first time in twenty-nine years.\n\nTOMMY GALLACHER – 2011 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nTommy Gallacher was inducted into the Hall of Fame with the Heritage Award to mark not only his cultured playing days in the late 1940’s and early 1950’s but for his work in the local newspaper industry.\n\nHis senior career started with Queens Park as his legendary father, Patsy Gallacher, was determined none of his sons would follow him and play for Celtic. After World War II this peerless half-back was in demand and could have signed for Wolves, St Mirren or Aberdeen but chose Dundee. That coincided with one of the greatest eras in the club’s history and the backbone of the legendary Dundee team was Tommy Gallacher, Doug Cowie and Alfie Boyd. It is a half-back line still recited to this day by older Dundee fans. He won the Scottish League Cup in 1951 but the honours list could have been so much longer as that Dundee team missed out on the League Championship on the last day of the 1948/49 season and a Scottish Cup final to Motherwell in 1952.\n\nHis impact on Dundee was not just as part of one of the greatest sides in the club’s history but after his retirement in 1956, he became one of the most respected journalists in the country. During the next 30 years his words became the staple diet of the city’s football support before the internet and wall-to-wall television coverage.\n\nPAT LINEY – 2011 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nPat Liney, the club’s Honorary President became the first ever goalkeeper inducted into the Hall of Fame. In his time at Dens he had the task of replacing one of the country’s best ever keepers in Bill Brown – a task he accomplished in style being a member of that elite team who won the Scottish League Championship in 1962.\n\nHe is perhaps most remembered by Dundee’s supporters for a crucial penalty save in the penultimate game of the Championship season at home to St Mirren. With only twelve minutes left and Dundee 1-0 up disaster struck when the referee awarded St. Mirren a penalty and Dundee’s chances of winning the League Flag looked like they were over. That is until the keeper parried the spot kick and Dundee went up the park to score again. As they left the pitch the players heard of Rangers’ defeat at Aberdeen and the title was almost there.\n\nFellow Championship team member Bobby Wishart remembers this Legend as someone who fancied himself as a bit of a crooner. At the 40th Anniversary Championship Dinner in 2002 at the Hilton Hotel, he grabbed the microphone and led the assembled Dees in a chorus of, ‘Hail, Hail, The Dees are Here.’ Legends are made of such stuff!\n\nIAN URE – 2011 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nAnother rock of the Dundee League winning defence was next up to receive his Legends award. Things could have been so different for this Dundee FC hero and bedrock of Dundee’s title winning defence had he followed his first love of rugby and gave in to the early doubts he harboured about his footballing ability.\n\nIan Ure turned his back on his first love, rugby to join Dundee in 1958 and learnt his trade from another Dundee Great, Doug Cowie. In season 1961/62, Dundee become Scottish League Champions and this colossus was an ever present making the number five jersey his own for both club and country. He made the first of eleven international appearances for Scotland, eight of which he won at Dens, in November 1961 against Wales and just three days later was part of the Dundee side which recorded the club’s greatest ever league result, a 5-1 victory over Rangers at Ibrox.\n\nIn December 1962, his superb performances at both home and in the European Cup, saw him presented with the Scottish Footballer of the Year Award, the only Dundee player to win such an accolade. Four months later as he starred in Scotland’s 2-1 win over England at Wembley the B.B.C. commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme described him as ‘the greatest centre half in the world today’\n\nIt took a then world record fee for a defender of £62,500 to take him away to Arsenal but the memories live long in the minds of the Dundee support.\n\nALAN COUSIN – 2011 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nThroughout his playing career Alan Cousin became a Dundee Legend whilst remaining part-time as he chose to combine his early senior career with a St. Andrews’ University degree course.\n\nSporting mainly the number nine shirt, the striker proved the perfect foil for fellow front man Alan Gilzean and between them proved to be a very effective partnership that shot Dundee not only to the League title but also to the European Cup semis and Scottish Cup Final in subsequent years.\n\nIn over a decade at Dens, he played 384 games putting him comfortably in the top ten of most appearances for The Dee. He sits fourth in Dundee’s all time scorer list with a terrific 141 goals. This loyalty to the club was achieved despite approaches from several clubs when he was widely acclaimed as one of the top forwards in the country.\n\nHe became known as ‘the King of the Double Shuffle’ with a unique scissors movement that seemed to propel him away from opponents in an instant and he regularly mesmerised teams at both home and abroad.\n\nANDY PENMAN – 2011 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nWhen you enter through the main reception at Dens Park, you are greeted with a picture with the simple caption ‘The Penalty King’ and inside the frame is a photo of a boy genius of Dundee, Andy Penman, who made his debut at the tender age of fifteen making him the club’s youngest player, won a Championship medal aged just nineteen after scoring the goal which clinched the title.\n\nHe was a wonderful midfield player and contributed a terrific 141 goals as one of only ten players to hit over a century for Dundee and is the club’s fifth top scorer of all time. A dead ball expert, his forte was from the penalty spot where he rarely missed, scoring twenty-five of them in eight years at Dens. He had startling vision and was a fine passer of the ball who could clip balls precisely through, round and over defences to give his forwards clear, unhindered runs at goal. He was a genius, a child prodigy in the art of football.\n\nSadly, Andy died in 1994, aged just fifty-one but his legacy lives on at Dens Park. Not only are you greeted by Andy’s image when you enter the main door but there is also a hospitality lounge that bears his name showing that ‘Boy Kings’ never grow up and they never die, at least not in the memories of those who were lucky enough to witness the skills and genius of Andy Penman.\n\nTOMMY COYNE – 2011 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nTommy Coyne’s first spell at Dens was short – barely lasting two years – but it was certainly illustrious, earning him legendary status in the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe formed a prolific partnership with Keith Wright that produced a goals-to-game ratio barely matched in Dundee’s history. The Cobra and The Mongoose terrorised opposition defences and by the end of their first season, the magnificent attacking football had seen the side score a remarkable 100 goals in all competitions with this legend netting 15 at a strike rate of one goal in less than every two games.\n\nThe Cobra would start his second season in the same way and in September Dundee got revenge for a Scottish Cup semi-final five months earlier when they defeated Dundee United in a pulsating League Cup quarter-final at Dens in front of a capacity 19,724 crowd.\n\nIn November Coyne inflicted more misery on The Arabs when he scored a brace in a 3-1 Derby win at Tannadice as the Dundee fans taunted their rivals by thanking them for giving them their former striker. In his time at Dens he would be a thorn in United’s side scoring five goals, playing in three wins and five draws.\n\nBy the turn of the year he had netted his 30th goal, a magnificent achievement that put him in the running for the U.E.F.A. Golden Boot for Europe’s top league scorer. Ultimately however, Tommy would score thirty-three league goals to finish third and win the Bronze Boot: compensated by going into the record books as the Premier League’s top scorer. In February 1989 he left for Celtic Park, leaving a legacy of 60 goals in only 109 games but would return again in 1999 for a second spell where he helped Dundee to fifth in the SPL – their joining highest league placing since being Champions of Scotland in 1962.\n\n2012 AWARDS\n\nIn 2012 the club integrated the Hall of Fame event with the 50th Anniversary of its League Championship win in 1962 with a dinner held in the Caird Hall attended by around 700 supporters desperate to recognise the greatest achievement ever by a Dundee team.\n\nIn a marvellous evening of nostalgia, the remaining players from the core of 11 who won the League Championship were inducted into the Hall of Fame with Legends Awards. Bobby Seith, Bobby Wishart and Gordon Smith had all won League titles before they arrived at Dundee and their experience was vital in nurturing the youthful talent abundant at Dens. That talent included winger Hugh Robertson who fittingly was the last name on the team sheet at No. 11 and became the last of the League Legends into the Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the year of Dundee’s 120th anniversary, a further five Legends were inducted at the club’s fifth Hall of Fame dinner at the Invercarse Hotel on Friday 29th March 2013.\n\nHUGH ROBERTSON – 2012 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nHugh Robertson was wonderfully tricky left-winger in his 292 appearances for Dundee and as well as being a key supply line for Dundee’s forwards, contributed 61 goals in his eight years a Dens. A coal miner before joining The Dee from Auchinleck Talbot in 1957, Shug was an ever present in the 1961/62 title winning campaign in which he also won his first full Scottish cap against Czechoslovakia a World Cup play-off match as well as two Under-23 caps. Was part of the side to reach the European Cup semi-final in 1963 and the Scottish Cup Final the following year and would later return to Dens in 1975 as first a coach and then chief scout.\n\nBOBBY SEITH – 2012 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nA cultured and artistic right-half, Bobby Seith won the English League title with Burnley in 1960 before repeating that feat with Dundee two years later as part of the formidable half-back line of Seith, Ure and Wishart. He captained the Scottish League v Scotland during Dundee’s championship season and the following year captained the Dark Blues in both legs of the European Cup semi-final against AC Milan.

Smith’s precision play was perfect in aiding the development of young forwards Alan Cousin and Alan Gilzean and Gillie’s prowess in the air was the perfect foil for Smith’s superb crossing ability. He was the pin-up of Scottish Football and the oldest member of the Dundee title winning side at 38 years old and in view of his age, Smith achievements at Dens are extraordinary. In total he played 100 times in three seasons, scoring 19 times and during the championship winning season he played 37 games, bettering that a year later with 48 appearances including a European Cup semi-final appearance at the age of 39. Having already won the League Flag with Hibs and Hearts as well as 32 caps for Scotland during a glittering career, Gordon contributed nine goals in he Dark Blue’s league winning year, including a famous strike in a 4-1 win over Dundee United on his home league debut.\n\nBOBBY WISHART – 2012 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nBobby Wishart was a cultured left-half and a member of the celebrated Dundee half-back line of Bobby Seith, Ian Ure and himself A championship winner with Aberdeen in 1955, he repeated that feat with The Dee after joining from The Dons in January 1961 for a fee of £3,500 which gave him a golden finish to an excellent footballing career.

He is the captain with the most winners’ medals in the club’s history with two League Cup medals and one Scottish League B Division medal and in the first League Cup win in 1951, he scored a dramatic last minute winner to defeat Rangers 3-2 at Hampden. As part of the famous half-back line of Gallacher, Cowie and Boyd, Alfie made 169 appearances for The Dee which also saw him lead Dundee out in the 1952 Scottish Cup Final and finish as Scottish League Championship runner-up three years before.\n\nBOBBY GLENNIE – 2013 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nBobby Glennie is a Dens Park cult hero who was lucky enough to play for the club he supported as a boy for twelve enjoyable years and relished his Legends Award when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. As a Dundee player there is arguably no one who was more committed to the cause and he quickly became a fans favourite during his 388 appearances in Dark Blue. In 1980 he had the honour of captaining Dundee in the Bell’s League Cup Final and in the last game of that season, in which he played in every match, he laid on the goal against East Stirlingshire for Eric Sinclair to secure promotion back to the Premier Division.

A right-back very much in the wing back mould, Bobby’s highlight in a Dundee shirt undoubtedly came in the 1973 League Cup Final when he played a key part in the victory as his free kick was controlled by Gordon Wallace who then struck it into the net for the winner. Bobby also played in the 1967 League Cup Final against Celtic, scored in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-final against Leeds United the same season and also scored the winner in the famous UEFA Cup game against Cologne in 1971 when Dundee came back from 4-2 down with twenty minutes to go, to win 5-4.\n\nJACK COWAN – 2013 INTERNATIONAL AWARD\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Claudio Caniggia and Giorgi Nemsadze, Canadian Jack Cowan is the latest International Award inductee into the Dundee FC Hall of Fame.

His first involvement with the club was as a goalkeeper in the all-conquering 1917/18 wartime Dark Blues which won every competition it entered but he is more fondly remembered as the manager who brought the most silverware to Dens during his eleven years in charge. Becoming managing/director in 1944, he found Dundee in the second tier and as he rebuilt the club from its wartime hiatus, he led them to back to back B Division Championships before being granted promotion to the top tier. Within two years Dundee were runners-up in the Scottish League Championship and after spending a world record fee for Billy Steel in 1950, his ‘think big, be big’ philosophy paid off as Dundee became the first side to retain the Scottish League Cup in 1951 and 1952 with a Scottish Cup Final appearance sandwiched in between.\n\nBILL BROWN – 2015 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nBill Brown was one of the greatest Scottish goalkeepers of the post-War period and is a legend at Dens Park as a member of the 1951 League Cup winning side.

The following season he was part of the team to win the League Cup against Celtic at Hampden while in European competition he is revered for his hat-trick against Cologne in 1971 in one of the greatest games Dens Park has ever seen.

The clever inside-forward made 333 appearances for Dundee, scoring 71 times and his time at Dens saw him win eight international honours, be a Scottish League Championship runner-up three times and was a key figure in Dundee’s 1910 Scottish Cup win.\n\nJAMES GRADY (GOAL VS. DUNDEE UNITED) – 2015 HALL OF FAME MODERN MOMENT\n\nA new category introduced this year – was be awarded to the ever popular James Grady.

This new award is designed to honour the players whose achievements made it such a special time and the Club were delighted to announce that the first recipient of the Golden Era Award was Jimmy Toner, a member of that wonderful George Anderson side of the early Fifties who won two Scottish League Cups. Dundee were the first side to win back to back League Cups and Toner played in both finals against Rangers and Kilmarnock in 1951 and 1952 in his 71 appearances for the Dark Blues.

In four years at Dens he scored 106 goals in 138 appearances and his record speaks for itself as a prolific goal getter, not just in Dundee’s history but also in Scottish Football history. His 44 goal haul in his first season with Dundee has yet to be bettered by any player who has followed and helped him win the 1977 Scottish League First Division Player of the Year.\n\nHis 1.3 goals per game ratio did much to alleviate the sense of doom and gloom then prevailing at Dens Park following relegation from the inaugural Premier Division and the memory of him scoring for fun in the First Division lives long in the memory of all who saw him. Part of the 1979 First Division winning side, goals king Billy more than deserves to be inducted into the club’s Hall of Fame with a Legends Award.\n\nNEIL MCCANN – 2016 MODERN HEROES AWARD\n\nNeil McCann came through the youth ranks and Dens and burst onto the scene in the early Nineties where he became the first winner of the Andy De Vries Memorial Trophy as Dundee Player of the Year. He scored the goal which took Dundee to the 1995 League Cup Final with a fantastic strike in the semi against Airdrie and he came out of retirement in 2011 in the Dark Blues’ hour of need to score another sensational goal as a Dee-Fiant hero against Raith Rovers; one of Dens Park’s greatest moments.\n\nThe winger won ten Scotland Under-21 caps while at Dens and those two never-to-be-forgotten strikes were among 12 goals in 97 appearances.

Signed from Raith Rovers in 1986, Wright was part of two successful goal scoring partnerships in his time at Dens but became a legend in his own right when he scored a hat-trick in a memorable derby win over Dundee United in 1989.\n\nWright scored 75 goals in 197 appearances, won the Tennents Sixes and the Centenary Cup and was the last Dundee player to represent the Scottish League in 1990 and his goals against United will live long in the memory.\n\nROBERT DOUGLAS – 2017 MODERN HEROES AWARD\n\nThe Club introduced the Modern Heroes Award to recognise the contribution of a player or manager from the Nineties onwards and Robert Douglas is a player who earned legendary status across the three decades that this award covers.\n\nWith 98 clean sheets in 303 appearances, Douglas is a Dark Blue goalkeeping great and as big a Dundee hero as you’ll meet.
