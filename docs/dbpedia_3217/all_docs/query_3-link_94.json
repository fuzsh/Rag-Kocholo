        "text": "Acknowledgements NRGFL would like to acknowledge the support of Aberdeen Sports Village in hosting the <strong>finals</strong> for 2009. This is an excellent venue in which to accommodate the <strong>finals</strong> and is appreciated by all involved both on the pitch and behind the scenes. The North Regional Girls <strong>Football</strong> League look forward to working with the Aberdeen Sports Village on these events in the future. I would like to express my appreciation to the NRGFL Committee who have worked tirelessly to ensure the NRGFL is supported and developed over the season. Without their assistance the NRGFL would not be such a successful organisation. In addition, a thank you to Pauline Hamill, Scotland International Womens player and High Performance <strong>Football</strong> Coach at SFA Women's National Academy, for presenting the awards on the <strong>day</strong>.
