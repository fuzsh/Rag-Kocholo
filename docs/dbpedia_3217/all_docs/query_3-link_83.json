McClure, who plays on either wing, was on the books of Preston North End before joining Wallsend, and is 22 years of age, 5ft. 9m. height, and weighs11ist. 4lb\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 7 WEST BROMWICH ALBION RESERVES 3\n\nNovember 11th 1929. Liverpool Post and Mercury.\n\nEverton played their best game of the season against the Albion at Goodison Park in the Central League game and won by 7 goals to 3. The whole team excelled in footcraft, combination, and skill Wilkinson was the spearhead of the attack and in scoring five of the seven goals revealed speed, skill, expert ball distribution, and a deadly finish. Ritchie and Easton scored Everton’s other goals, and although the forward line was brilliant in all they did, Troup and Ritchie were outstanding with a wing brilliance that dazzled a good defence. The Albion’s goals were of the snap order. Richardson (2), and Short ( a great schemer) being the scorers. McClure, Everton’s latest addition was responsible for a really fine exhibition at right half and fitted into the workings of a perfectly balanced team admirably.\n\nEverton; – Sagar, goal; Common and W. O’Donnell, backs, McClure, Whyte, and Virr, half-backs, Ritchie, Wilkinson, French, Weldon, and Troup, forwards.\n\nBIRMINGHAM CITY RESERVES 3 EVERTON RESERVES 3\n\nNovember 18th 1929. Liverpool Post and Mercury.\n\nCapital marksmanship by Robinson , who completed the hat-trick, saved Birmingham from defeat against Everton. Wilkinson (2) and Troup were Everton scorers. Birmingham monopolised early play, but Everton found their feet and after the interval had matters their own way. Troup gave a remarkable display and was instrumental in both of Wilkinson goals, and Ritchie also made an impression while Grosvenor was the pick of the Birmingham line.\n\nEverton; – Sagar, goal, Common and W. O’Donnell, backs; McClure, Whyte, Virr, half-backs; Ritchie, Dunn, Wilkinsin, Weldon, and Troup, forwards.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 6 HUDDERSFIELD TOWN RESERVES 1\n\nNovember 25th 1929. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nThe opening play was of such an even character that an overwhelming Everton victory seemed improbable Ritchie started the scoring. The Town however, do not possess a convincing defence. Huddersfield midfield combination was nice and artistic to watch, but lost most of its effectiveness when allied to excessive individualism in Everton’s goal area. Prior to the interval Attwood and Weldon scored and with Everton showing footcraft and ability that was superior to the Town in the second halt Attwood (2) and Easton added further goals, with Raw scoring for Huddersfield. Common, McClure, Ritchie and Troup were outstanding.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 4 BURY RESERVES 1\n\nDecember 9th 1929. The Daily Courier.\n\nConsidering the conditions prevailing Everton played brilliant football against Bury and but for the excellent custodianship of Harrison would have won by an even bigger margin. Wilkinson, at times, showed a penchant for lying offside, but nevertheless played well. In addition of scoring three goals –the first rather lucky, as Harrison was lying injured he hit the woodwork on other occasions. Stein was also a fine marksman and Dunn who netted the Blues other point, made with Ritchie a fine wing. McClure, J. Whyte and Kelly formed a clever constructive middle line. The Bury forwards were well led by Johnson, who scored but the halves and backs were not too successful.\n\nEverton; – Sagar, goal, Common and Wilson, backs, Kelly, McClure, and J. Whyte, half-backs, Ritchie, Dunn, Wilkinson, Weldon, and Stein, forwards.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 3 BLACKBURN ROVERS RESERVES 2\n\nDecember 23 rd 1929. The Daily Courier\n\nEverton gave another capital display, and when they held a three goals’ lead an easy win seemed assured. The Rovers, however, rallied, and at the close there was only a goal separating the sides, which just about represented Everton’s superiority. Wilkinson scored Everton’s first two goals. Easton headed a third, but within a minute or so Graves opened Blackburn’s account. Bourton scored the Rovers second near the end.\n\nEverton; Sagar, goal, Common and Kennedy, backs, Kelly, McClure and Lewis, half-backs, Ritchie, Easton, Wilkinson, Weldon, and Stein, forwards.\n\nSHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY 4 EVERTON 0\n\nDecember 27th 1929. The Daily Courier.\n\nDrastic Changes By Everton McClure Barracked On His Debut\n\nBy the Pilot\n\nFor the return match between Everton and the Wednesday drastic changes were made in the Goodison side, and several of them proved successful. Particularly do I prefer to the introduction of an unceremonious pivot from Wallasey McClure, and the return of Hart. Everton did well yesterday up to half-time, but were later outclassed by a smarter, more incisive team. This despite the fact that the Champions had a rearranged side owing to injury. Strange to say, Leach, who was injured so that he had to go to the outside left, scored two goals. Prior to the reshuffle, however, Everton had chirped a merry tune to the Wednesday, and from Rigby Weldon and Hart came the prettiest and most scientific football I have seen from any Everton side since the Grimsby match. The Champions did not reach the Everton goalmouth at all during the first five minutes, and made only half-hearted attacks up to 16 minutes, when they took the lead with a goal secured through real football. Everton had been going great guns with McClure an intrepid tackler and break-up, and a judicious feeder. Wilkinson hit the post after snapping up one of his through passes, and then when the Champions were making ground on the right. Strange undoubtedly their best player, surprised friend and foe with a low swinging pass right to the feet of Rimmer on the left. Rimmer sliced the ball a few yards in to the waiting Burgess, who, unmarked stabbed it into the roof of the net. It was just before the interval that the referee had occasion to speak to McClure, though never admonishing Allen, and this seemed to upset the debutant. At least he did not do so well after, in addition, he was subjected to barracking from the crowd just because he did not stand on ceremony. With Seed the versatile acting as pivot, the Wednesday got down to more series and better work on resuming, and after Davies had made a great one handed save from Allen after 49 minutes he merely tapped down Hooper’s subsequent corner, and Leach had nothing to do but slip the ball into the net.\n\nALLEN’S WONDERFUL SHOT.\n\nEverton were beaten from that point onwards and even the erstwhile clever left wing became disjoined, though Rigby still continued to play excellently. In 79 minutes when O’Donnell made a feeble attempt to pass back to Cresswell, Allen nipped through and let go a beauty, which Davies parried. Before he could recover Leach had scraped the ball inst. inside the post with Cresswell fighting valiantly to force it out. Two minutes from the end Allen scored the fourth goal with a wonderful shot from the edge of the “box” after Robson had headed out from a corner. It was a marvellous effort. In the first half Everton were good. There was some semblance of cohesion and real ground football, but the shock of the goal after having had equally as much of the opening play, seemed to upset them. It changed a promising team into a bad one. The Champions were eager to take all the license given them, and with their halves again operating grandly, they steeped boldly forward to victory. The Wednesday were quicker on the ball, and possessed the better ideals, but they must have considered themselves children of fortune to turn over with a lead.\n\nTeams; – Sheffield Wednesday; – Brown, goal, Walker, and Blenkinson, backs, Strange, Leach, and Marsden, half-backs, Hooper, Seed, Allen, Burgess, and Rimmer, forwards.\n\nEverton; – Davies, goal Cresswell and O’Donnell, backs, Robson McClure and Hart (captain), half-backs, Ritchie, Martin, Wilkinson, Weldon, Rigby, forwards.\n\nBOLTON WANDERERS 5 EVERTON 0\n\nDecember 30th 1929. The Daily Courier.\n\n“WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERTON”\n\nQUERY ANSWERED\n\nHALF-BACKS TOTALLY INADEQUATE –REFLECTIONS ON THE LATEST DEBACLE.\n\nBLACKMORE’S FOUR OF BOLTON’S FIVE GOALS.\n\nBLUES’ MISTAKEN TACTIS –O’DONNELL RETIRES WITH INJURED KNEE\n\nBy The Pilot.\n\nEverton wound up a sad and sorry Christmas with a five clear goals defeat at the hands of Bolton Wanderers at Burnden Park, on Saturday, and now occupy one of the danger positions in the League table. Out of the three holiday matches they have gained no points and only one goal to put against thirteen secured by opponents. Their position is more than serious. On Christmas Day against the Wednesday they gave a poor exhibition, but opposed by the cunning Wanderers they were demoralised from start to finish, and were never in the hurt with a chance. The ground was like a quagmire and rain pelted down all the time, but yet the Blues thought fit to try and force the ball through the mud instead of making full use of the extreme wingers, who could operate on solid ground, like Bolton did. It was a case of mistaken tactics all through, but there was more in it than that –the half-backs were totally inadequate. In that lies the secret of Bolton’s success. Their middle line supported both attack and defence in the correct manner, but the Everton trio were kept running hither and thither, never giving a workable pass to the men in front, and scarcely helping the galliant defence, which alone saved the side from an even greater reverse. The Everton forwards had some excuse in that they received no support whatever, but then it was only the half-starved wingers who brought any danger to the home goal. The inside men, while working as hard as they could, were pursing a totally wrong method to ever bring success. The credit in this game, speaking only from the Everton standpoint goes to Davies, Cresswell and O’Donnell. It seems passing strange that an outplayed, outmanceovred side should possess the outstanding player on the field, but Everton had him in Cresswell, who has not played better this season. I say this while cognisant of the fact that he was one of the regular star performers at the beginning of the campaign. O’Donnell also operated grandly, but had the misfortune to injure his right knee midway in the second half, and after a spell on the wing, went off for good. He was later examined by a specialist, who states that he has stretched a ligament, which will necessitate his knee being in splints for ten days. It is yet another blow to the club, but there is hope O’Donnell will be ready for the Cup-tie. Davies was the third man to do well, and he had no chance with the shots, which beat him, for when Blackmore, who got four, is in a shooting mood, few goalkeepers have an earthly.\n\nUNFORTUNATE GOALS.\n\nBolton had fortune on their side, in the first half, not so much in the matter of play, but in the manner in which the goals were obtained. There was no denying the fact that they were the better team on the day and their fast-moving forwards played havoc with the Blues’ halves, so that Cresswell and O’Donnell had to take most of the responsibility from first to last. They stood up to it manfully, and I was inclined to pity them that two such unfortunate goals should been chalked against them at the change-over. The first came after ten minutes when McKay shot, following a corner. The ball was going wide, but Gibson managed to flick it into the net at the last minute. There was an element of luck about this. After 33 minutes Kean only half hit the ball up the middle, where Blackmore took command and ran through on his own. His low shot was diverted by Davies, but hardly far enough for it hit the post struck in the mud, and was thankfully tapped home by the menacing Blackmore before any defender could come up to save the situation. All through the half Everton had kept the ball too close, but Troup and Critchley did well when given the chance. Those chances were very few and far between, however. Pym’s sole exacting tasks were to handle shots from Troup and Martin. It was almost akin to a procession in the second half, for Bolton liberally toyed with the Blues until they came against the backs, whose efforts undoubtedly kept the score down. Even when McClure and White changed places there was little difference. Bolton adopted the right measures, whereas Everton were always placing additional obstacles in their own path.\n\nTHREE MORE FOR BLACKMORE.\n\nIn the 63 rd and 64 th minutes Blackmore completed his hat-trick with lighting drives. In the first instance he hit Kean’s pass as it dropped, and there were few people who saw the ball until it lay peacefully in the net, and the second time he snapped up a pass from Cook, wheeled round Cresswell and almost broke the net, so powerful was his shot. No once did the Blues raise a hope of retrieving their lost position, and it came as no surprise when Blackmore added a fifth by ramming home after Cresswell had headed to his feet. I felt sorry for Cresswell this time for it was his one error during the match. A great record, though. Everton made changes, which can only be written down as failures. The full backs and goalkeeper were excellent, well; neither of the three has played better this season. The tackling anticipation and kicking of the backs was perfect, and Davies did his work with a coolness and readiness that needed no improvement. Even when Cresswell was left on his own he was the dominating personality of the game, and it was small wonder that the crowd rose to him. I had expected big things with White as centre half again, but he was left floundering by the astute Bolton forwards, who realised how essential it was to make play of Cook and Butler. McClure was a robust as at Hillsborough, but that carried him nowhere, and, to put it plainly, he was outclassed. Robson was a fighter to the end, but accomplished little in defence and less in attack. Facts must be faced in the present circumstances, and I emphatically assert that the cause of Everton’s lapse is weakness at half-back.\n\nTRIAL OF DEFEAT.\n\nTroup and Critchley did as well as anyone would have expected on the material they were given, especially in the first half, but they lacked the right support, because the inside men were always trying to traverse a hopeless trial down the mud-strewn centre. Martin seemed loath to part with the ball, and Rigby made the mistake of always trying to put Wilkinson through. Still he is, without doubt, a winger, not an inside forward, so there is excuse for him. Wilkinson relied on speed, but his ball control was not good enough, and he fell easy prey to the lanky Round. The game was quite good in the circumstances for the Wanderers played today lovely football at times. They could afford to by the way, for the opposition was poor. The defence had an easy time, for the halves bore the brunt of the work and could accomplish it easily. Kean was the pick of the line. Cook played better than I have ever seen him, and he was the one man on the field, who could luggle with the ball. Butler was a great asset to the side, but then both these men succeeded because the team wisely decided that they were the trustiest rapiers to use. I wish Everton had though the same Troup and Critchley. In Blackmore the Wanderers had the right man to finish off the work. Rarely have I seen such brilliant shooting as his while his wide passes were flung with the utmost accuracy. Gibson was the mastermind in this splendid attack, but McKay to my mind, constituted a comparatively weak link. He lacked ideas. Everton failed utterly to give anything approaching good football, and were well and truly defeated by an infinitely superior combination.\n\nThe teams ; – Bolton Wanderers; – Pym, goal, Haworth and Finney, backs, Kean, Round, and Nuttall, half-backs, Butler, McKay, Blackmore, Gibson and Cook, forwards.\n\nEverton; – Davies, goal, Cresswell and O’Donnell, backs, Robson, White, and McClure, half-backs, Critchley, Martin, Wilkinson, Rigby and Troup (captain), forwards.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 2 LEEDS UNITED RESERVES 1\n\nJanuary 1 st 1930. The Evening Express\n\nThe debut of Ben Williams, Everton’s new International full back, was the exception in the Reserves game at Goodison Park today. The Welshmen was early prominent when he twice pulled up the visiting right wing with timely clearances. Leeds took the lead in eleven minutes, first driving past Sagar from close range after Williams had been unable to get the ball away, because of the mud. Two minutes later Everton drew level when Stein crossed a perfect centre, which Dunn headed to the foot of Hewitt, who had no difficulty in scoring. Everton were awarded a penalty after 25 minutes, Menzies having fisted out a header from Ritchie. Weldon shot over from the spot, Everton took the lead following a free kick after 36 minutes. The goalkeeper only partially cleared and Stein experienced no difficulty in netting.\n\nEverton; – Sagar, goal, Common and Williams, backs, Kelly, McClure, and Bryan, half-backs, Ritchie, Dunn, Hewitt, Weldon, and Stein, forwards.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 0 OLDHAM ATHLETIC RESERVES 0\n\nFebruary 24th 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nA draw was a fitting result at Goodison park, for whereas Everton were the most persistent attackers, there were spasmodic raids from the Athletic attack that seriously jeopardised the home goal –when Taylor raced clean through and Davies saved from close in, again when the same player shook the crossed bar with a first-timer, and when Smelt cleverly directed a header, the Everton goalkeeper clearing. Against this was a series of Everton raids that kept the Oldham Athletic defence almost continually on the run, while shots from Wilkinson, French and Troup were saved. The first-half offered little to aroused enthusiasm for nether attack was capable of over coming sturdy defenders, but the second half provided a complete revival of the Everton front line, and they harassed a solid defence without succeeding in getting through –although French and Wilkinson were conspicuous raiders, Cresswell Common, Davies and McClure were prominent defenders.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 5 SOUTHPORT 2\n\nFebruary 27 th 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nLiverpool senior cup semi-final\n\nBy “Bees.”\n\nSouthport do not often make appearances at Goodison park, and their Liverpool Cup-tie yesterday, at the ground brought them face to face with some expert manipulators of the ball. One signing alone on the home team part cost more than Southport’s side and their wage bill for a season. This much can be said of the game that ended 5-2 for Everton; Southport put up a brave show showed some good football ideas, much energy, a fair game, and a fighting spirit to the finish of the tie. They made a braver show than the score suggests. Indeed at half-time they were level, and they had missed chances that should have given them opportunity of creating a rare surprise. Everton always played as if they had a bit in reserve, and there came a period after half-time when they did pretty well as they liked. Yet Southport fought on the end, and unfortunately their forward faults continued to the bitter end –they were not decisive in front of goal, and I am not forgetting a shot that hit the bar when the goalkeeper could not have saved.\n\nBAKER’S FINE DISPLAY.\n\nThey seem to grow goalkeepers in Southport, as witness the long services man Halsall, and then Jones of Everton, and nowadays a North East Coast boy named Baker, who though not tall served up a fine exhibition of goalkeepering, catches, and daring. He had an injury early half, yet he had the main honours of the day for his saves at point blank range were of sterling quality. He has a great idea of positioning himself, and his eye never leaves the ball. He had plenty of practice in the second half, because the home half-backs were so skilled in the use of the ball for the benefit of the forward line. It took Everton some time to start their weaving beyond two sturdy backs and against a side that had to field a completely reserves elements on the left flank. In the end, of course, Everton won cleverly and well, and it may be that some of Attwood’s work and shooting led the home people to believe in him more than they have done in the past.\n\nSTEIN AS OUTSIDE RIGHT.\n\nStein, tried as a right winger instead of a left winger also had a useful day and Wilkinson got in some powerful and quick work, his inter-passing with his comrades being of good quality and sure touch. In point of touch no one equalled McPherson of Swansea, and Hart. They were masters of the craft, and the nonchalant way McPherson got through his afternoon’s work would have led the small crowd to a noisy interruption but for the fact that at last they realised the value of the man’s ideas and the ability with which he carried on his plans of campaign. One could see the effect of his presence upon the clever young half-back behind him. Bryan by name. McClure also did well, at half-back, and it was here that Everton were so superior. The Southport half-backs Jones excepted would kick anywhere –which leads nowhere. The scorers in order were Wilkinson, Hill (half-time), McPherson, Cowan, Attwood, Stein and Attwood. Baker’s goalkeeping was the feature of a game where many offside decisions arose –some unnecessarily. Southport depended to some degree upon this method of defence. It were better to adopt the positive fashion of Cresswell and Common.\n\nTeams ;- Everton; Davies, goal, Cresswell and Common, backs McClure, Hart and Bryan, half-backs, Stein. Wilkinson, Attwood, McPherson, and Troup, forwards.\n\nSouthport; Baker, goal, Little and Kelly, backs, Jones, Dixon, and Sinclair, half-backs, Hills, Allen, Cowan, Holmes, Garstang, forwards .

The Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nThe senior side being disengaged the eleven to represent Everton in the Central League match at Goodsion Park on Saturday against Birmingham on paper appears one of the strongest side turned out in the competition. The new goalkeeper Coggins is to make his debut for Everton while Dean is to lead the attack since his rise to fame, Dean has seldom appeared in the second team.\n\nTeam; Coggin; Cresswell, Common; McPherson, Hart, McClure; Critchley, Dunn, Dean, McCambridge, Weldon.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 2 BIRMINGHAM CITY RESERVES 2\n\nMarch 24 th 1930. The Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nCENTRAL LEAGUE\n\nIt must have been disappointing for the home supporters to find Everton’s strong team held until the closing minutes –a debarred enabling Everton to equalise. It was a fair result as Birmingham did not deserve to lose. Everton were persistent attackers but their finishing efforts were disappointing. Dean, without revealing the speed and ability of two seasons ago, was ever dangerous and although he was guilty of a bad miss when Weldon centred early on, he tried hard throughout, and was often foiled by the ability of Tewkesbury, the Birmingham amateur keeper. McPherson, at right half was conspicuous and McCambridge and Dunn worked industriously. Weldon was not at all comfortable on the left wing. Critchley, on the right wing was Everton’s most dangerous forward. Coggins in goal showed fine judgement. The goals scored by Horseman and Lane for Birmingham and Critchley and McPherson (Penalty) for Everton .\n\nEverton; – Coggins goal; Cresswell and Common, backs; McPherson, Hart and McClure, half-backs; Critchley, Dunn, Dean, McCambridge, and Weldon, forwards.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 1 BLACKPOOL RESERVES 0\n\nApril 21 st 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nA strong, gusty wind made football a difficult proposition, but Everton countered it with commendable merit and earned a good victory. They were persistent attackers for practically two-thirds of the game, and it was the brilliant custodianship of Randle in the Blackpool goal, aided by the sturdy defensive work of Gibson, Jennings, and Brooks, that prevented a heavier goal margin. Common struck the crossbar with a terrific free kick, and Gibson in an effort to relieve pressure back-headed against the bar –these were but two of the many incidents in the Seasiders’ goalmouth where Randle cleared shots from Weldon, who played a convincing game throughout, Wilkinson, Attwood, and McClure. Blackpool, against the wind, showed practically ideas in the first half, but during the concluding half the losers were unable to master the home halves and backs. Everton’s goal came after half an hour. McCambridge scoring from a Wilkinson corner. The winners played well enough to more than merit –the victory.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 4 PRESTON NORTH END RESERVES 0\n\nApril 22 nd 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nEverton conclusion their home Central League programme in a convincing victory over Preston North End. The winners thoroughly deserved the better-balanced team and harassed a strong defence. The home attacks in the art of penetration that was lacking in the North End line, Owen had a shot which Sagar tipped over the bar, there was little prospect of a Preston goal, although they made a good number of attacks that were easy repulsed by Common and Kennedy –or McClure. Everton in contrast severely tested Foster in the losers goal. French, Wilkinson, Weldon, Lewis and Kelly all making good efforts. Wilkinson and French scored for Everton in the first half, and although North End made forward changes on resuming, their came to nothing and French added further goals for Everton.\n\nBOLTON WANDERER RESERVES 2 EVERTON 0\n\nMAY 5 TH 1930. The Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nAt Bolton. But for the strong defence of Sagar Kennedy, and Common the score would have been heavier. McClure was an outstanding half and Stein the most effective forward. Jones scored for the Wanderers.\n\nEverton;- Sagar goal; Common and Kennedy backs; Robson, McClure and Bryan, half-backs; Parker, Wilkinson, French, McCambridge, and Stein, forwards.\n\nFOOTBALL LAST KICK\n\nMay 12, 1930. The Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nLiverpool 1 Everton 0\n\nLiverpool cup victory\n\nEverton’s ill-luck continues to the end.\n\nBy “Bee.”\n\nEverton went out of their 1929-30 season in characteristic fashion –their misforunates continued to the last gasp of the over-plus season. They lost the Liverpool Cup final at Anfield by a goal to none, and Critchley was off the field for most of the second half through injury. Riley was, however, their greatest barrier; he made some telling saves against Dean, Martin, and others, and held up the Liverpool defence while the home side was being severely tested. Riley’s reach stood him in good stead, and after Critchley had tried his leg in the second half for a couple of minutes he retired, and thereafter, in spite of a brave show by Everton, Liverpool drove in some good shots, Sagar being a competent goalkeeper. Wright beat him at three-quarter time, however, and this was the only goal of the day. It was a capital game, and Liverpool rounded off some of their smart passing on the left wing with full drives, but Wright was not on the mark, and was chiefly notable for his scheming. This was a point upon which Martin earned praise –he was tireless in the second half when wheeling round opponents, and another feature was the way the local centre half-back James stood to attention against Dean, who was playing for the first time for some weeks, and was captain of the side. Dean’s heading was better than at any previous point of this season, and one shot he made brought out the full strength of Riley’s masterly. Everton went away without a goal, and this was the first time they had failed to score in the last ten games.\n\nBoth sides brought into the game a number of their minor men, and James was the one outstanding success, though Charlton did well at full back and Thompson was useful at half-back. The home right wing pair did not dovetail with good result, and could not be compared with Gunson and Wright. Smith, who received knock, misfired too frequently, while Stein had the chances to win the game early on. White showed his versatility by going to outside right in the second half. He a strong player and has a number of tricks to recommend him. It is football craft all the time with him.\n\nThe spectators to the number of about 8,000 stayed on after the game to see the representation of the cup. This act was performed in the dressing room below by Mr. J.H.Hayes M.P., and the crowds were rather petulant that they had not been permitted to see the trophy or the representation. The police had a little difficulty in dealing with them and they stayed on needlessly for some time, refusing to take the advice of Superintendent Hughes that there would not be a public presentation.\n\nTeams; – Liverpool; – Riley, goal; Done and Charlton, backs; Morrison, James, and Thompson, half-backs; Barton, Race, Smith, Wright, and Gunson, forwards.\n\nEverton; – Sagar, goal; Common and O’Donnell, backs; Robson, McClure, and Byran, half-backs; Critchley, White Dean (captain), Martin, and Stein, forwards. Referee Mr. J. Ainsworth.\n\nThe following is a list of the players signed for next season: – goalkeepers Coggins, Sager, full backs Cresswell, O’Donnell J, Williams, Common, Howe (Southport) Parker (Adlington, half backs, Hart, Griffiths, McPherson, McClure, Bryan, Robson, Towers, Britton (Bristol Rovers) and Thomson, forwards, Critchley, Wilkinson, Rigby, Dean, McCambridge, Johnson, Webster, T White, Chedgzoy, Stein, Martin, and Cunliffe (Darlington).\n\nTRAMERE’S BID\n\nSeptember 1930\n\nRepresentatives of Tranmere Rovers attended the board meeting of the Everton F.C last night. They were anxious to secure the transfer of McClure, the centre half-back, who has played in the League team. Everton, however, were not inclined to part with this player.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 3 MANCHESTER CITY RESERVES 1\n\nOctober 13 th 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nAt Goodison Park the fine work of Langford in goal prevented the winners adding to their score. The City scored first through Syme, but Stein equalised. White added the second, and McClure the third. Everton were the superior side throughout Webster, White and McClure being particularly prominent.\n\nEVERTON TACKLE THE FOREST\n\nOctober 16th 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nBy John Peel Everton renew acquaintance with Notts Forest at Nottingham. The clubs have had many hard tussles in the past, and there is no reason to anticipate that the meeting on Saturday will lack anything in point of keenest. The Forest has found life in the Second Division very strenuous, and so far this term they have only won three of their ten games. This will be Everton’s second “away” game in succession, and as it usual for clubs to try to take down the leaders in any competition I have no doubt that the Forrest will put in every effort to lower the colours of Everton, who will be represented by the team which drew at Barnsley via; -Coggins; Williams, Cresswell; McPherson, Griffiths, Thomson; Critchley, Dunn, Dean, Johnson, Rigby. Everton meet Blackburn Rovers in a Central League match at Goodison Park today, when the home side will be represented by: Sagar; Lowe, Cook; Britton, Gee, McClure; Wilkinson, Martin, White, Webster, Stein.\n\nSTOKE CITY RESERVES 2 EVERTON RESERVES 0\n\nNovember 10 th 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nTwo late goals both by Williamson, the Stoke City centre half, gave them the victory at Stoke. It was not a good game, the forwards work of both sides lack of cohesion and much of the markmanship being feeble. Stoke City just about deserved to win, but they were not two goals the better side .\n\nEverton; – Sagar goal; Common and Lowe, backs; McClure, Gee (captain), and Towers, half-backs; Not-Known, Barton, White, Webster, and Stein, forwards.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 4 WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS RESERVES 5\n\nNovember 17th 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nEverton were compelled to make a number of changes from their usual team, and in consequence there was not the same sparkle and solidarity that characterized previous home games. Still the losers fought a great fight and seemed assured of victory till the last quarter, when the Wolves fought back desperately and succeeded in getting two goals inside four minutes. It was a good hard game, with fortunes fluctuating remarkably. Everton’s attack did exceptionally well, White Martin, and Webster playing brilliantly, while Gee scored twice, and was conspicuous in a resolute defence. Hunt opened with a fine goal, McClure equalised and Liggins gave Everton the lead. Belis and Hetherinton (Wolves) scored before the interval, after which Gee scored Everton’s third goal. Shortly afterwards Gee scored Everton’s fourth and victory seemed theirs till near the close when Hunt came along with a fourth and fifth goal for the Wolves.\n\nASTON VILLA RESERVES 2 EVERTON RESERVES 2\n\nNovember 24th 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nAt Villa Park. Aston Villa were fortunate to share the points for the visitors were rather the better side and showed more thrust. After twenty minutes Martin wriggled through the home defence to score for Everton, and two minutes later White added a second. During the second portion the Villa strove hard to score and Brown netted, while Tunstall levelled the score. Morton (goal), Smart (back), and Brown and Dorell (forwards) did well for the Villa while Sagar, Gee, Martin and White were outstanding for Everton.\n\nEverton; – Sagar, goal, O’Donnell and Lowe, backs; McPherson Gee (captain) and McClure half-backs; Critchley, Martin, White, Webster and McCambridge, forwards.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 0 HUDDERSFIELD TOWN RESERVES 5\n\nDecember 3rd 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nAlthough heavily defeated at home Everton had indulged in equally as much of the attacking as Huddersfield –in fact, Everton were rightly the most aggressive. It was late on when Huddersfield asserted their superiority and although Sagar did well, the home defence found the forward line made up of Kelly Lewes, Magnell, Raw, and Smallies too much for them. The first mentioned was always a danger to Everton, and after Webster shot had been brilliantly saved, Magnall opened Huddersfield’s score. After failing to get what appeared a penalty Everton fell away and later on goals were scored by Raw, Kelly (2), and Magnall.\n\nEverton; – Sagar, goal; O’Donnell and Lowe, backs; McClure, Gee (captain) and Towers, half-backs; Critchley, Martin, White, Webster, and McCambridge, forwards.\n\nBOLTON WANDERERS RESERVES 0 EVERTON RESERVES 2\n\nDecember 8th 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nCentral League (Abandon Game)\n\nEverton Robbed by Fog\n\nFog undoubtedly prevented Everton taking points from Bolton, for they had taken a firm grip of the game when seventeen minutes after the interval, the match was abandoned. Webster and Wilkinson scored excellent goals for Everton. Their wingmen were the chief source of danger.\n\nEverton; – Sagar goal; Cook and Parker backs; Britton, Gee (captain) and McClure half-backs; Wilkinson, Martin, McCambridge, Webster and White, forwards.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 6 PRESTON NORTH END RESERVES 1\n\nDecember 15th 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nEverton returned to their best form, and good progressive combination, terminating with an accurate finish and supported it solid defensive work led to them completely overplaying Preston for practically the whole of the game. The winners main strength was in the half-back line. Here Britton, Gee and McClure worked constructively with the home attack, and helped the defence to frequently wreck any ideas Preston formulated for progressive advances. North End, however, offered a very disappointing exhibition. Their attack was one of individual units, lacking cohesive ideas, the middle line was not capable of holding Everton’s lively attack, and only the rear defence achieve anything like a measure of success. One of Everton’s outstanding players were Leyfield (an outside left from Neston Brickwork playing his first game with Everton), for throughout he played continually, and proved a sound winger, with a penchant for driving in good shots. Everton’s scorers were White (2), Wilkinson (2), and Webster (2). Heaton scored for Preston.\n\nEverton; – Sagar goal; Cook and Parker, backs; Britton Gee (captain) and McClure, half-backs; Wilkinson, Martin, White, Webster and Leyfield, forwards.\n\nBURNLEY RESERVES 5 EVERTON RESERVES 0\n\nDecember 22nd 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nAt Burnley. But for Sagar’s brilliance in goal Burnley might have won by twice that margin. Sagar’s judgement was a feature of the game, which was largely controlled by Burnley, whose centre (Drinnan) registered a hat-trick. Henderson and Hall scoring the others. Burnley were sound as a team, and gave one of their best displays of the season .\n\nEverton; – Sagar, goal; Cook and Parker backs; Chedgzoy, Gee (captain) and McClure, half-backs; Wilkinson, Martin, White, Webster, and Leyfield, forwards.\n\nEVERTON RESERVES 4 LIVERPOOL RESERVES 1\n\nDecember 27th 1930. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nEverton were full value for their Christmas Day victory in the local “Derby” for although Liverpool opened well, and took the lead through am adroitly headed goal by Scott after fifteen minutes, the Everton halves gradually asserted command, and Liverpool to the end were fighting a hard battle. Still, Sagar, late on made two great clearances from Done and Raine, and Clarke’s leaving the field injured after twenty minutes of the second half further handicapped the Anfielders. Everton at all times were playing convincing, intricate footwork, allied with short sharp and snappy ball distribution making plenty of work for Done, Charlton, Jones, and Thompson. Everton’s equaliser came from White at the twenty-fifth minute, and a minute from the interval Webster gave Everton the lead. The winners were the more dangerous in the second half, and Wilkinson and White added further goals. Leyfield on the home left, played another good game, and Scott saved smartly from Martin and Webster, while White hit the upright. There was a large crowd, but the game did not evoke much enthusiasm .\n\nEverton; – Sagar goal; Cook and Parker, backs; Britton, Gee (captain), and McClure, half-backs; Wilkinson, Martin, White, Webster, and Leyfield, forwards.\n\nLiverpool; – Scott, goal; Done and Charlton, backs; Ireland, James, and Bromilow, half-backs; Burke, Clarke, A. Scott, Wright, and Raine, forwards\n\nMcCLURE’S CHANCE.\n\nJanuary 7th 1931. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nBy John Peel\n\nEverton have made a surprise change in their team to meet Plymouth Argyle at Plymouth. McClure the North-Eastern half-back, who has played in several League games, being preferred to Britton and McPherson at right half-back. McClure is a robust type of player whose style in a cup-tie may be calculated to be effective. Griffiths, who has been on the injured list, is fit again and returns to centre-half in place of Gee. These are the only changes from the side that beat Bury 3-2 and Swansea 5-2.\n\nThe team is Coggins; Williams, Cresswell; McClure, Griffiths, Thomson, Critchley, Dunn, Dean, Johnson, Stein. That side should be good enough to win.\n\nPLYMOUTH ARGYLE 0 EVERTON 2\n\nJanuary 12 th 1931. Liverpool Post and Mercury.\n\nEverton’s Treble\n\nDunn’s Gallant Effort After Injury\n\nPlymouth Make a Rallying Finish.\n\nBy “Bee.” Everton won at Plymouth Argyle’s fine ground and thus made new history. They have beaten Argyles three times this season –twice in the league 3-2 and 9-1, and now in the cup-tie 2-0. And the hardest match of the three was the cup-tie, which was a desperate but clean battle right to the end. It was a spendid match to watch, because both sides forsook the supposed cup-tie style and depended upon their usual league fashion of play to carry them through. Although there was a margin of two goals for the visiting side, the result does not give a fair idea of the work Everton went through to catch this lost thread of cup victories. They had to work desperately hard to win the this fine sporting game, and moveover, Plymouth come into the congratulations because they fought very ably against the deficit of two goals obtained in half an hour. They had their chances, they did not take them. When they were fighting hardest near the end of each half, Coggins was producing his best form.\n\nArgyle’s Early Fault.\n\nArgyle were at fault early on when they should have given the defence no chance of saving. This was most noticeable, when Crosier missed fair opportunities, and when Leslie, the acting captain for the absent Titmuss, failed to take a definite shot from an easy position when the score was 1-0. This was a turning point of the game. It is good to place on record the novelty that there was not a fool given all through the first half. The great failure of the match was the fact that Dunn stayed the distance. He was thrown, heavily in the first half, and late on got a second bang on the affected part and this time the full extent of the injury was realised. He was found to have a cracked collar bone and although it seemed madness for him to stay on the ground, he returned in the second half and went right through to the finish, giving a bright exhibition of usefulness, even when he knew that every kick of the ball meant a twinge of bain to him.\n\nDunn’s First Time Methods.\n\nDunn was expert in his dribbling, and his provisions of the first half, but I verily believe he was more useful in the second half as a “passager” because he did everything first time, each time his ankle pass or his direct push forward meant that an unmarked player received the ball so that he could take it. Dunn also got a valuable goal. He scored with a beautiful gliding header into the right-hand side of the net from a corner taken by Critchley –a corner given by a linesman after the referee had ordered a goal kick. The second goal arose through a well judged pass by Gee, who was called in at the last minute owing to Griffiths finding his damaged ankle not respond to the trial of the morning. Griffiths had said he was fit to play, but arriving, at the ground he had found a swelling, and so wisely decided to give up. Gee came in, and continued the good work he started a few weeks ago. It was his pass right out to the wing that let in Stein. A back attempt to trip Stein, who leaped up, and escaped the foul, and close in to make an angled but studied and stunning shot that left the capable Cann helpless. The game was not won; it was only just beginning –Plymouth saw Dunn ambling about with his arm strapped up, and they believed they where they had failed in the first half they could not improve and make good. Their efforts on the left wing were very able and their half-backs all through had a good innings but Crosier was off his game, thanks to the way Cresswell and Thomson kept him closed down.\n\nCresswell’s Polished Display.\n\nThis was one of the secrets of success, because Cresswell gave one of his easy, polished display, taking the ball off the toes of the opponents and heading and clearing with his accustomed brilliance. Williams was little less below him, but did not stand out in the same bold manner that Cresswell and Coggins stood out. I have mentioned Gee. He is very good with his head and uses his wing half-backs with passes that must be valuable. He keeps the ball on the ground. McClure had an excellent first half and then petered out a trifle, but he too, was sound in his use of the ball, which is the main art of half-back work. More than all, however, in the berth there had been need of a tackle and an attempt and McClure provided then both. In the forward line there was brilliance for half an hour by Dunn, and the line altogether worked with a fine positional power, and some good shooting, but after that Dean got a hurt and the line became ragged, which was not surprising because the link of the line had to lie back towards the half-back portion. Stein was perhaps, the most dangerous forward, albeit Critchley did well for a time, and both wingers had the speed and craft to carry them through. Plymouth made a grand rally in the last twenty minutes, and remembering they hit the woodwork twice, it will be conceded that they put up a very good fight in a match that had many congratulatory notes and very few jars –the worst being the injury to the best of the side, Dunn.\n\nTeams; – Plymouth Argyle; – Cann, goal; Roberts and Bland, backs; Mackay, Pullen, and Hardie, half-backs; Crozier, Bowen, Bird, Leslie (acting captain), and Black, forwards.\n\nEverton; – Coggins, goal; Williams (captain) and Cresswell, backs; McClure, Gee, and Thomson, half-backs; Critchley, Dunn, Dean, Johnson, and Stein, forwards.\n\nWinners Return\n\nLast night when Everton arrived home they were received by a big crowd of enthusiastic supporters and some officials who had not been able to make the journey. Three of the players Dunn, Dean and Williams –went straight to Dr. McMurray for attention.\n\nEVERTON 2 WEST BROMWICH ALBION 1\n\nJanuary 19th 1931. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nDean’s Goal Decides.\n\nEverton’s Hard Fight With Albion.\n\nFormidable Attacks.\n\nBoth sides had plenty of chances before Glidden scored for the Midlanders following a free kick against Gee at 26 minutes. Throughout the Albion defenders played with admirable courage and determination, and although the Everton forwards developed a number of formidable attackers they could now find an opening. Sixteen minutes after the interval, however, Martin equalised and Dean provided the opportunity when he sent Martin through with a clever header. If the Midlanders had a fault it was that they relied rather too much upon their defence and Everton having once drawn level went for the lead with great spirit. Seven minutes from the end came just such a chance as Dean lives for. A long punt down the centre from a free kick, a quick dash by Dean, and the ball flashed into the net before Pearson had time to prepare his defence. Some of the sparkle went out of the Albion side before the end, although occasionally they threatened to be dangerous. They fought with commendable spirit, and the game was one of the best of the season.\n\nA Masterly Leader.\n\nEverton had a sound, and efficient defence, the cool, heat, and effective work of Cresswell being admirably balanced by the dashing, resolute methods of Williams. They made a splendid pair. Gee was useful without being outstanding in the centre, and both Thomson and McClure did much good work. Dean was a masterly leader, and he was well supposed by Johnson, but Critchley and Stein rather spoiled their good efforts by poor finishing. The Albion had a splendid pair of backs in Shaw and Trentham, and while Glidden and Wood were capital raiders, the inside forwards lacked dash and the power to finish well. Teams; –\n\nEverton; – Coggins, goal; Williams (captain) and Cresswell, backs; McClure, Gee, and Thomson, half-backs; Critchley, Martin, Dean, Johnson, and Stein, forwards.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion; – Pearson, goal; Shaw and Trentham, backs; Magee, Richardson and Edwards (W), half-backs; Glidden, Carter, Richardson (WH), Sandford, and Wood, forwards.\n\nPANTO DAY BADGES AS EVERTON MASCOTS\n\nJanuary 22 nd , 1931. Evening Express.\n\nDixie Dean wants to score six goals against the palace.\n\nAnd believes he can do it. All the Everton players are wearing Panto Day immunity badges. Will they act the part of mascots and keep them immune from defeat when they visit Crystal Palace in the F.A.Cup on Saturday? The players believe they will. Dixie Dean is optimistic. He say’s he is going to score all those six goals, which will wipe out the bitterness of the 6-0 defeat of 1922. One thing is certain. Eleven men, trained to perfection, will carry the Goodison banner on the fourth stage of the journey to Wembley.\n\nTraining completed today.\n\nBy the Pilot.\n\nEverton completed their preparation today with some heading practice, and they will not see a football again until they step on the field at Selhurst. “All fit” was the message I received when I visited Goodison Park. Dunn was being treated by Harry Cooke, who is taking no chances about his shoulder not being perfectly. With a plentiful supply of oils the shoulder was slowly swinging Dunn’s arm around, massaging the while. What they say. Here are the views of the Everton players and officials on the match; –\n\nBen Williams (captain); I think Everton will win. We have the ability and team spirit.\n\nWarney Cresswell; Everything ties for a victory for Everton, and if we can steer clear of bad luck we will pass on to the fifth round.\n\nMcClure; it does not worry us, we will win.\n\nCharlie Gee; Besides preventing Simpson getting goals I shall try for a goal myself.\n\nJack Thomson; it looks a good win for us.\n\nTed Critchley; We are told that the ground is large, and that will suit us. I think we shall prove too good for the Londoners.\n\nJimmy Dunn; as long as we do not worry about it, but just take things slow and surely it will be our match. I want to get a couple of early goals, as we did against Swansea, and them we shall go all the windows in at Crystal Palace.\n\nDixie Dean; Crystal Palace –and Pipe down Palace,\n\nTrainer Harry Cooke; it’s Everton for round five.\n\nTom McIntosh (Secretary), I think the utmost reline in the boys, and we will win.\n\nGee, who is taking tips from Dean and Griffiths in regard to heading, says that Simpson cannot score unless he gets the ball. Ben Williams and Warney Cresswell are unperturbed by the reports from Selhurst that the Palace have two fine wingmen. Warney is already thinking moves ahead. Clarke, smiles and says; “Wait and see.”\n\nEVERTON’S BID.\n\nJanuary 24 th 1931. Liverpool Post and Mercury.\n\nBy John Peel Merseyside’s hope is centred in Everton, and on their displays during the season they are worthy representatives of a great centre of football. The exacting School of the Second Division has had a hardening effect on the team’s methods, as it were, and though the record of Crystal Palace in the Southern Section of the Third Division commands respect. I shall be greatly surprised if Everton are beaten. The team, fore and all, is well-balanced, and, with Dean returning to his best form, they seem to be in line, for the fifth round. Still Cup warfare is full of pitfalls, and Crystal Palace on their own ground at Selhurst will make a bold bid for victory. As Second Division leaders, Everton are undoubtedly a power, and with Dunn again in the side, I look to the Goodison team to win today.

Liverpool Post and Mercury.\n\nDean’s bag of Four.\n\nEverton Revenge after ten years.\n\nPlayers who stood out in Rout of the Palace .\n\nEverton won 6-0 at the Crystal Palace ground before 36,000 spectators. The hundreds who went from Liverpool were able to say they had taken part in the act of revenge, for a famous defeat sustained by Everton at their own ground in 1922, when Crystal Palace pranced around the Everton stars and went home with the joy of a 6-0 victory. The result nearly wrecked the Everton board of directors, and some of the players caught the blow in the signing on season. On Saturday the two clubs came together again, and by a trick of fate Everton won by the exact margin that had been their grave failing –6-0. So was retribution complete. Candidly, the victory was always seemingly possible throughout the course of play, but when the game had gone to within five minutes of the full score no one present imagined the score could reach the half-dozen. It seemed impossible as well, as improbable, but so badly had the Palace team become after their labours and extra time against reading the previous Monday, that they tired to break-up point and the effect was to provide goals in the closing minutes Johnson, our best forward, spite score register, getting his full deserves when he scored with practically the last kick of the game.\n\nIn Suspense.\n\nEverton do not know defeat, they played with the assurance and powerness hardly warranted, for this season; Palace were a poor side in most departments, and when Everton won the toss, and took the value of a very strong wind, there should have been more than a goal lead to the visiting side. It is quite true that Everton have so many of their games, through waiting and weaving out the first half fury of their winds but in moment play have begun to take a goal crop in the first half when they had the chance. Everton did not do this on Saturday, and as a consequence they kept their supporters on tenterhooks for a long spell. In fact I would go so far as to say they were unsatisfactory as a side. The defence was excellent throughout, but while the half-back line was included to dribble unnecessarily and closely when short. But methods should have been adopted the forward line did not knit properly. They were certainly not “hitting it,” and this in spite of the admirable methods adopted by Johnson and the continued effort of the working centre-forward, Dean, who never created his endeavours to head a goal. Dean needed much watching, and well though he scored in the register –he took four, and with Wilde putting through his own goal he was stopped taking five out of the total of six –I would put Johnson down as having given his best game since he left Manchester City. He had the control and methods by which the Palace armour was damaged. Their backs always did well in the awkward circumstances of having a second team goalkeeper and a reserve half-back to pull them from their previously high estate. I think the home backs permit high praise. The goalkeeper had missed fire more than once; he had been effected by the occasion, and doubtless the name of Dean was a nightmare to him. He had made some good saves, and had his bit of fortune. But he could not take it with him. Reserves team goalkeepers called up for big matches in the cup series are either dramatic successes or arrant failures? Imrie was not a failure, he just did not connect, and his comrades felt that he might fail; hence their endeavour to shield him, which cost him a goal and nearly three.\n\nDean’s Easy Goals.\n\nDean’s goals came with some degree of easy. His first was a present from the half-back, McClure, who became a sixth forward, and getting the defence tangled, opened a way for Dean to head in. This was the vital goal of the day, (it came when Everton had become slip shod, and had remembrances of Cup-tie crashes that have been their lot in London after they have had most of the play. Once the second half had started we could see Palace had gone dry, they had some shots at Coggins, and found him very dependable, but the game soon lost its point and purpose. Dean took his second through a solo dribble of very few yards against two defenders and a bewildered goalkeeper, and the third followed a case of Wilde putting through his own goal in trying to stop the ball going to Dean. The Everton centre’s this was a prime sample of his heading; his fourth was close in, and Johnson made the score-sheet bear a memorable margin –6-0. However, it must not go unchallenged. One wondered whether Dunn’s reappearance had been hurried a week too soon. He seemed shy of the tackle, and much of his passing went astray. He had his shots at goal, and two were near the mark; the remainder were not successful. His partner too, had variable moments, and the poor moment rather frequently. Best of all was Johnson, with Dean’s goal-getting ramp a personal triumphant against backs, who knew not how to stem the torrent of his goals.\n\nSuccess of Young players.\n\nThe greatest pleasure of the tie was the way the young half-backs played. Gee at centre half, took quits a dominating influence over the crack Third Division goal-scorer, Simpson, a more than useful player who had no one to aid him in his side. One was clever, fast and his methods of passing was full of value. Not only did McClure make the first goal but formed a good link with the forwards, and possibly both these men did too much dribbling when they found they could weave pattering and show “forward” notions. It was a dangerous game, and the young men must remember that such artistry is not called for in the knock-out competition. At back, Cresswell and Williams did all that was necessary. Cresswell was a joy; Williams did specially well when one remembers he wanted to cry-off through an attack of the flu, on the morning of the match. He had so, go straight to bed when the game was over, and it is plain he will not be able to play in the League game at Port Vale today.\n\nEverton’s Extra Player.-Coggins Sentry\n\nCoggins did four very special things, and will always remember the game for the outburst on the part of a spectator who leaped the rails and almost unseen by anyone, police in particular, took off his coat and hat and them threw the latter in the back of the goal as per goalkeeping notice and stayed sentry by Coggins for fully two minutes. The referee was called upon to decide what to do, and the man was removed. It was a funny situation in a game that had many dull moments owing to the character of play. Everton swept through the Palace with great easy later on, and that was how a escape that did not produce score than one goal. By fifty-four minute finally become a rout. I was a clean game; but Palace lost time of their best forward when Turner left the field five minutes before the end. He had been damaged some time, and as a consequence the home team had played their lively winger Harry as inside forward instead of outside right. Palace eventually outplayed had to bow to superior football, and much better finishing.\n\nTeams; Everton ; – Coggins, goal; Williams (captain) and Cresswell, backs; McClure, Gee, and Thomson, half-backs; Critchley, Dunn, Dean Johnson and Stein, forwards.\n\nCrytsal Palace; – Imrie, goal; Crilly and Charlton (captain), backs; Rivers, Wilde, and Wilcockson, half-backs; Harry, Turner, Simpson, Butler, and Clarke, forwards.\n\nPORT VALE 1 EVERTON 3\n\nJanuary 27 th 1931. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nMore points for Everton.\n\nPort Vale players breaks a leg\n\nLively Incident at Burslem\n\nBy “Bee.” Everton won again yesterday, and by beating Port Vale they made their position at the head of the League table still more “settled” towards the championship. It was a very hard game at Port Vale. Burslem turned out about 10,000 strong, and while the locals had a reserve left wing at their command, the leaders had their usual side, their captain, Williams, determining that he would play in spite of his undoubtedly poor state of health. Everton won 3-1, but the score does not tell how difficult was their task. Indeed the game was not won until very late in the ninety minutes of strenuous hard fought effort. It was not a dirty game, but it was essentially a very keen and hard game, and it must be conceded that the home side had all the misfortunes that were passing.\n\nSpencers Misfortune.\n\nThey lost Spencer, their outside left, shortly before half-time with a broken leg –near the ankle. This was a severe blow, because in 1931 it is well nigh impossible for any side to win or even draw with depleted forces. Port Vale rallied under their difficulty, and they made stern endeavours to get on terms. The score at the interval was 1-1. It was well in the game when the leading goal was scored, and as Critchley scored with a smashing drive right on the close of play the score suggests something that was not justified by the way play went. Port Vale had beaten Everton at Goodison Park –their only home defeat -early in the season after leading by two goals, so Everton during the weekend, worked off two revengeful acts.\n\nUnusual Incident.\n\nTalking of revenge reminds me that this game was somewhat noteworthy in view of the incident that occurred during the early portion of the second half. McClure had made a strong kick towards keeping the ball out of touch. A Port Vale player fell at the same time and the ball struck him on the head. Possibly the local trainer, Holford, had his temperament troubled by the break which led to Spencer being taken to the local infirmary. At any rate, Holford no sooner reached the scene of the distress of this second occurrence than he did something to players not concerned in any injury to lead a linesman to take notice and report the occurrence to the referee, Mr. Smith of Ashton-under-Lyne. This was a strange scene –the second uncommon and almost unprecedented some Everton defence had suffered in the week-end, and while the one invasion was a comic one, this was more serious.\n\nFrom this point there was a lot of spleen in the nature of the game. There were bumps of venom developing in the players minds, and the game as a consequence merely became hard and unruly rather then desperate. Port Vale merit sympathy and much appreciation for the way they fought against odds and a medicum of misfortune, but the standard of play taken during the whole afternoon showed Everton just on top of their rivals, whose backs played well and had a good goalkeeper at their backs. Everton all round played good, hard football, and as usual, were just about to show their second half revival, when the McClure incident occurred. The young half-back, who had done so well, was plainly upset by the course of events, and consequently he petend out a little, while Thomson ran into a strong and quick and virile right wing.\n\nGee’s Surpreme Skill.\n\nGee, however, kept a tight hold upon the mercurial Jennings, and his display was quite the best he has given. He has a most startling confidence –and he has a belief in a ground pass that is not at all common. He passes to his wing half-back or to his full back, and when he gets into a defensive vein he does not merely kick away anywhere –he has control of the ball that allows him to move it hither and thither with Supremes joy and cleverest –if it is not overdone, as a work of defence rather than a habit of self-complacence. So far so good –very good, indeed –that is the verdict in the case of his young, strong fast half-back, whose use of the ball in one of his greatest features. None did better in these bot raids than Cresswell, who has never had to steady and successful a season. Coggins was beaten once –he is playing his part manfully, and the ball that beat him sent in by Roberts was fast and touched the goalpost before it entered the net. It was a well-gotten goal by a lively forward line that swept the ball from wing to wing. After that the Port Vale forwards were unsteady in front of goal –none more so than Jennings, while Marshall fell into the same disfavour working the ball well close in, yet shooting moderately. There was much moderate shooting in the game. Everton were the chief sinners –rarely does Dean miss three gilt-edged chances of scoring such as he lt. slide by in this game. Once he had but to stretch out his leg to make the game safe. He also ballooned a ball badly, as did Stein, but Stein in this a quiet day for him had a shaking up through a throw towards the railings, which are far too near the touchline at this ground. Johnson was again our best and most consistent forward, and Dunn, having got over his fear about his shoulder, had a moderate first half, but kept Critchley moving very sweetly in the second half, and the sequel to this was a great goal scored by the extreme winger who like Stein, hits a ball very hard. Critchley’s goal on time was the work of an artist and a finisher. Dunn helped him, and the scorer banged the ball into the net with such force that few of the spectators knew the ball was at the back of the net.\n\nEarly Defeat Reversed.\n\nDean worried a good deal; he had to take strong defenders and he appeared to me a trifle rattled, and this is a means by which his surely in front of goal is lost. However, he scored the second point to take the lead eight minutes from the final whistle. Critchley having scored the opening point in simple and easy fashion in eight minutes through Johnson’s kind invitation. By winning at Burslem, Everton repaid their early defeat from this side. It took them a long time to shake off this undoubtedly strong eleven, whose Round at centre-half has the height and the stretch to combat the best of forwards, and whose backs, Oakes in particular, are more than average Second Division backs. Oakes appeared tired through cup-tie effort at Birmingham. There is no doubt about his ability. Griffiths was the home side’s best forward, with Roberts a good helpmate. It was Roberts was equalised the score in thirteen minutes. Everton will not have a more difficult match this season –I place it in front of the terrors that came through the home and away games with West Bromwich Albion.\n\nTeams; – Everton; – Coggins, goal; Williams (captain) and Cresswell, backs; McClure, Gee, and Thomson, half-backs; Critchley, Dunn, Dean, Johnson and Stein, forwards.\n\nPort Vale; – Davies, goal; Shenton and Oakes, backs; Cope, Round and Jones half-backs; Griffiths, Roberts, Jennings, Marshall and Spencer, forwards.\n\nEVERTON 4 BRADFORD CITY 2\n\nFebruary 2nd 1931. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nthe Grip Tightens\n\nEverton Prevail in Strong Finish\n\nBradford City Mastered after Rally Everton strengthened that grip on the League leadership when they beat Bradford City 4-2 under conditions that could hardly have been worse. The ground had been rendered particularly soft on top, and was quickly churned up into a sea of mud and water. That play was so good was a tribute to the stamina and skill of the players, and Everton came though the feat with credit. Their period in the second division has involved a variety of experiences, and under the exceptionally difficult conditions of Saturday they beat a typical Second Division side. It was a grim vigorous non-stop type of game yet there were times when play reached a fairly good standard.\n\nDirect Methods.\n\nBradford are a side that trouble little about fitness. They employ direct methods without frills. Occasionally vigour overreaches disorganisation, and more than once the referee cautioned players, on the Yorkshire side. Everton had much the better of the first half, and their two goals lead at the interval was justified. Then followed a Yorkshire revive, and goals by Hallows at fifty minutes and Peel at sixty minutes equalised those scored in the first half, by Dean and McClure. Hereabouts Bradford produced their best work and play was fairly even. Both sides strove gamely for the lead, and for a time the issue hung in the balance with many narrow escapes. At seventy-one minutes, however, Dunn but Everton ahead again, and a fourth goal by Gee two minutes from the end gave Everton a win they well deserved. They never made the mistake of holding the ball too long, and much of their passing was very accurate, considering the state of the ground. Bradford too, made few mistakes, although Everton superior skill turned the scale.\n\nCook’s Display.\n\nThere was no better back on the field than Cresswell. He was cool, and confident under very trying conditions, while Cook who made his first appearance in the senior side did well, especially in the first half. The Everton half-backs were a sound and solid line. McClure was a great worker, always where the fight was hardest, he was effective in both defence and attack, while Gee and Thomson were little inferior. Dean had a good first half when he made some capital openings, although he was not so prominent afterwards. Johnson was the pick of the line. His passes were well timed, and he frequently drew the Bradford defence very skillfully. Dunn left the field injured a few minutes before the end. He played a useful part in Everton’s attack with, however, being as elusive as he can be. Bradford were well served by Peachy, Keetley, Peel, and Scriven .\n\nTeams;- Everton; – Coggins, goal; Cook and Cresswell, backs; McClure, Gee, and Thomson, half-backs; Critchley, Dunn, Dean (captain), Johnson, and Stein, forwards.\n\nBradford City; – Gill, goal; Patridge and Bicknell, backs; Moore, Preachy and Bauld, half-backs; Cochrane, Keetley, Hallows, Peel and Scriven forwards.\n\nCHARLTON ATHELTIC 0 EVERTON 7\n\nFebruary 9 th 1931. Liverpool Post and Mercury.\n\nGoals from every Forward.\n\nHow Everton swamped Charlton.\n\nBy “Bee.” Charlton expected 40,000 spectators to their ground on Saturday for the visit of Everton. Perhaps it was well that there was only 17,000, because the game turned into an avalanche of attacks and many goals against the home side, and the effect upon the enthusiasm of the locals would not be very helpful. Yet in this, the greatest victory Everton have obtained for many seasons, the Charlton men deserve credit for refusing to exploit the off-side game. There was no debate about any point scored in the furious portion of the play when Everton, having tasted a gaol in twenty minutes, made it six before half-time. Such rapid scoring was due to two causes –the amazing strength of shot and the fine fashion of weaving they way through the Charlton side. The result was 7-0. It could have been twice the number. Everton eased up and remembered they had a cup-tie next Saturday at Goodison Park –the first for five years. They were kind in their mind. The game really needs little discussion. It was thoroughly one-sided; it was won after twenty minutes of “fencing,” and then Everton had their inspired period when they scored almost at will. They have lately developed a scoring habit, but this was a glut the like of which they had not shown us this season. At Swansea their form had been delightful and the margin good; against Charlton they were better still, and when one compares the Crystal Palace cup-tie score with their latest score, one has to remember that Crystal Palace are Third Division and they had ten man for a time, and the side also had a try-on half-back.\n\nSurprised Outburst.\n\nThis was a win about which there could be nothing but glittering praises for the winners. It was an astonishing outburst of goal-getting, the most colourful feature of the margin being the fact that all but one of the goals came from extraordinarily fast shooting. Twice the ball was hit was a ferocity that lad it to bound out of goal into play again. It was the sort of forward play Everton people have yearned for, for many a season; the sort that was lacking in recent First Division appearances. Having beaten Charlton 7-1 at Goodison, Everton’s margin is 14-1. The Charlton side had their chances in the second half when Everton plainly rested on their oars, but Coggins was them in brilliant form, and three of his saves were of rare merit. The basis of Everton’s win, however, was the brilliance of the forward line. They saved their half-backs and backs a lot of work by definite combined football that brooked no denial. The craft of Dunn and Johnson was allied to the stern, sure heading and shooting and passing of Dean. Johnson was varied in his feeling qualities –he would gave Critchley a number of wide swinging passes; he and the able Thomson linked up with Stein in a manner they recalled the famous Sunderland left triangle.\n\nVaried Style.\n\nStein, varied his style with shots crossing the goal mouth; indeed it was most fortunate for the home side that he had not taken three when the final whistle went. The first half was naturally the big portion of play after that the game was bound to drag a bit. On the right forward flank Critchley scored, but he had a bad habit of over-indulgence in the dallying business, and by this means he not only courted injury, but also allowed the defence to get settled for any centre he could deliver. However, it would be churlish to be hyper-critical with such a margin put up away from home, and it must be said that here was a team that won by scientific measures, and by expert football, the ball being kept where it was supposed to be kept –on the turf. It was holding turf, but compared with Goodison Park; it was good turf, and it had its greasy portions. The display of the whole Everton side drew from the London spectators high encomiums –they were lavish in their praise, but never exaggerated the value of the visiting side. They could not say too much in favour of the winners.\n\nThe Goals.\n\nThe goal-getting was a small portion of the excellence of the side. Gee came near scoring with the ball that it hit the crossbar, and there were other woodwork cases that kept the score down in rational proportions. McClure was hard and sure and near the finish a trifle too near the dividing line between a fair and a foul charge, and Thomson on the left had no equal –a delicious game. There is nothing to be said of Cresswell and Williams-they were just their normal selves. The goal register reads. Stein scored 20 minutes, Dean 22, Dunn 28, Critchley 30, Johnson 37, Dean 44, Dean 87.\n\nTeams; – Charlton; – Robertson, goal; Langford and Searle, backs; Pitcairn, Pritchard, and Morgan half-backs; Wyper, Astley, Whitlow, McKay, and Hutton, forwards.\n\nEverton; – Coggins, goal; Williams (captain) and Cresswell, backs; McClure, Gee and Thomson, half-backs; Critchley, Dunn, Dean, Johnson, and Stein, forwards.\n\nEVERTON 5 GRIMSBY TOWN 3\n\nFebruary 16 th 1929. Liverpool Post and Mercury.\n\nEverton Rally to Win\n\nTough Tussle with Grimsby Town\n\nHome Forwards the Deciding Force\n\nBy “Bee.”\n\nEverton have been away from Goodison Park for five years of Cup struggle, and, returning on Saturday, they were heralded by a crowd of 65,534. Representing £4,801, and producing 73 cases of attention by the St. John Ambulance Brigade two of the number being sent to hospital through the squeezing process at the bottle-neck between the two stands at Goodison-road. Everton did not play as a team as well as they had done at Crystal Palace. Charlton, or Swansea. There was a distinct drop in the work of Gee and McClure, while Cresswell made an error that left him sad at heart as the team left the field at half-time. Gee produced his best, and the form that made him famous, in the last ten minutes. McClure had a collision, and was not the dependable sure tackler that he has been in the last four weeks, yet Everton beat Grimsby 5-3, thereby adding to their list of revengeful acts this season with teams that have made them smart under the previous meetings.\n\nDangerous Raids.\n\nThe Everton forward line won this game. Grimsby were always apparently extremely dangerous when they broke away, yet this was contradicted by the remembrance that three Everton players were below standard, and Coggins had little to do. It was possibly fear of Grimsby forwards, not belief in them, and the outstanding line of this memorable Cup-tie was centred in the Everton forward line working in beautiful concerted action. The fluctuation certainly added zest to the game, and the big crowd that overlooked beyond the barriers had full value for its money. Grimsby scored first –that was the first surprise, and all against the trend of the play when Coleman placed the ball into the corner of the net at 15 minutes. Everton were not perturbed, and Stein quickly nullified this point with a goal at 17 minutes, the result of a terrific drive, while 3 minutes later the same player put them ahead following a half save by Read when he stopped, but failed to clear a shot by Johnson.\n\nDean Heads Through.\n\nEverton justified their lead, and although Grimsby struggled hard it was due mainly to the good work of their defence that they kept their goal form further disaster till Dean headed through from a centre by Stein at 38 minutes. A lead of 3-1 seemed good enough to wit, and it was not more than Everton deserved. Then came a goal to Grimsby that few were prepared for. Bestall scoring at 44 minutes later by a goal by Marshall that made the game all square 3-3 –at the interval. Thus the contest fluctuated remarkably in a very short period, and what had looked like an easy win for Everton meant more hard labour with the result again in the balance. Everton, however, tackled the problem with grim earnestness, and although it was not until the 77 th minute that Johnson gave them the lead again it seemed only a question of how long the Grimsby defence could withstand the persistent hammering of the Everton forwards.\n\nJohnson Settles the Issue.\n\nTen minutes from the end, Dean was brought down near goal, and from the penalty kick , which followed Johnson, scored with ease. That was the end of Grimsby’s hopes. Throughout they played with great spirit and a fair amount of skill. They had the tonic effect of the first goals and two goals near the interval that were hardly justified on the play. Yet Everton triumphed by superior craft and a confidence that refused to be subdued even when goals did not materialise as expected. It was good thrilling football and at times Everton touched their best form. Of the forwards Johnson was outstanding. Many of Everton’s best movements were engineered by Johnson, and he frequently shot well. Dunn did not quite reach the form that has made him as prominent in recent games, but he did much neat and effective work. Obviously Dean was marked for special attention, although that did not prevent him being a trustful and clever leader, while Stein and Critchley were smart and dangerous raiders. Thomson was the most satisfactory performer in the middle line and Williams was better than Cresswell although both did a fair amount of good work. Cresswell, however, seemed to be at fault when Marshall equalised a minute from the interval. The work of Coggins was simple when compared with that of Read, who was one of Grimsby’s success. Many daring and clever saves were credited to Read, while Johnson was a sound back. Others who did well were Hall, Bestall, and Prior.\n\nTeams; – Everton; – Coggins, goal; Williams (captain) and Cresswell, backs; McClure Gee, and Thomson, half-backs; Critchley, Dunn, Dean, Johnson, and Stein forwards.\n\nGrimsby Town; – Read, goal; Wilson and Jacobson, backs; Hall, Priestly (captain), Buck, half-backs; Prior, Bestall, Coleman, Copper, and Marshall, forwards.\n\nEVERTON 5 BARNSLEY 2\n\nFebruary 19 th 1931. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nEverton’s Non Stop run\n\nLeaders Reach 99 League Goals.\n\nDean’s Supreme Moments in Barnsley Match\n\nTommy Johnson Penalty Sent Wide, and Bar and Post also hit.\n\nBy “Bee.”\n\nThere is no stopping those Everton forwards. They appear to be able to score at will. Nothing daunts them; nothing worries then; they march on towards the net of the opposition and score readily; so readily that they are really in danger of taking things too easily. Against Barnsley, the team that beat Sheffield Wednesday out of the English Cup, they went an even way for a long time. They thought nought of a seemingly good goal by Dean being put down as offside. This was a more detail. They would go on to collect some more. They got five, they missed a penalty kick thanks to Johnson slicing his drive, (Dean won penalty after Caddick grassed him) and they hit the upright and crossbar . But they could not get the one goal to make this game into a notable one by reason of the hundredth League goal of the season being recorded.\n\nElusive Century Mark\n\nThe crowd of 20,000 year end for the goal called for the goal, and the Everton players caught the spirit of desire. They fought hard in the last few moments of play to try to gain their three-figure mark, but it did not come chiefly through a personal desire of two extremes wing men to get a goal when a pass inward would have been fatal to the Barnsley goalkeeper, Crompton who had his strokes of fortune and had played really well against an avalanche of attacks. So the result stood 5-2 and Everton have to wait a few days longer before they attain their desire and then go on to break the record of 120 goals. It was surprising there should be any difficult about getting six in this mid-week game. They were there for the asking, the defence of Barnsley being overrun. Let us see how the game progressed; dean got two, gave two –to Dunn, came near taking a bunch of goals for his own clever self, and Critchley added another goal. The response was provided by Proundfoot, a clever young forward, who scored both goals credited to the plucky Barnsley side.\n\nSound half-backs.\n\nSome good fortune to the Everton defenc, which packed its goal early on, stopped Barnsley getting more goals. But the result was sufficiently unbalanced as it was. The score and the margin give no indication of the Everton forwards and half-backs. In defence, Everton were not so good –the goalkeeper had little to do and might have saved the first surprise goal, and Cresswell was not so good as usual, yet the half-backs McClure and Gee were incontestably their true selves yesterday, whereas in the cup-tie versus Grimsby they had been below par. McClure is suffering a calf muscle injury; but his speed is not impaired, and one of his solo runs right into the goalmouth might have brought a penalty kick for a sweeping tackle –of which he knows a good deal, because he is relentless in his tacklers. However, the margin was sufficient to carry Everton nine points in front of their nearest rival and they are sailing to promotion. Barnsley played Caddick usually a wing half-back, at centre half-back –thus he met a former club mate in Dean. Caddick strove hard to bring the defence into a proper positioning and playing the ball, but they were all powerless to stop the conquering Dean, who gave one of his brightest, fastest displays, and also one of his most unselfish games. His heading was as is usual with him, deadly and accurate, causing the ball to pass to a point at which his fellow forwards were about to advance.\n\nSkill of Dunn\n\nDunn did much skilled work too, and the left wing was a trifle below its big style, chiefly through Stein having a day when his centre pulled outside. By the same token Critchley wasted many good chances by weak centring. However, with the improved form of Gee and McClure, added to the steadiness and sure touch of Thomson, the team gave little throught to trifle until the crowd urged them to take the hundred. Barnsley’s best were Keen trying defenders, a lively goalkeeper Caddick at centre-half back, and a bright right wing in Proudfoot and Ashton, but the whole side was over powered by the brilliance of Dean and the general facility with which the forward line swept through the visitors by means of first class football skill. The Everton forward line can win these matches by its own unequalled brilliance; it is up to the defence to consolidate its position a little better than during the last two games.\n\nTeams; – Everton; – Coggins, goal; Williams (captain) and Cresswell, backs; McClure, Gee, and Thomson, half-backs; Critchley, Dunn, Dean, Johnson, and Stein, forwards.\n\nBarnsley; – Crompton, goal; Dixon and Richards, backs; Smith, Caddick, and James, half-backs; Wallbanks, Ashton, Proudfoot, J.

Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nNotts Forest make a Fight\n\nEverton Top Century Mark\n\nTommy Johnson scored Everton’s 100 League Goal\n\nBy “Bees.”\n\nEverton’s spectators have become greedy. They look upon the margin of two as trifling, but if they would cast their minds back to the filthy conditions of the ground on Wednesday and Saturday, they would realise that the Goodison mud is taking its toll of the stamina of the players. On Saturday about 30,000 people gave no thought to the remembrance of Wednesday’s hard work, and they went there believing that Nottingham Forest would be mowed down. This was all against what anyone could expect if they had been witness at the game at Nottingham, where Everton drew, for Notts Forest had thrown away four bright chances of scoring in the first half. The difficulty of play at Goodison Park is abnormal even for the players who appear there every fortnight. The ball and the ground are so heavy that it is very unfair to be hypercritical. The referee on Saturday received the ball on the back of the neck when Dexter, the goalkeeper kicked the ball towards the centre of the field after Dunn had scored. The weight of the\n\nball led to the referee collapsing semi-conscious.\n\nLofting the Ball to Dean.\n\nSo long was the first goal in arriving that when it did come to signal Everton’s 100 th goal of the season the crowd had become lethargy. They had lost their enthusiasm. They did not know any more than did Dean that he wanted but one goal to celebrate his 200 th League goal in five and a half seasons off senior football. Far, too often was the ball put upwards lofted towards Dean for a leaping Forest defenders to head away. McClure, Gee, and Thomson played extremely well, and the defence showed improvement upon the last two occasions they have appeared at home. It simply amounted to this –that the Everton forwards could not quite connect with the goal register. Yet they scored twice and hit the woodwork twice so that the margin is hardly just. This does not for a moment deny the Nottingham players praise for their unavailing plucky display; one which led the crowd to show their appreciation of their work when they left the field –a fine tribute to a gallant team and –testimony to the Everton spectators sportsmanship. They reached the They reached the century, however, when Johnson scored the first goal at 53 minutes, and Dunn’s goal at 66 minutes carried the League goal total for the season to 101. While the game was never a bad one, it was not one of the best probably because Everton did not touch what has come to be regarded as their usual standard, and that Forest played with great plucky right through, even when they lost Pugh early in the second half.\n\nAccurate Play Impossible.\n\nThen again the ground was not a great deal short of being unfit so that accurate play was almost impossible. The players had to chance a lot even when taking ordinary passes because the ball often unexpectedly stopped dead. Although Nott’s fought earnestly and Everton’s goal was a long time coming one never got the impression that Everton would lose the game. At times Nott’s threatened a lot, and they had a particularly good period midway in the first half without having a great deal to show for they energy. Everton could not claim much advantage in this respect although they found a fair amount of work for Dexter in the Nott’s goal. They should, however, considering their chances have taken the lead much earlier. Time and again they worked out good openings only to fail at goal. Sometimes it was poor shooting, and as others good work on the part of the Nott’s defence. If there were many exasperating mistakes due chiefly to the sticky mud, there were a fair number of clever touches. Without doubt Everton were the better side.\n\nA fine Half-Back.\n\nThey attacked for the major portion of the game, and more deadness near goal would have brought the usual crop of goals. Six minute after the start Dean sent a great shot against the upright, and in the second half Johnson centre, Dunn struck the crossbar. Everton where sound and a solid defence while the best man on the Nott’s side if not in the game was Graham in the pivot position. He got more of the ball than any other player and knew well how to use it. A great worker he covered a wide area in the middle and played so well right through. Everton, too, had a sound defence and if both Williams and Creswell took more risks than usual they were no doubt conscious of their ability to recovery as actually they did. A fair amount of good work came from the middle line where Thomson was the notable performer. It was not one of Dean’s best days. Few opportunities came for a clean break through, but he gave fine chances to both Dunn and Johnson and they responded effectively. Critchley and Stein have often been better, and for a time in the second half, the latter was rather neglected.\n\nTeams; Everton; – Coggins, goal.

A native of Bristol. It’s a case of “all hands on deck” when Coggins is guarding the net. Thoroughly “able body.”\n\nBen Williams (Right back and captain)\n\nDiscovered playing on the coal heaps at Penrhiwceiber. Has done almost as well in the boxing ring as on the football field. A Welsh International who came to Goodison Park from Swansea. The ideal captain; the ideal player.\n\nWarney Cresswell (Left back)\n\nLong headed and level headed, Warney. Makes football look easy. Once told me he loved Second Division football because “they give you the ball.” A brilliant positional player who makes his brain save his feet. Another international and still one of England’s best defenders.\n\nJoe McClure (Right half)\n\nA few weeks back was regarded as a Central League player. Opportunity knocked at his door once and that was sufficient for Joe. Hails from Workington; the son of a famous footballer. A real find.\n\nCharlie Gee (Centre-half)\n\nLike Critchley, comes from Stockport. He still loves Stockport as much as he does Everton and Swimming. A champion water polo player.\n\nJock Thomson (Left Half)\n\nThe dour Scot. Everton got him from Dundee after all the directors, scouts and staff had watched him. Wish they had secured him after the first view now.\n\nTed Critchley (Outside-Right)\n\nAnother from Stockport County. One of the fastest wingers in the game. Has a director who “fathers” him and applies the slipper when he makes a mistakes.\n\nJimmy Dunn (Inside Right)\n\nDiminutive, dainty, dapper, deceptive, deft, delightful. Dunn is the Maskelyne and Devantt of Everton. Can produce all sorts of schemes from “his pocket” while opponents look on. One of the magic five who dumbfounded England at Wembley three seasons ago. Formerly with Edinburgh Hibernians.\n\nDixie Dean (Centre-forward)\n\nIs England’s best –was always England’s best. The selectors have recognised it again. The greatest header of a ball the game has ever seen. Some called him game has ever seen. One of the greatest personalities football has ever known\n\nTommy Johnson (Inside Left)\n\nThe man who put the spirit into team spirit. Liked by everyone. They say he is best with his left boot. Watch him use his right on the practice ground.\n\nJimmy Stein (Outside left)\n\nAn outside left whose best football is his right. Take notice of this. He was born at Glasgow. Was celebrated even before they named a song after him.\n\nEVERTON 9 SOUTHPORT 1\n\nMarch 2nd 1931. Liverpool Post and Mercury.\n\nEverton Rush to Victory\n\nSouthport Defence Riddled.\n\nThird Division side’s Brave Efforts\n\nSeven goals scored in first half for Everton\n\nby “Bee.” Southport bade a very bad afternoon to the English Cup when they let Goodison Park’s snowflakes on Saturday, after having engaged in a very captivating game, and paid their respects to the team that beat them handsomely and without venom. They scored 9 to 1. I do not think Everton would have scored so many, but Southport got a move on after the interval, took a goal by their regular member in the score sheet –Waterston –and Everton thought they had better take no chances with a team that had been named as a shock side competent to upset the best of opposition. Everton have never gloated over their victories or their margins; they take enough to ensure safety and then “play.” They intended to do this after they had made a lead of seven before half-time, but Southport never ceased their effort, and at times they looked like a very sharp side; a good side; a side with much speed and more pluck and daring. But they played the right sort of football, never condescending to touch the Third Division style as many know it, so that they were to be congratulated upon their methods and upon their keenness.\n\nSouthport Start Well.\n\nNever were there signs of their weakness; they played on as valiantly when a margin of eight divided them with the coming First Division team as when the game started. And be it known, Southport started in a way that was ominous. They shot well; they skirted the touchline; they thought nought of the snow that lay around the corners of the field and made the ball a veritable snowball. They shot so well that nothing but the sound keeping of Coggins prevented them taking the lead. After that the Everton forwards started to work and the meant goals were coming. They appeared to be able to score at will, but the root feature of this big goal crop was the fact that each forward lived for his fellow forwards. The utter unselfishness that has stamped Dean’s game all his life, has led to the other forwards realizing the wisdom of pairing off for goals rather than making single handed efforts. When Dean broke 60 goals in a record making season he made many of the goals –yes most of them –by his own unaided effort. Today he has fine lieutenants beside him. Each goal was more or less the result of an offering of the thankfulness of the part of a fellow forward. Every goal created a shake of the hand from the man who had placed the goal at the scorer’s mercy. And to that fine spirit the slashing shooting that went on against Baker and his overrun backs, and remember that Dunn and Johnson were always schemers, whose work had to be looked into hard to find the true value of it, and you will sense how this forward line would on this showing, have beaten almost any side.\n\nFour for Dean.\n\nDean got four goals, Dunn two, Critchley two, and Johnson got the other apart from Waterston’s consolation stroke. And the best was probably Dean’s master header to make the eight goal of the day. I don’t remember a senior match were seven goals lead has been taken in the first half, unless we go back to the days of the 26-0 score put up by Preston North End against Hyde. Certainly Everton are collecting goals with a rare freedom, and this year to date they have scored 53 goals in cup and League. They make the game look frightfully simple and simply effective by means of the positional play of the line, each of whom has a fine understanding with the rest of the side, what time the half-backs join in with their fine passes along the ground. McClure was hard, Gee was a dribbler, forager, and joyful playmate of the man in front of him; he gave him a squeezed in pass to make one of Dean’s foursome goals, and Stein kept his best for the later stages, when his centring was full of judgement.\n\nSouthport’s Efforts.\n\nWhat of Southport then? Still can I say that Southport did uncommonly well under the circumstances. There was not sure in front of goal; they imagined they had time to spare when they got their golden chances, and therein lay the secret of their being smothered or covered by Williams and Cresswell. I though Vincent played a great game till he tired yet Seagraves was the most consistent of their side. With Holmes not quite so powerful as I have seen him in previous games. Southport were valiant hearts, they had frittering, fitting forwards, with the extreme wings always the most dangerous of the line. Hill giving a uniformly good show throughout the awkward day. At midday the snowstorm threatened to put an end to thoughts of cup-tie strife, but the ground actually played a shade better than usual through the snow falling on the heaps of mud and making it a trifle stickier than usual-hence the ball travelled almost normally. Everton made it do a lot or work, and well as the backs defended in a difficult task, the goalkeeping of Baker was unsettled until half time and then it bore a bright mark.\n\nTeams; – Everton; – Coggins, goal; Williams (captain) and Cresswell, backs; McClure, Gee, and Thomson, half-backs; Critchley, Dunn, Dean, Johnson and Stein forwards.\n\nSouthport; – Baker, goal; Little and Robinson, backs; Seagrave, Vincent, and Holmes, half-backs; Hill, McConnell (captain), Waterston, Cowan, and Roberts, for wards.\n\nAttendance was 45, 647 and receipts of £3, 971.\n\nEVERTON 3 READING 2\n\nMarch 9th 1931. Liverpool Post and Mercury\n\nEverton’s goals Record\n\na narrow win against Reading For the second time in a fortnight Dean sought to obtain the goal needed to make his individual total 200. Again he was denied it, but he helped others to get the goals that gave Everton their 3-2 victory over Reading. It was for Everton a surprisingly narrow margin, and their policy seemed to suggest they were not prepared to risk injury for a big win being satisfied to hold their opponents to a safe victory. Their goals for reached 104, and a new record as the best obtained in any one season. The game with Reading, however, was not impressive, although there were bright patches, that helped to relieve much of the work that was unconvincing. Beyond doubt Everton were not at their best. They found difficulty in controlling the light ball, and if Saturday’s contest could be taken in a guide it would seem they do better on a heavy ground than on a hard dry surface. The conditions were the direct opposite of whose under which recent games have been played, and while Everton probably went for safety, Reading were more venturesome, and in a blank first half had quite as much of the play as Everton. Shortly before the interval Reading lost the services of Eaton who sustained a fractured nose and was taken to hospital for treatment, while seventeen minutes from the end Critchley retired with a damaged ankle. In seven minutes Everton put on three goals, the scorers being Johnson (53 minutes), Dunn (56 minutes), and Critchley (60 minutes). That seemed good enough to carry them to a comfortable victory, but the plucky Reading side, with ten players, strove gallantly and twice Bacon reduced the lead, the fine goal being scored a minute from the end. Dean made many good attempts to get the much-anticipated goal, although his colleagues had difficulty in giving him the ball, especially in the first half. Crossbar intervenes.\n\nDean had better chances afterwards, and his nearest attempt at scoring came five minutes from the end, when he headed against the crossbar. As a distributive agent Dean was up to his usual standard. He timed accurately his passes to the winger and his heading was generally well done. While the forwards as a line were not at their best, they showed how deadly they could be by scoring three in seven minutes, and at that stage the sound Reading defence was badly shaken. The half-backs made an effective line, and the defence generally had the measure of the Reading forwards, Richardson in the Reading goal, impressed with the safe, clean handling, and the backs especially Hodgkiss kicked well. Allan was the best of the middle line, and of the forwards Bailey was a prominent worker .\n\nTeams; Everton; Coggins, goal; Williams (captain) and Cresswell, backs; McClure, Gee, Thomson, half-backs, Critchley, Dunn, Dean, Johnson, and Stein, forwards.\n\nReading; – L.
