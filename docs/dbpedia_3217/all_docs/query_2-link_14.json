        "text": "Another former Michigan State football player is venturing into the music business. A.J. Troup, a Spartan wide receiver from 2011-15, released his debut hip-hop single titled “Let Me Be” featuring Nick Mair on Wednesday.\n\nClick here to hear Troup’s song on iTunes.\n\nTroup got a few Twitter shoutouts from current and former MSU football players for the track.\n\nStarting quarterback Brian Lewerke wrote: “New song is (flame emoji) brotha @troupstar19”\n\nFormer MSU wide receiver Matt Macksood posted: “This boy @troupstar19 out here with a thumper….daaaah pause.”\n\nAnd the mother of former MSU receiver R.J. Shelton tweeted: “SPARTAN NATION Please go support @MSU_Football alum & Spartan Dawg @troupstar19 with his first single”\n\nThe 26-year-old Troup had an unfortunate string of injuries early in his college career, which resulted in him playing sparingly throughout his five seasons in East Lansing.\n\nAfter redshirting in 2011, the 6-foot-2 Troup didn’t make it onto the field during the 2012 season. He provided the highlight of the 2013 spring game, catching a 46-yard game-winning touchdown pass from Andrew Maxwell before an injury shelved him for the entire season. The Minneapolis, Minnesota, native played in 21 games over his final two seasons, catching nine passes for 141 yards.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers running back and former MSU standout Le’Veon Bell has been making music for a while, rapping under the stage name Juice. Bell released his third album, titled “No Announcement,” in February. That project included music video shot in Miami to accompany a track called “Shade Room.” Bell previously released a 16-song album, “Post Interview,” that featured a diss track aimed at Fox Sports 1 commentator Skip Bayless called “Shrimp Bayless,” which gained national attention.\n\n“The response has been amazing,” Bell said of the album in a March interview with Billboard. “I’ve been actually surprised a little -- I’m not gonna say that I didn’t expect it to be good, because I did, but I didn’t expect it to be as good. You know, the feedback has been crazy, the fans really love the songs. I think it’s like a different style than what I’ve been releasing lately, so I’m glad to get the feedback that it has.”\n\nBell went on to tell Billboard he firmly believes he’s the best rapper among professional athletes.\n\n“Oh yeah, hands down,” he said. “I don’t even think it’s close… I can give you lyrical songs, hits, club, strip club, mood music… it’s so much different styles. A lot of guys, like, one lane is what they’re good at.”\n\nStill, Bell told Billboard he didn’t think he was receiving adequate respect for his musical talents among his Steeler teammates in the early stages of his rap career.\n\nWhen asked if he felt his support has increased, Bell said: “A little bit. A little bit. Y’know, I ain’t saying it’s as much as it should be, but it’s been better.”"
