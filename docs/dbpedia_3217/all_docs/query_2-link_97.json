        "text": "Now we’re talking! Third post in a row! It’s nice to get back into the swing of things. The subject of today’s Youth Groups is a band called Crashland. They were from the West Country, and by that I mean Bristol or South Wales, and not, I don’t know, Arizona or some nonsense. In many ways, they’re the perfect band for this thing: a band who came, released an album to not-much-fanfare, and then disappeared. You’d be hard-pressed to find too many people who can remember them, but what matters is, I dug them for a while. That said, the first time I saw them, I wasn’t too impressed. They were on before two bands I was crazy about, Soulwax and Muse, and I gave them the ultimate backhanded compliment: “They’re about as good as a secondary support act should be.” What a dick I was.\n\nLater that year, I had to review their single ‘Modern Animal’, and I liked it very much. It’s upbeat, with a nice lengthy guitar intro, a catchy chorus and nice harmonies. Steve Lamacq often played them on his Radio One show, and would always refer to them as “the tightest power trio in the country”, and not without reason. This was the autumn of 2000, and even then, the band was being referred to as a Britpop throwback, as though people were already nostalgic for something that was still pretty recent.\n\nTwo weeks later, the band’s album 'Glued’ came out, and I really took to it. I did say “Crashland look destined for bigger things on this evidence”, yet another example of me being hopelessly wrong in most of my predictions. After 'Modern Animal’ came 'New Perfume’, another fast, tight, three minute indie-pop stormer.\n\nSpeaking of, the band’s Wikipedia page contains this gem of a sentence (the second one):\n\nTheir debut album Glued, released in 2000 contained 12 tracks. Each are around three minutes in duration, showing their preference for radio-friendly indie tracks, fashionable in the Britpop era.\n\nI’ve been listening again to the album a lot over the past week and there’s nothing here that’ll grab you and make you say “these guys are incredible, where do I sign?” but, you know, it’s a solid album. Of the fast songs, I’ve got time for 'Little Dreams’…\n\n…and, especially 'Standard Love Affair’.\n\nThe band even manages to pull of slower, more reflective songs, in a way that’s not embarrassing. Alex Troup’s vocals work really well on these ballads, particularly on the gorgeous closer 'We’re On Fire’. The band’s last.fm page (that’s right, I research these things) refers to the song as “an acoustic lullaby that deserved to be this generation’s ‘Yesterday’. No, really.” That might be a tad extreme, but it is a very pretty song.\n\nI was 17 when this album came out, and it was fairly generic, but a little more edgy and interesting than most of the other Britpop I was listening to (this is a year after my short-lived romance with the band Straw, for instance), and so 'Glued’ remained (you know what word goes here) to my CD player for quite a while. They went away for a bit, and when they returned, the Strokes had come along, and everything and everyone had to be cool. Crashland’s comeback EP featured a couple of really good songs, like 'Karaoke Ballad’, and the titular ballad 'Devotion’. They had a new, second guitarist, and that made the fast tunes sound a bit more urgent."
