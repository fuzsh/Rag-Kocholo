        "text": "Scottish Curling Academy Selections 2024-25\n\nWe are delighted to announce the athletes selected for the Scottish Curling National and Regional Academy programmes in 2024-25.\n\nOn the men’s side, we welcome two new teams into National Academy. – Team Thomson and Team Craik. Arran Thomson, Stewart Kyle, Sam McConnachie and Lewis McCabe all make the step up from Regional Academy looking to continue their development into their second season together as a team. Season 2023-24 U21 slam winner Rory Macnair will team up with experienced skip Ross Craik. They will be joined by Fraser Swanston, Jonathan Blair and Jake Macdonald, who all make the progression from Regional Academy.\n\nStepping up to National Academy after a fantastic first season together is Team Soutar: Callie Soutar, Eva Hare, Holly Clemie and Alison Hamilton. Team Soutar were runners up in the Scottish Junior Championship and are hoping to go one better this year. Jodi Leigh Bass, Katie Archibald and Alex McMillan will enter their second season together. They welcome Jennifer Jahn into their team, who is progressing from Regional Academy. Cara Davidson, who was formally in the team, has made the step up to British Curling.\n\nTeam Laurie and Team Carson who were both National Academy teams last season have also made the transition from the Academy into the British Curling programme. We wish them all the best for the future. Team Strawhorn players of Jack Strawhorn, Hamish Gallacher and Kaleb Johnston all age out of junior curling.\n\nTwenty-nine individual athletes form the Regional Academy, meaning a total of 46 curlers will be involved in the programmes in 2024-25.\n\n“This will be my second season as Academy Manager, and I am really enjoying working with all the athletes and the coaches within the programme. Over the last couple of weeks all the athletes have had their individual induction meetings to create their new athlete development plan, focussing on their own development and goal setting. It is an exciting time for the programme and I am looking forward to the season ahead” says Scott Andrews\n\nNATIONAL ACADEMY\n\nTEAM CRAIK\n\nRoss Craik\n\nFraser Swanston\n\nJake Macdonald\n\nRory Macnair\n\nJonathan Blair\n\nTEAM THOMSON\n\nArran Thomson\n\nStewart Kyle\n\nSam McConnachie\n\nLewis McCabe\n\nTEAM SOUTAR\n\nCallie Soutar\n\nEva Hare\n\nHolly Clemie\n\nAlison Hamilton\n\nTEAM LEIGH\n\nJodi Leigh Bass\n\nKatie Archibald\n\nJennifer Jahn\n\nAlex McMillan\n\nREGIONAL ACADEMY ATHLETES"
