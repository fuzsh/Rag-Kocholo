        "text": "Players making plays\n\nAL.com's prep sports staff has spent the summer analyzing the best high school players from the last 25 years at various positions, from beefy linemen to super-fast receivers. That dates back to the fall of 1992.\n\nToday, we’ve got the definitive list – the top 25 players of the last 25 years, regardless of position. Do you think we got it right? Let us know in the comments.\n\nYou can also look back at the previous by position rankings:\n\nRELATED: Top 25 WRs of last 25 years\n\nRELATED: Top 25 DBs of last 25 years\n\nRELATED: Top 25 RBs of last 25 years\n\nRELATED: Top 25 QBs of last 25 years\n\nRELATED: Top 25 linemen of last 25 years\n\nRELATED: Top 25 LBs of last 25 years\n\nPhillip Barr | AL.com file\n\n25. Tim Castille, RB/WR/KR, Briarwood Christian\n\nAt Briarwood Christian, Castille was a first-team All-State receiver as an eighth-grader, freshman and sophomore before taking on more ball carrying duties and earning All-State nods as an athlete (junior) and running back (senior). Yep, that makes him the rare five-time All-State player. He ranks third in AHSAA history in both receptions (243, 41 of which went for touchdowns) and receiving yards (4,122). Castille was a member of the Super 12 in 2000, 2001 and 2002. Castille's brother, Simeon, made AL.com's list of the top 25 defensive backs in the past 25 years. Castille went to Alabama and was used mostly as a short-yardage back and he then spent four seasons in the NFL as a fullback.\n\nHal Yeager | AL.com file\n\n24. Rolando McClain, LB, Decatur\n\nMcClain has suffered more than his share of legal problems despite being selected No. 8 overall in the 2010 NFL Draft. But before his off-the-field problems, McClain was a prep star at Decatur. As a senior, he posted 106 tackles and was a Parade All-American. He was also a standout basketball player.\n\nAnd at Alabama, he earned the 2009 Butkus Award as a member of Alabama's BCS national championship team.\n\nJohn David Mercer | AL.com file\n\n23. Jameis Winston, QB, Hueytown\n\nWinston was named Gatorade state player of the year and a Parade All-American after his senior season at Hueytown in 2011 in which he threw for 2,424 yards and 28 touchdowns, and ran for 1,063 yards and 15 scores. He is the only Alabama quarterback to have been selected for the Under-Armour All-America Game. Winston is fourth all-time in career total offense (9,853), sixth in completion percentage (59.5) and tied for 10th in touchdowns accounted for (103). Winston won the Heisman Trophy during a controversy-laden career at Florida State and is currently the starting quarterback for the Tampa Bay Bucs.\n\nPhillip Holman | AL.com file\n\n22. Brodie Croyle, QB, Westbrook Christian\n\nIf not for bad luck, Croyle may hold multiple career passing records. Despite suffering a season-ending ACL tear in the first game of his senior year at Westbrook Christian in 2000, Croyle ranks second all-time in touchdown passes (105), fourth in yards (9,321) and 11th in completions (527). His 3,787 passing yards in 1998 is the fourth-highest single-season total in state history, and his 44 touchdowns that year are tied for the fourth-highest. Croyle set the state record for passing yards in a game that season with 528, a mark that stood until 2005. He signed with Alabama and later played in the NFL.\n\nBernard Troncale | AL.com file\n\n21. Saleem Rasheed, LB, Shades Valley\n\nRasheed starred at Shades Valley in suburban Birmingham, helping the Mounties advance to the Class 6A semifinals. He signed with Alabama and later played in the NFL. But his post-football life hasn't been a fairytale. In 2013, Saleem Rasheed began serving a sentence after pleading guilty to having sex with two students at Woodlawn while he was a teacher at the school.\n\nJoe Songer | jsonger@al.com\n\n20. Mac Campbell, RB, Alexandria\n\nThe 1997 Mr. Football winner is still the AHSAA record holder for yards in a career with 9,839. His career spanned from 1993 to 1997. His best season was his last when he rushed for 2,596 yards for the Valley Cubs. He ran for 2,000 yards or more in three straight seasons. He scored 36 touchdowns as a senior, 37 as a junior and 35 as a sophomore. His 1,157 career carries are a state record and his 153 TDs is second only behind Wadley's Terrance Wilkes. He was the Class 4A Player of the Year in three straight seasons. He signed with UAB.\n\nAL.com file\n\n19. Justin Tuck, TE/DL, Central-Coosa\n\nAt tiny Central-Coosa in Rockford, the 6-foot-5, 215-pound Tuck was known as a high-flying basketball player who happened to earn All-State and Super 12 honors in 2000. He played on both sides of the ball, excelling as a tight end and defensive end/linebacker. He signed with Notre Dame, added 50 pounds and became a pass-rushing defensive end and set a Notre Dame record with 24½ career sacks. He won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants and finished his NFL career with 66½ sacks.\n\nChip English | AL.com file\n\n18. D.J. Fluker, OL, Foley\n\nFluker rose to prominence as a sophomore defensive lineman at McGill-Toolen, but a family move and Hurricane Katrina left him in Foley. A massive 6-foot-6, 350-pounder, he was named a Parade and U.S. Army All-American. He then went on to a standout career at Alabama, became a first-round NFL draft pick and remains in the NFL today.\n\nMike Kittrell | AL.com file\n\n17. Reese Dismukes, OL, Spanish Fort\n\nWhen Spanish Fort won its first state title in 2010, the Spanish Fort offense basically followed big No. 75. A road-grading run blocker from his center position, he finished runner-up in Mr. Football balloting. Dismukes signed with Auburn and won the Rimington Award as the nation's top center. He then spent time on NFL practice squads for Pittsburgh, Carolina and Denver.\n\nJohn David Mercer | AL.com file\n\n16. JaMarcus Russell, QB, Williamson\n\nRussell is the AHSAA's all-time leader in passing yards with 10,774. He led Williamson to the state title game as a freshman. Following his senior season in 2002, Russell was named Mr. Football, Gatorade state player of the year and Parade All-American. He signed with Nick Saban at LSU and was later the overall No. 1 draft pick in the NFL, but washed out of the league quickly and is considered one of the biggest busts in pro football history.\n\nDennis Victory | preps@al.com\n\n15. Marlon Humphrey, DB, Hoover\n\nHumphrey was a Parade and Under-Armour All-American for the Bucs in 2013. He was a three-time first-team ASWA All-State selection and helped Hoover to state titles in both 2012 and 2013. As a senior, he registered 44 tackles, three interceptions and four pass breakups. He intercepted four passes as a junior and six as a sophomore, three of which he returned for touchdowns.
