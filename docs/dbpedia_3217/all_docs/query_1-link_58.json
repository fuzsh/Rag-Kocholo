The first 10 pieces were for the 1980 US Olympic Team – he has worked with every US Olympic team since. Athletes who have used his work include 2016 Olympic Gold Medalist, Aly Raisman, 2012 London Games Gold and Silver medalists on Floor-Ex – Aly Raisman (Gold-FX) and Romania’s Catalina Ponar (Silver-FX), Shawn Johnson (2008 Beijing Olympics Silver Medal-FX), ALL of the athletes on the 1996 Gold Medal Atlanta Mag 7 US Olympic Team and the 1992 Barcelona Bronze medal team. Barry has arranged for some of the most outstanding athletes and choreographers in the US and the world.\n\nI write, arrange, orchestrate, perform, edit, mix, master and do all the final production on every piece in this catalog – there is no one else involved in the actual creation of this music! When you get a piece from Floor Express, you are getting a piece of music from me, Barry Nease.\n\nAn amazing new arrangement with my fantastic orchestra using my absolute favorite drummer – ME! I’ve had to opportunity to work with some fine rock drummers and I sort of channel them as I play their parts. These productions are single handed triumphs for me – I write them, perform all of the parts and then engineer them. When I’m done and i listen, I can’t believe I was able to do it!!!"
