At that time there were no private or commercial tennis clubs in the area, so Lake organized the local players at nearby Jastro Park into a public parks club named Bakersfield Tennis Club. From 1939 to 1948 Lake operated a small tennis shop at Jastro Park and along with a few local businessmen tennis players came up with the idea of building a member-owned and operated private tennis club. A Tennis Development Corporation was created to sell stock and the tennis facility was built in 1948. A membership club was then created, which was named the Bakersfield Racquet Club. Many years later, before he died, Lake Lovelace wrote a book about the club which he titled: A Home for Tennis. From the beginning the club was centered around family, welcoming children of all ages. That tradition continues to this day with a vigorous youth program and official Nike tennis camps, plus High School, College, Central Cal & Maze Cup Tournaments.
