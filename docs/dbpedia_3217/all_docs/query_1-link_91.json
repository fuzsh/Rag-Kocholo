        "text": "KEITH Earl MARISHAL.\n\nHISTORY and remotest antiquity are agreed, that the family of Keith is one of the most ancient and illustrious the Scotch nation ever has produced: a family, fruitful in a race of great men, who, not indebted to the nobility of their origin, have always re∣flected greater glory on their progenitors, on the hereditary titles and offices they enjoyed, than they ever deduced from them.\n\nOur best antiquaries derive their origin from a certain great man called Robert, who per∣formed glorious exploits against the Danes, when they invaded Scotland with a numerous army in the reign of king Malcolm II. tho' some trace their origin much higher; however, this hero remarkaby distinguished himself at the battle of Barry or Camustone in Angus, where, with his own hand, he killed the fa∣mous Camus, general and champion of the Danish army, whereby the Scots gained a compleat victory, anno 1010.\n\nKing Malcolm, in recompence of his great and signal services, bestowed upon him several lands, particularly the barony of Keith in East-Lothian, from which his posterity assumed their sirname. He also appointed him here∣ditary great marishal of Scotland, which high office hath continued in his family, and hath never been enjoyed by any other since that time.\n\nOf this great warrior was lineally descend∣ed, Herveus, or Hervieus de Keth, of whom we have many authentic documents in the ar∣chives of the kingdom, which sufficiently prove that he was great marishal of Scotland, and proprietor of the lands and barony of Keth; and as he was undoubted progenitor of this il∣lustrious family, from him we deduce their descent by unquestionable vouchers.\n\nI. HERVEUS de KETH, great marishal of Scotland, flourished in the reign of king Da∣vid I. who succeeded to the crown anno 1124, and died anno 1153.\n\nThis Herveus had a dispute with the abbot and convent of Kelso, who claimed the church of Keth, in the village of this Herveus, de∣signed Herveus de Keth marescallus regis Sco∣tiae, at a convention held on that cause, to which J. bishop of Glasgow, and R. abbot of Jedworth, are witnesses, inter annos 1164 et 1174, in which last year the bishop died.\n\nThat there had been many meetings and conventions about this contest, sufficiently appears from the writs in the chartulary of Kelso.\n\nAt last the pope interposed his authority, and Joceline bishop of Glasgow, and Osbert prior of Paisley, were delegated by him as judges of the plea, which had long sublisted between the monks of Kelchou, and Herveus great marishal, about the church of Keth, in the village of the said Herveus, &c. Their sentence in favours of the monastery was con∣firmed by Richard bishop of St. Andrews, who died anno 1178; and Joceline having been constituted bishop of Glasgow, anno 1174, the controversy must have been deter∣mined between these two periods.\n\nIt may here be observed, that of old there were two Keiths; that which belonged to this family was promiscuously called Keith-Hervey, and Keith-Marishal; the other, which sometime belonged to the Frasers, was called Keith-Symons, or Keith-Hundely (now Hum∣by;) but the great marishals soon became proprietors of both, as will be shown here∣after.\n\nHerveus de Keth lived to a great age, died betwixt the years 1190 and 1195, and was father of\n\nII. MALCOLMUS de KETH, who, in a donation to the monastery of Arbroath, is de∣signed son of Herveus de Keth, great mari∣shal of Scotland, anno 1178.\n\nAnd in a donation to the monastery of Kelso, concerning the teinds of the miln of of Molla, Malcolm, son of Herveus de Keth, great marishal of Scotland, is a witness anno 1185.\n\nHe is also mentioned in another donation to the same monastery, together with Robert de Ednem, Thomas de Heriz, &c. before the year 1190.\n\nThis Malcolm appears to have died before his father, for we never find him designed great marishal. He left issue two sons.\n\n1. Philip de Keth.\n\n2. David de Keth, who enjoyed a share of the marishal's office with his brother, as in se∣veral donations to the monasteries of Arbroath and Cambu••kenneth, we find Philip and Da∣vid de Keth, designed brothers and great ma∣rishals of our lord the king, between the years 1195 and 1199. This David had a son Rich∣ard, who is said to have been progenitor of those who assumed Marishal for their sir∣name, of whom there were several families in Scotland afterwards; but some historians have most erroncously taken them for great marishals of Scotland, tho' it is most certain that that office was never enjoyed by any fa∣mily but the Keiths, as before observed.\n\nIII. PHILIP de KETH, great marishal of Scotland, eldest son of Malcolm, succeeded his grandfather, and in a donation to the mona∣stery of Arbroath, is designed Philip de Keth, great marishal of our sovereign lord the king, about the year 1195.\n\nAlso in a charter of king William, of a do∣nation to the monastery of Dunsermline, Phi∣lippus de Keth, great marishal of Scotland, is particularly mentioned, before the year 1210.\n\nHe is likewise designed great marishal of Scotland, in several other authentic writs be∣fore the year 1214.\n\nHe married Eda, daughter and heiress of Hugo de Lorens, by Eda his wife, daughter and heiress of Symon Fraser of Keth-Hundely, with whom he got the lands of the other Keth, whereby he became proprietor of both, and by her lest issue a son and successor,\n\nIV. HERVEUS de KETH, who, in a dona∣tion to the monastery of Coldinghame, is de∣signed great marishal of Scotland, son of Phi∣lip great marishal, &c. anno 1222.\n\nHe is designed in the same manner, in a donation to the monastery of Arbroath, in the year 1226.\n\nThis Hervens, (now proprietor of Keth-Humbie) confirmed all the donations of the church of Keth, together with the commonty and easements of all the lands of Keth, &c. made by Symon Fraser to the monastery of Kelso, about the year 1236.\n\nAll which donations, with the lands, fo∣rest, &c. lying in the tenement of the said Herveus de Keth, are confirmed by a charter from king Alexander II. anno 1238.\n\nHe died in the end of the reign of the king A∣lexander II. and left issue a son,\n\nV. Sir JOHN, who succeeded him, and is designed great marishal of Scotland, when he confirms all the donations of his predecessors, and particularly those ceded to the monastery of Kelso, by the determination of the late con∣troversy, and as they are contained in the charter of Herveus great marishal of Scotland, his father, in king Alexander II's charter, an∣no 1238 before mentioned, &c. He likewise added to that donation some other lands in his ground of Keth, all contained in one char∣ter, which is without date, but by the witnes∣ses appears to have been about the year 1250.\n\nHe also confirms a donation to the mona∣stery of Soltray, of the lands of Johnston in East-Lothian, of which he was superior, in the beginning of the reign of king Alexander III.\n\nHe married a daughter of the earl of Bu∣chan, by whom he had two sons.\n\n1. Sir William, his heir.\n\n2. Sir Adam de Keth, who being bred to the church, was rector of the church of Keth∣Marishal, anno 1292.\n\nHe died before the year 1270, and was succeeded by his eldest son,\n\nVI. Sir WILLIAM KETH, great marishal of Scotland, in a charter of confirmation by Malcolm earl of Lennox, of a donation to the monastery of Paisley, sir William de Keth, sir William Livingston, knights, Gilbert Drum∣mond and Patrick Lindesay are witnesses 1270.\n\nThe Keiths by this time were become very numerous in Scotland, and we find many of that sirname mentioned in authentic docu∣ments, whom we can connect with no parti∣cular family. viz.\n\nSir Robert Keth, anno 1240.\n\nRobertus de Keth, in the reign of king A∣lexander III.\n\nBernard de Keth, anno 1274.\n\nPhilip de Keth, with Mary his wife, an∣no 1296, as in Rymer's foedera angliae.\n\nAlisandre de Keth, in the same year, as in Prynne.\n\nSir Edward Keith of Synton.\n\nSir Walter Keth.\n\nAnd many others needless to be here in∣serted.\n\nSir William married Barbara, daughter of Adam lord Seton, ancestor of the earl of Winton, by whom he had three sons, and one daughter.\n\n1. Sir Robert.\n\n2. Sir Richard de Keth, ancestor of the family of Galston.\n\n3. Philip de Keth, who being bred to the church, was rector of Bygar.\n\nHis daughter,—, was married to William lord Douglas, called the Hardy, an∣cestor to the duke of Douglas.\n\nHe died before the year 1296, and was succeeded by his eldest son,\n\nVII. Sir ROBERT KETH, great marishal of Scotland, who confirms to the monastery of Soltray the tenement of Johnston, &c. by a charter, in which sir Richard de Keth, Knt. sir Philip de Keth, rector of the church of Bygar, his brothers, sir Adam de Keth, rector of Keth-Marishal, his uncle, and John de Keth, his son and heir, are witnesses, about the year 1296.\n\nHe was a man of great parts, a worthy pa∣triot, and had a large share of the troubles wherewith his country was oppressed for ma∣ny years, and embraced every opportunity of exerting his courage with the loyalists, in the reign of king Robert Bruce.\n\nWhen king Edward I, of England thought he had compleated the conquest of Scotland, and pretending to show them a little favour, he allowed them to chuse ten of their own countrymen to represent them in parliament to be held at London, of which number sir Robert Keth the marishal was one, anno 1304.\n\nHe was soon thereafter appointed one of the guardians of Scotland by king Edward, in the year 1305.\n\nAnd though he was for some time on the Baliol's side, when the country was over-run by the English, yet no sooner did king Ro∣bert begin to assert his title to the crown, than he joined him, was faithful and steady in his interest ever after, and was one of his chief favourites and fastest friends.\n\nHe was very instrumental in gaining the battle of Innerury, which was amongst the first of king Robert's conquests, for which he got a grant of several lands, and particularly a royal seat called Hall-forest, &c.\n\nHe was appointed justiciar of Scotland be∣north the river Forth, and is designed the noble marishal of Scotland, and justiciar be∣yond the river Forth, in the year 1309.\n\nHe had a considerable command at the bat∣tle of Bannockburn, and contributed not a little to the king's obtaining that glorious victory, anno 1314.\n\nHe was one of the magnates Scotiae (or Scoch nobles or grandee••) who signed that famous letter to the pope, asserting the inde∣pendency of Scotland, anno 1320.\n\nAnd being no less an able statesman than a brave soldier, was that same year sent ambas∣sador extraordinary to the court of France, to negotiate some affairs of the utmost import∣ance, and he acquitted himself entirely to the king's satisfaction.\n\nHe was afterwards one of the commission∣ers appointed to treat with the English; a truce was concluded, and he was one of the guarantees, anno 1323.\n\nIn a donation of king Robert to the mo∣nastery of Coldinghame, Robert de Keth, great marishal of Scotland, is a witness, anno 1328.\n\nAnd in another charter of king Robert, confirming all the donations of his predeces∣sors to the monastery of Kelso, Gilbert de Haya, lord high constable, and Robert de Keth, great marishal of Scotland, are wit∣nesses, in the 23d year of king Robert's reign, anno 1329.\n\nHe married Barbara Douglas (but of what family we know not) by whom he had issue two sons.\n\n1. John, his apparent heir.\n\n2. Sir William Keth, a brave and valiant knight, who performed many gallant actions\n\nagainst the enemies of his country. He was governor of Berwick, which he desended to the last extremity, and is often designed cu∣stos Bervici by the English, anno 1333, 1334, &c. He was appointed by the estates of Scotland ambassador extraordinary to the court of England, and obtained a safe conduct for himself and sixty horsemen in his retinue, anno 1335, and was at last killed at the siege of Stirling, anno 1336.\n\nSir Robert was killed in his old age, with most of his kindred and clan, fighting gallant∣ly for his king and country at the battle of Duplin, anno 1332, cum plerisque ex familia, nobilibus, &c. says Boethius.\n\nVIII. JOHN de KETH, designed son and heir of sir Robert Keth, great marishal of Scotland, in the confirmation of the lands of Johnston to the monastery of Soltray, before noticed, died in the year 1324, which ap∣pears by an entail made by his father of his whole estate in favours of his grandson sir Ro∣bert, and the heirs-male of his body, in the year 1325.\n\nIX. Sir ROBERT de KETH, great mari∣shal of Scotland, son of John, succeeded his grandfather in the year 1332, and inherited all his virtues.\n\nHe was no less a steady friend to king Da∣vid than his grandfather had been to king Ro∣bert, and performed many brave actions a∣gainst the English. He was designed great marishal of Scotland, and high sheriff of A∣berdeen in many authentic writs still extant, between the years 1335 and 1342.\n\nHe married Margaret, daughter of sir Gil∣bert Hay of Errol, lord high constable of Scot∣land, and ancestor of the earl of Errol, by whom he had a son,\n\nSir Edward,—and two daughters.\n\n1.—married sir Robert Maitland of Thirlestane and Leithington, ancestor of the earl of Lauderdale.\n\n2.—, married—, Irvine of Drum.\n\nThe marishal accompanied king David in his expedition to England, and lost his life in the service of his country at the battle of Durh••un, where his royal master was taken prisoner, in the year 1346.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son,\n\nX. Sir EDWARD KETH, great marishal of Scotland, who was designed sir Edward de Keth, knight, in an inquisition, where his fa∣ther is designed Robert de Keth, great ma∣rishal of Scotland, &c. in the year 1341.\n\nHe married, 1st, Christian, eldest daughter of sir John Menteith, by lady Helen his spouse, daughter of Gratney earl of Mar. By her he had issue only one daughter,\n\nJanet, married to Thomas lord Erskine, ancestor of the earls of Mar, of the sirname of Erskine.\n\nHe married, 2dly, Isabel de Keth, said to be a daughter of the family of Galstoun, by whom he had two sons, and one daughter.\n\n1. Sir William, his heir.\n\n2.

He had in his retinue Andrew Keith lord Dingwall, sir James Scrimgeour of Dudhope, Mr. John Skeen king's advocate, Mr. George Young arch-dean of St. Andrews, and several other persons of distinction, and acquirred himself so much to the satisfaction of the king and ministry, that they granted him a full, ample, and honourable acquittance and discharge, by an act of the privy council, in which are inserted several ancedots, very much to his honour, and wherein his great a∣bilities and fidelity are fully set furth.\n\nIn the year 1593, this earl made a noble foundation of a college at Aberdeen, called the marishal college, and endowed it with sufficient funds for the support and mainte∣nance of a principal and four professors of phi∣losophy, of which this family are perpetual patrons; and the seal of the college bears the arms of earl marishal quartered with those of the town of Aberdeen.\n\nAfter king James went up to England, his esteem and favour for the earl never abated.

He never left his majesty while he staid in Scotland, and gladly would have accompanied him into England, had he not been expressly ordered by the king to remain with the earls of Crawfurd and Glencairn, to govern the na∣tion; but while he was busily employed in raising forces for the royal cause, he was sur∣prised, with several of his friends, at Elli∣ot in Angus, by a strong party of English horse, and sent prisoner to London by sea; where, after a ten year's confinement in the tower, which he bore with great sirmness and constancy, he was released at the happy re∣storation of king Charles II. who, in recom∣pence of his great merit and sufferings, nomi∣nated him one of his privy council in the year 1660, and soon thereafter made him lord pri∣vy seal, which office he enjoyed till his death.\n\nHe married lady Elizabeth Seton, daugh∣ter of George earl of Winton, by whom he had four daughters.\n\n1.

WILLIAM, ninth earl marishal, a man of an active spirit, solid judgment, great hospitality, and a true lover of his country, and so strongly attached to the interest of the Stewart family, that he never came into the measures of the court, during all the reign of king William, and a great part of queen Anne's.\n\nHe opposed with all his interest the union of the two kingdoms in every article, as being inconsistent with the liberty, and derogatory to the honour of his country in general, and that of his hereditary office of great marishal in particular, wherefore he entered a solemn protest against it, which is still upon record, and will be a lasting monument of the sincere regard he had for the ancient privileges of his country.\n\nHe was elected one of the sixteen Scotch peers to serve in the parliament of Great Bri∣tain, in the year 1710.\n\nHe married lady Mary Drummond, daugh∣ter of James earl of Perth, lord high chancel∣lor of Scotland, by lady Jean Douglas, daugh∣ter of William marquis of Douglas, by whom he had issue two sons and two daughters.\n\n1.

After the battle of Dum∣blain, where he was engaged with his brother earl marishal, he went abroad to seek prefer∣ment at the Spanish court; but not finding a quick promotion there, he entered into the service of Peter the Great, emperor of Russia, who soon promoted him to the rank of a ge∣neral officer. He afterwards went into the service of Frederick III. king of Prussia, who raised him to the rank of a field marshal; but after many signal services, when the right wing of the Prussian army was surprised by\n\nthe Austrians under marshal Daun, at Hoch∣kirchen, he making a glorious defence, was unfortunately killed, 14th October 1758, and was buried in the church-yard of Hochkir∣chen; but the king of Prussia, who could not sufficiently regret the loss of so great a com∣mander, had his corpse taken up and sent to Berlin, where he was interred a second time, with great military honours.\n\nThe earl's Ist daughter, lady Mary, was married to John earl of Wigton, whose only child, lady Clementina Fleming, married to Charles, tenth lord Elphingston, to whom she hath a numerous issue.\n\n2. Lady Anne, married to Alexander lord Gairlies, now earl of G••lloway, to whom she had two sons, who died young, and a daugh∣ter, lady Mary, married to Kenneth lord For∣trose, to whom she had a numerous issue.\n\nThe earl died in the year 1712, and was succeeded by his eldest son,\n\nXXIII. GEORGE, tenth earl Marishal, who having been engaged in the rebellion 1715, was attainted of treason, and his estate and honours forfeited to the crown. He went beyond seas, and at different times resided at the courts of France, Spain, Rome, and Prussia.\n\nIn 1750, he was appointed ambassador ex∣traordinary by his Prussian majesty to the court of France, and was afterwards invested with the order of the Black Eagle.\n\nIn 1759, he went by Turin to the court of Spain, being, as was generally believed, sent there from the king of Prussia, who ap∣pointed him governor of Neufchatell.\n\nIn the same year 1759, there was a pardon obtained for him from king George II. upon which he came over to England, has since suc∣ceeded to the estate of Kintore, and went a∣gain to his government of Neufchatell.\n\nARMS.\n\nArgent, on a chief gules, three pallets or.\n\nCREST; on a wreath, a stag's head erased proper, and attired with ten tynes or.\n\nSUPPORTERS; two stags proper attired, as the crest.\n\nMOTTO; Veritas vincit.\n\nNote, The two battoons in saltire semee of thistles, and ensigned on the top with im∣perial crowns behind the shield, were born as badges to the office of lord marishal of Scot∣land.\n\nCHIEF SEATS,\n\nWere at Dunotyr-castle, in the shire of Kincardine, and Fetteresso, in the same coun∣ty; also at Inverngy and Newburgh, in the county of Aberdeen."
