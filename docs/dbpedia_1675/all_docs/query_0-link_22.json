        "text": "Niko Roberts grew up on the East Coast, his father once being the head coach at St. John’s.Roberts played his college basketball in the Midwest at national powerhouse Kansas.\n\nGiven the geographical gap between the Mountain West and Roberts’ youth playing days, he didn’t know much about the conference in the 2000s. But Roberts, the MW associate commissioner of men's and women's basketball, had a turning point in his perception of the league during his senior season with the Jayhawks.\n\nThe year was 2013 and San Diego State, ranked 21st in the nation at 11-1, took a trip to Kansas’ famed Allen Fieldhouse. The Jayhawks boasted stars Joel Embiid and Andrew Wiggins, two future All-Stars on a roster that included six NBA players. Yet, SDSU, who had just one NBA player on its roster — J.J. O’Brien, who would play just six minutes in the league – nearly led wire-to-wire in a 61-57 win that snapped Kansas’ 68-game home win streak against non-conference opponents.\n\n“I can still remember the practices after that and how much we were running,” Roberts joked of the post-loss punishment after San Diego State held Kansas to 29.8 percent shooting. “I've never seen our team play somebody that was so physical and intense, and it stuck in my head. Growing up on the East Coast, I wasn't able when I was younger to stay up and watch Mountain West games. But when I was in college and able to experience and see some of these guys up close and recognize how talented and good this league is and how underrated it often is, that changed. I think people are finally starting to recognize the Mountain West is by far the best conference in the West.”\n\nThat’s not the reputation the MW has had over the years, but it’s undeniably true this season. The conference is 6-1 against the Pac-12, 18-6 against the West Coast Conference and projected for a league-best six bids in this year’s NCAA Tournament, as many as the Pac-12 (two), WCC (two), Big West (one) and Big Sky (one) combined.\n\nThe MW boasts six teams in the NET’s top 40, matching the SEC (six) and more than the Big Ten (four), Big East (four) and Pac-12 (three) among the so-called power conferences. Only the Big 12’s seven top-40 NET teams beat the MW out of 32 Division I conferences. And after San Diego State’s run to the 2023 national championship game last season, these are the halcyon days for MW men’s basketball.\n\nThe conference's veteran coaches are letting out a collective sigh of “It’s about time” with the MW finally getting the recognition and appreciation those coaches have long believed was deserved.\n\n“Make no bones about it — this is a basketball league,” said Boise State’s Leon Rice, the dean of MW head coaches in his 13th season in the league and 14th overall with the Broncos. “No ifs, ands or buts. And I'm saying that coming from a football place. This league’s been in three national championship games, has won national championships in basketball. We played in the national championship last year.\n\n“Football hasn't even come close to something like that, but there's so much focus on football that it was kind of undervalued and underappreciated how good this league was in basketball. It makes you happy and proud that your league is finally getting the respect it deserves because we've had to live it. The coaches who have been in this league a long time, we've known it for a long time.”\n\nRice’s tenure at Boise State is double that of any other active MW head coach (San Diego State's Brian Dutcher has been in the league since 1999 but as a head coach since 2017). Rice was hired by Boise State in 2010, the Broncos’ last year in the WAC. Upon entering the MW a year later, he quickly learned of the league’s strength. Before his Boise State hiring, Rice was a Gonzaga assistant for 11 years in the WCC.\n\n“There were Hall of Fame coaches in almost every school in the league,” Rice said of his first impression of the MW. “I remember calling my buddies at Gonzaga saying, ‘Keep my job open because I'm going to need to come back there because I will never win a game in this league.’ The places you had to go play, you were blown away by. The level of coaching. The talent. The athleticism. It's always been an athletic league. I came from the WCC, which is kind of skilled, smart guys. Coming to the Mountain West from Gonzaga, I was, like, ‘Holy cow, this league is so athletic!’”\n\nThe MW was coming off its best basketball run upon Rice’s entry. In 2011, Kawhi Leonard and Jimmer Fredette pushed San Diego State and BYU, respectively, to Sweet 16 runs while leading top-10 teams in the nation. In 2012, the MW set a then-league record with four NCAA Tournament teams. It boosted that figure to five teams in 2013. But eventually, conference realignment of the early 2010s impacted the MW.\n\nBy 2014, Utah, BYU and TCU had left the league and were replaced by Boise State, Nevada, Utah State, Fresno State and San Jose State. The MW got just two NCAA Tournament berths in 2014, starting a streak of eight straight years where the league earned more than two berths just one, that being three in 2015. The MW suffered single-bid indignity in back-to-back seasons in 2016 and 2017 but has methodically risen back to national relevance.\n\nIt took some of the old WAC additions time to get their footing in the league with “new” MW schools comprising half of the league's six projected NCAA Tournament teams, including Boise State, Nevada and Utah State along with original MW members SDSU, New Mexico and Colorado State. Roberts said some recent coaching changes have helped elevate the MW back to a high perch.\n\n“Around that time, we got a few new coaches,” Roberts said of the post-2020 success. “I think some of those schools got a fresh start. (New Mexico's) Richard Pitino coming from Minnesota, he’s a phenomenal coach. Niko Medved has been awesome at Colorado State. More recent, but Danny Sprinkle and Ryan Odom, who was at Utah State previously, have been excellent. We have great coaches, we have really good programs, we have great buildings, great atmospheres, beautiful campuses. There are so many positives to being in the Mountain West, and sometimes it just takes the right person to lead it.”\n\nAnd if one Division I conference has capitalized the most from COVID, it’s the MW, a league that boasts a bevy of fifth- and sixth-year seniors. Of the top-10 scorers in the league this year, six would not have been eligible this season if not for the extra COVID year. That’s loaded MW rosters with veteran players. That's especially true at the key point guard position. Seven of the league's 11 teams have an assists leader in his fifth year of college or later.\n\n“I think it's been huge for us,” Roberts said the league's older rosters. “Our teams are not only old but they’re physically strong. You look at Nevada, you look at San Diego State, you look at UNLV, all of these teams are very physically strong, mature players, which is huge. I'd say we’re probably the most physical league in the nation.”\n\nNevada fifth-year senior Jarod Lucas began his career in the Pac-12, playing for Oregon State for three seasons and helping the Beavers make the NCAA Tournament’s Elite 8 in 2021. He transferred to Nevada before last season and said playing in the MW is more difficult than the Pac-12 because of that age.\n\n“It’s a bunch of veterans,” Lucas said. “In the Pac-12, you might have some top-50 freshmen or McDonald's All-Americans coming in, whereas the Mountain West, you're playing against grown men. You have fifth-year seniors, sixth-year seniors and a lot of teams are old and veteran.”\n\nOne of those veteran teams struck through for the MW’s big breakthrough last season. San Diego State's nine-man rotation last year included five fifth-year seniors, two fourth-year seniors and two juniors.\n\n“Last year, San Diego State was older than four NBA teams,” Rice said with a laugh.\n\nThe experience showed in the NCAA Tournament as the Aztecs became the first team in the conference’s 25-year history to get past the Sweet 16. After a narrow win over College of Charleston in the first round, SDSU beat Furman in the second and No. 1 seed Alabama in the Sweet 16 before one-point wins over Creighton and Florida Atlantic put the Aztecs in the national championship game.\n\nIt was a perception-altering performance, according to those in the MW, showing the conference was capable of doing major damage in the national tournament. Six teams from the league had previously been to the Sweet 16, including Nevada in 2018, but none had won a game on the second weekend before San Diego State in 2023.\n\n“I think everybody knew we were a tough league, but there had been a little bit of a narrative that we weren't getting it done in the NCAA Tournament, which there was a little bit of truth to that,” Roberts said. “But I think San Diego State is a team that everybody has always respected, and when they were able to make that run, it opened everybody's eyes up and it brings more national attention to our conference as well.”\n\nThat momentum has carried over to this season. The MW set up ideal 2023-24 non-conference schedules that balanced each team’s talent level against an appropriate level of competition.\n\nEach team in the conference entered league play with a winning record as San Diego State (10th-hardest non-league schedule in the nation), Boise State (24th hardest) and Colorado State (46th hardest) played especially noteworthy schedules. The league’s top-six teams went 70-10 in non-conference games with a 7-7 mark in Quad 1 games and 9-3 record in Quad 2s. That set the league up for a slew of Quad 1 and 2 games in MW action.\n\n“What we did in non-conference was huge,” Roberts said. “That's what really set the table for everything we're seeing today is the way they played in the non-conference, the way they scheduled in the non-conference and I think that's when people initially paid attention to it. When you look at our metrics right now, every game is a Quad 1 or Quad 2 game with those top six or seven teams.”\n\nWhile the MW has set the table for potentially putting six teams in the NCAA Tournament, what you do when you get there is important, too, when building a national reputation. That has been a point of struggle for the MW since conference realignment settled in 2014. Since that point, only two MW programs have won NCAA Tournament games – San Diego State (2014, 2015 and 2023) and Nevada (in 2018).\n\nAdditionally, the league has not had two teams win a game in the same NCAA Tournament since 2013. Prior to last season, the MW'sNCAA Tournament record was 22-55 overall and 5-17 since the current membership formed in 2013-14. It had lost nine straight NCAA Tournament games dating to2018 before San Diego State's 2023 run.\n\nRice said assessing a league’s strength based on its NCAA Tournament results is foolhardy as injuries, matchups or seeds can impact those wins and losses. But a league’s perception will still be partially impacted by results in the national tournament. The good news for the league is the MW has put itself in line for favorable seeds this March.\n\n“I think you're seeing a shift now,” Rice said of the league’s perception. “Obviously with what happened last year, you can't compare those results to anybody being in the national title game. I just think the more teams you get in, the more opportunities you have, the more times you're knocking on the door, the more we're going to have those breakthroughs. You've also got to remember, too, by not getting the respect, you aren't getting the seeds that you maybe deserved or needed.”\n\nThis March could go a long way in putting the MW in higher esteem as a basketball conference. It also could do the opposite. While boiling down a league’s worth to a handful of games might be shortsighted, the reality is winning games in the NCAA Tournament is exceptionally important.\n\n“Obviously we can't promise that we're going to duplicate what we were able to do last year,” Roberts said. “We want to win as many games as we can. A lot of times when you get to the NCAA Tournament, it's about matchups. You may play a team six of seven seeds lower than you, but they are just the opposite of what you want to play and they're just a terrible matchup for you.\n\n“I wouldn't put a number on how many games we'll win and all that stuff. Just continuing to try to be successful, win games and just take it one game at a time. I wouldn't put it put a number on. I think we've done great so far. But it matters what you do in March. It’s going to be tough, but I think our teams are battle-tested, and I'm excited to see them play.”\n\nRegardless of Big Dance results, the MW seems well positioned for the future. The Pac-12 has crumbled down to two schools, putting the MW in a position to rule the West in college basketball. The league also is packed with rabid basketball fan bases with five of the nation’s top-65 Division I teams (out of 362) averaging at least 80 percent capacity for home games in San Diego State (99.6 percent), New Mexico (84.6 percent), Boise State (84 percent), Colorado State (83 percent) and Utah State (81.7 percent). Nevada also is in the top 75 nationally at 71.2 percent.\n\n“It’s second to none,” Rice said of the MW’s homecourt atmospheres. “I've played at a lot of high-level places with huge reputations over the years and the places that we get to go play and see, it's remarkable. To get out of there alive is an accomplishment, let alone win a game.”\n\nOne coach familiar with the road venues in the MW is Nevada’s Steve Alford, who had had two stints in the conference. The first came at New Mexico from 2007-13 when he won six MW titles in six seasons with three NCAA Tournament berths. His second stint in the league has come in the last five years at Nevada, a school likely ticketed for its second straight Big Dance. Alford has coached in the MW’s two strongest eras and believes this year’s conference is better than those from the late 2000s and early 2010s.\n\n“This is my 11th year in it and it's by far the best it’s been top to bottom,” Alford said. “Obviously there’s more basketball to be played and there’s a lot of things that can happen, but if it ends today, I don’t think there’s any discussion, it’s six teams in the NCAA Tournament. It’s that good. When we got five in (in 2013), it was really five teams, and I thought the rest of the league there was a big drop off. The difference is there's not much of a dropoff now.”\n\nWhether the 2023-24 season ends up being a high point or a building block for even more future success is undetermined.\n\nWill the MW have two teams win an NCAA Tournament game for the first time since 2013?\n\nWill SDSU continue to carry the flag with no other MW teams having success in the national tournament?\n\nWill the league continue to invest in budgets and NIL and rack up increasingly more NCAA Tournament units?\n\nWill the MW suffer once it can't capitalize on the extra COVID year following the 2024-25 season?\n\nThere are many questions to be answered as the MW tries to finish the season strong and be even better in the future. But this appears to be a potentially perception-changing season for the MW as it tries to prove this March it is an elite college basketball conference worth being mentioned alongside the Big 12, Big Ten, ACC and SEC.\n\n“We’re in a good place, and it's just going to keep getting better and better and better,” Rice said. “You look at the history of players in this league and how they went on to great success and draft picks, we’ve had two No. 1 NBA picks (Utah’s Andrew Bogut and UNLV’s Anthony Bennett). There was a 10-year span where we had more No. 1 one picks than the SEC. Think about that. If you become an All-Mountain West player, you've got a really bright future in professional basketball.”"
