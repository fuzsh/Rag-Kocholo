        "text": "Brigham YoungBASEBALL: Senior Matt Rex and freshman Matt Carson led BYU to an opening round 9-6 victory over Utah in the Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament on Wednesday. Rex earned his first save of the season when he came in relief of Jeff Stone in the sixth inning. Carson, the MWC Freshman of the Year, hit a two-out triple to drive in Michael Davies in the seventh after picking up an RBI in the fifth. BYU advances in the winner's bracket to play Thursday evening against San Diego State, and Utah played New Mexico in the afternoon game.\n\nMEN'S GOLF: The BYU golf team, ranked No. 6 in the nation, will try to get back on tack when it competes Thursday through Saturday at the NCAA West Regional golf tournament at Riverbend Golf Course. The Cougars are the No. 1 seed from District VII, but they struggled in their last outing at the Mountain West Conference tournament earlier in the month when they finished a disappointing fourth. Earlier in the season, the Cougars won seven tournaments.\n\nBYU needs to finish among the top nine teams this weekend to advance to the NCAA championships at Auburn, Ala., May 31-June 3. Among the other contenders are No. 5-ranked Arizona State, No. 8 UNLV, No. 10 Fresno State, No. 12 New Mexico and No. 13 Arizona.\n\nAlso six individuals will compete, including Ryan Ellis of Utah.\n\nTRACK AND FIELD: BYU's Curtis Pugsley set five personal bests and UNLV's Chantel Yates earned wins in the short races as the pair claimed early leads in the decathlon and heptathlon, respectively, on the opening day of the Mountain West Conference Track and Field Championships Wednesday in Provo."
