        "text": "Glen Millican Coaching Career 1998-01 New Mexico Assistant Coach 2001-23 New Mexico Head Coach 2023- Missouri Head Coach Coaching Awards • Eight-time Conference Coach of the Year • Three-time GCAA Regional Coach of the Year Team Accomplishments • Eight NCAA Championship Final bids • 19 NCAA Championship Regional bids • Eight Conference Championships • 2002 and 2013 NCAA Regional Titles • 38 Tournament Titles Individual Accomplishments • 17 All-Americans • Seven Conference Champions • Six Conference Golfers of the Year • Five Conference Freshman of the Year • 67 Individual Titles Academic Awards • 2019 GCAA Academic National Champion • Four Academic All-Americans • 49 All-America Scholars\n\nA highly-respected coach with years of championship experience, Glen Millican is in his second year as head coach of the Missouri men’s golf program.\n\nIn his first season at Mizzou, Millican made an immediate impact with the program. Under his leadership, Jack Lundin had one of the best seasons in school history. After finishing the 2023-24 campaign as the nation’s 22nd-ranked golfer, Lundin collected second-team PING All-America accolades. The 11th All-American in MU history, he was also the first Tiger to earn first or second-team honors since Stan Utley in 1984.\n\nAn All-SEC First Team honoree and five-time SEC Golfer of the Week, Lundin posted a 69.69 stroke average in his one year working with Millican – a 1.5 stroke improvement from the previous season – and won back-to-back individual medalist honors at the Hootie at Bulls Bay and Tiger Intercollegiate. A second-team Academic All-American, Lundin also became the first Mizzou student-athlete to represent Team USA at the Arnold Palmer Cup.\n\nAs a team, Mizzou earned its third-straight trip to the NCAA Championship – a first in program history – by earning a bid in the Stanford Regional. The Tigers also won their first team title under Millican’s watch – his 38th team crown in 23 seasons as a collegiate coach – when Mizzou won the Chicago Highlands Invitational.\n\nMillican joined the Tigers after spending the previous 22 seasons leading the University of New Mexico program, where he led the team to eight Mountain West Conference titles in addition to eight appearances at the NCAA Championship Finals. Overall, New Mexico advanced to 18 NCAA Regionals during his 22 seasons on campus.\n\nAn eight-time Mountain West Coach of the Year and three-time Golf Coaches Association of America (GCAA) Southwest Regional Coach of the Year, Millican finished his tenure with New Mexico as the program’s all-time winningest head coach. He led the Lobos to 37 tournament victories, which includes NCAA Regional crowns during the 2002 and 2013 campaigns and all eight of the program’s Mountain West titles.\n\nMillican also mentored a number of student-athletes to individual success during his time at New Mexico. He has coached a Lobo to the Mountain West individual title on seven occasions, while also leading a golfer to the conference’s Golfer of the Year six times and the league’s Freshman of the Year five times. Additionally, Millican helped a UNM student-athlete to All-America recognition on 16 occasions, including three first-team honorees.\n\nOverall, Lobos won 65 individual titles during his 22 seasons with the program, while holding 14 of the program’s 15 lowest stroke averages in school history. Millican also coached two USGA Junior Amateur Champions, while 15 former student-athletes have enjoyed success in worldwide tours, including six on the PGA Tour.\n\nSuccess off the course has been just as important for Millican at both Mizzou and New Mexico. His 2019 team was named the GCAA Academic National Champion for finishing the academic year with the highest GPA in Division I. Additionally, 30 student-athletes have earned All-America Scholar recognition a total of 49 times during his tenure.\n\nPrior to becoming UNM’s head coach, Millican spent three years with the program as an assistant coach from 1998 to 2001. He helped the Lobos to a top-four conference finish in each of his three seasons on staff, while the 2000 team placed 19th at the NCAA Championship.\n\nMillican was a three-year letterwinner at New Mexico from 1994 to 1998. He had seven top-10 finishes in 27 collegiate tournaments with a career-highlighting 11th-place finish at the 1997 WAC Championship. During his freshman year, Millican recorded his top showing of a seventh-place tie at the 1994 Red River Classic. Named an Academic All-American in 1997, Millican earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration from New Mexico in 1998, while completing his master’s in business administration in 2000.\n\nMillican and his wife, Megan, have two daughters, Ryley Nicole and Emily Jane."
