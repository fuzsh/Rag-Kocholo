        "text": "SAN DIEGO, Calif.- Behind the right arm of freshman Dylan Rogers and timely hitting from the Falcons lineup, Air Force wrapped up its Mountain West Tournament appearance with three-consecutive wins, as Saturday's 8-3 victory over San Jose State brings home the Falcons first-ever Mountain West Tournament title. As a result, Air Force will appear in its first NCAA Regional since 1969.\n\nIn as pressurized a position as a freshman could face, Rogers was tremendous. The first-year right-hander lasted 7.1 innings, allowing just three runs with a career-best eight strikeouts. Rogers did not walk any of the 30 batters he faced.\n\nIn the three games at the Mountain West Tournament, the starting trio of Paul Skenes, Doyle Gehring, and Rogers combined for 21.2 innings with an ERA of 1.25.\n\nWith the bases loaded, the score tied 3-3 and two outs in the 7th, Trayden Tamiya provided the biggest hit of the night, as he singled into right-center. An error in right field allowed all three runners to score, giving the Falcons a 6-3 lead, an advantage that Air Force refused to surrender.\n\nTamiya ended the evening 2-4 with a walk two and runs scored.\n\nSam Kulasingam, the Mountain West Player of the Year, wasn't far behind Tamiya in the 7th. The switch-hitting sophomore pulled a two-run double into right field, blowing the game open and extending the Air Force lead to 8-3. The nation's 4th-leading hitter also brought in a run in the 6th, a two-out single to tie the score at 3-3. Kulasingam will tote a .414 batting average and a 1.169 OPS into the Falcons first Regional appearance in 53 years.\n\nSan Jose State owned leads of 2-0 and 3-1, though Air Force immediately answered in the next-half inning in both instances. Following a two-run bottom half of the 2nd, Gabriel Garcia quickly shifted the momentum, lining a double into left-center to leadoff the top of the 3rd. Skenes reached after an error, as both runners were advanced after Jake Greiving's deep fly ball to center.\n\nBraydon Altorfer lifted another fly ball, a sacrifice fly into right field to score Garcia. Immediately after San Jose State managed a RBI single in the 5th, Greiving homered for the 9th time this season, a solo homer to bring the Falcons to within a run. Later in the inning, Tamiya singled and Aerik Joe walked, with Kulasingam's RBI single tying the game.\n\nAs Rogers kept San Jose State off the board in the 6th, the threat of the Falcons 3-4-5 hitters catalyzed the game-changing rally. Garcia led off the 7th with a free pass, with both Skenes and Greiving being plunked to load the bases.\n\nAfter consecutive strikeouts, Tamiya fouled off six-straight pitches before being credited for a two-run single. The San Jose State right fielder stumbled in the outfield, allowing Matt Thompson, who pinch-ran for Greiving, to score as well. After Joe's second walk of the night, Kulasingam's two-run double granted Air Force an 8-3 lead.\n\nRogers retired the side in order in the 7th, and was relieved by CJ Dornak with one out in the 8th. After wrapping up the ballgame on Friday, Dornak was even better on Saturday, notching four strikeouts in 1.2 innings, giving him 2.1 scoreless innings in two games this weekend.\n\nThe Falcons don the patch of Mountain West champions for the first time since joining the conference in 2000, with a looming NCAA Regional appearance, the result of the Mountain West's automatic bid, still to be determined. With the win, Air Force has reached the 30-win plateau for just the second season in its 22 years in the Mountain West and the first time since 2016.\n\nThe NCAA Division I Baseball Championship selection show, announcing the 64 teams and pairings for the 2022 NCAA Division I Baseball Championship will be presented during the selection show that will air at 10 am MT, Monday, May 30 on ESPN2."
