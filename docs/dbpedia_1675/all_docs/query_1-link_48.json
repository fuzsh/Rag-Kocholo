        "text": "Choose A Facility:\n\nDon Weir Field at Peccole Park\n\nHome to Nevada Baseball - Site of 2015 Mountain West Baseball Tournament\n\nPARKING MAP\n\nDON WEIR FIELD PRESS RELEASE\n\nOn Oct. 20, 2017 Nevada baseball alum, Don Weir made a $1 million donation and Peccole Park renamed Don Weir Field at Peccole Park. The donation allowed for the installation of a new Spinturf field in time for the 2018 season. A fundraising campaign continues with plans to continue improving the facility.\n\nIn the last three seasons there has been several momentous occasions at the park. The 2017 season was the 30th for the on-campus facility and in 2016 the Pack won for the 500th time at home. In 2015 the largest crowed of 3,136 fans watched the Pack play San José State, Nevada claimed its first Mountain West Championships and hosted the season ending conference tournament for the first time.\n\nPeccole Park was originally constructed in 1988 and has undergone several renovation projects in its history. With modest beginnings, it has grown into a 3,000 capacity stadium with Wolf Pack locker facilities, two bullpens and batting cages, a press box, concession stands and restrooms.\n\nThe park has proven to be one of the biggest home field advantages in college baseball and one of the best facilities on the west coast. The Wolf Pack is 528-260 with a 56 percent winning percentage in 30 years and has posted a winning home records in 27-of-30 seasons in that span.\n\nThe Wolf Pack has posted numerous special seasons at Peccole Park. The 1992 club posted a perfect 27-0 home record and currently holds the program record for most wins and best winning percentage at home. Nevada has posted seven 20-win seasons at home in Peccole’s history. The Pack has averaged 17.6 home wins per season since moving into Peccole Park.\n\nPeccole Park received a major upgrade prior to the start of the 2006 season as three monumental\n\nimprovements were made to the park. FieldTurf was installed on the field replacing the grass playing surface, lights were installed, and a new fence now surrounds the outfield.\n\nThe University of Nevada baseball program was almost discontinued as a collegiate sport but, thanks to the generosity of alum and donor William Peccole, the Wolf Pack program was saved and a new field was built on campus. The field began to take shape in 1987 with an initial $300,000 donation from Peccole, along with assistance from local contractors who donated time and materials to the project.\n\nThe Wolf Pack played their first season in Peccole Park in 1988 posting a 17-12 record. Another $300,000 gift from Peccole in 1992 built restroom facilities and seating down first and third base. Additional donations helped pave the parking lot and make continued improvements to the stadium. Peccole’s financial support of the park that bears his name totaled $600,000.\n\nThe 1995 off-season produced upgrades of the restroom facilities, concessions facilities, and the addition of parking to better handle the crowds that have responded to Nevada’s baseball success.\n\nDuring the summer of 1997, a state-of-the-art indoor batting and pitching facility was added and the entire infield was upgraded and resodded. Prior to the 2001 season 1,225 seats down the left field line were installed increasing seating capacity to 3,000.\n\nFans attending a game in 2003 saw a new scoreboard and message center that were installed during the off-season. Prior to the 2005 season an office for the Pack coaching staff, player and coaches showers, a training area, expansion to the players locker room, laundry facilities, and increased storage areas were added.\n\nPeccole Park Quick Facts Built 1988 Location Nevada Campus Dimensions 340-383-401-383-340 Fence 12-foot high, 20-foot high batters eye Capacity 3,000 Single-Game Attendance Record 3,136 vs. San Jose State, April 26, 2015 Highest Attendance Average 1,365 in 2000 Best Home Record 27-0 in 1992 Overall Home Record 546-264(.674)\n\nNevada at Peccole Park Home Record Overall Record Year W L Pct.
