        "text": "April 1, 2009\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -\n\nThe Mountain West Conference announces its 10th Anniversary Baseball Team, as selected by a combined panel of media, institutional and conference personnel and on-line fan poll. Former Utes Chris Shelton and Jay Brossman were both selected to the team.\n\nShelton played one year at Utah (2001) after transferring from Salt Lake Community College. The catcher was named the MWC Player of the Year and was selected as a second-team Louisville Slugger All-American and a third-team NCBWA All-American. Shelton ranked 12th in the nation with 19 home runs and led the league with a .753 slugging percentage. He had a .374 batting average with 66 RBI and 22 doubles.\n\nBrossman was a four-time All-MWC player during his time at Utah, earning first-team nods three of those years. He competing from 2004 to 2007, played his final two years at first base. Brossman is Utah's all-time career leader in hits (307), doubles (69), RBI (181) and total bases (482). He also ranks second all-time in MWC history in hits, is third in total bases, doubles and at-bats (854). Brossman was a two-time ESPN The Magazine Academic All-District selection.\n\nBoth players were drafted after their careers at Utah. Shelton was drafted in the 33rd round of the 2001 draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates. He played for the Detroit Tigers from 2004 to 2006 and saw time with the Texas Rangers in 2008. During this past offseason, Shelton signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners.\n\nBrossman was drafted in the 36th round of the 2007 draft by the Los Angeles Angels. He spent 2007 with the rookie league Orem Owls and played for the Single-A Cedar Rapids Kernels in 2008.\n\nIn order to be eligible for consideration, candidates must have been a first-team all-Mountain West selection at least once in their careers.\n\nAnniversary teams will be chosen for each of the 19 conference-sponsored sports during the 2008-09 seasons in celebration of the Mountain West's 10th anniversary."
