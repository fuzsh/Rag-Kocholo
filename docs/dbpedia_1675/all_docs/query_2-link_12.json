        "text": "The Nevada baseball team did not wait around to clinch its third Mountain West championship.\n\nThe Wolf Pack hammered San Jose State, 16-6, on Friday to wrap up the MW’s regular-season title and an automatic berth into the NCAA regional round. Nevada’s win, combined with San Diego State losing one of its two games Friday at New Mexico, made it impossible for the second-place Aztecs to pass the Pack at the top of the standings.\n\nThe Wolf Pack (22-18 overall, 19-9 Mountain West) and the visiting Spartans (6-27, 2-16) continued their four-game series with a Saturday double-header. The teams are also scheduled for a single game on Sunday (1 p.m.).\n\nThe MW will not conduct a conference tournament this season; instead, Nevada will advance directly to an NCAA regional for the first time since 2000. The 64-team field for the regional round will be announced Monday morning.\n\nNevada finished with 22 hits in Friday’s win. First baseman Dillan Shrum went 5-for-5 with five RBI, and the Pack’s Joshua Zamora, Tyler Bosetti, Dario Gomes, and Peter Mendazona each added three hits. Zamora, Gomez, and Shrum homered.\n\nThe Wolf Pack also won MW titles in 2015 and 2018. Nevada’s four previous NCAA tournament appearances came in 1994, 1997, 1999, and 2000."
