        "text": "The Mountain West sent a conference-record six teams to this year's NCAA Tournament, marking perhaps the most successful season in the league's 25-year history. But is it the best season in MW men's basketball history? Five seasons can make the case for that honor, so below we break down each of those seasons before declaring which was the best in MW history.\n\nThe case for 2023-24\n\nMany are saying this is the best season in MW history, and it's hard to deny that. The league sent a record six teams to the NCAA Tournament with five schools being ranked at some point during the season, also a league record. SDSU, Colorado State, Utah State, Nevada and New Mexico all hit the Top 25 en route to an NCAA Tournament berth, with Boise State joining those schools in the Big Dance. The MW had six teams in the NET's final top 40, bested only by the Big 12. So, the top of this league was elite, per the metrics. And the MW had a league-best three teams win at least one NCAA Tournament game in SDSU (first round), Utah State (first round) and Colorado State (First Four). But the league was seventh overall in NET, with the bottom of the MW underwhelming, and went4-6 in the NCAA Tournament with SDSU reaching the Sweet 16 via an easy path. As such, this is not the MW's best year ever.\n\nThe case for 2022-23\n\nThe best team in MW history is the 2022-23 SDSU Aztecs, which reached the national championship game to become the first team from the conference to advance past the Sweet 16. That alone could make this the best season in conference history. And it's not like SDSU was a one-team show as four MW members qualified for the NCAA Tournament despite the Aztecs sweeping the regular-season and tournament titles. Utah State, Boise State and Nevada joined SDSU in the Big Dance, although all lost in their first game (the Wolf Pack in the First Four and the Broncos and Aggies in the first round). Toss in the fact San Jose State— San Jose State!— was fifth in league, and it shows the high-end depth of the MW in 2022-23 was not as strong as this season. While the 2023 Aztecs will always be remembered, the rest of the MW didn't do enough in the postseason to call this the league's best year ever.\n\nThe case for 2012-13\n\nBefore there was NET, there was RPI. And the Mountain West finished first in RPI in 2012-13, making it— in theory— the nation's best conference. The MW sent a then-record five teams to the NCAA Tournament that season, which was even more impressive given the league consisted of just nine schools. This marked the first year of Nevada and Fresno State being in the league after the exit of TCU the year prior (and BYU and Utah the year before that). New Mexico (which won both MW titles), SDSU, Colorado State and UNLV all spent time in the Top 25 this season, with those four plus Boise State making the NCAA Tournament. But the MW was a dud in the NCAA Tournament, going2-5 despite getting four single-digit seeds and a \"First Four\" game. SDSU and Colorado State advanced to the second round, but New Mexico was upset as a three seed and UNLV as a five seed, so this is not the MW's best year ever.\n\nThe case for 2009-10\n\nThe MW was a regular two-bid league for its first decade, earning two or three berths in the NCAA Tournament in nine of the first 10 seasons it existed, the outlier being 2000-01 when only one team (BYU) made the tournament. That was the MW's second season. But year No. 11 was special as a then-record four teams made the NCAA Tournament in 2009-10 with New Mexico (regular-season champs), UNLV, BYU and San Diego State (conference tournament champs) all won at least 25 games and qualified for the Big Dance. Alas, the postseason was once again unkind as the MW went 2-4 in the NCAA Tournament with wins from New Mexico (over a 14 seed before getting drubbed by an 11 seed in the second round) and BYU (over a 10 seed). And with no team from the league reaching the Sweet 16, this is not the MW's best year ever.\n\nThe case for 2010-11\n\nOne year later, the MW was a national darling thanks to the emergence of two seminal stars in BYU's Jimmer Fredette and SDSU's Kawhi Leonard, who lifted their respective teams to top-five rankings. The Cougars peaked at No. 3 and the Aztecs at No. 4. Those are two of the four teams in MW history to reach the top five along with 2018-19 Nevada and 2019-20 SDSU. UNLV also reached the Top 25 that season, giving the MW three NCAA Tournament teams. New Mexico and Colorado State flirted with the NCAA Tournament before falling to the NIT. The MW went 4-3 in that year's NCAA Tournament with SDSU and BYU both reaching the Sweet 16, the only time in league history two MW teams reached the second weekend in the same tournament. Each was felled in the Sweet 16 with BYU losing to Florida in overtime and SDSU to UConn by seven (the Huskies like beating the Aztecs in this tournament). Florida and UConn were both top-three seeds withUConn winning the national title, so there was no shame in those close losses. That year's SDSU and BYU teams rank first and third, respectively, in MW history in KenPom adjusted efficiency margin. Given the MW had two legitimate top-10 teams in the nation (plus three other strong squads), I declare this the best season in MW history by a narrow margin over the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
