        "text": "The SEC champion wasn’t decided until the final day of the regular season … and we have a tie. Kentucky entered Saturday with a one-game lead over Tennessee, but the Wildcats lost at home to Vanderbilt, 12-4. The Vols, meanwhile, completed a sweep of South Carolina with a 4-1 win in Knoxville.\n\nBoth teams are 22-8 in the league, but Tennessee — which won two out of three in Lexington last month — will be the No. 1 seed at the SEC Tournament. And Kentucky, despite sharing the league title, will be the No. 3 seed in Hoover this week because the No. 2 seed goes to the SEC West champion Arkansas.\n\nTennessee has won the SEC championship two times in the past three seasons and five times overall. Kentucky has two titles in its history, 2006 and 2024.\n\nTennessee seemingly has the inside track to be the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, though Kentucky is still very much in the mix and can jump the Vols with a stronger showing at the SEC tournament.\n\nAround the horn\n\nThere was incredible drama in the Pac-12, where the final regular-season championship in league history (for now) went down to the final inning of the final game.\n\nAfter taking the first two games of the series in Tucson, Oregon State held a half-game lead over Arizona heading into Saturday night’s finale. The Beavers scored one run in the top of the ninth to take a 3-2 lead, but Arizona punched back and won it with a two-run double off the wall by outfielder Brendan Summerhill with one out.\n\nBarring something wild at the Pac-12 tournament in Scottsdale, Ariz., this week, the league is looking at three bids in the NCAA Tournament. Arizona and Oregon State should be joined by Oregon, which is 37-16 overall and 19-11 in the league with an RPI of 47.\n\nCal could play its way onto the bubble with a deep run. The Golden Bears are 34-18 overall and 17-13 in the league with a 65 RPI.\n\nUSC likely needs to win the league tournament to reach a Regional, but the Trojans have won at least 17 conference games in consecutive seasons for the first time since the early 2000s.\n\nThe first day of the SEC tournament has never been more intriguing.\n\nFive teams are tied for seventh place with a 13-17 record in the league, and all five will play on Tuesday. Each team’s RPI is 30 or better, which suggests all five are in decent shape to receive an at-large bid. If all five do make it, the SEC would send a record 11 teams to the NCAA Tournament. Here’s a quick look at the SEC’s bubble, in order of seed at the SEC tournament, with each team’s RPI and KPI (a metric the selection committee will be using this year) as well as first-round opponent:\n\nNo. 7 Alabama (33-21 overall, RPI 18, KPI 17, vs. South Carolina)\n\nNo. 8 Vanderbilt (35-20 overall, RPI 27, KPI 19, vs. Florida)\n\nNo. 9 Florida (28-26 overall, RPI 24, KPI 20, vs Vanderbilt)\n\nNo. 10 South Carolina (33-21, RPI 19, KPI 22, vs. Alabama)\n\nNo. 11 LSU (36-20, RPI 30, KPI 21 vs. Georgia)\n\nHagen Smith finished off one of the best regular seasons in SEC history with a brilliant performance at Texas A&M on Thursday night. Arkansas’ left-hander allowed only two hits and struck out 14 with no walks in six shutout innings.\n\nTexas A&M’s Ryan Prager was outstanding as well, allowing five hits and no runs in seven innings. The Aggies won the game 1-0 on a two-out bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the 11th inning.\n\nHere are some numbers to illustrate just how good Smith has been:\n\nHe leads the nation in ERA (1.52), batting average against (.135) and strikeout percentage (50.2).\n\nHe allowed two earned runs or fewer in nine of 10 SEC starts — and just three in the other start.\n\nHe allowed five hits or fewer in all 10 SEC starts.\n\nHe struck out 10 or more in nine of 10 SEC starts despite pitching more than six innings just once.\n\nNorth Carolina won its first ACC title since 2018 after taking two out of three from Duke in Durham. The Tar Heels are 41-23 overall and 22-8 in the ACC with a top-five RPI.\n\nIn league games only, UNC led the ACC in slugging (.560) and ERA (4.72) — typically a formula for success.\n\nThe Tar Heels are in a three-team pod at the ACC tournament with eighth-seeded Wake Forest and 12th-seeded Pittsburgh.\n\nNC State strengthened an already impressive resume by sweeping Wake Forest in Raleigh. The Wolfpack, 32-19 overall and 18-11 in the ACC with an RPI of 14, are in prime position to be one of the 16 Regional hosts. They have 12 Quad 1 wins, tied for fifth-most in the country.\n\nIllinois swept Purdue in West Lafayette to secure its first Big Ten title since 2015. The Fighting Illini finished 16-8, two games up on Nebraska. Those two teams, with RPIs of 43 (Illinois) and 31 (Nebraska), are in very good shape to earn an at-large bid no matter what happens at the Big Ten Tournament in Omaha.\n\nAfter that? It’s not great. Maryland played its way out of consideration by getting swept by Penn State. The Terps have a top-50 RPI but finished 10-14 in the league (11th place). Indiana is 30-22-1 and 15-9 with a 60 RPI. A strong week could put the Hoosiers on the bubble.\n\nSenior day was extra special for the Hannahs family. With Indiana State concluding the regular season at Valparaiso, ISU coach Mitch Hannahs was able to be in attendance for his son Kaleb’s final college game.\n\nKaleb, the 2021 Missouri Valley Conference Freshman of the Year, finished the 2024 season second on the Beacons with a .283 average. Valpo did not qualify for the MVC tournament.\n\nIndiana State won the MVC by five games over Murray State and Evansville and will be the No. 1 seed in the tournament. The Sycamores, with a top-10 RPI, are virtually assured to host a Regional.\n\nThe Big 12 looks to have four NCAA Tournament locks heading into the league tournament — Oklahoma (the regular-season champs), Oklahoma State, Texas and West Virginia.\n\nHere’s where some of the Big 12’s bubble teams stand heading into the tournament, in order of conference finish:\n\nCincinnati (31-23 overall, 17-13 Big 12, RPI 55, KPI 46)\n\nKansas State (31-22 overall, 15-15 Big 12, RPI 42, KPI 41)\n\nKansas (29-21 overall, 15-15 Big 12, RPI 73, KPI 55)\n\nUCF (33-18 overall, 14-15 Big 12, RPI 41, KPI 36)\n\nTCU (31-19 overall, 14-16 Big 12, RPI 39, KPI 30)\n\nAnd finally …\n\n• Charlie Condon continues to lead the nation in both batting average (.451) and home runs (35) heading into the postseason.\n\n• Air Force won its first-ever Mountain West championship thanks to a season-ending sweep over Fresno State in Colorado Springs. The Falcons, 18-12, edged New Mexico by one game and Fresno State, Nevada and San Jose State by two games.\n\n• Louisville rallied late in the year to finish with a winning record in the ACC (16-14), but the Cards — with a 52 RPI and 42 KPI — will likely need to pick up a few quality wins at the league tournament in Charlotte. Louisville is in a pod with No. 2 seed Clemson and No. 11 seed Miami.\n\n• Five of the eight teams in the Big East ended the regular season with RPIs in the top 70, but the other three are 170 or worse. UConn, at 17-4, won the league by three games over St. John’s.\n\n• USCB is three games up on UC Irvine in the Big West with one weekend remaining (the Big West does not have a tournament). The Gauchos host UC Riverside (5-21 in the league) while Irvine hosts CSUN (15-11).\n\n• Charleston held on to win the Coastal Athletic Association by 1.5 games over UNCW. Northeastern, which finished in third place, has the league’s best RPI at 29. Charleston is at 50, UNCW at 48. Barring a CAA tournament title, Campbell’s streak of Regional appearances will end at five.\n\n• Louisiana Tech edged Dallas Baptist for the Conference USA title. Both teams are safely in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n• The expected wild finish in the Sun Belt never materialized. Louisiana (20-10) ended up winning the title by three games over Southern Miss. The Sun Belt is ranked fifth in the RPI and has nine teams in the top 100.\n\n• Maryland-Eastern Shore finished the season 0-48, the first winless Division I team since St. Peter’s in 2017.\n\n(Photos of Christian Moore, Trey Pooser: Angelina Alcantar / News Sentinel, Cyndi Chambers / Gainesville Sun]"
