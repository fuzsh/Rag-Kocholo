        "text": "The Mountain West is an association of universities dedicated to excellence in their primary missions in teaching, research and service to their publics. A key element of the Mountain West philosophy is to foster intercollegiate athletic programs in a manner that will enhance the academic advancement, character development, athletic potential and well-being of student-athletes. The Mountain West Awards program is designed to honor those individuals who have achieved success inside and outside the athletic arena.\n\nFrom the outset, Mountain West member institutions have been committed to creating strong academic relationships, as well as athletic competition. To that end, the chief academic officers of each institution have explored academic exchange programs, library crossovers and shared research. In addition, the faculty athletics representatives routinely provide academic assistance and test-taking services for student-athletes visiting from fellow member institutions for competition.\n\nThe Mountain West provides a first-class athletic and academic experience for more than 5,100 student-athletes each year. Over the past 18 years, 42 Mountain West student-athletes have earned NCAA Postgraduate Scholarships, and since the league’s inception in 1999, an additional 36 student-athletes have been named MW Scholar-Athlete of the Year and awarded league-sponsored postgraduate scholarships. Four Mountain West student-athletes have earned distinction as Rhodes Scholars (Jessica Mellinger, Wyoming and Delavane Diaz, Brittany Morreale and Rebecca Esselstein, Air Force).\n\nNational Recognition\n\nAcademic All-Americans\n\nSince the inception of the Conference in 1999-2000, the Mountain West has produced 190 Academic All-America selections among its 18 sponsored sports.\n\nNCAA Postgraduate Scholarship Recipients\n\nOver the past 25 years, 50 Mountain West student-athletes have earned NCAA Postgraduate Scholarships, and an additional 50 student-athletes have been named MW Scholar-Athlete of the Year and awarded league-sponsored postgraduate scholarships.\n\nMountain West Student-Athlete Awards\n\nScholar-Athlete of the Year | Past Winners\n\nThe Mountain West Scholar-Athlete of the Year Award is the highest honor presented to a student-athlete by the Conference. The award is bestowed annually to one male and one female who best exemplify the term “student-athlete” by achieving excellence in academics, athletics and community involvement. In addition to athletic achievement, recipients of the MW Scholar-Athlete of the Year Award must have a minimum 3.5 cumulative grade point average, demonstrate leadership, and exhibit good character and conduct on and off the playing field. Each honoree receives a postgraduate scholarship.\n\nAthlete of the Year | Past Winners\n\nThe Mountain West Athlete of the Year awards are bestowed annually to one male and one female student-athlete who have achieved athletic excellence during the past academic year. In addition to superior athletic achievement, criterion for the MW Athlete of the Year Award requires that nominees be in good academic standing throughout their season of competition, and demonstrate good character and conduct on and off the playing field.\n\nAcademic All-Conference | Past Winners\n\nThe Mountain West Academic All-Conference Award is presented following the fall and spring semesters. To be eligible for selection, student-athletes must have completed at least one academic term at a member institution while maintaining a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or better, and are starters or significant contributors on their athletic teams.\n\nScholar-Athlete Award | Past Winners\n\nPresented annually, the Mountain West Scholar-Athlete Award is one of the highest academic honors bestowed by the Conference. To be eligible for selection, student-athletes must have completed at least two academic terms at the member institution, while maintaining a cumulative grade point average of 3.5 or better, and have participated in varsity competition in an MW-sponsored sport.\n\nOther Mountain West Awards\n\nHal Rothman Sportsmanship Award | Past Winners\n\nEstablished in 2005-06 and re-named in honor of the late UNLV faculty athletics representative Hal Rothman, the Mountain West Hal Rothman Sportsmanship Award is presented to a student-athlete in a MW-sponsored sport who has distinguished him or herself through sportsmanship and ethical behavior. The student-athlete also must demonstrate good citizenship outside of the sports-competition setting and be in good academic standing.\n\nCommissioner’s Award | Past Winners\n\nThe Commissioner’s Award may be presented to an individual who, through dedicated effort and service, has achieved a singularly distinguished accomplishment during the current academic year that has significantly enhanced the Mountain West or a member institution."
