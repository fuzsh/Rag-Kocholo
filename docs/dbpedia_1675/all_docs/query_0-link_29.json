Two of the best in Ralph Michaels and Jeff Michaels put this comprehensive guide together so get prepped for the 2023 College Football season with WagerTalk!\n\nMountain West Conference Championship Sleeper – Colorado State (+2000)\n\nWith how wide open the Mountain West Conference should be this season, there are various reasons to consider Colorado State this year’s version of Utah State in 2021 who went from 1-5 in a shortened 2020 season to 11-3 in 2021 winning the Mountain West Championship.\n\nThe Rams will work tirelessly during the offseason to revamp an offensive line that allowed the most sacks of any FBS team in 2022.\n\nThey do return six starters on the offensive side of the ball including QB Clay Millen, RB Avery Morrow and WR Troy Horton. In addition Colorado State signed one of the highest recruits in school history in RB Damian Henderson.\n\nAlthough this offensive line was one of the worst in the country Millen still completed 72% of his passes which was tops in the nation. That’s mostly due to the intense pressure he always received leading to mostly screens and short passes.\n\nThey NEED more production on offense though as they only scored 13.2 points per game! Their passing offense was bottom 25 in the nation and rushing offense bottom five.\n\nWe have to believe these stats will improve this season to go along with a defense returning 15 of their top 20 tacklers as they allowed less than 20 points per game during conference play.\n\nThey avoid playing Fresno State and close the season with games against Nevada and Hawaii. As long as this Rams team can go 3-3 or 4-2 heading into those last games, Colorado State should have an outside shot at winning the Mountain West Conference Championship.\n\nMountain West Conference Championship Bust – Fresno State (+380)\n\nFresno State rides nine straight wins into the 2023 season including a LA Bowl win over Washington State.\n\nThey started last season 1-4 en route to a Mountain West Championship which was won mostly due to QB Jake Haener getting healthy and returning after missing four games in the first part of the 2022 season. He’s off to the NFL now as well as RB Jordan Mims.\n\nThey also lost their top three receivers and offensive coordinator which will be a lot to make up if they want to repeat as Mountain West Conference Champions. Arguably their two best defensive players are gone as well in David Perales and Evan Williams.\n\nThis year’s QB battle will be between Logan Fife and UCF transfer Mikey Keene. Haener filled in for Haener last season throwing for only two touchdowns and six interceptions with Keene throwing for six touchdowns and one interception in four games played for the Golden Knights in 2022.\n\nWith so many changes on both sides of the ball for Fresno State we can’t see them repeating as Mountain West Conference Champions.\n\nMountain West Conference Championship Expert Prediction – Air Force (+400)\n\nJunior Jensen Jones looks to be taking over at quarterback for the Falcons who rolled out the #1 total defense in the nation allowing only 256.4 total yards per game.\n\nThey were 3rd in scoring defense at just 13.3 ppg allowed and returning eight of 11 starters on that side of the ball. Jones will heavily lean on this defense as he takes over for former Falcons QB Haaziq Daniels.\n\nAll three losses in 2022 were one-score games en route to an Armed Forces Bowl win over Baylor 30-15. They return four starters on the offensive line that will be heavily relied upon as well as the top rusher (Brad Roberts) and top receiver (David Cormier) won’t be returning for Air Force.\n\nThat shouldn’t be a problem for this triple option offense that produced over 4,200 yards on the ground last season. They do return running back John Lee Eldridge III who compiled 99 rushing attempts at 7.7 yards per carry.\n\nIf you don’t include the shortened 2020 season this Air Force team has won 10 games in three straight seasons and plays the easiest schedule in the Mountain West Conference.\n\nThey avoid playing Fresno State this season and get Utah State and Wyoming both at home, who were two of the three losses for the Falcons in 2022.\n\nAs long as Jones can avoid making mistakes in the backfield and drain clock on the offensive side of the ball, look for this Falcons team to seriously compete for a Mountain West Championship come December.\n\nCollege Football and NFL Week 1 Betting\n\nSteve Merril and Teddy Covers run through betting tips and advice when it comes to betting the first week of college football and NFL action.
