The game will be shown regionally on ESPN+Plus as the MWC \"Game of the Week.\"\n\nQuickly On Utah\n\nThe Runnin' Utes are 19-6 overall and 9-3 in the Mountain West Conference. Utah is tied with Wyoming for first place in the league standings entering the final week of the regular season. The Utes finish on the road, playing Colorado State on Thursday at 7:07 p.m. (MST) in Fort Collins, Colo., and Wyoming on Saturday at 1:07 p.m. (MST) in Laramie, Wyo. The Utes are 5-3 on opponents' home courts this season, including a 3-2 mark in conference games. Since starting out 3-3, the Utes have won 16 of the last 19 contests. Last weekend, the Runnin' Utes lost at Brigham Young, 63-61, on Saturday afternoon.\n\nJunior 6-9 forward Britton Johnsen leads the Runnin' Utes in scoring (13.4 ppg) and rebounding (6.3 rpg). Sophomore 6-4 guard Nick Jacobson is second on the team in scoring (12.9 ppg), shooting 45.0 percent (59-of-131) from three-point range.

He previously served as an assistant coach for two seasons at CSU (1998-2000) and was the head coach for nine seasons at Queens College (1989-98) in Charlotte, N.C. Layer led the Rams to a 15-13 overall record and a 6-8 mark in the MWC to tie for fifth place last season.

Layer built the Division II program at Queens from the ground up and went 168-87 (.659), twice earning NCAA Regional Coach of the Year honors. Layer took Queens College to the national tournament twice and produced eight consecutive winning seasons.\n\nUtah-Colorado State Series Notes\n\n* Utah and Colorado State meet for the 126th time on Thursday night. The series dates back to a 41-25 win by Utah on Jan. 2, 1937. The two teams have met every year since 1969-70 with the exception of the 1998-99 season.\n\n* The Runnin' Utes lead the all-time series 87-38 and won the first meeting this season, 67-62 on Feb. 2 in Salt Lake City.\n\n* In conference play, Utah has an 80-33 advantage.\n\n* In Fort Collins, Colo., the Utes are 33-23. The Utes had won four in a row over the Rams in Moby Arena before losing the last two years. Utah's last win in Fort Collins was 60-48 on Feb. 14, 1998.\n\n* Utah's most decisive win over Colorado State during the Rick Majerus era was 35 points (92-57) on Feb. 11, 1995 in the Huntsman Center.\n\n* Colorado State's most decisive win against Utah under Rick Majerus was 19 points (67-48) on Jan. 18, 1992.\n\n* Rick Majerus is 14-6 against Colorado State all-time with all of those games taking place during his tenure at Utah. Majerus is 8-2 against CSU in Salt Lake City and 6-3 in Fort Collins.\n\n* Dale Layer is 1-2 against Utah during his tenure at CSU.\n\nThe Last Time Around\n\nBritton Johnsen scored a career-high 28 points as Utah defeated Colorado State 67-62 on Feb. 2 in Salt Lake City for the Utes' 13th straight win. Jeff Johnsen added 15 points for the Utes. Brian Greene scored 29 points for CSU (9-11, 1-5).\n\nBritton Johnsen made 9-of-10 shots from the field but converted just 7-of-16 free throws, missing six of his last seven attempts to make things interesting.\n\nUtah never trailed but Greene made three straight field goals to bring the Rams within 45-40 with 13:48 to play. The Utes responded with a 10-0 run, capped by Jeff Johnsen's three-pointer with 10:06 remaining for a 55-40 lead. The Rams couldn't trim the lead under seven points until the final minute of the game. But the Utes shot 5-of-15 from the line in the second half to give the Rams a chance.\n\nGreene made a free throw and a tip-in and then Freddy Robinson made two free throws to get CSU within 66-62 with 17 seconds to play. Britton Johnsen finally made the back end of a two free throw set and Utah held on for the victory. Travis Spivey and Britton Johnsen went 1-of-10 from the line in the final 5:03 of the game.\n\nThe Rams, who got 10 points from Andy Birley and Joe Macklin, were just the second team to shoot better than 50 percent and lose to the Utes this season. Utah shot 58.8 percent from the field and attempted 32 free throws while CSU took just 13, making seven.\n\nUtah outshot Colorado State 58.8 to 51.0 percent from the field. The Rams had a 45.5 to 45.0 edge on three-point shooting and a 26 to 23 advantage on the boards.\n\nLast Season In Fort Collins\n\nJohn Sivesind scored a career-high 27 points and went 5-for-5 on three-pointers as Colorado State used its perimeter game to deal Utah a 73-65 loss in Fort Collins, Colo., on Jan. 22. Sivesind was 8-for-9 on field goals. Ron Grady was 2-for-4 on three-pointers and had 12 points for Colorado State, which finished 9-for-19 on three-pointers.\n\nBritton Johnsen led Utah with 20 points. Nick Jacobson added 13 points for Utah, which shot 54 percent from the field. Utah hit 11-of-22 shots in the first half, but turned the ball over 10 times and trailed 41-27 at halftime.\n\nColorado State shot 49 percent in the first half with Sivesind scoring 18 points and hitting all four three-point attempts, two of them in the first four minutes to give the Rams an 11-3 start. Utah pulled to 48-38 in the second half on Phil Cullen's uncontested layup and two free throws by Johnsen. Trailing 50-38 after a Grady fadeaway, Utah went on a 9-2 run to close the gap to 52-47. The Utes stayed within striking distance, but Colorado State converted 7-of-10 free throws, four by Sivesind in the last 1:30, to offset three-pointers by Britton Johnsen and Jeff Johnsen.\n\nUtes Runnin' Toward 10th 20-Win Season Under Majerus\n\nWith its next win, Utah will reach the 20 wins plateau for the 10th time in 13 years under Rick Majerus. Two of those years he did not coach the entire season. The Utes have won 20 games in each of the last six seasons with Majerus on the bench (he missed all but the first game of last season when Utah finished 19-12). Majerus' 20-win seasons at Utah: 1990-91 (30-4), 1991-92 (24-11), 1992-93 (24-7), 1994-95 (28-6), 1995-96 (27-7), 1996-97 (29-4), 1997-98 (30-4), 1998-99 (28-5), 1999-2000 (23-9).\n\nSeven Straight Championships Best in the Nation\n\nThe Utes have won seven consecutive regular-season conference titles and nine overall in the Rick Majerus era, dating back to the 1989-90 season. Utah's string of seven straight titles is tied with Cincinnati's as the longest active streak in the nation.\n\nUtah won the WAC regular-season championship outright in 1991 and shared it in 1993 before winning five straight outright titles from 1995-99 (the last three being divisional titles). Utah went 10-4 in conference play in 1999-2000 to share the inaugural Mountain West Conference championship with UNLV. The Utes also went 10-4 in 2000-01 to take the title with Brigham Young and Wyoming.\n\nTough Trip Ahead\n\nThe road swing along the front range of the Rocky Mountains hasn't been any easy one for the Utes in recent years. In fact, Utah hasn't won at both Colorado State and Wyoming since the 1990-91 season. That year, the two games weren't played as one road trip. The Utes won at Wyoming on Jan. 17 (90-83) and won at Colorado State on Feb. 21 (67-56).\n\nThe last two seasons, the Utes have been swept on the trip by the Rams and Cowboys. In 1999-2000, Utah fell at Colorado State on Feb. 26 (60-49) and at Wyoming on Feb. 28 (88-61). In 2000-01, the Utes lost to the Cowboys on Jan. 20 (78-77 in OT) and the Rams on Jan. 22 (73-65).\n\nGreat Britton: Johnsen Named First Team All-District\n\nJunior forward Britton Johnsen (6-9, 213) was named to the NABC/Pontiac All-District 13 first team on Feb. 12. Britton leads the Utes in scoring (13.4 ppg) and rebounding (6.3 rpg). Dating back to last season, Johnsen has scored in double figures in 35 of the last 50 contests-including 21 of the 25 games this season. He earned second team all-Mountain West Conference honors in 2000-01.\n\n* Johnsen had his fourth double-double of the season with 15 points and a career-best 13 rebounds against Brigham Young on Feb. 23. Johnsen also had a double-double with 23 points-his third highest total this season-and 11 rebounds against New Mexico on Feb. 18. He shot 3-of-5 from three-point range to go with five assists in 31 minutes. Johnsen also made the winning free throw with 7.6 seconds left in the 66-65 win over the Lobos.\n\n* The Murray, Utah, native has led the Utes in rebounding 11 of the 15 games since starting center Chris Burgess was injured against Texas. During that stretch, Johnsen has averaged 7.7 rebounds per game.\n\n* In Mountain West Conference games, Britton is leading the team in scoring (16.0 ppg), rebounding (8.0 rpg) and field goal percentage (56.9). Johnsen is also shooting 41.0 percent from beyond the arc.\n\n* Johnsen scored at least 20 points in three consecutive games Jan. 21 through Feb. 2. During that time, he averaged 24.3 points per game while shooting 65.7 percent from the floor and 50.0 percent from three-point range. After posting 25 points against New Mexico on Jan. 21, Johnsen then came back with his second double-double of the season-and the second in four games-with 20 points and 10 rebounds against BYU on Jan. 28. He converted 10-of-12 free throws against the Cougars to set career highs in both makes and attempts. He got a career-high 28 points, shooting 9-of-10 from the field and 3-of-4 from three-point range, against Colorado State on Feb. 2. For his efforts, Johnsen was named the MWC Player of the Week on Feb. 4.\n\nJeff: The Older Half of Johnsen & Johnsen\n\nSenior guard/forward Jeff Johnsen (6-4, 204) joins his younger brother Britton in the Utah lineup. Jeff, who has started the last 21 games, is third on the team in scoring (10.0 ppg), second in assists (2.9 apg) and first in steals (1.4 spg). Johnsen has scored in double figures 13 times this season, including 10 of the last 14 games.\n\n* Johnsen tied a career-high with 20 points against San Diego State on Feb. 9. He also tied a career-best with five three-pointers and set a personal best with nine attempts. Johnsen made 7-of-12 field goals overall and had four rebounds in 32 minutes against the Aztecs.\n\n* In Mountain West Conference games, Johnsen is averaging 11.5 points (second-best on the team), 3.3 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. He has shot 39.5 percent from three-point range (17-of-43). Johnsen had a career-high of seven assists against New Mexico on both Feb. 18 and Jan. 21.\n\n* Jeff and Britton Johnsen combined to score 35 of Utah's 71 points against BYU on Jan. 28, 43 of 67 points against Colorado State on Feb. 2, 33 of 70 points against San Diego State on Feb. 9 and 29 of 59 points against Air Force on Feb. 16.\n\n* Rick Majerus has literally made his program a family affair at Utah. The Johnsens are the fifth set of brothers to play for Majerus spanning his 13-year career at the U. However, they are the first brothers to play together.\n\nJacobson Named Second Team All-District\n\nSophomore guard Nick Jacobson (6-4, 198) was named to the NABC/Pontiac All-District 13 second team on Feb. 12. Jacobson is second on the team in scoring (12.9 ppg) and leads the way in three-point shooting, hitting 45.0 percent and averaging 2.36 makes per game. He has scored in double figures in 17 of the 25 games this season.\n\n* In the NCAA statistical rankings released on Tuesday, Jacobson was 19th in three-point percentage (45.0).\n\n* In a three-game stretch against UNLV (Jan. 12), San Diego State (Jan. 14) and Air Force (Jan. 19), the Fargo, N.D., native made 16-of-24 (66.7) from beyond the arc. Jacobson put up a career-high 26 points against UNLV. He hit five treys in eight attempts and converted 9-of-15 field goals overall. He had 25 points against San Diego State, tying the school record with seven three-pointers (in 10 attempts) and hitting 9-of-14 from the field. Jacobson's 19 points (4-of-6 on threes) was a game high in the overtime win at Air Force as he played the entire 45 minutes. He was named the Mountain West Conference Player of the Week on Jan. 21.\n\n* Jacobson has already climbed into the ninth place in career three-pointers made at Utah with 96.\n\n* Last season, Jacobson was named the 2000-01 Mountain West Conference Freshman of the Year, becoming the first Ute to garner conference Freshman of the Year honors since Keith Van Horn in 1993-94. Jacobson made the top 10 in five statistical categories on the all-time freshman charts at Utah last season. He ranked eighth in scoring (245 points), eighth in scoring average (7.9 ppg), second in three-pointers made (37), first in three-pointers attempted (97) and first in free throw percentage (.806).\n\nGetting to the Point with Spivey\n\nSenior point guard Travis Spivey (6-1, 212) has 110 assists (4.6 per game) to 60 turnovers (1.83:1 ratio) this season. Spivey has had fewer than two turnovers in nine games in 2001-02. He is also averaging 6.8 points per game and is second on the team in defensive rebounds (86).\n\n* Spivey has picked up his scoring during the Mountain West Conference season. He has averaged 7.6 points per game while shooting 52.7 percent from the field and 43.8 percent from beyond the arc. Spivey had his best scoring game of the conference season with 15 points, shooting 4-of-5 from the field and 7-of-8 from the free throw line, against BYU on Jan. 28. He also had three steals in the game. Spivey scored in double figures for the fourth time in the conference season with 12 points, hitting 5-of-9 from the field, against Brigham Young on Feb. 23.\n\n* The Myrtle Beach, S.C., native has had career highs in all three major statistical categories this season. Most recently, Spivey had a career-best 12 rebounds against San Diego State on Feb. 9. He also posted personal bests of 10 assists against Pepperdine on Dec. 1 and 18 points against Utah State on Nov. 23.\n\n* Spivey rounded into form as the 2000-01 season wore on after transferring from Salt Lake Community College. Spivey started the final 19 games of the season at the point, playing over 30 minutes in seven of those games. In the final 16 games of the regular season, the Myrtle Beach, S.C., native had 75 assists to 33 turnovers (2.3:1 ratio). He averaged 4.7 assists and 7.3 points per game, scoring in double figures four times during that stretch.\n\nCullen Climbing the Career Charts After A Summer on the Mound\n\nSenior forward Phil Cullen (6-9, 221) has already moved into the top 10 on numerous career charts at Utah. Cullen ranks fifth in three-pointers made (141), fourth in three-pointers attempted (361) and ninth in blocked shots (63). He has started 42 games during his Utah career.\n\n* This season, Cullen is averaging 6.6 points and 2.7 rebounds in 15.7 minutes per game off the bench. He is shooting 45.0 percent from three-point range.\n\n* Getting more playing time since the injury to Chris Burgess against Texas on Dec. 29, Cullen has increased his productivity. In Mountain West Conference play, Cullen is averaging 7.8 points per game while connecting on 45.8 percent (22-for-48) of his three-point attempts.
