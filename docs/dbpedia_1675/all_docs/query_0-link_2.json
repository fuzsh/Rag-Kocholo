The winner of the tournament receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\n\nTournament\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament is a four-team double-elimination tournament held annually at various location in the Mountain West Conference region. The winner receives an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I baseball tournament. The other teams have to hope for an at-large bid.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament began in 2000 as a six team double elimination tournament. It maintained that format through 2005. In 2006, with the addition of TCU, the tournament expanded to include all seven teams. However, in 2007 the format returned to a six team bracket, with the seventh place regular season team left out of the field. In 2012, with only five teams in the league, the tournament consisted of a four team double elimination tournament.\n\nChampions\n\n[edit]\n\nBy year\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tournament is hosted by the previous year's regular season champion.[1]\n\nYear School Site MVP 2000 San Diego State Earl Wilson Stadium • Las Vegas, Nevada , San Diego State 2001 BYU Tony Gwynn Stadium • San Diego, California , BYU 2002 BYU Larry H.
