        "text": "The Nevada athletic department is coming off back-to-back seasons without a Mountain West titles, but the Wolf Pack has won plenty of conference championships in its history. In fact, it has won125 conference championships all-time, including 10 in 12 seasons in the Mountain West. Below is a list of which Nevada programs have won the most conference championships in its history, per the . That list does not include sports Nevada no longer sponsors, which includes men's track and field (18 conference championships), boxing (three) and rifle (one). Also included is a summary in each of those sports.\n\nNevada conference titles by sport\n\n28 — Men's basketball: The Wolf Pack has four MW titles in men's hoops (all under Eric Musselman), its most in any sport. It also won eight in the WAC, one in the Big West and five in the Big Sky. It won 11 conference championships before joining the Division I ranks. While Nevada was largely known as a football school as it climbed from Division II to Division I and through the Big Sky to the Big West, WAC and MW, it is actually hoops that has hung the most banners (twice as many as football).\n\n14 — Football: Nevada's football history is strong, but the Wolf Pack hasn't won a conference title since 2010. That was one of seven conference championships for Nevada football since joining the FBS in 1992. Five came in the Big West from 1992-97 with just two since then over the last 26 seasons (2005 and 2010, both in the WAC). The Wolf Pack also won four Big Sky titles from 1983-91 and three in the Far West Conference in the 1930s.\n\n11 — Men's cross country: Nevada reinstated men's cross country as a Division I program in 2019 after being a powerhouse program in the 1970s and 1980s. The Wolf Pack won eight championships in theWest Coast Athletic Conference and three in the Big Sky from 1970-83, claiming its conference crown 11 times in a 14-year period. Now, Nevada competes in the MW, which is an elite cross-country conference thanks to its high-elevation schools.\n\n10 — Baseball: Wolf Pack baseball has won three MW titles, including the first in school history in 2015 under Jay Johnson. Coach TJ Bruce added MW crowns in 2018 and 2021. Nevada also won four Big West championships if you include divisional titles in 1997 and 1998. It won Far West Conference championships in 1965 and 1966. All 10 of the Wolf Pack's championships have been regular-season titles. Nevada baseball has never won a conference tournament in 18 tries.\n\n10 — Women's swimming and diving: Nevada has only won one MW championship in a women's sport since moving to the conference in 2012. That was the 2016 swimming and diving title under coaches Neil Harper and Jian Li You. The Wolf Pack had a strong run from 1996-2009 when it won five Big West titles and three WAC titles (eight total) over 14 seasons. Nevada also won thePacific Collegiate Conference in 1992. More often than not, it has placed top three in the MW.\n\n9 — Skiing: The Wolf Pack brought skiing back as a Division I sport in 2022 and will once again compete for championships. It won conference titles in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1970s and 1990s, including six in thePacific Coast Conference and three in theUnited States Collegiate Ski Association. The Wolf Pack now competes in the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association.\n\n6 — Men's golf: Nevada has reached four NCAA Regionals since 2018 but has not won a MW title during that period. The Wolf Pack won three straightWest Coast Athletic Conference's from 1977-79, Big Sky titles in 1984 and 1986 and a WAC title in 2007. This program has been one of Nevada's strongest since moving to the MW with the biggest missing piece to therésumé being a conference championship.\n\n5 — Men's tennis: Wolf Pack men's tennis is the school's most recent champion after sweeping the regular season and conference tournament in 2022. That broke a 40-year championship drought as Nevada's most recent title before that was the 1982 Big Sky championship. It also won the Big Sky in 1981 and theWest Coast Athletic Conference in 1971.\n\n3 — Softball: Nevada softball returned as a Division I program in 2003 and quickly won three WAC titles, including in 2006, 2008 and 2009. The Wolf Pack hasn't captured a MW title since moving to the conference in 2012 but came its closest this spring when it tied for second, one game out of first place during the regular season.\n\n3 — Women's track and field: Track and field teams have two cracks at titles each year because of the indoor and outdoor championship. Nevada women's track and field have won three titles, including the 2000 Big West (outdoor) and 2003 and 2004 WAC (both indoor). The Wolf Pack's highest finish at the MW championships was third place in the indoor in 2012.\n\n2 — Women's cross country: This program holds the distinction of winning the first women's conference championship in school history when it captured the1964California Collegiate Conference. It added a WAC title in 2003.\n\n1 — Women's soccer: Formed as a Division I program in 2000, Wolf Pack women's soccer has struggled almost every season since. But it did win the2006 WAC Tournament in a penalty shootout (4-2) after a scoreless regulation and extra period. That tournament was held at Mackay Stadium.\n\n1 — Women's tennis: Wolf Pack women's tennis won the1992 Big Sky tournament, which was hosted by Boise State. A round-robin format was used rather than a traditional bracket with Nevada going 5-0 in the nine-team tournament.\n\nThat leaves three active Wolf Pack programs without a conference championship, those being women's basketball, women's golf and volleyball. Women's golf finished one stroke shy of tying San Diego State for the2019 MW championship; volleyball has reached five NCAA tournaments but never won a conference title; and women's basketball reached the2009 WAC Tournament and 2018 MW Tournament title games before losing both in narrow fashion.\n\nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
