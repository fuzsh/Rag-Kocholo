        "text": "San Diego State completed a sweep of New Mexico on Saturday afternoon with an 8-6 victory at Tony Gwynn Stadium that earned SDSU the Mountain West regular season championship for the first time since 2004.\n\nSDSU (24-27, 18-11 MW) actually shares the title with San Jose State (27-24, 18-11), but why quibble?\n\nNot after what transpired a year ago for the Aztecs.\n\nTo realize how sweet this is, one must first revisit a 2022 season in which SDSU suffered through its worst year in a half century of Division I baseball.\n\nSDSU coach Mark Martinez didn’t want the Aztecs to turn the page. He wanted to post it as a reminder.\n\nEspecially the part about starting Mountain West play with a 1-14 record and missing the conference tournament for the first time in conference history.\n\n“I think that’s one of those things that there should be a little bit of a sour taste in your mouth and play with a little bit chip on your shoulder,” Martinez said coming into the season. “Everything was bad last year, so we do remind them — a lot. We don’t forget about it. We want to remember that because we don’t want to experience that again.”\n\nWhat they will experience again is the Mountain West Tournament. The four-day event begins Thursday in Fresno. The winner of the double-elimination tournament receives the MW’s automatic berth to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nSan Jose State receives the No. 1 seed by virtue of winning three of the five meetings against SDSU.\n\nNo. 2 seed SDSU plays No. 3 seed Air Force (26-29, 17-13) in the tournament opener Thursday at 11:30 a.m. The Spartans will play No. 4 seed and host Fresno State (29-25, 16-14) at 6 p.m.\n\nSDSU clinched a spot in the tournament with Thursday night’s victory over New Mexico, but the Aztecs needed a sweep for a taste of the title.\n\nFriday night’s win kept those hopes alive, although they were nearly dashed Saturday when New Mexico jumped out to a 6-1 lead just two innings into the game.\n\nA five-run second inning by the Lobos chased SDSU starter Chris Canada. Omar Serrano (1-5) came in and picked up his teammate, limiting the Lobos to one hit over 6 1/3 innings without allowing a run.\n\nSDSU’s offense got going with four runs in the third — Xavier Gonzalez’s two-run single was the key hit — that made it 6-5.\n\nThe Aztecs drew even on Poncho Ruiz’s sacrifice fly in the sixth, then moved ahead 8-6 on Tino Bethancourt’s two-run single to right field in the seventh.\n\nSerrano retired the side in order in the eighth inning.\n\nAnd eight was enough, given New Mexico had a plane to catch back to Albuquerque.\n\nSDSU will be traveling to Fresno in midweek, bidding for its seventh Mountain West Tournament championship. The Aztecs have won a conference-record six tourney titles (2000, 2013-15, 2017-18)."
