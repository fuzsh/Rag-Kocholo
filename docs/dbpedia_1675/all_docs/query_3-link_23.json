        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — The Mountain West Conference has announced its 25th season team for outdoor track & field prior to this week's conference championships. Wyoming had four former student-athletes on the list along with current Head Coach and Associate Head Coach of the Track & Field program, Bryan Berryhill and Quincy Howe.\n\nMASON FINLEY\n\nRepresented the United States at the 2020 Olympics qualifying for the Discus.

A two-time NCAA All-American in the triple jump, Howe also was an eight-time conference champion in that event — winning all eight conference championships in which he competed. He still holds the UW and Mountain West Conference records in both the indoor and outdoor triple jump with marks of 54′ 9 14″ and 54′ 4 3/4″. In 2002, he competed in the NACAC Games placing third and in the Commonwealth Games placing ninth, representing his native country of Trinidad and Tobago. He was also a Pan-Am Games team selection in 2003, and was named to the prestigious MWC 10th Anniversary Indoor Track & Field Team in the fall of 2008. Howe received his bachelor's degree in bioelectrical engineering from UW in 2003 and is pursuing a master's degree in biomechanics.\n\nJASON GERVAIS\n\nA seven-time all-America thrower, Gervais was the national runner-up in the discus in 2000. He holds the Mountain West conference record in the weight throw, and holds UW school records in the weight throw and discus. He held the school record in the shot put until it was broken in 2013 by Mason Finley. A four-time Mountain West champion, he won all-conference honors eight times. He was awarded the MW's Most Outstanding Male Performer at the 2000 MW Indoor Championships after winning both the 35-pound weight throw and the shot put. In 2009, he was honored by the Mountain West Conference as a member of the All-Decade Track & Field team. Gervais transferred to Wyoming after competing at Central Arizona College, where he was the junior college national champion in the discus and runner-up in the hammer throw. A native of Timmins, Ontario, Gervais represented Canada in the discus at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He also competed in the Canadian Championships, the World University Games, and the Pan Am Games. He majored in Business Administration at UW.\n\nSHAUNA SMITH\n\nOn June 11, 2005, Shauna Smith became the first woman in the history of the University of Wyoming to win an NCAA National Track and Field Championship as she won the 400-meter hurdles in a time of 54.32. The time set new Mountain West Conference and Wyoming outdoor records, which still stand today. Named the 2005 NCAA Women's Athlete of the Year for the Midwest Region by the United States Track Coaches Association, she also earned a spot on the 2005 US National Team and competed in the 2005 World Track and Field Championships. She was ranked as high as 5th in the world in the 400m hurdles in 2005. Competing in the 400m dash and as part of the 4 x 100 relay team as well as the 400m hurdles, she was a five-time All-American, a six-time MWC champion, and earned all-MWC honors fourteen times. She still holds the MWC and Wyoming records in the Indoor 400m dash, the Indoor 4 x 100 relay, and the Outdoor 400m hurdles. Individually or as part of a relay team, she holds six Wyoming records. At the 2004 U.S. Olympic Trials, she placed sixth in the 400-meter hurdles with a time of 54.42. Smith was also selected as the All-American Strength and Conditioning Athlete of the Year by the National Strength and Conditioning Association in 2004. With her eighth-place finish at the USA Track and Field Championships in 2003, she became the first Cowgirl hurdler in UW history to earn All-American honors. A native of Sheridan, Wyo., she was named the 2002 MWC Freshman of the Year for both the indoor and outdoor track and field seasons. Following her college career, Smith competed internationally for a few years.\n\nBRYAN BERRYHILL"
