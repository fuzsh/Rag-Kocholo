        "text": "It took a final surge and then a couple of pieces falling into place, but Nevada is in the field for the 2019 Mountain West baseball tournament.\n\nNot only that, but the Wolf Pack is also the host team and will get to play its games in the familiar confines of Don Weir Field at Peccole Park.\n\nThe four-team, double-elimination tournament begins Thursday. The championship game is scheduled for Saturday, with a second game to be played Sunday, if necessary.\n\nHere’s a look at the teams and the big storylines as the Mountain West prepares to determine its baseball champion.\n\nHappy to be at home\n\nNevada enters the tournament at 29-24 overall and 14-16 in Mountain West games, but also as one of the hottest teams in the field. The Wolf Pack’s four-game winning streak is tied with top seed Fresno State — which has won nine of its last 10 — for the longest entering the event.\n\nThe Pack came close to not playing in the event at all, but wrapped up its Mountain West season with a gutsy three-game road sweep at San Jose State, then clinched a spot a week later when the Spartans and Air Force managed to knock each other out of the field.\n\n“It’s an opportunity to play in front of your home fans,” Nevada head coach T.J. Bruce said earlier this week. “But we can’t really get so worried about and concerned about the outside (influences). We’ve got to worry about us and make us important.”\n\nNevada is 14-12 at Peccole Park this season.\n\nClose competition\n\nAlthough Fresno State eventually ran away with the Mountain West title at 20-8-1, the competition in conference play was actually remarkably close.\n\nThe Bulldogs and No. 2 seed San Diego State (16-13) were the only teams to finish with winning records in MW play. But the other five teams all won at least 11 conference games and lost at least 14. New Mexico, the seventh-place finisher, ended with a .411 winning percentage that’s robust for a last-place team.\n\nNo. 3 seed UNLV and Nevada both finished at 14-16, .005 percentage points in front of fifth-place Air Force (12-14).\n\nRanked team\n\nNevada opens the event with a Thursday game against Fresno State, which got into the national rankings this week.\n\nThe Bulldogs (35-14-1 overall) are ranked No. 23 by Baseball America and No. 25 by Collegiate Baseball. Fresno State is the first team to enter the Mountain West tournament with a national ranking since Nevada did so in 2015.\n\nNevada is in the tournament field for the fourth straight season. The Wolf Pack has not won a baseball title since joining the Mountain West.\n\nTournament-tested\n\nAlthough they're the No. 2 seed, defending tournament champion San Diego State could arguably be the team to beat in Reno. The Aztecs have won five of the last six Mountain West tournaments, coming up short only in 2016.\n\nNo other team has won more than four championships since the MW’s first baseball season in 2000; no current conference member has won more than three.\n\nPlayers to watch\n\n* Fresno State pitcher Ryan Jensen (10-1, 3.09): Nevada is likely to get a good look at Jensen, who should be the Bulldogs’ Thursday starter. His 10 wins were the most in the conference, while his 89 strikeouts were third.\n\n* UNLV shortstop Bryson Stott (.361, 10 home runs, 36 RBI): Stott appears to be a strong candidate for the Mountain West’s first first-round draft pick since 2015. He led the MW in on-base percentage (.489) and slugging percentage (.615). Stott is a semifinalist for the Golden Spikes Award (top amateur player in the nation) and Brooks Wallace Award (top collegiate shortstop).\n\n* San Diego State pitcher Adrian Mardueno (5-2, 1.48): He led the conference in ERA and opponent batting average (a measly .180) over 60-plus innings.\n\n* Nevada’s big hitters: The Wolf Pack led the Mountain West in fielding (.976) and was third in team ERA (4.61), but batted .270 for the season (ahead of only San Jose State’s .265). Nevada, which scored exactly three runs in each of its pivotal wins over the Spartans, will likely need more from its bats to advance in the tournament. The Pack is also capable of going long when it has to, led by 10 home runs apiece from Dillan Shrum and Weston Hatten, and eight by Joshua Zamora. In all, 13 Nevada players hit one or more homers in the regular season.\n\nMountain West tournament\n\nWhen: Thursday-Sunday\n\nWhere: Peccole Park\n\n2018 champion: San Diego State\n\n2019 records: Fresno State 35-14-1; San Diego State 32-23; UNLV 27-27; Nevada 29-24.\n\nFirst round (Thursday): San Diego State vs. UNLV, 2 p.m.; Nevada vs. Fresno State, 6:30 p.m."
