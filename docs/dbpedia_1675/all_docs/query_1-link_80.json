        "text": "Part One, Fall Sports\n\nPart Two, Winter Sports\n\nThe spring sports brought closure on the Falcons' inaugural season in the Mountain West Conference. This series begins with the baseball team.\n\nBaseball: A season that began with much uncertainty ended with excitement and promise - The Falcons embarked on the 2000 campaign with their third head coach in as many seasons. Reed Peters, the team's assistant coach in 1999, was named the acting head coach with many question marks surrounding the program. With the coaching staff going through an interim year, Peters and his staff would have to work with a very young and untested group of players. The Falcons had several freshmen that were expected to fill key roles and a young pitching staff with no seniors. With so many question marks, opening day against Hastings College would provide a sigh of relief. However, the week of the series, Mother Nature had other ideas. A snowstorm buried Falcon Field under more than two feet of snow and the opening series was cancelled.\n\nOvercoming a lot of adversity before the season even started, the Falcons put together the best record in five years and provided the most exciting finish to a season in many years. Air Force finished the regular season 23-34 overall and 6-23 in the inaugural Mountain West Conference. However, it was the final weekend that brought it all together. Air Force, the sixth seed in the six-team conference tournament, shocked the college baseball world by placing second in the MWC Tournament in Las Vegas, Nev. The Falcons rebounded from a lop-sided loss in the first round to upset two teams in the Falcons' first ever conference tournament appearance.\n\nThe season got off to a rocky start as Iowa State took two of three and then Virginia Military Institute won three of four from the Falcons as the season record stood at 2-5. Air Force then posted its longest winning streak of the year by winning five straight and 11 of the next 13. The Falcons, the defending champions of the Service Academies Classic, returned to the championship game for the second straight year. After a loss to 24th-ranked Notre Dame, the Falcons defeated Army and Navy by a combined score of 19-1. Ohio State, a team that won more than 50 games in 1999, defeated the Falcons, 5-4, in the championship game.\n\nThe team's 6-23 conference record may not look like an improvement on the surface, but a look inside the scores proves the team is closing the gap in the conference race. Air Force lost more close games this season and had the fewest blowout losses in five years. The Falcons lost seven MWC games by two runs ore less, including three by one run and two in the last at-bat.\n\nAir Force gained some respect not only in the conference, but in the nation as well in the final weekend of the season. The Falcons were seeded sixth in the MWC Tournament in Las Vegas, Nev., and were expected to lose two games in the double-elimination tournament and be the first team ousted. However, after a 17-3 loss to regular-season champion New Mexico, the Falcons shocked the tournament with upset wins over UNLV and Utah. The rest of the conference learned a valuable lesson in the city of lights. Never underestimate the Falcons! Air Force earned its first-ever win in a conference tournament as freshman Josh Phifer hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the eighth to lift the Falcons to a 13-11 win over UNLV. The next day, the Falcons knew that a victory would propel them into the championship game as Michael Tufte pitched the game of his career. Behind a gritty, complete-game performance by the junior right-hander, the Falcons defeated Utah, 10-5. One of the best catchers in AFA history, Jim Murphy provided some offensive punch as his three-run home run gave the Falcons a lead that they never relinquished.\n\nOn May 20, the Falcons' stunning run ended with a 9-4 loss to San Diego State in the championship game. Air Force took a 2-0 lead in the second inning, but the second-seeded Aztecs scored seven runs in the third inning and held on for the tournament championship. In typical Air Force fashion, the Falcons rallied in the final inning as AFA had the bases loaded when the game ended.\n\n\"I am so proud of how our guys hung together all season and how they performed in the tournament,\" Peters said. \"After we got beat in the first game, it would have been easy for our guys to pack it in but they didn't. I think we gained some respect around the league this weekend. I tip my hat to the seniors; they gave us a lot of leadership and played hard throughout the whole tournament and the entire season. This is a great building block for our young guys. They faced elimination and won twice and gave San Diego State all they wanted in the championship game.\"\n\nFour Falcons, more than any other team, were named to the all-tournament team. Tufte was one of the top vote getters with his complete-game victory over Utah. Chris Humphrey, Mike Thiessen and Gerremy Goldsberry joined him on the team. Goldsberry hit .533 and led the tournament with eight hits while Humphrey hit .467 with seven RBI in the tournament and Thiessen hit .400 with five runs scored.\n\nThiessen and Humphrey earned all-conference honors, the most Falcons honored by the league in five years. Thiessen led the conference in batting for the second straight year with a .414 average. He broke school records with a 33-game hitting streak, 91 hits, 28 doubles, 59 career doubles and 220 at-bats. The centerfielder from Modesto, Calif., became the first Falcon in 14 years and just the sixth in school history to record consecutive .400 seasons. Humphrey led the team with 10 home runs and 61 RBI, the third most in school history.\n\nOnce again, the Falcons finished in the top 20 in the nation in batting average, but it was the pitching staff that raised the most eyebrows. With the elevation and winds at Falcon Field, pitching is usually not one of the team's strong suits. However, under pitching coach Bobby Applegate, the team claimed four-conference pitcher of the week honors and posted the best team ERA in seven years. The staff also shattered the school record for most strikeouts in a season. Sophomores Erik Fisher and Matt Kaercher joined Tufte to form one of the top starting rotations in the conference. Fisher ended the season with a 5.33 ERA, the best by a starter in 11 years. He also broke a 36-year-old record with 104 innings pitched and posted the third most strikeouts in school history.\n\nAir Force's 23 wins and .403 winning percentage are the best in five years. Prior to this season, the Falcons had averaged just 16 wins per year.\n\nThe Falcons lose just five seniors from this team as Shannon, Humphrey, Murphy, Sonje Berg and Steve Jones played their final games in the blue and silver. With a young pitching staff, a host of talented young players and a solidified coaching staff with the hiring of Reed Peters, the future of Air Force baseball looks to be in good hands. With a strong finish and the most wins in five years, the Falcons proved that they are gaining ground in the Mountain West Conference.\n\nC2C Mike Thiessen earned National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) All-American third team honors. He became the first Falcon ever honored by the NCBWA and the sixth All-American in AFA history. Thiessen is the first to be selected since Glenn Harris earned third-team honors by the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) in 1995.\n\nBaseball Quick Facts:\n\nSeason Record: 23-34, 2nd MWC\n\nAll-American (NCBWA): Mike Thiessen\n\nAll-Conference Honors: Mike Thiessen and Chris Humphrey\n\nTeam Captain, Brendan Shannon\n\nMVP C1C Chris Humphrey\n\nCoach Reed Peters hired as head coach\n\nJV Record: 19-13, head coach Capt Mike Manor\n\nGolf: The men's golf team had a disappointing finish to the 1999-2000 season, placing eighth in the Mountain West Conference championships. The Falcons finished the event 76 strokes out of first place. The lone bright spot of the tournament was Ben Leestma's final round score of 68, which was the best score for the third round. Leestma was the Falcons' most consistent golfer this season, leading the Falcons in seven of 12 tournaments this season. He had three consecutive top-10 finishes, including a second-place finish at the Stevinson Ranch Invitational. Team captain Danny Visosky finished his Air Force career with a successful season. He was the team's top scorer in four tournaments, including the BYU Classic, where he tied the Falcons' 17th all-time best tournament score with a three-round total of 216.\n\nGolf Quick Facts:\n\nSeason Finish, 8th MWC\n\nTeam Captain Danny Visosky\n\nMVP Danny Visosky\n\nLacrosse: Air Force ended their 2000 lacrosse season with a 12-4 loss to Denver May 6. The Falcons season record is 2-12, 0-4 Great Western Lacrosse League. A number of key injuries helped put a stop to the Falcons quest for a winning season. C1Cs Ross Schumer and Art Patek both were lost for the season due to injury, and Matt Dudderar's injury early in the season played havoc with the Falcons' expectations. Regardless of the loss of several talented teammates, the Falcons pressed on with a solid core of players, led by Team Captain C1C Brock Miller. Miller has been a stalwart force behind the Falcons each game this season. The Falcons' first game was on the road against Lehigh University Feb. 25. Air Force scored one goal in both the third and fourth periods but it was a case of too-little, too-late to stop the attack of nine different Mountain Hawks who found the back of the goal. Lehigh took a 10-0 lead at the half and the Falcons were unable to catch up. Junior J. Agnew had one goal and one assist while senior Nick Dipoma scored once. Things weren't much better as they faced service academy-rival Army two days later. The Army Black Knights downed Air Force, 16-4, the Falcons' eighth consecutive loss against Army.\n\nDuring the game, Matt Dudderar scored two goals in the first quarter, one unassisted and one with the assistance of J. Agnew. Falcon Ed Palazzolo scored one goal in the second quarter assisted by Ryan Hayde and Eric Lederer scored another in the third quarter assisted by Carrano. Army scored six goals in the second quarter, five in the third and three in the fourth quarter to run away with the game. The Falcons returned home to take on Brown University March 5. The Bears took an early lead, scoring the first three goals of the game. At the beginning of the second period, Jimmy Mormile scored for Brown on man-down. It was three minutes into the second quarter when Dudderar, assisted by Agnew, put the Falcons on the board on a man-up goal. Eric Lederer, assisted by Carrano quickly followed with the second man-up goal for the Falcons. Brown's Richard Mormile scored again with eleven minutes left in the second period. Three minutes later, Agnew, assisted by Adam Gaudinski, scored for the Falcons.\n\nTrailing Brown by one point at the half, it looked as if the Falcons would challenge Brown for a victory. Brown racked up six unanswered goals in the third period bringing the score 10-3. The Bears lead proved to be too much for the Falcons heading into the fourth quarter. Nick Dipoma managed an unassisted goal, which was answered by Brown's Michael Monfett. Mormile scored again for Brown within the final minute of the game. Carrano scored for the Falcons in the last 30 seconds of the game, making the score 12-5, in favor of the Bears.\n\nA match up with Penn State soon followed for the Falcons March 6. Carrano scored a game-high four points on four goals, but it wasn't enough to stop the Falcons from falling to the Nittany Lions 8-15. The Lions started the game quickly, scoring two goals within the first five minutes. The Falcons posted their first goal just over one minute later with an unassisted shot from Carrano. The Lions led, 6-1, at the end of the first period. Penn State's defense went on to play well the rest of the half, only allowing, Dylan Quinn (with an assist from Agnew) to post the Falcons' only goal in the second period. Penn State continued their lead in the second half, scoring the first three goals of the third quarter. Falcon Kevin Hill and Dipoma scored unassisted goals in the third. Penn State's Will Driscoll and Luke Ogelsby answered the Falcons' scoring in the last four minutes of the third period. Carrano scored his second goal for Air Force with just a little over a minute left in the third, bringing the score to 5-13.\n\nIn the final period, Carrano set the pace, scoring his third goal in the first 14 seconds. Ted Holmes scored his second goal for Penn State three minutes later. Carrano returned to the net to post his fourth goal of the night with just over eight minutes left on the clock. Teammate Nathan Koss followed two minutes later to add to the Falcons' score. Penn State's Driscoll ended the scoring for the game when he racked up his second goal for the night. The Falcons attempted to rebound from their losses when they took on Great Western League rival, Notre Dame\n\nMarch 13. Notre Dame's Fighting Irish came out swinging as Tom Glatzel scored two goals against Air Force in the first two minutes of their match up. Chris Young assisted Glatzel on the first goal before scoring his own goal. Carrano, assisted by Agnew scored the Falcons only goal in the first period. The Falcons were hard pressed to stop Notre Dame as they dropped their fifth game 6-10, and lost their first Great Western Lacrosse League game of the season. Notre Dame held the Falcons to one goal in the second period while they posted three more. The Fighting Irish held the Falcons scoreless in the third quarter. The Falcons tried to rally back in the fourth period scoring four goals and holding Notre Dame to two. Glatzel, scoring his fifth goal of the game and Keith Parendo assisted by Todd Ulrich scored for Notre Dame. Quinn, who scored two goals, led Air Force, while Carrano, Kevin Hill, Agnew (1 assist), and Dipoma each scored once. Losses to Hofstra and service academy-rival Navy kept the Falcons down but not out on their spring break trip to the East Coast. A face-off with Virginia Military Institute April 1, finally put a checkmark in the win column for the Falcons. Ironically, the Falcons also defeated VMI last season for their first win. Against VMI, Quinn posted the game winning goal in double overtime to net the win for the Falcons 5-4. Air Force rallied from a 3-1 deficit with three goals in the final period and a score in the second overtime to defeat VMI The Falcons also outshot the Keydets 47-19 for the game and took nine of 13 face-offs. The Falcons riding high on their VMI win, continued their streak by beating Manhattan College 12-8 in their first home win. Air Force outshot Manhattan 35-31 and held a 36-32 advantage in the ground ball department while Manhattan won 13-of-18 face-offs. Air Force also took full advantage of extra man opportunities scoring 100 percent. Air Force scored 12 goals by seven players, including two each by five players.\n\nDipoma posted the first goal of the game after nine minutes of play, followed by Manhattan's Ken Rose less than a minute later. Nathan Koss soon followed to give control of the game to the Falcons at the end of the first period. Two unanswered goals by Lederer and Demanss gave the Falcons a 4-1 lead, the first time the Falcons have held a three-goal lead over their opponents all season. Manhattan's Matt Daniels managed to post a goal for the Jaspers with three minutes and fifty seconds left on the clock. Falcon, Agnew scored his first goal with just 40 seconds left in the first half to give Air Force a 5-2 lead over Manhattan. Third-quarter goals by Demanss, Lederer, Dipoma and Quinn helped the Falcons cement their lead over the Jaspers. Kevin Hill opened the fourth period with a goal for the Falcons. Manhattan's Mike Gilson attempted to rally back, scoring two goals within two minutes for his team. Don Femminella found the net for Manhattan less than a minute later, to close the gap to 10-7.\n\nQuinn's second goal of the game provided an 11-7 cushion before Manhattan's Brian Crimmins scored the Jaspers' final goal. Agnew tossed in the game's final goal with less than 20 seconds left on the clock. After defeating Manhattan, Air Force would suffer four losses against Radford University (4-14) conference-rivals Butler University (6-12)and Ohio State (17-6) and Villanova (18-4) before gearing up for Denver in their season finale. Against Denver, Eric Lederer, assisted by J. Agnew, put Air Force on the scoreboard first with a goal with 3:34 left in the first period. Denver's Geoff Bieging scored at 3:03 to tie the game 1-1 at the end of the first period. Bieging gave the Pioneers a 4-1 advantage in the second period scoring three times in the first seven minutes of play. Teammate Mike Petrucci posted another goal for Denver to take the lead 5-1. Back-to-back goals by Nathan Koss, (assisted by J. Agnew and Kyle Warf) put the Falcons within two at the end of the second period. In the third period, Denver increased their lead to six after holding Air Force scoreless as Travis Taylor, Mike Kenlay, Winslow Lewis and McAdory Lipscomb found the back of the net. In the fourth period, Denver's Mike Law, Lewis and Adam Stifel scored before Kyle Warf was able to break the Falcon's drought with just over one minute left on the clock. Although the win column may not show it, there have been many improvements and highlights during the season. Next year's senior class has definitely left their mark this season. Falcon second-classmen contributed significantly to the offense, having scored 29 of the team's 68 goals. The senior class chalked up 23 goals for the team. Dipoma, who graduates with the class of 2000, leads the Falcons in scoring this season, posting 14 goals for the team. These 14 goals added to his previous year's totals gives him 20 goals and two assists for a total of 22 career points. Junior player, Agnew currently leads the team in points (24). His 16 assists and eight goals give him a team-high 32 career points. Not to be outdone are the members of the freshman class. Falcon rookies have posted 30 of the 106 total points on the season. Newcomer Billy Arnold staked his claim to the goalie position and with the valuable experience he has gained this season, he has the potential to be even better next season.\n\nSo far this season, he's spent nearly 12 hours between the pipes and has 162 saves. His save percent is .494 and he has already earned a position on the Academy top-10 list for greatest number of saves during a season. Although the team will lose seven senior class members with the 2000 graduating class, the future still looks good for the Air Force lacrosse team. Experience of returnees, a strong recruiting season and lesson's learned from this season will all factor into making next season a successful one for the Falcons.\n\nLacrosse Quick Facts:\n\nRecord: 2-12, 0-4 GWLL\n\nMVP'C1C Charles Brock Miller\n\nPace Weber Award - Chris Munger\n\nTeam Captain, Brock Miller\n\nAll-Great Western Lacrosse League Team: Charles Brock Miller\n\nMen's Tennis: The men's tennis team concluded the season with a very deceiving 18-9 overall record. The record marks the first time in 24 years that AFA didn't reach the 20-win plateau, but that didn't dampen coach Rich Gugat's outlook. Despite several injuries throughout the season to several key players, including No. 1 singles and doubles ace Tom DeAngelis, the team still had a successful campaign. Despite an injured knee, DeAngelis posted a 9-6 singles mark to earn all-Mountain West Conference honors. He teamed with Nolan Cooper at No. 1 doubles to post a 13-2 mark and earn all-MWC honors. Cooper had a successful year as well, leading the team with a 19-7 overall singles record. Cooper ended his career ranked third all-time at the Academy with a .819 winning percentage. He also ranks fourth in career wins with a 91-20 mark. The Falcons were a perfect 17-0 at home this year and will enter next year with a 23-match home court-winning streak. AFA is 185-11 at home since 1990. Gugat also reached another milestone in 2000, winning his 600th career match. He ranks fifth among active Division I head coaches with a 610-161-career record.\n\nMen's Tennis Quick Facts:\n\nWomen's Tennis: The Air Force women's tennis team completed another successful season under head coach Kim Gidley.\n\nTwo of the season highlights include reclaiming the Gideon Cup from Army and upsetting Utah in the Mountain West Conference tournament.\n\nThe women's tennis equivalent of the Commander-in-Chief's trophy is back in the hands of the Air Force women's tennis team thanks to strong singles play by the Falcons. Air Force defeated service academy rival Army 7-2 at the Cadet Indoor Tennis Courts to bring the Gideon Cup home after a one-year trip to the Hudson Valley.\n\nThe Lt. Gen. F.C. Gideon Cup is awarded annually to the winner of the Air Force- Army match in the fall. The trophy is dedicated to preserving the good will and competitive spirit between the two academies. It is named after Gideon, who graduated from West Point in 1940 and after being commissioned in the infantry in 1941, later became an officer in the Army Air Corp.\n\nWinning the Gideon Cup is one of the Falcons top goals each season and Gidley was happy to have the cup back after turning it over to the Cadets of West Point last season.\n\n\"We're very excited to win the cup back,\" Gidley said. \"This means a lot to the players and fans. We had a lot of support from our fans today and I think that gave us an edge.\"\n\nAfter an exciting run through the early part of the spring season, which saw the team eight of ten matches, the team dropped five of six to enter the MWC tournament in Las Vegas.\n\nTop-seeded San Diego State, 6-0, defeated eighth-seeded Air Force Thursday afternoon in the opening round of the MWC Women's Tennis Championships. The Aztecs won four of the six matches in straight sets to advance to the second round.\n\nA great team effort helped Air Force cruise past Utah 5-2 in the consolation round during the Mountain West Conference Women's Tennis Championships.\n\nPlaying through wind gusts that reached more than 40 miles per hour, Air Force downed Utah for the first upset at the championships. The second-round match lasted longer than four hours even though only one of three doubles matches was completed.\n\nThe Falcons won two three-set matches in singles play to earn a 4-2 lead. Winning for Air Force were Brooke Parsons at No. 2, Nadine Lynn at No. 3, Julie Weiss at No. 4 and Kelli O'Bryant at No. 6.\n\nIn doubles play, Weiss and O'Bryant teamed up at No. 1 to defeat Megan Payne-Domy and Cassie Kasteler, 8-5, to clinch the victory. The two other doubles matches were halted.\n\nThe Air Force tennis team lost a thrilling tiebreaker doubles match and fell to Colorado State, 5-4, in the fifth-place match at the Mountain West Conference women's tennis championships on April 29 in Las Vegas, Nev.\n\nThe teams played a marathon match that lasted nearly five hours. After splitting the six singles matches, eighth-seeded Air Force won at No. 2 doubles behind the play of Parsons and Heather Shelby. Sixth-seeded Colorado State then won at No. 1 doubles, 8-6, to tie the match. The Rams won at No. 3 doubles, 9-8 (5) to win the match, 5-4.\n\nAFA earned three singles wins as Lynn (No. 3) and Ashley Gee (No. 5) won in straight sets and Kristel Chuntraruk won a three-set match at No. 1.\n\nWomen's Tennis Quick Facts:\n\nMen's & Women's Outdoor Track: The outdoor track teams The 2000 outdoor season began on a high note for the Falcons with 14 cadet-athletes taking the number one, two and three spots at the Lobo Invitational in March. The Falcons' Tony Jones earned the No. 1 spot in both the long and triple jumps. Jones also earned conference athlete of the week (March 20). In the hammer, Dan Macsay broke his old record with a throw of 180'7 to place second. In April, the team traveled to Florida to compete in the Florida Relays. Tony Jones was the only first-place finisher for the Falcons in the meet. In the triple jump, Jones jumped 48'6 3/4\" to beat Georgia Tech's Chris Crawley. Brian Willlis broke into the Academy's top 10 all-time list in the javelin with a throw of 179'2\". Also breaking in to the all-time list was Domonique Torbert in the women's triple jump (35'3 3/4\"). The women's 4x1600-meter relay team took second in a time of 19:08.29, setting a new school record in the event.\n\nCompeting in a quadrangular versus Florida State, Kansas State and South Florida, the men's team went 2-1 while the women finished 0-3. Kevin Griswold captured two (200 and 400m dash) first-place finishes, which propelled the men's team to their second-place finish. \"This was an outstanding early season performance by Kevin,\" said coach Ralph Lindeman. In addition to Griswold, the Falcons had four other first-place finishes and four second-place finishes. Griswold also earned MWC Athlete of the Week. Joe Bonner won the javelin with a throw of 205'4 and Dan Macsay had a career best throw of 182'10 in the hammer throw. Macsay's throw ranked him fourth on the school's all-time list. Brian Carpenter (1500-meters), Matt Puckett (110m hurdles), Shane Rogers (steeplechase) and Shawn Johnson (shot put) all finished in second place in their events. Rachel Smith (3000-meters and 1500-meters) was the Falcons' top female performer. Smith finished second in the 3K and third in the 1,500m. Following the spring break trip to Florida, the Falcons traveled to the University of Oregon to compete in the Hayward Relays. Both Griswold and Jones were the top Air Force performers. Griswold finished second in the men's 200-meters. Jones also finished second in the triple jump in the non-team scoring meet. In a split team move, the Falcons sent athletes to compete in the Colorado College Invitational. The men's teams finished in first, while the women's team placed fourth.\n\nOn April 22, the Falcons went up against service academy rival Army. The Falcons' men's team dominated the Knights on the field, winning seven of eight field events. In the men's jumping events, the Falcons took first and second in all four events. The biggest surprise for the Falcons came in the men's long jump when Doug Alfar captured first with a leap of 22'9 1/2\" on his last jump. Teammate David Klein won the high jump with a jump of 6'2 3/4\". On the women's side, the Falcons dominated in the distance races.

Four sprinters made the best of their trip to Philadelphia in April. The team of Paul Mayo, Matt Puckett, Marc Fulson and Kevin Griswold won the event with a clocking of 41.98. Following the Penn Relays, the Falcons were host to a dual versus Colorado State in May. The highlight of the meet was Griswold's school record setting time of 21.00 in the men's 200-meter dash. Griswold's exceptional run broke his own school record of 21.03 (1999). His finish helped to put the Falcons over the top to win the meet, 99-81. In the women's division, Katy Crow, a Doherty High School graduate, won the 400m with a time of 58.04. The Air Force women went into the final race of the day trailing by two points. A win in the 4x400-meter relay would have earned the Falcons five points to CSU's three to tie at 91. However, the Rams easily won the race by almost ten seconds to dash the Falcons' hopes of the tie.\n\nDuring that same weekend, the Falcons split the teams to send runners to the Stanford Invitational in Palo Alto, Calif. Shane Rogers posted an NCAA qualifying time of 8:46.73 in the 3,000m steeplechase. Joe Lopez finished second in the 1,500m with a personal best of 3:47.17. Rachel Smith posted a time of 17:01.45 to rank her second on the Falcons all-time list.\n\nThe season finale came at the inaugural Mountain West Conference Outdoor Track & Field Championships in Provo, Utah. Brigham Young recorded 286.50 points over the four-day competition. Air Force finished in second place with 152 points, marking the highest-ever finish for the Academy in both outdoor and indoor league championship competition.

His time ranks second in AFA history. His third-place finish in the 200-meters (20.96) set a new school record. Jake Gensic recorded a personal-best mark of 17 feet, 3/4 inches in the pole vault, the third best height in AFA history, to finish second. Lopez (3:49.90) and Carpenter (3:50.44) finished third and fourth, respectively, in the 1,500-meters. In the javelin, Bonner took first with a throw of 193'8\". Bonner suffered an knee injury two weeks prior to the championships.\n\nIn the women's competition, the Falcons finished with 22 points, finishing eighth in the conference. Their score was the most points ever scored in the conference in AFA women's track history. The Cougar women won their 18th straight league title with a convincing 236 point-total. Second place went to UNLV with 129 followed by Wyoming (121.50), Colorado State (108.50), San Diego State (80), New Mexico (71), Utah (50) and Air Force (22).\n\n\"It was a roller coaster day for us,\" said head coach Ralph Lindeman. \"We lost some points in events that I figured we would score better in and picked up points in other events that I hadn't counted on.\n\n\"I just can't say enough about the competitive spirit our men's and women's team showed today. I think they drew a little of their inspiration from what the baseball team was doing by playing the underdog roll in the championship game in Las Vegas.\"\n\nThe women's 22 points betters the 15 points they scored in the indoor championship.
