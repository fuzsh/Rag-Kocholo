First pitch for this game is at 1 p.m. MT and the winner faces San Diego State at 5 p.m. MT\n\nIf the Aztecs win then the tournament is over, but if San Diego State stumbles there is a winner-take-all game Sunday at 1 p.m. MT\n\nHang out and watch the games with us.\n\nNo. 2 SDSU vs. No. 3 Fresno State winner (5 p.m. MT)"
