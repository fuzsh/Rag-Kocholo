        "text": "May 19, 2000\n\nBox Score\n\nLas Vegas, Nev - No. 6 San Diego State used a six-run fifth inning to help eliminate BYU, 11-7, and secured itself a berth in the championship game of the Inaugural Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament at Earl E. Wilson Stadium on Friday.\n\nThe Aztecs (33-28) raced to a 3-0 lead after two BYU errors in the first four innings, but the Cougars rallied back to tie the game at 3-3 in the top of the fifth when designated hitter Matt Davies hit a 3-run single that hit off the pitcher and trickled into center field.\n\nSan Diego State took the lead for good after a six-run fifth inning extended the lead to 9-3. The Aztecs used another BYU error, had two hit batsman and three hits to spark the six-run stretch. BYU (29-29) rallied again in the top of the ninth after a 2-run RBI by Matt Davies pulled the Cougars within four, 11-7. SDSU reliever Chris Dunwell entered the game for starter Chris Hartshorn with one out in the ninth and shut down BYU, striking out the final two batters of the game.\n\nHartshorn improved his season record to 7-4 after pitching 8.1 innings, allowing four earned runs on nine hits, while striking out four. Noorda finished the year at 2-4 for the Cougars.\n\nSan Diego State will play No. 6 Air Force on Saturday at 3:00 p.m. on Saturday and will have to win one game to capture its fourth-ever conference title in baseball. The Falcons will have to take two from the Aztecs to capture the crown."
