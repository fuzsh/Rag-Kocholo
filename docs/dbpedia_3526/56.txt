Overview

Released on March 6, 2007, Burnout: Dominator was released in between Burnout Revenge and Burnout Paradise, and serves as a stopgap release that compiles some content and ideas from the previous Burnout games and compiles it into a new release. Developed by EA's UK branch, this is one of the very few installments that have been developed outside of Criterion Games, the series' originator.

Players compete in a World Tour divided into seven series based on different car classes, Classic, Factory, Tuned, Hot Rod, Super, Race Specials, and Dominator. From here you can race in several different challenges such as the Classic Race, Road Rage, Eliminator, Maniac Mode (driving very dangerously at oncoming traffic, doing jumps and getting near misses, all for more points), Drift Challenge, Near Miss Challenge, and others.

Locations in Burnout Dominator include Europe, the Far East, the USA as well as South America and Eastern Europe (both exclusive to the PSP version).

Compared to its predecessor in the franchise, Burnout Revenge, Dominator has some significant differences. First of all, the ability to traffic check same way traffic isn't present, but burnouts (the ability to chain together the boost meter for non-stop turbo speed) are back in. Also, there is no crash mode.

Vehicles

Burnout Dominator has about 36 cars (each Series from Classic, Factory, Tuner, Hotrod, Super, and Race has 5 cars each, the Dominator class has about 1 car from each Series) and most of the cars are based on real life vehicles. The game has the second highest amount of returning vehicles including the Custom Coupe Ultimate from Burnout 2, the Euro Circuit Racer from Burnout 3 and the Low Rider from Burnout Revenge.
