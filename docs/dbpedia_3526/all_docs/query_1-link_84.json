The game looks to be the most challenging so far, with the new Maniac mode. Nick Channon from EA explains the new feature: \"Maniac mode is all about pushing your dangerous driving skills to the limit. The user earns points for driving into oncoming traffic, doing drifts, near misses etc, and the goal is to score as many points as you can, and thus drive as dangerously as you can. The big kicker in the mode is Burnouts - by chaining Burnouts you earn score multipliers which in turn give you massive scores, which you will need in the later levels of the game.\"Check out the full interview at IGN. The game speeds onto PSP this March.",
