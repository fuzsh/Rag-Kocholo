        "text": "Overview\n\nReleased on March 6, 2007, Burnout: Dominator was released in between Burnout Revenge and Burnout Paradise, and serves as a stopgap release that compiles some content and ideas from the previous Burnout games and compiles it into a new release. Developed by EA's UK branch, this is one of the very few installments that have been developed outside of Criterion Games, the series' originator.\n\nPlayers compete in a World Tour divided into seven series based on different car classes, Classic, Factory, Tuned, Hot Rod, Super, Race Specials, and Dominator. From here you can race in several different challenges such as the Classic Race, Road Rage, Eliminator, Maniac Mode (driving very dangerously at oncoming traffic, doing jumps and getting near misses, all for more points), Drift Challenge, Near Miss Challenge, and others.\n\nLocations in Burnout Dominator include Europe, the Far East, the USA as well as South America and Eastern Europe (both exclusive to the PSP version).\n\nCompared to its predecessor in the franchise, Burnout Revenge, Dominator has some significant differences. First of all, the ability to traffic check same way traffic isn't present, but burnouts (the ability to chain together the boost meter for non-stop turbo speed) are back in. Also, there is no crash mode.\n\nVehicles\n\nBurnout Dominator has about 36 cars (each Series from Classic, Factory, Tuner, Hotrod, Super, and Race has 5 cars each, the Dominator class has about 1 car from each Series) and most of the cars are based on real life vehicles. The game has the second highest amount of returning vehicles including the Custom Coupe Ultimate from Burnout 2, the Euro Circuit Racer from Burnout 3 and the Low Rider from Burnout Revenge.\n\nClassic Series\n\nDrift Classic\n\nClassic Muscle\n\nAmerican Classic\n\nEuro Classic\n\nBurnout Classic\n\nFactory Series\n\nFactory Sports\n\nLimited ST\n\nJ Coupe\n\nFactory Muscle\n\nAmerican Drifter\n\nTuner Series\n\nWorks M-Type (Burnout Dominator)\n\nTuned Sports (Burnout Dominator)\n\nCustom Coupe Ultimate (Burnout Dominator)\n\nTuned Muscle (Burnout Dominator)\n\nTuned Drifter\n\nHotrod Series\n\nBlue Lightning\n\nStreet Dodger\n\nAssassin\n\nCustom Hot Rod\n\nStreet Rod\n\nSuper Series\n\nRoyal X3\n\nWorks GT\n\nAmerican Super\n\nSuper Muscle\n\nEuro Super\n\nRace Specials Series\n\nOval Racer (Burnout Dominator)\n\nWorld Circuit Racer (Burnout Dominator)\n\nEuro Circuit Racer (Burnout Dominator)\n\nEuro Classic LM (Burnout Dominator)\n\nUS Circuit Racer (Burnout Dominator)\n\nDominator Class\n\nLow Rider (Burnout Dominator)\n\nFactory GT (Burnout Dominator)\n\nSuper Coupe\n\nCharger\n\nSuper Prototype (Burnout Dominator)\n\nGT Racer\n\nEvents\n\nMost common events in Dominator but all together there 11 events.\n\nRace - Race around the track against rivals to the Finish Line.\n\nRoad Rage - Takedown as much of opponents as fast as possible under a limited amount of time.\n\nEliminator - The driver who in last place has 30 seconds to escape being last or else their eliminated from the race\n\nBurning Lap - Single lap Time Trail\n\nManiac Mode - Perform dangerous stunts along a track to earn as many points.\n\nDrift Challenge - Drift around corners to add points to your score.\n\nNear Miss Challenge - Earn as many Near Misses by dodging traffic cars as possible before times runs out.\n\nBurnout Challenge - Perform as many Burnouts Chain as possible before the times run out or passing the finish line.\n\nLocations\n\nAll race tracks in Burnout Dominator.\n\nTuscany (Europe) : Tuscan Hills & Tuscan View - Florence/Aria/Tuscany\n\nAutobahn (Europe) : Autobahn & Autobahn Loop - Wuppertal/Berlin/Frankfurt\n\nBushido Mountain (Far East) : Bushido Peak & Bushido Valley - Osaka/Kyoto/Himeji\n\nSpiritual City (Far East) : Spiritual Gate & Spiritual Towers - Kuala Lumpur\n\nOcean Drive (USA) : Ocean Drive - Carmel/ Monterey/Big Sur\n\nSteel Town (USA) : Steel Town Works - Pittsburgh\n\nGlacier Falls (USA) : Glacier Falls - Rocky Mountain National Park/Boulder, Colorado\n\nBlack Gold (USA) : Black Gold Highway - Houston\n\nPSP\n\nWith it's built in wifi capabilities, this allowed EA to put out two downloadable tracks exclusive to the PSP version of the game.
