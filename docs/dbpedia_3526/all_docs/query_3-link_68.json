        "text": "I’ve wanted to write this article for a while now. It mixes one of my favorite genres in gaming with my favorite handheld period (come at me vita boys). The best part is that, when it comes to racing games, the PSP had a great representation. I can say without a doubt that I’d wholeheartedly recommend any of these ten games I picked. If anything, there’s even more games I could recommend from the PSP catalog but the rules are for the list to have ten spots and only one game per franchise.\n\nSo these are the ones that I chose personally. Don’t be too mad if my tastes turn out too different from yours and your favorite game didn’t make the list!\n\n10. Colin McRae Rally 2005 plus – When I bought my first PSP back in 2005, this was one of the games I got with it. The graphics were a stand-out for me as it was my first venture into this “new gen” handheld but, now that time has passed and this game is actually “retro”, the game still stands as a great one. Great tracks, handling, presentation… It’s the whole package.\n\n9. SEGA Rally – Next on the list is what I think is the most personal of my picks. This game flew under the radar of most gamers and that’s such a shame. This portable conversion of this arcade off road racer is pretty much uncompromised in terms of content and features a handling that, dare I say, felt better than the home console one.\n\n8. Initial D Street Stage – I had my reservations on including this title being this a Japanese exclusive but… I just love this game too much. White-knuckling one on one racing on the windiest roads Japan has to offer at the wheel of the best JDM rides. Also, you can’t overlook the awesome eurobeat soundtrack that will accompany it all.\n\n7. OutRun 2006 Coast 2 Coast – Flying across the highway on a convertible Ferrari, drifting along the coastline surpassing every car… This game is pure arcade heaven and you could play it on the go back in 2006? Amazing.\n\n6. MotorStorm Arctic Edge – I’ll admit that this wouldn’t be my pick as my favorite MotorStorm game but, even then, Arctic Edge rocks. Multiple vehicle types going head to head in these extreme Off-road locales fighting mud, rocks and heavy blizzards. It adds new vehicles such as the snowmobiles and it features a great amount of all-new mountain themed tracks. This game is big and it’s intense.\n\n5. Gran Turismo – This game may have got flak as, for a game of this name, it doesn’t really deliver a typical Gran Turismo experience. That being said, as a racing game, this title is nothing but great. Great graphics, great selection of both cars and tracks, great driving physics… Nobody should miss out on this one.\n\n4. FlatOut Head On – What they released under this title is basically a straight port of FlatOut 2 but portable. What may have been seen as a lazy move back in the day, it’s actually great news because FO2 is one of the best arcade racers of all time. Speed, destruction and drivers flying out of their windows. This game is just so much fun.\n\n3. Burnout Legends – I already made a “retro briefiew” on this title so the reasons why I included Burnout in this list is all clear. The fast and aggressive racing, the multitude of modes… The only question remaining is why would I pick this one instead of Dominator, right? Well, because Avril Lavigne’s “boyfriend” isn’t part of its soundtrack, that’s why.\n\n2. Ridge Racer 2 – It really saddens me that the Ridge Racer series may be dead for good but, on the bright side, writing this article brought me the chance to play this again and so can you! Both the first and this RR2 play great on PSP with super sharp visuals and the smooth 60fps gameplay. There’s also a ton of content (although not much of it is new) so this, unlike the vita one, is a great RR experience to have on the go.\n\n1. Wipeout Pulse – Not gonna lie, choosing this game over the last few titles on the list is just based on my own subjective liking towards the Wipeout franchise. All the games ran well, had nice graphics and soundtracks, fun racing gameplay and plenty of content in terms of tracks and vehicles but… So does this!\n\nRunner ups: Midnight Club LA Remix, TOCA Race Driver 2, ATV Offroad Fury Pro, M.A.C.H., SBK 09\n\nSo this will be all for today’s top 10. Like I mentioned, no matter which position each game fell into the list, as a racing game enthusiast, I consider them all must have titles in PSP’s catalog.\n\nWhat do you think of the list? Would have you included any different ones? Tell me in the comments and have a good day!"
