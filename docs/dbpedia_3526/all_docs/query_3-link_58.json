        "text": "One of the most popular non-portable game consoles made. Released with two major different models: the larger original and the much smaller “thin” version. If you know someone that only owns one recent-ish console, this is probably it. Its popularity meant tons of games were released for it, from shovelware to hidden gems. Also had good backwards compatibility with PS1 software.\n\nModding the PS2 is usually done via a hard drive mod, or a fliptop. (Someone with PS2 modding knowledge should fill this in more.) You can get a memory card loaded with Free McBoot off eBay for around 10 USD, which lets you play all the “backups” you want."
