        "text": "Electronic Arts has confirmed that Burnout Dominator, expected to be the swansong for the series as far as PlayStation 2 is concerned, is also coming to PSP.\n\nThere's very little information at the moment (and the PS2 screenshot we're showing here has the air of a mock-up), but it sounds as if it'll be business as usual â€“ which means like some brutal reality TV Top Gear of the future, speed and collisions are the main aim of the game.\n\nAt the centre of Burnout Dominator will be the World Tour events, where you'll face off against other rivals to see whose aggressive driving techniques best cut the mustard, or more precisely cut up your opponents. As usual, performing death-defying 'burnouts' will press home your advantage as well as boosting your score.\n\nEA seems to be positioning the game as the culmination of all previous titles, rather than as a new departure. The original Burnout shook up the staid racing genre, but like many shocking newcomers (Ben Elton, Oasis, Pete Doherty) the brand seems to have run out of ideas as it's become part of the establishment.\n\nPerhaps Nick Channon, senior producer, was busy thinking up something new when he was interrupted to comment: \"Burnout Dominator focuses on the reckless skill-based racing and fear of crashing that fuelled the first games.\"\n\nStill, we loved the last PSP title, Burnout Legends, so more of the same with a few neat twists wouldn't be wholly unwelcome, even if the PSP is already blessed with a pile-up of great racing games.\n\nBurnout Dominator is due for release in 2007.
