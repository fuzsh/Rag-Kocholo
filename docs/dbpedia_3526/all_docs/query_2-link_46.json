If your product has a defect, your board game is missing a part when you opened it, or any other various issues, please reach out with your receipt right away so we can evaluate the situation and make it right by getting you the missing part, repairing your disc/console or any of the other various ways we can implement to take care of your purchase. Some things will require that you reach out to the original manufacturer as that is how those manufacturer's prefer to deal with replacements for defects.\n\nWe have a lifetime clean guarantee on all discs purchased from us. As long as you bring in the receipt, we will professionally clean your disc for you for life. This typically keeps your discs running without issue. Extremely bad scratches or cracks or other various things other than 'normal' scratches are unable to be fixed with this policy. For online orders, if you cannot bring the disc to a location to get cleaned, you do have the option, after approval, to send the disc to us to get cleaned. We will charge a shipping fee in these cases to cover extra shipping costs.\n\nFor all collectible products, we offer no refunds or returns. This includes all sealed collectible products as well. Please make informed decisions upon purchasing collectible products such as trading cards, comics and similar.\n\nFor Pre-Played Video Game Consoles, we offer a 30 day warranty for any defects. Bring it back to the store and we will either repair or replace it for you. There are no refunds on pre-played video game systems. For new consoles, all warranty is through the original manufacturer and you must contact them. We are happy to provide contact info as needed.\n\nFor Pre-Played Video Games, we offer the lifetime clean guarantee and if the game doesn't work due to a defect within 14 days after your purchase and we cannot repair it or replace it with the same disc, we will offer an exchange to another game in the store or credit back on a gift card. After 14 days, we offer no refunds or exchanges but we always have the lifetime clean guarantee with your receipt.\n\nFor items in the store, once it is opened, we are unable to process refunds for it. Depending on the situation, we are happy to evaluate and offer solutions if we can including possible exchanges due to mistakes.\n\nFor all online orders, to do a refund or exchange, you must get authorization through email before sending the items back to us. Upon getting authorization, you are responsible for the shipping costs to get the item back to us.
