        "text": "The Video Game Survival Guide to The End of the World\n\n[David Jagneaux] If the Mayans are correct, the world will (or did, depending on when or if you read this) on December 21st, 2012. While we have survived many doomsday scares in the past and there really isn’t proof that anything is going to happen, the saying always goes: better safe than sorry. Which brings us to the most important question: If the world does end, how will it happen? As a society, we have fantasized over apocalyptic events for so long and developed so many theories, who even knows what could possibly happen?\n\nI have constructed this survival guide for all gamers to refer back to. Even if the Mayans are wrong and we live on for X more years, the end of the world will probably happen one day. Consider this our definitive source of information to survive a world-ending catastrophe – as a gamer. Each possible world-ending event (that I could reasonably think of) has been detailed along with a game or two you should play to prepare and one you should not play to prepare. Obviously there will be plenty of games I didn’t include, in which case, I encourage you to comment down below. It’s your duty, as a citizen of this world, to help us all out. Get out your journals class, it’s time to take notes!"
