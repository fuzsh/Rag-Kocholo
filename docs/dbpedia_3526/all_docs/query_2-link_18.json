        "text": "To do:\n\nMost of the strings on the PS2 page also apply to this version. Maybe some better way of merging the pages is needed, although the unused graphics are entirely different between each platform.\n\nBurnout Dominator is the last game in the series to be released on the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. It is, in some ways, a \"best of\" of the series, bringing back a few elements of the series that hadn't been seen for a while, like a scaled-down version of Burnout Legends. One of these elements is Boost Chaining from the first two games. Crash mode, however, was removed, which didn't exactly please long-time fans of the series. However, unlike the PS2 version, the PSP version features Ad Hoc multiplayer, which is essentially the only way to play this game online.\n\nDebug Cheat Screen\n\nTo do:\n\nReplace with screenshots and proper documentation.\n\nIn the code, the menu (or as the game calls it, Arena) C_Dummy.Arena exists. When replacing a menu string with C_Dummy, you will get a Cheat Menu screen. It is buggy, however, and doesn't do much. It is unknown what the testing purpose of this was, might have been used to test the end race menus.\n\nUnused Tracks\n\nSteeltown\n\nThere are two unused variants of the track named Steeltown, an earlier and much longer variant of the used Steeltown Works track. In some ways less polished compared to what's left of this track in the PS2 version.\n\nInternally named RK_21_V1 (Philadelphia – Long Forwards)\n\nInternally named RK_21_V2 (Philadelphia – Long Reverse)\n\nUnused Gamemodes\n\nOncoming Challenge\n\nOn top of Burnout Challenge, Drift Challenge, Near Miss Challenge, or Dominator Challenge (Maniac) events you can get throughout the World Tour, there is also an unused Oncoming Challenge event as well.\n\nThis gamemode can be loaded by using this code, which should work on all known retail releases. It replaces the 2nd event (Drift Challenge) in the Classic Series that takes place in Bushido Peak with Oncoming Challenge.\n\n_C0 Oncoming Challenge (2nd event) _L 0x0086DC54 0x0000000B\n\nUnused Vehicle Colors\n\nMost vehicles have 8 palettes, despite only the first 6 being available to cycle through, and only 3 of them being unique. For additional information and screenshots, see the PlayStation 2 page. This section provides patches to allow cycling through all 8 slots.\n\n_C0 Remove Color Cycling Restrictions ULAS-42095, ULKS-46136 ULES-00703, ULES-00750 _L 0x2026B05C 0x00000000\n\n_L 0x0027FC3C 0x00000008\n\n_L 0x0027FC40 0x00000009 _L 0x2026AE2C 0x00000000\n\n_L 0x0027F954 0x00000008\n\n_L 0x0027F958 0x00000009 ULJM-05242 ULUS-10236 _L 0x2026B0B8 0x00000000\n\n_L 0x0027FC94 0x00000008\n\n_L 0x0027FC98 0x00000009 _L 0x2026AE24 0x00000000\n\n_L 0x0027F94C 0x00000008\n\n_L 0x0027F950 0x00000009\n\n(Codes: Edness)\n\nUnused Graphics\n\nBurnout Legends Leftovers\n\nSome containers such as Frontend.txd, DemoScrn.txd and LoadScrn.bin in Dominator files are fully identical to the ones found in Legends. Some of them are shown below as an example.\n\nDemo Leftovers\n\nThere are several leftovers of a planned demo build for Dominator which never came to be.\n\nEarly Logo\n\nThe only remnants of the early logo is present in the XMB icon, which is most likely a leftover oversight, as the save icons use the same logo as in-game.\n\nDemo_PressStart.arena\\Burnout_Logo_Large_01; 02; 03.png\n\nDEMO_MainMenu.arena\\8.msh\n\nLoading Screen\n\nLoading_Image01; 02.png, present in DEMO_Loading_Maniac.arena, DEMO_Loading_Race.arena, DEMO_Sell_End.arena, DEMO_Sell_Info.arena, and WT_Rival_Loading.arena.\n\nEarly Track Icons\n\nDD_Rewards_Shortcuts.arena has early variants of all the track icons, which are real life photos taken of their respective locations. Their used counterparts are stored in WT_EventSelect.arena.\n\nEarly Final Early Final Tuscany (RK_01) Autobahn (RK_03) Bushido Mountain (RK_07) Red Gate (RK_09) Spiritual City (RK_11) Carnival Point (RK_13) Ocean Drive (RK_15) Steel Town (RK_21) Glacier Falls (RK_25) Black Gold (RK_27)\n\nBHQ_Content.arena has proper icons for Red Gate and Carnival Point, yet these also go unused. It should be noted that Carnival Point is named Carnival City here, and its icon matches the loading screen texture.\n\nCarnival_City.png\n\nCarnival_City_BW.png\n\nRed_Gate.png\n\nRed_Gate_BW.png"
