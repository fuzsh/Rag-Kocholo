        "text": "If you've never played Criterion's first two Burnout titles, Dominator may come as a shock. While Burnout 3 and Revenge focused on crashes and over-the-top action, Burnout Dominator returns to the days when racing was king and crashing was actually a bad thing. Sure, there are takedowns, but they're not nearly as important as they are in the other titles. In fact, crash mode is gone altogether. You'll also notice that no online play is available. This is an odd beast: a Burnout game that focuses on long stretches of road, careful use of your boost, and a return to the fundamentals of racing. Is that a good thing? It really depends on your tastes, but in Dominator it seems like you're giving up much of what made the series great in order for Criterion to explore some of the classical elements of the series in the current market.\n\nIt's not a bad-looking game, but don't expect much of a jump from Revenge. The next Burnout game may be built from the ground up for next-gen consoles—this game uses the work already done on the PS2 to good use. The tracks are varied and have some great jumps and turns in them. It's much easier to go fast in Dominator, and while crashing felt like part of the cost of doing business in Burnout Revenge, now it feels like you've done something wrong if you smash into something else. Traffic checks—it should be obvious—are a no-go this time.\n\nThe real fun is to load up your boost meter, run it all the way down while drifting and swerving in and out of traffic to build it up again, and linking your burnouts to get some major point multipliers. This, again, only works if you lay it all on the line and race without crashing. It's hard as well, but you'll feel great if you're able to pull it off.\n\nThe new emphasis on precision and speed is shown off to good affect in Maniac mode. In this new mode, you get points for driving on the wrong side of the road, drifting around turns, and narrowly escaping collisions with other cars. While it appears as if you're driving like a... well... maniac, unless you're in complete control of your car, the gold medals will be out of your reach. Drifting races are the same way—you get points for screeching around corners, but the points are given for careful driving and long drifts. The game remains firmly on the arcade side of things, but you'll really need to understand what each car can do to push the edge as far as you can while still staying in one piece. It takes some time to get used to this approach after the crazy amount of mayhem in later games, but it makes a solid change and is a reminder of just how good Burnout 2 was.\n\nBurnout Dominator is a throwback to the older Burnout titles, and with Burnout 5 coming to next-gen consoles, this feels like a fun experiment more than a full entry into the series. This is especially evident without the online and crash modes. This is all well and good, but the $40 price tag feels a little steep to me. $30 or less may have changed our final verdict for the game. Right now though, this will be a fun way to waste a few hours, and a nice reminder that the way out of a bad situation isn't always an explosion.\n\nVerdict: Rent\n\nPrice: $40\n\nSystem: PS2 (also available on PSP)\n\nDeveloped and Published by: Electronic Arts\n\nESRB Rating: E10\n\nOther recent minireviews:"
