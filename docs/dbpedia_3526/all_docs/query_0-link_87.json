        "text": "About\n\nBurnout is a racing game series by developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts (EA), previously published by Acclaim Entertainment . The series dives itself deeply into the high-speed and crashing aspects of the racing genre, with iconic gameplay features such as causing other vehicles to total with Takedowns to earn extra Boost and the popular Crash mode. The series' gameplay inspired a 2010 reboot of the Hot Pursuit game of the Need For Speed series, by the same developer, Criterion Games.\n\nHistory\n\nBurnout\n\nThe first installment of the series, Burnout was released for the Sony PlayStation 2 systems in November 1, 2001 (NA region), November 16, 2001 (EU region) and for the Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube systems in 29 April, 2002 (NA region) and 3 May, 2002 (EU region).\n\nThe main gameplay mode, Championship mode, where you choose to compete in race events with three other opponents on various tracks. With the difficulty rising up when further into the mode, there are Face-Off events where your opportunity is to beat the rival in the race in order to acquire his vehicle.\n\nThe game received a favourable review on all platforms, averaging a metascore of 79 based on Metacritic.\n\nBurnout 2: Point of Impact\n\nThe first sequel of the series, Burnout 2: Point of Impact was released for the Sony PlayStation 2 systems in 30 November, 2002 (NA region), 11 October, 2002 (EU region).

Expanding on the vehicular combat introduced in Burnout 3: Takedown, Burnout Revenge added new features such as traffic checking and vertical takedowns, and new game modes, Traffic Attack and Crashbreaker Race. The game received critical acclaim from critics and gamers alike.\n\nBurnout Legends was released for the Playstation Portable on September 13, 2005 and for the Nintendo DS on November 29, 2005. Burnout Legends features many of the tracks, cars, and game modes from the first three games in the series repackaged for the portable format. The PSP version was well received critically, while the DS version was widely panned.\n\nBurnout Dominator\n\nBurnout Dominator was released for the Playstation 2 and Playstation Portable on March 6, 2007. It's the only game in the series not developed by Criterion Games. Developed by EA UK (later renamed EA Bright Light). Unlike previous games, Burnout Dominator does not feature Crash Mode, reduces vehicular combat, and restores the classic Burnout boosting system last featured in Burnout 2: Point of Impact.\n\nBurnout Paradise\n\n[Content to be added]\n\nBurnout Crash!\n\n[Content to be added]\n\nReception\n\n[Content to be added]\n\nImpact\n\n[Content to be added]\n\nSearch Interest\n\nExternal References"
