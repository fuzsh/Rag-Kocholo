        "text": "Criterion Games used to be a small, go-getting team making super-fast, very arcadey racing games called Burnout. Eventually scooped up by EA, the series has sadly been put to one side in favour of the better-selling Need for Speed, but it seems the studio hasn't forgotten its roots despite all the change.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Eurogamer, Kieran Crimmins — creative director on the upcoming Need for Speed Unbound — is asked about the potential of a Burnout revival. Rather than brush the question to one side, Crimmins gives a surprisingly hopeful answer.\n\n\"It's not something we're looking at doing now,\" he begins, \"but if you're talking about the two games that the studio has the most passion for, they're obviously Need for Speed and Burnout.\" He continues, commenting that Burnout's \"unique take on racing\" would be \"absolutely phenomenal\" today.\n\n\"So I guess what I'm saying is, I would love to do that,\" Crimmins adds. While a new Burnout isn't \"in the immediate future plans\", he says \"it'd be really fun\"."
