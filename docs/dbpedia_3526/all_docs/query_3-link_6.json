        "text": "While Criterion Games is hard at work on Burnout 5, the first ground-up, next-generation release in its lightning-quick and chaotic racing franchise, EA UK is busy putting the final touches on Burnout Dominator, a throwback to the racing-only elements of the series' past. The game is set to ship early next month exclusively for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. We've had the PS2 game in the office for a couple weeks now, but we had our first chance to play the PSP build just this morning.\n\nThe portable version of Burnout Dominator is identical to the PlayStation 2 version in every way, and actually manages to one-up its console brother by including Ad-Hoc multiplayer support for up to six players and the ability to trade high scores between systems. For our detailed look at the game's general features, click here.\n\nFirst thing's first: Though you may have already checked out the screenshots for the game running on the PSP, you need to see it in action to know how good it looks. While the general detail has been knocked down a notch to run on Sony's portable, when everything is blazing at 150mph+ the two editions look very, very similar. Sure, it's a little harder to see oncoming traffic due to resolution and screen size differences, but the game is just as fast and just as gorgeous as the PlayStation 2 title. Running at a silky-smooth framerate (which we assume had to been hovering around the 60fps mark), it's hard to distinguish between the two titles with everything running at full speed. Kudos to the development team for utilizing the PSP's hardware so well.\n\nOne thing that we noticed in the hour that we spent with the game this morning is that it's actually a little easier on the hands to play than the PlayStation 2 SKU. The PS2 version utilizes full analog control for the gas and brakes, and with them being assigned to face buttons, you need to really mash down on X to make sure you have the car fully throttled at all times. As the PSP doesn't have analog buttons, it removes this bit of stress and leaves you a little more confident that you always have the pedal to the metal.\n\nA second thing that we realized this morning is that the boost meter works a little differently than we thought with regards to performing Burnouts. Rather than having to simply empty the meter in one foul swoop in order to string together a Burnout Chain, you actually need to drive rather insanely at the same time. As your boost burns down right to left, the \"greater than\" arrows that mark your meter will fill up left to right as you drift, drive into oncoming traffic and so on and so forth. If you haven't filled this up by the time that your boost is drained, you'll snap your supercharger boost and end the Burnout. It's an interesting twist in that it would sometimes cause us to hold onto our full boost until we neared a corner so that we could chain a couple together. Cool stuff.\n\nAside from those bits, everything we did mirrored exactly what we've seen in the PlayStation 2 version of the game, and so far that looks like a very good thing. Load times aren't overly long, only allowing for a quick sip from a drink between races. With Burnout's relatively short races, Burnout Dominator looks like a great fit for on-the-go portable gaming.\n\nBurnout Dominator is currently set to ship March 6th. Tune in soon for our full review."
