        "text": "Burnout: Dominator\n\nBy Patrick Joynt |\n\nBurnout returns to the roots of the series, but is that a good thing?\n\nSpiffy:\n\nMore actual driving skills required; looks good on the PS2; new mode.\n\nIffy:\n\nBurnout got better when it stopped requiring actual driving skills.\n\nBurnout 3 marked a breakthrough point for the Burnout series, when it stopped being racing with super-crashes and became a genre all its own. For disgruntled fans of the series before it went all crash-crazy, however, Burnout: Dominator will be a godsend. Unlike Burnout 3 and Revenge, you won't be handing this one to a friend who hates racing games, telling them \"it's not a racing game, it's Burnout!\" At least, not unless you want to irritate your friend. Dominator makes the series, once again, racing with super-crashes.\n\nI've gotten a lot more hands on time with Dominator since a few weeks ago, and it's definitely inspired mixed feelings. It's great to see the PS2 getting supported with something more than a hack and slash port of a next-gen title, and some of the mechanics that have been introduced (or, mostly, re-introduced) are interesting. Instead of earning a longer boost gauge the more opponents you take down, your boost bar is a fixed size. Having a fixed boost gauge means that the only feasible way to win a race isn't hunting down other drivers. If anything, it seems easier to try and stay in the wrong lane, hug incoming traffic, scramble between other cars at high speed, and keep an eye out for shortcuts. Stealing boost from an enemy driver by slamming them around is fun, but the increased focus on actually driving means you really have to pay attention to the whole road, not just the guys with a position marker above them.\n\nWith no traffic check, slamming into the back of all that pesky traffic isn't an option any longer. This essentially slams the coffin lid shut on the formerly practical technique of staying in your own lane, smashing through any cars you find, and forcing other racers into oncoming traffic. Between the fixed boost gauge and no traffic check, you've already got a game that's a lot more like Burnout 2 than the last two Burnouts. But to really kick that old-fashioned feeling into high gear, Dominator reintroduces Burnouts and the Burnout chain. When your boost gauge is full, if you can blow through the whole thing in one shot you'll get a score bonus for having achieved a \"Burnout,\" as well as a burst of boost when you finish the Burnout. But unlike most of the time you spend boosting, during a Burnout you can recharge your boost meter. You still have to commit the usual moving violations to do so, so you have to do it while traveling very fast. But if you can actually bring your boost gauge all the way back to full while mid-Burnout, you'll be able to just keep going, launching right into another Burnout drag. This is called a \"Burnout Chain,\" which earns you a multiplier for those bonus points. The new Maniac mode exists solely to encourage ridiculous Burnout Chains.\n\nNone of these are bad additions to the game series, but the removal of Crash mode really stings. If you go through these races, unlock the various courses, and then just want to relax with some destruction, you'd better have Burnout 3 or Revenge handy. Drift, Burnout, and Near Miss Challenge races don't make up for not being able to just kick back and utterly destroy an intersection, honestly. Old fans of Burnout, Dominator is looking to be the game you've been waiting for since 2, but for the Burnout 3-era converts, Dominator isn't looking nearly so appealing.\n\nGame Information"
