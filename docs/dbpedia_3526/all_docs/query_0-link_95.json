        "text": "I finally picked up a 360 last weekend. I love it to death, and one of the games I was most looking forward to trying was Burnout Revenge.\n\nBut for some reason, I can't get it to work! Every time I try to put the disk in, I get a screen with a message saying \"To play this game, please insert it in an Xbox 360 console\" in about a dozen languages.\n\nWhat's wrong with my game? Does it need a patch or something???\n\nDo you have any other games for the system? It seems odd that a 360 game would say to put it in a 360 instead of a disc read error. Take it back for another copy if possible. If it is a free copy they may take it if not try contacting Microsoft on the matter.\n\nEdit: I just checked mine and no problem. Then again my copy is one only a few weeks or a month removed from it's release date if I remember right."
