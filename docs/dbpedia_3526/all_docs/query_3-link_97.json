That's right the super-cool PSP.\n\nSo what do you think of it, what stuff (games/films/downloads/accessories) do you have for it so far?\n\nKnow of any good sites to download PSP material? Here are a few.\n\nNote - the latest firmware version in the UK for the PSP is 2.60. It can be gotten from here - http://www.yourpsp.com/psp/psp.html#id=system_software_overview&locale=en_gb&section=support_basics_detail&setlocale=true\n\nhttp://www.yourpsp.com/psp/psp.html#locale=en_gb&section=homepage&setlocale=true - Your PSP - the main PSP site, has free downloads (videos, game enhancements, music, wallpapers).\n\nhttp://community.yourpsp.com/index.php - official PSP forum\n\nhttp://psp.connect.com/main.html - PSP Connect - an official US site which has some video downloads on the main page including an episode of \"Creature Comforts\". Note you don't have to follow their instructions for the video download, I just downloaded the files to my PC, then transfered them to the correct folder on my PSP.\n\nhttp://www.sonypictures.com/psp/index.html - Sony Pictures PSP download area - has film trailers, and some films have wallpapers too (Jessica Alba in \"Into the Blue\" for example). This the US version of the site, the UK one is here - http://www.sonypictures.co.uk/homevideo/index.html\n\nhttp://www.wipeoutpure.com/ - Official WipeOut Pure website - download area with the same extra tracks/ships/etc from the \"Your PSP\" site.\n\nhttp://untoldlegends.station.sony.com/ - Untold Legends Official Site - info on the first RPG for the PSP, and info on its 2006 upcoming sequel.\n\nhttp://mobile.station.sony.com/ - SONY Station Mobile site (this site can be viewed using the PSP browser btw) - lots of downloads related to Sony's games. Has a few SW Galaxies wallpapers.\n\nhttp://www.foxinternational.com/psp/uk/downloads.html - Fox International PSP Download area - downloads for Fox UMDs, mainly trailers.\n\nhttp://www.pspworld.com/ - PSP World - an unofficial PSP news website\n\nhttp://www.teampsp.co.uk/ - Team PSP - an unofficial PSP news site\n\nhttp://www.psppalace.com/index.php?section=5 - PSP Palace - has lots of downloads, haven't used this site yet.\n\nhttp://www.load.gamingextremes.us/] - LOAD Magazine - an unofficial PSP magazine that can be downloaded and read on the PSP (I think it is PDF file format)\n\nhttp://nyc2123.com/ - NYC 2123 Dayender PSP comic - the first comic created to read on the PSP - its basically a series of jpegs, which you can use the top buttons on the PSP to navigate through. It's ok IMHO, but a little sometimes.\n\nK, that's enough for the moment. If you have problems downloading stuff, let me know and I'll try to advise. I know a solution to downloading probs I encountered on Your PSP site, which involved the fact that Sun Microsystem's Java didn't work, I had to get an old version of Microsoft's Java platform. I can provide links and help if you get the same probs.\n\nI may post on the LOST forums to see if they will consider doing PSP content in the UK\n\nI know what you mean Moylesy, and the UMDs have none of the extra features you will usually won't mind paying extra for. From what I understand, Sony are currently making a loss on the actual consoles (that includes the whole \"Value pack\" and probably the new \"giga pack\") due to the expense of the research, so instead of making the console more pricey than it is (and its high, but in terms of what you get its good - does anyone remember the Atari Lynx? I have one in my room right now with 8 games and no adaptor lol, someone at work is buying it off me), the companies are making some gain via the extras - games, UMD films, and accessories. Of them all, the films are the real over-priced ones, though since the games are smaller than their PS2 cousins, I expected them to be at most Â£25. But then again, I have a GBA and the games for that can be Â£30+\n\nHey JediWolst23\n\nCool to see ya here.\n\nI have currently -\n\nGames:\n\nWipeOut Pure\n\nSW Battlefront 2\n\nUntold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade\n\nPro Evolution Soccer 5\n\nUMD films:\n\nSpiderman 2 (I got the freebie)\n\nI, Robot\n\nKing Arthur\n\nI intend to get \"Lord of the Rings Tactics\" tomorrow, I may get Sin City, Kingdom of Heaven, a few other films (like Pirates of the Carribean), and I am debating over \"GTA: Liberty City Stories\".\n\nAlso in December there should be \"King Kong\", \"Prince of Persia\" and maybe \"The Sims 2\".\n\nI forgot to add that there is actually a quite good, but unofficial, magazine out now for the PSP called \"Go>Play\" issue one - it's Â£3.49 and it out now, issue two is out at the end of December. Note that is the full magazine spin-off from \"Play\" magazine's small pullout also called \"Go>Play\". Play has now stopped this insert, as the 114 page magazine will provide the full coverage. I recommend it since there is still no sign of anty official mag to the PSP. The new Official Playstation magazine (out now) btw has a guide booklet for GTA with it.\n\nOh, I got the 1gb card too btw, it is necessary for keeping a few movie clips, some mp3 albums, software updates, and other stuff on there. I got a SanDisk Pro for Â£75 from Game, expensive, but in the end worth it, each of the WipeOut Pure extra packs from the YourPSP site is like 18mb at a time.\n\nI have complained about the DS before, so i won't do it again.\n\nI can compare them seeing i have both and i play my PSP far more\n\nThe DS was not Nintendo's best effort and they know that and that is why in the next two years the GBA 2 will be along and i can ensure u that it will be very similar to the way the PSP is laid out in terms of graphics\n\nNintendo no longer have dominance in the market, and i love Nintendo and their games i was gutted they delayed Zelda till next year but i will still buy it, they jst dnt produce the games they use to and are relaying on Mario to sell it for them. And wots with all these sub mario sport games\n\n(sorry timbolton i dnt want to turn this into a 'lets slag off Nintendo and Sony)\n\nI own a DS and love it, but even I have to say that the PSP looks lovely and the screen is just\n\nI think when it comes to portable gaming, the PSP misses the point completely . While the DS, with Nintendos vast experience, does the job nicely. And Mario kart DS is a stunning game and shows how powerful the DS actually is and that gaming is meant to be fun.\n\nBut if you want a portable PS2, then you can't complain too much at all.\n\nThat said, I do keep an eye on the PSPs games (new releases and future releases) because if I can afford to I wouldn't say no to getting one at some point. I do find it very expensive though, especially the memory cards when you can get a 30 GB ipod for Â£200.\n\nOne draw black with the shiny black paint job are fingerprints. You must have to clean it every five minutes to maintain its beauty....that's why I would opt for the white one\n\nNow now, the Atari Lynx had a graphical advantage, as did the Game Gear, but to kick the butt of any console you have to look at sales figures, now when it comes to that I think you will realise that Lynx was a flop. Espically compared to the Gameboy, the most successful games console in history, been produced for over a ten year period without any major overhaul.\n\nI think that goes to show something about the handheld market, it isn't graphics that is going to make it in the market, but simple pick up and play games that can have hours of fun or be a five minute blast. Now the PSP doesn't handle this well with long load times, and when I am out I will not often use the PSP, because a bus journey or a small wait is used mostly by loading times, the DS is quick. The PSP suffers been a portable console that is often just played around the house.\n\nNintendo are still the major force in this market, with europe the only area really where the PSP is outselling the DS, and not by much. The DS was a brilliant effort by nintendo also, less then a year from annocement to peoples hands, and managing to get in new control methods as well. But Tim really does bring the right point, they are not comparable, because of the aims. PSP is for the casual gamer and the chic geeks, while the DS is going for the old school gamers looking for something new from games(because they are very very stale at the moment) and also a whole new market, everyone.\n\nAnd I shall say again, Advanced Wars DS. And follow that up with Mario Kart DS - Online.\n\nheh Ramble, I (*grudgingly* ) admit that in sales terms that the Lynx was a big big big flop, shame that it didn't catch on, it was graphically superior at the time, and the games that did come out I loved - Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure! PARTY TIME, EXCELLENT! Had a go on the Lynx today, then sold it to a work colleague had more use for it that me.\n\nAnyways lol.\n\nJust seen a game that may be worth taking a peek at around March next year, supposedly quite popular in Japan -\n\nMonster Hunter Freedom (by Capcom) -\n\nhttp://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-portable/monster-hunter/\n\nhttp://media.ps2.gamespy.com/media/744/744247/imgs_1.html\n\nhttp://www.capcom-europe.com/news.aspx?ID=100\n\n\"Based on the PS2 title Monster Hunter G, which was only released in Japan, Monster Hunter Freedom expands the Monster Hunter experience with brand new quests and features. The game is visually stunning, with the dramatic environments equally as impressive as the huge monsters that roam them. Just like the home console version Monster Hunter Freedom offers both single and multiplayer missions for up to 4 players via the PSP?s Ad Hoc mode, with objectives such as defeating specific beasts or collecting items and then allowing you to build up your hunter and create new and more powerful weapons and armour.\n\nCreated specifically for Monster Hunter Freedom Felyne Kitchen is a new feature where players can train Felynes to cook for them. As the Felynes become more skilled in the kitchen the better the meals they can prepare and the more the player?s statistics will increase. But if you aren?t happy with what they prepare you can always fire them and hire a new batch!\n\nAlso new to for the PSP is The Farm, a small piece of land where the hunter can obtain rare mushrooms, mine ore and catch insects allowing them to obtain essential items without having to travel too far from the village. The Farm will also feature some great mini-games for those who want a quick Monster Hunter experience.\n\nAnother first for the Monster Hunter franchise is Treasure Hunter mode ? a series of missions designed for just 2 players working together to achieve certain objectives. All of the items found or earned in this mode can be kept and used in single player mode.\"\n\nThe planned release date for this title will be 31st March 2006.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000CIA2C6/qid=1133905714/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_10_2/203-9393832-2889506\n\nI just saw the trailer for it, looks visually great, and I like the idea of hunting monsters\n\nand this page for Capcom's announcement about two other upcoming games -\n\nhttp://www.capcom-europe.com/news.aspx?ID=99\n\nI am going to get King Kong and Prince of Persia when they come out, I am sure in one shop it said they were out this Friday, Amazon says next week.\n\nAs for Advanced Wars, looks like the PSP will get their own similar-style game - \"Field Commander\" - http://fieldcommander.station.sony.com/\n\nAnd another recommendation is \"Pinball Classics - The Gottlieb Collection\" - http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009XAMPG/qid=1133913994/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/203-9393832-2889506\n\nExpected out February 3, 2006"
