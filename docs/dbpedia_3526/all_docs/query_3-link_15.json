        "text": "Back in late August, Electronic Arts confirmed what everyone expected--the Burnout series would continue with a new installment on next-generation consoles. However, those unable to pony up for the higher-priced Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles felt as though they were being left in the dust.\n\nIt turns out the console the franchise debuted on, the PlayStation 2, isn't being passed over. Today, Electronic Arts announced the development of Burnout Dominator, exclusively for the PS2 and the PlayStation Portable.\n\nThe game will retain the core gameplay of the series, as players will race at top speeds through dozens of World Tour events testing \"reckless skill-based\" driving techniques. Currently there are no plans for the versions for each platform to interact with each other."
