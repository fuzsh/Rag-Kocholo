        "text": "Burnout Series discussion\n\na good majority of the games in this franchise made my childhood a blast. Burnout 3 really broke ground for the franchise when it introduced the whole Crashbreaker mode. Paradise was never a favourite to me in all honesty, but it did have a really good soundtrack no doubt about it. if I had to rank them from best to worst -\n\n(never actually played Legends)\n\n1. Burnout 3\n\n2. Burnout Revenge\n\n3. Burnout 2\n\n4. Burnout 1\n\n5. Burnout Dominator\n\n6. Burnout Paradise\n\n7. Burnout Crash\n\ni would love to hear other people thoughts on possibly one of my favourite video game franchises of all time that unfortunately didn't make it far into the 2010's. in recent times there has been a game that borrows many elements from the Burnout franchise which was actually made by ex-Criterion developers called \"Dangerous Driving\"\n\ni, for one, have not played this game at this very time. but looking at gameplay videos of it, it really brings me back to when there was a certain charm to old racing games that some of these racing games today do not possess\n\nI've loved them all, including the revamp of Burnout Paradise and the Dangerous Driving. I would love a more up-to-date one though, utilising the hardware we have now, rather than just giving us the old classic style back again. It's great, but we've already had it. Do something new!\n\nBurnout died when it went into the PS3/360 era and became some incredibly uninteresting generic free roam racer and turned it's back on the aspects of it that made it so great in the PS2 days. 1 and 2 were classics, 3 (takedown) was perfection. Heard good things about 4 but don't remember ever playing it. Paradise was f*ckin atrocious though.\n\nDangerous Driving looks about as bad as that Road Rash \"remake\" (which is total sh*t). I get Dangerous Driving is more in tune with the original Burnout and actually has OG Burnout developers involved (i think?) but it just doesn't get me in any way excited.\n\nEdited March 21, 2020 by Cosmic Gypsy\n\nOn 3/24/2020 at 1:58 AM, Lock n' Stock said:\n\nPoint of Impact and Revenge were my personal favourites. Never played Paradise.\n\nPoint of Impact was definitely great but I loved how Revenge carried the whole crashbreaker mode along with the whole takedown system with it. I wouldn't really recommend Paradise if you're not that into open world racer games. As much as I love open world games like GTA and Saints Row and all that, the concept of an open world racing game had many flaws to me.\n\nI've watched a few gameplays of Dangerous Driving and it always seems off to me. I mean, I applaud the dev's intentions: ex-Criterion employees who made their own studio to sort of keep Burnout's spirit alive, but it feels like a mobile knock-off. Maybe it's because vehicles seem too light, or the sense of speed is off. Then again, I haven't played it, so I might be wrong.\n\nRaycevick has a great video on why I think Burnout feels quite unique:"
