        "text": "Each track in Burnout Dominator has a forward and reverse configuration, like the other games of the franchise.\n\nEurope[]\n\nTuscany[]\n\nBased on the region in Italy of the same name, the circuit has a small village full of open shortcuts, tight streets, along with asphalt and dirt roads that run across the vineyards. That makes a beautiful landscape. It is composed of 2 different tracks: Tuscan Hills, and Tuscan View. The symbolic cars of this location are the Drift Classic, the Works GT, the Super Coupe, and the Super Prototype.\n\nAutobahn[]\n\nBased on Cologne, Germany, the player drives along the famous \"no speed limit\" highways of Germany, full of long straights and tunnels, perfect for aggressive driving.

Also, it has the Autobahn Loop, that is the short version of Autobahn, this version in front of the long version is just a highway circuit. It is the shortest track in Burnout Dominator.

It's composed of Spiritual Towers and Spiritual Gate.\n\nAmericas[]\n\nOcean Drive[]\n\nBased on Monterey, California, the player must be careful while drifting into zig-zag roads along the beaches, but also can use the many shortcuts around track.\n\nSteel Town Works[]\n\nA metallurgical city, the player runs through a great concrete and iron jungle full of crossroads, and many industrial parks. It is inspired by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nGlacier Falls[]\n\nBased on the countryside of Colorado, USA, the player must race along the forest roads and a small town. You must also boosts when you drive uphill. The only symbolic car of this track is the American Classic.\n\nBlack Gold Highway[]\n\nHere, the player will be surrounded by crazy highway junctions and petrochemical complexes. It is inspired by Houston, Texas. The symbolic cars of this track are the Classic Muscle, the Works M-Type, the Blue Lightning and the Charger.\n\nCarnival Point[]\n\nInspired on the vibrant Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The player drives along the exuberant Copacabana sidewalk on the sunset, enjoying the tropical cityscape from the hills, and drift around from the favelas to the old town. This track exclusive to the US/EU PlayStation Portable release of Burnout Dominator. It can be downloaded for free online. Along with Red Gate, it was originally going to appear in the PS2 release. It was also removed for unknown reasons. This track does not feature any Signature Shortcuts. The only symbolic car of this track is the Euro Super.\n\nNotes[]"
