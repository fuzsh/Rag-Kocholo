CLEVELAND, OH (WOIO) - Channing Frye took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to make news.

Frye will step aside after 14 years in the NBA. Drafted eighth overall by the New York Knicks in 2005, Frye played for five other teams over the course of his career. Cavalier fans will always remember him as part of the 2016 team that won the NBA Finals.

Frye is back with the Cavaliers this season but has played sparingly.
