        "text": "Kevin Love has been popping up in trade rumors in recent weeks, but his teammate Channing Frye doesn’t seem to have much pity. Following last night’s win in New York, a game where Love finished with 23 points and 16 rebounds, Frye was asked about the trade talk and jokingly said that he doesn’t “feel sorry for him.”\n\nMore from ESPN:\n\n“As a teammate, I don’t feel sorry for him,” Channing Frye told ESPN. “Who cares about rumors? We love him. We know what he does for this team. He’s a Banana Republic model. … Dude, he’s fine. He’s absolutely fine. He knows that we have his back.”\n\nLove doesn’t seem to fazed by the rumors either and was equally sarcastic about trade talk:\n\n“My life is so tough,” a sarcastic Love said after putting up 23 points and 16 rebounds in the Cleveland Cavaliers’ 111-104 win over the New York Knicks. “Oh, rumor mill! Aw, God.”\n\nFollowing a rough January, the Cavs have won their first two games in February and take on a surging Wizards team on Monday night."
