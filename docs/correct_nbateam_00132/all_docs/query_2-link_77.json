        "text": "If you want to watch Channing Frye play basketball, you better hurry because there isn’t much time.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers forward and former Arizona Wildcat indicated Friday on Instagram that he will be retiring at the end of the season, saying “playing at (Madison Square Garden) for the last time last night had me thinking how fast time has flown by.”\n\nCavaliers teammate Jeff Green commented, “no, don’t retire bro” to which Frye replied, “it’s time bro!”\n\nFrye, 35, is in his 13th NBA season. He has appeared in 29 games for the Cavs this year, averaging 3.3 points in 9.5 minutes, both career lows.\n\nFor his career, Frye is averaging 8.8 points per game and carved out a role as a stretch four, shooting 39 percent from 3 across 883 games.\n\nFrye has played for six teams and was a double-figure scorer in five seasons. He was drafted by the New York Knicks with the No. 8 overall pick in 2005 and won a championship with Cleveland in 2015-16.\n\nFrye was a four-year starter at the University of Arizona and a two-time All-Pac-10 selection. The White Plains, New York native averaged 13.5 points, 7.3 rebounds and 1.9 blocks over his UA career."
