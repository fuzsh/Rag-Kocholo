        "text": "Posted By Damien Alameda - bio | email\n\nPHOENIX - The Phoenix Suns today signed unrestricted free agent Channing Frye to a one-year deal with a player option for a second season, the club has announced.\n\n\"We're excited to welcome Channing home to Phoenix,\" said Suns President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Steve Kerr. \"We're fortunate to add a player of his caliber to our frontcourt. Channing fits our style perfectly because of his ability to run and shoot with range, and he's our kind of person, too - a great teammate with high character and someone who is very community-minded.\"\n\nThe 6-11, 245-pound Frye is a four-year NBA veteran originally selected with the eighth overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft by the New York Knicks. Frye, who spent his first two career seasons with the Knicks (2005-07), joins his third NBA team following a two-year stint most recently with the Portland Trail Blazers (2007-09). The 26-year-old owns career averages of 8.2 points and 4.5 rebounds in 278 games (94 starts).\n\nFrye's best statistical seasons came with consistent minutes in his first two NBA campaigns with the Knicks. Frye averaged 10.8 points and 5.6 rebounds in 25.3 minutes in 137 games in 2005-06 and 2006-07, including a career-high 12.3 points in garnering NBA All-Rookie First Team honors in 2005-06.\n\nThe decorated former University of Arizona standout spent four seasons in Tucson, earning First Team All-Pac 10 honors as both a junior and senior while serving as co-captain of the Wildcats. Frye finished his career with the Wildcats ninth on the school's all-time scoring list (1,789), third in rebounds (975), second in blocks (258) and fourth in field goals made (707). Frye won the 2005 Pac-10 Sportsmanship Award.\n\nA graduate of Phoenix St. Mary's High School, as a senior Frye led his team to the 2001 5A State Championship, a title won on the Suns' home floor at US Airways Center (then America West Arena). Following that season, Frye was named Arizona Player of the Year by the Arizona Republic after averaging 22.0 points, 15.0 rebounds and 6.0 blocks.\n\nWell-known for his community endeavors, Frye established the C. Frye Foundation in 2007, dedicated to teaching youth how to strive for their personal best and to create a healthy lifestyle through exercise, nutrition, support systems, and respect. One of the centerpiece efforts of the foundation and its work with young athletes is Frye's sponsorship of the C. Frye Bulldogs, a Phoenix-based, high school-aged travel basketball team. Frye also hosts basketball leadership camps and instructional clinics for youth.\n\nFrye now brings his passion for environmentally-friendly initiatives and energy conservation to one of the league's \"greenest\" organizations. The C. Frye \"Go Green Team\" educates and encourages organizations, schools and gyms to reduce their carbon footprint and increase recycling efforts.\n\nIn addition, Frye hosted the inaugural C. Frye Celebrity Golf Tournament in 2008 at Phoenix's Raven Golf Course to benefit his foundation's work.\n\nBorn in White Plains, N.Y., Frye is the son of Karen and Thomas Frye and has one brother, Logan. Karen is an Emmy-winning former reporter and producer for a Phoenix television station and Thomas is the co-founder and former co-president of Education Solutions and Services, which offers office support to public and private charter schools. Frye's grandfather, John Mulzac, was a member of the legendary Tuskegee Airmen."
