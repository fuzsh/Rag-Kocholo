        "text": "Since 2009, Channing Frye has donned No. 8 as a power forward and center for the Phoenix Suns. Though born in White Plains, N.Y., the basketball star is no stranger to Arizona, as he attended St. Mary’s High School in Phoenix and University of Arizona. Read on as the new dad (Frye and his wife, Lauren, have an infant son, Hendrix) talks about the joys of fatherhood as well as where you might catch him for breakfast.\n\nAFM: Has basketball always been a love of yours?\n\nCF: Definitely. Growing up, basketball was a way for me to meet friends, a way to express myself, let my emotions go, challenge myself and stay out of trouble.\n\nAFM: Many young people aspire to be a pro athlete. How does it feel to have actually met this goal?\n\nCF: It feels good. I think everything happens for a reason. Being an NBA player comes with a lot of responsibilities. So, for me, it’s just about appreciating the opportunity that I have.\n\nAFM: What do you love most about being a Phoenix Sun?\n\nCF: It’s great being back home. I enjoy being part of the community, a member of this organization and playing with greats like Steve [Nash] and Grant [Hill].\n\nAFM: What’s it like getting to be a member of your home state’s basketball team?\n\nCF: It’s great. I grew up watching the Suns, so I take a lot of pride in wearing the uniform. I just want to help us become successful while I am here.\n\nAFM: As a longtime Valley resident, what are some of your favorite local hangouts?\n\nCF: I don’t really go shopping much. I like the clothes at Exclusively Big & Tall. My wife and I really love eating at Over Easy for breakfast, La Grande Orange, Chelsea’s Kitchen and Roka Akor.\n\nAFM: How has being a father impacted your life?\n\nCF: It has calmed me down and taught me to appreciate the little things. You think you love something or someone, but you don’t love anything more than you love your kids. Probably the biggest thing my son has done for me is help me find that love and motivate me to stay on the right path.\n\nAFM: You are celebrating your first Father’s Day this year. Any plans?\n\nCF: I don’t even know what day Father’s Day is to be honest. My wife will have to tell me about all of that [laughs]."
