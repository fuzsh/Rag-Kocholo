        "text": "Unrestricted free agent Channing Frye, who played for the Blazers from 2007-2009, told The Oregonian on Monday he would be open to returning to Portland. “Of course coming back would be an option,” Frye wrote in an e-mail to The Oregonian. “I love the city, the fans, and the players they have are top notch.”\n\nOne free agent target for the Cavs is expected to be Channing Frye, who played for Phoenix last season. General Manager David Griffin likes big men who can shoot. Griffin also was with the Suns when Frye was brought to Phoenix. The 6-foot-11 Frye averaged 11.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and shot .432 from the field (.370 on 3-pointers). Frye fires away from outside, 432-of-778 field goal attempts were 3-pointers. He is an unrestricted free agent, and has a relationship with Griffin.\n\nThe Suns have their own three free agents who McDonough said the Suns have prioritized re-signing. Frye and the Suns will explore a contract, but he has interest from at least Cleveland and Golden State, the latter of which has former Suns President Rick Welts, former Suns coach Alvin Gentry and former Suns General Manager Steve Kerr. Frye likely has firm interest to prompt his decision to decline a $6.8 million salary for 2014-15."
