        "text": "The Cleveland Cavs big man with a sense of humor brings us back to our glory days.\n\nLast season, the Cavs sacrificed Channing Frye in a last-ditch attempt to beat the Golden State Warriors. That didn’t work out. But this year, the fan-favorite forward is back. We broke down why the Cavs need the 3-point-shooting big man more than ever.\n\nChanning Frye can crack a joke. At the expense of himself or bestie Kevin Love, Frye’s humor brings levity, and he lets fans in on it with his Road Trippin’ podcast and social media accounts. In trying times, it’s nice to have someone to lighten the mood.\n\nHe’s seen it all. Frye missed 2012-13 due to an enlarged heart. He joined a highly dysfunctional Cavs team midseason in 2016 and helped it come back from a 3-1 deficit to win a title. After being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers last year, he mentored a group of young players — something the Cavs need him to do again. Frye brings the perspective of a seasoned NBA vet.\n\nFrye is forever a champion. Frye, Love, J.R. Smith and Tristan Thompson are the only remaining members of the 2016 title team. As the LeBron era ends, this group of champs is a soothing reminder of our most glorious moment."
