        "text": "PHOENIX — Channing Frye’s NBA career is almost over.\n\nWhen he retires after the Cavaliers’ final game next week, Frye will leave the league holding down No. 98 on its all-time 3-pointers list, not bad for a 7-footer who attempted 23 treys over four college seasons at Arizona.\n\nSo to celebrate Frye’s 13 pro seasons, spent in Cleveland and New York and Portland and Phoenix and Orlando and Los Angeles, we thought we’d talk in 3s. Ask him to look back on his time with three answers or examples to each question from The Athletic.\n\nThe affable Frye was happy to oblige. He didn’t get a preview of the questions, and each answer, as you’ll see, was delivered with thought. His buddy Kevin Love interrupted us during the interview, time and again.\n\nThere was one question, though, for which Frye could only come up with two answers.\n\nHow would he like to be remembered?\n\n“I was a great teammate and I love all my teammates, and then No. 2 is I’m a champion,” Frye said, seated on a bench chair inside San Antonio’s AT&T Center one morning last week. “So I don’t care if anyone says I suck, because I don’t. If they’re like well, you’re not playing now, that happens to everybody.\n\n“Listen, I’m rich, I’m a champion, I’m 35 and retiring and I’m living a great life. So, if you think I suck, I’ll see you at L.A. fitness in a year, motherfucker.”\n\nYeah, this whole interview is like that.\n\nAs we bomb 3s with Frye one last time, there are a few things you need to know to follow along. One, his only championship came with the Cavs in 2016. Two, he signed with the Suns as a free agent in 2009 and was on their Western Conference finalist team in 2010. Three, Richard Jefferson is his best friend in the NBA. Four, Frye missed an entire season (2012-13) with an enlarged heart. Five, both of his parents died within a month of each other in 2017.\n\nOther than that …\n\n“Ask away,” Frye said. “I don’t give a fuck.”\n\nThe Athletic: Three great nights out you can share without getting arrested or divorced?\n\n“How do you know I haven’t been arrested? Shit, I had a really good night last night. After we won in Toronto, 2016, (in the Eastern Conference finals) we threw a party. That was probably my best night. Shockingly after we lost to Kobe (Bryant and the Lakers) in the 2010 (Western) finals, I went out, crazy. All my friends were there and just a great experience. First time I ever smoked a cigarette. Kobe crushed us so bad that I actually smoked a cigarette with the people outside. Never did it again but I felt it was necessary. We were in Phoenix. Some dirty dive bar and I was outside and just venting how Kobe is absolutely amazing. He single-handedly beat us. (As for the Toronto party) It was in Cleveland. Flew home, had a couple days, and then threw a party in Cleveland. Fuck. I’m just saying it was dinner at Kevin’s. Obviously, that’s a great spread, and then just going out with the fellas. The fact that everybody was out. Just the team camaraderie part to me, that was the best part. The guys, not a care in the world, just having a good time, just chilling.”\n\nThree times you cried?\n\n“When my son was born the first time. Well, I have four kids, so, four times. I cried when we won. So when my kids were born was one, when we won in 2016 was two, and when I finished the season after my heart, I played all 82 games and didn’t miss a practice. (So like, last day of the 2013-14 season?) Last day of that season. I played all 82, which was huge. Doesn’t happen all the time. I’ve only done it once in 14 years. Tried to keep myself healthy. (And you cried right after the Cavs won Game 7?) No, no, no. Celebrated, celebrated, got home, or actually got off the plane, got a big ol’ margarita and cried as I was drinking that big-ass margarita. That’s when it hit me. It’s amazing. You have one singular focus, and then it’s like, to finally let go of that. I think it was when I went to my local watering hole in Westlake, Don Ramon’s. That’s where I got that big-ass margarita. I was like ‘yeah, keep it going.’ Just went home, got a margarita and cried because at no point ever has it been done (winning a Finals after falling behind 3-1 in the series), what we did. And then I’ve never been so focused on something in my life for that long. And then emotionally invested to where nothing else in life mattered until it was over. It was crazy.”\n\nThree favorite games\n\n“One of them would be Game 4 here (in San Antonio), we swept the Spurs in 2010. That was huge. I think it changed a lot of things, suddenly, not only in this organization with the Spurs, but for us on the Suns, and for me and my career. Obviously, Game 7, 2016, and then another one would be the game in Indiana where we played the Pacers and I hit the game-winning shot (February 2011).”\n\nThree samples of words of wisdom from coaches?\n\n“Alvin Gentry was like, ‘based on your paycheck, you’ve only got to play good two out of four games a week.’ He was joking with me. obviously. Larry Brown: ‘Run with it son.’ And then Steve Kerr was like ‘dude, go have a beer. You live a good life.’ I was tripping out because I was in a shooting rut in the playoffs, having the worst night ever and he said ‘go have a beer, chill out, you live a good life.’ ”\n\nThree things you’ll tell your kids about LeBron?\n\n“No. 1, he has smelly breath. Smelly breath. No. 2, he was a freak of nature. And then No. 3, Kyle Korver and I fixed his jumper for one year. (Funny, Korver takes the credit for that.) I know, but Korver, Channing, it’s all the same. It’s all about Korver.”\n\nThree things you tell younger players?\n\n“Keep your routine, learn and have fun.”\n\nThree moments you would take back?\n\n(Love chimes in with: “He would’ve been nice to me early in my career.”)\n\n“Yeah, that’s one, I would’ve been nice to Kevin earlier in my career. No. 2, I would’ve worked on dribbling earlier in my career. And No. 3, I would’ve just taken more pictures. I can’t be upset at what I did back in the past, just because I can’t change it, and, I know how I felt at that time, whether I was right or wrong, and I’m pretty happy where I’m at now. I wouldn’t be where I’m at now if I hadn’t been a douchebag back then. So that’s kind of where I’m at.” (But you would’ve taken more pictures?) “I would’ve taken more pictures. I feel like I’ve had great times and great relationships with a lot of awesome people. I would’ve taken more pictures for more memories of it all.”\n\nThree craziest teammates?\n\n“Stephon Marbury, Shump (Iman Shumpert) and Larry Sanders.” (Why?) “Steph was crazy just because he is uber-smart and he’s always trying to find the bigger, better thing. He has a huge New York personality. He’s a great guy. Absolutely a great guy, great teammate. He just is super smart and is always trying to change the game. Who was next? Shump? Shump is wild because he is so musically and artistically inclined. He just cannot conform to regular society roles. And I respect that, but he’s that way every single day. If everything’s quiet, Shump has to be loud. If everything is loud, Shump would be quiet. He just can’t do it, but I respect him for it because he’s like that every single day. And then Larry is crazy because he is crazy. I don’t know him that well because he was only here for a short time, but, you know, he’s up there.”\n\nThree times you almost quit?\n\n“The first day that I came back from figuring out that my heart was OK. It took me an hour to do 100 pushups and 100 lunges, and I thought, is this worth it? Honestly, last year when I got traded (by Cleveland to the Lakers) and then I found out I had an appendix injury. And then when I found out my parents died. I remember thinking ‘this ain’t worth it.’ ”\n\nThree fair criticisms of you as a player?\n\n“I’m not a good one-on-one defender at times. I just figured I’d outscore you, which I did most of the time. I’m not a good dribbler, very true. And No. 3, I am not very athletic. Half true depending if it’s cold outside, because my bones get tight. I wasn’t soft, I wasn’t any of that kinda like, I didn’t shy away from contact. I’ll hack a motherfucker to death. I didn’t shy away from competition. I loved it. You could ask Z-Bo (Zach Randolph). He knew it every game we played each other. He’s the most physical player I’ve ever played against. I was like listen, ‘let’s get ready to rumble homie. Right, I’m Hulk Hogan, you’re the Ultimate Warrior, and let’s go.’ ”\n\nThree things about 3-pointers you’d like to share?\n\n“No. 1, 3 is worth more than 2. Floor spacing is key. If you ain’t shooting a 3 then it better be a dunk.”\n\nThree people you’d like to thank?\n\n“I would say definitely my teammates here in Cleveland. Definitely everyone on the staff, I’d like to thank them for allowing me to do absolutely nothing this year. Secondly, this is kind of a big group, when I left Portland to come to Phoenix, I’d like to thank Griff (David Griffin), Steve Kerr, Alvin Gentry for giving me a chance and keeping it very real with me and working with me. I took way less money to go there because I trusted them and they didn’t disappoint me. Basically, they helped launch my career and help me be who I am. And No. 3 would be all my teammates I had relationships with. I just saw like Eric Bledsoe and Marcus (Morris) and Markieff (Morris) and Goran Dragic and Marcin Gortat. And even like Brandon Roy and like Steve Blake and Jamal Crawford and all these guys. Malik Rose and, you see all these guys and you forget how into the season you are with them and how much you want them to win and do good.”\n\nThree times you really laughed?\n\n“When Amar’e Stoudemire dunked on Richard here in San Antonio, boomed his head. Please get that film, he was so mad. When I got a dunk in the Atlanta game (2016 Eastern Conference semifinals), and then when I dunked on Gorgui Dieng two years ago.”\n\nThree ways the game has changed since you joined the NBA?\n\n“When I started in the league, the first way, it was post-up, iso ball, so a lot of big post-up guys. Shaq, Yao, Alonzo Mourning, these big, huge guys. Then it went to a little bit more mobile. You would think like Amar’e and myself or Robin Lopez and Amar’e, and then you would think like Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur, shooting bigs that could create space. One in. You would go to like the Big 3, so you would get three all-stars on a team, and now everything is system based. Everything is completely system based. I think San Antonio started that. I think teams started recognizing that. Not everyone can be an iso player, but you’ve got more guys coming earlier from college, so if you have a really good system you can compete. I think a great example of that is Brad Stevens in Boston. It doesn’t matter who you put in there, you just replace them in the system. Like this is your spot. Or (Mike) Budenholzer in Milwaukee. You’re not a position, this is just the spot you’re in. So you do this. And it’s positionless basketball. The European game, the younger guys you get you’re actually helping them grow in your system. (All of those are one thing — style of play. What else?) Two? Social media completely changed the game, where if you get dunked on and it’s a Tuesday in Memphis, nobody sees it. But now, everyone sees it. Thirdly, these kids’ bodies and like the maintenance that they take care of themselves is way different. But they also don’t take as many breaks during the summer. You don’t really hear about guys being out of shape. You hear about overuse injury. Old guys would play during the season, get in shape during the season, then take a couple months off and go do that. Now it’s like as soon as the season’s over, you’re hearing Victor Oladipo is back in the gym. Some of these injuries come from overuse, but no one is going to tell them that. Trainers don’t get paid if you’re taking time off.”\n\nThree things fans don’t understand about the NBA?\n\n“They don’t understand defensive schemes. So sometimes if a guy is shooting a bunch of shots, it’s because the other team wants him to shoot all those shots. They don’t understand the daily grind and monotony of coming out and doing the same stuff and the same things day after day. And they don’t understand the impact that they have on the game. I think guys loving playing for a crowd that is not only enthusiastic for their team, but even when they’re booing the other team but in a respectful way, guys respect that. I think you look at some of the better places to play, Portland, Oklahoma City, Milwaukee, Dallas, those fans, you really don’t hear a lot of bad stuff from them, but you definitely see their enthusiasm. I think playing in Phoenix, playing in Orlando, playing in Portland, New York, it’s just different to see what the different fans do. Like in New York, when they start booing, the team starts playing a little harder. The other team starts playing harder. I think the more you’re involved in the game as a fan, the better.”\n\nThree things Richard Jefferson taught you?\n\n“One, the first thing Richard taught me was ‘it’s not that serious, Channing.’ No. 2, try and see the bigger picture. No. 3, don’t complain about the minutes, if when you get the minutes you’re pouting. Just like, if you get six minutes, go dumb hard for six minutes. Maybe you’ll get eight. If you get eight, go dumb hard for eight, and figure it out from there. And just to add 3A, he’ll never lose an argument. I don’t argue with Richard about anything.”\n\nThree things that surprised you about living and working in Cleveland?\n\n“Restaurants were unreal. The fans are rabidly loyal. (Love chimed in here to tell Channing to say ‘Kevin’s team parties.’ He was a little disappointed when we told him we already covered them.) I’ve never been as cold as I have been coming off some of those airplanes with that wind chill.”\n\nThree things to know about being a rookie in New York?\n\n“It’s the Garden is one of the greatest places to play. Knicks fans are some of the best and most loyal but demand the most from you. And I think younger generations need to understand what an experience and opportunity it is to play for that organization, and the NBA is better when the Knicks are good.”\n\n(Top photo: David Liam Kyle / Getty Images)"
