        "text": "Channing Frye scored a career playoff-high 27 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers kept up their three-point barrage Friday, pulling away in the closing minutes for a 121-108 victory over the Hawks in Atlanta and a 3-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nTwo nights after setting an NBA record with 25 baskets beyond the arc, the Cavaliers were nearly as good in a 21-of-39 performance from long range that moved them within one victory of their second playoff sweep over the Hawks in two years.\n\nThe Hawks led by as many as 11, but were dominated in the closing minutes.\n\nCleveland’s LeBron James and Kyrie Irving each scored 24 points while Kevin Love chipped in with 21.\n\nFrye was 10-of-13 shooting, including 7-of-9 from three-point range. He also had seven rebounds.\n\nKNICKS CONTACT VOGEL: The Knicks passed on the chance to even speak to Tom Thibodeau or Scott Brooks before the highly regarded head coaches landed new jobs in recent weeks. But according to reports, the team at least touched base with Frank Vogel’s agent.\n\nThe New York Post reported that Knicks’ general manager Steve Mills called Vogel’s agent, Lonnie Cooper, to check if the former Indiana Pacers coach had any interest in discussing the Knicks’ vacancy. While no interview was scheduled and Knicks team president, Phil Jackson, is on vacation in Montana, it was at least a first step.\n\nInterim coach Kurt Rambis has been the favorite to land the job with Jackson only speaking to Luke Walton, who wasn’t interested and took the Lakers’ job, and former Cleveland coach David Blatt. Vogel, whose contract was not renewed by the Pacers, is expected to draw interest from the Rockets and Kings, too.\n\nBRIEFS: Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry (knee) returned to practice to test his sprained knee and was strong in his lateral movement though the team didn’t scrimmage. And the Warriors still consider him doubtful to play in today’s Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals at Portland, coach Steve Kerr said. The Warriors lead, 2-0. … The Utah Jazz extended the contract of coach Quin Snyder, saying only that it will take him past the 2016-17 season.\n\nStaff writer Steve Popper contributed to this article."
