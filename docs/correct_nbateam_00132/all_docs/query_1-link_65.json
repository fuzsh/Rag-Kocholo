        "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers have acquired big man Channing Frye from the Orlando Magic, as first reported by the New York Daily News' Frank Isola. The Cavaliers will send a 2018 first-round pick and big man Anderson Varejao to the Portland Trail Blazers, and the Magic will get Jared Cunningham and a second-round pick, according to The Vertical's Adrian Wojnarowski and USA Today's Sam Amick. Varejao and Cunningham are both expected to be waived.\n\nCBS Sports' Ken Berger confirmed the deal.\n\nGiven that Varejao was out of the rotation, Cleveland is essentially getting Frye for nothing. That's a big move for a team that is looking to improve as the playoffs approach. Frye has been largely out of sight and out of mind in Orlando, but he's only a couple of years removed from being one of the best pick-and-pop guys in the league. When he was with the Phoenix Suns, his ability to space the floor and defend big men was a big part of their 48-win season in 2013-14. After he signed with the Magic, Phoenix was never quite able to replace him. The Cavs' frontcourt rotation is crowded, but coach Tyronn Lue will have to find a way to get him on the floor.\n\nVarejao has been a Cavalier since 2004-05, so it will be weird to see him in another uniform. He said last month that he wanted to stay in Cleveland and win a title, but the writing was on the wall. After the Cavs traded for Timofey Mozgov last season, it was always going to be difficult for Varejao to earn minutes. Perhaps the 33-year-old will be able to get his career back on track after he is waived.\n\nAs pointed out by the Orlando Sentinel's Josh Robbins, Orlando can have as much as $45 million of cap space in July now. It is clear that the Magic see themselves as a free-agent destination.\n\nGRADE THE TRADE\n\nCavaliers receive: Channing Frye\n\nCleveland saved more than $10 million in this deal, per ESPN’s Dave McMenamin, and improved. That’s difficult to do, so general manager David Griffin should be applauded. For a while there, it looked like the Los Angeles Clippers were going to be the team that pried Frye away from Orlando. Instead, it was the Cavaliers, who are immediately a more versatile and dangerous offensive team.\n\nHere's the downside: Frye, while helpful, is more of an old-school stretch big than a new-wave playmaking 4. If Cleveland makes it back to the NBA Finals for a rematch with the Golden State Warriors, it will not be comfortable with Frye switching on to their smaller players. Frye should help the Cavs get back to the finals, though, so the deal seems worthwhile. Grade: A\n\nBlazers receive: Anderson Varejao, 2018 Cleveland first-round pick\n\nPortland hoarded cap space so it could make a deal like this. Sure, it has to eat Varejao's salary, but that's a relatively small price to pay for a first-round pick. With the salary cap about to rise like crazy, those picks are even more valuable than they were before.\n\nEverybody knew that the Blazers were going to facilitate a trade for someone, just like the Philadelphia 76ers have done time after time over the last few years. In this instance, they were glad to help out. Grade: A\n\nMagic receive: Jared Cunningham, second-round pick"
