        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nShot very well for a big man and could hit the trey with regularity. A solid defender too, he took care of the basketball. Was highly mobile and fluid for a near-7-footer, and could play well in an up-tempo system. Flashed nice hands and was an excellent free-throw shooter. Had a small forward's game in a center's frame: he did not hit for a high field-goal percentage because he was on the perimeter so much, and was not a big rebounder. Also, he did not intimidate as a shot-blocker and was foul-prone. A serious heart issue threatened his NBA career at one point."
