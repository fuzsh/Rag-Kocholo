        "text": "You think this season’s Knicks outfit is bad? It could be worse. It could be 2005-06. At least this team finishes practice.\n\nChanning Frye, a rookie that season, is now a wise veteran sage for the Orlando Magic, able to look back and laugh (mostly) at the lunacy that unfolded as the mismatched Knicks went 23-59 under Larry Brown and earned the sobriquet “Team Titanic.”\n\nFrye told CBS Sports this week the squad is worthy of a can-you-believe-this documentary, except…\n\n“I don’t think that you could get anybody to talk about some of the stories,” Frye said. “It was crazy. It was a crazy, crazy year, man. I mean, I’ve been in the league for nine years. That was an extremely unique year.”\n\nStephon Marbury and Eddy Curry were the headliners. Jamal Crawford, David Lee, Nate Robinson and Steve Francis were in the house. Penny Hardaway stopped by for a minute.\n\n“You know what, I had guys like Antonio Davis and Malik Rose telling me, ‘This is not what the NBA is like,'” Frye said. “Guys not practicing ‘cause they didn’t want to. Guys just literally come to practice, practice for an hour and then everybody leave and not say a word. I think you had a lot of personalities and guys who were great on individual levels. It just wasn’t, they just weren’t a team. We weren’t a team.”"
