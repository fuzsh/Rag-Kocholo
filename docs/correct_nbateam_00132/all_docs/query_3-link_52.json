        "text": "What happens when you put your grief on hold? In the summer of 2016, Channing Frye was riding high. After over a decade in the NBA, his team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, had won the Championship. Then, in the fall, he hit one of the lowest lows. His mother Karen died of cancer. Just a month later his father, Thomas, also died. Channing put his grief on hold to deal with the logistics of planning two funerals, supporting his family, and going back to work as a professional athlete. Eventually, with the help of his wife, his friends, and a therapist, Channing started to talk about and explore grief in ways that worked better for him. Doing this allowed him to get more present in his life and explore new passions like podcasting and starting a wine label, Chosen Family Wines.\n\nWe discuss:\n\nChanning’s parents and how they supported him in his basketball career\n\nWhat it was like when his parents died\n\nBeing with his mom as she was dying\n\nPutting his grief on hold to take care of business\n\nHow his grief intensified after his dad’s death\n\nGoing back to the NBA soon after his parents’ deaths\n\nThe role alcohol played in his early grief\n\nHow he got into therapy and started working with his grief\n\nReclaiming significant days like birthdays, Father’s Day, and other holidays\n\nHow he stays grounded & connected to his parents\n\nThe connection between grief and the name of his wine label, Chosen Family\n\nFollow Channing on IG,\n\nListen to his podcast, Road Trippin'\n\nSupport Grief Out Loud\n\n\"There are so many podcasts out there on grief but Grief Out Loud is one of only a few that focus on kids and families and strengthening those bonds after a loss.
