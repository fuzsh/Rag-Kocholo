        "text": "Phoenix — You don't just lose to the Suns.\n\nYou run as if you're wearing clown shoes, while they run in sneakers with wings.\n\nYou're the Washington Generals, they're the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nUnlike the Globetrotters, they do lose once in a while, as they did Thursday in Dallas, but last night, Steve Nash and friends took that out on Isiah Thomas' Knicks, 108-86, their 17th victory in the last 19 games.\n\nOr, to quote Thomas' assessment before the game: \"They're gooood.\"\n\nFar too good for a team that was feeling not exactly haughty, but at least proud after Wednesday's triple-overtime victory of survival over the Pistons, the East's best team, plus home-court victories last week vs. Utah and Chicago, three quality Ws in all.\n\nBut those were different teams on a different floor. On their floor, the Suns are now 35-4 since Nash arrived.\n\nWhich wasn't long after Stephon Marbury departed.\n\nHis annual trip back didn't exactly go well last night: 5-for-17 for 14 points and as many assists as turnovers (four). But he wasn't solely to blame for the Knicks' fourth straight road defeat.\n\nThe Knicks' defense surrendered 12-for-26 3-point shooting and couldn't keep the Suns from building a 21-point lead in the first quarter that never dropped below 11 thereafter.\n\nThe Knicks' offense also committed 10 turnovers in that quarter to feed the beast that is the Suns' offense and lose any chance of controlling the game's tempo.\n\nNash, meanwhile, delivered 20 points and nine assists, yet didn't distribute his first dime until the second quarter. But five other Suns scored in double figures, including former Knick Kurt Thomas (12 points, nine rebounds).\n\n\"They're like the old San Francisco 49ers, the way they just pick you apart, and they've got players in every area that can do the things that they want done,\" Thomas said.\n\nHe got 21 points from Jamal Crawford and a double-double (19 points, 10 rebounds) from Eddy Curry. But that wasn't nearly enough to successfully christen the Knicks' five-game western trip.\n\n\"They do as good a job of any one of enforcing their will and their tempo on the game,\" Thomas said. \"I just hope and pray that we can figure out a way to stay in the game and hang around until the last five minutes of the game, then maybe you can start controlling the tempo with our inside play.\""
