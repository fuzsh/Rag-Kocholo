        "text": "Channing Frye doesn't want to predict how the crowd will treat him on Monday.\n\n\"I don't know, really,\" he said. \"Probably a couple of boos, with some ASU fans around here. So for me, I don't what the expectation is, but I'm excited just to be back in here tonight.\"\n\nA Phoenix native, a University of Arizona alum, and a former Sun, Frye will play his last game in Talking Stick Resort Arena on Monday when the Cavaliers take on the Suns.\n\nThe 13-year NBA veteran has played on six teams, spending the most consecutive seasons with the Suns, from 2009 to 2014.\n\nIn March, he announced that he will retire following this season. Frye is relishing this one last road game in Phoenix.\n\n\"It means everything to me,\" he said ahead of Monday's shootaround. \"I grew up a Suns fan, I grew up a guy just wishing I could — I remember sitting up there in high seats with my parents, just watching the game. I remember playing my (5A state) championship game on this court.\n\n\"So for me, it's been a full turnaround to come back here. It's been amazing. I had a great time here, and I'm just glad to have this opportunity to say goodbye.\"\n\nAfter a standout career at Arizona, sprinkled with Pac-10 honors, Frye was the No. 8 overall pick by the Knicks in 2005. He went on to play for Portland, Phoenix, Orlando, Cleveland and the Lakers, but his ties to Arizona never wavered.\n\n\"You smell that?\" he asked as he got off the plane on his Instagram story Monday. \"Smells like beautiful, God's country, Arizona.\"\n\nArizona has been a constant thread in Frye's basketball career. Being in town for the game, he's been able to catch up with his former coaches from Phoenix St. Mary's, including the coach who encouraged him to focus more fully on basketball. At St. Mary's, Frye led his team to a 5A state title his senior year.\n\nHe calls Richard Jefferson, a Moon Valley High and fellow Arizona alum, one of his best friends. The two won a title together in Cleveland in 2016 and still team up routinely, namely to poke fun at LeBron James.\n\nFrye's humor and good nature have made him a fan favorite in the league. Despite a penchant for joking around, he doesn't have any major April Fools' Day pranks planned — at least not right now. Frye seemed to be mulling over a few ideas, but also conceded that he tries to avoid pranking younger players on game day.\n\nHe doesn't think his contingency of family and friends will be too overwhelming for the Monday night game; a lot of his close family and friends are making the trek to Cleveland for the Cavaliers' final two games of the season, which are both at home. With five games left, he's just enjoying the ride.\n\n\"(I'm) just kind of enjoying each game and lucky I get to come here back home for some of my last games, so it means a lot,\" he said.\n\nHave a favorite Frye memory?
