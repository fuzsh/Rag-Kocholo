        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- With his knowledge of the game and effervescent personality, you knew it would only be a matter of time before former Cavaliers fan favorite Channing Frye would get into broadcasting.\n\nFrye, who made the “Road Trippin'” podcast an enjoyable mashup of inside basketball chatter and random side conversations just by being himself, will join NBA TV’s rotating group of analysts on “NBA GameTime” this season.\n\n“NBA GameTime,” a nightly program with highlights and analysis, has a stacked roster of 16 former players that includes Shaquille O’Neal, Kevin McHale, Chris Webber, Kenny Smith, Isiah Thomas, and Grant Hill, so it’s not clear how often Frye will appear. But, since the show airs so often, the 2016 NBA champion with the Cavs should have plenty of opportunities to make an impact.\n\nHe won’t be the only familiar face with Northeast Ohio ties on the show. Former Cavaliers Jim Jackson and Brendan Haywood will also serve as contributors, while Vermilion native Allie LaForce will appear periodically as a commentator."
