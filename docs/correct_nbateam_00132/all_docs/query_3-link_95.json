        "text": "Former Arizona Wildcats center Channing Frye will have a new role with the Cleveland Cavaliers, now that Kevin Love is expected to miss about six weeks because of a knee injury.\n\nAt least for tonight.\n\nFrye will be in the starting lineup for just the fourth time this season when the defending NBA champs play at Minnesota tonight.\n\nHe has started 426 of his 773 career games in the NBA before Tuesday night.\n\n“I’ve had these opportunities before,” he told Cavs.com (which you can watch below).\n\n“The answer is I have to go out there and play my game and making sure I’m ready to go. You know, I’m not an All-Star-caliber level, so I’m not going to try to play like that, so I gotta be me and do what I do.”\n\nLove’s injury should also mean more time for ex-Cat Derrick Williams, who is on a 10-day contract but could stick around for longer. D-Will is finally in a winning situation in his NBA career.\n\nFrye was traded from Orlando to Cleveland last Feb. 18. The 12th-year pro has career averages for 9.2 points and 4.8 rebounds, and he has become known for his 3-point prowess for a big man, hitting 38.9 percent of his attempts from behind the arc.\n\nFrye has earned more than $51 million in NBA salary entering this season, with about a total of $15 million owed to him for this season and next."
