Bio

At just 20 years old, Aaron Ramsey became the youngest footballer ever to be named Captain of Wales’ national football team.

After moving to Arsenal in 2008, his career was almost cut short after a horrific injury. However, Ramsey showed why he is considered one of the most dedicated footballers playing today by overcoming this injury and returning as a key member of the Arsenal squad.

Ramsey proved integral to Arsenal’s last season, scoring the winning goal in the FA Cup Final. His recent goal against Galatasaray in the final round of the group stages of the Champions League has been one of the highlights of the tournament so far.
