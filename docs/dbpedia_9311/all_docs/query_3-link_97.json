        "text": "Woolwichgooner wrote:\n\nWell put coombs, so how would you resolve this problem quickly.\n\nMost managers would just stick him on the bench and play Rosicky.\n\nWith the options we have now, Ramsey needs to be rotated. His position as a guaranteed starter not only fosters the wrong attitude in the squad, but makes no sense even for his own development. Wenger needs to make statements with his squad selection a bit more. Ferguson does it, Mancini does it, all the top managers use squad selection as a motivator as well as a tactic.\n\nAs it stands, the squad selection is based on an ideal (i.e. what COULD be), not on any real and present realities. Wenger and others always say to take it one game at a time and not to dwell on future possibilities. The same should be true for squad selection. What is true NOW is that Ramsey has under-performed in his role and should be dropped/rested.\n\nSo have others. This isn't to pick on Ramsey in particular, its to pick on the squad selection system we have using Ramsey as an example rather than as a scapegoat. I'd like to see a squad selection philosophy in this vein implemented for every position on the pitch, not just CM.\n\nARSUN WHENGA wrote:\n\nKlaus wrote:\n\nYou'd think people would have learned by now, the way they treated Koscielny last year.\n\nBeen burnt by too many chamakh types big kd\n\nThere's a time and place for everything, Dules. Chamakh gets fairly criticised for looking like a League One striker when we know he used to be a class player. Never seen someone deteriorate at that rate. He can't even run anymore. Used to have an engine like a train.\n\nKos and Ramsey are different. It's not that they don't have a couple of flaws but they've been scapegoated for things that aren't really their fault. If our forwards had put away even half of all those clearcut chances Ramsey would have had double figures in the assist charts already. We all know he's a working project but some perspective would still be nice. Think he's been one of our best players so far this season (which might or might not say something about our season, but nonetheless). I don't think swapping Ramsey for a better player would have a significant effect on the team as things stand. I think getting a better forward in who has a bit of playmaking ability and is able to score from normal chances will prove to be the difference between competing for a top three finish and fighting it out with Liverpool and Newcastle for the highest Europa League spot, on the other hand.\n\nBiggus wrote:\n\nBut it remains to be seen how good post injury Wilshere will be.\n\nOr how he'll do in an advanced role. Seems to me everything people want Ramsey to do is what Cesc did last season, not Jack. In terms of goals and assists Ramsey has already done more than Jack last season. Obviously thats because of the role they were asked to play but that begs the question why are people comparing Jack last season and Ramsey this season as if they're like for like. They're not and while I think Wilshere is a brilliant player we still don't know if he's going to be a brilliant player in that role in this flawed side, with this flawed system.\n\nWhat I do know is that Jack and Aaron are both fighters, both brilliant footballers and both will leave it all on the pitch. Less of the sort pussies we've had in the last few years in midfield, no more Denilson, Diaby, Rosicky types.\n\nARSUN WHENGA wrote:\n\nRicky1985 wrote:\n\nLacks pace relative to whom, Mr.Dula?\n\nNot so much straight line pace but agility to switch his position and sort his feet out. Britten gave him a lesson yesterday.\n\nRamsey cannot shape play in his mind but instead tries to react to what he sees. It occasionally comes off but mostly it's read and intercepted.\n\nThe 35 yard back heels look good for the camera mind\n\nI'm rootin for project Ramsey to pass the development stage I really am\n\nTo be fair you were in love with him at the end of last season and during the summer, so you've obviously seen something in him previously.\n\nYesterday was comfortably the fittest, the quickest, the strongest and the most agile I have seen him look for about 2 years. In amongst the seething anger of getting beaten by Swansea, and in amongst his 2 poor moments which effectively cost us the game, I was actually thrilled to see Ramsey looking like Ramsey again. I think back to the second half when Sinclair beat Djourou down the left and ran into our box at full speed - he tried to outpace and outmuscle Ramsey - Ramsey was quick enough and strong enough to shrug him off and win the ball back. I guarantee you he couldn't have done that 6 weeks ago - and that has to be considered when people make definitive statements about what he can and can't do based on this season. For a large part of the season he has been working his way back to full fitness, trying to find his feet, his role in the team, and his confidence.\n\nMaybe he should have played less whilst he was doing that, but it's not like we have a great alternative waiting in the wings, and as I said earlier in the thread, I really don't think he has been all that bad, just not particularly outstanding either.\n\nAnd I don't think Britten gave him a lesson yesterday either."
