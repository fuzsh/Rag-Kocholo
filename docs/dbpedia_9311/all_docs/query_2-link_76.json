        "text": "Juventus have announced that Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey will join them on a free transfer this summer.\n\nJuventus Football Club announce that Aaron Ramey will officially be a Juventus player from 1 July 2019. The Welshman will make the move from Arsenal in the summer, having signed a four-year contract with the Italian champions, tying him to the club until 2023.\n\nBorn on 26 December 1990 in the Welsh town of Caerphilly, Aaron Ramsey began his career at Cardiff City, graduating from the academy and going on to make his first team debut in 2007. A succession of impressive performances from the then-youngster caught the eye of Arsenal, who signed the midfielder in July 2008.\n\nFollowing the switch to North London, Ramsey went on to make his debut for the Gunners in their Champions League qualifier against FC Twente just over two months after signing. To date Ramsey has played in 256 Premier League games for Arsenal, more than any other teammate, whilst scoring a total of 38 top-flight goals from midfield. Aside from two loan spells at Nottingham Forest in 2010, and then back at former club, Cardiff in 2011, Ramsey has spent just over the last decade of his career at Arsenal, contributing to three FA Cup wins and two Community Shield trophies.\n\nAs well as being recognised as a solid Premier League player, Ramsey brings a wealth of European experience, having played in 43 matches in the Champions League, scoring eight goals and providing four assists, a figure that rises to 50 considering also the qualifying stages, in which he has also scored three times. Finally, this is rounded off with nine appearances and five goals in the Europa League.\n\nOn the international stage, Aaron Ramsey has 58 caps for Wales to his name, having scored 14 goals, and was a part of the Welsh side that reached the Euro 2016 semi-finals, with Ramsey being named in the 'Team of the Tournament'.\n\nIn addition, he participated for Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympic Games, turning out a total of five times for Team GB (including a pre-tournament friendly), and scoring one goal from the penalty spot in their Olympic quarter-final against South Korea.\n\nAaron Ramsey will become only the third Welshman to pull on the Black & White shirt in the history of Juventus, following the great, John Charles and former European Golden Boot winner, Ian Rush."
