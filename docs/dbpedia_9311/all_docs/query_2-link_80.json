        "text": "AARON RAMSEY has confirmed his wife Colleen gave birth to twins.\n\nThe Wales international tweeted the news as Ryan Giggs' side earned a hard-fought Nations League win over Ireland.\n\nRamsey, 27, and his childhood sweetheart, also 27, are already parents to three-year-old son Sonny, who will have two new brothers.\n\nArsenal were due to hand the midfielder a new deal but pulled the plug.\n\nAnd the Rambo clan could soon be heading to new pastures with a number of clubs chasing a deal in January.\n\nSunSport exclusively revealed Everton have joined the race for the Gunenrs ace, who can leave on a free in summer.\n\nRamsey and Gareth Bale - who is recovering from an injury - both missed Wales' clash in Dublin.\n\nBut Liverpool starlet Harry Wilson fired in a stunning free-kick to earn a 1-0 victory.\n\nThe result means Wales will be in Pot 2 for the 2020 European Championships draw.\n\nIn 2016, Ramsey starred as the Dragons reached the semi-finals."
