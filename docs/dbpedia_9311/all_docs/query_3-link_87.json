Arsenal’s man of the season has done it again!” In awe, commentator Alan Parry narrated a marvellous, outside of the box strike by the Welshman. The year was 2013. Aaron Ramsey was in the form of his life and Arsenal were top of the Premier League.\n\nAaron Ramsey turns thirty years of age today. A true Arsenal hero, so why not take a moment to appreciate the club’s highest ever goal scoring midfielder.\n\nSigned as a teenager in 2008, Ramsey blossomed from an exciting talent to one of the world’s finest box to box midfielders. Horrible injuries and criticisms were only a handful of obstacles he surpassed on his path to stardom.\n\nFrom boy to man, Aaron Ramsey overcame a tragic injury suffered against Stoke City, and has thrived ever since. Eleven seasons spent at Arsenal saw Ramsey evolve into a captain and leader. A dedicated servant to the club, Ramsey fully paid back the faith placed in him, by manager Arsène Wenger.\n\nMaya Angelou, once stated, “If you’re going to live, leave a legacy. Make a mark on the world that can’t be erased.” What mark has Aaron Ramsey made throughout his time at Arsenal?\n\nScorer of the winning goal in not one, but two FA Cup Finals, Ramsey carved a place for himself in Arsenal history. He’ll forever be fondly remembered for his cup final heroics, and rightfully so. They are extraordinary achievements.\n\nThree hundred and sixty-nine appearances for the club, with some spectacular goals in the process, his incredible accomplishments in the red and white shirt are certainly treasured by Arsenal supporters.\n\nAn extra time winner against Hull City in the 2014 FA Cup Final, goals against arch-rivals Tottenham at White Hart Lane and Wembley respectively, along with a headed winner against Chelsea in the 2017 FA Cup Final, all highlight his status as a big game player for the club.\n\nTwo goals down in the 2014 edition of the FA Cup Final, Arsenal completed one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the FA Cup Final to shock underdogs Hull City. Aaron Ramsey grabbed an extra time winner, with a man of the match display.\n\nIn doing so, he shattered Arsenal’s nine-year trophy drought. Nearly a decade without silverware, Arsenal’s first trophy since their move into the Emirates Stadium was secured by their 2013/14 player of the season.\n\nHow Arsenal miss him. The Welsh international’s departure to Turin has left a massive hole in Arsenal’s midfield.\n\nOnce described by Steven Gerrard as the best attacking midfielder in the league, “For me, when he’s in that form, he’s the best attacking midfielder in the Premier League.” With sixty-four goals and sixty-five assists for The Gunners, the Juventus midfielder has proven difficult to replace.\n\nNot only for his valuable goal contributions, for instance at the likes of Anfield or AC Milan’s San Siro, but for his leadership and presence in Arsenal’s midfield.\n\nHis significant contributions in Arsenal colours and passion when wearing the shirt were amazing. Twice Arsenal’s player of the season, eleven years of loyalty filled with iconic moments are why he is considered an Arsenal hero, and perhaps even a legend.\n\nHappy Birthday Aaron Ramsey."
