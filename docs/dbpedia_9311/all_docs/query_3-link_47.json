Become a member today\n\nCaerphilly-born Wales captain Aaron Ramsey has opened up a football pitch at Trinity Fields School and Resource Centre.\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder unveiled the ‘Cruyff Court Aaron Ramsey’ alongside the daughter of Dutch legend Johan Cruyff, Susila Cruyff, at the special needs school in Ystrad Mynach on Friday June 23.\n\nThe facility has been built in partnership with Caerphilly County Borough Council and the Aaron Ramsey Foundation with the help of funds raised by players of People’s Postcode Lottery.\n\nThe day began with a press conference which took place on the new pitch. School pupils were given the chance to ask Ramsey and Ms Cruyff questions before taking to the pitch to play a football match.\n\nRamsey said: “Facilities like these give kids the opportunity to dream big and having access to a great place to play is a vital starting point for anyone’s football journey.\n\n“It’s great to see the work that Caerphilly County Borough Council and the Johan Cruyff Foundation are doing to provide sporting facilities for young people. I am really grateful to be here today to open the pitch in my hometown and support Trinity Fields School through the Aaron Ramsey Foundation.”\n\nMs Cruyff, who is a board member of the Johan Cruyff Foundation, added: “We at the Cruyff Foundation are really grateful to Caerphilly County Borough Council and Aaron Ramsey for the role that they’ve played as we open this new safe space for children to play.\n\n“I feel very proud to be here today in Wales and to see how my father’s legacy is still very much alive and expanding in the United Kingdom.”\n\nThe opening of this facility is part of the Cruyff Foundation’s plans to expand the institution’s presence in the United Kingdom by doubling the number of Cruyff Courts by the end of 2023.\n\nCouncillor Sean Morgan, leader of Caerphilly Council, said: “The partnership between the Aaron Ramsey Foundation and Johan Cruyff Foundation will go a long way in promoting the development of sports now and for future generations. It was fantastic to see the sun shining and the children enjoying this new facility today.”\n\nSign-up to our daily newsletter\n\nCaerphilly County Borough Council\n\nCaerphilly County Borough Council"
