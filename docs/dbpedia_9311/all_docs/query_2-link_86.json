        "text": "Aaron Ramsey could retire from international duty after Wales’ failure to reach the Euros this summer.\n\nRob Page’s men were beaten 5-4 on penalties by Poland on Tuesday evening in their playoff final. They had managed to reach the past two finals in the previous editions of the Euros - even reaching the last four in 2016.\n\nFollowing his nation’s heartbreak, it has been suggested that Ramsey could hang up his international boots. According to PA, he will consider his future with Wales before making a definitive decision.\n\nSpeaking after the defeat to Poland, manager Page said: \"There have been no conversations like that [about Ramsey’s future]. It's been, what, an hour since we've ended the game.\n\n“Aaron was a big part of this squad as well. It's not just what he brings on the pitch, it's off the pitch as well. We want to continue to add to the squad and at the right time we'll start introducing the younger ones in.\"\n\nRamsey, an 84-time Welsh international, was named in the latest squad but did not play a single minute. The 33-year-old’s latest dilemma is not the first time his Wales future has been in doubt.\n\nThe current Wales captain hinted that he considered stepping down after Wales’ group stage elimination at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Ramsey only u-turned after a change in management at former club Nice.\n\nSpeaking at the time, he said: “It was a very difficult time after the World Cup. We did so well to finally get to the finals and to experience that, but it was a very strange World Cup.\n\n“I think a lot of things naturally went through your mind afterwards, but after a bit of time to digest it all you're ready to go again. I've come back at club level, we've been doing really well, I've been enjoying my football and I'm playing well. There's a lot to look forward to.\n\nWho will win the Euros? Share your predictions in the comments below\n\n“ Football is forever changing. There'll be opportunities now younger players to step up and show what they're capable of. We'll miss the players who have retired but we’re excited for the future.”\n\nSince then, Ramsey has endured a difficult time of things when it comes to club action. He returned to former club Cardiff in the summer.\n\nInjury has limited him to just nine appearances in all competitions for the Championship side. He did however score three goals in that time including a stunning effort against promotion chasers Leicester at the start of the campaign. Ramsey signed a two-year contract with Cardiff, with the option for a further season."
