        "text": "Cardiff City FC were delighted to announce Aaron Ramsey's return to the Welsh capital on Saturday, 15th July 2023.\n\nWith over 500 career appearances under his belt, Aaron has re-joined his boyhood club on a two-year deal, after competing at the highest levels of world football for over a decade.\n\nAfter coming through the ranks with the Cardiff City Academy, Ramsey became our youngest ever player in April 2007, making his First Team debut aged just 16 years and 123 days – a record that stands to this day.\n\nThe playmaker lifted the Emirates FA Cup on three occasions during his time with Arsenal, scoring the winning goals in the 2014 Final against Hull City and the 2017 Final against Chelsea.\n\nAaron also tasted success in Italy with Juventus, becoming a Serie A champion in 2019/20 and a Coppa Italia winner in 2021. He has also finished as runner-up in the UEFA Europa League on two occasions.\n\nOn the international stage, Ramsey has made 83 appearances for the Wales national team, scoring 20 goals. Aaron was a key member of the team which reached the Semi-Finals of UEFA EURO 2016, and also scored the crucial goals against Hungary which secured Wales’ qualification for UEFA EURO 2020."
