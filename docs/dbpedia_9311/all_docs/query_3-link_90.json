        "text": "One of the early contenders for the footballer of the year award this season is Arsenal’s Aaron Ramsey.\n\nThe Wales midfielder is in the best form of his career. After recovering from a horrific injury, sustained in February 2010, Ramsey has finally nailed a regular place at the Emirates Stadium this season.\n\nHis performances suggest that Ramsey is finally fulfilling his immense potential. He showed it in the early-season matches with three goals in the 5-0 aggregate win over Fenerbahce in a play-off for a place in the Champions League group stage.\n\nRamsey was born on December 27, 1990 in Caerphilly. He started in the youth side at Cardiff, where he stayed for five years.\n\nIn 2006, he played for Cardiff’s first team, staying at Ninian Park for two years.\n\nRamsey made his Cardiff baptism in the last home game of the 2006-07 Champion-ship season, coming on as a late substitute in a 1-0 upset to on April 28, 2007.\n\nIn so doing, Ramsey became the youngest player to appear for Cardiff City’s first team, aged just 16 years and 124 days, beating the previous record holder.\n\nA year later, on June 10, 2008 Cardiff transferred Ramsey to Arsenal for a fee of £4.8 million.\n\nHe made his competitive debut for the Gunners in the Champions League third qualifying round against FC Twente on August 13, 2008 and his first league start a month later against Blackburn.\n\nOn February 27, 2010, disaster struck for the youngster when Arsenal played Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. A poor tackle from Ryan Shawcross caused a double fracture in Ramsey’s right leg.\n\nHe returned to training in October that year and a month later made his Arsenal return against Manchester United in a FA Cup tie which Arsenal lost 2-0.\n\nIn December 2012, it was announced that Ramsey had signed a new long-term contract with the Gunners.\n\nOne of Ramsey’s most crucial goals this season was in Germany last month where Arsenal produced a remarkable Champions League performance to win 1-0 against Borussia Dortmund with the Welshman’s netting putting the London side on the brink of qualification.\n\nRamsey made his debut for Wales U-21 on August 21, 2007 in a 4-3 away win over before his 17th birthday.\n\nHe earned his first cap for the senior side in a friendly against in November 2008, still aged 17. On that occasion he broke the record set by Chris Gunter as the youngest Welsh international.\n\nRamsey was appointed captain of Wales on March 26, 2011. That made him the youngest captain in Wales’s history at the age of 20 years 90 days.\n\nHe scored his first goal as captain in the side’s European Championship qualifier against Northern Ireland on May 27, 2011."
