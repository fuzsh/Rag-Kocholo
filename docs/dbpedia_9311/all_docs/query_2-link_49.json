        "text": "Name :\n\nAaron Ramsey\n\nBorn :\n\nDecember 26, 1990\n\nBirth place :\n\nCaerphilly, Wales\n\nHeight :\n\n5' 10'' (1.78m)\n\nWeight :\n\n70 kg\n\nPosition :\n\nMidfielder\n\nSquad Number :\n\n16\n\nPrevious Club(s) :\n\nCardiff City (loan)\n\nNottingham Forest (loan)\n\nCardiff City\n\nJoined Arsenal :\n\nJune 13, 2008\n\n2008/09\n\nAaron signed for the Club in June after agreeing a long-term contract after his move from Cardiff.\n\n\"I'm so happy to have signed for Arsenal,\" he said. \"I am joining one of the biggest clubs in the world and can't wait to meet my new team mates. I recently met with Arsène Wenger and he was a big factor in my decision to join Arsenal. He talked to me for a long time about the Club and the plans for the future, which really excites me.\"\n\nHe made his debut against FC Twente on August 13 and then made his Premier League bow against Blackburn on September 13.\n\nAaron made his international debut for Wales in November and Arsène Wenger expressed his delight with the start his new signing had made. \"He is always available and doesn’t hide. He has good vision and I believe he will be a very big player in the future.”\n\nFenerbache away in the Champions League on October 21 was the venue for Aaron’s first Arsenal goal and in July 2009 the Welshman signed a new long-term contract at Arsenal.\n\n\"I am very pleased I chose Arsenal last year,\" he said. \"I always knew that Arsenal was the Club for me, they had the best plan for me. They have a history of bringing through youngsters, giving them opportunities and turning them into world-class players.\"\n\n2009/10\n\nWhen you think of Aaron's season it's hard to look past the sickening injury he suffered at Stoke City.\n\nBut it's important to remember the six months that went before that February trip to the Britannia Stadium. During that time Aaron proved that he was ready to make the step up from first-team fringe player to midfield regular.\n\nHe scored his first goal at Emirates Stadium in the first home game of the season and followed that up with two in December - one an absolute beauty at Portsmouth. Throw in a first senior international strike for Wales against Liechtenstein and Aaron had clearly demonstrated his eye for goal.\n\nThe rest of his game developed fast too as Aaron matured with every minute he played. So much so that he bossed large chunks of the Champions League tie at Olympiacos, making Arsenal tick with his precise passing and tireless midfield running.\n\nAaron took his impressive form into the New Year with a vital equaliser at West Ham in the FA Cup but his rapid progress was cruelly checked in February."
