Perhaps that happy medium is to read Kuhn as simply describing science in a more honest (warts and all) manner, rather than in an idealised (or normative) way (as, arguably, Karl Popper did).\n\n(i) Is Thomas Kuhn’s Philosophy of Science “Entirely Political”?\n\n(ii) The Critics of Thomas Kuhn\n\n(iii) John Horgan on Thomas Kuhn: “Absolute Truths” vs “Equal Untruths”\n\n[This essay relies a fair amount on the science journalist John Horgan’s account of his interview with Thomas Kuhn. Horgan’s words can be found in his Scientific American article ‘What Thomas Kuhn Really Thought about Scientific Truth’, as well as in his book The End of Science. The following essay doesn’t tackle Kuhn’s notion of a paradigm.]\n\nIs Kuhn’s Philosophy of Science “Entirely Political”?"
