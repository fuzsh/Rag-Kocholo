        "text": "In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn wrote, \"Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science.\" Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time, as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a \"paradigm shift\" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognize such a paradigm shift. Being in the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science. Philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it. Kuhn's original model is now generally seen as too limited. Society has experience change in all its facets, social issues are changing continually, while the people battle to adapt and absorb, there are still more and many more questions left unanswered. Kuhn was able to notice the social change that was going on and gave a pragmatic approach to it. In conclusion paradigm shift is applicable to sociology, on the basis that all aspects of sociology are experiencing a shift from what used to be to what is obtainable."
