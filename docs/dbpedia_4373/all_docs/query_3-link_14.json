        "text": "The I-5 Woodburn Interchange is located along I-5 at OR 214 and OR 219 (Hillsboro-Silverton Highway NE) in Woodburn, Oregon, 30 miles south of Portland and 19 miles north of Salem, providing access to Silverton, Mt Angel and Molalla to the east, and St. Paul and Newberg to the west. The $75 million project improves traffic flow, congestion and safety conditions around the interchange area by providing two new loop ramps, four rebuilt on and off-ramps, a new and wider bridge over I-5, and additional lanes on OR 214 and 219. The project also features a new transit/park-and-ride facility with electric vehicle charging stations, expanded sidewalks and bicycle lanes, and numerous aesthetic enhancements.\n\nFunding for the project included an $8 million City of Woodburn contribution drawn from traffic impact fees collected citywide, as well as revenues generated from a new interchange development charge (IDC) passed by the City in April 2008. The IDC covers all new development that occurs within a designated interchange development area. This charge is levied within a zone deemed to benefit from the interchange. An IDC ordinance established under ORS 223.297- 223.314 defines the framework for levying development charges by local governments and requires that development within the IDC boundary will both create a larger impact on the interchange and receive greater benefits than development outside of the zone."
