        "text": "The whole staff here are amazing people and great at what they do. Big Shout out to the whole crew that I got to know very well over 3 1/2 months. Jacque, Janelly, Melissa, Adrian, Chaz and of course Doctor Matt, y’all are rockstars and great people. Thank you for all the hospitality and great care. 10/10 I’ll be back just to see how they’re all doing every once in a while. All love for the Woodburn Accident Care Crew🫶🤙-Trav\n\nIf I could leave a 1000 I would! Everyone at this location is amazing,friendly,welcoming! Jackie an Janelly always great me with such kindness ❤️ than I had to bring my 2 year old an oh boy they jumped right in to help so I was able to get the care I needed. Melissa always knows right were to massage to help make your pain go away. Dr. Matt is so kind an easy to talk to he can get you in an out feeling amazing 👏 an well heard! Thank you for being such an amazing team! 👏\n\nThis company is more then amazing. Dr. Fryauf is so kind and helpful. The ladies there were the sweetest. Always cared for there patients and tried there best to make sure there patients were comfortable and safe. Not only are they amazing hut my mom and I appreciate such hard work they do to make the visits go by fast but also work on the key components to get you feeling better. Much appreciated and loved by all. Thank you so much for everything. 💜🙏💜🙏💜\n\nI can't say enough how much Dr. Matt Fryauf, Dr. Nguyen, and Blanca have helped my wife and I. Probably the best thing I can say about Dr. Fryauf is how he listens. Usually several times during each of my sessions with him he will ask me if there's anything else I want to talk about. He really makes sure that my needs are met and this directly translates into the care he needs to give me.Dr. Nguyen has a very upbeat personality and is very pleasant to talk to...right up to the point of the physical therapy. At that point she turns into a drill instructor to make sure I am doing all my exercises and doing them correctly. Sad to say, I need this kind of motivation, ha.And then there's Blanca the massage therapist. She is simply AMAZING!! She starts off each session asking what areas I am having issues with to make sure she hits them all. She has found areas that hurt that I didn't even know where injured. Blanca really connects with her patients and is such an essential, and bright part of the healing process with her bubbly personality.\n\nI’ve never had a massage before and let me tell you it was awesome. I feel so much better and I can move around more, my work consists of constant physical labor so I really need my back and my neck to not give me such a hard time. I would recommend this place, they’re all very welcoming and super friendly!\n\nThis was my first visit ever to a Chiropractor and I will admit I was a little nervous, but everyone was friendly and made me feel comfortable. Dr. John was awesome! He explained everything to me and I felt confident they were going to help with my discomfort! I am happy to say, the areas that where affected by my accident are improving, thanks to their help. I have been getting treated with adjustments, massages, exercises and muscle stimulators. What i also like is that they are always flexible with appointment scheduling. The front desk receptionist/massage therapist Blanca is kind, professional and courteous. Would definitely recommend!"
