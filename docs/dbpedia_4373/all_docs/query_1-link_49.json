        "text": "Woodburn Solar Power Information & Peak Sun Hours\n\nSolar Green Energy Summary for Woodburn, Indiana\n\nLattitude: 41.1287\n\nSunlight\n\nFixed Tilt Sunlight Hours: 4.3 hours per day\n\n1-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 5.4 hours per day\n\n2-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 5.6 hours per day\n\nPeak sun hours is one of the most important criteria to examine when considering installing a solar power system. Peak sun hours are different than total sunlight hours in a day because the strength of the radiation of the sun varies throughout the day. For example, during sunrise and sunset the solar insolation from the sun is less powerful than at noon. For a moment of sunshine to be considered a peak sun hour the intensity needs to be at least 1 kilowatt per square meter. This means that a square meter of your solar panel should be receiving 1 kilowatt of energy from the sun. This number is used because it is an amount of light that allows a solar panel to produce output efficiently and not under perform due to lack of sunlight power.\n\nAlthough you can easily predict sunrise and sunset hours each day to the minute, looking at latitude can help with your solar planning. The closer you get to the equator the closer your latitude gets to zero. Sunlight hours on the equator are consistent throughout the entire year. Places further from the equator can have large variance in daily sunlight. For example higher latitudes can have very long summer days with lots of sunlight and very dark winters. The latitude of Woodburn is 41.1.\n\nYou will notice that the average peak sun hours for Woodburn change based on the type of panel being used. The reason for this is quite simple. A fixed panel does exactly what it sounds like, remains fixed in one position at all times. A 1-axis and 2-axis panels have axis that allow them to rotate. The 1-axis rotates with the sun's daily east to west movement while a 2-axis also adjusts for seasonal changes.\n\nThe sunrise and sunset is very predictable every day, but things like cloud coverage and weather are less predictable and vary daily and annually. If a location that is usually very sunny experiences a huge increase in storms and cloud coverage in a given year than the average peak sun hours for that day or year will probably decrease. Tall objects such as trees and buildings can block out the sun during high solar insolation times, so be sure to strategically place your solar panels to get better efficiency.\n\nThe average daily peak sunlight hours in Woodburn, Indiana is 4.3 hours. Use this number when trying to calculate your solar needs in Woodburn. As you can see above, if you were to use a 1-Axis or 2-Axis panel then the daily average would increase to 5.4 hour and 5.6 hours, respectively.\n\nSolar Businesses in Woodburn, Indiana\n\nBe the first to hear about the latest green energy news, technology and offers.\n\n[mc4wp_form id=\"2942\"]\n\nBy providing your email you consent to receiving occasional promotional emails & newsletters.\n\nNo Spam.
