Maybe you're shopping, maybe you're touring the Oregon Electric Railway Museum or maybe you're hanging out at Centennial Park. Wherever you happen to be, there's only one place to help you satisfy that hunger, and that's your Woodburn Red Robin. Located on Sprague Lane, you'll find over 25 Gourmet Burgers to choose from; including our new Lava Queso, the Monster, The Southern Charm, our Cheesy Bacon Fondue and our fan fave Whiskey River® BBQ. Any of these burgers pair perfectly with our iconic Bottomless Steak Fries®."
