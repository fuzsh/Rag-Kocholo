Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Woodburn is essentially constant during July, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 12, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Woodburn is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 4.3 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on December 2, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.1 miles per hour, while on August 8, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 4.2 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Woodburn throughout July is predominantly from the north, with a peak proportion of 50% on July 20.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nWoodburn is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Woodburn is essentially constant during July, remaining around 58Â°F throughout.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Woodburn typically lasts for 7.3 months (225 days), from around March 28 to around November 8, rarely starting before February 21 or after April 28, and rarely ending before October 15 or after December 5.\n\nThe month of July in Woodburn is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in Woodburn\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in Woodburngrowing seasongrowing seasongrowing seasonJul11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303031310%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%JunAug100%Jul 16100%Jul 16Jul 24100%Jul 24100%NowNowcoldcoolcomfortablewarmhot\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Woodburn are rapidly increasing during July, increasing by 521Â°F, from 813Â°F to 1,334Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Woodburn is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.1 kWh of 7.2 kWh throughout.\n\nThe highest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during July is 7.4 kWh on July 15.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Woodburn are 45.144 deg latitude, -122.855 deg longitude, and 184 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Woodburn is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 85 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 178 feet. Within 10 miles is essentially flat (873 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (5,669 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Woodburn is covered by cropland (54%) and artificial surfaces (46%), within 10 miles by cropland (89%) and artificial surfaces (11%), and within 50 miles by trees (42%) and cropland (28%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Woodburn, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Woodburn.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Woodburn according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Woodburn is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Woodburn and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nAurora State Airport (KUAO, 56%, 8 mi, northeast, 10 ft elevation change)\n\nMc Minnville Municipal Airport (KMMV, 26%, 14 mi, west, -26 ft elevation change)\n\nMcNary Field (KSLE, 18%, 18 mi, southwest, 20 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Woodburn and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
