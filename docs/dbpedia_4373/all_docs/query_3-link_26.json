The location is excellent, not crowded, and it is easy to get to it. I highly recommend this location for CT scans.\n\nHappy Patient\n\nA Fine Needle Biopsy is intimidating to any patient. The team at Fairfax Radiology did a great job with humor and quality care!\n\nHappy Patient\n\nExcellent experience. The staff is quick, knowledgeable, and thorough, while still being friendly and compassionate. They specialize in more difficult and detailed scans, which is what I needed. I highly recommend Fairfax Radiology when it comes to more complex needs.\n\nHappy Patient\n\nProfessional, caring, extremely competent and friendly. We always feel comfortable and know we are in good hands.\n\nHappy Patient\n\nA diagnostic test that focuses on the extremities and spine and is used to help diagnose the cause of pains or symptoms or to get a snapshot of any progress from an earlier treatment."
