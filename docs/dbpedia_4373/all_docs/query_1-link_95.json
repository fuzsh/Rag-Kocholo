It is seasonal, becoming a waterfall around October rains and completely drying up by the end of June or early July. Despite its being seasonal, it is the only waterfall in Lacamas Lake Park that is not controlled by a dam, making the water flow 100% natural.\n\nWoodburn Falls (Northwest Waterfall Survey)\n\nContributors"
