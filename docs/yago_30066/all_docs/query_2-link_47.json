        "text": "Maria Carolina of Austria, Queen of Naples and Sicily, died of a sudden stroke in Vienna on this day, September 8th, in 1814. She was 62 years old, and was the last surviving of the 16 children of Maria Theresa and Francis I.\n\nShe was in exile after Napoleon conquored Naples, and shortly before her death she wrote this letter to her daughter, Maria Cristina:\n\n“Nothing on earth moves me any more; my fate was settled and decided the day that I was chased like a play-actress and thrust out of Sicily…. My life is ended in this world…. I am no longer interesting except to a few old women who never stir out of their own doors, but who come to see the last of the great Maria Theresa’s children. The Prater is in its lovely green and full of flowers; but nothings seems beautiful to me any longer.”\n\nTo quote the book In Destiny’s Hands: Five Tragic Rulers, Children of Maria Theresa by Justin C. Vovk:\n\nThe body of Queen Maria Carolina of Naples and Sicily, dressed in a black taffeta gown, veil, lace cap, and silver fabric shoes, was taken to lie in state before the funeral. The Baroness du Montet described her visit to the Queen’s memorial on Sept 10:\n\nIn the Queen’s last sleep there is a trace of sadness, of infinite weariness. Maria Carolina, who thought she would die in Naples, had her portrait set up on a tomb in the Capuchin convent in Vienna together with a tender and moving inscription, a gentle testimony of the poor lady’s desire to be buried near her august parents. A sensitive but vain precaution, since the Queen’s mortal remains have been buried on the spot.\n\nMaria Carolina was indeed buried in the Imperial Crypt with her ancestors, in Tomb 107. After her death, Napoleon wrote to his brother Joseph saying “That woman knew how to think and act like a queen, while preserving her rights and her dignity….”.\n\nJust nine months after her death, her husband was restored to the throne."
