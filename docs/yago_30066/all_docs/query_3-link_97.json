        "text": "Maria Carolina of Austria? Which one is she?Â She married her cousin, another Archduke named Ranier. Wikipedia has nothing about her and, besides some information provided by Minnie with this image, I couldn't find out anything about her anywhere until I checked again when I saw Paul Frecker had this photo.Â Paul Frecker has this biographical sketch, \"Archduchess Maria Carolina Luise Christine, Princess Imperial and Archduchess of Austria, Princess Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, was born in Vienna on 10 September 1825, the sixth child of Archduke Albrecht, who was himself the eldest son of Archduke Karl, Duke von Teschen. On 21 February 1852 she married Archduke Rainer of Austria (1827-1913). She died at Baden on 17 July 1915.âÂ Wikipediaâs article for her is here and they have an article for her husbandÂ who was Austrian PM. Their marriage was happy, but childless."
