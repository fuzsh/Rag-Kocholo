        "text": "The Imperial couple had three more children:\n\n* date of birth\n\nMaria Theresia * 13th May 1717\n\nMaria Anna * 26th September 1718\n\nMaria Amalia * 5th April 1724\n\nMaria Theresia was the second child of Karl VI and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. She was born in the Imperial Residence in Vienna (Hofburg) in the early morning of the 13th May 1717, and was baptised Maria Theresia Walburga Amalia Christina in the evening of the same day.\n\nHer aunt Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and grandmother Eleonor Magdalene of the Palatinate-Neuburg were her godmothers.\n\nKarl had placed his nieces behind his daughter in the line of succession so his daughter immediately became heiress presumptive to the Habsburg Hereditary Lands.\n\nThe young Archduchess was a very pretty little girl and she had an adequate but not very thorough education. Her spelling and punctuation was not too good, and she had problems speaking in a formal manner and preferred speaking Viennese German.\n\nIn the meantime Maria Theresia had become very fond of the nine-year older Franz Stephan (Francis Stephen of Lorraine).\n\nIn 1729, Franz Stephan ascended the throne of Lorraine, but had to wait until 1736 before he was formally promised Maria Theresia's hand.\n\nOn the 31st January 1736, Franz Stephan was obliged to sign the declaration of renunciation of the Duchy of Lorraine and comply with the demands of France that he should exchange his Duchy for the right of succession to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.\n\nAt first he hesitated and laid the quill on the table a few times before finally signing the document as he was confronted with the choice of \"No signature - No Archduchess\"\n\nMaria Theresia and Franz Stephan of Lorraine married on the 12th February 1736 in the Augustinian Church in Vienna. He and his wife became the founders of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty.\n\nFranz Stephan was officially joint ruler of the Habsburg Hereditary Lands. However, in reality he was merely the prince consort and had very little say in the affairs of state.\n\nHe was not unimportant, he just happened to be married to a famous woman.\n\nThe nineteen-year-old Maria Theresia was deeply in love with Franz Stephan and during his absences wrote many letters in which she expressed her eagerness to see him, whereas Franz Stephan wrote letters which were in comparison very formal.\n\nFranz Stephan was not averse to extramarital amusements and had several affairs. He had to be very discreet and was under the constant observation of his very jealous wife who, for her part, tried to give him very few opportunities, and his infidelity became a tremendous problem during their marriage.\n\nThe sexual morality of the Imperial Court of Vienna during the 18th century was one-sided. Mistresses were not unknown, and infidelity was common amongst men but frowned upon for female members of the Imperial family who were expected to comply with the rigid moral standards of the day.\n\nIn 1745, Franz Stephan was able to emerge from the shadow of his wife and was elected Holy Roman Emperor, Franz I.\n\nThe Imperial Couple\n\nFranz Stephan was a financial wizard and managed to amass a large private fortune.\n\nHe purchased estates in Lower Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, and Moravia, and he created a very profitable industrial empire by building textile and pottery factories. He was able to give financial support to the State, and he himself benefited from the modernisation and the resulting needs of the Austrian army.\n\nThese assets gave his son and successor Joseph II the means to settle the debts caused by the wars.\n\nKarlV1 died on the 20th October 1740 at the Favorita Palace in Vienna, probably as a result of mushroom poisoning.\n\nAfter the death of her father, Archduchess Maria Theresia became; Sovereign of Hungary and Bohemia, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, of Slavonia, of Galicia, of Lodomeria, etc.; Archduchess of Austria; Duchess of Burgundy, of Styria, of Carinthia and of Carniola; Grand Princess of Transylvania; Margravine of Moravia; Duchess of Brabant, of Limburg, of Luxemburg, of Guelders, of Württemberg, of Upper and Lower Silesia, of Milan, of Mantua, of Parma, of Piacenza, of Guastalla, of Auschwitz and of Zator; Princess of Swabia; Princely Countess of Habsburg, of Flanders, of Tyrol, of Hainault, of Kyburg, of Gorizia and of Gradisca; Margravine of Burgau, of Upper and Lower Lusatia; Countess of Namur; Lady of the Wendish Mark and of Mechlin; Duchess of Lorraine and Bar, Grand Duchess of Tuscany.\n\nKarl VI had left a weakened army and during the last years of his reign the financial situation within his domains was in a poor state. He had not taken the time to introduce his daughter into the workings of the affairs of state because he presumed she would hand the ruling of her dominions to her husband.\n\nAfter her accession to the throne, the twenty-three year old Maria Theresia made her husband co-ruler of the Austrian and Bohemian Lands, but it took over a year before Hungary accepted Franz Stephan as co-ruler.\n\nThe Austrian Succession War broke out shortly after Maria Theresia ascended the throne because the neighbouring powers refused to accept the principles of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, which it turned out to be nothing more than a useless piece of paper, but it thrust Maria Theresia into the thick of European politics. Maria Theresia was suddenly forced to defend her inheritance against Prussia, Bavaria, France, Poland, Saxony and Spain.\n\nDuring the next twenty years, Maria Theresia fought two major wars and gave birth to sixteen children.\n\nThe first three children were girls and the Imperial couple had to wait until 1741 before the first boy was born, and by this time Maria Theresia was fighting to preserve her inheritance. Three of her children were born before the Austrian Succession War began, and five children were born during the peace between the Austrian Succession War and the Seven Years War. She was pregnant or shall we say child-bearing throughout the Austrian Succession War and gave birth to her last child at the age of thirty-nine in 1756 at the beginning of the Seven Years War.\n\nMaria Theresia was definitely a good mother and treated her children well, but at the same time she saw them as political pawns in a dynastic game and soon started negotiations regarding the future marriages of the Imperial children. These talks were held in conjunction with those needed to keep up the war effort and all other affairs of state.\n\nArchduke Joseph Benedikt Anton Michael Adam was born on the 13th March 1741, and died on the 20th February 1790.\n\nMaria Theresia had already given birth to three daughters, two of whom had already died, so when she gave birth to her first-born son Joseph his birth was a great event and was duly celebrated by the Imperial family.\n\nIn 1764, Joseph was elected King of the Holy Roman Empire and in 1765, after the sudden death of his father he succeeded to the throne becoming Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. His mother remained responsible for the affairs of State and procedures made in regard to the Habsburg crown-lands and other important decisions.\n\nJoseph's first wife Isabella of Parma, whom he loved passionately, died of smallpox about three years after their marriage.\n\nJoseph acted as co-regent of the Habsburg dynasty together with Maria Theresia until her death in 1780.\n\nIn 1765, he married Maria Josepha of Bavaria, which was more of a political marriage than one born out of love.\n\nMaria Josepha died during an outbreak of smallpox in 1767.\n\nDuring the co-regency, and after Maria Theresia's death, Joseph continued the reforms along the lines pursued by his mother. Compared to his mother Joseph was more ideological, less flexible and often less successful. However, he managed to balance Austria's finances, reorganise the army, and made secure Austria's position in Europe.\n\nArchduchess Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna was born on the 2nd November 1755, and died on the 16th October 1793.\n\nMaria Antonia (Marie Antoinette) married the Dauphin (crown prince) of France in 1770.\n\nFour years later when her husband was crowned King Louis XVI (House of Bourbon) she became Queen of France. Marie Antoinette and Louis were confronted with the political and social changes taking place in France during the 18th century.\n\nIn 1792, the royal family were accused of high treason and imprisoned.\n\nIn 1789, a mob of revolutionists (The Women's March to Versailles) forced its way into the Palace of Versailles demanding that the royal family be removed to the Tuilerie Palace in Paris where the King and Queen were virtual prisoners.\n\nMarie Antoinette sought help from other European rulers including her brother the Austrian Emperor Joseph II and her sister Maria Caroline, Queen of Naples.\n\nKing Louis and his family attempted to flee France but were recognised and brought back to Paris.\n\nAustria and Prussia declared war on France and Marie Antoinette was accused of passing military secrets to the enemy.\n\nOn the 21st January 1793, Louis XVI was convicted of treason and executed on the guillotine.\n\nMarie Antoinette suffered much during her final weeks of imprisonment.\n\nThe revolutionists took her children away from her and her best friend, the Princess de Lambelle, was killed and her severed head was put on a pole and paraded in front of the Queen's prison window.\n\nMarie Antoinette followed her husband to the guillotine on the 16th October 1793.\n\nArchduke Maximilian Franz Xaver Joseph Johann Anton de Paula Wenzel was born on the 8th December 1756, and died on the 26th July 1801.\n\nMaximilian Franz became Archbishop-Elector of Cologne in 1784.\n\nA keen patron of music, Maximilian Franz maintained and played an important role in the early career of Ludwig van Beethoven.\n\nIn October and November 1794, during the Napoleonic Wars, Cologne and Bonn were occupied by the French and Maximilian Franz left Bonn and the Archbishop's court was dissolved.\n\nIn later life he resided at Hetzendorf Palace in Vienna.\n\nHe suffered from ill-health and put on an enormous amount of weight.\n\nBeethoven visited him shortly before his death in Vienna and planned to dedicate his First Symphony to his former patron, but Maximilian Franz died before it was completed."
