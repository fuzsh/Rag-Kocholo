In the organizer's words:

BEST OF 25 YEARS

"FOREVER JAN (25 Jahre Jan Delay)" packs these 25 years into the most comprehensive compilation possible - and, despite all the stylistic diversity, above all makes the common thread of this extraordinary career recognizable in every respect. Jan Delay is an icon of German pop. He has inspired entire generations to listen to their raveheart and consistently do their thing. But above all, he has always remained a fan. Anyone who has shared a dancefloor with Jan at five o'clock in the morning or discussed the latest Soundso record with him, indeed anyone who has experienced him on stage even once, knows what music means to him, how it drives him, how it defines his work. The beats, the bass, the whole shebang: that's Jan Delay's element. And he has always transferred this passion very directly into his own projects.

Whether as a young man he found a refuge in the old soul of roots reggae when the German rap hype became too colorful for him and the mood in the country dark. Whether he gave his original form of dance music to the land of body bangers and movementbertas (and a new career for himself). Whether he translated his personal enthusiasm for great guitar music into his very own version of Rock On & On & On. Or whether he threw together all his influences - rap and reggae, funk and soul, Udo and Dr. Dre, Hamburg and the world - and just vibed away: Jan Delay took fire and created new fire.

In summer 2024, JAN DELAY will go on a big "Best of 25 Years" summer tour with his phenomenal band DISKO No.1.
