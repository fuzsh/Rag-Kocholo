        "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is associated with the emergence of a number of behavioral and emotional disorders that may last lifelong. It is critical to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders[1]. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) Existing ASL techniques generally have a coarse spatial resolution of ∼4×4×4mm3, making it difficult to decompose structural and functional components of developmental effects due to partial volume effects; and 2) The recommended segmented 3D acquisition[2] takes relatively long scan time and generally allows a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan, which is susceptible to age dependent variations in arterial transit time (ATT), affecting the accuracy of perfusion quantification. Multi-delay ASL can provide improved accuracy for quantitative measurement of both CBF and ATT compared to single-delay ASL[3]. However, it needs to divide the total scan time to acquire multiple delays and thus sacrificing SNR of each delay, which makes acquiring high-resolution multi-delay ASL images even more challenging.\n\nIn order to achieve robust high-resolution multi-delay ASL, accelerated image acquisition/reconstruction and denoising techniques are desired, which may be applied separately or jointly through denoising-reconstruction techniques. Compressed Sensing [4] is a widely used technique, which uses L1 wavelet or total variation (TV) regularizer for denoising and reconstruction. In another previous study[5], the authors proposed a robust single-shot acquisition of multi-delay ASL with time dependent CAIPIRINHA under-sampling pattern and spatiotemporal reconstruction with total generalized variation (TGV) regularization. However, these methods require predefined constraints for optimization, and generally take a relatively long time for image reconstruction due to iterative optimization steps. Another way to denoise multi-delay ASL images is to use k-space weighted image average (KWIA)[6], which divides the k-space into multiple rings and applies a progressively wider temporal window for moving average of peripheral k-space data to reduce noise. This method does not require predefined constraints or iterations, and preserves the spatiotemporal resolution of the original image series. However, the image noise becomes temporally correlated following KWIA denoising, resulting in little improvement on the fitting results, i.e., CBF and ATT maps[6].\n\nDeep learning (DL) provides a powerful tool for medical image processing[7]. DL has been applied for ASL denoising [8], [9], [10], [11] with either CNN or Transformer-based networks. DL methods can process noisy images efficiently and effectively once the model has been trained. However, training a DL model usually relies on paired images with a low-SNR image as input and a high-SNR image as the reference. This makes it hard to apply to cases where there are limited or no high-SNR images acquired, especially for a high-resolution dataset where acquiring such a reference image is very time-consuming. While using an existing pretrained model may in part help with this issue, the performance of the model may decline on a new dataset with different data distribution such as different image contrast or different image resolution, and usually fine-tuning of the pretrained model is warranted.\n\nIn this work, we first developed a high-resolution (iso-2mm) multi-delay ASL imaging protocol for pediatric perfusion imaging. We further proposed a DL denoising framework for multi-delay ASL with KWIA denoised images as reference. We trained and tested the performance of the proposed DL model on a cohort of 21 typically developing children aged 8 to 17 years-old with test and retest scans. The proposed method was compared with several benchmark methods including TGV regularized reconstruction, KWIA and a pretrained Swin Transformer.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are summarized as following:\n\nWe developed a high-resolution multi-delay ASL protocol for pediatric perfusion imaging, which was applied in children with test-retest scans to evaluate the performance of different methods;\n\nWe proposed a novel DL framework for multi-delay ASL denoising where there are no acquired reference images to train the model;\n\nWe used a CNN and Swin Transformer combined network in our network to improve the performance of denoising;\n\nOur proposed method was compared with state-of-the art methods including non-DL methods (KWIA, TGV) and different DL strategies (train-from-scratch, fine-tune and direct apply).\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nA. ASL acquisition with CAIPIRINHA acceleration and TGV reconstruction\n\nThe recommended acquisition for ASL according to the consensus paper[2] is to use a segmented 3D readout. In a recent study[5], the authors used a modified segmented 3D GRASE readout with a time dependent 2D CAIPIRINHA[12] pattern to improve SNR and robustness for acquiring multi-delay pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) images with iso-3mm resolution. In this work, we expanded the previous work with a higher acceleration factor to achieve high resolution (iso-2mm) multi-delay pCASL. The under-sampling pattern for each measurement is depicted in . A total of 8 segments with an acceleration factor of 2 in the phase encoding (PE) (y) direction and 4 in the partition (z) direction were used in the readout to shorten the length of each echo train. There were shifts between subsequent control/label pair both in the PE and partition direction to increase temporal incoherence and reduce aliasing artifacts for reconstruction. There are several advantages for this pattern. First, it enables the estimation of coil sensitivity maps directly from the combined k-space without the need to acquire a separate calibration data, like regular GRAPPA-type reconstruction. Second, this pattern is more robust to motion artifacts compared to the standard segmented acquisition[5]. Third, it enables the options to reconstruct the image with either parallel imaging techniques for each segment or direct inverse Fourier Transform of the segment-combined k-space.\n\nAs the baseline processing pipeline for this type of under-sampled acquisition, a spatiotemporal TGV constrained reconstruction was applied to the k-space data for each PLD. The reconstruction solves the following optimization equation:\n\nc⋆,l⋆∈argminc,lλc2Kc-dc22+λl2Kl-dl22+γ1(w)TGVa1,a0,β(l)+γ1(w)TGVa1α1,β(c)+γ2(w)TGVα1,a0,β(c-l)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c and l are control and label images for one PLD, K is the forward encoding matrix, including coil sensitivity profile, Fourier operation and under-sampling pattern masking, dc and dl are the acquired k space data for control and label respectively. λc and λl are weights to balance the data consistency term. α0, α1 and β are TGV reconstruction parameters according to[13] and γ1(w), γ2(w) are the weights to balance the regularization for control, label, and perfusion images. The TGV regularizer enforces piece-wise smooth images for both control/label and the perfusion image.\n\nThe TGV constrained reconstruction method can improve the SNR of the reconstructed perfusion images. However, the reconstruction is time-consuming and has high demand in GPU memory as it takes the k-space data with multiple coils and multiple time points into the reconstruction algorithm.\n\nB. KWIA denoising for multi-delay ASL\n\nK-space weighted image average (KWIA) is a denoising technique originally proposed for computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging to reduce X-ray radiation dose [14] and later adapted to denoising dynamic MRI series such as MR angiography and multi-delay ASL[6].\n\nKWIA performs denoising of an image within a time series by first dividing the whole k-space into several ring-shaped sub-k-space. The central k-space region uses original data to preserve the image contrast and temporal resolution, and the outer k-space is weighted averaged among neighboring time frames to increase SNR while preserving spatial resolution. The weighting for the averaged k-space is adjusted according to the number of neighboring time frames to be averaged. The KWIA processed k-space data can be described by the following equation:\n\nFKWIA(kx,ky,t′)=∑t=t′−(N−1)t=t′+(N−1)WKWIA(kx,ky,t,t′)F(kx,ky,t)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere FKWIA and F denotes the k-space data after and before denoising respectively, and WKWIA denotes the weight for the averaged rings. illustrates the processes of applying KWIA with 2 rings to 5-delay ASL data.\n\nThe main idea of this method is based on that most of the image contrast and temporal information is stored in the low-frequency part of the k-space while the image resolution and fine details are determined by the extent of the k-space coverage. Therefore, averaging the outer rings while keeping the center k-space unchanged can improve the SNR while preserving the spatiotemporal resolution and contrast of the original image series.\n\nThe advantage of KWIA is that it can be easily implemented without complicated computation. It also does not cause much spatial blurring to the image like some traditional denoising methods such as Gaussian filtering. However, although theoretically KWIA can improve the SNR of each time frame image by about 2 folds, the results for quantitative fitting show little improvements since KWIA induces temporally correlated noise, thus does not help when all images are used for fitting[6]. As a result, KWIA can only improve the SNR and better delineation of image details for each time frame, but not improve the quantitative mapping.\n\nC. Deep Learning denoising for ASL\n\nDuring the past decades, there have been several studies trying to denoise ASL images with deep learning methods. CNN-based networks with both regular and dilated convolutions have been developed to denoise for perfusion weighted images[8] or directly to the CBF maps[10]. A multi-contrast model that uses both M0 and perfusion images was used to further improve the denoising performance[9]. Recently, Swin Transformer-based networks that use window attention mechanism and window shifting techniques have been developed for image restoration tasks[15], [16] and was adapted to denoising both single and multi-delay ASL images[11] to beat the performance of the regular CNN-based networks.\n\nThese methods used a noisy image as the input and trained a model to produce an image with higher SNR. This is usually achieved by using a reference high-SNR image averaged with more repetitions than the input. In clinical settings, single-delay ASL is usually acquired with a relatively low-resolution and repeated multiple times to achieve a reasonable image quality. This averaged image can be used as the reference for denoising an image with fewer averages, thus reducing the scan time. However, since the SNR of MR images reduces with smaller voxel size, it would take longer scan time to achieve similar SNR for high-resolution acquisitions. Especially for multi-delay ASL, they are usually acquired with only a few or even only one repetition for each delay and therefore, no high-SNR images can be used as reference. In this case, the traditional supervised learning settings cannot be directly applied to train a model for denoising such high-resolution multi-delay ASL.\n\nGiven some desirable features of KWIA denoising including its computational efficiency and contrast preserving, and that it does not cause much spatial blurring, in this study, we proposed a Transformer based DL framework for denoising high-resolution multi-delay ASL using KWIA denoised images as reference. We show that the trained model can outperform KWIA in not only the SNR of the perfusion images, but also the SNR of the parametric maps (CBF and ATT).\n\nD. Pretrained model\n\nExisting works of DL ASL denoising usually trained a new model on a specific dataset. However, in recent years, pretrained models have shown to be powerful especially in the case where there are not sufficient training data[17], [18], [19]. In general, a pretrained model is developed on a larger dataset with a more general task, which can be then applied to specific downstream tasks with fine-tuning. It has been shown that the pretrained model can provide a better starting point and need less time for training. But whether the performance of fine-tuning and training from scratch will differ is not clear, especially for a specific task such as ASL denoising.\n\nIn this study, besides training a new model from scratch, we also tried to utilize a pretrained model for lower resolution single-delay ASL denoising. We compared the performance of directly applying the pretrained model, training a new model from scratch and fine-tuning a pretrained denoising.\n\nIII. MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nA. Imaging Protocol and Datasets\n\nIn this study, we developed a high-resolution multi-delay ASL protocol with 8-fold 2D CAIPI acceleration. Twenty-one typically developing children (age=13±2.5 years, 13 males) without neurological/psychiatric disorders or development delays were recruited under IRB approval. All subjects were scanned twice with two weeks apart for test-retest purposes on a 3T MR system (Prisma, Siemens Healthcare, Germany) using a 32-channel head coil. The multi-delay ASL images were acquired with the proposed scheme, along with a separate T1w MPRAGE scan (1 mm3 isotropic) and a phase contrast MRA.\n\nA time-dependent CAIPI under-sampling pattern with 8 segments was employed for each post labeling delay (PLD) for the multi-delay ASL protocol[5]. The complete imaging protocol is shown as follows: TR = 6180ms, TE = 52.5ms, FOV = 192×192×96 mm3, resolution of 2×2×2 mm3, matrix size of 96×96×48. A phase contrast MRA image was acquired before ASL and the labeling plane was placed at a straight segment of intracranial arteries and vertebral arteries to improve labeling efficiency. Labeling duration = 1500ms and 5 PLDs (600, 1000, 1400, 1800 and 2200ms) were used considering shorter ATT in younger populations[20]. Background suppression with 2 inversion pulses was used and optimized for each PLD[21]. The scan duration for this multi-delay ASL was 8 minutes and 33 seconds. This will result in a complete measurement (1 control and 1 label image) for each delay if averaging all segments, or 8 measurements if each segment is reconstructed respectively. Segment-combined images were used as the input for denoising. The above acquisition results in a dataset that contains a total of 42 scans with 5 delays and a total of 10080 slices.\n\nB. Network architecture\n\nBoth the pretrained model and the train-from-scratch model used a combined CNN and Swin Transformer[15], [16] network as the network architecture to perform ASL denoising. The network architecture is shown in .\n\nThe input layer takes the center and two adjacent slices of the image so the input size would be H×W×3. The first layer is a CNN layer that combines the pseudo3D input and extracts some shallow features of the image. The next few layers are Swin Transformer layers, which consist of several Swin Transformer blocks with a residual connection in each layer. The Swin Transformer layer is consisted of a multi-head self-attention and a two-layer multi-delay perceptron (MLP), with a layer normalization (LN) before each module and a residual connection. In two consecutive Swin Transformer layers, the first layer uses a regular windowed Transformer layer, and the second layer performs window shifting and takes the shifted windows into the Transformer operation. The computation of two consecutive Swin Transformer layers can be expressed as\n\nzˆl=W-MSALNzl-1+zl-1,zl=MLPLNzˆl+zˆl,zˆl+1=SW-MSALNzl+zl,zl+1=MLPLNzˆl+1+zˆl+1,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere zˆl and zl denote the outputs of the Shifted Window or regular MSA module and the MLP module for block l respectively. The last layer of the Swin Transformer block is a CNN layer, which brings the benefit of inductive bias of the convolution operation to improve the performance of regular Transformer operation.\n\nThe last layer of the whole network is a CNN layer to combine the features and produce the final denoised image. The output was 1-channel with the size of H×W and the loss function was computed with the output and the KWIA denoised image of that center slice.\n\nC. Implementation details\n\n1) TGV constrained reconstruction\n\nTGV reconstruction algorithm was implemented in MATLAB with CUDA parallel processing using AVIONIC library[13]. Coil sensitivity maps were estimated using the segment-combined control images. The hyperparameters for the TGV optimization were chosen according to the preliminary experiments[5], where α0=3,α1=1,w=0.9 and β=7. Regularization parameters λc=10 and λl=1.06×λc. For each PLD, 8 paired under-sampled k-space of control and label images were input to the algorithm and the output were 8 paired control, label and perfusion images. The average of the 8 output perfusion images were used as the final results for TGV reconstruction. (The reconstruction was run on a lambda cluster with NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU and the algorithm took 126±1 seconds for each PLD.)\n\n2) KWIA denoising for multi-delay ASL\n\nKWIA algorithm was implemented in MATLAB. A two-ring KWIA with the ratio of the centric circle to the radius of the entire k-space of 0.5 was used. Since the two-ring KWIA uses three time frames for denoising, for the first and last delay image, the same image was padded one frame to fulfill the requirement of KWIA. KWIA denoised images of each delay were used as the reference to train the DL model in the following steps.\n\n3) DL training\n\nThe network was implemented with Python 3.7 and Pytorch 1.12. Adam was used as the optimizer with the initial learning rate of 1e−3 and will decay if the performance in the validation data did not improve for 20 epochs. Batch size was 16 for all of the experiments. The loss function used in model training was a combination of L1 loss and structural similarity loss (SSIM loss).\n\nLoss=LossL1+LossSSIM\n\n(4)\n\nFor training a new model (train from scratch), the model weights were randomly initialized. Fine-tuning uses the weights of the pretrained model as the starting point and all layers were updated during the training process. The pretrained model used the same network architecture as described in the previous session. It was trained on two single-delay ASL datasets with 104 training scans and has been tested on 57 scans from three different vendors. The details of the pretrained model was described in [11]. For comparison, we also tested the direct apply of the pretrained model to this new unseen dataset without retraining the model.\n\nFor both train-from-scratch and fine-tune model training, a five-fold cross validation was used which takes 27 cases for training, 8 cases for validation and 9 cases for testing. This allows that each case can be tested for once to evaluate the performance on the whole dataset.\n\nD. Results evaluation\n\nTo get the quantitative maps from the perfusion images, the original or the denoised multi-delay perfusion images were fed into the one compartment kinetic model[22] to fit for CBF and ATT maps using the following equation.\n\nΔM(w)=2fαM0λR1aexp(min(σ-w,0)-σ)R1a-exp-(τ+w)R1a\n\n(5)\n\nwhere f and σ are CBF and ATT to be fitted, ∆M(ω) is the measured perfusion signal, M0 is the equilibrium magnetization of brain tissue. Blood T1 and the corresponding relation rate R1a was adjusted for each subject’s age and gender according to a previously established blood T1 model[23], α=0.78 is the labeling efficiency, λ=0.9g/ml is the brain blood partition coefficient, τ=1.5s is the labeling duration and ω is PLD.\n\nThe performance of denoising was evaluated in three aspects. First, the quality of the denoised image is measured by gray matter SNR of the 1) perfusion images, 2) CBF maps and 3) ATT maps, calculated using the mean value in the gray matter (GM) divided by the standard deviation in the white matter (WM). Second, mean CBF and ATT values of whole brain, gray matter and white matter were calculated within the masks and compared to the values fitted from the original images without any denoising to assess the reconstruction accuracy. Third, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of two-way mixed effects, absolute agreement and single rater[24] was calculated to evaluate the test and retest reliability from 21 subjects using the following equation:\n\nICC=MSR-MSEMSR+(k-1)MSE+kn(MSC-MSE)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere MSR is the mean square for rows, MSE is the mean square for error, MSC is mean square for columns, n is the number of subjects and k is the number of measurements. ICC was calculated to evaluate the test-retest robustness of the acquisition and influence of the denoising algorithm.\n\nV. DISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we developed a high resolution (iso-2mm) MDASL protocol for pediatric perfusion imaging along with a DL framework with KWIA denoised images as reference for denoising multi-delay ASL. ASL has been shown to be a promising and potentially ideal imaging modality to study neurodevelopment since it is entirely noninvasive and provides perfusion images with higher SNR in children than in adults. Considering the variation of physiological parameters with age (e.g. ATT), MDASL is advantageous for improving perfusion quantification in children. However, it is challenging to achieve high spatial resolution with multi-delay acquisitions due to long acquisition time. The proposed protocol represents a significant step forward compared to the previous study[5] that achieved iso-3mm MDASL with TGV regularized reconstruction, given that the SNR of iso-2mm was ~30% of that of iso-3mm scan. We proposed a Transformer based DL model to address the low SNR with KWIA denoised images as reference. Our results showed that the proposed DL model outperformed conventional methods such as TGV and KWIA, with high computational efficiency.\n\nThere has not been many publicly available ASL datasets especially for multi-delay ASL at a very high-resolution. In previous work for ASL denoising[8], [9], [10], [11], it always requires high-SNR reference images to train the model. Although traditional methods such as Gaussian smoothing or NLM can be applied and serve as a surrogate supervision for training the model, these methods will over smooth the images and are not suitable for the case where the resolution of the image needs to be preserved. Compared to other methods, such as TGV, KWIA has the benefit of easy implementation, minimal spatially blurring and preserving the temporal resolution of the original image series[6]. KWIA uses current time frame and its adjacent time frames to perform weighted averaging in the k-space so that the high frequency part can get more averages and thus higher SNR. Although this will not cause spatial blurring to the image, there will be correlation in the noise among these denoised images, which can cause temporal smoothing to the whole time series. For this reason, it has been shown that little improvement was achieved for the quantitative maps such as CBF and ATT. However, since DL model treats each of the images in the time series independently, the increase in the SNR in all images will result in an overall improvement for the fitting result, which is also shown in our study.\n\nFor DL denoising algorithm in medical imaging and especially for quantitative methods, image quality is not the only criteria, the importance of quantification accuracy should also be emphasized. In our experiments, we tried to minimize the quantification biases by using KWIA filtered image as the reference. However, the results still show a small degree of decrease in the fitted CBF maps. Since the value of CBF correlates with the averaged values of the 5 perfusion images, it’s possible that this decrease in value is the result of the removed noise in the perfusion images. ATT values show little changes after denoising, which shows that the temporal relationship among these PLDs has been kept after denoising.\n\nThe performance of fine-tuning on a pretrained model is also studied in our experiments. In fine-tuning, the weights of the pretrained model are used as the starting point for the new model instead of a randomized initialization. The fine-tuning strategy is recommended especially when there is not enough training data for the target task since training from scratch might lead to overfitting without enough data. However, it is not clear how to determine if a sample size is small or how will this affect the final results. We tested this by comparing training a new model from scratch and fine-tuning a pretrained model with a similar task, which is single-delay ASL denoising. Compared to the new task, the pretrained model was trained on images with lower resolution and also with the high-SNR reference. The expected SNR improvement for the pretrained model is higher. However, although the task for denoising is similar, when directly applying the pretrained model to denoising the high-resolution multi-delay ASL, the performance is not very good. This is due to the reason that there are still considerable differences between the source and target data, including different resolution, different ASL parameters and different population. In our results, we have shown that fine-tuning from the pretrained model can provide a higher starting point and also faster convergence compared to training a new model from scratch, while the performance of the two models are similar. This would be beneficial when there is only limited training resource and a more generalized model is warranted which fits a larger variety of data.\n\nThere are several limitations of this study. First, we do not have a gold-standard reference for our dataset. Our study population is children, and it is not easy to acquire the high-SNR reference for this dataset due to long scan time and head motion. We tested our performance based on non-reference metrics such as SNR. It is warranted that this method to be tested on other datasets with a real reference values. Second, we only used a five-delay dataset. While it is still not clear whether increasing the number of delays will improve the accuracy of quantitative maps, the performance of KWIA improves with the number of rings. With only five delays, we can only use a two-ring KWIA. Nevertheless, a three-ring KWIA is more desirable for datasets with more than 5 delays. Third, whether the quantitative bias reflects a successful denoising remains not clear. Future studies will need to involve larger datasets with ground truth values."
