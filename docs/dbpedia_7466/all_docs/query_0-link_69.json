        "text": "With snow falling overnight, particularly throughout the hilly regions of Central and Western Massachusetts, some schools have decided to close or delay the start of school Monday.\n\nSome communities may wake up to 4 to 8 inches of snow on the ground Monday morning, the National Weather Service said Sunday.\n\nThe agency’s regional office in Norton issued a winter storm warning for some areas of the state Sunday morning, cautioning of heavy snow and difficult road travel into Monday.\n\nMeteorologists were less certain of how much snow would accumulate at lower elevations, where temperatures were slightly warmer.\n\nA winter weather advisory is in effect across the lower-altitude parts of the state, including communities east of Interstate 495, the Connecticut River Valley and areas closer to Connecticut and Rhode Island. In those regions, the weather service forecasted a combination of rain and snow Sunday, followed by a full transition to snow overnight and a slippery commute Monday morning.\n\nMore on education\n\nWest Springfield expands preschool options based on past success\n\nSaugus school policy ‘impermissibly’ bars entry for migrant families, lawyers say\n\nEmerson College lays off 10 staff members amid declining enrollment\n\nHolyoke Community College is offering info sessions on new free community college program\n\nA plan to return Holyoke Public Schools to local control to be unveiled Monday\n\nFor residents of Cape Cod and the South Coast, the storm is only expected to bring rain.
