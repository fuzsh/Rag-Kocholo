        "text": "WASHINGTON, DC(September 29, 2017)- Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (CT-03) released the following statement regarding FDA publishing a final rule to delay the update to the nutrition facts label.\n\n\"Today the FDA announced that they are delaying the compliance deadline for the new nutrition facts labels. Consumers must now wait another 18 months to get the information they need to evaluate products and make healthy choices. We have an obesity crisis in our country that will be exasperated by this unnecessary delay.\"\n\n\"This decision is going to keep consumers in the dark for an additional three or four years. The delay will push new labels from being released in July 2018 to January 2020 for large companies. This delay is even longer for small companies, from July 2019 to January 2021, which account for 90 percent of the industry,\" said DeLauro. \"I am disappointed that the Administration is siding with industry and once again making it more difficult for American families to have the information they need to make informed and healthy choices.\"\n\n###"
