        "text": "This guidance tells you the information you must provide with food products, so you comply with the rules on food information to consumers.\n\nThese rules apply to you if you operate a food business, even if you give food to consumers for free. You do not need to give food information to customers if you’re not a food business and you’re providing food for an occasional event, like a village fair.\n\nLabelling pre-packed food\n\nPre-packed food is any food that’s put into packaging before being put on sale and that cannot be altered without opening or changing the packaging.\n\nInformation to display on labels or packaging\n\nYou must display the following information (mandatory information) on the product packaging or on a label attached to the packaging:\n\nthe name of the food\n\nthe quantitative ingredients declaration (QUID), where needed\n\na list of ingredients (including allergens)\n\nthe weight or volume of the food (net quantity)\n\na ‘best before’ or ‘use by’ date\n\nthe name and address of the food business operator (FBO) responsible for the food information\n\nthe alcoholic strength by volume (as a percentage) on drinks containing over 1.2% alcohol by volume\n\nFind out how to label spirit drinks that you plan to sell in the UK.\n\nHow to display information on labels or packaging\n\nInformation on labels must be difficult to remove (indelible).\n\nYour labelling must allow the customer to see all the following information at the same time (it must be in the same field of vision):\n\nthe name of the food\n\nthe net quantity of the food\n\nalcoholic strength by volume (for drinks containing over 1.2% alcohol)\n\nYou must print all the mandatory information using a font with a minimum x-height of 1.2 millimetres.\n\nIf the largest surface area of packaging is less than 80cm squared, you can use a minimum x-height of 0.9mm.\n\nAdd information about country of origin and special storage conditions\n\nState a product’s country of origin or place of provenance on the label if the words or pictures on the packaging imply that it comes from somewhere else. For example, if a food has a tartan wrapper but was not made in Scotland, you need to put the actual country of origin on the label.\n\nThe ‘country of origin’ tells the consumer the country in which the food was produced. The ‘place of provenance’ may be a group of countries or a region within a country.\n\nSome country of origin rules have changed. Read guidance on country of origin labelling.\n\nDescribe on the label any special storage conditions or instructions if consumers will need them to use the food appropriately. For example, a product may need the words ‘keep refrigerated and use within 3 days of opening’ or ‘do not reheat’.\n\nIf a product has been packaged in a protective atmosphere, include the words ‘packaged in a protective atmosphere’ on the label or packaging.\n\nLabel allergens\n\nYou must give information on allergens in food. This includes substances produced or derived from allergens or used in processing the food.\n\nAllergens are:\n\ncereals containing gluten, such as wheat (including spelt and khorasan wheat), rye, barley and oats\n\ncrustaceans, for example prawns, crabs, lobster, crayfish\n\neggs\n\nfish\n\npeanuts\n\nsoybeans\n\nmilk (including lactose)\n\nnuts (almonds, hazelnuts, pistachio nuts, pecan nuts, walnuts, Brazil nuts and macadamia or Queensland nuts)\n\ncelery (including celeriac)\n\nmustard\n\nsesame seeds\n\nsulphur dioxide or sulphites, if they are more than 10 milligrams per kilogram or 10 milligrams per litre in the finished product\n\nlupin, including lupin seeds and flour\n\nmolluscs, for example mussels, oysters, snails and squid\n\nRead the full guidance on food allergen labelling.\n\nList the ingredients\n\nYou must put a list of ingredients (including information on additives) on the packaging of all pre-packed products except:\n\nfresh fruit and vegetables that have not been peeled, cut or similarly treated\n\ncarbonated water that is labelled as ‘carbonated water’\n\nfermented vinegars derived from single, basic product (such as white wine) with no added ingredients\n\ncheese, butter, fermented milk or cream if its only ingredients are lactic products, food enzymes and microorganism cultures essential to its manufacture\n\nproducts consisting of a single ingredient where the name of the food is the same as the name of the ingredient or clearly identifies what the ingredient is (for example, peanuts or eggs)\n\nproducts on which no side of the packaging or container has a surface area larger than 10cm squared\n\nproducts in glass bottles for reuse that have food information indelibly marked on them and have no other labelling (for example, milk bottles)\n\nany alcoholic drink containing over 1.2% alcohol by volume\n\nYou must put the ingredients list under a heading that contains the word ‘ingredients’.\n\nIf you’re not sure whether your particular food product is exempt from needing an ingredients list, contact your local trading standards office.\n\nThe name of ingredients should follow the rules set out for the name of the food. For example, you must only call an ingredient ‘jam’ if it meets the compositional standards for jam.\n\nYou must list the ingredients by weight from the most to the least that your product contains (based on the ingredient weights at the time of manufacture).\n\nOther information in the ingredients list\n\nPut ‘(nano)’ after the name of any engineered nanomaterial used as an ingredient.\n\nLabel foods treated with ionising radiation with the words ‘irradiated’ or ‘treated with ionising radiation’.\n\nYou must also show if an ingredient has been irradiated, even if it’s a compound ingredient (such as cheese) which has had one of its constituent parts irradiated (for example, the milk used to make the cheese).\n\nGive a quantitative ingredients declaration (QUID)\n\nThe QUID tells a customer the percentage of particular ingredients contained in a food product.\n\nWhen to display the QUID\n\nYou must show a QUID if the ingredient:\n\nis in the name of the food (for example, the ‘blackberry’ and ‘apple’ in a blackberry and apple pie)\n\nis usually associated with that name by the consumer (‘mutton’ in a Lancashire hotpot)\n\nis emphasised by words, pictures or graphics on the label (for example, if there’s a picture of blackberries on the label)\n\ncharacterises a food and distinguishes it from products with a similar name or appearance\n\nFor example, lasagne made with pork must show the QUID for the pork because it characterises the product and distinguishes it from a lasagne (usually made with beef).\n\nYou do not need to give a QUID if the ingredients:\n\nhave only been used in small quantities as flavouring\n\nare used in varying proportions and can be labelled as fruit, vegetables, mushrooms, herbs or spices (such as in a vegetable soup)\n\nalready have a quantity shown on the label as a ‘drained net weight’\n\nYou do not need a QUID for ingredients that can vary in quantity without altering the character of the food or distinguishing it from similar foods. For example, you do not need to show a QUID for flour in a flour tortilla.\n\nYou must give the meat QUID when you sell loose or pre-packed-for-direct-sale products that contain meat and other ingredients (except in a catering environment). You must display the QUID on a label on the food or display it clearly where the customer can see it when they are choosing the product.\n\nOn pre-packed food, you must give this information either:\n\nas a percentage in brackets in the ingredients list after the name of the ingredient, for example ‘pork (80%)’\n\nin or next to the name of the food, for example ‘containing 80% pork’\n\nYou must usually show either a ‘best before’ or a ‘use by’ date on the packaging or label of pre-packed food products.\n\nOnly show a ‘use by’ date where there’s a safety issue with eating the food after this date. It’s a criminal offence to sell food that’s past its ‘use by’ date.\n\nRead Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) guidance on date marking\n\nYou do not need to show a ‘best before’ or ‘use by’ date, but you must include a lot number on:\n\nfresh fruit and vegetables which have not been peeled, cut or similarly treated (except for sprouting seeds and similar products, like legume sprouts)\n\nwines, liqueur wines, sparkling wines, aromatised wines and similar products made from fruit other than grapes\n\ndrinks made from fermented grapes or grape musts\n\ndrinks containing 10% or more alcohol by volume\n\nbaked or pastry goods which are normally consumed within 24 hours of being made\n\nvinegar\n\ncooking salt\n\nsolid sugar\n\nconfectionery made almost solely of flavoured or coloured sugars\n\nchewing gums and similar chewing products\n\nIf you’re not sure whether your particular food product is exempt from showing a date of minimum durability, contact your local trading standards office.\n\nShow the name and address of the food business operator\n\nYou must include a business name and address on the packaging or food label of pre-packed food products. This must be either:\n\nthe name of the business whose name the food is marketed under\n\nthe address of the business that has imported the food\n\nPre-packaged food or caseins sold in NI must include a NI or EU FBO address. If the FBO is not in NI or EU, include the address of your importer, based in NI or the EU.\n\nYou can continue to use an EU, GB or NI address for the FBO on pre-packaged food or caseins sold in GB until 31 December 2023.\n\nFrom 1 January 2024, pre-packaged food or caseins sold in GB must include a UK address for the FBO. If the FBO is not in the UK, include the address of your importer, based in the UK.\n\nThe address needs to be a physical address where your business can be contacted by mail. You cannot use an email address or phone number.\n\nGive nutritional information\n\nYou must label pre-packed food products with nutritional information if:\n\nyou make a nutritional or health claim on the packaging (for example ‘high in fibre’ or ‘good source of calcium’)\n\nvitamins or minerals have been added to the food\n\nYou can choose to provide nutrition information on other food products.\n\nWhen you provide nutrition information, you must follow the guidance on nutrition labelling.\n\nNutrition labelling has been compulsory on most pre-packed foods since December 2016.\n\nTell the consumer about certain ingredients\n\nYou must tell the consumer if your product contains:\n\nsweeteners or sugars\n\naspartame and colourings\n\nliquorice\n\ncaffeine\n\npolyols\n\nSweeteners and sugars\n\nYou must put the words, ‘with sweetener(s)’ by the name of food products containing sweeteners\n\nYou must put the words, ‘with sugar(s) and sweetener(s)’ by the name of food products containing both sugars and sweeteners.\n\nAspartame and colourings\n\nTo comply with the rules on labelling additives, you must put the following warnings on the label if the product contains aspartame:\n\n‘contains a source of phenylalanine’, if aspartame is named in the ingredients list\n\n‘contains aspartame (a source of phenylalanine)’ if you use the E number (E951) instead of the name in the ingredients list\n\nLiquorice\n\nYou must tell the consumer if a product contains glycyrrhizinic acid, its ammonium salt or the liquorice plant (Glycyrrhiza glabra). Put the following words immediately after the ingredients list (or by the name of the food if there’s no ingredients list):\n\n‘contains liquorice’ on confectionary or drinks that contain 100 milligrams per kilogram or 10 milligrams per litre or more (unless you have named liquorice as an ingredient)\n\n‘contains liquorice – people suffering from hypertension should avoid excessive consumption’ on confectionery that contains 4 grams per kilogram or more\n\n‘contains liquorice – people suffering from hypertension should avoid excessive consumption’ on drinks that contain 50 milligrams per litre or more (or 300 milligrams per litre if it also contains more than 1.2% alcohol by volume)\n\nCaffeine\n\nYou must label drinks that contain more than 150 milligrams per litre of caffeine with the words ‘High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women’.\n\nThis also applies to concentrated or dried drinks that will contain more than 150 milligrams per litre of caffeine when reconstituted. It does not apply to tea and coffee drinks if ‘tea’ or ‘coffee’ are in the name of the food.\n\nWhere caffeine has been added to a food product (other than a drink) for a physiological purpose, you must put the words ‘Contains caffeine. Not recommended for children or pregnant women’ on the label.\n\nYou must put these warnings in the same field of vision as the name of the food and include the caffeine content in milligrams per 100 grams or per 100 millilitres in brackets after the warning.\n\nPolyols\n\nYou must label foods that contain more than 10% added polyols with the words ‘excessive consumption may produce laxative effects’.\n\nPlant sterols and stanols\n\nYou must label foods with added phytosterols, phytosterol esters, phytostanols or phytostanol esters with all of the following:\n\n‘with added plant sterols’ or ‘with added plant stanols’ (in the same field of vision as the name of the food)\n\na statement that the food is intended exclusively for people who want to lower their blood cholesterol level, and a statement that the consumption of more than 3g per day of added plant sterols or plant stanols should be avoided (both in the same field of vision on the packaging)\n\na statement that patients on cholesterol lowering medication should only consume the product under medical supervision\n\nan easily visible statement that the food may not be nutritionally appropriate for pregnant or breastfeeding women and children under the age of 5\n\nadvice that the food is to be used as part of a balanced and varied diet, including regular consumption of fruit and vegetables to help maintain carotenoid levels\n\na definition of a portion of the food or food ingredient along with the amount of the plant sterol or plant stanol that each portion contains\n\nYou must put the amount of added phytosterols, phytosterol esters, phytostanols or phytostanol esters the food contains in the list of ingredients (as a percentage or the number of grams of free plant sterols or plant stanols per 100g or 100ml).\n\nDistance selling\n\nIf you sell food products online or by phone or mail order, you must make the required information available for free to the customer before they buy (except the durability and freezing dates) and when it is delivered to them.\n\nSelling food products to other businesses\n\nYou must pass on certain information about products if you are an FBO selling food products to other businesses, not to the final consumer. At the end of the supply chain, whoever is selling a food product to the final consumer must have all the information they need to provide.\n\nInformation you must give\n\nIf the food will be sold non pre-packed to the final consumer, you must provide all the information required for non pre-packed foods.\n\nIf the food will be sold pre-packed to the final consumer, you must provide all information required for pre-packed food. This applies even if the pre-packing will be done by someone else after you sell it.\n\nIf you do not know how the food will be sold to the final consumer, you should assume that it will be pre-packed.\n\nHow to give the information\n\nYou must give the information on the pre-packaging if the packaging will not be changed before the product is sold to the final consumer.\n\nIf you’re not responsible for the final pre-packaging of the product or it is non pre-packed, you must provide the information either:\n\non pre-packaging\n\non a label attached to the pre-packaging\n\nin the commercial documents associated with the food\n\nYou must send your customer the commercial documents before or at the same time as you send them the food.\n\nLabel external packaging\n\nYou must also put extra information on any external packaging that you use to supply food that meets either of the following conditions:\n\nit’ll be taken out of your external packaging and sold in its own packaging (for example, a large box containing bags of potato crisps)\n\nit’ll be used by a mass caterer to prepare food or it’ll be split or cut up\n\nYou must label your external packaging with:\n\nthe name of the food\n\nthe ‘best before’ or ‘use by’ date\n\nany special storage conditions\n\nthe name and address of your business\n\nVoluntary information\n\nSome businesses that you sell to may ask you for additional, voluntary labelling information.\n\nEnforcement for Brexit label changes\n\nYou’ll need to make any required labelling changes for goods sold in GB by 31 December 2023.\n\nLocal authorities in GB will be responsible for enforcement of labelling changes.\n\nYour label can contain other information if you need to comply with labelling requirements for another market.\n\nUnder the Northern Ireland Protocol, goods sold in NI continue to follow EU rules for food labelling. There are changes to labelling that apply from 1 January 2021\n\nHowever, the UK government recognises that businesses will need time to adapt to these new labelling rules.\n\nThe UK government is working with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) and district councils in NI on an enforcement approach of new labelling requirements on the NI market that takes these challenges into account.\n\nIn line with previous rule changes for labelling, there’s a proportionate and risk-based enforcement approach particularly for:\n\nidentification marks\n\nFood Business Operator (FBO) address requirements\n\n‘UK(NI)’ origin labelling requirements\n\nThis approach is being implemented in a way which supports businesses as they adapt to the requirements over time.\n\nImprovement notices\n\nIn most cases, an officer from your local authority may issue you with an improvement notice if you have not complied with food regulations. Improvement notices cannot be issued in relation to net weight contraventions, but you can be prosecuted if you break net weight rules.\n\nYou’re committing an offence and may be prosecuted if you do not comply with an improvement notice.\n\nYou may be prosecuted (without first being given an improvement notice) if you break the rules on allergens.\n\nAn improvement notice will tell you what your business is doing wrong, what rules have been broken, how to comply and by when. It will also tell you how to appeal against an improvement notice.\n\nYou can continue to operate if you get an improvement notice, but you must do what it tells you to do within the time it specifies.\n\nGet labelling advice\n\nIf you’re a business and want advice on labelling, contact your local trading standards office."
