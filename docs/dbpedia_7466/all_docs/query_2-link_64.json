The next year, it pushed the date back to 2023 and then delayed it again to 2024.\n\nIn its latest postponement, Google said in a blog, “we envision proceeding with third-party cookie deprecation starting early next year.”\n\nThe decision to delay cookie deprecation has never entirely been in Google’s hands."
