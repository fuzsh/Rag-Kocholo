        "text": "Updated: October 2nd, 2023.\n\nAre you looking for ways to fire a specific tracking script or popup after a 20-second delay? If your answer is Yes, hop on board because I’ll show you how to use the timer trigger in Google Tag Manager.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a Timer Trigger?\n\nCreate a Timer Trigger within Google Tag Manager\n\nWhat Happens in the Data Layer?\n\nUse Cases\n\nPostponing Email Popup\n\nCombining with another trigger (via Trigger Group)\n\nStart a timer trigger after a click\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat is a Timer Trigger in Google Tag Manager?\n\nTimer Trigger is a type of trigger that fires after a certain duration of time has passed on the web page.\n\nThe most common uses for the timer trigger are sending an event to Google Analytics after X seconds or deferring a tag from firing until you can be more confident that an asynchronous request has occurred. But don’t limit yourself!\n\nCreate a Timer Trigger within Google Tag Manager\n\nTo get started, you must have a Google Tag Manager account and the necessary permissions to edit your website’s GTM container. Go to Triggers > New > Trigger Configuration > Timer and enter the following settings.\n\nEvent Name: This lets you customize the event name GTM pushes to dataLayer. It’s most helpful when you want to fire multiple timers on the same page.\n\nInterval: Here, you can specify how many milliseconds should pass between each activation of this trigger. Enter 10000 if you want the time trigger to activate after 10 seconds.\n\nLimit: This option lets you choose how many times the trigger fires before it should stop.\n\nAlso, it would be best to delimit the timer to only fire on specific pages using the Enable When option. You’ll need to provide some conditions already present when Google Tag Manager is first loaded, such as Page Path equals /home-page/ or something similar. In my blog, I will use the timer on all pages, thus the Enable When condition is Page Path contains / (because the Page Path variable will always contain at least one slash)\n\nLast, you can decide whether to fire a tag on all timers or only particular ones. I used All timers.\n\nHit save.\n\nA sample timer trigger could look like this (fires once after 10 seconds on all pages):\n\nWhat Happens in the Data Layer?\n\nAfter creating a timer trigger, enable GTM Preview and Debug mode, and navigate to the new window with the site you’re working on. (to test how the trigger works).\n\nAfter the preview and debug console appears, wait for the timer trigger to activate.\n\nPro-tip by Captain Obvious: for testing purposes, create a timer trigger that fires after 10 seconds (or even less). If you set it to fire after 60 seconds (or more), you’ll wait too long, and your debugging session will become super boring.\n\nAnyway, let’s go back to our Preview and Debug mode. After waiting 10 seconds, the gtm.timer event appears on the left side of the pane.\n\nClick it and navigate to the Data Layer tab. You should see the array of various parameters.\n\nEvery time a timer trigger activates, it pushes a particular set of data to the data layer:\n\ngtm.timerId – A unique identifier number for the timer. Each timer you have on the page has a different ID.\n\ngtm.timerEventNumber – The number of activated timers on the current page.\n\ngtm.timerInterval – The value you set in the Interval option when creating the timer.\n\ngtm.timerStartTime – The timestamp of when the timer first started.\n\ngtm.timerCurrentTime – The timestamp of the most recent timer activation.\n\ngtm.timerElapsedTime – The time in milliseconds since the timer started.\n\nThe remarkable thing about Google Tag Manager is that you can fetch any parameter from the data layer and turn it into a variable.\n\nIf you wish to know the event number (which iteration of the timer trigger was just completed), you can create a Data Layer variable gtm.timerEventNumber (see the example below). P.S. dlv – stands for Data Layer Variable.\n\nAfter you create this variable:\n\nRefresh P&D Mode and navigate to the tab with the website you’re currently working on.\n\nWait for the timer trigger to fire.\n\nThen click the event and head over to the Variables tab of the Preview and Debug pane. What you’ll see it your newly created variable dlv – gtm.timerEventNumber.\n\nWhat does it mean? Say, that you set the timer to fire every minute, dispatching a specific GA4 event tag. That tag sends the information about the number of activated triggers associated with that event with the help of the dlv – gtm.timerEventNumber variable.\n\nSimilarly, if you wanted to capture additional details like gtm.timerCurrentTime or gtm.timerElapsedTime, you can follow the same route by creating the datalayer variables for them.\n\nAs a result, your GA4 event tag could look like this:\n\nNote: since timer_cycle is a custom parameter, you would need to register it as an event-scoped custom dimension in GA4.\n\nUse Cases of the Timer Trigger\n\nIf you’re still looking for ideas where a timer trigger might come in handy, here is some food for thought.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, I use this type of trigger myself (in this blog) to delay my email popup AND blue widget, which asks my visitors to subscribe.\n\nCombining with another trigger (via Trigger Group)\n\nGoogle Tag Manager also lets you combine multiple triggers into a mega-trigger. For example, if ALL triggers’ conditions are met on the same page, the trigger group will be activated, and the associated tags will fire.\n\nFor example, it makes sense to fire a tag when a visitor spends at least 60 seconds on your page AND scrolls at least 50% of the page height. If you want to implement the same, here’s how to do it.\n\nLet’s start with creating the triggers for this use case. The timer trigger should fire after 60 seconds, just like in the screenshot below.\n\nNow, to proceed with the scroll depth trigger. Click New and select the Scroll Depth variable from the options. Enter the following settings:\n\nNow, we need to create the trigger group. Click on New and select Trigger Group.\n\nNow select the triggers to be added.\n\nYes, that’s all you need to do to create a trigger group!\n\nLet’s create a GA4 tag that sends the event engaged_user to Google Analytics when the trigger group is fired, i.e., both conditions are met.\n\nTest it in the Preview and Debug mode. You should see it appear like this.\n\nAlso, confirm that the event has been passed to GA4 by looking at the DebugView screen.\n\nRemember, you can configure the scroll depth and timer depending on the purpose of your website. This is simply the way to do it.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Start a timer trigger after a click\n\nThis idea came from Simo Ahava. If you want a timer to start when the user does something (e.g., click), you’ll need to use a Custom HTML tag with custom code. Here’s the code:\n\n<script> (function() { // CHANGE THESE THREE: var eventName = 'custom.timer'; // The event name that is pushed into dataLayer var interval = 5000; // The interval in milliseconds var limit = 1; // The number of times the timer fires // OTHER SETTINGS: var timerNumber = 1; var startTime = new Date().getTime(); var fireTimer = function() { var timeNow = new Date().getTime(); window.dataLayer.push({ 'event' : eventName, 'custom.timerCurrentTime' : timeNow, 'custom.timerElapsedTime' : timeNow - startTime, 'custom.timerStartTime' : startTime, 'custom.timerEventNumber' : timerNumber, 'custom.timerId' : timerId, 'custom.timerInterval' : interval, 'custom.timerLimit' : limit }); timerNumber += 1; if (limit < timerNumber) { window.clearInterval(timerId); } }; var timerId = window.setInterval(fireTimer, interval); })(); </script>\n\nIt does pretty much the same thing as the timer trigger. The difference is that you can use any trigger to fire this custom HTML tag, for example, form submission, etc.\n\nExample: Show a popup 10 seconds after a visitor clicks the SHARE under your article.\n\nAnd don’t forget to edit the timer interval (var interval) and limit (var limit) in the script above to match your needs.\n\nAlso, the keys pushed into dataLayer differ in that the prefix is not gtm. but custom.. So gtm.timerId becomes custom.timerId, etc.\n\nGoogle Tag Manager Timer Trigger: Conclusion\n\nAlthough the timer trigger is pretty basic, it’s one of those must-have weapons in your Google Tag Manager arsenal. It’s fairly easy to use and allows you to postpone a certain tag for a particular period of time.\n\nI use it to postpone email popups (on this blog), while others might utilize it in order to lower the bounce rate in their Google Analytics report. But don’t limit yourself just to these examples. Be creative!\n\nGot questions? The comments section below is at your service."
