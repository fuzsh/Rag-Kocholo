The contractual opening date was originally set for November 2024 with substantial monetary penalties for each day beyond the deadline.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Windsor Star ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Windsor Star ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nThe federal government is waiving those penalties while taking on the cost of the extra $700-million.\n\nThe delays and the budget increases are considered a “shared risk,” said Heather Grondin, spokesperson for the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority (WDBA).\n\n“In our contract, we did allow for some instances where some things could be a shared risk,” Grondin told the Star. “This would be an example of that.\n\n“Understanding the pandemic that we’ve gone through, our contract did allow for schedule and cost risks to be shared in certain circumstances.\n\n“So, in a circumstance such as the pandemic — something that you wouldn’t necessarily be able to plan for — our contract allowed for those circumstances to be taken under consideration.”\n\nThe WDBA, which oversees the project for the federal government, and the consortium of contractors known as Bridging North America (BNA) announced in a joint statement on Thursday they have agreed to amend the cost and timeline of the project.\n\nThe teams said the bridge construction, like many other projects, faced “unprecedented disruptions” caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“After a three-year pandemic and considering the size and complexity of the Gordie Howe International Bridge project, our project team is pleased that the impact to the construction schedule is limited to only 10 months beyond the original contracted completion date and that we could agree on a reasonable adjustment to the contract value,” said bridge authority CEO Charl van Niekerk.\n\n“With safety as our top priority, we will continue to work together to deliver this much needed infrastructure to the thousands of eager travellers ready to cross North America’s longest cable-stayed bridge.”\n\nMP Irek Kusmierczyk (L — Windsor-Tecumseh) told the Star “a delay is not entirely unexpected” given COVID-19 issues and supply chain disruptions.\n\nBut with an extended community benefits plan and 11 million worker hours already put into the project, with more to come, he said the delay is actually good for the local economy.\n\n“The way I see it, you’ve got more local workers working longer on this project,” said Kusmierczyk. “You’ve got more workers bringing home good paycheques on this historic project, which is important especially as we pull ourselves out of the COVID aftershocks.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe global pandemic wasn’t the only issue delaying the project. The Star reported in 2022, after obtaining an analyst’s report, that completion of the bridge would likely be delayed to at least August 2025, partly due to several disputes between WDBA and BNA.\n\nThe Star also reported in 2022 that BNA had formally requested relief from the contracted project completion date.\n\nGrondin told the Star at the time that there were no plans to alter the project, and the contractor was still “obligated” to meet contract dates. She acknowledged Thursday that the disputes contributed to the delays, but said those issues have been resolved.\n\n“I know there had been some speculation about timing and extension of the construction schedule,” she said. “But really what we needed to do was see how much progress could be made over 2023 and where we were at over that time.\n\n“What’s different now is we’re able to present with more confidence the schedule and confirmation of our overall timeline of being able to open in 2025.”\n\nThe WDBA said that in recognition of the impacts of the extended construction period, it has budgeted for a one-year extension of the Gordie Howe International Bridge Community Benefits Plan.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe additional $3 million will be divided equally between the communities of Sandwich/West Windsor and Delray/Southwest Detroit.\n\n“The most important thing is it’s getting done,” said MP Brian Masse (NDP — Windsor West).\n\n“We can live with the delay in terms of the repercussions to the community,” he said.\n\n“But I want to do a full investigation and analysis as to the contract not being met and making sure we’re getting the best value for taxpayers, because we paid a premium to have a public-private partnership for this deal.\n\n“And it coming in late and over budget are something we just want to make sure are accounted for. So we can live with it.\n\n“We’re going to get some community benefits, which is what I pushed for. But we want to make sure it’s going to be the best deal for taxpayers.”\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nCompletion of Gordie Howe bridge reaches another milestone\n\nGordie Howe bridge to cost $5.7B, open in 2024\n\nDespite the delays, WDBA said 2023 was the busiest construction year on the project so far.\n\nGrondin said the biggest 2023 milestone was the towers reaching their full heights.\n\nIn 2024, she said highlights will include the Canadian and U.S. sides of the road deck meeting over the Detroit River, and the installation of all 216 stay cables.\n\n“We’re all very happy with the progress that was made over 2023,” she said. “It’s put us in a good position to be able to continue that same level of progress in 2024.\n\n“So full steam ahead. And a lot of work still ahead of us this year and into next.”\n\ntwilhelm@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
