        "text": "Due to the Department of Defense guidance (DODI 1336.01) that requires the electronic creation and transmission of the DD Form 215, National Archives and Records Administration will no longer create a DD Form 215 to make corrections to the DD-214.\n\nIf the record in question is archival (discharged, retired, or died in service 62 years ago or earlier) you will need to apply to the review board for your respective service branch for corrections or changes. Instructions on what to submit for each are listed below.\n\nIf the record in question is not archival, you will need to request a correction from the personnel command of your respective service branch, i.e. Navy Personnel Command, Army Human Resources Command, etc. Please see the table below for the addresses of each command.\n\nIf you are requesting a change to your character of service, i.e. dishonorable discharge upgraded to honorable, you will need to apply to the review board for your respective service branch.\n\n(DO NOT submit these forms to the National Archives. Be sure to use the appropriate address for your service branch as listed in the table.)\n\nThe following information is from the Department of Veteran's Affairs Guide to Federal Benefits for Veterans and Dependents and is provided as a courtesy. We encourage you to check directly with the VA for updates or changes:\n\nMilitary Service Record\n\nSubmit DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Records to the relevant service branch. (You can either view and download the form, or right-click the form and select \"Save link as\" or otherwise save the file and then open it.)\n\nDischarge Status\n\nSubmit DD Form 293, Application for the Review of Discharge or Dismissal from the Armed Forces of the United Statesto the relevant service branch.\n\nCorrection of Military Records\n\nThe secretary of a military department, acting through a board for correction of military records, has authority to change any military record when necessary to correct an error or remove an injustice. A correction board may consider applications for correction of a military record, including a review of a discharge issued by courts martial.\n\nThe veteran, survivor or legal representative generally must file a request for correction within three years after discovery of an alleged error or injustice. The board may excuse failure to file within the prescribed time, however, if it finds it would be in the interest of justice to do so. It is an applicant’s responsibility to show why the filing of the application was delayed and why it would be in the interest of justice for the board to consider it despite the delay.\n\nTo justify any correction, it is necessary to show to the satisfaction of the board that the alleged entry or omission in the records was in error or unjust. Applications should include all available evidence, such as signed statements of witnesses or a brief of arguments supporting the requested correction. Application is made with DD Form 149, available at VA offices, from veterans organizations or from the Internet ( http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/index.htm).\n\nReview of Discharges\n\nEach of the military services maintains a discharge review board with authority to change, correct or modify discharges or dismissals that are not issued by a sentence of a general courts-martial. The board has no authority to address medical discharges. The veteran or, if the veteran is deceased or incompetent, the surviving spouse, next of kin or legal representative may apply for a review of discharge by writing to the military department concerned, using DoD Form 293. This form may be obtained at a VA regional office, from veterans organizations or from the Internet: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/index.htm. However, if the discharge was more than 15 years ago, a veteran must petition the appropriate service Board for Correction of Military Records using DoD Form 149, which is discussed in the “Correction of Military Records” section of this booklet. A discharge review is conducted by a review of an applicant’s record and, if requested, by a hearing before the board.\n\nDischarges awarded as a result of a continuous period of unauthorized absence in excess of 180 days make persons ineligible for VA benefits regardless of action taken by discharge review boards, unless VA determines there were compelling circumstances for the absence. Boards for the correction of military records also may consider such cases.\n\nVeterans with disabilities incurred or aggravated during active military service may qualify for medical or related benefits regardless of separation and characterization of service. Veterans separated administratively under other than honorable conditions may request that their discharge be reviewed for possible recharacterization, provided they file their appeal within 15 years of the date of separation. Questions regarding the review of a discharge should be addressed to the appropriate discharge review board at the address listed on DoD Form 293."
