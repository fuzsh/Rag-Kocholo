        "text": "One of our applications setup the visit tagging feature on version 1.124 of managed and we are noticing that there is about a 40 to 45 minute delay in data when browsing user sessions. Is this a known issue?\n\nthe capture below was taken at 9:37 am and as you can see we have our last sessions at 9:00 when looking back two hours.\n\nHere is another screenshot taken a few minutes later and as you can see. The data eventually populates, but there is quite a delay. Any ideas into why this could be occurring?\n\nRegards,\n\nShawn Givan"
