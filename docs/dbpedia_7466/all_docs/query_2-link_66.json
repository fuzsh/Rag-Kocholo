I wonder if anyone at Make can explain why sleep is limited to 300 seconds?\n\nI haven’t really looked into the Make API but I think there’s a way to turn on a module, and to set it’s automatic start time? You could put everything after your sleep into it’s own separate scenario, Then you’d just have to set it’s start time and turn it on? Can scenarios turn themselves off with the API?\n\nStill a lot of work when we already have the sleep module that could sleep longer.\n\nI would also love to have a “Sleep Until” module that either starts a watch module, or has a loop that you can add a Sleep + whatever check you need to do."
