        "text": "DMM measurements (delay and delay variation) work as follows.\n\nA DMM frame is sent from the originating unit to the remote unit. When the DMM frame is received by the remote unit, it sends a DMR to the originating unit. The reception of the DMM frame by the remote unit and the transmission of the DMR also involve some processing time that may or may not be accounted for. DMM measurements are measurements of network delay and network delay variation. The unit needs to eliminate the processing time in order to get a true measurement of the network delay and delay variation. This is accomplished by the use of four timestamps:\n\na = Time that the DMM frame is transmitted by the originating unit\n\nb = Time that the DMM frame is received by the remote unit\n\nc = Time that the DMR frame (DMM response) is transmitted by the remote unit\n\nd = Time that the DMR frame is received by the originating unit\n\nUsing these timestamps, the originating unit calculates one-way and two-way delay as follows:\n\nOne-Way Network Delay = d – c\n\nTwo-Way Network Delay = d – a – (c – b)\n\nThis is the two-way delay (including remote processing time) minus the remote processing time.\n\nTo configure DMM instances\n\nNote: One-way delay measurements require time synchronization, via NTP, on units at each probe end.\n\nComplete the required fields, then click Apply.\n\nFor more information on specific parameters, refer to the following table.\n\nDMM Configuration (SOAM ▶CFM ▶DMM ▶Configuration)\n\nParameterDescriptionIndexThe index of the delay measurement instance.DMM Name\n\nName\n\nThe name of the delay measurement instance.MEP Index\n\nMEP idx\n\nThe index assigned to the Maintenance association End Point.MEPIDThe local Maintenance association End Point Identifier.Remote MEPID\n\nR-MEPID\n\nThe remote Maintenance association End Point Identifier.PriorityPriority value used in VLAN tags, if present, in the transmitted frame.EnableCheck box to enable sending DMM frames at the specified interval.Sampling Interval (msec)\n\nInterval\n\nThe time at which this delay measurement instance issues DMM frames.
