        "text": "Dedicated to Delay\n\nBefore we begin, let’s start with some brief background. BOSS and Roland (its parent company) have innovated with delay effects since their earliest days. On the Roland side, the RE-201 Space Echo—first introduced in 1974—is widely regarded as the premier tape-based delay unit ever made. Starting in 1983, rack units like the SDE-3000 Digital Delay were at the forefront of music tech, and they became vital components in the guitar effects systems used by the biggest names in music.\n\nWhile BOSS has made rack and tabletop delay units over the years, the primary focus has been on pedal-based effects that sound great, are easy to use, and are accessible to players of any skill level. To achieve these goals, BOSS has continually pushed the envelope with both analog and digital technologies, setting trends that continue to influence and lead the industry to this day.\n\nOkay, enough with the backstory. There’s a lot to cover, so let’s start the rundown!\n\n1978: DM-1 Delay Machine\n\nIn the 1970s, a lot of musicians wanted echo effects. But not all could afford the state-of-the-art at the time, which were expensive tape-based units like the previously mentioned Space Echo. The DM-1 Delay Machine—the first BOSS delay unit—provided a more affordable and compact alternative. While limited in frequency response and versatility compared to a Space Echo, the analog DM-1 offered a distinctive sound and provided delay times up to 500 milliseconds. Unlike the subsequent BBD-based models in the DM series, the DM-1’s circuit used a charge-coupled device (CCD), an electronic component that went on to be widely used in digital cameras.\n\nThose familiar with the legendary BOSS CE-1 Chorus Ensemble (the world’s first chorus pedal) will notice that the DM-1 uses the same heavy-duty metal chassis and AC power configuration, as both effects were in production in the same era. The DM-1 was produced for less than two years, so it’s a rare bird on the used market and commands high prices if you can find one.\n\n1981: DM-2 Delay\n\nThe next BOSS Delay Machine was the now-classic DM-2. The compact pedal series began to take off in the music community after its introduction in 1977, so it was an obvious progression to shrink the DM-1 concept into that smaller format. For the DM-2’s circuit design, BOSS employed a bucket-brigade device (BBD) instead of the CCD used in the DM-1.\n\nTo achieve a maximum of 300 milliseconds of delay time, BOSS engineers had to stretch the capabilities of the BBD chip used in the pedal. One of the ways they achieved this was to limit the frequency response of the effect sound. This compromise contributed to the DM-2’s warm and enveloping tone, which blends so well with a guitar or any other input signal.\n\nOver 30 years after it was discontinued, the DM-2 remains highly sought-after on the used pedal market. The Waza Craft DM-2W, introduced in 2014, faithfully recreates the DM-2’s original sound while adding additional range and features.\n\n1983: DD-2 Digital Delay\n\nBOSS and Roland are widely recognized for numerous milestone products in the music gear industry, and the DD-2 is most certainly one of them. As the world’s first digital delay in stompbox form (and the first digital pedal of any type from BOSS), the DD-2 put the higher audio fidelity and increased delay range of studio rack processors within easy reach of every musician.\n\nIn the early ’80s, digital technology emerged as a driving force in the world of music gear. Roland’s flagship digital delay at the time was the SDE-3000, a rack unit regularly used in recording studios. Thanks to its rich, guitar-friendly sound, it also found a home in large-scale rack rigs used by serious pro players. However, the SDE-3000’s cost and form factor were beyond the means of many working musicians and casual players at the time. (BOSS re-introduced the SDE-3000 in pedal form in 2023, which we’ll cover later.)\n\nThe SDE-3000 used a custom IC chip built specifically for the product. The original concept of the DD-2 was born when the BOSS engineers discovered, to their surprise, that this powerful chip could fit inside a compact pedal chassis (though just barely). With that, the next formidable steps were to fit the rest of the electronics in and power them all with a 9-volt battery!\n\nAfter an intense development period, the DD-2 was released. With its max delay time of 800 milliseconds and clear-yet-warm tone, the pedal was an instant smash and a must-have item. The DD-2 set the standard for the flurry of digital delay stomps to come from BOSS and other manufacturers, and every one of them owes its heritage to this revolutionary pedal.\n\n1984: DM-3 Delay\n\nWhile the digital DD-2 pedal was taking off in popularity, the analog DM-2 remained in the lineup for a time as a less expensive alternative. Its replacement, the next-generation (but still analog) DM-3, was slightly more affordable. Evolving from the DM-2, it included design tweaks that cleaned up the delay repeats for a clearer sound with less noise—an ever-present engineering challenge when trying to get the best performance out of analog BBD circuits. The DM-3 also featured jacks for sending dry and effect signals to two separate amps, as well as some unique knobs not seen on any other BOSS pedals before or since.\n\nThough many effects aficionados cite the DM-2 as having superior tone, the DM-3 sounds quite similar to my ears. It’s perhaps a touch less gritty and more refined in the delay repeats, but that can be good in many applications.\n\nBy the late ’80s, digital tech was taking over in the delay world, and the DM-3 was discontinued in the middle of 1988. It was the last all-analog delay pedal in the BOSS lineup for 26 years until the introduction of the Waza Craft DM-2W in 2014.\n\n1985: DSD-2 Digital Sampler/Delay\n\nFor the DSD-2, BOSS took the delay capabilities of the DD-2 and added a phrase sampler function to the mix, which was a novel idea at the time. While samplers had started to hit the scene a bit earlier, they were typically high-cost devices used mainly in studios. True to the BOSS philosophy, they brought this evolving technology to all musicians with the DSD-2.\n\nThe phrase sampler in the DSD-2 could record (or “sample”) 800 milliseconds of audio and play it back one-shot style with a press of the pedal switch. There was also a Trigger input for playing the sample from a drum pad or other external source. While the sampling capabilities were somewhat limited by today’s standards, the DSD-2—and later DSD-3—can be viewed as early descendants of the trendsetting BOSS Loop Station products that would come years later.\n\n1986: DD-3 Digital Delay\n\nAs digital technology became more commonplace, the wholesale prices of electronic components decreased rapidly. This allowed manufacturers to bring less expensive products to the marketplace, and the DD-2 was a direct beneficiary of this trend. However, instead of dropping the price of the DD-2, BOSS decided to replace it with the new, lower-cost DD-3.\n\nOther than minor cosmetic differences, the DD-3 is identical to the original DD-2. And it’s been further enhanced with modern tap tempo control in the recent DD-3T model. With these three pedals, the original stompbox digital delay has been in production for over 40 years! This longevity is a testament to the skill and expertise of the BOSS engineering and development teams, who got it right the first time.\n\n1986: DSD-3 Digital Sampler/Delay\n\nLike the DD-3, which was released simultaneously, the DSD-3 took advantage of plummeting component costs to bring a less expensive version of the DSD-2 to the market. Other than the model names on the cases, the DSD-2 and DSD-3 are essentially the same pedals.\n\n1987: RV-2 Digital Reverb\n\nThe RV-2 was another milestone for the industry: the world’s first digital reverb pedal. Why am I including it here? Because delay functionality is offered as one of its many sound modes. When used in stereo, the RV-2’s Delay mode functions as a panning or “ping-pong” delay, where the repeats alternate between the left and right outputs.\n\nOn a side note, digital reverb is technically a time delay effect; it uses many closely spaced delay repeats and other processing to produce the final sound. However, most musicians think of delay and reverb as individual effect types—and use them in somewhat different ways—so we’re treating them as separate effects categories in this rundown.\n\nWhile we’re talking about the RV-2, it should be noted that it was a significant technical achievement for BOSS in that it used an all-new custom DSP chip developed by the company. Initially designed for the RRV-10 Digital Reverb in the Micro Rack series, this first-generation chip offered unprecedented processing power in a compact pedal. It also pulled a lot of current, so the RV-2 could only run on the supplied AC power adapter.\n\n1987: PS-2 Digital Pitch Shifter/Delay\n\nThough the popular OC-2 Octave pedal had been available since 1982, the PS-2 was the first BOSS pedal with continuously variable pitch shifting. It could be set to one octave up or down or any interval in-between with Manual mode. A dedicated output jack provided a connection for an external tuner (like the era’s BOSS TU-12), allowing the player to fine-tune the pitch interval with the Manual knob. Yes, that’s a little inconvenient by today’s push-button standards, but it was bleeding-edge at the time. In one of its modes, the PS-2 offered up to two full seconds of delay time, another BOSS delay pedal first.\n\n1994: RV-3 Digital Reverb/Delay\n\nThe RV-3 was the successor to the RV-2 and featured more performance gains thanks to a new custom DSP and general improvements in digital technologies. It also cost less and could run on a 9-volt battery. Along with improved reverberation, the delay capabilities were greatly expanded in the RV-3 (so much so that “Delay” was added to the product name). Straight delay with up to two seconds was available, as well as modes that combine the delay effect with the pedal’s four different reverb types. As you can imagine, all these cool capabilities resulted in one wildly popular pedal!\n\n1994: PS-3 Digital Pitch Shifter/Delay\n\nLike the RV-3, the PS-3 incorporated newly developed DSP and current tech to deliver superior performance to its predecessor. While the delay functionality is the same as the PS-2, the pitch-shifting abilities were greatly expanded. The pitch could be shifted up or down over two full octaves, and a detune mode was available to create chorus-like tones. In addition, these functions could be used in a dual mode to create two independent pitch shifts at once. Each could also be sent to separate outputs for stereo operation.\n\n1995: DD-5 Digital Delay\n\nIf you’ve been reading carefully, you probably noticed that the RV-3, PS-2, and PS-3 pedals offer delay times up to two seconds, in addition to their non-delay features. That’s more than double the maximum 800 milliseconds provided by the DD-3, the only dedicated digital delay pedal in the lineup before our current stop. BOSS addressed this performance gap with the DD-5—and added a lot of high-end features too.\n\nAlong with up to two seconds of delay time, the DD-5 offered 11 different delay modes, making it the most advanced pedal delay at the time by far. Reverse delay appears for the first time on a BOSS pedal, and Hold had evolved from the “freeze-style” momentary functionality in the DD-2/DD-3 to work as a simple two-second looper. Tempo-sync delays were also available, with the ability to tap in the time via an external footswitch. Stereo outputs allowed for panning delay or separate direct/effect splits, depending on the mode.\n\nThe DD-5 was a great success, and BOSS originally thought it would replace the DD-3. But the simplicity and great sound of the DD-3 continued to hit the sweet spot for lots of players, and that’s the reason why it remains in the lineup to this day.\n\n2002: DD-6 Digital Delay\n\nSeven years on, the DD-6 updated the DD-5’s impressive feature set with expanded capabilities. First, the max delay was increased to 5.2 seconds (when using long delay mode), and the tap tempo functionality could now be accessed with the onboard pedal switch. The Hold function was also enhanced, with 5.2 seconds of recording time and sound-on-sound overdubbing. Finally, the pedal also provided true stereo I/O. In addition to these feature tweaks, the DD-6 introduced an all-new Warp mode, which produced tape-style pitch and oscillation effects by pressing and holding the pedal switch.\n\n2003: DD-20 Giga Delay\n\nLaunched in 2001, the Twin Pedal series aimed to provide some of the broader functionality of BOSS multi-effects units (extended features, programmability, etc.) while retaining the intuitive, hands-on operation of the stompbox format. Creative musicians widely embraced this approach, and the series soon expanded with additional models.\n\nIn 2003, the DD-20 brought digital delay to the Twin Pedal format, and it quickly became the top choice for players looking for advanced delay features in stomp form. Eleven sound modes provided a variety of delay flavors, including the standard DD-3 style delay, warm BBD analog and tape emulations (including dual-head Space Echo effects), reverse, SOS (sound-on-sound), and more. Warp mode from the DD-6 was also included, as well as new Smooth and Twist modes for unique sounds.\n\nWith a whopping 23 seconds of delay time, a handy LED display, and memories for storing four delay settings in addition to the current manual setting, the DD-20 offered capabilities that put it at the top of its class when introduced—and remain impressive today. The two onboard pedal switches provided easy access to tap tempo, memory selection, and other delay operations, and an external footswitch could be plugged in for additional control.\n\n2007: RE-20 Space Echo\n\nRoland’s Space Echo products from the ’70s and ’80s are considered among the best tape-based delay units ever made and are still highly prized today. Many different models were offered through the years, but the RE-201 Space Echo was the enduring benchmark and most popular.\n\nWith three playback heads, built-in spring reverb, and a distinctive 12-position mode selector, the RE-201 was easy to use and capable of a wide range of creative, organic echo effects. As such, it found a home in many different music applications, from recording sessions to top-shelf concert performances. The Space Echo was also an essential component in the reggae-driven dub sounds created by early electronic music artists.\n\nPart of the Twin Pedal series, the RE-20 employed BOSS’s COSM technology to fully capture the classic RE-201 Space Echo from stem to stern. All the original controls are replicated in the RE-20, along with their real-time behaviors. For example, tweaking the repeat rate while an audio signal is present mimics the unique pitch-shifting behavior of the RE-201’s physical motors as they gradually slow down or speed up the tape loop.\n\nThe RE-20 included many modern conveniences, such as stereo operation and tap tempo control. A Twist function changed delay multiple parameters with a pedal press, making it easy for guitarists to replicate dub-style runaway echo effects. (Similar results are also possible by manually turning the RE-20’s knobs.) And, thanks to the digital design, there was no need for periodic tape replacement and other maintenance hassles!\n\nBOSS revisited the Space Echo sound in later models, most notably with the RE-202 and RE-2 pedals in 2022.\n\n2008: DD-7 Digital Delay\n\nWith the DD-7, the flagship delay in the BOSS compact series evolved over its popular predecessor, the DD-6. The max delay time was increased to 6.4 seconds, and an external footswitch or expression pedal could control functions such as tap tempo, feedback, and delay time. Additionally, Hold mode provided up to 40 seconds of sound-on-sound recording, allowing the DD-7 to function quite capably for looping tasks. The pedal also featured Analog and Modulate modes borrowed from the DD-20. Overall, the DD-7 delivered an amazing amount of delay versatility in one small pedal.\n\n2013: TE-2 Tera Echo\n\nThe TE-2 holds the distinction of being the 100th model in BOSS’s long-running compact series. Embodying the company’s spirit of innovation through the years, the TE-2 delivers a unique ambience effect with a truly distinctive color.\n\nThe TE-2 is one of the first effects to employ BOSS’s Multi-Dimensional Processing (MDP) technology, which continually analyzes the frequency and dynamics of the signal to create a highly expressive playing experience. The Tera Echo sound has elements of delay, reverb, filtering, and pitch modulation, and you can twist the pedal’s knobs to dial up all sorts of sounds, from subtle reverberation to long, swirling ambient washes. Pressing and holding the pedal switch engages a cool freeze function, which holds the effect sound to provide an ambient bed for playing over the top.\n\n2014: Waza Craft DM-2W\n\nSometime after the DM-2 and DM-3 analog delays went out of production in the 1980s, guitarists started to seek them out on the used market as gritty, old-school alternatives to modern digital units. While both pedals are sought after, it’s the DM-2 that’s the most highly regarded, thanks to its warm, grungy delay tone that oozes retro musicality.\n\nOver three decades later, the pedal has returned as the Waza Craft DM-2W. In Standard mode, the DM-2W is a complete replica of the DM-2, delivering the same rich, all-analog tone that made the original such a classic. But BOSS wanted to go beyond a simple reissue, so they added a Custom mode that more than doubles the available delay time to 800 milliseconds while slightly cleaning up the grittiness for more definition and clarity. The pedal can also send dry and effect sounds to two different amps, a feature grabbed from the DM-3. Finally, the delay time can be controlled with an expression pedal, a modern feature not available with the DM-2 or DM-3.\n\n2015: RV-6 Reverb\n\nThe RV-6 is the latest compact series reverb pedal from BOSS, updating the mighty RV-5 that reigned as the industry standard for over 12 years. While its predecessor sounds exceptional, the RV-6 kicks things to new heights, delivering expansive tones equal to or exceeding boutique pedals and studio rack units costing much more.\n\nWhile delay modes were present in the earlier RV-2 and RV-3 pedals, the RV-5 focused on reverb only. Due to many user requests, some delay functionality has returned in the RV-6. In +Delay mode, echo and reverb are blended to create an immense, full sound. As you tweak the Time and Tone knobs, the reverb and delay characteristics are adjusted in multiple ways under the hood, providing ideal tones at every setting.\n\n2015: DD-500 Digital Delay\n\nWith its exceptional 32-bit/96 kHz audio quality, wide-ranging sound modes, and easy usability, the DD-500 is one of the most powerful and versatile stompbox delays ever to hit the market. If you’ve been looking for the delay pedal of your dreams, BOSS has really delivered with the DD-500!\n\nIn short, BOSS has taken everything they’ve learned about delay effects over the decades and dropped it all into the DD-500. It can recreate the sounds of nearly all previous pedals in the BOSS delay lineup, plus classic units like the Roland SDE-3000 and Space Echo. In addition, it’s filled with fresh, modern effects that combine delays with filtering, modulation, pitch shifting, and other processing. You also get 297 onboard memories, deep real-time control, the ability to run two delay effects simultaneously, and much more. In short, the DD-500 does it all.\n\n2019: DD-3T Delay\n\nThe DD-3T updates a longtime BOSS icon with some practical modern features. The sound circuitry and controls are identical to the DD-3, delivering the classic vibe you know and love. But the key addition is tap tempo—an essential for contemporary rhythmic delay effects—which is available by holding the onboard pedal switch or connecting an external footswitch. When tap info is received, up to 800 ms of delay time is available, and the Mode knob sets the tap subdivision. The direct output jack has also been moved to the pedal’s left side for easier connectivity.\n\n2019: DD-8 Delay\n\nThe DD-8 is the latest top-of-the-line delay in the compact series, greatly extending the feature set of its DD-7 predecessor. It offers 11 delay modes, including new Warm and Glitch types and a +RV type that blends delay and reverb together for the first time in a dedicated BOSS delay pedal. Up to 10 seconds of time is available when using the tap tempo function. There’s also a looper mode with up to 40 seconds of mono recording time (20 seconds in stereo).\n\n2022: RE-202 Space Echo\n\nSince its release in 2007, the RE-20 has been well-loved for its expressive recreation of the classic Space Echo sound and vibe. The RE-202 takes things to another level, leveraging the latest BOSS technology advancements to bring the authentic nuances of the RE-201 Space Echo alive like never before.\n\nThe RE-202 captures the RE-201’s vintage magic in flawless detail, from the magnetic tape and motor properties to the vibrant spring reverb and colorful preamp circuit. You can change the tonal character with saturation, tape age, and other variable controls and use the Wow & Flutter control to access all the natural modulation characteristics that are essential to the Space Echo sound.\n\nThe RE-202 includes lots of enhancements for modern musicians and producers. Twice the delay time is available, along with a fourth virtual tape head for more sound combinations. You get true stereo I/O, selectable guitar/line-level operation, and a stereo version of the classic spring reverb sound along with hall, plate, room, and ambience variations. For the dry sound, you can choose between the warm and fat RE-201 preamp tone or a clean signal with zero processing. Numerous control options are also available, including tap tempo, MIDI I/O, and more.\n\n2022: RE-2 Space Echo\n\nReleased alongside the RE-202, the RE-2 provides its big brother’s sound character and essential features in a convenient compact pedal. Seven controls are squeezed into the efficient panel, including the 11-position mode selector plus knobs for repeat rate, intensity, and echo/reverb blend. A Wow & Flutter knob is also included, along with stereo I/O and support for additional control via an expression pedal or external footswitches.\n\n2023: SDE-3000D Dual Digital Delay\n\nWith the SDE-3000D, BOSS delivers not one but two authentic reproductions of the Roland SDE-3000 in a floor-based pedal. As we noted earlier in our journey, the DD-2 and DD-3 designs were based on core DSP tech from that legendary rack unit. The SDE-3000D goes all the way, fully recreating the original’s sound, interface, and graphic spirit while extending its range with many modern features.\n\nThe SDE-3000 features two fully independent stereo delays, flexible internal routing, and expanded I/O for integration with all types of mono and stereo rigs. Modulation and tone-shaping capabilities have been enhanced, and there are 100 memories for storing custom setups. You get a raft onboard and external control options too, including deep MIDI support.\n\n2023: SDE-3000EVH Dual Digital Delay\n\nThe SDE-3000 was the prime delay machine for the world’s finest guitarists, session musicians, and engineers of the 1980s and 1990s. Eddie Van Halen loved it so much that it never left his touring rig, where he used two of the original rack units within his iconic wet/dry/wet stage setup.\n\nCo-developed by BOSS and EVH, the SDE-3000EVH is an authentic recreation of the stereo delays at the heart of Eddie’s massive three-cabinet live stage guitar sound. This special version of the SDE-3000D includes many enhanced features that help you recreate the master’s sound, including eight EVH presets with the settings from Eddie’s units and connectivity options that take the guesswork out of creating wet/dry and wet/dry/wet setups.\n\n2023: DM-101 Delay Machine\n\nInspired by the spirit of the DM-1 from 1978—the very first BOSS delay pedal—the DM-101 takes the analog delay where it’s never gone before. This BOSS engineering marvel combines classic sound with today’s technology, using eight BBDs under smart CPU control to produce a universe of vibey, 100 percent analog tones. There are 12 delay modes—including 6 in stereo—plus modern features like 127 user memories, tap tempo, carryover, MIDI, and more. If you’re a fan of analog delay, the DM-101 delivers an experience like no other pedal can.\n\n2023: RV-200 Reverb\n\nWith the RV-200, BOSS brings a powerful reverb effect to the 200 series lineup. Twelve versatile reverb types provide everything from subtle spatial color to complex, dreamy textures for ambient explorations. Carrying on the tradition that started with the RV-2 in 1992, the RV-200 features a dedicated delay mode. The +Delay type combines reverb with delay, and you can adjust the length of both effects and tweak the delay level with the pedal’s knobs.\n\nA Continuing Story\n\nThroughout this historical review, a common thread is clear: BOSS is constantly innovating, striving to create top-quality effects that support the needs of every musician, from amateur hobbyists to high-end pros ripping it up nightly for audiences in the thousands. There will certainly be more BOSS delay pedals to come, and we’re excited to see what musical magic the team comes up with next."
