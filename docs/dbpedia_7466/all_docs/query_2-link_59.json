        "text": "We would like to provide you with an important update regarding the 2024-25 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSAÂ®) process. This Electronic Announcement provides further details regarding aid eligibility and the post-processing experience for students, institutions, state higher education agencies, and scholarship organizations.\n\nSince the form went live on Dec. 30, more than 3.1 million forms have been submitted. The Department continues to work to ensure students and their families have access to a stable and secure form.\n\nAs part of our continuing commitment to put students first, we will ensure students and their families receive all the aid they are entitled to receive. To account for inflationary adjustments as required under the law, the Department has updated the supporting tables used in the Student Aid Index (SAI) calculation, ensuring that students are benefitting from approximately an additional $1.8 billion in aid. These tables, which directly impact eligibility for need-based federal student aid, detail the allowances against income and assets reported by students and families on their FAFSA form. The revised tables are included in the final Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility Guide. In the coming weeks, our teams will be updating the Federal Processing System (FPS) to include the updated tables. Based upon estimations for completing that work, the Department will begin transmitting batches of FAFSA information (ISIRs) to schools and state agencies in the first half of March, which will include the updated SAI tables. We anticipate catching up with the majority of ISIR transmissions to schools in the weeks following the beginning of ISIR delivery.\n\nWe anticipate that the 2024-25 FAFSA processing timeline will change as follows."
