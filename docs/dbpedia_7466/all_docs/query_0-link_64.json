Recreational fishing for white sturgeon remains open until July 11 under emergency regulations adopted last year. The season officially closed effective July 12, 2024. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife will bring potential white sturgeon fishing regulations to the Commission at its Aug. 14-15 meeting in Fortuna, Humboldt County. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife recommends anglers with 2024 Sturgeon Fishing Report Cards hold onto their cards, and anglers considering purchasing a non-refundable 2024 Sturgeon Fishing Report Card wait until the Commission decides on any regulations that could allow white sturgeon fishing to resume.\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nThe recreational razor clam fishery in Humboldt County has been closed following an advisory from state health agencies that consumption of razor clams in the area poses a significant health threat due to domoic acid exposure.\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nAt 6:00 p.m. on April 8, 2024, the commercial Dungeness crab fishery will close from the Sonoma/Mendocino county line to the U.S./Mexico border (Fishing Zones 3, 4, 5, and 6). Commercial crabbing in the Northern Management Area, from the California/Oregon border to the Sonoma/Mendocino county line (Fishing Zones 1 and 2), will be limited to an area shoreward of the 30-fathom depth contour described in federal regulations.\n\nThe recreational Dungeness crab fishery will continue statewide, although crab traps may not be used from the Sonoma/Mendocino county line to Point Conception (in Fishing Zones 3, 4, and 5).\n\nA Fleet Advisory remains in effect for both the recreational and commercial fisheries, in areas that remain open to crabbing. Crabbers should remain vigilant and avoid setting gear in areas where whales are present, while also following best practices for crabbing with traps (PDF)(opens in new tab).\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nFollowing recommendations from California and Oregon agency representatives and industry advisors, The National Marine Fisheries Service took in-season action to cancel ocean salmon fishery openers that were scheduled to open before May 16, 2024. The sport fishery off much of California had been set to open in early April.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council will meet April 5-11 in Seattle, Washington to adopt final regulations for ocean salmon seasons that will begin on or after May 16, 2024. Of the three alternatives for ocean salmon seasons, two would authorize short ocean salmon season dates and establish small harvest limits for commercial and sport fishing off California in 2024. The third alternative would close the ocean fisheries off California for a second consecutive year.\n\nJanuary 11, 2024\n\nThe commercial Dungeness crab season will open from the Sonoma/Mendocino county line to the U.S./Mexico border (Fishing Zones 3, 4, 5, and 6) on Jan. 18 at 12:01 a.m. A 64-hour trap pre-soak period will begin on Jan. 15, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. The commercial season will open under a 50-percent trap reduction to reduce the entanglement risk for humpback whales. Commercial Dungeness crab vessels operating in Fishing Zones 3, 4, 5, and 6 must understand and comply with the 50-percent trap reduction and other restrictions outlined in the CDFW Declaration of Gear Reduction in the Commercial Dungeness Crab Fishery and Lifting of Temporary Crab Trap Prohibition in the Recreational Crab Fishery Due to Risk of Marine Life Entanglement. The next risk assessment will take place in mid-February, and data from the assessment will inform the potential for modification of the commercial trap restriction.\n\nAlso, the recreational trap restriction will be lifted from the Sonoma/Mendocino county line to Lopez Point, Monterey County, (Fishing Zones 3 and 4) on Jan. 12 at 8 a.m.\n\nA Fleet Advisory has been issued for both the recreational and commercial fisheries, coastwide. Crabbers should remain vigilant and avoid setting gear in areas where whales are present, while also following best practices for crabbing with traps (PDF)(opens in new tab).\n\nDecember 20, 2023\n\nThe commercial Dungeness crab fishery from the Oregon state line to the Sonoma/Mendocino county line (Fishing Zones 1 and 2) will open on January 5, 2024 at 12:01 a.m., with a 64-hour pre-soak period beginning on Jan. 2, 2024 at 8:01 a.m. The commercial fishery in Fishing Zones 3, 4, 5, and 6 will remain delayed. The next risk assessment will take place on or around Jan. 11, 2024, and data from the assessment will inform the potential for modification of the trap restrictions.\n\nThere are no changes in the recreational Dungeness crab fishery. A Fleet Advisory has been issued for both the recreational and upcoming commercial fisheries, coastwide. Once the trap restrictions are lifted, and in areas where traps may now be used, crabbers should remain vigilant and avoid setting gear in areas where whales are present, while also following best practices for crabbing with traps (PDF)(opens in new tab).\n\nDecember 7, 2023\n\nThe temporary recreational crab trap restriction in Fishing Zone 1 (between the California/Oregon state line and Cape Mendocino) will be lifted at 8 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 16, 2023. The recreational trap restriction in Fishing Zones 3 and 4 will continue until at least the next risk assessment. Recreational take of Dungeness crab by hoop nets, crab snares, and by hand is permitted, and traps may be used to take crab outside of Fishing Zones 3 and 4.\n\nA Fleet Advisory has been issued for the recreational fishery, coastwide. Once the trap restriction is lifted, and in areas where recreational crabbers may now use traps, crabbers should remain vigilant and avoid setting gear in areas where whales are present, while also following best practices for crabbing with traps (PDF)(opens in new tab)\n\nThe commercial Dungeness crab fishery in all Fishing Zones (1-6) will remain delayed. The next risk assessment will take place on or around Dec. 21, 2023, and data from the assessment will inform the potential for a commercial fishery opener and modification of the recreational trap restriction.\n\nNovember 17, 2023\n\nCrab Trap Restrictions, Commercial Dungeness Crab Seasons - CDFW is expanding the temporary crab trap restriction to Fishing Zone 1, between the California/Oregon state line and Cape Mendocino, due to the presence of humpback whales and the potential for entanglement with trap gear. The recreational trap restriction for Fishing Zone 1 will go into effect on Sunday, Nov. 26, 2023, at 6:00 p.m. and will continue in Zones 1, 3 and 4 until at least the next risk assessment. Recreational take of Dungeness crab by hoop nets, crab snares, and by hand is not affected by the temporary trap restrictions, and traps may be used to take crab outside of Fishing Zones 1, 3 and 4. A Fleet Advisory has been issued for the recreational fishery, coastwide. Once the trap restriction is lifted, and in areas where recreational crabbers may now use traps, crabbers should remain vigilant and avoid setting gear in areas where whales are present, while also following best practices for crabbing with traps (PDF)(opens in new tab).\n\nCDFW has also delayed the commercial Dungeness crab season opener south of the Sonoma/Mendocino county line (Fishing Zones 3, 4, 5 and 6) due to the presence of high numbers of humpback whales feeding in the area, and the risk of whales becoming entangled in crab trap gear. The commercial season has also been delayed in Fishing Zones 1 and 2 in Northern California because the crab are not yet ready for market, according to the annual pre-season meat recovery test results. The northern California season opener will be delayed until at least 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 16, 2023, pending another round of meat recovery testing.\n\nWhite sturgeon - Emergency regulations are now in effect that reduce the number of white sturgeon that can be kept to one per year, reduce the slot limit to 42-48 inches, and cap the number of white sturgeon that can be possessed on a vessel at two per day. In ocean waters, and in San Francisco and San Pablo bays, the season remains open year-round with the exception of a long-standing, seasonal closure area in San Francisco Bay(opens in new tab) (closed from January 1 through March 15). However, the sturgeon season will close from January 1, 2024 to May 31, 2024 upstream of the Highway 50 bridge on the Sacramento River and Interstate 5 bridge on the San Joaquin River.\n\nNovember 9, 2023\n\nCDFW has closed the recreational razor clam fishery in Del Norte County after state health agencies determined that consuming razor clams from county beaches poses a significant health risk due to domoic acid exposure.\n\nOctober 27, 2023\n\nCDFW has delayed the use of crab traps in the recreational Dungeness crab fishery along the coast between the Sonoma/Mendocino county line and Pt. Lopez, Monterey County (Fishing Zones 3 and 4). Recreational take of Dungeness crab by other methods, including hoop nets and crab snares, is not affected by the temporary trap restriction, and traps may be used to take crab outside of Fishing Zones 3 and 4. CDFW has also delayed the commercial Dungeness crab season opener south of the Sonoma/Mendocino county line (Fishing Zones 3, 4, 5 and 6).\n\nBoth delays are due to the presence of high numbers of humpback whales feeding in the area, and the risk of whales becoming entangled in crab trap gear. A Fleet Advisory has been issued for the recreational fishery, coastwide. Once the trap restriction is lifted, and in areas where recreational crabbers may now use traps, crabbers should remain vigilant and avoid setting gear in areas where whales are transiting or foraging, while also following best practices for crabbing with traps (PDF)(opens in new tab).\n\nRelated Information"
