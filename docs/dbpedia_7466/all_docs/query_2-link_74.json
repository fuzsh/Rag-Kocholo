        "text": "Introduction\n\nPatients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks and an occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) have a 5% to 6% risk of developing stroke per year (Klijn et al, 2001). In those with compromised cerebral blood flow (CBF) this risk is even higher, approximately 9% to 18% per year (Grubb et al, 1998; Vernieri et al, 1999; Klijn et al, 2000). For therapeutic decisions, it is therefore important to be able to identify patients with hemodynamic compromise who are at high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. Numerous techniques have been developed that are capable of assessing CBF in vivo, such as positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT) perfusion, dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single photon emission tomography. In clinical practice, bolus passage CT perfusion and gadolinium-based MR perfusion imaging are the most widely used (Wintermark et al, 2005), as PET facilities are limited. Because of the current concerns regarding the use of ionizing radiation and morbidity after contrast-enhanced studies in patients with renal insufficiency (Sadowski et al, 2007; Penfield and Reilly, 2007), a noninvasive alternative for in vivo assessment of CBF would be of great benefit.\n\nArterial spin labeling (ASL) is an MRI technique that can noninvasively assess CBF by magnetically labeling the arterial water spins with a radiofrequency pulse (Williams et al, 1992; Detre et al, 1992; Edelman et al, 1994; Golay et al, 2004). In clinical studies, it has been used to assess perfusion in neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, central nervous system neoplasms, and vascular malformations (Wolf and Detre, 2007). However, a disadvantage of ASL-MRI is that in patients with cerebrovascular disease, the quantification of CBF is hampered by the recruitment of additional blood flow through collateral pathways (Liebeskind, 2003). These alternative pathways of blood flow lead to a delayed arrival of the labeled blood bolus to the brain (Gibbs et al, 1984; Alsop and Detre, 1996; Calamante et al, 1996). As most ASL-MRI techniques acquire the labeled images at a fixed time after the initial labeling of arterial blood, it is possible that the magnetic label may not have reached the imaging plane, leading to underestimation of CBF. Recently, ASL-MRI with acquisition of a series of images at increasing delay times after the initial labeling has been introduced as a method to compensate for such blood transit delays. Although researchers have previously compared the results of ASL-MRI to established perfusion imaging techniques (Ye et al, 2000; Pell et al, 2003; Floyd et al, 2003), no such verification has been performed with ASL-MRI at multiple delay times.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of CBF measurements with ASL-MRI at multiple delay times in patients with a symptomatic carotid occlusion by comparing these to CBF measurements acquired with dynamic H215O PET measurements. We compared quantitative values of CBF in mL/min/100 g tissue and qualitative CBF estimates, expressed as an ipsilateral to contralateral ratio, for different brain regions.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study demonstrates that CBF measurements obtained with ASL-MRI with acquisition of images at multiple delay times are correlated with quantitative CBF values derived with H215O PET in patients with a symptomatic occlusion of the ICA. The observed correlations differed between brain regions and were the best in the flow territory of the MCA. Furthermore, ASL-MRI was capable of depicting decreased CBF in the gray-matter of the MCA in patients with a symptomatic occlusion of the carotid artery similar to H215O PET, although an overall systematic overestimation of CBF relative to H215O PET was noted.\n\nIn an increasing number of institutions, ASL-MR perfusion imaging techniques are being added to the clinical MR protocols for routine assessment of CBF (Deibler et al, 2008a, 2008b). Earlier studies have validated the various ASL techniques in both healthy volunteers and patients, and have applied the technique to assess cerebral perfusion in a wide range of neurologic diseases (Ye et al, 2000; Donahue et al, 2006; Koziak et al, 2008). Using a steady-state ASL strategy, one study found comparable CBF measurements in 12 healthy subjects when compared with H215O PET (Ye et al, 2000). In a study of 11 patients with an ICA occlusion, others found a significant correlation (r=0.71) between CBF measurements obtained with a continuous ASL-MRI technique and steady-state O15-labeled CO2 PET (Kimura et al, 2005). In the latter study, a possible underestimation of CBF in the affected hemisphere in 5 of the 11 patients was reported, because of longer transit times of the blood flow arriving through collateral blood flow pathways.\n\nBy performing multiple ASL experiments at increasing delay times between labeling and image acquisition, the accuracy of perfusion quantification in tissue with spatially variable tissue times can be enhanced (Gunther et al, 2001; Petersen et al, 2006). Using pulsed ASL with multiple small flip angle gradient echo readouts, in a similar manner as in the Look-Locker technique used for fast T1 mapping (Look and Locker, 1970), it is possible to measure the kinetics of the labeled blood and calculate CBF in a single scan. Earlier, in a study of 10 subjects, it was shown that an ASL strategy at multiple TI with and without vascular crushers (QUASAR) provided data that correlated well with DSC-MRI results (Knutsson et al, 2008). Other techniques have also been introduced to circumvent these problems associated with variable transit times for both continuous and pulsed ASL. For pulsed ASL, in which perfusion is assessed at a single inversion time point, sequences such as QUIPSS and QUIPSS II with thin-slice TI1 periodic saturation (Wong et al, 1998; Luh et al, 1999) have been introduced. To minimize effects of varying arrival times, these incorporate saturation pulses into the sequence to obtain sharply defined bolus profiles. A disadvantage is that with a fixed delay between tagging and imaging, flow may possibly be underestimated when the transit times are too long. For continuous ASL, in which labeling is performed during a few seconds at one plane, insensitivity to transit delays can be increased by using a pre-delay between the continuous labeling and the readout (Detre et al, 1998).\n\nAlthough we found a significant correlation between ASL-MRI and H215O PET CBF measurements, higher absolute CBF values were found with ASL-MRI. This overestimation by ASL-MRI is consistent with earlier studies comparing ASL-MRI with image acquisition at a single inversion time to PET (Ye et al, 2000; Kimura et al, 2005), which in those studies was attributed mainly to intravascular signal. Although water is a highly diffusible tracer, it has been shown that with ASL-MRI, even when longer postlabeling delay times are used, label may still be present in the (small) feeding arteries, leading to an overestimation of CBF (Ye et al, 1997). Another possible explanation could be related to the CBF measurements derived with PET in this study. The H215O PET method used in this study was based on the assumption that delay and dispersion of the arterial blood timeâ€“activity curve between brain and radial artery was the same throughout the brain. In patients with an obstruction in the arteries feeding the brain, as seen in our patient population, and subsequent collateral blood flow through primary and secondary collateral vessels, this may not hold true, leading to a potential underestimation of CBF in comparison to the contralateral hemisphere.\n\nIn this study we found that the relation between the ASL-MRI and PET CBF measurements varied over the different flow territories of the cerebral arteries. The absolute differences in CBF were the largest in the flow territory of the posterior circulation. This may be caused by the course of the posterior cerebral arteries. The P2 segment distally from the posterior communicating artery runs almost parallel to the axial ASL-MR imaging slices. As a result, the diffusion of labeled blood into the brain may not yet be complete with label still being present in the vasculature. The perfusion model, however, assumes that labeled magnetization of inflowing blood has fully diffused into the tissue. This may lead to relatively higher CBF values in the posterior circulation when compared with brain tissue supplied by the ICA, which runs perpendicular to the ASL-MR imaging slice.\n\nOur study showed a relatively low CBF in the MCA territory of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion when assessed with ASL-MRI using interhemispheric comparisons of CBF. In a healthy brain, it can be assumed that the perfusion-like contribution coming from remaining intravascular spins may be equal for both hemispheres, as the vasculature is roughly identical on both sides. However, our study indicates that when a ratio between hemispheres is used in patients with a carotid artery occlusion to estimate hypoperfusion, ASL-MRI may overestimate the difference between the symptomatic and contralateral hemisphere in the gray-matter of the MCA. The difference in CBF ratios between ASL-MRI and PET was less in the flow territory of the ACA and PCA. We hypothesize that when using interhemispheric ratios, brain tissue with higher amounts of intravascular label, such as the gray-matter of the MCA territory, is more prone to error.\n\nA potential limitation of our study is that we used a Look-Locker-like small flip angle gradient echo sampling strategy to acquire the series of images at increasing delay times after labeling. Although this significantly decreases scan time, making it more practical for clinical use in patients, the train of RF pulses during the readout decreases the perfusion signal. Because of this signal loss, and the natural T1 decay of the magnetized blood, we refrained from the use of crusher gradients. Crusher gradients can be used to dephase the moving spins to eliminate the signal from the large arteries. However, despite the possible overestimation of CBF because of not using crushers, there was a significant correlation between the ASL-MRI CBF measurements and the H215O PET CBF measurements. An additional limitation of the study may be the 7 days between the ASL-MRI and H215O PET examination and that both scans were performed under different environmental conditions (i.e. silence versus loudness MRI, possibly leading to a higher CBF in the auditory cortex). To control for the difference in time from symptoms to investigation, the order of both investigations were randomized.\n\nIn conclusion, CBF values obtained with ASL-MRI at multiple delay times correlated significantly with H215O PET, although there was a systematic overestimation of CBF by ASL-MRI. This overestimation shows that for quantitative use, ASL perfusion images should be interpreted with caution, especially when literature cut-off values for hemodynamic impairment are used which are based on other methods, such as H215O PET CBF. Still, the relative values of the ipsilateral to contralateral hemisphere in our patients with ICA occlusion are comparable to these values obtained with H215O PET. Therefore, we conclude that the noninvasive ASL-MRI measurements of perfusion are useful to depict the presence and extent of areas with hypoperfusion in the vascular territory of the middle cerebral artery in patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion."
