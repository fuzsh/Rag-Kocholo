German native Jan Delay mixes the modern and the old school, an amazing combination. Unique vocals and mixed beats make his live performances super fun. I've been to other concerts where members of the audience are fearful or just seemingly uppity, they don't want to get up from their seats. It's sad when this happens.

However, at Jan Delay shows - it's never a problem. Everyone gets up and moves from the beginning til the very end. I absolutely love it when Jan incorporates an American hit into his show and does some medleys.

He's got some phenomenal background talent to add to the experience as well. I find my eyes and ears occasionally migrating to the back-up singers. This is not to say I wouldn't enjoy Jan alone, but the accompanying singers do highlight and add to rather than take away from the main act.

Even though he is from Germany I find it incredibly interesting and even rather mind-boggling how his natural accent seemingly dissipates into nonexistence when he does a hip-hop jam or a reggae groove. I guess it's true that music is a universal language. I find his song Oh Johnny a throwback of classical soul and blues even though I am not able to understand all of the lyrics. It's just a really upbeat and catchy tune. I love anything with the use of a lot of horn instruments.
