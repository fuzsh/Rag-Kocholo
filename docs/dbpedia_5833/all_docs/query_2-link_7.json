        "text": "kibbutz, Israeli collective settlement, usually agricultural and often also industrial, in which all wealth is held in common. Profits are reinvested in the settlement after members have been provided with food, clothing, and shelter and with social and medical services. Adults have private quarters, but children are generally housed and cared for as a group. Cooking and dining are in common. The settlements have edged toward greater privacy with regard to person and property since the formation of Israel in 1948. The kibbutzim, which are generally established on land leased from the Jewish National Fund, convene weekly general meetings at which the kibbutz members determine policy and elect their administrative members.\n\nThe first kibbutz was founded at Deganya in Palestine in 1909. Others were created in the following years, and by the early 21st century there were more than 250 kibbutzim in Israel, their total population numbering more than 100,000. The early kibbutzim in Palestine were actually kevuẓot; these were relatively small collectives that gradually evolved into the larger and more extended collective community known as the kibbutz. The kibbutzim played an important role in the pioneering of new Jewish settlements in Palestine, and their democratic and egalitarian character had a strong influence on early Israeli society as a whole. The kibbutzim still make contributions to Israel’s economy and leadership that are disproportionately large when compared with the kibbutzim’s relatively small share of the country’s population."
