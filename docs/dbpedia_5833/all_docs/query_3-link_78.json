His seriousness, responsibility and love for the neighborhood created a deep and unbreakable connection. “In 1984 he traveled with a delegation of young people to visit Poland, and his experiences and impressions of the difficult journey through the concentration and death camps were immortalized in terms of photography and painting. He was connected to his family, proud of them and a source of pride for them, he wrote to his parents on their wedding day: “Thank you for everything. The combination of demand and pushing for coping and independence, but also constant attraction to a warm home, helps and encourages.

His letter of condolence to the bereaved family was written by his commander R. “At the beginning of his career, he was prominent in his quick grasp and his ability to explain sophisticated communication systems in an intelligent manner and, of course, to the last of the soldiers. His talent, thoroughness and infinite investment ability made Amiram an excellent liaison officer. Above and beyond the professional qualities, Amiram was the man – a cute boy with a child’s face and an irresistible smile. The optimism inherent in his character and his willingness toHis former commander, Moshe Ya’alon, wrote: “Amiram, one of the people I would choose to serve with them in the army, to live with them on the kibbutz, or even on a desert island.” His family published a booklet in his memory, “The love of man, the land and its landscapes, the taking of unlimited responsibility and dedication, and great human sensitivity and sensitivity – all these were the answers of Amiram and his family, friends and commanders. Amiram to the question of the meaning of his life. “"
