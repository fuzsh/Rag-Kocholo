        "text": "The kibbutz is a modern day phenomenon – a collective community unlike any other in the world. Predominantly based amongst beautiful landscape settings dotted around Israel, the kibbutzim and kibbutz members (kibbutzniks) are open to visitors, offering a wide variety of attractions whether you’d like to stay a few hours or spend a few months.\n\nThe events of October 7 severely affected Israeli society as a whole and in particular the surrounding kibbutzim which suffered an unimaginable blow. Along with the horrors, the stories of the heroism of the kibbutz emergency squads, the courage of the residents, and the commitment of the kibbutzim all over Israel to aid the affected kibbutzim and the society in general, are a ray of hope. As of the writing of these lines (February 2024) there are a total of 44 evacuated kibbutzim, 25 in the south and 19 in the north.\n\nOn each of the kibbutz web pages, we tried to briefly present the events that took place and update the list of hostages from each and every kibbutz. In this period of rebuilding, the connection to the kibbutzim and the spirit of support is needed more than ever and we here at KibbutzVisit are striving to make accessible to you the beauty and the enormous treasures that the kibbutzim and the kibbutz life have to offer."
