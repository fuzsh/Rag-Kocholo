        "text": "Our rooms are separated into two houses and there are two kinds of rooms. One kind sleeps two people and the other, slightly bigger, sleeps three.\n\nEach room consists of a small kitchen that includes a fridge, microwave, kettle, and kitchenware.\n\nEach room has two toilets and one shower.\n\nParticipants are in charge of cleaning their rooms. Cleaning supplies are provided.\n\nYou will receive a monthly allowance for your meals. Full meals can be bought at the “Heder Ochel,” the main dining hall or you can purchase snacks or cooking ingredients at the shop on the kibbutz. The dining hall is closed on Shabbat, so you must fast on this day…just kidding! ;))) On Shabbat, you can practice your cooking skills. You can buy ingredients in the local shop using your monthly meal allowance.\n\nAll other expenses such as transportation, personal consumer goods, etc. are the participant’s responsibility.\n\nYou will receive a monthly allowance for your meals.\n\nMeals are provided in the kibbutz dining hall as follows:\n\nTuesday, and Thursday – Three meals a day.\n\nMonday and Wednesday – Two meals a day. Lunch is served at the dining hall, but for dinner you take the food from the dining hall as “Takeaway”.\n\nFriday – Brunch and dinner are served at the dining hall.\n\nOn Shabbat the dining hall is closed.\n\nHebrew Ulpan takes place three days a week from 7:45 – 15:15.\n\nThere are two class levels: 1st and 2nd grade. Upon your arrival, you’ll be assigned to the class that best fits your level.\n\nWork takes place twice a week. Hours depend on the type of work you’re assigned to. The different work roles are: factory, dining hall, bakery, farm, and gardening.\n\nThe afternoons and evenings are your spare time where you are free to do as you wish! You can enjoy the kibbutz facilities such as the gym, swimming pool (in the summer months), pub, and more. There are also kibbutz events which you’re welcome to join and take part in.\n\nKibbutz Ulpan across all the Kibbutzim is the same price and costs $6,500 for the full five months. This cost includes: Ulpan classes, housing and meals (unless stated otherwise in “Meals”), and guided tours and activities operated by Kibbutz Ulpan.\n\nAs a Masa Israel-sponsored program, you may be eligible for a Masa grant that may cover up to 50% of the program tuition. Contact us to find out more!\n\nEin Hashofet is located near the city of Yokneam. There is a bus that runs several times a day between the kibbutz and Yokneam. There’s also a central bus station in Yokneam where you can hop on a bus to go almost anywhere in the country."
