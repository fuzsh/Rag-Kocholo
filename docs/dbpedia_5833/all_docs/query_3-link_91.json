        "text": "Reggae legend to also perform in Megiddo on August 15; Ravid Plotnik and Ehud Banai’s Kav Achorei (Back Line)\n\nReggae legend Burning Spear, who will play a concert in Tel Aviv on August 14th, has now added a Megiddo show to his Israel tour.\n\nHe will perform at outdoor concert in the Isaac Ochberg Park in Megiddo. Two well-known Israeli artists will support him — Ravid Plotnik and Ehud Banai with his new band, Kav Achorei (Back Line).\n\nAs I wrote previously, 78-year-old Burning Spear only returned to touring last year, after a 20 year hiatus. Born Winston Rodney, Burning Spear is considered one of the founders of roots reggae. He began recording music in 1969 and gained initial fame in the 1970s with albums like âMarcus Garvey,â âMan in the Hills,â and âSocial Living.â His deep, commanding voice combined with politically and socially conscious lyrics made him a reggae icon and favorite of Bob Marley.\n\nRavid Plotnik is a rap and hip-hop artist. He has been performing since the age of 15, when he founded the band Produx. Since then, he has recorded and released seven albums. His most recent record is Toch Kedei Tenua (While Moving), released on Nana Disk in 2021.\n\nKav Achorei is a new project of Ehud Banai. He is one of the Banai brothers, famous in Israel for their music.\n\nEhud Banai formed his first band in 1982. Since then he has recorded and performed on over a dozen albums. He describes Kav Achorei (Back Line) as “folk, punk-acoustic and dub.”\n\nTickets available from NIS 264.\n\nThe Venue:\n\nIsaac Ochberg Park is named for the South Africa businessman, philanthropist, saviour of Jewish children and Zionist visionary.\n\nAll Trails describes Ochberg Memorial Lookout as:\n\nOchberg Memorial Lookout is an impressive and special memorial site, located in Ramot Menashe between Ein Hashofet and Ramat Hashofet. At the site is a scenic lookout spot offering views of a large area in Ramot Menashe and Kibbutz Dalia.\n\nIt is named for Isaac Ochberg who was born in Uman in 1878 and died at the age of 59 in Cape Town, South Africa. Yitzhak visited Israel in 1926 and was a delegate to the 1929 Zionist Congress in Zurich, bequeathing a quarter of a million pounds to the JNF in his will which was a huge sum in those days. With his money, the lands of the nearby kibbutzim Dalia and Gilad (1945) were purchased."
