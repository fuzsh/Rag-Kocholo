        "text": "Small communities called Kibbutzim faced atrocities during the attack by the terrorist organization Hamas on October 7, 2023.\n\nThe Kibuzt is a peaceful, agricultural community, where resources are shared, not privately-owned, and decision-making is collective.\n\nAll of the Kibbuztim are located within the pre-1967 border, recognized by the international community as the State of Israel.\n\nHere’s more about this one-of-a-kind communal model:\n\nThe kibbutz is a uniquely Israeli phenomenon with a significant cultural legacy and an important role in the nation’s history. But from urban and rural planning perspectives, it is a unique, one of a kind, model.\n\nIn the heart of Israel, amidst the vibrant blend of ancient history and modern innovation, lies a unique social and urban experiment known as the Kibbutz. Founded in the early 20th century, these communal settlements have not only shaped the nation’s social fabric but also introduced innovative urban and rural planning principles that promote sustainability, community living, and a car-free, pedestrian-friendly environment. In this blog post, we will explore the essence of a Kibbutz, its urban planning principles, and the factors that make it a haven for those who seek a harmonious, sustainable way of life, far from the city.\n\nWhat is a Kibbutz?\n\nA Kibbutz is a collective community in Israel that embodies principles of socialism, egalitarianism, and self-sufficiency. The term ‘kibbutz’ is derived from the Hebrew word “kibbutzim,” meaning “gathering” or “group.” These intentional communities have their roots in the early 20th century, as Jewish pioneers sought to create a new way of life in the land of Israel. Kibbutzim were established as agricultural communities, where resources were shared, and decision-making was collective. Over time, they evolved to include various industries such as manufacturing, technology, and services.\n\nThe Kibbutz is a remarkable model of communal living and sustainable urban planning that has stood the test of time. Its emphasis on equality, environmental stewardship, and a car-free, pedestrian-friendly environment resonates with those seeking a harmonious, community-oriented way of life. While Kibbutzim have evolved over the years, they continue to inspire us with their innovative approach to social and urban development. These intentional communities provide valuable lessons on how to foster a sense of community while also caring for the environment."
