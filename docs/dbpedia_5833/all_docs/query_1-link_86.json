        "text": "As has become something of a tradition for me, I had the privilege to visit 10 synagogues in Los Angeles during the most recent High Holy Days. I experienced the many voices of Los Angeles and of the Jewish community that come together at this time of year.\n\nVisiting a veritable minyan of shuls during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur was an inspiration. As L.A. is the most diverse and vibrant city I know and love, so too are its Jewish communities. I found inspiration at each and every congregation, along with lessons to reflect upon — and a little something special in every synagogue and temple. They are, indeed, voices in a great chorus.\n\nThe voices of conscience at Temple Isaiah — Since its founding, this West L.A. congregation has made social action a priority. This year was no exception, with an always-poetic Rabbi Zoe Klein reminding us of our obligations well beyond the walls of the synagogue. Among Isaiah’s social action and tikkun olam projects are its Green Team, Gun Legislation Advocacy Committee, Community-Supported Agriculture project and interfaith partnerships — such as pulpit exchanges with L.A.’s venerable First African Methodist Episcopal Church in the West Adams district.\n\nThe voices of a wandering people at Temple Beth El of San Pedro — Yes, there are Jews in San Pedro. And, in fact, a historic and vibrant community. This year, as the shul undergoes a major remodel, the members of Beth El experienced a small taste of our forebears’ wandering. There were services at Dodson Middle School in Palos Verdes, at the First Presbyterian Church in San Pedro and in Beth El’s own construction-zone sanctuary. There was also tashlich in the park, Shabbat Shuvah at White Point Nature Preserve and Sukkot at the South Coast Botanic Garden. Rather than diminish the sense of rootedness, this year’s wandering appeared to me to strengthen the feeling of community among L.A.’s portside Jews.\n\nThe voices of the congregation at Temple Beth Am — At the start of the Hineni prayer — led by the ba’al tefilah at this La Cienega Boulevard shul — all those assembled in the sanctuary were asked to hum along. The collective voice of hundreds of people humming provided a most spiritual and resonant accompaniment to the chazzan’s prayer — and we all became part of one giant choir. The second day of Rosh Hashanah also was punctuated with the voices of Rabbi Adam Kligfeld and Rabbi Ari Lucas, who together presented a sermon in three parts: offering an exchange of letters between Abraham and Isaac, and giving voice to a modern day midrash.\n\nThe voices of a new generation at Stephen Wise Temple — It’s a year of new leadership at what’s sometimes referred to as the “shul with the pool” on Mulholland Drive. Rabbi Yoshi Zweiback becomes the congregation’s new senior rabbi this month, succeeding Rabbi Eli Herscher, who first came to Stephen Wise in 1975. The ever-youthful Nathan Lam, who has served as cantor since 1976, continues to share his beautiful voice while training and helping to shape new generations of cantors.\n\nThe voices of diversity at Adat Ari-El — The information table leading into the sanctuary of this Valley Village synagogue is overflowing with fliers for events and programs of every kind. There are the services, of course, but also a diverse panoply that includes movies, dances, magic shows, bluegrass/Jewgrass (did you know there was such a thing?), a “Fiddler on the Roof” singalong, social action groups, LGBT programming and an aptly-named “Multi-Interest Day.” Something for everyone. Inside the sanctuary, Rabbi Jonathan Bernhard brought a perfect balance of seriousness and levity to a Yom Kippur afternoon.\n\nThe voices of tradition at Valley Beth Shalom — VBS has been led by some of the greatest contemporary rabbis, orators, writers and thinkers. That tradition continues today through Rabbi Ed Feinstein and Cantor Herschel Fox. The European-born Fox has, for more than two decades, shared his knowledge, talent and Yiddishkayt. He is both the voice of a nearly departed generation and a voice of contemporary Judaism — a real treasure. It was my honor and a thrill to join him on the bimah to sing together a duet of “L’dor Va’dor” — a prayer “from generation to generation.” Great traditional musical classics of chazzanut need never go out of style.\n\nThe voices of remembrance at Temple Aliyah — Yom Kippur is an opportunity to reflect — and to remember. It was at Yizkor — the memorial service — that I joined Temple Aliyah in Woodland Hills to remember the voices that now dwell only in memory — including that of my mother, who died this year. How I wish I could hear her voice again, and how vital it is that we take the time individually and as a community to remember the voices of the past.\n\nThe voices of the “Shtenders” at Temple Ramat Zion — “Shtender” is a Yiddish word for the podium used in synagogues to support a book or other reading material for prayer, study or speaking. At Northridge’s Temple Ramat Zion, the Shtenders are also a musical trio that lend their voices to the holiday services. It’s volunteers like the Shtenders who literally and figuratively support and hold up their congregation — and its congregants in shuls everywhere who make the holidays more meaningful by lending their voices to the services, reading from Torah — and more.\n\nThe voices of women at B’nai David-Judea — This year, B’nai David-Judea in the Pico-Robertson neighborhood became the first Orthodox shul in L.A. to announce that it was appointing a woman to serve as a spiritual leader and member of the clergy. Alissa Thomas-Newborn has been serving as an intern at the congregation in the role of morateinu (which means “our teacher” in Hebrew). She took to the bimah to deliver one of this year’s High Holy Days sermons — as she prepares to receive her ordination from yeshiva with the title of maharat (which is a Hebrew acronym for a “female leader of Jewish law, spirit and Torah”). May she become an ever more welcomed voice.\n\nThe voices of sages at Temple Israel – On Yom Kippur morning, I was inspired not only by the prayers but by a selection of readings of great poets, rabbis, philosophers, authors, leaders and even a noted Mexican ventriloquist. Add to that the margins in the Hollywood temple’s High Holy Days prayer book, which feature fascinating scholarly notes and commentary on the prayers. It’s a machzor filled with wisdom and the voices of the sages.\n\nThe voices of home at Temple Akiba — While I was a visitor at 10 synagogues for the Yamim Noraim, I came home at shul No. 11: Temple Akiba in Culver City. I also must admit to being most biased in loving this congregation and its rabbi, Zachary Shapiro — to whom I happen to be married. Having spent 20 years as the chazzan at a congregation in Montebello, I enjoy doing a bit of singing with Akiba’s mellifluous cantor, Lonee Frailich. With Akiba having just completed a major reconstruction project, the good rabbi reminded us of the cycle of life: “To build, to take down and to build again.” In every congregation, and in each of our lives, there is no greater task than joining our lives, our communities and our voices — together.\n\nI can’t wait to return, and I am looking forward to visiting many more synagogues — and L.A.’s many other communities of faith — in the year to come.\n\nRon Galperin serves as the city controller of Los Angeles."
