        "text": "What is a kibbutz, anyway?\n\nThe word “kibbutz” (plural “kibbutzim”) means “grouping” or “gathering” in Hebrew. In a nutshell, it’s a community where people voluntarily live and work together on a noncompetitive basis. The first kibbutzim were organized by idealistic young Zionists in the beginning of the 20th century. Despite many hardships, they succeeded in creating a social system and a way of life which has played a crucial role in the development of the State of Israel.\n\nOver the years the kibbutzim have multiplied, prospered, and adapted themselves to changing realities. This means that some of the kibbutzim have changed their ideological foundation and have undergone a process of “privatization.” A privatized kibbutz is still a community that shares and lives together, but the various work branches have been turned into cooperatives that earn their own wages and make their own profits.\n\nToday, some 270 kibbutzim varying in size from 80 to over 2,000 people are scattered throughout Israel. With a total populace of around 120,000, they represent about 2.8 percent of Israel’s population. Most kibbutz members work in some section of the kibbutz economy or in one of its maintenance units. Routine jobs, such as dining room duties, are rotated among members. When too few members are available for a particular job, outside workers may be hired and paid wages or given room and board on the kibbutz.\n\nWho is a “kibbutznik”, and will I be considered one by the locals?\n\nKibbutzim, like any other society, are made of individuals who are all different from one another. Some members of kibbutz identify strongly with the pioneer spirit that founded the kibbutz. Many others, if not pioneers themselves, are the children of those pioneers who are now grown up and have families of their own. They are called “sabras,” or people who were born in Israel. (An etymology that will give you a sense of Israeli character: “sabra/tsabar” literally refers to a type of cactus fruit, which is hard and prickly on the outside yet sweet and tender on the inside)\n\nMany kibbutz members, however, do not fit this stereotypical image. Lots of “kibbutznikim” (plural of “kibbutznik”—a resident of a kibbutz) look more or less like people from your hometown. They may, in fact, even come from a place like your hometown! Many members of kibbutz are “olim” (immigrants) from foreign countries such as the United States, Australia, South Africa, Ethiopia, Russia, or many countries around Europe. Hebrew may not be their native language, but they all speak Hebrew, as it is the primary language spoken in Israel.\n\nSome older members of kibbutzim were true pioneers in the early days of the founding of the state. Try meeting someone who was a founding member of the kibbutz in which you’re staying and ask them to tell you stories about the early days of the kibbutz. It is a great way to practice your Hebrew and learn some Israeli history at the same time!\n\nThe Kibbutz Ulpan participants are another significant group living on the kibbutz, but no, you won’t be considered a “kibbutznik” by the locals.\n\nWhat distinguishes a participant from a “chaver” (full member) of the kibbutz?\n\nFirstly, the participant lives on the kibbutz temporarily. Secondly, members have voting privileges that give them a say in the issues of kibbutz life; participants do not take part in that.\n\nFinally, members are eligible for a full use of all facilities on the kibbutz, while participants may not have access to certain facilities. This varies from kibbutz to kibbutz.\n\nAs a Kibbutz Ulpan participant, remember that you are a guest in the home of the kibbutznikim.\n\nBecause you come from a different culture, you may view the grounds and facilities of the kibbutz differently than the members. For the kibbutz members, the entire kibbutz is home rather than only a house with four walls. Take the kibbutz dining hall, for example. To the participant it looks like a cafeteria, which is a public space. However, kibbutznikim see it as a dining room, which is private.\n\nParticipants are essentially guests in the home of the kibbutznikim, and you should be respectful of that fact just as you would if you were visiting a friend in his or her house."
