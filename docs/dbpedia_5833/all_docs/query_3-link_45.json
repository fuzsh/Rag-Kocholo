She encourages students to embrace their imagination and learn to think outside of the box to solve problems. The students explore different artists, experiment with different art mediums, and learn how to understand and appreciate art through a Jewish lens. Suzanne has taught art at Temple Emanuel for fifteen years. She received her MAT in Communication Arts from Webster University and graduated with a BFA in Graphic Arts and a BSBA in Marketing from Washington University. Her goal is to provide all students with an educationally challenging, yet fun, experience in the art room.\n\nSarah Burk\n\nKindergarten & 1st Grade Teacher\n\nSarah is happy to be teaching again at Temple Emanuel.

Although I am retired now, I worked for about 40 years teaching and caring for children 6 weeks - 9 years old. I was also a clinical social worker, including at Jewish Family & Children’s Service, for children, families, and adults. One of the most meaningful experiences I have had was an opportunity in 2015, provided by a grant from the Jewish Federation of St. Louis, to help mentor Israeli Arab teachers in an Israeli Arab bilingual Arabic-English preschool that had just begun as a pilot project. I am delighted to return to teaching Hebrew at TE this year.\n\nMeghan Platke\n\nTE Tots Teacher\n\nMy name is Meghan Platke and I am so excited to be joining the Temple Emanuel team!
