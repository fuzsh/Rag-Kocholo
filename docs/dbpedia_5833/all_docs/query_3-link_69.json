        "text": "(draft chapter 12 of memoir project entitled “Diary of an Ocean Lover”)\n\nW e quickly learned how keen Israelis are to news reports. Riding the buses and walking along the sidewalk, we could hear loudly and distinctly top of the hour newscasts by Israel State Radio. In Israel, news usually has immediate and life and death impact to everyone. Bus drivers and storeowners consider it their duty to relay the broadcasts. Walking the street at the top of the hour with Israel State Radio amplified from every store, you didn’t miss one word of the broadcast.\n\nWe had arrived in the days of a tense military campaign, Operation Litani, when all Israelis had their ears tuned in to every word on reports from the northern border in Lebanon. Back in the States before our flight, I had casually monitored news from the Middle East. I knew the Israeli Defense Forces or IDF had crossed into southern Lebanon to drive the Palestinian Liberation Organization from the border in response to an attack by a small group of PLO men and one woman. After landing their zodiac boat on the beach at Kibbutz Mishmar Haemek, between Haifa and Tel Aviv, they murdered 32 Jews on their way into Tel Aviv before all were killed by Israeli military.\n\nNever for a second did I consider canceling our trip. Chalk it up to my confidence in the Israeli military and my understanding, or lack of it, that such military actions are part of daily life in Israel. But mostly, it was due to my propensity for risk-taking at that still early stage in my life. It was all part of the adventure! At the Tel Aviv youth hostel our first night in Israel, we watched state television anchors reading off the names and photos of IDF soldiers killed.\n\nI really hadn’t thought about what I was going to do in Israel other than explore it on my own, which might include some weeks as a kibbutz volunteer. I had heard about the kibbutz ulpan, a six-month program many kibbutzim offer to attract potential new immigrants, including many college students who came from all over the world. Ulpan typically meant about three hours of Hebrew study and five hours of work for free room and board. I was well versed in prayer service Hebrew learned by heart from years of Synagogue attendance and religious school leading up to my Bar Mitzvah. But my Hebrew was not conversational.\n\nMany young American Jews who came to Israel on their own plan trips through their Jewish youth groups. I had never been in a youth group. Or they found a shaliach,an Israeli emissary, at their local Jewish Federation office. I spoke to a shaliach at the L.A. Federation, but never followed up on it.\n\nThe next morning, our second day in Israel, Patti and I somehow found the office of the Shomer Haatzair Movement, the Zionist and politically progressive youth movement allied with the Labor Party and responsible for much of the immigration to pre-Israel Palestine. Shomer Haatzair and other early movements, including another large one called Habonim, helped found the early kibbutzim and continued their relationship with them through the birth of the state and beyond.\n\nI answered the few questions asked by the Israelis in the Shomer Haatzair office, who routinely approved my request for the ulpan at Ein Hashofet. Only later did I understand the magnitude of Israel’s interest to impress young Jews, especially Americans, with good experiences of Eretz Yisrael, the Land of Israel, in the hope of adding fresh Zionistic energy to the country. Israel offers all Jews from around the world a “The Right of Return”. The Hebrew verb for gathering in Israel from the Jewish diaspora is aliya, or “to go up” (to Jerusalem).\n\nA new ulpan at Ein Hashofet or “Spring of the Judge” (former Chief Justice Louis D. Brandeis in fact) was to begin in another week. This was perfect. It would give Patti and I a chance to travel together on our own before her plane was to depart for Los Angeles. We decided to visit the kibbutz the next day, check in with the ulpan director, settle into a room, then set off traveling about the country.\n\nReturning to the Central Bus Station the next morning, we found the Egged bus to Kibbutz Ein Hashofet, some 100 kilometers north of Tel Aviv in a forested region named Hare Menashe or the Menashe Mountains. To be accurate, these are not mountains, at least the scale I was used to as a Californian, but heights. Bus #826 departed at 10:30 a.m. with its last stop at Ein Hashofet. At least that was the route and time it departed in June of 1978. I don’t remember this by heart, but recalled it from my journal.\n\nIsrael is a small country, smaller than Southern California, and 100 kilometers north of Tel Aviv already puts you in Northern Israel, not far from Haifa, second largest city to Tel Aviv. The #826 made many stops and took more than two hours to reach Ein Hashofet. But it mattered little how long it took. While I felt pressure in my life to settle down and “grow up”, there was still time for that, even at 28 when it seemed that most of my peers had already done so. I may have been adrift, but I also had a deep drive to find myself. Now in Israel, time had a very different value. I was not going to miss this opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nReflecting now, I see how the tension I felt from the pressure to start a career with that of finding my true identity caused so much angst. I refused to comply with outside expectations, particularly from our Dad and his perspective of what it meant to be an adult. I was aware at a fundamental level how he and other grown-ups were not happy. I was anxious about finding my place in the world. I was quite self-conscious and concerned that maybe the voices of authority were right that I wouldn’t amount to anything. But I also surprised myself at a few critical moments in my youth when I saw flashes of truth and acted on them.\n\nI casted off the briefcase our Dad had tried to force me to carry my books in beginning fourth grade. I conveniently lost the wristwatches he gave me as gifts. I went barefoot on the streets of Beverly Hills in high school against his utter disgust. I left home for a week at 17 without telling them. It came natural to my character and an act of defiance. And thank God I discovered surfing. It taught me a valuable lesson, that even into the chronological age of adulthood I could maintain the healthy fun of youth. I know now why it took me so long to mature compared to most other young men. I put off finding my place in a crazy upside down world and traction in any career until I figured out who I was and how I could enter and cope in it.\n\nEgged buses are strong and dependable. Israel used this vast fleet in times of military action to move soldiers to the borders. They may still do. At the time I arrived the fleet was not new. They were not air-conditioned. The windows slid open manually. I took a window seat in order to enjoy everything I could see. I recall the smell in the air and the sky crystal clear. Once out of Tel Aviv, the land resembled Southern California. Breaking free from the Tel Aviv outskirts, we hugged the Mediterranean coast and I got glimpses of the northern beaches. I had been spoiled by California and its beautiful beaches. Here, they looked workaday, plain, flat, mere splotches of sand, some littered. This stretch along the Mediterranean lacked the drama of the California seascape. No waves, at least none with the power of the Pacific. No cliffs carved into the shore. The most this coast could offer was small hilly sand dunes with tufts of weeds.\n\nLess than an hour from Tel Aviv, the bus turned away from the coast. My heart opened wider to welcome the adventure. The countryside rolled slowly by. I took note of the small towns we pulled into, the white stone and concrete aqueducts etched through the farmland and the faces of the people getting on and off. We passed slowly through Hadera, a mid-size Israel city and transportation hub in the center of Israel. From there, the road rose steadily away from the coastal plain. We passed small plotted valleys and rocky hillsides scattered with small white cobblestone ruins.\n\nThis was my first glimpse of relics from antiquity scattered and embedded all over the land in different ways and forms. Back home, the old California adobe structures, including the famous California missions, go back at most 250 years. But here, ancient structures in one state of condition or another link to prior epochs, biblical times, more than several millennia ago. I was beginning to feel like I really was halfway around the world in a very different land, the one I had heard so much about from the time I was a boy, with a heartfelt link to a holy ancient past.\n\nWe reached Zichron Yaacov, a tidy well-off town in the open green hills high above the road. The air was slightly cooler and I thought this might be the stretch leading directly to the Menashe region and the kibbutz. But we soon descended back down to an inland road that followed a wadi, an Arabic word I would soon become familiar with. Wadi describes a small valley, ravine or dry channel. My eyes searched in vain for a sign of water in it. My mind defaulted to green ravines, rivers and lakes.\n\nThe bus turned at Eliaqim, a cooperative farming community, onto a wide and busier road that leads to the edge of the Menashe Heights. Stretched directly ahead were wheat fields. How strange and wonderful to have a public bus scheduled several times daily linked directly to such an out of the way place, or so it seemed. We soon pulled into the entrances of several kibbutzim, Ramot Menashe and Dayla. As we stopped at each, I thought we had arrived at Ein Hashofet. At last, we pulled past its front gate and a large swimming pool behind trees at the bottom of a shady ravine. At last, we came to a stop and we grabbed our things: Patty her small suitcase, me, my backpack.\n\nIt was early afternoon and very quiet. No one was around. The grounds were serene, bucolic. One or two-story boxy white concrete buildings circa 1940s and 50s stood behind green gardens with stone pathways. This first sight was far from my expectations — clusters of log cabins laid out on a few hundred acres like summer camp. The reality was much more pleasant.\n\nWe met a young woman named Susan from Canada who had been on the ulpan that had just concluded. She led us to the doorsteps of the ulpan director’s office. He was out. So we walked back to the swimming pool where we met another ulpanistwith long hair named Marc. He talked about his experience on the ulpan, painting a dark picture critical of its director named Moise Fishbein. We walked back to his office and waited, eager to be shown our quarters where we could rest and begin to absorb everything we had seen after arriving in Israel a few days before."
