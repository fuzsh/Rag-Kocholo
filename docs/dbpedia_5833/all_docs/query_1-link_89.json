Such negotiations would inevitably take into account the large variations among settlements, which range from small clusters of mobile homes to well-constructed urban neighborhoods with several thousand inhabitants. This study makes an initial attempt at examining the issue by presenting an index of settlement permanence, that is, a summation of factors that would be obstacles to settlement dismantlemept. Using this index, we have divided the 184 settlements into four categories of 'permanence.' Almost 70 percent of the settlements fall into the lowest fifth of our scale. At least theoretically, these could be removed at relatively little cost and inconvenience. This memorandum was prepared by Geography Division, Office of Global Issues . The information contained herein is updated to 1 February 1985 Comments and questions may be addressed to Chief, Near East Branch, Geography Divison 25X1 25X1 *158 residential West Bank settlements, 11 East Jerusalem neighborhoods. and 15 sites of other Jewish civilian land use. 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/07: CIA-RDP85T01058R000304040001-5 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/07: CIA-RDP85TO1058R000304040001-5 25X1 Permanence of Israeli West Bank Settlements Many observers, both proponents and critics, maintain that Israeli West Bank settlements are now too numerous and too entrenched to permit their dismantlement, and that their continued expansion is an irreversible process. According to this argument, these settlements are distributed in such a way that no lines could be drawn to divide the territory without creating unacceptable Jewish enclaves. Examination of individual settlements, however, presents a different picture. Each settlement has unique demographic, construction, economic, historical, and locational characteristics that affect its potential permanence. Clearly, the many settlements that resemble small, hilltop, mobile home parks could be more easily removed or relinquished than the large apartment complexes around Jerusalem. If the less substantial settlements were dismantled, Israel probably would: ? Appease many local Arab landowners, each of whom, although concerned about the entire settlement scheme, is primarily interested in the fate of the particular settlement on his traditional village lands. ? Create much larger areas occupied solely by Arabs. ? Demonstrate willingness to negotiate in good faith with concerned parties. 25X1 The obstacles to dismantling any given settlement can be roughly quantified. We developed a 0-100 scale of \"permanence\" (appendix A), with 0 denoting an insignificant degree of permanence and 100 denoting an extremely high degree. This scale considered structural, population, and historical/locational factors (tables 1 and 2). In the West Bank, 74 settlements (about 45 percent) fall below 10 on our scale. These include 30 unpopulated sites, of which 13 have experienced no construction beyond initial site and road clearance. These sites that scored below 10 account for only 7 percent of West Bank settler population, and would be by far the easiest to remove. Another 49 settlements, containing 16 percent of the area's population, fall between 10 and 20 on the scale. Removal of these two least significant groups of settlements would clear many -)t the hilltops in the heavily Arab- 1 popu ated areas of Samaria am! Judaea. Settlements that score(] )ver 20 on the scale are the sites with larger populations, more solid residences, and, in many cases, historic/strategic importance. Many of these settlements fall within areas of Labor's 1967 Allon Plan (Jordan Valley, 'Ezyon Bloc, East Jerusalem). About 15, however, are large bedroom communities established in Samaria by the Likud Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/07: CIA-RDP85TO1058R000304040001-5 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/07: CIA-RDP85TO1058R000304040001-5 government between 1977 and 1984. All of the East Jerusalem neighborhoods scored above 40, as did 13 large settlements that house 55 percent of the West Bank settlers. Examination of the individual components of the settlement network suggest that it is not necessarily too late for territorial compromise based on dismantlement of at least some settlements. Although dismantlement of settlements is an emotionally charged, politically sensitive issue, at least half of these \"facts on the landscape\" would probably present a minimal physical impediment to a negotiated peace that calls for their removal.

A settlement's score for each characteristic was determined by summation of the weighted sub- components. This total was then multiplied by a constant so that the maximum score possible for each section--33.3--corresponded to twice the average of all settlement scores in that section. The score for the first characteristic is based on a count of structures (both dwellings and nondwellings) weighted by size, type, and function (table 1). In counting agricultural and industrial buildings, some adjustments were made to account for the economic viability of the settlement. Scores for the second third of the scale--population--were based on the number of adults in each settlement, weighted by ideological commitment of the settler group, when applicable. A \"stubborness factor,\" providing greater weight to religious settlers and to Gush Emunim members, was applied, because of their greater ideological opposition to displacement. We counted only adults, noting that the number of children would have little role in the decisionmaking process. The final section was a combination of five historical and locational elements important in any consideration of abandoning West Bank territory. Our scale awarded points to settlements if they were religiously significant, if they were established on pre-1948 Jewish-owned land, if they were set up before 1977 within the bounds of Labor's Allon Plan, and if they had military importance (location in the Jordan Valley or on the overlooking ridge). Finally, each site was assigned points that reflected its distance from the Israel-Jordan Armistice Line of 1949 (Green Line). The methodology used in this study is imprecise, but was designed for ease of data gathering and manipulation. We believe methodologies that might more precisely consider actual costs of dismantlement and other factors would essentially yield the same results.
