        "text": "In recent years, a well-preserved Roman-period road network was explored in southern Moab, descending the steep topographic gradient from the Moabite plateau to the south-eastern Dead Sea region. This network comprises three paved roads—Kathrabba, Kuniyeh and Zoar Ascents—installed according to Roman principles of road construction, sharing features such as minimal width of 4 m, kerbstones and retaining walls, built steps and paved sections. All roads were forced to overcome vertical height differences of 1200–1500 m over a short distance as well as high sub-vertical segments of Nubian sandstone cliffs and massive plutonic rock outcrops. The starting point for all roads was in the southernmost part of Moab, in the vicinity of the modern village of Mu’tah, and they led to three different points along the eastern coast of the southern basin of the Dead Sea. The article explores the geographic and structural traits of the newly discovered road system and delves into its historical context and significance. We argue that this meticulous, labour-intensive enterprise was most probably associated with the decades following the Roman annexation of Nabataea in 106 CE, and more specifically with the suppression of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, during which Jewish communities on both sides of the Dead Sea revolted against Roman rule.\n\nThe Romain paths or roads offer a very interesting archaeological material, because they allow us to understand the history of human settlement and are also factors that increase territorial identity. Roman roads are one of the hallmarks of the Roman empire, which extends to North Africa. The objective of this investigation is to attract the attention of researchers of the importance of Roman roads and paths, which are found in Algeria, according to the quality of the materials and techniques used in this period our history, and to encourage other decision makers to protect and enhance these routes because the current urbanization, intensive agricultural practices, or simply forgotten, decreases the sustainability of this important historical heritage. Keywords—Romain paths, material Materials, Property, Valuation.\n\nThe arrival of the Romans at the Lower Danube and transforming this area into the Roman province of Moesia inferior lead to a radical change of the landscape. A wide space is occupied and organized by the army resulting in an imperial province located by the border. This operation is carried out gradually - an expression of policy of \"small steps\" practiced by the Romans - over several stages, military organization, including - fortifications, roads, construction annexes along the roads, points of customs stations-, being doubled by civil measures in order to integrate in the new administrative body the pre-Roman and the newly emerged settlements, together with the Greek cities from the Black Sea Coast. One of the main elements in roman organization of the territory is the roads network. The proper roads are absent from the pre-roman landscape, they were rather some access routes. Their lines and directions can be reconstructed based on the information gathered from archaeological sources: researched or only identified in the field settlements and necropolis provide us valuable data for this. The Romans “modernized” them and also constructed new ones in order to assure a good communication between the limes area and the inner part of the province, but also with neighboring territories. The first action in this regard is recorded in the time of Augustus and his followers, but who really establish an integrated system of roads in the area is Trajan. He laid the foundations for the road system in Lower Moesia. After his conquest of Dacia the limes stretches all the way to the mouth of the Danube. Gradually appearing new branches filled out the communication network. The coast road was also modernized at this time and a road parallel to the limes started to be constructed. Trajan’s successor started on the construction of the central road through Dobrudja. In the form that will be designed by Trajan, to which are added the interventions of Hadrian, the road system will keep the same organization until the end of Antiquity."
