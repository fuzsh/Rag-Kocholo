        "text": "by Yael Adar\n\nEin Shemer is a Kibbutz that was established by Ha’Shomer Hatza’air immigrants, (from Poland). Later immigrants followed from Egypt as well as other countries. Most people know the kibbutz (which is located near Hadera about fifteen mile/ kilometers east of Caesarea) for its Old Courtyard – a place where you can get a sense of what kibbutz life was like, years ago.\n\nThe newer lesser-known attraction that the kibbutz offers is a reconstructed (diesel engine) oil press whose beginnings can be traced to the early 20th century in Jaffa. The press was later in the Arab village of Kabatiyeh in Samaria for the next twenty-five years. Kibbutz member Ran Hedvatti found the oil press (which was being discarded) and spent many long months dismantling and reconstructing it in a structure that was built to house it, in the Kibbutz. The press has only been operational on the kibbutz for about a year\n\nDuring the Olive Harvest season the kibbutz offers tours of the oil press, regrettably only to groups of 20 or more. On the plus side, those who do attend get to really ‘get their hands dirty’ as it were, and take part in the oil extraction process.\n\nThe Old Courtyard offers a variety of activities (this is a great place for kids and adults). You can visit the museum, learn about the life of the early pioneers.“Little-Big Pioneer” is a good 12 minute audio visual program that presents the life of a kibbutz member Arie-Lieb, bake rolls (in the restored flour mill), take a tour of the kibbutz on a tractor, or ride a restored 1915 Turkish train, all in addition to visiting the oil press.\n\nEin-Shemer’s pricing is based on the number of activities one chooses.There are also meal options that can be added.\n\nIndividuals who wish to visit should note that they would most likely only be able to see the museum and the courtyard. There may be an option to join a group. However, it is best to call ahead and find out exactly what is available to individual travelers.\n\nDirections: Ein-Shemer is located on Route # 65, turn south at the Menashe junction.\n\nTEL 04-637-4327\n\nVisiting Hours: Sunday - Thursday 7:30 AM – 4:00 PM, Friday and holiday eves 7:30 AM – 1:00 PM. Saturdays – call for information.\n\nEin Shemer is a Kibbutz that was established by Ha’Shomer Hatza’air immigrants, (from Poland). Later immigrants followed from Egypt as well as other countries.
