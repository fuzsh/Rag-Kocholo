        "text": "𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲, Fall in Israel, 𝘆𝗮’𝗹𝗹 – 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 social media 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝘂𝗽 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗲𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗙𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝗽𝗶𝗰𝘀, 𝗽𝘂𝗺𝗽𝗸𝗶𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗽𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴! It’s my favorite time of the year, and the time I get some serious homesickness for all things FALL!🎃🍎🍂\n\nFall Vibes in Israel?\n\nIf you’re looking for those Vermontesque Fall foliage photos, you might be a bit disappointed. We don’t really have all things FALL over here, so every year I pretty much live through all those Instagram FALL pics. But, if you really look hard enough – and get lucky with the weather – you might just find some of the IG worthy moments.\n\nBest time to see Fall Foliage in Israel\n\nAlthough summer seams to linger throughout September and some of October in most of the country, if you head up north, you’ll experience cooler weather and Fall vibes. But if you’re looking to see those gorgeous red-orange colors, you might have to wait a little longer. The best time to see any Fall foliage is from mid October – mid November. And sometimes even into late November – early December.\n\nWhere to Find Fall Foliage in Israel\n\nThe best places to find fall foliage in Israel is of course in the north – but where, specifically? The Metula area has some great areas for seeing the leaves change colors as well as the Upper Galilee, Judean Mountains, Gush Etzion Valley, and even the Jerusalem Hills.\n\n5 Activities That Will Have You Falling Hard for Fall in Israel\n\nHorseback Riding at Megiddo\n\nSaddle up! One of the best ways to see those gorgeous Autumn leaves is to jump on a horse and head out into the backwoods. You’ll not only experience the open roads like never before, but you just might see some Fall colors popping up around. We had a great experience at Dubi Ranch in Ramot Menashe. They have various options available for trail rides, taking you out into the Megiddo Forest.\n\nCarving Pumpkins\n\nIf there’s one sure way to help you fight the Fall-time blues, it’s pumpkin carving. We might not have trick-or-treating – or Halloween for that matter – but that doesn’t mean you can’t light up your life with a few jack-o-lanterns. We get pumpkins every year, and carving them has become one of favorite family traditions.\n\nWhen we lived in Tel Aviv, I used to get pumpkins from the weekend market in the Tel Aviv port (north Tel Aviv). They have larger pumpkins and gourds available, but prepared to pay a hefty price for one!\n\nAnd now that we live outside the city, we get our pumpkins from Moshe’s Farm in Risphon. Every year he harvests hundreds of pumpkins to be sold at markets around the country, but he will also let you come to the farm and buy some from him. We’ve been going to Moshe since Mia was a baby.\n\nTIP: Get creative with your carving experience. Lower your expectations and know that you might just need to settle for a smaller pumpkin to carve. We’ve even carved gourds that turned out cute!\n\nApple Picking in Israel\n\nHow about them apples? Another tried and true way to living apple-y ever after is by going apple picking. September is a great time to go apple picking, and there are several places in the Golan such as Bustan Bereshit that offer picking opportunities as well as tractor rides, apple pie workshops, and more!\n\nBustan Bereshit is located about 2km north of Kibbutz Ein Zivan\n\nPelican Migration in Israel\n\nDid you know that half a billion birds cross the skies of Israel every Fall? They make their annual flight to the south and make a quick layover in Israel. Although it’s not your typical Fall activity, it’s truly a spectacular sight to see! Cranes and pelicans can be spotted at Lake Hula in the Galilee region and also at Emek Hefer in the Sharon region.\n\nYou can usually find them at the end of October, but unfortunately, they don’t give us a heads up on their arrival time. The best way to know when they arrive is by keeping tabs of the Hula Reserve around that time – they usually have streaming videos to watch.\n\nPumpkin Spice and Everything Nice\n\nSo, not to burst your bubble, but NO – we don’t have pumpkin spice lattes here in Israel. (moment of silence for us, please!) BUT, I have a solution for you! And it will require a little bit of work, but if you’re like me, it will be worth it!\n\nHomemade Pumpkin Spice Latte\n\nSome things are just worth the extra work. And in my case, I need my pumpkin spice latte in the Fall!\n\nHere’s a recipe that will have you feeling sweet as pumpkin pie!\n\n2 cups milk (dairy or non-dairy)\n\n2 tablespoons pumpkin puree\n\n1 to 3 tablespoons sugar\n\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n\n1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice\n\n1/2 cup strong hot coffee\n\nWhipped cream\n\nDirections:\n\nAdd milk, pumpkin puree, and sugar and heat on the stove on medium. Heat until hot, but do not boil. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla, pumpkin pie spice, and the coffee.\n\nMakes two mugs. Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice.\n\nTIP: You can find cans of pumpkin puree at Meatland in Raanana. It’s a supermarket that carries American and international foods. I also bring pumpkin pie spice back with me from the US so I always have a supply with me.\n\nFREE It’s Fall, Ya’ll Captions & Content Worksheet\n\n𝗜’𝘃𝗲 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗮 FREE 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝗙𝗮𝗹𝗹, 𝗬𝗮’𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗳𝘂𝗻 𝗙𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, 𝗾𝘂𝗼𝘁𝗲𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝗙𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝗜𝗚 𝗽𝗶𝗰𝘀.\n\nSo if you’re Falling Hard for all things Fall like I am, go grab it!\n\nBe-leaf me – you’ll be filling up your captions in no time!🍃\n\nAnd yes, I did add some throughout this post to give you an idea of how unbe-leaf-able it really is! 🍁\n\nGo ahead and grab it!"
