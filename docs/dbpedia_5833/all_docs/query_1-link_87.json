        "text": "Low-lying regions throughout the Netherlands face considerable challenges in maintaining adequate water reserves for agriculture. However, the government has initiated a program intended to improve drought resistance.\n\nThe Delta Program is a collaboration between the national government and provincial and municipal authorities to ensure sufficient freshwater supply, with the aim of achieving that goal by 2050. The program provides funding for research, pilots, and infrastructure, along with guiding policy on water supplies.\n\nIts methods include careful evaluation of local conditions within communities at risk of drought. From there, they recommend potential solutions that allow for more efficient use of water supplies, water reclamation, and other measures to allow for self-sufficient communities.\n\nThis major project has invested €400 million in funds since its inception in 2015. By 2027, an additional €800 million is expected to be invested in practical solutions for ensuring resilient freshwater supplies throughout the country.\n\nThe Netherlands and other countries in the European Union are subject to European Commission guidelines on safe water reuse for agriculture. Water reclamation from municipal and industrial wastewater is a vital part of any drought prevention plan, and communities need technologies that meet those standards to ensure health and safety.\n\nThe guidelines lay out a framework for risk management, permitting, monitoring, and implementation of water reclamation programs. It also prescribes guidelines for specific contaminants such as nitrates, microorganisms, pesticides, and more.\n\nCommunities will have to ensure that their water reclamation solutions follow these guidelines. The EU’s Water Reuse Regulation comes into effect in June 2023 and will make these guidelines a matter of law that will be enforced."
