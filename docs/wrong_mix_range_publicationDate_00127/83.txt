Jonathan Lethem is the bestselling author of twelve novels, including The Arrest, The Feral Detective, The Fortress of Solitude, and Motherless Brooklyn, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award.

His newest book is Brooklyn Crime Novel (October 2023), a sweeping story of community, crime, and gentrification, tracing more than fifty years of life in one Brooklyn neighborhood, and its Black, brown and white inhabitants. Novelist Namwali Serpell called it, “A deeply moving, fiercely intelligent, and acerbically funny novel about the scandal and disaster of American capital in our time.”

Winner of a 2005 MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship, Lethem has been proclaimed “one of America’s greatest storytellers” (Washington Post).
