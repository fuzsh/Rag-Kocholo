        "text": "Jonathan Lethem is seemingly unstoppable. Over the past 30 years, the author has written on subjects ranging from science fiction to the civil rights movement, dystopias to noir, tough-talking kangaroo gangsters to superheroes that exist in the real world today.\n\nNo author has been able to jump from one subject to the next with such seamless ease quite like Lethem, the Roy E. Disney Professor of Creative Writing and of English at Pomona College in California. In the past, Lethem has earned such notable honors as a MacArthur Fellowship in 2005, and the National Book Critics Circle Award for his novel, “Motherless Brooklyn,” which was also named the Novel of the Year by “Esquire.”\n\nIn a previous interview, you mentioned wanting to move out to California for a while before you actually managed to. Why exactly did you want to go out west and leave New York?\n\nLETHEM: I think over the years, having lived on the East Coast and the West Coast, I’ve become kind of a student of the differences in the way cultural stuff signifies on the two coasts. I think New York City is a place that was shaped and defined by waves of immigrant experience, much of it different versions of European exodus — and then it turns a corner and stops really being so much Western European, but in its bones it’s like a European city or a place that’s straddling the two realities, and it brings with it a lot of new possibility and also brings with it a lot of hangovers from Old World notions. And then the idea of the Westward Expansion, which one must always now make sure to note is not into “blank space,” but is now part of what’s called “settler colonization,” both from individuals who wanted a patch of land and the individuals they took that patch from, often murdering them in the process. But still, there is this dream with all kinds of magical components. This idea that “freedom is out there to the West,” freedom from imperialism or religious totalitarianism or kings or popes or whatever, and that results in a lot of sense of possibility that defines the cultural reality of the United States. And it’s still there. You know, you can see it being reenacted in my coming of age not just in reference to older migrations, but with Kerouac and Ginsberg leaving college and the hierarchical powers of the Ivy League world and just going out and throwing that all away in favor of the road and San Francisco and this myth of hope and possibility. So that was something that still was in me. I came of age in the counterculture. It’s why the reference to the Beats is so relevant for me. The definition of our cultures were very anti-cosmopolitan. Even as I was a New Yorker, I was kind of proud to be a part of the Melting Pot and the crazy, vibrant, vernacular energy of the streets which I reflect in my books about Brooklyn, but I was also part of the hippie dream which is consonant with this idea that the real world revolves around living in the country and that cities are kind of run by corrupt, decadent elites. And I was susceptible to this, too. I was a New York kid and I wanted to get out of the city. And I was a college dropout. I was very anti-institutional. I inherited that from my parents in certain ways. My father had been a college professor and then rejected it in favor of political protest and painting and working as a carpenter. My mother, who was a brilliant intellectual in many ways, still one of the best readers I’ve ever known in my life and who informed in a lot of ways who I am as a writer, she dropped out in the middle of college. So I had a powerful legacy of “drop out to become who you are.”\n\nYour bibliography covers a lot of topics and genres. What has been the most challenging subject matter you’ve written about?\n\nLETHEM: The answer happens to be the one I am enmeshed in right at the moment and it’s that of the legacy of gentrification and race relationships in the neighborhood I grew up in and the city I was formed by. I had to build up my capacity as a writer and my courage as a person to write “The Fortress of Solitude” and doing that was incredibly meaningful to me and it was exhausting because I was taking on legacies of “witnessing” in my own experience. And I didn’t know what everything meant, I only knew it was embedded in my body as experience and I was trying to measure that. You see that a little in “Motherless Brooklyn,” which is a relatively free fantasy and a love letter to my neighborhood in Brooklyn, but because it takes the form of the hard-boiled detective story, it has the allegorical freedom to be my own personal riff on that experience. But then, that opened the door to “The Fortress of Solitude” material which is the real turbulent part of what I know as a person coming of age in a place that was very hard to apprehend fully even while you were right there on the ground doing so. It was so paradoxical, so beautiful and so confusing and so turbulent and so divided. And I wrote that book and I was very proud of how much I had contended with and was able to give a name to the feelings I was feeling. And it exhausted me and I ended up avoiding that in some respects until right now, when I am really writing about that time and place again directly. The only exception in-between is that I sort of did like an historical analogue to it in “Dissident Gardens” in writing about my mother’s generation coming of age in Queens rather than Brooklyn, and writing to an extent about the civil rights era. And that was a challenging book to write. That one required a lot of historical research because I was writing about stuff I wasn’t such an intimate witness to, but it did and it didn’t represent the continuation of the confrontations I had made with my own witnessing in “The Fortress of Solitude.” What I am writing now is a return. I am really going back to do a kind of “Fortress of Solitude” .2 in certain ways, and that’s the hardest work I’ve ever done. But I am exhilarated by hard work when I can locate it. I always want to be on that outer edge of my own capacities. The work that’s meant the most for me to do — and it isn’t only this kind I’m describing — is also work that was formally new for me. I had to figure stuff out on the fly. But that’s exciting. As an artist, you lie in wait, waiting for your biggest material to captivate your whole talent, and I feel lucky that this is happening again.\n\nDo you outline or pre-plan at all when it comes to writing?\n\nLETHEM: I’m a great believer in discovery. For me, that’s the principle description I would give it. Improvisation sounds like something actors do on stage. For me, setting out on a writing project, what I have are intuitions about what I might mean and usually a few really charged set pieces or situations or images or characters that already mean something to me, but I don’t know what it is. But I’m interested in them and I want to explore them and discover their meaning and unpack it. Not knowing everything is good, because that’s what life is like and that’s what your characters are going to undergo, trying to figure out what the situations they’re in mean, so I’m exploring it in a kind of a day to day uncovering — I want to tell this story, I think it’s funny and interesting to have a guy who has Tourette’s syndrome end up going to a Zen Buddhist retreat, but what am I getting at? What’s this scene going to do? What does it imply? What next scene does it make necessary? I really love that sensation of discovering. Sometimes I’ll be in a portion of the planning of my work where I have to do a certain amount of notetaking — like I’ve got a bunch of ideas in my head and I don’t want to forget them, or I can’t quite figure out which scene should go before another one, so I’ll do a little bit of mapping or organizing. I wouldn’t call it outlining, because outlining sounds like an overall project and I mostly try to avoid that. But I do local problem-solving in notes and sometimes visual diagrams, just putting things in order. For the book I’m doing right now, I have a lot of note cards with different scenes on them because I had to think about which scenic moments came before others and it seemed like they were modular, so I wanted to be able to move them around. So, you know, there’s some planning work, but the fundamental experience I have is everyday going to know and enjoy that I’ll be uncovering something I can only figure out by writing it out.\n\nDo you ever have trouble blending elements of surrealism or magical realism with the real world at all, as you are known for doing in your work?\n\nLETHEM: First of all, I started off in the visual arts. I made drawings and paintings and cartoons before I wrote prose, and I loved surrealistic things. I loved comics and cartoons. My father was a painter filled with observational reality with imaginative elements. I don’t think he would call himself a surrealist, but he is an expressionistic painter and his work changes a lot, but it seems to always involve things observed by the eye and things that the eye has never seen. So I just took this as a given. I never felt stress about it, and instead, I felt like “Oh, it generates stress in a lot of readers. Well, that’s interesting.” That itself was something I could get interested in — what if I could reduce the amount of fantastic in the work? In “The Fortress of Solitude,” it’s just one flying ring in this totally mimetic, almost documentary description of New York City — but there’s this ring that can make you fly. What would that do? Well, the answer freaks out the reader too. That’s an interesting effect. This tension, this conflation, that to me feels so basic. I’ve never thought of it like magic realism in any way. That term has always irritated me because I don’t really believe it’s components. Realism is a very problematic term for art, because your realism and my realism might not agree, and usually realisms from the past look very artificial, like they’ve excluded a lot of things. It’s only realism when we think it’s realistic. And then you add the magic and it sounds to me like there’s a fanciful element like someone has taken some realism and sprinkled a little magic over it. And I don’t think that’s the combination that interests me. Instead, I feel like there’s more an innate surrealism in experience. Consciousness itself creates disjunctive effects, in waking and in being. And we manage these by smoothing the edges down and creating a consensus reality and that itself is a very effortful process of exclusions. And I don’t mean exclusions of the fact that “UFOs are real” or Satan is actually trying to affect our daily lives. Who needs a UFO? Language is a totally slippery, magical, crazy substance. Consciousness, the brains we carry around with us that are taking the tangible world and trying to organize it into a series of ideas or operations or projections. We live in this world enlivened by the magical force of language and consciousness, and that’s just for an individual, nevermind when you try and collectivetize and make a society and try to get everyone to agree. In talking about America at the beginning of this conversation, I had to keep specifying that I have been living inside something that we all live inside — the projected fantasy and what it means to be this in this American Dream. It’s like a science fiction project. “Let’s go to a planet where no one has ever existed and create freedom.” It’s a total science fiction story. So this is something I’m trying to analogize with my surrealism, is the way life and consciousness won’t sit still for anything remotely deserving of the title or the descriptor “realism.”\n\nIs it ever at all challenging writing from the perspective of someone whose viewpoint or life experiences is radically different from your own?\n\nLETHEM: Well, the answer is always yes, of course, and what’s interesting is that the nature of the question, which has arisen for me from the beginning of my publishing life, has changed. My feeling about it and the importance of getting things right and how you proceed in the attempt hasn’t altered that much, but the necessity of describing one’s sense of this has changed dramatically. I’m 57, and when I was a reader and a writer in aspiration only, I absorbed the ethos of fiction of the time that was being written and the way it was being talked about was that, of course, a writer was going to be presenting subjectivities other than their own. This was the great given. It was not problematic. It was like “This is what you do” and now, it’s come all the way to a point where at some level it’s almost fundamentally suspect, and that’s okay. I’m not citing the difference between these two frameworks in order to say “Why can’t people figure out that we always have that right?” I don’t see this as a version of a rights argument, as in “Artists have rights.” I think it’s a contextual conversation and it’s a conversation about inequity and there’s a culmination of anxiety that’s rich and appropriate and very challenging for the fiction writer about who is telling who else’s story. That conversation is so tangible right now. What’s interesting is to have lived long enough to feel it coming for a long time and having operated in various modes and frameworks, and now to be operating in this one. My feeling about it is that it is innate to the project — my own personal project, but not uniquely so. It’s built in. So it brings with that the responsibility to do what we’re doing right now — to talk about it with a kind of insistent precision. “What’s happening? How do we feel about it? If you see it as innate, if you see it as desirable, what makes you say that, and what makes it okay?”\n\nI always revert back to the conversation about being a reader. When I was a reader, I knew I wanted to read in order to not be myself, in order to enter into these mindmelts and experience transmigratory subjectivity. I wanted to go and be mingled with the mind of the writer and the mind of their characters, if their characters were done in close, intimate terms. I wanted to feel that and be changed and to escape the limits of the self. So, when I experience anxiety now or hear conversations excluding the possibility that those things can be meaningful as a gesture by an artist — myself or any other one — I always reference back to “But what about my appetite as a reader to experience that?” It must be connected to the art-making at some level, because when I began to write it was also to — tentatively and awkwardly and confidently at first — to escape the prison of the self and experiment with other subjectivities as I had been doing as a reader. So it does feel to me like one of the defining parts of this thing that has given me so much, has nourished me so much, and that I use as a lens for reaching out of myself into the world generally, and I experience other people doing the same thing. It forms a community for me when other people feel that way, that I can meet people with whom I can have a conversation like “Oh my god, you read Christina Stead’s ‘The Man Who Loved Children’ too?” and then me and that person are suddenly in a mindmelt just because we both know what it’s like to have read that book written by an Australian woman about an American male character in Baltimore in the 1950s, and me and someone I am meeting whom I might not even know very well yet, we are somehow mingled through this crazy prism of Christina Stead doing her magic trick. So to me, I keep that in mind, and I humble myself. I don’t think my work is defensible. I might have fucked it up every single time, but I still know the project is worth doing because of what I have experienced.\n\nHow do you balance teaching with writing?\n\nLETHEM: I’ve sometimes reserved or tried to time it so that the starting of a major project comes around mid-summer or when I’m on a sabbatical, and I’ve done that again with this big project I’m working on right now. It’s just good if you have some time set aside to work on it. But I like to write no matter what, and that’s very important to me. So I’m doing it during the school year. Sometimes, it’s exhausting or stressful trying to keep a project alive at certain points during the teaching semester where things are culminating or I’m doing extra work or there’s a lot of meetings, but I really favor continuity. I’m not that fast of a writer, really, but I believe in producing a number of works. For me, it’s not about having one great novel. I believe in “the shelf.” Most of the writers I like, their different works speak to each other and I think that comes somewhat from my experience as a visual artist and growing up in that world. I think of it like pictures in a gallery — I think there should be a number of them because they create meaning cumulatively. So I want there to be a lot of books. I’m not a speed demon, it’s about being the tortoise, not the hare. I have to have a little bit of writing time every day and keep adding to the project to make it accumulate.\n\nDo you have any favorite writing exercises or activities that you or your students seem to particularly enjoy?\n\nLETHEM: Yeah, I have all sorts of tricks that I lay out at different points in a semester. I pretty much always talk to them about this idea I have about causality. The two elements in fiction that really make stories catalyze and turn into something are juxtaposition and causality. Putting things together that might not necessarily go together or don’t obviously fit together. Placing more than one interesting thing in a field of operation and then inserting a lot of causality, insisting at some level that one thing necessitates the other or that one is the cause of another or that they are strongly related despite the apparent disparate nature. That’s a principal that I teach over and over again in any semester. I do have exercises and a lot of them have to do with creating strong limitations — kind of games or kits for generating ideas that are restrictive. “You can’t use any of this stuff. You have to work within this very narrow framework.” Another writing exercise that I think is valuable for people to experiment with when they’re starting out is emulations or imitations. So I give people assignments to write like someone else. These things aren’t that rare, but those are a couple I favor very strongly.\n\nWhat’s a common mistake you see most beginning writers suffer from when they are first starting off?\n\nLETHEM: You can make slightly funny, slightly mean observations about the tendencies for early short story attempts to revert again and again to the character waking up in bed, the alarm clock goes off, they walk into the bathroom and they look in the mirror, and that’s when they describe what they look like. There’s like three or four pages of the character alone before they’re actually in any kind of situation and you just have to lop that stuff and say, “Actually, over here on page 4 or page 5 where you have the action actually begin might be a better place to begin your story. We really don’t need to know what it’s like to wake up on the average day.” And inside that truism, that joke about a tendency to see those kinds of pages again and again, there is a more interesting general principle, which is that the specific and the exceptional — the unusual moment is what people are going to fiction for, not the averaged-out, typical experience. I think as readers, students all know this. It’s what they gravitate towards. But as writers, they sometimes feel in some way apprehensive about putting something too unusual or arresting on the page and so they revert to doing something kind of more averaged-out — like they want to be safe and present something that people will recognize, and so they start writing about the typical instead of the atypical.\n\nWhat do you believe is the key to success in the literary world?\n\nLETHEM: It is such an uncanny and uncontrollable thing that a few people get to publish fiction and have more than a handful of other people who aren’t related to them care about it. It’s not something where you can go into a classroom and say, “I’m going to make this happen for all of you,” because I don’t think I could even make it happen for me twice in a row. I’m very lucky and the circumstances of my devotion and the fact that it was rewarded, it’s not something that I can be like “And here’s the key, here’s what I did” — it’s just not like that. To be in the creative writing classroom, it’s best to change the framework somewhat and look at it in the form of participation rather than a form of transactional becoming, like thinking “I know the professor has got the key, and I’m going to find out what it is.” Participation is something that extends from the life of the reader. If you’re not there in that space because you love reading, then you’ve misunderstood something and you should reconsider. So, what you’re doing is deepening your relationship to the world of writing by trying to connect to it actively, to take your reading to a new place and say, “What would it be like to make stories like this? What would it be like to do it all the time?” and at least for four months of the semester, trying to see what that’s like. “Is this for me? Is this interesting? Can I make other people care that I’m trying to do it?” Experimenting with that and experiencing it, embodying this participation. And also asking yourself, “Oh, and what’s it like to see someone else trying?” Because that’s the great thing about that classroom, is it’s mutuality. I know it’s very typical for people to want to come to their mentors or their professors or their elders and receive the beacon — like “Hand me down that torch so I can use it now.” But I also think people learn a tremendous amount, more than they even expect to, from their peers, from being around other people who are trying the same activity, and from working on one another’s stories. It’s why I believe in the workshop as a scene, as an encounter, is that it’s not just about the professor handing down a key, but it’s about this really eerie and interesting experience when people are simultaneously trying to write short stories or parts of a novel in their early apprenticeship connect with one another and see how they’re mutually discovering methods and approaches and how different their ideas about reading and about writing might be. It’s really illuminating to be exposed to other people who are finding a voice for something that we mostly don’t have to talk about, like why we love the books we love. You’re not called on to figure it out, like asking “What’s it doing? Why is that page exciting to me?” while you’re reading. That’s a hard thing to talk about effectively, so above all, it’s a conversation and a participation.\n\nYou’ve attributed “The Twilight Zone” as being your main influence, and also mentioned having a “lifelong obsession” with Hitchcock in past interviews. What is it about Hitchcock and The Twilight Zone that was so influential to you?\n\nLETHEM: “The Twilight Zone” is more obvious, I guess, in some ways because it matches my instinct for these kinds of conflations of the uncanny or the surreal with other kinds of very prosaic, normal tones, and that’s something I’m just drawn to. It somehow matches my sense of life somehow containing both the mundane surface with uncanny eruptions. And also, I grew up raised by people who came of age in the ’40s and ’50s, and I think you absorb a lot of things in your parent’s worlds and this kind of Cold War paranoid atmosphere that really gives rise to “The Twilight Zone.” It’s the stories themselves but kind of the way they were received, the way it took on meaning for people. It’s like that was the world I was puzzling over when I was a kid, even though I grew up in the ’60s and early ’70s with access to a more sort of rainbow-colored, counterculture, non-conformist approach, and obviously that meant a lot to me, but right underneath it was the world that it had overthrown. That kind of slightly more conformist, sublimated, dark 1950s’, Lenny Bruce, Rod Serling atmosphere, and I was still very sensitized to it. The Cold War and the McCarthy period probably destined me to write the 1950s Red Scare stuff in “Dissident Gardens.”\n\nHitchcock, I think, is slightly different. To me, he represents both the fascination with the absolute mechanics of narrative — the way storytelling can be expressed as a set of archetypal elements (set pieces, the fact every story has a MacGuffin in it) — the way in his films and also in conversations about his films, he expresses this idea about how narrative shapes work in the human imagination and how they’re received by the viewer. He was so conscious of wanting to create experiences for the viewer of his films. That pressure in and of itself has an innate surrealism to it. The way elements became archetypal is like finding the surrealism in everyday existence. He is just a narrative artist who speaks a lot to me and taught me to think about stories a lot.\n\nHaving been extremely influenced by the comic books in your youth, was there ever a time where you wanted to work more extensively in the comic medium?\n\nLETHEM: Yes, but that was when I was like 15-years-old and it was actually driven by the belief that I could draw comics at that time. I got as far as walking in with my portfolio to Marvel’s offices, but I actually didn’t have the exact combination of craft and diligence comics requires. Drawing comics is a very labor-intensive thing. You have to be able not to just draw one good superhero a page, which I started to be able to do — you have to draw him seven times on the page and then six times on the next page, and have him look like the same guy each time. It wasn’t for me.\n\nBy the time I actually wrote a comic, I had discovered how much joy there was for writing prose fiction, so it was kind of a diversion. I didn’t discover, “Oh my god, now I’m writing comics! I could just switch and do this.” It didn’t feel that tempting to me. I was really happy to do it one time. Partly, it was like a really big gift to my teenage self, like “I am working with Marvel. This is nice.” But actually, the labor of writing a comic was irritating to me in a similar way that the labor of drawing a comic turned out to be. The limitations in the act — you know, I loved the result, but I didn’t love the writing act. When I write fiction, I really enjoy myself and so I am well-placed doing what I do and writing novels and stories that aren’t illustrated by someone else. The thing about writing a script for a comic book is that it’s like being a screenwriter — you’re not really writing the finished product, you’re writing a kit for someone else to take over. It’s like being an architect and drawing a house instead of building a house. You’re offering someone kind of a plan, and in the case of comics, often several other people pick it up from there and then they’re making the thing someone else will look at eventually.\n\nIn your Guardian interview, there’s a section where you mention how, when you were younger and were first starting out, everytime you discovered a new writer you really admired, you’d read all of their work voraciously. When discussing your own work, however, you said, “I wouldn’t want to read all of me.” Why is that? Are there certain books or stories that your outlook has changed on over the years?"
