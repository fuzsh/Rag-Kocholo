        "text": "NOVELS\n\nThe Arrest\n\nEcco Press, 2020\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"An exuberantly clever and knowing post-apocalyptic dystopia. . [Lethem is] a writer of abundant literary gifts who applies them with unapologetic enthusiasm. Extremely strange, twistily plotted, fizzingly written and lingeringly mysterious.\"\n\n-- Telegraph (UK)\n\n“The Arrest is a speculative wonder, a joyfully shaggy and unapologetic page-turner of a tale. It is that rare work that manages to be both optimistic and pessimistic at the same time, somehow evoking all sides of what happens after the end. Simultaneously a celebration and condemnation of human nature, it’s a compelling read from one of his generation’s finest writers.”\n\n-- The Maine Edge\n\n\"Lethem cleverly builds on and subverts the tropes of postapocalyptic dystopias, mixes in a metafictional element, and expertly mines the nature of storytelling and its power to enchant. An inventive and intelligent speculative tale.\"\n\n-- Booklist\n\n“As a writer gifted at playing with genre forms and riffing on popular culture, (Lethem) enjoys tweaking dystopian-novel conventions.”\n\n-- USA Today\n\n\"Rarely has a novel approached the sheer pleasure of The Arrest. This is a dystopian novel in thrall to its own genre, full of knockabout comic book bravado, with regular knowing nods to literary and cinematic history. It is, in short, a blast.\"\n\n-- The Observer (London)\n\nThe Feral Detective\n\nEcco, 2018\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n“The Feral Detective investigates our haunted America in all its contemporary guises — at the edge of the city, beyond the blank desert, in the apartment next door. It’s a nimble and uncanny performance, brimming with Lethem’s trademark verve and wit.”\n\n—Colson Whitehead\n\n“Like The Crying of Lot 49 as written and directed by Elaine May, The Feral Detective is hilarious and terrifying and wrenching. Phoebe is one of the grandest, funniest heroes I’ve come upon in a long time.”\n\n—Megan Abbott\n\n“Wild, urgent, and very funny. As always, Lethem writes knowingly and brilliantly about weird, off-the-grid, wayward America. In his ever-more-electric prose, he illuminates both the barbarity and the beauty.”\n\n—Dana Spiotta\n\n“A funny but rage-fueled stunner. . . . Both [characters] are compelling, as are the desert setting and the vividly realized descriptions of its dwellers. An unrelentingly paced tale. Utterly unique and absolutely worthwhile.”\n\n—Booklist (starred review))\n\n“Surrealistic, genre-bending. . . . The personal nature of Phoebe’s tectonic shift in the desert is palpable, made flesh by Lethem’s linguistic alchemy. . . . A haunting tour of the gulf between the privileged and the dispossessed.”\n\n—Kirkus Reviews (starred review\n\nA Gambler's Anatomy\n\nDoubleday, 2016\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"In his new novel, he seems to be channeling (and, as usual, transforming) both Thomas Pynchon and Ian Fleming...in short, just another day in Lethemland, as strange and wondrous in its way as anyplace imagined by L. Frank Baum.\"\n\n—Chicago Tribune\"A thoughtful, first-rate novel that also happens to be a page-turner.\"\n\n—New York Times Book Review\n\n\"Delightfully weird...\"\n\n—Vogue\n\n\"A Gambler’s Anatomy will lead more than one reader to rummage around in the back of their closet (or local toy store) for a backgammon set…mesmerizing, twisty, fearless.”\n\n—San Francisco Chronicle\n\n“An effortless blend of comic hijinks and madcap tragedy…Lethem serves up a punchy, stylish, relentlessly entertaining novel.”\n\n—Star Tribune\n\nDissident Gardens\n\nDoubleday, 2013\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"Lethem is as ambitious as Mailer, as funny as Philip Roth and as stinging as Bob Dylan...Dissident Gardens shows Lethem in full possession of his powers as a novelist, as he smoothly segues between historical periods and internal worlds...Erudite, beautifully written, wise, compassionate, heartbreaking and pretty much devoid of nostalgia.\"\n\n--Los Angeles Times\n\n\"A righteous, stupendously involving novel about the personal toll of failed political movements and the perplexing obstacles to doing good.\"\n\n--Booklist, starred review\n\n“A novel jampacked with the human energy of a crowded subway car…It’s a big book set in small spaces – kitchen, classroom, folky nightclub – that keep its battles personal at all times…[A] wild, logorrheic, hilarious and diabolical novel. Those who reflexively compare Mr. Lethem to other Jonathans, like Jonathan Franzen, would be better off invoking Philip Roth.”\n\n--The New York Times\n\n\"A stunning new novel...Spanning several major events -- from 1930s McCarthyism through the recent Occupy Wall Street movement -- and featuring an imaginative nonlinear time sequence so that the novel's particulars arrive at unexpected moments, this work is a moving, hilarious satire of American ideology and utopian dreams...Lethem enthusiasts may find this to be his best yet. Very highly recommended.\"\n\n--Library Journal, starred review\n\n\"Jonathan Lethem's latest novel, Dissident Gardens, is a tour de force, a brilliant, satiric journey through America's dissident history from 1930s-era communism to today's Occupy movement.\"\n\n-- The Star Tribune\n\nChronic City\n\nDoubleday,2009\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"Astonishing....Knowing and exuberant, with beautiful drunken sentences that somehow manage to walk a straight line.....Turbocharged....Intricate and seamless....A dancing showgirl of a novel, yet beneath the gaudy makeup it's also the girl next door: a traditional bildungsroman with a strong moral compass.\"\n\n--New York Times Book Review\n\n\"Chronic City is a feverish portrait of the anxiety and isolation of modern Manhattan, full of dark humor and dazzling writing....proves both funny and frightening.\"\n\n--Entertainment Weekly\n\n\"Exuberant literary revving.....Lethem's vision of New York can approach the Swiftian. It is impressively observant in its detail and scourging in its mocking satire. There are any number of wicked portraits....His comments on New York life are often achingly exact....So pungent and imaginative\"\n\n--The Boston Globe\n\n\"Ingenious and unsettling...Lethem pulls everything together in a stunning critique of our perceptions of reality and our preconceptions of the function of literature.\"\n\n--San Francisco Chronicle\n\n\"Exquisitely written...Funny and mystifying, eminently quotable, resolutely difficult, even heartbreaking, \"Chronic City\" demonstrates an imaginative breadth not quite of this world.\"\n\n--Cleveland Plain Dealer\n\n\"A fluid sense of reality pervades these pages, which explore high society, urban politics, avant-garde art, celebrity mania and the dangers of information overload in an age where context is devalued or ignored....the quality of Lethem's prose and the exuberance of his imagination are reasons enough to read it.....When it comes to style, Lethem has few equals.\"\n\n--Miami Herald\n\nYou Don’t Love Me Yet\n\nDoubleday, 2007\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n“Smart and funny . . . a biting satirical take on the intersection of art and commerce, integrity and façade. . . . A send up of all things cool.”\n\n—Los Angeles Times\n\n“Fit to be devoured over a weekend.”\n\n—Rolling Stone\n\n“A gentle and hip romantic comedy [that] breezes through LA's iconoclastic anonymity with a refreshing sincerity.”\n\n—The Independent\n\n“His best since Gun, With Occasional Music . . . what makes the book sing are Lethem's accounts of what happens when a crowd on the street hears a band inside a building . . . or when for a moment four musicians understand each other better than anyone of them understands him or herself.”\n\n—Greil Marcus, Interview\n\nThe Fortress of Solitude\n\nDoubleday, 2003\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n“Magnificent. . . . [A] massively ambitious, profoundly accomplished novel.”\n\n– San Francisco Chronicle\n\n\"Glorious, chaotic, raw. . . . One of the richest, messiest, most ambitious, most interesting novels of the year. . . . Lethem grabs and captures 1970s New York City, and he brings to it a story worth telling.\"\n\n--Time\n\n\"A tour de force . . . Belongs to a venerable New York literary tradition that stretches back through Go Tell it On the Mountain, A Walker in the City, and Call it Sleep.\"\n\n--The New York Times\n\n“The finest novel of the year, by far, and likely of the past five. . . . Better than a movie, better than a symphony, better than a play, and better than a painting, because it is all of them.”\n\n–Austin Chronicle\n\nMotherless Brooklyn\n\nDoubleday, 1999\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"The best novel of the year. . . . Utterly original and deeply moving.\"\n\n--Esquire\n\n\"Philip Marlowe would blush. And tip his fedora.\"\n\n--Newsweek\n\n\"Finding out whodunit is interesting enough, but it's more fun watching Lethem unravel the mysteries of his Tourettic creation. In this case, it takes one trenchant wordsmith to know another.\"\n\n--Time\n\n\"Immerses us in the mind's dense thicket, a place where words split and twine in an ever-deepening tangle.\" --The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"Who but Jonathan Lethem would attempt a half-satirical cross between a literary novel and a hard-boiled crime story narrated by an amateur detective with Tourette's syndrome?...The dialogue crackles with caustic hilarity...Jonathan Lethem is a verbal performance artisit...Unexpectedly moving.\"\n\n--The Boston Globe\n\n\"With one unique and well-imagined character, Jonathan Lethem has turned a genre on its ear. He doesn't just push the envelope, he gives it a swift kick... A tour de force.\"\n\n--The Denver Post\n\n\"Wonderfully inventive, slightly absurdist... [Motherless Brooklyn] is funny and sly, clever, compelling, and endearing.\"\n\n--USA Today\n\nGirl in Landscape\n\nDoubleday, 1998\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"One of the most original voices among younger American novelists....Jonathan Lethem's imagination [is]...marvelously fertile.\"\n\n--Newsday\n\n\"Lethem is opening up blue sky for American fiction.\"-\n\n-Village Voice\n\n\"Complex, scary and finally moving.\"\n\n--Atlanta Journal & Constitution\n\nAs She Climbed Across the Table\n\nDoubleday, 1997\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"In this witty but telling new work from the author of The Wall of Sky, the Wall of Eye , our hapless narrator has completed his dissertation on \"Theory as Neurosis in the Professional Scientist\" and landed a job at the University of North California at Beauchamp (pronouced beach 'em), where he studies academic envirorments, producing \"strong but irrelevant work\" and falling for physics professor Alice. But Alice is too caught up in Professor Soft's notorious experiment with a vacuum intelligence called Lack to pay her lover much heed, and soon Lack is the real love of her life. This is not your typically insular campus comedy; Lethem has something bigger in mind, and he succeeds admirably in skewering our pretensions, technological or not, in language that gently mocks the way we hide behind jargon. An ironical book that is, ironically, quite poignant.\"\n\n--Library Journal\n\nAmnesia Moon\n\nHarcourt Brace, 1995\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BANRES & NOBLE\n\n\"A hip, updated conflation of Harlan Ellison's A Boy and His Dog and Jim Thompson's The Alcoholics. Jonathan Lethem escorts us down an impossibly post-terminal Route 66, kicking and screaming and loving every minute of it.\"\n\n- Barry Gifford, author of Wild At Heart\n\n\"An author to be reckoned with . . . A social critic, a sardonic satirist like the Walker Percy of Love in the Ruins. But with Amnesia Moon, Lethem slips out of the shadow of his predecessors to deliver a droll, downbeat vision that is both original and persuasive.\"\n\n-Newsweek\n\nGun,With Occasional Music\n\nHarcourt Brace, 1994\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"Marries Chandler's style and Philip K. Dick's vision . . . An audaciously assured first novel.\"\n\n-Newsweek\n\n\"Marvelous . . . Stylish, intelligent, darkly humorous and highly readable entertainment.\"\n\n-San Francisco Examiner\n\nCOLLECTIONS\n\nLucky Alan and Other Stories\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"Lethem is, of course, a king of sentences.... Lethem works in an interesting literary space between realism and absurdism, modernism and postmodernism, satire and a particular brand of DeLillo-inspired darkness.... His talent is large and, as these stories demonstrate, his eye is as sharp as ever.\"\n\n- New York Times Book Review\n\n“Jonathan Lethem’s imagination seemingly knows no bounds.... Comparisons might be drawn to writers ranging from Jorge Luis Borges and Haruki Murakami to Margaret Atwood and J.D. Salinger.”\n\n-- Chicago Tribune\n\n\"Rewards await the reader who commits to this slim volume.... Lucky Alan is a beguiling addition to a shelf full of uniquely inventive books by a master of genres with a legitimate claim to the much-contested throne.\"\n\n-- The Miami Herald\n\n“Typically odd, funny and easy to love…. [A] pleasing schizophrenia and a remarkable variety in affect and ambition within one collection.”\n\n-- LA Times\n\n“[A] great introduction to the sometimes heartbreaking, often surreal world of Jonathan Lethem…\"\n\n-- NPR\n\nMen and Cartoons\n\nDoubleday, 2004\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"A strikingly original collection . . . imaginative, insightful, witty and sad.\"\n\n--Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\n\"An already dazzling writer shows us a new card. . . . Men and Cartoons ends on a note that portends Lethem's most experimental turn yet: toward human love as [a transporting] alternate universe. . . . Lethem in a new, more nakedly personal key.\"\n\n--San Francisco Chronicle\n\n\"Lethem is the man to beat in fiction these days. . . . Every tale of ennui, cosmic regret and petty yearning is perfectly realized. The brevity of the book and perfection of the stories puts every other member of his generation to shame.\"\n\n--Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\n\"Compelling. . . . Effective. . . . Intelligent and poignant. . . . Strange, amusing, haunting. . . . Lethem has what musicians call 'chops,' or technical mastery. He can mix and match prose styles and literary genres to create glittering fictional artifacts. . . . Each of these nine tales rewards the reader in some way--through an insight, a scene or simply the force of the author's imagination.\"\n\n--St. Petersburg Times\n\n\"Bristling with familiarity. . . . Theme[s] that resonate. . . . [Lethem is] adept at letting palpable human experiences emerge from absurd, fantastical situations.\"\n\n--The San Diego Union-Tribune\n\n\"Nuanced. . . .

His talent is large.”\n\n—The New York Times Book Review\n\nThe Ecstasy of Influence\n\nDoubleday, 2011\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP | BARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"Hefty and remarkable .These byways, all of which make room for eccentric flights as well as proper essays, augment the charm and impact of what Lethem prefers to call an 'autobiographical collage,' a phrase he lifts from Vonnegut. This influence seems only natural, for dominating all is Lethem's prime concern always: the novel, generous, exciting, openhearted, unconventional.\"\n\n--The New York Times Book Review\n\n“He’s a novelist who has spent a lifetime creating his own subversive pantheon, a jumpy CBGB’s of the literary soul….Several of the essays here marinate in the fish sauce that is literary gossip…..feisty, freewheeling….funny”\n\n—The New York Times\n\n\"Emotionally engaging and intellectually nimble....curated selection of essays which thematically add up to more than the sum of its parts.

Dense with allusion and insight.\"\n\n—St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\n“These marvelous explorations take us into the hiding places of the psyche, where second thoughts are assessed, secret-sharer sins confessed, and grief and loss redressed. In a collection as warmly engaging as it is ruminative, Jonathan Lethem shows himself to be as much a master of the personal essay as he is of contemporary fiction.”\n\n—Phillip Lopate\n\nOTHER BOOKS\n\nThe Blot\n\n(With Laurence A.

The insomniac brain is a sort of conspiracy theorist as well, believing too much in its own paranoiac importance--as though if it were to blink, then doze, the world might be overrun by some encroaching calamity, which its obsessive musings are somehow fending off.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“I want what we all want,\" said Carl. \"To move certain parts of the interior of myself into the exterior world, to see if they can be embraced.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, You Don't Love Me Yet\n\n“Those promises we make to ourselves when we are younger, about how we mean to conduct our adult lives, can it be true we break every last one of them? All except for one, I suppose: the promise to judge ourselves by those standards, the promise to remember the child who would be so appalled by compromise, the child who would find jadedness wicked.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem\n\n“What age is a black boy when he learns he's scary?”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“Listen to me. I’m shy. I’m not stupid. I can’t meet people’s eyes. I don’t know if you understand what that’s like. There’s a whole world going on around me, I’m aware of that. It’s not because I don’t want to look at you, Lucinda. It’s that I don’t want to be seen.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, You Don't Love Me Yet\n\n“You can't be deep without a surface”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, You Don't Love Me Yet\n\n“Someday I'd change my name to Shut Up and save everybody a lot of time.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“I learned to write fiction the way I learned to read fiction - by skipping the parts that bored me.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem\n\n“Every room I've lived in since I was given my own room at eleven was lined with, and usually overfull of, books. My employment in bookstores was always continuous with my private hours: shelving and alphabetizing, building shelves, and browsing-- in my collection and others-- in order to understand a small amount about the widest possible number of books. Such numbers of books are constantly acquired that constant culling is necessary; if I slouch in this discipline, the books erupt. I've also bricked myself in with music--vinyl records, then compact discs. My homes have been improbably information-dense, like capsules for survival of a nuclear war, or models of the interior of my own skull. That comparison--room as brain-- is one I've often reached for in describing the rooms of others, but it began with the suspicion that I'd externalized my own brain, for anyone who cared to look.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Disappointment Artist\n\n“There were days when no kid came out of his house without looking around. The week after Halloween had a quality both hungover and ominous, the light pitched, the sky smashed against the rooftops.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“My inner chemistry had been hijacked by a mad scientist, who poured the fizzy, volatile contents of my heart from a test tube marked SOBER REALITY into another labeled SUNNY DELUSION, and back again, faster and faster, until the floor of my life was slick with spillage.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, As She Climbed Across the Table\n\n“What exactly is postmodernism, except modernism without the anxiety?”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem\n\n“Dylan's friend Linus Millberg appears out of the crowd with a cup of beer and shouts, 'Dorothy is John Lennon, the Scarecrow is Paul McCartney, the Tin Woodman is George Harrison, the Lion's Ringo.'\n\n'Star Trek,' commands Dylan over the lousy twangy country CB's is playing between sets.\n\n'Easy,' Linus shouts back. \"Kirk's John, Spock's Paul, Bones is George, Scotty is Ringo. Or Chekov, after the first season. Doesn't matter, it's like a Scotty-Chekov-combination Ringo. Spare parts are always surplus Georges or Ringos.'\n\n'But isn't Spock-lacks-a-heart and McCoy-lacks-a-brain like Woodman and Scarecrow? So Dorothy's Kirk?'\n\n'You don't get it. That's just a superficial coincidence. The Beatle thing is an archetype, it's like the basic human formation. Everything naturally forms into a Beatles, people can't help it.'\n\n'Say the types again.'\n\n'Responsible-parent genius-parent genius-child clown-child.'\n\n'Okay, do Star Wars.'\n\n'Luke Paul, Han Solo John, Chewbacca George, the robots Ringo.'\n\n'Tonight Show.'\n\n'Uh, Johnny Carson Paul, the guest John, Ed McMahon Ringo, whatisname George.'\n\n'Doc Severinson.'\n\n'Yeah, right. See, everything revolves around John, even Paul. That's why John's the guest.'\n\n'And Severinson's quiet but talented, like a Wookie.'\n\n'You begin to understand.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“...Don't rupture another's illusion unless you're positive the alternative you offer is more worthwhile than that from which you're wrenching them. Interrogate your solipsism: Does it offer any better a home than the delusions you're reaching to shatter?”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Chronic City\n\n“Some people have things written all over their faces; the big guy had a couple of words misspelled in crayon on his.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Gun, With Occasional Music\n\n“My heart, to put it more simply, got nostalgic for the present. Always a bad sign.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, As She Climbed Across the Table\n\n“Anyone could see it all coming and no one could possibly stop it and that was the beautiful thing. Friday night was open wide and writ in stone”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“Apologies aren't something you want to get in the habit of practicing in the mirror”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Gun, With Occasional Music\n\n“Consensual reality is both fragile and elastic, and it heals like the skin of a bubble.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“My heart and the elevator, a plummet inside a plummet.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, As She Climbed Across the Table\n\n“It was often this way, life consisted of a series of false beginnings, bluff declarations of arrival to destinations not even glimpsed.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, You Don't Love Me Yet\n\n“Enough of this. Does every conversation with you have to be the director's cut? Get out of the car.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem , Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“To the resentment that hides inside love, to the loneliness that hides among companions.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, You Don't Love Me Yet\n\n“A shadow strolled past the car, indifferent to our curbside melodrama. This was my second time imperiled in a a parked vehicle in the space of three hours. I wondered what goonish spectacles I'd overlooked in my own career as a pavement walker.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“I jotted the name down mentally on that tattered notepad I call a memory. The pen skipped.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Gun, With Occasional Music\n\n“Tourette's is just one big lifetime of tag, really. The world (or my brain---same thing) appoints me it, again and again. So I tag back. Can it do otherwise? If you've ever been it you know the answer.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“I'm tightly wound. I'm a loose cannon. Both - I'm a tightly wound loose cannon, a tight loose.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“Nobody said anything while I opened the bag and took out the egg salad sandwich. It was one of those funny moments when a bit of normal human activity embarrasses everybody out of their bluster and hostility, and roles are momentarily laid aside.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Gun, With Occasional Music\n\n“Eighth grade's a distant rumor, a tabled issue, and Dylan knows from experience that the summer between might change anything, everything. He and Mingus Rude too and even Arthur Lomb for that matter are released from the paint-by-numbers page of their schooldays, from their preformatted roles as truant or victim, freed to an unspoiled summer, that inviting medium for doodling in self-transformation. ”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“But the day I can't shrug off a twinge of self-pity, is the day I'm washed up for keeps.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Gun, With Occasional Music\n\n“She craned up on her toes and kissed my cheek...\"Don't do that\", I said. \"You just met me. This is New York.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“The voices may propel you to warble along, or to dance, they may inspire you to seduction or insurrection or inspection or merely to watching a little less television. The voices of Barrett Rude Jr. and the Subtle Distinctions lead nowhere, though, if not back to your own neighborhood. To the street where you live. To things you left behind.\n\nAnd that's what you need, what you needed all along.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“I'd underestimated him. I assumed anyone who started out gut-punching you in an elevator couldn't have all that much else in his arsenal. For instance, I had no idea he could smile, let alone at such an inappropriate time.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Gun, With Occasional Music\n\n“But the stories you told yourself-- which you pretended to recall as if they'd happened every afternoon of an infinite summer-- were really a pocketful of days distorted into legend, another jailhouse exaggeration, like the dimensions of those ballpoint-crosshatched tits or of the purported mountains of blow you once used to enjoy, or how you'd bellowed an avenger's roar when you squeezed the trigger of a pistol you'd actually brandished in self-pissing terror. How often had that hydrant even been opened? Did you jet water through a car window, what, twice at best? Summer burned a few afternoons long, in the end.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“Apparently Brooklyn needn't always push itself to be something else, something conscious and anxious, something pointed toward Manhattan.... Brooklyn might sometimes also be pleased, as here on Flatbush, to be its grubby, enduring self.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“It wasn't for children, seventh grade. You could read the stress of even entering the building in the postures of the teachers, the security guards. Nobody could relax in such a racial and hormonal disaster area.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“The wind was picking up off the ocean now and the whole coastal scene had a bleak, abandoned look, as though Maine in November really belonged to the ragged gulls who wheeled over the sun-worn pier, and the humans had just gotten the news and taken a powder.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“Fifth grade was fourth grade with something wrong. Nothing changed outright. Instead it teetered. You'd pushed futility at Public School 38 so long by then you expected the building itself would be embarrassed and quit. The ones who couldn't read still couldn't, the teachers were teaching the same thing for the fifth time now and refusing to meet your eyes, some kids had been left back twice and were the size of janitors. The place was a cage for growing, nothing else. School lunch turned out to be the five-year-plan, the going concern. You couldn't be left back from fish sticks and sloppy joes. You'd retain at the least two thousand half-pint containers of vitamin D-enriched chocolate milk.\n\nTwo black guys from the projects, twins, were actually named Ronald and Donald MacDonald. The twins themselves only shrugged, couldn't be made to agree it was incredible.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“Have you ever felt, in the course of reading a detective novel, a guilty thrill of relief at having a character murdered before he can step onto the page and burden you with his actual existence? Detective stories always have too many characters anyway. And characters mentioned early on but never sighted, just lingering offstage, take on an awful portentous quality. Better to have them gone.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“All Thinking is Wishful.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, You Don't Love Me Yet\n\n“The key to mostly anything is pretending your first time *isn't*.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“Today the tower's flock, the usual birds, flew in a kind of scatter pattern, their paths intricately chaotic, the bunch parting and interweaving like boiling pasta under a pot's lifted lid. It appeared someone had given the birds new instructions, had whispered that there was something to avoid, or someone to fool. I once heard Perkus Tooth say that he'd woken that morning having dreamed an enigmatic sentence: \"Paranoia is a flower in the brain.\" Perkus offered this, then smirked and bugged his eyes--the ordinary eye, and the other. I played at amazement (I was amazed, anyway, at the fact that Perkus dreamed sentences to begin with). Yet I hadn't understood what the words meant to him until now, when I knew for a crucial instant that the birds had been directed to deceive me. That was when I saw the brain's flower. Perkus had, I think, been trying to prepare me for how beautiful it was.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Chronic City\n\n“We were in a middle space then, in a cone of white, father and son moving forward at a certain speed. Side by side, not truly quiet but quiescent, two gnarls of human scribble, human cipher, human dream.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“For those whose ganglia were formed pre-TV, the mimetic deployment of pop-culture icons seems at best an annoying tic and at worst a dangerous vapidity that compromises fiction's seriousness by dating it out of the Platonic Always, where it ought to reside.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem\n\n“I was playing it existential, and maybe a bit stupid, but it was the only way I knew how to play it.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Gun, With Occasional Music\n\n“May one plead, Your Honor, postmodernism as an involuntary condition?”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Disappointment Artist\n\n“There is nothing Tourettic about the New York City subways.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Motherless Brooklyn\n\n“The cars rushing below knew nothing. People in cars weren't New Yorkers anyway, they'd suffered some basic misunderstanding. The two boys on the walkway, apparently standing still they were moving faster than the cars.\n\nNineteen seventy-five.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“I am relaxed. It's just buried under layers of incredulity and panic. But underneath those I'm very relaxed.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, As She Climbed Across the Table\n\n“The revving heart of my hopefulness, kicked into gear anew, is the most precious thing about me, I refuse to vilify it.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Men and Cartoons\n\n“The stumbling block will turn out to be the traditional one for students of consciousness: the flashlight is incapable of shining on itself, so we can't trust what its light reveals.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Fear of Music\n\n“Did I read The New Yorker? This question had a dangerous urgency. It wasn't any one writer or article he was worried about, but the font. The meaning embedded, at a preconscious level, by the look of the magazine; the seal, as he described it, that the typography and layout put on dialectical thought. According to Perkus, to read The New Yorker was to find that you always already agreed, not with The New Yorker but, much more dismayingly, with yourself. I tried hard to understand. Apparently here was the paranoia Susan Eldred had warned me of: The New Yorker's font was controlling, perhaps assailing, Perkus Tooth's mind. To defend himself he frequently retyped their articles and printed them out in simple Courier, an attempt to dissolve the magazine's oppressive context. Once I'd enter his apartment to find him on his carpet with a pair of scissors, furiously slicing up and rearranging an issue of the magazine, trying to shatter its spell on his brain.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Chronic City\n\n“The dentist swiveled on his heels and disappeared, leaving me there to massage my jaw back into feeling after its brief, masochistic marriage to the top of my wooden desk.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Gun, With Occasional Music\n\n“You discovered yourself and what really mattered only after you passed through the lens of the fairy tale, imposed on every human female and male alike, that someone existed out in the forest of the world for you to love and marry.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Dissident Gardens\n\n“I’d forgotten my identity as the world’s most pathetic superhero, become a Californian instead. ”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“Winter days were static glimpsed between channel flips.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude\n\n“Terms swarm up to tempt me in the course of this description: Greek Orthodox, Romanesque, flying buttress, etc. These guessing words I find junked in my brain in deranged juxtaposition, like files randomly stuffed into cabinets by a dispirited secretary with no notion of what, if anything, might ever be usefully retrieved. Often all language seems this way: a monstrous compendium of embedded histories I’m helpless to understand. I employ it the way a dog drives a car, without grasping how the car came to exist or what makes a combustion engine possible. That is, of course, if dogs drove cars. They don’t. Yet I go around forming sentences.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, Chronic City\n\n“Did he ever--try?'\n\nMingus shrugged. 'He was like you.'\n\nWhat's that mean?'\n\nMeans he tried.'\n\nOf course. The ring was not a neutral tool. It judged its wearer: Aaron Doily flew drunkenly, and Dylan flew like a coward, only when it didn't matter, at the Windles' pond. So if had attuned to Robert Woolfolk's chaos.\n\nDon't tell me,' said Dylan. 'He flew sideways.'\n\nMingus left it vague. He'd always made it his habit to protect their honor against one another--Dylan, Arthur, Robert. To say nothing.”\n\n― Jonathan Lethem, The Fortress of Solitude"
