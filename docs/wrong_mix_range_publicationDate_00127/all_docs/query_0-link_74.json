        "text": "Joe Biden is a leader who acts with the best interests of America in mind. Not seeking re-election is one of the most selfless acts we’ve seen from a politician in modern American history. This is what’s right for our country—and our democratic future. Kamala Harris is the right person at the right time. Donald Trump and JD Vance are promising an agenda that will wreak havoc on the American people. Harris’s background and leadership growing the economy, fighting for bodily autonomy, and protecting our democracy uniquely position her to push back against Trump’s extremism. The Democrats are the party of policy, progress, and action. When presented with the choice between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, I believe in the American people to make the right decision for our country. The Biden-Harris administration has put this country on the right track. It’s time for us to unite. I wholeheartedly support Kamala Harris and her candidacy for President of the United States in our fight for democracy in November.\n\nAllie K. Miller and I were curious to understand how AI can help amplify our thought processes, so we assembled a panel of custom GPTs to listen in—and engage with us—as we discussed the future of AI. The conversation demonstrates how using multiple agents can help us anticipate opportunities and challenges we’d have otherwise missed when making important decisions. These GPTs might not always have the best contributions; our AI agent programmed as “The Skeptic” definitely undersold the power of AI, for example. But in summing up the experiment, both Allie and “The Scribe” remind us that one of the most essential skills for the future is learning to prompt and conduct our respective GPT orchestras effectively."
