        "text": "Ok, let’s talk Jonathan Lethem, shall we? Like a lot of people, we came to Jonathan Lethem via Motherless Brooklyn and then read everything as it came out but also went back and read everything prior too – and whilst it’s fair to say there’s some Lethem books we like more than others, for a time we liked pretty much everything he did. And then, we would say post-Chronic City, our interest started to wane a little (and, inside our own heads, we felt apologetic – it’s not you, it’s us etc) – to the extent that by the time The Arrest came out, we gave it a pass. Not a hard pass, just a little nod of the head, must try and catch up soon but then, you know, things get in the way and time passes. Some of it we put down to Lethem leaving his native New York to go teach in California.\n\nBrooklyn Crime Novel, then, snuck up on us. We didn’t know it was due until it arrived (which is unusual for us, horizon scanners that we are). The first reviews we read raised the old hackles. Oooh we said inside our own heads. A mosaic novel set in New York, composed of 120-odd essentially flash fictions, following it has to be said a pretty extensive group of characters to talk about New York in the 70s and 80s (and earlier and beyond) in terms of crimes both big and small. Definitely oooh. Consider our interest piqued. We are delighted to say: Brooklyn Crime Novel delivers. This is the best Lethem novel for what we consider to be a time. It might even be (whisper it) Lethem’s best novel so far (in our humble etc).\n\nThings kick off with two white boys sawing coins in a basement. We’ll follow them through the course of a few hundred pages. We don’t learn their names. “They don’t need names,” we are told. “…there’s simply too many of these white boys. Some will reappear, some won’t.” Lethem does a good job of pointing out what’s relevant: “…keep an eye on the spoiled boy and the millionaire’s son, when they come along. Also the younger brother who appears in the next story.” There are black boys and white boys, mostly, intermingling on Dean Street (“In truth, the Dean Street boys, Black, white, and brown, don’t all live on Dean Street. And they don’t call themselves the Dean Street boys – like some gang. A gang is nearly the opposite of what they are”), as properties are swept up in the initial flurry of what comes to be called gentrification. The gentrification of New York streets plays a big part in Brooklyn Crime Novel.\n\nIt’s also worth saying, if you come here expecting a crime novel, an Elmore Leonard, say, you’ll be nonplussed. You might also be delighted because Brooklyn Crime Novel is very much its own thing (if Auster wrote The New York Trilogy, this is very much The New York Library of literary New York novels). We follow young men who run the street, who flirt with skateboarding, who slip in and out of circles and our attention. We find opticians caught up in oddly tense customer exchanges. There are actors who poke their noses in for a little while. People who emerge from the shadows to fulfil the role of nemesis. There are boys who grow up into men with an unhealthy interest in books (don’t we all) before transforming again into – what? The conscience of a time and place? Possibly. There is a woman known only as the Screamer (“some kind of nightmare Rapunzel, white girl, crazy, banished upstairs. She looks out at the street and she screams. Indecipherable, unpredictable and fucking loud!”).\n\nAnd you know, there’s the street itself. The streets. The dance of the streets. Quite literally the dance, which is what happens when parents equip kids with mugging money, money they know they will lose on the journey to school, real money, lunch money hidden, sweatily, in their socks. The dance preoccupies us for hundreds of pages. Lethem flirts with us. Mentions it. Draws away. Puts obstacles in the way of our education. And then, eventually, clues us in, lets us behind the curtain, welcomes us to the dance of the novel itself.\n\n“We’ve done our damnedest,” he tells us, after working hard to include just about everyone, or a shadow of everyone, who might have passed by during these heady days,\n\n“in the course of this pursuit, to widen the aperture, to let in more: more streets, more crimes, more faces, more glances at the periphery of the scene, and at the periphery of our comprehension. To make no preliminary exclusions. To not understand ourselves too quickly, to do even the police in different voices.”\n\nIt’s a very inclusive book is what we are saying. Don’t be put off by the mention of boys above. Here is everybody. In New York. At a certain time.\n\nThe thing is, there’s no way to do this exuberance justice here. It took us right back to Matthew McIntosh’s Seattle equivalent, Well (which we also recommend if you haven’t read it). Lethem is funny, Lethem writes beautifully, the book is smart and entertaining, it feels big and full of life and full of heart. We started it with trepidation, wanting it to be all we wanted from a Lethem novel and it was all that and more. Our trepidation evaporated in a handful of pages and we were just swept along. Brooklyn Crime Novel is the kind of book that shuts off the world for a bit. There’s just you and the book and the book is everything."
