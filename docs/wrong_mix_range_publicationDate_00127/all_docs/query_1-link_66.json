        "text": "Rock music changed America, and the generation of writers that grew up with it embraced the spirit of that change. Pioneering new attitudes and styles that mirrored the music’s freedom, homemade inventiveness, and rebellious energy, they created a body of writing that is a heady mix of high culture, pop culture, roots culture, the politics of race and gender, philosophical speculation, poetic exploration, and just plain obsessive enthusiasm. Shake It Up is a mix tape of fifty of the most outspoken and distinctly personal voices from a half-century tradition of “revolutionary and often joyous defiance,” in the words of this volume’s editors, ranging from Nat Hentoff’s early recognition of Bob Dylan’s first breakthrough to Greil Marcus’s update on the outer reaches of today’s experimental sound art.\n\nRock emerged as an unavoidable presence in the mid-1950s, provoking disgust and disdain from the cultural mainstream. Those who grew up with the music saw it otherwise. The result was a wave of magazines—among them Crawdaddy, Creem, and _Rolling Stone_—offering channels for fresh and innovative styles and perceptions. As the music evolved and new genres came to the fore—heavy metal, disco, punk, hip-hop—the writing also continued to change, extending earlier conversations and arguments into a new era.\n\nShake It Up invites the reader into the tumult and excitement of the rock revolution. Stanley Booth describes a recording session with Otis Redding; Ellen Willis traces the meteoric career of Janis Joplin; Ellen Sander recalls the chaotic world of Led Zeppelin on tour; Nick Tosches etches a portrait of the young Jerry Lee Lewis; Eve Babitz remembers Jim Morrison. Alongside are Lenny Kaye on acapella and Greg Tate on hip-hop, Vince Aletti on disco and Gerald Early on Motown; Robert Christgau on Prince, Nelson George on Marvin Gaye, Luc Sante on Bob Dylan, Hilton Als on Michael Jackson, Anthony DeCurtis on the Rolling Stones, Kelefa Sanneh on Jay Z. The story this anthology tells is a ongoing one: “it’s too early,” editors Jonathan Lethem and Kevin Dettmar note, “for canon formation in a field so marvelously volatile—a volatility that mirrors, still, that of pop music itself, which remains smokestack lightning. The writing here attempts to catch some in a bottle.”\n\nJonathan Lethem is the author of The Fortress of Solitude and nine other novels; Kevin Detmarr is the author of Is Rock Dead? and editor of The Cambridge Companion to Bob Dylan.\n\nThis special publication features full-cloth binding, acid-free paper, and a unique design with specifications differing from those of Library of America series titles."
