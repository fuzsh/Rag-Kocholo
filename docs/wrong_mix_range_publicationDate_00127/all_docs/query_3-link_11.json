        "meta_description": "What&rsquo;s a novelist supposed to do with contemporary culture? And what&rsquo;s contemporary culture sup&shy;posed to do with novelists? In  The Ecstasy of Influence , Jonathan Lethem, tangling with what he calls the &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo; role of the writer as public intellectual, arrives at an astonishing range of answers.   A constellation of previously published pieces and new essays as provocative and idiosyncratic as any he&rsquo;s written, this volume sheds light on an array of topics from sex in cinema to drugs, graffiti, Bob Dylan, cyberculture, 9/11, book touring, and Marlon Brando, as well as on a shelf&rsquo;s worth of his literary models and contemporaries: Norman Mailer, Paula Fox, Bret Easton Ellis, James Wood, and oth&shy;ers. And, writing about Brooklyn, his father, and his sojourn through two decades of writing, Lethem sheds an equally strong light on himself.",
