        "text": "Tag: Jonathan Lethem\n\nMy most given books\n\nA comment during an interview with author Mark Helprin turned my thinking to the books I’ve given most as gifts. Here they are.\n\nWhat I’m reading this summer\n\nSomething I love to do during the summertime is catch up on classics. The desire is connected to the memory of the required summer reading lists I used to get for school when I was a young reader. Here's what I've \"assigned\" to myself this summer.\n\nShopping Brooklyn bookstores\n\nIt's that time of year when New York City teems with holiday lights and traffic jams surrounding the department stores, Rockefeller Center and Times Square. On a recent visit, I avoided the crowds and headed to Brooklyn, where I found a small herd of that endangered species, the independent bookstore.\n\nIn “A Meaningful Life” everything is all wrong\n\nL. J. Davis's 1971 novel “A Meaningful Life” was reissued this year. It's a funny story about a protagonist who gets a wake-up call to do something about his dull life."
