        "text": "163 BOOKS IN REVIEW BOOKS IN REVIEW Definitely not the Disappointment Artist. Jaime Clarke, ed. Conversations with Jonathan Lethem. LITERARY CONVERSATIONS. Jackson: U of Mississippi P, 2011. xxiii + 191 pp. $40 hc; $25 pbk. Jonathan Lethem. The Ecstasy of Influence: Nonfictions, etc. New York: Doubleday, 2011. xxiv + 437 pp. $27.95 hc. In his essay “The Squandered Promise of Science Fiction,” published in The Village Voice in 1998, Jonathan Lethem mourns the fact that Gravity’s Rainbow was not awarded a Nebula in 1973. Thomas Pynchon’s opus was, in fact, nominated, but it lost to Arthur C. Clarke’s Rendezvous With Rama—a work that Carter Scholz (with whom Lethem authored a collection of short stories, Kafka Americana [1999]) reportedly described as “less a novel than a schematic diagram in prose” (qtd. in “Squandered Promise,” available online). For Lethem, “Pynchon’s nomination now stands as a hidden tombstone marking the death of the hope that science fiction was about to merge with the mainstream,” a demise reconfirmed in the failure of Don DeLillo’s Ratner’s Star to receive the Nebula for best novel of 1976. While this lament is partly tongue-in-cheek (Lethem was and still is well aware of the politics of literary genres), his article was one of the first of his sf-oriented missives targeted at the people who read different books than sf fans do. I suspect most readers of SFS are familiar with or at least aware of slipstream discourses, but for the hipster/alternative crowd of The Voice, the article may have been an eye opener—science fiction is not what they thought it to be. Or so said Jonathan Lethem, who at that point had already published four novels, all decisively slipstreamy. Of course, Lethem is a person who knows the price of writing across genres and marketing territories: from the beginning of his career, he has been a victim of science fiction’s conflicted relationships with other literary and cultural fields. While the writer has tapped a number of contemporary genres for literary material, sf has consistently and conspicuously remained his strongest influence. Five of his eight novels (I do not consider Believeniks!: 2005: The Year We Wrote a Book About the Mets [2006], co-written with Christopher Sorrentino, a proper novel) are strongly science-fictional, as are the majority of Lethem’s short stories, so far collected in four volumes. He wrote the script for the revived Marvel comic run of Omega the Unknown (2007-2008). As an editor, Lethem has consistently championed Philip K. Dick’s writing: he edited three volumes of Dick’s fiction for the Library of America (the first volumes in the series devoted to sf) and, with Pamela Jackson, The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick (2011), an extensive, annotated selection of PKD’s notorious journals. In addition, he co-edited Store of the Worlds: The Stories of Robert Sheckley (2012) for NYRB Classics. As a critic, he wrote a volume in 2010 on John Carpenter’s They Live (1988) for the Deep Focus film book series of Soft Skull Press. Finally, Lethem has praised and promoted sf in his abundant journalism and essays as well as in public appearances—in his account of the 2012 Key West Seminar (in SFS #117), Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr. called him a hinge that\n\n164 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 40 (2013) connected various conceptions of the fantastic represented at the event. And yet, for all these credentials, Lethem’s work has remained largely unknown to most sf readers. It is immaterial whether this is a result of publishing primarily through non- genre venues or the inherent generic instability of his fiction. The acknowledg- ment of Lethem’s membership in the sf club, or lack thereof, can be used as a good litmus test of one’s conception of the genre. Suvinians are more than likely to dismiss him as someone belonging with the likes of Ray Bradbury as members of a “misshapen subgenre born of ... mingling” (Metamorphoses of Science Fiction: On the Poetics and History of a Literary Genre [New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 1979]: 68). For those subscribing to a more eclectic and dynamic vision of what sf is, or aspires to be, as it enters the twenty-first century, Amnesia Moon (1995) or Girl in Landscape (1998) will be quintessentially hopeful novels demonstrating the genre’s openness to experimentation. I do consider Lethem a science-fiction writer—slipstream or not, his fiction and nonfiction seethe with the kind of imagination long associated with sf. Those who do not agree will probably not be swayed by either of the two books under review here, but even so they cannot deny one thing: science fiction has few more committed and devoted proselytizers in the larger literary world. Of the two books, Conversations with Jonathan Lethem is more predictable, although not in any negative sense. It draws together fourteen exchanges of varying lengths, the two earliest of which come from our own territory: Fiona Kelleghan’s “Private Hells and Radical Doubts” originally appeared in SFS in 1998, and Shelley Jackson’s “Involuntary Deconstructionism” came out in Paradoxa in 2001. Inevitably there is a certain degree of overlap among the interviews, made even more apparent in the introduction, in which Clarke suggests several key parameters of the writer’s life, each time providing lengthy excerpts in which Lethem essentially says the same things. Apart from the two chats mentioned above, which naturally have a clear sf slant, the most interesting feature of the collection is a series of four interviews conducted by Michael Silverblatt of Southern California’s KCRW radio occasioned by the publication of specific novels. Given the format, the conversations are not very long, but Silverblatt is quite familiar with Lethem’s fiction, and though aired three or four years apart, they display little redundancy. Though the remaining interviews inevitably recycle variations on several standard questions, Conversations is still the first stop for anyone working on Lethem’s fiction and, in combination with James Peacock’s recently published critical study of the novels, Jonathan Lethem (Manchester UP, 2012), will be an invaluable resource, particularly since Lethem is such an exceptionally graceful interview subject. Lethem’s second collection of miscellaneous writings after The Disappointment Artist (2005), The Ecstasy of Influence is a far more ambitious affair than its predecessor, a veritable treasure trove of Lethemiana—an apt term that reflects his apparent compulsion to write about anything that comes his way. Lethem is a voracious reader and viewer of what can be called, for lack of a better word, popular culture, and if one is to believe his recollections from"
