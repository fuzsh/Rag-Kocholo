        "meta_description": "This essay explores the various ways in which Paul Auster has written about money in his novels throughout his career, and argues that there are continuities as well as differences which reflect the author’s increased concern for the lived world and the socio-economic forces that shape it. The argument focuses on Auster’s treatment of the subject of money and its relationship to matters of authorship, language and work. Much of Auster’s writing since his early days of monetary struggle has returned to the problems of poverty and precarity that artists and authors often face. In earlier works, the material aspect was often de-emphasised in favour of the symbolic or metaphorical, but more recent work has sought to bring the two plains of representation into closer alignment. The preoccupation with the language of money allows Auster’s fiction to be both about representation and about the things it seeks to represent, to be realist and metafictional, and to explore material and immaterial questions at the same time.",

        "text": "Money matters\n\n4Much of Auster’s writing since his early days of monetary struggle has returned to the problems of poverty and precarity that artists and authors often face, though the material aspect is often de-emphasised in favour of the symbolic or metaphorical. In Moon Palace, for example, Marco wears a suit that he inherited from his uncle, and makes furniture out of inherited books. However, the clothes and books are not so much signifiers of poverty as they are markers of an identity in the making – images of a young man trying to find his sense of self and his place in the world. In addition to the theme of poverty, Auster returns to stories more specifically surrounding the acquisition and loss of money. His characters inherit, gamble, earn and dispose of money in storylines that highlight questions of free will, chance and predestination. Auster’s autobiographical writings help us to understand that the preoccupation with the inheritance or windfall has its roots in the sum of money he inherited from his father. At the same time, writing about the father in The Invention of Solitude became an exploration of voice, identity, and authorial self. Since then the questions of money and authorship have been intertwined in different configurations.\n\n5In City of Glass, Daniel Quinn becomes so obsessed with the Stillman case that he devotes all his time and energy to it. He gives up his work as an author (significantly, an author who writes about a character called Work) in order to take up the work of the detective, but eventually he runs out of money and loses his home. One day, as he is walking down the street, he sees his reflection on a shop window and does not recognise himself. In this example, poverty and the loss of home are tied in with an exploration of the loss of selfhood. City of Glass contains memorable images of destitution and homelessness, but, as in Beckett, these images of vagrancy are not primarily used in a literal fashion, pointing rather to psychological and metaphysical concerns.\n\n6In the Country of Last Things takes up some of The New York Trilogy’s philosophical concerns and places them in a world more sharply defined by material want. The story provides a dystopian backdrop for an exploration of the power and function of language, but it also expresses real anxieties about urban living, about poverty, and the fight for diminishing resources in the modern world. The novel makes an extended analogy between money and language. In a world shaped by dearth and need, money loses its transactional value because there’s very little left to trade. At the same time, words start to disappear; they become detached, lose their meaning and vanish. Language is therefore shown to operate on the same principle as money: it gains meaning during transaction, and it produces signification by displacing it. Meanwhile, hunger is the main trope in In the Country of Last Things and its complex usage brings together ideas about money, food and words that we find in several of Auster’s works. As the inhabitants of this dystopian country go hungry, they find solace in using language to describe meals:\n\n7 Paul Auster, In the Country of Last Things, New York: Viking, 1987, 9-10.\n\nFood, of course, is one of the favorite subjects. Often you will overhear a group of people describing a meal in meticulous detail […] If the words can consume you, you will be able to forget your present hunger and enter what people call the ‘arena of the sustaining nimbus.’ There are even those who say that there is nutritional value in these food talks given the proper concentration and an equal desire to believe in the words.\n\n7The complex relationship between words that conjure up non-existing resources and words that ‘consume you’ is taken up elsewhere in early Auster. In City of Glass, for example,\n\n8 Paul Auster, City of Glass, in The New York Trilogy, London: Faber, 1987, 114.\n\nQuinn learned that eating did not necessarily solve the problem of food. A meal was no more than a fragile defence against the inevitability of the next meal. Food itself could never answer the question of food: it only delayed the moment when the question would have to be asked in earnest.\n\n10 Paul Auster, The Art of Hunger, op. cit., 13.\n\nHis fast, then is a contradiction. To persist in it would mean death, and with death the fast would end. He must therefore stay alive, but only to the extent that it keeps him on the point of death. The idea of ending is resisted in the interests of maintaining the constant possibility of the end.\n\n11The Music of Chance begins with a windfall: money inherited, seen as unearned, is spent with a recklessness that threatens to destabilise the individual. The literal and metaphorical drive to use his money up also compels Nashe to relinquish parental responsibility and to give up his relationship with Fiona. The unburdening that is precipitated by the inheritance becomes an experiment into the limits of selfhood: how much can Nashe get rid of while still remaining himself? A steady job, relationships and material possessions are disposed of with little thought or emotion in the mistaken belief that they form barriers to the attainment of personal freedom. In The Music of Chance, money buys and denies freedom in equal measure; it propels Jim Nashe while also hampering his progress:\n\n13 Paul Auster, The Music of Chance, New York: Viking, 1990, 17.\n\nThe money was responsible for his freedom, but each time he used it to buy another portion of that freedom, he was denying himself an equal portion of it as well. The money kept him going, but it was also an engine of loss, inexorably leading him back to the place where he had begun.\n\n12The paradox highlighted in this passage is strongly reminiscent of the hunger motif; in both cases, the problem and its solution double up on one another as in a Moebius strip. Whereas in earlier works by Auster such an image would convey primarily symbolic meaning, here the concern is with money as much as it is with monetary metaphor.\n\nEarned and unearned money\n\nWriting postcapitalist fiction\n\n16Auster has for a long time resisted the idea that his novels are about what he calls “sociology,” aiming instead for a symbolic or allegorical resonance that transcends the realities of each novel’s setting. He told Jonathan Lethem:\n\n19 Paul Auster, in Jonathan Lethem, “An Interview with Paul Auster”, op. cit.\n\nI want to write books that can be read a hundred years from now, and readers wouldn’t be bogged down by irrelevant details. You see, I’m not a sociologist, and the novel has often concerned itself with sociology. It’s one of the generating forces that’s made fiction interesting to people. But that’s not my concern. I’m interested in psychology. And also certain philosophical questions about the world. By removing the stories from the morass of things that surround us, I’m hoping to achieve some kind of purer approach to emotional life.\n\n18The crisis precipitated by the subprime mortgage scandal brought the paradoxes of money into sharper focus. It drew attention to the immateriality of money embodied in financial speculation and evocative phrases such as “futures trading,” which provided a stark contrast with the material reality of abandoned homes or the widely shared images of sacked workers. The enormity of the sums gained and lost in financial markets remained inconceivable to most people, while processes such as quantitative easing vexed the question of how money is actually created. The great discrepancy at the heart of our relationship with money, its tangibility and its lack of materiality, has interesting parallels with the paradoxes of signification that Auster has been pursuing in so much of his fiction. Sunset Park concerns itself with money, with the economic downturn, and with the fate of the American economy not only in direct thematic terms, but also in aesthetic ones. Money in this novel is treated as real and material, as well as being viewed as an abstraction with links to Auster’s previous preoccupations. The novel seeks to represent, recount and explain what happened when people started losing their homes, while also exploring new possibilities for artistic expression and novelistic practice. Auster has long been concerned with the relationship between language and things, between reality and fiction, and between interiority, subjectivity and narrative point of view. Here, he has used the economic downturn as a new means of exploring those issues in a new context. Sunset Park displays a preoccupation with the nature of money, and with its metaphoric and symbolic value. At the same time, questions of the value of cultural production and the monetisation of the life of the mind are brought to the fore.\n\nMoneyed culture\n\n21The link between an abstract, dematerialised understanding of money, and its effects on the sphere of cultural production, is more explicitly articulated by Jean-Joseph Goux:\n\n26 Jean-Joseph Goux, “Cash, Check, or Charge?”, in ed. Martha Woodmansee and Mark Osteen (eds.), The (...)\n\n[t]he fact that our century has experienced what has come to be called the dematerialization of money, leading to a radically nominalist conception of the monetary instrument and culminating in inconvertibility and floating exchange rates, and that this same century is also marked by an unprecedented rupture in the mode of representation as well as by a deepening concern with the nature of the sign and the philosophical status of language, is certainly not a simple coincidence.\n\n28 Johann Georg Hamann, qtd. in Richard T. Gray, “Buying into Signs”, op. cit., 109.\n\nmoney and language are two objects whose examination is as profound and abstract as their use is universal… the theory of one explains the theory of the other; for this reason, they appear to derive from common grounds. The richness of all human knowledge is based on the exchange of words… all the goods… of commercial and social life relate to money as their general measure.\n\n23In Sunset Park, Auster asks what happens when the two systems become too intertwined and interdependent. As the production of knowledge is more systematically tied in to the production of money, the phrase “richness of human knowledge” acquires a new meaning, and one that Auster does not welcome. Sunset Park bemoans the monetisation of culture and knowledge. The gifted Arts and Humanities graduates that Miles Heller meets in the squat not only struggle to make a living, but they hardly have any hope or faith in the future. Their commitment to the study of language, or the practice of art, places them in the margins of society. In this sense, the squat itself is an apt space for them. Squatting raises questions about legitimate or illegitimate ownership and occupancy. Squatters exist in the margins, removed from the mainstream world of regular employment and monthly mortgage repayments. As the squatters strive to affirm the importance of their pursuits, the squat comes to represent their rejection of monetised culture at the same time that it represents their exclusion from the mainstream. Home ownership is a powerful trope in the American imaginary, and in American literature. Its rejection, and the denial of opportunity to participate in this aspect of the American dream, are used in the novel as a form of social critique while also linking to Auster’s concern with the relationship between the material and the immaterial. Is a house bought on credit more legitimately owned than a squat? In both cases, the physical reality of bricks and mortar, of a roof over one’s head, is juxtaposed with the lack of materiality that a mortgage represents.\n\n24Sub-prime mortgages, in particular, exposed the immaterial nature of credit: people were allowed to buy homes using money they could never pay back, but as long as the repayment was not imminent, the debt could be deferred, the absence of money always displaced into a utopian future. As demonstrated earlier, Auster has always been fascinated with paradox, and we see his fascination with infinite deferral in the images of driving at speed, eating and fasting, and gaining and losing money. Like mortgages, like banknotes and coins, language works on the basis of deferral as well, and Sunset Park highlights those links. The preoccupation with the ways in which the loss of money and home affects individual lives is coupled with a wider artistic concern with finding a way to represent money. For Auster, who has always been interested in the relationship between words and things, the language of money is irresistible. Language and money both rely on the same principle of infinite deferral: just as a word is never the thing it signifies, a note or coin is not an item of value, but the representation of one. Sunset Park looks at what happens when the philosophy or the metaphysics of money collides with what he calls “the morass of things:” when abstract notions of value and trust translate into homes broken and lost, and lives ruined.\n\n30 Paul Auster, Sunset Park, London: Faber, 2010, 3.\n\nEach house is a story of failure – of bankruptcy and default, of debt and foreclosure - and he has taken it upon himself to document the last, lingering traces of those scattered lives in order to prove that the vanished families were once here, that the ghosts of people he will never know are still present in the discarded things strewn about their empty houses.\n\nMateriality and immateriality\n\n30Other chapters in the novel focus on Miles’s parents. His father owns a struggling publishing firm, and his mother is an actress preparing for the role of Winnie in Beckett’s Happy Days. Their professional struggles amplify the text’s concern with creative economies and consumerism. The choice of Happy Days is not coincidental: Winnie buried in the dust heap creates a powerful image that echoes the themes Auster explores in this novel: cultural production as work, and its place in a postcapitalist society. The humanities graduates in the squat are the products of a system that believes in the monetisation of knowledge and human imagination and yet does not value their creative output as work. They are thus forced into the margins of society, represented by the squat and their eventual eviction."
