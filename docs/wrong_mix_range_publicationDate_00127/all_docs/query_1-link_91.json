        "text": "Page 1 of 4\n\nThe Fortress of Solitude\n\nJonathan Lethem, 2003\n\nKnopf Doubleday\n\n528 pp.\n\nISBN-13: 9780375724886\n\nSummary\n\nThis is the story of two boys, Dylan Ebdus and Mingus Rude. They are friends and neighbors, but because Dylan is white and Mingus is black, their friendship is not simple. This is the story of their Brooklyn neighborhood, which is almost exclusively black despite the first whispers of something that will become known as \"gentrification.\"\n\nThis is the story of 1970s America, a time when the most simple human decisions—what music you listen to, whether to speak to the kid in the seat next to you, whether to give up your lunch money—are laden with potential political, social and racial disaster. This is the story of 1990s America, when no one cared anymore.\n\nThis is the story of punk, that easy white rebellion, and crack, that monstrous plague. This is the story of the loneliness of the avant-garde artist and the exuberance of the graffiti artist.\n\nThis is the story of what would happen if two teenaged boys obsessed with comic book heroes actually had superpowers: They would screw up their lives.\n\nThis is the story of joyous afternoons of stickball and dreaded years of schoolyard extortion. This is the story of belonging to a society that doesn't accept you. This is the story of prison and of college, of Brooklyn and Berkeley, of soul and rap, of murder and redemption. (From the publisher.)"
