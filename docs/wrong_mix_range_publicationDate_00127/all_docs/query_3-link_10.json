        "text": "1. ••• JONATHAN LETHEM CRITICS OFTEN USE the word prolific to describe Jonathan Lethem. He has published nine novels, five collections of stories, two essay volumes, a novella, and a comic book. But a better word for him might be protean. In the religion of the ancient Greeks, Proteus was a god of the sea who presided over unexpected change, a power that gave him the ability to alter .his shape whenever humans tried to compel him to foretell events. Like the mythical Proteus, Lethem is a shape-shifter whose work threads across boundaries of all kinds-the boundaries between detective :fiction, for example, and the \"serious\" literature of ideas. What Lethem has written about New York might be said to encapsulate his view of both life and art: To live in Manhattan is to be persistently amazed at the worlds squirreled inside one another, like those lines of television cable and fresh water and steam heat and outgoing sewage and telephone wire and whatever else which cohabit in the same intestinal holes that pavement- demolishing workmen periodically wrench open. . . . We only pretend to live\n\n2. on something as orderly as a grid. For Lethem, the writer's task is to look beneath the reassuring surface. He believes the truth is seldom found by stopping with the obvious or respecting conventions. Indeed, he sees the act of writing as fundamentally promiscuous. Perhaps it is not at all surprising that Lethem would have some unexpected ideas about what it means to be creative. Normally we think of creativity as the ability to say or do something completely original, but the isolation implied by this belief strikes Lethem as unappealing. Instead, he celebrates what he calls the \"ecstasy of influence.\" If we wish, we can treat words, ideas, and images as some- body's private property, but we can also view them as available for everyone to use. Nothing, he suggests, is totally original: everything is bound up with every- thing else, if not on the surface, then underneath, like the \"lines of television cable and fresh water\" hidden by the \"grid.\" Once we give up the idea of the private ownership of culture, writing and thinking take on a new life, as acts of generosity that place us in debt to everyone who .has made our creativity possible.

But where does that leave the writing done in the university itself? Most universities impose harsh penalties on plagiarists, the people who use the words of others without attribution-that is, without an acknowledgment of someone's prior ownership. Indeed, your own college or university might expel students found guilty of cheating. Where does cheating start and creativity stop? ••• The Ecstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism All mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one man\n\n4. dies, one chapter is not tom out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every chapter must be so translated .... -JOHN DONNE Love and Theft Consider this tale: a cultivated man of middle age looks back on the story of an amour Jou, one beginning when, traveling abroad, he takes a room as a lodger. The moment he sees the daughter of the house, he is lost. She is a preteen, whose charms instantly enslave him. Heedless of her age, he becomes intimate with her. In the end she dies, and the narrator-marked by her forever-remains alone. The name of the girl supplies the title of the story: Lolita. The author of the story I've described, Heinz von Lichberg, published his tale of Lolita in 1916, forty years before Vladimir Nabokov's novel. Lichberg later became a prominent journalist in the Nazi era, and his youthful works faded from view. Did Nabokov, who remained in Berlin until 1937, adopt Lichberg's tale consciously? Or did the earlier tale exist for Nabokov as a hidden, unacknowledged memory? The history of literature is not without examples of this phenomenon, called cryptomnesia. Another hypothesis is that Nabokov,\n\n5. knowing Lichberg's tale perfectly well, had set himself to that art of quotation that Thomas Mann, himself a master of it, called \"higher cribbing.\" Literature has always been a crucible in which familiar themes are continually recast. Little of what we admire in Nabokov's Lolita is to be found in its predecessor; the former is in no way deducible from the latter. Still: did Nabokov consciously borrow and quote? \"When you live outside the law, you have to eliminate dishonesty.\" The line comes from Don Siegel's 1958 film noir, The Lineup, written by Stirling THE ECSTASY OF INFLUENCE: A PLAGIARISM 233 Silliphant. The film still haunts revival houses, likely thanks to Eli Wallach's blaz- ing portrayal of a sociopathic hit man and to Siegel's long, sturdy auteurist career. Yet what were those words worth-to Siegel, or Silliphant, or their audience-- in 1958? And again: what was the line worth when Bob Dylan heard it (presum- ably in some Greenwich Village repertory cinema), cleaned it up a little, and inserted it into \"Absolutely Sweet Marie\"? What are they worth now, to the culture at large? Appropriation has always played a key role in Dylan's music. The songwriter has grabbed not only from a panoply of vintage Hollywood\n\n6. films but from Shakespeare and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Junichi Saga's Confessions ef a Yakuza. He also nabbed the title of Eric Lott's study of minstrelsy for his 2001 album Love and Theft. One imagines Dylan liked the general resonance of the title, in which emotional misdemeanors stalk the sweetness oflove, as they do so often in Dylan's songs. Lott's title is, of course, itself a riff on Leslie Fiedler's Love and Death in the American Novel, which famously identifies the literary motif of the interdependence of a white man and a dark man, like Huck and Jim or Ishmael and Queequeg-a series of nested references to Dylan's own appropriating, minstrel-boy sel£ Dylan's art offers a paradox: while it famously urges us not to look back, it also encodes a knowledge of past sources that might otherwise have little home in contemporary culture, like the Civil War poetry of the Confeder- ate bard Henry Timrod, resuscitated in lyrics on Dylan's newest record, Modem Times. Dylan's originality and his appropriations are as one. The same might be said of all art. I realized this forcefully when one day I went looking for the John Donne passage quoted above. I know the lines, I confess, not from a college course but from the movie version of 84, Charing Cross Road with Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft. I checked out 84, Char- ing Cross Road from the library in the hope of finding the\n\n7. Donne passage, but it wasn't in the book. It's alluded to in the play that was adapted from the book, but it isn't reprinted. So I rented the movie again, and there was the passage, read in voice-over by Anthony Hopkins but without attribution. Unfortunately, the line was also abridged so that, when I finally turned to the Web, I found myself searching for the line \"all mankind is of one volume\" instead of\"all man- kind is of one author, and is one volume.\" My Internet search was initially no more successful than my library search. I had thought that summoning books from the vasty deep was a matter of a few keystrokes, but when I visited the website of the Yale library, I found that most of its books don't yet exist as computer text. As a last-ditch effort I searched the seemingly more obscure phrase \"every chapter must be so translated.\" The pas- sage I wanted finally came to me, as it turns out, not as part of a scholarly library collection but simply because someone who loves Donne had posted it on his homepage. The lines I sought were from Meditation 17 in Devotions upon Emer- gent Occasions, which happens to be the most famous thing Donne ever wrote, containing as it does the line \"never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\" My search had led me from a movie to a book to a play to a website and back to a book. Then again, those words may be as\n\n8. famous as they are only because Hemingway lifted them for his book title. 234 JONATHAN LETHEM Literature has been in a plundered, fragmentary state for a long time. When I was thirteen I purchased an anthology of Beat writing. Immediately, and to my very great excitement, I discovered one William S. Burroughs, author of some- thing called Naked Lunch, excerpted there in all its coruscating brilliance. Burroughs was then as radical a literary man as the world had to offer. Nothing, in all my experience of literature since, has ever had as strong an effect on my sense of the sheer possibilities of writing. Later, attempting to understand this impact, I discovered that Burroughs had incorporated snippets of other writers' texts into his work, an action I knew my teachers would have called plagiarism. Some of these borrowings had been lifted from American science fiction of the Forties and Fifties, adding a secondary shock of recognition for me. By then I knew that this \"cut-up method,\" as Burroughs called it, was central to whatever he thought he was doing, and that he quite literally believed it to be akin to magic. When he wrote about his process, the hairs on my neck stood up, so palpable was the excitement. Burroughs was interrogating the\n\n9. universe with scis- sors and a paste pot, and the least imitative of authors was no plagiarist at all. Contamination Anxiety In 1941, on his front porch, Muddy Waters recorded a song for the folklorist Alan Lomax. After singing the song, which he told Lomax was entitled \"Coun- try Blues,\" Waters described how he came to write it. \"I made it on about the eighth of October '38,\" Waters said. \"I was fixin' a puncture on a car. I had been mistreated by a girl. I just felt blue, and the song fell into my mind and it come to me just like that and I started singing.\" Then Lomax, who knew of the Robert Johnson recording called \"Walkin' Blues,\" asked Waters if there were any other songs that used the same tune. \"There's been some blues played like that,\" Waters replied. \"This song comes from the cotton field and a boy once put a record out-Robert Johnson. He put it out as named 'Walkin' Blues.' I heard the tune before I heard it on the record. I learned it from Son House.\" In nearly one breath, Waters offers five accounts: his own active authorship: he \"made it\" on a specific date. Then the \"passive\" explanation: \"it come to me just like that.\" After Lomax raises the question of influence, Waters, without shame, misgivings, or trepidation, says that he heard a version by Johnson, but that his\n\n10. mentor, Son House, taught it to him. In the middle of that complex genealogy, Waters declares that \"this song comes from the cotton field.\" Blues and jazz musicians have long been enabled by a kind of\"open source\" culture, in which pre-existing melodic fragments and larger musical frameworks are freely reworked. Technology has only multiplied the possibilities; musicians have gained the power to duplicate sounds literally rather than simply approxi- mate them through allusion. In Seventies Jamaica, King Tubby and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry deconstructed recorded music, using astonishingly primitive pre-digital hardware, creating what they called \"versions.\" The recombinant nature of their means of production quickly spread to DJs in New York and London. Today an endless, gloriously impure, and fundamentally social process generates countless hours of music. THE ECSTASY OF INFLUENCE: A PLAGIARISM 235 Visual, sound, and text collage-which for many centuries were relatively fugitive traditions (a cento here, a folk pastiche there)-became explosively cen- tral to a series of movements in the twentieth century: futurism, cubism, Dada, rnusique concrete, situationism, pop art, and appropriationism. In fact, collage, the common denominator in that list, might be called the art form of the twen-\n\n11. tieth century, never mind the twenty-first. But forget, for the moment, chronol- ogies, schools, or even centuries. As examples accumulate-Igor Stravinsky's music and Daniel Johnston's, Francis Bacon's paintings and Henry Darger's, the novels of the Oulipo group and of Hannah Crafts (the author who pillaged Dickens's Bleak House to write The Bondwoman's Narrative), as well as cherished texts that become troubling to their admirers after the discovery of their \"plagia- rized\" elements, like Richard Condon's novels or Martin Luther King Jr.'s sermons-it becomes apparent that appropriation, mimicry, quotation, allusion, and sublimated collaboration consist of a kind of sine qua non of the creative act, cutting across all forms and genres in the realm of cultural production. In a courtroom scene from The Simpsons that has since entered into the tele- vision canon, an argument over the ownership of the animated characters Itchy and Scratchy rapidly escalates into an existential debate on the very nature of cartoons. \"Animation is built on plagiarism!\" declares the show's hot-tempered cartoon-producer-within-a-cartoon, Roger Meyers Jr. \"You take away our right to steal ideas, where are they going to come from?\" If nostalgic cartoonists had never borrowed from Fritz the Cat, there would be no Ren & Stimpy Show; without the Rankin/Bass and Charlie Brown Christmas specials,\n\n12. there would be no South Park; and without The Flintstones-more or less The Honeymooners in cartoon loincloths-The Simpsons would cease to exist. If those don't strike you as essential losses, then consider the remarkable series of \"plagiarisms\" that links Ovid's \"Pyramus and Thisbe\" with Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story, or Shakespeare's description of Cleopatra, copied nearly verbatim from Plutarch's life of Mark Antony and also later nicked by T. S. Eliot for The Waste Land. If these are examples of plagiarism, then we want more plagiarism. Most artists are brought to their vocation when their own nascent gifts are awakened by the work of a master. That is to say, most artists are converted to art by art itsel£ Finding one's voice isn't just an emptying and purifying oneself of the words of others but an adopting and embracing of filiations, communities, and discourses. Inspiration could be called inhaling the memory of an act never experienced. Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void but out of chaos. Any artist knows these truths, no matter how deeply he or she submerges that knowing. What happens when an allusion goes unrecognized? A closer look at The Waste Land may help make this point. The body of Eliot's poem\n\n13. is a vertiginous melange of quotation, allusion, and \"original\" writing. When Eliot alludes to Edmund Spenser's \"Prothalarnion\" with the line \"Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song,\" what of readers to whom the poem, never one of Spenser's most popular, is unfumiliar? (Indeed, the Spenser is now known largely because of Eliot's use of it.) Two responses are possible: grant the line to Eliot, or later 236 JONATHAN LETHEM discover the source and understand the line as plagiarism. Eliot evidenced no small anxiety about these matters; the notes he so carefully added to The Waste Land can be read as a symptom of modernism's contamination anxiety. Taken from this angle, what exactly is postmodernism, except modernism without the anxiety? Surrounded by Signs The surrealists believed that objects in the world possess a certain but unspecifi- able intensity that had been dulled by everyday use and utility. They meant to reanimate this dormant intensity, to bring their minds once again into close con- tact with the matter that made up their world. Andre Breton's maxim ''Beautiful\n\n14. as the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table\" is an expression of the belief that simply placing objects in an unexpected context reinvigorates their mysterious qualities. This \"crisis\" the surrealists identified was being simultaneously diagnosed by others. Martin Heidegger held that the essence of modernity was found in a cer- tain technological orientation he called \"enframing.\" This tendency encourages us to see the objects in our world only in terms of how they can serve us or be used by us. The task he identified was to find ways to resituate ourselves vis-a-vis these \"objects,\" so that we may see them as \"things\" pulled into relief against the ground of their functionality. Heidegger believed that art had the great potential to reveal the \"thingness\" of objects. The surrealists understood that photography and cinema could carry out this reanimating process automatically; the process of framing objects in a lens was often enough to create the charge they sought. Describing the effect, Walter Benjamin drew a comparison between the photographic apparatus and Freud's psychoanalytic methods. Just as Freud's theories \"isolated and made analyzable things which had heretofore floated along unnoticed in the broad stream of per- ception,\" the photographic apparatus focuses on \"hidden details of familiar\n\n15. objects,\" revealing \"entirely new structural formations of the subject.\" It's worth noting, then, that early in the history of photography a series of judicial decisions could well have changed the course of that art: courts were asked whether the photographer, amateur or professional, required permission before he could capture and print an image. Was the photographer stealing from the person or building whose photograph he shot, pirating something of private and certifiable value? Those early decisions went in favor of the pirates. Just as Walt Disney could take inspiration from Buster Keaton's Steamboat Bill, Jr., the Brothers Grimm, or the existence of real mice, the photographer should be free to capture an image without compensating the source. The world that meets our eye through the lens of a camera was judged to be, with minor excep- tions, a sort of public commons, where a cat may look at a king. Novelists may glance at the stuff of the world too, but we sometimes get called to task for it. For those whose ganglia were formed pre- TV, the mimetic deployment of pop-culture icons seems at best an annoying tic and at worst a dangerous vapidity that compromises fiction's seriousness by dating it out of the THE ECSTASY OF INFLUENCE: A PLAGIARISM 237\n\n16. Platonic Always, where_ it ought to reside. In a graduate workshop I briefly passed through, a certam gray eminence tried to convince us that a literary story should always eschew \"any feature which serves to date it\" because \"serious :fiction must be Timeless.\" When we protested that, in his own well-known work, characters moved about electrically lit rooms, drove cars, and spoke not Anglo-Saxon but postwar English-and further, that fiction he'd himself ratified as great, such as Dickens, was liberally strewn with innately topical, commercial, and timebound references-he impatiently amended his proscription to those explicit references. that would date a story in the \"frivolous Now.\" When pressed, he said of course he meant the \"trendy mass-popular- media\" reference. Here, trans-generational discourse broke down. I was born in 1964; I grew up watching Captain Kangaroo, moon landings, zillions of TV ads, the Banana Splits, M*A *S*H, and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. I was born with words in my mouth-\"Band-Aid,\" \"Q-tip,\" \"Xerox\"-object-names as :fixed and eternal in my logosphere as \"taxicab\" and \"toothbrush.\" The world is a home littered with pop-culture products and their emblems. I also came of age swamped by parodies that stood for originals yet mysterious to me-I knew Monkees before Beatles, Belmondo before Bogart, and \"remember\" the movie Summer ef '42 from a Mad magazine\n\n17. satire, though I've still never seen the :film itsel£ I'm not alone in having been born backward into an incoherent realm of texts, products, and images, the commercial and cul- tural environment with which we've both supplemented and blotted out our natural world. I can no more claim it as \"mine\" than the sidewalks and forests of the world, yet I do dwell in it, and for me to stand a chance as either artist or citizen, I'd probably better be permitted to name it. Consider Walker Percy's The Moviegoer: Other people, so I have read, treasure memorable moments in their lives: the time one climbed the Parthenon at sunrise, the summer night one met a lonely girl in Central Park and achieved with her a sweet. and natural relationship, as they say in books. I too once met a girl in Central Park, but it is not much to remember. What I remember is the time John Wayne killed three men with a carbine as he was falling to the dusty street in Stagecoach, and the time the kitten found Orson Welles in the doorway in The Third Man. Today, when we can eat Tex-Mex with chopsticks while listening to reggae and watching a YouTube rebroadcast of the Berlin Wall's fall- i.e., when damn near everything presents itself as familiar-it's not a surprise that\n\n18. some of today's most ambitious art is going about trying to make the familiar strange. In so doing, in reirnagining what human life might truly be like over there across the chasms of illusion, mediation, demographics, marketing, imago, and appearance, artists are paradoxically trying to restore what's taken for \"real\" to three whole dimensions to reconstruct a univocally round world out of disparate streams of flat sights. ' Whatever charge of tastelessness or trademark violation may be attached to the artistic appropriation of the media environment in which we swim, the alternative-to flinch, or tiptoe away into some ivory tower of irrelevance-is far worse. We're surrounded by signs; our imperative is to ignore none of them. 238 JONATHAN LETHEM Usemonopoly The idea that culture can be property-intellectual property-is used to justify everything from attempts to force the Girl Scouts to pay royalties for singing songs around campfires to the infringement suit brought by the estate of Margaret Mitchell against the publishers of Alice Randall's The Wind Done Gone. C~rpora- tions like Celera Genomics have filed for patents for human\n\n19. genes, while the Recording Industry Association of America has sued music downloaders for co~y- right infringement, reaching out-of-court settlements for thousands of dollars with defendants as young as twelve. ASCAP bleeds fees from shop owners who play background music in their stores; students and scholars _are shame~ fro~ placing texts facedown on photocopy machines. At the same tune, copynght 1s revered by most established writers and artists as a birthright ~nd bulwark, the_ s~urce of nurture for their iniini.tely fragile practices in a rapaaous world. Plagiansm and piracy, after all, are the monsters we working artists are taught to drea~, as they roam the woods surrounding our tiny preserves of regard and remuneration. A time is marked not so much by ideas that are argued about as by ideas that are taken for granted. The character of an era hangs upon w~t needs no_ defens:. In this regard, few of us question the contemporary construction of copynght. I~ is taken as a law both in the sense of a universally recognizable moral absolute, like the law ag~t murder, and as naturally inherent in our ':orld, ~e the l_a':' of gravity. In fact, it is neither. Rather, copyright is_~ ongom~ soaal _negotiation, tenuously forged, endlessly revised, and imperfect m its every mca~tion. Thomas Jefferson, for one, considered copyright a necessary\n\n20. evil: he favo~ed providing just enough incentive to create, not~g more, :md thereafter _allowing ideas to flow freely, as nature intended. His conception o~ cop~ght was enshrined in the Constitution, which gives Congress the authonty to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securin~ for ~ted Times _to Au~o~ and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Wntmgs and D1scovenes. This was a balancing act between creators and society as a w~~le; ~econd comers might do a much better job than the originator ~th the ongmal 1~ea. But Jefferson's vision has not fared well, has m fact been steadily eroded by those who view the culture as a market in which everything of value should be owned by someone or other. The distinctive feature of modem American c~py- right law is its almost limitless bloating-its expansio~ in both. scope ~d du:ation. With no registration requirement, every creative act m a tangible medi1:11111s now subject to copyright protection: your email to your child or your child's ~er painting, both are automatically protected. The first Congress to grant copynght gave authors an initial term of fourteen years, which ~ould b~ renewed for another fourteen if the author still lived. The current term is tlie life of the author plus seventy years. It's only a slight exaggeration to sa~ tliat ~ch time Iv.lickey Mouse\n\n21. is about to fall into tlie public domain, the mouse s copynght t:rrn 1s ex_tended. Even as the law becomes more restrictive, technology 1s exposmg those restrictions as bizarre and arbitrary. When old laws fixed on reproduction as the compensable (or actionable) unit, it wasn't because there was anything ~nda- mentally invasive of an autlior's rights in the making of a copy. Rather it was THE ECSTASY OF INFLUENCE: A PLAGIARISM 239 because copies were once easy to find and count, so tliey made a useful bench- mark for deciding when an owner's rights had been invaded. In the contempo- rary world, though, the act of \"copying\" is in no meaningful sense equivalent to an infringement-we make a copy every time we accept an emailed text, or send or forward one--and is impossible anymore to regulate or even describe. At the movies, my entertainment is sometimes lately preceded by a dire trailer, produced by the lobbying group called the Motion Picture Association of America, in which the purchasing of a bootleg copy of a Hollywood film is compared to the theft of a car or a handbag-and, as tlie bullying supertitles remind us, \"You wouldn't steal a handbag!\" This conflation forms an incitement to quit tliinking. If I were to tell you that pirating DVDs or\n\n22. downloading music is in no way different from loaning a friend a book, my own arguments would be as ethically bankrupt as the MP AA's. The truth lies somewhere in the vast gray area between these two overstated positions. For a car or a handbag, once stolen, no longer is available to its owner, while the appropriation of an article of \"intellectual property\" leaves tlie original untouched. As Jefferson wrote, \"He who receives an idea from me, receives iristruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.\" Yet industries of cultural capital, who profit not from creating but from distrib- uting, see the sale of culture as a zero-sum game. The piano-roll publishers fear the record comparries, who fear tlie cassette-tape manufacturers, who fear the online vendors, who fear whoever else is next in line to profit most quickly from the intan- gible and infinitely reproducible fruits of an artist's labor. It has been the same in every industry and witli every technological irmovation. Jack Valenti, speaking for the MPAA: \"I say to you tliat the VCR is to tlie American film producer and tlie American public as the Boston Strangler is to the woman home alone.\" Thinking clearly sometimes requires unbraiding our language. The word \"copyright\" may eventually seem as dubious in its embedded\n\n23. purposes as \"family values,\" \"globalization,\" and, sure, \"intellectual property.\" Copyright is a \"right\" in no absolute sense; it is a government-granted monopoly on the use of creative results. So let's try calling it that-not a right but a monopoly on use, a \"usemonopoly\"-and then consider how the rapacious … Grading Rubric for MUS 81A Written Work Criteria Excellent Above Average Average Below Average Failing Format: 10 points possible 10 points 8 points 5 points 2 points 0 points Name on paper Required length Name in file name Sent as required Follows specified format with intro, body &\n\n24. conclusion Neat appearance Proper citations and Documentation (Works Cited or Bibliography) Missed one of the formatting requirements Missed two of the formatting requirements Missed three or four of the formatting requirements Did not follow format directions.

T R A N S I T I ON Conversation NAPPY HAPPY A Conversation with Ice Cube and Angela Y. Davis. You may love him or loathe him, but you have to take him seriously. O'Shea Jackson-better known by his nom de mi- crophone, Ice Cube-may be the most successful \"hardcore\" rap artist in the re- cording industry. And his influence as a trendsetter in black youth culture is un- rivaled. According to some academic analysts, Ice Cube qualifies as an \"or- ganic intellectual\" (in Antonio Gramsci's famous phrase): someone organically connected to the community he would uplift. He is, at the same time, an American success story. It was as a member of the Compton-based rap group NWA that he first came to prominence in 1988 at the\n\n35. age of 18. Less than two years later, he left the group over a dispute about money, and went solo. Amerikkka's Most Wanted, his gritty debut album, went platinum-and the rest is recording his- tory. Ice Cube is also a multimedia phe- nomenon. Artless, powerful perfor- mances in films by John Singleton and Walter Hill have established him as a commanding screen presence. That, combined with his streetwise credibility, has been a boon for St. Ides malt liquor, which has paid generously for his ongo- ing \"celebrity endorsement.\" Naturally, it's a relationship that has aroused some skepticism. While Public Enemy's Chuck D, for example, has inveighed against an industry that exacts a tragic toll in America's inner cities, even suing a malt liquor company that used one of his cuts to promote its product, Ice Cube\n\n36. defends his role in touting booze in the 'hood-even though, having joined the Nation of Islam, he says he's now a tee- totaller. \"I do what I want to do,\" he says of his malt liquor ads. Some of his other celebrity endorse- ments have raised eyebrows as well. For example, at the end of a press conference last year, Ice Cube held up a copy of a book entitled The Secret Relationship Be- tween Blacks and Jews, which purports to reveal the \"massive\" and \"inordinate\" role of the Jews in a genocidal campaign against blacks. \"Try to find this book,\" he exhorted, \"everybody.\" But then Ice Cube is no stranger to controversy, and his second album Death Certificate has certainly not been without its critics. The album, which has sold\n\n37. 174 TRANSITION ISSUE 58 This content downloaded from 128.114.228.120 on Thu, 04 May 2017 18:36:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms over a million copies, delivers a strong message of uplift and affirmation . . . unless you happen to be female, Asian, Jewish, gay, white, black, whatever. So, for instance, in the song \"No Va- seline,\" Ice Cube calls for the death of Jerry Heller, his former manager, and imagines torching NWA rapper Eazy-E for having \"let a Jew break up your crew.\" In \"Horny Lil' Devil,\" Cube speaks of castrating white men who go out with black women. (\"True Niggers ain't gay,\" he advises in the course of this cut.) In \"Black Korea,\" he warns Korean grocers to \"pay respect to the black fist, or we'll burn your store down to a crisp.\" You get the picture. Not exactly\n\n38. \"It's a Small World After All.\" Still, Ice Cube's champions-and stalwart defenders-are legion. \"I have seen the future of American culture and he's wearing a Raiders hat,\" proclaimed the music criticJames Bernard. \"Cube's album isn't about racial hatred,\" opined Dane L. Webb, then executive editor of Larry Flynt's Rappages. \"It's about have- nots pointing fingers at those who have. And the reality for most Black people is that the few that have in our communities are mostly Asian or Jewish. And when a Black man tells the truth about their oppressive brand of democracy in our community, they 'Shut 'Em Down.'\" \"When Ice Cube says that NWA is con- trolled by a Jew,\" Chuck D protested, \"how is that anti-Semitism, when Heller is a Jew?\" The journalist Scott Poulson- Bryant pointedly observed that most of Cube's critics are unconcerned when he advocates hatred and violence toward\n\n39.

Thus Manning Marable, the radical scholar and commentator, ques- tions the rap artist's \"political maturity and insight\" and insists that \"people\n\n40. of color must transcend the terrible ten- dency to blame each other, to empha- size their differences, to trash one another. ... A truly multicultural de- mocracy which empowers people of color will never be won if we tolerate bigotry with our own ranks, and turn our energies to undermine each other.\" And what of the legendary Angela Y. Davis? In some ways, hers, too, was an American success story, but with a twist. Raised in Birmingham, Alabama, Davis went on to graduate magna cum laude from Brandeis University and work on her doctorate under Herbert Marcuse at the University of California, San Diego, and teach philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles. In a few short years, however, her political commit- ments made her a casualty of the gov- ernment's war against black radicalism:\n\n41. the philosopher was turned into a fugi- tive from justice. In 1970, by the age of twenty-six, she had made the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List (which described her as \"armed and dangerous\") and appeared on the cover of Newsweek-in chains. Now a professor in the History of Consciousness program at the Univer- sity of California, Santa Cruz, Davis has made her mark as a social theorist, elab- orating her views on the need for a trans- racial politics of alliance and transfor- mation in two widely cited collections of essays, Women, Race, & Class and Women, Culture, & Politics. Cautioning against the narrow-gauged black nation- alism of the street, Davis is wont to decry anti-Semitism and homophobia in the same breath as racism. \"We do not draw the color line,\" she writes in her latest book. \"The only line we draw is one based on our political principles.\"\n\n42. So the encounter between them-a two hour conversation held at Street Knowledge, Cube's company offices- was an encounter between two different perspectives, two different activist tradi- tions, and, of course, two different gen- erations. While Davis's background has disposed her to seek common ground with others, these differences may have been both constraining and productive. Davis notes with misgivings that Death Certificate was not released until after the conversation was recorded, so that she did not have the opportunity to listen to more than a few songs. She writes: \"Considering the extremely problematic content of 'Black Korea,' I regret that I was then unaware of its inclusion on the album. My current political work in- volves the negotiation of cross-cultural alliances-especially among people of\n\n43. color-in developing opposition to hate violence. Had I been aware of this song, it would have certainly provided a the- matic focus for a number of questions that unfortunately remain unexplored in this conversation.\" Angela Y. Davis: I want to begin by acknowledging our very different posi- tions. We represent different generations 176 TRANSITION ISSUE 58 This content downloaded from 128.114.228.120 on Thu, 04 May 2017 18:36:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms and genders: you are a young man and I am a mature woman. But I also want to acknowledge our affinities. We are both African Americans, who share a cultural tradition as well as a passionate concern for our people. So, in exploring our dif- ferences in the course of this conversa- tion, I hope we will discover common ground. Now, I am of the same gener-\n\n44. ation as your mother. Hip-hop culture is a product of the younger generation of sisters and brothers in our community. I am curious about your attitude toward the older generation. How do you and your peers see us? Ice Cube: When I look at older people, I don't think they feel that they can learn from the younger generation. I try and tell my mother things that she just doesn't want to hear sometimes. She is so used to being a certain way: she's from the South and grew up at a time when the South was a very dangerous place. I was born in Los Angeles in 1969. When I started school, it was totally different from when she went to school. What she learned was totally different from what I learned. AYD: I find that many of the friends I have in my own age group are not very\n\n45. receptive to the culture of the younger generation. Some of them who have looked at my CDs have been surprised to see my collection of rap music. Invari- ably, they ask, \"Do you really listen to that?\" I remind them that our mothers and fathers probably felt the same way about the music we listened to when we were younger. If we are not willing to attempt to learn about youth culture, communication between generations will be as difficult as it has always been. We need to listen to what you are saying-as hard as it may be to hear it. And believe me, sometimes what I hear in your music thoroughly assaults my ears. It makes me feel as if much of the work we have done over the last decades to change our self-representations as Af- rican Americans means little or nothing to so many people in your generation. At\n\n46. the same time, it is exhilarating to hear your appeal to young people to stand up and to be proud of who they are, who we are. But where do you think we are right now, in the 1990s? Do you think that each generation starts where the preced- ing one left off? The war against gangs is a war against our kids IC: Of course. We're at a point when we can hear people like the L.A. police chief on TV saying we've got to have a war on gangs. I see a lot of black parents clap- ping and saying: Oh yes, we have to have a war on gangs. But when young men with baseball caps and T-shirts are con- sidered gangs, what these parents are do- ing is clapping for a war against their children. When people talk about a war\n\n47. on gangs, they ain't going to North of Pico or Beverly Hills. They are going to come to South Central L. A. They are go- ing to go to Watts, to Long Beach, to Compton. They are going to East Oak- land, to Brooklyn. That war against gangs is a war against our kids. So the media, the news, have more influence on our parents than we in the community. The parents might stay in the house all day. They go back and forth to work.

The gang members know everybody up and down the street. AYD: During the late sixties, when I lived in Los Angeles, my parents were utterly opposed to my decision to be-\n\n48. come active in the Black Panther Party and in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Co- ordinating Committee]. They were an- gry at me for associating myself with what was called \"black militancy\" even though they situated themselves in a pro- gressive tradition. In the thirties, my mother was active in the campaign on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine-you know about the nine brothers who were falsely charged with raping three white women in Scottsboro, Alabama. They spent almost all of their lives in prison. My mother was involved in that cam- paign, confronting racism in a way that makes me feel scared today. But when she saw me doing something similar to what she had done in her youth, she be- came frightened. Now she understands that what I did was important. But at the\n\n49. time she couldn't see it. I wish that when I was in my twenties, I had taken the ini- tiative to try and communicate with my mother, so that I could have discovered that bridging the great divide between us was a similar passion toward political ac- tivism. I wish I had tried to understand that she had shaped my own desire to actively intervene in the politics of rac- ism. It took me many years to realize that in many ways I was just following in her footsteps. Which brings me to some ob- servations about black youth today and the respect that is conveyed in the pop- ular musical culture for those who came before-for Malcolm, for example. What about the parents of the young people who listen to your music? How do you relate to them? IC: Well, the parents have to have open minds. The parents have to build a bond,\n\n50. a relationship with their kids, so Ice Cube doesn't have control of their kid. They do. Ice Cube is not raising their kid. They are. AYD: But you are trying to educate them. IC: Of course. Because the school sys- tem won't do it. Rap music is our net- work. It's the only way we can talk to each other, almost uncensored. AYD: So what are you talking to each other about? IC: Everybody has a different way. My first approach was holding up the mir- ror. Once you hold up a mirror, you see yourself for who you are, and you see the things going on in the black community. Hopefully, it scares them so much that they are going to want to make a change, or it's going to provoke some thought in that direction.\n\n51. AYD: Am I correct in thinking that when you tell them, through your mu- sic, what is happening in the commu- nity, you play various roles, you become different characters? The reason I ask this question is because many people assume that when you are rapping, your words reflect your own beliefs and values. For example, when you talk about \"bitches\" and \"hoes,\" the assumption is that you believe women are bitches and hoes. Are you saying that this is the accepted lan- guage in some circles in the community? 178 TRANSITION ISSUE 58 This content downloaded from 128.114.228.120 on Thu, 04 May 2017 18:36:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms That this is the vocabulary that young people use and you want them to observe themselves in such a way that may also\n\n52. cause them to think about changing their attitudes? IC: Of course. People who say Ice Cube thinks all women are bitches and hoes are not listening to the lyrics. They ain't lis- tening to the situations. They really are not. I don't think they really get past the profanity. Parents say, \"Uh-oh, I can't hear this,\" but we learned it from our parents, from the TV. This isn't some- thing new that just popped up. AYD: What do you think about all the efforts over the years to transform the language we use to refer to ourselves as black people and specifically as black women? I remember when we began to eliminate the word \"Negro\" from our vocabulary. It felt like a personal victory for me when that word became obsolete. As a child I used to cringe every time someone referred to me as a \"Negro,\" whether it was a white person or another\n\n53. \"Negro.\" I didn't know then why it made me feel so uncomfortable, but later I realized that \"Negro\" was virtually synonymous with the word \"slave.\" I had been reacting to the fact that every- where I turned I was being called a slave. White people called me a slave, black people called me a slave, and I called my- self a slave. Although the word \"Negro\" is Spanish for the color black, its usage in English has always implied racial inferi- ority. When we began to rehabilitate the word \"black\" during the mid-sixties, coining the slogan \"Black is beautiful,\" calling ourselves black in a positive and self-affirming way, we also began to crit- icize the way we had grown accustomed to using the word \"nigger.\" \"Negro\" was just a proper way of saying \"nig- ger.\" An important moment in the pop- ular culture of the seventies was when\n\n54. Richard Prior announced that he was eliminating \"nigger\" from his vocabu- lary. How do you think progressive Afri- can Americans of my generation feel when we hear all over again-especially in hip hop culture- \"nigger, nigger, nig- ger\"? How do you think black feminists like myself and younger women as well respond to the word \"bitch\"? IC: The language of the streets is the only language I can use to communicate with the streets. You have to build people up. You have to get under them and then lift. You know all of this pulling from on top ain't working. So we have to take the language of the streets, tell the kids about the situation, tell them what's really go- ing on. Because some kids are blind to what they are doing, to their own ac-\n\n55. tions. Take a football player-a quarter- back. He's on the field, right in the ac- We have a lot of people out there just looking to get paid. I'm looking to earn, but I'm not looking to get paid tion. But he still can't see what's going on. He's got to call up to somebody that has a larger perspective. It's the same thing I'm doing. It's all an evolution pro- cess. It's going to take time. Nothing's going to be done overnight. But once we start waking them up, opening their eyes, then we can start putting some- NAPPY HAPPY 179 This content downloaded from 128.114.228.120 on Thu, 04 May 2017 18:36:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms thing in there. If you start putting some-\n\n56. thing in there while their eyes are closed, that ain't doing no good. AYD: Your first solo album, Ameri- kkka's Most Wanted, went gold in ten days without any assistance from the radio and the normal network, and went plat- inum in three months. Why do you think young sisters and brothers are so drawn to your voice, your rap, your message? IC: The truth. We get a lot of brothers who talk to a lot of people. But they ain't saying nothing. Here's a brother who's saying something- who won't sell him- self out. Knowing that he won't sell him- self out, you know he won't sell you out. We have a brother who ain't looking to get paid. I'm looking to earn, but I'm not looking to get paid. You have a lot of\n\n57. people out there just looking to get paid. We've got a lot of people in the position of doing music, and all they want to talk about is \"baby don't go, I love you,\" \"please come back to me,\" and \"don't worry, be happy.\" AYD: What's the difference between what you tried to do on Amerikkka's Most Wanted and on Death Certificate? IC: Well in Amerikkka's Most Wanted, I was still blind to the facts. I knew a few things, but I didn't know what I know now. I've grown as a person. When I grow as a person, I grow as an artist. I think that this new album, Death Certif- icate, is just a step forward. AYD: Perhaps you can say how this al- bum is evidence of your own growth and development in comparison to Ameri- kkka's Most Wanted.\n\n58. IC: I think I have more knowledge of self. I am a little wiser than I was. In Amerikkka's Most Wanted, even though it was a good album-it was one of the best albums of the year-I was going through a lot of pressure personally. With this new album, Death Certificate, I can look at everything, without any personal problems getting in the way. It's all about the music. AYD: I am interested in what you've said about the difference between side A and side B. IC: Death Certificate is side A. Most peo- ple liken it to \"gangster rap.\" \"Reality rap\" is what it is. Side A starts off with a funeral, because black people are men- tally dead. It's all about getting that across in the music. A lot of people like the first side. It's got all that you would expect. At the end of the first side, the\n\n59. death side, I explain that people like the first side because we're mentally dead. That's what we want to hear now. We don't love ourselves, so that's the type of music we want to hear. The B side- which is the life side-starts off with a birth and is about a consciousness of where we need to be, how we need to look at other people, how we need to look at ourselves and reevaluate our- selves. AYD: Let's talk about \"party politics.\" When kids are partying to your music, they are also being influenced by it, even though they may not be consciously fo- cusing on what they need to change in their lives. IC: I wouldn't say my music is party mu- sic. Some of the music is \"danceable.\" 180 TRANSITION ISSUE 58 This content downloaded from 128.114.228.120 on Thu, 04 May\n\n60. 2017 18:36:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms But a lot of it is something that you put on in your Walkman and listen to. AYD: But what kind of mood does it put you in? Isn't it the rhythm, the beat that captures you, that makes you feel good? IC: You should feel good when you learn it. AYD: I have talked to many of my young friends who listen to you and say, \"This brother can rap!\" They are really impressed by your music, but they sometimes feel embarrassed that they unthinkingly follow the lyrics and some- times find themselves saying things that challenge their political sensibilities. Like using the word \"bitch,\" for example. Which means that it is the music that is foregrounded and the lyrics become sec-\n\n61. ondary. This makes me wonder whether the message you are conveying some- times escapes the people that you are try- ing to reach. IC: Well, of course it's not going to reach everybody in the same way. Maybe the people that are getting it can tell the brother or the sister that ain't getting it. I think what my man's trying to say here is called breakdown. You know what I'm saying? Once you have knowledge, it is just in your nature to give it up. AYD: I took your video-\"Dead Homies\"-to the San Francisco County Jail and screened it for the sisters there who recently had been involved in a se- ries of fights among themselves in the dorm. They had been fighting over who gets to use the telephone, the micro- wave, and things like that. The guards\n\n62. had constantly intervened-they come in at the slightest pretext, even when some- body raises their voice. Your video, your song about young people killing each other, provided a basis for a wonderful, enlightening conversation among the women in the jail. They began to look at themselves and the antagonisms among them in a way that provoked them to think about changing their attitudes. IC: Let me tell you something. What we have is kids looking at television, hearing the so-called leaders in this capitalist system saying: It's not all right to be poor-if you're poor you're nothing- get more. And they say to the women: You got to have your hair this way, your eyes got to be this way. You got to have this kind of purse or that kind of shoes. There are the brothers who want the women. And the women have the atti-\n\n63. tude of \"that's what we want.\" I call it the \"white hype.\" What you have is black people wanting to be like white people, not realizing that white people want to be like black people. So the best thing to do is to eliminate that type of thinking. You need black men who are not looking up to the white man, who are not trying to be like the white man. AYD: What about the women? You keep talking about black men. I'd like to hear you say: black men and black women. IC: Black people. AYD: I think that you often exclude your sisters from your thought process. We're never going to get anywhere if we're not together.

AYD: The black woman's down too. IC: But the black woman can't look up to the black man until we get up. AYD: Well why should the black woman look up to the black man? Why can't we look at each other as equals? IC: If we look at each other on an equal level, what you're going to have is a di- vide. AYD: As I told you, I teach at the San Francisco County Jail. Many of the women there have been arrested in con- nection with drugs. But they are invis- ible to most people. People talk about the drug problem without mentioning the fact that the majority of crack users in our community are women. So when we talk about progress in the community, we have to talk about the sisters as well\n\n65. as the brothers. IC: The sisters have held up the com- munity. AYD: When you refer to \"the black man,\" I would like to hear something ex- plicit about black women. That will con- vince me that you are thinking about your sisters as well as your brothers. IC: I think about everybody. AYD: We should be able to speak for each other. The young sister has to be capable of talking about what's happen- ing to black men-the fact that they are dying, they're in prison; they are as en- dangered as the young female half of our community. As a woman I feel a deep responsibility to stand with my brothers and to do whatever I can to halt that vi- cious cycle. But I also want the brothers to become conscious of what's happen- ing to the sisters and to stand with them and to speak out for them.\n\n66. IC: We can't speak up for the sisters until we can speak up for ourselves. AYD: Suppose I say you can't speak up for yourselves until you can also speak up for the sisters. As a black woman I don't think I can speak up for myself as a woman unless I can speak up for my brothers as well. If we are talking about an entire community rising out of pov- erty and racism, men will have to learn how to challenge sexism and to fight on behalf of women. IC: Of course. AYD: In this context, let's go back to your first album. I know that most women-particularly those who identify with feminism or with women's move- ments-ask you about \"You Can't Faze Me.\" Having been involved myself with the struggle for women's reproductive rights, my first response to this song was one of deep hurt. It trivializes something\n\n67. that is extremely serious. It grabs people in a really deep place. How many black women died on the desks of back alley abortionists when abortion was illegal before 1973? Isn't it true that the same ultraright forces who attack the rights of people of color today are also calling for the criminalization of abortion? 182 TRANSITION ISSUE 58 This content downloaded from 128.114.228.120 on Thu, 04 May 2017 18:36:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Women should have the right to exercise some control over what happens to our bodies.

FRANKLIN FOER FRANKLIN FOER (RHYMES WITH \"LORE\") is a writer long associated with the liberal magazine the New Republic, which was founded in 1914 by leaders of the Pro- gressive movement. Impatient with the mainstream media, which these leaders saw as controlled by moneyed interests, they were hoping to create an indepen- dent journal of ideas. Since then, the New Republic has seen its ups and downs, but the near-collapse of the magazine during Foer's second stint as editor exposes the stubborn persistence of the problem it was founded to address: the survival of independent media in a highly unequal society like ours. In 1914, the elite owed their towering wealth to railroads, coal mines and oil wells; today they control the Internet and the \"attention economy.\" Foer was a casualty and not the cause of the magazine's decline. After a term as editor, he left to pursue other projects when he was lured back to the editor's post by Chris Hughes, then a boyish 28-year-old lucky enough to have shared a room with Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg when the two were students at Harvard. As part of the original Facebook team, Hughes later sold his interest in the platform for an amount purportedly in excess of700 million dollars. And that enormous wealth encouraged him to think that he could reshape\n\n69. the nation's cultural life in the ways he thought best. One of his first moves was to buy the New Republic, a respected but financially strapped print magazine. At first, the New Republic's journalists welcomed Hughes as a white knight who had arrived in the nick of time to save them from the problems created by the shift away from print to the Internet. They interpreted the return of Foer as a sign of Hughes' commitment to serious, hard-hitting analysis. But gradually the writers at the magazine realized that their owner had something else in mind, as Sarah Ellison reports in Vanity Fair, another mass-market periodical: Over time, one of the big :flash points that developed between Hughes and his New Republic writers was their productivity.

All the values it professes are the values of the sixties. The big tech companies present themselves as platforms- for personal liberation, just as Stewart Brand preached. Everyone has the right to speak their mind on social media, to fulfill their intellectual and democratic potential, to express their individuality. Where television had been a passive medium that rendered citizens inert, Facebook is\n\n72. participatory and empowering. It allows users to read widely, think for themselves, and form their own opinions. We can't entirely dismiss this rhetoric. There are parts of the world, even in the United States, where Facebook emboldens citizens and enables them to organize themselves in opposition to power. But we shouldn't accept Facebook's self-conception as sincere, either. Facebook is a carefully managed top-down system, not a robust public square. It mimics some of the patterns of conversation, 104 FRANKLIN FOER but that's a surface trail. In reality, Face book is a tangle of rules and procedures for sorting .information, rules devised by the corporation for the ultimate benefit of the corporation. Facebook is always surveilling users, always auditing them, using them as lab rats in its behavioral experiments. Wbile it creates the impres- sion that it offers choice, Facebook patemalistically nudges users in the direction it deems best for them, which also happens to be the direction that thoroughly addicts them. It's a phoniness most obvious in the compressed, historic career of Facebook's mastermind.\n\n73. Mark Zuckerberg is a good boy, but he wanted to be bad, or maybe just a little bit naughty. The heroes of his adolescence were the original hackers. Let's be precise about the term. His idols weren't malevolent data thieves or cyber-terrorists. In the parlance of hacker culture, such ill-willed outlaws are known as crackers. Zuck- erberg never put crackers on a pedestal Still, his hacker heroes were disrespectful of authority. They were technically virtuosic, infinitely resourceful nerd cowboys, unbound by conventional thinking. In MIT's labs, during the sixties and seven- ties, they broke any rule that interfered with building the stuff of early computing, such marvels as the .first video games and word processors. With their free time, they played epic pranks, which happened to draw further attention to their own cleverness-installing a living, breathing cow on the roof of a Cambridge dorm; launching a weather balloon, which miraculously emerged from beneath the turf, emblazoned with \"MIT,\" in the middle of a Harvard-Yale football game. The hackers' archenemies were the bureaucrats who ran universities, corpo- rations, and governments. Bureaucrats talked about making the world more effi- cient, just like the hackers. But they were really small-minded paper-pushers who fiercely guarded the .information they held, even when that .information yearned to be shared. When hackers clearly engineered better ways of\n\n74. doing things--a box that enabled free long-distance calls, an instruction that might improve an operat- ing system-the bureaucrats stood in their way, wagging an unbending finger. The hackers took aesthetic and comic pleasure if!- outwitting the men in suits. When Zuckerberg arrived at Harvard in the fall of 2002, the heyday of the hackers had long passed. They were older guys now, the stuff of good tales, some stuck in twilight struggles against The Man. But Zuckerberg wanted to hack, too, and with that old-time indifference to norms. In high school- using the nom de hack Zuck Fader-he picked the lock that prevented outsiders from fiddling with AOL's code and added his own improvements to its instant messaging program. As a college sophomore he hatched a site called Facemash-with the high-minded purpose of determining the hottest kid on campus. Zuckerberg asked users to compare images of two students and then determine the better looking of the two. The winner of each pairing advanced to the next round of his hormonal tournament. To cobble this site together, Zuckerberg needed photos. He purloined those from the servers of the various Harvard houses that stockpiled them. \"One thing is certain;' he wrote on a blog as he put the finishing touches on his creation, \"and it's that I'm a jerk for making this site. Oh well.\"\n\n75. His brief experimentation with rebellion ended with his apologizing to a Harvard disciplinary panel, as well as campus women's groups, and mulling strategies MARK ZUCKERBERG'S WAR ON FREE WILL 105 to redeem his soiled reputation. In the years since, he's shown that defiance really wasn't his natural inclination. His distrust of authority was such that he sought out Don Graham, then the venerable chairman of the Washington Post company, as bis mentor. After he started Facebook, he shadowed various giants of corporate America so that he could study their managerial styles up close. Though he hasn't fu]ly shed his awkward ways, he has sufficiently overcome his introversion to appear at fancy dinner parties, Charlie Rose interviews, and vanity Fair cover shoots. Still, the juvenile fascination with hackers never did die, or rather he carried it forward into his.new, more mature incarnation. When he finally had a corpo- rate campus of his own, he procured a vanity address for it: One Hacker Way. He designed a plaza with h-a-c-k inlaid into the concrete. In the center of his office park, he created an open meeting space called Hacker Square. This is, of course, the venue where his employees join for all-night Hackathons.As he told a group of would-be entrepreneurs, \"We've got this whole ethos that we\n\n76. want to build a hacker culture.\" Plenty of companies have similarly appropriated hacker culture- -hackers are the ur-disrupters-but none have gone as far as Facebook. Of course, that's not without risks. \"Hacking\" is a loaded term, and a potentially alienating one, at least to shareholders who crave sensible rule-abiding leadership. But by the time Zuckerberg began extolling the virtues of hacking, he'd stripped the name of most of its original meaning and distilled it into a managerial philosophy that contains barely a hint of rebelliousness. It might even be the opposite of rebelliousness. Hackers, he told one interviewer, were 'Just this group of computer scientists who were trying to quickly prototype and see what was possible. That's what I try to encourage our engineers to do here:' To hack is to be a good worker, a responsible Facebook citizen--a microcosm of the way in which the company has taken the language of radical individualism and deployed it in the service of conformism. Zuckerberg claimed to have distilled that hacker spirit into a motivational motto: \"Move Fast and Break Things.\" Indeed, Facebook has excelled at that. The truth is, Facebook moved faster than Zuckerberg could ever have imagined. He hadn't really intended his creation. His company was, as we all know, a dorm\n\n77. room lark, a thing he ginned up in a Red Bull-induced fit of sleeplessness.As his creation grew, it needed to justify its new scale to its investors, to its users, to the world. It needed to grow up fast.According to Dustin Moskovitz, who cofounded the company with Zuckerberg at Harvard, \"It was always very important for our brand to get away from the image of frivolity it had, especially in Silicon Valley!' Over the span of its short life, the company has caromed from self-description to self-description. It has called itself a tool, a utility, and a platform. It has talked about openness and connectedness. And in all these attempts at defining itself, it has managed to clarify its intentions. Though Facebook will occasionally talk about the transparency of govern- ments and corporations, what it really wants to advance is the transparency of individuals-or what it has called, at various moments, \"radical transparency\" or \"ultimate transparency.\" The theory holds that the sunshine of sharing our intimate details will disinfect the moral mess of our lives. Even if we don't intend for our secrets to become public knowledge, their exposure will improve society.With the 106 FRANKLIN FOER looming threat that our embarrassing information will be\n\n78. broadcast, we'll behave better. And perhaps the ubiquity of incriminating photos and damning revela- tions will prod us to become more tolerant of one another's sins. Besides, there's virtue in living our lives truthfully. \"The days of you having a different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly,\" Zuckerberg has said. \"Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.\" The point is that Facebook has a strong, paternalistic view on what's best for you, and it's trying to transport you there. \"'To get people to this point where there's more openness-that's a big challenge. But I think we'll do it,\" Zucker- berg has said. He has reason to believe that he will achieve that goal. With its size, Facebook has amassed outsized powers.These powers are so great that Zuckerberg doesn't bother denying that fact. \"In~ lot of ways Facebook is more like a govern- ment than a traditional company. We have this large community of people, and more than other technology companies we're really setting policies!' Without knowing it, Zuckerberg is the heir to a long political tradition. Over the last two hundred years, the West has been unable to shake an abiding fantasy; a dream sequence in which we throw out the bum politicians and replace them\n\n79. with engineers-rule by slide rule. The French were the first to entertain this notion in the bloody, world-churning aftermath of their revolution. A coterie of the country's most influential philosophers (notably, Henri de Saint-Simon and Auguste Comte) were genuinely torn about the course of the country. They hated all the old ancient bastions of parasitic power-the feudal lords, the priests, and the warriors-but they also feared the chaos of the mob. To split the difference, they proposed a form of technocracy-engineers and assorted technicians would rule with beneficent disinterestedness.Engineers would strip the old order ofits power, while governing in the spirit of science. They would impose rationality and order. This dream has captivated intellectuals ever since, especially Americans. The great sociologist Thorstein Veblen was obsessed with installing engineers in power and, in 1921, wrote a book making his case. His vision briefly became a reality. In the aftermath of World War I, American elites were aghast at all the irrational impulses unleashed by that conflict-the xenophobia, the racism, the urge to lynch and riot. What's more, the realities of economic life had grown so complicated, how could politicians possibly manage them? Americans of all persuasions began yearning for the salvific ascendance of the most famous engineer of his time: Herbert Hoover. During the war, Hoover had\n\n80. organized a system that managed to feed starving Europe, despite the seeming impossibility of that assign- ment. In 1920, Franklin Roosevelt-who would, of course, ultimately vanquish him from politics-organized a movement to draft Hoover for the presidency. The Hoover experiment, in the end, hardly realized the happy fantasies about the Engineer King. A very different version of this dream, however, has come to fruition, in the form of the CEOs of the big tech companies. We're not ruled by engineers, not yet, but they have become the dominant force in American life, the highest, most influential tier of our elite. Marc Andreessen coined a famous MARK ZUCKERBERG'$ WAR ON FREE WILL 107 aphorism that holds, \"Software is eating the world.\" There's a bit of obfuscation in that formula-it's really the authors of software who are eating the world. There's another way to describe this historical progression. Automation has 'come in waves. During the Industrial Revolution, machinery replaced manual workers. At first machines required human operators. Over time, machines came to function with hardly any human intervention. For centuries, engineers auto- mated physical labor; our new engineering elite has automated thought. They\n\n81. have perfected technologies that take over intellectual processes, that render the brain redundant. O:r; as Marissa Mayer once argued, \"You have to make words less human and more a piece of the machine.\" Indeed, we have begun to outsource our intellectual work to companies that suggest what we should learn, the topics we should consider, and the items we ought to buy. These companies can justify their incursions into our lives with the very arguments that Saint- Simon and Comte articulated: They are supplying us with efficiency; they are imposing order on human life. Nobody better articulates the modern faith in engineering's power to trans- form society than Zuckerberg. He told a group of software developers, \"You know, I'm an engineer, and I think a key part of the engineering mindset is this hope and this belief that you can take any system that's out there and make it much, much better than it is today. Anything, whether it's hardware, or software, a company, a developer ecosystem, you can take anything and make it much, much better.\" The world will improve, if only Zuckerberg's reason can prevail-- and it will. 1HE PRECISE SOURCE OF FACEBOOK's power is algorithms. That's a concept repeated dutifully in nearly every story about the tech giants, yet it remains fuzzy at best to users of those sites. From the moment of the algorithm's invention, it was possible\n\n82. to see its power, its revolutionary potential. The algorithm was developed in order to automate thinking, to remove difficult decisions from the hands of humans, to settle contentious debates. To understand the essence of the algorithm-and its utopian pretension-it's necessary to travel back to its birthplace, the brain of one of history's unimpeachable geniuses, Gottfried Leibniz. Fifty years younger than Descartes, Leibniz grew up in the same world of religious conflict. His native Germany; Martin Luther's homeland, had become one of history's most horrific abattoirs, the contested territory at the center of the Thirty Years War. Although the battlefield made its own contribution to the corpse count, the aftermath of war was terrible, too. Dysentery, typhus, and plague conquered the German principalities. Famine and demographic collapse followed battle, some four million deaths in total.The worst-clobbered of the German states lost more than half of their population. Leibniz was born as Europe negotiated the Peace ofWestphalia ending the slaughter, so it was inevitable that he trained his prodigious intellectual energies on reconciling Protestants and Catholics, crafting schemes to unify humanity. Prodigious is perhaps an inadequate term to describe Leibniz's mental reserves. He produced schemes at, more or less, the rate he contracted his diaphragm.\n\n83. His archives, which still haven't been fully published, contain some two hundred thousand pages of his writing, filled with spectacular creations. Leibniz invented 108 FRANKLIN FOER calculus-to be sure,he hadn't realized that Newton discovered the subject earlier, but it's his notation that we still use. He produced lasting treatises on metaphysics and theology; he drew up designs for watches and ,vindmills, he advocated universal health care and the development of submarines.As a diplomat in Paris, he pressed Louis XIV to invade Egypt, a bank-shot ploy to divert Germany's mighty neighbor into an overseas adventure that might lessen the prospect of marching its armies east. Denis Diderot, no slouch, moaned, \"When one compares ... one's own small talents with those of a Leibniz, one is tempted to throw away one's books and go die peacefully in the depths of some dark corner.\" Of all Leibniz's schemes, the dearest was a new lexicon he called the universal characteristic-and it, too, sprang from his desire for peace. Throughout history; fanciful thinkers have created languages from scratch in the hope that their con- coctions would smooth communication between the peoples of the world, fos- tering the preconditions for global oneness. Leibniz created his\n\n84. language for that reason, too, but he also had higher hopes: He argued that a new set of symbols and expressions would lead science and philosophy to new truths, to a new age of rea- son, to a deeper appreciation of the universe's elegance and harmony, to the divine. What he imagined was an alphabet of human thought. It was an idea that he first pondered as a young student, the basis for his doctoral dissertation at Altdorf. Over the years, he fleshed out a detailed plan for realizing his fantasy. A group of scholars would create an encyclopedia containing the fundamental, incontestably true concepts of the world, of physics, philosophy, geometry, ev- erything really. He called these core concepts \"primitives,\" and they would in- clude things like the earth, the color red, and God. Each of the primitives would be assigned a numerical value, which allowed them to be combined to create new concepts or to express complex extant ones. And those numerical values would form the basis for a new calculus of thought, what he called the calculus ratiocinator. Leibniz illustrated his scheme with an example. What is a human? A rational animal, of course. That's an insight that we can write like this: rational x animal = man\n\n85. But Leibniz translated this expression into an even more mathematical sentence. \"Animal,\" he suggested, might be represented with the number two; \"rational\" with the number three. Therefore: 2 x3 6 Thought had been turned into math-and this allowed for a new, foolproof method for adjudicating questions of truth. Leibniz asked, for instance, are all men monkeys? Well, he knew the number assigned to monkeys, ten. If ten can't be divided by six, and six can't be divided by ten, then we know:There's no element of monkey in man-and no element of man in monkey. That was the point of his language: Knowledge, all knowledge, could ulti- mately be derived from computation. It would be an effortless process, cogitatio MARK ZUCKERBERG'S WAR ON FREE WILL 109 caeca or blind thought. Humans were no longer even needed to conceive new ideas. A machine could do that, by combining and dividing concepts. In fact, Leibniz· built a prototype of such a machine, a gorgeous, intricate compilation of polished brass and steel, gears and dials. He called it the Stepped Reckoner. Leibniz spent a personal fortune building it. With a turn of the crank in one direction the Stepped Reckoner could multiply, in the other\n\n86. direction divide. Leibniz had designed a user interface so meticulous that Steve Jobs would have bowed down before it. Sadly, whenever he tested the machine for an audience, as he did before the Royal Society in London in 1673, it failed.The resilient Leibniz forgave himself these humiliating demonstrations. The importance of the universal characteristic demanded that he press forward. \"Once this has been done, if ever further controversies should arise, there should be no more reason for disputes between two philosophers than between two calculators:' Intellectual and moral argument could be settled with the disagreeing parties declaring, \"Let's calculate!\" There would be no need for wars, let alone theological controversy, because truth would be placed on the terra fuma of math. Leibniz was a prophet of the digital age, though his pregnant ideas sat in the waiting room for centuries. He proposed a numeric system that used only zeros and ones, the very system of binary on which computing rests. He explained how automation or white-collar jobs would enhance productivity. But his critical insight was mechanical thinking, the automation of reason, the very thing that makes the Internet so miraculous, and the power of the tech companies so potentially menacing. Those procedures that enable mechanical thinking came to have\n\n87. a name. They were dubbed algorithms. The essence of the algorithm is entirely uncomplicated. The textbooks compare them to re<:mes--a series of precise steps that can be followed mindlessly.This is different from equations, which have one correct result. Algorithms merely capture the process for solving a problem and say nothing about where those steps ultimately lead. These recipes are the crucial building blocks of software. Programmers can't simply order a computer to, say, search the Internet. They must give the computer a set of specific instructions for accomplishing that task. These instructions must take the messy human activity oflooking for information and transpose that into an orderly process that can be expressed in code. First do this ... then do that .... The process. of translation, from concept to procedure to code, is inherently reduc- tive. Complex processes must be subdivided into a series of binary choices. There's no equation to suggest a dress to wear, but an algorithm could easily be written for that-it will work its way through a series of either/ or questions (morning or night, winter or summer, sun or rain), with each choice pushing to the next.- Mechanical thinking was exactly what Alan Turing first imagined as he col- lapsed on his run through the meadows of Cambridge in 1935 and daydreamed\n\n88. about a fantastical new calculating machine. For the first decades of computing, the term \"algorithm\" wasn't much mentioned. But as computer science departments began sprouting across campuses in the sixties, the term acquired a new cachet. Its vogue was the product of status anxiety. Programmers, especially in the academy, 110 FRANKLIN FOER were anxious to show that they weren't mere technicians. They began to describe their work as algorithmic, in part because it tied them to one of the greatest of all mathematicians-the Persian polymath MUQ.ammad ibn Musa al- Khwarizmi, or as he was known in Latin, Algoritmi. During the twelfth century, translations of al-Khwarizmi introduced Arabic numerals to the West; his treatises pioneered algebra and trigonometry.By describing the algorithm as the fundamental element of programming, the computer scientists were attaching themselves to a grand history. It was a savvy piece of name dropping: See, we're not arriviste, we're working with abstractions and theories,just like the mathematicians! There was sleight of hand in this self-portrayal. The algorithm may be the essence of computer science-but it's not precisely a scientific concept. An algo-\n\n89. rithm is a system, like plumbing or a military chain of command. It takes know- how, calculation, and creativity to make a system work properly. But some systems, like some armies, are much more reliable than others. A system is a human artifact, not a mathematical truism. The origins of the algorithm are unmistakably human, but human fallibility isn't a quality that we associate with it. When algorithms reject a loan application or set the price for an airline flight, they seem imper- sonal and unbending. The algorithm is supposed to be devoid of bias, intuition, emotion, or forgiveness. They call it a search engine, after all-a nod to pistons, gears, and twentieth-century industry, with the machinery wiped clean of human fingerprints. Silicon Valley's algorithmic enthusiasts were immodest about describing the revolutionary potential of their objects of affection. Algorithms were always interesting and valuable, but advances in computing made them infinitely more powerful. The big change was the cost of computing. It collapsed, and just as the machines themselves sped up and were tied into a, global network. Comput- ers could stockpile massive piles of unsorted data-and algorithms could attack this data to find patterns and connections that would escape human analysts. In the hands of Google and Facebook, these algorithms grew ever more powerful.\n\n90. As they went about their searches, they accumulated more and more data. Their machines assimilated all the lessons of past searches, using these learnings to more precisely deliver the desired results. For the entirety of human existence, the creation of knowledge was a slog of trial and error. Humans would dream up theories of how the world … ••• MARTHA STOUT WHAT Is SANITY? Are \"normal\" people always sane, or could it be said that we experience sanity only at certain times? After witnessing a jarring event, have you ever found yourself in a condition that is not exactly sane: a state of frantic agita- tion or numbness and distraction? These are just some of the questions explored by Martha Stout in her first book, The Myth ef Sanity: Divided Consciousness and the Promise ef Awareness (2002), from which this selection comes. Stout draws on her nearly 30 years of practice as a clinical psychologist to show that the tendency to dissociate--to withdraw from reality-begins as a life- preserving resource that defends against severe trauma in childhood, but later can develop into a way of life defined by emotional detachment and prolonged\n\n91. disengagement with the world. In the most extreme cases, a dissociative disorder can cause individuals to black out for extended periods or to develop multiple personalities in order to cope with life's challenges. By defirring a continuum that extends from the everyday experience of spacing out or getting lost in thought to conditions like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Stout urges her readers to recognize the com- plexity of consciousness itsel£ If all of us dissociate to some degree, then a term like \"sanity\" is simply too crude to capture the real nature of mental health, which requires a proper balance between dissociation and engagement. The patients Stout focuses on in her study have lost this precious balance, but with her help, they come to see the meaning of their lives as something they can recover. In jargon-free prose, Stout tells stories of her patients' struggles for sanity, revealing in each case how buried or missing ,memories disrupt their awareness of the present. For more than 25 years Stout served on the clinical faculty of the Harvard Medical School through the McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In addition, she has taught on the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research and the psychology faculty of Wellesley College. Since completing The Myth ef\n\n92. Sanity, she has published two other best selling books The Sociopath Next Door (2005) and The Paranoia Switch (2007). \"When I Woke Up Tuesday Morning, It Was Friday,\" from THE MYTH OF SANITY by Martha Stout, copyright © 2001 by Martha Stout.

The person who suffers from a severe trauma disorder must decide between surviving in a barely sublethal mis- ery of numbness and frustration, and taking a chance that may well bring her a better life, but that feels like stupidly issuing an open invitation to the unspeak- able horror that waits to consume her alive.

The amygdala receives sensory information from the five senses, via the thal- amus, attaches emotional significance to the input, and then passes along this emotional \"evaluation\" to the hippocarnpus. In accordance with die amygdala's \"evaluation\" of importance, the hippocampus is activated to a greater or lesser degree, and functions to organize the new input, and to integrate it with already existing information about similar sensory events. Under a normal range of con- ditions, this system works efficiently to consolidate memories according to their emotional priority. However, at the extreme upper end of hormonal stimulation, as in traumatic situations, a breakdown occurs.
