        "text": "The aim of this paper is to show the cultural phenomena created by the construction of two buildings in a socialist, industrial city that have influenced its urban transformation. In the case of the second largest Montenegrin city, Nikšić, two buildings marked the cultural and economic development, the Union house built in 1962 by architect Đorđije Minjević (1924-2013) and the Home of revolution unfinished building which construction began in 1977, designed by architect Marko Mušič (1946). The Union house was among the first in Montenegro built in an international style and among the first in ex-Yugoslavia with vertical brise-solei. The building contains several functions: a large cinema hall with 800 seats as well the library, classrooms and offices for the Worker’s University. For industrial city that was rapidly developing, the existence of the Union house as a place where film projections, concerts, theatre performances, and education took place was of great importance. In the context of architecture, this building brought new trends and contents that soon became focus of everyday urban life. In the former Yugoslavia during the seventies, it was common to build monuments and memorial buildings dedicated to victims of the liberation struggles in the Second World War. The biggest memorial buildings with more the 22,000 square meters of different functions and contents, called the Home of Revolution is located in the city of Nikšić. The building should present the economic strength of the city at that time but also the unity of all Yugoslav nations, since a large number of donation from all over the country were used for the construction. When Yugoslavia broke up in 1991, there was a suspension of construction of all federal projects including Home of Revolution. Today the building is completely abandoned.\n\nAfter the first edition of the IFAU 2017 – International Forum on Architecture and Urbanism organised in Tirana, and the second edition of the IFAU 2018 organised in Pescara, Italy, the Polytechnic University of Tirana – Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism (FAU) is organising the third edition: IFAU 2019 – International Forum on Architecture and Urbanism in Tirana, Albania on November 21 - 23, 2019, with the theme “Modernization and Globalization.” IFAU 2019 – 3rd International Forum on Architecture and Urbanism aims to bring together leading academic scientists, researchers, and research scholars to exchange and share their experiences and research results about all aspects of Architecture, Urbanism, Cultural Heritage within Modernisation and Globalisation trends of the XXI century. It also provides the premier interdisciplinary Forum for researchers, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, and concerns, practical challenges encountered, and the solutions adopted for the Modernisation and Globalisation in the Cities in Transition. The third edition expands the horizon by introducing a series of overlapping visions spanning the recently institutionalised Adriatic - Ionian Euroregion, now extended to the Balkan and South-East European regions. The Forum will concentrate on Architecture, Urbanism, Cultural Heritage located in contexts and territories that reveal their tendencies to Modernisation and Globalisation. Modernisation and Globalization Architecture, Urbanism and Heritage provide a multi-faceted analysis that is based on the understandings of architects and urban planners working in both the developed and developing countries traditions. Globalisation is a broad concept concerning the diversity of regions, cultures, and actors and the diversity of analytical approaches that can be employed to study it. During the past decade, notions of globalisation have displaced familiar discourses of modernisation. We consider Modernisation and Globalization as a process that naturally links the past, the present and the future - as a bridge between the past and the future. Current events such as the cultural heritage protection crisis illustrate that the discussion should not be confined to specific geographic regions or narrowly defined analysis methods but in a broader and deeper search spectrum. The research presented in this Forum embraces the need to cover various aspects and dimensions of Modernisation and Globalisation in Architecture, Urbanism and Cultural Heritage, to see both its local and its global manifestations. From our perspective, globalisation studies imply research that is not just limited to the most popular spheres of globalisation but also includes the study of global problems such as sustainable development, cultural heritage, etc. In summary, the distinctive character of Modernisation and Globalisation is that it delivers an extensive international and multicultural thematic issue associated with Architecture, Urbanism and Cultural Heritage, including their impact on particular cultural-geographic regions. The Modernisation and Globalisation of territories and cities in transition is the object of this Forum. Through contributions from colleagues and scholars from different international universities, the intention is to explore different interpretations of contexts, to study processes of Modernisation and Globalisation in territories and cities in transition, to define strategies for urban transformation and to confront issues raised by environmental and architectural sustainability, all framed by an up-to-date and contemporary vision of the entire Adriatic-Ionian and Balkan region. Culture and the strength of ideas are viewed as the essential tools for building bridges between knowledge and rediscovering, in a new relationship between Architecture, Urbanism and Cultural Heritage, the key to interpreting the processes transforming territories and cities. The conference program will include the topic of interest that include, but are not limited to: 1. Global/local modernisations; 2. XXth century modernism and the question of cultural heritage; 3. Phenomena of regeneration, revitalisation, recycling, reuse; 4. Modernisation/globalisation of urban planning/design and landscapes; 5. Modern housing; 6. Modern designing and daily life/universal design; 7. The utilisation of future technologies; 8. Sustainability in the era of modernisation/globalisation."
