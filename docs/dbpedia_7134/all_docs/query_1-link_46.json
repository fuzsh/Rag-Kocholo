        "text": "First Aid for the Dreaded Synopsis\n\n|\n\nLast fall a reader suggested I blog about something she struggles with – the dreaded summary / synopsis that publishers and agents often ask for. How do you go about compressing 40,000-80,000 words into 500-1000? I could tell you I just read through a manuscript and try to come up with a few sentences that…\n\nRead More →\n\nAnnouncing The Rock and the Butterfly\n\n|\n\nAnne Innis Dagg, the giraffe scientist I had the great privilege to get to know and introduce to readers through The Girl Who Loved Giraffes, died last month at the age of 91. She was to travel with her daughter to South Africa this summer. Now her daughter will instead take Anne’s ashes to mix with…\n\nRead More →\n\nPoetry News & Quotes\n\n|\n\nApril is National Poetry Month and I have two exciting (at least to me!) bits of news related my poetry to pass along. This month a mentorship I’ve had the good luck to be involved in since the fall is wrapping up. During the program funded by the Writers Union of Canada, the poet Barbara…\n\nRead More →\n\nWhen A Pet Dies\n\n|\n\nSoon after learning my dog was seriously ill and unlikely to recover, I had a dream. Georgia and I were walking. She was on a leash that kept getting longer as the weave of its nylon fabric unravelled, until it was hanging between us by only a thread. I woke up before the last remaining…\n\nRead More →\n\nHappy Birthday to the World’s First Giraffologist!\n\n|\n\nOn the eve of Anne Innis Dagg’s 90th birthday, I challenged myself to sum up her life in 90 words. 1930s A Canadian girl sees her first giraffe and falls in love. 1940s She begins to dream of studying giraffes in Africa. 1950s She does it. 1960s She writes a book and gives university lectures…\n\nRead More →\n\nSix Tips for Staying the Course After Rejection\n\n|\n\nYou slogged through several drafts of your project, probably many drafts. You worked with feedback from trusted colleagues in exchange for feedback on their work, or from a hired editor, to help you get your project to a publishable state. Not only publishable; this book is going to be great! you told yourself. You experienced highs and lows…\n\nRead More →\n\nSummer is here!\n\nWhatever your plans for the summer season now upon us, I wish you days — or at least moments — filled with all you find beautiful in your life. And lots of time for reading some great books too!\n\nRead More →\n\nMaking Poems and Making Photos: Observations at Sage Hill\n\n|\n\nBoth are ways of being in the world that make you stop and notice or notice and stop. First time you approach a subject you don’t know where it will take you. Sometimes you need to get closer, sometimes to step back. What you create depends on your angle in relation…\n\nRead More →\n\nBooks and Violins and Music in General\n\nDon’t you love this display at Vancouver Kids Books? Clever thinking on the part of its designer. Good news for The Man with the Violin continues to roll in. It has already being reprinted. Starred reviews and others it’s attracted are lovely. It’s fabulous that the book is being made available at Joshua Bell’s North…\n\nRead More →\n\nAcross this Country\n\nSeptember in Nova Scotia. October in British Columbia. November in Alberta. What wonderful opportunities to meet readers across this wonderful country of ours. I’m often in Nova Scotia in the early fall. Knowing this, organizers of Word on the Street in Halifax invited me to take part. My audience at the CBC tent included (much…\n\nRead More →\n\nRED Hair & RED Trimmed Pajamas in a RED Room IS BEST!\n\n|\n\nRed Is Best is now older than I was when it was first published. It has appeared in hard cover, soft, and in board book formats, as an Annikin, a Gage big book, and as an e-book. And it’s been translated in many languages so kids in other countries can enjoy reading it too. Wow.…\n\nRead More →\n\nPlans for Another Kathy Stinson Board Book\n\nI was delighted when Annick Press decided to make Red is Best available as a board book, and even moreso when I discovered this photo on flickr. This year Annick decided to make Big or Little? available as a board book, too. I’ve changed some of its words so the book’s very young readers will…\n\nRead More →\n\nPhoto of the Month #12\n\nI sometimes get teased because I like taking pictures of my food. Like this spinach salad full of strawberries, blueberries, and toasted almonds. What makes this salad special is that it was made by an old friend who insisted on bringing it to my house when we got together this spring for a long overdue…\n\nRead More →\n\nMore Books for Liberian Children\n\nI knew the first time Gii-Hne Russell read his story “A Time to Bathe” during one of the workshops I conducted in Liberia that it would one day become a book Liberian children would love to learn to read for themselves. (That’s the point of the Reading Liberia program I became involved with in 2008.…\n\nRead More →\n\nWhat 1 Movie & 2 Short Stories Taught Me About Writing\n\nAfter I saw the Australian movie Jindabyne recently, I decided to read the Raymond Carver short story on which the movie is based. It was fascinating to see how Beatrix Christian adapted the short, spare text of “So Much Water So Close to Home” to create a compelling 2-hour movie. So often when we see…\n\nRead More →\n\nWhose Point of View?\n\nLike many writers, I’m drawn to stories told from multiple points of view. I think this is because, as writers, we’re fascinated with the different ways people perceive and experience the world, and how that influences their behaviour. We may also be keen to see events from all sides. But which of many possible viewpoints are needed to…\n\nRead More →\n\nIntroducing: The Man With the Violin\n\n|\n\nIt started with a forwarded email late in 2011, containing a link. By February 2012, I had sent to Annick Press a manuscript for a picture book version of the story that had so captivated me . By August, Dušan Petricic was on board to illustrate a much crisper version of the story than what I’d originally…\n\nRead More →\n\nStuff bloggers have said about Me\n\n|\n\n“Kathy Blogged” has disappeared from the Author menu on my website. Those words never quite captured what they were trying to say: Here are some blogs where Kathy Stinson is mentioned. But rather than just see some of the neat things bloggers said totally disappear, I decided to put a few of them into a…\n\nRead More →\n\nPhoto of the Month #11\n\nI wasn’t crazy about writing when I was a kid, but I did like it when the teacher gave us a picture as a starting point, especially if the picture inspired questions. Who? What? Where? And the best one: Why? What would I have written if she’d given us this photo (which she couldn’t have…\n\nRead More →\n\nThank You, Terry Fallis!\n\n|\n\nWhile waiting for editorial feedback on What Happened to Ivy last winter, I started work on some short stories, thinking they might be less overwhelming – more easily broken into smaller chunks of work – than another novel would be, even if I was aiming to have enough stories, eventually, for a collection. Of course…\n\nRead More →\n\nRemembrance Day\n\n|\n\nI’ll be in Ottawa on Remembrance Day presenting Highway of Heroes at the Canadian War Museum, after a brief appearance on “A” Morning Ottawa. Meanwhile, in Springhill, Nova Scotia, a student will be reading Highway of Heroes to a school assembly. Around the gymnasium will be “Bridge Ceremony” banners made by the students. O Canada…\n\nRead More →\n\nThe Up Side of Email\n\n|\n\nSometimes I lament the time it takes to keep up with emails, as many people do these days. But I received a few recently that made me very glad for this way of connecting with people I might otherwise not hear from at all. Like this one: Hi Kathy!! I just bought and read your…\n\nRead More →\n\nAn Ancient Child by Lynn Davies\n\n|\n\nPosted here with the poet’s permission: An Ancient Child The doctor’s waiting room, the quiet flip of magazine pages. My daughter’s right lung still crackling, and I wish for recovery and punctual doctors. Looking at the floral patterns of china I’ll never buy, when suddenly my daughter laughs, holds up for me to see spread…\n\nRead More →\n\nTeacher's Guide for Highway of Heroes\n\nTeachers making plans for Remembrance Day lessons will be interested in knowing that Fitzhenry & Whiteside has produced an online Teacher’s Guide for Highway of Heroes – both the fiction and non-fiction components of the book.\n\nRead More →\n\nThe Launch of Highway of Heroes\n\nOn Sunday, October 17, the Royal Canadian Legion in Fredericton held a memorial service for soldiers who have died in Afghanistan. It was held outdoors around the monument to fallen soldiers that was unveiled a year ago. It was a moving ceremony with a laying of wreaths by various dignitaries and members of the fallen…\n\nRead More →\n\nHighway of Heroes – The First Review is In\n\nAppropriate, I think, that the first review for Highway of Heroes appears in Fredericton’s “Daily Gleaner” on the day I’m preparing to go there to launch the book. If you’re in the Fredericton area, I hope I’ll see you – at the bookstore in Oromocto on Friday, Westminster Books in Fredericton on Saturday, or at…\n\nRead More →\n\nWriters by the Sea\n\n|\n\nThey came and wrote – in the fish house, the old barn, the farmhouse, and on the beach. They wrote about kids who are lonely, who don’t fit in, kids curious, funny, or angry. They wrote all morning, and sometimes again in the afternoon or evening. When they weren’t writing, they were talking about writing,…\n\nRead More →\n\nMeeting a Reader and Writer\n\n|\n\nJoanna Perkin first wrote me in 2003 to tell me she’d enjoyed reading the first two Marie-Claire books. I wrote her back, she wrote me back, and so on. We kept up a correspondence – about books we’d read and about writing stories, because like me Joanna is both a reader and a writer –…\n\nRead More →\n\nMy Latest Book – Highway of Heroes\n\n|\n\nEach time a fallen soldier returns to Canada, thousands of ordinary Canadians from all walks of life line the bridges over the Highway of Heroes to pay their respects to the soldier and the soldier’s family. Highway of Heroes is a photographic picture book that tells the fictional story of one boy’s journey down the Highway…\n\nRead More →\n\nWhat I Read on My Summer Vacation\n\nThe Present Tense of Prinny Murphy by Jill MacLean A great companion book to The Nine Lives of Travis Keating. And I hear there’s to be a third book about this community of kids living in a Newfoundland outport. Can’t wait. The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie by Alan Bradley I don’t read…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Potent Argument for Reading Aloud\n\n|\n\nDo you read out loud to your kids? Do you read out loud to your friends? Here’s a very short excerpt of a book I’m reading – Frankie & Stankie by Barbara Trapido. Not one of the books quite throws at Dinah, as Pride and Prejudice does, how dialogue can lift and dance on points, how sentences…\n\nRead More →\n\nSummer Reading Excerpt #6\n\n|\n\nIn The Great Bike Race, the second in a 3-book series of summer adventures… … “Hey, Matt!” Lennox laid some rubber in front of the ice cream store. “Look at this new baseball I just got.” He thrust it into Matt’s hand. “Wanna go try it out?” Matt crammed the last of his cone into…\n\nRead More →\n\nSummer Reading Excerpt #5\n\nFish House Secrets is a young adult novel about two teens from very different backgrounds whose lives intersect for a few days on the south shore of Nova Scotia. This excerpt comes before the two meet. Jill Birds flap and shriek. A maze. Which way? A mother holds a little girl’s hand, leads her away from…\n\nRead More →\n\nWow, look how long my story is!\n\n|\n\nRegular visitors to my blog may find this advice from me familiar, but I hope they’ll forgive me recycling it so I can participate in a blogfest. (I am supposed to be on holiday this week, after all!) Watch for places in your manuscript where “less is more” – where fewer words would create a…\n\nRead More →\n\nIt’s “Take Your Webmaster to Lunch” Day\n\n|\n\nI wonder if my sister cooked this one up as a way of getting me to take her to lunch. She’s clever enough to do something like that. Since 1999, when she designed my first website, Janet has been responsible for establishing and maintaining my presence on the World Wide Web. (I wonder how many…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Proud Month\n\n|\n\nThis has been quite a month for me and my family. My son graduated in the top 10 percent of his class, having completed his MBA while working full time. My daughter danced up a storm at a recent performance put on by the school where she’s been having a great time mastering the art…\n\nRead More →\n\nSummer Reading Excerpt #3\n\n|\n\nThis week’s summer reading excerpt is taken from One Year Commencing. In Chapter 4, Al is trying to figure a way out of doing what a court order has said she has to do – stay at her dad’s for a year, and after that decide whether to stay with him or go back out…\n\nRead More →\n\nHow's the Novel Going?\n\n|\n\nLet’s just ignore the fact that I’ve been working on it since 2004 – granted with a few other projects sprinkled in there – and say that today I think draft #34 is going well! This winter I undertook a complete restructuring and delved deeper into what makes its main characters tick. I’ve eliminated an…\n\nRead More →\n\nSummer Reading Excerpt #2\n\n|\n\nThe second in my “summer reading” series is an excerpt from “Between Mars and Venus”, one of the short stories for young adults in 101 Ways to Dance. One evening shortly before summer holidays, Susan takes Melina, the new girl from school, to the beach near where they live. … The water is like glass. There…\n\nRead More →\n\nMay is Vision Health Month\n\nBecause I’m so grateful for my own vision health, and because I love to read aloud (and do it well), I’ve been working as a volunteer reader and technician at the CNIB Recording Studio for the past 6 years. In that time I’ve narrated parts of various magazines and text books and 19 entire books.…\n\nRead More →\n\nSummer Reading Excerpt #1\n\n|\n\nIn the coming weeks, my blog will feature periodic postings of “summery” excerpts from some of my books – starting today with a short snippet from – hot off the press! – Marie-Claire. All four of the original Marie-Claire stories appear in this handsome treasury edition. “Lucille, do you mind if we find somewhere to…\n\nRead More →\n\nThe Osborne Collection\n\n|\n\nLast week I said I’d say more on the subject of scrapbooks. I started keeping one in 1982 after my first book, Red is Best, was published. I put my rejection letters in it, the letter Annick sent saying they’d like to meet with me, the earliest Robin Baird Lewis sketches I saw that convinced…\n\nRead More →\n\nHappy B-Earth Day to me!\n\n|\n\nCan’t believe I let this opportunity to mention a great book about one of Canada’s first environmentalists go by yesterday! I’m referring of course to Love Every Leaf: the life of landscape architect Cornelia Hahn Oberlander. I’ll blame it on being too focused on my birthday. 🙂 I’m grateful to Linda Granfield for sending me…\n\nRead More →\n\nTPL’s First and Best!\n\n|\n\nHurray! Toronto Public Library has chosen A Pocket Can Have A Treasure In It for their 2008 “First and Best” list.

I’m pretty excited because she hasn’t been here since the day after we moved in, when she did a great job helping me get our new kitchen organized. We instituted what we call our “sister visits” a number of years ago, when we discovered that much as we enjoy visiting in…\n\nRead More →\n\nSettling In\n\n|\n\nWe moved house a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve had lots of people ask how we’re “settling in” and how we’re enjoying the new place. I’m really enjoying getting set up here, but I’m also very much looking forward to just “being” here – writing, reading, doing puzzles, and of course taking Keisha for…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Word on the Street Surprise\n\nIt’s always nice when a fan of one’s books comes up to you at the end of a reading, and yesterday at Word on the Street was especially so. At the end of a long afternoon of reading and signing, on a gorgeous fall afternoon, a woman sat down beside me in the Little Reader’s…\n\nRead More →\n\nCome See Me at \"Word on the Street\"\n\nYes, I’m back from summer holidays, have now moved house, and on Sunday I’ll be reading at Word on the Street in Toronto. Come find me there and you might even meet some of the inspiration for some of my books.\n\nRead More →\n\nSummer Reading\n\n|\n\nWell, it’s off to a great start! This morning I had a million reasons to get up and get going on my day, but I had to stay in bed to finish reading Dooley Takes the Fall by Norah McClintock first. You don’t often see “literary” and “page-turner” together in a review, but both words apply to…\n\nRead More →\n\nSix Word Memoir\n\n|\n\nMy sister Janet, tagged me with the following challenge: Write a six-word memoir. Post it to your blog including a visual illustration if you would like. Link to the person who tagged you in your post and to this original post if possible so we can track it as it travels across the blogosphere. Tag…\n\nRead More →\n\nMore Honours for Cornelia\n\n|\n\nLast week I had the privilege of attending the graduation ceremony at Dalhousie University where Cornelia Oberlander was receiving yet another honorary degree. Giving the convocation address, she spoke the importance of taking risks. To paraphrase: “To make the world a better place, we cannot keep doing things the same old way they have always…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Treasure for My Pocket\n\n|\n\nTwo big surprises at the Literacy Conference in Burlington last weekend. The onsite bookseller, Different Drummer, had on hand a big stack of Love Every Leaf: The Life of Cornelia Hahn Oberlander – and it wasn’t scheduled for release till several days later! (It looks gorgeous, and after I spoke about it briefly during my…\n\nRead More →\n\nI've Got Mail\n\nOnce in a while something lands in your inbox that just makes your day. Such was the case for me recently, when a literacy consultant in Simcoe County wrote to tell me about the impact of my book King of the Castle on her and some people she knows. “I am writing a biography about…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Day Can Have A Surprise In It\n\nMy granddaughter was tickled to see that the book she got from me and her grampa for her 6th birthday – A Pocket Can Have A Treasure In It – had her name in the thanks and dedication.

My first brand new picture book in sixteen years!

Five days in August in a spectacular Nova Scotia setting – indulging in private writing time, walking the beach, getting feedback on your work from me, my partner Peter Carver (children’s book editor for Red Deer Press and teacher of writing for George Brown College), and a small group of fellow…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Not-Typical Day in the Life – December 5\n\n|\n\n6:00 Worked on my novel. Wrote a scene that makes better use of material barely touched on in a previous draft. 7:15 Ate breakfast – yogurt with bananas and almonds and cereal – and did a crossword puzzle. 7:45 Took Keisha for a walk up the line. 8:45 Had a shower and answered emails. 9:30…\n\nRead More →"
