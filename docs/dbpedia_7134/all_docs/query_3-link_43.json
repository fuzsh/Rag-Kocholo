Scroll all the way down.**\n\nWe’re down to the last three selections of Picture Book Month.\n\nDay 28 – I Dare You Not to Yawn by Helen Boudreau and Illustrated by Serge Bloch.\n\nA yawn can land you in your pj’s and under the covers before you can blink and say “Baa baa black sheep.” So clamp your mouth shut and look away from your sleepy dog, stay away from your cuddly blanket, and whatever you do, don’t think of baby orangutans stretching their long arms out for a snuggly hug. Otherwise, you might find your mouth opening wide and letting out a great big yawny yaaaaaawn — hey, you were supposed hold it in! A hilarious read-aloud that is so much fun, kids will beg for it again and again, whatever the consequences.\n\nJust try to resist this comical — and infectious — cautionary fable that will have even bedtime-avoiders gladly snuggling up for a nightly challenge.\n\nSo while we still wait our turn for this book from the library, I found a read aloud from Lansdowne Public Library.\n\nOne more video. I really enjoyed watching this video posted by SickKidsInteractive for their Story Time programming. Take a watch…\n\nAbout the Author, Helene Boudreau –\n\nI grew up in a really large family on a small island surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean where we had sleepovers in lobster boats, hiked to secret beaches, and got chased by wild cows through forest paths. I started writing stories at a really young age, and many of my books are inspired by the fun times I had growing up with my seven siblings and many cousins and friends.I Dare You Not to Yawn was inspired by my cheeky daughter, who will do anything for a laugh. When she was about four years old she would open her mouth in a very theatrical fake-yawn at the dinner table then smile and see if her yawn would catch on. Soon, we’d all be yawning, and laughing, and vowing we would never fall for her trick again. But of course,we always did.\n\nThree Things You Might Not Know About Me:\n\n1. I once slept in a tent for a whole summer.\n\n2. I hate cotton balls and the squeaky sound they make. They are seriously creepy to me!\n\n3. I know how to spell super-long words like supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. See?\n\nSource – http://www.candlewick.com/authill.asp?b=Author&m=bio&id=9284&pix=y\n\nHelene’s website can be found here, http://www.heleneboudreau.com/#!i-dare-you-not-to-yawn/cusy\n\nAbout the Illustrator –\n\nSerge Bloch’s first children’s book, I Can’t Wait by Davide Cali, won the prix IBBY and has sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide. His other credits include The Enemy, also written by Davide Cali, and several books he has written himself: Butterflies in My Stomach, You Are What You Eat, and Reach for the Stars. He divides his time between New York and Paris.\n\nSource – http://www.candlewick.com/cat.asp?browse=Title&mode=book&isbn=0763650706&pix=n\n\nFor more information on Serge and his other illustrations you can check out his blog, http://www.sergebloch.net/blog/ or his website, http://www.sergebloch.net/\n\nUpdate (12/04/2015)\n\nWhat a fun little book! We have finally had an opportunity to hold the book in our hands, and have a little story time with it. We enjoyed going through the book, and playing along with the stretching, and the yawning, and the eye squinting actions.\n\nDefinitely enjoyed this book, and had a few chuckles as we read it.\n\nIf you have had the opportunity to read it, hope you enjoyed it too.\n\nUPDATED Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress by Christine Baldacchino and Isabelle Malenfant – Read Share Celebrate day 24\n\nGood Morning from Kaelyn’s Book Club. We have added a Painting Project to this blog post, and pictures of our project as part of our #PictureBookMonthBloggers post. Please enjoy and if you are looking for a crafting idea, we hope you will try our Morris inspired Painting Project.\n\n**Original Post**Day 24 – Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress by Christina Baldacchino, and Illustrated by Isabelle Malenfant\n\navailable in English and French.\n\nMorris is a little boy who loves using his imagination. He dreams about having space adventures, paints beautiful pictures and sings the loudest during circle time. But most of all, Morris loves his classroom’s dress-up center — he loves wearing the tangerine dress.\n\nBut the children in Morris’s class don’t understand. Dresses, they say, are for girls. And Morris certainly isn’t welcome in the spaceship some of his classmates are building. Astronauts, they say, don’t wear dresses.\n\nOne day when Morris feels all alone, and sick from the taunts of his classmates, his mother lets him stay home from school. Morris reads about elephants, and puts together a puzzle, and dreams of a fantastic space adventure with his cat, Moo.\n\nInspired by his dream, Morris paints the incredible scene he saw, and brings it with him to school. He builds his own spaceship, hangs his painting on the front of it and takes two of his classmates on an outer space adventure.\n\nWith warm, dreamy illustrations Isabelle Malenfant perfectly captures Morris’s vulnerability and the vibrancy of his imagination. This is a sweetly told story about the courage and creativity it takes to be different.\n\nWinner of the CBC Bookie Award for Best Picture Book 2015\n\nShort-listed for the Blue Spruce Award 2015\n\nSelected for the Canadian Children’s Book Centre Best Books for Kids and Teens 2014\n\nSelected for the Quill & Quire Books of the Year for Young People 2014\n\nSelected for the Kirkus Reviews Best Books of the Year 2014\n\nSelected for the Kirkus Best Picture Books Celebrating Diversity 2014\n\nSelected for the Today’s Parent Top Picture Books of the Year 2014\n\nSelected for the Huffington Post Best Picture Books of the Year: Most Touching/Heartwarming 2014\n\nSelected for the Stonewall Honor Books in Children’s and Young Adult Literature 2015\n\nSelected for the American Library Association Rainbow List 2015\n\nSelected for the Cooperative Children’s Book Center Choices 2015\n\nShort-listed for the TD Canadian Children’s Literature Award 2015\n\nShort-listed for the Marilyn Baillie Picture Book Award 2015\n\n32 Pages, ISBN 9781554983476, from grade JK to grade 2\n\nSource – http://houseofanansi.com/products/morris-micklewhite-and-the-tangerine-dress\n\nSo when I asked Kaelyn today where we should have our afternoon story time she wanted to sit by her small Christmas Tree. So here we are, reading Morris Micklewhite by the Christmas Tree.\n\nI have already added this book to the list of books that “I LOVE!”\n\nThere are so many lessons from this book we can teach and share from reading it.\n\nFriendship\n\nCreativity\n\nUnderstanding\n\nAcceptance\n\nIndivuality\n\n….just to name a few.\n\nThis video of Christine Baldacchino was posted by CBC Books earlier this month leading up to the TD Canadian Children’s Literature Award, [ http://www.cbc.ca/books/2015/11/the-boy-who-inspired-morris-micklewhite-and-the-tangerine-dress.html ]\n\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/video/swf/UberPlayer.swf?state=sharevideo&clipId=2678580423&width=480&height=322\n\nThis book also hit close to home, before I watched that video. But even more so now. Our family knows a little boy that could be Morris. I will never forget the day I saw him running across his Grandparents yard in a Gold Sequin Dress. Luckily he is a very well adjusted, Supported, Strong, and Happy 6 year old.\n\nWe really hope that if you haven’t had an opportunity to pick up this book (or borrow it from your local library), that you do. It’s so important\n\nAs we wrap this post up for today, anyone who has taken a look at my other posts knows that I love Read Aloud videos (so that even more of you can share in the book with us) So I scoured YouTube and have come up with a video to share. This was “Created as a digital story project for LIS 409: Storytelling at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.” by Thaddeus Andracki\n\n**UPDATE** Now onto a Post Story time Craft.\n\nWe decided to share a painting project….Morris LOVES to paint!! It’s not an original idea, but every finished product is as original and unique as the artist.\n\nSupplies Needed:\n\nCanvas (we found canvas panels work the best for us, because little hands sometimes push hard on the stretched canvas)\n\nPainters Tape (write any work/design you want. We obviousl have chosen LOVE)\n\nPaint (we used Finger paints, because it was a fun sensory experience for the little hands)\n\nThere isn’t really any hard an fast instructions. Decide what word or design you want to write on your canvas with your painters tape, and then paint. We did wait about 24 hours before removing the tape (I just wanted to make sure it was fully dried. Our canvas was pretty saturated with paint! It was wonderful!!!!)\n\nEnjoy painting! This would be a great project any time of the year. Or as a project to do with a group of friends.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nChristine Baldacchino is a graphic artist and web designer with a background in early childhood education. She lives with her husband in Toronto. She likes cats and the colour orange.

I have requested it through an inter-library loan process, and just waiting. … … … I promise to update, as soon as we get our little hands on the book, and can READ it!!\n\nHere’s an extended blog post from JacketFlap talking about the book (and their post includes pictures), http://www.jacketflap.com/megablog/?postid=1396677\n\n**Please if you have read this book, feel free to leave some comments for us.**\n\nIn this clever picture book, six different shapes attend Shapeston Elementary School along with the children: Triangle, Square, Circle, Rectangle, Rhombus (or “Diamond” to her friends) and Oval. As the story begins, the big news at school is the upcoming play. Everyone is looking forward to auditioning, especially the shapes. One by one they are introduced, with descriptions of their unique personalities and interests, along with the roles they’ve played before (Triangle as a tortilla chip, Oval as a skating rink, Diamond as a kite and the like). Happily, after all the wonderful auditions, the drama teacher decides everyone gets to be in the play!\n\nThis fresh and playful idea for a concept book, written and illustrated by Tania Howells, makes shapes and early geometry fun. Each shape gets its own two-page spread. On the left is a large picture of the shape, with a simple and expressive face and limbs set in a jaunty pose, along with the explanatory text. On the right are boxes containing smaller illustrations of objects made out of the shape. The art, simply drawn in bright, bold colors, is charming and engaging. These spreads could easily work on their own for a lesson on shapes, and the book could be used to spark a variety of “I spy” activities with young children, in the classroom, in the playground or anywhere out in the world. Also, the ending spread showing the play’s performance offers a terrific opportunity to search for the different shapes on the stage.\n\nSource – http://www.kidscanpress.com/products/starring-shapes\n\nHere’s how the author/illustrator talks about this book on her blog (dated May 2015),\n\nhttp://tania.blogs.com/tania/2015/05/starring-shapes.html\n\nAbout Tania Howells –\n\nYou must check out her Biography on her blog. LOVE IT!!! http://www.taniahowells.com/tania4.html\n\nTania lives in Toronto with her husband and son, Finch. She graduated from the Ontario College of Art and Design in 1997 and has been a freelance illustrator for 15 years. Tania has done work for clients such as Today’s Parent magazine, Chirp, Holt Renfrew, The National Post and many others. She is currently a stay-at-home mum, and after bedtime, she works on her drawings. In another life, Tania might like to be a fabric designer, a librarian or even a small-town cafe owner. She sometimes has trouble saying things out loud, just like Willow. She likes coffee and tea, walks, reading books, daydreaming and baking things.

Starring Shapes! is a very colourful book, however I seem to have a bit of a Love – Hate relationship with it.\n\nWhat I LOVE about this book is the colour. The illustrations are fun, and bright, and we loved them.\n\nWhat has me on the hate side is the text. We found it pretty wordy. And although my little book queen reads a lot of book above her age, she just couldn’t get into this one. (we tried several times).\n\nProbably best for the older kids, but the pictures are fun, and you can probably make up your own fabulous stories with these pictures if your little ones are interested in the actual text.\n\nA Poppy is to Remember by Heather Patterson, Illustrated by Ron Lightburn – Day 11 Read Share Celebrate\n\nWelcome to Day 11 of READ SHARE CELEBRATE.\n\nToday as we are celebrating Remembrance Day in Canada, we have selected….\n\nA Poppy is to Remember [ Un Coquelicot Pour Se Souvenir ] by Heather Patterson and Illustrated by Ron Lightburn\n\nHow did the bright red poppy that we all wear in November become Canada’s symbol of honouring those who fought for our freedom on Remembrance Day?\n\nMoving text coupled with stunning illustrations by Governor General’s Award-winning artist Ron Lightburn explain the symbolism behind the poppy.\n\nA bonus for teachers is the five-page spread all about the poem, “In Flanders Fields,” Canada’s wartime and peacekeeping endeavours, and the adoption of the poppy as our Remembrance Day emblem.\n\nScholastic Canada Ltd | ISBN 9780545999816 Paperback\n\n32 Pages | 8.04″ x 10″ | Ages 6 to 8\n\nScholastic Canada Ltd | ISBN 9780439967860 Hardcover\n\n32 Pages | 8.34″ x 10.3″ | Ages 6 to 8\n\nSource – http://www.scholastic.ca/books/view/a-poppy-is-to-remember\n\nI absolutely think this is a Fabulous books for ALL ages. We will be taking this out for a special Family Read Aloud each Remembrance Day going forward.\n\nBefore we received our copy of the book, we read it at one of our many visits to our Local Library. They had some great Remembrance Day Colouring Sheets. So while I read the book to my daughter, she worked very diligently in colouring.\n\nNow for those of you who have not yet had the opportunity to read this book, I found this video online while doing some book research. It was posted last year from the Grade 4-5 class of Williamstown Public School, South Glengarry, Ont. And I think it’s fabulous. The students read the book aloud (English and French translations) and it’s so great to hear.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/-CQzmv5u_4c“>http://\n\nThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:\n\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\n\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning\n\nWe will remember them.\n\nSource – For The Fallen by Robert Laurence Binyon [ http://www.greatwar.co.uk/poems/laurence-binyon-for-the-fallen.htm ]\n\nVery last thing, I promise.

Dreamtime is another book that we have yet to read. I have placed a hold on the book from the library, and the last I checked it was in transit (hopefully to me).\n\n** I will update this post as soon as we have the book in hand and Read it Aloud!! **\n\nUntil then….\n\nThe soothing rhythms and sounds of the words of this story will work their magic on children at bedtime. Written by award-winning author Deirdre Kessler and illustrated by the talented young artist Christina Patterson, this book evokes a quiet nighttime in Prince Edward Island–a perfect going-to-bed story.

We both really like the colourful illustrations, but I found myself disappointed with the text.\n\nTypically a Picture book has 32 pages (that’s not to say that some have don’t have a few more, and some have less). This book has 24 pages. I just found that by the time we got to the end of the book there was a feeling that I had missed something, or that it just ended too soon.\n\nWondering your opinion….\n\nHave you an opportunity to read this book?\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nABC of Canada by Kim Bellefontaine and Illustrated by Per-Henrik Gurth – Day 8 Read Share Celebrate\n\nWelcome to Day 8 of READ SHARE CELEBRATE.\n\nToday we have 2 different book choices.
