This document summarizes urban housing experiments in Yugoslavia from 1948 to 1970. During this period, Yugoslavia underwent significant social and economic reforms after splitting from the Soviet Union in 1948. The country focused on mass housing construction to address the shortage of housing after World War II. Architects experimented with new prefabricated construction systems, modern architectural styles, and innovative housing unit designs to improve privacy in dense housing. Notable prefabricated systems developed included IMS, KSB, and PBM. The experiments established new approaches to affordable mass housing construction under socialism.",
