        "text": "This paper aims at disclosing to illustrators and designers the perceptive process in children, so that the creation of children&#39;s books may benefit from it. How messages should be structured and what possible impacts they will have on children, namely in what concerns the enhancement of the child&#39;s creativity and aesthetic sense. In order to make the analysis of the impact illustrations have on children, two distinct categories were identified: conventional and non-conventional illustrations. This categorization is supported by Massironi&#39;s work (1982), whose research allowed us to work out this framework, which conveys an external description of the way perception and representation occur in children. Another reference in our work is Rudolph Arnheim (1954), particularly what concerns the psychological development of children according to the different age stages as proposed by Piaget (1951). Based on that, a group of twenty children were asked to make drawings, after th...\n\nThroughout centuries, children’s books have influenced the identity creation of children in various levels, in the form of fairy tales, folk tales, picture books, Disney cartoons, and movies. Modern child spends more time with interactive learning/visual aids than with traditional pedagogical means which mainly consist of printed texts. Majority of their learning and leisure activities include focus on picture books, flash cards or several interactive pedagogical structures like interactive boards, pop-up books, animated movies etc. Receptive skills in children can be enhanced in their developmental stage in this way. It aids their psychological development and language acquisition skills along with socio-cultural aspects. Adults also relive their childhood days while engaging themselves with children and children’s books carrying the roles of facilitator, caretaker, parent or educator. This paper discusses the impact that visual media has imparted in the field of children’s literature and how it helps in the cognitive and psycho- linguistic development of children. Visual media has gained greater importance in recent years and has incredibly affected the contemporary modern world. It has made a tremendous influence in the field of literature, specifically in children’s literature. I postulate that children’s literature lays the foundation of shared intergenerational, national and international culture, a barometer of beliefs and anxieties about children and childhood, and a body of literature with its own genres, classic texts and avant-garde experiments.\n\nThis article presents a psychological study of the mother image projected in cartoons and its perception by elementary school students. The research provides evidence for the importance of an integral approach to the analysis of media texts addressed to children, as well as for the necessity of considering their narrative, verbal, and descriptive components. A psychological analysis was conducted on the material of three cartoons: \"Chunya\" (USSR), \"Barboskiny\" [The Barkers] (Russia), and \"Peppa Pig\" (UK). Hypotheses were formulated about the potential influence of the cartoons on the younger audience. 70 elementary school students (χ = 9.5 years old) took part in the study. The research was conducted using the method of semantic differential; the data obtained were processed using factor analysis. The results show that the categorization of images follows the factors of \"education\", \"love\", \"patience\", and \"respect\". Differences in the semantic assessment of the cartoons under study are presented. Children perceive the events taking place in a cartoon directly, without reflection. Artistic mediation-polysemy, metaphors, and the category of the comic-does not evoke an aesthetic reaction in children, as assumed by the authors. It was found that the semantic assessment of the word \"mother\" by elementary school students did not agree\n\nChildren have their own unique way in telling stories visually. By their intuition, somehow they manage to invent various methods which are unique. The way they draw does not fit the aesthetic values and logic that is seen through adult's eyes, especially the perspective theory. They would naturally emphasize on how to deliver they stories to others. The medium in which this fact could be clearly seen is through children's drawing. Primadi Tabrani, professor from ITB, Indonesia, had conducted extensive research regarding the children's drawing and the way to read the message within. Tabrani described this phenomenon as children's visual language. Furthermore, Tabrani researched the relation between children's drawing and visual language of the world. He concluded that many ancient art artifacts from artist from the Eastern part of the world had the same approach in conveying their message with children's drawing and visual language. Tabrani described this finding as the Eastern Visual Language. The same approach nowadays could be found in various illustrations in children's picture book. Adapting drawings that emphasize on stories with visuals that resembles children's drawing make these picture books more suitable to their target audience. Furthermore, they create a unique visual storytelling that carries the ancient tradition from the Eastern world to the present day. Focusing on picture books from Indonesia and Korea, this paper is intended to analyze how present day illustrators managed to adapt this distinctive visual language and how to read their drawings using children's visual language, by looking through their works."
