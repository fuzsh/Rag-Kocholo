Printed as a special edition entitled The Museum of Applied Art, it also accompanied the Museum's very first exhibition. Following a short introduction on the founding of the Museum and its work, the book mainly focused on applied art itself as a field of activity which up to that time had not been sufficiently promoted or studied, especially in our country. For this and a number of other reasons, they have included in that book a chapter entitled Survey of Applied Art in Serbia Through the Centuries written by Mirjana Ćorović Ljubinković and Đorđe Mano Zisi. In the text they look at a wide spectrum of artistic crafts included in applied art: jewellery, ceramics, textiles, embroidery, metalwork, woodwork, stonework, and book illustration. The book is completed by 16 black-and-white illustrations. This year the Museum of Applied Art celebrates 55 years since its foundation and dedicates this second only publication on the Museum to this important jubilee. The book was inspired by a desire to inform the general public about the Museum, first of all through a selection of representative applied art objects from the Museum's extensive and valuable collections and through the high quality illustrations that modern technology makes possible. In addition, the book's text gives important information on the history of the Museum: how it was born, its artistic profile, its history, the experts who left their mark on its work, its collections, exhibitions, catalogues and other publications, as well as its specialised work and activities which may be of general interest. This 004\n\nbook is the result of a collective effort by all the Museum's curators. The decree founding the Museum states that “…the task of the Museum of Applied Art is to contribute to the development of applied arts and crafts and to this end to collect, to preserve, to study and to exhibit objects showing the development of applied arts and crafts from earliest times up to the present day, and in particular the achievements of mediaeval art”. With this in mind, we can proudly state that, in this relatively brief period of 55 years, the Museum has been successful in respecting and attaining these long-term objectives. In its passage and growth through time, the Museum has recorded its presence in a clear continuous progression where each new added layer represented a logical result of previous positive achievements, but also an answer to the new developmental demands of applied art imposed by a new age. …to collect – today the Museum has more than 30, 000 objects in its holdings and it owes a debt of gratitude to countless donors whose gifts over the years have enriched and increased its collections. …to exhibit – up to now the Museum has staged around 1,000 exhibitions and maintained all the traditional manifestatins marking its existence of several decades, which testifies to its firm foundations, but also to its ability to observe new trends and apply new experience. Through the large themed exhibitions mounted by its curators or exhibitions of works by individual applied artists, and through showings of foreign exhibitions in its galleries,\n\nthe Museum has inspired and motivated the development of our own artists and applied art researchers. Our permanent exhibitions showing a wide variety of art objects have afforded the general public an opportunity of familiarising themselves with applied art among the Slavs, from the time they came to the Balkans down to the present day, while the specialised exhibitions have given them a chance to learn about the journey of European applied art from Gothic to Secession or to delve into the techniques of decorating period furniture. …to study – the Museum carries out its obligation to publicise the results of its study of applied art through its very lively publishing activity. Among the many publications issued by the Museum pride of place is occupied by its Journal and study catalogues which deal with specific areas, topics or authors of applied art exhibitions. These include: Serbian Printed Books and Manuscripts, Jewellery in Serbia, City Costume of th th the 19 Century, 19 Century Serbian Photography, Pirot kilims, Mirrors, Fashion in Belgrade 1918-1941, Silverware in 19 th Century Serbia, Crosses, Contemporary Serbian Tapestries, Serbian Ceramics, Clocks, Surrealist Photography, Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak, Dragoslav Stojanović Sip, and many others. The most valuable editions published by the are Applied Art among the Serbs, volume 1, a work of capital importance, which came out in 1977, and a phototype edition of the Belgrade Armorial II from the early 17th century, which was published this year. …to preserve – alongside these great tasks and obligations is the enormous respon-\n\nsibility which lies on the shoulders of each new Museum’s generation to preserve and protect the treasures entrusted to it – the cultural heritage of applied art. Not only the curators, but the Museum's conservators play a great part here, as well as all other staff members. Finally, all that the Museum does is directed to and recorded in the Central Documentation and is presented to the general public through its public relations service which sends out the kind of message that the Museum wishes to present about itself as a highly competent, modern and dynamic institution, ready to take on all the challenges of our modern age, especially in regard to museum practice, and the promotion, advancement, affirmation and evaluation of applied art. The experience we have gained after our journey of 55 years during the various phases of historical, cultural and economic development of our society demonstrates that we are a vibrant institution whose work, successes, and unflagging enthusiasm have contributed much to the appreciation of applied art as a priceless cultural property on the artistic map of Serbia to the extent that applied art has now rightly become a respected “citizen” in the society of Serbian culture. The Museum remembers and wishes to thank all its friends and numerous associates, and above all those whose efforts and work are woven into the fabric of this institution – called the Museum of Applied Art. Ivanka Zorić, Museum Director\n\n005\n\nThe History of the Museum of Applied Art 1950-2005\n\nOur knowledge of history is never complete, nor can it be, for new things are continually being discovered, which may cause important changes in what we already know about the past. For this reason, we can only interpret the culture of a nation if we look at its development as something that is constantly being formed. In other words, we have to face a reality that is forever mutating, showing different faces from one moment to the next. Our view of the past – whether this refers to celestial bodies, the Earth's crust, living beings or objects of applied arts and crafts – is a picture of constant changes, which are of their very essence creative, and hence unpredictable. Unfortunately, we are only able to perceive what is immutable or what does not alter us, and this means an eternity of things which even time itself cannot harm. And so museums, in which we collect all our formed and preserved past, carry within themselves the germ of man's aspiration to somehow preserve and protect the “body” of our entire cultural development. Happily, man is, among other things, a historical being. This means that he interprets everything that is given with reference to the past, the present and the future and for him the rhythm of history inevitably beats on within the framework of passing time. As a result, each individual object exhibited in museum galleries is torn from the transitory moment of its true purpose and finds itself submerged in the endless movement of time. In this sense, museums are witnesses to the implementation of the unquenchable desire for constant movement that we call history. This is a fact that should not be ignored. For if there is no one to record such objects, it is as if they never existed. 006\n\nThis is the case with the Museum of Applied Art in Belgrade. Since the middle of the last century when it was founded, it has become a witness to the cultural history of the Serbian people, especially in the field of applied arts and crafts. Throughout these years, the Museum has demonstrated its gradual, steady influence on the awareness of its visitors because everything in our lives that is permanent and deeply meaningful has been woven into the fabric of the Museum over time and has left its mark. This may be visible to a lesser or greater degree, but it is nonetheless specific and indelible. A nation may be more truly characterised by its art than by its reality. There are works of art that subsume a rich experience of life and when we look at them, we are examining the qualities of our own soul. These are fine, noble traits of our nation's culture, worthy of the spirit they express. In acquainting the general public with masterpieces of applied art from the rich heritage of Serbian and European cultural treasures, the Museum has exercised an influence which, while not always obvious, is nevertheless present at every step. The Museum of Applied Art in Belgrade became a member of the large family of decorative arts museums almost a century after the establishment of the first museum of this type – the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, founded in 1852. Europe in the second half of the 19th century saw many museums of applied arts being set up as an answer to that age's industrialised production. The problem was that industrial products of the time lacked an aesthetic approach in the manufacture of everyday household objects, which had been unthinkable in the\n\nhandmade production of artifacts in earlier centuries. Born of a need to demonstrate how form can surpass purpose, regardless of the technique being used and the time in question, the first initiatives were launched to create specialised art museums whose basic aim would be to prevent the further degradation of applied art. They all strove towards a renaissance of the artistic styles of the past and a rebirth of the national spirit by revitalising arts and crafts and the artistic design of objects. Moreover, the flowering of history as a science and the awakening of a romantic interest in the past played a great part in the founding of museums of this type. Hard on the heels of the Victoria and Albert came the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris, then the Museum of Applied Art in Vienna, and similar museums in cities all over Europe. In 1880, the Museum of Arts and Crafts was founded in Zagreb. The Museum of Applied Art in Belgrade falls into the category of specialised art museums. It systematically studies the applied arts of the Serbian people within the historical boundaries of its cultural development down the centuries. However, this definition goes nowhere near exhausting its field of interest because the idea of applied art is very close to that of artistic crafts. In a way, artistic crafts permeate decorative applied art to its very core, they cross-fertilise each other, they are inseparable, and we cannot tell where one ends and the other begins. They are notional limits, which encompass two related fields at the same time. Though it must be said that artistic crafts are characterised by clearer definition and a wealth of motifs, which are developed in strictly orthodox schools and over many years of practical work. Everything that is carefully cherished and is accuracely passed on; everything that can be learned and precisely expressed; logic of workmanship, colour, line, tone, structure, order, and form – in short, the characteristic language of every good craftsman. By contrast, yet still within this same artistic language, applied art appears as a result of the\n\nrefined artistic expression and personal creative strength of individual artists. Despite the existing differences between these two fields, it is clear that artistic crafts are the key to many problems that arise in applied art and these can only be resolved within the context of history. Since all applied arts museums spring from the same tree whose deepest root reaches down to artistic crafts, it is logical that the establishment of a school of arts and crafts always precedes the foundation of such a museum. This was the case with the Museum of Applied Art in Belgrade. The fertile cultural climate in Serbia in the early 20th century, and the growing awareness of a Serbian national identity contributed in no small way to the setting up of the first specialised training institution in the country. This was the School of Arts and Crafts, which opened in Belgrade in 1905. Its teachers included leading artists and intellectuals of the day, and in particular Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak. Inkiostri devoted his entire artistic opus to applied art, so he imbued his practical, teaching, and theoretical work with a new spirit, demonstrating the many different possibilities of creating a unique national artistic style. The next important date in the chronology of events is 1938 and the establishment of the School of Applied Art, which produced the first professionally-trained decorative artists. Even though it did not operate on a regular basis during the Second World War, this School did much for the further advancement of applied art. When the war ended, the artistic design of everyday objects grew in importance and in 1948 the School of Applied Art was transformed into the Academy of Applied Artss, thereby gaining university status and training young artists who were to create useful and decorative objects in tune with the needs of a new age. At a time when numerous changes were laying the foundations for a new social, political and economic network of forces and relationships in Serbia, the idea was mooted of establishing a Museum of Applied Art. Given the 007\n\nother artistic activities that were developing in this period, the social atmosphere was undoubtedly ripe for the emergence of a cultural institution that would systematically study objects of applied art by contrast with the previous rather sporadic research in this art field. Hence the initiative to launch a museum whose work would fill the void in studying our national heritage and would motivate new modern art. Thanks to the untiring efforts of Branko Šotra, Đorđe Krekić and Ivan Tabaković, professors at the Academy of Applied Artss, the Museum of Applied Art was founded on 6 November 1950 in Belgrade. The founding document of the Museum was government decree no. 479 issued by the People's Republic of Serbia and published in the country's Official Gazette. This decree defined the basic activity of the Museum in Article 2, which read: “The task of the Museum of Applied Art is to contribute to the advancement of applied art and artistic crafts and to this end to collect, preserve, study and exhibit objects showing the development of applied art and artistic crafts from earliest times down to the present day, and especially the achievements of mediaeval art”. The new Museum was temporarily housed in the Princess Ljubica Lodge. Two completely unsuitable rooms, with no furnishings and no depot for collections were allotted for all the Museum's activities. Bojana Radojković, an art historian, was appointed as the first curator on 9 December 1950, while the administrative work fell to Todorka Mitić, who performed the function of secretary. Due to a lack of space, the first acquisitions, which had been collected prior to the formal opening of the Museum, were handed over to the Academy of Applied Artss for safekeeping. These included a collection of tapestries acquired through restitution, rugs and Persian carpets, and several examples of old silverware, mainly church objects, dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. The shortage of museum material meant that the work of the Museum at the very outset 008\n\nwas reduced to gathering, selecting and purchasing objects to complete its collections in a systematic way. Collecting was mainly focused on works of Serbian applied art and in January 1951 the first purchase was made. Bojana Radojković acquired for the Museum a collection of Pirot kilims, which to this day form the core of the textiles collection. In the first half of 1951 the Museum was given the building at 18 Vuk Karadžić Street, which is still its home, and the professional nucleus was represented by three new curators: Zagorka Janc, Dobrila Stojanović, and Jelica Popović. The first director of the Museum was Nada Andrejević Kun, who had worked in the Ministry of Education on the very idea of a future museum of applied art before the government decree was passed on its foundation. Soon after her appointment, the Museum added to its employees the necessary administrative and ancillary staff. It is understandable that in this first phase of development a great part was played by the members of the Expert Advisory Board: Ivan Tabaković, Branko Šotra, and Đorđe Krekić (professors at the Academy of Applied Artss), Đorđe Mano Zisi (adviser), and Mirjana Ljubinković Ćorović and Milenko Filipović (senior researchers at the National Museum). Their advice was indispensable in gaining experience of professional museum management and familiarisation with the problems facing applied art. This cooperation made it possible for all the important issues connected with a knowledge and understanding of the development of applied art to be resolved on the spot, thereby allowing organisation of the Museum's specific work to unfold in its full range. In addition, constant contact was main-tained with other arts experts who had earlier lent their support to the founding of the Museum, and also with all those who could exert a positive influence on the promotion of applied art in our country. In Febuary 1951, the Museum began negotiations to purchase a very valuable collection built up over 30 years by wellknown painter\n\nand graphic artist Ljuba Ivanović. Thanks to the mediation of Ivan Tabaković and financial backing from the People's Republic of Serbia, the Museum acquired the collection, which bears witness to the continuity of the cultural history of the Serbs in the Balkans in the number and variety of the objects it contains. It became the cornerstone on which all historical sections of the Museum were built up. The collection was received from the daughter of the deceased Ljuba Ivanović by Đorđe Mano Zisi, Mirjana Ćorović Ljubinković, Bojana Radojković and Zagorka Janc. The collection had grown up mainly in the period between the two world wars and consists of 3,116 objects, principally metalwork, objects made by goldsmiths and traditional metal craftsmen. Some items, fashioned in the period between the 13th and 19th centuries, have considerable artistic and historical cultural value. For example, the 14th century jewellery, late 14th centuryearly 15th century icon of St. Dimitrije, rare examples of copper censers from the 15th century, fragments of horos (church chandelier), mediaeval moulds for casting seals, rings and spoons, small pairs of scales, and various metalworking tools. In addition, the collection includes old manuscripts and printed books, objects carved in wood, horn, and mother-ofpearl, wood-carved and painted icons, as well as a large number of handicraft objects of the folklore type – elements of national costume and embroidery based on folk motifs. The acquisition of this collection secured an important holding for the Museum from which to proceed to classification of the objects it contained, the formation of different collections, preparations for the establishment of a permanent museum collection, and finally and most importantly – expert museological analysis of the items. However, this sort of historical research runs into a number of methodological problems in preparing material. History is, in essence, an empirical science and it cannot be separated from the firm foundations of concrete proof, otherwise\n\nit degenerates into pure speculation. Therefore, the first and basic task facing curators is to go through all available records from the past that might give a closer and fuller picture of the objects they are researching. The most significant testimonies are provided by written sources that offer permanently fixed, relatively clear data and facts. Yet these have to be critically examined because language can express thoughts, but also disguise them. The objects themselves are another source, more palpable than written testimonies, but it is more difficult to fathom their meaning, sometimes only possible by comparing them with similar relics from the past. This is where applied art objects belong. There are cases where historical sources of this type are almost all that have come down to us. And so we find ourselves in the paradoxical situation where such an object is the sole source of information we have about ourselves. In other words, it can be treated as a physical remnant from the past but at the same time, as something representing certain spiritual and cultural concepts, in which case it serves as the basis for a deeper understanding of the broader historical context of the age to which it belongs. The same fundamental principles of internal logic and historical comparison are equally valid here, except that they are applied in forms that correspond to this double meaning of each object. This usually refers to chance finds where the position of the object and the circumstances in which it is discovered are as important as the object itself. In these cases, the type and purpose of the object are examined first, and then the date of its origin. Only then do we proceed to other issues: who made it and why, using what material, how did its creator live, how did he see the world… These objects are very significant as they relate to cultures where there was no alphabet, but even in cases where there are written sources, they frequently offer valuable supplementary information. For example, there would be vital gaps in our conception of the Middle Ages were it not for the metal coins or religious paintings, which often provide a bridge 009\n\nto the written records of the time. The historian's skill is to interpret the facts uncovered in the sources in such a way that this interpretation provides answers to questions, yet never opposes a single indisputably proved fact. Likewise, he must take care that his interpretations are free from any prejudice and ideology from his own age. In view of all the problems associated with the historical study of objects of applied art, it becomes clear just how much enthusiasm, effort, and knowledge was invested by the then Museum curators when they were able, in less than a year, to research many objects which figure in the Museum's permanent collection before it opened on 9 December 1951. And in so doing, they fulfilled one of the fundamental aims – to open the Museum to the public and offer ordinary people, art lovers and interested experts an insight into everything created in our country in the field of applied art, as well as exhibits emanating from other parts of the world. The nucleus of the permanent collection – supplemented and changed several times as time went on – comprised objects from the Ljuba Ivanović Collection. However, since this Collection could not hope to represent all the fields and epochs of applied art, collaboration was established with the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the National Museum, and the Ethnographic Museum, who were generous enough to loan valuable examples of artistic craftwork from their own collections in order to complete that first permanent collection. The choice of exhibits at that first show encompassed th th a broad period, from the 12 to the 19 century. The intention was to give a chronological and complex overview of all branches of decorative arts and crafts among the Serbs. In parallel with its exhibitions, the Museum also started developing the publishing side of its work. The first publication The Museum of Applied Art gave a description of the Museum and, since it also served to mark the first permanent exhibition, carried a text entitled A 010\n\nShort History of Applied Art in Serbia through the Centuries, written by members of the Museum's Board of Experts: Mirjana Ćorović Ljubinković and Đorđe Mano Zisi. The publication likewise contained reproductions of individual items from the permanent exhibition. The Museum Library, founded at the same time as the Museum, added this publication to its specialised book holdings. Although the Library was primarily set up to support the work of the curators, due to the specific nature of its book collection, it attracted a large number of users even then among researchers and experts from outside the Museum. During its first year the Museum organised a specialised service for the conservation and protection of Museum items. In fact, this was a workshop for the repair of period furniture in which the Museum's carpenterconservator carried out complex conser-vation and restoration work on damaged furniture from the Museum holdings. In this same first year of its existence, the Museum managed to overcome the usual teething troubles in promoting various activities that were of vital importance for its future. One problem facing the Museum staff was what methodology to choose in authenticating, evaluating and categorising museum material as this would later affect its organisational structure. In the past, objects of applied art were mainly described within the framework of historical, ethnological, archaeological or philological study. What was overlooked was that applied art, and the problems associated with it, cut to the very heart of human creativity in all fields of material culture. The Philosophy Faculty's Department of Art History taught nothing about world or Serbian history of applied art – a situation that continues to this day. As this subject was not given enough attention, the Museum set itself the task of studying the birth of our cultural heritage more thoroughly. When looking at applied art among the Serbs, it is an indisputable fact that it can be traced\n\nback to the 9th century. Everything before that time is unreliable and cannot be substantiated by concrete fact. The shadow of four great civilizations – Classical, Byzantine, We-stern European, and Islamic - have always hovered historically over our land. The question may well be asked whether we were completely submerged by the sphere in which these circles coincided and intersected. Certainly it may be said that we were exposed to their crossing paths, but despite the enormous pressure on us to assimilate, we succeeded in standing firm and retaining our authenticity. Some works of art demonstrate the great skill of our craftsmen who, while keeping pace with artistic trends in other countries, brought to their work the expression of those differing influences that were interwoven in this part of the world, at the same time investing them with the specific stamp of our own country and customs. From this point of view, a historical study of Serbian applied art is free from a narrow, one-sided approach and allows a much broader historical sweep. Museum material, duly collected and processed, shatters old conceptions and broadens horizons into a new world where liberation from narrow views is made possible. This is the true beauty of scholarship when it takes real objects, gives them meaning and makes it possible to fill some empty space on the map of the past and so complete the map of the history of art. There is an indivisible bond between works of art and museums – especially where applied art is concerned. Yet at the same time, this unusual coupling is inherently dangerous because not all that is on show in a museum is great art. It may be felt that decorative arts and crafts and their historical progression cannot be separated and that, in recreating a picture of the past, all research inevitably colours this picture with our ideas and experience of the present. Hence the danger that museums, preoccupied with the current fashion, could be turned into mere stockrooms of vulgarity and kits. The Museum's early curators did not fall\n\ninto this trap. They adhered strictly to scientific methods in their research and they respected the order imposed by any historical study: first, study of the critical source, then confirmation and analysis of the facts, and finally scientific synthesis. Gathering documentation and preparing it for scientific research could be treated as a separate segment. Any other division of the task in hand would mean a loss of direct contact with the sources, which is an inexhaustible inspiration for new questions, new ideas and cannot be achieved by any other means. It is the only firm foundation for confirmed results. Thanks to this approach, the Museum became independent in its work and thus has been able to expand and develop new activities in all directions emanting from its core task. The gathering of objects for collections was mainly directed towards material from the Serbian national and cultural region. But for reasons of comparison, material was also collected from other European and nonEuropean countries. These objects were usually acquired through purchase, though some were acquired from the Commission for International Cultural Relations, from the National Museum, the Ethnographic Museum, the Serbian Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, the Belgrade City Assembly, and private owners. Alongside the collections of the research department, holdings of a documentary character also grew. These gradually led to the formation of the photographic library, the printed media collection, the central inventory, and the Museum archives. These documentary collections came together to form the Sector for Central Documentation, which was part of the Library at the start. With an increasing inflow of new material it became necessary to change the original structure of the Museum's organisation in two departments – research and general. Within these two departments independent professional sectors and their accompanying services were set up. Research became the Museum's core department in which five independent 011\n\nsectors were formed: -\n\nSector for the Historical and Artistic Development of Metal-Working, with collections, - Sector for the Historical and Artistic Development of Furniture and Woodwork, with collections, - Sector for the Historical and Artistic Development of Costume and Textiles, with collections, - Sector for the Historical and Artistic Development of Applied Graphics, Art Photography, and Book Illustration, with collections, Sector for the Historical and Artistic Development of Ceramics, Porcelain, and Glass, with collections. These five professional sectors built up their own respective collections, where the museum material was classified on the basis of its purpose and artistic attributes. This made it possible to monitor certain branches of applied art over a continuous historical period, while objects within the collections continued to be grouped according to their type, use, and artistic styles. As regards their work methods and specific features, the sectors could be defined as history-led since they collect, preserve, protect and study decorative art objects dating right up to the early 20th century. As the Museum expanded and developed its activities, new sectors and services grew up, but the basic principle of organisation remained the same. In time, the Department of Joint Services with its attendant administration, accounts section, and auxiliary services, separated off from the General Department. Apart from collecting valuable material and submitting it to expert analysis, the Museum's experts showed the results of their scholarship and research through a number of themed study exhibitions. As soon as the Museum's permanent 012\n\ncollection was opened, preparations started on the first such themed exhibition Serbian Printed Books and Manuscripts, which opened in 1952. This was followed by many others. This type of museum activity proved extremely rewarding as it entailed the expert analysis of material that had been only partially authenticated or not at all. Moreover, work on these exhibitions regularly resulted in new additions to the existing collections. A printed catalogue always accompanied the exhibitions, containing an expert introduction, a list of the objects on show, and a large number of reproductions. The catalogues were produced by the Museum curators according to the items being exhibited, except for the first exhibition whose foreword was written by Đorđe Radojičić, professor at Novi Sad University. Due to the range of the topics chosen, these exhibitions had to be supplemented with material from other museums, monastery treasuries, and often from private collections, too. In this way, the Museum was able to establish fruitful cooperation with other cultural institutions and private collectors. Some of these themed exhibitions travelled to other towns in what was then Yugoslavia. They included: Artistic Metalwork in Serbia and Artistic Embroidery in Serbia. The second exhibition, with a catalogue in German, was shown in Vienna, Graz, and Klagenfurt. The high esteem in which the Museum was held even then is borne out by the fact that foreign news-papers and professional journals almost always carried articles on its exhibitions or short reviews of its publications. This exhibition activity worked both ways. Many exhibitions from other museums were guests at the Museum. The Exhibition of Coptic Cloths from the National Museum in Ljubljana, held in July and August 1954, was the first in a long line of such visiting exhibitions. In addition, the Museum made contact with numerous cultural institutions all over the world (through the good offices of the Commission for International Cultural Relations). Through this\n\ninternational exchange programme, the Museum brought foreign exhibitions to its galleries and greatly expanded its publishing activity. The first such exhibition was Dutch Posters, which opened in September 1954. A number of exhibitions took place that illustrated different historical styles or represented self-contained stylistic segments from the Museum's collections. The aim here was to acquaint the general public with those sections of the Museum's holdings which, for lack of space, could not be on permanent show, but which languished in the Museum depots. This type of show started off with Objects of Islamic Art, mounted in 1956. In 1964, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Liberation of Belgrade, the Museum joined in the festivities by establishing the Children's October Salon of Applied Art. This exhibition became a tradition annual event in the field of children's decorative art and design, and forms part of the Museum's programme of cooperation with primary schools, nursery schools and other child institutions, taking place every October. The Museum also initiated and nurtured inter-museum collaboration through the exchange of exhibitions with similar institutions abroad. These include the Museum of Applied Art in Vienna, the Hermitage Museum in St.Petersburg, and the Museum of Czech Literature in Prague, to name but a few. This cooperation with foreign museums began in 1967 with the exhibition Czechoslovakian Fine Books. 1945-1965. In February 1970, the Salon of Applied Art (Fig.1) was launched. This event broadened the Museum's exhibition work with shows by contemporary applied artists. These shows were by invitation, and the first such exhibition was Exhibition of Illustrations by Živojin Kovačević. From 1951 to 1970, the Museum's permanent collection was twice increased and refreshed by a new way of displaying the exhibits. This was done first in 1958, and again in May 1969, when the collection was enhanced by the addition of 20 new items (Fig. 2). On both occasions, new\n\nFig.1.\n\nNada Andrejević Kun at the opening of the exhibition of stage costumes by Milica Babić on 6 March, 1973.\n\ndisplay and artistic ideas were introduced to present the exhibits. The Museum began its publishing work with a booklet to accompany the opening of the permanent collection, but the first study exhibition set in motion a whole series of exhibition catalogues. Depending on the type of exhibition, these catalogues covered a wide range of subjects. The biggest group comprised catalogues containing a study of the exhibition's theme. For all exhibitions of the study type, a catalaogue was produced which offered an introduction dealing with the historical and artistic aspects of the subject, a catalogued list of the items on show,\n\nFig.2. The Permanent Collection on the second floor, 1969.\n\n013\n\nand a large number of repro-ductions. Catalogues for exhibitions of Museum items were less ambitious. Due to a shortage of funds, these were modest in character and duplicated on the mimeograph. Catalogues for exhibitions that were part of the Children's October Salon were specially adapted to the content of the exhibition, and for the first 20 years followed a typical format. Catalogues for the Salon of Applied Art also followed a single artistic and graphic style. The introduction was followed by a short biography of the artist, a catalogued list of the items, and illustrations. The category of special publications likewise covers catalogues for visiting exhibitions, which the Museum printed. Hungarian Goldsmiths' Art was published in 1968, with professional articles written by István Dienes and Sándor Mihalik. The catalogue for the exhibition Rumanian Court Costume was written by Corina Nicolescu and published in 1969. In 1969, again, a catalogue of the Museum's collections was compiled and written by Ruža Drecun and entitled The Glass of Emil Gallé and His Successors. The special group of publications belongs to the category of professional studies. The Production and Crafting of Glass Through the Centuries, by Ruža Gajić Lončar, was published in 1964. Different in character, but unique of its type, was the monography of Bojana Radojković Serbian Jewellery from the 12th-18th Century, which was also published in 1964. Constantly testing the expertise of its curators, the Museum regularly published monographic studies and catalogues. However, in order to obtain a better insight into their work and to realise the Museum's manifold programme of activities, it was imperative to start up a periodical publication containing articles, debates, and material from the world of decorative art, as well as reports on the Museum's individual projects. This scholarly approach to the work of the Museum took shape in 1955 with the first 014\n\nvolume of the Museum of Applied Art Journal, which became its core publication. As this journal was the first periodical publication of its type in our country, contributions were collected from all sides. Through this publishing activity, the Museum managed to bring together both inhouse contributors and those from similar museums or related academic institutions from all over what was then Yugoslavia, but also experts from abroad. Museum publications likewise included printed posters from individual exhibitions and reproductions of objects from its collections. In 1970, it issued a Guide to the Museum of Applied Art as a partly professional, partly popular publication intended to acquaint the general public with the history and collections of the Museum. Alongside its burgeoning exhibition and publishing activity, the Museum developed its educational and information work, through various forms of cooperation with young people and adults. Both professional and informative lectures were held around exhibitions, documentary films shown, historical evenings arranged and demonstrations organised of the techniques involved in producing different materials like ceramics or posters. The lectures took place in the Museum and were illustrated with original Museum pieces or films describing them. Zagorka Janc gave the very first lecture in the Museum in 1952, entitled The Art of Book Illustration, and this accompanied the Museum's first professional exhibition, Serbian Manuscripts and Printed Books. Besides lectures, the Museum organised small circles in which participants learned the techniques of fashioning different materials through practical work. From 1955 onwards, the Museum ran two active circles – history and ceramics. The history circle offered lectures on the culture of materials in mediaeval Serbia and thereafter during the period of Turkish rule. The ceramics circle provided theoretical and practical knowledge on working with clay. It employed the services of an expert from the Academy of Appli-\n\ned Artss and a potter, who demonstrated how to shapes objects using a potter's wheel. From its very beginning the Museum established cooperation with the History of Art Department of Belgrade University's Philosophy Faculty and the Museum curators held practical seminars for art history students. For reasons of scholarship and research it was also important to hold conferences like the symposium dedicated to printed books in Serbia of 1965 to accompany the exhibition The Cover Page in Serbian Printed Books. The Museum's educational and informa-tion work soon expanded, again dictating changes to its organisational structure and in 1963, the five historical sectors were joined by a sixth, the Sector for Education and Information. The Museum Library, which numbered 2,690 books in 1960, greatly increased its book holdings and collaborated with around 300 professional and academic institutions at home and abroad. In 1964, the Library could already boast almost 10,000 volumes and that same year it, too, became an independent sector of the Museum. As part of its work the Library gathered together the Museum's exhibition and professional material in the form of documentary and illustrated data. This database grew so large in time that it was necessary to establish an independent sector to collect, document, and process all the Museum's documentary material and provide a documentary survey of all the objects held by the Museum. In 1964, as part of the Museum's core department, the Sector for Central Documentation was established as an independent professional service. Even though it was late in starting up, it soon introduced all the required methods of recording the Museum collections, for example, a central inventory, an inventory of film negatives, an inventory of printed matter, and a professional archive. At the same time as the Museum was founded, a carpentry and conservation workshop was set up, specialising in the restoration of\n\nperiod furniture. As this workshop was unique in Serbia at the time, it was accorded the status of the central Serbian workshop for the conservation of wood and restoration of period furniture. Just a little later a laboratory was set up for the conservation of metal. So around the same time, by 1965, these two workshops separated into independent service units – the Workshop for the Conservtion of Wood and the Restoration of Period Furniture, and the Conservation and Preparation Laboratory for Metal and Other Materials. The second decade of the Museum's existence saw the continued gathering of decorative art objects from earlier historical periods, but also the collection of similar material of contemporary design. Within the historical sectors' collections the number of objects originating in the 20th century continued to grow. In 1965, the Museum was gifted a large collection of posters by the National Library, which provided a good basis for a new independent sector for the study of contemporary trends in applied art. In 1966, this sector was officially set up under the title Sector of Contemporary Applied Art. By contrast with the historical sectors, the Sector of Contemporary Applied Art gathered together objects fashioned in the 20th century. Since this was an era where the more traditional crafting of objects was mostly replaced by industrial manufacture, chronological classification and evaluation of the pieces collected based on the criterion of similarity of material was not suitable, and so the principle of classification on the basis of unique artistic attributes was applied. Exceptionally, in this sector the division of materials according to technical properties and purpose could not be complete because in modern industrial production the material of which an object is made is not of overriding importance for its aesthetic and formal qualities, unlike the past when objects were fashioned according to strict rules of the craft. In 1969, the Museum became the central institution for applied art museum material in 015\n\nSerbia. By a decision of the Executive Council of the Socialist Republic of Serbia Assembly, and in line with the Museum Act, the Museum was duty bound to collect professional documentation and keep records on objects of applied art in all other museums in Serbia, thus forming a documentation centre on these objects. As such, it had to assess the status, needs and work conditions of these museums and propose organisational and professional measures for their development. The same year a Central Service was formed, as an independent sector within the core department, but later it was closed down and all work linked to the central function of the Museum was taken over by Sector for Central Documentation. That year also saw the design of the Museum logo, which is made up of the interwoven initials of the Museum of Applied Art (M, P, U in Serbian). This very imaginative logotype, which even today exudes a sense of contemporary design and style, was the work of graphic artist Milan Martinović. As the Museum grew, so its first curators developed, laying the foundations for a scholarly approach to the history of Serbian applied art. As director, Nada Andrejević Kun had a clear vision as to how the Museum should move forward. She put this vision into effect consistently and pragma-tically, insisting all the while that the professional work of the curators should be based on facts and a critical appraisal of cause and effect between historical categories. She marched ahead with firm steps towards her goal, without deviating from this basic concept. When the th Museum celebrated its 20 birthday in 1970, Nada Andrejević Kun retired. The Museum had expanded its basic activities and out of this had come a real basis for new approaches to new problems. The same approach holds good today, for the present is always an answer to the past, a kind of challenge to old truths that change, in the face of new experiences and new needs, and are transformed into new achievements. For each 016\n\nnew movement in the arts is a comment on some previous movement, which it only seems to destroy. However, something essential always remains, something from which everything springs and to which everything returns. Where is contemporary applied art if not in the design from which we set out and to which we return, even if we surpass it along the way? Design is everywhere around us. It includes not only three-dimensional objects made by human hand, graphic communications and integrated systems of information technology, like films, television, commercials, computers, and mobile phones, but also sounds and smells, in fact, everything that acts upon the senses. Modern man is proud of being cautious and suspicious of the fantastic disorder of our modern world. This obvious fact hides behind its own obviousness, so we fail to see the blossoming chaos in our urban areas, which we tolerate, put up with, try to ignore, or take as an accepted fact. In order to eliminate these hotspots of disorder, it is necessary to look at our changing world in a new and critical way, for the world is not only changing in its visual manifestation, but much more importantly, the forces that govern this outward appearance are changing and it is they that shape the environment which man has created. It is a known fact that, through the instruments of modern design, many different messages can be transmitted, uniting the intellectual, practical, commercial and aesthetic problems encountered in the field of decorative art, but equally in all other areas of everyday life. Therefore, design can be very roughly defined as an idea which helps us to shape and interpret all the products of human creation, including the numerous ways of fashioning the most contrasting spheres of physical and spiritual reality. In the narrow sense, design encompasses furniture, textiles, glass, ceramics, metal objects, graphic design, and marginally, architecture. So design is not simply a process linked to manufacture, but a means by which ideas and attitudes about values and the role of utility, aesthetics,\n\nornamentation and symbolism in everyday objects are communicated. Nevertheless, we should not forget that designs cannot be fully comprehended outside the social, economic, cultural and technological conditions which influenced their development and creation. In other words, the regulatory and structural principle governing a design, which is at its heart, can only be understood from the standpoint of its function, that is, from the perspective of the social need that it fulfils. Up to 1970, the Museum was mostly interested in collecting historical and artistic objects and material, while contemporary trends in applied art and design were only sporadically monitored. It was not until the formation of the Sector for Contemporary Applied Art, with its collections, that conditions were laid down for the Museum to broaden its horizons to include modern trends. It was this period that saw the first exhibitions of the Museum Salon. When Jevta Jevtović took over as director in 1971, he initiated new activities aimed at bringing applied art and design closer together. Over a period of six years he introduced a whole series of innovations, which led to the emergence of the Design Bureau as a new operative unit of the Museum, tasked with researching, preparing and setting up direct cooperation with the business world, designers and artists. At that time there were not many experts to call upon for help so, relying on its own resources, the Museum played a pioneering role in affirming design in our country. First of all, it was vital that artists linked up with the economy in order that the world of business understood the importance of artistic design in industrial manufacture, and the Museum Salon presented an ideal opportunity. The Design Bureau had a professional and academic foothold in all other fields of activity with the result that the Museum's research work and exhibition activity represented those ideas, styles, trends, designers, schools and institutions that shaped theoretical and\n\npractical movements in design and helped develop new forms. Care was also taken to promote all those designers who had an influence on taste, history and styles in applied art, culture and society as a whole. The exhibition work of the Museum in this regard, as well as its educational and informative role, can be described as representing a broad range of widely differing approaches to design. The Museum showed the doubting Thomases who felt that narrow specialisation kills the creative spirit in our modern age that designers can offer the world something new and original, something that moves society one step forward and changes instilled habits, directing them towards new ideas within the transformation that historical reality imposes. Art and industry should not be at loggerheads, for any art that has no link with man is redundant. Fully aware of this fact, Jevta Jevtović was far-seeing enough at the time to recognise the signs that were to become the spirit and expression of the age to come. Besides setting up the Design Bureau, the Museum joined forces with the Art Festival in Subotica to launch the Triennial Exhibition of Yugoslav Ceramics in 1971, an event that brought together all ceramics artists from the former Yugoslavia. It has since grown into a traditional meet and the Museum has so far organised 11 triennial exhibitions and published the accompanying catalogues. At the same time there was an initiative to form the Salon of Architecture so that architecture and town planning in Serbia could be presented to the general public, along with those projects and designs that had emerged in this field each year. The first exhibition of the Salon of Architecture was held in 1974 and it, too, became an annual event. It is always accompanied by a catalogue produced by the Museum. In 1977, the Museum put out its first major publication, the first volume of the series History of Applied Art with the Serbs. It was the work of the Museums's first curators – Bojana 017\n\nFig.3. The Museum of Applied Art building.\n\nFig.4. The Salon of the Museum of Applied Art.\n\n018\n\nRadojković, Dobrila Stojanović, Zagorka Janc, and Verena Han, who also contributed the most important chapters. This publication was the crown of their professional career and became a sort of “histo-rical guide” to Serbian decorative art because it affirmed in the best way possible the historical continuity and clear orientation of this art towards an objective synthesis based on critical method and a wealth of documentation. Starting from these premises, more detailed and careful study of different categories of objects and the rich store of classified material revealed the fundamental idea on which the book is based – an unflagging search for a Serbian cultural identity. During this period the Museum also worked on systematically completing the holdings of some collections in the Sector of Contemporary Applied Art. Ongoing purchases led to the formation of the most complete collection of posters in the country. In 1978, Gojko Subotić took over as Museum director. His arrival evinced no change in the course the Museum had set itself except for a continued broadening of horizons. In the period of less than 2 years that he spent in the Museum, this outstanding expert succeeded in resolving a number of burning issues. He immediately set to work on one of these – perhaps the biggest and most demanding – that of adapting the Museum building to suit the Museum's needs (Fig.3). Today the building accommodating the Museum of Applied Art is under mixed ownership. After the Second World War it was partly nationalised and up to mid-1951 housed the Ministry of Public Buildings when the Museum of Applied Art was moved into it. In the section belonging to the Republic of Serbia government, the Museum occupies part of the wing at 5A. Čubrina Street - the ground, second and third floors, while the main body of the Museum – the ground floor, part of the first floor, and the second and third floors are at 18 Vuk Karadžić Street. The Gallery on the first floor of the Museum is rented from the owners, the Čelebonović family. In 2001, the building was\n\ndeclared a cultural monument, by a decision published in issue no. 59 of the Republic of Serbia's Official Gazette. The Museum building is situated in the very heart of the city of Belgrade and covers an area extending from Čubrina Street to Vuka Karadžića Street. In the inter-war period it was better known as the Čelebonović Palace. The building was erected as a residential and commercial structure for the Čelebonović family, consisting of a ground floor, two upper floors and an attic area. The splendour and exclusive character of the original interior is reflected even today in the original marble entrance, small entrance hall and marble staircase with a strikingly lovely wrought iron banister. The unique and valuable ambient is also preserved in the original interior of the Salon (Fig.4) on the first floor, decorated in Neo-Renaissance style with fine wood panelling and a cassetted ceiling. The building was erected between 1927 and 1929. Its designer was architect Mihajlo Belić, in conjunction with Nikola Krasnov who was responsible for the façade decoration, and Dutch architect Neregar, who arranged and designed the interior. The building falls into the category of residential-commercial structures of the “palace on the corner” type characteristic of Belgrade architecture in the period between the two world wars. In architectural style, where the entire exterior and architectural details are concerned, the palace can be described as a work of eclectic architecture with Neo-Classical elements. The manner of its elevation on the street façade, with monumental hanging balconies and massive columns, typifies the style of Nikola Krasnov, a well-known architect of the time. Since the Čelebonović Palace was intended to be rented out, tenants included the Spanish Embassy, law offices, and leading fashion salons. The ground floor was reserved for small businesses of the “corner shop” type, according to the original plans, while the residential units lay on the second and third floors, and\n\nthe attic area was reserved for servants. The original layout of the rooms was merely adapted to meet the requirements of the Museum. This led to the first adaptation of the shops at street level, which were turned into a gallery, while the second and third floors were redesigned to provide space for the permanent exhibitions. Later several other changes were made to individual rooms, but no drastic reconstruction. The biggest facelift effected by architect Milan Pališaški took place between 1978 and 1979 when the second-floor gallery and the office space on the first and third floors were redesigned, including the introduction of new furniture, lighting, etc. The basement and ground floor also underwent changes to produce modern exhibition space. The shaping and decoration of these rooms was carried out in such a way as to accommodate the different kinds of decorative art exhibits on show. In 1979, a new sector, the Sector for Architecture, Town Planning and Architectural Design, was launched. Its purpose was to study the development of architecture in modern urban conglomerations and to gather useful documentation. This Sector's collections grew out of the long-term activity of the Salon of Architecture, and the legacies of two architects Branko Maksimović\n\nFig.5. Bojana Radojković with British premier Margaret Thatcher at the opening of the exhibition English Silver on 24 September, 1980.\n\n019\n\nand Miladin Prljević. During this period the Museum mounted several study exhibitions and others were put together for exhibition spaces in other parts of the city. In the 20 months of his tenure, Gojko Subotić did a lot for the benefit of the Museum: he improved staff working conditions, founded the Sector for Architecture, Town Planning and Architectural Design, and extended the Museum's exhibition space, without losing sight of the institution's basic concept. Moreover, not once was the Museum's ramified programme of activity interrupted due to reconstruction work. The first recognition that the Museum stood shoulder to shoulder with worldrenowned professional institutions of similar type came when Bojana Radojković took over as director. On 24 September 1980, the visiting exhibition English Silver was officially opened. This had come about as the result of collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the world's leading museum of applied art. The exhibition was ope-ned by Margaret Thatcher, prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Fig. 5). On show for the first time in our country were excellent examples of silverware dating from the early 16th century to around 1920 - large silver platters, jugs, goblets, bath accessories and cutlery richly sculpted and chased, in the recognisably English style. What had hitherto only been familiar from the literature could now be actually seen at this carefully conceived exhibition. Most of the objects belonged to the National English Silver Collection from the Victoria and Albert Museum, but the exhibition was completed by several valuable pieces loaned by other leading English museums or private collections. On 25 September 1980, while the exhibition was on, Shirley Berry, a V & A curator, gave a lecture devoted to English silverware of the 19th and 20th centuries. Likewise, a catalogue was produced containing a professional introduction, 020\n\nreproductions and a numbered list of the exhibits on display. As a reciprocal gesture, the following year saw the opening in London of the exhibition Masterpieces of Serbian Goldsmiths' Work. It was held in the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1 July to 2 August and covered a period from the 12th century to the early 18th century. There were 104 items on display, of which 45 belonged to the Museum of Applied Art, while the rest had been loaned from the treasuries of monasteries Dečani, Studenica and Banja near Priboj, and other museums all over Serbia. The exhibition was jointly opened by Roy Strong, general director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and Živan Berisavljević, Yugoslav ambassador in London. On the day the exhibition was opened, Bojana Radojković, director of the Museum of Applied Art and a recognised authority on this subject, gave a lecture on the art of Serbian goldsmiths at the Antiquarian Society in London. In order to understand the way in which the objects on show expressed the social, economic and political history of Serbia, it was necessary to take a careful look at Serbian history. A useful aid was provided by an excellent catalogue compiled by Dušan Milovanović, with a detailed historical introduction by Bojana Radojković. The reception this exhibition received among the professional and general public can best be illustrated by the fact that it was viewed by more than 20,000 visitors. Thanks to the name the Museum was acquiring over this period as a cultural institution of international repute, invitations were arriving thick and fast for the Museum to send its exhibitions to leading European and world museums. At the same time, the Museum organised major applied art events deriving from international cultural centres on its own premises. Among the many exhibitions that were sent to Europe in this period special mention should be made of the exhibition Serbian Mediaeval Treasures, which the Museum put on in Paris from 20 December 1983 to 5 February 1984.\n\nThe exhibition was opened by Louis Joxe, honorary president of the French-Yugoslav Society and Vukoje Bulatović, vice-president of the Executive Council of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. The exhibition included 270 pieces taken from the treasuries of monasteries and the depots of various museums in Serbia. On show were religious objects produced from the 6th to the 16th century – icons, wood and ceramic pieces, church tapestries and books. France showed an unusual interest in the exhibition and allotted excellent space in the Pavillon des Arts in the city's very modern commercial quarter. The show was visited by tens of thousands of people. It was the biggest exhibition of Serbian mediaeval art that had ever been prepared for showing abroad. The objects on display included the gold ring of Stefan the First-Crowned, the charter of Stefan Dečanski, and a tapestry that had been personally woven by the daughter of Prince Lazar and which she presented towards the end of her life to the monastery of Studenica, where it is still kept. These were items that up to then had never been seen outside Serbia. Accompanying the exhibition was a lavish catalogue containing 23 colour reproductions and black-and-white photographs of almost all the pieces on display. An introduction by Bojana Radojković was followed by articles by curators Dušan Milovanović, Mirjana Jevrić Lazarević, Dobrila Stojanović, Jelica Djurić, Ivanka Zorić, and Milena Vitković Žikić. The Museum was awarded the prestigious Mihajlo Valtrović prize for this exhibition. Alongside the exhibition work, efforts continued apace on collecting new items. The 200 items with which the Museum started out grew to over 20,000 by 1985. The systematic additions of certain groups of items turned these into extremely valuable collections. Alternatively, groups of objects were bought up as complete sets, as for example the collection of Coptic cloths, Gallé glass, or the collections of ancient gemstones and cameos. th As part of the Museum's 30 anniversary\n\nFig.6. The Permanent Exhibition European Applied Art from Gothic to Secesssion on the first floor, 20 March 1980.\n\nFig.7. The Permanent Collection on the second floor, 1985.\n\n021\n\ncelebrations in 1980, a permanent exhibition was opened on the first floor entitled European Applied Art from Gothic to Secession. This showed the evolution of European historical styles with objects from all the Museum's sectors presented together in a series of specially arranged showrooms on the first floor (Fig. 6). When the Museum celebrated its 35th birthday in 1985, there was a change to the permanent exhibition on the second floor. It was renewed, not only in the Museum sense, but also as regards the material on display. In the entrance section for the first time there were pre-Slav objects on show. There were also many objects from the Middle Ages that had never before been shown, as for example silver glasses from the 16th and 17th centuries. Another innovation was a contemporary section showing pieces from the period after 1945 to the present day. These included posters, tapestries, photographs and ceramics. The Museum's exhibits covered a broad time spectrum from ancient times to the latest trends in decorative art in Serbia. The objects were arranged chronologically, both individual items and whole collections, which allowed items to be presented according to period and type (Fig. 7). Museum publications provided a constant support through numerous exhibition catalogues, while the Museum curators and outside collaborators faithfully produced professional papers for the Museum's core publication – the Museum of Applied Art Journal. From 1979 to 1989, when Bojana Radojković was director, the Museum truly flourished. It was she who laid the foundations of methodical scholarship in authenticating Museum material and she improved the way in which much of the Museum's work was organised. This made it possible for the Museum to unify its activity, which in turn helped define its particular character and chart the way forward. In 1989, Mirjana Jevrić Lazarević, a longterm curator in the Sector for the Historical and Artistic Development of Furniture and Woodwork, took over as acting Museum director. In the 022\n\nshort hiatus before a new director was appointed, she fully adhered to the path laid down by her predecessor. A new director was appointed in 1990. This was Svetlana Isaković, previously a curator in the Sector for Contemporary Applied Art and a ceramics specialist. At that particular moment Serbia was hovering dangerously above the abyss of tragic historical events. Between 1992 and 1993, due to the age of the building and the impossibility of technically maintaining the exhibition rooms on the first and second floors, it was decided to dismantle the permanent exhibits. All those shining items, which only expressed the spirit of the age of their birth when placed in mutual harmony, had to be separated from each other and returned to the darkness of the Museum depots. It seemed as if the original pact struck between the outside world and the Museum had somehow been broken and, to make it even more ironic, as if that same world which had until yesterday heaped honours upon the Museum now turned its back on it. It was a time in which one picture of reality was erased. And with it went that feeling of security one feels with something that is familiar. The Museum's circumstances and realistic possibilities were turned on their head. In an effort to preserve its identity, the Museum refused to take refuge in an idealised past, but instead turned towards current artistic trends in the applied art field in Serbia. The Museum's basic concept shifted in the direction of more frequent exhibitions of contemporary applied art and design. Despite the isolation in which the country found itself, in 1996 the Museum sallied forth into the world with the exhibition Belgrade – Mirror of Europe, which represented Yugoslavia at the Triennial Exhibition of Architecture in Milan. The exhibition's commissioner was Svetlana Isaković and it was put together by Dragan Živković. From the organisation standpoint, that same year the Museum formed yet another new independent sector – the Sector for Conservation, which merged the work of the workshop for\n\nwood conservation, the restoration of period furniture, and exhibition design, the metal conservation and preparation laboratory, and the textile conservation and preparation laboratory. It was then that the Museum's in-house planning survey turned all the professional sectors into departments. During the toughest period of international sanctions, the Museum managed to bring over leading applied artists from abroad. American David Carson, one of the world's major graphic designers gave a lecture in 1997 and ran three workshops for graphic designers from Belgrade, Novi Sad and Pančevo. Carson's visit to Belgrade confirmed that the Museum continued to enjoy a considerable reputation outside the country and that our designers in no way lagged behind art trends in the world at large. That same year, Ivanka Zorić, a curator in the Department for Metal and Jewellery, founded the Jewellery Centre as part of the Department and organised a series of 8 lectures on various related topics. In 1997, the Museum incorporated a completely new happening in its exhibition programme and this soon became a traditional event. In collaboration with the Yugoslav Centre for Stage Art and Technology (YUSTAT), the Museum started up the Biennial Exhibition of Stage Design. This event, unique in its programme and structure, and not only in Serbia, aims at promoting and developing professional work in all areas connected with the design, technique and technology, production, staging and promotion of staged spectacles and cultural events in general. This particularly refers to those “invisible” skills without which no spectacle can be staged. To mark its annual Museum Day, the Museum of Applied Art opened an important study exhibition on 6 November 1998, which was entitled Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak – a Pioneer of Yugoslav Design, and organised by Sonja Vulešević, a curator in the Department for the Historical and Artistic Development of Ceramics, Porcelain,and Glass.\n\nThe Museum did not even interrupt its work in 1999. While the glass windows of the Museum galleries rattled to the detonations of the bombs raining down on Belgrade, the 22nd Architecture Salon was held on the ground floor with the slogan: They destroy, we build up. This difficult period in the life of the Museum and society as a whole came to a close with the end of the year 2000. The Museum again demonstrated its vitality by organising the exhibition Fashion in Belgrade – 1914-1941, thereby heralding the arrival of much changed times. The author of this exhibition and its accompanying catalogue, Bojan Popović, a curator in the Department for Contemporary Applied Art, was awarded the prize given by the Serbian Society of Art Historians and the Pavle Vasić prize for the most successful publication in the field of applied art and design and for the best exhibition held that year. This was an optimal way to round off 50 years of the Museum's existence and work. Despite very real problems, the Museum adhered to its mission in the last decade of the 20th century and showed itself capable of influencing quality in the production of decorative art by discovering and promoting new talents. Svetlana Isaković was Museum director at a very difficult time of truly unique circumstances and it was only possible to judge successes and failures in the life of the Museum in the light of these circumstances. In 2001, Ivanka Zorić, a curator in the Department for Metal and Jewellery, took over the directorial helm. In the face of countless problems, she applied energy and enthusiasm to meeting the challenge of strengthening the sick body of the Museum and bringing it into the modern museum world through a high level of professional practice and a systematic restructuring of all the Museum services. This would enable the Museum to meet the requirements of the time and offer services and activities based on past experience, and at the same time remain receptive to new creative ideas in contemporary art. This was a simple and logical concept, but 023\n\nit demanded time. The basis of this concept was the Museum's positive inheritance, which was to be continued and built upon so that the Museum lived on as a sophisticated cultural and educational institution with well-grounded information support. In other words, alongside the lively exhibition and publishing activity, there also had to be a revitalisation of the building itself, better planning in the hiring of new staff, the introduction of modern work methods, the application of electronic technology in communications, and better advertising. That year the Museum was declared a cultural monument and work began on its reconstruction. Step by step between 2001 and 2005, the building was reorganised from basement to attic in line with the needs and purpose of the Museum. In the basement the Jade gallery was renovated and re-opened to host exhibitions, launches, artistic performances, as well as creative workshops and lecture cycles aimed at students, professionals, and anyone else interested. Visitors could use the new the MAA Coffee Bar, which was directly linked to the Jade gallery. The workshop for the Conservation of Period Furniture and Wood underwent renovation. Thanks to a donation by the Italian government, it was fitted out with the latest machinery allowing it to undertake the most delicate conservation work. Alongside the ground floor gallery, space was adapted to house the MAA Art shop with an interior designed by architect Dušanka Savić. The choice of goods available in this shop reflected the activities of the Museum. The offices on the first, second and third floors were given a facelift and equipped with new furniture, computers and air conditioners. After 12 years, in 2004, the second-floor gallery, intended for the permanent collection, was renovated. This meant that the second floor could now be re-opened to the general public. In order to reaffirm and emphasise the importance of those pioneers of applied art in Serbia, the second-floor gallery was named Inkiostri, while 024\n\nthe first-floor gallery was christened Anastas. It should be mentioned that 2005 saw the installation of professional air-conditioning equipment in the depot of the Department for Costume and Textiles. In a desire to bring the Museum's wide range of activities closer to the public, modern methods of visual communication are used – for example, a projection panel in the entrance hall, a well-conceived and regularly updated Internet presentation, and striking TV spots. Flourishing international cooperation has been established and in this short period there have been many visiting exhibitions from abroad. Among the most important: Nemesi – a group of architects from Rome (Italy), Cecil Beaton – Dandy Photogapher (Great Britain), Interaction – Finnish art textiles, Modern Japanese Pottery, Modern Italian Silverware, Czech Theatre Puppets – History and Modernity, Design – the graphic design of Werner Jeker (Switzerland), Place: Light – Space – Material – the architecture of Mihalis Suvatsidis (Greece), POSH – the development of traditional British market brands, Modern Polish Jewellery from the Art Gallery in Legnica and Before and After an exhibition by Joachim Sokulski from Poland. In 2002 the Museum organised an exhibition from Yugoslavia to participate at the 8th Biennial Exhibition of Architecture in Venice. The exhibition, masterminded by Marina Djurdjević with curator Miloš Perović, was completed by a catalogue which in conceptual and media terms represented part of the architecture it portrayed. The aesthetic and documentary value of this catalogue accorded it an important place in our publishing world and it won an award as the best bibliographic and experimental book at the 2002 Belgrade International Book Fair, as well as first prize, the Galaxy Award, at the prestigious international festival in New York. The Serbian Chamber of Commerce likewise conferred its design prize on this catalogue, which was the brainchild of Dejan Miljković, Branko Pavić, and Dragan Janković. In February 2005, the Museum took the exhibition Contemporary Serbian Ceramics to the\n\nCeramic Art Gallery in Sydney. The objects for this exhibition were chosen by curator Biljana Vukotić from the Department for Contemporary Applied Art. The exhibition catalogue carried photographs of the objects on display with a text by Biljana Vukotić entitled New Trends in Contemporary Serbian Ceramics. Aspiring to monitor the entire historical and stylistic development of applied art and its modern tendencies, exhibitions were organised which presented material from all the professional departments in turn. So it happened that on Museum Day 2001 the themed exhibition Pirot kilims was opened. This exhibition was the work of Milena Vitković Žikić, curator in the Department for Costume and Textiles. The exhibition comprised 43 carpets and rugs from the period between 1800 and the 1950s. The Impossible – Surrealist Art 1912-1936 was an exhibition put together by Milanka Todić, one-time curator in the Department for Book Illustration, Applied Graphics and Photography, and was mounted on 6 November 2002. This exhibition was conceived as a systematic and inter-disciplinary presentation of different works by a group of Belgrade Surrealists. Besides photographs, photo collages, and photograms, there was a small number of preserved paintings, surrealist objects and ensembles, and rare books and magazines. Some of the surrealist objects had been reconstructed for the first time and shown to the public. This was also the occasion for a reprint of certain Surrealist publications: the almanach The Impossible – L'Impossible, from 1930 and the magazine Surrealism Here and Now from 1931-32. The exhibition won the coveted award of the Serbian Society of Art Historians for the best exhibition of 2002, while Milanka Todić was given the In the Steps of Isidora prize for her contribution to Serbian culture by the Plavi Jahač publishing house in Belgrade. This successful series continued into 2003 when Marijana Petrović Raić, curator in the department for Contemporary Applied Art, was\n\nawarded the Pavle Vasić prize for her catalogue and exhibition Dragoslav Stojanović Sip (19201976) – Sketch for a Portrait held in the Museum of Applied Art from 6 November 2003 till 15 January 2004. The exhibition Traces in the Wood – Furniture Decorating Techniques was opened in November 2004 to celebrate Museum Day in the newly renovated Inkiostri gallery. This exhibition also marked the introduction of specially designed sound effects in all the Museum's exhibition spaces. The author of the exhibition, Marija Bujić, a curator in the Department for Period Furniture and Wood, had conceived the exhibition in such a way that visitors could re-live the atmosphere of the past through smaller ambiental groupings. This referred to objects from the Museum's collection of period furniture from the 15th century to the first decade of the 20th century. The catalogue guide, also prepared by Marija Bujić, allowed easy access to the exhibit and a better understanding of what was on show. The broad time span encompassed by the display lent it the character of a permanent exhibit (Fig. 8). The last in this series of themed exhibitions was Preserved Time MAA, which offered timepieces from the Museum's own collections and from private sources. The\n\nFig.8. Traces in the Wood – Furniture Decoration Techniques – an ambiental collection of Biedermeier furniture.\n\n025\n\nexhibition was put on in 2005 to mark the 55th anniversary of the Museum's existence. The author of the exhibition, the catalogue introduction and the catalogue entries was Dušan Milovanović. The Museum continued its traditional activites with renewed vigour, especially in the publishing field. There are regular catalogues produced to accompany exhibitions which, thanks to the Museum's permanent designer Dušan Tkačenko, among others, are characterised by outstanding graphic design and translation into a foreign language. The first issue of a new series of the Museum of Applied Art Journal, a publication that had come out every year from 1955 to 1989, was published in 2005. The content of the Journal continues to promote theoretical papers in the field of applied art and offers a survey of the exhibitions held at the Museum. This time it also had a new look, the result of a redesigned modern appearance. There was also a new special edition of the Jewellery Almanach, a kind of anthology of lectures that had been given on this subject. Another notable publishing success in 2005 was a reprint of the Belgrade Armorial II with accompanying book. This is a very old and valuable copy of a lost collection of coats-of-arms compiled in about 1590 for the Spanish admiral Petar Grgurić Ohmučević and it represents the beginning of so-called Illyrian heraldry, in other words, the heraldry of the South Slav lands. This book occupies a special place among the Museum's publications as it was issued to th mark the 55 jubilee celebration of the Museum's foundation and it is the first time that a comprehensive survey of the Museum's activities from 1950 to 2005 has been presented. If we look back to the very beginning when the Museum only possessed about 200 works of decorative arts and crafts, which were temporarily housed in the Academy of Applied Artss, we shall see that in 55 years the Museum has grown into an important and influential\n\ninstitution with holdings of 30,717 objects of applied art. The oldest items owned by the Museum date back to the 4th century B.C. and belong to the numismatic collection (ancient Greek coins) in the Department for Metal and Jewellery, while the collections of the Department for Contemporary Applied Art closely follow state-of-the-art trends in modern design. In other words, the Museum collections trace the development of applied art objects over a period of 2,400 years. Similarly, the Museum's Centre for Printed Matter contains almost 59,000 articles on applied art, and the Photographic Centre has 37,000 negatives and as many photographs of the Museum's exhibits. A total of 756 exhibitions have been held in the Museum to date. In addition, the Museum has organised 152 exhibitions which have toured Serbia and overseas. The publishing activity of the Museum has yielded more than 300 professional publications. In 2005, the Museum Internet site was visited by a daily average of 80 people. The Museum of Applied Art has become a modern professional institution engaged in a wide range of activities. As a result, the current premises are inadequate, not only as regards the increased requirements of the Museum, but also in relation to the number and variety of objects held by the Museum. Consequently, the question of adequate new premises is almost something upon which the very survival of the Museum depends. However, there are optimistic prospects for this burning issue to be resolved in the foreseeable future thanks to the support of the Serbian Ministry of Culture and other institutions responsible for solving this problem. Such a solution would allow all those objects at present kept in the dark recesses of the depots away from public view to be brought out into the light of day. And the Museum would be well able to supply the necessary professional interpretation, presentation and affirmation of these works of applied art, which enrich the everyday material, spiritual and aesthetic reality in which we live.

Its basic holdings consisted of metal objects from the collection of painter and collector Ljuba Ivanović, including valuable pieces made of gold or carved in wood, horn, mother-ofpearl and other materials. The Department's founder and first curator was Dr. Bojana Radojković. In time the Department added new pieces through purchases, donations and legacies. Today it numbers 5,600 items dating from ancient times to the early 20th century. The exhibits are divided into two main groups, profane and sacred objects, which are further divided into collections according to their purpose and type. Apart from objects made of noble and base metals, the collections include items made of mother-of-pearl, ivory, precious and semiprecious stones, and wood. The objects mainly derive from the territory of Serbia and its neighbours, central and western Europe, with a few exhibits coming from the Near and Far East. Objects from the Department's collections were publicised not only by the Museum's experts, but also by numerous colleagues from similar institutions at home and abroad. When the Department started, Bojana Radojković and Branislav Milenković were the curators. The Metal and Jewellery Department was later managed in turn by museum adviser Dušan Milovanović, curator Mila Gajić, and senior curator Ivanka Zorić, who from 2001 became Museum director. For a short period Draginja Maskareli likewise acted as Department curator. The Jewellery Collection, in both type and number of items, is the most comprehensive\n\ncollection of jewellery in the country. It includes earrings, rings, bracelets, necklaces, pendants, medallions, pins, brooches, and ethnic jewellery, as well as fob watches, wristwatches and women's watches. The collection numbers excellent examples of mediaeval jewellery: 13th century silver earrings of a type to be found all over the Balkans (Fig. 9) and a silver signet ring with an ancient gemstone from the late 14th century (Fig. 10) which belonged to Radul, a respected citizen of Novo Brdo, site of one of Europe's most famous silver mines of the time. Another item in the collection is a 17th century Montenegrin leather belt decorated with semiprecious stones (Fig. 11), a gold bracelet with a lapis lazuli flower (Fig. 12) made in Munich in the late 19th century, and many other objects. In 1997, curator Ivanka Zorić formed the Jewellery Centre as part of the Department, where experts of different types, artists, collectors and anyone working with jewellery can meet. The Gemstones and Cameos Collection comprises gemstones and cameos, precious stones, and stones from signet rings, while the Coin Collection consists of ancient and Serbian mediaeval coins. The core of this collection is made up of items from the collection of Stanislav Simonović. The Vessels Collection consists of goblets, cups, plates, dishes, trays, cutlery, condiment sets, water or coffee pots, đugumi (pitchers), jugs, mortars, vases, candlesticks, mess kits, and metal coffee-cup holders. Part of the collection taken up by mediaeval Serbian silver dishes (Figs. 13 and 14), researched by curator Mila Gajić. The Collection also boasts one of the best objects of Islamic art in the Museum's 031\n\nDepartment for Metalwork and Jewellery, with Collections possession – a bronze candlestick bearing remains of metal inlay, which was made in Anadolia at the time of Seldžuk, between the mid-13th and early 14th century (Fig. 15). The base of the condiment set (Fig. 16) is shaped like an elephant and was made in Vienna in 1853. The Weapons Collection contains swords, sabres, scimitars, knives, daggers, dirks, maces, rifles, flintlock pistols, pistols, cartridge pouches, gunpowder horns, hunting horns and the like. Of special interest are a Byzantine sword and sabre from between 14th and 15th centuries, decorated with metal inlay showing religious inscriptions and scenes (Fig. 17), as well as a Baroque ivory hunting horn with carved scenes from the hunt and the figures of French rulers, which was made in France at the start of the 17th century (Fig. 18). The Tool Collection comprises different metal-working tools, but also tools for other purposes – devices for measuring metals, tools for threading wire, hall-marking tools, metal-threading plates, nails, hammers, needles, medical instruments, razors, and spindles. The Collection of Moulds and Applications contains all kinds of moulds: for crosses, icon frames, Book of the Gospels holders, panagia (pectoral icons), icon lamps, for all kinds of jewellery – medallions, clasps, bracelets, then moulds for vessels, weapons, etc. The Department also has a Miscellaneous Collection covering countless art objects with a wide variety of uses: a toilette set, wool baskets, a bouquet holder, boxes, cigarette cases, frames, seals, paperweights, scent sprays, locks, keys, irons, equestrian equipment, etc. The Religious Collection comprises amulets, talismans, crucifixes, phylacteries, enamelled objects, censers, incense holders, icon lamps, reliquaries, Book of the Gospels holders, metal icon frames, crosses etc, icons, panagia, diptychs, triptychs, and fragments of horos (church chandeliers). One exceptionally note-worthy piece is a green jasper cameo representing Christ Pantocrator (Ruler of All), made in Constantinople in the early 13th century (Fig. 19). A masterpiece of woodcarving from the late 17th– early 18th century must be the pectoral icon showing the Annunciation and the Holy Warriors, probably originating from Mount Athos (Fig. 23). 032\n\nThe collection also contains a 14th century bronze hand-held censer made in Janjevo – a wellknown mine and centre of artistic metalwork in Serbia (Fig. 20), then a silver censer and incenseholder, the work of Dubrovnik goldsmiths in the late 15th and early 16th century (Fig. 21), and an orarion (stole) from Dovolje monastery, which was made for the prior Mihailo by Jovan the goldsmith from Sarajevo (Fig. 24). Among the many crosses in the collection we should single out the wooden handheld cross in a silver frame fashioned in the workshops of Herzegovina between the 16th and 17th centuries (Fig. 22). From its earliest days the Department developed both exhibition and publishing activity. Bojana Radojković mounted a series of important exhibitions including Artistic Metalwork (Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade 1953/1954); Jewellery with the Serbs (Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade 1969/1970); and Small Objects in Relief in Ancient Serbian Art (Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade 1976/77). At the same time as the exhibition Jewellery with the Serbs 12th – 20th Century, Bojana Radojković also published her doctoral thesis entitled Jewellery with the Serbs from the late 12th to the late 18th Century (Belgrade 1969). Together with a team of experts from the former Yugoslavia, she participated in putting together an exhibition of representative metal objects from museum collections and treasuries – Artistic Metalwork of the Yugoslav Peoples through the Centuries, (Museum für Angewandte Kunst, Vienna 1955; Landesmuseum Joanneum, Graz 1955; Landesmuseum, Klagenfurt 1955; and the Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade 1956/57). She likewise published an extensive study Serbian Goldsmiths' Art of the 16th and 17th Centuries (Novi Sad 1966) and she spearheaded the project History of Applied Art with the Serbs, Volume 1, Mediaeval Serbia (Belgrade 1977) Dušan Milovanović, Department curator, from 1977, was a member of the Museum team that collaborated with the Chilandar Board of SANU (Serbian Academy of Science and Art) on protecting the movable applied art treasures from Chilandar Monastery. The exhibition of Serbian goldsmiths' work (conceived by Bojana Radojković and arranged by Dušan Milovanović) was on show at London's famous Victoria & Albert Museum in London 1981 (Masterpieces of Serbian Goldsmiths'\n\nDepartment for Metalwork and Jewellery, with Collections Work 13th – 18th Century); and as Serbian Goldsmiths' Art, at the Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade 1981; Národní Muzeum, Prague 1981; and National Museum, Kragujevac 1981. Bojana Radojković also wrote the introduction to the catalogue for the exhibition of Serbian mediaeval art shown in Paris in 1983/84 (Trésors de l'art serbe médiéval: XIIe–XVIe siècle, Pavillon des Arts). With other experts from the Museum, Dušan Milovanović took part in mounting this major exhibition, and a second one entitled 19th Century Serbian Art (Künstlerhaus, Graz 1985; Castello di San Giusto, Trieste 1985; the National Museum, Ljubljana 1985; and the Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade 1985). Dušan Milovanović organised the following study exhibitions: Metal Work in Serbia (Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade 1985/86) and Crosses from the 5th Century to 1993 (Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade 1993/94; National Museum, Kruševac 1994; Palace of Culture, Vrnjačka Banja 1994; National Museum, Smederevska Palanka 1994; Paraćin 2001), as well as a representative exhibition of clocks from the Museum and private collections entitled Preserved Time MAA (Museum of Applied Art , Belgrade 2005). Ivanka Zorić put on a project exhibition Silverware in 19th Century Serbia (Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade 1990/91), and a well-received exhibition called Stone from the Nature’s: Gea magica Imagination (Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade 1994), which displayed not only items from the Museum, but also various geological specimens in cooperation with collectors. The Department collections incorporate objects from the legacies of Milica Zorić and Rodoljub Čolaković, Stanislav Simonović, Irina Simić, Ljubomir M. Lešjanin, Jovica Barlovac, Ana Fabik Kostić, Magdalena Pavlović and Velimir Todorović, as well as objects bequested by Belgrade goldsmith Vasily K. Isayev and engineer Đorđe Roš.

Dušan Milovanović, Museum Adviser Draginja Maskareli, Curator\n\n033\n\nDepartment for Metalwork and Jewellery, with Collections\n\nEarrings\n\nFound in the surroundings of Skopje, 13th century Cast silver, pseudo-filigree, filigree, granulation Diameter 5.5 cm MAA inv.no.155 These 13th century silver earrings are of the 3-strawberry type to be found all over the Balkans. They are shaped like a hoop and the lower part has a pronounced central strawberry. Where the two halves of the central strawberry join there is a twisted wire, and right and left are two rows of granules, an inner one made up of small granules, and an outer one of larger granules. At the lateral ends of the central strawberry are two rows of larger granules. Left and right of the central strawberry there are two smaller ones, comprising pressed granules shaped like little wheels. Between the central and lateral strawberry the hoop is fashioned like a rope. The upper part of the hoop is plain. In the Middle Ages, earrings were a very widespread form of jewellery, especially in Byzantium and countries in the Byzantine sphere of cultural influence. They became a favourite form of adorment, not only among the ruling and landowning classes, but also among the common people. They were worn both by men and women, and in addition to serving as a decoration, they also had a magical character, for it was believed that they warded off evil. The decoration on these earrings is typical of the type with three strawberries. Unlike rings, which were frequently embellished with symbols of a magical character, the decoration on earrings was mainly reduced to pure ornamentation. They were worn in the ears or hanging from a scarf (or chain) at about ear level. The hoop was the usual shape for earrings and in time it acquired different decorative additions. These earrings also belong to the Ljuba Ivanović collection, but similar pairs can be found in museums in Belgrade, Vršac, Zaječar, Pirot, Vienna, Zagreb, Sarajevo, Skopje, Sofia, Split and elsewhere. 034\n\nSelected literature: M.
