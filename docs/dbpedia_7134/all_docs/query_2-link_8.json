        "text": "Health of a community is an indicator of its overall well-being. Moreover, health of a community provides an insight in the society that community lives in. The data about the health condition of Roma in Serbia (life expectancy, prevalence of certain diseases that cause death of the members of the community, infant mortality rate, etc.) compared with the data about the general population’s health indicate that Roma are in a particularly vulnerable position. The Open Society Foundation Serbia (OSFS), within the Decade of Roma Inclusion, supported a number of projects which holistically treated the issue of Roma integration. The OSFS also supported projects of civil society organizations (implemented individually by those organizations or in partnership with the state) that aimed at advancing the health of Roma individuals and the Roma community at large. This publication offers a review of topics and strategies of the projects the OSFS supported so far, and which were implemented by civil society organizations (individually or in collaboration with state institutions) for the sake of improving Roma health in Serbia. The aim of this review is to reflect on the issues we dealt with, to gain an understanding how successful we were, and to try to answer to what extent the initiatives we supported got mainstreamed into long-term sustainable solutions that lead towards improvement of Roma health. Furthermore, the purpose of this review is to serve as a reference (or testimony) for future Roma health-related policy making endeavors, i.e. to be a source of information for future activities of state institutions, civil society and donors.\n\nBreaking the Glass Ceiling: The Case of the Roma Ethnic Minority in Slovenia Slovenia has a rather comprehensive legal framework and specific implementing policies to regulate Roma issues. Nevertheless, the improvement of the standard of living of the Roma can only be measured in incremental units. A similar finding also applies to education. So, what went wrong? Roma pupils enter primary school without the adequate prior knowledge required in Slovene schools. Thus, they simultaneously need to fill their educational gaps and gain new knowledge. A solution thereto is to be provided by the school. The latter is thus burdened with excessive responsibility and obligations as regards ensuring the development of the Roma minority, i.e. it is entrusted with tasks it is unable to perform. The basic hypothesis of this paper is that preschool education and various forms of non-formal education implemented (if possible) in Roma settlements lead to an increase in the human and social capital of...\n\nOn 31 March 2003, the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina passed minority rights legislation. This article reviews its main provisions and critically asks: to what extent does this law meet international and European standards? How effective will this law be in addressing the socio-economic and political crisis facing the TOPICAL RESEARCH DIGEST: HUMAN RIGHTS IN RUSSIA AND THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS 104 Roma minority today? Apart from granting minority status to the Roma, a right they had enjoyed under the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution, this article concludes that the new law offers little by way of additional protections beyond those already available, albeit under-utilized, under the Dayton Peace Agreement and the State and Entity Constitutions. It further notes that the limited nature of minority rights legislation to cultural, linguistic and religious rights means that it fails to address many of the critical issues facing the Roma today, such as illiteracy, poverty, widespread d..."
