        "text": "Now how could I have known that when I picked his book for day 23 of our Picture Book Month Project that the weather outside would be VERY rainy, windy and generally miserable.\n\nEnter selection 23….Stella, Star of the Sea by Marie Louise Gay.\n\nThis book is also available in French\n\n“Where do starfish come from?” asked Sam.\n\n“From the sky,” answered Stella. “Starfish are shooting stars that fell in love with the sea.”\n\n“Weren’t the stars afraid of drowning?” asked Sam.\n\n“No,” said Stella. “They all learned how to swim.”\n\n― Marie-Louise Gay, Stella, Star of the Sea\n\nWinner of the Ruth Schwartz Award\n\nStella and her little brother are spending the day at the sea. Stella has been to the sea before and knows all its secrets, but Sam has many questions: “Does a catfish purr? Does a seahorse gallop?” Stella has an answer for them all. The only thing she isn’t sure of, and neither are we, is whether Sam will ever come into the water.\n\nExquisite, evocative watercolors bring a diaphanous day at the beach alive in this perfect summer story. Gently humorous, Stella, Star of the Sea also captures the relationship between an older sister and her baby brother — a responsibility that can be both lots of fun and very trying.\n\nSeries Title: Stella and Sam\n\n32 Pages\n\nISBN 9780888993373\n\nReading age from 2 to 5\n\nSource – http://houseofanansi.com/products/stella-star-of-the-sea\n\nThis book was also named to the Today’s Parent 100 Best Canadian Kids’ Books of All Time [ http://www.todaysparent.com/family/activities/top-100-canadian-kids-books/image/4/ ]\n\nIf you LOVED this book as much as we did ( it really made us want to be at the beach and play with the sand and in the water) you might want to check out the other Stella & Sam books.\n\nStella series\n\nStella, Star of the Sea (1999)\n\nStella, Queen of the Snow (2000)\n\nStella, Fairy of the Forest (2002)\n\nStella, Princess of the Sky (2004)\n\nWhen Stella Was Very, Very, Small (2009)\n\nRead Me A Story, Stella (2013)\n\nSam series\n\nSam is Stella’s younger brother\n\nGood Morning, Sam (2003)\n\nGood Night, Sam (2003)\n\nWhat Are You Doing, Sam?

We LOVE the beach, and today the weather is very dreary, so this ‘music video’ perked us up. Hope it does that to you as well.\n\nThis song is featured on Juno Award winning The Stella and Sam Album, Featuring Emilie Mover! http://cdbaby.com/cd/emiliemover1\n\nAbout the Author –\n\nMarie-Louise Gay is a world-renowned author and illustrator of children’s books.

Even though Girl forgot to make a door, the three toy animals think their home is perfect. The only thing that isn’t perfect is Dog. He lives outside, but his drool makes it feel as if it’s raining in the barn.\n\nOne day, Pig and Chicken decide to go exploring, leaving Cow behind. Before long, Cow hears a drooly, snorty sort of sound, followed by a crash as the barn tips over. Dog is very big, and Cow is terrified—but she really has nothing to fear. All Dog wants to do is play, as Pig and Chicken discover during a daring rescue. Dog becomes a friend. Best of all, now that two sticks have been knocked free, their barn is indeed perfect—front door and all.\n\nWith her trademark economy of words and expressive characters, Ruth Ohi has created a refreshing, toddler-friendly story about making friends.\n\nFirst and Best List, Toronto Public Library\n\nBest Books for Family Literacy, Pennsylvania Center for the Book Best Bets List\n\nOntario Library Association Great Books\n\nCanadian Toy Testing Council 100 Best Canadian Kids’ Books [ http://www.thestar.com/life/parent/2009/11/16/toytesting_council_names_top_picks_for_2010.html ]\n\nToday’s Parent Magazine New York City Reads 365 List Best Books for Kids & Teens\n\nCanadian Children’s Book Centre Canadian Children’s Book Centre Awards finalist\n\nInterest Age 2 – 5 ( Grade PreK – K )\n\n9 x 9, 32 Pages, 2008\n\nGuided Reading Level:\n\nFountas and Pinnell I\n\nPicture Book\n\nThemes\n\nfriendship; animals; problem solving; community\n\nSource -http://www.annickpress.com/Chicken-Pig-Cow\n\nNeedless to say this book is a big hit in the house.

We also really enjoyed watching her draw at the end.\n\nHopefully you are like us, and you like to do some fun crafty activities, Ruth has a Pinterest Board connected to Chicken, Pig, Cow. You can find it here…\n\nKaelyn’s Book Club also has Ruth Ohi board with some great Chicken, Pig, Cow activities and some Pins related to a few of her other books.\n\nAbout Ruth Ohi\n\nRuth is the illustrator of over 50 books (17 of which she is also the author).

It will make a terrific nutcracker too! There are oodles of uses for a dinosaur — from a fine umbrella to an excellent kite and a dandy pillow, not to mention a reliable burglar alarm and the perfect excuse to forget your homework. This delightfully absurd exploration of the domestic uses of dinosaurs — and the things dinos just aren’t good for at all — is guaranteed to tickle funny bones and spark imaginations. If you read carefully, you’ll learn how to make your dinosaur last a very long time.\n\nImprint:Tundra Books\n\nFormat: Hardcover\n\nPub Date: May 2014\n\nAge: 3-7 years\n\nTrim Size: 10-1/2 x 10-1/2\n\n# of Pages: 40 pages\n\nISBN: 978-1-77049-568-5 (1-77049-568-1)\n\nSource -http://www.tundrabooks.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781770495685\n\nNow this is not my favorite YouTube Read Aloud I have found in the last couple weeks, but you do get to hear the story, so here we go…..\n\nBesides it being Day 18 for our Picture Book Month Project, it was also Book Club Monthly Meet-Up day. So we took our Read Aloud on the road, and added it into our books read during Book Club.\n\nWe’ve read this book a few times, and everytime we do get quite a kick out of the illustrations and some of the things these dinosaurs are doing. Babysitting dinosaurs…..ummmmm….still not sure that there is a good one for that, but ok!\n\nAbout the Author –\n\nAward-winning author LINDA BAILEY has written more than twenty books for children in a number of different genres, including the best-selling Stanley-the-dog series, The Farm Team, the Stevie Diamond Mysteries, the Good Times Travel Agency series, and most recently, Toads on Toast, also illustrated by Colin Jack.

I have requested it through an inter-library loan process, and just waiting. … … … I promise to update, as soon as we get our little hands on the book, and can READ it!!\n\nHere’s an extended blog post from JacketFlap talking about the book (and their post includes pictures), http://www.jacketflap.com/megablog/?postid=1396677\n\n**Please if you have read this book, feel free to leave some comments for us.**\n\nIn this clever picture book, six different shapes attend Shapeston Elementary School along with the children: Triangle, Square, Circle, Rectangle, Rhombus (or “Diamond” to her friends) and Oval. As the story begins, the big news at school is the upcoming play. Everyone is looking forward to auditioning, especially the shapes. One by one they are introduced, with descriptions of their unique personalities and interests, along with the roles they’ve played before (Triangle as a tortilla chip, Oval as a skating rink, Diamond as a kite and the like). Happily, after all the wonderful auditions, the drama teacher decides everyone gets to be in the play!\n\nThis fresh and playful idea for a concept book, written and illustrated by Tania Howells, makes shapes and early geometry fun. Each shape gets its own two-page spread. On the left is a large picture of the shape, with a simple and expressive face and limbs set in a jaunty pose, along with the explanatory text. On the right are boxes containing smaller illustrations of objects made out of the shape. The art, simply drawn in bright, bold colors, is charming and engaging. These spreads could easily work on their own for a lesson on shapes, and the book could be used to spark a variety of “I spy” activities with young children, in the classroom, in the playground or anywhere out in the world. Also, the ending spread showing the play’s performance offers a terrific opportunity to search for the different shapes on the stage.\n\nHere’s how the author/illustrator talks about this book on her blog (dated May 2015),\n\nhttp://tania.blogs.com/tania/2015/05/starring-shapes.html\n\nAbout Tania Howells –\n\nYou must check out her Biography on her blog. LOVE IT!!! http://www.taniahowells.com/tania4.html\n\nTania lives in Toronto with her husband and son, Finch. She graduated from the Ontario College of Art and Design in 1997 and has been a freelance illustrator for 15 years.

She is currently a stay-at-home mum, and after bedtime, she works on her drawings. In another life, Tania might like to be a fabric designer, a librarian or even a small-town cafe owner. She sometimes has trouble saying things out loud, just like Willow. She likes coffee and tea, walks, reading books, daydreaming and baking things.

Starring Shapes! is a very colourful book, however I seem to have a bit of a Love – Hate relationship with it.\n\nWhat I LOVE about this book is the colour. The illustrations are fun, and bright, and we loved them.\n\nWhat has me on the hate side is the text. We found it pretty wordy. And although my little book queen reads a lot of book above her age, she just couldn’t get into this one. (we tried several times).\n\nProbably best for the older kids, but the pictures are fun, and you can probably make up your own fabulous stories with these pictures if your little ones are interested in the actual text.\n\nWelcome to Day 11 of READ SHARE CELEBRATE.\n\nToday as we are celebrating Remembrance Day in Canada, we have selected….\n\nA Poppy is to Remember [ Un Coquelicot Pour Se Souvenir ] by Heather Patterson and Illustrated by Ron Lightburn\n\nHow did the bright red poppy that we all wear in November become Canada’s symbol of honouring those who fought for our freedom on Remembrance Day?\n\nMoving text coupled with stunning illustrations by Governor General’s Award-winning artist Ron Lightburn explain the symbolism behind the poppy.\n\nA bonus for teachers is the five-page spread all about the poem, “In Flanders Fields,” Canada’s wartime and peacekeeping endeavours, and the adoption of the poppy as our Remembrance Day emblem.\n\nScholastic Canada Ltd | ISBN 9780545999816 Paperback\n\n32 Pages | 8.04″ x 10″ | Ages 6 to 8\n\nScholastic Canada Ltd | ISBN 9780439967860 Hardcover\n\n32 Pages | 8.34″ x 10.3″ | Ages 6 to 8\n\nSource – http://www.scholastic.ca/books/view/a-poppy-is-to-remember\n\nI absolutely think this is a Fabulous books for ALL ages. We will be taking this out for a special Family Read Aloud each Remembrance Day going forward.\n\nBefore we received our copy of the book, we read it at one of our many visits to our Local Library. They had some great Remembrance Day Colouring Sheets. So while I read the book to my daughter, she worked very diligently in colouring.\n\nNow for those of you who have not yet had the opportunity to read this book, I found this video online while doing some book research. It was posted last year from the Grade 4-5 class of Williamstown Public School, South Glengarry, Ont. And I think it’s fabulous. The students read the book aloud (English and French translations) and it’s so great to hear.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/-CQzmv5u_4c“>http://\n\nThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:\n\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\n\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning\n\nWe will remember them.\n\nSource – For The Fallen by Robert Laurence Binyon [ http://www.greatwar.co.uk/poems/laurence-binyon-for-the-fallen.htm ]\n\nVery last thing, I promise.

Dreamtime is another book that we have yet to read. I have placed a hold on the book from the library, and the last I checked it was in transit (hopefully to me).\n\n** I will update this post as soon as we have the book in hand and Read it Aloud!! **\n\nUntil then….\n\nThe soothing rhythms and sounds of the words of this story will work their magic on children at bedtime. Written by award-winning author Deirdre Kessler and illustrated by the talented young artist Christina Patterson, this book evokes a quiet nighttime in Prince Edward Island–a perfect going-to-bed story. Dreamtimeis sure to be a classic of the 21st century.\n\nProduct Details\n\nHardcover: 24 pages\n\nPublisher: Acorn Press; 01 edition (Oct. 31 2011)\n\nLanguage: English\n\nISBN-10: 1894838645\n\nISBN-13: 978-1894838641\n\nProduct Dimensions: 18.4 x 0.6 x 18.4 cm\n\nSource – http://www.amazon.ca/Dreamtime-Deirdre-Kessler/dp/1894838645\n\nDreamtime by Deirdre Kessler, illustrations by Christina Patterson (Acorn Press, 20 pages, ages four and under, $15.95)\n\nDreamtime is a perfect bedtime story book, with a rhyming text as soft, warm and lovely as a down comforter.\n\n“And birds begin to whisper — their day’s last song is sung.

Illustrator Christina Patterson also lives on P.E.I., and their words and pictures together evoke a quiet and lovely dusk that fades to nighttime on the island.\n\nPatterson’s charming oil illustrations are both vivid and soothing.

We both really like the colourful illustrations, but I found myself disappointed with the text.\n\nTypically a Picture book has 32 pages (that’s not to say that some have don’t have a few more, and some have less). This book has 24 pages. I just found that by the time we got to the end of the book there was a feeling that I had missed something, or that it just ended too soon.\n\nWondering your opinion….\n\nHave you an opportunity to read this book?\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nWelcome to Day 9 of READ SHARE CELEBRATE.\n\nAgain today we have 2 different book choices. One English, One French.\n\nStep Outside by Doretta Groenendyk\n\nMes grands freres et moi de Cary Fagan et Luc Melanson ( https://kaelynsbookclub.wordpress.com/2015/11/09/mes-grands-freres-et-moi-de-cary-fagan-et-luc-melanson-lire-partage-celebrer-9-jours-selection-francaise/ )\n\nSo we decided to take the title of the book to heart, and we went outside, and enjoyed an absolutely LOVELY November day in Nova Scotia. I’ll share some more pictures from our walk a little further down.\n\nToday’s book is written by a Local Nova Scotia Author, Doretta Groenendyk. I was actually first introduced to her because of her art. Her Whimsical and brightly coloured images immediately drew me in. I loved how fun they were, and how they were appealing to so many people. Little Kids, and Big kids!!\n\nThis book, although fun, does have a bit of a serious message that we could all think about.\n\nDoretta Groenendyk’s new book, Step Outside, promotes the valuable goal of relating to each other and the natural environment in a creative and enchanted way. Childhood obesity and the addiction to electronics is a growing concern that needs to be addressed. Step Outside is an artistic approach to inspire movement, to strengthen family bonds, to generate memories and celebrate the outdoors. It also visually enriches the readers repetoire with enticing, original, collaged, watercolour and acrylic creations within a moment of words. A beautiful combination of sport, art, poetry, nature and family, Step Outside, is sure to get you off your chair and enjoying the outdoors.\n\nSource – http://www.nimbus.ca/Step-Outside-P6721.aspx\n\nProduct Details\n\nAge Range: 4 – 8 years\n\nGrade Level: Preschool – 3\n\nHardcover: 24 pages\n\nPublisher: Acorn Press (March 15, 2014)\n\nLanguage: English\n\nISBN-10: 1927502195\n\nISBN-13: 978-1927502198\n\nProduct Dimensions: 8 x 10 inches\n\nAbout Doretta Groenendyk –\n\nThe fantastical whimsy of Doretta Groenendyk\n\nby Wendi Stewart, Herald Annapolis Valley (published\n\nThis season, like no other season, is a time of magic no matter your religious or political affiliation, or lack thereof. If you are seeking something whimsical to adorn your wall, to awaken the sleeping child in you, something to be cherished as a family treasure, then you must consider the art of Doretta Groenendyk.\n\nGroenendyk is no stranger to the residents of the Annapolis Valley. A bit of serendipity brought Groenendyk and her husband David Fitch to the Valley 17 years ago to a rural landscape below the North Mountain within reach of Canning, on a road that is the last to see the snowplow when winter raises her stormy fist. There, at her kitchen table with her three children — Izra, Reilly and Jasper — all armed with sketchbooks, acrylics and assorted drawing implements with the cats (Lulu, Nutnut and Poppy) looking on in a supervisory role, Groenendyk creates her magic.\n\nShe is a prolific artist, finding inspiration in stories that flow in and around and through her life. Groenendyk studied at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax and has a degree in art education, a calling that has taken her into the classrooms of Africa, Canada’s Arctic and now in her own community. She has written and illustrated several children’s books, employing the participation of her children’s talent in many of her works. Her art definitely is a family affair, her creative talent being genetically passed down to her children.\n\nThe creation of her books, Bully 101 and Step Outside, was supported by grants in 2012 and 2013 respectively, from Culture and Heritage, Nova Scotia Department of Communities and she enjoys and is grateful for the support of Valley residents. These communities are “inspiring to an artistic mind,” Groenendyk proclaims, and she credits her success with the support of the collective Valley community.\n\nAside of illustrating her own children’s books and illustrating the literary endeavours of others, Groenendyk creates custom pieces for individuals seeking a personal piece of art to tell his/her story, a collaborative effort to visually display a narrative. (Find her work at www.doretta-art.com).\n\nGroenendyk work is exhibited at the Harvest Gallery in Wolfville, and in the Art Sales and Rental Gallery of Nova Scotia in Halifax, at Details Past and Present Art Gallery in Charlottetown, and in the Fireside Café in Canning. Her illustrated Christmas cards have been supportive of Light 4 Learning for the past eight years, a project created to raise funds to purchase solar power for schools in rural Uganda in East Africa (www.light4learning.org).\n\nWhen you come across a Doretta Groenendyk piece, look for the birds or goldfish on the canvas, her signature inclusions that speak to her whimsy, the bits of life that assure her she is never truly alone, that tell a little extra story. Be assured, you will enjoy the fantastical colours, the very seed of Groenendyk‘s creations.\n\nSource – http://thechronicleherald.ca/community/annapolis-valley/1175689-the-fantastical-whimsy-of-doretta-groenendyk\n\nIf you are looking at this picture and wondering what the blue box is on the left.
