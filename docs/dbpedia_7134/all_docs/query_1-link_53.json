        "text": "Our 18th Selection on the Read Share Celebrate – Picture Book Month list is…..\n\nIf You Happen To Have A Dinosaur by Linda Bailey and Illustrated by Colin Jack.\n\nFrench Title, Si Jamais Tu Avais Un Dinosaure…\n\nABOUT THIS BOOK\n\nIf you happen to have a dinosaur, lying around your living room, and you don’t know what to do with it … why don’t you use it as a can opener? It will make a terrific nutcracker too! There are oodles of uses for a dinosaur — from a fine umbrella to an excellent kite and a dandy pillow, not to mention a reliable burglar alarm and the perfect excuse to forget your homework. This delightfully absurd exploration of the domestic uses of dinosaurs — and the things dinos just aren’t good for at all — is guaranteed to tickle funny bones and spark imaginations. If you read carefully, you’ll learn how to make your dinosaur last a very long time.\n\nImprint:Tundra Books\n\nFormat: Hardcover\n\nPub Date: May 2014\n\nAge: 3-7 years\n\nTrim Size: 10-1/2 x 10-1/2\n\n# of Pages: 40 pages\n\nISBN: 978-1-77049-568-5 (1-77049-568-1)\n\nSource -http://www.tundrabooks.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781770495685\n\nNow this is not my favorite YouTube Read Aloud I have found in the last couple weeks, but you do get to hear the story, so here we go…..\n\nBesides it being Day 18 for our Picture Book Month Project, it was also Book Club Monthly Meet-Up day. So we took our Read Aloud on the road, and added it into our books read during Book Club.\n\nWe’ve read this book a few times, and everytime we do get quite a kick out of the illustrations and some of the things these dinosaurs are doing. Babysitting dinosaurs…..ummmmm….still not sure that there is a good one for that, but ok!\n\nAbout the Author –\n\nAward-winning author LINDA BAILEY has written more than twenty books for children in a number of different genres, including the best-selling Stanley-the-dog series, The Farm Team, the Stevie Diamond Mysteries, the Good Times Travel Agency series, and most recently, Toads on Toast, also illustrated by Colin Jack. Known for her wonderful sense of humor, evident in almost all her stories, Linda has garnered a long list of honors in both Canada and the United States such as the Ontario Blue Spruce Award, the Atlantic Provinces Hackmatack Award, the Arthur Ellis Award (Crime Writers of Canada), the California Young Reader Medal, and the Georgia Storybook Award.\n\nSource – http://www.tundrabooks.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=978177049568\n\nFor more information on Linda Bailey and her other books, check out her website, http://www.lindabaileybooks.com/home.html\n\nAbout the Illustrator\n\nCOLIN JACK is the incredibly talented illustrator of several books for children including the Galaxy Zack series, Toads on Toast and 1 Zany Zoo. He also works as a story artist and character designer at Dreamworks, and has been involved in such productions as Hotel Transylvania, Grossology and Ed, Edd n Eddy.\n\nSource – http://www.tundrabooks.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=978177049568\n\nColin also has a great blog, http://jackomtablet.blogspot.ca/ and Tumblr page, http://colinjack.tumblr.com/ where you can check out some of his other illustrations.\n\nLet us know what you think of If You Happen To Have A Dinosaur…\n\nWe’re going pretty digital for our 17th selection of Read Share Celebrate for Picture Book Month.\n\nBearcub and Mama by Sharon Jennings, Illustrated by Melanie Watt is another book I have requested from the library. The great news is that like the books on my list they are ALL available for borrowing through the library, this one however is not available at my Local Library, so the InterLibrary Loan program is AWESOME, just a bit slower. Until we get the physical book in hand, I was able to find a Read Aloud on YouTube by Arwen Sharp.\n\nWhat did we do next…we we snuggled up on the couch, of course and, and watched the story.\n\nIf you haven’t read this book, here’s the YouTube link so you can do what we did….\n\nBearcub follows his mama wherever she goes. By Mama’s side, he discovers how to catch a fish and dig for grubs. With Mama’s help, he learns to climb a tree and find honey. One day, Bearcub is exploring the high country when the sky darkens and a storm blows in. But this time, Mama is not there. Frightened and alone, Bearcub must rely on himself — and all that his mama has taught him — to weather the fierce winter storm.\n\nTold in simple, evocative language and illustrated in rich, luminous colors, Bearcub and Mama is a reassuring story about growing up and the powerful bond between mother and child.\n\nReviews\n\n“Preschoolers will find the heartwarming story reassuring and comforting.”\n\n“The enduring relationship between mother and child is mirrored through Bearcub and Mama. Little ones will identify with Bearcub as he develops new skills and learns how to accept separation despite the fears it causes. … The soft-edged acrylic artwork mirrors the colors of the seasons.”\n\nAwards\n\n2006 – Amelia Frances Howard-Gibbon Award, Short-listed\n\n2006 – Marilyn Baillie Picture Book Award, Canadian Children’s Book Centre, Short-listed\n\n2006 – Teacher’s Choices Project, International Reading Association, Winner\n\n2005 – Book of the Year, ForeWord Magazine, Winner\n\nEven though we didn’t have the physical book in hand it was so nice to snuggle up with my little ‘bearcub’ and follow along with this read aloud. There was a few snow flurries falling out the living room window, so that’s another good reason to snuggle up.\n\nWe hope you enjoy reading/watching this story with your little ones too.\n\nThis book has also been translated into French. Ainsi font les oursons\n\nAbout the Author –\n\nSharon Jennings grew up in Toronto writing, directing and starring in plays for the backyard. She went to university and got a master’s degree in English so that she could spend many years doing not much more than reading books. Then she found work as an editor where she could spend lots of time reading other people’s stories. Sharon didn’t figure out that she wanted to write her own stories until she had a child. After her first book was published (Jeremiah and Mrs. Ming), Sharon had a couple more kids and published a lot more books. Mostly, her three children were her inspiration for all of her writing, so when they grew up, Sharon was very happy when one of them brought home a puppy. The “puppy” is now 110 pounds, but she earns her keep by giving Sharon lots more ideas. Sharon followed the old rule to “write what you know” — she now knows lots about dogs — but then she added in a dollop of imagination and wrote C’mere Boy — a story about a dog that really, really, really wants a boy.\n\nWhen she isn’t writing or walking her dog, Sharon likes to cook, run and talk to children and adults about writing. And she has never stopped reading.\n\nSource – http://www.kidscanpress.com/creators/sharon-jennings/553\n\nIf you want more information about Sharon or her other books check out her website, http://sharonjennings.ca/ or on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/sharoneileenjennings?_rdr=p\n\nAbout the Illustrator –\n\nIt was in a design class taught by Michèle Lemieux at the University of Quebec in Montreal that author and illustrator Mélanie Watt created her first picture book, Leon the Chameleon, which was later published by Kids Can Press. Watt went on to create several more books, including the Learning with Animals collection and Augustine, which was named an ALA Notable Children’s Book. Watt has also illustrated Where Does a Tiger-Heron Spend the Night? and Bearcub and Mama, which won the 2006 IRA Teachers’ Choices Project.\n\nMélanie’s best known book Scaredy Squirrel, has won many awards including the Ruth and Sylvia Schwartz Children’s Book Award for Children’s Picture Book and the Amelia Frances Howard-Gibbon Illustrator’s Award. The release of Scaredy Squirrel Makes a Friend, was met with enthusiastic reviews and incredible sales, confirming the arrival of kid lit’s newest superstar.\n\nChester,Chester’s Back! and Chester’s Masterpiece are about a megalomaniac cat who is every bit the antithesis to Scaredy. Chester has already become a bestseller and shows the breadth and creativity of Mélanie Watt.\n\nScaredy returns to take a few more tentative steps out of his comfort zone in Scaredy Squirrel at the Beach and Scaredy Squirrel at Night. Mélanie has often noted how the Scaredy Squirrel books helped her work out her own insecurities and fears, as the success of these titles has required her to venture out into the unknown, and like Scaredy she has found the experience truly uplifting.\n\nMélanie currently resides near Montreal, Quebec.\n\nSource -http://www.kidscanpress.com/creators/m%C3%A9lanie-watt/223\n\nIn a few days we have selected on of Melanie’s Chester books as our Picture Book of the day, so stay tuned for that. Until then if you want to find out more about her other books check out – http://melaniewatt.blogspot.ca/ or http://www.scaredysquirrel.com/\n\nUntil tomorrow, enjoy your Picture Books, and Read Aloud time with your Little Ones (or Big Ones). Family Storytime is Important!!\n\nWelcome to Day 16 of Picture Book Month.\n\n**Sorry I am finding myself a bit behind on my selected 30 days of books. Running after a 2 year old doesn`t always allow for enough time in the day to get done everything that I have been wanting to do. Don`t worry we will get through all 30 books. Can`t wait to keep sharing**\n\nOur Selection today is A Cat in a Kayak by Maria Coffey, and Illustrated by Eugenie Fernandez.\n\nWe really have enjoyed reading this story about a cat who goes to live with a man, and then the house is filled with other `creatures.` There is a lot of this story that makes it very easy to relate to.\n\nWhen Victor takes in Teelo the cat, the feline isn’t thrilled about the voyage across the harbor. After all, a cat in a kayak is like a fish out of water. But when they arrive at the little house on Cloud Island, Teelo discovers it’s the perfect place for a calm-loving cat. Perfect, that is, until Teelo’s spot by the stove is usurped by some chickens. Worse, his cozy cushion is eaten when Terry the terrier moves in. Even the roof isn’t safe — Victor’s new parrot can .y up there with ease.\n\nSuddenly a cat in a kayak seems a decent idea…until Victor paddles out to Thunder Rock, a voyage of walloping waves, screeching seabirds, and overexcited orcas. Upon returning home, Teelo decides the crowded little house is the perfect place for him after all.\n\nThis charming tale reminds us that things could always be worse. Set amid vibrant coastal landscapes, and crawling with friendly critters of all kinds, it’s easy to see why A Cat in a Kayak has become a family favorite.\n\nI guess she needed to have some of her kitties around her when she read this book today.\n\nAbout the Author –\n\nMaria Coffey\n\nWhen growing up in Wolverhampton, England, Maria Coffey’s favorite books were Enid Blyton’s Famous Five series. Desperate to have adventures of her own, she and a few friends formed a Famous Four club. They spent hours dreaming about wild escapades, but it was a few years before her life began to get really exciting.\n\nWhile studying for a degree in geography at the University of Liverpool, she would spend summer vacations traveling and working abroad, in Greece, Italy, Israel, Morocco, France, Sweden and Russia. After graduating, Maria went to South America for a year, taught English as a Foreign Language in Peru, and traveled through Bolivia, Argentina and Patagonia.\n\nEventually, Maria returned to England and settled into a teaching job for a while. Looking for a change, Maria moved to Canada, gave up teaching and began writing. Then she met her future husband, Dag. With Dag, Maria began having adventures that the Famous Five would have been proud of.\n\nMaria’s first children’s book, A Cat in a Kayak (originally published in 1998 and reissued in 2005), is the tale of Teelo the Cat, who finds a kayak-accessible home on Cloud Island. A Seal in the Family (1999), Teelo’s next adventure, recounts what happens when he finds an abandoned seal pup on the shores of Cloud Island. The third title in the adventures of Teelo, A Cat Adrift (2002), tells of Teelo’s rescue from the stormy ocean by a young girl and her grandfather in their wooden sailboat.\n\nMaria has written articles for the Globe and Mail, the New York Times, Outdoors Illustrated, The Guardian and Sea Kayaker Magazine. Maria lives in Nanaimo, B.C., with Dag where they run guided trips to exciting places around the world, through their company Hidden Places.\n\nSource – annickpress.com\n\nAbout the Illustrator – Eugenie Fernandes\n\nMy world is yellow and blue and green. I grew up on the beach. I painted with my father — comic-book illustrator Creig Flessel. We made up stories sitting on the front porch. Birds flew down from the sky and sat on my shoulder. Cats purred. Frogs hopped. I have always lived on islands …a house on Long Island, an apartment on Manhattan Island, a thatch hut on an island in the middle of the South Pacific, and now … I live and work in a little house … on a little island … in a little lake in southern Ontario. Summer and winter …starting at the crack of dawn, I paint every day. Sometimes, I write stories. Sometimes, I sell the stories. Then I paint again … I paint my stories … I paint other people’s stories. Sometimes, I paint paintings for myself … abstract paintings … big … free … Sunshine fills my studio.I am surrounded by water and birds and trees.My world is yellow and blue and green.

Sandra had mentioned this book. She even had a personal connection, Teelo the cat came to live with her for a time. So after hearing this story we were eager to read this book. It didn`t disappoint. We have read it a few times, and enjoyed it every time we have read it. The book does seem to get longer each time as we add our own sound effects into it.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n**This post has been updated from the original version, as we have no had a chance to have a full Story Time with the book**\n\nOnto our 13th book selection for our Canadian, Read Share Celebrate – Picture Book Month Project.\n\nThe book is, Starring Shapes! by Tania Howells.\n\nHere’s another confession, we haven’t had an opportunity to read this one yet, but I am VERY EXCITED TOO!!!\n\nThe book was just released (September 1, 2015), and it’s not yet in my local library to borrow. I have requested it through an inter-library loan process, and just waiting. … … … I promise to update, as soon as we get our little hands on the book, and can READ it!!\n\nHere’s an extended blog post from JacketFlap talking about the book (and their post includes pictures), http://www.jacketflap.com/megablog/?postid=1396677\n\n**Please if you have read this book, feel free to leave some comments for us.**\n\nIn this clever picture book, six different shapes attend Shapeston Elementary School along with the children: Triangle, Square, Circle, Rectangle, Rhombus (or “Diamond” to her friends) and Oval. As the story begins, the big news at school is the upcoming play. Everyone is looking forward to auditioning, especially the shapes. One by one they are introduced, with descriptions of their unique personalities and interests, along with the roles they’ve played before (Triangle as a tortilla chip, Oval as a skating rink, Diamond as a kite and the like). Happily, after all the wonderful auditions, the drama teacher decides everyone gets to be in the play!\n\nThis fresh and playful idea for a concept book, written and illustrated by Tania Howells, makes shapes and early geometry fun. Each shape gets its own two-page spread. On the left is a large picture of the shape, with a simple and expressive face and limbs set in a jaunty pose, along with the explanatory text. On the right are boxes containing smaller illustrations of objects made out of the shape. The art, simply drawn in bright, bold colors, is charming and engaging. These spreads could easily work on their own for a lesson on shapes, and the book could be used to spark a variety of “I spy” activities with young children, in the classroom, in the playground or anywhere out in the world. Also, the ending spread showing the play’s performance offers a terrific opportunity to search for the different shapes on the stage.\n\nHere’s how the author/illustrator talks about this book on her blog (dated May 2015),\n\nhttp://tania.blogs.com/tania/2015/05/starring-shapes.html\n\nAbout Tania Howells –\n\nYou must check out her Biography on her blog.

Starring Shapes! is a very colourful book, however I seem to have a bit of a Love – Hate relationship with it.\n\nWhat I LOVE about this book is the colour. The illustrations are fun, and bright, and we loved them.\n\nWhat has me on the hate side is the text. We found it pretty wordy. And although my little book queen reads a lot of book above her age, she just couldn’t get into this one. (we tried several times).\n\nProbably best for the older kids, but the pictures are fun, and you can probably make up your own fabulous stories with these pictures if your little ones are interested in the actual text.\n\nWelcome to Day 11 of READ SHARE CELEBRATE.\n\nToday as we are celebrating Remembrance Day in Canada, we have selected….\n\nA Poppy is to Remember [ Un Coquelicot Pour Se Souvenir ] by Heather Patterson and Illustrated by Ron Lightburn\n\nHow did the bright red poppy that we all wear in November become Canada’s symbol of honouring those who fought for our freedom on Remembrance Day?\n\nMoving text coupled with stunning illustrations by Governor General’s Award-winning artist Ron Lightburn explain the symbolism behind the poppy.\n\nA bonus for teachers is the five-page spread all about the poem, “In Flanders Fields,” Canada’s wartime and peacekeeping endeavours, and the adoption of the poppy as our Remembrance Day emblem.\n\nScholastic Canada Ltd | ISBN 9780545999816 Paperback\n\n32 Pages | 8.04″ x 10″ | Ages 6 to 8\n\nScholastic Canada Ltd | ISBN 9780439967860 Hardcover\n\n32 Pages | 8.34″ x 10.3″ | Ages 6 to 8\n\nSource – http://www.scholastic.ca/books/view/a-poppy-is-to-remember\n\nI absolutely think this is a Fabulous books for ALL ages. We will be taking this out for a special Family Read Aloud each Remembrance Day going forward.\n\nBefore we received our copy of the book, we read it at one of our many visits to our Local Library. They had some great Remembrance Day Colouring Sheets. So while I read the book to my daughter, she worked very diligently in colouring.\n\nNow for those of you who have not yet had the opportunity to read this book, I found this video online while doing some book research. It was posted last year from the Grade 4-5 class of Williamstown Public School, South Glengarry, Ont. And I think it’s fabulous. The students read the book aloud (English and French translations) and it’s so great to hear.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/-CQzmv5u_4c“>http://\n\nThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:\n\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\n\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning\n\nWe will remember them.\n\nSource – For The Fallen by Robert Laurence Binyon [ http://www.greatwar.co.uk/poems/laurence-binyon-for-the-fallen.htm ]\n\nVery last thing, I promise. I have created a Pinterest Board with a few other Remembrance Day book suggestions, and some activities to do with the Family. Please enjoy! https://www.pinterest.com/ralford/remembrance-day-books-and-activities-kaelyns-book-/\n\n**post has now been updated, with our own story time experience. Scroll down**\n\nWelcome to Day 10 of READ SHARE CELEBRATE.\n\nToday we have 2 different book choices from Deirdre Kessler. One English, One French.\n\nDreamtime Illustrated by Christina Patterson\n\nUn homard dans ma poche Illustrated de Brenda Jones (English Title, A Lobster in My Pocket)\n\nAnother Confession in my Picture Book Month project. Dreamtime is another book that we have yet to read. I have placed a hold on the book from the library, and the last I checked it was in transit (hopefully to me).\n\n** I will update this post as soon as we have the book in hand and Read it Aloud!! **\n\nUntil then….\n\nThe soothing rhythms and sounds of the words of this story will work their magic on children at bedtime. Written by award-winning author Deirdre Kessler and illustrated by the talented young artist Christina Patterson, this book evokes a quiet nighttime in Prince Edward Island–a perfect going-to-bed story. Dreamtimeis sure to be a classic of the 21st century.\n\nProduct Details\n\nHardcover: 24 pages\n\nPublisher: Acorn Press; 01 edition (Oct. 31 2011)\n\nLanguage: English\n\nISBN-10: 1894838645\n\nISBN-13: 978-1894838641\n\nProduct Dimensions: 18.4 x 0.6 x 18.4 cm\n\nSource – http://www.amazon.ca/Dreamtime-Deirdre-Kessler/dp/1894838645\n\nDreamtime by Deirdre Kessler, illustrations by Christina Patterson (Acorn Press, 20 pages, ages four and under, $15.95)\n\nDreamtime is a perfect bedtime story book, with a rhyming text as soft, warm and lovely as a down comforter.\n\n“And birds begin to whisper — their day’s last song is sung. And soft as feathers, evening sighs that dreamtime has begun.”\n\nDeirdre Kessler teaches creative writing and children’s literature at the University of Prince Edward Island and is the author of a dozen other books for kids, including Lobster in My Pocket and Brupp Rides Again. Illustrator Christina Patterson also lives on P.E.I., and their words and pictures together evoke a quiet and lovely dusk that fades to nighttime on the island.\n\nPatterson’s charming oil illustrations are both vivid and soothing. Her use of oil paints gives the pictures a very cool tactile quality — you want to not just look at them, but touch them, too.\n\nan excerpt from, http://thechronicleherald.ca/books/36975-kitts-shares-journey-sable-island\n\nAbout Deirdre Kessler\n\nI am a writer and teacher with a recently published collection of poetry, Afternoon Horses (Acorn Press), two poetry chapbooks, and many poems published in journals and magazines.

We both really like the colourful illustrations, but I found myself disappointed with the text.\n\nTypically a Picture book has 32 pages (that’s not to say that some have don’t have a few more, and some have less). This book has 24 pages. I just found that by the time we got to the end of the book there was a feeling that I had missed something, or that it just ended too soon.\n\nWondering your opinion….\n\nHave you an opportunity to read this book?\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"
