        "text": "3. / 3 30 YEARS / Author’s name A regional cooperation marking three decades of Open Society Foundations in the Balkans The 30 Years Initiative has provided perspective on three decades, 1991–2021, of the presence and work of the Open Society Foundations (OSF) in the Bal- kans. It has examined how the unique philanthropic efforts of George Soros, his open society ideas and philosophy persevered during the stormy recent history of the region and how that work is still a moving force, alive and active. The 30 Years Initiative consists of two complementary components: a virtual tour of seven presentations/discussions on the region, each of which offered a particular perspective on the 30 years – Virtual Momentum – and the book 30 Years: Open Society and Its Friends. Taken together, the two parts of the initia- tive offer an excellent and significant opportunity to look at the region and its many challenges, accomplishments, difficulties, failures, political and social circumstances—its past, present and future. The 30 Years Initiative presented its tour de table – Virtual Momentum – trav- eling throughout the Balkans in 2021: April 22 – Pristina, Kosovo, hosted by the Kosovo Foundation for Open So- ciety May 6 – Ljubljana, Slovenia, hosted by The Peace Institute May 18 – Skopje, North Macedonia, hosted by the Foundation Open Society – Macedonia June 10 – Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, hosted by the Open Society Fund – Bosnia and Herzegovina June 14 – Zagreb, Croatia, hosted by the Human Rights House Zagreb June 17 – Belgrade, Serbia, hosted by the Open Society Foundation Serbia June 17 – Final discussion on the future of open society in the Balkans Executive Producer: Beka Vučo Program Analyst: Zorana Gajić The 30 Years Initiative Production Team: Aida Čengić, Andi Dobrushi, Tin Gazivoda, Dobrila Govedarica, Slavica Indjevska, Lura Limani, Radmila Maslo- varić, Miodrag Milosavljević, Fani Karanfilova-Panovska, Brankica Petković, Klodjan Seferaj, Luan Shllaku, and Daliborka Uljarević Researchers of historical material: Aida Čengić and Iliriana Kaçaniku Technical and Logistical Support: Ultra Marine Agency. www.30yearsinitiative.com PRODUCTON TEAM #thirtyyears\n\n4.

Under these conditions, the Foun- dation was one of the essential, invaluable facts that eased for the people of Sarajevo the feeling that they were cut off from the world and abandoned. Such feelings were widespread. Sarajevo poet Abdulah Sidran, in his poem titled “Planet Sarajevo,” captured this in his appeal to the ears of the world: Listen to the breathing of Planet Sarajevo. Prevented from living a normal life in Sarajevo, we did not lose our sense of dignity, thanks to the presence of the Foundation, among others, and all the noble people who were in precious contact with us. On the pages that follow, we speak about everything the Foundation accom- plished here over the last thirty years. In this brief preface, in keeping with my vocation as a journalist, I will mention only the digital archive of newspa- pers. Each time I reach for this precious tool, so necessary in the fight against oblivion and ignorance, I remind myself that it came about at the prompting of the Soros Foundation. Thanks to it, in its easily accessible memory, I read today that George Soros signed an agreement with the government of Yugo- slavia establishing the Soros Yugoslavia Foundation on 17 June 1991. Events then accelerated dramatically and utterly transformed the history and geog- raphy of the country. © Milomir Kovačević Strašni, Children in War, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1992\n\n8. 12 / / 13 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Boro Kontić And such was the moment, despite the astrological exclusivity, when the Open Society was born. In keeping with the essence and name of the Foundation, this anniversa- ry publication is not intended to bring an end to the narrative about the Foundation. New subjects, fresh perspectives, new testimonies are always welcome. That same day all the newspapers reported that the European Community would be announcing its position on Yugoslavia that was to be “precise, clear and extremely comprehensible.” A few days later came the declaration of independence of Slovenia, one of the six Yugoslav republics. The declaration was followed by a ten-day war with Yugoslav People’s Army units, and this clash augured what has been euphemistically dubbed the “bloody ’90s.” And the collapse of Yugoslavia. That same June day, the media reported on an escalating situation with Al- banian refugees who were trying to land in Brindisi at the very tip of the Italian boot. The Italian government decided that the boats carrying the 680 newcomers would have to leave the territorial waters of Italy and return to Albania. At such a time the people of what was still a shared state drew together. The cohesion of the country may have been in question, but their common goals were not: an open society, advancement of civil institutions, respect for human rights, respect for diversity, the rule of law, the professional media, and par- ticipation of citizens in public life. Everything listed here was clearly under threat. These goals were often maliciously dismissed in the bloody ’90s as “peacetime luxuries.” But also a part of the mosaic of events from the time, from that very day, is the news that a phenomenon appeared in the heavens on 17 June 1991 that is seen only rarely. Three large planets in the solar system—Venus, Mars, and Jupiter—were only three degrees apart for several days. The next time, astronomers tell us, that these planets converge over Earth will be in 2152. We hope that the world will be in better shape in 2152, fairer and more sen- sible than when conditions called for the Soros Foundation to be established. And we hope that no other city on this planet of ours endures years that are as tragic as those endured by Sarajevo and the region. What has been accomplished over the first thirty years under the auspices of the Foundation will be set out on the pages before you. And lest we forget: The people I met while working at the Foundation fill my address book and its contents are always changing. Names disappear after one-time projects end, but the friendships formed through work at the Foundation are constant. These friendships gainsay the notion that one only makes true friends in childhood. Friendships are made when people can recognize sincere dedication to shared values. Especially at a time when these values are under attack. Translated from Bosnian by Ellen Elias-Bursać\n\n9. 14 / / 15 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Geroge Soros and Alexander Soros The Promise of Open Society George Soros and Alexander Soros Looking back, we are convinced that starting the foundations three decades ago in what was once Yugoslavia was one of our great achievements. The new foundation in 1991 embraced a diversity of thought and approaches at a time when the countervailing forces of dissolution and nationalism were already underway in the former Yugoslavia. At its core the foundation aspired to strengthen the very notion of open soci- ety by fostering the development of an autonomous civil society, independent media, and a range of educational and cultural institutions, which often were the only critical voices. These early efforts included providing scholarships, investing in early child- hood education, supporting independent media, funding democratically mind- ed groups, and giving humanitarian aid. Sarajevo in particular was a symbol of open society that became threatened with destruction by the doctrine of the ethnic state. It was here where any supposed march to freedom was over, and it was a sign of what was still possible on the European continent. During the siege, the foundation worked to maintain some vestige of normal- ity for people living there—repairing and extending the gas lines, supplying coal, firewood, and charcoal, establishing access to clean water, restoring the bakery, providing seeds for planting and of course, newsprint because access to information assumed an urgency almost as fundamental as food or water. Until the foundation installed a satellite phone system, there was no way the civilian population could have contact with the outside world. There is so much that came out of the Western Balkan foundations, perhaps what we are most proud of is that they all shared the goal of Roma inclu- sion and empowering Roma in their struggle for cultural, social and political identity. There was so much ground gained on this front even up to today. George Soros George Soros is founder and chair of Soros Fund Management and the Open Society Foundations. Soros has been active as a philanthropist since 1979, when he began providing funds to help black students attend Cape Town Uni- versity in apartheid South Africa. He has since given away more than $32 billion. The Open Society Foundations today support individuals and organi- zations in more than 120 countries, working to build vibrant and inclusive democracies whose governments are accountable to their citizens. Alexander Soros Alex Soros is the deputy chair of the Open Society Foundations. Soros re- ceived his PhD in 2018 from the University of California, Berkeley and was a post-doctoral fellow at the Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and the Human- ities at Bard College, an honorary fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study at Central European University in Budapest, and a visiting fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna.\n\n10. 16 / / 17 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Boris Buden There is Life after the West Remember the Alamo Boris Buden I People may be more or less aware of this, but the time has come to say it out loud: the entire grand narrative of the democratic revolutions of 1989–90 and the final liberation of the people of Eastern Europe from Communist totalitarianism, including what we refer to as the “transition to democracy”— the project of bringing the postcommunist societies into conformity with the norms and ideals of the “West”—has lost all meaning, at least for the regions of ex-Yugoslavia. What’s more, it has shown itself to be what it always has, in fact, been—an ideological trap for redistributing power and establishing new rela- tions of dominance and exploitation. The time is behind us now when we had a sense of a total historical certainty, when we knew exactly where we were com- ing from and where we were going. Now the unknown lies before us, obscure and perilous, as the future always is, open to any number of outcomes. Once abandoned, the well-trodden path of history we embarked upon in 1989–90 is now a meander, as is increasingly clear. Straying from the path is easy, yet there is no way back. The likelihood that the process of transformation begun with the epochal fall of Communism would end fatally now seems altogether plau- sible. And this is not merely a case of a genuine threat of imminent biological extinction of the kind faced by most of the nations whose independence came about after Yugoslavia fell to pieces; this extinction includes or rather assumes an economic backward slide, disintegration of the social fabric, a total loss of political and every other kind of sovereignty, cultural decadence, geopolitical marginalization and an overall provincialization of the lifeworld. But the final breakdown of the postcommunist grand narrative brought along with it something else. Something which finally resembles authentic histori- cal experience. And historical experience is authentic inasmuch as it is the experience of contradiction, irreducible to the simple, linear flow of historical time and hierarchical relations, which such a linear temporality assumes and produces. In the ideological construct of such “transitions toward democracy,” the postcommunist societies have been trapped in a paradigm of “historical Though the circumstances often were incredibly difficult, the bold and brave efforts of the foundation in Yugoslavia continue to inspire the work of the Open Society Foundations around the world today—we will always maintain a stubborn belief in the possibility of open society, even when the odds seem to be against us. © Vesna Pavlović, Fototeka (Projection Still VI), Archival pigment print, From Fabrics of Socialism series, 2015\n\n11. 18 / / 19 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Boris Buden comparable to Anders Breivik’s massacre or the murders of foreigners in Germany before the outbreak of the recent war. The riot of the mob at the American Capitol was reminiscent of our “happenings of the people,” and the “anti-bureaucratic” and “yogurt” revolutions, but at that point there was no loss of life yet. Whether justified or not, this déjà vu effect raises yet another question: “Who is catching up to whom here, who is in transition, from where and toward what? Isn’t it the “West” that is following in the footsteps of the postcommunist East and isn’t what the western societies are now going through the very thing we went through some thirty years ago? Haven’t we from the East, especially those of us from the region of ex-Yugoslavia, been the avant-garde of history, while the liberally democratic “West” is our straggling adherent? This question, no matter how understandable it may be, rests on er- roneous assumptions—those same assumptions on which rests the grand narrative of what are referred to as the democratic revolutions of 1989–90 and the ideology of postcommunist “transition to democ- racy.” The view of the “West” as the ideological end of history, finished in the real existing order of liberal democracy, which—in a state of post-historical quiescence, “waiting” for everyone else to catch up with it—is every bit as illusory as the fantasy of a postcommunist East being the avant-garde of the historical regression and dystopian havoc of that same order of liberal democracy. In genuine historical practice, nobody catches up with anybody, nor does anybody wait, nor can we know in advance how a newly initiated historical process will end. Nevertheless, the illusion about the “West,” which in its ideo- logical self-dismantling follows the dark ideal of the postcommunist “East,” does contain a kernel of truth: the heroic story of how lib- eral democracy—and capitalism, of course—beat communist total- itarianism and brought about the end of history has run its course; the teleology of the “transition to democracy,” which mobilized the transformational energy of the postcommunist states, promising a brand new light at the end of the tunnel, has lost the force of its at- traction; finally the “West,” after losing the cachet of the norm and aura of the ideal, has shown itself in its real historical truth—as an ideological construct whose historical viability is over. The first thing that can breathe meaning into life after the “West” is an alternative genealogy of actual reality—not yet another grand narrative, but a story in which we can recognize not only what we are like today, but lag” behind the democratic, capitalist societies of the “West”; from this follows the necessity of an (accelerated) push for them to catch up with the “West.” This has, then, created a whole teleology of transformation, based on the real existing ideal of the “West,” reduced to a hierarchical ascent to “higher,” “west- ern” values. The trajectory was well-planned and the idea was to follow it to the goal. In essence, this entire process could be reduced to the dubious notion of “westernization.” And in the process, every doubt in the ideal or, heaven forbid, consideration of possible alternatives, was shoved aside. The same paradigm, after all, was used to understand the identity wars of the 1990s which tore Yu- goslavia to pieces. Their cause, meaning the cause of the social and political processes that brought them about, was seen to be the “civilizational short- comings” of the Balkan people, in other words, their cultural backwardness— lagging behind “the West,” of course. In picturesque terms, the Balkan peoples chose to battle each other so they could vent their atavistic passions instead of enjoying the boons of western democracy and the prosperity of a free capitalist market. Needless to say, the notion of the “West” as an ideal is thereby utterly de-historicized. As a transitological ideologem, this implies a sublimated norm, and not a historically contingent and culturally particular form of real life which is, as such, inseparable from the internal contradictions, regressive processes, crises, unplanned about-faces, a life that can always elude control and take off in an unpredictable direction. And then this is precisely what happened. People from the Balkans, and with them a large part of the world, watched with incredulity as the crisis of the po- litical order, the populist mobilization of the masses, the uncontrolled dissolu- tion of supranational institutions, nationalism, racism, political violence, home- grown terrorism and even the threat of a new wave of fascism engulfed the previously untouchable “West.” The shock caused by Trump’s rise in the United States, Brexit and the real possibility of a collapse of the European Union, the rise of the right-wing populist parties and movements in western Europe and ideologically kindred regimes in the European East, prompted many from the region of ex-Yugoslavia to ask: Haven’t we already seen this? Isn’t the inabil- ity of the European Union to anticipate and absorb the separatist tendency of Great Britain reminiscent of the helplessness of the political elites of the Yugo- slav federation to prevent the collapse of the multiethnic state? Doesn’t Donald Trump’s populism sound a lot like the rhetoric of our nationalistic leaders who took us to war back then? We can still remember how the “West” identified the cause of the war as ethnic hatred, supposedly native to the culturally backward “Balkans.” But what we don’t recall is the hatreds ever escalating—no mat- ter how present they may have been in ex-Yugoslavia—to a level of violence BORIS BUDEN Boris Buden, author, cultural critic and translator.

No matter how local and singular, the story must be globally translatable. It must also be freed of transitional teleology, its linear temporality. And perhaps most important, it must be told from the other side of “East” and “West.” II In what follows I will offer a brief analysis of a case supported by the main thesis: in Croatia—and this country will serve as my illustration here—the very first step taken toward democracy in 1989 went in the wrong direction. Why and how? If we are to understand this we need to start somewhere else, in a different time. For instance, in Vienna in 2012. In the spring of this year, a new activist initiative cropped up on the political scene in Austria, using the obscure name of W.I.R.—Wiens Identitäre Richtung (The Identity Orientation of Vienna). This group of young neo-rightists and racists, led by Alexander Markovitz, a student of history, held their first activ- ist performance in September of that year. Wearing monkey and pig masks they harassed the members of an African-Haitian dance workshop organized by Caritas. By late 2012, W.I.R. joined forces with like-minded people hold- ing similar political ambitions and founded IBÖ—Identitäre Bewegung Österreichs (Austrian Identity Movement), and in so doing joined the new pan-European right wing that had been coalescing around the notion of identity, or more precisely, around the common goal of preserving and protecting something this movement, in an overtly racist sense, experiences as a European identi- ty, which, in their opinion, faces an imminent and vital threat from migrations and left liberal politics. Back to the acronym of W.I.R. At first glance, beyond serving as the name of a movement, it suggests association with something else, the pronoun “we,” in German, wir. But only at first glance. A second glance reveals that W.I.R. evokes a far deeper historical meaning, linking it to the Balkans and the present time. During the age of European revolutions, 1848–49, known as the Peoples’ Spring under the Habsburg monarchy of the day—brought to the verge of collapse by democratic uprisings—W.I.R. stood not only for the royal ‘we’ used by the still very youthful emperor in his proclamations ad- dressing the people—“We, Franz Joseph the First, with God’s grace Emperor of Austria, Apostolic King of Hungary and the King of the Czech lands…”—but also for the initials of the three “glorious” generals of the counter-revolu- tion: Windisch-Grätz, Jelačić, Radetzky.

The liberal citizenry respects the national tradition, even when they ought to be ashamed of it. Contrast this with the communists who took the monument to Ban Jelačić down in 1947 and renamed his square Republic Square, thereby acknowledging as their own not only the tradition of European revolutionary republicanism, but also the democratic political legacy of the bourgeois class. Believe it or not, only in the revolutionary communist movement did the bour- geois elites of the Yugoslav nations come into their own as a political subject of contemporary—we might even say contemporary “western”—history. In the 1960 American movie, The Alamo, which evokes the 1836 battle of Texas republicans against the troops of the Mexican president, General Santa Anna, John Wayne both directs the film and plays Davy Crockett. In one scene he has a long monologue about the idea of the republic: “Republic. I like the sound of the word. It means people can live free, talk free, go or come, buy or sell, be drunk or sober, however they choose. Some words give you a feeling. ‘Republic’ is one of those words that makes me tight in the throat—the same tightness a man gets when his baby takes his first step or his first baby shaves and makes his first sound as a man. Some words can give you a feeling that makes your heart warm. ‘Republic’ is one of those words. ”The word “Republic” leaves the heart of the Croatian middle class cold. Unlike the heart of the Croatian and Yugoslav communists, which beat for the political ideals of historical citizenry and the “West.” And when this heart stopped beat- ing, not only did the citizenry, as an historical subject, vanish from the scene, but the progressive charge, which created the “West” along the teleological horizon of contemporary history, vanished too. In this, however, there is nothing tragic. The heart of our current consumerist middle class, which owes its material existence to communist modernization, is not warmed by ideals, and especially not ideals of a better future. Its historical pulse, after all, can no longer be felt. And as far as the “West” is concerned, there is life after that illusion as well. ?

We Croats entered the fray at this point as the “faithful-unto-the-Emperor” (kai- sertreu) vassals who, under the banner of Ban Josip Jelačić, joined the Europe- an counter-revolution in the decisive and merciless struggle, squashing every- thing implicit in so-called European democratic, i.e., “western,” values. And, as is well known, we prevailed. The democratic, republican spring glimpsed briefly by the people of Europe in 1848 was immediately transformed into a monar- chist autumn and absolutist winter thanks to our modest contribution. In late October 1848, with the cannonade of Windisch-Grätz’s guns from the terrace of the Schwarzenberg palace, our predecessors—Croats and Serbs in harmony and unity under Jelačić’s command—stormed the barricades of the uprising in the center of Vienna. This was after they had rebuffed Kossuth’s troops at Schwechat, who shortly before had rushed to the aid of the Viennese revolution- aries. Along the way, our predecessors shot, slaughtered and, with the gusto of war, marauded, until finally they not only saved the emperor and the monarchy from republican wrath, but preserved the vassal yoke around their own necks. Today the belief is widely held that doing so was in our national interest. We may ask, however: are these identity neo-rightwingers who have stepped into the twenty-first century following in the footsteps of Windisch-Grätz, Jelačić and Radetzki also acting in the interests of Europe and the European identity to which Croats—as we’re still taught today by Croatian national ideology—have always belonged? In Jelačić’s style, for instance, when, entirely in keeping with Hus’s observation, “O sancta simplicitas,” they toss their little bundle of wood onto the bonfire on which burns the idea of democratic republicanism. Exactly a month before the Berlin wall came down, in early October 1989, the Croatian Social Liberal Alliance, the first organized initiative coming from the reawakened multiparty system in Croatia, convened on Zagreb’s Republic Square (still so-named then) for a public signing of a petition for return of the Ban Jelačić monument to the square. Twenty years later, one of the partici- pants of the happening would describe the year of 1989 as the “second People’s Spring.”¹ He seemed to feel there was no contradiction in the fact that he had taken part in retrieving the monument from the junk heap of history and was thereby celebrating the butcher of that first People’s Spring in 1848—just as there was no problem for this newly minted political party of Croatian liberals to bring their historical and ideological nemesis out of the shadows onto the political stage of the freshly established democracy. But just before this party was erased altogether from the Croatian political scene by precisely the same nationalism they’d tried unsuccessfully to woo when bringing the monument 1836 : 1960 2021 Translated from Croatian by Ellen Elias-Bursać 1989–1990 : 1947\n\n14. 24 / / 25 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Dubravka Stojanović History–Servant or Mistress? Dubravka Stojanović How long does an historical event last? What about a war? Does it actually be- gin with the first shot fired and end with the signing of the peace treaty? Is its duration “dictated” by historians who “assign” it the dates we find in encyclo- pedias and history textbooks to mark the beginning and the end of hostilities? Or is the duration of an event calculated and measured differently? Perhaps a war should be seen as beginning when the ideological buildup to hostilities starts, and as ending only when the memories of the war cease to stir power- ful emotions and shape the present. All of these are key theoretical questions about the relationship between the present and the past, about historical periodization and chronology, but primarily about how a society approaches history. If Erik Hobsbaum could say that the 20th century was a brief one, that it didn’t last for the usual 100 years but only 78—from the first outbreak of worldwide conflict in 1914 to the unification of the continent in 1992—then we, too, can ask how long the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s have really lasted. This year, 2021, is exactly 30 years since the “formal” outbreak of the Yu- goslav wars. But did they really begin in 1991, or was the whole previous decade, from Tito’s death in 1980, an indivisible part of the buildup? As far as the end of the war is concerned, it “formally” ended in Croatia with the Oluja (Storm) military campaign in 1995. The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended with the Dayton Peace Accords later that same year, while the Kosovo conflict ended with the NATO Pact intervention of 1999. More than 20 years have passed since then, indeed a quarter century! But all of us who live in this part of the world know that these wars are still ongoing in one form or another even today, and they continue to determine our lives—in fact they are increasingly present in our everyday lives. You might ask how such powerful negative emotions can be sustained for such a long time? How does one see to it that the fires that fuel the conflict burn on for decades? © Goraka Matić, Black Ribbon, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, May 31, 1992\n\n15. 26 / / 27 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Dubravka Stojanović The history boom that paved the way for war in Yugoslavia began at the very beginning of the 1980s. Many agents of memory joined the effort. The revi- sion of history in Serbia was first begun by the Church. Then literature con- tributed with the novels of Dobrica Ćosić (Vreme smrti 1972/This Land, This Time 1978) and Vuk Drašković (Nož 1982/Knife 2000), authors who were the first to inaugurate a revisionist rethinking of the two world wars. Then came theater. The play Kolubarska bitka (The Battle of Kolubara, 1983), based on a novel by Dobrica Ćosić, goes straight to the crux of the matter—it posits World War I as the pivotal event of the new culture of memory, the ideal amalgam of a heroic and self-victimizing narrative. Golubnjača, a play published in 1982, broaches the question of genocide against Serbs in the wartime Independent State of Croatia—also fast becoming a foundational subject of revanchist pol- itics. This wave reached its peak with the publication, in 1985, of the novel Knjiga o Milutinu (The Book of Milutin), which was published in an astonishing 17 printings in a single year. The novel tells the story of the suffering of Serbs in the 20th century, particularly at the hands of neighboring communities. In the mid-1980s, historiography joined the fray with “new insights,” first rede- fining the relationship between the Chetniks and Partisans, and then intro- ducing, in a growing number of articles about the Independent State of Croa- tia, the premise that there could be genocide again, so a preventive war was necessary in order to keep this from happening. All these were, of course, legitimate topics for consideration, but the goal of these scholars was not to publicize scholarly truth, but to dismantle Yugoslavia. The war could now begin. Ethnic cleansing, massive crimes, camps, bomb- ing, snipers, sieges all happened again. Genocide. They recurred not because these are uniquely Balkan specialties, nor because these peoples are inher- ently violent, and even less because history is destiny that returns in cycles. All these are justifications used to avoid responsibility. This happened again because the predetermined goal of war necessarily led to these sorts of con- flicts, and also because the instrumentalization of the past provided amnesty for the most cruel of crimes. And then the wars ended. But the elites weren’t ready to relinquish the wars’ emotive and political potential. The mental pro- longation of a war is a lucrative affair. The constant restoking of the war nar- rative has allowed the war-waging elites, after only brief setbacks, to stay in power until today in all the countries that emerged from the dismantling of Yugoslavia. For 30 years. You may well ask: how could this be possible? It has been possible because the elites did not just take our societies and countries hostage, but our pasts as well. They skillfully kept their steely grip on the inter- pretation of history even after the war. From the battlefields, the wars moved The incendiary tinder, the surest way to keep the conflict blazing, is abuse of history. History has been the battlefield on which all of this began, on which the swords of the Yugoslav peoples first crossed—because Yugosla- via couldn’t be dismantled without first bringing into question its historical foundations. The ideology of “brotherhood and unity” first had to be usurped. It was on the foundations laid by this ideology that Yugoslavia was rebuilt during World War II. The country had to be portrayed as a dungeon of the peoples, an artificial creation imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. There had to be created and then intensified a feeling of threat coming from the other parts of the country. To underscore this, each of the communities had to see itself as having fared the worst within Yugoslavia: territorial concessions. There was a need to create and then exacerbate the feeling that the oth- er Yugoslav peoples were a threat. For this purpose, World War II and the monstrous crimes that the various Yugoslav peoples committed against each other under the cloak of the wartime occupation served as the handiest “memory jog.” Hence mass graves from World War II were exhumed in the 1980s with the goal of shocking, provoking distrust, inflaming passions, and especially stoking fear that the crimes perpetrated against them couldhap- pen again. Fingers were pointed at neighboring republics, not so they’d face up to the crimes committed in the spirit of preventing such crimes from hap- pening again, but the very opposite—so that crimes like these would again become psychologically possible. And for the crimes to become psychologically possible, each of these peo- ples had to envision themselves as both the finest of heroes and the most wretched of victims. A contradiction? Not at all. Everything is fair game in myth. Pushing a heroic narrative boosts self-awareness with the story of how “we have won every war,” and this augurs future victories; the statement “we have never waged wars of conquest” reinforces the idea that future wars will also be morally defensible. However not even this was enough. Heroes are beyond our reach. While they are models and ideals, they exist on an- other plane and ordinary people find identification with them difficult. This is why the role of victim is far more productive for propaganda. Victimhood attracts empathy, it homogenizes a community, enhances cohesion, engen- ders a feeling of superiority. Victims cannot be murderers. They are a priori forgiven. Victimhood cannot be questioned, it is both dogma and untouchable myth—the foundation of every authoritarian order. This is why victimhood manipulation serves as the conceptual basis for political manipulation.\n\n16. 28 / / 29 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Dubravka Stojanović But why stoke conflicts at all? The naïve might think that war is something nobody wants, that it is in nobody’s interest, that everyone does everything they can to keep a war from starting and all they can to bring it to an end as soon as possible. The Yugoslav experience has shown how erroneous this thinking is. War is in the interest of many. When a country is in disarray, absolute power can be imposed and increased, democratic processes can be halted, development blocked. This promises a permanent condition of insecurity in which a “strong hand” offers quick solutions. The anticipation of war, the war itself, and its mental prolongation provide excuses for blocking the introduction of essential political changes, and this is in the most profound interest of various elites because only then can they, unhin- dered, grab all power. The political conflicts of the past have shown themselves to be trusty allies in this effort. Control over past conflicts has been shown to be the best way to maintain control over society. It is easier to work with the past and manipulate it than to offer a program for the fu- ture. Hence the past is offered up as a surrogate for the present and future, as a solution when there is nothing else to offer. It simulates a dynamic; it imitates life—because we can no longer extricate our- selves from the past, and perhaps we’d rather not. This is why the question must be raised of whether life mired in the past has perma- nently kept us from seeing the problems of the present and finding ways to address them. Is history only a servant aiding the authorities and keeping the present as is, or will it ultimately become our mis- tress? into the realm of history, using new narratives with which they continued to mesmerize the masses. Fresher, more traumatic and recent examples have been added from the wars of the 1990s in addition to the tales—well-used yet never used-up—of the sorry fate of one’s own people during the world wars or under Yugoslav oppression. For the newly created states, these new stories have been incorporated in the founding myth. The Ten-Day War in Slovenia has become the source of a heroic narrative. The Homeland War in Croatia and the status of war veterans are untouchable and protected by the consti- tution and parliamentary declarations that ban any attempt at reassessment. Bosnia and Herzegovina has deepened its ethnic divisions—ensconced by the Dayton Peace Accords—with three concurrent and utterly contradictory inter- pretations of the wars of the 1990s, and these successfully prevent the state from functioning. Montenegro has issued apologies, but it has also covered up many bloody wartime episodes. Until recently, Serbia pretended it played no part whatsoever in the wars, just as the Milošević regime claimed. Vučić has, however, discovered that the traumatic events of the 1990s wars could provide new impetus for mobilization and, of course, an additional boost to his power. Serbia has hastily cobbled together a new narrative, focused en- tirely on two events: Operation Oluja and the NATO Pact bombing, as if nothing had happened before them. The ways in which the state now commemorates these dates clearly indicate the formation of a new martyr identity, according to which the Serbs are the greatest victims of the Yugoslav wars. Not only have there been promises of governmental financial support for movies and television series to inculcate among the masses a desirable interpretation of these events, but a speedy campaign is presently underway to introduce one single, rubber-stamped textbook for history and geography, so school students are given the “real truth,” or so they claim. Each year the key dates become triggers for new negative emotions, the promotion of conflicts with the neighboring countries and a prolongation of war by other means. History is also used in quite specific instances. For instance, Montenegro and Serbia recently reached a nadir in their diplomatic relations; their am- bassadors were declared personae non gratae after a divergence in their interpretations of decisions taken at the Montenegrin assembly of 1918! At almost the same moment, Bulgaria obstructed the European integration of Northern Macedonia, demanding that the country issue statements on cer- tain historical events and personalities and “concede” that one of their great national heroes, Goce Delčev, is, in fact, Bulgarian. These are the most cur- rent examples of how history has become a handy tool for daily politics, for achieving immediate political goals.

It was my third visit to the besieged city that year. The war in Bosnia had been underway since spring the previous year. Conditions were bleak. There were shortages of food and drinking water. Many trees had been cut down for firewood. The electric power supply was intermittent. Residents of the city’s tall apartment buildings frequently had to climb many flights of stairs, often carrying plastic bottles with water they had obtained from the city’s old wells, to reach their homes. Worst of all was the constant shelling and sniping from the surround- ing hills that by then had maimed and killed thousands of the city’s residents. Zdravko Grebo, Professor of Law at Sarajevo’s University and Chair of the Open Society Foundation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, had arranged for me to speak at the Law School. I was to discuss the recent decision of the United Nations Security Council to establish an International Criminal Tribunal to prosecute and punish those from all sides who were committing war crimes in Bosnia and elsewhere in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. It was the first such tribunal under international sponsorship since those at Nuremberg and Tokyo immediately following World War II. In my previous position as Ex- ecutive Director of Human Rights Watch, I had issued a public call to establish such a tribunal and helped to otain its adoption by the Security Council. Though the Security Council resolution included a detailed plan for the op- eration of the tribunal, and had been adopted unanimously in May 1993, not much had happened in the roughly five months that had elapsed before my talk in Sarajevo. Most important, a chief prosecutor for the tribunal had not been chosen. Due largely to obstruction by Russia, no one would be chosen to fill this crucial post for another nine months. Moreover, the new tribunal would have no enforcement mechanism to enable it to get custody of those © Paul Lowe/Aida Šehović Što te nema, nomadic monument, Potočari/Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, July 11, 2020\n\n18. 32 / / 33 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Aryeh Neier the transition from apartheid to a democratic system, he had headed an in- vestigative commission that demonstrated that the South African police were covertly fomenting violence between different groups of the country’s black inhabitants in order to discredit the emergence of a multiracial democracy. I had gotten to know Goldstone during this period and had formed a very high regard for him. When the transition finally took place in May 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as South Africa’s President, Mandela had ap- pointed Richard Goldstone to the country’s Supreme Court. Goldstone’s association with Mandela was what made it possible for the Security Council to appoint him to serve as the Tribunal’s chief prosecutor. The old Soviet Union had been eager to portray itself as the friend of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. Accordingly, Russia did not want to antagonize Mandela, who gave Goldstone a leave from his appointment to the South African Supreme Court to take up his post at the Yugoslav tribunal. While Russia had blocked others who had been considered for the post as chief prosecutor. It did not obstruct the appointment of Goldstone. Goldstone’s appointment as Chief Prosecutor revived hopes for the Tribunal. It was not only his reputation. He had a capacity to project determination and bulldog tenacity that made some who were skeptical of the Tribunal begin to take it seriously. Another factor was that he altered the strategy of the Office of the Prosecutor. Before Goldstone’s arrival in The Hague, the prosecutors recruited to staff the Tribunal had proceeded as if they were conducting trials of criminal gangs or racketeers. They had focused on securing indictments of low level members of those gangs on the theory that if they obtained custody of those indictees they would get them to provide evidence against their superiors in exchange for reduced charges or more lenient sentences. Charges against more senior figures would be bolstered by evidence provid- ed by defendants engaged in a form of plea bargaining. Such a strategy may be appropriate in many ordinary criminal cases. Yet it was counterproductive so far as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was concerned. It reinforced the view based on the ICTY’s custody of Duško Tadić that, at most, it would deal with some of the small fry of the wars in the former Yugoslavia. A serious concern was wheth- er the United Nations would maintain the funding for the ICTY. Also, some diplomats feared that the indictments issued by the ICTY might complicate the process of negotiating a peace settlement to end the conflict in Bosnia. Killing the Tribunal to save money and make it easier to end the war was an option that had significant support. who would be indicted for committing was crimes. Some governments sup- ported establishment of the tribunal as a way to pretend they were doing something about war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia that aroused internation- al outrage. It was a substitute for sending in troops to put an end to the conflict. In my talk at Sarajevo University, I discussed the crimes that would be subject to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the procedures it would follow and the punishments that would be handed down. While the members of my audience were polite, I could see that they thought I was fantasizing. The Bosnian Serb forces be- sieging Sarajevo under the leadership of Radovan Karadžić and General Rat- ko Mladić, cutting off its food supply, water and utilities, and wounding and killing many of its citizens, were winning the war. Those who knew the history of Nuremberg and Tokyo were well aware that those tribunals succeeded because the Germans and Japanese had surrendered. The Allied forces that defeated them in World War II had custody of the principal war criminals. The situation in the former Yugoslavia was entirely different. Many of those who listened to my talk probably thought that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia was a bad joke. It was not only the residents of Sarajevo who were skeptical of the new tribunal. The great majority of those in other countries who followed developments in the former Yugoslavia also doubted that it would amount to anything. As the war in Bosnia continued, with ongoing reports in the international media of atrocities, nothing seemed to be happening at the tribunal. For a substantial period, the only person over whom the tribunal obtained custody was a low level former guard at one of the camps that the Bosnian Serbs op- erated where many detainees were tortured and often killed. To evade being drafted into the Bosnian Serb army, Duško Tadić had fled the territory and had gone to Munich. There, he was recognized on the streets by former de- tainees of the Omarska Camp where he had been employed, and where he had participated in the conduct of abuses. The German authorities arrested him and turned him over to the tribunal where he was eventually tried, con- victed and sentenced to a long prison term. I recall talking about the Tadić case with a prominent American diplomat who scoffed that the only thing that the tribunal had to show for itself was that it had put a “Corporal” on trial. In July 1994, fourteen months after the Security Council established the Tribu- nal, it finally got a chief prosecutor. The appointee was a South African Judge, Richard Goldstone, with a stellar international reputation. He had found ways during the apartheid years to challenge the country’s repressive system by rulings that upheld principles of equal justice. When violence erupted during\n\n19. 34 / / 35 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Aryeh Neier Richard Goldstone turned the attention of the Office of the Prosecutor to top-ranking leaders of the parties to the conflict, including Karadžić and General Mladić. It took him some time to gather the evidence needed to bring an indictment. When they were indicted in July 1995, it caused a sensation. Though the Office of the Prosecutor did not know it at the time, the issuance of the indictment coincided with the greatest crime of the war, the massa- cre of about 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica. Witin a few weeks, however, that crime had been exposed. Goldstone’s response included the separate indictment of Karadžić and Mladić for the genocidal slaughter at Srebrenica. The indictments of Karadžić and Mladić had an important un- anticipated consequence. Shortly after the second set of indictments, the parties to the conflict in Bosnia gathered at Dayton, Ohio for peace negotia- tions. Radovan Karadžić had been expected to go to Dayton to represent the Bosnian Serbs. But the indictments made it dangerous for him to attend. He could have been arrested and turned over to the Tribunal. Accordingly, he did not attend. Instead, Slobodan Milošević, who had not yet been indicted, represented the Bosnian Serbs as well as the Federal Republic of Yugosla- via (Serbia and Montenegro). Some observers believe that this facilitated the achievement of a peace accord, as Milošević proved somewhat more tracta- ble in the negotiations than Karadžić. As the war in Bosnia ended following the Dayton Peace Agreement in December 1995, the Tribunal still had not made progress in obtaining custo- dy of defendants it had indicted. Richard Goldstone had left The Hague and was succeeded by a Canadian Judge, Louise Arbour. NATO troops occupied Bosnia to enforce the Peace Agreement. They distributed flyers with photos of indicted war criminals, but arrests were not made. There were reports tha NATO troops deliberately avoided making arrests because they were con- cerned about reprisals. One arrest was made in Eastern Slavonia because the UN Administrator of the region, General Jacques Klein (a French born American military man), was intent on cooperating with the Tribunal. The situation changed when Tony Blair became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1997. Blair appointed Robin Cook as his Foreign Secretary. Cook was a strong proponent of human rights and under his influence, the prac- tice of British troops serving with NATO in Bosnia underwent a radical shift. Instead of letting those indicted by the Tribunal go unmolested, British troops began seeking those who the prosecutors for the ICTY had designated as war criminals and turning them over to the Tribunal. Though there had been pre- dictions that sympathizers with those who had been indicted would engage in reprisals against those carrying out arrests, reprisals did not,materialize. © Paul Lowe/Aida Šehović Što te nema, nomadic monument, Potočari/Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, July 11, 2020\n\n20. 36 / / 37 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Aryeh Neier Eventually, The ICTY obtained custody of Milošević who died before his trial was completed. Indeed, over time, the ICTY was able to ap- prehend all those it indicted from all sides in the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia who did not die before they were apprehended. Though the prosecutors for the ICTY, and the judges, made some mistakes along the way that sullied its reputation, on the whole the Tribunal must be considered a success. In indicting those from all parties to the conflicts in the region for the crimes they had com- mitted, it demonstrated its impartiality. Its achievement in securing custody of its indictees ultimately reflected not only the cooperation of external forces such as NATO but the recognition by the govern- ments in the region that it was in their interest to cooperate with the Tribunal. The trials it conducted were fair. The jurisprudence of the Tribunal included some significant advances in international crimi- nal law. And the work of the Tribunal inspired the creation of a num- ber of other bodies, including the International Criminal Court, that have advanced accountability for war crimes worldwide. The most disappointing feature of the ICTY is that its work has not created a more widespread sense of responsibility in the region for the crimes that were committed during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. Many Serbs continue to perceive themselves as the vic- tims in the conflict and even tend to dismiss reports of large scale killing in Srebrenica as a fabrication. To an extent, errors of judgment by personnel of the Tribunal, such as the indictment of Slobodan Mi- lošević at a moment when it appeared the Tribunal was collaborating with NATO, are to blame. Yet it may be that in the long term, the work of the Tribunal will play a different role in thinking in the region. In the years following World War II and the Nuremberg trials, most Germans seem not to have felt a great sense of responsibility for the crimes that were proven at Nuremberg. It was not until twenty or thirty years after World War II that large numbers of Germans be- gan to acquire such a sense of responsibility. Today, more than three quarters of a century after the end of World War II, a sense of re- sponsibility for Nazi crimes is pervasive in Germany and has a large impact on both domestic and international public policy. Nuremberg played an important part because the trials there provided irrefut- able evidence of war crimes. The same may ultimately be a conse- quence of the trials conducted by the ICTY. The success of the British in carrying out arrests had an impact on other NATO forces in Bosnia. American troops also conducted arrests. Though there had been suspicions that French troops were ignoring opportunities because of a secret deal with the Milošević government, they also made a couple of ar- rests. With a significant number of those indicted in custody, many who had not previously taken the ICTY seriously began to see it in a different light. In February 1998, war broke out in another part of the former Yugoslavia, Kosovo. It was quickly marked by war crimes. Elements of a guerrilla force, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), conducted ambushes of Yugoslav troops. The Yugoslav Army responded by carrying out small-scale massacres in a number of villages that were suspected of harboring the guerrillas. Over the next 13 months, more than 100 villages were destroyed. Those killed often included civilians who had not themselves participated in the ambushes. I attempted to persuade the Prosecutor, Judge Louise Arbour, to bring indict- ments against those responsible for the killings of civilians. She declined to do so because she said that she could not identify the leadership pf the KLA and, therefore, could not hold them responsible for war crimes they had committed. I tried to persuade her that both sides in the conflict had an independent responsibility to comply with the laws of war. She should not ignore war crimes that could be prosecuted because she could not proceed with other prosecutions. To no avail. In March 1999, NATO intervened in the war in Kosovo against the forces of the Yugoslav government. By then, Judge Arbour had said that she had acquired the information to go forward with prosecutions of both sides. In May 1999, she indicted Slobodan Milošević, citing the largest of the village massacres as one of the crimes for which he was responsible. The timing of the indict- ment of Milošević was unfortunate. NATO was bombing Serbia and killing civilians in Serbia as part of its campaign against the Yugoslav military’s ac- tions in Kosovo. The indictment of Milošević at that moment conveyed the impression to many in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that the ICTY was acting as an arm of NATO. Throughout the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, the work of nongovern- mental organizations played a crucial role in documenting the war crimes on whichindictmentswerebased.Althoughseveralorganizationsdidoutstanding work, none was more important that the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Center, founded and directed by Nataša Kandić.

We have been living with the problem of mistrust of the political elite for many years, of course. This is one of the central problems raised when analyzing the crisis of liberal democracy. Is this loss of trust a cause or an ef- fect of the crisis? Is the world changing too fast? Has the neoliberal econom- ic paradigm based on globalization and the accelerated pace of technological development made people feel more and more alienated and helpless? Has the fact that we are more connected and smothered in information than ever before, along with the explosion of fake news and conspiracy theories, led to our inability to distinguish between truth and lies? Can trust be built and sus- tained if many people, perhaps most people, have lost hope: hope in justice, a more secure future, life without fear for oneself and future generations? All of us who care about maintaining a viable democratic order must seek answers to these questions and work to prepare the world and our own soci- eties for the challenges posed by the need for rapid and decisive action when handling climate change, the pivotal crisis of our times. For our region this is perhaps less dramatic than elsewhere on the planet, but climate change has already resulted in long-term detriment to the health of the population and the quality of life, and it is undermining basic human rights as well as the entirety of social development. As far as the future of liberal democracy is concerned, almost all the countries of the world have had to face their own lack of preparedness and vulnerability during the current pandemic; as well, © Goranka Matić, Jelena Šantić at the inauguration of Slobodan Milošević as President of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, July 23, 1997\n\n22. 40 / / 41 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Sonja Licht I believe the time has come for a responsible, courageous elite, those who care far more about addressing the genuine social problems than about election results. Only a political elite with vision, prudence and a focus on the general good—to whom the electorate, with their active involvement in public life, can cede part of their sovereignty in the elections (for a precise- ly defined term in office)—will be able to justify public trust and spearhead what is probably the most serious battle for the future of humanity and our civilization: our struggle to survive. I can already imagine the reactions of many: this is a naive utopia, it is impossible in this day and age. This means that in advance we’re acquiescing to an egotistical, selfish approach to life and a world in which the stronger, wealthier and more powerful have the right to take for themselves everything or nearly everything. And at the same time we’re accepting the fact of people being reduced to mere peons in the hands of the “all-powerful leaders,” who enslave not only institutions and countries, but society as a whole. If this is, indeed, the case, then the next pandemic will find us unprepared, and the average temperature by the end of this century will have risen by 4 °C or more. Most of our planet will have become uninhabitable by then, meaning that we are effectively consenting to dystopia. In his analysis of the lessons from the year of COVID, Yuval Noah Harari says that humanity has shown how it is far from helpless; scientists have proven that fighting the uncontrolled forces of nature is possible, and many of the deaths and much of the suffering have been caused by bad political deci- sions. Unlike politicians, scientists have created an international alliance for the fight against the virus. “If Covid-19 nevertheless continues to spread in 2021 and kill millions, or if an even more deadly pandemic hits humankind in 2030, this will be neither a natural calamity nor a punishment from God. It will be a human failure and—more precisely—a political failure.” (“Lessons from a Year of Covid,” Financial Times, cited from ft.com, 26 February 2021.) This text is not about offering an apocalyptic vision for the 21st century but serves as a reminder of our own potential for taking greater responsibility and grappling with changing our behavior. This is a reminder of moments from my own experience, which demonstrate that when we want to we ca history. The only prerequisite is for us to believe in ourselves and our power to come together and stand up to what seem to be unstoppable forces, while not behaving like individuals who are primarily focused on themselves. First example: 9 March 1991, the first major opposition demonstrations were organized by the Serbian Renewal Movement, with Vuk Drašković at its head, they are seeing that the fundamental legacies of democracy—power-shar- ing, the rule of law, social justice, freedom of speech—are not merely under threat but have already suffered serious setbacks. A sense of solidarity within the primary and immediate community is always, more or less, there, but at the state, international and global levels, this feeling is being fundamentally eroded by the selfish populist policies of the elite and by intrusive, often dan- gerously adversarial, geopolitical interests. Many have rushed to conclude that democracy is less successful than autoc- racy at handling crises like this one. Autocracies must find it easier to adopt and implement radical measures such as lockdowns and total isolation of large urban centers and even of countries, but this brings us back to the ques- tion of trust. Clearly trust cannot be coerced. If radical measures are easier to impose where fear governs instead of responsibility, where the state rules by decree rather than by agreement, where the rule of muscle power overrides the rule of justice, one wonders how, in the future, we’ll be able to deal with more serious challenges such as the worsening pollution of air, water, land, the destruction of forests, the rise in average temperatures, the preserva- tion of an already seriously threatened biodiversity? How will we preserve the planet if not through our awareness of the necessity for collaboration and solidarity, but also through moving away from a consumer society? How will we persuade all people, or at least the vast majority, to engage in mastering the test here and now, without delay, on which the future of humankind relies, but also on which their future and the future of their families depends? The questions multiply, yet answers are few—especially in regards to the challenges. The feeling of the helplessness of the individual when faced with such overwhelming tasks demanding their attention is one of the reasons people are giving up on taking part in public life. “I won’t get involved in some- thing I can’t influence,” is becoming the mantra of many. They start complain- ing only when someone moves to control for profit the streams on which their local ecosystems depend, piping water to mini hydroelectric power plants, or when nuclear or chemical waste is dumped in their neighborhood, or when unregulated landfills begin taking over farmland. Apparently we have to start from the existential dangers threatening the everyday lives of people, with the hope that awareness of the direct link between the local and the global will push our own problems to spill over into the larger struggle for the general good. The question remains of whether we have enough time for such small steps. Do the existing political elites have the readiness and courage to serve as leaders in this struggle? They let public opinion guide them instead of dar- ing to lead. And when they do lead, they often manipulate public opinion.\n\n23. 42 / / 43 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Sonja Licht joined by students who had joined the uprising. This movement lasted 117 days and “took over” the whole country. I remember when I was on my way by car one chilly winter evening from Belgrade to Valjevo. In the middle of nowhere, lit only by the headlights of the occasional passing car, a group of some thirty people were marching along the Ibar highway. They were on their way from one village to the next, feeling they were part of a larger move- ment that aspired to a different, more open Serbia. All over Serbia people marched. At moments the protest had a carnivalesque air, while at others it felt more like the beginning of a civil war. Especially on December 24th, when Slobodan Milošević and his party organized a counter-meeting of their fol- lowers, just as they had in March 1991, this time on Terazije, in the very heart of protest territory and the capital city. With very few police on the streets, there were frequent verbal and also physical confrontations that day. One of the counter-protesters shot a protester in the head. And there were vicious police attacks on the protesters over the next days and months. Four people lost their lives during the protests, and over 500 were injured. The key slogan of the uprising was “Belgrade is the world.” “Between the cosmopolitan am- bitions and bleak reality of Belgrade and Serbia at the time yawned a rift so vast and painful that it soon became the first great crack within the Slobodan Milošević regime.” (Filip Ejdus, “Belgrade is the World,” Politika, 11 Septem- ber 2011.) In early February 1997, Milošević ordered the Serbian government to pass a lex specialis by urgent procedure, which would recognize the results of local elections at the recommendation of an OSCE team led by Felipe Gonzales, Spain’s long-standing prime minister. In over 30 cities, including Belgrade, the opposition then came into power. Zoran Đinđić became mayor of Bel- grade. Only a few months later, the Zajedno coalition fell apart: on 21 Septem- ber 1997, Vuk Drašković’s Serbian Renewal Movement encouraged voters to vote in the election, while Zoran Đinđić’s Democratic Party and Vesna Pešić’s Civic Alliance (these being the trio who had led the civil protests), with an- other 14 opposition parties, boycotted it because of grave irregularities in the election process. In coalition with Vojislav Šešelj’s Serbian Radical Party, Slobodan Milošević once again won his place in the government. And the political elite once again utterly betrayed the expectations and trust of their constituents. Third example: Slobodan Milošević’s defeat in the election for President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (only Serbia and Montenegro at the time) on September 24th and then after the “democratic revolution” on 5 October 2000. after the introduction of the multiparty political system. The central demand was the resignation of the director of Belgrade Radio and Television because of its systematic dissemination of lies and libel. The massive size of the demonstration far outstripped what the organizers themselves had been ex- pecting and it grew into a protest against the regime that was associated with Slobodan Milošević. Drašković addressed the demonstrators from the terrace of the National Theater, as did quite a number of representatives of the Dem- ocratic Party and prominent public intellectuals. After a brutal police inter- vention, the deaths of a student and a member of the police force, and the ar- rest of Vuk Drašković, there were calls for the minister of the police to resign. That same evening Milošević brought tanks out onto the streets of Belgrade. This was the first hint of the wars to come in Yugoslavia; the formal, bloody collapse began 98 days later. Ignoring the threats, students gathered the next day on Terazije, the square at the very center of the capital city, and only one day later, Milošević’s Socialist Party of Serbia organized a counter-meeting barely a kilometer as the crow flies from the students’ “velvet revolution.” So we witnessed games being played with a clash evocative of civil war. Luckily, most of those attending the counter-meeting were not prepared to lock horns with the “hooligans” on Terazije. The students dispersed on March 14th, af- ter Vuk Drašković was released from prison, resignations were tendered by the director of Radio and Television and the minister in charge of the police, and B92, the independent radio station, and Studio B of Belgrade Television were allowed back on the air. The March 9th demonstrations and the student demonstrations proved that there was a spireted defiance against autocrat- ic rule and the repression of the free media, and this was adequate for the winning of partial victories, but inadequate to stop the people and processes leading to the war and to the thirtieth anniversary of the protest, journal- ist Momčilo Turudić reminds us that we never learned what Franjo Tuđman and Slobodan Milošević agreed to during their meeting on 25 March 1991 at Karađorđevo, “but from what transpired, we can easily guess. It would appear that they decided that they couldn’t let the government be threatened by huge demonstrations like the one on March 9th, so it would be better to distract people with other concerns.” (Vreme, 4 March 2021.) Second example: On 19 November 1996, local elections were stolen in Ser- bia. After ten years of the Milošević regime, after wars, hyperinflation, pyr- amid schemes, after threats to basic civil rights, to the right to elect one’s representative, the people came out onto the streets, first in the city of Niš, and then in most of the cities in Serbia. The protests grew into a movement under the leadership of Zajedno (Together), the opposition coalition, and were\n\n24. 44 / / 45 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Sonja Licht Twenty years after October 5th there are still debates and disagreements over what that day meant and why an “October 6th” never dawned, meaning why there wasn’t an appetite for Serbia to embrace democratic transition and membership in the European Union. To return, once more, to Miodrag Ranković, the workers had paid the greatest price for the “questionable pri- vatizations” (as the European Commission has referred to them in their an- nual reports), the sale of social and state property for a pittance, destruction of the industrial plants that had made it intact through the 1990s. Ranković says that he quickly saw things were not proceeding as they should, that “Đinđić and Koštunica did not share the same political vision… One was pull- ing westward while the other pulled to the east… We all expected that our life would be better and saw that this was happening slowly, very slowly; but had October 5th never happened that would be a terrible shame.” Although ev- erybody is disappointed with October 5th, Ranković tells the BBC journalist, it did bring with it something sorely needed—a peaceful transition of power. Why was the path to a democratic transformation and European perspective for Serbia and most of the Balkan countries—the ones called the Western Balkans—so slow? After the fall of the Berlin Wall, while the post-socialist countries were going through rapid changes, Yugoslavia was falling to piec- es. Even the path taken by the other countries was not without nationalistic, anti-Semitic and anti-Gypsyist attacks, such as Vladimir Mečiar in Slovakia, István Csurka in Hungary, Vadim Tudor in Romania. The tragedy of Yugo- slavia, toiling and suffocating in wartime destruction, meant that only with the beginning of the new millennium could it breathe more freely, when a democratic, European perspective too hold for the first time all across the Western Balkans. This was confirmed in the autumn of 2003 by the sum- mit of the European Union in Thessaloniki, when the highest representatives of the member countries announced that the future of the countries of the Western Balkans was with them. This is when enthusiasm for joining the EU was at its highest in all the countries of the region, when it appeared to be merely a question of time before the entire Balkans would be an integral part of the democratic European community. There was also a growing conviction that having found a common denominator and shared goal, these societies would overcome their difficult past legacy and muster the strength neces- sary to collaborate in building a political culture and institutions to secure the sustainable democratic development of each country individually and of the region as a whole. But the particular interests of the political elites fueled their readiness to stir up nationalistic hatreds and a sense of the threat coming from “others” in Two laws adopted in 1998, which effectively abolished all autonomy at the universities and introduced open repression of the media, were the crown- ing achievements of Slobodan Milošević’s autocratic rule. His wife Mirjana Marković was by then openly sharing power with him. She was head of the Yugoslav United Left party. In late March of that same year there was an outbreak of open hostilities in Kosovo that culminated with the bombing by NATO forces from March to June 1999. The opposition tried several times to unite; in 1998 the Alliance for Change was formed, and then it merged with the Democratic Opposition of Serbia in 2000. This was also when the Serbian Renewal Movement, initially the strongest party within the opposi- tion, lost stature by aggravating the already serious difficulties faced by the opposition parties when they tried to take a joint stand. In April 1999, jour- nalist Slavko Ćuruvija, one of the most vocal critics of Slobodan Milošević, was murdered and anti-regime demonstrations started in August, continuing with hardly any interruption. Tensions were on the rise throughout Serbia. Ivan Stambolić was murdered just a month before the elections of Septem- ber 2000. He had been Slobodan Milošević’s political “father,” and may have been murdered out of fear that he might, at the last moment, step into the leading role in the opposition and pull it together behind him. The forces of the fractious opposition were, however, united by the Otpor (Resistance) student movement, which grew in mid-2000 to become a nation-wide resis- tance movement. The clenched fist of the movement and the slogan “He’s finished” were seen all over the country. The Otpor activists made the opposi- tion parties swear that they’d line up against Milošević; with the civil society organizations and the independent media, they created a climate which, on the eve of October 5th, made possible a country-wide general strike. The miners from Kolubara, who supplied the city of Belgrade and a large part of Serbia with electrical power, went on strike on September 29th. “All of what happened on October 5th revolved around Kolubara,” said Miodrag Ranković, president of the Surface Miners’ Union, on BBC News Serbian. When asked why he joined the strike, Ranković said, “Because Milošević destroyed our entire generation.” (Slobodan Maričić, “October 5th, 20 Years Later: The Days When Serbia Stopped,” BBC News Serbian, 29 September 2020). By October 5th, almost everyone, even several state institutions, had joined the general strike, and hundreds of thousands of people poured into Belgrade. A day lat- er, Milošević was forced to concede to Vojislav Koštunica, the candidate for the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, who became the new President of Yu- goslavia. After the December 2000 elections in Serbia, Zoran Đinđić became Serbia’s Prime Minister.\n\n25. 46 / / 47 30 YEARS / OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS FRIENDS 30 YEARS / Sonja Licht later, after the polling places closed, as Terazije filled with people who were marching in a spontaneous protest against the stealing of local elections. I promised myself then that never again would I pass judgment on what might happen in politics and when it might hap- pen. But I never lost my faith in people, that they’ll find the strength in themselves, despite stumbles and deadlocks, to fight for the es- sential values on which the future of our civilization depends. This is why I am ending with a quote from an interview with Ivan Vejvoda: “Threatened democracy and the struggle against those who threaten it depends on the activities of the citizens. In the darkest times in Eu- rope, during Fascism and Nazism, there were those who fought for freedom, even when the situation seemed desperate and hopeless. A sense of a way forward, the use of the right to vote in elections, won sometimes through bloody, historic, battles on the streets, is key for the functioning of democracy.” (“The Temptation of Democracy and the Pandemic: The People’s Mistrust Will Bring Down the Apostles of Populism,” Novi magazin, 29 November 2020).

The process of privatization was rash and non-trans- parent (predatory). This resulted in surging corruption and a lack of broad and open dialogue within the societies; privatization was initiated before the necessary institutions had been formed and the rule of law enforced. All this eroded people’s trust—both in politicians and in the success of the demo- cratic transition. This condition was then aggravated by the major financial crisis of 2008–2009, imported from the center of neoliberal capitalism, which further weakened the social cohesion necessary for the survival of hope and faith in change. Loss of faith in the certainty of a European outcome was heightened by the lack of readiness among the European partners to sup- port the courageous and decisive moves of individual politicians at pivotal moments, as was the case when Đinđić hoped to accelerate the resolution of the Serbia-Kosovo conflict, or when approval was given to begin North Macedonia’s EU accession negotiations in October 2019 after an agreement had been reached with Greece following the decades-long deadlock over the country’s name. All these processes and events motivated people to leave the region. While there was talk, 10 years ago, of a brain drain, the intensity of emigration in the prepandemic years became such that it was deemed more and more of- ten a “tsunami,” particularly in terms of the leaving of medical professionals, but also of all those others for whom there was demand in the European Union and elsewhere. This is why Remzi Lani, well-versed in the situation in his native Albania but also in the Western Balkans, says: “In the Balkans the transition is over…. We transitioned from repressive to depressive regimes.” (Ivan Krastev, “Putin’s Next Playground or the EU’s Last Moral Playground,” The New York Times, 28 January 2019.) What can we expect once the pandemic ends? Will the crisis inspire people to act in the hilly Balkans, to battle against frustration and depression and for their future and that of their children? Or will the accelerated emptying of the region continue, which may pose a serious political problem but also a security threat for the European Union? In closing I have a personal story: Professor Mary Kaldor asked me to speak in Belgrade to a group of her students who had been traveling with her through the region. They wanted me to talk with them about the political situation. I told them, among other things, that apathy was rampant and no changes could be expected any time soon.

This was nothing out of the ordinary for our family, typical of the emerging middle class in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The first trained doctors, professors, engineers, officers who earned degrees from universities and vocational schools traversed the Monarchy and sur- rounding areas in pursuit of employment, military service, love, or simply adventure and new experiences. The collapse of the Monarchy in 1918 found them scattered everywhere from Austria to Bulgaria. Some were brought down by malaria in the Macedonian lands at the close of World War I, sever- al others vanished in Galicia, but most of them ended up living somewhere within their first “European Union”—the Austrian monarchy. This is why no one was surprised when relatives with unusual names suddenly appeared, wearing, for instance, a brooch that was nearly identical to one my grand- mother wore, or having physical features resembling those of our immediate family. Older family members knew all about them, of course, though they may not have met in person. But for us, children, these encounters were al- ways a mixture of the exotic and the intimate and a chance for us to hear sto- ries about how our grandmother’s grandfather had come from Poland with a family of twelve children, and how somehow through them we kept a finger dipped in the ocean that was our part of Europe. Those were different times and the Bulgarian relatives couldn’t even send letters to us in Yugoslavia for many years after World War II, let alone travel to visit us in Zagreb. But in the late 1960s or early 1970s, Penčo and Marie ppeared with their three children, all close to me in age. They spoke Bulgarian, Russian and a little French, while my brother and I spoke not a word of any of these. But the relative sim- ilarity among the Slavic languages made it possible for us to communicate in Croatian–Bulgarian–Russian; with gestures, pantomime, and drawing we tried to tell each other about ourselves and our lives.
