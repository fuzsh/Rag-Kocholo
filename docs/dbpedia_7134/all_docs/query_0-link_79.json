Answer : I believe that the international situation is on the way to be put into motion after years of stagnation. Thus there 'is a possibility to create new and eventually more favourable conditions for the future. Question : What will the Austrian Government attempt to do in order to contribute to an as rapid as possible realisation of the State Treat 3 r concerning Austria? Answer s The Austrian Government strives that the Austrian St ate Treaty should be solved by way of diplomatic \"negotiations, so that finally occupation of Austria might end. which is deprived of every legal basis and which is lasting for the past seven years* If direct negotiations between the four great powers do not show timely results which we expect, we intend to present- all these problems before the United Nations*.

From this point of view, the Organisation of the United Nations has justified -its existance. It was proved that the jcy of millions of people was not in vain when they heard the words addressed to the world from t the tribune of the War Veterans' Building in fan Franciscos \"Wo, member nations of the United Nations have decided to protect the future generations from ravages of war which twice during our lifetime caused immasurable misery to humanity and to strengthen again the belief in the basic human rights, in the dignity and value of the person .lily of nan,,, n \" The Organisation of the United Nations war. created on the bitter experiences cf uhe League oi Nations, It was known that words thrown on the paper, however solemn they might peer., are not sufficient to protect peace in the world. And this very recog- nition of this fact was the best sign that this -ntw o’; gin ‘ration from the very first days of its existence avoided going astray. Kemcriss of ; Abyssinia, Munich ; and all that happened after- wards was still fresh in the minds of people who in the name of their nations signed the Charter, The Organisation of the United Nations was put to a hard trial by the exoansicnist policy of the USSR when it spurred North Korea 2 years ago to enter into ar. aggressive adventure. This was the most mean attempt to undermine the Organisation of the United Nations and peace in the world. The Soviet Union, whose represen- tative at the conference in San Francisco, after the signature of the Charter and the creation of the Organisation of the United Nations, • spid:that\"peaceloving rations which in this war suffered enormously put their hopes in the newly-crested international organ which will be able with collective power to prevent a repe- tition of a new tragedy of humanity\" - had the attempt to dis- credit this organisation in cne move and kill faith which people and states pCais in it. However, the account is ’wrong. The United Nations have not yielded before this threat, A blow was answered by a blow. Aggression was stopped however at the price of great sacrifices and the aggressor and those who spurred him to aggression have received a well-earned lesson end with it the confirmation that - so long as the United Nations a re united ir. the defence cf common interests and the basic principles of the Charter, aggression is not a profitable affair. The Korean a dventure has opened the eyes also of those men who, lulled by Soviet propaganda, believed that the UooK does not desire war. And they have become ; - convinced that the threads of \"cold\" and \"warm\" war start fi om Moscow arid that only collective co-operr.ti<- i ord the decisiveness of the pcacoloving nations can suppress every a : tempt at aggression and prevent a new world wr.

In the same way, he ordered officials of the Hungarian Legation to refuse.to receive the Yugoslav Note which was on 25th June sent three times during the afternoon by a courier to the Hungarian Legation, It was pointed out to the Hungarian Charge d T Affaires that such imper- missible acts in diplomatic practice can have only unfavourable consequences and that the Ministry expects that the Hungarian Charge d ?

On this occasion the allocation of the secc::^ part of the loan which the International Bank will give to Yugoslavia will be dis- cussed. The first part of the loan was approved at the beginning of October 1951 when 2d million dollars were allocated to Yugoslavia. In the past & months our country has concluded an agreement with different countries out of which Yugoslavia will buy equipment for key objectives on the basis of this loan. Our country will buy in the USA installations to the value of 4,$44 ? 000 dollars, from Western Germany for 5,33/6,000 ■ dollars , from France for more than 10^ 5Q9yOOO dollars, Belgium, Great Britain, Denmark and Holland come after the above-mentioned countries in regard to value of goods to be bought from the first part of the loan 0 The amount of the second part of the loan which we will get from the International Bank for balancing our payments balance is not yet known. In order to obtain its balance by 1955, it is desirable that the International Bank should allocate in good time as /great ras loan as possible because our country in the whole programme of the construction of key objectives still needs equipment for about B0 million dollars. Therefore from the volume of financing the building of this remaining^ part depends also the balance of our balance payments and in this way the further economic strengthening of Yugoslavia, (PO LITI KA - 27th June, 1952).

This does not mean that the law covers all possible solu- tions, nor does it mean that no new problems will arise in practice, or that all its items are perfect* It is sure that the value of this law will depend on the eongruebce of the basic principles of organi- zation and wcrk provided for by this law with the organization and functioning of the peopled committee In practice* Congruence l©S a l norms with reality Is not only a criterion with respect to realisation of the law but also In regard to actual effect of the law in the matter of material and cultural development of our municipalities , cities and districts as well as strengthening of institutions of the people s self government within same© The problem of putting this law into effect is more complicated than the problem of realizing basic federal laws© While the realiza- tion of these laws, as a rule, Is reduced to application of the law or to taking of organizational, personal, material, legal measures and procedures for the purpose of putting into effect legal norms, the new law pertaining to people’s committees, along with its appli- cation, Includes also problems of further legal realization of its principles# I shall dwell on both problems in this article© I must stress, however, that the application of the new law pertaining to people’s committees differs somewhat from the application of state laws or federal laws not falling under tho category of general laws© Problems to be treated and particularly solutions to be given in connection therewith are necessarily of a United and conditional character. This is due to the fact that state laws pertaining to people’s committees, as well as other laws, will fully reveal all problems with respect to application, because they will extend the system of legal norms© Considering the fact, however, that tho basic principles of the federal law must be realized by state laws, thi3 pointing to problems of applying the federal law pertaining to people s committees is not merely of a geharal character© Finally, another mention has to be made© Until state laws per- taining to people’s committees are passed, the principles ol the new federal law will not all be realized. They will be realized only when the new people’s committees are elected on the basis of new state laws. This, however, should not prevent ub from considering all the more important problems with respect to application of the federal law* The more so, the elections for the new people’s committees will most probably be held In the course of this year© Besides, a series of basic principles of the federal law on people s committees are already being applied on the basis of state laws pertaining to orga- nization of people’s committees issued In April 1952a Approved For Release 2002/08/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 23001 10009-3 • Approved For Release 2002/08/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 23001 10009-3 - 21 - THE MARKET AND TRADE • Retail trade in the period January-Mey of this year amounted to 121,044 million dinars, which represents about 40$ of the provided .for annual retail trade. From this amount about 25 % consists of trade in foodstuffs, and 75$ of industrial goods. According to months the retail trade in this period was as follows: in January 20,115 million dinars (index 100/ , in February 22,540 million dinars (index 112), in March 25,414 million dinars (index 126), in April 26,000 million dinars (index 139) and in May 24,125 million dinars (index 124). The prominently weaker trade in January and February and the increase in trade in the other three months (particularly March and April) is explained by the fact that the consumers spent at the end of last year to a great extent their bu in: means, on account of which they somewhat restrained themselves in January and February from buying - while the increase of trade in the remaining 3 months represents the stabilisation of the situation in the consumers' demand and is partly also the result of the spring season. Such an achievement in trade for the past period (40$ of the annual planned trade) points out to a somewhat changed situation in regard to last year, when for the same >eriod of time a much smaller portion of the total annual trade was achieved - and this means that in this year one should not expect that the trade in the last Quarter of the year will be greater to that extent from the trade of the ^previous quarters as was the case.-, last year. The reason for the uniformity of trade according to quotas in this year lies in the fact that in the forthcoming quarter there will be most probably no stagnation in trade - which is otherwise normal for this period of the vear - because the sale of goods byway of consumer credits and credits for the purchase of fuel, as well as the decrease of prices of industrial goods which are not in demand, for which the state has allocated subsidies to the trade network (a total of about 5 billion dinars) and the abolition of purchase coupons - will influence to a great extent the revival of trade in the next few months.

THE USE OF SUBSIDIES FOR THE LOWERING OF PRICES OF GOODS WHICH ARE HflTTlN DEMAND The problem of sale of goods which are not in demand boils down in fact to the question of a right use of turnover means and on the question. of the level of expenses in trade, in regard to the new rate of interest. Goods which remain in stock for a long time in enterprises binds a portion of turnover means and makes them unemployable for normal circulation. The rates of interest on such means, which are now much greater than formerly, become month in month out an expenditure which seriously increases expenses of trade, . Particularly so under conditions of the new wages system, which is based on differences in orice, material and other expenses of the enterprise influence the level of the wages fund of the employees . . Therefore, the stocks of goods which are not in demand deprease directly the wages fund of the employees in trade, Therefore each enterprise and its complete workers' collective is interested .in liberating itself from stocks which are not in demand. Means obtained need not be used immediately Trade enterprises have received in the past few days subsidies from the State for the decrease of prices of goods which are not in demand i This measure should eliminate ultimately the conse- quences of the former distributive system in trade and to make possible for the enterprises normal, trading in the future. The use of thus obtained subsidies which suits best the interests, ^epresentsi a problem* which must occupy the attention of workers' collectives and executive organs of all’ trad*, enterprises. Practice has shown in the last few days already certain defficienc.es in regard to the employ of obtained subsidies - which are contrary to the correctly conceived interests of the enterprise. In the first place, subsidies, when the enterprise has already obtained them, lose the character of outside means and become a component part of the turn over means of the enterprise on which the State -has no pretentions to get them back. And this means that the obtained means need not be necessarily used at any price immediately to the full extent. If the momentary situation of the enterprise does not require to engage fully the means ot disposal in this period, the enterprise should not lower prices to such an extent, which get the character of spoiling prices in order to achieve a transitory and shortlived increase of trade. Another occurrence of wrongly conceived proper interests which has been remarked is that some enterpries use in a linear manner means for lowering the price of a large number of articles , so ti-.-.t . with really. unsalable goods the lowering of prices is not sufficient to revive the sale of these articles, while with articles which are in demand the lowering of price • not at all necessary. How. some .enterprises, used incorrectly subsidies, The most serious irregularity while lowering prices was ma4e by those enterprises, which have carried out this decrease in pripe or normal saleable goods, while the prices of goods which are not In demand and who are in stock for a long time because of high prices and poor quality, were not at all decreased .

Mosa Pijade, Vice-President of tne ■ Praesidium of the People-^ s Assembly of the FPRY gave, a lectupe. con- cerning ’the pre-draft, of the Law on the .Constitution concerning tne Supreme, Federal, Republican and autonomous organs of authority at the Mathematical Faculty in Belgrade* At the beginning, Mosa.

This is a guarantee that our revolu- tion will not be distorted* Another important characteristic is that the central organs will keep only those functions which cannot be .'execute:*! by the basic organs of the People’s Authority, functions which belong to the whole society as a whole and which must 'be executed in a democratic manner. The project has the intention that the principle of uniformity of authority - a principle whose values were understood during the war and proclaimed already in Jajce at the Second Session of the AVN0J - concerning a matter which is more real than it- wasethe case at present* This has to be secured by the role of the People’s Assembly as the sovereign supreme organ of authority, which con- centrates in itself both legislative functions and executive authority through its proper organs. The basic project will be devoted mainly to federal organs of authority * In a few words only, so to speak, in a few 'sentences, this project will refer to Republican and autonomous organs of authority, as much as to give the most basic principles which would secure the uniformity of the system in the whole state. All the rest has to be .produced by the republics themselves, through their basic laws, and by autonomous units through their statutes. In the first place stands the People’s Assembly as the represen- tative body of the people of our country, as the supreme executor of its sovereign rights and as the supreme organ of authority in the framework of those rights which belong to federations,-’ Strict attention is paid that the sovereignty of our 6 republics must be respected and that nothing should be taken for the federation which could not be executed by the- republics themselves or by lower organs* r District and town deputies will be elected directly by the electors* The number of inhabitants which will elect one deputy has not been e stablished as yet. Most probably we shall keep to the project that one deputy should come for every 70,000 inhabitants. Thus we would have' . about 2S0 district and town deputies to which, number one should add 83 republican and autonomous deputies because each republic -would elect 12, while the Voj.vodina 7 and, the Kosmet 4 respectively, namely - only 83 , so that the Federal Council in its full composition would have about 36 O or so deputies. If we add to this that the Producers’ Councils according to the project should have half or up to 2/3 of the number of deputies in the Federal Council, this would be yet an assembly of more than 530-540 deputies. Mosa Pi jade went on to say .that the mandate of the d eputies of the Producers’ Council should last two years and concerning their number, according to the population of a republic, and speaking later concerning the committees of the Assembly’s Councils he said that the pre-draft has not elaborated sufficiently their competence. Too much attention has been paid to the Committees of the Praesidium, so that one has got the wrong impression that in the case of the existence of these committees of the Praesidium the Assembly's Committees would be superfluous, that they would not have anything to do, an impression was formed that the Praeisidium has become some sort of a government.
