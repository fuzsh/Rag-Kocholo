        "text": "Reading & Writing at Fool’s Paradise\n\n|\n\nWriting for more hours of my days at Fool’s Paradise than I imagined possible left little time for reading and for those intense four weeks I had little interest in any fiction beyond my own. I did, however read three books: Doris McCarthy: Ninety Years Wise by Doris McCarthy Celebrating Life: The Art of Doris…\n\nRead More →\n\nI Am A Writer, I Am A Photographer\n\n|\n\nEvery writer I know has had trouble making the statement “I am a writer.” I can say it now — after 30+ years spent writing — on most days. I’ve been making photographs for a shorter time. Taking them for a long time, yes. Making them, no. So I am not yet comfortable saying “I…\n\nRead More →\n\nFinding the Light\n\n|\n\nOften when I’m walking in the woods near our home, I’m struck by the light filtering through leaves, hitting the trunks of trees, or the water, a heron perched on a log, or a rocky cliff on a distant shore. I sometimes take pictures at such moments and this week I’ve started an online photography…\n\nRead More →\n\nWhere do you like to work?\n\n|\n\nThe third in my series of sister-inspired posts this summer is about the kinds of environments people like to write in — a topic I’ve touched on in the past but with a different slant this time. Some people thrive on having lots of stuff around them when they’re working. For others, having too much…\n\nRead More →\n\n5 Songs for a Desert Island\n\n|\n\nThis second post in this summer’s series of three was inspired by my sister’s blog post about her answer to a question put to her by a prospective client: What 5 songs would you want to have with you if you were trapped on a desert island? This of course got me to thinking about…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Holiday in Your Honour\n\nThis summer my blog will feature of series of posts inspired by my sister. (This is not the first time she has inspired me.) In a recent blog post of her own, she mentioned a question she posed to her followers on Facebook: If a holiday was named in your honour, what would it commemorate,…\n\nRead More →\n\nOne Woman’s Story About Red\n\nSince the publication of Red is Best I’ve been treated to all kinds of stories from people of all ages about their experiences with the colour red. This spring I was privileged to hear one of the most moving of such stories. At a volunteer appreciation event at the CNIB, I had the pleasure of…\n\nRead More →\n\nHow to Write a Picture Book\n\nOn Today’s Parent’s recent list of the 100 best Canadian kids’ books of all time are two books by yours truly — my first and my most recent, both of them award-winning picture books. Next year will see the publication of my 12th picture book, being illustrated right now by the wonderful Qin Leng. A…\n\nRead More →\n\nWrite for a Better World – Choosing a Winner\n\n|\n\nWorld Literacy Canada does some fine work “to promote literacy and foster a culture of global citizenship among Canadians”. I had the opportunity recently to judge stories by students in grades 5 to 8 who entered WLC’s “Write for a Better World” contest. Reading 20 of the hundreds of entries and narrowing them down to…\n\nRead More →\n\nNational Volunteer Week\n\n|\n\nNext week is National Volunteer Week — originally designated in 1943 to recognize “the vital contribution women made to the war effort on the home front”. Studies indicate that volunteers generally like to be thanked but I suspect that what matters most to many volunteers (like me) is the satisfaction of knowing one is making…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Writer's Scribbles\n\n|\n\nEver wondered what’s in some of those little notebooks writers interrupt conversations, or suddenly sit up in bed, to scribble in? As the year draws to a close, I’m going to give you a peek at a sampling of my 2011 scribbles, with remarks added at the time of this posting in square brackets. 4/4/11…\n\nRead More →\n\nDo you get along well with your publishers?\n\nHere I am with Margie Wolfe at a party in spring 2006. Her company, Second Story Press, published King of the Castle (for readers of all ages) and 101 Ways to Dance. Margie and I don’t always agree about everything, but we get along famously just the same. (Thanks to Naseem Hrab for permission to use…\n\nRead More →\n\n“An Intimate Examination of Sock Fluff” Part 1\n\n“Spectacular!” “Inspiring!” Two words people used to describe my keynote speech at CANSCAIP’s Packaging Your Imagination conference last month. Pretty gratifying feedback! You missed it? Fear not! I’m going to post the whole speech here at “Turning the Pages.” “Sock Fluff” was my introduction to Loris Lesynski, back in the early 90s, before it was…\n\nRead More →\n\nDo you ever visit book clubs?\n\nI haven’t done it often, but within a reasonable distance from my home in Rockwood (which is near Guelph) Ontario, I do. So far I’ve only met with adult book clubs, but I think it would be fun to meet with mother-daughter, mother-son, father-daughter, father-son groups too. Depending on who your book club members are,…\n\nRead More →\n\nDid you create your own website?\n\n|\n\nI wanted a website that would help promote me and my books, but I had no idea about how to set one up, and wasn’t willing to take time away from my writing to learn. Luckily for me, my sister knew how to do it. Creating websites is part of her business. Since setting up…\n\nRead More →\n\nWill you come and speak at our conference?\n\nIf your audience is teachers, librarians, booksellers, writers, parents, students, or seniors, chances are I’d love to come talk about just about any aspect of writing, reading, or being a writer in Canada. I’m more than open to suggestions. In addition to the speaking fee, conference organizers should be prepared to cover the cost of…\n\nRead More →\n\nThree Trees for Highway of Heroes\n\n|\n\nAll across Canada, each school year, thousands of students read books that appear on “tree award” lists and, come spring, vote on their favourites. I’ve been lucky enough to have had several of my books nominated over the years: King of the Castle (Silver Birch) One Year Commencing (Red Cedar) Marie-Claire: Dark Spring (Diamond Willow)…\n\nRead More →\n\nHave you met any other authors?\n\nI sure have! Most of the people in the photo here are authors. A few are illustrators. How many can you identify? Can you find me in there? All but one of the authors lives in Canada. Can you find her? She’s really famous! Meeting and hanging out with other authors is one of the great…\n\nRead More →\n\nWhat kind of books did you like to read when you were growing up?\n\n|\n\nStories about families, about real people, or at least people that felt real to me reading about them. I loved: the books about Beezus and Henry and Ramona by Beverly Cleary (those that had been written when I was young. I caught up with more Ramona books when my kids were young) the Little House…\n\nRead More →\n\nDo you speak to teachers on their professional development days?\n\nYes, and it’s always a pleasure. (I was an elementary school teacher myself, before I was a writer.) I can discuss how to motivate students to write, how to excite them about reading, or I can conduct a mini-writing workshop, as a model for how teachers might like to work with their students, at any…\n\nRead More →\n\nHow can we arrange a visit to our school or library?\n\nIt’s easy. Just send Kathy an email! But before you do, it’s best to first read about audience sizes and the cost of hosting a visit. Also about the kinds of things I might do with your students and the impact our visit might have. Find answers to other FAQs here.\n\nRead More →\n\nDid you like to write when you were a kid?\n\nNot especially. I wrote stories in school, but not after school or on weekends, like some kids do. And I certainly didn’t think about being a writer when I grew up. But I did love to read, and I think that all the books I was reading over many years were turning me into a writer,…\n\nRead More →\n\nHow do you pick the illustrator for your picture books?\n\nI don’t pick the illustrator for my books. The publisher does. They may ask for my opinion about the work of illustrators they’re considering, but the decision is ultimately up to them. What if you don’t like the pictures? I’ve been lucky to have illustrators who have brought wonderful visual ideas to the books, ideas that…\n\nRead More →\n\n\"So You Want to Write a Children’s Book\"\n\n|\n\nTo me, he’s my sweetie Petey, my life partner of 26 years. He’s the dad of my stepdaughters, the stepdad of my own kids, and Grampa to our grandkids. To the community of writers of books for young people in Canada, Peter Carver is a writing teacher extraordinaire, an astute and caring editor, a trusted…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Star for Starfall\n\nI’m doing as much editing as writing these days. One of the projects I’ve been working on as editor is a picture book collaboration between two newcomers to the world of children’s books, Diana Kolpak and Kathleen Finlay. Pretty satisfying to see a starred review (from galleys) for Starfall in the September issue of Q&Q!…\n\nRead More →\n\nDo you write full-time now, or do you have another job, too?\n\nI do my best to write full-time, but I don’t earn enough money from book sales to make a full income, so I do other things – related to writing – to make up what I need. I work as an editor. I lead writing workshops for adults and for children. I speak at conferences.…\n\nRead More →\n\nCongratulations Again, Cornelia!\n\nTo her long list of awards recognizing her achievements, Cornelia Hahn Oberlander can add the Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe Award – the highest honor in her profession. The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) presented the award to Cornelia in Zurich in June. Cornelia first set her sights on becoming a landscape architect when she was…\n\nRead More →\n\nDo you have any pets?\n\nUpdated April 2016. Yes! I had a wonderful dog named Keisha for almost ten years. She was a golden doodle. She’s practically famous because the illustrator of A Pocket Can Have A Treasure In It used Keisha as a model for the puppy in the story. Now I have another golden doodle. Her name is Georgia. Never heard…\n\nRead More →\n\nHow old are you?\n\nI turned 50 in 2002, so now I’m… Yikes! How did that happen? Find answers to other FAQs here.\n\nRead More →\n\nHow old are your children now?\n\nI’m going to let you figure that out. Matthew (inspiration for Big Or Little?) was born in 1975 and Kelly (inspiration for Red Is Best and “Babysitting Helen“) was born in 1978. This picture of my kids was taken at Matt’s wedding in 2001. I also have two stepdaughters born in 1967 and 1968 and…\n\nRead More →\n\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up?\n\nWhen I was growing up in the 1960s, most girls were looking at pretty limited options: nurse, teacher, or secretary. I liked school, so I wanted to be a teacher. I taught elementary school in Etobicoke (as far west as you can go in Toronto before you hit Mississauga) for five years. I also wanted…\n\nRead More →\n\nCan you help me get published?\n\nI have no ins with any of the publishers I’ve worked with as a writer or as an editor, so beyond encouraging you to continue honing your craft (by writing lots and perhaps attending classes or workshops), there’s nothing else I can do to help you get published. However, there are lots of websites that offer…\n\nRead More →\n\nReading Liberia – June 2011\n\n|\n\nJune 2011 presented me with the opportunity to work for a third time with Liberian writers through workshops and one-on-one meetings – thanks to CODE (Canada) and to We Care (Liberia). The president of the country, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, expressed an interest in participating in the launch of the first Liberian-authored, Liberian-illustrated children’s books. She…\n\nRead More →\n\nIs my ship sinking?\n\n|\n\nSometimes I wonder if there’s a comparison between writers writing in the early 21st century and the passengers in The Poseidon Adventure. Some passengers on the sinking Poseidon insisted on staying put, believing that someone would come and save them. Others insisted on taking matters into their own hands on what they knew was a…\n\nRead More →\n\nWhat do you like writing better? Picture books or novels?\n\nI love the spareness of a picture book, paring down sentences to their bare essentials. It’s a bit like writing poetry. But I also like being involved with characters for long enough to get to know them really well, the way I do when writing a novel, and I like trying convey them through words…\n\nRead More →\n\nMy Dad, Doug Powell\n\n|\n\nMy dad’s birthday is this week. I wrote this post about him in response to a challenge to “blog about great parents”. My dad didn’t tell me how to live a life of courage and integrity. He showed me, in how he lived his. When I was nine, and my siblings four and fourteen, he…\n\nRead More →\n\nThe Fallen Canadian Soldier Project\n\nI’ve blogged before about different ways Canadians have honoured fallen soldiers. But this winter I learned of another, after a neighbour attending a woodworking show with her husband came upon a display of portraits of Canadian soldiers who have fallen in Afghanistan. Stephen Gaebel describes the first time his paintings were exhibited publicly – on Remembrance…\n\nRead More →\n\n\"Lead with your heart\"\n\nIt’s still just once a week that I login at Yoga Today for an hour of yoga practice – usually on Monday morning, before I get back into my work and think I’m too busy to fit it in. But there’s one instruction that the women leading the online classes offer that stays with me…\n\nRead More →\n\nTPL’s First and Best!\n\n|\n\nHurray! Toronto Public Library has chosen A Pocket Can Have A Treasure In It for their 2008 “First and Best” list. That’s a list of the best Canadian children’s books for building reading readiness in children birth to five. To see the 2007 list, click here.\n\nRead More →\n\nA Sister Visit\n\n|\n\nToday my sister is coming. I’m pretty excited because she hasn’t been here since the day after we moved in, when she did a great job helping me get our new kitchen organized. We instituted what we call our “sister visits” a number of years ago, when we discovered that much as we enjoy visiting in…\n\nRead More →\n\nSettling In\n\n|\n\nWe moved house a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve had lots of people ask how we’re “settling in” and how we’re enjoying the new place. I’m really enjoying getting set up here, but I’m also very much looking forward to just “being” here – writing, reading, doing puzzles, and of course taking Keisha for…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Word on the Street Surprise\n\nIt’s always nice when a fan of one’s books comes up to you at the end of a reading, and yesterday at Word on the Street was especially so. At the end of a long afternoon of reading and signing, on a gorgeous fall afternoon, a woman sat down beside me in the Little Reader’s…\n\nRead More →\n\nCome See Me at \"Word on the Street\"\n\nYes, I’m back from summer holidays, have now moved house, and on Sunday I’ll be reading at Word on the Street in Toronto. Come find me there and you might even meet some of the inspiration for some of my books.\n\nRead More →\n\nSummer Reading\n\n|\n\nWell, it’s off to a great start! This morning I had a million reasons to get up and get going on my day, but I had to stay in bed to finish reading Dooley Takes the Fall by Norah McClintock first. You don’t often see “literary” and “page-turner” together in a review, but both words apply to…\n\nRead More →\n\nSix Word Memoir\n\n|\n\nMy sister Janet, tagged me with the following challenge: Write a six-word memoir. Post it to your blog including a visual illustration if you would like. Link to the person who tagged you in your post and to this original post if possible so we can track it as it travels across the blogosphere. Tag…\n\nRead More →\n\nMore Honours for Cornelia\n\n|\n\nLast week I had the privilege of attending the graduation ceremony at Dalhousie University where Cornelia Oberlander was receiving yet another honorary degree. Giving the convocation address, she spoke the importance of taking risks. To paraphrase: “To make the world a better place, we cannot keep doing things the same old way they have always…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Treasure for My Pocket\n\n|\n\nTwo big surprises at the Literacy Conference in Burlington last weekend. The onsite bookseller, Different Drummer, had on hand a big stack of Love Every Leaf: The Life of Cornelia Hahn Oberlander – and it wasn’t scheduled for release till several days later! (It looks gorgeous, and after I spoke about it briefly during my…\n\nRead More →\n\nI've Got Mail\n\nOnce in a while something lands in your inbox that just makes your day. Such was the case for me recently, when a literacy consultant in Simcoe County wrote to tell me about the impact of my book King of the Castle on her and some people she knows. “I am writing a biography about…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Day Can Have A Surprise In It\n\nMy granddaughter was tickled to see that the book she got from me and her grampa for her 6th birthday – A Pocket Can Have A Treasure In It – had her name in the thanks and dedication. She also received, from both us and a great aunt, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, a wonderful new…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Pocket Can Have A Treasure In It\n\nIt’s now available! My first brand new picture book in sixteen years! Dave Jenkinson at CM (Canadian Materials) – a friend since I did my first Book Week tour in his province (Manitoba) in 1983 and who was sent a review copy – said, “Loved the imagination of it & the wonderful twist at the…\n\nRead More →\n\nSummer Writing Workshop/Retreat by the Sea\n\n|\n\nHow does this sound? Five days in August in a spectacular Nova Scotia setting – indulging in private writing time, walking the beach, getting feedback on your work from me, my partner Peter Carver (children’s book editor for Red Deer Press and teacher of writing for George Brown College), and a small group of fellow…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Not-Typical Day in the Life – December 5\n\n|\n\n6:00 Worked on my novel. Wrote a scene that makes better use of material barely touched on in a previous draft. 7:15 Ate breakfast – yogurt with bananas and almonds and cereal – and did a crossword puzzle. 7:45 Took Keisha for a walk up the line. 8:45 Had a shower and answered emails. 9:30…\n\nRead More →\n\nMy Web Site\n\nMy sister has been running lots of ideas past me recently, as she works on redesigning my web site. Hard to believe, but it’s been almost 10 years since she designed my first web site for me. It has been through a number of changes since then – quite apart from regular updates – but…\n\nRead More →\n\nHurray! Another contract!\n\n|\n\nAs if I’m not already delighted enough to have a new picture book coming out next year (the first brand new one in sixteen years!) as well as a biography for adolescent readers (my first ever biography!) — I have just signed a contract for a totally new take on the theme I explored in…\n\nRead More →\n\nWhat is it about me and titles?\n\nSome months ago the subtitle on my biography manuscript had to be changed (and essentially, therefore, the whole title). Someone else had beat me to The Art of the Possible for their handbook about political activism. One of the working titles attached to my young adult novel-in-progress this year was Fault Lines. And didn’t Nancy…\n\nRead More →\n\nA Busy June\n\n|\n\nDid you think I’d given up blogging after just two entries? No way! But it has been a busy six weeks, quite apart from all that’s happened in my garden. The novel has now been submitted (and I can soon go to the cottage and forget I’m waiting for a response to it). I’ve also…\n\nRead More →\n\nStop the presses!\n\nThe result of a conversation with the expert I consulted to check my novel manuscript for any errors in legal procedure and language means a far more significant revision than I was anticipating before it will be ready to show a publisher. I could view it as a major setback, but I can’t help feeling…\n\nRead More →"
