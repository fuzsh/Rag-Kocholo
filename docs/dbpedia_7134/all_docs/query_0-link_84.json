        "text": "Citation preview\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nTime Frames\n\n“Time Frames offers an authoritative reference on the state of the art, giving the first comprehensive overview on the conservation rules and current protection policies of modern heritage in over 100 countries. While the Modern Movement in Architecture and Urban Planning had its origins in the Western World, it soon spread to other regions. Further to the country profiles, the publication also includes general articles by conservation professionals on issues dealing with the identity and recognition of modern architecture.” Jukka Jokilehto, Honorary Visiting Professor, University of York, UK “This extensive work is a critical examination and comparison of heritage protection laws and policies from all continents and many different countries, with special reference to the architecture of the 20th century. The framework within which this investigation and reflection upon Time and History takes place is that period of time which is laid down by many legislations for the proper recognition and consequent protection of heritage. The pattern that emerges reveals a wide variety of different models and sensibilities, enabling us to fully comprehend the motivation behind heritage protection and the tangible and intangible values targeted by said protection.” Giovanni Carbonara, Emeritus Professor, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy Time Frames provides a reconnaissance on the conservation rules and current protection policies of more than 100 countries, with particular attention to the emerging nations and twentieth-century architecture. The contributions illustrate the critical issues related to architectural listings, with a brief history of national approaches, a linkography and a short bibliography. The book also provides a short critical lexicography, with 12 papers written by scholars and experts including topics on identities, heritages, conservation, memories and the economy. By examining the methods used to designate building as heritage sites across the continents, this book provides a comprehensive overview of current protection policies of twentieth-century architecture as well as the role of architectural history. Ugo Carughi is an architect, Chair of Docomomo Italia Onlus and former Director at the Superintendence of Naples. He has conducted numerous restorations of monumental buildings and won the prize in the competition for pilot projects for the conservation of monuments organized by the EEC (1988). Amongst his main books is Maledetti Vincoli. La tutela dell’architettura contemporanea (2012). Massimo Visone is Adjunct Professor in History of Architecture at the University of Naples Federico II. Amongst his main publications are many studies on the history of architecture and the city of Naples and its surroundings, the history of art and a significant edited volume on protection policies for twentieth-century architecture worldwide (Maledetti vincoli: Part II 2012).\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nTaylor &Francis Taylor & Francis Group\n\nhttp://taylorandfrancis.com\n\nTime Frames\n\nEdited by Ugo Carughi and Massimo Visone\n\nROUTLEDGE\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nConservation Policies for Twentieth-Century Architectural Heritage\n\nRoutledge Taylor & Francis Group\n\nLONDON AND NEW YORK\n\nROUTLEDGE\n\nRoutledge Taylor & Francis Group\n\nLONDON AND NEW YORK\n\nFirst published 2017 by Routledge 2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon OX14 4RN and by Routledge 711 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017 Routledge is an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an informa business\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\n© 2017 selection and editorial matter, Massimo Visone and Ugo Carughi; individual chapters, the contributors The right of Massimo Visone and Ugo Carughi to be identified as the authors of the editorial material, and of the authors for their individual chapters, has been asserted in accordance with sections 77 and 78 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.

If the so-called “historic” heritage is subject to laws and regulations that take into account its features, then twentieth-century heritage – and especially those buildings that have not (yet) found a place in the history of architecture – is considered, with respect to regulation compliancy, to be on the same level as new constructions. First of all, modern heritage represents a huge built volume. The preservation of buildings and significant sites of the Modern Movement poses an important physical and economic problem. One of the main tasks of architects today is the reuse of existing buildings, most of which are of recent construction, making the phrase “building in the existing” commonplace from now on. Second, the massive built volume from the twentieth century confronts us with objects that are still largely suspended in the limbo of history and architecture criticism. On the one hand, architectural historians dealing with the past century are still developing critical tools to understand the place some of these recent works occupy in the history of architecture. On the other, it is difficult to defend some examples of twentieth-century architecture with respect to the public at large. The enhancement of this heritage is still in progress: it is a complex task, and today we are living in a very delicate phase inasmuch as we risk losing valuable examples of recent architecture if recognition is not given in time. Hence the need to be very careful. Third, the Modern Movement is often incorrectly – and superficially – considered a style, a simple formalism, whereas many modern architects fought against this idea. Walter Gropius, in The Scope of Total Architecture, defined modern architecture as a method: “My intention is not to introduce a Modern Style [. . .] but to introduce a method or approach that helps address a problem in terms of its particular conditions”. The Modern Movement architecture is envisaged as a process rather than a style. Finally, as we all know, the twentieth-century heritage is technically fragile because innovative technologies were not based on a long-standing constructive tradition. Faced with the challenge of building homes, work spaces and facilities for a large number of people with a limited budget, the architects of the Modern Movement developed several experimental and cheap construction technologies. Their willingness to experiment, combined with a certain degree of professional naivety and a desire to achieve a minimalist aesthetic by using new technologies, is also the source of technical imperfections of most of the early experiments. However, modern architects also showed great interest in issues relating to the pursuit of efficiency and economy,\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nPreface\n\nxxv\n\nincluding the efficient use of materials and a conceptual approach to resource economy. Some of them tried to solve technical problems of building performance, which are very close to the themes of today’s literature on “sustainable development”. The buildings of the Modern Movement often have a rapid functional obsolescence because they were designed to perform very specific functions. It is sometimes difficult to find a new practical use for these constructions. The idea that the buildings have a functional life of limited duration is not new, and it is something that appears early in the literature related to the preservation of modern heritage. This perceived obsolescence stimulates ex novo construction. The focus is increasingly on efficiency and performance, so the intrinsic value of the original building, both on the inside and the outside, is often excluded. This approach, however, is in clear contradiction with the concept of “sustainable development”. The combination of rights and protection involves reflection on the standards that are to be applied to the practice of re-use and recovery. The different cases analysed make it possible to posit two kinds of situations: when a building is formally classified, it is possible to work with exceptionality and adapt legislation; if, on the other hand, the building is simply listed, all the standards apply in most cases as if it were a new construction threatening the on-going work and the quality of the re-use design. Nowadays, beyond the specific case of modern buildings recognized as monuments (listed or classified) with commitment to a carefully weighted restoration, capable of ensuring the original value and character, it is possible to argue that the experience of an exclusive and unique restoration could be expanded to a wider practice. This leads me to face adaptive re-use as a regular architectural practice and to consider the question of sustainability as a particular challenge for modern heritage. Interestingly, due to the economic crisis that has hit the real estate market and created a very high availability of buildings, new opportunities may emerge in order to support the recovery and re-use of modern heritage. The Modern Movement has demonstrated its long term legitimacy, as a concept endowed with an extraordinary longevity. Relating technology, form and social commitment to one another, through an optimistic faith in progress, modern architects sought to attain new heights of functionality and flexibility in use. The challenge for today is how to deal with this modern legacy in relation to the continuously changing context of the current times, including physical, economic and functional changes, as well as the fast-moving socio-cultural, political and scientific contextual values. Preserving the architectural heritage of the 20th century requires us to take account both of the opportunity and the duty to reuse buildings which have lost their original function, which are physically and/or technically obsolete, and which no longer meet today’s ever-more demanding standards. Such matters as the demand for material and technology reuse and for spatial and functional transformations, and the updating of regulations concerning fire, seismic stability, user safety, energy efficiency and environmental comfort legislation, are all part of the contemporary agenda. This inevitably highlights the question of the value of the existing built fabric, which can be a strong resource that calls for our attention in terms of social, economic and environmental sustainability. However, in many cases, new buildings are no longer economically viable. Besides, institutions and companies are often criticised when the decision to build new buildings involves the abandonment of old ones and is beginning to be seen as socially unacceptable. The adaptive re-use of Modern Movement buildings is now starting\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nxxvi\n\nAna Tostões\n\nto be recognised as a benefit to the identity of the sites and the sustainability of the life cycle, beyond the pure economics. Local governments and national policies are waking up and beginning to develop measures, lifting the regulations that limit the alternative use of abandoned buildings and providing legislation for temporary use, such as urgently essential affordable housing for young people. As can be expected, buildings recognised as heritage sites by Docomomo – the international committee for documentation and conservation of buildings, sites and neighbourhoods of the Modern Movement – begin to appear as investments, which may provide new opportunities for the architectural profession. The importance of Docomomo as an organization recognised worldwide it’s its capacity to develop initiatives related to the exchange of ideas and experience and to draw public attention. It grows with the institutional ability to arouse interest by the individuals involved in processes of heritage conservation, which still today tends to regard the twentiethcentury architectural heritage with a certain degree of indifference. In this sense, this heritage needs to be understood as a model or even a manifesto or symbol for sustainable architectural development redefining the legacy of modernity in globalized societies. The time has come to approach the teaching of architecture, modify the study curriculum and start involving students on the development of knowledge and experience directed towards adaptive re-use. The history of building has a growing need to integrate programs whilst bringing together academics who can conduct research on documents and interpret the facts, together with professionals on construction sites, examining the effective responses, budgets and deadlines of everyday construction. For all those who work with existing buildings, the connection is simple, because the built stock is a question of values that implies a degree of knowledge and culture where buildings play a key role with regard to quality, durability and economy. That is why this book, entitled Time Frames. Conservation Policies for Twentieth-Century Architectural Heritage, is an important and necessary review on the theoretical and technological development of modern heritage envisioning a global perspective of local policies and heritage institutions.

The history and conservation of modern architecture, therefore, are increasingly associated with sustainability. Today, the recycling and reuse of twentieth-century buildings are an integral part of multiple strategies for the development of urban landscapes. The protection of twentieth-century architecture has now earned the right of entry into specialist studies and is gradually building up a rich historiography, replete with projects relating to cataloguing, conservation and promotion at various levels. The contrast between the ‘iconolatry’, or adoration of many iconic architectures from the last century, on the one hand, and their vulnerability, on the other, has contributed to define a limit of the Modern. The idea of a review of contemporary architecture protection policies was born in 2012, as the second part of our publication, Maledetti vincoli. Its critical success and subsequent requests from many quarters for a version in English led us to broaden the international scope of the study and produce Time Frames: Conservation Policies for Twentieth-Century Architectural Heritage. Globalisation, as a process, started in the 1970s, and its repercussions have also been felt in spectacular fashion in the field of architecture, leading to the opening up of new critical perspectives. This book is divided into two parts. The first consists of brief essays on the current laws and protection policies regarding twentieth-century architecture. The second part is a collection of critical essays on some related issues. In the first part Time Frames analyzes the background and status of existing protection policies in architectural heritage worldwide, focusing on production from the twentieth century. The essays provide an overall view of Europe as a whole, much of America and a large part of Asia, with a focus on developing countries. Rather than being seen as prejudice, any apparent imbalance depends on the simple fact that America and Europe have much more protectable modern architecture than elsewhere. They also rely heavily on a better-established legislative and historiographical tradition that is more sensitive to contemporary architecture. We are grateful to the authors for their valuable contributions: these specialists deal with the everyday challenges of protecting this kind of heritage. This review aims for a better understanding of the various national issues involved in the recognition of works of historical and architectural interest, whilst simultaneously highlighting the vices and virtues of current legislative systems relating to their protection.\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\n2\n\nUgo Carughi and Massimo Visone\n\nTime Frames moves along the narrow boundary between the critical recognition of a building’s historical and artistic value, on the one hand, and its institutional protection, on the other, without going into the merits of the many restoration issues. The book focusses on the so-called ‘time rule’ that elapses between a building’s construction and its protection. We have summarized the different cultural approaches to protection in various countries by analyzing a single piece of data, to wit, the time between creation and possible protection of a work, and we put the same questions to all authors: Is there a chronological limit for the inclusion of architecture in the national heritage? Is there twentieth-century architecture in the national heritage list? Is this issue the subject of cultural interest or debate in your country? Which is the most recent work that has been subjected to legal protection? There emerged from this survey a very variable concept of what is “Contemporary”, i.e., architecture which has not yet become historical. The concept related to the time limits for protection as established by law for the registration of works as cultural heritage. These questions refer to one single factor, time, which has so far been examined only indirectly in the growing literature on architectural heritage. It serves as a kind of master key that unlocks complex problems related to the history, cultures and traditions of each country, to current rules – both written and unwritten – and relationships between historiography and planning, to identity and the notion of Contemporary. The survey aims to stimulate cultural and institutional awareness of more recent architecture. It reveals that this issue at the forefront in many countries, both from a purely theoretical point of view and from one of application, such as through postgraduate specialization programs, national research projects, international partnerships and government initiatives for the drafting of catalogues, records and inventories of twentieth-century architectural heritage and for the selection of sites and buildings of special significance. Compared to most studies on this subject, based on research methods for past heritage, Time Frames aims to bring together existing strands of the debate on twentiethcentury architecture where there is already an established critical tradition and stimulate and increase it where it has still to emerge. Several networks have already initiated exchange and consultancy activities relating to the principal legal systems in the field of heritage conservation, the most important of which is the UNESCO Database of National Cultural Heritage Laws, an international instrument devised in 2003 to combat the illicit traffic of cultural property. Others are Compendium. Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe, a transnational project initiated in 1998 by the current Steering Committee for Culture, Heritage and Landscape of the Council of Europe (CDCPP) and has been running as a joint venture with the European Institute for Comparative Cultural Research (ERICarts). It has a web-based and permanently updated information and monitoring system of 42 national cultural policies in Europe. There is also HEREIN, which brings together European public administrations in charge of national cultural heritage policies, with 42 Council of Europe member states contributing to the dynamic of this project. Similar initiatives also exist outside Europe, albeit in a more piecemeal fashion. They are, however, linked to international cultural heritage institutions, such as UNESCO, ICOMOS, Docomomo International, the World Monument Found and others, all of which provide opportunity to reflect on shared criteria for the protection of twentieth-century architectural heritage at risk.\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nAwareness and sharing of standards and procedures have also been facilitated by the IT revolution that enhances communication, direct consultation of documentary sources, bibliography, historiography and of the same laws. Therefore, the reader is invited to refer to the current online search engines to examine regulatory investigations, to consult official websites of major institutions, national heritage lists, blogs and research projects on twentieth-century architecture, all of which are easily accessible in the single contributions and links therein. International literature in this field has consisted of in-depth examination of the protection laws in many countries, including comparative scoreboards, particularly within the Council of Europe. Additional work has been done on outlining the cultural features of entire continental sectors, also indicating trends identifiable via more recent international charters and documents. Contributions in the present volume, however, generally refer to the ensemble of rules in various countries, also via association with economic and social development, as well as with the development of a conservation culture. A smaller, but ever-increasing, number of works deals more specifically with twentieth-century architecture. This broad survey contains, on a country-by-country basis, the image of one of the most recently listed buildings, in most cases the more recent one. These icons, together with the synoptic table, give an immediate idea of the legislative, and sometimes cultural, limits, which act as marker posts for the notion of Contemporary, in the context of the relationship between historiography and recognition of cultural interest. Establishing a mandatory time limit based on the construction date of quality architecture in order to protect it may compromise its effective conservation. This time rule is dictated, of course, by the need to provide an official critical distance for the sake of protection. A more reliable historical assessment may, however, be provided from within the discipline of historiography. We might even strengthen this approach so as to say that historical and critical judgement might become a sine qua non for protection. In this way, protection based on an adequate historiographical framework would play an active role in land development. Starting with the historical perspective as an inescapable premise, Massimo Visone then deals with the relationship between history and protection, and especially with regard to monumentalization of contemporary architecture, rather more difficult to explain and understand compared to architecture from a more distant past. Accordingly, much reference is made to more recent critical studies. In his prioritization of time, Ugo Carughi refers protective strategies to five parameters, derived from the cultures of countries with longer critical traditions, and whose lexicography is provided in the second part of the book: the time factor, the growing importance of relational value, the relationship between monument and context and between protection and town planning and, finally, planning for protection and protection as a process. The guidelines resulting from these parameters open up avenues into the ever-shifting scenario of land management. The contributions in the second part are organized into five conceptual parts: Identity, Heritage, Memory, Conservation and Economy. They provide non-exhaustive insights into the role and impact of the values of the Contemporary in culturally stratified realities, randomly chosen from within their respective continental areas. They also provide a range of information on the documentation, knowledge, protection and promotion of the architectural values from the last century to the present day.\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\n4\n\nUgo Carughi and Massimo Visone\n\nContributions on Identities relate to the introduction and formation of a language for modern architecture in a well-defined cultural reality. In West Africa, for example, the so-called “Wind of Change” was a period which gave a significant boost to modernisation and when colonies changed from being European government territories to being self-governing sovereign states. Ola Uduku gives us a critical historical framework on background, lives and architecture of West African architects and other indigenous actors. These architects, who were rarely studied, have played a significant role in the evolution and spread of post-war architecture and related modernist projects in the region. Ashraf M. Salama examines the particular cultural and geo-political position of the Arab region. Through its links with the global contemporary condition and the creation of rich soil for architectural and urban experiments, we have seen the emergence of several works which have contributed to our understanding of that region’s identity and meaning. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the author has not missed the chance to highlight false cultural reductionism which has standardised the rich linguistic complexity and understanding of architectural evolution into a deeprooted reality. Franco Purini provides us with a brief but well-rounded overview of the formation of a new Humanism from the twentieth century up to the present day, featuring the ideals of freedom and the pedagogical and educational energy of culture and architectural criticism. The author discusses, among other things, the complexity of the relationship between planning and historiography with respect to the main identifying features in Italy and relations with the international production, a contribution that aims to place the coordinates of the concept of Modern within history rather than against it. Mizuko Ugo outlines the history of modern architecture in Japan from the 1950s to the 1990s, which saw the start of the first studies, a series of investigations into modern built heritage. At that time, attention was being paid to the coming one hundredth anniversary of the Meiji Restoration, which promoted the Westernisation of the country. In this chapter, we can see, above all, the close link between re-use of modern architecture and urban development, on the one hand, and the needs of conservation and urban planning on the other. We should remember that after World War II, the main Japanese architectural heritage features a high degree of modernity. Heritage has three contributions which outline some areas of contemporary architecture, considered ‘children of a lesser god’, both because of its specific connotation, and because of the relatively recent attention that has been paid to it, not so much by historians, who have long been interested in it, but by those involved in the whole culture of protection. It is significant that in the three writings there emerge the impossibility of being able to preserve these works as original and that it is necessary to consider them from within the multiplicity of transformation dynamics. Thus, Roberto Parisi shows how the cross-thematic and multi-disciplinary field of industrial archaeology has projected the theme of utility architecture beyond its typological and technological connotations, in that it is associated with territorial transformation and changes in production methods and the social organisation of labour. Protection, which is carried out scientifically using archaeological methods, and the recovery of industrial creations emerge as basic premises in our understanding and critical appreciation of environmental processes tout court. Michael Jakob examines the landscape, the garden and landscape architecture in relation to their steady evolution which excludes any notion of ‘original’. In the case of the landscape, the many different viewpoints increase the effects of transformation. As for the garden, the\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nartificial conservation of original features would make it an anachronistic artefact and would deprive it of its most natural identifying feature, that of its evolution. Finally, Filippo De Pieri examines three different meanings that the term heritage can have with regard to the housing architecture: first, items that are handed down from one generation to another by right of birth, which has social implications; second, buildings that are kept as collective heritage which are either one-offs, expressions of historically acquired collective values or anonymous residential complexes which bear witness to social and business patterns; and, finally whole areas of built landscape. The reuse of such large numbers of various types of diverse heritage, not only monuments, but, above all, buildings, infrastructure and entire company towns still in use, poses a question for Conservation: Should we preserve their tangible or intangible values? Roberta Grignolo analyses issues relating to technological features of twentiethcentury architecture, taking a fresh look at current legislative perspective: What ‘rights’ for twentieth-century architectural heritage? Newly found cultural awareness of Modernism still clashes with the difficulties attached to adapting recent building to present-day regulations. This approach has led to the supra-national comparison of current best practices in dealing with the ‘rights of the monuments’. Rosalia Vittorini carries out a brief review of the technological evolution of architecture from the second half of the twentieth century, with special reference to the aesthetic importance of new materials and the role that these technologies are playing in restoration. Over the last decades, architecture has become a matter of great public interest, and not only in Western countries. Memory focuses on issues relating to documentation, awareness and appreciation. Teresita Scalco provides the historical context of the establishment of a number of institutions, libraries, archives, museums, cultural associations, international organisations and foundations interested in promoting a better understanding of modern culture and architectural language. These cultural bodies are essential to preserve the architectural record, foster the study of architectural history in the interest of future practice and stimulate the public appreciation of architecture. For much of the nineteenth century, the photography of new buildings was disdainfully regarded as an arcane, merely technical process that the photographer with artistic aspirations should eschew. During the 1930s, architecture and photography found themselves in closer alliance than ever before, largely due to the advent of Modernism, which, with its reverence for machine artefacts, revolutionized both genres. Then, as now, architectural photography is the most available tool for the divulgation of architecture. Valeria Carullo highlights the importance of documentation and the preservation of photographic material, useful sources for the history and critical analysis of transformation, as well as being items of aesthetic value in their own right. Economy sees the emergence of supranational economic values arising from the globalisation of the so-called market as ‘communicating vessels’, which determines interdependence among different countries and geographical areas. Amedeo Di Maio deals with the relationship between economics and contemporary architecture with reference, in particular, to privately owned buildings, given the greater risk compared to the protection of public architecture. The economic aspect is analysed in the light of the relationship between the statutory time spans and the need to protect the Contemporary, highlighting a number of factors dependent both on market factors and political will, which are essential conditions for effective protection.\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nTaylor &Francis Taylor & Francis Group\n\nhttp://taylorandfrancis.com\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nPart I\n\nConservation policies for twentieth-century architectural heritage\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nTaylor &Francis Taylor & Francis Group\n\nhttp://taylorandfrancis.com\n\n1\n\nThe shadow line Architecture between time and history\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nMassimo Visone\n\nEvery generation revolts against its fathers and makes friends with its grandfathers.1 Lewis Mumford\n\nHistory and preservation In 1980, when David Watkin observed that it was becoming “increasingly clear that two of the most important and persistent motives which lie behind the production of architectural history are the practice and the preservation of architecture”,2 he was identifying – not without some criticism – the contemporary role of architectural historians in the education and preservation of memory. We can use his comment as a starting point when examining controversial issues regarding the relationship between history and preservation, focusing on protection and its role as interface between academia and those bodies charged with the protection of architectural heritage. Although this position crosses into the field of instrumentalized architectural historiography, it remains closely linked to the relationship between journalism and history, as was first suggested by Bruno Zevi in his renowned journal L’Architettura. Cronache e storia, first published in 1955.3 This essay aims to put the previously mentioned relationship to the test in the place where there may be greatest tension: when history converges with the present. In other words, we intend to examine reciprocal cultural and legislative approaches with regard to architectural production from just before the Conradian “shadow line”. This will bring us to define as “contemporary” that which is not “historic”, in accordance with commonly used guidelines. Great awareness of the processes of globalization that affect architecture has been shown in the analysis of the criteria and of the role of protection. These processes have generated a dialogue, between very differing realities, on an increasingly common theme, as we shall see later. This dialogue has become more and more vibrant, thanks to the potential of networking, which has also brought about a series of useful and well-known advantages for scientific research: speed in communication; easier access to institutional platforms; easy consultation of a growing number of regulations, both past and present; opportunity – unthinkable ten years ago – to navigate far afield with the aid of ever-more advanced and constantly updated web applications; the diversification and continuous increase of online documentary and bibliographical sources; the exponential multiplication of historical and contemporary iconographic sources, previously only available via a small number of standard publications, which\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nFigure 1.1 Gabriele Basilico, Monte-Carlo 05-A12-137, 2005.

Meanwhile, paintings with the same subject are less frequent, but we can find many interesting artists devoted to the urban representation from the second half of the twentieth century until today. These research tools, along with architectural historians’ traditional working methods, have obviously opened up new critical perspectives. It is bringing new dimensions to the ambivalent geographies of architecture that offer fresh opportunities for re-thinking the borders of architectural history in a globalized, transcultural context.5\n\nHeritage and globalization We used one of the questions that were put to authors in the first part of the book – is there a time limit for the inclusion of architecture in your national cultural heritage? – in order to identify the rules, mandatory limits and thresholds beyond which institutions may not ordinarily recognize the value of a building and ensure the preservation of its authenticity. In other words, the study was aimed at whatever method lies at the heart of the process of monumentalization, not only of the Modern, but above all, of the Contemporary. The inclusion of the most recent works in the national inventories, lists or records ensures the ongoing update of that country’s cultural identities. Thus, there is the implicit proof of the existence of a deliberate commemorative value, Alois Riegl’s third category, forming the obvious transition to present-day values: an eternally present theme which requires that architecture be protected from human destruction.6 The history of international architectural heritage preservation has been the subject of numerous studies, with detailed examples covering the most recent experiences of restoration and comparative studies of administrative policies,7 but without going into greater detail of twentieth-century architectural issues. Only recently several scholars have raised the need to review the parameters of intervention on modern architecture in relation to natural instances of growth, innovation and development.8 Reassessment of the Modern Movement and Modernism is evident in renewed enthusiasm for the protection of this heritage, as shown by the phenomenal growth of Docomomo International, a non-profit organization founded in 1988, which now has 69 chapters worldwide; the recent inclusion of modern complexes in UNESCO’s World Heritage List; the special initiative Modernism at Risk, by the World Monuments Fund, a private non-profit organization founded in 1965 and today one of the largest in the world, not to mention numerous other active institutions and cultural realities the world over. This phenomenon can only be contextualized in the extraordinary acceleration that the internationalization and globalization of world-built heritage has undergone, rooted, amongst others, in the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World’s Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972), which was followed by the European Charter of the Architectural Heritage (1975).9 At the same time, the dissenting culture of those years looked favourably on the concept of nomadism as a future existential condition,\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\n12\n\nMassimo Visone\n\nfree from time and space, and encouraged the early development of this globalization of architecture,10 which is reflected in Radical Architecture, and also in contemporary historiographical contributions.11 This opened a new critical trend, which over time has been purified of its most ideological positions.12 In recent years, the cultural heritage of twentieth-century architecture, which had tended towards an anti-historical and self-referencing interpretation of modern architecture and a paradigmatic position within the Western architectural tradition,13 has in fact been challenged by a series of new critical contributions, coming from outside the usual geographical boundaries of historiography. This breach was opened by the birth of the category of “Critical Regionalism”14 that allowed the emergence from the shadow of a number of architects, both emigrés abroad and at home, in countries that had not enjoyed significant historiography for a long time. Given the impossibility of summarizing here recent historiographies from the critical debate on contemporary architecture,15 the reader is referred to recent books which explore the complex relationship between modernism, modernity and modernization and their entanglements with colonialism and post-colonialism, and nationalism development, globalization and regionalism, drawing from interdisciplinary theories. They start from the generally accepted consideration that the canonical history of modern architecture is primarily a narrative based on certain master architects, major movements and exemplary buildings in Europe and North America. Sibel Bozdogan even goes so far as to say that the study of non-Western modern architecture was, until about 20 years ago, “doubly marginalized”,16 both by historians of modern architecture and by local specialists and scholars. With the previously mentioned temporal expansion there came also the geographical enlargement of the scope of the history of modern architecture, which moved from its traditional centres to include parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America as sites of proliferation of modern architecture in the mid-twentieth century.17 The topicality of the current debate tends to revalue a past which in some respects is still too recent, particularly in the Western world, where historiographies have for some time reached greater scientific maturity.18 Indeed, especially in the non-Western world, the Modern Movement has prevailed to such a large extent over post–World War II works that it has itself become fully synonymous with twentieth-century architecture. The great authorities of modern architecture have overshadowed later works, and the latter have been generally unable to establish themselves in the public eye, despite achieving clear recognition among specialists. This condition is mirrored by some woefully inadequate cultural and regulatory limits when compared to architecture’s new geography and even history. The numerous cataloguing and research programs in progress bear out the need to re-examine time limits from within the new cultural-historical context.19 This has been theorized in different times and ways by art historians or, as often happens, within different specialist fields, such as analytic aesthetics, or post-criticalism, or by architectural practitioners themselves, pre-empting and directing attention onto issues and subjects ignored by historians of the time.20 This constitutes a legacy of the most recent past which, in accordance with artistic and intellectual tradition, was developed at its very inception and which has continued without interruption. It continues to yield a veritable wealth of significant and historically interesting literary and iconographic material, thereby increasing collective cultural values.\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nThe shadow line\n\n13\n\nFigure 1.2 Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, University of Ibadan, 1949–1960 Source: Courtesy of Gillian Hopwood, 1954.\n\nTime rules In case we feel tempted to take for granted the current boundaries of contemporary architecture, they do, however, appear quite discretionary when measured against the various criteria established by law for the designation of a work as a heritage. This tendency is even stronger when it comes to dealing with the notion of time and, more specifically, of contemporaneity. It is easy to understand how the apparently transparent term “Contemporary” is actually far from being passive. The picture that emerges reveals a number of differences, as shown in the attached synoptic table. The way it has been drafted queries the recognition of the primacy of historiography over regulations, of time over history, of the work over its function and of public ownership over private property. This multitudinous variety of current time rules for architectural\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\n14\n\nMassimo Visone\n\nFigure 1.3 Louis Hellman, Architect’s Journal, 20.11.15 Source: Courtesy of Louis Hellman.\n\nprotection reveals, to all intents and purposes, how precarious they are and how difficult a unified reading might be. The first dichotomy is between historiographies and the law, that is, the extent to which historiographical criteria are binding upon the action of protection, on the eventual critical success of a piece of work, on the eventual completion of the life cycle of an architectural movement and sometimes on the authors themselves. Time limits are either associated with a time indicated in an absolute quantitative value in relation to the well-known definition of a “generation” (25 years) and commonly expressed as the “Fifty Years Rule”,21 or they may be associated with the history or the date of an event that has made a significant contribution to the community, province or nation. It is also possible to distinguish another cultural dichotomy: on the one hand the protection of heritage as an asset, so what is safeguarded is its physicality, and on the other hand a protection that respects the identity of the asset and the continuity of its function. Finally, we have two other opposing approaches: the analytical type, in which protection is bound exclusively to the work or even\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nThe shadow line\n\n15\n\nto just a part of it, and the other, holistic, type, in which the conservation of the architecture is related to recognition of its historical context so that the authenticity of the object is constantly maintained within its own historical environment or within a more complex system.22 Time limits may, however, be indefinite, unofficially established by an unwritten law, ranked in a more or less articulated fashion or measurable on the basis of a system of criteria of variable complexity. It must be said, however, that the blind spots and loopholes of these limits are exploited and contradicted on a daily basis, in accordance with principles that sometimes reflect the precariousness of local situations, subjective talents and personal culture. The issue of historical and architectural value all too often collides with the reality of economic interests, with development and urban planning, and with market forces. We can observe distinct classifications and competences and graded levels of protection, both at territorial and architectural level, which often interact with more specialized disciplines and specific protection programs for factories, urban planning, landscape, housing, engineering, gardens, etc. The overall impression is of an architectural and theoretical phenomenon of great richness and variety in which the contemporary seems to be characterized by a series of cultural fractures and historical events which have yielded bursts of temporal diversity, frequently in conflict with each other. The twentieth century seems to really emerge, therefore, as the era in which time explodes in all directions, with no comparison with what happened in the past. It would be sufficient, therefore, to expand the unit of time, say, from years to centuries, for us to see that we are witnessing an unprecedented acceleration.\n\nHistoriography After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Eric Hobsbawm proposed new historiographical considerations, thereby making critical re-readings of the numerous historiographies inevitable. In the case of architecture, historians have focused on the origins of the radical transformation of the language of the contemporary period, following a critical path that has seen a significant break after the end of the so-called “Short Twentieth Century”. Within the confrontation that characterized this period of time, the English historian notes that “how effective, or even how consciously held, the rival strategies for burying the world of our forefathers were, need not be considered here”.23 The progressive loss of historical memory and the revolutionary mutation of collective identities created conditions for a significant cultural change, so that the world today is not the same as before. With the end of a monolithic duopoly and the cessation of the very tense confrontation between two opposing political, economic and cultural systems, the architecture of the Golden Age and of the consumer society should today look as historically remote as socialist architecture, albeit in a more subtle and less immediate way, and not without “a mood of uneasiness.”24 In all its undeniable complexity, therefore, most recent building production in the Western world should be re-contextualized as a function of correct institutional conservation, within this new historiographical perspective. This crisis has also affected aesthetic judgment, bearing in mind that, alongside those who think in terms of the importance of the judgement process and richness of its potential consequences, there are also those like Gilles Deleuze who, in 1993, picks up a thread from the 1970s and declares that it is necessary to “pour en finir avec le jugement”.25\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\n16\n\nMassimo Visone\n\nFigure 1.4 Greater London Council.

Several ongoing initiatives are seeking to re-evaluate in detail the production of Socialist Realism and challenge the more established values of the architectural heritage in the context of social growth. Among the most recent examples, in the early summer of 2007 the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nThe shadow line\n\n17\n\naddressed a request to formulate and develop a project to gather information on Portuguese Heritage around the World: architecture and urbanism and make it available to the public. This was accomplished with the publication of three volumes in 2010– 2011. The Heritage of Portuguese Influence portal was launched in 2012.26 In 2009, the Swiss University Conference promoted a three-year research project on the Critical Encyclopaedia of Restoration and Reuse of Twentieth-Century Architecture. Towards 2012, the Atrium project got under way, an ambitious programme which consists of 18 partners from South East Europe on the architecture of twentieth-century totalitarian regimes.27 February 2014 saw the launch of another three-year research project in cooperation between the Weimar Bauhaus University and Dortmund Technische\n\nFigure 1.5 Jo Hendrik van den Broek and Jacob Berend Bakema, City Hall, Marl, 1960–1966 Source: Gerardus (Wikipedia Commons), 2008.\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\n18\n\nMassimo Visone\n\nUniversität called Which monuments, which modernity? Understanding, evaluating and communicating the architectural heritage of the second half of the 20th century.28 Less has been done with regard to re-examining architecture from those countries which came out as “victors” from this clash of the century. On the horizon, therefore, there seems to be looming a new approach to the critical reinterpretation of this language revolution. It should be emphasized that a historiographical snapshot of contemporary architecture is a blend of cultural baggage, a range of events and, above all, of contributions that are almost entirely from the short century, and it is to this period that they relate. In this respect, Carlo Olmo posits new questions for a new historical and critical periodization and proposes the “Thematisation of the Break”, in order to understand the complex architectural history of the twentieth century, constructed in time even before in its space. The last century was culturally reinforced by the celebration of the memory of recent events but, from now on, historiographical approaches to these architectural memories will be more complex and contradictory precisely for the century that invented this celebration. Preserving buildings that were designed for a limited duration in order to fulfil the immediate demands of a population that wished to elevate its culture and income, or factories and gasometers that are no longer functionally relevant, appears to be a really complex task,29 an assumption that had already been partly envisaged by art historians. Mario De Micheli, at the beginning of his book on twentieth-century avant-gardes art, had recognized that modern art had not been born as of an evolutionary process from the nineteenth century but rather by a break with academic values.30 On this basis, the most recent “histories” of contemporary architecture reference new historical patterns and experimental “pigeon-holes”. The basic criteria are becoming less selective, lacking the ideological motivation from the past, albeit with increasingly inclusive and encyclopaedic aims, as if forced into historiographical reductionism. Collective biographies, on the one hand, constitute a prerequisite for the re-writing of the history of modern and contemporary architecture, by unwittingly offering themselves to their readers’ own exponentially personal interpretations when putting together pieces of a variable puzzle.31 The phenomenon of biographical monographs, on the other hand, offers complete catalogues that immortalize worldly production, celebrate an architecture such as a landmark, are somewhat antithetical to the contextualization of the work and, finally, celebrate the internationalization of the architect in question. Over the past 20 years, several scholars have personally measured themselves against the concept of historiographical synthesis. In 1998, Giovanni Fanelli and Roberto Gargiani wrote an experimental history that went to the heart of architecture, namely the relationship between space, structure and ornament, regarding the end of traditional masonry techniques and the introduction of new building systems. The authors claimed that their history was not merely notional, neither was it a list of events, nor a summary of all the main important architects who had worked in the time span in question, nor a history of the ideologies of architects and their respective clients. Neither was it a history whose aim was to trace the reasons that lay behind various differing points of view in the world of architecture.32 In the same year, globalization\n\nDownloaded by [University of California, San Diego] at 05:59 09 May 2017\n\nThe shadow line\n\n19\n\ntook control over architectural criticism. In Supermodernism, Hans Ibelings sees contemporary architecture as being indifferent and uprooted from its context.33 Critical Regionalism gives way to the process of universalization of the professional market. Again in 1998, albeit in a history written on a national scale, Leonardo Benevolo comes to similar conclusions. He outlines the formation of a new identity based on a historic event – the unification of the country – which sees as one of its main outcomes the degradation of the landscape, the result of the collective loss of confidence in the habitat and its physical surroundings.34 More recently, Marco Biraghi has followed the criterion of a history that adopts different “lenses”, depending on the subject matter and its distance from the present. In his analysis of the new myths and rites into which the Contemporary has fragmented, the author emphasizes the recent progressive planetary mobility of large architectural firms, their moving towards the Near East, the phenomenon of “signature buildings” and the highly temporary nature of some high media impact projects, to "
