When it is implemented in the business model of an organization, it can reduce costs by analyzing better way of running business and storing a very large amount of data. Data analytic techniques basically enable researchers to take raw data and discover patterns to bring out valuable insights from it. Data scientists and analysts are using data analytic techniques in their research and businesses to take decisions. Data analysis is assisting organizations to better understand their customers, evaluate their ad campaigns, personalize content, create content strategies and develop products. It can be said that businesses are using data analytics to increase their business performance and improve their bottom line. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, data management, data mining and predictive analytics are some of the technologies that make today’s data analytics the most powerful strategy. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of developing and utilizing computer systems which can simulate human intelligence to perform different tasks. Precisely, machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that is significant for data analytics and involves algorithms that can learn on its own. ML enables applications to utilize data and analyze it to predict outcomes without knowing system parameters to harness the useful information. Machine learning algorithm is being trained on a small sample of data, and the system will continue to learn by its own as it accumulates more data, turning into more accurate as time passes. Big data analytics describes the large volume of data, maybe structured or unstructured data, which deals a business. It is essential to recognize how this data is being utilized by different organization. Big data is being analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business improvements. Big data is creating new growth opportunities and entirely new categories of companies that can combine and analyze industry data. These organizations have plenty of information about the various products and services, all buyers and suppliers, and consumer choices that can be analyzed. Every organization uses data in its own way; the more efficiently an organization uses its data, the more it grows by cost saving, time reductions by taking fast decisions, by understanding the market scenarios early and correctly, by controlling reputation by receiving continuous feedback, by observing customer behavior and v\n\nvi\n\nPreface\n\nloyalty and by solving advertisers’ problem and making to offer marketing insights. Moreover, big data analytics is a major driver of innovations and product development. Big data analytics is implemented in both public and private sectors, such as advertising, education, health care, insurance, manufacturing or banking. Big data is serving to deliver benefits in many surprising areas.

The traditional power grids are experiencing various challenges such as reliability and sustainability. Due to limited energy resources and budget with increase in load demand, conventional energy management techniques are getting failed. In this case, demand side management (DSM) technique is one of the best solutions ensuring reliable and economical power flow. Demand side management consists of the activities or technologies which are used on demand side to optimize power consumption for achieving desired objectives including energy balancing and cost reduction etc. This chapter reviews and discusses the framework of demand side management on the basis of modes and programs. Demand side management techniques are differentiated on the basis of their implementation and usage, which has not been reported in the previous literature. Residential DSM system is discussed with categorization of loads and constraints. During the organization of the chapter, different optimizing models are also reviewed for the implementation of DSM programs.

A modern power system must be reliable with quality and must be environmentally friendly to meet those requirements. Traditional power plants are being upgraded and are converted into smart grids with the invention of smart devices and systems. A simplified power supply chain is shown in Fig. 1. In first step, all power production resources are either mined as in case of coal or collected as in case of gas, oil, water. In second step, the resources collected or mined are purified or prepared for energy generation stage. At third stage, power is generated through different methods such as hydel, thermal or coal power plants. Then in next step, power is transmitted from power station to substations through overhead cables. In next step, power supply is distributed through distribution lines. Power distributed is supplied to end-users for utilization in last stage.\n\nFig. 1 Power supply chain\n\n6\n\nZ. A. Shah et al.\n\nThere are challenges in meeting electricity demands due to the increase in population which, as a result, lead to the increase in load demand. The International Energy Agency has estimated that in 2030, load demand will be higher than 50% than the load demand at present. Usually, power systems are designed in such a way that when there is surge in load demand curve, the power system is able to sustain that surge and meets the load demand. In traditional power systems, power generation is increased to cope up with the increase in load demand. But, this practice is expensive and can not be implemented due to limited or unavailability of fuel and resources. Power plants can be extended upto a certain limit until there comes a point where this practice can no longer be economical. After years of hard work, researchers and engineers have come up with a new concept called as demand side management (DSM) which improves the power system in order to meet load demands [1]. DSM is described as the actions taken to manage the usage of energy by users in such a way that the required changes in the load curve are achieved. Many authors have explained the framework of DSM with different expressions and techniques. Most of the work presented in the past is based on a certain aspect of the DSM framework. They lack clear explanation on DSM programs and modes. Techniques cannot be distinguished from each other given in the previous literature. This chapter presents a detailed review on DSM framework covering each and every aspect. DSM is compared with conventional energy management system. Techniques are classified with respect to their implementation and usage. Residential DSM system is discussed in detail. This is a review-based work. Key contributions of this chapter are as follows; 1. DSM programs and strategies are differentiated with respect to their implementations and usage. 2. Residential DSM framework is explained in detail with categorization of domestic loads. 3. Objective functions and constraints of DSM are presented in equation form. 4. Few efficient models are discussed to implement DSM techniques. The overview of the chapter is given in Fig. 2. The chapter consists of the following sections; introduction to power systems is given in Sect. 1. Section 2 consists of conventional energy management systems and demand side management. Section 3 contains the work done in the past on demand side management implementation. DSM techniques and programs are given in Sect. 4. Residential DSM system is explained in Sect. 5. Architecture of the residential DSM is described in Sect. 6. Problem formulation for exact solution methods is given in Sect. 7. Section 8 consists of objective functions and constraints of DSM. Different modeling techniques are given in Sect. 9. Advantages and limitations in implementing DSM techniques are given in Sect. 10 and Sect. 11, respectively. Then, this chapter is concluded in Sect. 11.\n\nOptimization Solutions for Demand Side Management and Monitoring\n\n7\n\nFig. 2 Overview of the chapter\n\n2 From Conventional Energy Management to Demand Side Management There are two major techniques in power systems which are used to encounter predicted load demand, supply side management (SSM) and demand side management (DSM), as shown in Fig. 3 [2].\n\n2.1 Supply Side Management SSM SSM is defined as the measures that are taken to ensure reliable generation, transmission and distribution of power. SSM is usually associated with power generation only, but it also includes the measures that concern supply of power generation\n\nFig. 3 Techniques in power systems\n\n8\n\nZ. A. Shah et al.\n\nresources including coal, fossil fuels. The load profile can be improved when supply side management techniques are implemented to ensure smooth operation of generation, transmissions or distributions of power supply. In SSM, on-site generation techniques are also used to ensure smooth power supply [3]. After the implementation of SSM techniques, power systems become efficient and expenditure of the utility companies is decreased. The installed generating capacity of the power system increases as a result of SSM which in return decreases energy production cost and reduces environmental emission per unit. The reliability of the system also increases due to SSM. Supply side management consists of following activities [3]; • Supply and utilization of energy resources: It consists of environmentally friendly substitutes of fuel and use of renewable energy. • Generation and conversion of power: It consists of improvements in operation and upgrading of units in existing plants. • Transmission and distribution of electricity: It consists of reduction in line losses after reforming transmission and distribution networks [3]. 2.1.1\n\nAdvantages of SSM\n\nThe advantages of SSM are as following [1]; • Supply side management ensures efficient and low cost energy production, thus maximizing consumers’ value. • SSM enables the power systems to balance the supply and load demand without addition of unnecessary infrastructure. • SSM minimizes the environmental impact by efficient operation of power system. 2.1.2\n\nDisadvantages of Supply Side Management\n\nHowever, there are some disadvantages too which greatly affect this scheme, and are listed below; • Sometimes, load demand surpasses the power supply. Hence, power systems cannot meet the load demand. • SSM sometimes cannot be implemented due to lack or unavailability of resources such as finance or fuel. 2.1.3\n\nChallenges and Constraints of SSM\n\nSSM consists of all those actions which are taken to make power system efficient and reliable by managing generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Usually, users show interest toward demand side management rather than SSM because it is an old technique.\n\nOptimization Solutions for Demand Side Management and Monitoring\n\n9\n\nThe are many challenges in adopting SSM. First, technical staff need comprehensive data to implement SSM for a particular situation. In many cases, it is responsibility of the customers to take such measures to ensure smooth power operation that could result positively in the favor of the customer. Sometimes, balancing customers and supplier interests are very difficult due to the capital investment. Investors sometimes need incentives to take actions which result in increase in profit, and also effect on environment is decreased. Second is lack of capital funds to implement SSM. SSM, most of the times, produces significant effect on environment, but it requires to convince authorities on the expenditure. Sometimes short-term plan requires huge investment and that may or may not result in achieving long-term goal. There is sometimes lack of managerial and technical skills for adopting SSM. Sometimes a country does not has such advance technology to implement SSM techniques such as clean coal technology. These lack of managerial or technical skills lead to poor energy performance. Sometimes, there is availability of enough funds but due to poor technical and managerial skills, plant does not produce desired results. Maintenance is another issue involved in SSM. Training is required for technical staff to take small but early steps to ensure smooth operation of power, resulting in increase in cost, but the desired results are achieved. In some cases, there are enough funds to run a power plant. But to ensure smooth operation of plant, there is a requirement of collecting complete feedback data, so that in case of need, necessary actions are taken in time without disrupting power supply. In some cases, old machinery is replaced by new machines for implementing SSM. That requires good managerial and technical skill, that is another a major concern in adopting SSM.\n\n2.2 Demand Side Management SSM faces many challenges such as, increase in load demand, lack of resources, lack of data, lack of communication and security issues, which lead to a new technique called as demand side management. Installing new power plants is not the feasible solution to remove the gap between supply and demand. To cope with this problem, demand side management (DSM) is the viable solution. DSM urges load management on consumer side with respect to time and amount of use of electricity, so that there is an overall reduction in the system peak. Proper execution of DSM activity provides great help in balancing demand and supply. 2.2.1\n\nBackground of DSM\n\nThe term DSM was first introduced in 1973, after an energy crisis which took place in USA. It is also known as energy demand management with an aim to decrease peak demand of the power plant. DSM provides benefit for both utilities and consumers [2, 4].\n\n10\n\nZ. A. Shah et al.\n\nDSM is described as the actions taken to manage the usage of energy by users in such a way that the required changes in the load curve are achieved. Demand side management facilitates consumers by providing them incentives. As, DSM deals with usage and managing electrical load, external factors do not affect this process [5].\n\n2.2.2\n\nObjectives of Demand Side Management\n\nThe objective of DSM is to minimize peak load demand and to promote efficient energy tasks. Overconsumption in the electrical network can be achieved by • Energy conservation • Improving load profile The aim of DSM programs is to maximize end use efficiency to replicate/delay the requirement of new generating capacity.\n\n2.2.3\n\nDSM Framework\n\nDemand side management framework is given in Fig. 4. DSM objective function is defined first. Objective function attempts to maximize the output based on sets of constraints and relationship between decision variables. The constraints include resources, availability, capacity and limitation of the environments in which business is conducted. Then, DSM alternatives are identified from energy efficiency, demand response and strategy load growth. In next step, a technique is selected to implement. The technique is implemented to get desired results. Power systems are constantly monitored for feedback data during whole process. On the basis of feedback, DSM objective function is refined in first step, if desired objectives are not achieved.\n\nFig. 4 DSM framework\n\nOptimization Solutions for Demand Side Management and Monitoring\n\n11\n\n3 Literature Review Various researchers have proposed different techniques on implementing DSM. Authors in [6] discuss different techniques to implement DSM in different environments. A wide range of techniques is presented for developing a framework for vertically integrated and restructured industry environments. A new demand side integration (DSI) technique is implemented to achieve desired load shape objectives by relating traditional form of DSM technique to the new form. A variable subscription service (VSS) method is implemented in [7] to integrate DSM into power systems. A smart grid infrastructure is discussed in reference to implementation of DSM through VSS. Authors conclude that this method proves to be a flexible tool which can balance supply and demand while providing an opportunity of decisionmaking between grid-purchased power and other supply alternatives. Four cases are presented in [8] to implement DSM for smart power. Three intelligent systems including storage capacity, shiftable loads and batteries are modeled. A fixed tariff, a two-tariff structure and an hourly real-time tariff structure are implemented for comparison of the performance. In [9], authors discuss the integration of network planning with DSM for planning active distribution systems (ADS). Authors in [10] discuss three key stages in development of DSM. Impact of DSM programs on power consumption and conservation influencing terminal power efficiency is discussed. With the objective of energy conservation and reduction of emission, safeguard systems and incentive mechanism of DSM are presented. Authors conclude this work by discussing polices and regulations regarding implementation of DSM in China. Different demand response DR models under smart grid standards are given in [11]. General concept of DR is classified into two categories: wholesale and retail markets. After detailed literature review, it is concluded that DR program is dependent on prevailing electricity market conditions of a particularly region. Works presented in the literature review are academic in nature and can be extended to implement DR practically. A review is presented in [12] on issues regarding penetration of high renewables in power production. Simulations are conducted on the basis of collected field data on power consumption by refrigerators. Operation of refrigerators is scheduled with respect to the output of a small PV system. A comparison of results obtained is given in this work proving the superiority of presented work. An overview of DR on the basis of types and method from the prospective of buildings at the demand side is presented in [13]. Renewable generation resources, i.e., solar and wind power, are introduced in smart grid for smart power [14]. Forecast errors of wind speed and solar radiance are modeled in this work. A Latin hypercube sampling is implemented for plausible scenarios of renewable generators for day-ahead energy and reserve scheduling. Simulation results are obtained after implementing the suggested design in micro grid. An integrated resource planning model based on optimal DLC is presented in [15]. Aim of the presented technique is peak shaving and load shifting for cost reduction. An algorithm is presented to integrate distributed generation resources including PV, wind turbines, diesel engines, and batteries to DLC strategies. An\n\n12\n\nZ. A. Shah et al.\n\nautomation generation method of optimization is discussed in [16] for orderly power utilization. A genetic algorithm is implemented to establish evaluation index system, calculation model and searching for optimization scheme. After simulations and experiments, it is concluded that the presented design can be effective in optimizing resource allocation and maximizing social benefits. A robust optimization technique is presented in [17] to derive optimal unit commitment decision for reliability unit commitment run by ISOs/TROs. The problem is formulated as a multi-stage robust mixed-integer programming problem. Results show that the suggested technique achieves the desired objective function, i.e., maximizing social benefits. A realtime pricing technique is implemented in [18] through DR management in smart grid systems. The aim of this technique is to minimize peak-to-average load ratio (PAR). The designed method solves two stage optimization problem. On one-side, each user responds to prices announced by retailer and on the other hand retailer designs real-time prices in response to forecasted user’s actions. A demand response problem, whose operating conditions are modeled through mixed-integer constraints, is discussed in [19]. Operation time and energy consumption of devices are improved through demand response. There are uncertainties in forecasting wind power, which are dealt through demand response in [20] to provide power reserve. A stochastic model consisting of generating units and responsive loads with high penetration of wind power is proposed. The designed technique is developed as two-stage stochastic programs including electricity market and actual power operation. A DR provider approach is implemented on Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 30-bus test system over daily time horizon. The designed system reduces the operation cost and emission. A short-time hourly scheduling technique is implemented including cogeneration facility, traditional power units and heat only units in [21]. A DR program is implemented for achieving power and heat demands with cost reduction. Four cases are presented to analyze the performance of the presented program. A German balancing mechanism is analyzed in [22] to study demand response program. It is concluded that DR is undermined by three design aspects including minimum bidding volume, minimum bid duration and binding up and down bids. A home to grid DR program is presented in [23]. It uses user expected price as an indicator for differential pricing in domestic tariff. The proposed algorithm schedules the operation of electrical appliances by comparing user expected price to real-time pricing. An exponential smoothing model is used to forecast the desired amount of power, and Bayes theorem is used to determine the probability of power demand by appliances at given amount of time. A new market-based approach named contract for deferral scheme is presented in [24]. The authors present a detailed review on how need for grid capacity and defer demand-driven network investments can be reduced by integrating distributed generators, storage and demand response to network resources. A DR technique is implemented in [25] with the aim of developing framework to identify energy options for demand-supply matching and to determine which option is suitable for DR program. A DR framework is presented with combination of liquefied petroleum gas LPG-based combined heat and power CHP microgrid.\n\nOptimization Solutions for Demand Side Management and Monitoring\n\n13\n\nA new stochastic energy and reserve scheduling method considering different DR programs is given for microgrid [26]. Probability distribution function is used to model uncertainties caused by distribution generators. The proposed design is implemented on a microgrid consisting of different loads and generating units. In [27], DR techniques are categorized on the basis of a chosen criteria. A detailed review on DR programs is given. A hierarchical-based source-storage-load DR control system is explained in [28]. Objective of the suggested technique is to reduce the working cost. An optimal scheduling operation is introduced to optimize load curve and power output. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is implemented to solve the optimal problem. Simulations are performed to prove the effectiveness of the suggested model. With an aim to optimize hourly bids that microgrid aggregator submit to day-ahead market to increase its profit, a scenario-based stochastic programming framework is introduced in [29]. Due to the proposed design, DR program is integrated into microgrids through contractual agreements. The proposed design facilitates customers, microgrids operators and operation of system operator. Different risk management strategies are discussed in [30] for retail electricity providers to deal with uncertainties in day-ahead market. It also focuses on minimizing financial losses in market. For these purposes, a two-staged stochastic programming technique. A robust DR program is proposed in [31] for commercial buildings under load prediction uncertainty. Initial control signals are obtained through conventional genetic algorithm (GA). However, optimal control signals are got through Monte Carlo method. Through dynamic pricing technique, impact of load prediction uncertainty is studied. Taking consumption shifting constraints into account, a DR program is explained in [32]. It also focuses on distributed generators DG resource management through virtual power player (VPP) aiming at minimizing operational cost. Different modeling tools are explained in [33] for fixed and flexible loads with an aim to optimize energy dispatch. Using a case study of Corvo Island, Portugal, three different scenarios are simulated in Homer, EnergyPlan and in MATLAB. On the basis of results obtained, it is observed that modeling tools should be optimized by improving their optimization strategies to get more benefit of using DR programs. A method is proposed to balance load to determine low cost mix of DGs, DR and storage to replace conventional methods for a case study [34]. Results are obtained after implementing this technique on three different scenarios showing that by using presented technique, desirable results are achieved. A multi-timescale cost-effective power management algorithm is suggested in [35] for microgrid MG in islanded mode. The operation of MG is optimized through managing generation, storage and demand management. Batteries and electric water heaters are utilized in DR programs. First, two different ON/OFF strategies are presented for electric water heaters, and then power management algorithm is implemented to obtain optimized operation. To solve a multi-objective optimization problem for achieving optimal DR programming, artificial bee colony algorithm and quasi-static algorithm are implemented in [36]. There are some constraints regarding energy balance and operation which are taken into consideration for optimizing cost and performance of the power systems. Uncertainties are evaluated through stochastic technique to study the per-\n\n14\n\nZ. A. Shah et al.\n\nformance of the presented design. With the increase in use of renewable energy, there is an increase in challenge of balancing intermittent generation with demand variations. This problem is solved in [37] by introducing different demand control mechanism. A specific tariff design is proposed to get robust performances which reduces cost of energy. A detailed review on DSM techniques, implementation and projects is given in [38]. Authors in [38] discuss the implementation of DR in China from grid, community and user prospective. Authors finally conclude this work by indicating the issues regarding implementation of DR programs in China. Three different scenarios are discussed in [39] to integrate DR programs into electricity markets. The three scenarios are optimize procurement, offer as control reserve and avoid balancing energy. The results obtained after implementing the suggested model, show that there is 3% decrease in cost. A model-based assessment energy system model is presented in [40]. In this technique, a mixed energy system model is extended by flexible load to use suggested assessment model. Results prove that DR can economically substitute upto 10GW power plant. A load scheduling algorithm is suggested after the classification of appliances into five sets with respect to their energy utilization and operational characteristics in [41]. The load scheduling algorithm adopts time-of-use pricing, controls operation time and power usage of the appliances. A generalized Benders’ decomposition technique is proposed to solve mixed integer nonlinear programming. A battery-aided DR program is presented in [42] to reduce cost of energy in grid-tied systems including domestic and industrial sector. A continuous time block tariffing is suggested as pricing technique while considering nonlinear behavior of batteries. A method called as calculus of variation is also implemented to get closed form of analytical results. Results suggest that calculus of variation method gives better performance and is effective in cost reduction. A stochastic method is proposed for scheduling industrial virtual power player (IVPP) in [43]. DR program is introduced in the power system and with the help of the proposed stochastic method, operator can choose best DR program for scheduling IVPP. In mixed-integer nonlinear programming, a suitable technique is presented to achieve desired objectives. The IEEE reliability test system is applied to the presented design to validate obtained results. The Brazilian Electrical Regulatory Agency presents a mechanism to update tariff structure of distribution companies. In [44], this mechanism and its results are analyzed in detail. DR program is introduced, and its impact on energy prices, operating prices and on end-users is studied. The presented case is based on the actual data collected from Brazilian electrical system. The authors conclude this work by giving some guidelines to improve and implement this technique. A method is proposed for demand side load shift to increase reliability and to minimize nodal price of power systems [45]. In the proposed model, conventional electricity prices are replaced by nodal prices. Demand is mutually interacted with electricity prices. Through demand-price electricity matrix, DR is modeled. Using demand- price elasticity, demand side load shifts are found. Then the load shift, which is stochastic in nature, is measured using determined load shifts under contingencies. Through optimal power flow, reliability and nodal prices are investigated. A Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) is used for simulations to vali-\n\nOptimization Solutions for Demand Side Management and Monitoring\n\n15\n\ndate results. The concept of incentive payments in DR programs is explained in [46] through three different approaches considering different levels of consumer’s privacy. A concept of trade-offs between consumer’s privacy, resources and the reward that load aggregator get is analyzed. It is concluded that in centralized approach, resource exploitation and reward are sensitive to accuracy of load aggregator’s consumer cost curves approximations. To improve grid frequency regulation, a DLC method is presented for a dynamic model of variable speed heat pump (VSHP) [47]. To control input power of VSHP, a variable speed drive-controlled induction motor is also introduced in the system. An experimental room model is designed to analyze effect of DLC program on room temperature for two cooling systems in the room. A small signal analysis is performed on the system to study the transient behavior of VSHP and grid frequency regulation (GFR). Simulations are performed with an isolated microgrid implemented on the system designed to analyze results. In order to study grid frequency regulation, VSHP is integrated with battery energy storage systems (BEES) [48]. For this purpose, a power-hardware-in-the-loop setup is formulated in simulations to observe effect of VSHP and BEES on GFR. A new real-time GFR technique is implemented to eliminate deviations in frequency and reserve capacities of the generators. Simulation results prove that the presented VSHP and BEES can be used in effective frequency stability process. A new algorithm is presented to reduce power outages and peak average ratio [49]. To do so, forecasting of load, load shedding and DLC techniques are used. A daily schedule is formulated for intelligent electronic devices though Internet of things and stream analytics. Intelligent electronic devices are characterized on the basis of their demands, thermal comfort and load model. For implementing this algorithm, hundred different consumers are selected owning different devices. Results obtained after applying the algorithm prove the superiority of the presented design. A quantitative technique is presented in [50] to assess the advantages of controlling load in reinforcement costs of distribution networks. The outputs obtained through initial experiments lead to development of a linear model estimating change in demand due to DLC. The impact of DLC on reinforcements cost is studied in detail. An experimental survey is conducted in [51] to investigate the willingness of consumers for participating in DLC program. A manipulative experiment is conducted by conveying two sentence message to consumers to gain their trust for participating in the program. It is concluded that their distrust in utilities leads to reduction of willingness to participate in DLC program. A robust optimization method is adopted for optimal operation of microgrid [52]. A two-stage framework is presented to reduce uncertainties in renewable resources. The two-stage framework consists of one hour ahead charging and discharging of the storage systems and quarter hour ahead working of a DLC program. For this purpose, energy storage is scheduled and a DLC program is suggested. Results obtained suggest that the designed method achieves the desired objective; maximizing profit of microgrid. Results obtained are verified through IEEE 30-bus distribution system. A dynamic agent model is presented in [53] to study its impact on profitability of generators, cost and reserve margins. This model is implemented on alternative demand curves which are suggested for Penn-\n\n16\n\nZ. A. Shah et al.\n\nsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland (PJM) interconnections. It is concluded that after a sloped demand curve, the costs are low when compared to present requirements. Due to reduction of fluctuations in installed reserves, average installed capacity is less for same reliability. In [54], authors examine the procedure and contribution of DR programs and energy efficiency EE in forward capacity markets while considering a case study in UK. It is observed that EE mechanism is heavily influenced by regulatory utilities. It is seen that target of DR and EE is end-users. While defining capacity products, needs of the system and resources potential should be kept in consideration. It is suggested that barriers should be removed in implementation of the DLC programs. A high-resolution DSM model is proposed in [55]. In this work, main module is divided into many sub-modules to ensure reliable power system while maintaining standards and needs. A multi-source DSM method is explained in [56] to reduce peak load demand. Energy cost reduction is the main objective in designing distributed DSM system using Internet of things (IoTs) presented in [57]. A review on DSM integrated with smart grid SG is given in [58]. A DSM technique is proposed in [59] which is based on PV energy resource system to deal with increase in power consumption. A new DSM method having a feature of decision making is proposed in [60] to increase power consumption. A novel DSM technique based on EV storage systems to optimize electricity cost is proposed in [61]. Table 1 shows the literature survey on techniques implemented for DSM;\n\n4 Demand Side Management Programs and Techniques Demand side management programs and techniques are divided into following programs; energy efficiency, demand response and strategic load growth, and are shown in Fig. 5.\n\n4.1 Energy Efficiency (EE) It is a long-term strategy in which energy-efficient techniques are used to reduce consumption of energy and demand of load. It includes programs like enhancement of efficiency of domestic appliances and weatherization. Weatherization is a technique in which a building is protected against external elements including wind or sunlight, etc. It also includes upgradation of building for saving energy consumption and decreasing load demand. After implementing energy efficiency programs, cost of electricity and load demand during peak hours are reduced. It also delays the plan to expand power plant capacity [1].\n\nFeature\n\nWind-Driven optimization\n\nGreedy iterative algorithm\n\nReinforcement learning\n\nGenetic algorithm\n\nTime-of-use (TOU) based scheduling\n\nTime and energy consumption optimization of appliances Scheduling of electrical and thermal energy with cooperation of distribution generators Scheduling of consumption of electricity on the basis of forecasted price and decision for domestic and commercial sector While considering aggregated load, scheduling of domestic appliances Scheduling of domestic appliances while integrating renewable energy source\n\nScheduling of load and smart charging of the batteries Mixed linear and integer linear programming Scheduling of home appliances Multi-objective mixed integer programming Modeling of appliances on the basis of preferences Double cooperative game theory Scheduling of home appliances using electric vehicle, also scheduling appliances Game theoretic energy management Scheduling of appliances through electric bicycle and energy of utilities, selling back energy to utilities Quasi random process Recursive formula for load shifting\n\nLinear programming\n\nTechnique\n\nTable 1 Literature review with identification of features and objectives\n\n[68]\n\n[67]\n\nReduction of peak load, shifting of load and cost optimization Reduction of cost and time\n\n[72]\n\n[71]\n\nMinimizing operating cost without disturbing [69] human comfort Optimized cost and maintaining user’s [70] comfort\n\nEstimation of peak demand for residential sector Peak load and cost minimization\n\nBill reduction of users and load minimization [66] of utilities\n\n[65]\n\n[63] [64]\n\nOptimizing peak load and cost of electricity To minimize cost of electricity while considering preferences Reducing cost for user and utilities\n\nReferences [62]\n\nTo reduce cost and peak-to-average ratio\n\nObjectives\n\nOptimization Solutions for Demand Side Management and Monitoring 17\n\n18\n\nZ. A. Shah et al.\n\nFig. 5 DSM programs\n\nEE strategies include: • It includes adopting energy-efficient buildings and devices. • It includes to encourage users to adopt energy conscious behavior • It includes improving and conducting regular maintenance of electrical equipment to reduce energy loss using modern and optimized technologies. • It also includes improving efficiency of power transmission and distribution networks.\n\n4.2 Demand Response (DR) It is a manipulative short-term load program and is described as the modification in usage of electricity by end-user consumer from normal consumption in response to changes in any DR programs. As DR directly affects the load consumption, it is most used program in DSM [1, 73], which is also one of the advantages of this program. Demand response is implemented through many ways including valley filling technique in which loads are build in off-peak hours. Peak clipping is a technique in which load is reduced during peak hours. Load shifting is another technique which is the combination of both peak clipping an valley filling techniques. Peak clipping and valley filling are shown in Fig. 6. DR program is classified into following: price-based DR, incentive/event-based DR and reduction bids. Classification of DR is shown in Fig. 7.\n\n4.2.1\n\nPrice-Based Demand Response\n\nIn this program, customers are offered static or dynamic pricing scheme to control load profile of end-user consumers [74]. Some of the programs in price-based demand response are depicted in Fig. 8 and are given below;\n\nOptimization Solutions for Demand Side Management and Monitoring\n\n19\n\nFig. 6 DR techniques\n\nFig. 7 DR programs\n\nFig. 8 Price-based DR\n\nFlat Pricing A technique in which unchanged prices are offered allowing consumers to consume electricity up to maximum amount, even if there is a change in load demand, is called as flat pricing. It is often termed as welfare pricing scheme. If there is change in aggregated load, users are not charged for that change. Hence, there is no financial incentive for consumers to reschedule their use of electricity. So, in case of unplanned electricity consumption, users do not have to pay high bills [74].\n\n20\n\nZ. A. Shah et al.\n\nTime-of-Use Pricing In traditional utility prices, price of electricity per kilowatt hour is set, which can be changed during different seasons. So, a sliding rate is introduced and is structured according to peak and off-peak time of day called as time-of-use pricing [2]. A TOU-based Monte Carlo simulation technique is implemented on smart grid pilots in China [23]. It is concluded that from the designed controller, efficient operation of smart grid is achieved. A TOU-based quadratic programming and stochastic optimization techniques are implemented in [24]. A meta-heuristic solution technique is implemented in [25] for sustainable manufacturing systems. A mixed-integer linear programming-based TOU and Gaussian mixture-model-based TOU technique are implemented in [26, 75], respectively.\n\nCritical Peak Pricing (CPP) When utilities observe or anticipate sudden high market prices of electricity or when power systems went into emergency situation, then critical peak pricing is introduced for critical events during specific time of the day [2]. In [27], CPP and TOU are implemented on the case study. Results show that CPP is effective than TOU in terms of cost reduction. A CPP decision model is implemented in [28]. Numerical results prove the effectiveness of the designed controller.\n\nPeak Load Pricing In this program, high price is charged when there is peak of the load [74].\n\nReal-Time Pricing (RTP) In this program, a tariffed retail is charged for delivered electrical power which vary hour to hour [2]. A RTP technique is introduced in [19] to analyze energy consumption in wind generation. A day-ahead unit commitment model is used to estimate systems operation in wind generation. A case study is presented in [76] to find the effect of RTP on the electricity supply. RTP-based DSM controllers are implemented in residential buildings [20–22].\n\nDay-Ahead RTP It is a type of real-time pricing in which market purchases or sells electricity at bidding ahead prices for following day [74].\n\nOptimization Solutions for Demand Side Management and Monitoring\n\n21\n\nFig. 9 Incentive/event-based DR\n\n4.2.2\n\nIncentive or Event-Based Demand Response\n\nIn this program, customers are offered specific DR requests and in case of acceptance of that request, customers are offered time-varying or fixed payments. Incentivebased methods are discussed in detail in [29, 30]. Incentive-based programs are implemented on load curve of peak day in Iranian power station to assess the performance of these programs [31]. Some of these programs are shown in Fig. 9 and explained below [74].\n\nDirect Load Control Direct load control (DLC) being a major part of DR is a technique in which operator can remotely manage the use of electricity of end-users. Thus, system operator becomes able to bring power system in normal state by applying preventive control. DLC enables utilities to remotely control the load demand by modifying appliances [1]. DLC changes the load profile by introducing a program in distribution networks or controlling user’s appliances through information technology (IT). The devices that are controlled through IT include washing machine, heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC, water heaters, etc. This program encourages customers to cooperate with utilities. DLC guarantees the reduction in load demand of utilities which as a result leads to reduction of additional production of energy. In some cases, customers face penalty for noncooperation with utilities. On the basis of time-of-use tariff, residential and small customers pay their electricity bills. From pre-specified optimization program, parameters like on-time and delay-time are obtained, which play an important role in implementing DLC. A DLC technique based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization technique is implemented in [32]. A cooperative game DLC technique is implemented in [33]. DLC-based controlling techniques are implemented to optimize operation of air conditioning loads [34–37].\n\n22\n\nZ. A. Shah et al.\n\nInterruptible/Curtailable Load Interruptible program is an old relief program for utilities in which customers are provided an option to remove some appliances during emergency conditions. However, in curtailable program, customers are asked to reduce load upon asked by utilities. Curtailable program is designed for commercial and industrial sector’s customers. In interruptible/curtailable load program, customers are offered discounts in bills in exchange for agreeing to reduce load during system contingencies. Customers can be penalized, if they do not take certain measures. Interruptible/curtailable load program is different from emergency demand response program in a way that they are proposed by electric utility and utility service has capacity to apply the program when required [1]. Interruptible programs are offered to those commercial or industrial customers who have ability to shut their appliances for small span of time or switch to other back up generators to fulfill their load demand. Customers with 1 MW load are required in this program including manufacturing plant, water treatment plant or food processing plants. The customers with backup generation capability are also included in this program, i.e., hospitals or data centers. For this effort, customers receive interruptible rates of electricity, which are lower than the normal industrial prices. Sometimes, customers receive incentives or discount for interrupted service.\n\nEmergency Demand Response (EDR) Program When power systems go to overload conditions, operator determines amount and time to curtail the load to bring the power system back into normal state. EDR is then implemented with certain constraints and parameters. This program will determine that which house can be added in the program so that it will not affect cost and disrupt electricity [1].\n\nCapacity Market Program Capacity market programs are usually considered as a form of insurance because in this program, customers are committed for providing pre-specified load curtailment when system is subjected to contingencies. A capacity market program is implemented on a case study in England [38]. A detail framework is given in for evaluation of capacity market program [39]. Capacity market program is introduced in Russia to evaluate its performance with respect to cost and quality of generation [40]. A capacity market program is implemented in China. Results show the positive impact of designed technique on power system [41].\n\nOptimization Solutions for Demand Side Management and Monitoring\n\n4.2.3\n\n23\n\nReduction Bids\n\nCustomers in reduction bids offer incentives to utility by offering reduction in load demand capacity and requested price [1]. A demand bidding program is introduced for reducing peak load. The results obtained after implementation of said program proved the effectiveness of proposed design [42]. In this program, customers are offered payments in return of reduction in load. There are two categories that are included in this program on the basis of structure of bid. Under this program, users that participate submit their bids to utility or system operator. Generally, a day-ahead bid is chosen in which a specific amount of load is shed at given time. Bids are analyzed with system forecast and supply bids by electricity market administrator. Then, the administrator determines the most economical supply and load demand options. A demand bidding program based on stochastic model is proposed in for distributed energy resources [43].\n\n4.3 Strategic Load Growth An increase in electrical load is called as strategic load growth. It is induced by utilities by using thermal storage and heat pumps, etc [1].\n\n4.4 Energy Conservation (ENCON) The aim of ENCON is to reduce the power consumption loss in power system. The methods used for end-user to improve energy consumption quality are included in ENCON. Various power-saving techniques such as use of high-efficiency motors, variable speed drivers, e"
