        "text": "VERY MILD. CET value=7.1degC, amongst the top 5 mild Februarys in the 20th century. The anomaly on the 'whole-series' was well in excess of +3C & it lies firmly within the 'top-10' since 1659. Of particular note, we had to wait until the notably WARM period of the 1990s before this value was exceeded, with 7.3degC in the Februarys of 1990 & 1998.\n\nA spectacular dry DUSTFALL: affected much of England and Wales on February 21st.\n\n26th/27th: Deep LOW crossed Ireland & moved towards NE Scotland, with a reported PRESSURE of 953mbar at Dundee. WINDS to the south of its track brought WIDESPREAD DAMAGE - some DEATHS with communications widely disrupted. At Southport (Lancashire) around dawn, the WIND averaged BF11 (>=56 knots / 64 mph), with a GUST here of 80 kn. A passenger train was overturned as it crossed a viaduct in north Lancashire. In Ireland (then still part of the UK), the WIND was even stronger - possibly the worst storm (of wind) across the island since January, 1839. In Phoenix Park, Dublin nearly 3000 trees were blown down and much DAMAGE was caused to property in the City. Other towns/cities in Ireland suffered, e.g. Cork (a girl killed) and Belfast. Lamb reports that at Douglas, Isle of Man, the STORM of the night of the 26th/27th was thought to be 'probably of almost unprecedented violence'. Many shipwrecks both close inshore and on the high seas. (details from 'Weather Eye', Ian Currie & HS/23). These 5 months were all notably WETTER than average: the EWP % were 129%, 128%, 168%, 160% and 132% (respectively, relative to the 1961-90 mean), which is an average of 143% overall. The often persistent & widespread RAINFALL gave rise to much FLOODING across the south of England, particularly along the Thames Valley. As noted below, October was also very wet, and adding this month in, the six month's total EWP was 715mm (161%). Specifically for the London area (based on Kew), the summer period in 1903 was the WETTEST in that series which started in 1697 ('Weather' October 2004/R MetS/Mayes).\n\nAs to TEMPERATURES, for the three summer months (June, July & August), the anomaly on CET for these was -1.3, -0.6 & -1.3C. For Kew specifically, the mean TEMPERATURE anomaly was -2C, with June notably COLD. The anomaly on June MAXIMUM temperature at Kew was -3C. Using the Camden Square (Westminster) record, it was the COLDEST June for 46 years. A notably COLD summer; Although often portrayed as an era with wonderful summers, the Edwardian & immediate pre-Great War years had an above-average incidence of what can only be described as indifferent/poor such seasons. The notably fine summer of 1899 (q.v.) was not equalled or bettered until 1911 (q.v.) and this in turn wasn't matched until 1933! Looking specifically at the Central England Temperature (CET) series for the years 1900 to 1914, and using an 'all-series' reference value of 15.3degC (c.f. 1981-2010 value of 15.9degC), then of these 15 years, only three (1900, 1901 & 1911) had a +ve anomaly >=0.5C, and of course only 1911 stands out (+1.7C). Conversely, no fewer than 7(!) summers had negative anomalies >=0.5 (1902, 1903, 1907, 1909, 1910, 1912 and 1913). Of these, five (1902, 1903, 1907, 1909 & 1912) had anomalies >=-1.0C. So the 'bias' for this pre-Great War period was strongly towards cooler-than-average summers, with a strong tendency to 'clustering' of the poor seasons.\n\nLooking specifically at 1907, with a CET of 13.6degC (-1.7C/all-series LTA), this was ranked (equal with 1823) fourth COLDEST in that long series; only 1860, 1816 & 1725 were colder. Both June & July had anomalies close to -2C on all-series LTA, with August not quite so anomalously cold. [CET] One of the 15 or so COLDEST summers using the CET record (13.9degC / anomaly on 'all-series' of -1.4C) across England & Wales [in a record back to 1659].\n\n> June was the equal (with 1916 and 1972) COLDEST of the 20th century, with CET=11.8degC, anomaly around two-degrees C below the LTA (whichever series is used), and the second-COLDEST (with the other two noted) June in the entire series. A day MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE of just 10degC (presumably this was registered as 50degF) was recorded in Oxford and Bath on the 6th. There was more outstandingly COLD, WET (some significant THUNDERSTORMS) & DULL weather from the 10th to the 12th, and also 20th to 28th. The Trooping the Colour in London was abandoned on the 24th. June was also a very DULL month, with no sunshine at all in London from the 2nd to the 6th.\n\n> July continued WET, with significant / widespread THUNDERSTORMS in the last week of the month - VIOLENT THUNDERSTORMS on the 25th, particularly in Fife. (See also entry against summer 1907, above)[CET] Notably WARM (& for many a SUNNY - see below) summer; high PRESSURE was near or over the British Isles for many weeks at a time, with southern areas especially favoured. One of the top 7 or so WARMEST of the 20th century, and just inside the 'top-10' all-series summers (as at 2013). Using the CET series (began in 1659), the values for the three 'standard' summer months of June, July & August (with all-series anomalies) were: 14.5 (+0.2), 18.2 (+2.3), 18.2 degC(+2.6C). The July value placed that month just outside the 'top-10' for that month, but that for August is ranked about 6th or 7th: certainly in the 'top-10' in this very long series! All the more remarkable, as the 50-years 1900-1949 contained only 4 VERY WARM summers, compared for example with 7 in the period 1950-1999.\n\nMAXIMUM TEMPERATURE on 9th August at Raunds (Northamptonshire) and Canterbury (Kent) 36.7degC (98degF/converted?). Until the Augusts of 1990 & 2003, the highest known / accepted in UK).\n\nJuly 1911 was a spectacularly SUNNY (& DRY) month. There was an average of over 10 hours of bright sunshine (as recorded by the Campbell-Stokes recorder [CSR]) over much of southern England. 384 hours of bright SUNSHINE were recorded at Eastbourne and Hastings, East Sussex during this month, and these are thought to be the highest sunshine totals recorded anywhere for any month in the UK. (NB: in July, not June!). For the SE of England as a whole, with something like 300-350 hours of BRIGHT SUNSHINE, this month (with July 2006) is regarded as the SUNNIEST month (any month) on record, though comparison with late 20th century / 21st century figures are difficult due to changing instrumentation.\n\nSummer 1911 overall was DRY, with large areas of central-southern England, the south Midlands and parts of eastern Scotland having less than 50% of long-term RAINFALL. The summer included an exceptionally DRY July - in the 'top-5' of dry such-named months in the EWP series. A longer period (April to September) was also notably DRY, at least over England, where approximately <70% of the long-term average RAINFALL fell. (EWP)\n\n[ Of some political note, on the 10th August, 1911, in the midst of this protracted hot spell, the Parliament Bill (later Act) passed through the House of Lords by a majority of 17; this was a highly significant event in the progress of parliamentary democracy in the United Kingdom, and effectively the Act (when granted Royal Assent 18th August) removed the ability of un-elected peers to obstruct the will of the elected House of Commons. ] As might be expected given the excessive RAIN (see below), TEMPERATURES & SUNSHINE values were distinctly disappointing. Because the mean CET for June & July were not too far from the all-series average, the final all-season mean of 14.3degC was not a 'record-breaker', coming roughly 30th COLDEST in the list. What made this summer stand out was the persistent COLD of August: the CET value was 12.9degC (-2.7C on all-series mean), and as such was the COLDEST such-named month in that long series. Although we don't have homogeneous SUNSHINE series for the time (across the UK), individual stations give a flavour of the DULL weather. At Kew Observatory for example, all three months had below-average sunshine, with July at 76% and August at 58% of the (then) long-term values. However, other summers of the time (e.g. 1909 & 1913) also had equally low (or lower) aggregate totals over these three months. [ According to an article in 'Weather' (see reference), the weather (and hence the temperature levels) were possibly affected by a veil of high-altitude volcanic dust etc., from an Alaskan volcano that erupted in early June of this year. ] (Ref: 'Weather'/July2011/Kendon & Prior & CET)\n\nNotably WET for the months of June, July & August. 410 mm in the EWP series ~ 200% of modern-day averages. The WETTEST such defined summer in the EWP series (as of 2013). Over twice the average amount of RAIN fell in a broad swathe from Cornwall to Norfolk, with >250% in places. However, London & the Home Counties, though still generally receiving well above-average RAINFALL, 'only' achieved anomalies around 125-150%.\n\n> August 1912 was EXCEPTIONALLY WET with 193 mm of RAIN, the wettest such-named month in the EWP series. Severe FLOODING occurred across many parts of east & central England. (EWP)\n\n[ It is worth emphasising that this exceptionally WET, COOL & DULL summer came a year after one of the most glorious summers in anyones record! Doom-mongers in the climate-change community need to be aware of these historic precedents. ] A WIDESPREAD SEVERE NORTHERLY GALE (STORM TO SEVERE STORM-FORCE in southeast England) & associated BLIZZARD affected much of East Anglia, the east & south Midlands, parts of Southeast England & the West of England/West Country during the 27th & 28th March, 1916. Large numbers of trees brought down due to combination of wet / sticky SNOW freezing on boughs, and HIGH WINDS/northerly (over eastern areas to at least Beaufort Force 9 or 10, with Kew Observatory reporting Force 11 for a short time early evening of the 28th as the parent low moved NE across SE England and onto the Netherlands by the 29th**). The SNOW set in after nightfall of the 27th, and in some places lasted over 24hr. SNOW depths were difficult to ascertain due to DRIFTING / BLIZZARD-conditions, but some reports of 15-20cm over East Midlands seem credible. 48hr RAIN/SNOW totals in a broad swathe from the Wash / Norfolk, across the northern & far western Home Counties, to Somerset, Devon & Cornwall exceeded 25-30mm, and in the Fens/East Midlands, upwards of 50-60mm fell, with stations in Northamptonshire recording over 70mm for these 48hr. (It was also very WET (mixed RAIN/SNOW here) in Cornwall.) Much DISRUPTION to transport, both road & railway, across the southeastern 'quadrant' of England - also large number of telephone / telegraph lines cut due to weight of snow. At Margate (Kent) much DAMAGE to shop fronts, with Dover recording GUSTS to 75kn.\n\n(**lowest PRESSURE estimated for this system 968mbar in Lyme Bay at 0100GMT on the 28th.) [ based on article in 'Weather' / RMetS 2004 ] A WET summer in the EWP series, with 138% of LTA (1916-1950). It was especially WET in the Kew Observatory series: 314mm was recorded there for the three summer months, representing nearly twice the long-term average. I think it reasonable to assume that this excessive RAINFALL was also representative of conditions across the Channel along the northern portions of the War Front (French/British/German).\n\nOn the 28th of June, a shallow depression moving eastward along the English Channel brought remarkably HEAVY RAINFALL to a large area of southern England: falls in excess of 50 mm were recorded from Cornwall to Sussex with a daily/24hr RAINFALL total of 242.8mm recorded at Bruton in Somerset (about 127mm in 3 hours and 165mm in 5 hours). With only sporadic thunder, the bulk of the fall was made up by a spell of steady/heavy rain over a wide of areas during the night. The Bruton event is the highest known for June, and amongst the top 3 or 4 for the entire record. 213.1mm was recorded nearby in the Quantocks, at Aisholt, and 150mm at Street, Glastonbury. Needless to say, such rain led to FLOODING & caused a local dam wall to be breached, which contributed to downstream flooding on the river Stour. THUNDERSTORMS in central and northern England on the 29th May in 1920 resulted in serious damage, and people were DROWNED in their homes: in Louth, Lincolnshire, at least 104mm of RAIN fell in two hours, flooding the town. The \"Louth storm\" was probably one of the most SEVERE in the 20th century. A depression moved north on the 29th. A storm developed on its cold front. Not only was the rain heavy at Louth, but at Elkington Hall, three miles to the west, 117mm (or 119mm, sources differ) fell in three hours from about 2pm. Even more probably fell to the west, and recent estimates state at least 150mm during the storm, possibly much more. As water fell on the Lincolnshire Wolds, the River Lud rose by 6 feet (about 2 m) in 10 minutes, with FLOODING, destruction of bridges, and 23 people were drowned as a torrent 200 yards wide swept through the village of Louth, which formed a bottleneck to the river and its tributaries. The river rose to 15 feet (4.6m) above normal, in just 15 minutes if eye-witness reports can be believed. (NB: on the same day 42mm fell in twenty minutes and a total RAINFALL for the storm of 82mm at Leyland, Lancashire.) Lowest PRECIPITATION TOTAL in any calendar year recorded at a station in Margate, Kent: 236 mm [ but note possible gauge error ]. Part of the notable DROUGHT of 1921: one of the longest of the 20th century, lasting for almost a calendar year. In east Kent, barely half of the long-term average fell; however for western Scotland it was an unusually WET year.\n\nIn the EWP series, this was the DRIESTyear in the 20th century, with just 629mm of RAIN. (The driest in the entire series is thought to be 1788 with 614mm -- so this is the second driest in this series. However, note that this year was a 'true' anomaly in that the rest of the decade had average or above-average PRECIPITATION.)(see also 1714, 2003).\n\n> The 17 month period August 1920 to December 1921 (which includes the whole of 1921 of course) is regarded as the second-DRIEST (or second 'most-intense' DROUGHT) across the 'English lowlands' (after that of 1995-1997/q.v.) [Kendon et.al., 'Weather'/RMetSoc/April 2013] A WINTRY spell much of the UK 30th October - 2nd November: On the last two days of October, parts of Scotland had HEAVY SNOWFALL with West Linton, Borders having up to 20cm; the Islands of Lewis and Harris had HEAVY SNOWFALL between 1st & 2nd November. Further south, SNOW/SNOW SHOWERS fell widely across the English Midlands & the SE of England on the 31st October. 5 cm level snow was recorded at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire & a covering was observed, at least for a time, across the Chilterns [hardly surprising], but apparently snow for the most part in these areas melted rapidly before registering an official 'snow-lying' day.\n\n[ This may be the last time before October 2008 (q.v.) that snow LAY in parts of southern England in that month - some doubt here. Remember that there is a distinction between snow (or sleet) falling and lying - for the latter, snow must cover more than half the ground at 09GMT observation hour to count. Afternoon/evening snow on one day can often melt sufficiently by the following morning (particularly if ground is warm), such that it does not count as an official day of snow lying. ] An exceptionally DRY spell over England & Wales, with an anomaly of roughly 30% across the three months. April, with a total of just 7 mm, was the DRIEST such-named month in that series, and the fifth-DRIEST any-named month (last updated 2013). It was even drier along parts of the English south coast; for example, at Poole (Dorset), no rain was recorded at all in April, and at Mayflower Park, Southampton, just 0.8 mm of RAIN was logged this month. (EWP, DWxB). In Scotland, not so dry, with anomalies around 70%.\n\nDry springs can be notably chilly, but this spring included the second-WARMEST March in the CET record [as of 2014]. With a value of 9.1degC, this represented an anomaly of around +4C on the long-term average, and was only just pipped to 'top spot' by 1957, with a value of 9.2degC. Despite the undoubted warming of the lower troposphere in recent years, no March since this latter date has come close to equalling or exceeding those values. (CET) A notably WET month: in the 'top-5' wet Januarys by the EWP series. The area between London and Norwich (across the northern Home Counties and into East Anglia) had 300% of average RAINFALL, e.g. 128mm of RAIN at Chelmsford (circa 220%). There are several reports of significant FLOODING due to the high rainfall totals.\n\nQuite a 'SNOWY' month overall. 25th/26th: Widespread SNOW southern England and South Wales, with significant SNOWFALL in parts of the London area. Depths of up to 14 inches (35cm) were measured on Hampstead Heath. In central London though, nothing like the amount of snow due possibly to the heat-island in the City. A SEVERE SNOWSTORM over the higher ground in the Southwest of England & South Wales. 50cm of SNOW in Berkshire, Wiltshire & Hampshire. Much DRIFTING in the strong winds. In South Wales, SNOW caused a train to stop, while in parts of Berkshire, Hampshire & Wiltshire, snow fell to a depth of 60cm. 2000 people lost their telephone lines in Reading. On the 26th, the Cantref Reservoir in the Brecon Beacons, received 35cm of SNOW and on the morning of the 26th, Stanford Dingley (Berkshire) had nearly 50cm. DRIFTS of 3.5m were also reported on the high ground in SW England over these two days. The winter of 1939-40 was not so intense as that of 1894-95, but was longer and SNOWIER. Using the CET record, the overall value for the combination of December, January & February was 1.5degC, some 2C below average TEMPERATURE. The key 'cold' month was January (see below).\n\nJanuary 1940 was one of the 20-or-so COLDEST Januarys in the CET record, with a value of -1.4degC (roughly 4.5C below the all-series average), and just outside the 'top-10' of coldest such-named months. The month started cold, but with a mild spell towards the end of the first week; however, bitterly COLD conditions set in with a vengeance during the second week, with some days of persistent FREEZING conditions, frequent SNOWFALL and biting winds. ICE FLOES were reported in the lower Thames Estuary ( TEC ). The month was notable for a GLAZED FROST event at the end of January 1940 (26th) as the bitterly cold conditions of the previous three weeks started to be displaced, though there was more significant SNOWFALL 27th/28th before the milder weather finally took over by the month's end.\n\nJanuary 1940 was quite a SNOWY month, especially for Scotland & England. On the 16th/17th, SNOW occurred in many parts of the UK. It was heavy in eastern parts of Kent & east Sussex, where deep DRIFTS occurred. 30 cm (possibly more) at Eastbourne, Sussex. On the 26th HEAVY SNOW over the north; four feet (circa 120cm) of SNOW in Sheffield on the 26th and 10 foot (circa 300 cm) DRIFTS reported in Bolton, Lancashire on the 29th. Most of England & Scotland experienced SNOWFALL during this last week. Much of Yorkshire, Derbyshire & Cheshire received between 30 and 60 cm. In Sheffield (South Yorkshire), 120cm of SNOW fell. The West Highland railway line in Scotland was blocked, with some villages isolated. By the 28th, 27 cm of snow lay at Pontefract (West Yorkshire), while as a direct comparison London only reported 15cm. On the 29th, the SNOWFALL on the western parts of the Pennines made a train snowbound a few miles south of Preston (Lancashire) for 36 hours. At Crawford (southern Scotland), 400 passengers were stranded for 6 days. [needs checking / corroboration].\n\n[ Although the land war, as far as western Europe was concerned, was very much in its 'phoney' phase, hostilities on the high seas ( surface & submarine raiders ) ensured that trade was hit from early in the War; reduction of supplies was aggravated by the sometimes severe weather, though we were more self-sufficient (in food terms) than we are now in the 21st century, and our expectations as regards food availability and variety are higher in modern times. ] The three winters of the early war years (1939/40 to 1941/42) were notable for some harsh conditions. In the '39/'40 winter, not only was snow a significant problem, but it contained the longest-lasting RAIN-ICE event (27th January to 3rd February, 1940) known for these islands, with severe transport dislocation, and many injuries on the ice in a large area from north Wales across parts of the south-west Midlands to the southwest and central-southern England. During the same period, a great SNOW storm with a VIOLENT GALE affected southeastern England with snow drifts well above 15 ft. January, 1940, with a CET of minus 1.4degc, was the coldest (to that date) of the century, only later beaten by January 1963(q.v). On January 19th 1942, a great SNOWSTORM affected much of Britain with much dislocation of life. February 1942 was notably COLD - one of the 10 coldest Februarys in the CET series. The severity of these winters caused much hardship, particularly as the convoys across the North Atlantic were being severely interrupted by U-Boat attacks. However, its worth noting that the severe weather affected much of the continent of Europe as well!\n\nDecember 1941 and January 1942 saw the harsh Russian winter weather put paid to the German advance on Moscow. From early in December 1941, TEMPERATURES just outside Moscow were down to (minus)45degC or lower, over a full SNOW cover. The main attack on the capital occurred on 22nd December, but by then conditions for troops were extreme, who lacked proper winter clothing & whose tanks, guns etc., had not been 'winterised'. Military historians suggest that the failure of German High Command to press home the attack on Moscow in the late summer of 1941 was a key error, meaning that major offensive operations had to occur in the depths of the Russian winter. By January, 1942, TEMPERATURES as low as (minus)52degC were being recorded. Estimates are that more German soldiers died from bitter cold than from combat action; however, Soviet losses, both military and civilian, were also high. (Ref.14) The most critical phase of the second World War for the western Allies was the landing of thousands of troops and large amounts of material in the initial attack on the German occupied north coast of France (Normandy beaches). The attack was postponed from the 5th to the 6th based on a weather forecast of unsuitable weather, and even on the 6th, conditions were not ideal, with landing craft having problems with HEAVY SWELL. One of the important factors in the decision to delay by one day was that RAF Bomber Command and USAAF Strategic Air Force could not attack important targets in the invasion area (and the key 'junction' / supply points to the rear), without some prospect of sighting the targets: this also applied to the Allied naval forces, as they needed to 'spot' shore targets for success. As it turned out, if the attack had taken place on the 5th, heavy and extensive CLOUD COVER over northern France would have seriously hampered these operations - by the morning of the 6th, the cloud had either cleared, or become 'lifted' and well broken, allowing more accurate (for the times) targeting.\n\n> The month of June, 1944 was most unusually unsettled, and two weeks later, June 19th/20th, a MAJOR STORM affected the Channel area disrupting follow-up operations. A strong northeast WIND - onshore to the post-invasion bridgehead beaches - at least Beaufort force 7 at times, was accompanied by thick, LOW CLOUD. This disturbed weather lasted to at least 22nd June with only slight easing of the wind. These conditions caused havoc to the build of forces and supplies, but by this time, the foothold in France was sufficiently firm (and German forces were anyway on the 'back foot' - at least for a time), and the liberation of western Europe was never really in doubt. (but see also 1944: December - the 'Battle of the Bulge').\n\n[NB: May 1944 was largely a 'benign' month - with a lot of fine, anticyclonic weather which aided the build-up of forces and positioning around the southern and western coasts of Britain and Northern Ireland. Indeed, it transpires that German forces (von Rundstedt / Rommel) in France were on a high state of alert, fearing the attack during May. By early June, German meteorologists and intelligence assessed that the threat was less, due to the weather deterioration, and withdrew some forces for training etc. The fact that the Allied forces (Eisenhower) decided to 'go' in a \"WEATHER-WINDOW\" in an otherwise unfavourable set-up may have caught German High Command off-balance. The STORM of the 5th was also helpful in keeping Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft on the ground, so failing to spot that the Allied forces had had a 'false start'! ] German High Command asked for climatological information on when was the best time to launch a counter-attack (to oppose the US/British/Commonwealth/Free-Europe forces sweeping across northern France and the Low Countries). Conditions required were that CLOUD COVER should be so complete & persistent that allied aircraft could not define targets (the German air-force, the Luftwaffe, was essentially of little use to oppose the allied air-fleets supporting ground operations). The period chosen by German staff meteorologists was early to mid-December, and on the 12th, the date of attack was set for the 16th. The \"Ardennes Offensive\" (as German High Command named the operation) progressed well as allied air forces could not support ground-troops safely, and as there was a snow-cover, the radar altimeters were not accurate for precision bombing. However, by the 23rd, cloud was lifting/breaking and the first allied attack and support sorties (food, ammunition etc.), were flown. The German attack ran out of steam, and on 3rd January, 1945 (despite heavy SNOWFALL), a renewed thrust by US & allied forces began & by 16th January, all territory lost to the Ardennes Offensive (or \"Battle of the Bulge\") was re-taken. (Ref.14). COLDEST February in the CET record, and coldest February at Edinburgh since 1764. One of the HARSHEST winters experienced in the British Isles, though there was little hint of severe weather until after mid-January, when pressure rose from a High over Greenland, extending across to Scandinavia & leading to bitter easterly airflow for most. Also regarded as the SNOWIEST winter in the century, and for perhaps back to the middle of the previous century. (see 4. below)\n\nThe winter continued at its most SAVAGE in March, 1947, hitting particularly hard at a time of fuel and food shortages after the second World War. Significant adverse effects for upland farmers, such that many abandoned their way of life, most notably in Wales & the North of England.\n\nSome notes from the usw ng: \"The worst of the weather began in late January and the spell did not finally relinquish its grip until mid March. Some very HEAVY SNOWFALL - a sequence of severe BLIZZARDS led to accumulations estimated at between 50 and 120 cm across the English lowlands, with drifts often in excess of 10 feet, sometimes 15 feet (quite remarkable compared with late 20th / early 21st century experience). The Second World War had been over for only 18 months, fuel was rationed, as well as food and clothing. Power cuts were common, frequent and widespread, and there was a shortage of coal (the main source of heat other than gas), due to transport problems, and the need to divert coal to the power stations. Mean TEMPERATURE below 0degC for 9 weeks. Bulldozers were diverted from bomb clearance to snow clearance. Ice-breakers had to be used in the River Medway (no dates or further details for this) & ICE FLOES were reported in the lower Thames & its Estuary / TEC. There were severe losses to agriculture; 2 million sheep died, and the FROSTS destroyed much of the late potato crop. The aftermath was equally severe, with widespread burst pipes, local flooding as snow melted: winter of extreme misery.\n\nTHE SNOWY WINTER OF 1947: This event began late, as up until mid-January, although there had been cold spells, the weather was not particularly extreme. Includes the coldest February (by CET = minus 1.9degC) in that series, and you had to go back to 1895 for a comparable value (minus 1.8). This is now thought to be the snowiest winter of the 20th century (and perhaps the snowiest since 1814), with some snow falling somewhere across the country between 22nd January and 17th March & although some lowland areas in southern England & more generally in the west had little lying snow, for much of the country, there was continuous SNOW cover from the last third of January until roughly mid-March & the greater part of the UK had some form of snow cover continuously from 27th January to the 13th March. Level snow depths exceeded 2ft (circa 60cm) and there was much drifting. Much dislocation (railways particularly badly affected - a vital part of the infrastructure at this time) and great hardship emphasized the reduced circumstances the general population were enduring after the recent War."
