Fires broke out in parts of London, but evening thunderstorms brought a respite.\n\nPinned\n\nLONDON — Britain made meteorological history on Tuesday when temperatures in some places topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time ever recorded in the United Kingdom, as a second straight day of record-setting heat gripped parts of Europe.\n\nFires raged in France, Spain and even areas of London, as the hot, dry conditions strained emergency services and brought misery to areas unaccustomed to such sweltering summers. By evening in Britain, however, thunderstorms were beginning to offer a respite, and milder temperatures were forecast for Wednesday.\n\nBut it was a day of scorching milestones in Britain, where in the morning the thermometer in Surrey recorded a provisional reading of 39.1 degrees Celsius (102.4 degrees Fahrenheit), the highest level ever recorded in the United Kingdom. That record was broken about two hours later, when the Met Office, Britain’s national weather service, said the provisional temperature at Heathrow Airport hit 40.2 Celsius (104.4 Fahrenheit). If confirmed, it would be the first time that the temperature in Britain had exceeded 40 degrees Celsius.\n\nBy the afternoon, that marker was surpassed when Coningsby in eastern England recorded a temperature of 40.3. At least 34 sites exceeded the country’s previous record of 38.7 degrees, the Met Office said.\n\nIn France and Spain, firefighters have been battling wildfires that have gobbled up forest and brush and in some places, forced evacuations. On Tuesday, more than 2,000 firefighters were facing off against a blaze in the southwest that has forced 37,000 people from their homes this week.\n\nIn Britain, the government urged people to continue to work from home — a call that many heeded Tuesday — but for schools to stay open — a plea that some districts had ignored on Monday, sending students home.\n\nNetwork Rail, which operates the country’s rail system, issued a “do not travel” warning for trains that run through areas covered by a “red” warning issued by the Met Office. That covers a large section of the country, stretching from London north to Manchester and York. Several train companies said they planned to cancel all service running north from the capital.\n\nTrains are particularly affected by high heat because the infrastructure — rails and overhead wires — is not built to cope with extremely hot temperatures. Those that are still running are subject to speed restrictions. The London Underground, most of which does not have air conditioning, has also suspended some of its service.\n\nAmid all the sweltering, there was a promise of relief: Temperatures were forecast to plunge to the high 20s Celsius (low 80s Fahrenheit) by Wednesday.\n\nJuly 19, 2022, 5:40 p.m. ET\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe heat wave broke records in Britain and fueled dangerous wildfires in France and Spain, but other countries around Europe also dealt with scorching temperatures and sudden blazes on Tuesday, although forecasters in several countries expected the heat to wane in the coming days.\n\nIn Germany, the national weather forecaster issued a heat alert for much of the country, and said temperatures would climb again on Wednesday, with 38 degrees Celsius (about 100.4 Fahrenheit) predicted in Berlin and Hanover.\n\nIn Belgium, the Royal Meteorology Institute put several regions on its highest level of alert on Tuesday because of uncharacteristically strong heat, including the West Flanders and Hainaut provinces. But it also said that temperatures would return to normal over the coming week.\n\nIn the Netherlands, municipal workers in Amsterdam had to spray water on mechanical bridges that span the city’s canals to prevent the metal from expanding, which would jam the bridges and block boat traffic, The Associated Press reported. Still, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute said it expected the extreme heat to mostly dissipate by Wednesday.\n\nIn Greece, temperatures were not unusually high, but dry conditions and strong winds stoked dozens of wild fires across the country.\n\nThe largest blaze tore through the Mount Penteli area, northeast of Athens, on Tuesday evening, quickly eating through forest and threatening homes. Dozens of Greek firefighters and a contingent of Romanian counterparts battled the blaze, as authorities ordered thousands of residents were to evacuate from two settlements, Drafi and Anthousa.\n\nEvangelos Bournous, the mayor of the Rafina-Pikermi area where Drafi is located, told Skai radio that some homes had been burned, but there were no reports of any injuries.\n\nNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, Greece.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJuly 19, 2022, 4:58 p.m. ET\n\nMaham Javaid and\n\nIn Spain, the heat wave has lasted for more than a week, with more than 30 active wildfires burning tens of thousands of acres across the country.\n\nTypically, Spaniards escape to the north to beat the summer heat. But this week, the heat made its way north. Over the past seven days, the emergency services of the autonomous Basque region in northern Spain have responded to 184 heat-related emergencies and reported one heat-related death.\n\nOn Monday, Spain’s highest temperature of 43.3 degrees Celsius (110 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded in Navarre, another autonomous region in the north.\n\nMore than 30 active wildfires have also raged over the past day, with two blazes in the northwest causing particular concern. One fire, near the city of Zamora, has burned more than 40,000 acres. On Monday, a firefighter was reported killed while battling a blaze in the surrounding province, and the body of a shepherd was found in the same area, according to Spanish news media.\n\nThe Spanish Health Ministry has not released figures of deaths from heat-related causes, saying that toll can only be calculated after further investigation.\n\nThe heat and the fires have forced thousands to evacuate, but the temperatures have also affected transportation. Train services have been suspended on part of the high-speed line between Madrid and Ourense, in the west, because of a blaze burning close to the line, the authorities said.\n\nWhile temperatures are forecast to cool in Britain and other parts of Europe starting on Wednesday, the warm conditions may continue in Spain. According to AccuWeather, in Madrid, temperatures could rise from the 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) on Tuesday to 38.8 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) by Sunday.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nJuly 20, 2022\n\n:\n\nBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this post described incorrectly a temperature record in Spain. The temperature of 110 degrees Fahrenheit recorded on Monday in Navarre was Spain’s highest temperature that day, not its highest ever.\n\nHow we handle corrections\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJuly 19, 2022, 3:58 p.m. ET\n\nLONDON — As Londoners melted under the record-breaking temperatures in the city on Tuesday, many were looking for places to beat the heat. But there were few options.\n\nCooling centers are a common sight in the summer months in major cities in the United States and Canada, and increasingly are being found in some European cities, allowing residents to escape from hot high-rises or steamy sidewalks in mostly air-conditioned community spaces. But London still has none.\n\nParticularly in larger cities, where natural landscapes have been replaced with densely crowded buildings, concrete sidewalks, and limited green space, temperatures can often be several degrees hotter than the surrounding area as these surfaces absorb and retain heat.\n\nThe phenomenon, known as an Urban Heat Island, is a major concern in London, particularly as climate change brings more intense heat waves to Britain with more frequency.\n\nPenelope Endersby, the chief executive of Britain’s Meteorological Office, told BBC Radio 4 on Monday that “short-term changes for things like cooling centers” should be considered, along with longer-term steps, as extreme heat becomes more common.\n\nWhile the London mayor’s office has posted an interactive map that shows “cool spaces” across the city — a list of indoor and outdoor locations where Londoners can take respite on hot days — they aren’t an official city initiative. The spaces are suggested by boroughs and community groups, and include outdoor fountains, shady spaces in parks and indoor and outdoor recreation centers that have air conditioning or swimming pools.\n\nEngland’s heat wave plan, published by the government this month, does not mention cooling centers, although it provides a road map for a wide-ranging response at national and regional levels. The plan includes advice to individuals on how to stay safe and guidance on how to protect infrastructure.\n\nBut other nations in Europe have begun using cooling stations in urban areas in response to the current heat wave. In Paris, public parks remained open until midnight on Monday and Tuesday, schools and community centers have been repurposed as cooling stations and dozens of mist fountains have also been deployed under a heat response plan.\n\nThe measures were part of a broader national response to a devastating August 2003 heat wave that saw some 15,000 people die in France alone.\n\nJuly 19, 2022, 3:13 p.m. ET\n\nReporting from London\n\nFirefighters battled to save burning homes in parts of London as temperatures exceeded 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, Britain’s hottest day ever recorded, with the mayor of the capital city calling the situation “critical.”\n\nThe London Fire Brigade declared a “major incident,” allowing it to focus its resources. The fire service, which Mayor Sadiq Khan described as being “under immense pressure,” said in a statement that people should now only call if there was “an emergency or an immediate risk to life.”\n\nAerial footage played out on British news stations, showing the scale of the destruction. In the village of Wennington, in East London, videos showed fires spreading from nearby grassland to homes, many of which appeared to have been destroyed. One resident told BBC News: “The fire became an inferno incredibly quickly.”\n\nThe nearby Premier Inn Hotel had been hosting displaced residents of the village on Monday as they trickled in from outside, dazed and visibly shaken, but they were later moved to a local pub after the fire knocked out all power to the building, a staff member told The New York Times.\n\nIn Upminster, also in East London, around 200 firefighters and 30 fire engines battled to put out a huge grass fire that blew smoke over the M25 motorway, one of Britain’s busiest. Video that appeared to be from the scene showed panicked motorists racing past firefighters frantically battling flames burning just yards from passing cars.\n\nBy 3 p.m., at least 105 fire engines had been called out to at least 10 “significant fires” in London, according to the fire brigade. The force only has 143 fire engines available in total. A spokeswoman for the fire service said it had not confirmed any deaths or injuries in the blazes.\n\nThe fire brigade’s commissioner, Andy Roe, called for an urgent ban on the use of barbecues in public parks and open spaces. Despite warnings throughout the summer that grills could lead to fires, “people are continuing to behave carelessly and recklessly,” he said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJuly 19, 2022, 2:53 p.m. ET\n\nReporting from London\n\nLONDON — Amid Britain’s blistering heat wave, the unhoused across London have been left at risk, with homeless charities and shelters warning that the coronavirus pandemic and funding cuts have slashed support services and that many local authorities are woefully underprepared.\n\nAs forecasts rolled in last week, London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, activated the city’s Severe Weather Emergency Protocols, which are normally used only when temperatures plummet to freezing in the winter. The move was intended to prompt local authorities and charities to provide emergency accommodation to homeless people, often called “rough sleepers.”\n\n“Across the capital, we are taking action to assist those forced to sleep rough in these extremely high temperatures,” Mr. Khan’s office said in a statement.\n\nBut homeless charities have expressed concern that the protocols are not enforced by the government, and are only recommendations for local councils. That has left large disparities in homeless support services, charities say, with local authorities in some areas failing to act. This has left thousands of homeless people across the city without access to adequate shelters and services amid the heat wave.\n\n“What we really need is for this to be a mandatory thing,” said Matt Downie, chief executive at Crisis, a national homelessness charity. “For as long as it’s sort of voluntary, we’ll always have this postcode lottery.”\n\nMr. Downie repeated warnings that the heat wave could be life-threatening for homeless people, many of whom already suffer from pre-existing health conditions such as respiratory diseases that can be aggravated in extreme weather.\n\n“We’re really worried about this,” Mr. Downie said. “This isn’t messing around. People need to be found and they need to be helped. Otherwise really, really awful things will happen.”\n\nThe number of homeless people in London has more than doubled in the last decade, with more than 8,000 people seen sleeping rough between April 2021 and March 2022. During the pandemic, many homeless people were placed in hotel rooms, but those accommodations have all but ended.\n\nSheila Scott, who runs Shelter from the Storm, a 36-bed night shelter in northern London, said it had been operating 24 hours a day in recent days because of the heat wave, filling a void in homeless services in the city that she said had worsened due to the pandemic and funding cuts.\n\n“A lot of the services that were available to people experiencing homelessness are really just not there anymore,” said Mrs. Scott, who added that most emergency night shelters have closed down completely in recent years.\n\n“We are always full,” said Mrs. Scott, whose shelter is forced to turn away more than 30 people a week. “As soon as a bed becomes vacant we fill it with somebody who needs it immediately.”\n\nMatt Conlon, the general manager at the shelter, said many homeless people were arriving exhausted after being out in the street all day, often with little in the way of shade.\n\nPetra Salva, director of rough sleeping at St. Mungos, a national homelessness charity, said the heat wave was “a real wake-up call” about the need for emergency plans for summers as well as winters.\n\n“The system is broken,” Mrs. Salva said. “You can only put a plaster on the problem for so long.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJuly 19, 2022, 2:11 p.m. ET\n\nAfter a scorching hot day that saw the highest temperature ever recorded in Britain, forecasters predicted that evening thunderstorms on Tuesday would bring cooler winds and some respite from the heat.\n\nThe country made meteorological history several times over on Tuesday — first when the thermometer in Surrey recorded a provisional reading of 39.1 degrees Celsius (102.4 degrees Fahrenheit), breaking the previous record, and hours later when the provisional temperature at Heathrow Airport hit 40.2 Celsius (104.4 Fahrenheit). If confirmed, it would be the first time that the temperature in Britain had exceeded 40 degrees Celsius.\n\nTemperatures are expected to drop across Britain by midnight, according to the Met Office, the national weather service. It said that despite the relatively cooler temperatures, central, southern and eastern England will remain warm.\n\nRain that is on the forecast should help. The Met Office said that the far north of Scotland and northeastern England had already had some precipitation in the afternoon.\n\nDan DePodwin, director of forecasting operations for AccuWeather, a daily weather forecaster, said he expected a band of showers to start in southwestern Britain and move to the northeast Tuesday evening.\n\nIn the area around London, the rain could help bring down temperatures to 24 degrees Celsius (75.2 Fahrenheit) by 11 p.m., according to the Met Office. The office predicts that its red warning for extreme heat may mellow to an amber warning for London.\n\n“The good news is that it looks like we hit the peak today at 40 degrees Celsius, and now there is a cold front that is bringing in cooler temperatures,” said Mr. DePodwin. The minimum temperature predicted for tonight in London is 18 degrees Celsius (64.4 Fahrenheit), he said, which is significantly cooler than the last several nights in the London area.\n\nThat will help buildings that don’t have air-conditioning. “After prolonged extreme weather, heat really builds up in buildings without air-conditioning,” he said.\n\nTemperatures are expected to continue to moderate on Wednesday; Mr. DePodwin predicted highs of 25 to 30 degrees Celsius (77 to 86 Fahrenheit).\n\nJuly 19, 2022, 1:32 p.m. ET\n\nFor generations, homes in Britain were designed to retain heat, to make cold winters bearable.\n\nKeeping them cool in the typically mild summers was an afterthought, if it was a thought at all.\n\nBut in recent years, each new heat wave brings a fresh reminder that buying a fan or two simply won’t always cut it. There has been increasing interest among builders and designers, with some prodding from activists and the government, to ensure that new homes are built to limit overheating in the summer.\n\nNew regulations, called Part O, took effect in England in June, requiring that new homes are built with some measures to combat overheating. The regulations aim to reduce solar gain — the increase in room temperature caused by sunlight — ensuring the safety of occupants, even if it may remain uncomfortable.\n\nThe rules “will help designers, architects and engineers make more informed decisions so that the risk of overheating can be reduced in new properties,” said Mark Siddall, a principal at Low Energy Architectural Practice. Often, he said, rooms gain a lot of heat through large windows oriented in certain directions — the kind of design decision future homes may more fully consider.\n\nHistorically, designers in Britain haven’t worried too much about overheating, said Susie Diamond, a founder at Inkling LLP.\n\n“We haven’t needed to be protected from heat waves, so it hasn’t been a priority,” she said.\n\nBut with climate change making heat waves more common, and summers growing hotter, that’s no longer the case. Ms. Diamond said good design that accounts for overheating — including windows that open more widely and adding ceiling fans — can fix many of the issues without using air conditioning, which is rare in Britain and often seen as environmentally unfriendly and unnecessary for all but a few days per year.\n\nIn the past decade, the Climate Change Committee, an independent group that advises the British government, has called for stronger building regulations to combat overheating, along with a retrofitting program to address older homes. A June 2021 report called for better shading, reflective surfaces and green cover, warning that a failure to build new homes without accounting for overheating could “leave many existing and new homes uninhabitable as temperatures rise.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJuly 19, 2022, 1:03 p.m. ET\n\nLA TESTE-DE-BUCH, France — As firefighters battled raging wildfires for the eighth consecutive day in southwest France, scenes of devastation have emerged from the ashes.\n\nAt the famous Dune du Pilat, a sprawling white sand dune that is Europe’s tallest, five campsites were burned to the ground. All that was remained on Tuesday were charred buildings, bicycles and fridges. Authorities had evacuated the campsites a day earlier, displacing thousands of vacationers, as the smoke from one wildfire approached.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, regional authorities said that nearly 80 square miles of forests and bushes had been ravaged by a wildfire raging around Arcachon Bay and another farther to the southwest since the blazes began on July 12.\n\nA total of 37,000 people have been evacuated.\n\n“It’s an unprecedented situation,” said Grégory Allione, the president of France’s National Federation of Firefighters, adding that previous heat waves had never provoked such intense, simultaneous wildfires.\n\nAuthorities have turned to techniques rarely used in France, such as pre-emptively burning land to prevent the fire from advancing, or cutting down miles-long stretches of forest to create a natural barrier.\n\nOn Tuesday, dozens of fire trucks lined the side of a road that runs through the fire-ravaged area, ready to deploy. Bulldozers were at work chopping down trees, especially around the temporary headquarters of the firefighters.\n\n“We’re here for a long time to come,” Matthieu Jomain, a spokesman for the regional firefighter unit, said as wood smoldered behind him and a gray layer of ash covered the ground.\n\nThat’s all that was left at the foot of the Dune du Pilat: ash, along with a few signs of vacations abruptly cut short.\n\nBut at the Camping des Flots Bleus, a campsite that became the scene of a hit French comedy, charred bicycles were lined up near the entrance and flip-flops were still stored in a small closet.\n\nAt another campsite nearby, the concrete foundations were all that was left of most buildings. Charred tables and chairs sat on a terrace. A soda machine was still smoldering in the middle of what had most likely been a bar, with carbonized bottles of beer and wine stacked on shelves behind it.\n\nThe only thing that had truly survived the fire? The swimming pool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJuly 19, 2022, 12:36 p.m. ET\n\nLONDON — Britain’s record-breaking heat wave came against the backdrop of an intensely watched national political contest, as the race to succeed Prime Minister Boris Johnson was winnowed to just candidates ahead of a critical vote on Wednesday.\n\nRishi Sunak, the former chancellor of the Exchequer; Penny Mordaunt, a middle-ranking trade minister; and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, remain in the contest for the support of Conservative Party lawmakers who will on Wednesday narrow the field to two.\n\nThey will then battle for the votes of Conservative Party members, with the result of the leadership contest scheduled to be announced on Sept. 5. Under the British political system, the winner becomes prime minister because the Conservatives hold the biggest bloc of seats in Parliament.\n\nThe results of the latest ballot of Conservative lawmakers, held and announced in Parliament on Tuesday, put Mr. Sunak firmly in the lead with 118 votes, just short of the 120 he needs to secure his place in the shortlist of two on Wednesday.\n\nThe battle for second place remains wide open, with Ms. Mordaunt securing 92 votes — an increase of 10 after a similar vote on Monday — and Ms. Truss just behind with 86. Ms. Truss holds slightly more momentum, having won 15 more votes in the latest round.\n\nThe fourth-placed candidate on Tuesday, Kemi Badenoch, the former equalities and local government minister, was eliminated from the contest after a campaign that raised her profile. Supporters of Ms. Badenoch will probably decide the outcome of Wednesday’s contest, as the 59 votes she amassed on Tuesday are redistributed among the remaining contenders.\n\nIn theory, any of the three of the surviving candidates — Mr. Sunak, Ms. Mordaunt and Ms. Truss — could make it to the final two at the end of the least predictable contest of its type in recent memory.\n\nBecause the ballot is secret, some lawmakers have been rumored to have voted strategically, to try to eliminate candidates they dislike, rather than to promote their favored one. Other legislators may have been swayed by promises of future jobs by the candidates.\n\nAnd while Mr. Sunak has emerged as the clear front-runner to reach the final round, he would face an uphill battle there. According to one opinion poll, both Ms. Mordaunt and Ms. Truss are more popular than Mr. Sunak among Conservative Party members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"
