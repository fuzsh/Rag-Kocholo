The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases.\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nLeicester experiences some seasonal variation in the perceived humidity.\n\nThe muggier period of the year lasts for 3.2 months, from June 10 to September 18, during which time the comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable at least 7% of the time. The month with the most muggy days in Leicester is July, with 8.1 days that are muggy or worse.\n\nThe least muggy day of the year is February 23, when muggy conditions are essentially unheard of.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in Leicester\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in LeicestermuggyJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%Feb 230%Feb 230%Jul 2929%Jul 2929%Jun 107%Jun 107%Sep 187%Sep 187%muggymuggydrydrycomfortablecomfortableoppressiveoppressive\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Leicester experiences mild seasonal variation over the course of the year.\n\nThe windier part of the year lasts for 5.4 months, from November 15 to April 28, with average wind speeds of more than 5.0 miles per hour.

Those scores are combined into a single hourly composite score, which is then aggregated into days, averaged over all the years in the analysis period, and smoothed.\n\nOur cloud cover score is 10 for fully clear skies, falling linearly to 9 for mostly clear skies, and to 1 for fully overcast skies.\n\nOur precipitation score, which is based on the three-hour precipitation centered on the hour in question, is 10 for no precipitation, falling linearly to 9 for trace precipitation, and to 0 for 0.04 inches of precipitation or more.\n\nOur tourism temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 50Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 65Â°F, to 10 for 75Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 80Â°F, and to 1 for 90Â°F or hotter.\n\nOur beach/pool temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 65Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 75Â°F, to 10 for 82Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 90Â°F, and to 1 for 100Â°F or hotter.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Leicester typically lasts for 6.0 months (183 days), from around April 19 to around October 19, rarely starting before April 4 or after May 5, and rarely ending before October 2 or after November 6.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Leicester\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Leicestergrowing seasonJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%50%Apr 1950%Apr 1950%Oct 1950%Oct 1990%May 590%May 590%Oct 290%Oct 210%Apr 410%Apr 410%Nov 610%Nov 60%Feb 80%Feb 8Jul 19100%Jul 19100%NowNowfrigidfreezingvery coldcoldcoolcomfortablewarm\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature.

Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,053 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (3,123 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Leicester is covered by trees (86%), within 10 miles by trees (73%) and artificial surfaces (21%), and within 50 miles by trees (70%) and artificial surfaces (23%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Leicester, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 5 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Leicester.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Leicester according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Leicester is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Leicester and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nWorcester, Worcester Regional Airport (KORH, 92%, 2.5 mi, northeast, 36 ft elevation change)\n\nOrange Municipal Airport (KORE, 2.3%, 30 mi, northwest, -427 ft elevation change)\n\nNorth Central State Airport (KSFZ, 2.1%, 31 mi, southeast, -541 ft elevation change)\n\nWestover Air Reserve Base / Metropolitan Airport (KCEF, 1.9%, 32 mi, west, -741 ft elevation change)\n\nWindham Airport (KIJD, 1.5%, 38 mi, south, -735 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Leicester and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
