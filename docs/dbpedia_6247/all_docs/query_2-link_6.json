        "text": "Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Mostly dry with some sunny spells, although an isolated shower is possible over the Peak District. until later on Monday. Then, cloud and wind increasing with rain possible.\n\nUK Outlook for Tuesday 20 Aug 2024 to Thursday 29 Aug 2024: An unsettled start to the week with cloud and rain in many areas for a time, clearing to brighter conditions around midweek with showers in the northwest. The second half of next week is uncertain, influenced to some extent by the remnants of ex-Hurricane Ernesto. The most likely scenario is a period of unsettled weather, especially in the north and west with heavy rain and strong winds possible, while it may be warmer and less-wet towards the southeast. By the weekend and the following week, a mobile westerly regime is likely, most of the wet weather in the north and west, and longer drier interludes in the southeast. Temperatures overall will be close to average, but the chance of short-lived very warm conditions in the south and east at times.\n\nMountsorrel is a village in Leicestershire on the River Soar, just south of Loughborough with a population of 6,662 inhabitants. A castle was built in 1080 by Hugh Lupus, but there is evidence of an earlier Norman settlement in the area in the form of pottery fragments. A Roman villa is supposed to have existed on Broad Hill during the 4th century AD, the site of today's quarry, as quarrying during the late 1800s revealed many artefacts including a preserved wooden bucket. However, the first recording of the village was in 1377, when it had a population of 156.\n\nThe Mountsorrel Weather Station is located in Mountsorrel which is just South of Loughborough andjust North of Leicester, Leicestershire.\n\nThis website is non for profit and is freely maintained by Stormchaser Stuart Robinson whose passion is for all type of weather but especially the more severe types of weather such as Hurricanes, Typhoons and Tornadoes.\n\nStuart oftens travels the globle to experabce severe weather first after seeing his first tornado outside a town called Stuart in Nebraska, USA on the 9th June 2003."
