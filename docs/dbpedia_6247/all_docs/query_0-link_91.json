The district is covered by twenty-eight 1:10 000 series maps, or part-maps, each of which is given a geographical name for ease of reference. The codes for geological units shown on the map face are indicated in parenthesis where first introduced in the text.\n\nAll National Grid references are given in square brackets; all lie within the 100 km square SK.\n\nBorehole records referred to in the text are generally given a geographical name. Locations, terminal depths and BGS registered numbers are given in (Table 13).\n\nNumbers quoted in brackets in the plate captions refer to the BGS collection of photographs. Numbers preceded by the letter E refer to the BGS sliced rock collection.\n\nGeology of the Melton Mowbray district—summary\n\nThe bedrock of the Melton Mowbray district consists of Triassic and Jurassic strata, which are partially covered by Quaternary Superficial Deposits. Insets on the geological Sheet 142 Melton Mowbray show additional information on the concealed rocks, complemented by the results of seismic reflection profiling, and the geophysical (gravity and magnetic) properties of the geological ‘basement’.\n\nThe concealed geology of the district is described in much greater detail than before, because of the availability of information from coal and hydrocarbon exploration boreholes. These data show that the oldest proven rocks comprise late Ordovician granodiorites, representing intrusions into the lower Palaeozoic and/or Precambrian ‘basement’ of the area. They were partly unroofed by erosion later in the Palaeozoic, and are either faulted against or unconformably overlain by Carboniferous strata.\n\nThe concealed sedimentary sequence commences with Lower Carboniferous (Dinantian) strata deposited during a time of extension-induced subsidence of the East Midlands crust. Seismic investigations have shown that these strata attain 3500 m thickness in the southern part of a syn-Dinantian asymmetric rift structure, the Widmerpool Half graben (or ‘gulf’). The succeeding Namurian strata, comprising the prodelta facies Edale Shale Group and deltaic sandstones and mudstones of the Millstone Grit Group, were deposited when fault-induced subsidence had largely ceased. A wide delta plain had been established by Westphalian times, on which was accumulated the Coal Measures Group of the concealed Vale of Belvoir (Northeast Leicestershire) Coalfield. During deposition of the Lower Coal Measures, sediment transport paths were modified by the effusion of alkali olivine-basalt lavas and their associated volcaniclastic products in the east and south of the district. Later in the Westphalian, earth movements initiated a change to better drained, alluvial conditions reflected by the red beds of the Warwickshire Group, restricted to the east of the district.\n\nVariscan faulting and block uplift inverted the Coal Measures basin and ushered in a 50 million year period of erosion. By latest Permian times, however, aggradation had commenced, depositing a thin sedimentary veneer that includes the Cadeby and Edlington formations. The overlying basal Triassic strata are of fluviatile origin and constitute the regionally important aquifer of the Sherwood Sandstone Group. They are in turn succeeded by the Mercia Mudstone Group, deposited in arid, aeolian and playa lake environments, with locally thick gypsum seams that have been mined underground. Continental sedimentation was brought to a close by the marine transgression that deposited the Rhaetian-age mudstones and siltstones of the Penarth Group. Fully marine conditions were established at the start of the Lias Group, in latest Triassic to early Jurassic times, when the district lay within a relatively stable area known as the East Midlands Shelf. The Scunthorpe Mudstone and Charmouth Mudstone formations are shallow-water marine associations characterised by slow deposition and consequent reworking suggested by the phosphatisation of some ammonites and the boring of phosphate nodules. Intercalated bioclastic limestones are nevertheless indicative of periodic higher energy environments. The overlying Dyrham Formation contains more sandy or silty detritus, and it is capped by the ironstone-rich Marlstone Rock Formation deposited under high energy conditions during a marine regression. There was a return to relatively deeper marine environments during deposition of the Whitby Mudstone Formation, but further uplift brought a change to marginal-nonmarine conditions represented by the Middle Jurassic Northampton Sand Formation. A marine barrier bar-lagoonal complex was subsequently established, and peloidal limestones of the Lincolnshire Limestone Formation were deposited, the youngest bedrock unit of the district.\n\nThe oldest representatives of the Quaternary (Superficial Deposits) occur in the south of the district, as the sands and gravels of the preglacial Bytham River Basin, the course of which was partly coincident with that of the present-day Wreake valley. The Anglian glaciation that followed produced a reasonably coherent stratigraphy of deposits across the district. The principal varieties of lodgement till are a red, north-westerly derived till bearing Triassic and Carboniferous fragments, a grey till of eastern derivation with flint and chalk, and a till containing no flint or chalk but with abundant Jurassic limestone fragments. Interleaved with these deposits are layers or lenses of glaciofluvial sand and gravel, and glaciolacustrine clay. Sustained uplift through the later part of the Anglian stage, and into the Flandrian, resulted in at least five generations of river terrace deposits in the trunk valleys of the Soar and Wreake rivers. These deposits constitute an aggregate resource and are also local suppliers of water in the district. The Quaternary evolution of ‘clay vales’, such as the Vale of Belvoir and the Stapleford vale south-east of Melton Mowbray, was dominated by successive episodes of periglacial slope wasting. The resultant landforms are plano-concave solifluction terraces, underlain by head deposits that are collectively termed ‘Slope Terrace Deposits’ on the map. Features related to modern slope instability are extensive tracts of landslipped ground along the (mostly) north-facing escarpments developed mainly on Jurassic mudstone. Of the younger Quaternary deposits, colluvium, head and floodplain alluvium are locally extensive and there are small occurrences of blown sand, shell marl and lacustrine deposits.\n\nCurrent mineral production comes from deposits of glaciofluvial and river terrace sand and gravel, and the underground mining of gypsum from adits at Barrow upon Soar. Coal was formerly mined from Cotgrave and Asfordby and large deposits remain unexploited. Oil is currently being produced from wells at Rempstone and Long Clawson. The concealed Carboniferous succession is locally very thick and the district continues to present favourable targets for hydrocarbon exploration.\n\n(Table 1) Summary of the geological succession of the Melton Mowbray district. Thickness range shown in brackets.\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nThe district lies mainly within the Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Rutland administrative areas, but its extreme north-eastern corner also includes a small part of Lincolnshire. Melton Mowbray is the main town, and there are smaller population centres at Keyworth, Barrow upon Soar, Ruddington and Clifton. Outside of these, the land is given over to arable and livestock farming, the latter particularly important on the flood-prone valley floors of the rivers Soar and Wreake (Figure 1), (Figure 2).\n\nAbout 450 million years of geological history are represented, by the rocks that form the succession summarised in (Table 1). The distribution of the outcropping rock sequences is indicated in (Figure 1), which also highlights those units of particular economic or environmental significance. These include, for example, the Cropwell Bishop Formation, which locally contains thick gypsum beds, and the Barnstone Member and Marlstone Rock Formation which have been mined at the surface and at shallow depths.\n\nThe oldest elements of the concealed geology, proved by drilling, are the Rempstone Granodiorite and the Melton Mowbray Granodiorite, both of Ordovician age. These rocks are the sources of coincident aeromagnetic anomaly ‘highs’ representing extensive intrusions into the Precambrian and Early Palaeozoic basement of the district. These basement rocks are unconformably overlain by Lower Carboniferous (Dinantian) strata, which were deposited on shelf areas and intervening deep basins, the latter represented by the Widmerpool Half-graben, a major asymmetric rift structure. The oldest proven component of the rift-fill consists of clastic sedimentary rocks of the Scalford Sandstone Formation. On the shelf, carbonate ramp facies are represented by the Milldale Limestone Formation, Belvoir Limestone Formation and Plungar Limestone Formation, whereas the Widmerpool Formation is of basinal turbidite facies. The Dinantian syn-rift sequence as a whole is of considerable economic importance since it provided a source for much of the oil that is currently being extracted from the Rempstone-1 and Long Clawson-2 wells. The overlying Namurian strata, of the Edale Shale Group and Millstone Grit Group, filled the remaining accommodation space in the Widmerpool Half graben; they provide both the cap-rocks and reservoirs to many oil showings in the East Midlands hydrocarbon province. By Westphalian times the Coal Measures Group was being accumulated within a gently subsiding delta plain that occupied virtually the whole of the Pennine Basin. The seams of the Vale of Belvoir Coalfield constitute a large potential resource. Sedimentation in the Lower Coal Measures was interrupted by alkali-olivine basalt magmatism, represented by intrusive peperites of the Asfordby Volcanic Formation, and by the Saltby Volcanic Formation, the latter an extrusive association supplied from centres to the east of the district. This activity had largely ceased by earliest Middle Coal Measures times, although the latter strata and the Upper Coal Measures both show an eastward attenuation across the buried volcanic pile. Local tectonism and uplift produced a major environmental change, to the accumulation of the Warwickshire Group red beds, which are largely barren of coal seams.\n\nVariscan uplift inverted the coal basin, exposing the strata to erosion that spanned most of the Permian period. Sedimentation was resumed in latest Permian times with the deposition of calcareous sandstones of the Cadeby Formation and mudstones in the Edlington Formation. The Triassic period commenced with a major fluvial episode, depositing strata of the Sherwood Sandstone Group.\n\nRed, argillaceous, continental-facies strata of the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group form the oldest part of the outcropping geological sequence. They are restricted to the western part of the district, where they include the Cropwell Bishop Formation, a unit that has been locally exploited for its thick seams of gypsum, and the distinctive grey to green dolomitic mudstones of the Blue Anchor Formation. The overlying strata of the Penarth Group, of Rhaetian age, mark the onset of the marine sedimentation that persisted throughout the rest of the bedrock sequence. The landscape developed on the Mercia Mudstone Group is subdued; the principal feature is a dissected escarpment that contains the Blue Anchor Formation overlain by the Penarth and Lias groups.\n\nThe Jurassic strata of the Lias Group mark the advent of fully marine conditions, following a major transgression. The strata dip gently to the south-east to produce a cuesta topography, rising to a maximum elevation of about 150 m in the east. Prominent dip-slopes are developed on relatively resistant limestones of the Barnstone Member, basal to the Scunthorpe Mudstone Formation of the Lias Group. Stratigraphically higher units of the Scunthorpe Mudstone crop out in the Vale of Belvoir, where numerous thin limestones and subordinate sandstones have been eroded differentially to produce a series of small scarps and broad dip slopes seen between Upper Broughton and Barkestone-le-Vale. Similar topography is developed in the lower beds of the overlying Charmouth Mudstone Formation, up to the foot of a prominent escarpment that rises steeply above the Vale of Belvoir and where the transition to siltstone of the Dyrham Formation occurs. The escarpment is capped by a dissected plateau developed on resistant strata of the Marlstone Rock Formation; this was deposited during a sea-level low-stand, and has been extensively worked as a source of iron ore. A more subdued escarpment feature leads up to the higher ground, in the east of the district, between Branston and Croxton. Its lower slopes consist of marine mudstone of the Whitby Mudstone Formation, the youngest division of the Lias Group. It is capped by the Inferior Oolite Group. At the base, the Northampton Sand Formation, which was deposited in nearshore high-energy conditions, is a resistant lithology that gives rise to long, gently cambered dip slopes. Above these slopes a smaller escarpment is formed by marginal marine or estuarine facies strata of the Grantham Formation. In turn, this is capped by the stratigraphically highest bedrock unit of the district, the Lincolnshire Limestone Formation, which forms a characteristic dissected plateau.\n\nQuaternary Deposits (Drift or Superficial Deposits) are widely distributed and locally very thickly developed in the district. Pre-Anglian deposits of the Bytham Sands and Gravels are more restricted, lying within the largely drift covered trunk valley and tributaries of the preglacial Bytham River, in the south of the district. The overlying glacigenic deposits were laid down during the Anglian glaciation about 440 000 years ago. The lodgement tills of this event comprise the Thrussington Till, which is red in colour and rich in Triassic debris, and the Oadby Till, brown to grey and with chalk and flint debris but also including a Lias-rich facies that is largely devoid of flint and chalk. Outwash or melt-water sands and gravels of these tills comprise glaciofluvial deposits, whereas clays and silts of glaciolacustrine origin mainly represent the ponding of subglacial or proglacial drainage. The drift deposits are most thickly represented in the relict palaeovalley of the Bytham River, where they form a local stratigraphy in which Thrussington Till is overlain by the glaciolacustrine Rotherby Clay, and by a glaciofluvial phase represented by the Wigston Sand and Gravel; the latter is capped by Oadby Till.\n\nExtensive Quaternary deposits underlie the floodplains of the modern Soar and Wreake rivers. They consist of modern alluvium, and remnants of earlier floodplain levels represented by the river terrace deposits, of which there are five separate generations. These are locally thick and constitute a major resource of sand and gravel in the district.\n\nQuaternary slope deposits, of largely periglacial origin, are developed in all parts of the area, but form particularly well-differentiated sequences in ‘clay vales’, such as the Vale of Belvoir and the Stapleford vale south-east of Melton Mowbray. The Pen Hill, Langar and Harby head deposits of the former, and the equivalent Burton Lazars Head in the Stapleford vale, date back to the ‘Wolstonian’ stage. Younger deposits of Flandrian age, which includes head and colluvium, are widespread and landslips are common on the steeper escarpment slopes.\n\nHistory of survey and research\n\nThe district was originally surveyed on the 1:63 360 scale by H Howell, E Hull, J W Judd, W H Holloway and A J Jukes-Browne and published on [old series] sheets 63, 64, 70 and 71 in 1855–79. The primary survey at the 1:10 560 scale, by C Fox-Strangways, W Gibson, C B Wedd, R L Sherlock, B Smith and G W Lamplugh was published as a Solid and Drift edition in 1909. The memoir (Lamplugh et al., 1909) contains much lithological and palaeontological detail. The Marlstone Rock Formation was remapped in 1939 by D A Wray, and the Northampton Sand Formation in 1941 by F B A Welch. Details of these formations was included in a new memoir (Whitehead et al., 1952). Further amendments by V Wilson were incorporated into a 1959 edition of the Melton Mowbray geological sheet. The Generalized Vertical Section, and horizontal section were updated in the 1969 edition of the map, which incorporated much new detail on Carboniferous subsurface geology.\n\nThe resurvey of the district commenced in 1987–88, with 1:10 000 series map-sheets for the north-western margin completed by T J Charsley, R G Crofts, A S Howard and D J Lowe. The remaining sheets were completed between 1996 and 1999 by the survey staff (Table 12). This final phase involved researchers from a wide range of geological disciplines both within and outside the BGS. Some of this work was still on-going at the time of writing, but much is also reviewed in the pages that follow.\n\nChapter 2 Ordovician — Rempstone and Melton Mowbray granodiorites\n\nThese granodiorites are the only basement rocks to have been proved in the Melton Mowbray district; their descriptions are based on a few samples retained on completion of drilling. The granodiorites intrude a basement sequence that is, in part, represented by the tuffs and mudstones of probable Early Palaeozoic age proved in the Sproxton No. 1 Borehole [SK 8451 2394], located 1.4 km beyond the eastern margin of the district. T C Pharaoh (in Berridge et al., 1999, p.17–21) summarises other provings of the sub-Carboniferous basement close to this district.\n\nClues to the age of the Rempstone and Melton Mowbray granodiorites are provided by chemical data, discussed below, indicating that they are part of the same magmatic event that formed the Mountsorrel Complex. Zircons extracted from the exposed rocks of the Mountsorrel Complex, and dated by the U-Pb method, suggest an Ordovician (Caradoc) age of 451–452 Ma. This value was derived by Noble et al. (1993), who recalculated the data obtained by Pidgeon and Aftalion (1978) by merging it with values obtained from the nearby intrusive rocks of the South Leicestershire Diorites Suite. The former authors urge caution, however, in that the Mountsorrel age was obtained on zircons that were abraded and are significantly discordant. The age nevertheless falls within the spectrum of values between 449 ± 13 and 457 ± 20 Ma obtained from tuffs and plutonic rocks proved by drilling elsewhere in the basement of eastern England (Noble et al., 1993). This activity was thus broadly contemporaneous with the Ordovician volcanism of the Lake District and Snowdonia.\n\nThe comparative geochemistry of samples from the Rempstone (2 analysed samples) and Melton Mowbray (2 samples) granodiorite provings, and from exposures in the Mountsorrel Complex, which crops out 500 m to the southwest of the district, is discussed by Pharaoh et al. (1993). All plots lie along a single trend of magmatic variation, as also recognised by Le Bas (1972), indicating descent from common parental magma-types. Their compositions show no iron enrichment, moderate enrichment of large ion lithophile (LIL) elements (K, Rb and Ba), Th and Ce, and relative depletion of Nb (and Ta), which are patterns typical of calc-alkaline volcanic arc magmatism. Pharaoh et al. (1993) considered that the magmas were generated by the southwards-directed subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath central England from the Tornquist Sea, or part of the Iapetus Ocean.\n\nRempstone Granodiorite (ReGd)\n\nThis unit was proved between 1131.2 m and terminal depth (1213.0 m) in the Rempstone LN/10-1 Borehole. The granodiorite contact with overlying Millstone Grit strata was not preserved intact; however, interpretations of nearby seismic reflection profiles suggest it is tectonic, and that the borehole has intersected granodiorite forming the local footwall to the Normanton Hills Fault (information from T C Pharaoh; see also Section 2 on Sheet 142 Melton Mowbray). The subsurface extent of the Rempstone Granodiorite is defined by a triangular-shaped aeromagnetic anomaly (see inset on Sheet 142 Melton Mowbray), which shows a body of between 6 and 8 km diameter. Its linear, west-north-west-orientated margin is controlled by the Normanton Hills Fault, which as noted is intersected in the Rempstone LN/10-1 Borehole. The south-eastern margin of the Rempstone Granodiorite is also linear, and appears to be controlled by a north-east trending structure. Geophysical modelling (Chapter 9) suggests that the top of the granodiorite is close to the surface and probably forms much of the sub-Carboniferous basement to the south of the fault. The intrusion may be linked at depth to the Mountsorrel Complex, which also gives rise to a circular magnetic anomaly to the south of the district (Chapter 9).\n\nThe two surviving core samples, from depths of 1202.2 and 1202.3 m in the borehole, show that the Rempstone Granodiorite is a coarse-grained rock with an inequigranular texture. Cream to green, prismatic plagioclase crystals, up to 5 mm across, are set in a pink, medium to fine grained quartzo-feldspathic base in which grey to black, granular mafic mineral aggregates between 2 and 4 mm across are commonly developed. A xenolithic component consists of pale grey, medium to fine-grained diorite fragments that range from 10 mm up to at least 40 mm in size; they contain sporadic plagioclase phenocrysts of similar appearance to those in the main part of the granodiorite.\n\nA thin section (E60513) from 1202.2 m depth shows plagioclase feldspar euhedra, up to 3 mm long, which are largely replaced by granular clusters of epidote and white mica. Between the feldspars are medium-grained, hypidiomorpic-granular aggregates of plagioclase prisms and chlorite laths, the latter pseudomorphic after amphibole (and possibly also after biotite); interstitial intergrowths of quartz and turbid K-feldspar locally form granophyrictextured patches up to 3–4 mm across. A further thin section (E60514), from 1202.5 m depth, shows a quartzdiorite xenolith consisting of tightly packed plagioclase laths, much interstitial secondary chlorite, and interspersed granular quartzo-feldspathic pools. The coarse-grained granodiorite that encloses the xenoliths is similar to that described for (E60513), but shows a more accentuated development of the granophyric texture; there are no obvious signs of chilling between xenolith and host rock.\n\nMelton Mowbray Granodiorite\n\nThis intrusion was intersected in the Kirby Lane Borehole, from 402 m to the terminal depth at 413.9 m. The borehole description mentions that the upper 8 m of intrusive rocks are weathered, with their topmost part being ‘greenish-grey speckled with soft-white kaolinitised feldspar and red and green grains’. Weathering of the intrusion is further indicated by the geophysical borehole log, reproduced in Brandon (1999, fig. 3), showing increased gamma-ray values compatible with the conversion of igneous rock to secondary clay minerals in the top 3 m of the intrusion.\n\nCore samples from the borehole show coarsely inequigranular granodiorite with prominent pink feldspar prisms up to 5 mm across. One specimen is net-veined, with angular inclusions of grey, mafic-rich granodiorite or quartz-diorite separated by narrow septa of pink aplogranite (Plate 1). In the same sample, scattered xenoliths of grey, fine-grained diorite, are possibly the remnants of an earlier phase of basic intrusion.\n\nThe weathered surface of the intrusion is unconformably overlain by strata of the Millstone Grit Group, at a level equated by Brandon (1999) with the Marsdenian stage of the Namurian. The overlying sandstone bed, 0.34 m thick, is described as being ‘gritty’ with a soft white matrix, and it probably contains detritus reworked from the weathered top of the intrusion. The aeromagnetic anomaly map on Sheet 142 shows that the Melton Mowbray Granodiorite occupies a north-east-orientated body, just over 16 km long by about 7 km wide. Its north-western margin is linear, and in part controlled by the Sileby Fault (Chapter 9).\n\nChapter 3 Carboniferous\n\nUplift and erosion of the early Palaeozoic basement rocks produced a landscape that was eventually inundated by the marine transgression that occurred in latest Devonian or early Carboniferous (Tournaisian) times (about 355 Ma). In this district the Carboniferous strata are recognised in boreholes, but have also been imaged on many seismic reflection profiles, which form the basis for their classification in terms of seismostratigraphical sequences (e.g. Ebdon et al., 1990; see also, Chapter 8). The oldest sequences, of early Carboniferous (Dinantian) age, accumulated in a syn-rift tectonic environment, but by late Carboniferous times this tectonic regime had evolved into one of more uniform, regional-scale subsidence (post-rift thermal sag). Thus, during the Namurian, deltas encroached upon large areas of the Midlands, and ultimately, in Westphalian times, a fluvio-lacustrine delta-plain was established. The effusion of basaltic lavas and associated volcaniclastic rocks in the late Dinantian and latest Namurian to early Westphalian (Langsettian) periods was an expression of localised tectonic instability in parts of the Melton Mowbray and adjacent districts.\n\nDinantian\n\nDinantian strata were deposited within a tilted block and graben topography (e.g. Miller and Grayson, 1982), and are of widely varying lithofacies. They are part of the ‘syn-rift megasequence’ of Fraser and Gawthorpe (1990), the evolution of which is mainly interpreted from seismic data, as discussed in Chapter 8. In this district Dinantian rocks have also been proved in several deep boreholes, which have helped to constrain the correlations embodied in the seismic depth sections shown on Sheet 142. Such interpretations show that the Dinantian attains a maximum thickness of about 3500 m in the deeper, southern part of the asymmetric Widmerpool Half-graben.\n\nThe lithological and thickness variations that characterise the Dinantian succession can be related to deposition within fault or flexure-bound structural domains (Chapter 8). These comprise (Figure 4), (Figure 7), (Figure 8) and (Figure 11) are also indicated. b.

In addition, volcanic rocks of late Dinantian (Brigantian) age were extruded from several centres along the Cinderhill–Foss Bridge Fault line to the north of this district (Fraser et al., 1990; Howard et al (a), in prep.).\n\nThe five major divisions of Dinantian rocks recognised in the district are termed the Scalford Sandstone, Milldale Limestone, Belvoir Limestone, Plungar Limestone and Widmerpool formations. The Milldale, Belvoir and Plungar Limestone formations broadly equate to the ‘Carboniferous Limestone’, a term that has traditionally been used for Dinantian carbonate rocks that collectively form a unit of supergroup lithostratigraphical rank. ‘Carboniferous Limestone’ is not a formal unit, however, and this terminology is not recommended for current use (Aitkenhead and Chisholm, 1982). Lithostratigraphical revisions currently in progress (Waters et al., in prep.), but at the time of writing not yet finalised, suggest that the limestone-dominated Dinantian formations of shelfal or platform facies should all be included within a division of their own (the Peak Limestone Group). On the other hand, basinal-facies, mudstone-rich sequences, such as the Widmerpool Formation of this district, but also including Namurian strata presently referred to as the Edale Shale Group, would be placed within a separate ‘Craven Group’.\n\nThe borehole correlations of (Figure 4) show that the Widmerpool Formation attenuates, and the Dinantian as a whole displays increasing degrees of unconformity with the overlying Namurian as the floor of the Widmerpool Half graben becomes shallower to the north-east of the district. Attenuation is more abrupt in the south, across the Sileby Fault, as seen in the Kirby Lane Borehole where Dinantian strata are absent (Figure 7). These relationships are also shown by the depth sections (2 and 3) on Sheet 142.\n\nScalford Sandstone Formation (SfdS)\n\nAt least 123.7 m of siliciclastic strata were uniquely proved in the Scalford No. 1 Borehole, although the lithologies are only poorly documented from cuttings samples. The succession consists mainly of reddish brown, brown or green, fine to medium-grained calcareous sandstone, brown, red and purple, blocky to fissile siltstone, and grey, blocky mudstone. The beds are unfossiliferous, and consequently of uncertain age, but are ‘overlain’ by strata correlated with the Widmerpool Formation (Ambrose, 2000a). The thickness of the Widmerpool Formation, only 68 m, is considerably less than would be predicted by seismic profiling in this part of the Widmerpool Half-graben. Its apparent attenuation may suggest tectonic omission in this borehole, possibly because its junction with the Scalford Sandstone is a shear zone representing the footwall cut-out of the Normanton Hills Fault (information from T C Pharaoh; compare (Figure 4), (Figure 7), (Figure 8) and (Figure 11) are also indicated. b. Principal early Carboniferous tectonic features of the region, with outline of the Melton Mowbray district (modified from Berridge et al., 1999).\" data-name=\"images/P946215.jpg\">(Figure 3)a and (Figure 7)). The Scalford Sandstone could therefore be a basal Dinantian or even latest Devonian sequence deposited on the Hathern Shelf, in an analagous structural position to the Calke Abbey Sandstone Formation of the Loughborough district (Carney et al., 2001). It may represent an early syn-rift fluviatile or fan-delta association, containing material derived from young escarpments formed by the initiation of rifting along the Normanton Hills or Sileby faults.\n\nMilldale Limestone Formation (Mi)\n\nStrata correlated with the Milldale Limestone Formation (Parkinson, 1949; Aitkenhead and Chisholm, 1982) were encountered only in the north of the district, and are at least 168 m thick in the Plungar 8A Borehole; where no base to the succession was proved. The top of the unit is a probable unconformity surface, which in turn is overlain by the Belvoir Limestone Formation (see below).\n\nThe evidence of borehole cuttings suggests that the basal 50 m of the formation in Plungar 8A Borehole consists of silty, buff to grey, dolomitic limestone and dolostone interbedded with dolomitic siltstone, the latter commonly oil-stained. Above this are grey, buff or brown, ‘crystalline’ dolomitic limestones with sporadic productid fossils.\n\nThe age and correlation of this unit is based on biostratigraphical investigations of cuttings samples from the Plungar 8A Borehole. The initial report, by A R E Strank (1980; unpublished borehole log report), was superseded by that of Riley (1992), who found that the most age-diagnostic material (foraminifera and algae) came from strata between 1394.5 and 1269.5 m depth. The age proposed for this interval was either early Chadian or late Courceyan (Cf4a1 Subzone). This facies, with its abundant cyanobacteria and the calcareous alga Parachaetetes, was considered typical of the carbonate ramp lithologies developed in the lower part of the Milldale Limestones found in the continuation of the Widmerpool Half-graben in the Ashbourne district, about 40 km to the north-west. The overlying strata, between 1269.5 and 1149 m depth in the borehole, were barren of fauna, but from regional considerations it was suspected that this interval contains the top of the Milldale Limestone Formation. In other parts of the East Midlands, that surface is an unconformity or nonsequence between the early and late Chadian, and it also contains the Tournaisian–Visean boundary. Here, this unconformity is taken arbitrarily to lie at 1240 to 1250 m depth in the Plungar 8A Borehole. The overlying c. 120 m of Belvoir Limestone Formation in the Plungar 8A Borehole could therefore be of late Chadian age.\n\nIn the Ashbourne district, strata of the Milldale Limestone Formation were deposited in a carbonate ramp setting (Chisholm et al., 1988), with respect to the basinal province represented by the Widmerpool Half-graben (Ebdon et al., 1990; fig. 3).\n\nBelvoir Limestone Formation (Bvr)\n\nThese brown to white, dolomitic, locally ooidal limestones occupy an interval about 120 m thick above the inferred early/late Chadian unconformity, discussed earlier to be at about 1240 to 1250 m depth in the Plungar 8A Borehole. Within 55 m of the top of the unit, two thin volcanic beds of ‘green ash’ are recorded. The Belvoir Limestone strata are likely to be of late Chadian age in their topmost part, since samples from above 1149 m yielded bilaminar Koninckopora, with no archaediscids present (Riley, 1992). No age-diagnostic fossils were recovered from the critical lower part of this succession, between 1269 and 1149 m depth. Although Riley (1992) inferred an unconformity at the top of the Milldale Limestone within this interval, there is no particularly obvious feature on the gamma-ray log (Figure 4) that would indicate its position.\n\nAt the top of the Belvoir Limestone Formation, Riley (1992) inferred a further unconformity or non-sequence, with overlying strata of possible late Arundian age. The latter are now referred to the Plungar Limestone Formation, and as the position of the base-late Arundian unconformity cannot be determined on faunal grounds, it is here taken as the base of the lowest sandstone bed, at 1130 m depth (Figure 4). The poor biostratigraphical definition of the hiatus could be due to the reworking of earlier faunal elements derived by erosion, although the nature of the material, from borehole cuttings, does militate against good faunal resolution.\n\nPlungar Limestone Formation (PlLs)\n\nThis formation is named after its main proving in the Plungar 8A Borehole where it is a limestone-dominated sequence, 198 m thick, and bounded by unconformities that separate it from the (possibly late Chadian) Belvoir Limestone Formation below, and the Millstone Grit Group above.\n\nThe unconformable base of the formation on the early Chadian Belvoir Limestone Formation described above, is taken at the base of a 6 m-thick bed of grey, pebbly sandstone recorded at 1131 m depth in the borehole. The part of the formation immediately overlying this unconformity includes dolomitic limestones with two thinner sandstones in a 15 m thickness of strata. The lithological log of the borehole describes white to buff, crystalline limestones, ooidal in places, above the youngest sandstone.\n\nThe upper junction is an unconformity (Figure 4) that forms a surface across which at least some of the Brigantian, and all of the Pendleianand Arnsbergian-age strata, pinch out toward the north-east. The hiatus probably occurred during a late Brigantian episode of mild basin inversion that was documented by Ebdon et al. (1990; fig. 9) for the north-eastern margin of the Widmerpool Half-graben. The formation is interpreted as a carbonate ramp or platform lithological association. It may be represented by other limestone provings beneath the Namurian in the north-east of the district, as shown in (Figure 4) and discussed in the next section, but there is insufficient biostratigraphical information to confirm the correlations.\n\nAge and correlation\n\nRiley (1992) noted that faunal remains are sparse for this unit, with a Late Arundian age regarded as tentative. This conflicts with the macrofauna obtained from 140 m below the top of the unit in the adjacent Plungar No. 8 Borehole, which includes Gigantoproductus, indicative of a D1 (Asbian) age, possibly younging upwards into the Brigantian.\n\nUndivided Dinantian limestones\n\nMany hydrocarbon exploration boreholes were stopped only a few tens of metres into the Dinantian. Comparisons of the gamma-ray traces in (Figure 4) nevertheless suggest that beds corresponding to the Plungar Limestone Formation probably underlie the Millstone Grit across the north-east of the district. The deeper borehole sections show sufficient lithological variation to suggest that different parts of the formation may have been encountered. For example, in the Plungar No. 4 Borehole, 72 m of ‘cream-white limestone’ was described, whereas in the Barkestone No. 1 Borehole, about 2.5 km to the north-east, the lower part of a 61 m thickness of Dinantian beds consisted of ‘black shale and limestone’ intercalations. In this borehole, fossils yielded from a datum 5.2 m below the Millstone Grit included Productus cf. Davidsonaria septosa (Phillips), suggesting an Asbian age. The Redmile No. 1 Borehole proved pale grey-brown (oil-stained) limestone with crinoids and foraminifera; the sporadic grey-green mudstone partings were locally carbonaceous and pyritous.\n\nWidmerpool Formation (WdF)\n\nThe Widmerpool Formation (Aitkenhead, 1977) represents a late Dinantian (Asbian to Brigantian) syn-rift to post-rift sedimentary sequence deposited during a general collapse of the platforms bordering the Widmerpool Half-graben. Sedimentation involved periodic carbonate gravity-flows and turbidity flows into a hemipelagic environment. A single subdivision, the Ratcliffe Volcanic Member, has been recognised. The top of the formation, and of the Dinantian, is taken at the base of the Cravenoceras leion Marine Band or, where this is not proved on faunal grounds, the corresponding feature on geophysical borehole logs. The formation was apparently bottomed in the Scalford No. 1 Borehole (Ambrose, 2000a) in the south-east of the district, but here, as previously discussed, the unit may be in faulted contact with the Scalford Sandstone Formation. Interpretations of seismic data (insets on Sheet 142 Melton Mowbray) suggest up to 1000 m thickness of the Widmerpool Formation in the south-west of the Widmerpool Half-graben, where maximum synsedimentary subsidence occurred. To the north, borehole correlations (Figure 4) show that the formation attenuates before pinching out across the Cinderhill–Foss Bridge Flexure, which delineates that margin of the graben (Figure 4), (Figure 7), (Figure 8) and (Figure 11) are also indicated. b. Principal early Carboniferous tectonic features of the region, with outline of the Melton Mowbray district (modified from Berridge et al., 1999).\" data-name=\"images/P946215.jpg\">(Figure 3)a.\n\nThe Widmerpool No. 1 Borehole, located in the central part of the Widmerpool Half-graben, proved a 480 m minimum thickness of the formation. The records are poor but suggest a sequence dominated by dark grey mudstone with interbedded thin limestones. The latter are sandy to gritty or conglomeratic, with shell detritus and quartz pebbles. In the lower 60 m of this borehole the fauna included the ammonoids Nomismoceras cf. germanicum, Beyrichoceras, ?Girtyoceras, Goniatites cf. crenistia, the conodont Hindeodella, and the marine bivalve Dunbarella. The occurrence of Beyrichoceras, if confirmed, would indicate a position within the Beyrichoceras (B) zone of Riley (1990), and therefore a probable late Asbian age. In the overlying 200 m of strata, the absence of Beyrichoceras and occurrence of Arnsbergites aff. sphaerico-striatus and the bivalve Posidonia becheri Brown suggest a position within the P1b-d subzones in the Brigantian. In the upper 220 m or so of beds, core preservation was too fragmentary for accurate age determinations on the basis of macrofaunas. The Cravenoceras leion Biozone, delimiting the top of the Widmerpool Formation, was identified in the Widmerpool No. 1 Borehole and at the base of the Colston Bassett North Borehole (Figure 4).\n\nIn the southern part of the Widmerpool Half-graben, the most extensive proving of the formation is the 330 m minimum thickness of carbonaceous, silty mudstones and interbedded bioclastic limestone turbidites encountered in the Rempstone LN/10-1 oil-producing borehole (Carney, 1999). Farther east, in the Old Dalby Borehole, sidewall cores and chipping samples indicate that the formation includes beds of grey-brown packstone with shell fragments, together with buff, dolomitic sandstone with oil shows.\n\nIn the north-east of the Widmerpool Half-graben, the Long Clawson No. 2 Borehole encountered at least 175 m of the Widmerpool Formation, below a zone of high gamma-ray values identified as the Cravenoceras leion Marine Band. The lithologies consist of mudstones intercalated with thin, quartzose to subarkosic sandstones and grey, argillaceous limestones. Thicker sandstones (up to 2–3 m), with graded siltstone and sandstone couplets, are intercalated about 50 m below the top of the formation. Beds of white to pale brown limestone and shelly limestone become numerous about 80 m lower down and limestone dominates in the lowest part of the proving, suggesting a downwards transition to the ‘Carboniferous Limestone’ Dinantian facies (Figure 4).\n\nRatcliffe Volcanic Member (RaV)\n\nThin beds of green-grey basic tuff appear between 100 and 135 m from the top of the Widmerpool Formation in the various boreholes described above (Figure 4). They are correlated with the beds named from the Ratcliffe Borehole [SK 5081 2913] of the adjacent Loughborough district (Carney et al., 2001). The tuffaceous beds in the Widmerpool No. 1 Borehole appear 60 m above the Arnsbergites aff. sphaericostriatus (P1c) occurrence. The member is thus probably equivalent to tuffaceous strata occupying part of the P2 zone in the cored Duffield Borehole (Aitkenhead, 1977), in the Derby district, and to the Tissington Volcanic Member of the Ashbourne district. The latter comprises a diverse basaltic sequence interleaved with strata containing ammonoids dated at between P1c and early P2 age, probably within the P1d Zone (Chisholm et al., 1988, p.33). The member may also represent a partial lateral equivalent of the basaltic volcanic rocks that replace seismostratigraphical units EC4–EC6 (mid Asbian to mid-Brigantian age) along the continuation of the Cinderhill–Foss Bridge Flexure a few kilometres to the northwest of this district (Fraser et al., 1990, fig. 6). These volcanic rocks are proved to lie beneath middle to late Brigantian limestones in the Strelley No. 1 Borehole [SK 5052 4296], located about 7 km north-west of the district (Riley, 1986; Howard et al., in prep.).\n\nIn the Rempstone LN/10-1 Borehole the member is 56 m thick, compared with the 124 m found in the Ratcliffe on Soar Borehole farther west. On the gamma-ray log (Figure 4) it is distinguished by the occurrence of prominent troughs, three of which are interpreted on the completion log as tuff beds between 2 and 5 m thick, interleaved within mudstone. Cuttings samples described in the borehole log indicate that some tuff beds are pale grey to blue, dolomitic to highly calcareous lithologies with white mottles and some lamination. The member thins progressively eastwards from the Rempstone Borehole, to a thickness of 27 m in the Widmerpool No. 1 Borehole where it consists of altered, ‘palagonitic tuffs’; farther east, only 15 m of the member was identified in Long Clawson No. 2 Borehole.\n\nNamurian\n\nThe concealed Namurian strata of the district have been proved, in many oil and coal exploration boreholes, to be in stratigraphical continuity with the succession at outcrop in the southern Pennines. Namurian strata form part of the Upper Carboniferous, ‘post-rift megasequence’ of Fraser and Gawthorpe (1990), although it is noted that the international boundary between the Lower and Upper Carboniferous lies within the Namurian, at the base of the Chokierian Stage. According to Fulton and Williams (1988), combinations of eustatic sea-level change, basinal flexuring and local faulting may have played a part in controlling Namurian sedimentation, which represents the infilling of the preceding, Dinantian tectonic basins (Figure 7).\n\nIn 1939, the discovery of oil-bearing Namurian sandstone reservoirs in the Eakring Oilfield of central Nottinghamshire provided the impetus for further exploration that led to a steady refinement in knowledge of the East Midlands Namurian stratigraphy (Lees and Taitt, 1945; Edwards, 1951; Falcon and Kent, 1960; Downing and Howitt, 1969). More recent regional syntheses of exploration data have focused on the sequence stratigraphy of the Namurian, both at a low resolution (Ebdon et al., 1990; Fraser et al., 1990; Fraser and Gawthorpe, 1990) and at higher resolutions (Church and Gawthorpe, 1994; 1997). The geophysical correlations between boreholes are aided by biostratigraphical determinations of core samples, although the biostratigraphical data points are scattered because of the limited amount of borehole core available, and such studies have enabled the identification of diagnostic faunas for some Namurian marine bands in the Melton Mowbray district.\n\nIn this district as elsewhere, the Namurian is subdivided into the Edale Shale Group, mudstones interbedded with turbidite siltstones and sandstones of prodelta facies, and the overlying Millstone Grit Group, which represents the progradation of deltas that were the precursors of the swampy, delta-plain environments of the Westphalian Coal Measures.\n\nEdale Shale Group (ESh)\n\n‘Edale Shale Group’ is now an obsolete name, and the strata referred to here are likely to fall within the Morridge or Bowland Shale formations (Waters et al., in prep.). The sequence consists of mudstones and silty to sandy turbidites of prodelta facies. Its lower boundary is defined at the base of the Cravenoceras leion Marine Band. The top is less satisfactorily delineated, and is taken at the base of the stratigraphically lowest ‘significant’ feldspathic sandstone typical of the overlying Millstone Grit Group (Stevenson and Gaunt, 1971). The maximum proven thickness of the unit is 649 m in the Widmerpool No. 1 Borehole. It thins southwards, to about 350 m in the Rempstone LN/10-1 and Old Dalby No. 1 boreholes, and in the north-east it pinches out across the Cinderhill–Foss Bridge Flexure, as indicated by the correlations in (Figure 4).\n\nThese strata remain poorly described in boreholes, which generally indicate a sequence of dark grey to black, commonly calcareous and pyritous mudstones, with sporadic to locally common, thin beds of pale grey, micritic limestone and graded beds of siltstone and quartzose sandstone. In the Widmerpool No.1 Borehole, the base of the Edale Shale is indicated by core samples containing ‘Cravenoceras cf. leion’, together with Eumorphoceras sp. (notes on the log). Determinations by the BGS for the same interval (1411–1409 m depth) indicate the ammonoids ?Cravenoceras sp., Girtyoceras, and Eumorphoceras ?pseudobilingue, consistent with an E1a zonal age. Above this, at 1341 m depth, Cravenoceras cf. malhamense was identified on the log (with Caneyella mambranaica), indicative of the E1c zone.\n\nOther biozones, spanning the Pendleian and Arnsbergian stages, have been identified from wireline log correlations between the Duffield, Rempstone LN/10-1 and Old Dalby boreholes, as shown in (Figure 5). The top of the Arnsbergian is uncertain in the Old Dalby Borehole; two possible levels are indicated at about 1038 m and 1062 m, both lower down than documented on the completion report (1009 m). The top of the group is probably Kinderscoutian in age, but there are no definitive marine band provings of this stage, or of the older Chokierian and Alportian stages.\n\nThe main clastic interval in the Rempstone LN/10-1 Borehole occurs between 750 and 640 m depth, in strata of Arnsbergian age. It consists of two graded sedimentary packages, each fining upwards from grey, fine to medium grained quartzose sandstones and siltstones to mudstones with thin interbedded limestones. The 12 m-thick sandstone between 663 and 655 m depth is the main oil reservoir of this producing well (Chapter 11). Wireline log correlations suggest that this bed could be equivalent to the sequence of graded turbiditic sandstones, siltstones and mudstones between 170 and 204 m depth in the Duffield Borehole (Aitkenhead, 1977). The clastic sequence proved at 1223 to 1239 m depth in the Edale Shale Group of the Old Dalby Borehole includes about 10 m of matrix supported subangular conglomerate with clasts of ‘granite’; the ‘granite’ was possibly derived locally, from the Melton Mowbray or Rempstone granodiorites.\n\nMillstone Grit Group (MG)\n\nThe Millstone Grit Group (Stevenson and Gaunt, 1971) comprises a sequence of mudstones with interbedded sandstones lying below the Subcrenatum Marine Band, which delimits the base of the Westphalian. In its type area of north Derbyshire, the Millstone Grit has been divided into a number of thick sandstone-dominated packages (‘grits’), none as yet formally defined. The base of the group is taken to be the base of the stratigraphically lowest sandstone of ‘Millstone Grit’ type, although in the absence of detailed lithological information its delineation can be somewhat arbitrary. In this district, the Millstone Grit represents the progressive culmination of sedimentary infilling of the Widmerpool Half-graben. The infilling was also reflected by a change from the marine to brackish conditions, which prevailed during deposition of the Edale Shale Group, to predominantly deltaic conditions with only sporadic marine incursions during high stands of sea level.\n\nThe Millstone Grit is thickly developed in the south of the Widmerpool Half-graben, with at least 200 m in the Rempstone LN/10-1 Borehole and a maximum 141 m in Great Framlands Borehole. Elsewhere, it thins onto the flanks of the Widmerpool Half-graben, as shown by thicknesses of around 60 to 70 m in the north (Figure 4) as well as in the south-east of the district. The group consists mainly of mudstone, siltstone and interbedded sandstone, with thin (up to 1.2 m) inferior coals and seatearths present in minor proportions. These alternations make up a number of sequences, each representing the response of the Namurian fluvio-deltaic depositional system to a complexity of processes that have effected changes in the patterns of sedimentary stacking (Church and Gawthorpe, 1997). In a study of late Namurian (Marsdenian–Yeadonian) strata in the Wilds Bridge Borehole of this district, Church and Gawthorpe (1994) identified seven sedimentary geophysical log facies. These are:\n\nfacies A marine band\n\nfacies B prodelta to delta front siltstones and sandstones\n\nfacies C distributary mouth bar\n\nfacies D fluvial channel sandstones, with subfacies (I) active fill and subfacies (II) abandonment fill\n\nfacies E interdistributary bay and swamp mudstones and siltstones\n\nfacies F minor mouth bar and crevasse splay sandstones\n\nfacies G minor distributary channel and crevasse channel sand bodies\n\nMarine bands and Lingula bands occur throughout the succession and are considered by Church and Gawthorpe (1994; 1997) to represent maximum flooding surfaces. Their faunas, in combination with geophysical log signatures where no faunas were recovered, are the basis for correlating these strata throughout the subsurface (Figure 4) and (Figure 5). Such considerations suggest that the base of the Millstone Grit Group in this district is probably located within the R1 (Kinderscoutian) stage of the upper Namurian. It is also a surface of unconformity and overstep at either margin of the Widmerpool Half-graben, as shown by (Figure 4); this proves that in the north-east the Millstone Grit crosses the base of the Edale Shale Group, to rest directly on Dinantian strata. To the south of the graben and Hathern Shelf, the Dinantian and much of the Namurian are missing and the Millstone Grit overlies the basement in the Kirby Lane Borehole (Figure 7), and possibly in the Sproxton No. 1 Borehole [SK 8451 2394] that lies to the east of the district.\n\nA characteristic feature of Millstone Grit fluvio-deltaic sandstones in the Pennine Basin is that they are rich in feldspar grains derived from a northerly source (Drewery et al., 1987). However, a significant contribution of sedimentary detritus from the south has been recognised in the Staffordshire Basin (Trewin and Holdsworth, 1973), and more recently in the Loughborough district (Hallsworth, 1998). Palaeocurrents indicate that in the southernmost part of the Pennine Basin the Millstone Grit sediment transport path was commonly deflected to the north-north-west (Fulton and Williams, 1988), parallel to the trend of the Widmerpool Half-graben. This also reflects the influence of the Wales–London–Brabant landmass, which was a Carboniferous tectonic margin in part controlled by the Normanton Hills and/or Sileby faults (Figure 4), (Figure 7), (Figure 8) and (Figure 11) are also indicated. b. Principal early Carboniferous tectonic features of the region, with outline of the Melton Mowbray district (modified from Berridge et al., 1999).\" data-name=\"images/P946215.jpg\">(Figure 3). The interplay between northerly and southerly source regions in the present district is demonstrated by heavy mineral studies of sandstone samples collected from various boreholes. The results (Hallsworth, 2000) indicate that southerly sourced sediment transport systems dominated sedimentation during deposition of the Kinderscout Grit and associated sandstones in pre-R2 or Marsdenian time, although the southerly derived sandstones of this district are more feldspathic than their analogues in the Staffordshire Basin. The northerly derived sand incursions into this district commenced in R2b (Marsdenian) times, when the Ashover Grit was deposited, but then waned to produce mixing between northern and southern sources during deposition of the subsequent Chatsworth Grit and Rough Rock (Yeadonian) sandstones.\n\nBiostratigraphical information for the strata of the Asfordby Hydro, Holwell Works and The Chase boreholes (Riley, 1983a,b; (Figure 13)), in conjunction with geophysical wireline log correlations, enable distinctive datum to be traced across the district. The Kinderscout Grit (KG) and associated Reticuloceras coreticulatum Marine Band were proved from faunas in the Asfordby Hydro and The Chase (Figure 13) boreholes, in both cases with the zonal ammonoid Reticuloceras coreticulatum (R1c4) identified. The sandstone attains 40 m thickness in the Great Framlands Borehole, and 35 m in the Widmerpool No. 1 Borehole (Downing and Howitt, 1969) and in the Old Dalby Borehole (Figure 5), where two upward-coarsening cycles reflect successive phases of delta progradation. Farther north the Kinderscout Grit is considerably thinner (Figure 4). Lower marine horizons with Lingula have also been proved; the presence of Vallites in The Chase Borehole suggests a correlation with strata of Alportian (H2c) to Kinderscoutian (R1c) age.\n\nThe Bilinguites gracilis Marine Band (R2a1), marking the commencement of the Marsdenian, was identified in the Asfordby Hydro Borehole on the basis of a fragment of Bilinguites sp. and its close proximity to the underlying Reticuloceras coreticulatum Marine Band. It has also been identified from its gamma-ray signature in the boreholes farther north (Figure 4). The Asfordby Hydro Borehole has also proved the Bilinguites bilinguis (R2b1-3), B. eometabilinguis (R2b4), B. metabilinguis (R2b5), and B. superbilinguis (R2c1) marine bands. Within the Marsdenian sequence, sandstones occurring between the Superbilinguis and Bilinguis marine bands have been correlated with the Ashover Grit (AsG). This forms a single bed in places (e.g. Great Framlands Borehole), and in the Widmerpool No. 1 Borehole it may be 36 m thick (correlation of Downing and Howitt, 1969), but elsewhere is commonly represented by two or more thin sandstone beds (Figure 4). The Ashover Grit in this district was deposited at a time when the Widmerpool Half-graben was a dominant sediment pathway, according to Church and Gawthorpe (1997); it is generally a fineto medium-grained sandstone, which is locally coarse and ‘gritty’. Intraformational mudstone, siltstone and sandstone and derived quartzite clasts have been noted.\n\nAbove the Ashover Grit, the Verneulites sigma Marine Band (R2c2), has been tentatively identified in the Holwell Works Borehole (Riley, 1983a; (Figure 13)) and may be present in the Great Framlands Borehole. The overlying Chatsworth Grit (ChG) is subject to large local variations in thickness around Asfordby; it is commonly very thin (1–3 m), but in the Old Dalby Borehole there is a thickness of 48 m (Figure 5). The latter includes two coarsening upward, prodelta to delta front cycles, followed by sandstone that indicates the establishment of active fluvial channel facies akin to that identified by Church and Gawthorpe (1994). In the Wilds Bridge Borehole, Church and Gawthorpe (1997) identified the Chatsworth Grit as part of a transgressive sequence. The succeeding Cancelloceras cancellatum (G1a1), and C. cumbriense (G1b1), marine bands are identified in most of the Asfordby area boreholes studied by Riley (1983a), as well as in provings farther north (Figure 4). They generally form a distinctive double peak on gamma-ray logs.\n\nThe Rough Rock (RR) is commonly interpreted as a major, sheet-like fluvial sandstone body (Bristow, 1993). It generally forms a single unit, but locally splits into two or three beds. The thickest provings include 12.66 m for a single sandstone in the Great Framlands Borehole, and 19.44 m in the Asfordby Mine Site No. 6 Borehole where there are two sandstones, separated by seatearth mudstone and a thin coal. The Rough Rock is commonly a fine to coarse-grained, locally coarse and pebbly sandstone, interlaminated with siltstone. The pebbles are generally derived quartzite or intraformational siltstone and mudstone, but igneous clasts have also been noted. The Rough Rock is thinnest in the north of the district, averaging only 1 to 3 m there (Figure 4). The uppermost few metres of the Millstone Grit consist of mudstone, siltstone and seatearth. In places, a thin coal underlying the Subcrenatum Marine Band marks the top of the group.\n\nWestphalian\n\nWestphalian rocks occur in about 80 per cent of the subsurface of the district (Figure 27), beneath the Permo-Triassic cover. Despite this deep burial, much information on the lithology and structure of the Westphalian is available from successive exploration programmes for oil and coal, utilising intermediate-depth drilling and seismic reflection profiling. These investigations have shown that the Westphalian rocks have a generalised dip to the north or north-east, but are locally faulted and folded. The most significant structures are the Foss Bridge Fault and the adjacent Plungar Dome, and the series of anticlines and synclines developed along the Normanton Hills and Sileby faults farther south (Chapter 8).\n\nThe main Westphalian divisions in this district are the Coal Measures Group and the overlying and unconformable red beds of the Warwickshire Group. In addition, there are locally thick developments of basaltic lavas and fragmental rocks represented by the Asfordby Volcanic Formation, and Saltby Volcanic Formation.\n\nCoal Measures Group\n\nThe Coal Measures Group is a new formal lithostratigraphical term (Powell et al., 2000) for strata previously referred to as the ‘Coal Measures’. Its base corresponds to the onset of the marine transgression that deposited the Subcrenatum (Pot Clay) Marine Band, which rests conformably on the Millstone Grit Group, and its top is an unconformity with either the Warwickshire Group or Permo-Triassic strata. In this district the unit attains a maximum thickness estimated to be around 800 m and forms the larger part of the wholly concealed Vale of Belvoir (North-east Leicestershire) Coalfield. There is no current exploitation of coal, but underground mining has taken place in the recent past, around Cotgrave in the north-west and Asfordby in the south (Chapter 11). The local Westphalian stratigraphy is summarised in (Figure 6) together with the scheme of coal seam nomenclature, which closely follows that for the adjoining Nottinghamshire Coalfield (Lamplugh et al., 1908; Charsley et al., 1990; Howard et al., in prep (a)). The most comprehensive treatment of the Vale of Belvoir Coalfield is that by Sheppard (2003).\n\nThe chronostratigraphical subdivision of the Coal Measures Group is based on the identification of three faunal horizons: the Subcrenatum, Vanderbeckei (Clay Cross) and Aegiranum (Mansfield) marine bands (Calver, 1968). These datum define the bases of three stages, which are respectively Langsettian, Duckmantian and Bolsovian (formerly Westphalian A, B and C). The Langsettian corresponds with the Lower Coal Measures lithostratigraphical unit, but the Middle Coal Measures covers both the Duckmantian and the lower part of the Bolsovian. The base of the Upper Coal Measures is taken at the Cambriense (Top) Marine Band, within the Bolsovian, although that faunal marker has not been positively identified in the district. The Upper Coal Measures, and parts of the Middle Coal Measures, are progressively overstepped eastwards along the erosional unconformity marking the base of the Warwickshire Group.\n\nThe earliest strata are the Lower Coal Measures of Langsettian age. They represent a continuation of sedimentation from the Millstone Grit Group, but with an increasing dominance of interchannel, lacustrine depositional environments up-section. This change reflects the longer periods in which land floras were allowed to develop, within the mires that produced the coal seams. The depositional regime was predominantly that of a coastal plain, although in the east this sedimentation pattern was periodically modified or destroyed by repeated marine glacioeustatic transgressions, and by the local build-up of basaltic shields or lava aprons. Later in the Langsettian an upper delta to alluvial plain had been established over the whole district and this environment persisted through the Duckmantian and into the early part of the Bolsovian, when the Middle and Upper Coal Measures were being deposited. The unconformably overlying Warwickshire Group marks a change to better drained alluvial conditions and strata indicate deposition within fluvial channels and overbank environments, the latter commonly distinguished by ferruginous palaeosol horizons.\n\nMost of the detailed borehole logs in this district support the view that Coal Measures sedimentation was cyclic in character. A typical small-scale interseam cycle (Guion et al., 1995) consists of basal dark grey to black, carbonaceous and commonly pyritous mudstone containing nonmarine or less commonly marine fauna (lacustrine or marine conditions). The succeeding strata are generally coarser grained, with siltstone and sandy siltstone (overbank or distal lacustrine delta) and pass up to sandstone (proximal delta or channel). The top of each interseam cycle is generally marked by a seatearth (gleysol, palaeosol) and a coal (mire facies). Plant remains and debris are common throughout these cycles. The sandstones of this district only rarely occur at the tops of cycles, occurring instead mainly as intercycle channel-fill bodies. They are grey and mainly fine to medium grained, commonly cross-bedded and of multistorey type. Typical sedimentary structures preserved in the siltstone and sandstone include parallel lamination, flaser bedding, lenticular bedding, cross-bedding and climbing ripple cross-lamination. In this part of the Pennine Basin, the Coal Measures sequence thins progressively southwards, on to the Wales–London–Brabant Barrier (Fulton and Williams, 1988). Such a trend can be demonstrated for this district, although an additional complexity has been imposed by synsedimentary faulting and volcanic activity in Lower Coal Measures times. In particular, the Saltby Volcanic Formation (see below) represents lava aprons or shields that periodically encroached westwards, into the main Coal Measures depocentres.\n\nThe summary of the Coal Measures, herein, is based on borehole transects arranged to show the main directions of interseam variation in the district (Figure 7); (Figure 8); (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9) and (Figure 11). Thicknesses of the principal coal seams are depicted on an areal basis in (Table 2) and (Table 3), but the main details of interseam lithological variations can be found in Sheppard (2003), and in the technical reports prepared during the mapping of this district (Table 12). The coal seam nomenclature generally follows that for the Nottingham district (Howard et al., in prep (a)). A number of seams merge, as summarised in (Figure 6), and the names change to reflect this. Thus the Low Bright, Brinsley, High Hazels, Cinderhill Main and an unnamed coal merge to form the ‘Top Bright Coal’ in the north-east of the district.\n\nLower Coal Measures (LCM)\n\nThe Lower Coal Measures are present at depth to the east and north of the line on Sheet 142 Melton Mowbray representing the surface projection of the incrop of the Subcrenatum Marine Band at the Permo-Triassic unconformity. The strata occupy a structural basin (Figure 27), formed by folding and faulting at the time of the end-Carboniferous (Variscan) inversion event, and they are locally overstepped by Permo-Triassic strata to the west and the south. In the northern part of the district, the thickness of Lower Coal Measures varies from about 430 m in the west, to 340 m in the east. (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9) shows that the progressive eastwards thinning of Lower Coal Measures sedimentary strata on to the underlying Saltby Volcanic Formation (see below) is largely augmented by thickening of the volcanic rocks in the same direction. The complex stratigraphical relationships between the volcanic rocks and sedimentary strata (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9), and (Burgess, 1982; fig. 6) commonly precludes the accurate correlation of coal seams in the east, which tend to occur as attenuated packages of beds, sandwiched within the thicker parts of the volcanic succession. The Subcrenatum Marine Band has been replaced by the Saltby Volcanic Formation before the Harston No. 1 Borehole [SK 8452 3165] is reached, just beyond the eastern margin of the district. Similarly at the top of the Lower Coal Measures, the Vanderbeckei Marine Band disappears as it onlaps the top surface of the Saltby Volcanic Formation (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12); for example, it is missing from the Woolsthorpe Bridge Borehole [SK 8434 3488], located outside the district. The Lower Coal Measures thin southward across the Normanton Hills Fault (Figure 7); (Figure 8).\n\nSubcrenatum Marine Band to Kilburn Coal: To the west of the area affected by penecontemporaneous volcanic activity, this part of the Lower Coal Measures succession shows a slight, general northwards thickening accentuated by synsedimentary movements along the Normanton Hills Fault (Figure 8); concomitantly, many of the coals show attenuation (e.g. Kilburn, Belper Lawn). At the base, the Subcrenatum Marine Band has locally yielded a diagnostic fauna; for example in the Wilds Bridge Borehole the ammonoids Anthracoceratites sp. and Gastrioceras subcrenatum were identified in addition to marine bivalves Caneyella sp. or Posidonia sp., Dunbarella sp., and fish debris (Riley, 1984). Elsewhere, although the marine band is distinguishable on geophysical logs, the faunas are generally non-diagnostic and include ammonoids, horny brachiopods Lingula and Orbiculoidea, trace fossils such as Planolites and fish debris. The overlying Crawshaw Sandstone (CrS) amalgamates and thickens northwards (Figure 8), but is locally of variable thickness, within a range of between 5 and 12 m overall. Above the Crawshaw Sandstone, a number of Lower Coal Measures marine bands is suggested by wireline geophysical data showing gamma-ray peaks in many boreholes. In the Wilds Bridge Borehole these marine bands occur within 20 m of strata and, with a few exceptions, are identified as dark grey, carbonaceous mudstones with fish debris and Lingula mytilloides (Riley, 1984). They include, from base to top, the Springwood or Honley Marine Band, Listeri Marine Band (immediately above the Alton Coal, and containing Gastrioceras listeri, Anthracoceratites sp., Posidonia sp., Dunbarella papyraceai), Lower Parkhouse (including foraminifers Ammodiscus sp. and the conodont Idiognathodus sp.) and Upper Parkhouse marine bands. A nonmarine fauna including the bivalve Carbonicola extenuata separates the last two. Above the Upper Parkhouse Marine Band, the Forty Yard (Meadow Farm) and Amaliae (Norton) marine bands were identified from the distinctive signature on the geophysical logs. Farther south, in the Sheep Pens Borehole, as well as in other provings in the Asfordby area (Figure 13), Lingulabearing mudstones represent the following marine bands (from base to top) Holbrook, Springwood, Honley, Listeri and Amaliae (Ambrose, 1999); (Table 4). An impersistent sandstone found between the Listeri and Forty Yards marine bands in the Hoe Hill Borehole is an off-white, gritty sandstone with pebbly layers, and is equated with the Loxley Edge Rock, the correlation of which is discussed further in Eden (1954). It should be stressed that there are rapid lateral variations in the coals and marine bands of the Asfordby area, as indicated, for example, by the northwards thickening of the Subcrenatum Marine Band to Kilburn Coal interval in (Figure 8). This is attributed mainly to synsedimentary tectonic uplift along the Normanton Hills Fault, but with the added complication of soft-sediment deformation that was associated with emplacement of the Asfordby Volcanic Formation, see below, and (Figure 13). The major clastic interval represented by the Wingfield Flags (WF) mirrors the trend seen in the Crawshaw Sandstone by generally amalgamating and thickening northwards (Figure 8). It is up to 50 m thick locally, although as little as 8 m has also been recorded, and consists of fineto medium-grained sandstones that are thinly bedded and micaceous; interbeds of siltstone or sandy siltstone are common, and climbing ripple cross-lamination is a typical sedimentary structure.\n\nKilburn Coal to Blackshale Coal: In this interval, the northward thickening noted above continues (Figure 8), and is accompanied by complex splitting of the Mickley coals. The Blackshale and Ashgate coals show a tendency to merge over most of the district, and in the south-east they join with the Mickley 1–3 coals to form a seam up to 8.18 m in the Harby Hill Borehole (Ambrose, 2000b). This merging together of the seams reflects stratal thinning in areas where the Lower Coal Measures lap onto the Saltby Volcanic Formation. Similar eastwards thickening, of the Parkgate, Blackshale and Ashgate and Norton coals, is seen in the south of the district (Table 2).\n\nBlackshale Coal to the Vanderbeckei Marine Band: Above the Blackshale (and Ashgate) Coal, the Low Estheria Band acts as an important faunal marker horizon for those successions where attenuation and/or interdigitation with volcanic rocks precludes accurate coal seam correlations. Generally, it consists of dark grey to black, carbonaceous and micaceous mudstone with a nonmarine to brackish fauna of the crustacean Euestheria, the bivalve Carbonicola, fish debris and fish trace fossils including Cochlichnus. The volcanic rocks in the east of the district that are sporadically intercalated in this part of the succession (Figure 8) are probably the distal equivalent of Phase 1 activity in the Saltby Volcanic Formation (see below). The measures overlying the Blackshale/Ashgate coals maintain a fairly constant overall thickness from south to north, allowing for the intercalation of sills and lavas referred to Phase 2 of the Saltby Volcanic Formation (Figure 7; (Figure 8) and (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9). The Parkgate seam split is complicated and, as summarised in (Figure 6), in contrast to previous interpretations, the Threequarters and Tupton coals are not involved. Splitting of the Deep Main coals takes place in a north-north-west direction across the middle of the map sheet and is also reported from the Scalford area in the south-east (Ambrose, 2000a).\n\nLocal thickening of the sequence between the Yard and Joan/Brown Rake coals, in part, reflects the intercalation of Phase 2 lavas of the Saltby Volcanic Formation (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9). The various channel sandstone bodies intercalated in this part of the succession commonly have a north-south orientation (Figure 10), suggesting diversion or ponding of successively developed drainage systems against the western flanks of the lavas. In the south-east of the district, the succession between the Deep Main Coal and the Vanderbeckei Marine Band thins eastward due to the onlap of the strata across the surface of the Saltby Volcanic Formation. The full upward-coarsening cycle is seen, for example in the Harby Hill Borehole (Ambrose, 2000b), but is missing farther east, in the Waltham Lane Borehole, where the Deep Main, Joan and Brown Rake coals have all combined to form a seam that is 2.56 m thick.\n\nSyn-depositional tectonism during deposition of the Lower Coal Measures is suggested by the stratal thickening noted above. Additionally, (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9) shows an apparent truncation of strata at the disconformity formed by the local base of the Saltby Volcanic Formation, in the Plungar No. 23 Borehole. Here, the absence of the Yard and Blackshale/Ashgate coals broadly corresponds to the axis of folding related to the Plungar Dome. The pattern of interdigitation between the Lower Coal Measures and Saltby Volcanic Formation indicated by (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9) shows that the Tupton, Parkgate and Deep Main coals successively onlap the volcanic rocks over a 2 km distance north-eastwards, between Plungar 23 and Grimmer boreholes. This could suggest a relatively steep western flank to the volcanic pile, which was perhaps accentuated by syn-volcanic faulting and flexuring in that area.\n\nMiddle Coal Measures (MCM)\n\nThe subsurface occurrence of the Middle Coal Measures on Sheet 142 Melton Mowbray is to the east and north of the line representing the incrop of the Vanderbeckei Marine Band at the Permo-Triassic unconformity (Figure 27). The unit is conformably overlain by the Upper Coal Measures in parts of the north and east of the district, but is also extensively overstepped by the Warwickshire Group and Permo-Triassic rocks and is absent from the subsurface in large areas of the south and west. The thickness of the Middle Coal Measures is at least 240 m in the north-west of the district.\n\nVanderbeckei Marine Band to Cinderhill Main/Top Bright Coal: The Vanderbeckei Marine Band, marking the base of the Middle Coal Measures, is up to 12 m thick in the north-west of the district. It consists of dark grey, generally laminated mudstone with common burrows, some pyritised, pyrite nodules and thin beds or nodules of ironstone. The base is locally black and carbonaceous or canneloid, with common plant remains including Calamites and Pecopteris. The brachiopods Lingula and Orbiculoidea were noted. Other fossils recorded are the marine bivalves, Dunbarella, Myalina, Pecten, and ?Posidoniella; gastropods including Euphemites, Platyconcha and Soleniscus; productids, ammonoids, ostracods including Geisina, foraminifera, the crustacean Euestheria; fish debris, coprolites and trace fossils including Cochlichnus, Planolites opthalmoides, ?Tomaculum and the worm tube Spirorbis. Nonmarine bivalves, including Carbonicola, Anthracosia, Anthraconaia, Anthracosphaerium and Naiadites have also been recorded and all typically occur interbedded with the marine fauna. The marine band has been proved persistently across the district, although it onlaps the volcanic rocks in the extreme east, e.g. (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9); (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12); one exception is in the Hoe Hill Borehole, where it has been washed out by sandstone. Across the transect shown in (Figure 11), the Vanderbeckei Marine Band thins noticeably, from an average thickness of 12 m in the west to 2 m or less in the east. For example, in Croxton Banks Borehole, the marine band consists of only 2 m of dark grey, pyritous mudstone with Lingula, the nonmarine bivalve Anthracosia, foraminifera, ostracods and fish debris, accompanied by a flora of Mariopteris.\n\nThe northern part of the district contains the most complete sections through the Middle Coal Measures. The unit shows marked attenuation to the east where it is also overstepped progressively by the Warwickshire Group. This eastwards thinning was attributed by Burgess (1982) to the relatively low degree of compaction of rocks comprising the Saltby Volcanic Formation, in the underlying Lower Coal Measures. The thinning is, however, most accentuated in strata above the Third Waterloo Coal, as shown by (Figure 11). Thus over a horizontal distance of several kilometres the thickness of the Third Waterloo to Brinsley/Low Bright Coal interval reduces from 82 m, in the Coach Gap Farm Borehole, to 50 m in the Calcrofts Close Borehole. Sandstone bodies occupy correspondingly larger proportions of the measures farther east, some representing multistorey channel bodies forming the basal parts of interseam cycles. An example in the Stathern South Borehole is the 9.7 m thick sandstone above the Dunsil/1st Waterloo Coal, which is composed of five amalgamated sandstone beds, the thickest being at the base. The sandstones are pale green and fine grained, with ripple cross-laminated sets present throughout. The overlying strata comprise several siltstone beds characterised by sandy laminae and ripple-drift cross-lamination, with contorted bedding and burrows in some beds. The siltstones are capped by 1.5 m of seatearth, consisting of siltstone with ironstone nodules passing up to mudstone, which is overlain by the Top Hard group of coals.\n\nCinderhill Main/Top Bright Coal to Cambriense Marine Band: Complex splits and mergers of seams in the interval between the Cinderhill Main and Low Bright coals accompany an overall eastward attenuation of the upper part of the Middle Coal Measures (Figure 11). Thus in the Grimmer Borehole these coals have merged to produce the Top Bright seam of 2.6 m thickness. This is in turn overlain by a major channel sandstone body, 23.3 m thick in total, comprised of four amalgamated beds. The rest of the overlying 28 m of strata in the Grimmer Borehole, up to the junction with the Warwickshire Group, consists of interbedded siltstone and sandstone. These beds are lateral replacements of the Main Bright Coal, as well as the Maltby Marine Band, which occur at the same stratigraphical level within the thicker sequence farther west.\n\nAbove the Two Foot Coal (or where the latter is absent, the High Hazles to Low Bright coals), the sequence changes to one with relatively thin seam intervals and correspondingly thick seatearths (up to 3–4 m), and is punctuated by marine bands. The earliest of these is the Maltby (Two Foot) Marine Band, present over 5.6 m of strata in Stathern South Borehole. A note with the log by M A Calver (1977) draws attention to the co-existence of the marine ostracod Cypridina cf. phillipsi with nonmarine bivalves such as Naiadites augustus, suggestive of proximity to the shoreline at this time. In the same borehole the Aegiranum (Mansfield) Marine Band, defining the junction between the Duckmantian and Bolsovian stages, is identified by blocky, dark grey mudstones with Lingula mytilloides, the annelid Serpuloides stubblefieldi and productid bivalve fragments. This assemblage is supplemented by the nonmarine bivalve Anthracosia, and a marine fauna of Edmondia and Orbiculoidea in Stroom Dyke Borehole. The Edmondia and overlying Shafton marine bands were tentatively identified together in the Hills Farm Borehole within a thickness of 8.4 m of siltstone and muddy siltstone containing fucoids, Mariopteris and Alethopteris and bivalves including the nonmarine Anthraconaia pruvosti. The bivalves may indicate the presence of the Main Estheria Band, which normally occurs between the Edmondia and Shafton marine bands. The Cambriense (Top) Marine Band, whose top also defines that of the Middle Coal Measures, is tentatively identified over about 5 m of strata in the Stroom Dyke Borehole, where it may be faulted; it consists of poorly laminated, pyritous mudstone with fucoids, fish debris and ostracods.\n\nUpper Coal Measures (UCM)\n\nThese strata are thin and discontinuous due to their removal by erosion at the unconformities with the Warwickshire Group or Permo-Triassic sequence. Their identification depends upon recognition of the Cambriense Marine Band, the top of which is taken to be the base of the Upper Coal Measures. The marine band has only been tentatively identified, however, from the Stroom Dyke Borehole described above. There, it is overlain by about 10 m of mudstone and brick red micaceous siltstone with a bed of ‘grit’ (1 m thick), which contains subangular fragments of acid and basic igneous rock. A red colouration, accompanied by ochreous mottling, is typical of the topmost Coal Measures strata in this district. This is a secondary feature, caused by staining below the Permo-Triassic strata or (where present) the Warwickshire Group.\n\nWestphalian volcanic and intrusive rocks\n\nAlkali basaltic magmatism in the eastern and central parts of the district possibly commenced in the latest Namurian and continued throughout the Langsettian (Lower Coal Measures). The complex relationships caused by interdigitation between the extrusive rocks and Coal Measures strata are summarised in (Figure 7) and (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9), and the areal distribution of the two main igneous formations is shown in (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12). Burgess (1982) and Kirton (1984) provided brief reviews of this activity, and two formations have been formally named during this resurvey.\n\nThe Asfordby Volcanic Formation is a thick but areally restricted sequence of basaltic peperite breccias. They are possibly intrusive, and were emplaced into strata below the Kilburn Coal in the south of the district. The Saltby Volcanic Formation is a more widespread development of basaltic extrusive rocks. The base lies close to the Namurian–Westphalian boundary and the top between the Yard and Parkgate seams in the Lower Coal Measures sequence.\n\nBasic intrusive rocks, mainly sills, some of which have been named, occur throughout the Lower Coal Measures and lower part of the Middle Coal Measures, but have not been encountered above the Dunsil/1st Waterloo seam (Figure 6). Sills have also been encountered in the Namurian and Dinantian sequences of the district.\n\nAsfordby Volcanic Formation (AsVo)\n\nThe Asfordby Volcanic Formation, named by Ambrose (1999), is confined to a narrow subsurface zone around the Asfordby Colliery site. Its southern limit is not known, but may be taken at the Sileby Fault (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12). The formation consists mainly of fragmental basaltic rocks, some of which are referred to as ‘agglomerates’ on borehole logs. It should be stressed that many of the classifications previously used for these rocks cannot now be supported, and as discussed below certain lithologies formerly described as ‘agglomerate’ may in reality be peperite breccias.\n\nThe precise age of the Asfordby Volcanic Formation is not known with any certainty because of doubts as to the extrusive or intrusive origin of these rocks, discussed below. The earliest (stratigraphically lowest) proving is in The Chase Borehole, where the formation occurs at a late Kinderscoutian to Early Marsdenian level; the Coreticulatum Marine Band (Kinderscoutian), and sandstones correlated with the Kinderscout Grit, have been proved respectively 25 m and 10 m below the first basalt. The top of the basalt pile in the Asfordby Farm Borehole lies within Langsettian strata (Figure 13), just below the seam identified as the Kilburn Coal. If an intrusive mode of origin is adopted, the latter datum, being part of the ‘roof’ to the Asfordby Formation, would approximate to the maximum possible age of the magmatism.\n\nA maximum 141 m thickness of the Asfordby Volcanic Formation was proved in The Chase Borehole. The northerly limit of the formation is well constrained by borehole evidence in the Asfordby Colliery area, and is a remarkably abrupt interface across which the basaltic rocks disappear over distances that in some cases are as little as 50 m from the main mass (Figure 13). Even close to the formation’s margin, basalt is found interdigitating with Lower Coal Measures strata only in the Asfordby Mine Site Nos. 2, 4 and 5 boreholes, all being within 100 m of the subcrop. The exception to this is in the Asfordby Hydro Borehole, about 25 m below the Kilburn Coal, where there are layers of basalt that show partly crenulated or ‘pillowed’ contacts against sedimentary rocks (Old and Riley, 1983). Beds rich in basaltic fragments are found in conjunction with disturbed sedimentary strata, that in places assume near-vertical attitudes, in the Holwell Works and Asfordby North Shaft boreholes. The disturbed Namurian strata in the Asfordby Hydro Borehole, just below the level of the Cumbriense Marine Band, show features indicative of soft-sediment deformation. Away from the mine area, to the north, north-west and west, the limits of the formation are poorly constrained, in part due to boreholes terminating higher in the Coal Measures sequence.\n\nThe thick basaltic rocks in the Asfordby North Shaft, Asfordby Farm, Osier Bed and Welby Church boreholes (Figure 13) were described as lava flows by Old and Riley (1983), with individual layers from 1 to 17 m thick recognised in many cores. Inter-layer weathering was not obvious, however, and many internal contacts were described as ‘firmly welded’. Mudstone and siltstone fragments, apparently showing few signs of baking, occurred within some of the basalt layers, and in the Osier Bed Borehole, Old and Riley (1983) noted a sedimentary component enclosing poorly developed basaltic pillows. The present authors have found that coarsely fragmental lithologies are present in layers that are metres thick, and are interleaved with more massive basalt throughout the Welby Church Borehole where the formation is over 100 m thick. In these rocks the larger (block-size) basalt fragments commonly show curviplanar to amoeboid margins, similar to fragments of pillows (e.g. Carlisle, 1963; Staudigel and Schmincke, 1984). The matrix between these fragments is remarkably heterogeneous, with two principal components recognised (Plate 2). In a thin section (E72703), one component consists of abundant fragments of amygdaloidal basaltic scoria with smoothly rounded to cuspate margins. Each fragment is surrounded by a thin, dark grey, glassy, nonvesicular rim. Separating the scoria fragments, the second component consists of fine-grained to amorphous, locally amygdaloidal, chloritised material, possibly representing highly altered sediment. The mudstone immediately overlying the main basalt sequence is variously described in completion logs as being baked (Welby Church, The Chase boreholes), or heavily veined with calcite (Laneside, Substation Asfordby). The best description of the top contact of the formation comes from the horizon at 517.72 m depth in the Asfordby Mine Site No.1 Borehole. There, dark grey mudstone of the Lower Coal Measures sequence sharply overlies dark greenish grey, nonvesicular basalt. This contact is described as ‘highly irregular with many fragments of igneous rock in sediments for 15 cm; contact selvedges slightly paler and finer grained’. Just one metre below this upper contact, ‘pillowed masses’ were noted in the basalt.\n\nOld and Riley (1983) considered the possibilities that the Asfordby basalts were extruded either as lava flows, contemporaneously with late Namurian to early Langsettian sedimentation, or as lavas of entirely Langsettian age that, due to their heat and weight, burrowed downwards through the sediments into Namurian strata. It is difficult to envisage the first of these alternatives, requiring large volumes of basalt to be erupted over a fairly extended period, within about 100 m of a normally accumulating Namurian to Langsettian sedimentary sequence (Figure 13). On the other hand, it is possible that basaltic magma was rapidly emplaced by multiple sheet intrusion at shallow levels into unconsolidated wet sediments, the resulting complex interactions causing the observed pervasive development of peperitic breccias (White et al., 2000). Such a mechanism would account for the lack of weathering seen in other provings of the top of the formation, as well as the weak baking and calcite mineralisation noted in the immediately overlying mudstone. Intrusion would also give rise to the apophyses of peperitic material found in the adjacent strata, as in the Asfordby Hydro Borehole; a forcible intrusive mode explains the synsedimentary deformation of these strata.\n\nAn intrusive mode of origin, with the Kilburn Coal and higher strata forming the roof to the sedimentary carapace enclosing the Asfordby Volcanic Formation, requires that this magmatism was younger than its stratigraphical position suggests. Phreatomagmatic extrusive activity, contemporaneous with the basalt intrusion, may indeed have given rise to the tuffs, spatially related to the Asfordby Volcanic Formation, overlying the Kilburn Coal in boreholes north of the Asfordby Mine Site (Figure 13). There are further tuff beds in the Steelworks Borehole, which are also of Early Langsettian age, occurring between the Listeri and Amaliae marine bands.\n\nSaltby Volcanic Formation (Stby)\n\nThis formation was named by Ambrose (2000a), who designated a type section in the Egypt Plantation Borehole, about 1.5 km to the east of this district [SK 8660 2786]. It represents a complex association between basaltic lavas, pyroclastic and epiclastic rocks and basic sills. The formation is widely distributed in the subsurface of the eastern part of the district (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12), and it both thickens and amalgamates eastwards, towards the presumed volcanic source region, achieving about 280 m thickness in the Harston No. 1 Borehole (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9), just outside the district. The latter record suggests that volcanism had commenced, possibly just after deposition of the Subcrenatum Marine Band. The termination of activity was placed by Burgess (1982; fig. 6) immediately after deposition of the Vanderbeckei Marine Band, corresponding to the Langsettian–Duckmantian boundary. In this district, however, younger pyroclastic fall-outs, in early Duckmantian times, are also suggested by the thin ash-grade tuff beds occurring in the Thorney Plantation Borehole between the 4th and 3rd Waterloo Coals and between the 3rd Waterloo Coal seam split in the Middle Coal Measures.\n\nIn an overview of this volcanism, Burgess (1982) pointed out the limitations of the subsurface data and the difficulties this imposed for distinguishing between the various classes of igneous or extrusive basaltic rock. Despite these problems the borehole correlations (Figure 7); (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9) point to there being two major expansions of volcanism, broadly equivalent to the main pulses of activity suggested by Burgess (1982), although not by Kirton (1984, fig. 3). In this account, they are designated as Phase 1 and Phase 2, each representing the construction of a basaltic lava shield or outflow apron westwards across the northern part of the district (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\n\nPhase 1 Volcanism between the Subcrenatum Marine Band and Mickley/Ashgate coal grouping\n\nThis activity denoted the first major westwards encroachment of basalt, which may locally have been directed along the foot of the Cinderhill–Foss Bridge Flexure (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12). It commenced at about the level of the Crawshaw Sandstone in the east of the district, where an early pyroclastic episode is suggested by gamma-ray interpretations of the Harston and Redmile boreholes. The volcanic products also include basalt flows (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\" data-name=\"images/P946221.jpg\">(Figure 9), and in the Plungar area lavas postdate the Kilburn coal. The base of the volcanic rocks is thus diachronous, becoming progressively younger farther west, whereas volcanism was more or less continuous in the east, where the main centres of eruption were probably located. The surface of the lavas is, by definition, a plane of disconformity, and as sedimentation recommenced it was progressively onlapped to the east, first by the Mickley coals and later by the Blackshale/Ashgate and Yard coals.\n\nAbout 200 m of ‘tuff’ extending between the Rough Rock and Morley Muck Coal in the Colston Bassett South Borehole (see Section 1 on the Sheet 142 Melton Mowbray) is also attributed to Phase 1. Descriptions of the borehole chip samples (Sabine, 1963) indicate an abundance of ‘scoria’ fragments, and thus a probable pyroclastic-dominated sequence. Sabine concluded that such a great thickness of pyroclastic rocks must be due to the presence of a volcanic centre, here termed the ‘Colston Bassett Centre’ (Figure 13).\" data-name=\"images/P946224.jpg\">(Figure 12).\n\nVolcanic breccias and fine-grained tuffs of Langsettian age in the southern part of the district are located within one kilometre of the main development of the Asfordby Volcanic Formation and ar"
