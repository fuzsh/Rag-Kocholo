        "text": "UK Outlook for Monday 2 Sep 2024 to Wednesday 11 Sep 2024: High pressure is most likely to be located either over or close to the UK through much of this period, leading to a more widely settled period of weather for most, with some cool nights, but near or slightly above average temperatures by day. That said, weak frontal systems could still provide some cloud and patchy outbreaks of rain in northwestern areas at times, and there is a chance of some heavy thundery showers and more humid conditions in the south too, particularly later in the period when the high pressure may begin to drift slowly to the west. However, many areas are more likely to be drier than normal with predominately settled weather and light winds.\n\nUK Outlook for Thursday 12 Sep 2024 to Thursday 26 Sep 2024: Moving through then beyond mid-September confidence for the continuation of settled weather falls low. Instead, it is more likely that there will be a return to a mixture of weather types, with spells of wet weather interspersed with drier periods. By this period it is expected temperatures will have returned to near average, perhaps slightly cooler than average in the north or northwest at times.\n\nMountsorrel is a village in Leicestershire on the River Soar, just south of Loughborough with a population of 6,662 inhabitants. A castle was built in 1080 by Hugh Lupus, but there is evidence of an earlier Norman settlement in the area in the form of pottery fragments. A Roman villa is supposed to have existed on Broad Hill during the 4th century AD, the site of today's quarry, as quarrying during the late 1800s revealed many artefacts including a preserved wooden bucket. However, the first recording of the village was in 1377, when it had a population of 156.\n\nThe Mountsorrel Weather Station is located in Mountsorrel which is just South of Loughborough andjust North of Leicester, Leicestershire.\n\nThis website is non for profit and is freely maintained by Stormchaser Stuart Robinson whose passion is for all type of weather but especially the more severe types of weather such as Hurricanes, Typhoons and Tornadoes.\n\nStuart oftens travels the globle to experabce severe weather first after seeing his first tornado outside a town called Stuart in Nebraska, USA on the 9th June 2003."
