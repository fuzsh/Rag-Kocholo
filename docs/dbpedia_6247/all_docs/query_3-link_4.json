The August 1990 figure for Barbourne has been subject to scrutiny and might be unreliable - no other location that day reported a temperature over 36C. The 6 August Brent Pelham reading was out of line with neary stations and might not be accurate. Enfield recorded 36.9C on 9 August 2003, but the site was a rooftop and non-standard. The 2003 Faversham figure has been disputed, but it was definitely over 38 in the SE (38.1 Kew).\n\nThere is some uncertainty about earlier records for several reasons: non-standard screening of thermometers, the unreliability of Glaisher screens before Stevenson screens, non-standard positioning of sceens, the accuracy of thermometers, and the use of the Fahrenheit rather than Celsius scale. Before 1900, July 1868 was undoubtedly hot, and at some point probably exceeded 36; July 1808 saw some very hot days, and might have been very hot.\n\nThe earliest date on which 90F (32.2C) has been reached was on the 22 May 1922; the latest date was 19 September 1926.\n\nAll days over 36C have happened in July and August.\n\nThe lowest annual maximum is 27.8C, recorded in 1920 (Raunds) and 1962 (Writtle, Essex).\n\nThe hottest summer days occur when a very hot air mass (drawn up from the Continent on a southerly or southeaserly airflow) stagnates, with very little wind. Temperatures are likely to be higher after a lengthy spell of dry weather (e.g. 1911, 1976, 1990) because more of the sun's heat is used on heating the air rather than evaporating moisture from the ground. If there is wind, sheltered spots are favoured. This is one reason why London fares so well; in addition to any urban heating, it is sheltered from southerly winds by the North Downs. The anticyclone stops the hot air mixing vertically. Obviously the higher the angle of the sun the better (you can't hope for too much on Midwinter's Day!). It helps if the soil is dry, so that energy isn't \"wasted\" evaporating soil water.\n\nHottest day for each extended summer month and hottest days since 1900\n\nMayÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 32.8 (1922, London; 1944, London)\n\nJunÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 35.6 (1976, Southampton), 35.6 (1957 rounded from 35.55, 96F, London)\n\nJulyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 40.3 (2022, Coningsby, Lincs.)\n\nAugust Â Â Â Â Â 38.5 (2003, Faversham; 38.1 Wisley)\n\nSeptemberÂ Â Â Â Â 35.6 (1906, Bawtry)\n\nThe history of the hottest day in Britain\n\n2022Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 40.3C at Coningsby (Lincs.), 19 July\n\n2019Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 38.7C reported at Cambridge Botanical Gardens, 25 July\n\n2003Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 38.5C reported at Faversham, 10 August (disputed, 38.1 accepted)\n\n1990Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 37.1C at Cheltenham, 3 August\n\n1911Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 36.7C at Raunds and Canterbury, 9 August\n\n1868Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Before 1911 things are less clear because of concerns over the accuracy of measurements. 38.1C (100.5F) was reported as being recorded at Tonbridge on the 22nd, although the screening was nonstandard and this temperature is now recognised as being far too high. The temperature was more likely actually around 36.5C (97-98F).\n\nLongest spells with consecutive days over 30C\n\n1976Â Â Â Â Â 16\n\n1947Â Â Â Â Â 14\n\n2006Â Â Â Â Â 13 out of 14\n\n2003Â Â Â Â Â 10\n\n2018 Â Â Â Â Â 9\n\n1975, 1983, 1995 8\n\nHot weather across the world\n\nThe highest verified temperature recorded on Earth is 56.7 ÂºC at Furnace Creek, in Death Valley, California, USA, on 10 July 1913. A reading of 57.8Â Â°C on 13 September 1922, in 'Azizya in Libya was decided to be unreliable in 2012. If the Furnace Creek record is subsequently rejected, as is possible, the record will be 54.0 (Death Valley on 20 June 2013, and in Mitribah, Kuwait, on 21 July 2016).\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in Europe is 48.0, at Athens (Greece) on 10 July 1977. The record for France is 46.0 (Verargies, HÃ©rault, 28 June 2019), the Netherlands 40.7 (Gilze en rijen, 25 July 2019), and Spain 47.6 (La Rambla, Cordoba, on 14 August 2021).\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in the Republic of Ireland is 33.3ÂºC at Kilkenny Castle on 26 June 1887. In the twentieth centure it was 32.5ÂºC at Boora (Co Offaly) on 29 June 1976, and more recently we have seen 33.0ÂºC at Phoenix Park (Dublin) on 18 July 2022.\n\nThe hottest days in Britain from 1875\n\n1875 30.1 Hillington (Norfolk) 16 August\n\n1876 35.0 Cambridge 14 August\n\n1877 29.7 Stratfield Turgis (Hants.) 18 June\n\n1878 33.9 Llandudno 27 June\n\n1879 26.8 Hillington (Norfolk) 29 July\n\n1880 30.7 Loughborough (Leics.) 4 September\n\n1881 35.0 Camden Square 15 July\n\n1882 29.2 Portsmouth 6 August\n\n1883 28.7 Norwood (London), Tunbridge Wells (Kent) 29 June\n\n1884 34.1 Hillington (Norfolk) 11 August\n\n1885 33.3 Southampton 26 July (34.7 Osborne (IoW) on same date appears suspect)\n\n1886 31.7 Southampton 4 July\n\n1887 31.7 Cambridge 3 July\n\n1888 31.1 Cambridge 25 June\n\n1889 30.3 Regents Park (London) 1 August\n\n1890 28.3 Llandovery (Dyfed) 6 September\n\n1891 30.0 Loughborough (Leics.) 10 September\n\n1892 29.4 Cambridge 3 July\n\n1893 34.7 Wryde (Cambs.) 18 August\n\n1894 30.6 Weston-super-Mare 1 July\n\n1895 30.6 Stratfield Turgis (Hants.) 25, 27 September\n\n1896 31.2 Norwood (London) 14 July\n\n1897 32.2 Cambridge 5 August\n\n1898 33.4 Norwood (London) 7 September\n\n1899 32.4 Cambridge 25 August (33.3 Bramley on 15 August appears suspect)\n\n1900 35.1 Cambridge 20 July\n\n1901 33.3 Bawtry (South Yorks.), Colly Weston (Northants.) 19 July, Newton Rigg (Cumbria) 20 July\n\n1902 31.9 Hereford 28 June\n\n1903 31.1 Wryde (Cambridgeshire) 10 July\n\n1904 32.2 Margate 4 August\n\n1905 30.0 Bawtry (South Yorks.) 14 July\n\n1906 35.6 Bawtry (South Yorks.) 1 September\n\n1907 30.0 Lairg 16 July\n\n1908 32.8 Dumfries 2 July\n\n1909 33.3 Epsom 15 August\n\n1910 28.9 Maidenhead 20 June\n\n1911 36.7 Raunds, Canterbury 9 August\n\n1912 32.8 Tottenham 12 July\n\n1913 29.4 New Malden (London) 16 June\n\n1914 32.2 Woking, New Malden, Wisley (Surrey) 1 July\n\n1915 32.2 Cromer, Norwich 8 June\n\n1916 30.0 Woking 30 July, Salisbury 31 July\n\n1917 33.9 Reading, Little Massingham (Norfolk) 17 June\n\n1918 33.9 Canterbury 22 August\n\n1919 32.2 Raunds 11 September\n\n1920 27.8 Raunds 17 June\n\n1921 34.4 Woking, Halstead (Essex) 11 July\n\n1922 32.8 Camden Square 22 May\n\n1923 35.6 Camden Square 13 July\n\n1924 32.2 Camden Square 12 July\n\n1925 33.3 Hunstanton 22 July\n\n1926 32.2 Camden Square 19 September\n\n1927 29.4 Camden Square 16 June\n\n1928 32.8 Camden Square, Newport (IOW) 15 July\n\n1929 32.2 Camden Square, Margate 31 August; Newport (IOW) 5 September\n\n1930 34.4 Camden Square 29 August\n\n1931 28.3 Bromley 14 June\n\n1932 36.1 London (several sites, inc.
