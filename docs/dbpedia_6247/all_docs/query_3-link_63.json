Since 1900,\n\n34C or more seen 24 years, in (10 times 34-35:1921, 1930, 1933, 1941, 1947, 1959, 1975, 1989, 2013, 2017 plus the 14 years below.\n\n35C or more has been seen in just 14 years from 1900 on (1906, 1911, 1923, 1932, 1948, 1957, 1976, 1990, 1995, 2003, 2006, 2015, 2018, 2019),\n\n36C or more has been seen in 7 yearsÂ Â (1911, 1932, 1990, 2003, 2006, 2015, 2019)\n\n37C or more twice (1990 and 2003),\n\n38C or more twice (2003 and 2019).\n\nThe summer of 1976 was exceptional in containing 5 consecutive days above 35C. The lowest annual maximum is 27.8C, recorded in 1920 (Raunds) and 1962 (Writtle, Essex).\n\nThe earliest date on which 90F (32.2C) has been reached was on the 22 May 1922; the latest date was 19 September 1926.\n\nThe hottest summer days occur when a very hot air mass (drawn up from the Continent on a southerly or southeaserly airflow) stagnates, with very little wind. Temperatures are likely to be higher after a lengthy spell of dry weather (e.g. 1911, 1976, 1990) because more of the sun's heat is used on heating the air rather than evaporating moisture from the ground. If there is wind, sheltered spots are favoured. This is one reason why London fares so well; in addition to any urban heating, it is sheltered from southerly winds by the North Downs. The anticyclone stops the hot air mixing vertically. Obviously the higher the angle of the sun the better (you can't hope for too much on Midwinter's Day!). It helps if the soil is dry, so that energy isn't \"wasted\" evaporating soil water.\n\nHottest day for each extended summer month and hottest days since 1900\n\nMayÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 32.8 (1922, London; 1944, London)\n\nJuneÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 35.6 (1976, Southampton), 34.5C (2017, Heathrow)\n\nJulyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 38.7 (2019, Cambridge Botannical Gardens), 36.7 (2015, Heathrow),Â Â 36.0 (Greenwich and Epsom, 1911), 35.9 (1976 at Cheltenham).\n\nAugustÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 38.5 (2003, Faversham), 37.1 (1990, Cheltenham, 3rd)\n\nSeptemberÂ Â Â Â Â 35.6 (1906, Bawtry), 34.6 (1911, Raunds), 34.4 (2016, Gravesend),\n\nThe history of the hottest day in Britain\n\n2019Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 38.7C reported at Cambridge Botanical Gardens, 25 July\n\n2003Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 38.5C reported at Faversham, 10 August (disputed, 38.1 accepted)\n\n1990Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 37.1C at Cheltenham, 3 August\n\n1911Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 36.7C at Raunds and Canterbury, 9 August\n\n1868Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Before 1911 things are less clear. 38.1C (100.5F) was reported as being recorded atÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Tonbridge on the 22nd, although the screening was nonstandard and this temperature is now recognised as being far too high.
