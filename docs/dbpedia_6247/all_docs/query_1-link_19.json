        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis prospective, observational single-center study shows for the first time the prognostic impact of copeptin in a well-characterized cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The main findings are (i) that levels of copeptin and hs-cTnI upon hospital admission were significantly higher among those with a subsequent adverse course of disease; (ii) an association of increased copeptin and hs-cTnI with the primary endpoint, both individually and in combination, which persisted after multivariable adjustment; (iii) a significant risk reclassification of patients with increased hs-cTnI by the addition of copeptin with regards to both study endpoints; and (iv) an incremental value of the combination of raised copeptin and hs-cTnI for outcome prediction when added to the baseline risk model of our study or the ISARIC 4C Clinical deterioration model.\n\nThe antidiuretic hormone vasopressin plays a key role in the regulation of fluid balance and cardiovascular homeostasis. The most powerful stimulus for vasopressin release is a change in plasma osmolality with even small changes being of clinical significance. Vasopressin has also been shown to increase in response to stress or acute-life threating conditions as it influences the body’s response to both acute and chronic stressful conditions [6]. Copeptin, the c-terminal fragment of the vasopressin precursor protein, is characterized by excellent ex vivo stability as it is cleared less rapidly from plasma compared to vasopressin, which makes it a viable surrogate marker of vasopressin release, that can be used for routine measurement in clinical practice [7]. Our data show that copeptin levels were increased in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as the median levels (19.5 pmol/L, IQR 8.9–46.7) were above the established normal values of a healthy population (median of 4.2 pmol/L, IQR 1–13.8 pmol/L). To date, only one study has published data on copeptin measurements in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (n = 98) and found significantly increased values compared to patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia [14].\n\nAlthough the underlying mechanism by which copeptin is linked to COVID-19 has not been elucidated yet, several potential mechanisms may play a role in the observed association. First, we should consider that raised levels of copeptin have been reported in several clinical conditions and are not specific to a certain situation or organ manifestation. Similarly to our findings, higher levels of copeptin have been reported in patients with arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and history of cardiovascular disease [11, 12, 18]. Thus, the increase of copeptin may be partially explained by a higher baseline comorbidity burden. This is in line with our findings of a higher rate of abnormal admission ECGs among patients with increased hs-cTnI and copeptin, which may reflect a history of cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular morbidity in general. Another potential pathophysiological link may lie in the association of copeptin with infectious diseases and inflammation [19]. We also found a significant correlation of copeptin with CRP and NLR, as surrogate markers of inflammation, which have both been reported to be of prognostic value in COVID-19 [20, 21]. Copeptin has also emerged as a promising biomarker of the non-specific stress response to acute illness, which may further contribute to risk stratification in COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger a substantial stress response in some individuals [22]. Furthermore, Lin et al. have previously demonstrated that increased values of copeptin were highly specific for diagnosing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury [23]. Since ARDS is a critical complication of COVID-19, copeptin levels upon admission may thus facilitate identification of patients at risk for ARDS and a subsequent fatal clinical course.\n\nRegardless of the underlying pathophysiology, our study findings corroborate the role of copeptin to predict adverse outcomes in a variety of clinical conditions by extending its use to patients with COVID-19. In our study, the optimal cut-off point of copeptin to predict the primary endpoint was 19.3 pmol/L, which is above the 99th percentile of 13.5 pmol/L found in a healthy population and the suggested cut-off of 10 pmol/L for the rule-out of myocardial infarction. Interestingly, the optimal cut-off of hs-cTnI (16.8 ng/L) to predict the primary endpoint was well below the 99th percentile of 59 ng/L.\n\nWe also show that using a dual marker strategy by measuring copeptin and hs-cTnI together upon hospital admission for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection adds significant prognostic value to established risk prediction models for COVID-19. An incremental discriminatory and reclassification predictive value of copeptin, hs-cTnI and the combination of copeptin / hs-cTnI upon addition to the baseline model of our study and the ISARIC 4C clinical deterioration model—which has been validated as a potent risk score in COVID-19—was observed [15]. The highest C-statistics, NRI and IDI values were recorded for the combination of raised copeptin and hs-cTnI. Only patients with both increased hs-cTnI and copeptin had a markedly higher risk of an adverse outcome, while patients with raised hs-cTnI and copeptin levels below the optimal cut-off point had a similar prognosis to those with low values of hs-cTnI. A similar risk reclassification was also observed for the secondary endpoint of 28-day mortality. Our proposed dual biomarker strategy may help to identify patients at risk of an adverse outcome and hence guide early management. The combination of copeptin and hs-cTnI provides significant, additional prognostic value over the single use of hs-cTnI, as evidenced by the findings of our study. However, we should also consider that the C-statistics of 0.718 for the combination of increased hs-cTnI and copeptin is rather modest and hence has to be interpreted within the context of the individual clinical situation. This observation in patients with confirmed COVID-19 is very consistent with findings in 3890 patients presenting with acute symptoms to the emergency department [24]. In a multivariate Cox regression model, elevated copeptin was independently associated with all-cause death in the acute coronary syndrome (HR = 1.7 (95% CI 1.3–2.3), p = 0.002) and non—acute coronary syndrome cohort (HR = 2.7 (95% CI 1.4–5.0), p = 0.0018). Among patients with elevated hs-cTnT, mortality rates were almost three-times higher in patients with increased compared to those with normal copeptin levels (29.0% vs. 10.7%, p < 0.001). Taking these results into account we propose a simple risk stratification model based on admission levels of hs-cTnI and copeptin with the high-risk group constituting patients with an increase of both biomarkers and the low-risk group constituting the rest of patients. A similar biomarker guided model has been suggested for risk stratification in patients with normotensive pulmonary embolism, which is based on the measurement of cardiac troponin, Nt-proBNP and copeptin [25]. Other authors have also underlined the diagnostic and prognostic value of a dual marker strategy by measuring both copeptin and high-sensitive cardiac troponin in patients with suspected myocardial infarction [26–32]. The clinical relevance of cardiovascular biomarker testing in patients with COVID-19 has been discussed extensively in recent months. A recently published paper by the ESC Study Group on Biomarkers in Cardiology of the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association underlined the prognostic information gained by cardiovascular biomarker measurement—mainly cardiac troponin, natriuretic peptides and d-dimer—which in conjunction with vital parameters may help treating physicians to identify patients at risk of deterioration. Our study proposes an improvement of outcome prediction by the addition of copeptin to hs-cTnI, which may ultimately help decision making in the emergency department [33].\n\nThis prospective single-center study has several limitations that require further discussion. Since only patients admitted for in-hospital treatment were included, no extrapolation can be made to patients being discharged from the emergency department. The decision for hospital admission was made by the treating physician based on clinical examination and diagnostic work-up. Second, before recommending the combination of increased copeptin and hs-cTnI as a robust predictor of worse outcome in COVID-19, it should be validated in an independent population. Third, we used baseline levels of copeptin and hs-cTnI and hence cannot draw conclusions as to how temporal changes of both biomarkers may affect the outcome. Fourth, a small number of patients had missing values for the calculation of the ISARIC 4C clinical deterioration score (as specified above), which were substituted by the median values of respective parameters alongside confirming our results by multiple imputation and by omitting patients with missing values. However, since only a couple of data points were missing this should not have a significant effect on our findings. Fifth, since this is a single-center study external validation of our results has to be done before recommendations for routine clinical practice can be made. We also have to consider that only hs-cTnI assays were used in our study and we cannot reliably extrapolate our findings to other troponin assays (e.g. commonly used hs-cTnT assay). Reported turn-times of hs-cTnI and SARS-CoV-PCR should be considered with the knowledge that preliminary results before final validation by a laboratory physician can be accessed by the treating physician and may have an impact on decision made in the emergency department. Measurement of copeptin levels also depends on the availability of appropriate laboratory equipment, which may limit its use in some hospitals. Finally, we only report short-term event rates in our study population and therefore cannot assess the prognostic impact on long-term outcomes."
