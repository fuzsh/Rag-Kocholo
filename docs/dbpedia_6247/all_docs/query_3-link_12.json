Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Leicester is essentially constant during the winter, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 9, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on October 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in Leicester\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in LeicesterDecJanFeb0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%FallSpringDec 10%Dec 10%Feb 280%Feb 280%Jan 10%Jan 10%Feb 10%Feb 10%drydry\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Leicester is essentially constant during the winter, remaining within 0.7 miles per hour of 12.6 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on January 6, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 13.3 miles per hour, while on July 26, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 9.5 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during the winter is 13.3 miles per hour on January 6.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in Leicester\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in LeicesterDecJanFeb0 mph0 mph5 mph5 mph10 mph10 mph15 mph15 mph20 mph20 mphFallSpringJan 613.3 mphJan 613.3 mphDec 112.0 mphDec 112.0 mphFeb 2812.4 mphFeb 2812.4 mphFeb 112.9 mphFeb 112.9 mph\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Leicester throughout the winter is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 41% on December 24.\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in Leicester\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in LeicesterDecJanFeb0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%FallSpringwestsouthnortheast\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nWater Temperature\n\nLeicester is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake).

In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Leicester are very rapidly decreasing during the winter, decreasing by 1,555Â°F, from 1,564Â°F to 9Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in Leicester\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in LeicesterDecJanFeb0Â°F0Â°F200Â°F200Â°F400Â°F400Â°F600Â°F600Â°F800Â°F800Â°F1,000Â°F1,000Â°F1,200Â°F1,200Â°F1,400Â°F1,400Â°F1,600Â°F1,600Â°F1,800Â°F1,800Â°FFallSpringDec 11,564Â°FDec 11,564Â°FFeb 289Â°FFeb 289Â°F\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Leicester is increasing during the winter, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 0.7 kWh to 2.0 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nThe lowest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during the winter is 0.5 kWh on December 25.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in Leicester\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in LeicesterDecJanFeb0.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.5 kWh0.5 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.5 kWh1.5 kWh2.0 kWh2.0 kWh2.5 kWh2.5 kWh3.0 kWh3.0 kWh3.5 kWh3.5 kWh4.0 kWh4.0 kWh4.5 kWh4.5 kWh5.0 kWh5.0 kWhFallSpringDec 250.5 kWhDec 250.5 kWhDec 10.7 kWhDec 10.7 kWhFeb 282.0 kWhFeb 282.0 kWhFeb 11.0 kWhFeb 11.0 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Leicester are 52.639 deg latitude, -1.132 deg longitude, and 213 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Leicester contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 167 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 228 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,043 feet). Within 50 miles also contains very significant variations in elevation (1,722 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Leicester is covered by artificial surfaces (99%), within 10 miles by cropland (45%) and grassland (30%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and grassland (23%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Leicester, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Leicester.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Leicester according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Leicester is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Leicester and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nEast Midlands Airport (EGNX, 50%, 16 mi, northwest, 92 ft elevation change)\n\nRAF Cottesmore (EGXJ, 30%, 21 mi, east, 246 ft elevation change)\n\nBirmingham Airport (EGBB, 20%, 29 mi, southwest, 112 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Leicester and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
