COMTES de COMMINGES\n\nThe county of Comminges was originally part of the duchy/county of Gascony and covered the diocesis of the same name (except for the part included in the county of Aure) as well as the diocesis of Couserans . Jaurgain traces their supposed descent from Aznar Sancho Duke of Gascony . However, he reconstructs the line based mainly on patronymics and it appears to be unsupported by other primary source evidence. If the line of descent is correct, the counts recognised the suzerainty of Raoul King of France in 932. They were later independent until the 13th century. Bernard V Comte de Comminges swore allegiance to Louis VIII King of France in Aug 1226, but 18 Nov 1244 recognised the suzerainty of the comte de Toulouse in respect of all his possessions in Comminges and Couserans . Higounet highlights that the comtes de Comminges granted the title comte to younger sons, who ruled over only a small part of the county, which has complicated the reconstruction of the genealogy of the family.\n\nA. COMTES de COMMINGES\n\n1.AZNAR [III], son of [LOUP Aznar [Comte de Comminges] & his wife ---] (-[940]) . Jaurgain states that \"Loup Aznar comte de Comminges\" was the father of \"Aznar III\" but does not cite the primary source on which this is based . \"Vicecomes Asnarius\" founded the monastery of Peyrissas, on returning from pilgrimage to Rome, and placed it under the protection of \"comiti Comunensis\", by charter dated to [915] . \"Vicecomes Asnarius\" founded the monastery of Peyrissas, on returning from pilgrimage to Rome, and placed it under the protection of \"comiti Comunensis\", dated to [915] (by Jaurgain), as recorded in a charter of the abbey of Lézat dated to [1075] . [Comte de Comminges].\n\nThe connection between the following family group and the comtes de Comminges has not yet been established.\n\n1.BERNARD ODON (-before [1075]). Comte [de Comminges]. A charter of the abbey of Lézat dated to [1075], which records the foundation of the monastery of Peyrissas, states that \"mortuo comite Convenarum, surrexit Bernardus-Oddo filius eius\" who offered \"filium suum Rogerium\" as a monk, and that the latter became abbot after the death of his father, subscribed by \"Rogerii abbatis et fratrum eius comitem Raimundi-Bernardi et Bernardi patris Raimundi \" . m ---. The name of Bernard Odon´s wife is not known. Bernard Odon & his wife had two children:\n\na)RAYMOND BERNARD . A charter of the abbey of Lézat dated to [1075], which records the foundation of the monastery of Peyrissas, states that \"mortuo comite Convenarum, surrexit Bernardus-Oddo filius eius\" who offered \"filium suum Rogerium\" as a monk, and that the latter became abbot after the death of his father, subscribed by \"Rogerii abbatis et fratrum eius comitem Raimundi-Bernardi et Bernardi patris Raimundi \" . Comte [de Comminges].\n\nb)ROGER . A charter of the abbey of Lézat dated to [1075], which records the foundation of the monastery of Peyrissas, states that \"mortuo comite Convenarum, surrexit Bernardus-Oddo filius eius\" who offered \"filium suum Rogerium\" as a monk, and that the latter became abbot after the death of his father, subscribed by \"Rogerii abbatis et fratrum eius comitem Raimundi-Bernardi et Bernardi patris Raimundi \" . Abbot of Peyrissas.\n\nTwo brothers, whose origin is unknown. According to Jaurgain, they were sons of Aznar [III] (see above) . Settipani highlights that the hypothesis depends on the co-identity of \"Raymundus germani mei Ludovicus, Ademarus, Garsia, Amelius, filii Enardi filii Aneri \" (who granted property to the abbey of Auch by charter dated [998] ) with \"Raymond\" son of Arnaud de Comminges. However, these supposed brothers of Raymond are not referred to in any other documents so far identified which name the sons of Arnaud de Comminges.\n\n1.ARNAUD [I] de Comminges (-before 27 Nov 957) . Comte de Comminges et de Couserans. \"Arnaldus et uxore mea Arsendis\" donated property to the abbey of Lézat by charter dated Apr 944, signed by \"Arnaldo et uxore sua Arsendis et filiis suis vel filias \" . \"Arnaldus et uxor mea Arsindis, et Rodgarius et Odo filiis nostris\" donated property to the abbey of Montolieu, near Carcassonne for the souls of \" et Rodgario fratre meo\" by charter dated 7 Apr 949 . m ([925/35]) ARSINDE, daughter of --- ([905/20]-after [959]). \"Arnaldus et uxore mea Arsendis\" donated property to the abbey of Lézat by charter dated Apr 944, signed by \"Arnaldo et uxore sua Arsendis et filiis suis vel filias \" . Her parentage is not known. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Arsinde was the daughter of Acfred Duke of Aquitaine, Comte d'Auvergne, first cousin of Acfred [II] Comte de Carcassonne. Settipani highlights that the obvious way of explaining the transmission of the county of Carcassonne to the family of the Comtes de Comminges is that she was Arsinde de Carcassonne, daughter of Acfred Comte de Carcassonne et de Razès Seigneur de Foix & his wife --- . However, the chronology is not ideal. As explained below (Part B), it is likely that her son Roger [I] Comte de Carcassonne was born in the later part of the date range [930/40]. If this is correct, it is likely that Arsinde married in [925/35] which would place her own birth in the range [905/20]. Another difficulty is that there is no indication who held the county of Carcassonne between the death of Comte Acfred [II] in [933] and the time when Arsinde's son Roger was comte, the date of which is uncertain but is unlikely to precede the 950s at the earliest. In particular, no proof has yet been found that the county was inherited by Arsinde's husband, which would have been normal if his wife had been the heiress of Carcassonne. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Arsinde was the daughter of Acfred Duke of Aquitaine. The primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. It is assumed that it is also speculative based on onomastics. A third possibility is proposed by Stasser, who suggests that she was the sister of Raymond [I] Comte de Rouergue, on the grounds that it is better supported from the onomastic point of view . \"Arnaldus et uxor mea Arsindis, et Rodgarius et Odo filiis nostris\" donated property to the abbey of Montolieu, near Carcassonne for the souls of \" et Rodgario fratre meo\" by charter dated 7 Apr 949 . \"Arsindis comitissa cum filiis suis Odo et Raimundo\" are named in a charter dated 957 , which suggests that her husband had died before that date. \"Arsendes comitissa et filius meus Rodgarius comes\" sold property to \"Gilaberto vicario\" by charter dated 29 Nov 957 . \"Arsindis comitissa cum filiis suis Odo et Raimundo\" signed a charter dated to [959] relating to their property \"alode de Magrinnano et de Cugciaco in comitatu Narbonense\" . Comte Arnaud & his wife had [five or more] children :\n\na)ROGER de Comminges ([930/40]-after Apr 1011) . \"Arnaldus et uxor mea Arsindis, et Rodgarius et Odo filiis nostris\" donated property to the abbey of Montolieu, near Carcassonne for the souls of \" et Rodgario fratre meo\" by charter dated 7 Apr 949 . His birth date range is estimated on the assumption that he and his brother were young adolescents or older children at the date of this charter. His date of death suggests that it is more likely that he was born in the later part of this range. He succeeded as Comte de Carcassonne, de Razès, de Couserans et de Comminges, Seigneur de Foix.\n\n- COMTES de CARCASSONNE.\n\nb)ODO de Comminges (-before Apr 1011). \"Arnaldus et uxor mea Arsindis, et Rodgarius et Odo filiis nostris\" donated property to the abbey of Montolieu, near Carcassonne for the souls of \" et Rodgario fratre meo\" by charter dated 7 Apr 949 . \"Arsindis comitissa cum filiis suis Odo et Raimundo\" signed a charter dated to [959] relating to their property \"alode de Magrinnano et de Cugciaco in comitatu Narbonense\" . Comte de Razès. \"Rogerius comes et conjux mea Adalaizis comitissa\" donated property to Saint-Hilaire, including property which \"frater meus Oddo comes habuit\", for the soul of \"fratris mei Oddoni comitis\" and for \"filio nostro Regimundo comite\", by charter dated Apr 1011, signed by \" Bernardus et dominus Petrus comites \" .\n\nc)RAYMOND de Comminges (-after 989). \"Arsindis comitissa cum filiis suis Odo et Raimundo\" signed a charter dated to [959] relating to their property \"alode de Magrinnano et de Cugciaco in comitatu Narbonense\" .

The name of Roger's wife is not known. Roger [I] & his wife had one child:\n\na)ARNAUD [II] de Comminges . \"Adalaiz cum Arnaldus frater Rodgarii et alius Arnaldus filius Rodgarii et Ber \" donated property to the abbey of Lagrasse for the souls of \"Rodgarii et Aimilde comitissa et alio Rodgario\" by charter dated [19 Jun 936/10 Sep 954] signed by \"Raimundi comitis, Adalaiz comitissa qui hoc fecit\" .\n\nThe primary sources which confirm the relationships between the following members of this family have not been identified, although their names suggest descent from the preceding family.\n\n1.ROGER [II] de Comminges (-after 1026). Comte de Comminges. Père Anselme notes that he was named in charters of the abbey of Lessat in 1010 and 1026 (no citation references) .\n\nTwo brothers:\n\n1.ARNAUD [III] (-after [1070]). Comte de Comminges. A charter dated to [1058] records a claim by \"Arnaldus comes\" against \"Sancti Petri Fustiniaco\", in the presence of \"Bernardi episcopi sive Bernardo fratre suo similiter episcopo\" . \"Arnaldus comes\" donated property to the abbey of Peyrissas by charter dated to [1070] . A charter dated May [1080] records that \"Arnaldus comes\" donated property to the abbey of Peyrissas which was later usurped by \"Bernardus-Arnaldi et Raimundus-Arnaldi et antecessores illorum usque in diebus Rogerii monachi\" .\n\n2.BERNARD de Comminges (-before 1060). A charter dated to [1058] records a claim by \"Arnaldus comes\" against \"Sancti Petri Fustiniaco\", in the presence of \"Bernardi episcopi sive Bernardo fratre suo similiter episcopo\" . Bishop of Comminges.\n\n[Two siblings:]\n\n1.ROGER [III] (-[after 1114]). Comte de Comminges. Père Anselme records that he was living in 1114 but does not cite the primary source on which this information is based .\n\n2. [BRUNE de Comminges . The following charter identifies Brune as the sister of \"Rogerius de Conveni\". He has not been identified beyond doubt. Roger [III] Comte de Comminges was the most recent person of that name who has been identified. The chronology does not appear ideal for his sister to have been the great-grandmother of Navarra, whose husbands death is dated to [1200]. A charter dated Nov 1197 records the 4o consanguinity between \"B. Convenarum comes\" and \"uxorem, filiam Arnaldi Willelmi de Barta\" which provided the grounds for their divorce: \"domina Bruna et Rogerius de Convenis fuerant fratres\", adding the descent from \"Bruna\" to \"Ademarus de Pontiis\" to \"alia Bruna\" to \"Navarra\" to \"Comtors filia Arnaldi Willelmi de Barta\" . m --- Seigneur de Pontis, son of ---.

Their parents have not been identified, other than the charter dated 1197 quoted below which indicates that Bernard [I] was the son of Rogerius de Convenis. As indicated above, that person could be identified as Roger [III] Comte de Comminges, although the chronology is not ideal. Documents relating to the Pedro II King of Aragon/Marie de Montpellier divorce indicate that Bernard [IV] Comte de Comminges was descended in the female line from the Comtes de Bourgogne: a charter dated 28 Jan 1211 (O.S.) records various testimonies, including Dominus B. de Andusia who swore that comes Raimundus de Bezanzo [presumably Renaud I Comte de Bourgogne, see the document BURGUNDY KINGDOM - COUNTS of BURGUNDY] had duas filias [apparently incorrect], from one of whom issued (exivit) mater huius B. de Andusia et avia Bernardi de Cumenge and that from alia que vocabatur ducissa [Mathilde wife of Guillaume [VII] Seigneur de Montpellier, who was daughter of Hugues II Duke of Burgundy, son of Sibylle de Bourgogne-Comté who was daughter of Guillaume I Comte de Bourgogne, son of Renaud I] issued (exivit) pater Marie regine and he believed that Marie regina was uxor Bernardi de Cumenge who had ex ea filium et filias . Unfortunately, this does not bring us much further forward. Looking at the grandmothers of Bernard [IV], his maternal grandmother was either the unnamed mistress of Alphonse Jourdain Comte de Toulouse or his wife Faydive [dUzès] (depending whether Bernard [IV]s mother was Alphonses illegitimate or legitimate daughter), while his paternal grandmother was Dias de Samatan (see below). No relationship has been traced between any of these individuals and the Anduze family, or any descent of the Anduze or Comminges families from either the ducal or comital families of Burgundy.\n\n1.BERNARD [I] (-killed in battle Saint-Gaudens [after 1145]) . A charter dated 1197 records the 4o consanguinity between \"B. Convenarum comes\" and \"uxorem, filiam Arnaldi Willelmi de Barta\" which provided the grounds for their divorce: \"domina Bruna et Rogerius de Convenis fuerant fratres\", adding the descent \"Rogerio de Convenis\" to \"B. comes...Bernardo\" to \"Dodo comes\" to \"iste B. comes\" . Comte de Comminges. He was mortally wounded at the battle of Saint-Gaudens . m DIAS de Samatan, daughter and heiress of GODEFROI Seigneur de Samatan et de Muret & his wife ---. Her marriage and parentage are confirmed by the marriage contract dated 26 Apr 1139 under which \"Bernardus de Comenge et uxor mea Dias et filii nostri Bernardus de Comenge et Rogerius et Dodo de Samatano\" granted property to \"Bernardae filiae nostrae et viro tuo Rogerio de Biterri\", which also names \"Godafredus de Murello pater meus Petrus Raymundi\" as previous owners of \"castrum de Murello\" which he granted to \"predictæ Dias filiæ meæ et viro suo Bernardo de Comenge\" . As noted in the introduction to this section, there is some possibility that Dias was related either to the ducal of comital family of Burgundy.

Her supposed first marriage is deduced from Roger of Hoveden who names her supposed husband \"Petrus vicecomes Akensis et comes Bigorniæ\" when recording the capitulation of the town of Dax in 1177 .

Europäische Stammtafeln records her parentage and marriage . Père Anselme, on the other hand, records that Guy de Comminges married Marguerite de lIsle-Jourdain, dame en partie de Lombières, daughter of Jourdain [IV] de lIsle-Jourdain by his first wife Faydide  (whom other sources indicate was the wife of Jourdain de lIsle-Jourdain, by whom she had Jourdain [V], see the document GASCONY CENTRAL), adding that Guy sen portoit héritier pour la cinquième partie du château de Lombieres, which was confirmed to him by judgments dated 12 Jun 1320 and 23 Jun 1328 . This suggested parentage is evidently incorrect considering the chronology of the Comminges and Isle-Jourdain families. In addition, Marguerite inevitably derived her rights to Lombers from the Adhémar family. It should also be noted that Jourdain [IV] de lIsle-Jourdain married Marguerites paternal aunt Vacquerie and that Père Anselme records that Vacqueries daughters sued Guy de Comminges in 1320, presumably as widower of Marguerite and relating to the Lombers/Adémar inheritance (although Anselme does not specify that) .

The marriage contract between \"Ranimirus prolis Sanctioni regis\" and \"Gilberga filiam comitis Bernardi-Rodegari et comitissæ matris eius Garsinde\" is dated 22 Aug 1036 and lists her dowry as \"castellum Atheres\", judged spurious by the Histoire Générale de Languedoc .

[ETIENNETTE (-after 1066) . \"Garsea rex, Sancionis regis filius cum coniuge mea domina Stefania regina\" granted two monasteries to abbot Gómez of Yábar by charter dated 1040 . The primary source which confirms her parentage has not yet been identified. According to Marca, \"les mémoires du convent de Nagara\" state that she was \"fille du comte de Foix\", but he does not provide a direct quote or source reference . The Histoire Générale de Languedoc refers to a marriage contract (again, no quote or source reference) dated 1036, but this is not reproduced by Marca . This is all too vague to show Stephanie´s origin other than in square brackets in this document, until more precise information comes to light. Salazar y Acha suggests that Stephanie was a widow when she married King García, and the mother of a daughter Constanza who married her [second] husband´s illegitimate son Sancho (see below) . Firstly, he says that this would explain Stephanie´s presence in Barcelona when she married, which is confirmed by the charter dated 1038 from San Juan de la Peña which names her for the first time with King García and records that he fetched her in Barcelona . Secondly, it would explain the charter dated 29 Nov 1074 under which her son Sancho IV King of Navarre granted unas casas en la ciudad de Calahorra to germano meo domno Sancio et uxori vestra vel germana mea domna Constanza , the reference to his sister-in-law as germana mea being unusual if she was not also his own sister. Thirdly, it accords with the narrative in the Crónica Najerense which recounts that infans domnus Sancius, quem rex Garsias Pampilonensium ex concubina habuerat abducted filiam regine Stephanie, who was betrothed to Santius rex, and took her to the court of the Moorish king of Zaragoza and later to Ramiro I King of Aragon, triggering the war between Castille and Aragon in the course of which the Aragonese king was killed in 1064 . Salazar y Acha speculates that Stephanie´s first husband was an otherwise unidentified son of Bernardo [I] Conde de Besalú (whose possible sister was named Constanza) but this is only one of the possibilities. However, Salazar y Acha´s hypothesis, although appealing, appears unlikely to be correct because Queen Estefania does not include Constanza in her testament dated to [1066] which names all her other known children . \"Garsea rex cum mulier mea Stephania regina\" confirmed the resettlement of Villanova de Pampaneto by charter dated 1 Jan 1044 . \"Stephanie coniugis\" is named in the charter of \"Garsia rex, Sancii regis filius\" dated 2 Dec 1052 .

Salazar y Acha discusses her possible parentage, her possible betrothal and her marriage . The Crónica Najerense records that infans domnus Sancius, quem rex Garsias Pampilonensium ex concubina habuerat abducted filiam regine Stephanie, who was betrothed to Santius rex, and took her to the court of the Moorish king of Zaragoza and later to Ramiro I King of Aragon, triggering the war between Castille and Aragon during the course of which the Aragonese king was killed in 1064 . Salazar y Acha hypothesises that this alleged daughter of Stephanie de Foix, wife of García V King of Navarre, was Constanza, born from an otherwise unrecorded earlier marriage with a noble at the court of Barcelona . He cites the charter dated 29 Nov 1074 under which Sancho IV King of Navarre granted unas casas en la ciudad de Calahorra to germano meo domno Sancio et uxori vestra vel germana mea domna Constanza , suggesting that it would be unusual for King Sancho to refer to his brother´s wife as germana unless there was also a blood relationship between them. However, Salazar y Acha´s hypothesis, although appealing, appears unlikely to be correct because Queen Estefania does not include Constanza in her testament dated to [1066] which names all her other known children .

No direct evidence has been found which proves this supposed first marriage of Comte Roger [III]. However, the date of the marriage of his daughter Bradimene appears inconsistent with her having been the daughter of his wife Jimena de Barcelona.]\n\nm [secondly] (before [8 Jul] 1130) JIMENA de Barcelona, daughter of RAMON BERENGUER [III] Conde de Barcelona & his [third wife Dulce Ctss de Provence] ([1117/18]-after 1136). The testament of \"Raimundus Berengarii Barchinonensis comes et marchio\" dated [8 Jul] 1130 names \"Raimundo Berengarii filio meo et filie mee ipsa de Castella et illa de Fuxo\" . Her name is more recognisably reproduced in the charter dated Nov 1149 of her son \"Roggerus-Bernardi comes Fuxensis, filius Roggerii et Xaminiæ\" . In most secondary sources, Jimena is shown as the daughter of her father´s first marriage and widow of Bernat [III] Conde de Besalú. However, no primary source has yet been identified which confirms that this is correct and several reasons point to it being unlikely. Firstly, if Jimena had been the widow of the last comte de Besalú, her second husband would presumably have had the right to claim the county in her name, and there appears to be no indication that he ever did this. Secondly, the testament of her father names \"filie mee illa de Fuxo\" after his daughter \"ipsa de Castella\". This would normally indicate that the former was younger than the latter. The only possible reason for reversing the order of his daughters would have been the supposed precedence of the queen of Castile over the comtesse de Foix. However, no other example of this adjustment to the order of names in primary source documents has been found, except those justified by the supposed precedence of children holding ecclesiastical office over lay children. Thirdly, Jimena would have named her daughter after her own mother. Fourthly, the dates of marriage of Jimena´s two known children, in the 1150s, suggest that they were born in the 1130s, which is not inconsistent with Jimena having been born from her father´s third marriage. This appears to be corroborated by the charter dated 26 Oct 1136 by which Rogerius comes Fuxensis [et] Essena coniux ipsius founded the commanderie of Ville-Dieu which refers to \"infantes nostros\" . The date of the marriage of Comte Roger´s daughter Bradimène is inconsistent with this hypothesis, unless she was born from an otherwise unrecorded earlier marriage, or was illegitimate, as is proposed below. The only factor which appears to indicate the co-identity of the two daughters is that Jimena could have been named after her maternal grandmother, mother of her father´s first wife. However, the name was not uncommon in Spain at the time, and it is quite possible that Jimena was named after another relative. Until further primary source data emerges which contradicts this hypothesis, it has been decided to show Jimena has her father´s daughter by his third marriage in this document.\n\nComte Roger [III] & his [first] wife had one child:\n\n1.BRADIMENE de Foix . Rogerius comes Fuxensis donated property to filia meæ Braidimendæ et marito suo Guillelmo de Alona by charter dated Mar 1131 . As noted above, the date of this marriage appears inconsistent with Bradimène having been the daughter of Roger [III]´s wife Jimena de Barcelona, especially noting the date of the marriage of his younger daughter. Another possibility is that Bradimène was Comte Roger´s illegitimate daughter. m (Mar 1131) GUILLAUME d'Aniort Seigneur de Niort {Niort-de-Sault, Aude} Vicomte de Sault, son of ---.\n\nComte Roger [III] & his [second] wife had two children:\n\n2.ROGER BERNARD [I] \"le Gros\" de Foix (-Nov 1188) . \"Roggerus-Bernardi comes Fuxensis, filius Roggerii et Xaminiæ\" shared property with the abbey of Saint Antonin de Pamiers by charter dated 1149 which names \"avum meum Roggerium\" by charter dated Nov 1149 .
