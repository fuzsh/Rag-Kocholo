        "text": "On May 3, 1507, Germaine de Foix would finally give birth to the son that her husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon wanted to avoid Aragon from falling to Philip IV of Burgundy and Joanna I of Castileâ€™s rule, the child would be named and baptized as John or John, Prince of Girona.\n\nOn 1516, Ferdinand of Aragon would die leaving the throne of Aragon to his nine-year-old heir, John III of Aragon with his mother, Germaine de Foix as his own regent although Aragon would be vulnerable against the French and the Habsburgs themselves, she would arrange a betrothal between him and his niece, Catherine of Austria to make peace with Holy Roman Emperors Maximilian and his son, Philip II as well as the prince of Asturias, Charles.\n\nA marriage arrangement between Joanna of Naples and Henry VII would be made on 1504, although she would give birth to a daughter name Joanna on May 10, 1505, despite of their marriage lasting up to 1532, on the death of Henry VIII on 1532, on 1508, Philip II of Burgundy and Maximilian I would start to pay the dowry of Eleanor of Austria and send her to England, this would mean that Catherine of Aragon would now need to return home to Ferdinand of Aragon just to see her father now having a son and heir separating Aragon from Castile in 1508, on 1512, Eleanor of Austria and Henry, Prince of Wales are now married.\n\nOn May 10, 1505, Margaret, Dowager Duchess of Savoy would give birth to a son, a heir to Savoy named Philip, making her the regent to Savoy and she would remarry to Charles, the previous heir of her husband and that marriage would give birth to a daughter named Beatrice (June 2, 1508)\n\nOn his return to the Burgundian estates on 1508, Philip IV of Burgundy would establish Ferdinand, his second son as his own heir while having Charles given to his mother to be the heir to Castile as the Prince of Asturias and the betrothal of their other daughter, Isabel to John of Portugal be made, the birth of John, Prince of Girona would mean that they would no longer inherit Aragon if John, Prince of Girona lives.\n\nJoanna and Philip would have two more children, Anna(May 10, 1509) and Agnes(June 4, 1512), Joanna I of Castile would die on 1512 after giving birth to Agnes due to the effects of her frequent pregnancies, giving the throne to Charles I of Castile, her Habsburg son who is just 12 years of age and he would remarry to Catherine of Aragon, a marriage that he would easily have the dispensation made and their marriage would produce a daughter named Beatrice on February 10, 1516.\n\nOn 1519, Philip IV of Burgundy would start to reign as Emperor with his second wife Catherine of Aragon.\n\nOn October 25, 1510, Louis XII would be overjoyed by a birth of a son and he would be happy that a son has been born that is named as Charles after his father, and Anne of Brittany would be weakened and on 1514, in Blois, Anne of Brittany would die and Louis XII would take the much younger Catherine of Navarre as his bride, she is nineteen years old and two decades younger than his previous bride, this was due to her mother wanting a close relationship between France and Navarre.\n\nThe marriage of Catherine of Navarre and Louis XII would produce a single daughter named Renee(May 10, 1516)."
