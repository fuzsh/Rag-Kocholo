        "text": "Their notoriety as an exciting country music trio on the rise with plenty of chart-topping potential ahead of them is coming to an end.\n\nBut you won’t find Kimberly, Reid and Neil Perry crying in their beers about the demise of The Band Perry as a pure country group. That’s because their plan to morph into something other than a popular country band is paying off.\n\nThe Mississippi-born, Tennessee-bred Perrys are gradually seeing the band’s decision to switch musical genres and become a pop music act is catching on.\n\nMore: Camden's Connect the Lots 2019 season offers outdoor fitness, festivals and music\n\nMore: It's a jam-packed Mother's Day weekend of fun in South Jersey\n\nMore: Cher tour 2019: Setlist, review & a second chance to see her in Philly\n\nThe truth is, despite a life filled with music – Reid and Neil were 10 and 8 respectively when they were roadies for their teenage sister’s band – and in spite of their southern roots, the Perrys never considered themselves a country band.\n\nFor that matter, they never really hung a particular label on their sound, even though there was no mistaking some Nashville country licks in their tunes.\n\nToday, The Band Perry is on the second leg of a national tour behind last September’s release of their first-ever, non-country, five-song EP titled “Coordinates.”\n\nListen to their current sound, compare it to the (country) music they began recording a decade ago, and there’s no mistaking The Band Perry has strayed from their original musical genre. They’ve crafted a more blended sound that’s definitely pop, but has a few other elements flowing through the charts as well.\n\nNeil Perry doesn’t deny that a discerning ear can pick out traces of country. But there are also other sounds that come into play with the new direction, including rock ‘n roll, some rhythm and blues and some plain old pop.\n\nThat’s because they never go into a studio to record one particular style.\n\n“When we go in and we start writing music, we’re not really thinking of what genres are gonna come out on the other end. We just start writing songs and start producing,” says Neil Perry, 28, who plays mandolin and bouzouki. Together with his 30-year-old bass-playing brother Reid, they also provide the background vocals to 35-year-old Kimberly’s lead vocals.\n\nThey’re currently on the second leg of a national tour in support of last September’s release of their first non-country, five-song EP titled “Coordinates.”\n\nHear the new sound and judge for yourself when The Band Perry performs at 8 p.m. Friday during its debut in Sound Waves, the smaller of the two main entertainment venues at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City.\n\nIn addition to traveling with their sister’s band as roadies when they were in grade school, they also began learning to play instruments and developed their own style.\n\nThey were so adept at mastering the instruments that even while they were Kimberly’s roadies, they also got some stage time by opening her shows using the name Mobile Music Machines\n\nWhen their sister’s band split up, the boys teamed up with Kimberly in 2005 to form The Band Perry. Four years later, they signed their first recording contract in 2009.\n\nThey figured what happened to Kimberly – her band gradually splitting up – couldn’t happen to them because they shared a bond even stronger than their music.\n\nThey shared blood. Any band can break up; splitting up a family, though, is a whole different story, Neil Perry said.\n\nAlthough they switched from one recording label to another in order to have more control over their material, the Perrys eventually went the independent route.\n\nIn 2017, they announced their change in musical genres from country to more of a pop format and began working on the EP “Coordinates.” Released in September, the album peaked at 42 on Billboard’s U.S. Independent chart, a decent showing considering they were now an indie band and had done a 180 degree switch with their sound.\n\nIn addition to reinventing their music, there’s also the equally important matter of writing lyrics which, if penned properly, can tell more than just one story.\n\n“I don’t know that you can really say lyrics only mean one thing. I think one of the really great things is that people can take away (from a song) whatever they want to, and I guess that’s the same thing with genres as well,” Perry says during a recent phone call from their tour bus as they made their way to a gig in Mississippi last week.\n\n“If people hear a little bit of country in the new music, that’s great. If they heard a little bit of rock in the new music, that’s great, too. But I don’t think we go in (to the studio) thinking about what genre we want it to fit into anymore,” Perry continues. “We may have used to, but I think at this point for us it’s really freeing and exciting for us to just go in (to a studio) and create (music) without any kind of a box around what kind of music we can use and what we can’t use.”\n\nThe Band Perry performs in Sound Waves at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Friday, May 10 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $40 to $89, available through ticketmaster.com or (800) 736-1420.\n\nAround town\n\nThe Whispers, the R & B group that first hit the top of the charts 50 years ago, return to the Boardwalk with their Say Yes Tour Friday at 9 p.m. Tickets are $65, $75 and $85, available at ticketmaster.com or (800) 736-1420.\n\nCountry music superstar Kenny Chesney performs at Hard Rock Live in the Etess Arena Saturday at 7 p.m. Tickets range from $205 to $400+, available at ticketmaster.com or (800) 736-1420.\n\nMaze featuring Frankie Beverly headlines the annual Mother’s Day Music Festival at Jim Whelan Boardwalk Hall Saturday at 7 p.m. Tickets are $57, $67, $82, available at ticketmaster.com or (800) 736-1420.\n\nThe R & B group After 7 teams up with the R & B group Dru Hill in the Tropicana Showroom Sunday at 6 p.m. Tickets are $58, $68 and $83, available at ticketmaster.com or (800) 736-1420.\n\nMore from South Jersey\n\nMore: These South Jersey restaurants want to celebrate your Mom\n\nMore: Think New Jersey makes good wine?
