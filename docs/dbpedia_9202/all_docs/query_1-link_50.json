        "text": "Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, often known simply as Percival de Rolo or Percy, is a human gunslinger member of Vox Machina and the father of firearms in the world of Exandria. He is played by Taliesin Jaffe.\n\nPercy's family once ruled the city of Whitestone, but when he was young, they were overthrown and murdered by the Briarwoods, Anna Ripley and their allies. Percy fled, his hair turning white from the trauma, and he wandered aimlessly for several years. He was eventually visited in dreams by the shadow demon Orthax who gave him the knowledge to build the very first firearm in existence, The List.\n\nDuring his travels with Vox Machina, Percy reunited with his sister Cassandra and took back Whitestone. He acquired the magical cape Cabal's Ruin to aid in the fight against the Chroma Conclave and helped carve the Prime Trammels with knowledge from Ioun to take down Vecna. He married Vex'ahlia, and the two of them settled in Whitestone where they had five children. His invention of firearms revolutionized warfare throughout Tal'Dorei and eventually all of Exandria.\n\nIntro[]\n\n\"Percy was the third child of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism.\n\nOne day, a mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court. During a feast held in their honour, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way.\n\nPercy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible.\n\nThen one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.\"[31]\n\nDescription[]\n\nAppearance[]\n\nPercy in the first campaign is a young human in his early twenties.[32] He originally had brown hair, but it turned white as a result of the trauma he suffered after the Briarwoods killed his family.[33] He wears distinctive, double-lensed glasses. Percy is either nearsighted[34] or far-sighted.[35]\n\nAfter joining the Slayer's Take, Percy has the brand of the guild on his right arm.\n\nIn 843 PD, when he was met by Bells Hells while in his fifties, his white hair was somewhat tousled and he wore a long dark blue and gray day coat hanging to below his knees. He appeared slightly unshaven. He walked using a cane.[36]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nCompared to his fellow party members, Percy is rather quiet, usually only speaking when necessary. However, he has shown he can be quite persuasive in social situations and is somewhat of a tactician within the group, as seen in \"The Temple Showdown\" (1x11).[37] Despite his prim and conscientious exterior, however, Percy has shown himself on multiple occasions to hold the signature eccentricity of a tinkerer, as displayed in escapades such as the cannonball contest.\n\nHaving experienced both the pinnacle of entitlement and the depths of poverty, Percy displays a wisdom and self-awareness beyond his years, especially in regard to social status. He indicates a particular fondness for unceremoniously dethroning other, snobbier nobility with a combination of his own title and a biting wit. Percy thinks of himself as being the only one capable of making adult decisions, despite his young age. He is also very pragmatic, with a consistent belief that the ends justify the means. This has led to moments of conflict between him and the party.[38]\n\nPercy's desire for revenge was consciously monstrous. He was fully aware of the consequences of building the first firearm: he knew that the technology would escape his grasp and kill thousands of people in his lifetime, but he was willing to accept that to help him get revenge on several specific people.[39] Thankfully, he grew beyond this mindset, even to the point of forgiving the individual who hurt him the most deeply. Despite this, decades later he sometimes feels regret and punishes himself for his past mistakes.[40]\n\nPercy's attitude was molded by the severe physical and emotional trauma he endured at the hands of the Briarwoods and Dr. Ripley, displaying a cynical, detached, and self-deprecating behavior. He responds poorly to compliments on his character, and his lack of self-respect is shown most clearly in the preferences he mentions for how his corpse should be handled in the letter that he composed for Vox Machina in the event of his demise.[41] The experience of being possessed by Orthax made Percy averse to doing magic and suspicious of anything else that functioned in a way he didn't understand.[42]\n\nBiography[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nPercy was born in Whitestone, where his branch of the de Rolo family ruled, and was raised alongside his six siblings. Five years before the campaign began, his family hosted guests: the Briarwoods. The couple initiated a coup and seized control of Whitestone, murdering the entire De Rolo family and those loyal to them. Percy was taken prisoner and tortured by Anna Ripley, one of the Briarwoods' allies. Percy's youngest sister and only surviving family, Cassandra, managed to free him, and they attempted to flee Whitestone together. However, she was hit by several arrows in their escape, and Percy fled on his own by jumping into a river, believing her to be dead. His hair went white while he was unconscious in the river. Afterwards, he wandered aimlessly, working on a fishing boat, the Cold Comfort, for about a year. He took a series of odd jobs before spending several months working at a stable outside Stilben.[43] One night, he had a dream in which a smoke-like entity offered him the means to get revenge for his family. Percy thereafter constructed his first gun, the List. He tracked Dr. Ripley for a year until he finally found her, but he was captured by her guards before being able to attack her and imprisoned in a jail cell.[44][45]\n\nBecause he is a gunslinger, Percy is the main long-ranged attack member of Vox Machina. He previously fought with his two guns, \"The List\", a six-barrel pepper-box, and \"Bad News\", a sniper rifle-esque device. The List has since been destroyed, and Percy has acquired two new weapons, both from Dr. Ripley: a four-shot pistol which he called \"Retort\", and another pepperbox known as \"Animus\". He also has experience in using melee weapons, usually a rapier or a longsword.\n\nPercy is also a tinkerer, creating and modifying items to give both himself and his teammates an edge in battle. He creates explosive and utility arrows for Vex'ahlia, as well as crafting his own ammunition and even weapons, such as his Diplomacy electroshock glove.\n\nVox Machina Origins[]\n\nSeries II\n\nIn the comic book adaptation of pre-stream events, Percy first appeared as he was being held in a prison cell in the Umbra Hills, falsely accused of being a cult leader and of the attempted murder of Dr. Ripley with the use of a demonic weapon.[46] Percy was freed by Scanlan, Pike, and Keyleth who were in the area to look for help to save their friend, Grog. Percy helped them acquire the skull of a Nightmare, then chose to follow them back to Westruun, where he helped them complete an arcane ritual.\n\nSeries III\n\nPercy stuck with the group, now called Vox Machina. With them, he participated in an underground fighting ring in Westruun, and faced the white dragon Skysunder.\n\nThe Story of Vox Machina and other pre-stream events[]\n\nPercy stated several times that upon meeting Vex'ahlia, he gave her all his money.[47][48] At some point, Percy spent several months designing and making a bomb for Scanlan to use.[49] He also once had to be a lawyer for Keyleth when she was thrown into prison.[50] He did so well that he (along with Scanlan in his Burt Reynolds, Esq. persona) is considered to be the unofficial lawyer for the group.[51][52][53] Another one of his early accomplishments was to castrate a troll with a well-aimed shot.[54]\n\nPercy constructed Bad News over the course of five months, most likely while Greyskull Keep was under construction.[55]\n\nIn \"CelebriD&D with Joe Manganiello\", Percy was hired along with Keyleth and some other mercenaries by Arkhan, a paladin of Tiamat. The group investigated the Vault of Shumas in the Aggrad Mountains of Marquet, where they discovered the Wreath of the Prism.\n\nCampaign One: Vox Machina[]\n\nCampaign Three: Bells Hells[]\n\nWhen Bells Hells visited Whitestone in 843 PD with the intention of resurrecting Laudna, Keyleth, who had brought them there, led them to Percival to discuss it. Lord de Rolo was very serious and formal during the meeting (except when he allowed his youngest daughter to stay and read a book), and redirected the adventurers to Pike Trickfoot, since he didn't have healing abilities. However, when it was revealed that the soul of Delilah Briarwood was attached to Laudna's, he refused to participate further, determined to protect his home, family and legacy from such a woman. In a private conversation with Ashton Greymoore he sympathized (slightly) with their difficulties, agreeing that they could try to find a way to get Laudna back without bringing Delilah with her, and making it clear that he would not allow the dead wizard to walk Exandria again.[71] Vex'ahlia apologized for his behavior, saying that he was \"a complicated man\" who carried a lot of trauma from suffering at the hands of Delilah.\n\nWhen Bells Hells succeeded in separating the spirits of Laudna and Delilah and brought Laudna back to life in Pike Trickfoot's cottage, they left the cottage to find Percival with Bad News and dozens of Whitestone Rifle Corps and Pale Guard. Vex'ahlia reassured him that all was well and they stood down. He greeted Laudna and apologized to her on behalf of the de Rolos for what had befallen her at the hands of the Briarwoods. At dinner that night, Fearne asked Percy for a small gun for her monkey to shoot flaming poop pellets with and to everyone's surprise received one of his children's old pop guns. She promised not to load it with real ammunition. When the party showed him the residuum found at Paragon's Call, Percy said they'd been aware of some missing shipments for some time, and had been trying to pinpoint who was involved, hoping that it was not the Cerberus Assembly. Percival kept most of the residuum but returned a small amount to Bells Hells. When he retired to bed, Vex'ahlia lingered to apologize once more for his behavior.[72]\n\nWeeks later Bells Hells sent Dancer, Imahara Joe, and Verna the Viper to Whitestone for protection, and to ask Percy's assistance fixing the Quintessence Array (an arcane harness that used to belong to Ludinus Da'leth). Lord de Rolo agreed, calling Allura Vysoren for further support during the process, and they managed to completely repair the device (although in the process Percy and Dancer developed a mutual dislike, so they worked as far apart as they could).\n\nAfter the adventurers retrieved their harness and confirmed it was functional (Percy offered them some enchanted silverware he and his wife disliked, and Chetney drained magic from it, destroying it), the Terrible Tinkerer of Tal'Dorei agreed to allow the rest of the team to stay in Whitestone, since they couldn't return to Bassuras at the moment; however, later, he privately shared with Allura his concerns about his home and his family being vulnerable if they got too involved in the conflict with the Ruby Vanguard. Allura reassured him, explaining that, with everything that was happening in the world, no one was watching Whitestone too closely. Later, in a meeting in the war room, Percival confirmed that Bells Hells could stay to prepare for their scouting mission to Ruidus, for which the adventurers asked him for resources (although Percy did not share with them his knowledge of the Vestiges of Divergence when they asked for powerful items with which to become stronger).[73] The following day, in a meeting to discuss their plans, Percy delivered the requested materials as well as two devices of his own creation that would interfere with magical and/or mechanical creations. Later he allowed the adventurers to visit the ziggurat under the castle to try the harness there.[74] Following the emotional upheaval in Bells Hells caused by Ashton's attempt to absorb the shard of Rau'shan, Percy and Ashton met by chance outside the castle watching Gwendolyn de Rolo throwing rocks through the castle windows. When Ashton admitted he'd fucked up and wasn't sure he was worth trusting, Percival identified with his emotions. He told Ashton to do everything he could to make up for his actions and punish himself as much as he needed to, but not to drag the others down with him. Ashton thanked him for his help, telling him they owed him a favor.[75]\n\nPercy and Keyleth traveled to the Red Center, going to an encampment near the excavation site itself, with other members of the alliance against the Ruby Vanguard. It was there where Bells Hells and Allura (after a quick trip to the Feywild) met them, and Lord de Rolo explained the plan, presenting \"Butcher Wagons\" that would be covered by illusions, so that, combined with actual soldiers, would make the enemy forces think they were under attack, having targets to attack and actually wound, while the adventurers approached the excavation site without being noticed. The gunslinger was very confident about the plan, since from his point of view the smartest of their enemies were in the moon and wouldn't be there to notice the ruse.\n\nAfter the hour of preparation Lord Percival requested, the distraction began, and his wagons, turned into rhinoceros and ember rocs by Allura and Mythtaker Qi Mandozi, started moving.[76]\n\nLast years and legacy\n\nLord Percival de Rolo died at some point before 911 PD, being survived by his wife, Lady Vex'ahlia, who continued serving Whitestone for a time as Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone (her original title, before marrying Percy) and Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt. By the time of his death Lord de Rolo had become a master inventor, and his magnum opus was the Heart of Whitestone, a magnificent clock tower considered a national treasure of Tal'Dorei.[77]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nThe Briarwoods[]\n\nApproximately five years before the events of Critical Role, the Briarwoods entered Castle Whitestone as welcome guests and proceeded to slaughter the De Rolo Family and seize control of the castle and the city. Percy swore vengeance upon the Briarwoods, but the trauma left him too afraid to pursue them until the Briarwoods appeared in Emon, after which he and the rest of Vox Machina pursued them to Whitestone. Eventually, Percy succeeded in killing the Briarwoods and several of their closest allies.\n\nCassandra de Rolo[]\n\nCassandra is Percy's youngest sister. She freed him from captivity five years before the events of Critical Role and helped him escape the castle. As they fled, Cassandra was felled by arrows and Percy continued to run, convinced that she had died right there. However, she survived but eventually became a collaborator with the Briarwoods, pretending to aid Whitestone's citizen rebellions only to sabotage their plans. When Percy returned to Whitestone with Vox Machina, after killing Professor Anders, brother and sister were reunited. In the middle of their pursuit, Cassandra turned traitor on the party, declaring herself to be a Briarwood since, to her, she ceased to be a de Rolo when Percy left her for dead. But with the defeat of the Briarwoods, and the exorcism of Orthax, she came to her senses and Percy forgave her, ultimately leaving her to watch over Whitestone in his absence.\n\nAs of \"The Siege of Emon\" (1x78), Percy was terrified of Cassandra because she represented everything he'd been ignoring while he was out finding himself; he felt pangs of guilt every time he looked at her.[88]\n\nDoctor Anna Ripley[]\n\nDr. Ripley was perhaps the only person that Percy was truly afraid of. She was the one who tortured him endlessly when the Briarwoods attacked and took over the castle. Moreover, upon learning of Percy's inventions, she became obsessed with his work and desired to replicate it. She eventually succeeded, albeit at the cost of her right hand. Their next (and last) meeting occurred on the Isle of Glintshore, where she was revealed to have made a pact with the shadow demon that Percy once made a pact with, and that deadly partnership eventually led to Percy's death at their hands. She was later slain by Vox Machina and Percy was later resurrected.\n\nKeyleth[]\n\n→ Main article: Relationship between Keyleth and Percy.\n\nPercy and Keyleth have a strong friendship, despite being the polar opposite of each other. They do come to blows when it comes to methods of leadership, but they still care deeply about each other.\n\nPercy also tends to help Keyleth with some social cues, and helps manage/comfort her when drunk.\n\nKeyleth seems to value their friendship highly, becoming distraught when she thought she was being replaced by Tary as his best friend.\n\nOrthax[]\n\nOrthax is the shadow demon that Percy originally made a deal with so that the human would have the means to carry out his revenge. This eventually led to the creation of the List. Over time, when the Briarwoods returned to Percy's life, and as the Whitestone Rebellion progressed, Orthax slowly began to manipulate Percy and corrupt his will. When Cassandra betrayed the party, Orthax decided to include her name among those still on Percy's \"list\". But when Percy refused to kill his sister, Orthax manifested into a corporeal form and attacked the party. He was then defeated, but that wasn't the end of the demon as he found himself making a pact with Dr. Ripley. Together, the two eventually slew him on Glintshore and Orthax soon began feasting on his soul, only for Keyleth to sever the connection between Orthax and Animus, Ripley's pepperbox. The demon, now having no tether to the Material Plane, was forced to return to the Abyss.\n\n[]\n\n→ Main article: Relationship between Percy and Pike.\n\nPike and Percy are good friends and have the utmost respect for each other despite the latter's views on the gods. During the Whitestone Rebellion, it was Pike who managed to stem the spread of corruption within him, buying him the time that was needed to see his goal through.[90]\n\nBefore he departed for the Feywild, Percy was handed a special pendant from Pike that she had taken from her house in Westruun \"for his protection\".[91] This pendant later revived him when he was shot to death during his final encounter with Anna Ripley.[92] However, after it shattered, it was unable to save him twice, and Ripley eventually killed him again.[93] His body was later returned to Whitestone, where Pike performed a resurrection ritual that ultimately succeeded.[94]\n\nTaryon Darrington[]\n\nPercy first met Taryon in Ank'Harel the day after Scanlan left Vox Machina for the time being.[95] Despite his initial jealousy towards the artificer for his construction of Doty, the two tinkerers soon started to bond over their mutual love for inventing, with Percy being the first person that Tary ever bothered learning the name of out of everyone in Vox Machina.[96]\n\nVax'ildan[]\n\n→ Main article: Relationship between Percy and Vax'ildan.\n\nPercy and Vax'ildan are very trusting of each other, but the two passed through some time not been able to see eye-to-eye ever since Vex's death due to Percy's own negligence, as well as other events. They had a discussion and Percy told Vax that he wanted to be in the rogue's good graces again, but for the time being requested that he \"never trust him\". Eventually they came to terms with each other, Vax even telling Percy that he considers him to be his brother.\n\nVex'ahlia[]\n\n→ Main article: Relationship between Percy and Vex'ahlia.\n\nPercy and Vex once had a rather interesting rapport with each other, mostly consisting of teasing and flirtation (and most of that coming from Vex). After his resurrection, when she confessed her love for him, (by saying \"I should have told you. It's yours.\" calling back to her encounter with Saundor, where she said that her heart was someone else's), Percy's feelings for the ranger started to grow, culminating in him boldly kissing her in the woods outside Draconia after their battle with Vorugal. They have been together ever since, becoming lovers and later having eloped in the year that passed after the fall of the Chroma Conclave.[97]\n\nCharacter information[]\n\nQuests[]\n\nPercy's main goal was to avenge his family's murder at the hands of the Briarwoods, something that is now accomplished. Percy has also reunited with his sister, Cassandra.\n\nHe wanted to track down Anna Ripley, who was aiding the Briarwoods but escaped Whitestone while Vox Machina was distracted. Not only did he want revenge on her, but he also felt guilty for sparking her imagination to create firearms.[98] Before he died, Percy forgave her,[99] even after learning that she had produced multiple firearms and distributed the plans to other tinkerers.[100] Vox Machina was able to kill her afterward.[101]\n\nProficiencies[]\n\nSkills: Acrobatics, History, Perception, Persuasion[102]\n\nTools: Tinker's Tools[103]\n\nPercy's tinkered items[]\n\n\"Arrow?\" (Vex; expended against Lady Delilah Briarwood within the ziggurat)[104]\n\nBad News (himself; first used in battle in Kraghammer)[105]\n\nBomb (Scanlan; expended against gricks)[106]\n\nDiplomacy (himself; worn on left hand[107])\n\nEntanglement Arrows (Vex)\n\nExplosive Arrows (Vex)\n\nGrappling Hook Arrow (Vex)\n\nGrenade (himself; expended against Rimefang)\n\nHand Mortar (himself; currently unused)[108]\n\nHand Prosthetic with Drill Attachment (Victor; destroyed in the explosion of Victor's shop during the battle with Vecna in Vasselheim)\n\nThe List (himself; a pepperbox firearm; destroyed by Scanlan via acid pit)[109]\n\nMask (himself)\n\nRaven Skull Brooch (cast from a mold of the skull given by Keyleth; filled with sweet-smelling herbs; given to Vax'ildan)\n\nSiege Arrow (Vex)\n\nSpecial Staff (Keyleth)\n\nNotable items[]\n\nCurrent items[]\n\nAnimus (pepperbox previously owned/created by Dr. Ripley)\n\nBoots of Spider Climbing[110] (traded for Grog's Boots of Feral Leaping[111] and traded back[112])\n\nCabal's Ruin (retrieved from Anna Ripley's corpse by Vox Machina and later given to Percy[113])\n\nCincture of the Stone King (retrieved from the undead dwarf king in Thomara[114])\n\nDiplomacy (gauntlet created by Percy)\n\nDragon Slayer Longsword (retrieved from the lair of Rimefang[115])\n\nEarring of Whisper (made by Tiberius)\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring (retrieved from the lair of Rimefang[116])\n\nManners\n\nRapier +1\n\nRetort (pistol previously owned/created by Dr. Ripley)\n\nSilvered Rapier\n\nFormer items[]\n\nAmulet of the Shield (given to Lord Thunderbrand)[117]\n\nBoots of Feral Leaping (received in a trade with Grog[118] and traded back[119])\n\n\"Cloak of Smashing\" (a standard cloak; traded to Grog for a long-barreled gun[120])\n\nCraven Edge (Traded to Grog for a Dragon Slayer Longsword)\n\nHat of Disguise (retrieved from the lair of Rimefang;[121] given to Scanlan)\n\nHeadband of Initiative (given to Vex'ahlia[122])\n\nManual of Quickness of Action (read during the airship flight to Vasselheim[123]; donated to the Cobalt Vault[124])\n\nRing of Lightning Resistance (procured from Lady Delilah Briarwood[125], but later bartered away for information to Whaska[126])\n\nThe List (Unknown when he crafted it; destroyed by Scanlan via a pit of acid[127] to try and remove Orthax's control over him which succeeded)\n\nAbilities[]\n\nBeing a fighter, Percy benefits from proficiency in all manners of weapons and armor. However, as he is also a gunslinger, he is more skilled in the usage of firearms, but he is more than capable of using one-handed melee weapons such as rapiers and longswords. Percy tends to use damage-enhancing abilities to increase the power of his shots, in addition to targeted shots meant to hinder the enemy. Upon gaining the Magic Initiate feat, due to his connection to the shadow demon Orthax, he is able to cast a few spells but in a limited capacity, most notably his Hex spell, which manifests as a trail of black smoke circling his enemy.\n\nFirearm enchantments[]\n\nFire Shot (one barrel of The List)\n\nIce Shot (one barrel of The List)\n\nPsychic (Animus)\n\nFeats[]\n\nMagic Initiate: Warlock\n\nHex (1/day)[128]\n\nFriends[129]\n\nMinor Illusion[130]\n\nSharpshooter\n\nTough[131]\n\nFighter abilities[]\n\nClass features[]\n\nAction Surge (twice per rest)\n\nExtra Attack (4 attacks per action)\n\nFighting Style: Archery (+2 to ranged attack rolls)\n\nIndomitable (three times per rest, called \"Resolve\" by Taliesin)\n\nMartial Archetype: Gunslinger\n\nGrit (5 points)\n\nDeadeye Shot[132]\n\nFirearm Proficiency\n\nGunsmith\n\nHemorrhaging Critical[133]\n\nLightning Reload\n\nPiercing Shot\n\nQuickdraw\n\nTrick Shot\n\nArm Shot[134]\n\nHead Shot[135]\n\nLeg Shot[136]\n\nTorso Shot[137]\n\nWing Shot[138]\n\nPush Shot\n\nVicious Intent[139]\n\nViolent Shot[140]\n\nSecond Wind\n\nAppearances and mentions[]\n\nPre-stream\n\nCampaign One, every episode played by Taliesin except \"Trial of the Take: Part 3\" (1x20), absent, \"Trial of the Take: Part 4\" (1x21), absent, and \"Consequences and Cows\" (1x26) [DM]\n\nCampaign Three\n\n\"Trial by Firelight\" (3x02), mentioned only[141]\n\n\"On the Trail of a Killer\" (3x04), mentioned only[142]\n\n\"Chasing Nightmares\" (3x11), mentioned only[143]\n\n\"Make It Fashion\" (3x12), mentioned only\n\n\"What Dreams May Come\" (3x34), mentioned only\n\n\"A Desperate Call\" (3x36)\n\n\"A Dark Balance\" (3x38)\n\n\"The Momentum of Murder\" (3x39), mentioned only\n\n\"The Aurora Grows\" (3x49), mentioned only\n\n\"Escape From The Past\" (3x58), mentioned only (unnamed)\n\n\"A Long Walk of Reflection\" (3x62), mentioned only (unnamed)\n\n\"A Haunted Past\" (3x63), mentioned only\n\n\"Reunited\" (3x64), mentioned only\n\n\"For The Tempest\" (3x68), mentioned only\n\n\"Embattled in Bassuras\" (3x70), mentioned only\n\n\"A Gathering of Heroes\" (3x76)\n\n\"The Promise and the Price\" (3x77)\n\n\"Fractures\" (3x78)\n\n\"The Eve of the Red Moon\" (3x81)\n\n\"Arrival at Kreviris\" (3x87), mentioned only\n\n\"The Cradle's Convocation\" (3x104), mentioned only (unnamed)\n\nSpecials\n\n\"The Story of Vox Machina\" (Sx06)\n\n\"Critical Role Q&A and Battle Royale: Take II\" (Sx10)\n\n\"CelebriD&D with Joe Manganiello\"\n\n\"Critical Role – Level 17 Battle Royale!\" (Sx19)\n\n\"Critical Role: Grog's One-Shot\" (Sx26)\n\n\"Trinket's Honey Heist\" (Sx27), mentioned only\n\n\"Critical Role One-Shot: Epic Level Battle Royale\" (Sx30)\n\n\"The Search For Grog\" (Sx42)\n\n\"The Search For Bob\" (Sx45)\n\n\"Dalen's Closet\" (Sx47)\n\n\"Vox Machina vs. Mighty Nein\" (Sx57)\n\nThe Legend of Vox Machina, every episode\n\nCritical Role: Winter's Crest Festival\n\nVox Machina Origins Series I\n\nIssue 1, mentioned only\n\nIssue 2, mentioned only\n\nIssue 3, mentioned only\n\nVox Machina Origins Series II\n\nIssue 5\n\nIssue 6\n\nVox Machina Origins Series III\n\nIssue 1\n\nIssue 2\n\nIssue 3\n\nIssue 4\n\nIssue 5\n\nVox Machina Origins: Animals, mentioned only\n\nQuotations[]\n\n\"You fool, your soul is forfeit! Die! Die!\"[144]\n\nPercy: (to Sir Kerrion just before executing him) This is for the de Rolos. And let me say, you are the one I was least looking forward to.[145]\n\n\"You are, at the moment, the luckiest person in Whitestone. Do you know why? Because you're at the bottom of my list.\"[146]\n\n\"Your secret is safe with my indifference.\"[147]\n\n\"I've known a lot of people with money, and they are definitely not worth you. And besides, if they have something nice that makes you feel inferior, we can just take it.\" (Percy cheering up Vex before they enter Syngorn; also the moment when Percy realized he loves Vex.)[148]\n\n\"Life needs things to live.\"[149]\n\n\"A tree is just a door that hasn't been made yet, remember.\"[150]\n\n\"No matter what [happens] today, I forgive you... but I cannot let you leave.\" (Percy forgiving Ripley, and finally letting go of his quest for revenge.)[151]\n\n\"We're going to start with the Courage and not talk about dragons.\" (Percy, just before running into Vex's room and shutting the door behind him, after Vex had answered the door completely naked.)[152]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nPercy is based on the old script Taliesin wrote about the person who was decisive enough to invent the first gun and see the harmful consequences of this. During his writing, Taliesin was processing death trauma and listening to The Black Rider, which is based on the German folktale Der Freischütz. It's about a person who made a deal with the devil to gain magic bullets which never miss, except for one which will hit the target the devil decides.[153]\n\nThe names of the entire de Rolo Family are based on real people, as Taliesin stole the names from friends; only a couple of them have any idea he did it. The rest of Percy's full name comes from friends, characters Taliesin played as a child actor, and an anime character (Reinhard von Musel from Legend of the Galactic Heroes).[154] Inside Critical Role canon Percival was named in such an unwieldy way to placate relatives of his parents who demanded recognition.[155]\n\nPercival has several alternative etymologies: it can come from the Old French per ce val (through this valley), perce val (pierce the valley), or Pellesvax (\"He Who Has Lost The Vales\", in a way a reference to Percy losing his home); it can also come from the German \"Parzival\" (right through the middle); and according to a discredited etymology, it could also come from Parsifal, derived from the Arabic fal parsi (pure fool).\n\nFredrickstein can be translated from German as \"Fredrick's stone/rock\".\n\nThis name is most likely a reference to Percy's own father, Frederick, and the \"stone/rock\" part could reference Whitestone itself.\n\nVon Musel is made up of two elements: von is a German preposition meaning \"of\". Musel, on the other hand, could have different origins: a possibility is that it's a variant of mussel, the common name used for certain types of bivalve molluscs; another option is that it's an Old French term meaning \"muzzle\". It is also the surname of his mother, Johanna.\n\nKlossowski has a mysterious etymology, but since it ends with the suffix \"-ski\" (which essentially means \"from\" in Polish), probably \"Klossow\" is a place or a person possibly connected with a family related to his own parents.[156]\n\nDespite the name being \"Klossowski\" (clo-SOFF-skee), throughout Campaign 1 everybody (Taliesin included) pronounces it \"Kowalski\" (co-WALL-skee).\n\nDe Rolo is made up of two elements: de is a French or Spanish preposition meaning \"of\"; Rolo, on the other hand, is a variant of the Norwegian name Rollo, which in turn derives from the Old Norse name Hrodwulf (hrod meaning \"renown\" and wulf meaning \"wolf\").[157]\n\nPercy has the highest dexterity score of any player character thus far.\n\nPercy shares with Caleb, Lyra, and Lillith the highest intelligence score of any player character thus far.\n\nPercy is featured on the artwork for Matthew Mercer's \"Gunslinger Martial Archetype for Fighters\" on the Dungeon Masters Guild.[158]\n\nIn the Critical Role Major Arcana Tarot Card Set, he represents XV - The Devil.\n\nIn the original title sequence, Percy, unlike the rest of Vox Machina, is identified by his subclass rather than his class. This is most-likely the result of having started off using the standalone Gunslinger class in the campaign's Pathfinder days.\n\nPercy has had the most romantic ties during the run of the first campaign. While Vex'ahlia ended up marrying him, Pike is confirmed to have had interest and Tary wanted to marry a Percy type of guy. In addition, Scanlan drank a love potion given to him by Grog and Vax'ildan in \"The Ominous March\" (1x109) and he temporarily fell in love with him.\n\nSeveral parallels can be made between Percy and Fjord. Each of them forged pacts with unseen higher forces (again, Orthax and Uk'otoa respectively), each with a dark and nefarious agenda, and they both have a particularly antagonistic relationship with a female NPC who made a pact with the same force they did (in this case, Anna Ripley and Avantika respectively). Additionally, each wields an enchanted weapon (either provided or influenced) by those higher forces: The List and the Sword of Fathoms. Furthermore, each character severs their pacts by dropping their pact weapon into a pool of highly destructive liquid (Acid for Percy, and Lava for Fjord).\n\nPercy holds the record for highest damage in a single turn targeting only one creature at a time with 197 points in \"The Search For Grog\" (Sx42), 249 points counting his Hemorrhaging Critical. With the Hemorrhaging Critical, he also holds the record for most damage in a single attack to a single target with 156 points. Without it, that attack, 104 points, ranks third.[159]\n\nPercy is included in the Critical Role Pack DLC for Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire.\n\nPercy was briefly a saddlemaker (in addition to other jobs) in his period of figuring out what he wanted from his life.[160]\n\nHe still has his mask in his office.[161]\n\nHe has made pop guns as toys for some of his children.[162]\n\n[]\n\nCritical Role: Percy's Soundtrack – Number One With a Bullet (October 22, 2015)\n\nDear Vox Machina: Ask Percy (June 10, 2016)\n\nPercy's Playlist 2016: A Light Must Cast the Shadow (December 9, 2016)\n\nPercy's Playlist 2017: The Life and Times of Percival de Rolo(November 28, 2017)\n\nReferences[]\n\nArt:"
