        "text": "FREDERICKTOWN, Ohio (WSYX/WTTE) â€”\n\nPerry, 52, was a Fredericktownnative and born in nearby Mansfield. He graduated from Fredericktown High School in 1984.\n\nMayor Jerry Day, the former police chief in Fredericktown for 30 years, knew Perry when he was a child growing up in the village. He never lost his connection with Luke, even after he grew up to become the star of television shows \"Beverly Hills 90210 \" and \"Riverdale.\"\n\n\"He told everybody he was going out to California, and going to be a movie star,\" said Day on Monday. \"I remember some of the people saying, 'yeah right, that'll never happen.' Well he proved them wrong!'\"\n\nPerry was in high school theatre productions at Fredericktown, and also served as the school's \"Freddie Bird\" mascot.\n\nHis eighth grade math teacher, Don Falk, says Perry was always a charismatic kid.\n\n\"It (Perry's death) really was a shock, not only because he's Luke but because he's an ex-student of mine too,\" Falk said.\n\n\"He put Fredericktown on the map,\" says mayor Jerry Day. \"His mind was made up that that's what he was going to do. And he did it!\"\n\n____\n\nFollowGeoffrey on and"
