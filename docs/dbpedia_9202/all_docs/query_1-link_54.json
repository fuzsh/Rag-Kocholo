        "text": "The Perry Sisters\n\nThe ability to forge new song-writing territory that creates a remarkable\n\ninterest in the gospel music community, exciting a new generation of\n\nlisteners, as well as satisfying a core audience that has helped mold a very\n\nsuccessful ministry is a challenge to be taken seriously. This challenge has\n\nbeen accepted by a talented group of individuals who have helped pave the\n\ngospel music way. The Perry Sisters have committed their hearts to the\n\nmusical ministry of Jesus Christ, and have seen hundreds of thousands of\n\npeople come to know our Savior.\n\nThe Perry Sisters originated in Huntington, WV in 1974 with Diana Perry\n\nGillette and her two sisters, Bonnie and Carol. In 1984 they signed with a\n\nmajor record label and officially became the first professional ladies trio\n\nin southern gospel music. In 1990 Diana's sisters retired from the road,\n\nleaving Diana as the remaining founding member.\n\nThe group has reorganized with Diana Perry Gillette in the lead position.\n\nDiana has one of the most recognizable voices in gospel music today, and is\n\none of the best songwriters in the southern gospel industry.\n\nTammy Underwood, Diana's niece, holds the soprano position and plays acoustic\n\nguitar. Tammy has a signature sound with dynamic tones and range. Tammy and\n\nher sister, Tina, have also contributed to the Perry Sisters song-writing\n\nefforts.\n\nRodney Underwood joins Tammy on stage. Rodney plays keyboards, bass guitar\n\nand is the sound tech for the group.\n\nIn the alto position newcomer Jada Hite. Jada is originally from Lucedale,\n\nMississippi and was actively involved in a solo ministry. Her youth and\n\nvitality is especially appealing to the younger audience.\n\nThe Perry Sisters have recorded 24 albums, and had 29 top forty hits, in a\n\ncareer spanning 27 years. The Perry Sisters have been nominated for numerous\n\nawards such as: Favorite Trio, Favorite Soprano, Horizon Award, and Favorite\n\nVideo. Considering that most gospel music material has been written with male\n\nquartets in mind, these accomplishments are not to be taken lightly.\n\nThe Perry Sisters have met the song-writing challenges. Diana has been\n\npenning songs since 1980, including as I Wonder How Mary Felt, There'll Be A\n\nPayday, Resurrection Morn, Imagine If You Will, Heaven's Avenue, Only\n\nSleeping, More Like You, and That Wonderful Name.\n\nWith their love for the Lord, and their amazing harmonies, it is no wonder\n\nThe Perry Sisters have been named \"The First Ladies of Gospel Music.\"\n\nEveryone should take the opportunity to witness, for themselves, The Perry\n\nSisters in performance. The audience will see a family with a genuine love\n\nfor their craft, an honest approach to their fans, and an unbridled\n\ndedication for writing and singing music for the Lord."
