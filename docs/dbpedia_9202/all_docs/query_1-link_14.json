        "text": "Valerie Mae Perry, affectionately known as Val, was a kind-hearted, genuine, and thoughtful individual. She had a unique sense of humor and was always friendly, striking up conversations with anyone she encountered. Valerie's joyful spirit attracted people to her, making her a beloved member of her community.\n\nBorn on January 13, 1982, in Tucson, Arizona, Valerie spent her early years spreading love and kindness. She would often brush her younger sister's hair and a bond that would last their entire lives. During her youthful days, Valerie, her cousins and her special friends would gather together creating cherished memories that they would fondly recall in the years to come.\n\nValerie lived life fearlessly and was always up for an adventure. Her adventurous spirit took her on many journeys where she embraced new experiences. She held no reservations when it came to exploring the world around her.\n\nIn addition to her fearless nature, Valerie took solace in her faith. She found comfort in reading the Bible and cherished moments spent at the San Xavier Mission Church. These spiritual undertakings were central to her life as she sought strength and guidance in her faith.\n\nValerie's life choices took her down a different path but her children, Domonic Conriquez and Gabriel Perry, were undoubtedly one of her proudest accomplishments.\n\nOn January 7, 2024, Tucson lost a shining light as Valerie passed away in her hometown. However, the impact she made during her time on Earth will continue to resonate within the hearts of all who knew her.\n\nA visitation service will be held at Martinez Funeral Chapels - Tucson on January 17, 2024, starting from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. This will be a time for friends and family to gather, share memories, and find solace in each other's presence. A Rosary will take place at the same venue on the same day, beginning at 6:00 PM.\n\nValerie is survived by her parents, Genaro Rivera and Irma Perry, who cherishes her memory dearly. She leaves behind her adored children; Domonic Conriquez and Gabriel Perry, who will continue to carry her love in their hearts. Valerie also leaves behind her siblings: Bruce Perry (Gemma), Brian Perry (Arlinda), Clint Perry, Mona Perry (Daniel), Matthew Rivera, and Roxanne Rivera, who were a significant part of her life journey. God-parents, Gene Pina and Olga Bristol and her godchildren, Alissandra Pina and Bruce \"Bubba\" Perry will hold onto the love that Valerie bestowed upon them as they navigate through life.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her father, Bruce Perry; grandparents, Charlie and Ramona Perry; Armando and Irene Pina; and Tia Martha. The memories and lessons shared between Valerie and these loved ones will forever be cherished.\n\nValerie's passing leaves a void in the lives of many who considered her a friend, cousin, sister, or confidant. Her memory will live on through the stories shared by those she touched throughout her life.\n\nIn remembrance of Valerie Mae Perry's remarkable spirit, let us reflect on the love she radiated into this world. Her legacy of kindness, fearlessness, and joyous living will continue to inspire those who had the privilege of knowing her. May she rest in eternal peace knowing that her presence made a profound impact on all those fortunate enough to have crossed paths with her."
