        "text": "Lamoine - Perry Jay Fowler, 52, passed away unexpectedly at his home on April 14, 2024. He was born March 13, 1972, in Bar Harbor, the sweetest son of Jay and Jane Fowler. At an early age, he showed an interest and aptitude for excavation and by the age of 15, he became the youngest person ever in the State of Maine to earn a Class 1 driver's license. He was an Eagle Scout and recognized with the Order of the Arrow, an honor given to Scouts, who best exemplify the Scout Oath and Law in their daily lives.\n\nPerry graduated from Ellsworth High School and earned a Bachelor of Science in Natural Resources from the University of Maine. Upon graduation, he went to work full time alongside his father, helping to grow a successful business based on exceptional work ethic, intelligence, honesty, and integrity. Perry served his hometown of Lamoine in a variety of civic capacities and was honored with his father with the first ever Citizens of the Year award in 2008. He was a Shriner, and member of the Maine Antique Tractor Club and Acadia ATV Club. He never outgrew his childhood love for trucks, cars, Harley motorcycles, and off-road vehicles.\n\nPerry is survived by his unconditionally loving parents, son, Ross Fowler, daughter Olivia Fowler, and long-time love, Donna Callahan, all of Lamoine; his sister, Betsy Westcott-Keiter and her husband, Chris Keiter, (Skyler and Xander) of South Portland, Maine; and sister, Holly Fowler and her husband, Scott Richardson, of Montpelier, Vermont.\n\nPerry was good as gold. He invested every ounce of his being in his family and offered endless generosity to his friends. He was unquestionably, the best son, father, brother, and friend that anyone could ask for and nothing will ever fill the enormous hole his too soon departure leaves in our hearts and lives.\n\nVisiting hours will be offered 5-7 p.m. Friday, April 19, 2024, with a Masonic Service at 6:30 p.m. at Jordan-Fernald, 113 Franklin St., Ellsworth, where a funeral service will be held 11 a.m. Saturday, April 20, 2024. A private internment will be held immediately following the service. Gifts for Perry's children may be sent to Ross Fowler at 80 Walker Rd., Lamoine, ME 04605.\n\nCondolences may be expressed at jordanfernald.com"
