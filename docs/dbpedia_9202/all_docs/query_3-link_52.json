        "text": "For the last six years, Katy Perry, 39, has sat in the middle seat at the American Idol judging table — which is familiar for her as the middle child of three siblings. The “Firework” singer, whose real name is Katy Hudson, has an older sister Angela Hudson, 41, and a younger brother David Hudson, 35, who have both been so supportive of her incredible career. Not only has Katy dominated the music industry, but she’s also been an excellent judge on American Idol since 2018, though she recently announced that she’s leaving the ABC competition series after the new season.\n\nMany people don’t know that Katy has two siblings. And interestingly enough, her brother and her sister are both passionate about music like she is. Get to know Angela and David below!\n\nAngela Hudson\n\nAngela Hudson, the oldest child of Mary Perry and Keith Hudson, was born December 7, 1982. Angela sang when she was younger, and Katy started doing the same with Angela’s cassette tapes. They both took singing lessons, but it was Katy who made it into a career for herself. The “Part of Me” hitmaker sang at churches and became a gospel singer, before transitioning into the pop star that we know her as today.\n\nWhile Angela didn’t pursue music like Katy did, the look-alike sisters have stayed incredibly close over the years. In 2018, they launched the Firework Foundation together which is dedicated to using the arts to help children from underserved communities.\n\nIn an interview with Variety in 2021, Katy said that her sister has had the biggest influence on her in her life. “She always had the best ethics and character — and values are so important to me,” Katy said. “She has a family of her own, and she always puts her family first, no matter what. And she encouraged me to follow through with starting the Firework Foundation, and helped me organize it and all the logistics as my co-creator on something that I’m really passionate about.”\n\nAngela got married to her husband Svend Lerche in 2012. They have two children together, who were born in 2014 and 2016. Katy helped her sister give birth to both of her children. “Helped deliver my sister’s baby at 2pm & am in the studio by 8pm. GET A GIRL THAT CAN DO BOTH,” she tweeted on September 12, 2016.\n\nDavid Hudson\n\nDavid Hudson was born on August 11, 1988. He’s six years younger than Angela and four years younger than Katy. David followed in Katy’s footsteps as a musician. He released his debut EP, Dirty Face, in 2012, and followed that up with his first album, The Revolution, which came out in August 2013. David goes by the stage name HUDSON.\n\nDavid has also done some acting work. According to his IMDb, he was in the short films Never Forget, Define Love, and Summer Campbell. He made an appearance in Katy’s 2012 autobiographical documentary concert film, Katy Perry: Part of Me.\n\nDavid got married in 2018. According to various reports, Katy caught the bouquet at her brother’s nuptials."
