        "text": "POL 203 Girls’ Stories: Race, Politics, Pedagogy\n\nStudy of American politics through investigation of stories written about American girls in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nPOL 201 America’s First Ladies\n\nExploring American First Ladies as political and social actors.\n\nPOL 210 Race, Class, and Social Justice\n\nThis course explores answers to the questions: What is social justice? How are identities, experiences, and structures of race, ethnicity, and class intertwined with social justice in the American context? Why does social justice matter? What can individuals and communities do to develop socially justice outcomes? Students closely read a number of texts drawn from a wide variety of disciplines and contemporary popular writings. In addition to traditional classroom practices of lecture, discussion, and writing, this course moves decidedly beyond the classroom by requiring students to engage in a number of social justice activities on campus and in the Winston-Salem community. Students work collaboratively to build a toolkit for social justice as the final project for the class."
