We fix shoes, boots, jackets, belts, hats– anything but your kitchen sink. Perry’s also carries full lines of hiking boots and shoes, slippers, fashion boots, winter boots, socks, apparel, sunglasses and biker gear!\n\nPerry’s Shoe Shop has been in business since 1922 and was Boulder’s second oldest business, when lucky for us, they relocated to Nederland. Located on 2nd Street, they are Nederland’s only full-service shoe store. They offer a full selection of top-quality hiking boots, work boots, backpacks, purses, slippers and shoes as well as medical orthotics and shoe lifts.\n\nWith the workshop in the back of the store, they have the ability and skills to repair any leather issues you may encounter, such as zipper replacements on jackets or purses, glove and belt repairs or even high heel replacement. The family-owned and operated business has experience with everything from dance shoes to hats.\n\nGeorge Perry started the business in Boulder in 1922 and passed it down to his son, George II, who passed it down, in turn, to his own son, George III and his wife Becky, who was hired as an employee in 1976.\n\nTheir daughter, Emily, was born in 1986 and has been raised in the business. In 2017, the family began considering that they were being priced out of their hometown by exponentially high rent prices. Emily then found their current home listed for sale in the same county, and the rest is history!"
