        "text": "Country music has a long and proud history of women who have made a difference in the genre. In 2024, country music is ruled by one female, particularly the CMA 2023 Entertainer of the Year, Lainey Wilson.\n\nWilson had a night that she will never forget at the 57th Annual CMA Awards In November (2023).\n\nWhen she came backstage, I asked Lainey about meeting and spending some quality time with the 1978 CMA Entertainer of The Year, Dolly Parton. The two got together at Dollywood a week before the CMA Awards. She told me, “Actually, when I went to Dollywood, and I hung out with her a little bit, I told her… I said the CMAs are around the corner. She said, ‘I’ve won one a time or two.’ I mean, Dolly, she’s it. She’s the one that I look to when I think about how to go about this business. She’s never been scared to step outside the lines, to step outside the box. But at the same time, she’s completely true to herself and true to her story.” Indeed, on Lainey’s major label debut, 2021’s Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’, she had a song called “WWDD.” That stands for “What would Dolly do?”\n\nShe added, “I asked for some advice on how do you keep on going. And she said, ‘You’ve got to keep going, and whatever you are affiliated with, make sure that you’re passionate about it because at the end of the day If you’re not, people can read right through that.'”\n\nWilson concluded with a smile. “It’s incredible, you know how everybody says don’t meet your hero? Well, I’ll tell you what, that’s not Dolly Parton. She’s someone I think everybody needs to strive to be.” And clearly, she’s someone whom anyone would be lucky to meet.\n\nIn celebrating the success that Lainey is having in country music right now, we take a look at who we believe is the Top 20 female country singers of all time."
