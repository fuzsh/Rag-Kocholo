        "text": "If you close your eyes and listen to Ryan Perry’s recently released single — “My Hometown” — the lyrics conjure up vivid imagery often associated with a coming of age tale set in a quintessential small town, as the country artist reflects on his blue collar upbringing, high school football rivalries and cruising down gravel roads in the middle of nowhere.\n\nWhile the song itself conveys a relatable story for nearly anybody who grew up in a tight-knit rural community, the sun rising over the mountains around the Swannanoa Valley in the opening scenes of the accompanying video literally shines a light on the place it all began.\n\nThe veteran singer-songwriter, who co-wrote the ballad with Canton native Dakota Blakely, found inspiration for the project, which was released, Oct. 6, on major streaming platforms and the Ryan Perry YouTube channel, in his deep local roots.\n\n“I always wanted to pay tribute in a way that was different from other people,” said the Swannanoa native and 2007 Owen High School graduate. “It can be cliché when an artist writes a song about where they come from, so I wanted this to tell the story of our hometown in a unique way.”\n\nThe result is a heartfelt Swannanoa Valley anthem, complemented by a striking music video that brought Perry back to his old stomping grounds.\n\n“Here I was about to project to the world some of my story, so the video had to be spot on,” he said. “It was our goal to put out a product that was a gift to people from The Valley.”\n\nDirected by Swannanoa resident, Andrew Butko, the video follows Perry and his son as the artist reminisces about growing up in the community. Familiar landmarks, including the Old Depot and La Tapa Lounge in Black Mountain, cut away to dramatic aerial shots of the small community nestled between the mountains.\n\nWhile filming scenes around his hometown was a memorable experience, recording the climactic performance footage, captured at midfield in Warhorse Stadium, gave him chills.\n\n“There were so many spots on that field I would look at and remember certain plays or things that happened,” said Perry, who donned his old faded number 50 Owen jersey for the shoot. “It was really nostalgic for me to be down there, realizing how long it had been.\n\n“I’ve had people reach out and say they got teary-eyed from that scene, and old football friends telling me it really hit home,” he continued. “That lets me know I did some justice in letting the world see how we live here.”\n\nReturning to the field, where he played under longtime head coach Kenny Ford, was an especially poignant experience for Perry.\n\n“Something that’s always stuck with me is the values we were taught on that football team,” he said. “Coach Ford used to say, ‘you don’t go as hard as you need to go in the fourth quarter,’ and that’s kind of how life is. When you feel like you have nothing left to give, you still have something in there.”\n\nMany of the lessons Perry learned growing up in the Swannanoa Valley are reflected in his art, but the appeal of his music extends beyond Western N.C., as a busy schedule has taken his band to venues in Nashville, Gatlinburg and Myrtle Beach. The emerging country music star is scheduled to play shows throughout the rest of the year, including a Saturday, Dec. 3 performance at Harrah’s Cherokee Casino.\n\nWhile his latest release looks back at the experiences that shaped him, “My Hometown” also represents a springboard into the next chapter of his musical career.\n\n“I have a whole arsenal of music, and we’re writing all the time,” Perry said. “I think 2023 will be super busy, with bigger shows, and hopefully a tour. But, you can definitely expect more music.”\n\nFor new releases and upcoming shows by Ryan Perry, visit ryanperryofficial.com or follow @officialryanperry on Facebook, Instagram or TikTok."
