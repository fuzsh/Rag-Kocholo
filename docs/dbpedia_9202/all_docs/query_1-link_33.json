Ray unapologetically lived his life on his own terms. He was a man of creative wit, prodigious intellect, and voracious appetite who also possessed an ardent disregard for societal norms and the expectations of others. He loved movies, television, books, intelligent discourse, innovative humor, food, making people laugh, and simple living. He despised bullies, arrogance, and those whom he felt flaunted advantages that they had not earned. Ray attended The Phillips-Osborne School in Painesville, Ohio, and was a graduate of Perry High School (2001), Kenyon College (B.A. Political Science 2005), and Cleveland State University College of Law (J.D. summa cum laude 2016).

Ray later earned his Juris Doctor at night while working full-time for a cancer research non-profit and found his calling in law, which he excelled at and took great satisfaction in practicing. He was known to be generous with his time and knowledge and frequently helped those around him solve challenging personal legal matters in his spare time. Ray himself could also be challenging – at times intractable, inscrutable, and a living contradiction of logic – but many people loved and respected him, regardless of whether he invited or agreed with such sentiments.Ray was preceded in death by his father Jon “Butch” Coatoam, grandmother Claire “Tootsie” Kekelis, grandfather Raymond Coatoam, grandmother Virginia Terrell, grandfather McConnel “Mac” Terrell, Aunt Colleen Kekelis, and Uncle John Terrell.

He passed away in Dallas, Texas on Thursday, February 22nd, 2024 at 73 years of age from ALS or Lou Gherig’s disease. He is preceded in death by parents Robert and Audrey Schlueter and survived by his wife Zosia, daughter Susan, step children Adrianne Clifton and James Wurtz, his brothers Jerry and John, and his dog Buddy. Anyone and everyone who knew Jim has spoken of what a kind gentleman he was. Loving husband and father, he cared deeply for his wife and daughter and wanted to provide a wonderful life for them. He loved his family and put family first. According to his friends and coworkers, “Jim was a really good guy”. He was always willing to lend an ear, give advice or help those in need and put others before himself. Jim was reared in Perry, Ohio, attended Perry High School and graduated in 1969. He then went on to receive his bachelor’s degree at Bowling Green University in 1973 and his master’s degree at Ohio University in 1976. Jim’s career as a geologist took him many places. He lived in Bakersfield, California, Houston, Midland, Texas and Carlsbad, New Mexico. He worked at Marathon Oil Company in Midland, Texas and MYCO Industries (an affiliate of Yates Petroleum) in Artesia, New Mexico for many years. He was a hard worker and extremely intelligent. Jim worked until the job was done and the job was done right. He always had a method and routine he followed at work and in most aspects of his life. He was dedicated and passionate about his career and it was evident that he loved being a geologist and enjoyed his coworkers. Jim’s love for rocks, their formations, minerals, and gemstones was passed down to his daughter Susan who was often seen picking up rocks and stones at the park as a child. Those who knew Jim knew he was a “simple” man. He appreciated the simple things in life. He was a member of the First United Methodist Church (Midland). He loved music and listening to his records, enjoyed walking his dogs, going to the park and riding bikes with his daughter, reading the newspaper, lounging in his recliner watching football or his favorite shows, and doing puzzles, and sudoku. He enjoyed rock and mineral shows and car shows. In his younger years, Jim enjoyed cycling and in his later years, he enjoyed working out at the North Mesa Senior Recreation Center (Carlsbad). Jim made a difference in many lives and impacted everyone who entered his life. He will always be remembered and live on in the hearts and minds of many. A memorial service will be held later this spring. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to The ALS Association and West Texas ALS Support Group as well as Gentiva Hospice. A memorial for Jim Schlueter will be held Saturday, April 13th at 12 PM at Red Chimney which is located on 817 N Canal Street, Carlsbad, NM 88220.\n\nSusan Kulhanek, Class of 1987\n\nSusan Kulhanek, age 54, passed away March 13, 2024. She was born April 16, 1969, in Parma to James and Madeline (Kurz) Kulhanek. On March 13, our precious Susan lost her battle to CRPS after fighting bravely for four years against excruciating pain. She was 54 years old. Even with the extreme pain, she continued to show love towards her daughters, Emily and Rachel She loved them fiercely and was so proud of both of them. She would have walked though fire for them and likely did through the CRPS pain. Even in her darkest hours, she had an amazing ability to give thoughtful, specific, generous, personalized gifts that made a person feel known and seen. She loved watching the recipient open the gift and feel their joy. It was her way of showing love or saying she loved you. She was an empath, extremely aware of others’ feelings. Susan hated injustice. She would passionately defend her loved ones (even when they didn’t want/need defending at times). Best seen in her 20 plus year career at Brittany Residential Inc where she helped many disabled people live rewarding lives. She loved “her guys” and wanted the best for them. Growing up with all the neighborhood kids, she created performances of Annie, West Side Story, and Fame in our basement. She would listen to hours of Billy Joel albums, Pat Benatar, and some of her favorites, Heart and The Cars. When not performing, her childhood was spent in the yard, playing catch with a baseball, shooting hoops, playing “Kick the Can” and “Ghost in the Graveyard” and other games with our great neighbor kid group until called in for the night. She was a talented artist and loved to create. Most memorable was when her parents allowed her to paint murals on the basement walls. Her artwork was excellent. She could beat anyone at naming 80's musicians/songs, Pictionary, Scrabble and word games. She hated grammatical mistakes, and the misuse of words like they’re, their, and there. She was actively involved with her daughters, from coaching their softball teams to hosting summer bonfires. Even as her children grew, her house was a joyful, safe space for holiday dinners and weekend sleep overs. If not together, she could be found communicating with her daughters several times a day. No decision, big or small, was made without consulting the “three musketeers”. She was thrilled to reunite with Brian 12 years ago at a class reunion and to marry him. She made a phone call to share the news. She said she “finally got it right”. And she was right. He was with her every minute until her last days. She even shared her love of Dunkin/Starbucks and converted him into a coffee drinker. She shared her birthday, April 16, with her paternal grandmother Julia, with whom she shared a strong, special bond. Both Susan and her paternal grandmother were Aries. As her horoscope says, she excelled at artistic expression and was here on this earth to connect on a deep, emotional level, to show compassion, love, and support to those in need. While we may try our best, grammatical errors are likely noted and Susan is probably editing from above. Susan is survived by her husband, Brian Klotzbach; daughters, Emily Kulhanek and Rachel Miramendi (Hafid Hugo); her 6 month-old twin grandsons, Santiago and Federico; her parents, Madelne and James Kulhanek; and her sister, Karen Kulhanek-Rochin (Gerardo Antonio) and a huge extended family of loved ones and friends. Friends will be received Wednesday, March 20, 2024, from 6:00-7:30 PM at Spear Mulqueeny Funeral Home, 667 Mentor Avenue, Painesville. Funeral Services will follow at 7:30 PM.

Heath, Class of 1970\n\nOn Wednesday January 10th, 2024, Suzanne Louise Heath passed away at home, in her sleep, comfortably and peacefully, just two weeks shy of her seventy second birthday. She battled with extensive medical issues including diabetes, stage 4 kidney disease, Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, and eventually her heart failed her. Little Susie was born to Harvey and Ruth Slater in Painesville, Ohio where she went on to learn many hobbies such as baking, crocheting, and roller skating; in which she enjoyed throughout her life. Sue graduated from Perry High School in Perry Township, Ohio, where she thrived. She was active in 4-H clubs, modeled for the Carlisle-Allen Fashion Teen Board (she was known for her nice legs), was a talented singer in the a cappella choir, and was a sports announcer at the high school basketball games. As a skilled seamstress, she created her wardrobe that included a new outfit nearly every day. After high school, she dabbled in some dragstrip racing, snowmobiling, and was on a bowling league. Suzanne moved to Dallas, Texas in 1981, where she made a career as an apartment complex manager for the fourth largest apartment company in the country, while also maintaining the role as a full-fledged pageant mom with Renae. She attended Orchard Hills Baptist Church, where she showered the ministries by making crafts like: homemade Christmas ornaments, door wreaths and hats. She loved to visit San Antonio for their vacations. In 1991, she moved to Mint Hill, North Carolina, where she raised her two daughters. She was dedicated in helping with the youth group at Hickory Grove Baptist Church for many years. She also assisted the company Young Olympians and Cheer America with Kristin. She was at every event supporting her girls and their interests, no matter what it was. She took great joy in making birthdays and Christmas mornings a huge deal for her children. You could always find Suzanne any day of the week sitting out by the pool tanning, sleeping in, watching the traffic go by, or hugging on her dog-Kozy, or kitty cat-Roo. She is often remembered for saving wishbones from turkeys and pinecones from nearby pine trees. She always had a list or coupon laying around, and a purse full of things you wouldn’t even imagine possible (screwdriver, duct tape, super glue, hammer). Suzanne loved her Dallas Cowboys NFL team, her black/white/gold house attire, her year-round Christmas tree, and her long hanging plants. She enjoyed going out for the night to listen to live music and dance with a long island iced tea in hand. If she could, she would live in Aruba forever, as she often stated it’s “one of the most beautiful places she ever visited”. Two of her favorite quotes in life were, “A little dirt never hurt” and “Hard work pays off”, which she shared constantly with her children. The loves of her life were her kids, who have all married wonderful spouses. She boasted at the fact that her children went on to become college graduates and an entrepreneur. Her pride and joy in life came from her four grandchildren whom she was able to care for as babies and watch grow. She recently held her youngest grandson’s hand while he took some of his first steps on his first birthday. She was able to spend time with family at all of the recent holidays; with Christmas time being her favorite, in which she celebrated the birth of her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
