        "text": "Katy Perry and her siblings grew up in a strict religious household in Southern California\n\nKaty Perry’s siblings, sister Angela Hudson Lerche and brother David Hudson, support their famous sister.\n\nWhen they were younger, the trio moved around the country with their parents, Pentecostal pastors Keith Hudson and Mary Perry Hudson. The couple wed in 1979 and welcomed Angela in 1982, Katy in 1984 and David in 1988. They eventually settled in Santa Barbara, California.\n\n\"I think being a middle child of an older sister and younger brother has prepared me the most for judging with @lukebryanonline #AmericanIdol,\" Katy jokingly posted on X (formerly Twitter) in 2019.\n\nThe Hudson kids have been artistically inclined, and they remain so. Katy is famously a huge pop star, while David released music in the early 2010s. In 2018, Angela, who was previously a yoga instructor and event planner, and Katy co-founded the Firework Foundation, a nonprofit aiming to bring the arts to underserved communities.\n\nAngela wed Danish drummer and producer Svend Lerche in 2012, and they share two daughters. David and his wife, Kami Hudson, also share two children, son Legend and daughter Brave. Katy, meanwhile, is engaged to Orlando Bloom. Together they share a daughter, Daisy Dove.\n\nHere’s everything to know about Katy Perry’s siblings, sister Angela Hudson Lerche and brother David Hudson.\n\nKaty and her siblings grew up musically inclined\n\nKaty is a middle child. Her older sister, Angela Hudson, was born on Dec. 7, 1982, and her younger brother, David Daniel Hudson, joined the family on Aug. 11, 1988.\n\nWhen they were young, the family moved around the country, as Keith and Mary set up Pentecostal churches before settling in Santa Barbara. In her 2012 documentary/concert movie, Katy Perry: Part of Me, the pop star said “the atmosphere that I grew up in was 100% Christian.”\n\nBoth she and Angela took singing lessons when they were younger, and Katy began singing in church.\n\n\"Katy is a middle child, so she always tried to stand out,\" Angela told Rolling Stone in 2010. \"Our whole family is like that, in a way. We love entertaining people, putting on a show.\"\n\nWhen Katy was 9, Angela brought a gospel demo tape home after a visit to her godparents’ house, marking the first time Katy saw singing as a possible career choice.\n\nKaty and David attended Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, California, where David was the main anchor for the morning announcements and captain of the improv team. He told Buzznet in 2018 that he loved theater and did the \"weird sports\" like badminton, ping-pong and dodgeball. (Katy dropped out after her freshman year and earned her GED at 15.)\n\nAngela met her husband on Katy's tour\n\nAngela used to go on tour with Katy — and that's where she met her husband, Svend Lerche.\n\nIn 2009, Angela was Katy’s VIP coordinator and Svend was the drummer of The Daylights, the band that opened Katy’s Hello Katy Tour.\n\n“We tried to keep our romance a secret for the first few weeks, but it didn’t last long and people started to catch on,” Angela told Santa Barbara Magazine in 2012.\n\nSvend proposed two years later in Copenhagen with a ring from his grandparents. They wed in front of 100 guests at El Capitan Canyon in Santa Barbara in May 2012. Katy served as a bridesmaid.\n\n“Shout out to my big sissy who sealed the deal this wknd & a lovely thank u to Amsale for our gorge bridesmaid dresses,” Katy posted on X. “We felt like fairies!”\n\nAngela and Svend went on to welcome two daughters in February 2014 and September 2016. The “Teenage Dream” singer was there for both home births.\n\n\"Finally you can add 'helps delivers babies in living rooms' to my resume! It's been a miracle of a day...❤️,\" Katy posted on X in 2014.\n\nTwo years later, she shared, “Helped deliver my sister's baby at 2pm & am in the studio by 8pm. GET A GIRL THAT CAN DO BOTH❗️👶🏻🎤.”\n\nKaty caught the bouquet at David's wedding\n\nWhen David tied the knot with his now-wife, Kami Brooke Hudson, in 2018, Katy was the one who caught the bouquet.\n\nThe Grammy winner later posted a video from the big moment on Instagram, which showed her running away after the catch. She jokingly captioned it, “When you crave companionship but run from love when you get it 💁🏼‍♀️❤️.”\n\nDavid and Kami welcomed their first child, son Legend Lais, in August 2019. Their daughter, Brave, joined the family in 2023.\n\nDavid is a singer and actor\n\nLike his big sister Katy, David also pursued a singing career. Under the stage name HUDSON, David released his debut EP, Dirty Face, in 2012, and first full-length album, The Revolution, dropped in 2013, according to Idolator.\n\nDavid said his sisters “were blown away” by his \"first musical endeavor.”\n\n“Katy was really busy, but I finally bugged her enough and she’s like, ‘Fine, I’ll listen to it,’ and then she must have sent me ten text messages in a row, ‘Who wrote this?’ ‘Is this really you singing?’ ‘Where did this come from?’ ‘How did you get in the studio?’ ” he told InTouch Weekly in 2012, per Point 99.9. \"It’s just kind of cool to see my sisters’ reactions. I look up to them and I love them.\"\n\nIn 2013, Katy made a surprise appearance at David's musical showcase at Bootsy Bellows in Los Angeles, where he was celebrating the release of his single, \"Chained,\" according to E! News.\n\nDavid has the same instinct to give back as his sisters, and he hopes to pursue this passion through his artistic endeavors.\n\n“My heart is on the music and acting, but everything I do I want to do with a philanthropic twist,” he said in an interview with Peter Dee. “I want to take everything I do and benefit people in need all around the world, and not just through finances, but I want people to volunteer their time. I want people to get involved with me.”\n\nWhen he was younger, David had a sketch comedy YouTube channel called Astrotape. He mostly posted in 2016, and his last upload was in 2018. He has also acted in four shorts: 2011's Never Forget, 2012's Define Love, 2013's Summer Campbell and 2014’s Madison.\n\nKaty and Angela run a nonprofit together\n\nThe sisters launched the Firework Foundation in 2018. The nonprofit seeks to help children from underserved communities access the arts, hosting annual summer sleep-away camps and partnering with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America year-round.\n\n“The arts gave me such a different perspective than the one I grew up in. It expanded my mind and gave me confidence,” Katy once told PEOPLE.\n\nAngela serves as the foundation's president. She shared that she and Katy \"relate to [these kids] so much\" because their family struggled financially when they were growing up.\n\n\"A lot of times it's reminding them that we didn't come from anything either,\" Angela said. “[Katy] wasn't born into some musical family that had all this access. She worked so hard for so many years to get to be where she is.\"\n\nThe sisters are hands-on at the camp, and Katy hopes the kids take everything they learn back with them into everyday life.\n\n“We [want to] support these young people throughout their whole educational journey,” Katy said. “I’m so grateful for my gift as a musician, but if in a hundred years nobody knows Katy Perry or the song ‘Firework,’ but they know what the Firework Foundation is, then I’ll have fulfilled my purpose.”\n\nBefore working with the foundation, Angela was an event planner and a yoga instructor.\n\nAngela has been by Katy’s side since the beginning of her career\n\nKaty is very close with her big sister, who has been by her side since her early days of her fame.\n\nShe was photographed backstage at the Katy Perry After Show Party in Berlin in 2008, and in 2013 was still hitting the road with the “Dark Horse” singer. Angela also lived next door to Katy in L.A. for a time, according to Marie Claire.\n\nAngela has also made a few red carpet appearances with her sister at major outings including the 2019 Baby2Baby Gala in Culver City, California, Variety’s Power of Women event in Beverly Hills in September 2021 and the 35th Annual Colleagues Spring Luncheon & Oscar de la Renta Fashion Show in April 2024, where Katy was honored.\n\nDavid has been Katy's Grammy date\n\nIn 2014, Katy brought her little brother to the Grammy Awards. The duo posed for photos on the red carpet, where Katy rocked a semi-sheer white dress with a musical design on the skirt, and David wore a black tux with a black button-up shirt and tan tie.\n\nA few years earlier, David was right by Katy's side for another big event — her One of the Boys album release party in 2008.\n\nAlong with their parents, he’s posed for photos backstage with Katy at the Broadway musical The Color Purple in New York City and at her ‘50s-themed 32nd birthday party, both in 2016.\n\nThey made cameos on American Idol and in Katy’s documentary\n\nKaty wrapped up her last season as a judge on American Idol in 2024, but not before making it a family affair.\n\nAngela joined Katy in season 7 when all the judges, including Lionel Richie and Luke Byran, held auditions in their respective hometowns. Katy introduced her fellow judges to Angela on State Street in Santa Barbara, where she got her start performing.\n\nA decade earlier, both Angela and David appeared in 2012’s Katy Perry: Part of Me. The documentary/concert film dove into many aspects of her life, including how hard Katy worked for her career.\n\n“It was not an overnight success,” David said in the documentary.\n\nKaty considers Angela a big influence in her life\n\nWhen asked who the most influential woman in her life was, Katy cited Angela.\n\n“She always had the best ethics and character — and values are so important to me,” the “E.T.\" singer told Variety in 2021. \"She has a family of her own, and she always puts her family first, no matter what. And she encouraged me to follow through with starting the Firework Foundation, and helped me organize it and all the logistics as my co-creator on something that I’m really passionate about.”\n\nAs for her brother, in 2014, Katy wrote on X in honor of his birthday that he was “full of light.”\n\nKaty spent her first Mother's Day with her sister\n\nKaty shares one child — daughter Daisy Dove, born in August 2020 — with her fiancé, Orlando Bloom.\n\nTo celebrate her first Mother’s Day in 2021, Katy brought Daisy along as she had lunch and went bowling with Angela, her mother, Mary, and her sister-in-law, Kami.\n\n\"It's amazing, my family has gone from 5 to 15, and we can't get a lunch reservation anywhere,” she once joked to PEOPLE.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
