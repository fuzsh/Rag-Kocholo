(Bruneau) Perry. She graduated from Ascension High School in Worcester and Emmanuel College in Boston. She entered the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur in 1951.\n\nSister Catherine taught elementary school for many years at Sacred Heart School in Springfield, MA. She also taught at Holy Name School in Chicopee and St. Aides School in New Haven, CT for several years. She loved spending time with her family, especially for cookouts, including one rare warm February when she was able to celebrate her birthday outdoors with a family cookout on the grounds of Notre Dame du Lac.\n\nShe leaves two sisters-in-law, Joan Perry of Sutton and Betty Perry of West Boylston. She also leaves many nieces and nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews, and her religious family at Notre Dame du Lac. She was predeceased by three brothers, George Perry, Francis Perry and Mitchell Perry, Jr. and a sister, Ann Perry. She was also predeceased by her beloved dog, Ginger."
