        "text": "Fan Reviews\n\nAlena\n\nJuly 22nd 2024\n\nBy far the BEST spirit filled southern gospel group that I've seen in a while. It's like the old fashioned services use to be when we didn't want it to end. THEY'RE NOT a staged 'act\" that shows step by step on a monitor besides letting GOD LEAD as some have become sadly. They know how to praise the Lord and remain humble. God bless their sweet hearts, watch over them I pray 🙏 🤲\n\nRichmond, IN@\n\nFirst Church of the Nazarene\n\nJoe\n\nJune 22nd 2024\n\nThis was the best show I have seen in some time. Outstanding. Libby's voice has not changed in all these years. Many groups lose their appeal when they change persons, but not the Perry's. Highly recommend\n\nHeber Springs, AR@\n\nMountain Top Cowboy Church\n\nJeff\n\nMarch 19th 2024\n\nSaw The Perrys at Union (or is it Unity) Church put on by a great promoter, Tom, at the last minute. Loved the concert. Perrys lineup is great and of course you have the legendary Libby Stuffle. Great mix of new and classic Perrys songs. They have a very good lineup and of course great songs. A good mix of music and good storytelling from Libby's childhood, how the family singing group got started after some horrific tragedies. The venue is intimate but I've been there several times and I love singings there. Very nice and friendly people. Shoutout to The New Hinsons and Chris Golden for supporting their fellow SG artists. I highly recommend hearing the Perrys anywhere and/or music at this church. I can't wait to hear the other groups Tom brings to the area!\n\nGreenbrier, TN@\n\nUnity Free Will Baptist Church - Greenbrier, TN 37073\n\nDaniel\n\nFebruary 25th 2024\n\nLOVE the Perry’s! I’d heart a podcast featuring the Perry’s lead singing on Southern Gospel Forward and was looking forward to the concert. They did NOT disappoint! They sand many old and new songs that encouraged and presented the gospel.\n\nLaurel, MS@\n\nMyrick Community Center Gym\n\nBill\n\nJanuary 8th 2024\n\nOne of, if not the BEST live concerts in a church I have been to. The HOLY SPIRIT was present and our pastor got to sing 2 songs with them.\n\nJackson, OH@\n\nTrinity Chapel\n\nConnie\n\nJuly 23rd 2023\n\nHave not had the opportunity to see the Perry's live in over 10 years. What a blessing. Enjoyed them as much as I ever did. God bless you and provide so that you continue your ministry. Look forward to seeing you again.\n\nDanville, VA@\n\nTimberlake Baptist Church\n\nDaniel\n\nApril 7th 2023\n\nLOVE getting a chance to see the Perrys! They mix old, new, contemporary and camp-meeting sounds to make a blend all their own. Still miss seeing Tracy on the end but you can tell the group does too. Jared stand honorably in his place and I couldn't be more proud.\n\nPearl, MS@\n\nGrandview Baptist Church\n\nSheila\n\nFebruary 1st 2023\n\nI LOVE the Perry’s and listen to them every day & night. They have been a TREMENDOUS BLESSING & INSPIRATION to me!!!!! I have downloaded 30 hours of their music & even put earphones in my ears to listen to them all night. I find I awaken feeling much more at peace and it’s amazing hearing their music last thing at night & first in the morning. I never dreamed I would get to see them in person until we all got to Heaven. Praise The Lord for making a dream come true. I keep the Perry’s on my prayer list always because I know they are always spreading the gospel! They are so anointed by God!! I love and appreciate them so very much!!!!\n\nRock Spring, GA@\n\nCommunity Baptist Church\n\nLinda\n\nJanuary 30th 2023\n\nA great concert, as always. Libby never fails to tell the crowd about Jesus, how to know Him and how to have the assurance of heaven for eternity! An evening of true worship.\n\nRock Spring, GA@\n\nCommunity Baptist Church\n\nDebbie\n\nJanuary 23rd 2023\n\nLove The Perrys! Christ-centered songs and worship. They give God and us 110% and I am thankful for their ministry. Scott Brand is such an anointed singer as are Jamie, Libby, and Jared. Will be seeing you guys again very soon!\n\nGreenville, SC@\n\nTruth Missionary Baptist Church\n\nBecky\n\nAugust 15th 2022\n\nThe concert was wonderful and a huge blessing to me it was exactly what I needed to hear that night. It was well worth my hour drive to the church to see them. I can't wait to see them again.\n\nLincolnton, NC@\n\nChurch of God of Lincolnton\n\nDavid\n\nJune 27th 2022\n\nThis was my first time to attend a Perry’s concert. The anointing was upon them. From the first song until the last one God’s presence was so real. Thank you for a wonderful evening.\n\nWilmington, NC@\n\nBrookfield Church of God\n\nElaine\n\nMay 30th 2022\n\nIt was a great night. They did a lot of songs from their new CD, like WARMIN’ UP, & SOUNDS LIKE HOME TO ME. Love the new lineup.\n\nJonesboro, GA@\n\nHarvest Baptist Tabernacle\n\nRuth Ann\n\nMay 28th 2022\n\nLibby was as great as ever! The new boys in the group were very good as well….especially the new tenor! Nice job you all!\n\nCrossville, TN@\n\nBible Baptist Church\n\nJeff\n\nFebruary 24th 2022\n\nIt was very good. Except the time was listed as starting at 7:00 when it started at 6:00. But, it was fine as they sang longer.\n\nBon Aqua Junction, TN@\n\nFirst Baptist Church\n\nDAve\n\nDecember 4th 2021\n\nMy Southern Gospel experience continues this time in “a little country Church” Belton, SC. Strong vocals and strong faith characterized the evening which included a Christmas song or two (no overkill). Libbi however stood out both passionate and personal. It brought me back to a simpler time when childlike faith was a reality. The sound mix was good, I was not disappointed!\n\nBelton, SC@\n\nDorchester Baptist Church\n\nTracey\n\nFebruary 17th 2020\n\nThey are such a blessing and inspiration to me. I am glad they came to town. It had been to long since I had seen them. Had a wonderful evening.\n\nCold Spring, KY@\n\nCold Spring First Baptist Church\n\nMichelle\n\nJanuary 12th 2019\n\nI always love the Perry’s. I got to see two groups I’ve never seen before, The Guardians and Triumphant Quartet. Although Triumphant Quartet’s been to my church, I had to work the day they came. It was an amazing night.\n\nMt Dora, FL@\n\nMount Dora Community Building\n\nNorie\n\nNovember 18th 2018\n\nThis was my 1st time seeing the perrys in concert and I pray I can do it again. They were simply amazing. Very spirit filled\n\nMeadowbrook, WV@\n\nJewel City Church\n\nMichelle\n\nNovember 5th 2016\n\nThe line up was Wilburn & Wilburn, The Perrys, and The Kingsmen. The Wilburns were amazing. I never heard of them, but was greatly surprised how much I liked them. The Perry's and The Kingsmen never disappoint. They were as usual, just truly amazing.\n\nMount Dora, FL@\n\nMt Dora Community Building\n\nView More Fan Reviews\n\nABOUT THE PERRYS\n\nIf you have ever seen The Perrys in concert, you have undou\n\nbtedly sensed the power and conviction with which they sing. From the high-octane, hand-clapping hit, \"I Wish I Could Have Been There,\" to the anointed anthem, \"If You Knew Him,\" the Dove Award-winning group has been delivering soul-stirring performances across North America for nearly five decades. Their sound, unmistakable. Their calling, unarguable. Their performances, unforgettable. Their joy, unspeakable.\n\nThe Perrys—Libbi Perry Stuffle, Jared Stuffle, Dayton Gay, and Jason Gordon—have forged a deep sense of unity. This is due, in part, to the fires through which they have walked over the last few years. After battling a longterm illness, Tracy Stuffle, Libbi's husband and Perrys' esteemed bass singer, passed away on February 4, 2018. With unparalleled determination, Libbi and her beloved group have continued to heed the call to carry the Gospel to the multitudes.\n\nLoved by gospel music fans around the world, The Perrys have earned many accolades over their illustrious career. In addition to their Dove Award for Song of the Year and countless Dove nominations, they have garnered numerous #1 songs and 15 Singing News Fan Awards, including the 3-time Favorite Mixed Group honor, 2-time Song of the Year, Favorite Album, as well as Libbi being named both a 2-time Female Vocalist of the Year and 9-time Favorite Alto of the Year.\n\nA career spanning fifty three years, their commitment to the calling of God upon their lives has never been greater. \"Now, more than ever,\" says Libbi, \"we want to share the good news of Jesus Christ in song.\" The Perrys are looking toward the future with great expectation. One cannot help but be affected by their story of tragedy and triumph. The Perrys are living proof that God can work all things both for our good and for His glory. \"Yes, life is tough,\" Libbi shares, \"and we all have battles—some we win and some we lose—but we can choose joy.\"\n\nIn the book of Nehemiah, we read that the joy of the Lord is our strength. The Perrys are living proof of this promise, and they are stepping into this new season of ministry still declaring God's faithfulness, still proclaiming His praises, and still choosing joy.\n\nShow More"
