        "text": "There is a time and season for everything…\n\nHuey L. Perry peacefully entered eternal rest on August 3, 2024. He was born and grew up in Moreauville, LA, in Avoyelles Parish. He was raised in a loving home with his six siblings by Christian parents, Adolph and Effie Perry. Dr. Perry graduated from Bethune High School in Marksville as Co-Valedictorian of his class (with Dr. Donald Prier). He graduated from Grambling College Magna Cum Laude and at the top of his class with a B.A. in Political Science. He became an Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity member as a Grambling student. He received his master’s degree and a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Chicago. Remarkably, neither Dr. Perry nor his parents, because of his exceptional academic record, ever incurred any direct expenses for his undergraduate and graduate education. His undergraduate education was funded by a four-year merit scholarship, which covered all his college expenses. Upon graduation from college, he received a fully funded Graduate Fellowship from the William H. Danforth Foundation to pursue his master’s and Ph.D. degrees.\n\nOver the course of his academic career, Dr. Perry taught at Chicago State University, Loyola University- Chicago; Texas A&M University, Bryan/College Station, Texas; and Southern University- Baton Rouge. Before serving as Dean of the School of Public Policy at Southern University from 1991 to 1996, he was Chair of the Political Science Department. After 31 years at the University, he retired in 2014 as Professor of Political Science, Chancellor’s Fellow, and Executive Director of the Institute for Research, Training and Public Service. In 2023, the SU Board of Supervisors awarded him the honor of Professor Emeritus.\n\nDr. Perry served as President of the National Conference of Black Political Scientists. He received two post-doctoral research awards: a Rockefeller Foundation Research Fellowship for Minority-Group Scholars and a Ford Foundation Fellowship for Minorities. Dr. Perry conducted research for the Rockefeller Foundation Postdoctoral at Southern University-Baton Rouge and the Ford Foundation Postdoctoral award at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Perry was a perfectionist as a Professor and Researcher who pushed and encouraged his students and research assistants to be and do their best. Dr. Perry mentored numerous students over the course of his academic career, who themselves have gone on to achieve distinguished careers in academia, the legal profession, philanthropy, and government service.\n\nDr. Perry had an extensive publication record, including two books: Blacks and the American Political System (co-edited with Dr. Wayne Parent, Professor of Political Science at LSU in Baton Rouge) and Race, Politics, and Governance in the United States - both books published by the University Press of Florida. Dr. Perry has published over 40 other publications, including book chapters, articles, and symposia. He also received several academic awards, including the Chancellor’s Faculty Excellence Award, the President’s Faculty Excellence Award, and the Elton C. Harrison Scholar of the Year Award. He also received two major grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF), which was a rarity for a Social Science Professor since NSF grants are predominantly awarded to Professors in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).\n\nDr. Perry leaves to cherish his memory his beloved wife of 52 years, Emma Bradford Perry, retired Professor and Dean of Libraries of Southern University, son, David Perry, grandson Tamion Perry, and great-granddaughter, Kynsley Perry. He is survived by two brothers, Earl Perry (Margie), Los Angeles, CA, and Chris Perry, Union City, California. He has four sisters-in-law, Gracie Bradford, Pearland, TX; Dorothy Dorsey, Lizzie Ferguson; and Cora Thompson, Ruston, LA. His son, Jeff Perry; his parents, Adolph and Effie Perry; siblings Robert, Gene, and Ray Perry; sister, Dorothy Drummer; and brother-in-law, Willie Bradford, are preceding him in death.\n\nHe also leaves a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, and many others to mourn his transition. Even though he is now at rest, his life inspired those he touched along the way, and his memory is a blessed benediction!"
