        "text": "On the scoresheet, love means nothing in tennis, but for the tennis-loving Perry family, love means everything.\n\nHendersonville High's McCollough Perry, who is the Bearcat girls tennis team's No. 1 singles player, is hoping to give the Bearcats their second straight state title, and this time around, she has her younger sister Eliza and her mom, Coach Lane Perry, along for the ride.\n\n\"I have been watching my girls develop differently through the years but the positive aspects of high school tennis have made them love the game even more,\" Lane Perry said. \"Tennis has always been a lonely sport and the team has given them a different sense of family.\"\n\nMcCollough Perry, now a senior, was the leader of last year's team that finished a perfect 19-0 en route to the 2-A team state title. She ended the season with a loss in the individual state singles championship, and it was her only defeat of the season, as she had a 30-1 record.\n\nHeading into Monday's match against East Henderson, the Bearcats were 4-0 and were on a 23-match winning streak. While the regular-season wins are important, the Perrys and the rest of the team have their eye on the main goal: A second straight team state title.\n\nWhile she's focused on the ultimate prize, McCollough Perry said she's happy to be playing with her younger sister and just happy to have a season, which was in question at the beginning of the 2020-21 school year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"We have enjoyed playing together this season and we are super excited for what the rest of the season is going to look like,\" McCollough Perry said. \"We are both extremely competitive but always joking with each other.\"\n\nEliza Perry said her and her sister play together all the time and that she's constantly learning new things from her older sister. While most siblings usually have a rivalry in sports, the Perry sisters don't, Eliza said.\n\n\"I don't think there is a rivalry, since McCollough is a stronger player than I am,\" Eliza Perry said. \" I actually look up to her as my role model in tennis. There has never been that overly-competitive aspect.\"\n\nEliza Perry is a newcomer on the team that returns just about every player that was on last year's state title team. The returners include junior Lindsay Bull, junior Olivia Pursley, junior Anna Trace and junior Anne Jones.\n\nDuring their state title run last year, Eliza Perry was there at the matches, cheering on her older sister and the rest of the team.\n\n\"Although this is my first season as a Bearcat, I have watched my sister's play on this team and had a close connection with the team,\" she said. \"But I definitely think this is the strongest team, and I'm just so excited that I get to have such a great first season.\"\n\nMcCollough Perry is also anxious to get the matches played and get to the postseason once again to make another strong run.\n\n\"I am super eager for this season, I believe we have one of the strongest teams in Bearcat history. We're training to win another title,\" she said.\n\nAnd this run for a team state championship will be one like no other. Due to the pandemic, the format was drastically changed by the North Carolina High School Athletic Association. This season, there will be no dual-team playoffs. Instead, there will be two individual tournaments for the postseason: Regionals (June 18-19) and state (June 25-26). Points will be awarded for each victory in each round at both tournaments to determine an overall team champion.\n\nDespite this new format, Coach Lane Perry still believes her girls have another strong shot to bring home a second straight state title plaque.\n\n\"The format is different this season for state but the girls, all with the team, are confident with hard work and a positive attitude they could win state,\" she said.\n\nAnd the coach knows whatever the outcome, it will always be a season her girls will always remember.\n\n\"I am very grateful that McCollough gets a season since this is her senior year, and having her sister there is a huge bonus. The girls are happy they are getting the chance to play together regardless of the season,\" she said."
