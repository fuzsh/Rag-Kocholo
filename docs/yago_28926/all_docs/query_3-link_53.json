Would love to pictures of her parents and brothers and sisters.\n\nThanks for starting this thread Marengo I was wondering about Paola's family in another thread. Would love to pictures of her parents and brothers and sisters.\n\nIt was actually after reading your post that I got this idea .\n\nHere an engagementpicture of Paola and Albert. Paola´s mother, Princess Luisa is there too, 3rd on the left.\n\nIt was actually after reading your post that I got this idea .\n\nHere an engagementpicture of Paola and Albert. Paola´s mother, Princess Luisa is there too, 3rd on the left.\n\nWho are the folks? Let me try, from the left to the right:\n\nThe King\n\nThe Princess de Réthy\n\nPrincess Marie-Christine of Belgium\n\nPrincess Marie-Esmeralda of Belgium\n\nDonna Luisa, the Dowager Duchess of Guardia Lombarda\n\nKing Léopold III\n\nDonna Paola dei Principi Ruffo di Calabria\n\nThe Prince of Liège\n\nPrince Alexander of Belgium\n\nAm I correct?\n\nHere an article dedicated to Paola's father, Don Fulco. It is from a who is who website concerning WWI.\n\nAccording to the caption this is a picture of Don Augusto Ruffo di Calabria, nephew of HM The Queen and a son of her eldest brother Don Fabrizio. Don Augusto has married a Princess zu Windisch-Graetz btw.\n\n--\n\nI believe you are right in the identification henri, though I always forget if Esmeralda or Marie-Christine is the older one.\n\nOne of her brothers died in WWII, right? On what side did he fall? Fighting with the Italians against the allies or later fighting with the Italians and Allies against the Germans?\n\nHe was fighting with the allies. As said here before by stephanievl, during the seabattle of Pescara. They never found his body.\n\nThe family of Queen Paola resisted the regime of Mussolini.\n\nQueen Paola was just a little girl at that time, but it was an impressive event for her, she hinted at a statevisit to Italy in 1998.\n\nAh, and Fulco is a public figure too? On television etc? I think I saw him pop up in several articles (one about the Italian Big Brother I believe), but as I don't understand a thing about Italian I have no idea what the article said.\n\nThis article mentions something about a Fulco Ruffo di Calabria but I don t understand Italian. To hope that the guy is Don Fulco would be too much sadly, as the only Fulco in Paola's family is 53.\n\nThe guy in the photos isn't Fulco. Fulco is older. He was married with Melba, who was an annoucer on tv, but they divorced many years ago. The article talks about the backing down of Fulco from the italian version of \"Survivors\" after his father death, Queen Paola's brother.\n\nI'm italian but I'm to be sincere.in italy this family isn't very famous,so I don't know any others members of the Ruffo's.\n\nArms according to branches\n\nThe Coat of Arms of the Ruffo di Calabria family, free of copyrights:\n\nThere are a few variations of the Ruffo arms according to branches. I am listing them below for others:\n\n1) Scilla branch: like the arms above.\n\n2) Palazzolo branch: like the arms above.\n\n3) Guardialombarda branch: like the arms above.\n\n4) S. Antimo branch : like the arms above, but minus the sea shells.\n\n5) Bagnara branch: like the arms above, but minus the sea shells.\n\n6) Scaletta branch: like the arms above, but minus the sea shells.\n\n7) Floresta branch: like the Scaletta branch, but completely surrounding the edge of the shield is a band of black and white checkerboard.\n\nI was wondering if anyone knows something about the relations between Queen Paola and his siblings, in particular with her late brother Fabrizio; I wonder because I remember to have read in an old newspaper article on the marriage of Paola's nephew Alessandro to Princess Mafalda of Savoy in 1994, and it said that Queen Paola didn't attend the wedding because the groom's parents (Prince Fabrizio and his former wife Maria) were divorced. Did this divorce influence so much Paola's relations with her brother, or was it just a sort of diplomatic matter perhaps, due to Paola is the Catholic Queen of the Belgians (and Catholic Church doesn't recognize divorce)?\n\nI know nothing about it, but i cant believe it would be considered a faux pas in Belgium if the Queen did attend a wedding of a divorced person. In fact, i imagine that public opinion would find it rather odd if she did NOT attend a wedding for that reason. It was probably just a clash of agena's. The queen seems to be pretty close to her Italian relatives. I remember seeing a documentary 'the voice of the queen', where the queen was in Rome for some public function and insisted that a niece (don't know which one) stayed on her side during the official part too. And several cousins of the Queen also spoke warmly about her n the documentary. Added to that, I believe a lot of Italian relatives attended the wedding f Philippe, nd the nice pearl earrings that princess Claire wore at her wedding were a gift from the Ruffo's too.\n\nYes relationship with Italian relatives is close, I know that also young generations are visiting in Belgium and Astrid's children are visiting some same age Italian cousins as well.\n\nThe queen also came in Italy for masses on her older sister burying place.\n\nMafalda of Aosta and Alessandro Ruffo di Calabria did marry in church since none of them was divorced, it was the groom's father that was. This can't be the real reason for which queen Paola didn't attend..\n\nCould the real reason be that public opinion don't like to see their sovereigns attending former ruling royal families' events?\n\nMafalda of Aosta and Alessandro Ruffo di Calabria did marry in church since none of them was divorced, it was the groom's father that was. This can't be the real reason for which queen Paola didn't attend..\n\nCould the real reason be that public opinion don't like to see their sovereigns attending former ruling royal families' events?\n\nI think, you're right, amedea -even if her relationship to her older brother had been somehow strained at that time, the queen wouldn't have burdened her nephew with it.\n\nWith regard to the \"former ruling royal families-problem\", I'm not sure -considering that there are some family ties between the Belgian royal family and the Savoy/Aosta family (king Albert II's aunt queen Marie-José of Italy and prince Lorenz's mother).\n\nHere is the article I was referring to (in Italian); it says that the Queen didn't attend because the wedding was hosted by the divorced parents of Alessandro, and the protocol and the rules of Catholic Church prevented her from attending. It also says that the groom's father, Paola's brother Fabrizio, didn't attend the wedding as well, because his second wife was not welcome by his former wife, Alessandro's mother.\n\nThere are a few variations of the Ruffo arms according to branches.
