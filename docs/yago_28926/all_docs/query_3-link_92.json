The Queen needs her rest following a medical examination this week, reports the Royal Palace of Belgium.\n\nMore specifics on the state of Paola's health were not given. The pair were meant to attend the Venice Biennale in early September, among other official engagements, but have had to cancel with immediate effect.\n\nPaola, who was queen of Belgium between 1993 and 2013, is 77 years old. In Belgium it is customary for rulers to retain their royal titles even after their reign has ended."
