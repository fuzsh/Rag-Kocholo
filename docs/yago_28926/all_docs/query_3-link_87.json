Even if you hadn't written that it was Albert and Paola \"in the seventies\" I think most people could've deduced that from the print of Paola's dress! (But she is very beautiful in it.)\n\nElizajane\n\nAristocracy\n\nJoined\n\nDec 2, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n128\n\nOriginally posted by Hannelore@May 2nd, 2004 - 9:30 am\n\nPaola and Albert in the seventies\n\nhttp://meta2.fotomarktplatz.de/image/layou...-02-05-1537.jpg\n\nPaola is so beautiful in this photo ~ and, her dress is quite gorgeous. It might be labeled as \"vintage\". Growing up, marriage and \"all\" which goes with it, having children ~ AND, ALL of which goes with THAT, can age any beautiful woman ... but, I feel the love she shares with her husband, (who has been in the not-so-good-news-lately), and the success of their children can be very rewarding. To me, she looks as though she has a \"tender heart\".\n\nElizajane\n\nasma\n\nAristocracy\n\nJoined\n\nNov 2, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n241\n\nCity\n\nshebeen\n\nCountry\n\nEgypt\n\nAlbert & Poala pics are gorgeous ,they realy seam in love.did they had arranged marriage or it was a love story?\n\nHannelore\n\nHeir Presumptive\n\nJoined\n\nDec 25, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n2,571\n\nCity\n\nBruges\n\nCountry\n\nBelgium\n\nThey were very much in love when they married, it certainly wasn't arranged. But after some years, there was a crisis in their marriage. Prince Albert was very often abroad with economic missions (like Filip today), while Paola stayed at home with the children.\n\nThey became estranged from each other (this is also the reason why Mathilde always accompanies Filip!). they both had several lovers, and Albert even had a child with another woman. They were planning a divorce, but eventually got back together through faith (it's said that princess Astrid introduced them to the charismatic movement, but I don't know if this is true).\n\nNow you can see they still love each other vey much. I think it's very nice they never divorced and were able to solve their problems after so many years!\n\nAlexandria\n\nHeir Apparent\n\nJoined\n\nJan 14, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n3,207\n\nCountry\n\nCanada\n\nOriginally posted by Hannelore@May 2nd, 2004 - 1:27 pm\n\nThey were planning a divorce, but eventually got back together through faith (it's said that princess Astrid introduced them to the charismatic movement, but I don't know if this is true).\n\nBy \"faith\" what do you mean? Do you mean religion in general?

(Paola, from Dolce Vita to Queen). There are some very interesting facts about her:\n\nshe once was refused to enter the St. Peter in Rome by wearing a miniskirt. And during a party in 1963 when the death of JFK was announced, she said: \"Dommage, pour une fois oú l'on s'amusait bien.\" . She almost caused a diplomatic scandal...\n\nAnd also, in the book there was something about her secret relation with singer Salvator Adamo, who wrote the song 'Dolce Paola' about the young princess..."
