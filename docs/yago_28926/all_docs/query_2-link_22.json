        "text": "Former Belgian King Albert II has admitted he is the father of a woman born from an affair, after he was forced to give a DNA test which came back positive.\n\nHe had been fighting the paternity claim by Belgian artist Delphine BoÃ«l, 51, for more than a decade.\n\nHe lost his immunity from prosecution after he abdicated in 2013 due to ill health.\n\nMs BoÃ«l's lawyer said the admission from the former king was a \"relief\".\n\nIn a statement released on Monday, the ex-king's lawyers said he had \"learnt the results of the DNA test... [and] the scientific conclusions indicate that he is the biological father of Mrs Delphine BoÃ«l\".\n\nThe lawyers said the 85-year-old had decided to halt the legal battle, which had dragged on since 2013, and he now \"accepts Delphine BoÃ«l becomes his fourth child\"."
