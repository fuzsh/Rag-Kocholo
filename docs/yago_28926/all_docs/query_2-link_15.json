        "text": "Albert II (born 6 June 1934) is a member of the Belgian royal family who reigned as King of the Belgians from 9 August 1993 to 21 July 2013.\n\nAlbert II is the son of King Leopold III and the last living child of Queen Astrid, born a princess of Sweden. He is the younger brother of the late Grand Duchess of Josephine-Charlotte of Luxembourg and King Baudouin, whom he succeed following Baudouin's death in 1993.\n\nHe married Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria (now Queen Paola), with whom he had three children.\n\nAlbert's eldest son, Philippe, is the current King of the Belgians.\n\nOn 3 July 2013, King Albert II attended a midday session of the Belgian cabinet. He then announced that, on 21 July Belgian National Day, he would abdicate the throne for health reasons.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Philippe on 21 July 2013. Albert II was the fourth monarch to abdicate in 2013, following Pope Benedict XVI, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, and Emir Hamad bin Khalifa of Qatar. In so doing, he was also the second Belgian monarch to abdicate, following his father Leopold III who abdicated in 1951, albeit under very different in circumstances.\n\nEarly Life\n\nPrince Albert was born in Stuyvenberg Castle, Brussels, as the second son and youngest child of King Leopold III and his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden. He was second in line to the throne at birth, and was given the title Prince of Liege.\n\nQueen Astrid died in a car accident on 29 August 1935, in which King Leopold was lightly injured but survived, when Prince Albert was one year old. The King remarried to Mary Lilian Baels (later became Princes of Rethy) in 1941. The couple produced three children: Prince Alexandre, Princess Marie-Christine and Princess Marie-Esmeralda (who is also Albert's goddaughter). Albert and his siblings had a close relationship with their stepmother and they called her \"Mother.\"\n\nDuring World War II, on 10 May 1940, at the time when Belgium was being invaded, Prince Albert, his elder sister Princess Josephine-Charlotte and his elder brother Prince Baudouin, left the country for France and later Spain. The Prince and the Princess returned to Belgium on 2 August 1940. They continued their studies until 1944, either at Laeken, or at the Castle of Ciergnon in the Ardennes. In June 1944, at the time of the Allied landings, King Leopold, his wife Princess Lilian and the royal children were deported by the Germans to Hirschstein, Germany, and later to Strobl, Austria, where they were liberated by the American Army on 7 May 1945. Owing to the political situation in Belgium, King Leopold and his family moved to the villa \"Le Reposoir\" in Pregny, Switzerland, when they left Austria in October 1945 and stayed until July 1950. During that time, Prince Albert would continue his education in a secondary school in Geneva. King Leopold III, accompanied by Prince Baudouin and Prince Albert, returned to Belgium on 22 July 1950.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nIn 1958, Albert went to the Vatican to witness the coronation of Pope John XXIII. At a reception at the Belgian Embassy, he met Italian Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria. Prince Albert proposed marriage to her, to which she accepted. Two months after their meeting, the prince introduced his future wife to his family, and four months later to the press. The couple were married on 2 July 1959, one-and-a-half years before Albert's older brother, the king, got married (a marriage which would prove childless). Albert and Paola have three children, twelve grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Their children are: King Philippe (born 15 April 1960 at Belvedere Castle), Princess Astrid (born 5 June 1962 at Belvedere Castle), Prince Laurent (born 19 October 1963 at Belvedere Castle)\n\nDelphine Boel\n\nIn 1997, the Belgian satirical magazine Pere Ubu reported that the Belgian sculptor Delphine Boel (born in 1968) was King Albert II's extramarital daughter. It took some years for the Belgian mainstream media to report this news.\n\nAccording to Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, the mother of Delphine, she and Albert shared an 18-year-long relationship into which Delphine was born.\n\nIn June 2013, Boel summoned the then King and his two older children (the then Duke of Brabant and the Archduchess of Austria-Este) to appear in court. She hoped to use DNA tests to prove that she is the King's daughter. As the King enjoyed complete immunity under the law, Boel decided to summon his elder children as well. The king abdicated the following month, in July 2013. After the King's abdication, Boel abandoned her first suit to introduce a second one only against the former King as he was no longer protected by immunity and the first claim would have been judged according to the situation at the time of the introduction of the claim.\n\nIn March 2017, the Court ruled that her claim was unfounded, and her lawyers said she would take the claim to appeal. On 25 October 2018, the Court of Appeal decided that Delphine Boel is not a descendant of Jacques Boel, and ordered King Albert to undergo DNA testing. His lawyer announced that he would seek further advice about a possible referral to Belgium's Court of Cassation/ Hof van Cassatie. In 2019, the King's lawyer confirmed he would not provide a DNA sample in the case.\n\nOn 2019 May 2019, it was reported by CNN that Albert II had submitted a DNA sample after a Belgian court ruled on 16 May that he would be fined 5,000 euros for each day that he failed to do so, although994 he would continue to challenged the ruling, according to his attorney, Alain Berenboom.\n\nThe results of these DNA samples were released on 27 January 2020 by Alain Berenboom, confirming Delphine Boel as Albert's II's daughter. Albert II confirmed this on 27 January 2020 in a press release.\n\n\"The king will treat all his children as equal,\" Berenboom said, according to VTM News. \"King Albert now has four children.\"\n\nWhile it was proven that Boel was biological daughter, her legal status as a daughter was not recognized until a 1 October 2020 ruling of the Brussels Court of Appeal, which also recognized Boel as a princess of Belgium and granted her the new surname of Saxe-Coburg.\n\nOfficial Role\n\nAs the younger brother of the childless King Baudouin, Prince Albert was the heir-presumptive to the throne.\n\nAlbert's son Philippe was groomed to eventually succeed.\n\nOn Baudouin's death, Albert was sworn in before parliament, on 9 August 1993, as King the Belgians.\n\nAs King, Albert's duties included representing Belgium at home and abroad on state visits, trade missions, and at high level international meetings as well as taking an interest in Belgian society, culture and enterprise.\n\nIn 1984, he set up the Prince Albert Foundation, to promote expertise in foreign trade.\n\nThe King had a constitution role which came into play in 2010-2011 when Belgium's parliament was unable to agree on a government. When the crisis was resolved, Albert swore in the new government.\n\nAlbert sparked controversary in his December 2012 Christmas speech by comparing modern \"populist movements\" with those of the 1930s. This was seen by several political commentators, as well as many Flemish politicians, as aimed implicitly at the large Flemish nationalist party, the N-VA. Bart De Wever, the party's leader, called for the King's role in the formation of Belgian governments to be changed in the wake of this comment since he \"could no longer see the monarch as playing the constitutional role of referee.\"\n\nAbdication\n\nOn 3 July 2013, 79-year-old King Albert II attended a midday session of the Belgian cabinet, where he revealed his intention to abdicate to Prime Minster Elio Di Rupo and to the deputy prime minsters. This came less than one month after the king and two of his children had been asked to appear in court by the Belgian sculptor Delphine Boel, who was intent on proving that the king was her biological father. According to a letter sent by the King to the Prime Minister and dated 3 July 2013, and which was made public, the King had already broached the topic of his intention to abdicate several times with the Prime Minister, who had asked him to reconsider it. At 6 PM (CET) the King announced in a recorded radio and television speech that on 21 July, Belgium's National Day, he would abdicate the throne for health reasons. He was succeeded by his elder son, Philippe.\n\nAfter his abdication on 21 July 2013 it was decided that he would be styled as His Majesty King Albert, the same form of address granted to his father, Leopold III, after his abdication.\n\nBelgium Honors\n\n-1993-2013: Sovereign of the Order of Leopold\n\n-1993-2013: Sovereign of the Order of the African Star (dormant), Order of the Lion (dormant), Order of the Crown and the Order of Leopold II\n\nHonours\n\n-Argentina: Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Liberator General San Martin\n\n-Austria: Grand Star of the Decoration of Honor for Services to the Republic of Austria (1958)\n\n-Bulgaria: Grand Cross of the Order of the Balkan Mountains (2003)\n\n-Cameroon: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit\n\n-Colombia: Grand Cross of the Order of Boyaca\n\n-Ecuador: Grand Collar of the National Order of San Lorenzo\n\n-Estonia: Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana (5 June 2008)\n\n-Finland: Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the White Rose (1996)\n\n-Gabon: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit\n\n-Vatican: Knight Grand Cross with the Collar of the Order of Pope Pius IX\n\n-Iceland: Grand Cross of the Order of the Falcon (16 October 1979)\n\n-Italy: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (29 October 1973)\n\n-Lithuania: Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Vytautas the Great (16 March 2006)\n\n-Malaysia: Honorary Grand Commander of the Most Esteemed Order of the Defender of the Realm\n\n-Mexico: Collar of the Order of the Aztec Eagle\n\n-Monaco: Grand Cross of the Order of Saint-Charles (13 October 1957)\n\n-Norway: Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav (1964)\n\n-Peru: Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun of Peru, Special Class\n\n-Poland: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland\n\n-Portugal: Grand Cross of the Military Order of Aviz (11 December 1985), Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry (13 December 1999),\n\n-Romania: Collar of the Order of the Star of Romania (2009)\n\n-Senegal: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit\n\n-South Korea: Grand Gwanghwa Medal (1st Class) of the Order of Diplomatic Service Merit\n\n-Spain: Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece (16 September 1994), Knight Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Charles III (15 November 1977)\n\n-Tunisia: Grand Cross of the Order of the Republic\n\n-Venezuela: Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Liberator\n\nDynastic Honors\n\n-Ethiopian Imperial Family: Grand Cordon with Collar of the Imperial Order of the Queen of Sheba\n\nHonorary Degrees\n\n-King Albert II is Doctor Honoris Causa of:\n\n-the Catholic University of Leuven\n\n-Saint Louis University, Baguio City\n\n-Ghent University\n\n-the Free University of Brussels\n\n-the Catholic university of Mons\n\n-the Polytechnic Faculty of Mons\n\nEponym\n\n-Boulevard du Roi Albert II/Koning Albert II-Iaan, Brussels\n\n-Boulevard Prince de Liege/Prince of Luiklaan, Brussels\n\n-Institute King Albert II, University hospital of Saint-Luc\n\nHouse: Belgium\n\nReligion: Roman Catholic\n\n(https://en.wikipedia.org)\n\nTitles and Styles\n\n6 June 1934-7 June 1934 His Royal Highness Prince Albert of Belgium\n\n7 June 1934-9 August 1993: His Royal Highness The Prince of Liege\n\n9 August 1993-21 July 2013: His Majesty The King of the Belgians\n\n21 July 2013-present: His Majesty King Albert II of Belgium"
