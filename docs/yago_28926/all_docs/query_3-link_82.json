        "text": "Queen Paola of Belgium attends King Albert's abdication\n\nThe Belgian Royal Palace has denied reports that somebody broke into a property owned by Queen Paola in France on Friday morning. French newspaper Le Parisien claimed that the Queen's apartment in Paris was burgled with “several millions of euros worth of jewellery and leather goods” being stolen.\n\nAccording to the publication, the break in occurred in Parc Monceau, a wealthy area of the city in the eighth arrondissement.\n\nHowever, the newspaper later backtracked on the story saying there was “ambiguity about the identity” of the apartment.\n\nThe Belgian Royal Palace told Belgian news agency Belga that the Queen doesn't have an apartment in that part of the French capital.\n\nThey said: “The original article from ‘Le Parisien’ that linked the theft to an apartment belonging to the Queen is therefore incorrect.”\n\nAccording to the website Paudal, French police were alerted by a silent alarm.\n\nAlthough the thieves had already left by the time the police arrived, several bits of Jewellery were found in the courtyard near the apartment.\n\nSpecialised French police officers are currently investigating the break-in attempting to find traces of fingerprints.\n\nTuscany born Queen Paola is the daughter of an Italian World War One flying ace Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda.\n\nREAD MORE: Should Prince Charles make Edward the Duke of Edinburgh POLL\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
