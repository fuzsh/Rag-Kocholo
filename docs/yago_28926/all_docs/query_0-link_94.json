        "text": "Thousands of well-wishers turned out in Liège, Belgium this morning to get once last look and to say thank you to Their Majesties King Albert II and Queen Paola of Belgium who ended their three-day farewell tour.\n\nThe reigning couple’s first stop was the Opéra Royal de Wallonie where they were warmly greeted by opera staff. After a tour of the newly renovated opera house Their Majesties then made their way to the Town Hall. Along the way, the reigning couple shook hands with people who lined the streets to see their king and queen.\n\nUpon their arrival at the Town Hall Their Majesties stepped out onto the balcony where thousands of people clapped and cheered. Overcome with emotion Her Majesty soon began to cry as the crowd chanted Merci! Merci! Merci!\n\nSoon, King Albert and Queen Paola were ushered back into the Town Hall where local officials hosted a reception in Their Majesties honor.\n\nClick the links below to watch videos:"
