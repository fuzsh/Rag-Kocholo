        "text": "Three years ago, sculptor and painter Princess Delphine proved that Albert, the former King of Belgium, was her father. Following ‘nasty’ court battles, Delphine won the right to be called ‘princess’ and officially recognise her royal lineage. The 2020 paternity test revealed one of the biggest royal scandals of the generation, and what Delphine had known for years: that King Albert II had fathered an illegitimate child whilst married to Queen Paola. Delphine was the product of the 18-year-long affair between her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and the then King of Belgium, beginning when he was crown prince in 1966. Delphine only discovered her true father’s identity at the age of 17, having previously assumed – as one does – that Jonkheer Jacques Boël, her mother's husband and a wealthy industrialist, was her father.\n\nRead More\n\nCopy Kate? Princess Delphine of Belgium sparks furore in dress channelling the Princess of Wales\n\nPrincess Delphine of Belgium, the illegitimate daughter of King Albert II, wore the design to Belgium’s National Day\n\nThe King initially vehemently denied the validity of the statements, before choosing to abdicate in 2013 in order to divert a constitutional crisis regarding his paternity test refusals. His son Philippe – Delphine’s half brother – then ascended to the throne. Delphine suffered much scrutiny and mocking during her campaign to prove that Albert really was her father, despite the King himself reportedly calling her to yell: ‘You are not my daughter!’ It seems, however, that she very much is.\n\nIn an interview with Tatler in 2022, Delphine stated that 'the King left me to the dogs but now he sends flowers’. Now, she’s asking for more than floral tributes. Having won the right to be called Princess Delphine, and being lawfully recognised as King Albert’s daughter in 2020, she is now fighting for more regal rights. Her lawyer has written to the prime minister of Belgium, asking that his client be treated with the same ‘respect’ as her half siblings, Astrid and Laurent – the King’s full siblings. This includes being invited to state occasions en général, rather than just Belgian National Day and state funerals. In a dramatic statement, Delphine’s lawyer declared that she had been ‘worried for months about her role in official events.’\n\nIn response, the prime minister said that ‘the people who are invited to these events are people who have official functions in our country. Part of the royal family has an official function.’ Before pointing out simply that ‘Princess Delphine does not have one.’\n\nPrincess Delphine and her lawyer have expressed that the mission is not a financial one, insisting that it’s about receiving appropriate pomp, not cash. It seems, for now, that Delphine will have to survive with labels, whilst she continues to campaign for more concrete evidence of a royally warm acceptance by her family."
