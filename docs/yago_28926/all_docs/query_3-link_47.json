        "text": "For years, Delphine Boël, an artist, fought to be recognized as the daughter of the former Belgian monarch, King Albert II.\n\nOn Sunday, in what seemed to mark a major turning point in a relationship marred by years of strife, scandal, legal battles and paternity tests, Ms. Boël, 52, who was awarded the right to use the royal title Princess Delphine this month, formally met with her father and his wife, Queen Paola.\n\nA statement jointly issued by Princess Delphine, King Albert II, 86, and Queen Paola, 83, said their meeting had opened a new chapter “full of emotion, understanding and, also, hope.”\n\nThe statement was accompanied by a picture of the three sitting in front of fireplace, a plate of cookies in front of them, paintings and family photos dotting the walls.\n\n“After the tumult, the wounds and the suffering, comes the time of forgiveness, healing and reconciliation,” the statement read. “This is the patient, sometimes difficult path that we have decided to take resolutely together. These first steps pave the peaceful course which it is now up to us to pursue.”\n\nKing Albert II, who abdicated the throne in 2013, spent decades denying that he had fathered a child outside his marriage, despite reports that he had an affair with a baroness. A prolonged legal battle forced him to finally acknowledge the princess as his daughter earlier this year.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
