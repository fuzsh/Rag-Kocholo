        "text": "Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria was once heralded as one of Europe's most beautiful women; her beauty and style were described as being on par with Grace Kelly. Throughout the 1960s and 70s she was followed relentlessly by photographers, eager to capture her beauty. But beyond her appearance Paola, as she was known, was also a target for the paparazzi because she was born into Italian nobility.\n\nPaola was born in Rome in Sept 1937 and spent her entire youth in the Italian capital, where she completed her secondary education in Latin and Greek. By her early 20s she was already known as \"one of the most beautiful women in Europe\". There was no shortage of male suitors but in 1958, at the age of 21, Paola met her future husband, Prince Albert of Belgium, and her fate was sealed.\n\nPaola and the prince\n\nThe pair were officially introduced at an event at the Belgium embassy to celebrate the coronation of Pope John XXIII.\n\nPaola later said of Prince Albert, \"We were both shy, so we only talked a little.\" But they were clearly deeply smitten and managed to keep their love alive as a long-distance romance, before marrying in July 1959.\n\nThe nuptials went ahead despite narrowly avoiding an international scandal: the Belgian royal family wanted a Vatican wedding, with a blessing by the Pope. But the Belgian government wanted the royal wedding to take place in Belgium.\n\nAs a compromise, the royal family decided Paola and Prince Albert would marry in a morning civil service in the throne room of the Royal Palace in Brussels, followed by a religious ceremony in the Cathedral of St Michael and St Gudula, later that afternoon.\n\nAlbert was not expected to become King of Belgium but was forced to take the role when his elder brother King Baudouin died, making Paola the sixth Queen Consort of the Belgians.\n\nPaola was a very popular Queen, devoted to protecting Belgium's heritage, as well as caring for three children; Philippe (who became King in 2013 when Albert abdicated) Princess Astrid and Prince Laurent.\n\nYet the marriage was no fairy tale. The relationship was said to have gone downhill in the late 1960s and, more recently, it's been plagued with drama over the King's love child Delphine, who fought for her right to be recognised as the King's daughter. Let's take a look at the sex scandal that rocked the Belgium royal family.\n\nA scandal unfolds\n\nWriter Mario Danneels was only sixteen when he started researching a biography of Queen Paola. Due to his age, most people didn't take him seriously and assumed he was writing for a school project; even though he'd told everybody he interviewed that he already had a publisher and was writing a book.\n\nDanneels told Vanity Fair, \"I got talking to people who normally never would have talked to a journalist—for example, the private priests of the king and queen who would actually go to the royal palace to say mass. They just saw me as a cute little boy, I suppose, who admired the queen. I got access to all these people journalists and authors wouldn't have gotten access to. A lot of people told me too much as well as a result.\"\n\nIt was no secret that the royal marriage was in trouble. In the 1960s, rumours started circulating as Albert began travelling alone. There were whispers that there were extra marital affairs going on, on both sides. It's believed divorce papers were drawn up.\n\nAccording to Danneels, Albert and Paola lived in different areas of Belvédère Castle. Albert's elder brother, King Baudouin, had apparently told the couple that if they divorced, Paola would lose her title and her allowance. So it appeared the couple was \"stuck together\" whether they wanted to stay married or not.\n\nAs he was researching his book, Danneels managed to score an interview with a palace insider who told him, \"Everyone knows Albert has a daughter with another woman.\"\n\nBut rather than spill the beans in the book, Danneels and his publisher decided to drop a hint instead. He told Vanity Fair, \"It was even a bit cryptic, but it was enough to unleash what it did.\"\n\nWhat exactly did the book unleash?\n\nWhen Danneels' book was published, what he'd hoped would be a tribute to Queen Paola instead became the focus of the love child scandal – a scandal that was an \"open secret\" within the Belgian media.\n\nBritish newspaper The Times headlined the story with \"Love Child of Belgian King Living in London.\"\n\nAlbert eventually made a reference to the scandal in his annual Christmas address: \"The queen and I have thought of the crisis that we went through, now 30 years ago. This crisis was highlighted recently. We wish not to go into this much deeper, it's part of our private life.\"\n\nHis statement was widely interpreted as acknowledgement of his extramarital affair.\n\nThe love child\n\nIn 2013, 45-year-old Delphine Boël began a six year court battle to prove that 85-year-old Albert was her biological father. During the legal battle, Albert repeatedly refused to acknowledge that he was her father and refused to take a DNA test.\n\nDelphine, a Belgium artist, made it clear she was not taking action for financial gain, as she was already born into wealth through her mother's family. Delphine had told the court she'd always known Albert was her father and claimed that he even had a childhood nickname for her; \"papillon\", or butterfly.\n\nDelphine's mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, was romantically involved with Albert for at least 15 years, while he was married to Paola. But, when Albert became King, in 1993, he distanced himself from Sybille and Delphine so as not to risk a royal scandal.\n\nHowever, when Albert abdicated in 2013, forfeiting his immunity from prosecution, Delphine took the chance to file a lawsuit seeking official recognition as his daughter.\n\nAs the court battle dragged on, Albert eventually agreed to submit to a DNA test in May 2019, proving that Delphine is his biological daughter, just as she'd always claimed.\n\nInitially it was believed Dephine wouldn't be allowed to take any royal titles, though she would be able to one day inherit some of Albert's fortune.\n\nBut just last week she won a legal battle over her rights to a royal title and will furthermore be officially known as Princess of Belgium.\n\nThe Brussels Court of Appeal ruled that, as the king's biological daughter, she is entitled to the same rights and royal titles as her father's other three children.\n\nMs Boël will now change her last name to that of her father \"Saxe Cobourg\". Her children will also become Princess and Prince of Belgium.\n\nAs for Paola, she has kept a dignified silence throughout the ordeal. In 2007, she gave an interview to a Belgium TV program to mark her 70th birthday.\n\nThe reclusive Belgian queen mother alluded to the love child scandal saying, \"We've had our problems. But now we both say that we were meant for each other. We are very happy now.\""
