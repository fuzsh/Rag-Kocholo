        "text": "The love child of the former Belgian King Albert II is hoping a court will grant her the same rights and titles as her father's legitimate children.\n\nArtist Delphine Boël, 52, has taken her case to the appeals court in Brussels.\n\nKing Albert finally admitted he was Ms Boël's father in January this year, having fought her paternity claim for more than a decade.\n\nHer mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, claims she had an 18-year affair with Albert before he was king.\n\nRumours of an illegitimate child first emerged in 1999 in an unauthorised biography about Albert's wife Queen Paola, prompting a royal scandal and enduring media gossip in Belgium.\n\nMs Boël first alleged on the record that King Albert was her biological father during a 2005 interview, but it was not until he abdicated in 2013 - when he lost his immunity to prosecution - that she opened court proceedings.\n\nHer lawyer said on Thursday that she was seeking the same rights as Albert's three other children, Philippe, now King of Belgium, Prince Laurent and Princess Astrid.\n\n\"Delphine's position isn't that she wants or doesn't want to be princess,\" said Marc Uyttendaele.\n\n\"She doesn't want to be a cut-price child, she wants to have exactly the same privileges, titles and capacities as her brothers and her sister.\"\n\nReports suggest her children would also be eligible for a royal title if the court rules in her favour.\n\nAlbert's lawyer says she can only be given the title \"princess\" by royal decree, not by a court.\n\nBaroness Longchamps says the affair with the then Prince Albert of Liège lasted between 1966 and 1984, and he was a presence during Ms Boël's childhood.\n\nFollowing his older brother's death in 1993 at 62, Albert unexpectedly came to the throne.\n\nHe held the position until July 2013, when he announced his abdication - citing ill health - and was replaced by his son, Philippe.\n\nThe 86-year-old had resisted court orders to undergo DNA testing until he was facing fines of €5,000 per day (£4,611; $5,918, at current exchange rates) for refusing to do so.\n\nIn January, he announced he accepted Ms Boël as his fourth child after he \"learnt the results of the DNA tests\".\n\nMr Uyttendaele said at the time the admission was a \"relief\" for Ms Boël. \"Her life has been a long nightmare because of this quest for identity,\" he told RTL television.\n\nBelgium has a constitutional monarchy in which the king plays a largely ceremonial role.\n\nWho is King Albert II?"
