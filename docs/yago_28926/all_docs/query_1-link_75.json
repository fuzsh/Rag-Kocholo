        "text": "During a private visit to Russia, Her Majesty Queen Paola of Belgium visited the Mikhailovsky Theatre. After a short tour of the theatre with General Director Vladimir Kekhman, the Queen attended a rehearsal of the ballet Madrigal.\n\nArtistic Director Nacho Duato was rehearsing with pupils from the Vaganova Academy, who are preparing to present his composition at the Mikhailovsky Theatre Grand Prix. Queen Paola was full of admiration for the way the young dancers performed the complex modern choreography so professionally and expressively, and remarked on the atmosphere of mutual trust and respect that underpinned the maestro’s work with his pupils.\n\nIn welcoming the Queen, Nacho Duato recalled with great pleasure the years he spent in Brussels studying under Maurice Béjart. The Queen was interested to learn about the progress of the choreographer’s work on his new version of The Sleeping Beauty , and expressed her certainty of it being a captivating production.\n\nThe Queen took note of the historical interior of the auditorium, being particularly interested in the ceiling painting Victory of Enlightenment and Sciences over the Dark Forces of Ignorance.\n\nAt the end of her visit, Queen Paola left a note of thanks in the theatre’s honoured visitors’ book.\n\nPaola Ruffo di Calabria is the queen consort, wife of King Albert II of Belgium. Under the Belgian Constitution, the Queen has no official responsibilities. However, she takes an active part in public life and assists her husband in carrying out his representative duties. Queen Paola accompanies her husband on official visits, attends official ceremonies and receptions, and participates in cultural activities, organizing concerts and exhibitions.\n\nQueen Paola devotes particular attention to helping young people from poor sections of society. In 1992 the Queen Paola Foundation was set up to provide support to organizations working with young people facing problems, and help them reintegrate into society, find jobs, receive education and avoid relapsing into harmful behaviour. Queen Paola is also the honorary president of Child Focus, an organization engaged in searching for missing children all over the world."
