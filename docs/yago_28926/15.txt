The religious ceremony was held at the Cathedral of Saint Michael and Saint Gudula, and was conducted by Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Rooey, Primate of Belgium. After exchanging their vows and rings, the Cardinal gave an address in which he referred to Paola as “a lovely princess”, and told her that “Italy sends you to Belgium as a ray of its beautiful sun and a reflection of its ardent soul.” The couple were read a message from the Pope before the final blessing, and then processed out of the cathedral to be met with tremendous cheers from the crowds gathered outside.
