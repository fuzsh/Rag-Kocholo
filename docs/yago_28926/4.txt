The couple's marriage was in trouble by the 1970s and Albert fathered a daughter by Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, named Delphine. Despite starting divorce negotiations at the time, the couple remained marriage, and reconciled in the 1980s, celebrating it with a new symbolic wedding ceremony.
