        "text": "\"Somewhere in Palilula\" tells the story of Serafim, a fresh graduate of a medical school, in 60's Romania. He is brought by destiny to the strange town of Palilula. Nowhere, that is. Palilula is a ghost town, lost in the middle of the Wallachia. A quarantine area, a sanatorium, an improbable hospital, a gynecological clinic in a settlement where no child is born. A small community of fools, lazies, sluts, vagabonds with angel's hearts is living under the sun in a sweet innocent unconsciousness. A community of Romanians who forgot their language, but not the nostalgia of their traditional music. Romanians with Danubian taste and disorientation. The young doctor Serafim will not get to practice his profession in this childless town. He will be drowning in the sweet and poisoned honey of the place, like a fly caught by a frog.\n\nOn a rainy day, two guys arrive in a small village with film and a projector in their car. No one from the village comes to meet them. What happened? Who are they? The not knowing relays no small amount of interest at times through tension as in a horror movie, and at times through compassionate laughter.\n\nOut of enthusiasm, a Militia soldier abandons his platoon and decides to fight for the cause of the Revolution. His Lieutenant and the rest of the crew look for him during the confused night of 22-23 December 1989.\n\nOn his spring break at the seaside, with his wife and his four year old son, Bogdan Ciocazanu runs into his best friends from high-school at the precise date and time that reminds all of them of their most glorious drinking trips and sexual escapades of their younger days. Frustrated that, between his job and his family, time is no longer his to manage and play with, Boogie now takes his shock dosage of freedom and spends a night to tick off all the items on the map of his youth (drinking, games, flirting, prostitutes). In the morning, after the disillusionment of the remake he experiences with his former friends, he returns to his wife.\n\nIn 1911-12, the Romanian movie director Grigore Brezianu and the financial tycoon Leon Popescu made together the 2 hours long movie \"Romania's Independence\" - an as faithful as possible screen adaptation of the real Independence War that had been fought in 1877. Now, \"Restul e tacere\" tells us, in a loose and half-fictionalized way, the story of this movie making.\n\n3 separate stories take place over two days. The characters' paths intersect, and they affect each-other unintentionally. The three stories are united not only by the characters but also by re-readings of the same theme at different registers.\n\nThomas, a famous director at the peak of his career, is obsessed with a beloved woman and creative issues. He wants to make a film of his life and have the love of his life beside him.\n\nTacke, an old graveyard digger, finds out he has only two months left to live. This is the moment he discovers he does want something out of life: a glamorous funeral service in the cemetery's « downtown » area, where he had spotted for a long time an splendidly situated burial site. Everything goes smoothly, especially that the town's luxury funeral home has just acquired Lady Di's hearth. Tacke has some money for the funeral ceremony, he also has some friends who would mourn for him, but he is out of luck: the funeral site he was hoping to acquire was just given to somebody else.\n\nTwo reasonably young girls want to leave their home town and go to work abroad. However, their dreams are quickly shattered by the cold truth of reality and they find out that every dream must have its cost."
