Choyke and Daniella E. Bar-Yosef Mayer\n\nBeads are commonly defined as being small ornaments perforated through their centers and small enough to be worn on the body. Beads sewn on clothing, parts of composite body decoration from anklets, to bracelets, to girdles, to necklaces and to headbands may be identical or mixed in their size, shape and raw material (Dubin 2009). Beads can be strung in a series on a thread, sewn individually onto clothing, or traded as separate objects that can be counted. They can be dismantled from garments and body ornaments and shared between individuals or given from the living to the dead as part of burial ritual. Pendants are a type of bead that is perforated at one or both ends rather than symmetrically through the middle (Kenoyer 1991). They also can be part of a series of similar objects strung together on a filament of sorts or one of a kind, meant to be accentuated in a special way. For anyone seriously studying beads, especially with the archaeological material, there is a frustration that most papers dealing with all their various manifestations tend to be scattered in isolated articles. This disarticulated publication record makes it particularly hard to see past the huge diversity of beads and bead use throughout human history. It becomes almost impossible to see patterning of any sort in the way humankind treated with this kind of ornamentation during its long history down to the present day. Theoretical modelling for tackling bead studies becomes extremely difficult and methodologies continue to be invented and re-invented. Consensus is virtually non-existent because of this lack of any sort of serious academic forum, at least within the world of archaeology. This volume of collected articles is intended to bring together specialists from diverse backgrounds and intellectual approaches, working on geographically separated bead material from the deep past as well as more\n\nhistoric material. The volume is intended to continue and reinforce a serious dialogue between practitioners. The approaches found here are all different but the intent is remarkably uniform. The authors all strive to understand the social forces at work behind the technical strategies, utilization and re-utilization of ornamentation in their particular part of the world and time period. Beadwork in all its many and diverse manifestations, is a craft involving the creation of planar decoration on a flexible surface such as hide or textile clothing or bands from uniting many beads, often of identical size but also frequently of varying size and shape (Hector 2005). These beads can be sewn, twined, plaited, woven, netted into or glued onto the foundation surface. Designs are created through size, color and texture and the methods used to bring them together. Juxtapositions of beads from particular raw materials may embody their own meanings. Beads, beadwork and other kinds of personal ornaments (henceforth beads) are among the earliest known symbolic expressions of modern humans and represent an important tool for identification of thinking and cognition in archaeological sciences. Over the past decade, it has become clear that beads first appear within the material culture “package” of early modern humans as early as 100,000 years ago (e.g. Bar-Yosef Mayer 2005; Vanhaeren et al. 2006). Fowler (2004: 40, 75) has pointed out that the fractal nature of beads, whether in beadwork patterns or in necklaces, other dress ornaments or sewn on clothing, means they can be assembled and reassembled, divided, shared and merged to create and embody a variety of social relationships between individuals in different social contexts. The ability to think in an abstract manner tells us about the development of modern human cognitive processes\n\n2\n\nAlice M. Choyke and Daniella E. Bar-Yosef Mayer\n\nconnected to social complexity and, perhaps, the intensity of human-to-human interaction in emerging and developing social groups. Through their raw materials, color, size and shape, body ornaments can signal identity between groups or social status and rank within a group (e.g. Kuhn 2014; Malafouris 2003). Beads are meant to be seen, heard, touched, divided and shared. They send signals directed at a particular audience who are capable of interpreting the meaning correctly because they share similar social traditions. By the Upper Paleolithic, when modern humans spread throughout the Old World, such finds appear regularly on archaeological sites although it has only been recently that their study has intensified. The Magdalenian huntergatherers of the Paris Basin were shown by Peschaux et al. (Ch. 3) to produce beads during the “off-season” of hunting. This is the first time it has been demonstrated that there were some populations for whom bead production was a seasonal activity. Beads become increasingly more numerous and more complex in number, variety and technique of production with the onset of agriculture, and even more elaborate within urban societies (Wright and Garrard 2003). A unique study in this volume by Shaham and BelferCohen represents a relatively new field of archaeological study, sound. They propose that Natufian bone pendants were in fact worn around the hips to provide a rhythmic sound during the dance (Ch. 7). Beads can have a decorative as well as an amuletic function representing a dialogue of sorts between the wearer and supernatural forces (Choyke 2010). They are entangled in a web of individual desires and social prerogatives. Beads and other forms of personal adornment were made from a wide array of raw materials. These include materials of biological origin such as mollusk shell, ostrich egg shell, ivory, bone, tooth, antler, horn, feathers, wood and seeds, stones and minerals in various colors and with different physical properties such as apatite, malachite, turquoise, ocher, basalt, obsidian, limestone, lapis lazuli and carnelian, and composite materials that require more human intervention to produce, including ceramics, various metals, glazed enstatite, faïence and glass (Bar-Yosef Mayer 2014). Mueller-Epstein discusses a wide array of beads made from different materials among Great Basin hunter-gatherers that were used in life-cycle events, health treatments, gaming, arbitration, economic currency and adornment (Ch. 6), showing once again that choice of raw materials may embody more than simple decorative preference. Difficulties in collecting beads in their original positions during excavation have often meant that this kind of data is lost to researchers who receive these finds in the laboratory. Likewise, beadwork rarely survives intact in archaeological settings for taphonomic reasons; although where it does,\n\nit provides clearer insight into the society inhabited by its makers. Bos had the opportunity to study a well-preserved tunic with elaborate beadwork worn by Tutankhamun. Close study of the beadwork revealed manipulation by craftspeople just prior to the pharaoh’s interment (Ch. 9) creating a more dynamic picture of the burial ritual surrounding the young pharaoh. Wearing particular ornaments binds us in groups and divides us as individuals. Beads and ornaments are about different kinds of social identity as well as personal preference and enhancement of physical appearance. The limitations and possibilities of these objects are manifold and so each period and settlement needs to be considered on its own merit before more sweeping generalizations can be made about the meaning of beads and ornament production and use within a region or over long swathes of time. Apparent parallelism between forms does not necessarily represent the same kind of ideas. Identical forms can be transmitted but understood and used in very different ways. The value of individual bead types can be acknowledged over large geographical areas even while their local symbolic interpretations and use in individual identity formation vary. At the same time, because of their fractal nature, beads especially represent an excellent medium for construction of value, trade and exchange within economic networks discussed in several papers in this volume. Spatz studied Neolithic shells in the Levant that were traded from either the Mediterranean or the Red Sea, some of which arrived at inland settlements as raw materials while others came to the settlement as finished beads (Ch. 5). Beads produced in one area from unique raw materials can be ascribed an accepted equivalency commodity value over vast different areas. The earliest case presented in this volume relates to 35,000-year-old shell beads from Australia that were studied by Balme and O’Connor. Those were taken inland from a distance of 150–500 km and were used in both secular and ceremonial contexts (Ch.2). Another extraordinary example of long-distance and short-distance movement of shell beads is the use of Mediterranean gastropods found in the Mesolithic Danube gorges. Because they were introduced into the sites from large distances, Cristiani and Borić propose that the long-distance beads refer to origin myths, while the beads made from local cyprinid pharyngeal teeth and freshwater snails resonate with personhood (Ch. 4). In fact, distance and rarity as well as personal associations can also enhance the value of ornaments that on face value may appear simply decorative (e.g. Sciama 1998). The history of bead and ornament study is filled with descriptive generalizations based on color and morphology. Beads, beadwork and pendants are visually seductive. They not only had an effect on the people who used them, but on the archaeologists who discovered them. This led to simple\n\n1. Introduction: The Archaeology of Beads, Beadwork and Personal Ornaments description of their raw material, color and morphology and sometimes context (mortuary, elite construction, etc.); however, rarely were attempts made to study them more deeply. Recently, with advances in microscopic studies for manufacture and use-wear analysis, digital technology, chemical analyses and closer attention to raw materials, the social plasticity of this kind of object has begun to reveal itself in assemblages from our distant and not-so-distant past. Again, new technologies enable us to look more deeply at the wear on beads and other ornaments, which gives clues to differences in their life histories. Van Gijn, studied beads’ biographies under high magnification and was able to show changes in their wear patterns over time. Middle Neolithic Dutch beads were treated on a personal level, whereas the later Funnel Beaker specimens were reworked to express collective identity (Ch. 8). Now, with improved digital photography in the field and lab and recognition that sequence may be important, ancient technology is revealed. Schneider and Hager use the recently developed technology of Reflectance Transformation Imaging to show that soapstone disk beads were produced both by craft specialists and by non-specialists in the prehistoric Napa Valley in northern California (Ch. 11), while VelázquezCastro et al. used scanning electron microscopy to study the carving technology of prestige goods in Formative Period Mexico (Ch. 10). Reproduction experiments are another tool to better understand past technologies. This approach was used by Campbell to demonstrate how very thin (1–3 mm long) tusk shell beads were produced in the Epipaleolithic of the Levant (Ch. 13). Gurova and Bonsall were able to differentiate between the production of soft stone beads (up to 5 on the Mohs scale) in the Neolithic of the Balkans, and the production of beads from harder materials (above 5.5 on the Mohs scale). The former could have been produced by non-specialists, while the latter required specialist expertise (Ch. 12). The interpretative devil often really does lie in the detail when it comes to the study of archaeological beads. The original idea for a session at the SAA came from discussions between Daniella Bar-Yosef Mayer and Alice Choyke about how we could promote the study of beads and other body ornaments in archaeology. Following the session, we added papers from scholars to round off the three areas of study we thought should be promoted and expanded: socio-cultural reflections; audio and visual social cues; and methodological approaches and experimentation. These categories represent the three sections of the volume. However, most papers in this volume have a multidisciplinary approach incorporating both the technological aspects of bead or ornament manufacture as well as their broader social, cognitive and economic implications.\n\n3\n\nThus, the papers in this volume cover many thousands of years of human prehistory. They extend geographically from North and Central America to Australia, the Near East, Egypt and Europe. This was no accident. The editors have tried to present a wide variety of case studies from different times, places and approaches to a subject that is far more about the way people relate and associate with each other than it was ever about simple decoration for decoration’s sake. Traditional descriptions of beads and ornaments in most archaeological reports only scratch the surface of what this class of artifact can tell archaeologists about how people interacted with each other through time and in particular locations. This volume is a first step in the creation of an academic forum comprised of scholars interested in exploring the way beads have been used, not only to please the eye but as material expressions of social relations.\n\nReferences Bar-Yosef Mayer, D.

They include perforated marine gastropods and intentionally fractured segments of scaphopods. While some of the oldest Australian examples are in archaeological sites that were close to the Pleistocene coastline, in the southern Kimberley of northern Australia, beads are found primarily in early Holocene contexts and in sites that were more than 500 km from the coast at the time of their deposition. This suggests that they were either traded or exchanged “down the line.” Historic photos and ethnographic evidence reveal that in the recent past Indigenous men, women and children in coastal locations wore such beads, whereas in central Australia they took on powerful properties and were used in ceremonial contexts with gender and age restricted use. One of the characteristics of marine shell ornaments in northern Australia is their bright, white or lustrous appearance that seems to have been intrinsic to their selection as body adornments. Distributions of shell beads across time and space in Australia can be interpreted as being related to changes in access to resources and social value which has implications for the interpretation of archaeological beads elsewhere. Introduction Beads and pendants made from organic materials including seeds, grass stems, bone, teeth and shells were and remain a common form of body decoration in Australian Aboriginal societies. Those found in pre-Macassan and European archaeological contexts are made of the most durable materials, bone, teeth and shells and, of these, shell beads have been found in the oldest contexts where they date from at least 35,000 years ago. In mainland Australia, shell beads are confined to the north of the continent and archaeological finds are restricted to only two shell varieties – Conus and scaphopod. In the southern Kimberley, beads are exclusively made from segments of scaphopod and are found primarily in early Holocene contexts of inland archaeological sites. As these sites were between 200 and 500 km from the coast at the time of the beads’ deposition, it is likely that the beads were traded or exchanged “down the line.” Historic photos and ethnographic evidence reveal that in\n\nthe recent past Indigenous people in coastal locations wore scaphopod as strands and as hair adornments. There is no record of their use in the inland regions of the Kimberley at European settlement, perhaps suggesting that they were used differently away from the coast, or that there was a break in traditional use. Here, we discuss some of the features of the beads, the evidence for their location and antiquity from five Kimberley sites and speculate that their uneven temporal and geographic distribution in the archaeological record may be related to their changing social value and meaning with increasing distance from their coastal source. In this paper, rather than the commonly used genus name Dentalium, we use the class term scaphopod for all tusk shells. As none of the fragments include the posterior part of the shell, it is not possible to further classify the shells beyond saying that they could represent eight species within the families Dentaliidae, Fustiariidae and Laevidentaliidae (G. Kendrick, pers. comm.).\n\nJane Balme and Sue O’Connor\n\n8\n\nChronology and Distribution of Shell Beads and other Marine Shell Ornaments and Value Goods from Archaeological Sites in Australia Shell beads have only been found in two areas in Australia, northwest Australia and Tasmania, an island to the south of the mainland that was effectively severed from mainland contact by the rough waters associated with the rising of sea levels about 12,000 years ago. The oldest Tasmanian shell beads so far recovered are associated with a burial at the site of West Point and are dated to between 1,800 ± 80 and 1,330 ± 80 BP (Jones 1967:363). The oldest shell beads found in Australia date to earlier than 35,000 cal BP (Morse 1993a) and derive from sediments within a rock shelter on the Pilbara coastline known as Mandu Mandu Creek (Fig. 2.1). There are 22 beads, all made on Conus sp. (provisionally ascribed to C. doreensis) and all, except the smallest one, have been modified to form\n\nbeads (Balme and Morse 2006:803; Morse 1993b:880). Six of the shells have been pierced and hollowed out while the remaining beads have been made from a section of spire of individual shells (Balme and Morse 2006:803). There is evidence of string wear and the large number and even size distribution of the beads in a single excavation unit combine to suggest that they once formed a single strand (Fig. 2.2). Conus doreensis typically lives in shallow waters on reef platforms and in sand under rocks, environments consistent with the predominantly reefed shoreline of the area (Balme and Morse 2006:882). The shells used to make the Mandu Mandu beads were probably acquired locally as the shelter is located less than a kilometer from the coastline today and where, because of the steeply shelved offshore profile, it would never have been more than 10 km from the Pleistocene coastline, even at the low stand of the Last Glacial Maximum.\n\nWidgingarri Koolan 2\n\nLGM\n\ne\n\nstlin\n\ncoa\n\nWindjana Gorge 1 Carpenter’s Gap 1 & 3 Mount Behn KIMBERLEY Riwi\n\nGREAT SANDY DESERT\n\nMandu Mandu Creek PILBARA CENTRAL DESERT REGION\n\nSilver Dollar\n\n500 km\n\nFigure 2.1 Locations of sites and places mentioned in the text (illustration by Dorcas Vannieuwenhuyse).\n\n2. Traditions and Change in Scaphopod Shell Beads in Northern Australia from the Pleistocene to the Recent Past While there are other shell fragments from species traditionally used to make jewelry rather than as dietary items at Mandu Mandu, these are somewhat younger. Three more fragments of Conus sp., one of which shows signs of modification, were recovered from deposits estimated to be about 24,000 cal BP (Morse 1993a:882) and fragments of pearl oyster shells, which were commonly used as personal ornaments in the recent past (see Akerman and Stanton 1994), were found in Pleistocene deposits (Morse 1993b:145–146). Fragments of scaphopods were also recovered from Pleistocene deposits at Mandu Mandu in sediments dating to between ca. 26,000 and 22,000 cal BP as well as in Holocene levels (Morse 1993b:145–146) including the uppermost excavation unit, which is less than 400 years old, (Morse 1989:86). Interestingly, these beads are isolated occurrences in the Pilbara region as no examples of shell beads have been reported from other coastal sites there, although pierced baler shell (Melos sp.) fragments, interpreted as pendants, have been found in late Holocene coastal shell middens in the area (Przywolnik 2003). Ten scaphopod fragments interpreted as beads and recovered from deposits dated to ca. 34,000 cal BP have been previously reported from Riwi, a limestone cave site in the southern Kimberley that is currently located some 300 km from the coast (Balme 2000; Balme and Morse 2006). Scaphopod beads have also been reported from Carpenter’s Gap 1 rock shelter to the west of Riwi in Windjana Gorge National Park (O’Connor 1995:59); however, these were all from Holocene contexts. Recent excavations in the same limestone system as Riwi have shown that inland movement of scaphopod beads was relatively common in the southern Kimberley and that the use of shell beads has a long history in this region.\n\nScaphopod Beads from Inland Kimberley Sites The caves and rock shelters described here are all formed in the extensive Devonian limestone reef complex of the southern Kimberley of Western Australia (Playford et al. 2009). The region today has a tropical monsoon climate that is warm and dry during the winter months and hot and wet in the summer. Its southern border abuts the very hot and dry Great Sandy Desert. The alkaline and relatively dry environments of the caves and shelters in the reef complex have resulted in remarkable preservation of organic material within the sites. In addition to Riwi, beads have been recovered from four shelters: Carpenter’s Gap 1 and 3, Windjana Gorge 1, and Mt Behn (Fig. 2.1). All sites were used into historic times and were known to local Indigenous people. The evidence for Riwi and Carpenter’s Gap 1 suggests that human occupation began ca. 47,000 cal BP, although a recent program of sample collection for Optically Stimulated\n\n9\n\nLuminescence (OSL) dating at Riwi may extend this age estimate. Currently, the earliest evidence for occupation at Carpenter’s Gap 3 is ca. 34,000 cal BP, at Windjina Gorge ca. 13,000 cal BP and at Mt Behn ca. 3,000 cal BP. The beads from Riwi have been described in some detail in Balme and Morse (2006:806). In brief, they vary between 5.2–17.55 mm with a mean of 12.5 mm. Most are longer than 10 mm. The fragments used are from the anterior (non-tapering) end of the shell. A residue, visible to the naked eye, is present within the sinuous grooves and on rough surface areas of the shells, notably the broken ends. Under a stereomicroscope at 50× magnification, this residue is dark red/black (Fig. 2.3a) and could be ocher or ocher mixed with some binding substance. A total of 37 beads have been recovered from the other four sites, 15 from Carpenter’s Gap 1, five from Carpenter’s Gap 3, two from Windjana Gorge 1 and 15 from Mt Behn. Like the Riwi beads these beads vary in length; the Carpenter’s Gap 1 beads range from 2.65 to 22.10 mm, the Carpenter’s Gap 3 beads from 9.13 to 23.75 mm, those from Windjana Gorge 1 from 14.18 to 18.69 mm and at Mt Behn from 4.2 to 12.6 mm. There are a variety of signs indicating the modification and use of these beads including polish, small fibers on the inside edge of the bead, wear on the edge of the bead and residue suggesting applications of color either on the bead itself or through rubbing against a painted body. Six beads have a deep undulation on at least one of their ends that are interpreted as the result of rubbing against stringing thread (e.g. Fig. 2.3b). The fractured ends on the beads from all sites display a variety of morphologies including some with cut notches (Fig. 2.3a), straight (Fig. 2.3c) and some of the broken ends having uneven surfaces (Fig. 2.3d) in addition to edge polish. Vanhaeren and d’Errico (2001) showed that breaking scaphopod shell by snapping and by sawing produced different characteristics on the fractured end of the shell. Snapping the shell produces sharp and perpendicular ends whereas sawing produces ends with two facets – one of which is oblique to the shell axis and the other is perpendicular (Vanhaeren and d’Errico 2001:216). Sawing also leaves marks resulting from the to-and-fro movement of the cutting edge. Moya Smith, of the Western Australian Museum, observed another method of creating beads from scaphopods on the coastal Kimberley in 1993. These beads are still made today by Bardi women, and Audaby Jack, the woman observed by Smith, made the beads by placing an intact shell on a stone anvil and then applying pressure to the shell with the back of a knife which she then snapped along the knife edge (Fig. 2.4). The shells were considered to be too delicate to be directly cut with the knife. Kim Akerman also observed this method in the same area during the 1970s (Kim Akerman, pers. comm. 2013). It produces a variety of morphologies on the fractured end, including perpendicular straight edges, oblique straight edges and\n\n10\n\nJane Balme and Sue O’Connor\n\nedges with small chips presumably from the pressure of the knife. The combinations of fractured ends of the southern Kimberley beads indicate that they may have been produced by a combination of snapping and pressure breaking, as in the modern Bardi method. In morphology, the beads are not unlike those in Australian museum collections collected in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Figure 2.5 shows one such strand collected in 1942 from Wyndam in the northern Kimberley. Most of these were strung on string made from a native plant fiber although later strings are often made from\n\nFigure 2.2 Mandu Mandu shell beads Conus sp. (photo by Doug Elford, Western Australian Museum).\n\nmaterial brought by Europeans, such as wool. The example in Figure 2.5 has ocher over the surface, which is thickest in the cracks, much like the example from Riwi shown in Figure 2.3a. This suggests some very long-lived practices.\n\nChronology of the Kimberley Beads The chronology for the beads found in these sites was determined by a combination of interpretation of their association with radiocarbon dates from other organic materials and from direct AMS dates that were attempted on samples of the beads. All ten of the Riwi beads came from the northeast quadrant of a one-meter test trench and from sediments with two similar charcoal radiocarbon dates calibrating to between about 30,700 and 33,500 years ago. Only one bead fragment was selected for direct dating. This returned an early Holocene date of between 7,644 and 7,459 cal BP (Wk36313R, p = .95). Unfortunately, the aragonite shell has been recrystallized as calcite. There is no discoloration of the bead or the ocher covering part of the bead and there are no obvious indications of burning or other visible evidence of alteration to the structure of the shell. In the absence of any indications of burning, the source of this re-crystallization can only derive from groundwater within the deposits. This\n\nFigure 2.3 Scaphopod beads from southern Kimberley sites: a. Riwi bead showing red residue and cut notches; b. Mt Behn bead showing wear from stringing thread; c. Mt Behn bead showing straight fractured end; and d. Carpenter’s Gap 3 bead showing uneven fractured ends (photos by Jane Balme and Rose Whitau).\n\n2. Traditions and Change in Scaphopod Shell Beads in Northern Australia from the Pleistocene to the Recent Past 11 leaves some uncertainty surrounding this date that we hope to resolve with fine resolution excavation and associated OSL and radiocarbon dates in future. Carpenter’s Gap 1 is a spacious rock shelter located along the northern margin of the Napier Range and about 25 m above the surrounding plain. Today the site is a minimum distance of 150 km from the coastline. A five-meter trench was excavated in two-centimeter excavation units at Carpenter’s Gap 1 between 1992 and 1993 (McConnell and O’Connor 1999; O’Connor 1995). Scaphopod beads were encountered in only two of the five excavation squares. Although the beads have not been directly dated, they all derive from within or above excavation units dated to ca. 4,000 cal BP. Direct dating of beads from Carpenter’s Gap 3, Windjana Gorge 1 and Mt Behn has produced only Holocene ages\n\nFigure 2.4 Bardi woman, Audaby Jack making scaphopod beads (photo by Moya Smith, Western Australian Museum).\n\n(Table 2.1). The two dated Carpenter’s Gap 3 beads are mid-Holocene. Of the remaining three beads, one was recovered from sediments associated with a radiocarbon date of 6,436–6,298 cal BP (SANU-30229, p = .95), one was recovered from between these dated sediments and sediments dated to 11,590–10,876 cal BP (SANU-29413, p = .95) and the third is from sediments that are undated but are probably Holocene in age. Mt Behn is a richly decorated rock shelter in an isolated limestone outcrop a few km to the east of CG1. The area of the deposit sampled during the 2012 excavation (2 × 1 m) dates from the late Holocene, although it is possible that a longer sequence may be preserved elsewhere in the site. There is a break in deposition between about 2,000 years ago, and historic times. Seven of the eight beads that have not been directly dated derive from excavation units that are older than 2,000 years and the remaining bead derives from excavation unit 2 on the border of the historic and pre-2,000-year-old material. The two Windjana Gorge 1 beads are the same age – early Holocene – and derive from sediments at the upper boundary of a discontinuity in the deposition at the site that dates from about 13,000–8,000 years BP. All material above that discontinuity dates to the last 1,500 years. In summary, apart from the Riwi beads that need further work on the dating, all the beads from the remaining sites date from the early to late Holocene. The one exception is a bead from the Mt Behn site, which has not been directly dated. It lies on the boundary of a break in deposition between late Holocene and historic deposits dating to the last 260 years and could possibly belong to the period just before European settlement of the area that began in the late nineteenth century.\n\nFigure 2.5 Scaphopod bead string with pearl shell pendant collected from the north Kimberley in 1942 (photo by Jane Balme of artifact held in the Western Australian Museum collection).\n\nJane Balme and Sue O’Connor\n\n12\n\nTable 2.1 Direct AMS dates for scaphopod bead fragments from three sites in the southern Kimberley.

First, they are restricted to the northwest of Australia and Tasmania. This may be in part a factor of preservation or the lack of access to suitable shellfish supply zones in some areas, but archaeological sites in other areas, such as southwest Australia and the Murray Darling system of western New South Wales contain beads made of other materials including bones and teeth (Dortch 1979; Macintosh 1971; Pretty 1977). Within northwestern Australia the beads appear to be confined to the Pilbara and Kimberley regions, as no examples have ever been reported from archaeological contexts in Arnhem Land, or elsewhere in the Northern Territory, despite this region being a focus of archaeological excavation over many decades. Second, there is clear evidence of species selection for bead use. The northwest coastline is extensive and diverse. It contains rocky platform, mangrove and sandy embayments and has one of the greatest diversities of marine species available in any region of Australia with many Indo-Pacific species. These include cowries, cone shells and large numbers of brightly colored and vivid shells prized by collectors today. It is therefore somewhat surprising that only two shell species have been recovered from archaeological sites as beads: Conus and scaphopods. Both would have been readily available in the nearest coastal waters to the sites. Conus shells are colorful and patterned and so are very attractive for ornamental purposes but the snails are venomous and would not have been\n\neaten. Their collection would have therefore only been for ornamental purposes. Scaphopods, while edible, are abundantly available on sandy beaches after storms. They require little modification apart from breaking into sections for beads and are a bright, shiny white. Third, apart from the early Conus shell beads from Mandu Mandu and the Riwi beads whose dating is uncertain, all of the shell beads date from the early Holocene. This is consistent with beads made from other materials in Australia (see Hapgood and Franklin 2008:tab. 3). Fourth, the distribution of the Kimberley shell beads indicates that they were carried or exchanged down the line over considerable distances in the past. Over 30,000 years ago, at the time the Riwi beads are presumed to have been deposited, sea levels were low and the site would have been at least 500 km from the ocean source of scaphopods. The other Kimberley beads reported here are from sites closer to the coastline and are associated with sea levels similar to those of today. Nevertheless, even today these sites are a good 150 km or so from the nearest coastline (Fig. 2.1). Finally, the archaeological distribution of beads does not include the areas from which the raw materials are derived. Surprisingly, no scaphopod or other shell beads have been recovered from the many shell middens, cave and rock shelter sites excavated along the Kimberley coastline. It would appear that, while beads were made and used in coastal communities in historic times, if they were similarly used on the coast in prehistory they were treated differently in their discard state and did not end up as part of the archaeological record.\n\n2. Traditions and Change in Scaphopod Shell Beads in Northern Australia from the Pleistocene to the Recent Past 13\n\nShell Beads and the Wider Context The features of shell beads, that is, species selection, uneven distribution, and transportation are frequent observations elsewhere in the world during Paleolithic times. Beads, and shell beads in particular, are a common type of ornament that occur in archaeological sites from ca. 100,000 years ago, with the earliest shell beads being recovered from Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave in Israel (Bar-Yosef Mayer 2005; Vanhaeren et al. 2006). Some of these, like the Kimberley beads described here, have ocher stains on them (Bar-Yosef Mayer et al. 2009). Selectivity of shell species used as beads is seen in most sites containing shell beads. For example, White (1992:550) has shown that fewer than a dozen species make up 90 per cent of several hundred known beads from the Aurignacian. Some researchers have found changes in proportions of different species over time (e.g. Taborin 1993 for French Aurignacian and Perigordian) and Stiner et al. (2013) have noted an increasing richness of species used over time at Üçağızlı Cave in Turkey over the Upper Paleolithic and Epi-Paleolithic. Dentalium species in particular are more prevalent in the later period, a pattern also noted by Bar-Yosef Mayer (2005) for the Levant. The availability of shell species is obviously one reason for the selection used but, other than that, the reasons for selection are difficult to speculate upon although size and morphology may have played a role (Stiner et al. 2013:393). The uneven distribution of shell beads in Upper Paleolithic Europe has been documented by Vanhaeren and d’Errico (2006) who noted the absence of shells for use as beads in some sites close to shell sources and their presence in some sites at distance from their sources. White (2007:299) has also pointed out the lack of clear association between raw material abundance and selection of bead-making raw material in the early Upper Paleolithic. Shell beads in the European Aurignacian are found in sites that are a similar distance inland to those found in the southern Kimberley. Vanhaeren and d’Errico’s (2006) review of the distribution of these shell beads report that five shell species, only available on the Mediterranean coast, are found at five sites from the southwest of France that are located more than 300 km from the Mediterranean Sea and three Atlantic shell species are found at five Mediterranean sites. Mediterranean shell beads are also common at sites in Italy and Austria that were at least 300 km inland at the time of their deposition (Vanhaeren and d’Errico 2006:1118). The appearance of beads has been suggested to have coincided with times when the chances of meeting strangers and the benefits of advertising one’s identity is high (Kuhn et al. 2001) and such times would have been higher when population density increased (e.g. Gamble 1999; Kuhn and Stiner 2007; Shennan 2001), but see Sterelny (2011:812) on some of the difficulties with such arguments. Whatever the function of the beads, the distance over which they have been traded or carried supports at least the notion of\n\ninter-group contact, and that these particular species of shell beads had significant social value to the communities living at the sites in which they were recovered. Ethnographic sources from Australia’s north demonstrate how these values might change across distance.\n\nEthnographic Use of Scaphopod Shell for Beads and Worn Paraphernalia In the Kimberley region, there is ethnographic evidence – in the form of photographs and items in museum collections – that shell beads made from segments of scaphopod shell were worn strung in long strands, sometimes with pearl shell pendants, and as hair decoration, by people in coastal communities. In these coastal settings, they were worn by children as well as adults (e.g. Fig. 2.6) and so it does not appear that there was necessarily any special significance accorded to the beads at their point of origin. However, they were also used in ceremonial contexts on the Kimberley coast. For example, the anthropologist Worms (1938), describes the placement of scaphopod shell necklaces around the neck of male initiates in a coastal initiation ceremony. This use of shell ornaments for both secular and ceremonial use on the Kimberley coast is not restricted to scaphopod beads as ornaments made of baler shell (Melos sp.) (Akerman 1973) and pearl shell (Pinctata sp.) were also worn in secular life as well as having particular ritual uses in the coastal Kimberley (Akerman and Stanton 1994:22–23). In coastal Western Australia, as in many other parts of Australia, many different types of marine shells, including baler shell, have been used for a variety of functions including containers, scrapers and spoons (see Przywolnik 2003:16 for a short review). However, it is only these three species – scaphopods, baler shell and pearl shell – that have been recorded in sites far from the coast and dating to preEuropean settlement and early European settlement times. There are good, dated ethnographic records, especially photographs and objects held in museum collections, for the movement of baler and pearl shell from coastal areas, into the desert. Mountford and Harvey (1938), Mulvaney (1969), Akerman (1973) and Akerman (1979) and Akerman and Stanton (1994) have documented the distribution of traded baler, pearl and scaphopod shell. One of the features of these records is the degree to which the shells are curated the further down the line they were traded (Akerman and Stanton 1994; Mountford and Harvey 1938; Mulvaney 1976). For example, Akerman (1973:124) reports that in 1972 he found fragments of baler shell within the environs of a camp at Wiluna and the men told him that these were places where pendants had been chipped and ground down for rain making ceremonies. While Akerman (1973) and Akerman and Stanton (1994) report that baler shell found inland was used for other purposes, the primary purpose for\n\n14\n\nJane Balme and Sue O’Connor\n\nFigure 2.6 Father Rudolph with some young boys at Beagle Bay Mission on the Kimberley coast. Image taken in 1909 by Fr Bischoff (photo courtesy of the Western Australian Museum, Registration number DA Bischoffs 09).\n\nbaler and pearl shell in desert regions is as pendants in rain making ceremonies. In these contexts, they are powerful objects. It has been suggested that the further the shells were traded, the more powerful they became. Mountford and Harvey (1938:128–129) for example, describe the use of baler shell for witchcraft and in the male initiation ceremony amongst the Dieri in the desert of northeastern South Australia. The special power of pearl shell in the different places that it was used has been attributed to the qualities of its shimmering iridescence or brilliance and shininess – a detailed discussion of this is provided in Akerman and Stanton (1994:19–32). On the Kimberley coast these qualities of pearl shell are associated with water, spiritual powers and healing. Brilliance or iridescence is a quality that Morphy (1989:36) believes operates cross-culturally and in Australia is often associated with or imbued with special powers. These intrinsic qualities have similarly been suggested to account for the trade distribution of other kinds of raw material or artifacts within Australia, most notably the large, shiny, white stone blades known as “leilira” blades\n\n(Allen 1997). It is the presence of these prized qualities that probably underlies the selection of scaphopods, baler shell and pearl shell as items of personal adornment and trade over long distances. Changes in access, transportation and demography affected the speed in which goods were transported so that before the availability of new forms of transport, initially horses, movement of goods might have been slow, as the goods were curated down the line. However, Akerman and Stanton (1994:16) suggest that movement of prestige goods in pre-contact times was also rapid but that access to new forms of transport affected the bulk of material that could be moved at one time. Akerman and Stanton (1994) document the life histories of pearl shell pendants and show that there was a rapid increase in their production and exchange after 1900 perhaps in part because of new methods of transport also because of the development of the pearling industry on the northwest coast from the late nineteenth century. They also suggest (1994:16) that the concentration of people on missions may also have provided opportunity for more ceremonies in which these objects were needed. Thus, while in pre-European contact times pieces of shell used by desert people might have been rare and very small by the time they reached inland places, changes in access and transport meant that the artifacts were less curated during their trade as there was less need to make the artifacts “go further.” Interestingly, these more complex traded objects seem to have, at least sometimes, included scaphopod shells (always abundant on the coast) included in the artifact. For example, in 1976, Akerman (pers. comm.) recorded many pearl shells at Yuendumu, in the Australia’s Central Desert, some of which were fixed as pendants attached to long strands of scaphopod shells. Similar objects are held in the Western Australian museum from Kimberley coastal areas. Although there is much ethnographic literature on the ceremonial use of baler and pearl shell in non-coastal environments, we found very little for scaphopods. An exception to this is Kim Akerman’s observation (Akerman, pers. comm. 2013) of a necklace of scaphopod shell beads (traded from Lombardina via Broom) strung on fiber string being used at Fitzroy Crossing for ceremonial purposes in 1976. We could find no references to scaphopod use in the area from which they were recovered from our excavations. We did, however, find one reference to their use by Walpiri people in Australia’s central desert. Meggitt (1966) recorded that the Walpiri regarded scaphopods as so dangerous and powerful that they could only be seen by initiated men or men. While the initiated men are at Yarungganyi they also encounter for the first time the dangerous and powerful landjulgari scaphopod shells. The moon-dreaming man, during his many journeys back and forth between Ngangga (Mount Leichhardt), Yanarildji (Cockatoo Creek) and Yarungganyi, has worn a string of these\n\n2. Traditions and Change in Scaphopod Shell Beads in Northern Australia from the Pleistocene to the Recent Past 15 shells, as well as a bone, through his nasal septum. He places a string in Barili creek, where the men later find it. At once they realize what the object is, and they in turn decorate their initiation novices with it so that the boys may absorb the power of the shells and so become immune to it. (Meggitt 1969:129). He also reports that women and children could not see the shells at close range for fear of death (Meggitt 1969:129, n.207). So important were these shells to the Walpiri that they are associated with sites that had their own dreaming track (Meggitt 1969:132). Although Meggitt was told that men had found the shells as fossils in the region, at the time he was working in the area (in the 1950s and ’60s) the shells “drift in from the Kimberley coast” (Meggitt 1969:129, n.207), which is well over 1000 km away. Scaphopod species occur in coastal waters around most of Australia (Atlas of Living Australia) and so it is conceivable that the shells may have been traded from northern waters but even so some 1000 km from the nearest coastline. These observations seem to mirror that of the baler and pearl shell records from the central desert. The further from the source, the more powerful the objects become. The antiquity of these trading networks is difficult to ascertain, as rare objects are not likely to be found in archaeological sites. However, in addition to the scaphopod shells reported here, fragments of baler and pearl shell have been reported from inland sites. The oldest of these are some baler shell pieces dated to ca. 32,000 cal BP and recovered from Widgingarri Shelter 1 in west Kimberley (O’Connor 1999a:60, 121). Baler shell in contexts dating to ca. 22,000 cal BP was also recovered from the Silver Dollar site, Shark Bay in the Pilbara (Bowdler 1990). At the time of their deposition these sites were 70–100 km inland. There are no dates of that antiquity for desert sites further inland but Smith and Veth (2004) have obtained direct dates of more than 200 years cal BP on baler shell fragments collected from open sites in the Great Sandy Desert from a site over 400 km inland. Apart from these dates, and those reported here, all inland baler, pearl fragments occur in recent contexts.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions Beads of various organic materials have been an ornament used by Aboriginal societies since Pleistocene times. However, despite the abundance of decorative shells around Australia’s coastlines, shell beads had a very restricted distribution in Aboriginal Australia. They were only made in the northwest of Australia and in Tasmania. This regional distribution of bead raw material types and the over 35,000 years BP antiquity of northwest shell bead-making, is reflected in other material culture forms, most notably, edge\n\nground axes (Balme and O’Connor 2014:170; O’Connor et al. 2014). In addition to these regional differences in broad raw material types, people were also very selective about the particular shell species they used. In northwest Australia, only two shell types are recorded to have been made into beads – Conus sp. (probably Conus doreensis) and undetermined (because of the absence of the critical identifying posterior element) scaphopod species. Only one example of Conus use is recorded and these are the beads recovered from Pleistocene deposits at the Mandu Mandu site. All the remaining beads are scaphopods. In addition, two other much larger kinds of shell, Melos sp. and Pinctata sp. are frequently recorded to have been curated and strung as pendants. There is no doubt that ease of access and abundance of the scaphopods, and perhaps the lack of processing required, would have contributed to their selection for beadmaking. But, other gastropod and bivalve shells are also very abundant on beaches, many naturally perforated. Baler shell and, until the advent of the pearling industry, pearl shell are not so easily obtained. It seems likely then, that the shells were selected for the other quality shared by all three types, that is, their bright, and shimmering surfaces and, for pearl shell, iridescence. These features, including iridescence, are also shared by the maireener shells that dominate the beads made by Tasmanian Aboriginal people but are not so evident in the patterned Conus shells. Could these qualities that were associated with spiritual and magical power at European contact have a deep antiquity? We have discussed the ethnographic evidence for increasing social value and power that the shell items obtained as they moved inland. If the same situation pertained in the past it would be expected that the more accessible the raw material was, the more common would be the shell artifacts made from it, and that the converse would apply, that is, the further inland the shells moved the scarcer the beads would be in archaeological deposits. However, this is not the pattern that exists. Shell beads have not been found in coastal sites although they are widely observed to have been worn in the post-Contact period and many necklets of scaphopod segments from the Kimberley coast can be found in museums. This is not just a matter of sampling as more shelter sites have been excavated in the coastal Kimberley (O’Connor 1999b; Veitch 1996), as well as open sites and middens with excellently preserved shell food refuse and other shell tools (O’Connor 1999b; Veitch 1999). These include shell modified for domestic use such as baler shell bowls, knives and adzes (O’Connor 1999a:36, 1999b:39). Could the differences in distribution of beads in sites be due to the different contexts in which they were used and the different value and meaning they had as a result? Scaphopod shell is readily collected from sandy beaches along the northern Australian coastline. It is possible that the mere fact of their ease of replacement mitigated against the return\n\n16\n\nJane Balme and Sue O’Connor\n\nof beads to habitation sites. If a strand broke it may simply have been discarded, rather than the shells collected up, wrapped and transported to the habitation site for reuse in another decorative item. Shell beads are found in greatest frequency in southern Kimberley shelters that were at least 150 km from the coast where they appear in greatest numbers from ca. 8000 years ago. These sites contain spun fiber string fragments and a range of subsistence resources usually associated with women’s foraging, such as small mammals and reptiles, freshwater shellfish and plant remains, which we believe indicates that they were used for general-purpose habitation by extended family groups. For this reason, we have argued that in the southern Kimberley the scaphopod beads were likely worn in secular rather than sacred contexts. However, the shells were not readily available and could not be easily replenished as they could in the coastal supply zone. It is therefore likely that they were reused and curated and therefore were lost or discarded at the habitation site. The small size of some segments recovered may indicate a high degree of recycling of shell segments. This period also marks the end of rising sea levels and may reflect not the beginning of trade networks, but rather the changed location of the sites relative to the coast. Although ethnographically scaphopod beads are observed to have been traded inland into central desert regions of Australia where they were objects of great power and value, they have never been reported from desert archaeological contexts. This is hardly surprising as, although they were rare and valued, they were also dangerous and powerful. The sacredness of the objects themselves would preclude their use (or discard) at general habitation sites. Today, similarly powerful objects are hidden in deep crevices between ceremonies lest they be accidentally seen, or ritually disposed of after use. They are also only used in designated law grounds or sites where their power can be controlled by ritual leaders. There are three general archaeological points to be made from the discussion above. First, while archaeologists often interpret the presence of beads as evidence of identity markers of social categories within groups and between groups, one of the main points to emerge from the evidence discussed here is that the same beads may have very different meanings throughout their life history. The ethnographic evidence for scaphopod beads and other shell ornaments indicate that at their point of origin they are used in both secular and ceremonial contexts by a variety of social categories but, as they were traded inland their use narrowed. The second point is that the attributes that archaeologists use to analyze bead distribution, especially morphology, may well not be qualities that were of prime importance to the maker of the beads (a point also made by White 2007:299). Third, the distribution of beads in\n\narchaeological landscapes may not necessarily reflect their abundance or use but rather the value or meaning with which they were vested. These values and meanings may change as a result of social re-organization and associated ceremonies but also as a consequence of changing access to beads, for example from sea level changes that result in changes to the distance to shell sources and from access to new modes of transport.\n\nAcknowledgments This research is part of a wider project funded by the Australian Research Council Linkage Grant LP100200415 with contributions from the Kimberley Foundation, Australia, and the Department of Sustainability, Water, Populations and Communities.

From the creation of a regional database of 16 occupations dating from the Upper Magdalenian period, we correlate the study of ornament remains with the function of occupations. In this way, the results show that Magdalenian people did not produce beads everywhere and all the time. Indeed, the beadwork activity seems to have been practiced out of occupations where collective efforts were focused on intensive hunting tasks. In the Paris Basin, the production of beads was identified in only two levels at the site of Pincevent, which present particular occupation modalities. Both levels are characterized by a diversification of those domestic activities that occurred at times less governed by hunting activities during unspecialized occupations. In both examples, the currently available data on seasonality indicate that bead production may have taken place between the winter and spring. In addition, all the evidence collected in this paper shows that autumn was not a good time for this activity. Hence, the “beadwork time” seems to occur only in a particular and favorable context of the Magdalenian annual cycle. Introduction This paper focuses on the personal ornaments of the Magdalenian hunter-gatherer populations of the Paris Basin, in France. The Magdalenian is a cultural entity dating to the end of the Paleolithic period. It is well represented in the western part of Europe. The objective of this work is to examine the position of bead activity in the territorial occupation pattern of these populations by identifying whether there was a preferred time of year for doing beadwork, which here is called “Beadwork Time.” The examination of ancient hunter-gatherer subsistencesettlement strategies is based on territorial organization patterns and the reconstruction of the function of sites (Binford 1980). Ethnoarchaeological works teach us that bead production varies with the socio-economic system and territorial occupation pattern (Arnold and Munns 1994; Graesch 2004; Gray 2009; Kenoyer et al. 1991; Masucci 1995; Sciama and Eicher 1998). However, symbolic\n\nartifacts are investigated in very few studies (Stiner et al. 2013; Whallon 2006). The cognitive, symbolic and identity significance of ornaments globally tends to isolate them from this issue. On the one hand, these decorative objects are extensively used in the debate on the origin of humanity (see Ambrose 1998; Balme and Morse 2006; BarYosef et al. 2009; Bednarik 1995; Bouzouggar et al. 2007; d’Errico et al. 1998; d’Errico et al. 2005; d’Errico et al. 2003; d’Errico et al. 2008; Kuhn and Stiner 2007a, 2007b; Orton 2008; Vanhaeren and d’Errico 2005; Vanhaeren et al. 2006; Zilhão 2007; Zilhão et al. 2010). On the other hand, they have also largely contributed to investigating cultural phenomena and reconstructing circulation patterns (see Álvarez-Fernández 2001; Bar-Yosef 1989; Eriksen 2002; Fullola et al. 2007; Stiner 2003; Taborin 1993; Vanhaeren and d’Errico 2006). However, recent research recommends integrating the ornament data in studies of site function and examining the beads by means of a contextual approach\n\n20\n\nCaroline Peschaux, Grégory Debout, Olivier Bignon-Lau and Pierre Bodu\n\nbringing together the detailed analysis of these objects in the cultural, economic and functional history of the site (Bachellerie et al. 2011; Stiner et al. 2013; White 2007). Our study of the variability of bead-making by the Magdalenian groups in the Paris Basin was initiated by works that have been carried out over recent years on the last occupation level of Pincevent (Seine-et-Marne), called level IVO (Bodu et al. 2006). One of the special features of the occupation is that it has provided nearly 300 ornament objects and associated products (raw material and manufacturing discards). The large number of remains related to ornaments and evidences of every manufacturing stage indicate that it is a site of production (Bodu et al. 2006). This activity has not yet been well documented for the Magdalenian groups of the Paris Basin. Therefore, the abundance of ornament pieces in an occupation site constitutes a new characteristic for these sites. This irregular presence of ornaments suggests that the beadwork activities of these nomadic hunter-gatherer populations were split in time and space, as has already been observed and documented for their other activities (Audouze 2006;\n\nOlive and Pigeot 2006). In order to model the organization of ornament production of the Magdalenian population in the Paris Basin, we have developed a multidisciplinary approach that correlates the study of ornaments with the functions of sites. The purpose of this work is to answer two questions: when and in what context were the ornaments made?\n\nMagdalenian Population in the Paris Basin Geographic, Climatic, and Chronological Context The Paris Basin is a large geographic and geologic area situated in the north of France, around the city of Paris (Fig. 3.1). There is much data available on this region; a little over forty Magdalenian sites are known to date. There is a high concentration of occupations in the south of Paris, but evidence also indicates settlement expansion in the northern and western part of the region. Compared to neighboring regions, the Magdalenian culture of the Paris Basin is a welldefined entity that has specific attributes corresponding to a chronological divergence between the different Magdalenian regions (Bodu et al. 2009; Debout et al. 2012).\n\nFigure 3.1 Magdalenian sites in the Paris Basin. Numbered black circles are sites referred to in this paper. Illustration prepared by G. Debout (redrawn from Debout et al. 2012:fig. 1).\n\n3. Magdalenian “Beadwork Time” in the Paris Basin (France) Radiocarbon dates for the Paris Basin sites range from 13,200 to 11,950 cal BC (Debout et al. 2011, 2012; Valentin 2008). All these sites are attributed to the Upper phase of the Magdalenian period (Fig. 3.2). The first occupations date to the end of the cold climatic episode of Heinrich 1 (GS-2a), others date to the warmer episode of Bølling (GI-1e and GI-1d) (Debout et al. 2012).\n\nPersonal Ornaments Data\n\nWell-Preserved and Stratified Sites for a Palethnographic View\n\nFossil Shell Bead Production\n\nThe Upper Magdalenian sites of the Paris Basin are characterized by the quality of their preservation (Fig 3.3), particularly in the Seine Valley open-air sites of Étiolles, La Haye, Pincevent, Verberie and the sites of the SeineYonne confluence. These sites provide some well-preserved occupations where the remains are almost unaltered and found in their original position. The remains are organized into units composed of a main fireplace around which zones of domestic activity – flint-knapping, leatherworking, butchering – and disposal areas occur. Based on this highresolution evidence, the notions of habitation (a single unit) and camp (multiple units) were defined to refer to these Magdalenian occupations in the Paris Basin (Olive et al. 2000). These sites were studied using the palethnographic approach elaborated by André Leroi-Gourhan at Pincevent. This approach is based on the excavation and the analysis methods presented in reference publications devoted to habitation no. 1 and section 36 (Leroi-Gourhan and Brézillon 1966, 1972). Continuously used over the last 50 years in the Paris Basin, these research methods have permitted the question of the function of sites and their integration within a territory to be developed, resulting in a better understanding of mobility patterns (Audouze 2006, 2007; Bignon 2007a, 2008; Julien 1989; Julien et al. 1988; Olive 2004; Olive and Pigeot 2006). These patterns suggest a territorial exploitation that was organized around an annual cycle of activities, based on fluctuating objectives of hunting horses and reindeer. Hence, one finds seasonal construction governed by settlement of unequal length, lasting from a few weeks to several months. In addition to their good state of preservation, some sites are stratified. Between five and fifteen occupation levels are known at Pincevent, Étiolles and Verberie. They are separated by thin deposits of alluvia rapidly piled up by the annual overflows of the River Seine. The formation of these sequences is estimated to have occurred over a few generations, perhaps with the same individuals coming back repeatedly (Bodu 2010; Julien and Karlin 2002; Rodriguez and Roblin-Jouve 2004). These successive return visits to the same place confirm the regularity of displacements and allow functional variability of the occupations within the same site to be studied.\n\n21\n\nWith such high-quality information, the Paris Basin constitutes a field of regional study that is privileged and unique for the problematic we present here. In addition, the ornaments have a thematic and technical homogeneity that shows these Magdalenian populations engaged in the same ornamental practices.\n\nAs for the other components of the archaeological assemblage, ornaments display an obvious standardization over the entire Paris Basin. So far, nearly 400 ornaments have been discovered. These beads are mainly composed of fossil seashells (Tab. 3.1). Among the more commonly used taxa, Bayania lactea and Dentalium sp. are the most\n\nFigure 3.2 Chronological and climatic contexts of the Magdalenian culture in the Paris Basin.

Ampullina parisiensis, Granulolabium scruposum, Ancillus buccinoides, Athleta bulbulus, Sigmesalia multisulcata, Potamididae and Turritella sp. are also found in several sites. The other ornaments were mostly discovered at Pincevent. They consist of perforated pebbles and stone slices (lignite, limestone and sandstone) as well as some other materials including fossil shark teeth, ammonites and belemnite rostra. Less common are ornaments comprising animal teeth, represented by a series of sawn reindeer incisors discovered in level IV20 at Pincevent (Vanhaeren 2006). Magdalenian people mainly exploited regional resources. In fact, throughout the Paris Basin, only one shell came from a distant source: a Nucella lapillus shell, a Pleistocene Atlantic species, discovered in unit A14 at Étiolles (Taborin 1993). The other shells came from regional fossiliferous formations. Indeed, the Paris Basin is composed of marine sedimentary rocks dating from the Eocene period, fifty million years ago. These sedimentary formations contain a large number of well-preserved shell species. Today, hundreds of fossiliferous sites are known containing more than one thousand species. Nevertheless, Magdalenian\n\npeople chose only a few types to make their ornaments; only about fifteen taxa were identified on these sites. This deliberate selection demonstrates a common ornamental theme. The manufacturing techniques are also standardized. Shells were transformed by one perforation only. These perforations are always made by an abrasion technique, on the side that contains the original aperture of the shell. The perforation position and the wear traces suggest that the shells were assembled in the same way, probably using a sewing method.\n\nCreation of a Regional Database In order to correlate the study of ornaments with the function of sites, we created a database that combines 16 occupations dating from the Upper Magdalenian of the Paris Basin (Tab. 3.2). This represents a little more than a third of the known sites in the region.

We estimate that this is the minimum size needed to be able provide information on the variability of the activities carried out in one habitation unit. Data Connected to Ornaments. Firstly, the database gathers quantitative information organized around the presence/\n\n23\n\nabsence of ornaments and the number of pieces discovered. To document the density of each occupation, we have established a ratio that measures the number of ornament remains by square meter excavated (OR/m2). Secondly, qualitative information is integrated into the database. It corresponds to data resulting from the technological analysis of ornaments. Finished items are distinguished from objects linked to the production process. This latter category is mainly composed of unperforated shells, generally represented in sequences and comprising a few selected species. They are considered to be unused shell material. Rough-outs and manufacturing rejects associated with stone production are also included in this category. In contrast, the majority of finished objects consist of perforated and worn out shells. Data Referring to the Function of the Occupations. In our database, the function of sites is based upon three interrelated variables. The first concerns the proportionality of the activities. On the one hand, there are multifunctional occupations characterized by versatile activities represented in equivalent proportions, and on the other hand, there are occupations in which activities were “specialized”, meaning that one activity largely prevails. In the latter case, the nature of the main activity is named. The second variable indicates whether there were one or more occupation seasons. Reindeer and horse seasonal data are based on more accurate estimations of the animal’s age of death. Such estimations are based on dental eruption/replacement in juvenile specimens and the crown height method (Bignon 2003, 2008; Fernandez and Legendre 2003; Guadelli 1991; Habermehl 1975; Levine 1982, 1983; Miller, 1974, 1976; Petit 1939). In order to get a more accurate estimate of age of death in juvenile horses, we used the crown height method applied to deciduous premolars which yields high statistical significance (Bignon 2006, 2007b, 2008; Tab. 3.3 and Fig. 3.4). The last variable corresponds to the duration of the occupation: either short or long. Duration is defined by the density and organization of the accumulated remains. For example, the weights of heating stones and their stage of fragmentation are regular indicators of the use-life of the main fireplace in a habitation. Associated with data on seasonality, the variable of occupation duration sometimes makes it possible to determine whether the settlement was occupied continuously or discontinuously.\n\nQuantitative Variability The first result is that the quantitative variability of ornaments is confirmed. Indeed, ornament numbers vary from site to site (Fig. 3.5a). Four occupations contain no pieces whatsoever, seven contain less than 10 pieces, four occupations contain between 10 and 50 pieces, and only one occupation delivered more than 200 pieces. The ratio of ornaments remains by excavated square meter reveals a slightly different distribution: it clearly\n\nUnit G13\n\nLa Haye\n\n15\n\n– Absence\n\nAbsence\n\nPresence\n\n1300\n\nLevel IV0\n\nLevel IV21.3\n\nHabitation no. 1\n\nLevel IV20\n\nLevel IV40\n\nLevel IV30\n\nUnit C151\n\nLocus 10\n\nSector 2\n\nSouthern locus\n\nUnit D14\n\nPincevent\n\nPincevent\n\nPincevent\n\nPincevent\n\nPincevent\n\nPincevent\n\nVille-Saint-Jacques (Le Tilloy)\n\nLe Tureau des Gardes\n\nLe Grand Canton\n\nLe Brassot\n\nMarsangy (Le Pré des Forges)\n\n220\n\n200\n\n1020\n\n85\n\n20\n\n150\n\n150\n\n4500\n\n70\n\n250\n\n120\n\nÉtiolles (Les Coudrays) Unit Q31\n\nPresence\n\nAbsence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nAbsence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nLevel 4a\n\nLa Côte Masset\n\n210\n\nPresence\n\nLocus 2\n\nVerberie (Le Buisson Campin)\n\n1\n\n–\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n–\n\n1\n\n37\n\n3\n\n31\n\n298\n\n2\n\n33\n\n–\n\n–\n\n10\n\nPresence\n\n–\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\n–\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\n–\n\n–\n\nPresence\n\nAbsence\n\n–\n\nAbsence\n\nAbsence\n\nAbsence\n\n–\n\nAbsence\n\nPresence\n\nAbsence\n\nPresence\n\nPresence\n\nAbsence\n\nAbsence\n\n–\n\n–\n\nAbsence\n\n0.00\n\n–\n\n0.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.05\n\n–\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.04\n\n0.12\n\n0.23\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n–\n\n–\n\n0.05\n\nExcavated m2 Ornament Number Finalized Raw material Ratio remains objects /rough (OR/m2)\n\nÉtiolles (Les Coudrays) Unit U5/P15 800\n\nOccupation\n\nSite\n\n–\n\n–\n\nHunting\n\n–\n\nHunting\n\nMain activity\n\n–\n\n–\n\nSpecialized\n\nSpecialized\n\nSpecialized\n\nSpecialized\n\nSpecialized\n\nSpecialized\n\nSpecialized\n\n–\n\n–\n\nAutumn\n\n–\n\nWinter to spring\n\nAll the seasons\n\n–\n\n–\n\nAutumn\n\n–\n\nAutumn\n\nSeason\n\nShort\n\nShort\n\nShort\n\nShort\n\nShort\n\nLong continuously\n\nShort\n\nShort\n\nShort\n\n–\n\nShort\n\nLength of time\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\nButchery All the seasons\n\nButchery All the seasons\n\nShort\n\n–\n\nShort discontinuously\n\nShort discontinuously\n\nButchery Summer to Short autumn\n\nHunting\n\nHunting\n\nHunting\n\nHunting\n\nUnspecialized –\n\nUnspecialized –\n\n–\n\nSpecialized\n\n–\n\nSpecialized\n\nActivities\n\nTable 3.2 Database of personal ornaments and the function of Magdalenian sites in the Paris Basin.

We can define the first group as having a very weak ratio of ornaments per square meter, with less than 0.06 OR/m2. In contrast, the second group presents a high ratio of ornaments, with more than 0.1 OR/m2. Significantly, that there is no occupation exhibiting intermediate ratios. This distribution reveals a clear partition that makes it possible to distinguish two types of occupations: those with no or few ornament remains and those with many ornament remains.\n\nOccupations with No or Few Ornament Remains Ornaments are absent or rare in most of the Magdalenian occupations of the Paris Basin. In our database, occupations with a low density of pieces are indeed the more numerous (88% of the corpus). Ornaments are totally absent in onethird of the occupations. In the other two-thirds, they are generally present in small numbers (one to three pieces), and more rarely a little better represented (over 10 pieces).\n\nOccupations without Bead Production Technological analyses have shown that in these occupations the ornaments consist overwhelmingly of finished objects. Indeed, a part of the occupations contained only one or two\n\nDentalium beads. That is the case at Pincevent – level IV40, at Étiolles – unit Q31, Tureau des Gardes and Ville-SaintJacques (Taborin 1994; Vanhaeren 2006). In other cases, at Marsangy and at Grand Canton, the beads comprise a single perforated Bayania lactea (Taborin 1993, 1994). The ornaments in habitation no. 1 at Pincevent are also composed of a single perforated Turritella sp., combined with two lignite slices (Leroi-Gourhan and Brézillon 1966, 1972; Taborin 1994; Vanhaeren 2006). The technological reading of these slices indicates that they are finished objects. The perforations are complete and the surfaces entirely polished. In the occupations where ornaments are better represented, the compositions are generally similar to the ones described above. At Verberie, the fossil shells are probably perforated (Taborin 1993, 1994) and at Étiolles – unit U5/P15, objects comprise several perforated shells and about thirty Dentalium beads (Taborin 1994). However, a special feature stands out in level IV20 at Pincevent. Like the other occupations, it contains a majority of finished objects. However, two rough-outs were also found in this level (Vanhaeren 2006). De facto, one belemnite rostrum and one pebble display a perforation in progress. Nevertheless, the nature of these objects suggests opportunistic manufacturing. At Pincevent and other sites, the presence of these curious, water worn objects,\n\n26\n\nCaroline Peschaux, Grégory Debout, Olivier Bignon-Lau and Pierre Bodu\n\nFigure 3.5 Quantitative variability of ornament remains in the occupations: a. number of items; b. ratio of ornament remains by square meter excavated (OR/m2) (illustration by C. Peschaux).\n\n3. Magdalenian “Beadwork Time” in the Paris Basin (France) is generally attributed to random collection (Peschaux 2008; Vanhaeren 2006). Thus, specimens in level IV20 at Pincevent should not be considered remains of an activity aimed at producing ornaments for the group; rather they reveal some ad hoc individual manufacture. In level IV20 at Pincevent, as in other occupations, there is neither waste nor raw material, unlike the sites of bead production (see below). In the absence of such evidence, it appears that no bead-working activity was organized in these occupations. Yet, it seems that the occupants were adorned. The presence of these finished items, found in small numbers, is rather due to random loss of some worn beaded objects.\n\nThe Function of Occupations: Specialized Subsistence Activity Available data on the function of occupations with no bead working indicates the presence of some specialized activities connected to intensive hunting and butchering. Two types of occupation were identified: on the one hand, residential camps set up for the autumnal collective hunting of reindeer and on the other, non-residential installations set up for hunting and butchering horses and reindeer, throughout the year. Reindeer clearly dominates the faunal spectra in the residential camps for collective hunting. At Verberie and in level IV20 at Pincevent, archaeozoological analyses revealed that reindeer was hunted en masse and in a collective way; en masse since the minimum number of individuals is estimated at between 20 and 80 killed animals, of varying age and gender. In a collective way because the quantity of killed animals presupposes the use of beating and interception hunting practices that required the participation of a large number of people. Moreover, post-hunt sharing of reindeer quarters among the different units was demonstrated (Enloe 1991; Enloe and David 1997). It is also assumed that reindeer was exploited partly in order to stock up on food (Julien and Karlin 2002). Data on seasonality have shown that the great hunting expeditions were organized in autumn when herds of reindeer seasonally migrated (David 1994; Enloe 1991; Enloe and David 1997; Leroi-Gourhan and Brézillon 1966). Being limited to the autumnal period of migrations, these collective camps appear to be fairly shorttime occupations. The occupation period is estimated to have lasted between six and eight weeks (David 1994). Indeed, the density of the remains, particularly of stones displaying marks of fire and domestic tools, is much less compared to other settlements that were occupied for longer periods of time (Julien 2006). The same function is attributed to several other occupations with no beadwork as in habitation no.1 and levels IV40 and IV30 at Pincevent (Bignon et al. 2006), and the site of La Haye (Debout et al. 2011). The absence of beadwork is also demonstrated in another occupation modality in which the activities are also specialized in hunting, and more particularly in butchering. At sites situated at the Seine-Yonne confluence such as Marolles-sur-Seine\n\n27\n\n(Tureau des Gardes and Grand Canton) and Ville-SaintJacques, a distinctive feature of the occupations is the codo"
