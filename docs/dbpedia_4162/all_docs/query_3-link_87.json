        "text": "New York Times\n\n9 August 2016\n\nby Juliet Macur\n\nRIO DE JANEIROIn her 11 Olympics as a coach or leader of a gymnastics team, Martha Karolyi, the often stone-faced and certainly serious coordinator of the United States womens gymnastics national team, has cried only twice.\n\nOnce was at her first Games, in 1976, when she and her husband, Bela, led Nadia Comaneci to a gold medal in the all-around.\n\nThe second time was Tuesday, at these Rio Games.\n\nFrom her seat in the Rio Olympic Arena, just above the balance beam, Karolyis eyes grew wet behind her glasses as she watched her squad dominate and win the team gold medal. The American team was dazzlingthe best team ever, Karolyi acknowledged afterwardas it won in a landslide over Russia, finishing ahead by 8.2 points, a grand canyon of a gap in asport that calculates margins by thousandths of a point.\n\nJust before the medal ceremony, the United States team ran over to Karolyi to celebrate and shared some news: They finally had come up with a nickname for themselves.\n\nAt the 2012 London Games, where her United States team also won gold, it called itself the Fierce Five. This time, the gymnasts told Karolyi, the team wants to be known as the Final Five.\n\nFinal Five, partly because this is the last Olympics where five women will be on each team. The next Olympics will have only four per team.\n\nBut Final Five mainly because this is Karolyis final Olympics. She is 73 and, after about 40 years in the sport, she is retiring when the Rio Games end.\n\nHearing that the team wanted to honor her, Karolyi began to weep. She gathered the gymnasts for a group hug of sparkly red, white and blue leotards and told them she loved them.\n\nFrom my nature, Im really not a sentimental person, honestly, Karolyi said afterward. Im known for being very tough. So I felt, Oh, whats happening to me? What is this?\n\nShe paused.\n\nIts just, Final Five, she said, before trailing off as she teared up again. Its crushing.\n\nCrushing because, within about a weeks time, a lifetime of successful elite gymnastics will come to an end. It cant last forever, after all. Karolyi, who wears a bejeweled Team U.S.A. necklace, said its time for her to be a normal person again. Her plan, Bela said, is to visit her family back in her native Romania, maybe spend four or five months there out of the year.\n\nHer career was so good while it lasted.\n\nIn the mid-70s, she and Bela began coaching together in Romania and became a power couple in the sport. He was the boisterous cheerleader, the emotional one. She was the quiet technician who knew exactly how to tweak a gymnast to make her great.\n\nAnd through the years, they trained so many greats.\n\nIn Romania, it was Comaneci. Then, after they moved to the United States, it was Mary Lou Retton, who won an Olympic gold medal in the all-around in 1984. Next came Kim Zmeskal, the world champion in the all-around in 1991, and Kerri Strug, the sweetheart of the 1996 Atlanta Games.\n\nIt wasnt until 2001 that Martha Karolyi took over as national team coordinator for the women, replacing Bela, who retired after a disappointing 2000 Olympics, in which the United States team was fourth. That is when the United States team officially began its semi-centralized training system, which was the system the Karolyis had been pushing for.\n\nIn that system, gymnasts train with their personal coaches, but attend monthly, weeklong national team training camps to be evaluated by national team staff.\n\nI think the training camps are key, said Aly Raisman, the team captain who on Tuesday won her third Olympic gold medal. Its where we are evaluated and compared to each other, in a healthy way. We wouldnt be here without that system.\n\nThe camp is held at the Karolyis 2,000-acre ranch in the middle of Sam Houston National Forest, north of Houston. Its where the Karolyis live. Its also where Martha Karolyi focuses her deep brown eyes on each gymnast, finding both big and minuscule ways for that gymnast to improve. Athletes start going to camp when they are 9 or 10, so the potential superstars can be identified and groomed into champions early.\n\nAt camp, gymnasts stay in cabins together, eat meals together, hang out together. Coaches also socialize, which they rarely did in the past, and share training tips.\n\nOnce you install a system and unite the gymnasts and the coaches, you will be improving every year, and we have improved every year under this, Karolyi said. I think at this moment, thats why we can say that United States dominates the world of gymnastics.\n\nThe American women have now won the last five major competitions. They have also won the past three Olympic all-around titles. The United States is poised to win a fourth all-around gold, too, when Simone Biles takes to the floor Thursday.\n\nThis American team is anchored by Biles, a three-time world champion in the all-around who might just be the best female gymnast ever.\n\nBut even when Biles was performing her floor routine Tuesday, Karolyi couldnt relax. It was the teams final routine of the afternoon, and Bilesworld champion on floorwas nailing it. Her landings were so solid that her soles seemed coated in super glue. Later, Karolyi said she had never seen a woman tumble so well, so sky-high.\n\nYet there she was during the routine, on the edge of her seat and gripping the railing in front of her, as if her life depended on it. The gymnasts could feel her presence. They even searched for her, and often, so they could lock eyes and get a shot of confidence from her.\n\nWe always look for her, always, Gabby Douglas, the 2012 Olympic champion in the all-around, said on Tuesday after winning yet another gold. Because we couldnt do any of this without her.\n\nYet future teams will have to.\n\nBiles said that she didnt believe Karolyi was really retiring, and that if Karolyi heard the team cracking, Karolyi would be back to fix it.\n\nKarolyi, though, says her decision is final. Her and Belas ranch and its training camps will live on, though.\n\nU.S.A. Gymnastics will still use the ranch as a training center, though Bela and Martha wont be in charge of managing it. From time to time, Martha admits, she might walk down her dirt driveway to check out the gymnasts in the gym, just to see if they are going in the right direction. She said that she was proud to leave such a successful system behind, so generations of future gymnasts could benefit from it.\n\nI will probably enjoy to take a peek here and there, she said.\n\nUntil then, she must focus on gymnastics for a few more days. Still to come are the all-around and event finals. But for a national team, the team final is the biggest day. And to succeed on that day is what counts.\n\nIn the minutes after the medal ceremony, as the American women posed for photos and examined their gold medals, Bela gave Martha one of his signature bearhugs. He told her he was proud of her.\n\nFantastic closing, he said.\n\nShe answered, with tears, Yes, I feel the same way.\n\nNew York Times\n\n21 June 2016\n\nby Sam Roberts\n\nVictor Stanculescu, an agile former Romanian general who arranged the escape of the Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, then joined the insurgent government and engineered Mr. Ceausescus trial and execution three days later, died on Sunday in Saftica, in southern Romania. He was 88.\n\nHis death was announced by his lawyer, Catalin Dancu.\n\nGeneral Stanculescu (pronounced stahn-kul-ESS-ko) was first deputy defense minister when he was dispatched by Mr. Ceausescu to Timisoara, in western Romania, to suppress a pro-democracy protest.\n\nBut after ordering security forces to fire on unarmed dissidents on Dec. 17, 1989, Mr. Ceausescu, the countrys last Communist leader and its brutally Stalinist head of state for two decades, lost control of his army as the revolt spread. Nearly 100 civilians were killed in Timisoara alone.\n\nSniffing Mr. Ceausescus defeat, General Stanculescu quickly returned to Bucharest, where he faked a broken leg to avoid further counterrevolutionary deployment. Promoted to defense minister after the incumbent minister killed himself, he helped Mr. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, flee by helicopter from the roof of party headquarters.\n\nBut fearing that the copter had been spotted by radar and would be shot down, the pilot hastily landed. Mr. Ceausescu hijacked a passing car, but he and his wife were soon surrounded and arrested.\n\nAfter the couple were captured, General Stanculescu organized their trial by a military court and recruited the firing squad (before the verdict, by some accounts) that executed them on Christmas Day. He then joined the new government.\n\nGeneral Stanculescu served as minister of defense and minister of industry until 1991.\n\nBeginning as early as 1990, a government commission recommended several times that General Stanculescu be tried for his actions in Timisoara, but he managed to elude each attempted prosecution until 2008, when he was convicted of aggravated manslaughter. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and paroled in 2014.\n\nI did not order any unit under my command in Timisoara to carry out any acts of repression, General Stanculescu told the BBC in 2009.\n\nHe said he had helped the Ceausescus escape because If we had left it to the people of Bucharest, they would have lynched them in the street. Asked if the summary trial and execution was just, he replied, It was not just, but it was necessary.\n\nVictor Atanasie Stanculescu was born on May 10, 1928, in Tecuci, Moldavia, in eastern Romania. His father, Constantin Stanculescu, was an aviation lieutenant; his mother, the former Aurora Martac, an accounting professor. His father died when he was 5.\n\nAfter graduating from the Military School of Artillery in Sibiu in 1949 and the Special Artillery Officer Academy in Bucharest, he pursued an army career.\n\nGeneral Stanculescus wife, Elena, with whom he had a daughter, killed herself in 2003, apparently despondent over the repeated attempts to prosecute him after his allies in the government lost power.\n\nThe violent manner of Ceausescus demise set Romanias experience of political change apart from that of the other East European states, Professor Dennis J. Deletant, of the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, said in a lecture there in 2012.\n\nWhereas Ceausescu succeeded in uniting Romanians in opposition to him, his fall threw them into confusion, Professor Deletant said. What the Romanian revolution does demonstrate is that the heroes die, the fighters go home, and opportunists make their way to the fore.\n\nIn an interview with the novelist Dinu Sararu, General Stanculescu concurred with the professor, but in more personal terms. Only the dead are heroes! he said. I never wanted to die, and thats why Im not a hero!\n\nNew York Times\n\n3 July 2016\n\nby Reuters\n\nActivist and writer Elie Wiesel, the World War Two death camp survivor who won a Nobel Peace Prize for becoming the life-long voice of millions of Holocaust victims, died on Saturday. He was 87.\n\nWiesel was a philosopher, speaker, playwright and professor who also campaigned for the tyrannized and forgotten around the world. He died at his home in New York City, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe Romanian-born Wiesel lived by the credo expressed in \"Night,\" his landmark story of the Holocaust\"to forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time.\"\n\nIn awarding the Peace Prize in 1986, the Nobel Committee praised him as a \"messenger to mankind\" and \"one of the most important spiritual leaders and guides in an age when violence, repression and racism continue to characterize the world.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Wiesel as a ray of light, and said his extraordinary personality and unforgettable books demonstrated the triumph of the human spirit over the most unimaginable evil.\n\n\"Out of the darkness of the Holocaust, Elie became a powerful force for light, truth and dignity,\" he said.\n\nRonald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said that Wiesel had taught people not to be silent where they saw injustice and that the void caused by his death could not be filled.\n\n\"We have lost the most articulate witness to history's greatest crime,\" he said.\n\nWiesel did not waver in his campaign never to let the world forget the Holocaust horror. While at the White House in 1985 to receive the Congressional Gold Medal, he even rebuked U.S. President Ronald Reagan for planning to lay a wreath at a German cemetery where some of Hitler's notorious Waffen SS troops were buried.\n\n\"Don't go to Bitburg,\" Wiesel said. \"That place is not your place. Your place is with the victims of the SS.\"\n\nWiesel became close to U.S. President Barack Obama but the friendship did not deter him from criticizing U.S. policy on Israel. He spoke out in favor of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem and pushed the United States and other world powers to take a harder stance against Iran over its nuclear program.\n\nObama remembered him as \"one of the great moral voices of our time, and in many ways, the conscience of the world.\"\n\nWiesel had raised his voice, not just against anti-Semitism, but against hatred, bigotry and intolerance in all forms, Obama said in a statement.\n\n\"His life, and the power of his example, urges us to be better. In the face of evil, we must summon our capacity for good. In the face of hate, we must love,\" Obama said.\n\nWiesel attended the joint session of the U.S. Congress in 2015 when Netanyahu spoke on the dangers of Iran's program.\n\nGerman President Joachim Gauck wrote to Wiesel's wife Marion saying: \"Your husband knew how to use vivid and empathic words to keep the memory of the darkest years of German history that he witnessed alive and to warn young people especially of the dangers of right-wing extremism and xenophobia.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said a \"voice of morality and humanity has fallen silent\".\n\nWiesel and his foundation both were victims of the wide-ranging Ponzi scheme run by New York financier Bernie Madoff, with Wiesel and his wife losing their life's savings and the foundation losing $15.2 million. \"'Psychopath'it's too nice a word for him,\" he said of Madoff in 2009.\n\nWiesel was a hollow-eyed 16-year-old when he emerged from the newly liberated Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945. He had been orphaned by the Nazis and their identification number, A-7713, was tattooed on his arm as a physical manifestation of his broken faith and the nightmares that would haunt him throughout his life.\n\nWiesel and his family had first been taken by the Nazis from the village of Sighetu Marmatiei in the Transylvania region of Romania to Auschwitz, where his mother and one of his sisters died. Wiesel and his father, Shlomo, ended up in Buchenwald, where Shlomo died. In \"Night\" Wiesel wrote of his shame at lying silently in his bunk while his father was beaten nearby.\n\nAfter the war Wiesel made his way to France, studied at the Sorbonne and by 19 had become a journalist. He pondered suicide and never wrote of or discussed his Holocaust experience until 10 years after the war as a part of a vow to himself. He was 27 years old in 1955 when \"Night\" was published in Yiddish, and Wiesel would later rewrite it for a world audience.\n\n\"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed ...,\" Wiesel wrote. \"Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live.\"\n\nAsked by an interviewer in 2000 why he did not go insane, Wiesel said, \"To this day that is a mystery to me.\"\n\nBy 2008, \"Night\" had sold an estimated 10 million copies, according to the New York Times, including 3 million after talk-show hostess Oprah Winfrey made it a spotlight selection for her book club in 2006.\n\nIn 1985 Wiesel helped break ground in Washington for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and the following year was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In typical fashion, he dedicated the prize to all those who survived the Nazi horror, calling them \"an example to humankind how not to succumb to despair.\"\n\nWiesel, who became a U.S. citizen in 1963, was slight in stature but a compelling figure when he spoke. With a chiseled profile, burning eyes and a shock of gray hair, he could silence a crowd by merely standing up.\n\nHe was often described as somber. An old friend, Chicago professor Irving Abrahamson, once said of him: \"I've never seen Elie give a belly laugh. He'll chuckle, he'll smile, there'll be a twinkle in his eye. But never a laugh from within.\"\n\nA few years after winning the peace prize, he set up the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity, which, in addition to Israeli and Jewish causes, campaigned for Miskito Indians in Nicaragua, Cambodian refugees, victims of South African apartheid and of famine and genocide in Africa.\n\nWiesel wrote more than 50 booksnovels, non-fiction, memoirs, and many with a Holocaust themeand held a long-running professorship at Boston University. In one of his later books, \"Open Heart,\" he used his 2011 quintuple-bypass surgery as impetus for reflection on his life.\n\nI have already been the beneficiary of so many miracles, which I know I owe to my ancestors,\" he wrote. \"All I have achieved has been and continues to be dedicated to their murdered dreamsand hopes.\"\n\nHe collected scores of awards and honors, including an honorary knighthood in Britain. Obama presented him the National Humanities Medal in 2009.\n\nWiesel was attacked in a San Francisco hotel in 2007 by a 22-year-old Holocaust denier, but not injured.\n\nWiesel and wife Marion married in 1969 and their son, Elisha, was born in 1972.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ari Rabinovitch in Jerusalem and Michelle Martin in Berlin; Editing by Diane Craft and Dan Grebler)\n\nNew York Times\n\nby Jason Farago\n\n16 June 2016\n\nIts 1920. The Great War is over; revolution has come to Russia; a new German constitution has been adopted in Weimar. Tristan Tzara, the Romanian poet and gadfly who waited out the war in Switzerland, has moved to Paris. He is just 24, but he was at the core of Dada, the previous decades most eruptive cultural phenomenonand he is in the mood for publicity. He sends letters to people on both sides of the Atlantic seeking artistic contributions to a magnum opus for the anti-movement that turned the senselessness of world war into something convulsive.\n\nTzara receives more than four dozen replies. The artists all submit images and texts for Dadaglobe, an anthology he plans to distribute worldwide in a hefty edition of 10,000 copies. The publication, so he imagines, will be as disruptive as Dada was when it burst out of a cabaret in sleepy Zurich in 1916. There needs to be throughout a whirling, dizzy, eternal, new atmosphere, the poet insists. It should look like a great display of new art in an open-air circus. Every page must explode.\n\nDadaglobe, though, was never published. Francis Picabia, its main backer, broke with Tzara in 1921, and the materials were dispersed. The plans, the ambitions and the unrealized potential of that publication are the subject of Dadaglobe Reconstructed, a rigorous yet sparky exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, which brings together the portraits, drawings and collages Tzara commissioned for Dadaglobe, plus a few paintings and sculptures by some of its leading adherents and sympathizers: Marcel Duchamp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp and Constantin Brancusi.\n\nEnjoyable as the exhibition isthe photographs, correspondence and publishing ephemera will be catnip to Dada freaks and magazine geeksits catalog may be the more important accomplishment. Assiduously edited by the independent curator Adrian Sudhalter, it features a full reconstruction of this magazine that never was, full of puns, poems and Duchamps chess notations, assembled with diligence and guesswork over 160 pages. Its a substantial contribution to the history of interwar art, although you will need a mastery of French, German and Dada gibberish to read it. The show has been organized by Ms. Sudhalter and Samantha Friedman, a MoMA assistant curator, in collaboration with the Kunsthaus Zürich, where it appeared this spring. (Dadaglobe Reconstructed is the smaller of two collaborations between MoMA and Kunsthaus Zürich, which has one of the worlds richest Dada holdings. A major retrospective of Picabia opened this month in Zurichto good reviews from Swiss criticsand opens at MoMA on Nov. 20.\n\nIn his solicitation letters, written on ritzy, pseudo-corporate Dada stationery, Tzara instructed his fellow artists to provide two or three reproductions of their work, to be presented alongside drawings, a book page with text and photographs of themselves, which you can alter freely, although it should retain clarity. The contributors, some of whom were only tangentially Dadaist, went wild with that last instruction. Theo van Doesburg pictured himself from behind, encircled his head with the high-Dada motto I am against everything and everyone, in French, and signed it with a pseudonym. Taeuber-Arp appears in a cloche hat and birdcage veil, half-obscured by one of her abstracted wooden busts. Picabias chosen portrait (a recent MoMA acquisition) is a study in hipster prodigality: a roughly sutured photocollage in which Picabia, a wealthy French-Cuban, tears his own face and captions himself as a nouveau-riche failure.\n\nThere are also a few documentary photos mixed into the show. At one knees-up party, we see Tzara with Picabia and other fellow travelers wearing black tie, the word Dada scrawled across his forehead.\n\nThe focus on Tzaras unrealized publication makes Dadaglobe Reconstructed quite a different show from MoMAs 2006 Dada blowout, which divided the movements experiments and impostures by city: Zurich, Berlin, Cologne, Hannover, New York and Paris. This one treats Dadaspecifically later Dada, from the end of the war to its evaporation in the early 1920sas an international network, linked by the mail and photomechanical reproduction. That networked approach ends up sidelining some of Dadas lone wolves, such as Kurt Schwitters, and revalorizing less famous figures center to Dadas development. Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, designated Dadas secretary on its letterhead, contributed spare drawings of circles, crosses and curves given mock-hieratic names like Strange Suns and God on a Bicycle. The underappreciated Swiss artist Jean Crotti wrote nonsense verse on a typewriter, then overlaid it with modern-day geometric forms. They find a visual parallel in an angular gouache by Crottis wife, Suzanne Duchamp, which imagines the unconscious as a factory.\n\nAs for Suzannes brother, living in New York, he did not create new works for the publication. Marcel Duchamps submission instead was a photo reproduction of To Be Looked At (From the Other Side of the Glass) With One Eye, Close to, for Almost an Hour, his small 1918 painting on glass, as well as a mechanistic portrait of his Bride, a recurrent figure before he abandoned painting. This show includes both the original works and their reproductions. In the case of the work on glass, it was photographed from its rear face, blacking out the text on the front-facing side and revealing a Brancusi sculpture that happened to be in the room at the same time. The unique artwork, for Duchamp and for Tzara as well, was only one node in an infinitely propagating chain of reproductions and revisions.\n\nThats what makes Dadaglobe Reconstructed especially relevant in our own moment of political disorder and media disruption. Tzara and the Dadaists cared less about artworks as discrete objects and more about how art could be transmitted across newly developed international networks. Circulation, not value, was the aim. Thinking like Tzara did about how art can circulate beyond the museumand mutate as it circulatesis no less important for todays artists, who can exploit a global communication network the Dadaists could only dream of.\n\nDadaglobe Reconstructed runs through Sept. 18 at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan; 212-708-9400; moma.org.\n\nNew York Times\n\nby Palko Karasz\n\n6 June 2016\n\nBUCHAREST, RomaniaIn the 24 years that Nicolae Ceausescu ruled Romania, the mansion where he lived with his wife, Elena, was shrouded in secrecy.\n\nNo ordinary citizen could get near the villa in a well-heeled neighborhood in northern Bucharest. But rumors abounded about its lavish décorthe gold-plated bathroom fixtures, the closets packed with Elenas furs, clothing and shoes, and the mosaic-lined indoor swimming pool.\n\nAfter the Ceausescus were toppledand executed by a firing squad on Dec. 25, 1989, in the bloodiest of the revolutions that tore down the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europethe state news agency excoriated the extraordinary luxury of their home. Ordinary Romanians, living on strict food and fuel rations, were enraged by the Ceausescus lifestyle.\n\nBorn in Romania but raised in Hungary, I was just a young child when the Ceausescus met their end. But I spent that Christmas and many summers that followed with relatives in Transylvania, listening to their stories of the privations of the Communist period. By the time I grew up, most Romanians I knew had moved on, or wanted to do so.\n\nYet when the Romanian government opened the Ceausescu mansion as a museum in March, I was intrigued. So I signed up for a guided tour, which costs about $11. The mansion has received about 8,000 visitors since the opening.\n\nKnown as the Palatul Primaverii, or Spring Palace, the villa is spacious30 rooms, 53,000 square feet, with gardens designated for winter and summerbut not quite opulent by palace standards. The mansion itself is well kept, with cleaners busy wiping windows and the constant hum of a lawn mower coming from the garden.\n\nThe area, with homes originally intended for employees of Bucharests gas and electricity plant but which were later reserved for officials of the Communist elite, remains exclusive.\n\nVisitors are asked to put on blue shoe coverings before stepping inside. Our guide, Andrei Stancu, a slender and bookish man in his mid 20s, told us that the Ceausescus, both born into peasant families, always took off their shoes at the door to preserve the carpets.\n\nMr. Stancu led us through more than a dozen rooms decorated in a mix of late Renaissance and Rococo styles. He pointed out each crystal chandelier and Flemish tapestry. In room after room, he took note of the Romanian brandsMedias crystal, Cisnadie carpetsthat are now struggling or defunct.\n\nThe mood lightened when Mr. Stancu shared stories of the Ceausescus, all of them cautiously nonpolitical.\n\nIn the padded cinema, he explained that Nicolae Ceausescu enjoyed American movies. He had a soft spot for Westerns and for the television series Kojak, about a big-hearted New York City detective played by Telly Savalas. For Romanians back then, television was limited to sober homegrown productions, many of them propagandistic.\n\nNext to the couples bed, which looked freshly made, we learned that Ms. Ceausescu, known for her luxurious wardrobe, wore only mens pajamas.\n\nA brochure quotes her housekeeper describing how the comrade would get down on her stomach, demonstrating the right way to dust under a bed.\n\nThe children on the tour were delighted by the indoor swimming pool, now drained of water and filled instead with a drab exhibition about the Ceausescus on holidays or foreign visits.\n\nHowever heavily decorated, the mansion is nothing like the House of the People a few miles away. At four million square feet, that concrete fortress built by Ceausescu and often compared in size to the Pentagon, now houses the Romanian Parliament.\n\nWhile the House of the People is open for public tours, nobody tells you that a quarter of Bucharest was demolished for that thing, that people died on that building site, said Radu Preda, executive president of the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and the Memory of Romanian Exile, a government agency charged with studying the Ceausescu regime. While it was under construction, Romanians had to put up with cold and hunger.\n\nOn the Spring Palace tour, far more attention was paid to upholstery and porcelain than to the brutalities of a Communist dictatorship.\n\nMany of my fellow visitors were fine with the lack of political context. Im impressed, Silvia Rosman, 61, a visitor from Tel Aviv who left Romania before Ceausescu came to power in 1965, said of our tour guide. I loved his presentationwithout bitterness or criticism.\n\nThe government agency in charge of the mansion seemed to want to draw such reactions.\n\nWe present the house, and it is up to everyone to draw their own conclusions, said Alexandru Niculae, an official with the agency. We are neither trying to demonize Ceausescu, the man or the leadernor providing him with alibis or offering excuses for what happened.\n\nMr. Niculae said most of the guides his agency hired are too young to have lived under the regime, in an effort to keep the tours neutral. Some scholars see that approach as a missed opportunity, or even a tone-deaf reflection of Romanias troubled relationship with its history.\n\nIn this country of 20 million, the feared secret police, the Securitate, maintained a network of around 100,000 informers in the years before the Ceausescus fell, according to Florian Banu, a researcher at the secret police archives. Many who collaborated with the regime kept their jobs after Communism fell.\n\nIn one small example, two housekeepers who looked after the villa under the Ceausescus still work there today.\n\nRomania joined the European Union in 2007, along with Bulgaria, but on the condition that it submit to regular reviews from Brussels because of the countrys long struggle with corruption. Officially, the former Communist government is condemned in the strongest terms by the current Romanian leadership.\n\nWe can no longer allow ourselves to ignore the lessons of the past, President Klaus Iohannis, the first president from Romanias ethnic German minority, said as he took office in 2014.\n\nWhen I lived in Bucharest in 2008 and 2009 for a journalism internship, the once-drab capital was experiencing a building boom. Colorful billboards covered much of the gray concrete, and the palace everyone was talking about was that of Gigi Becali, a real estate tycoon and soccer team owner who installed a life-size statue of Jesus in front of his home. (Mr. Becali was later imprisoned for corruption.)\n\nOn my visit in March, many Romanians told me that with endemic corruption and the political unrest that forced out the prime minister in November, this relatively young democracy had yet to absorb the lessons of its past.\n\nReal corruption was born in Communist times, when we thought one way and acted in another, and what existed was not what was said, said Mr. Preda of the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and the Memory of Romanian Exile.\n\nHe has been advocating the establishment of a museum of Communism, as cities like Berlin or Budapest have done. He called both the Palatul Primaverii and the House of the People surrogates for such an institution, and said he hoped guided tours both in the Spring Palace and the House of the People would evolve to describe more of the history and less of the fixtures.\n\nHow can you understand freedom if you dont know, if you havent seen, what its absence means? he asked.\n\nFollow Palko Karasz on Twitter @karaszpalko.\n\nThe Ceausescu Regime\n\n1965 Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the leader of Romania's Communist Party since the end of World War II, dies.

She immediately notices an odd detail: A fox-fur hearth rug she has owned for years has had its tail cut off. She next comes home to discover a hind leg severed from the pelt, and once more to find another leg removed. What in the world? In this particular world no detail is without meaning, and all meanings are potentially lethal. It is the late 1980s, in the Panopticon security state of Nicolae Ceausescu, and the mutilated rug convinces Adina that Big Brother is closing in on her.\n\nAn air of Soviet-era menace engulfs The Fox Was Ever the Hunter, Herta Müller's remarkable novelnewly released in English and given a lucid translation by Philip Boehm. When Müller received the 2009 Nobel Prize in literature, the Swedish Academy described her as a writer who \"depicts the landscape of the dispossessed.\" The Fox, published originally in German in 1992, is one of Müller's early works, and it draws on what she suffered while clenched in the jaws of one of history's most notorious dictatorships. But she infuses characters and events with surreal elements and heightened levels of metaphor that make this much more than a roman à clef.\n\nWhere Adina lives, the children have \"clusters of warts like gray berries, fingers like turkey necks.\" One boy tells Adina that his mother speaks of hidden drawers \"in the tree trunks, in the grass, in the fence, in the walls.\" Each drawer has an ear inside, the mother says, and they are always listening. A paranoiac, as William S. Burroughs once said, is someone in complete possession of the facts.\n\nIn The Fox Was Ever the Hunter, characters don't live their lives, they perform them matter of factly, with the state as an ever-watchful, ever-predatory audience. Physical detail communicates psychological realities: \"The street runs by, the city is a black thimble with steep sides, the housing blocks as narrow as foreheads.\" Müller frequently dwells on the town's poplar trees that \"carve the hot air,\" that are \"green knives.\" \"Disaster is always unadorned and as bare as winter wood,\" she writes. Her images come at us with a stark brutality; outside the town sheep graze, so famished by the end of summer that they \"lick the walls\" of a slaughterhouse.\n\nHunger is everywhere, coursing through bodies like blood. When the despot Ceausescu and his horror-handmaiden wife, Elena Petrescu, were executed in 1989, the charges leveled against them included genocide by starvation, and this is reflected in the novel by the meager foodstuffs characters consumerancid sunflower seeds, wormy apples and nuts with meats like \"brains.\" One of Adina's crimes is to exhort her hungry students to eat the tomatoes they are dragooned into harvesting. At one point she remembers her childhood, the \"dust behind the streetcar, and on the sidewalk the footsteps of tall, emaciated men earning money to buy bread.\"\n\nAdina is joined in the narrative by her friends Paul, a doctor; Clara, a factory worker; and Ilie, a soldier with whom she has a long-distance romance. What are young radicals to do? Well, they could start a band, an anti-authoritarian strategy that would later work to such strong effect with Russia's Pussy Riot. Paul plays guitar, and he and his bandmates begin to perform a song that goes, as we would say nowadays, viral.\n\nThe anthem, \"Face Without Face,\" is a far cry from the songs Romanian schoolchildren of the era were forced to learn, praising the party, the leader and the nation. Snatches of the lyrics seem to float in the air: \"Face without face/Forehead of sand/Voice without voice/Nothing is left/Except for time.\" When the group performs its strange conceptual rallying cry onstage, agents of the Romanian secret police, the Securitate, evacuate the theater.\n\n\"Tell a dream, lose a reader,\" Henry James pronounces, but Müller provides exceptions to the rule. Here, dreams become extensions of life, or life itself is a dream; they are cut, at any rate, from one and the same fabric, consistently lurid and terrifying. Witchery in the form of \"melon blood\" is used to capture men's affections. A tiger-striped cat has eaten her annual litter of kittens for years. We see a living man with a hatchet blade stuck in his skull. This is the reality of Ceausescu's Romania, where Adina attempts to survive. No nightmare could be worse.\n\nJean Zimmerman's latest novel, Savage Girl, is out now in paperback. She posts daily at Blog Cabin.\n\nNew York Times\n\nby Michael Cooper\n\n12 April 2016\n\nAdministrative tumult, a prominent snub on the Bucharest National Operas website and questions over artistic direction have cost the Romanian national ballet company its two biggest stars: Johan Kobborg and Alina Cojocaru. Mr. Kobborg resigned Tuesday as its artistic director and his fiancée, the dancer Ms. Cojocaru, said she would not dance under the current management.\n\nTheir departures end a period in which the companys global reputation began to rise under the leadership of Mr. Kobborg, a former principal dancer at the Royal Danish Ballet and the Royal Ballet in London who became artistic director a little over two years ago, and through the dancing of Ms. Cojocaru, an international star and principal at the English National Ballet, who was a permanent guest artist in her native Bucharest.\n\nThe trouble began earlier this month when a new interim general manager, Tiberiu-Ionuţ Soare, took over at the opera house, which is home to the ballet. One of his first actions was to remove Mr. Kobborgs title on the website as artistic director of the ballet, and to place him among the companys artists, a low rank comparable to the corps de ballet in other companies.\n\nMr. Soares explanation was that the company did not technically have an artistic director position in its administrative structure. But the move was seen in some circles as an attempt to undo the changes the company had made in recent years. It also raised questions about the direction of the company, which is state-run, in a time of political upheaval in Romaniaand about how international it wanted to be.\n\nThe slight to Mr. Kobborg created an uproar in the dance world, where he is a respected figure, and soon threw the company into tumult, with dancers threatening not to perform and even to leave the company. There was also concern about whether the company would continue to have the legal rights to perform some of the repertory Mr. Kobborg had brought to it. Increasingly bitter accusations were traded back and forth, including on social media.\n\nA new interim general manager, Vladimir Conta, was brought in to try to smooth things over, but on Tuesday Mr. Kobborg resigned.\n\nI fear for what the future might bring for the Opera Nationala Bucuresti and for the credibility of Romanian culture and the light in which Romanian culture will be viewed, he wrote in a resignation letter that he posted on social media and then handed in on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Conta, the new interim general manager, lamented Mr. Kobborgs decision to leave, saying in a telephone interview that his contributions there were significant, and his productions have been successful.\n\nIt started with a really unfortunate event, all of which could have been solved easily, he said. But instead of that it augmented and it augmented and became a scandal.\n\nA final straw was how the company handled Ms. Cojocarus decision not to dance over the weekend in Kenneth MacMillans Manon, which the company staged for the first time this month.\n\nMs. Cojocaru had posted on Twitter that she would be performing ONLY under the management that made this ballet happen for our audience to enjoy, with @KOBBORG as our leader!! Her scheduled partner, Friedemann Vogel, later posted that Out of respect for @KOBBORG and @DancingAlina I do not feel it is possible to perform in @OperaBucharest under these circumstances.\n\nBut management announced that she would not appear because her partner was indisposed. Ms. Cojocaru said in an interview that she objected to that announcement, feeling that it was not honest. Mr. Conta said it had been done that way because he believed the official pronouncement should be short and clear, and that he should be able to elaborate elsewhere.\n\nI am sorry that it happened this way, because I think Alina is one of the greatest dancers in the world, he said.\n\nMs. Cojocaru said she was sorry that the company had lost someone of Mr. Kobborgs talents.\n\nHe created a family, and its something rare in a theater, she said in an interview. He was a director that, at 12 oclock at night, would call me wherever I was and say what a fantastic show hed witnessed, and that he feels maybe, in half a years time, this company can perform that, and that, and that ballet, because they are getting there. And then he would say, with the repertoire that is growing, we would be able to show this company to the world.\n\nBBC News\n\nby Lorelei Mihala\n\n11 April 2016\n\nIn the maelstrom of the Romanian revolution, filmmaker Vlad Paunescu found himself appointed as minister of culturefor a few hours.\n\nMr Paunescu, who today owns and runs Romania's largest film studio, Castel Film, was a 37-year old-cinematographer living in the country's capital Bucharest back in 1989.\n\nWhen the revolution broke out in December of that year, he picked up his camera and rushed to film the mass protests outside the vast palace of the parliament building, where the then communist government was based.\n\nAfter Romania's leader Nicolae Ceausescu fled by helicopter, Mr Paunescu joined the protesters who stormed the building.\n\nAmidst the euphoria and sense of hope, Mr Paunescu, now 63, says he and a fellow cameraman did a \"dance of happiness\".\n\nThe protesters occupying the palace decided to form a new administration, and as Mr Paunescu worked in the film industry he was tasked with leading the department of culture.\n\nYet only a few hours later, a more formal interim government was appointed instead, and Mr Paunescu's political career was over before it had properly started. So he went back to his job at the state-run film studio, Buftea.\n\nBut with the Eastern European country opening up to both the world and private business, in 1992 Mr Paunescu registered his own business, Castel Film.\n\nCastel Film has gone on to build a vast 11 hectare (27 acre) film studio 40km (25 miles) outside Bucharest, and remains much in demand among the big American film and TV companies.\n\nEveryone from Paramount to Miramax, Universal and Sony Pictures, regularly uses Castel Film to help them make movies in Romania. Such films include the Oscar-winning Cold Mountain, and Borat.\n\nCastel's studio has no less than nine soundstages and four permanent setsan urban street, a US wild west town, a mediaeval town and village.\n\nFor Mr Paunescu, who is worth an estimated 11m ($13m; £9m), it is a far cry from his younger days under communism, when he earned so little as a filmmaker for the communist government that he had to also drive a taxi to supplement his income.\n\n'Beautiful country'\n\nIt is often said that out of adversity comes opportunity, and in Mr Paunescu's case, it was the Yugoslavian wars of the 1990s that gave him his biggest career break.\n\nBack in the early 1990s a US film crew was filming a movie in Yugoslavia (today's Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Macedonia) which bordered Romania.\n\nWhen fighting broke out in Yugoslavia, the US film crew fled to Romania, which Mr Paunescu says they found \"a beautiful country, with qualified personnel in the industry, and the studios from Buftea\".\n\nMr Paunescu was asked to provide some examples of his filming work, and the Americans were so impressed they employed him as a director of photography.\n\nAfter a couple more successful films, Mr Paunescu and his costume designer wife Oana were invited to Los Angeles to discuss future plans, and it was proposed that he set up his own film-making business to help American studios make more movies in Romania.\n\nSo with some backing from Hollywood, Castel Film was up and running.\n\nIt now makes between 10 and 14 movies per year, and in 2014 had an annual turnover of 4.6m.\n\n'No blood'\n\nOn a recent morning at Castel Film's studios, two actors from the Game of Thrones TV show are filming a mini-series about the founders of the well-known US motorbike company Harley Davidson.\n\nTo help them and other visiting overseas crews, Castel employs 114 permanent members of staff.\n\nMr Paunescu is happy to admit that a big reason why Romania is popular with the big US film studios is its low costa day's shooting is typically 70% less than in the US.\n\nYet he says Romania also offers a wealth of other benefits.\n\n\"Actually it is a combination of what we offer in terms of stages, skilled labour, and a beautiful, absolutely superb country,\" says Mr Paunescu. \"We have the Carpathian Mountains, the Danube Delta, Transylvania.\"\n\nIn terms of the type of movies that Castel Film helps make, Mr Paunescu says he is pleased that Hollywood has moved away from the early days when it wanted films about Dracula, the fictional Romanian vampire.\n\nHe says that these releases were not greatly appreciated in the wider Romanian movie industry. \"They were considered blasphemy,\" he says.\n\nWhen it comes to his own taste in films, Mr Paunescu says: \"I don't like to see blood in a movie, I can't stand seeing people who suffer.\n\n\"But at the same time, I don't like comedies too much either. I watch movies that have received important awards, or that have been [at least] nominated.\"\n\nNumerous Hollywood stars have now filmed in Romania with Castel, including Nicolas Cage, Glenn Close, Sharon Stone, Kevin Costner and Steven Seagal, but out of everyone, Mr Paunescu seems most smitten with Nicole Kidman.\n\nHe says that the Oscar-winning actor initially \"seemed untouchable, like a crystal statue\", but after speaking to her, found that she was \"more normal than I am\".\n\nAs Castel Film continues to thriveMr Paunescu is unlikely to ever have to go back to driving taxis.\n\nRadio Free Europe\n\n19 March 2016\n\nby Eugen Tomiuc\n\nHe lunched with Hitler and Mussolini in wartime, but was awarded postwar medals by Truman and Stalin. He met his future wife at the wedding of his cousin, the young Queen Elizabeth, but tended chickens and vegetables as a farmer in England during lean years in exile. He survived to see his beloved Romania emerge from a half-century of Soviet domination, only to be banned by a jittery postcommunist government alarmed by the former monarch's popularity.\n\nNinety-four-year-old King Michael of Romania is a study in contrast.\n\nThe oldest surviving World War II-era head of state and for decades the patriarch of a waning monarchy, he has spent most of his twilight years not in any of a choice of Romanian royal palaces but in a small house overlooking Lake Leman, in the Swiss countryside.\n\nBut this month, with serious health issues mounting, Michael announced his retirement from public life, with duties to be carried out by his eldest daughter, Princess Margareta. He is said to be suffering from chronic leukemia and epidermoid carcinoma.\n\nHis departure draws the curtains on a unique window on the 20th century.\n\nYears ago, during an interview in his Swiss home, the king's eyes lit up as he talked about confronting Romania's feared fascist dictator, Ion Antonescu, in August 1944. Momentum in World War II had shifted dramatically and the then-21-year-old ceremonial head of state ordered the arrest of Antonescua fierce soldier whom Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler had come to respectafter Antonescu refused to break his alliance with the Axis powers.\n\nMichael's action, accomplished with co-conspirators, allowed Romania to switch to the Allied side and had a notable impact on the war. \"From what we know, we...shortened the war by several months,\" he told RFE/RL. \"The whole eastern front in Greece and Yugoslavia collapsed because of us.\"\n\nAntonescu, who was also responsible for the extermination of hundreds of thousands of Jews and Roma during the war, was executed in 1946.\n\nMichael was decorated by both Soviet leader Josef Stalin and U.S. President Harry Truman.\n\nBut that wouldn't help him much after the war, when Romania came under Soviet occupation and political parties were banned and elections falsified to install a Moscow-imposed communist regime.\n\nMichael, under guard by troops loyal to the communist coup leaders, was forced to abdicate and leave the country in December 1947. Once abroad, he renounced his abdication as forced and again took to using the title \"King of Romania.\"\n\nHe also married Anna of Bourbon-Parma, whom he had met at the wedding of his cousin, Queen Elizabeth, and they eventually had five daughters.\n\n'You Don't Forget'\n\nBut while his life in exile was kaleidoscopic, it was not easy. He worked for a Wall Street brokerage, then flew as a test pilot for an aircraft equipment manufacturer. He and his wife even ran a chicken farm in England for a while, before eventually settling in Switzerland.\n\nAs he told it, his endeavors sometimes attracted media attention but never any concrete political backing, as Romania had been abandoned to the Soviet sphere of influence.\n\nIt was only after the demise of both communism and Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in December 1989 that it looked like Michael would finally return home. But Romania's postcommunist authorities kept him away, refusing to restore his citizenship, particularly after he drew an estimated 1 million people to downtown Bucharest on a short visit in 1992.\n\nFinally, in 1997, a newly elected, pro-Western government officially recognized Michael as a Romanian citizen and former head of state.\n\nIn 1992, he refused an offer to run for president on an opposition ticket, snubbing politics, unlike his cousin, Simeon of Saxe-Coburg, who ran for office and became Bulgarian prime minister in 2001.\n\nMichael eventually regained many of his royal family's properties, but he continued to spend most of his time in the house on the shores of Lake Leman.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with RFE/RL, King Michael said that despite the hardships he and his family had been through, he held no personal grudges.\n\nBut he warned that the suffering communism had imposed on the Romanian people should not be forgotten. \"Because tens of millions of people have been destroyed practically, gone through absolute hell, and then suddenly they say, 'Well, it's all finished, let's forget it.' You don't forget it,\" he said.\n\nRadio Free Europe\n\n12 March 2016\n\nby Eugen Tomiuc\n\nIf Moldova wants to integrate with the West, the best way forward would be to modernize its infrastructure and strengthen its democratic institutions.\n\nThat's the advice given by American journalist and author Robert Kaplan, who argues in his latest book, In Europe's Shadow, that Russian President Putin's recent moves against Ukraine have pushed Romania and Moldova to the front line of the West's confrontation with Moscow.\n\nIn drawing on his travels in communist Romania in the 1970s, and charting the nation's complicated past and future following recent visits , the author could not ignore Moldova's deep historical ties to the current NATO and EU member.\n\nHe argues in one chapter that the two neighboring countries, although together on the front line of a \"new Cold War\" triggered by Russia's actions in Ukraine, are far apart.\n\nHe described their differences as \"stark,\" during an interview with RFE/RL on March 7. \"And they are stark because one country has been in the EU for almost a decade now and one is kind of still trapped in a kind of post-Soviet sub-development.\"\n\nExistential Threat\n\nToday, says Kaplan, Moldova finds itself in a fight for its survival as a state.\n\n\"What Moldova needs to dofirst of all, the most important thing, and this is true of Romania as wellis to strengthen its institutions, make them sturdier and more transparent, less corrupt,\" Kaplan told RFE/RL.\n\nMoldova has seen months of anticorruption protests prompted by the disappearance of more than $1 billion from three banks in 2014, a scandal that led to the downfall of the government.\n\nThe resulting political crisis threatens to reverse Moldova's recent efforts to integrate with the West and turn the former Soviet republic back toward Moscow's orbit.\n\nKaplan advises the new governmentwhose introduction in January rekindled antigovernment protests calling for early elections that could bring pro-Kremlin forces to powerto tread carefully if it wants to continue on a Westward course.\n\n\"Moldova should seek a stronger association membership with the European Union, and some sort of associated membership with NATO, but it cannot join formally these large institutions of the West without leading to a Russian backlash,\" he says.\n\nChisinau is pursuing EU membership, having signed an EU Association Agreement in 2014. Moldova cooperates with NATO through its membership in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the Partnership for Peace program, but is constitutionally neutral and has no plans to join the alliance.\n\nKaplan suggests that, ultimately, Moldova should strive to preserve its historical status as a buffer state between Russia and the West.\n\n\"Moldova, for reasons of geography and history, sad to say, you know, is somewhat a neutral buffer state that cannot... that should not join either alliance for the time being,\" said Kaplan.\n\nReunification A No-Go\n\nThe notion of reunification with Romania, a longstanding idea that Kaplan writes is \"never really off the table,\" is also a nonstarter. Pursuing reunification, he says, could be seen by Russia as cause for war, particularly under the current circumstances.\n\n\"I do not see how Moldova and Romania can unify,\" Kaplan explains. \"That would be almost a casus belli for [President Vladimir] Putin's Russia.\"\n\nWhile some two-thirds of Moldova's population of 3.5 million speak Romanian, most of its present-day territory was alternately part of Romania and Russia or the Soviet Union.\n\nMoldova's eastern, mainly-Russian speaking Transdniester region separated violently from Chisinau in the early 1990s over fears that the ethnic Romanian majority would seek reunification with Romania.\n\nTransdniester remains a Russian bulwark against the European Union and NATO, reinforced by the presence of some 1,200 Russian troops. Stationed there since the Soviet era, the forces guard arms dumps and serve as \"peacekeepers\" separating Moldovans and Transdniestrians.\n\nBoth Chisinau and Bucharest have floated from time to time the idea of reunification as a possible shortcut for Moldova's accession into the West, while Russian speakers have been using the Romanian \"threat\" as justification for maintaining close ties to Moscow.\n\n\"Were Romania to annex Moldova or to unify with ethnic Romanian-speaking Moldova, that could lead Russia to formally annex Transdniester and that would create far greater regional tensions than we see now.\"\n\nCorruption Junction\n\nKaplan told RFE/RL that Moldova's \"incredibly high levels of corruption\" and the public's \"complete loss of confidence\" in the government is playing right into Russian President Putin's hands.\n\n\"Moldova is kind of being unwoven, it's kind of coming apart without Russia having to do all that much,\" Kaplan says.\n\n\"It wouldn't take much for Putin to undermine it,\" Kaplan adds. \"He probably already is doing so, because as I write, Russia has various age-old forms of imperialist tacticssubversion, intelligence operations, buying media through third parties, and on and on that are ambiguous enough to be deniable.\"\n\nKaplan said that the Westand the United States in particularhas to do more to help Moldova back onto the right track.\n\nKaplan recommended increased American military power in Central and Eastern Europe coupled with more robust diplomacy.\n\n\"The secretary of state, the president, the secretary of defensethey need to be seen to be paying more attention to Europe, because it's my contention that Europe is as important to the United States now as it was during the Cold War,\" Kaplan concludes.\n\nWatch the full video interview with Kaplan\n\nNew York Times\n\n10 February 2016\n\nby Kit Gillet\n\nBUCHAREST, RomaniaThe highest court in Romania upheld a 20-year prison term on Wednesday for a 90-year-old former warden from the countrys repressive Communist past who had overseen brutal treatment of prisoners, including routine beatings and starvation.\n\nThe former warden, Alexandru Visinescu, convicted last July of murder and crimes against humanity for the deaths of 12 inmates in the Ramnicu Sarat prison, was unrepentant at the trial. He had appealed the sentence to the High Court of Cassation and Justice.\n\nThe case, the first brought against an official of the former Communist government in almost 25 years, was widely regarded as a test of the countrys willingness to confront that period.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1963, Mr. Visinescu was the commander of Ramnicu Sarat, used to house many political prisoners and known for its harsh conditions.\n\nRomania was under Communist rule from 1947 until a bloody revolution in 1989, when the president, Nicolae Ceausescu, was toppled and summarily executed.\n\nThe prosecution of Mr. Visinescu, as well as a handful of impending cases against other former prison officers and guards, has led to a sense that Romania might at last be willing to punish those responsible for long-simmering injustices.\n\nThis is an important moment for post-Communist Romania, said Cosmin Budeanca, until recently the director general of the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and the Memory of the Romanian Exile, which was founded in 2005.\n\nNow we need to continue it. I hope in the next few months we will see more cases sent to the courts. For many people it is too late, but for the health of the nation I think this is an important moment, Mr. Budeanca said.\n\nMr. Visinescu, who has continued to receive his state pension, which has further angered many people, has been obstinate, denying the accusations and maintaining that he was simply adhering to orders. He was not present in court on Wednesday to hear the final verdict.\n\nIn 2012, Romania removed its statute of limitations for crimes against humanity, opening up the possibility of prosecuting those whose crimes dated back more than 40 years.\n\nThe charges against Mr. Visinescu were filed in September 2013, initially for the crime of genocide, with the trial beginning a year later.\n\nIt was unclear from the high courts decision whether Mr. Visinescu, who is increasingly frail, would be eligible for early release or whether he would continue to receive pension payments during his incarceration, which was to begin immediately.\n\nFor Communist-era victims and their descendants, however, the more important news was validation of the sentence.\n\nIt is a symbolic sentence. It is very little, and quite late, but it is still very important, and important for the new generation, said Anca Cernea, whose father spent 17 years behind bars as a political prisoner, including time at Ramnicu Sarat and who was in the courtroom on Wednesday.\n\nMy father and grandfather were there when Visinescu was in charge. He was one of the most brutal. I can remember his name being spoken of since my childhood, Ms. Cernea said.\n\nI am not sure he will spend much time in prison, but hopefully it gives him time to think through his actions, she said. During his trial he has never shown any sign of repentance, not even a gesture.\n\nNew York Times\n\n3 February 2016\n\nby Alison Smale\n\nSome 35 years ago, Robert D. Kaplan embarked on what this book portrays as an enduring love affair. The object of his affection and fascination is not a person, but a country: Romania. It is an obsession that has led him to plunge into the surrounding Balkans, and farther afield to contemplate Europe in all its historic complexity.\n\nWhen Kaplan arrived in Bucharest in the Cold War days of 1981, it was hardly an instant romance. He felt as if he had abandoned the sun and vibrant colors of Israel, and entered a black-and-white engraving in the shivery, November-hued Balkans.\n\nThe silence of the streets was devastating, he recalls in the opening pages of this haunting yet ultimately optimistic examination of the human condition as found in Romania. The city had been reduced to a vast echo. People stood in glum queues for not much; heat was scarce and fuel so precious that buses would soon run with methane tanks on top.\n\nWorse yet was the sight of massed thousands marching in a parade for their dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, or listening to him speak for three hours. The faces in the audience looked terrified throughout. Nobody dared stop clapping and chanting until he raised his arm.\n\nI remember that fear from reporting trips to Romania later in the 1980s. It was repulsive, hinting at the murderous cruelty of Ceausescu and his predecessor Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, whom Kaplan brands arguably two of the most ruthless men in the history of the second half of the 20th century. But it was also, especially in contrast to the much chronicled Middle East, part of an intriguing and largely untold story. Kaplan got hooked.\n\nAny reader going along for his 30-year ride should know that it is difficult to explore Romania in the linear, logical narrative familiar to the West. Steeped in his subject, the author delves into the ancient roots of Romanias culture and religion. He revels in what he calls a thrilling and atmospheric truth: Romania does, indeed, constitute a unique blend of a ­Latinate language and an Eastern Orthodox Church; the sound of Italy alongside the icons and frescoes of Greek Byzantium. Its Orthodox hymns are the most inspiring and evocative religious music I know, and the country itself a fusion of Roman Latinity and Greek Orthodox Christianity, so that ancient Rome and Greece live on, however vaguely and indirectly, inside the Romanian soul.\n\nKaplans account of the centuries leading up to the most turbulent of allthe 20this both sweeping and replete with alluring detail (my favorite: that Cyrillic script was used in Romania until the 19th century, when it began to die out, partly because czarist officers arriving from Russia encouraged Romanians to imitate them and speak French, not Greek, as their second language).\n\nWhile Kaplans meticulous care for his subject is plain, even he cannot fully penetrate or resolve the vagueness and contradiction of Romanian history. The Battle of Rovine, in May 1395, was a crucial (and rare) victory over the Turks. Yet, in setting out for the supposed site of this battle, Kaplan fails to find it with surety, and in fact has been told by a local historian that such sites are often obscure.\n\nIn Europes Shadow is loosely constructed around Kaplans trips to Romania in 1981 (he was barred from Romania after writing in 1984 of Ceausescus destruction of old central Bucharest), 1990 and 2013. A visit that also takes him to the former Soviet republic of Moldova and into Transnistria is added in 2014, after Russia under Vladimir Putin has upended post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe with his annexation of Crimea and actions in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe dates allow Kaplan to trace the arc from brutal Communism to immediate post-revolutionto see an entire ­population struggling to recover their self-respect as individualsto the near present, when Romania has joined NATO and the European Union, and even its provincial towns, like Sighisoara in Transylvania, are teeming with tourists. Spotting a sumptuous interior in Sighisoara, ­Kap­lan writes, Few things scream money and elegance like soft yellow lighting.\n\nHe treasures his memories of the 1981 visit to the Balkans that changed his life, giving it a direction that would never really alter afterward, and is ­disappointed to find that, in 2013, his observations no longer have the same powerful effect. Bucharest was now a mishmash, he writes, admitting that this was its salvation and its humanity. It had not yet been overrun again by another utopian ideology or grand scheme. The city merely existed from day to day, adding dissimilar elements, while the politics of the capital were emblemized by petty, low-level ­intrigue and chaos. There was nothing archetypal about it anymore, thankfully.\n\nAs he notes when he arrives back in Romania from far poorer, more precarious Moldova in 2014, one could practically want to kiss the ground that the last two decades or so have been among the most benign in Romanian ­history. Even the worried people he encounters after Putin has overturned the post-1989 paradigm do not talk violence or revenge. Instead, Kaplan recounts, they fret over maps and routes of ­energy ­pipelines that may or may not solidify Russias grip on the region and implore him to make sure the West (and specifically Americans) takes care of Romania in the 21st centuryas it failed, in their view, to do for much of the 20th.\n\nPerhaps because of his publishing deadline, Kaplan gives little space to exploring the significance of Romanias surprising 2014 election. In a country long wedded to a rigid nationalism, Klaus Iohannis, the ethnic German mayor of the Transylvanian city of Sibiu, became the first non-ethnic-Romanian president, campaigning on a message of reform, fighting corruption and aligning with the West against Putin. Another curious omission, in this capturing of history near and distant, is discussion of the 2008 NATO summit in ­Bucharest, at which Germany opposed the American pushnow seen as prescient by some, in the light of Ukraine in 2014to hold out membership for Georgia and Ukraine.\n\nBut omissions and unevenness come with the territory, as it were, and are compensated for by the rich characters who wander through these pages, particularly the nonagenarian historians and other intellectuals, officials and churchmen who dispense wisdom from book-lined homes, cafes, or chapels old and new.\n\nOver an espresso at the old home of Ceausescus wastrel son Nicu, a friend of Kaplans opines that Romanias geography is still a nightmare. Perhaps because of his long years in the Balkans and the Middle East, Kap­lan is hyperconscious of the role of geography in history. (His many books include ­Balkan Ghosts and The Revenge of Geography.) His friends remark leads him to muse on how Romania joined the European Union (in 2007) just as the union fell into crisis: a mountain of debt spiraling out of control that put the future of the welfare statethe political and moral response to centuries of war and suffering on the Continentin doubt. He shares the spreading view that this has led to many different Europesthe states within the eurozone and the Schengen ­borderless-travel agreement; those outside; and the ones outside the union entirelyinstead of one Europe into whose bosom Romania could escape history.\n\nEurope seems, indeed, to be at a crossroad, and Kaplans Romania offers lessons on the value of malleability, and what ­endures.\n\nFather Dosoftei, a breathless monk at Putna on the Ukraine border, a monastery housing the tomb of the medieval ruler Stephen the Great, knows what lasts. The Communists destroyed the landscape, but deep down they destroyed nothing, the monk tells Kaplan. It is only a matter of recovering the tradition. Tradition and modernity cannot exist one without the other. You can only build from the past.\n\nIN EUROPES SHADOW\n\nTwo Cold Wars and a Thirty-Year Journey Through Romania and Beyond\n\nBy Robert D.

She led the Associated Press coverage of Central Europe and the Balkans from 1986 to 1998.\n\nNational Public Radio\n\n26 January 2016\n\nListen to the story at the article website\n\nNPR's Audie Cornish talks to Romanian journalist Ovidiu Vanghele about Romanian prisoners publishing scientific papers to reduce prison sentences.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nFor decades, Romania has given its prisoners a way to reduce their time behind bars. Publish a scientific book - get 30 days off your sentence. Now, this is a law that goes back to the communist era for prisoners who weren't suitable for manual labor. And last year, there was a sharp increase in publications by wealthy and well-connected inmates. The AP says from a handful of books in previous years to suddenly hundreds in 2015. Ovidiu Vanghele is a Romanian journalist. He joins us now from Bucharest. Welcome.\n\nOVIDIU VANGHELE: Thanks for having me.\n\nCORNISH: So there's an investigation into alleged abuse of this law. What prompted that investigation?\n\nVANGHELE: As you said, there's been a huge rise in the number of books written in prison. And this is a tool that only - I don't know - the VIP inmates use basically. These last - I don't know - two or three years there's been a huge rise in the number of books they pretend to write in prison. And I say pretend because factually you cannot write so many books in that small amount of time, and you cannot write books in Romanian prisons because you don't have access to knowledge resources. You are not allowed to have access to Internet, so you cannot use any online resources.\n\nStill, you are allowed to ask for one book or another book to be brought to you by your lawyer or by your family when they come and visit you. But, you know, if you only use written material, it would be impossible to consult and to summarize so many things in such a short amount of time and be able to still write a notable scientific work.\n\nCORNISH: Help us understand how these prisoners, especially these VIP prisoners, are getting these books written if people don't believe that they're writing them.\n\nVANGHELE: This is a thing that I hope the prosecutors will shed light on. We don't know how these books - if they are being brought to jail, being smuggled to those prisoners or not. The penitentiary system in Romania is quite closed.\n\nCORNISH: Right now we've been reading that the speculation is that prisoners are using ghost writers. People are somehow smuggling in handwritten manuscripts, right, because they have to be presented as handwritten.\n\nVANGHELE: The law is not really clear on this matter either. That's a big problem also because we don't know if they areI don't know if they bring them, like, a Word document on a stick, on a memory stick, or if they are being presented as a manuscript.\n\nCORNISH: We mentioned that this is a law that dates back to the communist era. Is there any talk of changing it today?\n\nVANGHELE: Yeah, there's been a huge investigation by the newly appointed justice minister in Romania. And their intention is to abolish the law. But in my opinion, the problem is not the law itself. The problem is the way you implement the law, the conditions and the requirements for a book to be considered a scientific work. There's been, like, you know, kindergarten books. That's the intellectual level of the books that are being presented as scientific works and are being used as to get out of jail early. That's the problem.\n\nCORNISH: This increase in book publications, it's primarily wealthy and well-connected inmates. Does this specific fight say anything to us about kind of Romania's struggle to deal with corruption?\n\nVANGHELE: Yes. You know, we had a lot of important persons convicted throughout the last several years. And this is not a coincidence that the penitentiary literature phenomenon exploded throughout the last years also. So this is, like, more or less a consequence of the war on corruption.\n\nCORNISH: Ovidiu Vanghele is an editor at the online newspaper EurActiv. He spoke with us from Bucharest, Romania. Thank you so much for speaking with us.\n\nVANGHELE: Thanks for having me\n\nNew York Times\n\n25 January 2016\n\nby The Associated Press\n\nBUCHAREST, RomaniaRomania's crackdown on corruption and fraud in recent years has created a sudden and unexpected literary boom, as prisoners publish hundreds of non-fiction books on subjects as varied as soccer, real estate, God and gemstones.\n\nIt's quite a feat for inmates with no access to books or the Internet, often without tables in their cells. Reports that one book, of 212 pages, was written in seven hours, has only increased suspicions that the improbable treatises are often ghost-written or plagiarized.\n\nUnder Romanian law, prisoners can have their sentences reduced by 30 days for every \"scientific work\" they publish, subject to a judge's decision on whether the book merits it. Prisoners pay publishing houses to print their worksthough they won't be found in any bookshop.\n\nThe law dates from the communist era and was aimed at imprisoned intellectuals who were not suitable for manual labor.

He also insists he wrote his own books.\n\nBut it's hardly surprising that in such difficult conditionsprisoners rely on family and friends to photocopy pages from reference books and don't have desks in their cellsand with most convicts first-time authors, there are suspicions some prisoners simply hired others to write for them.\n\nSteaua football club owner Gigi Becali recently admitted that he didn't write the four books that came out under his name on subjects ranging from Mount Athos to \"merciful love and redemption.\" The former European Parliament lawmaker was sentenced to 3½ years prison in May 2013 for a land exchange deal, kidnapping and match fixing.

Now that it's on U.S. screens, there's an even closer analogy: Aferim! is Romania's The Hateful Eight.\n\nBoth movies are revisionist Westerns, with verbosely profane dialogue and stories shadowed by racism and slavery. Yet there are two notable differences: Aferim! was shot in crystalline black-and-white, and is more sparing in its depiction of violence. Its brutal payoff transpires off-camera, and involves just one victim. Among the most savage events actually shown is a Punch and Judy-style puppet show, a comment on violence that demonstrates director and co-writer Radu Jude's subtlety and empathy.\n\nThe story opens with a widescreen shot of mountainsnot the Rockies, but still fairly rugged. We hear voices first, as a man describes a cholera outbreak whose ravages convey the harshness of life in Wallachia, southern Romania, in 1835. Then two men on horseback ride into view, across the broad vista, and out the other side.\n\nThis is a Romanian film, so the camera doesn't move, and there are no edits or zoom-ins. Later, Jude will become a little more familiar with his characters, but close-ups are not to his taste. The audience is kept at a distance, its view sometimes blocked by trees, animals, or crowds of ragtag people.\n\nThe garrulous man on horseback is Costandin (Teodor Corban), a constable currently serving as a bounty hunter. The teenager with him, too gawky and green for his uniform and sword, turns out to be Costandin's son, Ionita (Mihai Comanoiu). The men are in pursuit of a runaway gypsy slave, Carfin (Cuzin Toma, star of another current Romanian film, The Treasure). When they find him, Carfin also has plenty to say.\n\nSlavery was abolished in Romania just a few years before the Emancipation Proclamation, and the gypsies seen in Aferim! have roughly the same status as slaves in the antebellum American South. They're even called \"crows,\" and their plight justified because they're supposedly descendants of Ham, cursed by God to be black. (The movie ends with a list of historical sources for its fascinating depiction of 19th-century Romanian customs, behavior, and attitudes.)\n\n1830s Wallachia is a multicultural land, and not happy about it. It's part of the Ottoman empire\"Aferim\" is the Ottoman-Turkish equivalent of \"bravo\"yet increasingly dominated by Russia. When Costandin and Ionita help a priest with a broken cart, he impugns the characters of many nationalities in a series of one-liners. The constable asks if gypsies are human. Yes, the cleric replies, but Jews are not.\n\nAlthough set in a different milieu than any other recent import from the Romanian cinema, Aferim! has familiar aspects. Like many films set in contemporary Bucharest, this is a story of self-styled potentates, small-time graft, and inevitable disappointment.\n\nIncorrigibly vulgar and habitually insulting to women and gypsies, Costandin seems monstrous at first. But he's less a bully than a traveling-salesman type, with well-worn patter in continual flow. The constable has a joke or a curse for every occasion, notably as he rides away from an encounter with a Turkish aristocrat: \"May he live three more days, including yesterday.\"\n\nCostandin is boorish and bellicose, yet not without compassion. While he shares his compatriots' prejudices against gypsies, he still entreats the lord who hired him to show some mercy. But he's asking the wrong man, in the wrong era, in the wrong country.\n\nNew York Times\n\n21 January 2016\n\nby A. O. Scott\n\nDo you need another reason to be mad about the Oscar nominations? Well heres one, expressed as tradition demands in the form of a hashtag: #WhataboutAferim! Aferim!the title translates more or less as Attaboy!is Radu Judes sublime new feature, a funny and brutal costume drama with a potent contemporary kick. Officially submitted for consideration as Romanias official entry in the best foreign-language film sweepstakes, it was omitted from the final list of five nominees.\n\nA shocking slight, but maybe not all that surprising. Romania, a small country on the fringe of Europe, has a long history of being trampled, disrespected and ignored by the worlds great powers. Why should Hollywood be an exception? Marginality is part of the national identity and very much a theme in the recent flowering of Romanian cinema. Persistent unluckiness, low self-esteem and compensatory pomposity define the comic universe of The Treasure, Corneliu Porumboius most recent film, for instance.\n\nThat movie, which opened in New York a few weeks ago, might be described as a perverse folk tale set in the present day. Its dry, wry minimalism will be familiar to devotees of the Romanian New Wave. Mr. Jude, while he shares with his contemporaries an unsentimental interest in human folly and failure, departs from the naturalism that has been their collective signature for the last decade. Shot in richly toned, wide-screen black and white, Aferim! looks like an elegant exercise in period playacting. But it casts a fierce, revisionist eye on the past, finding the cruelty and prejudice that lie beneath the pageantry.\n\nIts 1835, in the principality of Walachia, a northern region of what is not yet Romania that resembles the territory of a classic western. A lawman named Constandin (Teodor Corban) and his deputy, Ionita (Mihai Comanoiu)who is also his sonride through broad mountain valleys and sun-dappled forests on horseback, looking for a fugitive. They travel through what feels very much like a half-civilized stretch of frontier, encountering a motley collection of bandits, farmers, stagecoach drivers and talkative oddballs. One of these is a priest whose godly wisdom consists of a hair-raising litany of ethnic and religious hatreds. Gypsies, he says, are technically human, though as descendants of Ham they are cursed with servitude and backwardness. Dont get him started on Jews.\n\nSqueezed between the Russian and the Ottoman Empires, this part of the world is a semi-feudal patchwork of villages, monasteries and estates. Danger is everywhere, and what government exists seems to rest on the principle of might makes right. Power and wealth are concentrated in the hands of aristocratic boyars. One of them has dispatched Constandin and Ionita to capture an enslaved Gypsy who has run away after sleeping with the boyars wife.\n\nConstandin is a gruff, good-humored fellow, who walks with a limp and swaggers toward trouble with the confidence of someone accustomed to winning fights. He can be menacing when his job and circumstances call for it, but he isnt malicious, and he treats Ionita with tough paternal tenderness. He clearly regards himself as a good father and a fair-minded guardian of law and order, proud of his title (Constable) and aware of the responsibility it confers.\n\nBut he is also the paid enforcer of a system of racist domination and economic exploitation that is breathtaking in its brutality. Without undue didacticismbut also without euphemism or antiquarian excuse-makingMr. Jude, drawing in part from contemporary records and writings, exposes how deeply the oppression of the Roma was woven into the 19th-century Balkan social order. Gypsies are routinely referred to as darkies or crows. (They address Constandin and his employer as bright lord.) They can be bought, sold, beaten, killed or mutilated according to the whims of anyone in authority. When Constandin and Ionita find Carfin (Cuzin Toma), the slave theyre looking for, they shackle his feet and throw him across the front of Constandins saddle.\n\nThe systematic destruction of human dignity is painful to witness, but in Aferim! its just a fact of life. Mr. Jude has no interest in preaching, or in flattering modern audiences by re-enacting the bygone horrors of the old days. Anti-Roma bigotry and extreme inequality have hardly vanished from Romania, and the political implications of the story ripple far beyond that countrys borders.\n\nBut there is nothing grim or scolding about this movie. Quite the opposite: It is raucous, funny and full of life. Nor does the collision of moral horror and profane humor seem in any way forced, as it might in, lets say, a Quentin Tarantino movie. Constandin, an inexhaustible talker, overflowing with corny wisdom, snippets of poetry and philosophical musings, resembles one of Mr. Tarantinos garrulous bounty hunters. He also seems entirely at home in his milieu, even as he is troubled from time to time by stirrings of compassion or remorse.\n\nMr. Corban, who may be familiar to fans of Romanian film from his work in Mr. Porumboius 12:08 East of Bucharest and Cristian Mungius 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, gives an exuberantly soulful performance. He has some of Anthony Quinns rough charisma, and a touch of the loose, wised-up humor that John Wayne brought to his later westerns.\n\nIn another kind of filmmaybe the kind more in tune with Oscar-time magical thinkingConstandin might be a hero, a man of conscience awakened by the injustice in which hes implicated. But Mr. Jude loves humanity too much to tell comforting lies about it. His pessimism is somehow the opposite of despair, and while the ringing affirmation of his films title is obviously sarcastic, Aferim! is neither mocking nor mean. As a species, were pretty awful, but we can also be a lot of fun, and even sometimes decent, compassionate and wise. How can we live with ourselves? The answer, this brilliant movie suggests, is that we cant but somehow we do.\n\nAferim! is not rated. It is in Romanian, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes.\n\nNational Public Radio\n\n7 January 2016\n\nby Mark Jenkins\n\nOne day, late to pick up his 6-year-old from school, a low-level Bucharest civil servant attempts to distract the boy with a reference to their mutual hero, Robin Hood. \"You're not Robin Hood,\" the kid (Nicodim Toma) tells his dad, Costi (Cuzin Toma).\n\nIs that a dare? Maybe not to Costi, but certainly to writer-director Corneliu Porumboiu. He spins The Treasure into an adventure tale, albeit one that's short on adventure. This charmer is determinedly mundane and low-key, until an unexpected finale transforms it.\n\nThe bulk of the movie takes place in a country easily recognized by followers of the Romanian new wave, whose most celebrated films include Porumboiu's own Police, Adjective. It's a land of paltry dreams, and bureaucrats who exist to thwart even them. It's also a nation where everyone seems to have one foot planted in the past, and the travails of Communism feel more vivid than anything that's happened since Nicolae Ceausescu's 1989 fall.\n\nThat evening, Costi is reading to his son about Robin Hood when a neighbor arrives. Adrian (Adrian Purcarescu) is unemployed and burdened by a mortgage he can't pay. He asks to borrow money, which Costi says he doesn't have. Then Adrian makes a counteroffer: He and Costi can split his family's buried treasure 50-50, if Costi pays to rent a metal detector. The alleged riches were hidden just before the Communists took power, and Adrian has no evidence that they actually exist.\n\nThis is not the most compelling of propositions, but Costi accepts it.\n\nIt will eventually lead to a sequence of deadpan slapstick, as the two men and a metal-detector operator (Corneliu Cozmei) survey the dirt at a rural garden owned by Adrian's family. The detector whines at every scrap of metal, each bleat a potential frustrationbut also a possible bonanza.\n\nEveryone notes that the property is near Islaz, where in 1848 a sort of Romanian Magna Carta was proclaimed. Stick a shovel into the country's dirt, and it's likely to hit politics.\n\nExcept for Toma, the principal cast members are nonprofessionals who were chosen for actual connections to the story: Cozmei is a genuine metal-detector operator, and Purcarescu really did dig for an ancestor's buried loot. The movie is unsweetened by music until its final moment, which makes a brief but electric stylistic leap.\n\nThe pace is deliberate, often real-time, and the individual shots long, simulating everyday life both for its own sake and as a contrast to the final twist (or two). Like his fellow Romanian directors, Porumboiu is no hurry to get to the climax, anticlimactic as it may be.\n\nFirst, Costi must negotiate a labyrinth of regulations, as well as the separate rules that govern clandestine commerce. Sometimes, he learns, it's easier to lieeven when the truth is less strange than the fiction. Romania may no longer be a dictatorship, but every boss, clerk, and police officer is a little tyrant.\n\nOne likely outcome would be that the two men will indeed unearth a fortune, only to have it confiscated by the government as part of the country's patrimony. (They've been warned about that possibility.) But then there are so many ways The Treasure could end in disappointment for Costi and Adrian.\n\nYet perhaps the men will experience some movie magic. And The Treasure will have as much to do with Robin Hood as with the Romanian national character.\n\nNew York Times\n\n7 January 2016\n\nby Eve M. Kahn\n\nWhen Communist regimes in Europe were unraveling in 1989, collaborators and dissidents alike began destroying vital historical material, from statues of dictators to family snapshots of government informers to manuals that exaggerated the quality of East German car engines. Now relics of ordinary life and heinous acts in the Soviet bloc are resurfacing in museums, publications and auctions.\n\nRecent books have delved into East German propaganda posters and Stalinist architecture as well as apartment life, bus-stop design, childrens books and store-window aesthetics in the Eastern bloc. Current exhibitions explore early Soviet photography and film (the Jewish Museum in New York); Soviet industrial design (the Kunsthal in Rotterdam, the Netherlands); cosmonauts (the Science Museum in London); prison camps (the Gulag History Museum in Moscow); and Cuban schoolbooks from the 1960s, based on Soviet models (HistoryMiami in Florida).\n\nIn Culver City, Calif., the Wende Museum, which focuses on Cold War artifacts from Eastern Europe, is setting up galleries, labs and storage space inside a former armory built in 1949. A vast range of products made within the Soviet bloc are to be displayed, as well as documentation of the period when many Americans lived in dread of potential nuclear attacks.\n\nJustinian A. Jampol, the founder and executive director of the Wende Museum, said the armory still has its Cold War fallout shelters, which will remain visible to the public. The ethos of the project is to prioritize transparency, he said.\n\nEast German memorabilia in the Wende collection is the subject of a 904-page study, Beyond the Wall: Art and Artifacts From the GDR (Taschen). Among the 2,500 objects it illustrates are packaged soap, album covers, typewriters, maps, clocks, lingerie, tapestries and sports equipment, with recurring images of eager factory workers and bountiful collective farms. There are military uniforms, grenades, warning signs from border crossings, recording devices used by spies and books portraying Americans as violent racists.\n\nDr. Jampol describes the widespread attempts in Central and Eastern Europe to discard Communist records and objects in 1989 and thereafter as part of a typical Müllphase, or trash phase in German. Such bursts of iconoclasm have recurred for millenniums, from the methodical smashing of ancient sculptures and monuments by Byzantine Christians to the destruction of Roman Catholic imagery during the Protestant Reformation in Northern Europe.\n\nFor coming exhibitions in the Culver City armory, the Wende is collaborating with the Getty Research Institute in studying how Hungarian artists, photographers, designers and manufacturers adapted to Communist restrictions. The museum is also working with the Wellcome Trust in London on a show, War of Nerves: The Psychological Landscape of the Cold War, about how political leaders persuaded citizens to inform on one another.\n\nThe Wendes collection has expanded partly through purchases of archival material from governments. In 2010, for example, Hungarian officials auctioned off hundreds of pieces of propaganda; a showroom wall at the sale preview was devoted to nearly identical framed portraits of Lenin.\n\nThe Wende Museum has also received gifts from Communist perpetrators of injustice and from victims who acquired mementos as a form of therapy, Dr. Jampol said, adding, A lot of these artifacts are fraught. He said that he wanted to encourage the preservation of all objects in the field, even those considered painful or embarrassing or that evoked the most sadistic figures or most violent upheavals.\n\nIf the evidence were lost, he said, that would be the biggest tragedy of all.\n\nLast year a variety of Communist-era material came up at specialty auctions in Europe and the United States. J. James Auctioneers & Appraisers in Plymouth, Mass., offered around 100 Russian posters, and pieces of Soviet porcelain were dispersed through Lempertz auction house in Berlin. The Romanian auction house Artmark organized a sale of art and memorabilia from the era, including clothing and tableware that belonged to the family of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was toppled and killed in Romania in 1989. At a Bonhams sale in New York titled Conflicts of the 20th Century, the lots included two metal signs that were posted at the Berlin Wall. (The pair sold for $2,000.)\n\nOn Wednesday, hundreds of items related to the Soviet space program came up for sale at a RegencySuperior auction in St. Louis. A 1960s lamp that sold for about $200 is in the form of a silver rocket spewing red exhaust; little plaques encircling the base depict Lenin and symbols of Soviet pride (farmers, happy factory workers, electricity, ships). The catalog called the knickknack a fantastic piece of propaganda.\n\nNewly unearthed material is inspiring still more shows and publications. In Berlin, an exhibition of moldering Cold War installations in Europe will open in March at the German Historical Museum, and an excavated chunk of a long-buried Lenin statue will go on view in April at the Spandau Citadel. In June Rutgers University Press will release Drawing the Iron Curtain: Jews and the Golden Age of Soviet Animation, by the art historian Maya Balakirsky Katz. Twin Cities Public Television in St. Paul is at work on a documentary about Stalin.\n\nCatherine Allan, executive producer of the Stalin film, said that source materials uncovered so far include secret diaries with entries criticizing Communist leaders, footage from Stalins home movies, crude portraits that Politburo committee members doodled of one another and ghostly evidence of political purges.\n\nIn many of the archival photos that have surfaced, she said, there are faces that have been completely penciled or inked over.\n\nNew York Times\n\n7 January 2016\n\nby A. O. Scott\n\nCosti, the Romanian Everyman at the center of The Treasure, leads a reasonably comfortable if not terribly exciting life. Played by Cuzin Toma, an actor with a melancholy, sensitive face and a gentle manner, Costi has an office job and a tidy, somewhat sterile apartment, where he lives with his wife, Raluca, and their young son, Alin (played by Mr. Tomas real-life wife and son, Cristina and Nicodim). The boy likes to hear fairy tales at bedtime, and his father soon finds himself on an adventure that has all the markings of a modern fable.\n\nNot that the films director, Corneliu Porumboiu, has much interest in showy magic or pat moral lessons. His filmsThe Treasure is his fourth featuretake place in the thoroughly disenchanted world of post-Communist Romania, and the attention he pays to that world is measured and meticulous. He favors extended takes, medium- to long-range shots and minimal camera movements. Rather than forcing anything to happen, he is content to wait until dramatic events emerge from the quirks and puzzles of human behavior.\n\nIn his debut, 12:08 East of Bucharest (2007), a prizewinner at Cannes and one of the essential European films of the past decade, Mr. Porumboiu observed the interactions of a highly undistinguished panel on a provincial television broadcast commemorating the revolution that overthrew the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. That film is at once a brutal deadpan comedy and a devastating anatomy of the ambiguous legacy of the Eastern European revolutions of 1989. Mr. Porumboius next effort, Police, Adjective (2009), exhibited a similar doubleness, offering both a dry satire of bureaucratic working conditions and a furious critique of the petty authoritarianism that has persisted in Romania long after the disappearance of Communism.\n\nThe Treasure is like the work of Samuel Becketts long-lost Balkan cousinbleak, stoic and suffused with a flinty, exasperated empathy for its ridiculous characters. Its also a subtle, almost stealthy X-ray of the European soul in a time of persistent economic troublea more effective and cleareyed reckoning with the present crisis on the continent than, say, Miguel Gomess sprawling, intellectually confused Arabian Nights.\n\nMost immediately, though, The Treasure is an absurdist anecdote, a modest story that has the feel of an urban legend. One evening, Costi is visited by one of his neighbors, a jumpy, dour fellow named Adrian, who has a business proposition that sounds like either a plea or a threat. Adrian (played by Adrian Purcarescu, a friend and colleague of Mr. Porumboius) is desperate for money and claims to have a surefire way to get hold of some. He believes there is treasure buried under a tree on a country estate that belongs to his family. If Costi can pay to rent the equipment that can locate the loot, Adrian will give him a cut. What could go wrong?\n\nWell, for one thing, there might not be any treasure. For another, the property might not really belong to Adrian, wh"
