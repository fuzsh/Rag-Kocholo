        "text": "Increase of plasma renin activity in male and female rabbits subjected to dysbaric conditions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChryssanthou, C.; Kircikoglu, H.; Strugar, J.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may be implicated in hemodynamic alterations occurring in dysbaric disorders. This report concerns changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) induced by exposure of rabbits to a compression-decompression schedule that does not normally produce clinical manifestations of decompression sickness. The results revealed a significant increase in PRA in 19 of 23 animals following dysbaric exposure. Mean PRA rose from 1.18 ng ang I/ml hr (preexposure) to 2.40 ng ang I/ml hr (postexposure). The increase was particularly pronounced in female animals (217 percent). Asymptomatic intravascular gas bubbles (silent bubbles) were detected by gross or microscopic examination in the majority of the animals. Renin elaboration and secretion in asymptomatic dysbaric exposures may be mediated by bradykinin and/or prostaglandins released or activated in a chain reaction triggered by silent gas bubbles. This hypothesis is also applicable to increased PRA in altitude decompression. Alternatively elevation of PRA may result from decreased renal perfusion when dysbaric disorders are complicated by significant hypovolemia.\n\nDistribution of renin activity and angiotensinogen in rat brain. Effects of dietary sodium chloride intake on brain renin.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGenain, C P; Van Loon, G R; Kotchen, T A\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the biochemistry and the regulation of the brain renin-angiotensin system in the Sprague-Dawley rat. Renin activity and angiotensinogen concentrations (direct and indirect radioimmunoassays) were measured in several brain areas and in neuroendocrine glands. Regional renin activities were measured in separate groups of rats on high and low NaCl diets. Mean tissue renin activities ranged from 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 54.4 +/- 19.7 fmol/mg protein per h (mean of 7 +/- SD), with the highest amounts in pineal, pituitary, and pons-medulla. NaCl depletion increased renin activity in selected regions; based on estimates of residual plasma contamination (despite perfusion of brains with saline), increased renin activity of pineal gland and posterior pituitary was attributed to higher plasma renin. To eliminate contamination by plasma renin, 16-h-nephrectomized rats were also studied. In anephric rats, NaCl depletion increased renin activity by 92% in olfactory bulbs and by 97% in anterior pituitary compared with NaCl-replete state. These elevations could not be accounted for by hyperreninemia. Brain renin activity was low and was unaffected by dietary NaCl in amygdala, hypothalamus, striatum, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. In contrast to renin, highest angiotensinogen concentrations were measured in hypothalamus and cerebellum. Overall, angiotensinogen measurements with the direct and the indirect assays were highly correlated (n = 56, r = 0.96, P less than 0.001). We conclude that (a) NaCl deprivation increases renin in olfactory bulbs and anterior pituitary of the rat, unrelated to contamination by plasma renin; and (b) the existence of angiotensinogen, the precursor of angiotensins, is demonstrated by direct radioimmunoassay throughout the brain and in neuroendocrine glands.

Previous data suggest VDR agonists may actually increase renin-angiotensin activity, and this has always been assumed to be mediated by hypercalcemia. We hypothesized that calcitriol and paricalcitol would increase plasma renin activity (PRA) independently of plasma Ca2+ via hypercalciuria-mediated polyuria, hypovolemia, and subsequent increased Î²-adrenergic sympathetic activity. We found that both calcitriol and paricalcitol increased PRA threefold (P < 0.01). Calcitriol caused hypercalcemia, but paricalcitol did not. Both calcitriol and paricalcitol caused hypercalciuria (9- and 7-fold vs. control, P < 0.01) and polyuria (increasing 2.6- and 2.2-fold vs. control, P < 0.01). Paricalcitol increased renal calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) expression, suggesting a potential cause of paricalcitol-mediated hypercalciuria and polyuria. Volume replacement completely normalized calcitriol-stimulated PRA and lowered plasma epinephrine by 43% (P < 0.05). Î²-Adrenergic blockade also normalized calcitriol-stimulated PRA. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition had no effect on calcitriol-stimulated PRA. Our data demonstrate that vitamin D increases PRA independently of plasma Ca2+ via hypercalciuria, polyuria, hypovolemia, and increased Î²-adrenergic activity.

We measured urinary and plasma renin, prorenin, angiotensinogen, aldosterone, albumin and creatinine in 101 diabetic and nondiabetic patients with or without hypertension. Plasma prorenin was elevated in diabetic patients. Urinary prorenin was undetectable. Urinary albumin and renin were higher in diabetic patients. Men had higher plasma renin/prorenin levels, and lower plasma angiotensinogen levels than women. Plasma creatinine and albumin were also higher in men. Urinary RAAS components showed no sexual dimorphism, whereas urinary creatinine and albumin were higher in men. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers increased plasma renin and decreased plasma angiotensinogen, without altering plasma aldosterone. In contrast, in urine, these drugs decreased renin and aldosterone without affecting angiotensinogen. When analyzing all patients together, urinary angiotensinogen excretion closely mimicked that of albumin, whereas urinary angiotensinogen and albumin levels both were 0.05% or less of their concomitant plasma levels. This may reflect the identical glomerular filtration and tubular handling of both proteins, which have a comparable molecular weight. In contrast, urinary renin excretion did not correlate with urinary albumin excretion, and the urinary/plasma concentration ratio of renin was more than 200 times the ratio of albumin, despite its comparable molecular weight. Urinary aldosterone excretion closely followed urinary creatinine excretion. The increased urinary renin levels in diabetes and the decreased urinary renin levels following RAAS blockade, occurring independently of changes in plasma renin, reflect the activated renal RAAS in diabetes and the success of RAAS blockade in the kidney, respectively. Urinary renin, therefore, more closely reflects renal RAAS activity than urinary angiotensinogen or\n\nInfluence of low and high pressure baroreceptors on plasma renin activity in humans\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMark, A. L.; Abboud, F. M.; Fitz, A. E.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nThe effects of low and high pressure baroreceptors on plasma renin activity (immunoassay) were evaluated using graded lower body suction (LBS) in six healthy men. LBS at -10 and -20 mmHg for 10 min decreased central venous pressure without changing arterial pressure and thereby presumably reduced low but not high pressure baroreceptor inhibition of renin release. LBS at these levels produced forearm vasoconstriction, but did not increase renin. LBS at -40 mmHG decreased central venous and arterial pulse pressure and thus reduced both low and high pressure baroreceptor inhibition. LBS at this level produced forearm vasoconstriction and tachycardia and increased renin. In summary, reduction in low pressure baroreceptor inhibition in humans did not increase renin in the presence of physiological tonic inhibition from high pressure baroreceptors. Increases in renin did not occur until there was combined reduction of high and low pressure baroreceptor inhibition on plasma renin activity.\n\nHigh phosphate diet increases arterial blood pressure via a parathyroid hormone mediated increase of renin.\n\nPubMed\n\nBozic, Milica; Panizo, Sara; Sevilla, Maria A; Riera, Marta; Soler, Maria J; Pascual, Julio; Lopez, Ignacio; Freixenet, Montserrat; Fernandez, Elvira; Valdivielso, Jose M\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThere is growing evidence suggesting that phosphate intake is associated with blood pressure levels. However, data from epidemiological studies show inconsistent results. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of high circulating phosphorus on arterial blood pressure of healthy rats and to elucidate the potential mechanism that stands behind this effect. Animals fed a high phosphate diet for 4 weeks showed an increase in blood pressure, which returned to normal values after the addition of a phosphate binder (lanthanum carbonate) to the diet. The expression of renin in the kidney was higher, alongside an increase in plasma renin activity, angiotensin II (Ang II) levels and left ventricular hypertrophy. The addition of the phosphate binder blunted the increase in renin and Ang II levels. The levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) were also higher in animals fed a high phosphate diet, and decreased when the phosphate binder was present in the diet. However, blood P levels remained elevated. A second group of rats underwent parathyroidectomy and received a continuous infusion of physiological levels of PTH through an implanted mini-osmotic pump. Animals fed a high phosphate diet with continuous infusion of PTH did not show an increase in blood pressure, although blood P levels were elevated. Finally, unlike with verapamil, the addition of losartan to the drinking water reverted the increase in blood pressure in rats fed a high phosphate diet. The results of this study suggest that a high phosphate diet increases arterial blood pressure through an increase in renin mediated by PTH.\n\nActivation of the Endogenous Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System or Aldosterone Administration Increases Urinary Exosomal Sodium Channel Excretion.\n\nPubMed\n\nQi, Ying; Wang, Xiaojing; Rose, Kristie L; MacDonald, W Hayes; Zhang, Bing; Schey, Kevin L; Luther, James M\n\n2016-02-01\n\nUrinary exosomes secreted by multiple cell types in the kidney may participate in intercellular signaling and provide an enriched source of kidney-specific proteins for biomarker discovery. Factors that alter the exosomal protein content remain unknown. To determine whether endogenous and exogenous hormones modify urinary exosomal protein content, we analyzed samples from 14 mildly hypertensive patients in a crossover study during a high-sodium (HS, 160 mmol/d) diet and low-sodium (LS, 20 mmol/d) diet to activate the endogenous renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. We further analyzed selected exosomal protein content in a separate cohort of healthy persons receiving intravenous aldosterone (0.7 Î¼g/kg per hour for 10 hours) versus vehicle infusion. The LS diet increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, whereas aldosterone infusion increased only aldosterone concentration. Protein analysis of paired urine exosome samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based multidimensional protein identification technology detected 2775 unique proteins, of which 316 exhibited significantly altered abundance during LS diet. Sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) and Î±- and Î³-epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits from the discovery set were verified using targeted multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry quantified with isotope-labeled peptide standards. Dietary sodium restriction or acute aldosterone infusion similarly increased urine exosomal Î³ENaC[112-122] peptide concentrations nearly 20-fold, which correlated with plasma aldosterone concentration and urinary Na/K ratio. Urine exosomal NCC and Î±ENaC concentrations were relatively unchanged during these interventions. We conclude that urinary exosome content is altered by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation. Urinary measurement of exosomal Î³ENaC[112-122] concentration may provide a useful biomarker of ENaC activation in future clinical studies.

PMID:26113616\n\nA fluorogenic near-infrared imaging agent for quantifying plasma and local tissue renin activity in vivo and ex vivo\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Jun; Preda, Dorin V.; Vasquez, Kristine O.; Morin, Jeff; Delaney, Jeannine; Bao, Bagna; Percival, M. David; Xu, Daigen; McKay, Dan; Klimas, Michael; Bednar, Bohumil; Sur, Cyrille; Gao, David Z.; Madden, Karen; Yared, Wael; Rajopadhye, Milind\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is well studied for its regulation of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis, as well as for increased activity associated with a variety of diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and kidney disease. The enzyme renin cleaves angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I (ANG I), which is further cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme to produce ANG II. Although ANG II is the main effector molecule of the RAS, renin is the rate-limiting enzyme, thus playing a pivotal role in regulating RAS activity in hypertension and organ injury processes. Our objective was to develop a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) renin-imaging agent for noninvasive in vivo detection of renin activity as a measure of tissue RAS and in vitro plasma renin activity. We synthesized a renin-activatable agent, ReninSense 680 FAST (ReninSense), using a NIRF-quenched substrate derived from angiotensinogen that is cleaved specifically by purified mouse and rat renin enzymes to generate a fluorescent signal. This agent was assessed in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo to detect and quantify increases in plasma and kidney renin activity in sodium-sensitive inbred C57BL/6 mice maintained on a low dietary sodium and diuretic regimen. Noninvasive in vivo fluorescence molecular tomographic imaging of the ReninSense signal in the kidney detected increased renin activity in the kidneys of hyperreninemic C57BL/6 mice. The agent also effectively detected renin activity in ex vivo kidneys, kidney tissue sections, and plasma samples. This approach could provide a new tool for assessing disorders linked to altered tissue and plasma renin activity and to monitor the efficacy of therapeutic treatments.

I.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nSubstance P inhibits renin secretion. This polypeptide is a transmitter in primary afferent neurons and is released from the peripheral as well as the central portions of these neurons. It is present in afferent nerves from the kidneys. Neuropeptide Y, which is a cotransmitter with norepinephrine and epinephrine, is found in sympathetic neurons that are closely associated with and presumably innervate the juxtagolmerular cells. Its effect on renin secretion is unknown, but it produces renal vasoconstriction and natriuresis. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a cotransmitter with acetylocholine in cholinergic neurons, and this polypeptide stimulates renin secretion. We cannot find any evidence for its occurence in neurons in the kidneys, but various stimuli increase plasma VIP to levels comparable to those produced by doses of exogenous VIP which stimulated renin secretion. Neostigmine increases plasma VIP and plasma renin activity, and the VIP appears to be responsible for the increase in renin secretion, since the increase is not blocked by renal denervation or propranolol. Stimulation of various areas in the brain produces sympathetically mediated increases in plasma renin activity associated with increases in blood pressure. However, there is pharmacological evidence that the renin response can be separated from the blood pressure response. In anaesthetized dogs, drugs that increase central serotonergic discharge increase renin secretion without increasing blood pressure. In rats, activation of sertonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus increases renin secretion by a pathway that projects from this nucleus to the ventral hypothalamus, and from there to the kidneys via the sympathetic nervous system. The serotonin releasing drug parachloramphetamine also increases plasma VIP, but VIP does not appear to be the primary mediator of the renin response. There is preliminary evidence that the serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus are part of the\n\n[Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity during head-up tilt testing in patients with vasovagal syncope].\n\nPubMed\n\nGajek, Jacek; ZyÅko, Dorota; Mazurek, Walentyna\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThe stimulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system during tilt table test is caused by sympathetic nervous system activation by orthostatic stress and a serotonin release as well. In healthy individuals increase of plasma renin activity during test with maximal values on the peak of the test was described. The aim of the study was to assess the activation of RAAS in patients with neurally mediated syncope during the tilt table test by means of plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels. The study was carried out in 31 patients aged 39.4 +/- 15.0 years (18 women and 13 men) with neurally mediated syncope during tilt test. Plasma renin activity was assessed in the baseline conditions, immediately after the test and 10 minutes after the test using radioenzymatic assay. Aldosterone concentrations were measured radioimmunologically, twice: after 30 minutes supine rest and after the syncope. Plasma renin activity during supine rest was 2.2 +/- 2.4 ng/ml/h, rose after the syncope 2.5-fold to 5.2 +/- 4.5 ng/ml/h (p < 0.001 comparing to baseline) stayed on similar level approximately for the next 10 minutes--4.9 +/- 5.5 ng/ml/h (p = n.s.). In 11 patients (35%) 10 minutes after the test even further increase of PRA was observed. Serum aldosterone level increased significantly immediately after tilt test (90.0 +/- 72.9 vs 178.8 +/- 150.1 pg/ml, p < 0.01). Authors showed, that in patients with NMS plasma renin activity increases and this increase lasts for 10 minutes after the syncope and the concentration of aldosterone increases immediately after tilt test.\n\nControl plasma renin activity and changes in sympathetic tone as determinants of minoxidil-induced increase in plasma renin activity.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nO'Malley, K; Velasco, M; Wells, J; McNay, J L\n\n1975-01-01\n\nA study was made of the possible mechanism(s) underlying minoxidil-induced increase in plasma renin activity (PRA). 10 patients with essential hypertension were treated with minoxidil and subsequently with a combination of minoxidil plus propranolol. Minoxidil lowered mean arterial pressure 31.6 plus or minus 3.3 mm Hg, mean plus or minus SEM. There was an associated increase in both PRA, 6.26 plus or minus 2.43 NG/ML/H, and heart rate, 21.4 plus or minus 2.7 beats/min. The changes in PRA and heart rate were positively correlated, r, 0.79. Addition of propranolol reduced mean arterial pressure by a further 10.1 plus or minus 1.5 mm Hg and returned heart rate to control levels. Propranolol reduced PRA significantly but not to control levels. Control PRA positively correlated with PRA on minoxidil, r, 0.97, and with PRA on minoxidil plus propranolol, r, 0.98. We conclude that control PRA is a major determinant of change in PRA with minoxidil. Minoxidil increased PRA by at least two mechanisms: (a) an adrenergic mechanism closely related to change in heart rate and blocked by propranolol, and (b) a mechanism(s) not sensitive to propranolol and possibly related to decrease in renal perfusion pressure. PMID:1127099\n\nRenin in differential diagnosis of hypertension.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOparil, S.; Haber, E.\n\n1971-01-01\n\nRenin is a proteolytic enzyme secreted by the kidney. Techniques for the direct measurement of renin content of human blood are not available at the present time. Two of the best known causes of remediable hypertension can be diagnosed from abnormalities in renin activity and aldosterone production. In renovascular hypertension, renin secretion is increased because of impaired glomerular perfusion. The renin activity assay, when applied in a carefully controlled fashion, is a useful screening test for treatable causes of hypertension.\n\nPlasma volume, osmolality, vasopressin, and renin activity during graded exercise in man\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nConvertino, V. A.; Keil, L. C.; Bernauer, E. M.; Greenleaf, J. E.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe influence of work intensity on plasma volume, osmolality, vasopressin and renin activity and the interrelationships between these responses are investigated. Plasma volume, renin activity and osmotic, sodium and arginine vasopressin concentrations were measured in venous blood samples taken from 15 healthy male subjects before and after six minutes of bicycle ergometer exercise at 100, 175 and 225 W. Plasma volume is found to decrease significantly with increasing work intensity, while increases in Na(+) concentration, osmolality and vasopressin are only observed to be significant when the work intensity exceeds 40% maximal aerobic capacity and plasma resin activity increased linearly at all work levels. In addition, significant correlations are observed between plasma volume and osmolality and sodium changes, and between vasopressin and osmolality and sodium content changes. Data thus support the hypotheses that (1) vasopressin may be the primary controlling endocrine for fluid and electrolyte levels following exercise; (2) an exercise intensity greater than 40% maximal aerobic capacity is required to stimulate vasopressin release through changes in plasma osmolality; and (3) the stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system is a more general stress response.\n\nSelective Deletion of the Brain-Specific Isoform of Renin Causes Neurogenic Hypertension.\n\nPubMed\n\nShinohara, Keisuke; Liu, Xuebo; Morgan, Donald A; Davis, Deborah R; Sequeira-Lopez, Maria Luisa S; Cassell, Martin D; Grobe, Justin L; Rahmouni, Kamal; Sigmund, Curt D\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the brain is a critical determinant of blood pressure, but the mechanisms regulating RAS activity in the brain remain unclear. Expression of brain renin (renin-b) occurs from an alternative promoter-first exon. The predicted translation product is a nonsecreted enzymatically active renin whose function is unknown. We generated a unique mouse model by selectively ablating the brain-specific isoform of renin (renin-b) while preserving the expression and function of the classical isoform expressed in the kidney (renin-a). Preservation of renal renin was confirmed by measurements of renin gene expression and immunohistochemistry. Surprisingly, renin-b-deficient mice exhibited hypertension, increased sympathetic nerve activity to the kidney and heart, and impaired baroreflex sensitivity. Whereas these mice displayed decreased circulating RAS activity, there was a paradoxical increase in brain RAS activity. Physiologically, renin-b-deficient mice exhibited an exaggerated depressor response to intracerebroventricular administration of losartan, captopril, or aliskiren. At the molecular level, renin-b-deficient mice exhibited increased expression of angiotensin-II type 1 receptor in the paraventricular nucleus, which correlated with an increased renal sympathetic nerve response to leptin, which was dependent on angiotensin-II type 1 receptor activity. Interestingly, despite an ablation of renin-b expression, expression of renin-a was significantly increased in rostral ventrolateral medulla. These data support a new paradigm for the genetic control of RAS activity in the brain by a coordinated regulation of the renin isoforms, with expression of renin-b tonically inhibiting expression of renin-a under baseline conditions. Impairment of this control mechanism causes neurogenic hypertension.

All Pb-exposed groups sacrificed by decapitation had elevated mean plasma renin activities (PRA), relative to controls. Pentobarbital-anesthesia and laparotomy markedly increased PRA in the 0, 100, and 500 ppm groups, but the increase was significantly less in the 100 ppm group.moreÂ Â» Renal renin concentration was normal in the 5 and 25 ppm groups, but was significantly increased in the 100 and 500 ppm groups. The ratio of plasma angiotensin II to PRA was normal in the 100 ppm group but significantly reduced in the 500 ppm group. We conclude that exposure of rats to those generally present in human populations stimulates basal renin secretion in 1-month-old rats, but partially inhibits the response to renin-releasing stimuli. The highest dose reduces plasma angiotensin II at any given PRA. These results, taken with previous publications, emphasize that the effects of lead on plasma renin even within a single species are greatly affected by the timing of the exposure.Â«Â less\n\nIncreased Dietary Salt Changes Baroreceptor Sensitivity and Intrarenal Renin-Angiotensin System in Goldblatt Hypertension.\n\nPubMed\n\nShimoura, Caroline G; Lincevicius, Gisele S; Nishi, Erika E; Girardi, Adriana C C; Simon, Karin A; Bergamaschi, Cassia T; Campos, Ruy R\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRenovascular hypertension (2-kidney 1-clip model (2K1C)) is characterized by renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation. Increased Angiotensin II (AngII) leads to sympathoexcitation, oxidative stress, and alterations in sodium and water balance. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a discrete increase in sodium chloride intake in 2K1C rats leads to changes in cardiovascular and autonomic function, oxidative stress, and renin angiotensin aldosterone system. After 4 weeks of induction of hypertension, rats were fed a normal sodium diet (0.4% NaCl) or a high-sodium diet (2% NaCl) for 2 consecutive weeks. Experiments were carried out for 6 weeks after clipping. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal sympathetic nerve activity (rSNA), arterial baroreflex control of rSNA, and heart rate (HR) were assessed. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and glutathione were measured as indicators of systemic oxidative stress. Angiostensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, and angiotensinogen were evaluated in clipped and unclipped kidneys as also urinary angiotensinogen and plasma renin activity. Angiotensinogen, plasma renin activity (PRA) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 in clipped and unclipped kidneys were evaluated. High-sodium diet did not change systemic oxidative stress, and basal values of MAP, HR, or rSNA; however, increased renal (-0.7Â±0.2 vs. -1.5Â±0.1 spikes/s/mm Hg) and cardiac (-0.9Â±0.14 vs. -1.5Â±0.14 bpm/mm Hg) baroreceptor reflex sensitivity in 2K1C rats. Although there was no alteration in PRA, a high-salt diet significantly decreased urinary angiotensinogen, ACE, and ACE2 expressions in the clipped and unclipped kidneys. Increased arterial baroreceptor control associated with a suppression of the intrarenal RAS in the 2K1C rats on high-salt diet provide a salt-resistant effect on hypertension and sympathoexcitation in renovascular hypertensive rats.

Methylglyoxal, a reactive glucose metabolite, is elevated in diabetic patients. We investigated the effects of methylglyoxal on the renin-angiotensin system and blood pressure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a continuous infusion of methylglyoxal with a minipump for 4 weeks. Organs/tissues and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were used for molecular studies. High-performance liquid chromatography, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to measure methylglyoxal, proteins, and mRNA, respectively. Small interfering RNA for angiotensinogen and the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) were used to study mechanisms. Methylglyoxal-treated rats developed a significant increase in blood pressure and plasma levels of aldosterone, renin, angiotensin, and catecholamines. Methylglyoxal level and protein and mRNA for angiotensin, AT1 receptor, adrenergic Î±1D receptor, and renin were significantly increased in the aorta and/or kidney of methylglyoxal-treated rats, a novel finding. Alagebrium attenuated the above effects of methylgloyxal. Treatment of cultured VSMCs with methylglyoxal or high glucose (25 mM) significantly increased cellular methylglyoxal and protein and mRNA for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB), angiotensin, AT1 receptor, and Î±1D receptor, which were prevented by inhibition of NF-ÎºB, and by alagebrium. Silencing of mRNA for RAGE prevented the increase in NF-kB induced by methylglyoxal. Silencing of mRNA for angiotensinogen prevented the increase in NF-ÎºB, angiotensin, AT1 receptor, and Î±1D receptor. Methylglyoxal activates NF-ÎºB through RAGE and thereby increases renin-angiotensin levels, a novel finding, and a probable mechanism of increase in blood pressure.\n\nRegulation of Renin Secretion and Arterial Pressure During Prolonged Baroreflex Activation: Influence of Salt Intake\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHildebrandt, Drew A.; Irwin, Eric D.; Cates, Adam W.; Lohmeier, Thomas E.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nChronic electrical activation of the carotid baroreflex produces sustained reductions in sympathetic activity and arterial pressure and is currently being evaluated as antihypertensive therapy for patients with resistant hypertension. However, the influence of variations in salt intake on blood pressure lowering during baroreflex activation has not been determined. As sensitivity of arterial pressure to salt intake is linked to the responsiveness of renin secretion, we determined steady-state levels of arterial pressure and neurohormonal responses in 6 dogs on low, normal, and high salt intakes ( 5, 40, 450 mmol/day, respectively) under control conditions and during a 7-day constant level of baroreflex activation. Under control conditions, there was no difference in mean arterial pressure at low (92Â±1) and normal (92Â±2 mmHg) sodium intakes, but pressure increased 9 Â±2 mmHg during high salt. Plasma renin activity (2.01Â±0.23, 0.93Â±0.20, 0.01Â±0.01 ng ANGI/mL/hr) and plasma aldosterone (10.3Â±1.9, 3.5Â±0.5, 1.7Â±0.1ng/dL) were inversely related to salt intake, whereas there were no changes in plasma norepinephrine. Although mean arterial pressure (19-22 mmHg) and norepinephrine (20-40%) were lower at all salt intakes during baroreflex activation, neither the changes in pressure nor the absolute values for plasma renin activity or aldosterone in response to salt were different from control conditions. These findings demonstrate that suppression of sympathetic activity by baroreflex activation lowers arterial pressure without increasing renin release and indicate that changes in sympathetic activity are not primary mediators of the effect of salt on renin secretion. Consequently, blood pressure lowering during baroreflex activation is independent of salt intake.

Therefore, a low salt diet is now recommended to prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease. However, it is still unknown whether an excessively low salt diet is beneficial or harmful for the heart. Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) received normal salt chow (0.9% salt diet) and excessively low salt chow (0.01% salt diet referred to as saltless diet) for 8 weeks from 8 to 16 weeks of age. The effects of the excessively low salt diet on the cardiac (pro) renin receptor, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, and sympatho-adrenal systems were investigated. The excessively low salt diet did not affect the systolic blood pressure but significantly increased the heart rate both in WKYs and SHRs. The excessively low salt diet significantly elevated plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin I, II and aldosterone concentrations, and plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations both in WKYs and SHRs. Cardiac expressions of renin, prorenin, (P)RR, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin II AT1 receptor and phosphorylated (p)-ERK1/2, p-HSP27, p-38MAPK, and TGF-Ã1 were significantly enhanced by the excessively low salt diet in both WKYs and SHRs. The excessively low salt diet accelerated cardiac interstitial and perivascular fibrosis and increased the cardiomyocyte size and interventricular septum thickness in WKYs and SHRs but the extent was greater in SHRs. An excessively low salt diet damages the heart through activation of plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympatho-adrenal systems and activation of cardiac (P)RR and angiotensin II AT1 receptor and their downstream signals both in WKYs and SHRs.\n\nPlasma soluble (pro)renin receptor is independent of plasma renin, prorenin, and aldosterone concentrations but is affected by ethnicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nNguyen, GeneviÃ¨ve; Blanchard, Anne; Curis, Emmanuel; Bergerot, Damien; Chambon, Yann; Hirose, Takuo; Caumont-Prim, Aurore; Tabard, Sylvie Brailly; Baron, StÃ©phanie; Frank, Michael; Totsune, Kazuhito; Azizi, Michel\n\n2014-02-01\n\nA soluble (pro)renin receptor (sPRR) circulates in plasma and is able to bind renin and prorenin. It is not known whether plasma sPRR concentrations vary with the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. We measured plasma sPRR, renin, prorenin, and aldosterone concentrations in 121 white and 9 black healthy subjects, 40 patients with diabetes mellitus, 41 hypertensive patients with or without renin-angiotensin system blockers, 9 patients with primary aldosteronism, and 10 patients with Gitelman syndrome. Median physiological plasma sPRR concentration was 23.5 ng/mL (interquartile range, 20.9-26.5) under usual uncontrolled sodium diet. sPRR concentration in healthy subjects, unlike renin and prorenin, did not display circadian variation or dependence on age, sex, posture, or hormonal status. sPRR concentrations were â25% lower in black than in white subjects, whereas renin concentrations were â40% lower. Patients with diabetes mellitus (average renin-high prorenin levels) and with hypertension only (average renin-average prorenin levels) had sPRR concentrations similar to healthy subjects. Renin-angiotensin system blockade was associated with increase of sPRR concentration by â12%. sPRR in patients with primary aldosteronism (low renin-low prorenin) and Gitelman syndrome (high renin-high prorenin) were similar and â10% higher than in healthy subjects. There was no correlation between sPRR and renin or prorenin. In conclusion, our results show that plasma sPRR concentrations are dependent on ethnicity and independent of renin, prorenin, and aldosterone concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with contrasted degrees of renin-angiotensin system activity.\n\nExpression and nutritional regulation of the (pro)renin receptor in rat visceral adipose tissue.\n\nPubMed\n\nAchard, V; Tassistro, V; Boullu-Ciocca, S; Grino, M\n\n2011-12-01\n\nEarly life nutritional environment plays an important role in the development of visceral adipose tissue and interacts with nutritional regulations in adulthood, leading to metabolic dysregulations. We hypothesized that the renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the programming-induced development of visceral adipose tissue. We studied, using a model of programming of overweight and glucose intolerance, obtained by post-natal overfeeding with consecutive highfat diet, the status of plasma renin activity and mesenteric adipose renin-angiotensin system, including the recently identified (pro)renin receptor, in adult rats. Post-natal overfeeding or high-fat feeding lead to overweight with increased visceral fat mass and adipocytes surface. When both paradigms were associated, adipocytes surface showed a disproportionate increase. A strong immunoreactivity for (pro)renin receptor was found in stromal cells. Plasma renin activity increased in programmed animals whereas (pro)renin receptor expressing cells density was stimulated by high-fat diet. There was a positive, linear relationship between plasma renin activity and (pro)renin receptor expressing cells density and adipocytes surface. Our experiments demonstrate that association of post-natal overfeeding and high-fat diet increased plasma renin activity and adipose (pro)renin receptor expression. Such phenomenon could explain, at least in part, the associated disproportionate adipocyte hypertrophy and its accompanying increased glucose intolerance.\n\nNEW RENIN INHIBITORS - STABILITY AND ACTIVITY DETERMINATION. PART IV.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarszalek, Dorota; Goldnik, Anna; Winiecka, Iwona; Jaworsk, Pawel; Mazurek Aleksander P\n\n2017-03-01\n\nA series of new seven potential renin inhibitors containing pseudodipeptides were synthesized. Stability for all compounds (1-7) in homogenates of liver, kidney, lung and in serum, gastric, intestinal juice and in the presence of Î±-chymotrypsin was determined. Compound 1 was unstable in all determined mediums. Compounds 2, 4, 5 and 7 were unstable, compound 3 was stable, compound 6 was unstable only in Î±-chy-motrypsin solution. Inhibitory activity of the compounds was measured in vitro by HPLC determination of low-ering concentration of substrate (angiotensinogen) in the presence of renin and the potential renin inhibitor (compounds 1-7). Compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 showed inhibitory activity (1.12 x 10â»â·, 0.96 x 10â»â¶, 1.58 x10â»â·,1.68 x 10â»â¶, 1.30 x 10â»â¶, 0.96 x 10â»â·M, respectively).\n\nAssociations between glycaemic control and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.\n\nPubMed\n\nGriffin, T P; Wall, D; Browne, G A; Dennedy, M C; O'Shea, P M\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIntroduction Hyperglycaemia increases succinate concentrations and succinate receptor activation in the kidney resulting in renin release. The aim of our study was to determine if there is an association between glycaemic control as evidenced by glycated haemoglobin values and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at Galway University Hospitals between December 2014 and March 2015. Participants ( nâ=â66) were identified following interrogation of the electronic database for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Baseline clinical demographics, aldosterone, plasma renin activity, direct renin concentration, urea and electrolytes, glycated haemoglobin, cholesterol, urine sodium and albumin creatinine ratio were recorded. Results There was a significant positive linear correlation between glycated haemoglobin and renin (both plasma renin activity [ Pâ=â0.002] and direct renin concentration [ Pâ=â0.008]) and between serum creatinine and aldosterone measured using both radioimmunoassay ( Pâ=â0.008) and immunochemiluminometric assay ( Pâ=â0.008). A significant negative linear correlation was demonstrated between serum sodium and plasma renin activity ( Pâ=â0.005) and direct renin concentration ( Pâ=â0.015) and between estimated glomerular filtration rate and aldosterone measured using radioimmunoassay ( Pâ=â0.02) and immunochemiluminometric assay ( Pâ=â0.016). A significant negative linear correlation existed between urine sodium and plasma renin activity ( Pâ=â0.04) and aldosterone measured using radioimmunoassay ( Pâ=â0.045). Conclusions There is a direct positive association between glycaemic control and renin. We advocate for renin measurement to be part of the diabetologist's armamentarium to assess, guide and optimize therapeutic strategies in patients with diabetes.\n\nRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibition Increases Podocyte Derivation from Cells of Renin Lineage\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLichtnekert, Julia; Kaverina, Natalya V.; Eng, Diana G.; Gross, Kenneth W.; Kutz, J. Nathan; Pippin, Jeffrey W.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBecause adult podocytes cannot proliferate and are therefore unable to self-renew, replacement of these cells depends on stem/progenitor cells. Although podocyte number is higher after renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition in glomerular diseases, the events explaining this increase are unclear. Cells of renin lineage (CoRL) have marked plasticity, including the ability to acquire a podocyte phenotype. To test the hypothesis that RAAS inhibition partially replenishes adult podocytes by increasing CoRL number, migration, and/or transdifferentiation, we administered tamoxifen to Ren1cCreERxRs-tdTomato-R CoRL reporter mice to induce permanent labeling of CoRL with red fluorescent protein variant tdTomato. We then induced experimental FSGS, typified by abrupt podocyte depletion, with a cytopathic antipodocyte antibody. RAAS inhibition by enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or losartan (angiotensin-receptor blocker) in FSGS mice stimulated the proliferation of CoRL, increasing the reservoir of these cells in the juxtaglomerular compartment (JGC). Compared with water or hydralazine, RAAS inhibition significantly increased the migration of CoRL from the JGC to the intraglomerular compartment (IGC), with more glomeruli containing RFP+CoRL and, within these glomeruli, more RFP+CoRL. Moreover, RAAS inhibition in FSGS mice increased RFP+CoRL transdifferentiation in the IGC to phenotypes, consistent with those of podocytes (coexpression of synaptopodin and Wilms tumor protein), parietal epithelial cells (PAX 8), and mesangial cells (Î±8 integrin). These results show that in the context of podocyte depletion in FSGS, RAAS inhibition augments CoRL proliferation and plasticity toward three different glomerular cell lineages.

The dependence of the proteinuric effect on the enzymatic activity was shown by using (a) renin preparations of widely varying purity and (b) chemically modified \"active\" and \"inactive\" renin derivatives. Angiotensin II, the pressor product of the enzymatic action of renin, also produced significant proteinuria. Adrenalectomy abolished the proteinuria induced by renin. Proteinuria, however, occurred as a result of pretreatment with DOCA, or aldosterone, or without treatment, 7 to 8 weeks after adrenalectomy. Electron microscopic studies of the kidney at the time of maximal proteinuria showed focal flattening and fusion of epithelial foot processes, as well as swelling and vesicle formation in endothelial and epithelial cells of the glomeruli. Studies with intravenously injected saccharated iron oxide showed increased permeability of the glomerular capillary basement membrane to these particles. These changes were transient and were not seen 24 hours after renin injection. Adrenalectomy prevented these changes. It is concluded that renin, acting through angiotensin, causes glomerular capillary damage with increased permeability of these structures to protein and resultant proteinuria. The adrenal glands participate in a permissive role in this phenomenon.

Alexithymia is associated with increased psychological distress, less social skills and fewer close relationships, making alexithymic subjects particularly susceptible to chronic stress imposed by \"living alone\". Only few studies investigated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) activity in response to chronic stress. We aimed at evaluating the effects of \"living alone\" as a paradigm for chronic stress on RAAS activity and putatively differential effects depending on alexithymic personality features. Alexithymia and serum concentrations of renin and aldosterone were measured in 944 subjects from the population-based SHIP-1 study. Subgroups were formed using the median of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20) and a cohabitation status of \"living alone\" or \"living together\". Analyses were adjusted for various psychosocial, behavioral and metabolic risk factors. \"Living alone\" was associated with elevated plasma renin (p<0.01, Î²=0.138) but not aldosterone concentrations in the total sample. On subgroup level, we found associations of \"living alone\" and elevated renin concentrations only in subjects low in TAS-20 scores (p<0.01, Î²=0.219). Interactional effects of alexithymiaÃcohabitation status were found for the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (p=0.02, Î²=-0.234). The association of chronic stress imposed by \"living alone\" with increased RAAS activity contributes to explain the relationship of this psychosocial stress condition and increased risk for CVD. In contrast, alexithymic subjects may be less affected by the deleterious effects of \"living alone\". Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Nonetheless, knowledge on the renal microvasculature and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity in kidneys with FMD is scarce. Given the fairly good results of revascularization, we hypothesized that the renal microvasculature and RAS are relatively spared in kidneys with FMD. In 58 hypertensive patients with multifocal renal artery FMD (off medication) and 116 matched controls with essential hypertension, we measured renal blood flow (Xenon washout method) per kidney and drew blood samples from the aorta and both renal veins to determine renin secretion and glomerular filtration rate per kidney. We found that renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in FMD were comparable to those in controls. Although systemic renin levels were somewhat higher in FMD, renal renin secretion was not elevated. Moreover, in patients with unilateral FMD, no differences between the affected and unaffected kidney were observed with regard to renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, or renin secretion. In men, renin levels and renin secretion were higher as compared with women. The renal blood flow response to RAS modulation (by intrarenal infusion of angiotensin II, angiotensin-(1-7), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, or a nitric oxide synthase blocker) was also comparable between FMD and controls. Renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, and the response to vasoactive substances in kidneys with multifocal FMD are comparable to patients with essential hypertension, suggesting that microvascular function is relatively spared. Renin secretion was not increased and the response to RAS modulation was not affected in kidneys with FMD.\n\nLack of effect of vasopressin replacement on renin hypersecretion in Brattleboro rats\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGolin, Raffaello M. A.; Gotoh, Eiji; Keil, Lanny C.; Shackelford, Roy L.; Ganong, William F.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe congenital vasopressin deficiency in homozygous Brattleboro rats with diabetes insipidus is associated with elevated plasma renin activity at rest and supernormal responses to stimuli that increase renin secretion. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon was investigated by infusing homozygous and heterozygous Brattleboro rats with a dose of arginine vasopressin that restored plasma vasopressin to normal in the homozygous animals. The resulting data indicate that increased renin secretion in homozygous rats results from increased sympathetic activity. Because circulating vasopressin does not cross the blood-brain barrier, it seems likely that the increased sympathetic activity is central in origin.\n\nRenin stimulation by passive tilting: the influence of an anti-gravity suit on postural changes in plasma renin activity, plasma noradrenaline concentration and kidney function in normal man.\n\nPubMed\n\nHesse, B; Ring-Larsen, H; Nielsen, I; Christensen, N J\n\n1978-04-01\n\nPlasma renin activity (PRA), plasma noradrenaline concentration, heart rate, blood pressure, and clearances of para-aminohippurate and inulin were measured in twelve normal subjects (clearances in only three subjects) before and after 40 min of 60 degrees upright tilting. The tilting experiments were repeated after inflation of an anti-gravity suit to 60 mmHg on the lower extremities. Inflation of the anti-gravity suit caused an abolition of the postural PRA increase, a marked reduction of the postural increases in plasma noradrenaline and heart rate, and elimination of the decreases in pulse pressure, inulin and para-aminohippurate clearances and sodium excretion. The results suggest a decisive role of the sympathetic nervous system for postural renin increase, probably mainly activated by stretch receptors in the low-pressure cardiopulmoanry area.\n\nIs renin a risk factor?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKirkendall, W. M.; Overturf, M. L.; Druilhet, R. E.\n\n1981-01-01\n\n1. These results show that elevated blood pressure and a hyperlipidemic diet exacerbate atherogenesis in the two kidney, one-clip hypertensive rabbit. Elevated PRA activity was not essential for the hypertension and did not exacerbate atherogenesis. 2. In addition, the experimentally induced, low renin state following DOC-saline did not result in a protective effect on cardiovascular lesions in rabbits fed an atherogenic diet when compared to normal renin controls. 3. Thus, in these experiments neither an increase in plasma renin accelerated atherogenesis, nor did a decrease in PRA slow the rate of production of atherosclerosis in the rabbit. 4. These observations lend no support to the thesis that renin is an independent risk factor when it is generated within the body in response to these stimuli. Indeed, it suggests that in this setting other factors, not PRA, are responsible for both hypertension in the two-kidney, one-clip rabbit and the arterial damage which occurs in this hypercholesterolemic model. PMID:7025426\n\nControlled treatment of primary hypertension with propranolol and spironolactone. A crossover study with special reference to initial plasma renin activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarlberg, B E; KÃ¥gedal, B; Tegler, L; Tolagen, K; Bergman, B\n\n1976-03-31\n\nTwenty-seven patients with hypertension were randomly allocated to a 10 month crossover study. Treatment consisted of spironolactone (200 mg/day for 2 months), propranolol (320 mg/day for 2 months) and combined administration of both drugs at half the dosage. Between treatment periods placebo was given for 2 months. Fourteen patients were previously untreated. The average pretreatment blood pressure for the entire group was 188/114 +/- 16/7(mean +/- standard deviation) mm Hg supine and 188/118 +/- 20/9 mm Hg standing. Both spironolactone and propranolol reduced blood pressure significantly in both the supine and standing positions. Upright plasma renin activity was determined by radioimmunoassay of angiotensin I. The average initial level was 1.9 +/- 1.2 (range 0.4 to 5.0) ng/ml/hr. There was a close correlation between plasma renin activity and the effects of the drugs: With increasing renin level the response to propranolol was better whereas the opposite was true for spironolactone. The combination of spironolactone and propranolol decreased the blood pressure still further in the supine and standing positions, irrespective of initial plasma renin activity. All patients achieved a normal supine pressure. Blood pressure and plasma renin activity returned toward pretreatment values during placebo administration. It is concluded that pretreatment levels of plasma renin activity can predict the antihypertensive response to propranolol and spironolactone. The combination of the two drugs, which have different modes of action, will effectively reduce blood pressure in hypertension. The results support the concept that the renin-angiotensin-aldo-sterone system may be involved in primary hypertension.\n\nPlasma renin activity, aldosterone and catecholamine levels when swimming and running.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuezennec, C Y; Defer, G; Cazorla, G; Sabathier, C; Lhoste, F\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the response of plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and catecholamines to two graded exercises differing by posture. Seven male subjects (19-25 years) performed successively a running rest on a treadmill and a swimming test in a 50-m swimming pool. Each exercise was increased in severity in 5-min steps with intervals of 1 min. Oxygen consumption, heart rate and blood lactate, measured every 5 min, showed a similar progression in energy expenditure until exhaustion, but there was a shorter time to exhaustion in the last step of the running test. PRA, PAC and catecholamines were increased after both types of exercise. The PRA increase was higher after the running test (20.9 ng AngI X ml-1 X h-1) than after swimming (8.66 ng AngI X ml-1 X h-1). The PAC increase was slightly greater after running (123 pg X ml-1) than swimming (102 pg X ml-1), buth the difference was not significant. Plasma catecholamine was higher after the swimming test. These results suggest that the volume shift induced by the supine position and water pressure during swimming decreased the PRA response. The association after swimming compared to running of a decreased PRA and an enhanced catecholamine response rule out a strict dependence of renin release under the effect of plasma catecholamines and is evidence of the major role of neural pathways for renin secretion during physical exercise.\n\nLocal renin-angiotensin system contributes to hyperthyroidism-induced cardiac hypertrophy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobori, H; Ichihara, A; Miyashita, Y; Hayashi, M; Saruta, T\n\n1999-01-01\n\nWe have reported previously that thyroid hormone activates the circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin systems without involving the sympathetic nervous system, which contributes to cardiac hypertrophy in hyperthyroidism. This study examined whether the circulating or tissue renin-angiotensin system plays the principal role in hyperthyroidism-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The circulating renin-angiotensin system in Sprague-Dawley rats was fixed by chronic angiotensin II infusion (40 ng/min, 28 days) via mini-osmotic pumps. Daily i.p. injection of thyroxine (0.1 mg/kg per day, 28 days) was used to mimic hyperthyroidism. Serum free tri-iodothyronine, plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II, cardiac renin and cardiac angiotensin II were measured with RIAs. The cardiac expression of renin mRNA was evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II were kept constant in the angiotensin II and angiotensin II+thyroxine groups (0.12+/-0.03 and 0.15+/-0.03 microgram/h per liter, 126+/-5 and 130+/-5 ng/l respectively) (means+/-s.e.m.). Despite stabilization of the circulating renin-angiotensin system, thyroid hormone induced cardiac hypertrophy (5.0+/-0.5 vs 3.5+/-0.1 mg/g) in conjunction with the increases in cardiac expression of renin mRNA, cardiac renin and cardiac angiotensin II (74+/-2 vs 48+/-2%, 6.5+/-0.8 vs 3.8+/-0.4 ng/h per g, 231+/-30 vs 149+/-2 pg/g respectively). These results indicate that the local renin-angiotensin system plays the primary role in the development of hyperthyroidism-induced cardiac hypertrophy.\n\nInteraction of renin-angiotensin system and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in renal carcinogenesis of uninephrectomized rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Ke-Ke; Sui, Yi; Zhou, Hui-Rong; Zhao, Hai-Lu\n\n2017-05-01\n\nRenin-angiotensin system and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway both play important roles in carcinogenesis, but the interplay of renin-angiotensin system and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in carcinogenesis is not clear. In this study, we researched the interaction of renin-angiotensin system and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in renal carcinogenesis of uninephrectomized rats. A total of 96 rats were stratified into four groups: sham, uninephrectomized, and uninephrectomized treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Renal adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and its downstream molecule acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot at 10âmonths after uninephrectomy. Meanwhile, we examined renal carcinogenesis by histological transformation and expressions of Ki67 and mutant p53. During the study, fasting lipid profiles were detected dynamically at 3, 6, 8, and 10âmonths. The results indicated that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase expression in uninephrectomized rats showed 36.8% reduction by immunohistochemistry and 89.73% reduction by western blot. Inversely, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase expression increased 83.3% and 19.07% in parallel to hyperlipidemia at 6, 8, and 10âmonths. The histopathology of carcinogenesis in remnant kidneys was manifested by atypical proliferation and carcinoma in situ, as well as increased expressions of Ki67 and mutant p53. Intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker significantly prevented the inhibition of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and renal carcinogenesis in uninephrectomized rats.

While the mechanisms underlying this hypertension are unknown, plasma renin activity is often undetectable suggesting renin-angiotensin pathways are not involved. However, because aldosterone levels are preserved, we tested the hypothesis that angiotensin II is intact and contributes to the hypertension of autonomic failure. Indeed, circulating angiotensin II was paradoxically increased in hypertensive autonomic failure patients (52Â±5 pg/ml, n=11) compared to matched healthy controls (27Â±4 pg/ml, n=10; p=0.002), despite similarly low renin activity (0.19Â±0.06 versus 0.34Â±0.13 ng/ml/hr, respectively; p=0.449). To determine the contribution of angiotensin II to supine hypertension in these patients, we administered the AT1 receptor blocker losartan (50 mg) at bedtime in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n=11). Losartan maximally reduced systolic blood pressure by 32Â±11 mmHg at 6 hours after administration (p<0.05), decreased nocturnal urinary sodium excretion (p=0.0461), and did not worsen morning orthostatic tolerance. In contrast, there was no effect of the captopril on supine blood pressure in a subset of these patients. These findings suggest that angiotensin II formation in autonomic failure is independent of plasma renin activity, and perhaps angiotensin converting enzyme. Furthermore, these studies suggest that elevations in angiotensin II contribute to the hypertension of autonomic failure, and provide rationale for the use of AT1 receptor blockers for treatment of these patients.

The aim of the present study was to determine if the increase in renin secretion results from a direct renal action of milrinone, or from an indirect extrarenal effect of the drug. This was accomplished by comparing the effects of intrarenal and intravenous infusion of graded doses of milrinone on plasma renin activity in unilaterally nephrectomized conscious rabbits. Milrinone was infused into the renal artery in doses of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 micro-g/kg/min, and intravenously in the same rabbits in doses of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 micro-g/kg/min. Each dose was infused for 15 min. No intrarenal dose of milrinone altered plasma renin activity or arterial pressure, although at the highest dose, there was a small increase in heart rate. Intravenous infusion of milrinone at 1.0 micro-g/kg/min increased plasma renin activity to 176 +/- 55% of the control value (P less than 0.05). Heart rate increased but arterial pressure did not change. Intravenous infusion of milrinone at 1O micro-g/kg/min increased plasma renin activity to 386 +/- 193% of control in association with a decrease in arterial pressure and an increase in heart rate. These results confirm that milrinone increases renin secretion, and indicate that the stimulation is due to an extrarenal effect of the drug.\n\nIminopyrimidinones: A novel pharmacophore for the development of orally active renin inhibitors\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMcKittrick, Brian A.; Caldwell, John P.; Bara, Thomas\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe development of renin inhibitors with favorable oral pharmacokinetic profiles has been a longstanding challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. As part of our work to identify inhibitors of BACE1, we have previously developed iminopyrimidinones as a novel pharmacophore for aspartyl protease inhibition.

Here we characterized the RAS and kidney pathology in mice with genomic instability due to a defective nucleotide excision repair gene (Ercc1d/- mice). These mice display premature features of aging, including vascular dysfunction. Studies were performed in male and female Ercc1d/- mice and their wild type controls (Ercc1+/+) at the age of 12 or 18 weeks before and after treatment with losartan. The renin-activatable near-infrared fluorescent probe ReninSense 680â¢ was applied in vivo to allow non-invasive imaging of renin activity. Plasma renin concentrations (PRC) were additionally measured ex vivo by quantifying Ang I generation in the presence of excess angiotensinogen. Kidneys were harvested and examined for markers of aging, and albumin was determined in urine. Kidneys of 12-week old Ercc1d/- mice showed signs of aging, including tubular anisokaryosis, cell-senescence and increased apoptosis. This was even more pronounced at the age of 18 weeks. Yet, urinary albumin was normal at 12 weeks. The ReninSense 680â¢ probe showed increased intrarenal renin activity in Ercc1d/- mice versus Ercc1+/+ mice, both at 12 and 18 weeks of age, while PRC in these mice tended to be lower compared to Ercc1+/+ mice. Renin was higher in male than female mice, both in the kidney and in plasma, and losartan increased kidney and plasma renin in both Ercc1d/- and Ercc1+/+ mice. Rapidly aging Ercc1d/- mice display an activated intrarenal RAS, as evidenced by the increased fluorescence detected with the ReninSense 680â¢ probe. This increased RAS activity may contribute to the disturbed kidney pathology in these mice. The increased intrarenal activity detected with the ReninSense 680â¢ probe in male vs. female mice, as well as after losartan treatment, are in full agreement with the literature, and\n\nRole of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiac hypertrophy induced in rats by hyperthyroidism\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKOBORI, HIROYUKI; ICHIHARA, ATSUHIRO; SUZUKI, HIROMICHI; TAKENAKA, TSUNEO; MIYASHITA, YUTAKA; HAYASHI, MATSUHIKO; SARUTA, TAKAO\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis study was conducted to examine whether the renin-angiotensin system contributes to hyperthyroidism-induced cardiac hypertrophy without involving the sympathetic nervous system. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control-innervated, control-denervated, hyperthyroid-innervated, and hyperthyroid-denervated groups using intraperitoneal injections of thyroxine and 6-hydroxydopamine. After 8 wk, the heart-to-body weight ratio increased in hyperthyroid groups (63%), and this increase was only partially inhibited by sympathetic denervation. Radioimmunoassays and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed increased cardiac levels of renin (33%) and angiotensin II (53%) and enhanced cardiac expression of renin mRNA (225%) in the hyperthyroid groups. These increases were unaffected by sympathetic denervation or 24-h bilateral nephrectomy. In addition, losartan and nicardipine decreased systolic blood pressure to the same extent, but only losartan caused regression of thyroxine-induced cardiac hypertrophy. These results suggest that thyroid hormone activates the cardiac renin-angiotensin system without involving the sympathetic nervous system or the circulating renin-angiotensin system; the activated renin-angiotensin system contributes to cardiac hypertrophy in hyperthyroidism.

Y.; Siragy, H. M.; Haber, E.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThrough a systematic study of structure-activity relationships, we designed potent renin inhibitors for use in dog models. In assays against dog plasma renin at neutral pH, we found that, as in previous studies of rat renin inhibitors, the structure at the P2 position appears to be important for potency. The substitution of Val for His at this position increases potency by one order of magnitude. At the P3 position, potency appears to depend on a hydrophobic side chain that does not necessarily have to be aromatic. Our results also support the approach of optimizing potency in a renin inhibitor by introducing a moiety that promotes aqueous solubility (an amino group) at the C-terminus of the substrate analogue. In the design of potent dog plasma renin inhibitors, the influence of the transition-state residue 4(S)-amino-3(S)-hydroxy-5-cyclohexylpentanoic acid (ACHPA)-commonly used as a substitute for the scissile-bond dipeptide to boost potency-is not obvious, and appears to be sequence dependent. The canine renin inhibitor Ac-paF-Pro-Phe-Val-statine-Leu-Phe-paF-NH2 (compound 15; IC50 of 1.7 nM against dog plasma renin at pH 7.4; statine, 4(S)-amino-3(S)-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid; paF, para-aminophenylalanine) had a potent hypotensive effect when infused intravenously into conscious, sodium-depleted, normotensive dogs. Also, compound 15 concurrently inhibited plasma renin activity and had a profound diuretic effect.\n\nCharacterization of renin-angiotensin system enzyme activities in cultured mouse podocytes.\n\nPubMed\n\nVelez, Juan Carlos Q; Bland, Alison M; Arthur, John M; Raymond, John R; Janech, Michael G\n\n2007-07-01\n\nIntraglomerular ANG II has been linked to glomerular injury. However, little is known about the contribution of podocytes (POD) to intraglomerular ANG II homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to examine the processing of angiotensin substrates by cultured POD. Our approach was to use matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry for peptide determination from conditioned cell media and customized AQUA peptides for quantification. Immortalized mouse POD were incubated with 1-2 microM ANG I, ANG II, or the renin substrate ANG-(1-14) for different time intervals and coincubated in parallel with various inhibitors. Human mesangial cells (MES) were used as controls. POD incubated with 1 microM ANG I primarily formed ANG-(1-9) and ANG-(1-7). In contrast, MES incubated with ANG I primarily generated ANG II. In POD, ANG-(1-7) was the predominant product, and its formation was inhibited by a neprilysin inhibitor. Modest angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was also detected in POD, although only after cells were incubated with 2 microM ANG I. In addition, we observed that POD degraded ANG II into ANG III and ANG-(1-7). An aminopeptidase A inhibitor inhibited ANG III formation, and an ACE2 inhibitor led to ANG II accumulation. Furthermore, we found that POD converted ANG-(1-14) to ANG I and ANG-(1-7). This conversion was inhibited by a renin inhibitor. These findings demonstrate that POD express a functional intrinsic renin-angiotensin system characterized by neprilysin, aminopeptidase A, ACE2, and renin activities, which predominantly lead to ANG-(1-7) and ANG-(1-9) formation, as well as ANG II degradation. These findings may reflect a specific role of POD in maintenance of intraglomerular renin-angiotensin system balance.\n\nThe (pro)renin receptor and body fluid homeostasis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCao, Theresa\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has long been established as one of the major mechanisms of hypertension through the increased levels of angiotensin (ANG) II and its resulting effect on the sympathetic nerve activity, arterial vasoconstriction, water reabsorption, and retention, etc. In the central nervous system, RAS activation affects body fluid homeostasis through increases in sympathetic nerve activity, water intake, food intake, and arginine vasopressin secretion. Previous studies, however, have shown that ANG II can be made in the brain, and it could possibly be through a new component called the (pro)renin receptor. This review intends to summarize the central and peripheral effects of the PRR on body fluid homeostasis.

The objective of this study was to assess the role of the type I angiotensin II receptor in mediating an increase in arterial pressure associated with a single 6-hour IH exposure. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study design, we exposed 9 healthy male subjects to sham IH, IH with placebo medication, and IH with the type I angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan. We measured blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, and ventilation at baseline and after exposure to 6 hours of IH. An acute isocapnic hypoxia experimental protocol was conducted immediately before and after exposure to IH. IH with placebo increased resting mean arterial pressure by 7.9+/-1.6 mm Hg, but mean arterial pressure did not increase with sham IH (1.9+/-1.5 mm Hg) or with losartan IH (-0.2+/-2.4 mm Hg; P<0.05). Exposure to IH prevented the diurnal decrease in the cerebral blood flow response to hypoxia, independently of the renin-angiotensin system. Finally, in contrast to other models of IH, the acute hypoxic ventilatory response did not change throughout the protocol. IH increases arterial blood pressure through activation of the type I angiotensin II receptor, without a demonstrable impact on the cerebrovascular or ventilatory response to acute hypoxia.\n\nBiomarkers of activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure: how useful, how feasible?\n\nPubMed\n\nEmdin, Michele; Fatini, Cinzia; Mirizzi, Gianluca; Poletti, Roberta; Borrelli, Chiara; Prontera, Concetta; Latini, Roberto; Passino, Claudio; Clerico, Aldo; Vergaro, Giuseppe\n\n2015-03-30\n\nRenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), participated by kidney, liver, vascular endothelium, and adrenal cortex, and counter-regulated by cardiac endocrine function, is a complex endocrine system regulating systemic functions, such as body salt and water homeostasis and vasomotion, in order to allow the accomplishment of physiological tasks, such as orthostasis, physical and emotional stimuli, and to react towards the hemorrhagic insult, in tight conjunction with other neurohormonal axes, namely the sympathetic nervous system, the endothelin and vasopressin systems. The systemic as well as the tissue RAAS are also dedicated to promote tissue remodeling, particularly relevant after damage, when chronic activation may configure as a maladaptive response, leading to fibrosis, hypertrophy and apoptosis, and organ dysfunction. RAAS activation is a fingerprint of systemic arterial hypertension, kidney dysfunction, vascular atherosclerotic disease, and is definitely an hallmark of heart failure, which rapidly shifts from organ disease to a disorder of neurohormonal regulatory systems. Chronic RAAS activation is an indirect or direct target of most effective pharmacological treatments in heart failure, such as beta-blockers, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers. Biomarkers of RAAS activation are available, with different feasibility and accuracy, such as plasma renin activity, renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone, which all accompany the increasing clinical severity of heart failure disease, and are well recognized prognostic factors, even in patients with optimal therapy. Polymorphisms influencing the expression and activity of RAAS pathways have been recognized as clinically relevant biomarkers, likely influencing either the individual clinical phenotype, or the response to drugs. This solid, growing evidence strongly suggests the rationale for the use of\n\nNervous kidney. Interaction between renal sympathetic nerves and the renin-angiotensin system in the control of renal function.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiBona, G F\n\n2000-12-01\n\nIncreases in renal sympathetic nerve activity regulate the functions of the nephron, the vasculature, and the renin-containing juxtaglomerular granular cells. Because increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system can also influence nephron and vascular function, it is important to understand the interactions between the renal sympathetic nerves and the renin-angiotensin system in the control of renal function. These interactions can be intrarenal, for example, the direct (by specific innervation) and indirect (by angiotensin II) contributions of increased renal sympathetic nerve activity to the regulation of renal function. The effects of increased renal sympathetic nerve activity on renal function are attenuated when the activity of the renin-angiotensin system is suppressed or antagonized with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II-type AT(1)-receptor antagonists. The effects of intrarenal administration of angiotensin II are attenuated after renal denervation. These interactions can also be extrarenal, for example, in the central nervous system, wherein renal sympathetic nerve activity and its arterial baroreflex control are modulated by changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin system. In addition to the circumventricular organs, whose permeable blood-brain barrier permits interactions with circulating angiotensin II, there are interactions at sites behind the blood-brain barrier that depend on the influence of local angiotensin II. The responses to central administration of angiotensin II-type AT(1)-receptor antagonists into the ventricular system or microinjected into the rostral ventrolateral medulla are modulated by changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin system produced by physiological changes in dietary sodium intake. Similar modulation is observed in pathophysiological models wherein activity of both the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems is increased (eg, congestive heart failure). Thus, both renal and extrarenal sites of\n\nTRPV4 participates in pressure-induced inhibition of renin secretion by juxtaglomerular cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeghers, FranÃ§ois; Yerna, Xavier; Zanou, NadÃ¨ge; Devuyst, Olivier; Vennekens, Rudi; Nilius, Bernd; Gailly, Philippe\n\n2016-12-15\n\nIncrease in blood pressure in the renal afferent arteriole is known to induce an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) of juxtaglomerular (JG) cells and to result in a decreased secretion of renin. Mechanical stimulation of As4.1 JG cells induces an increase in [Ca 2+ ] i that is inhibited by HC067047 and RN1734, two inhibitors of TRPV4, or by siRNA-mediated repression of TRPV4. Inhibition of TRPV4 impairs pressure-induced decrease in renin secretion. Compared to wild-type mice, Trpv4 -/- mice present increased resting plasma levels of renin and aldosterone and present a significantly altered pressure-renin relationship. We suggest that TRPV4 channel participates in mechanosensation at the juxtaglomerular apparatus. The renin-angiotensin system is a crucial blood pressure regulation system. It consists of a hormonal cascade where the rate-limiting enzyme is renin, which is secreted into the blood flow by renal juxtaglomerular (JG) cells in response to low pressure in the renal afferent arteriole. In contrast, an increase in blood pressure results in a decreased renin secretion. This is accompanied by a transitory increase in [Ca 2+ ] i of JG cells. The inverse relationship between [Ca 2+ ] i and renin secretion has been called the 'calcium paradox' of renin release. How increased pressure induces a [Ca 2+ ] i transient in JG cells, is however, unknown. We observed that [Ca 2+ ] i transients induced by mechanical stimuli in JG As4.1 cells were completely abolished by HC067047 and RN1734, two inhibitors of TRPV4. They were also reduced by half by siRNA-mediated repression of TRPV4 but not after repression or inhibition of TRPV2 or Piezo1 ion channels. Interestingly, the stimulation of renin secretion by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin was totally inhibited by cyclic stretching of the cells. This effect was mimicked by stimulation with GSK1016790A and 4Î±PDD, two activators of TRPV4 and inhibited in the presence of HC067047.

Increased iron accumulation is associated with several degenerative diseases. However, there are no reports on the status of retinal iron or its implications in the pathogenesis of DR. In the present study, we found that retinas of type-1 and type-2 mouse models of diabetes have increased iron accumulation compared to non-diabetic retinas. We found similar iron accumulation in postmortem retinal samples from human diabetic patients. Further, we induced diabetes in HFE knockout (KO) mice model of genetic iron overload to understand the role of iron in the pathogenesis of DR. We found increased neuronal cell death, vascular alterations and loss of retinal barrier integrity in diabetic HFE KO mice compared to diabetic wildtype mice. Diabetic HFE KO mouse retinas also exhibited increased expression of inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Severity in the pathogenesis of DR in HFE KO mice was accompanied by increase in retinal renin expression mediated by G-protein-coupled succinate receptor GPR91. In light of previous reports implicating retinal renin-angiotensin system in DR pathogenesis, our results reveal a novel relationship between diabetes, iron and renin-angiotensin system, thereby unraveling new therapeutic targets for the treatment of DR.\n\nPlasma vasopressin and renin activity in women exposed to bed rest and +G/z/ acceleration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKeil, L. C.; Ellis, S.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nTo study the effect of prolonged recumbency on plasma vasopressin and renin activity, eight women were subjected to 17 days of absolute bed rest. The tolerance to +3G vertical acceleration of the subjects was tested before and after 14 days of bed rest. From day 2 and through day 17 of bed rest, plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels were reduced 33%. Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased 91% above ambulatory control values from days 10 through 15 of bed rest. When compared to precentrifuge values, exposure to vertical acceleration prior to bed rest provoked a 20-fold rise in mean plasma AVP but resulted in only a slight increase in PRA. After bed rest, acceleration increased plasma AVP 7-fold; however, the magnitude of this increase was less than the post +3G acceleration value obtained prior to bed rest. After bed rest, no significant rise was noted in PRA following +3G acceleration. This study demonstrates that prolonged bed rest leads to a significant rise in the PRA of female subjects, while exposure to positive vertical acceleration provokes a marked rise in plasma AVP.\n\nDecongestion Strategies and Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Activation in Acute Heart Failure\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMentz, Robert J.; Stevens, Susanna R.; DeVore, Adam D.; Lala, Anuradha; Vader, Justin M.; AbouEzzeddine, Omar F.; Khazanie, Prateeti; Redfield, Margaret M.; Stevenson, Lynne W.; O'Connor, Christopher M.; Goldsmith, Steven R.; Bart, Bradley A.; Anstrom, Kevin J.; Hernandez, Adrian F.; Braunwald, Eugene; Felker, G. Michael\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground High dose diuretics in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) are thought to activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and alternative decongestion strategies, such as ultrafiltration (UF), have been proposed to mitigate this RAAS activation. Methods We analyzed 427 AHF patients enrolled in the DOSE-AHF and CARRESS-HF trials. We assessed the relationship between two markers of RAAS activation (plasma renin activity [PRA] and aldosterone) from baseline to 72-96h and decongestion strategy; high vs. low-dose and continuous infusion vs. bolus furosemide for DOSE-AHF and UF vs. stepped pharmacologic care for CARRESS-HF. We determined the relationship between RAAS biomarkers and 60-day outcomes. Results Patients with greater RAAS activation at baseline had lower blood pressures, lower serum sodium, and higher BUN. Continuous infusion furosemide and UF were associated with greater PRA increases (median +1.66 vs. +0.66 ng/mL/h with continuous vs. bolus, P=0.021; +4.05 vs. +0.56 ng/mL/h with UF vs. stepped care, P=0.014). There was no significant difference in RAAS biomarker change with high vs. low-dose diuretics (both P>0.5). Neither baseline log PRA nor log aldosterone was associated with increased death/HF hospitalization (HR for a doubling 1.05; 95% CI: 0.98-1.13, P=0.18 and HR 1.13; 95% CI: 0.99-1.28, P=0.069, respectively). The change in RAAS biomarkers from baseline to 72-96 h was not associated with outcomes (both P>0.5). Conclusions High-dose loop diuretics did not result in greater RAAS activation than low-dose diuretics. UF resulted in greater PRA increase than stepped pharmacologic care. Neither PRA nor aldosterone was significantly associated with short-term outcomes in this cohort.

Renin extracted from hog kidney was different from that from mouse submaxillary glands in immunoreactivity and carbohydrate content. Rat kidney renin was also different from hog kidney renin in the amino acid composition. The presence of big and big-big renins was pointed out immunochemically. These big renins were considered to be precursors of kidney renin. Angiotensins in mammalian and nonmammalian species produced by renal or extrarenal renin have been differentiated by some biochemical and pharmacological criteria. Some of these angiotensins were analyzed sequentially. The replacements of amino acid residues at positions 1, 5, and/or 9 of angiotensin I have been demonstrated in nonmammalian species. Specific pressor activities have been determined using synthetic angiotensins by a 4 point assay in rat. Specific pressor activities of various angiotensins were obtained from the dose-blood pressure-response curves using a single angiotensin sample per assay rat.\n\nProrenin induces ERK activation in endothelial cells to enhance neovascularization independently of the renin-angiotensin system\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nUraoka, Maki; Ikeda, Koji, E-mail: ikedak@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp; Nakagawa, Yusuke\n\nProrenin is an enzymatically inactive precursor of renin, and its biological function in endothelial cells (ECs) is unknown despite its relevance with the incidence of diabetic microvascular complications. Recently, (pro)renin receptor was identified, and the receptor-associated prorenin system has been discovered, whereas its expression as well as function in ECs remain unclear. In the present study, we found that ECs express the (pro)renin receptor, and that prorenin provoked ERK activation through (pro)renin receptor independently of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Prorenin stimulated the proliferation, migration and tube-formation of ECs, while it inhibited endothelial apoptosis induced by serum and growth factor depletion.moreÂ Â» MEK inhibitor abrogated these proangiogenic effects of prorenin, while AT1 receptor antagonist or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor failed to block them. In vivo neovascularization in the Matrigel-plugs implanted into mouse flanks was significantly enhanced by prorenin, in which significant ERK activation was detected in ECs. Furthermore, tumor xenografts stably transfected with prorenin demonstrated the significantly accelerated growth rate concomitantly with enhanced intratumoral neovascularization. Our data demonstrated that the RAS-independent (pro)renin receptor-mediated signal transduction plays a pivotal role in the regulation of ECs function as well as in the neovascularization, and thus prorenin is potentially involved in the pathophysiology of diabetic microvascular complications as well as cancers.Â«Â less\n\nNeuron-specific (pro)renin receptor knockout prevents the development of salt-sensitive hypertension\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Wencheng; Peng, Hua; Mehaffey, Eamonn P.; Kimball, Christie D.; Grobe, Justin L.; van Gool, Jeanette M.G.; Sullivan, Michelle N.; Earley, Scott; Danser, A.H. Jan; Ichihara, Atsuhiro; Feng, Yumei\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe (pro)renin receptor, which binds both renin and prorenin, is a newly discovered component of the renin angiotensin system that is highly expressed in the central nervous system. The significance of brain PRRs in mediating local angiotensin II formation and regulating blood pressure remains unclear. The current study was performed to test the hypothesis that PRR-mediated, non-proteolytic activation of prorenin is the main source of angiotensin II in the brain. Thus, PRR knockout in the brain is expected to prevent angiotensin II formation and development of deoxycorticosterone acetate salt induced hypertension. A neuron-specific PRR (ATP6AP2) knockout mouse model was generated using the Cre-LoxP system. Physiological parameters were recorded by telemetry. (Pro)renin receptor expression, detected by immunostaining and RT-PCR, was significantly decreased in the brains of knockout compared with wide-type mice. Intracerebroventricular infusion of mouse prorenin increased blood pressure and angiotensin II formation in wild type mice. This hypertensive response was abolished in (pro)renin receptor knockout mice in association with a reduction in angiotensin II levels. Deoxycorticosterone acetate salt increased (pro)renin receptor expression and angiotensin II formation in the brains of wild-type mice, an effect that was attenuated in (pro)renin receptor knockout mice. (Pro)renin receptor knockout in neurons prevented the development of Deoxycorticosterone acetate salt-induced hypertension as well as activation of cardiac and vasomotor sympathetic tone. In conclusion, non-proteolytic activation of prorenin through binding to the PRR mediates angiotensin II formation in the brain. Neuron-specific PRR knockout prevents the development of deoxycorticosterone acetate salt-induced hypertension, possibly through diminished angiotensin II formation.

One possible mechanism may be sympathetic activation via the baroreflex. We tested the hypothesis that chronic inhibition of renin reduces BP without sympathetic activation, but diuresis augments sympathetic activity in elderly hypertensives. Fourteen patients with stage-I hypertension (66 Â± 5 (SD) years) were treated with a direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren (n= 7), or a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (n= 7), for 6 months. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), BP, direct renin and aldosterone were measured during supine and a graded head-up tilt (HUT; 5 min 30Â° and 20 min 60Â°), before and after treatment. Sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was assessed. Both groups had similar BP reductions after treatment (all P < 0.01), while MSNA responses were different between hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren (P= 0.006 pre/post Ã drug). Both supine and upright MSNA became greater after hydrochlorothiazide treatment (supine, 72 Â± 18 post vs. 64 Â± 15 bursts (100 beats)â1 pre; 60Â° HUT, 83 Â± 10 vs. 78 Â± 13 bursts (100 beats)â1; P= 0.002). After aliskiren treatment, supine MSNA remained unchanged (69 Â± 13 vs. 64 Â± 8 bursts (100 beats)â1), but upright MSNA was lower (74 Â± 15 vs. 85 Â± 10 bursts (100 beats)â1; P= 0.012 for pre/post Ã posture). Direct renin was greater after both treatments (both P < 0.05), while upright aldosterone was greater after hydrochlorothiazide only (P= 0.002). The change in upright MSNA by the treatment was correlated with the change of aldosterone (r= 0.74, P= 0.002). Upright sympathetic BRS remained unchanged after either treatment. Thus, chronic renin inhibition may reduce upright MSNA through suppressed renin activity, while diuresis may evoke sympathetic activation via the upregulated reninâangiotensinâaldosterone system, without changing intrinsic sympathetic baroreflex function in elderly hypertensive\n\nVitamin D receptor deficit induces activation of renin angiotensin system via SIRT1 modulation in podocytes.\n\nPubMed\n\nChandel, Nirupama; Ayasolla, Kamesh; Wen, Hongxiu; Lan, Xiqian; Haque, Shabirul; Saleem, Moin A; Malhotra, Ashwani; Singhal, Pravin C\n\n2017-02-01\n\nVitamin D receptor (VDR) deficient status has been shown to be associated with the activation of renin angiotensin system (RAS). We hypothesized that lack of VDR would enhance p53 expression in podocytes through down regulation of SIRT1; the former would enhance the transcription of angiotensinogen (Agt) and angiotensinogen II type 1 receptor (AT1R) leading to the activation of RAS. Renal tissues of VDR mutant (M) mice displayed increased expression of p53, Agt, renin, and AT1R. In vitro studies, VDR knockout podocytes not only displayed up regulation p53 but also displayed enhanced expression of Agt, renin and AT1R. VDR deficient podocytes also displayed an increase in mRNA expression for p53, Agt, renin, and AT1R. Interestingly, renal tissues of VDR-M as well as VDR heterozygous (h) mice displayed attenuated expression of deacetylase SIRT1. Renal tissues of VDR-M mice showed acetylation of p53 at lysine (K) 382 residues inferring that enhanced p53 expression in renal tissues could be the result of ongoing acetylation, a consequence of SIRT1 deficient state. Notably, podocytes lacking SIRT1 not only showed acetylation of p53 at lysine (K) 382 residues but also displayed enhanced p53 expression. Either silencing of SIRT1/VDR or treatment with high glucose enhanced podocyte PPAR-y expression, whereas, immunoprecipitation (IP) of their lysates with anti-retinoid X receptor (RXR) antibody revealed presence of PPAR-y. It appears that either the deficit of SIRT1 has de-repressed expression of PPAR-y or enhan"
