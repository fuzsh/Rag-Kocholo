        "text": "These clay containers, larger in size, are known throughout the Early Medieval Period in the entire eastern half of Europe. Consensus has not been reached on how they should be called in Romanian literature (the recently employed term is “platouri”) and in the older literature they were often interpreted as “portable hearths”. This explanation cannot be supported by more precise observations and is mainly contradicted by the low strength of their walls, a characteristic that excludes the possibility that they were moved. Still, this possibility cannot be entirely excluded, as sturdier items were sometimes signaled, made of more compact and better fired fabric; at times, though very rarely, they also had transversal orifices at the base. Their connection with ovens made of clay and stone is nevertheless certain, as these roasting trays have been built on top of such ovens on a wattle structure. There are numerous contexts relevant for this, mentioned in settlements dated to the second half of the sixth century and the first part of the seventh century in the southern part of Wallachian Plain where they are thus attested for the first time. During the same period they were introduced in the north-western part of Romania as well, where they were used until the ninth-tenth centuries. Like elsewhere, the contexts of discovery indicate the same connection to the ovens inside dwellings but sometimes also to hearths set in the area between the dwellings. The great majority of roasting trays are rectangular in shape, but some are also oval or circular (those in the latter category are larger and have higher walls than the clay pans per se). Over the entire territory of Romania, the maximum presence of such containers, probably mainly used for drying cereals, fruit, and vegetables, can be set during the eight-ninth centuries. The latest items known from the territory of Romania are those from settlements on the Lower Danube, dated to the eleventh-twelfth centuries."
