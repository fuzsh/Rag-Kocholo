The historian Katharine S. B. Keats-​Rohan, specializing in prosopography, states that “unlike first names, bynames (i.e., surnames) frequently have transparent semantic value. . . . A great deal of information is contained in such descriptions.”1 Linguistic and semantic features contained in names in general, and in surnames in particular, can therefore constitute a rich and interesting corpus of evidence related to and influenced by different historical phenomena such as migrations and dispersion; occupational structure; acculturation and assimilation; relations between authorities and minorities; and beliefs, aesthetics, and social fashions. I believe that the onomastic (i.e., name-​related) evidence that can be assembled from different historical and contemporary sources has the potential to provide insights into most of the above issues as well as other aspects. The present study attempts to seek and find in a large corpus of surnames the direct reflection of different aspects of social history, starting from the individual name bearer and culminating in the assembly of a significant number of names that will reflect upon the society at large. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to prove that through a careful analysis of the surnames used by the members of a historical group, the researcher can learn more about, or at least clarify, and thus better understand and/or corroborate, different sociohistorical trends and processes that characterized that specific group within a given territorial area and time span and even help to resolve disputed historical and historiographical issues. 1.

Their numbers expanded during the twentieth century, concentrating on documenting the history of the various Jewish communities and different aspects of the Jewish presence in Romania (e.g., Joseph Brociner, Eliyahu Feldman, Theodor Lavi-​Löwenstein, Itzik Schwartz-​Kara) rather than on a comprehensive historical overview (e.g., Israel Bar-​Avi). In the last decades, historians have tended to focus much of their research on specific themes such as the Middle Ages (Victor Eskenasy), the struggle for emancipation (Carol Iancu), socioeconomic aspects ( Jacob Geller, Liviu Rotman), the Holocaust ( Jean Ancel), anti-​Semitism and the post-​Communist period (Michael Shafir, Leon Volovici, Raphael Vago). Among Romanian historians, Nicolae Iorga dedicated a series of studies to the history of the Jews in Romania, and in more recent years scholars such as Dan Berindei, Constantin Giurescu, and Andrei Pippidi have begun investigating different aspects of ​Romanian Jewish history. Research on Names and Names Used by Jews Scientific interest in Jewish names began toward the end of the first half of the nineteenth century with the study published by Leopold Zunz in 1837.2 His overview of over two thousand years of ​Jewish history was intended to prove that the Jews had adopted names of foreign peoples even in very early times; this approach was seemingly used in the petition of 16 August 1838 by the Jewish community of ​ Berlin to the Prussian Ministry of the Interior in order to secure for Jews the right to use names not restricted to the Hebrew Bible.3 Since then, numerous studies, articles, and books dealing with different aspects of names in different areas and time periods have appeared (see Edwin D. Lawson’s annotated bibliographies).4 Among these are various dictionaries of ​Jewish names.5 In Romania, however, there have been only a few sporadic studies, but no 2. Zunz, Namen der Juden. 3.

Names, including Jewish names, have also been treated in other disciplines, mainly psychology6 and sociology.7 In the historical context, prosopography is the discipline investigating the common background that characterizes a historic group by means of a collective study of their lives.8 The basic elements of prosopography are individuals and their name forms, with all their associated variants, occurring in its sources. Any prosopographic study will gather a great deal of evidence that, if ​handled correctly, will provide a valuable database for interdisciplinary research. The names can be investigated by specialists, such as linguists and anthroponymists, as well as by historians, who will not be concerned with the semantics of the names as linguistic units but with the information that they provide about individuals’ identity and occupation and the society in which they lived.9 Prosopographical research proceeds by collecting and analyzing statistically relevant quantities of ​biographical data, including names, about a well-​defined group of individuals. In practice, however, it has the primary aim of ​learning about patterns of relationships and activities through the study of collective biography. Unfortunately, most historians, more interested in discovering patterns of social positions/functions or social mobility, do not follow Keats-​Rohan’s recommendation to investigate the individuals’ names for the information that they contain. Few attempts have been made until now to use the analysis of ​Jewish names or surnames documented in a specific area and period in order to ascertain the different aspects of ​Jewish history in that specific context.10 A few articles have been published in recent years on the issue of ​late official changes of ​Jewish names to non-​Jewish names and the reasons for this in the territories of ​Poland and especially Hungary.11 Nevertheless, the existing onomastic studies do not, at this stage, offer a practical methodology that can make use of ​( Jewish) surnames for the purpose of supporting or clarifying historical issues. Furthermore, practically none of these works have treated the subject of ​Jewish names or surnames in Romania. Among the vast number of ​historical studies regarding Romanian Jewry, I know of no previous attempts to apply the analysis of ​Jewish surnames as an additional, complementary research tool. of ​Jewish surnames from the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of ​Poland, Galicia, Prague, the Maghreb, Gibraltar, and Malta. 6.

Jagodzińska, “My Name”; Farkas, “Surnames of ​Foreign Origin.”\n\n4\n\nHistorical Implications of Jewish Surnames\n\nPurpose of the Present Study According to Moshe Rosman, who advocates “methodological hybridism,” the historian specializes in knowledge, mastering myriad details that are brought together to form a context that makes it possible to apply methods to and interpret a given phenomenon. Historiography does not have a particular methodology; it has particular ways of thinking and particular objectives—historicist assumptions and the questions they engender. History is an art of interpretation that uses, among other things, tools offered by the social sciences and other disciplines. There is a wide range of methods that can assist historians in their work; more and more disciplines borrow methods from other fields. Jewish history, therefore, can and should take advantage of the methodologies of other disciplines to help it find answers to its particular brand of questions.12 As a Jewish historian, Aaron Demsky recognized many years ago the importance of onomastics, that is, names and name-​giving practices, as an essential instrument for understanding the social and cultural history of the Jewish people. Following in this vein, the present study is an attempt to explore a new approach in historical research by applying onomastic tools, that is, the linguistic and semantic analysis of the surnames used by Jews, as an additional and valid research method that enables the historian to verify and/or clarify different aspects, trends, and processes within the context of the history of the Jews. Given that there are no previous comprehensive studies on the surnames used by Jews in the Old Kingdom of ​Romania (defined below), such a goal is a desideratum. The application of this historical-​onomastic research approach to provide a better understanding of its particular name patterns should contribute much to the history of ​Romanian Jewry. Given the lack of studies on the subject, this could constitute a “case study” designed to map the issue, open it for discussion, and pave the way for further studies to come. As a by-​product, this study has documented a corpus of surnames for the Jewish population in the Romanian lands for over four centuries. It is not an attempt to establish a prosopography of ​Romanian Jewry, which would be practically impossible, but rather to achieve a description of the sum of most of the Romanian and Romanized13 surnames adopted or used by Jews in these areas. The resulting dictionary of surnames is incorporated at the end of the present work. This study reviews, analyzes, and explains the surnames and naming patterns used or adopted by Romanian Jews from their earliest available historical documentation until the World War II (WWII) period in those areas where the 12. Rosman, How Jewish, 154–67. 13. The term “Romanized” will be used here, with its linguistic meaning of graphic, phonetic, and morphologic adaptation to the Roman/Latin language, referring in this particular case to the Romanian language.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nRomanian language was officially spoken. It focuses, in particular, on the types of ​R omanian and Romanized surnames that are most likely to provide evidence about Jews’ interaction with, and the measure of their adaptation to, their surroundings.\n\nScope and Limits of the Study and Style Conventions Territorial Limits As stated above, this research will focus on those Romanian lands where, for most of the time, the Romanian language was official and Romanian culture was dominant. These are the territories lying inside the historical boundaries of the former Romanian Principalities of ​Moldavia (the Carpathian Mountains to the west, the Ceremuş and Dniester Rivers to the north and east, the Black Sea and the Danube, Siret, and Neajlov Rivers to the south) and Walachia (the Carpathian Mountains and the Neajlov, Siret, and Danube Rivers to the north, the Black Sea to the east, Bulgaria and the Danube River to the south, and the Carpathian Mountains to the west). This leaves outside the scope of this study the territories to the north and west of the Carpathian Mountains collectively known as Transylvania (encompassing historical/inner Transylvania—Ardeal in Romanian—as well as Maramureş, Crişana, and Banat), where, while Romanian was widely spoken, the Jewish population adopted, at different times in its history, the German or Hungarian languages and cultures of the elite and ruling classes. The principalities of ​Moldavia and Walachia struggled to maintain their independence from the Hungarian and Polish kingdoms and the Balkan states but became vassals of the Ottoman Empire in the the fifteenth century. They succeeded in uniting in 1859 in the wake of the Crimean War and gained full independence and the retrocession of the Dobruja region in 1878, becoming what came to be known as the the “Kingdom” (Rom. Regat) of ​Romania. Following World War I (WWI), Greater Romania was established, which included all of ​Transylvania, Bukovina, and Bessarabia in addition to the core territories now called the “Old Kingdom.” The study will also include Bukovina, which was under Austrian rule from 1775 to 1918, and Bessarabia, which was part of the Russian Empire from 1812 to 1917, because these provinces were an integral part of the Principality of ​Moldavia for most of their documented history and are therefore also relevant to our analysis (map 1). Time Framework This study will try to take into account surname-​like nicknames and surnames used by Jews in the Old Kingdom territories from the sixteenth century during\n\n6\n\nHistorical Implications of Jewish Surnames\n\nan extensive four-​hundred-​year period until the end of WWII, when a large part of ​Romanian Jewry was annihilated. More exactly, the terminus ad quem is 1944, marking the end of the war in Romania, followed shortly thereafter by radical changes in Jewish life under Communist rule and the beginning of mass emigration to Israel. This specific year was chosen not only because thereafter Romanian Jewry diminished drastically in absolute numbers but also because the new conditions under the Communist regime radically changed its socioeconomic, religious, intellectual, and political composition and institutions, putting an end to its relatively free development. An example of the changes that occurred after 1944 is the phenomenon of interfaith marriages, which were fairly infrequent before WWII (4,145 according to the 1942 Jewish census)14 but greatly increased after it, significantly affecting the naming patterns, and especially the surnames pool, of ​Romanian Jews. In order to provide complementary data, this study will go beyond the above territorial and time frameworks and occasionally present surnames of Romanian-​ born Jews who had left the country in different periods for such destinations as the Land of ​Israel and North and South America. Style Conventions and Transliterations Names of personalities will be given with their official spelling in the language of origin. Names of organizations and titles of written works or newspapers will be given in the original language, followed by an English transliteration within parentheses. Quotes from Romanian sources will be given in English; the original quotes appear in footnotes. Romanian surnames that are subject to linguistic analysis will be given without quotation marks, followed by the English translation—when there is one—also within parentheses. Names of countries, regions, and geographic features will be given in English when they have a traditional English equivalent (e.g., Romania, not România, Bessarabia, not Basarabia; Dniester, not Nistru); the same is true for names of places outside Romania (Warsaw, not Warszawa) as well as for the main cities in Romania (Bucharest, not Bucureşti). Names of towns and villages in Romania, however, will be given with the Romanian spelling, including diacritics. Whenever a place-​name has a traditional English equivalent, it will be given within parentheses only at the first mention of the place in the text. Historical and other specialized terms will be explained in a glossary at the end of the study. Etymological references will be given in italics. Brackets will be used for completing lacunae. 14.

These sources have been studied by both Jewish and non-​Jewish historians. They cover the period beginning in the sixteenth century to the mid-​twentieth century, which is the chronological framework of this present study. These sources will be described in the first part of the chapter. During the last third of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth, however, different narratives developed regarding what was known and especially what was publicly said at the time about the Jewish presence in the country, giving way to fierce and endless discussions, as we shall see later in the chapter.\n\nThe Jewish Presence in Historical Moldavia and Walachia, Sixteenth Century to 1944 The territories that would become the Romanian Principalities occupied strategic locations on the main trading routes between Central Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Walachia was located between the Danubian border of the Byzantine and later Ottoman Empires and the Carpathian border of the Hungarian Kingdom and later Habsburg Empire. Moldavia was crisscrossed by the well-​ traveled “Tartar routes” linking the ports on the Black Sea along its inner rivers to Lemberg (Lwów) in the Polish Kingdom and from there to Russia, the Hanseatic ports on the Baltic Sea, and the main German trade cities. This special location on these major crossroads was an open invitation throughout history to trade activity, to successive invasions, and to waves of immigration.\n\n8\n\nHistorical Background\n\n9\n\nGrowing Jewish Presence Jewish presence in these territories is documented during the Roman conquest of ​ Dacia at the beginning of the second century CE. There is no proof of continuity of ​Jewish presence for the next millennium—general documentation is almost nonexistent for the entire period in that area. Nevertheless, some historians do assume a certain Jewish presence, considering the sporadic Khazar rule during the seventh or eighth centuries and reports of fugitive Jews fleeing persecution in the Byzantine Empire. A first wave of German-​speaking Jewish immigration was documented in Walachia following the expulsion of the Jews from Hungary in 1360 by King Louis the Great of Anjou. Allowed to take with them most of their property, many found their way to the south of the Danube, but some of them apparently remained and were later granted privileges by Prince Dan I of ​Walachia (1384–86). Another group coming to Walachia in the fifteenth century, this time from the south, was the Greek-​speaking “Romaniote” Jews from the Balkan Peninsula (Rumelia). Unfortunately, there is not much documentation on these early Jewish groups.1 In their wake, the first Spanish-​speaking Sephardic Jews came at the beginning of the sixteenth century, permanently settling along the main routes in Walachia (Turnu Măgurele–Craiova–Transylvania, Giurgiu–Bucureşti (Bucharest)–Ploieşti– Transylvania). Soon they dominated the trade between the Ottoman Empire and the Hungarian Kingdom and subsequently the Polish Kingdom. Coming from Salonika and Istanbul, they became a permanent presence in the history of ​Walachia, and later in Moldavia as well. They are often documented, in relation to both persecutions and privileges, at the time of such princes as Peter Rareş (1527–46), Peter the Lame (1579), Michael the Brave (1593), and Aron Vodă (1594). Sephardic settlements that later developed into organized communities are well documented in Bucharest and later in Craiova as well as Brăila on the Danube. Other Sephardic settlements were also reported along the trade routes of ​Moldavia in Cernăuţi (Chernovitz), Hotin, Siret, Suceava, and Cetatea Albă on the Black Sea shore. Beginning in 1589, the Jewish community in Iaşi ( Jassy) was led by Rabbi Solomon ben Aravi (or ben Aroio), the prince’s physician, who by 1619 hosted Rabbi Joseph Solomon Delmedigo from Candia. In time, however, all the Sephardic communities in Moldavia as well as that of ​Brăila were gradually assimilated into the growing Ashkenazi majority. A much later, new, significant wave of Sephardic immigration came from Serbia and Bulgaria, mostly after the economic liberalization of the principalities in 1829. This strengthened the old communities in Craiova and Bucharest and expanded the Sephardic presence to all the important trading stations, mainly along the 1. Ancel, Pinkas Hakehillot, 1:20–22.\n\n10\n\nHistorical Implications of Jewish Surnames\n\nDanube River, such as Turnu Severin, Calafat, Turnu Măgurele, Giurgiu, Călăraşi, and the town of ​Ploieşti. Old Sephardic communities also existed in Constanţa and Silistra in Dobruja that become part of the Old Kingdom in 1878 and 1913 respectively.2 At about the time of the Jewish immigration from Hungary and the Balkans to Walachia, the first Jews came to Moldavia from Poland in the north. Trading on the “Tartar routes” along the Pruth and Sereth Rivers, they established warehouses and inns in different places and started to settle permanently; by the beginning of the sixteenth century there were Ashkenazi Jewish communities in Siret, Suceava, Botoşani, and Jassy. Later, as noted, Sephardic Jews coming from Istanbul started to cross the country northwards to establish commercial missions and then communities as far as Lemberg, Zamość, and Kraków. In 1613, Prince Stephen Tomşa granted the Jews the right to pass freely through Moldavia. During the seventeenth century the number of the Jews increased significantly (communities in Târgu Neamţ, Piatra Neamţ, etc.), especially due to the influx of Yiddish-​speaking Polish Jews fleeing persecutions following Bogdan Chmielnicki’s rebellion in 1648 and the Polish-​Swedish war in 1655–60. Due to very low Moldavian population numbers (250,000 inhabitants in 1793),3 the local princes, as well as some of the rich landlords, invited immigrants of all nationalities and religions, among them Jews, granting them tax exemptions and privileges. This policy, documented under Stephen Tomşa in 1612, Gheorghe Ghica in 1615, and later Grigore II Ghica in 1741 and Constantin Mavrocordat in 1742, resulted in strong immigration of ​Polish Jews from Galicia, who settled in villages and towns along the northern border. In many instances, the Jews established new, small, semirural, semiurban province or market towns (Rom. târg or târguşor), where the local trade fair or market (Rom. târg) was held, with a majority Jewish population such as Oniţcani, at the end of the seventeenth century; Herţa, beginning of the eighteenth; Târgu Frumos, established in 1763; Fălticeni in 1779; then Mihăileni. Much later, market towns were established in Negreşti and Iveşti in 1845 and the last one, Drânceni, in 1862. As of 1843, there were still only forty towns and market towns in the whole of ​Moldavia. The Jews there practiced various trades and crafts; built inns and storehouses, mills and alcohol distilleries; rented farmlands; grew fish in ponds; tended fruit orchards; and introduced economic and industrial ways previously unknown in the region. Known as hrisoveliţi, that is, Jews whose status was based on a hrisov or charter of privileges given by the prince, they enjoyed tax exemptions in the first years. Slowly integrating, they acceded to participation in municipal town councils.4 2. Geller, Rise and Decline. 3. Xenopol, Istoria Românilor, 108, quoted in E. Schwarzfeld, Din istoria evreilor, 97. 4.

Historical Moldavia (including Bukovina and Bessarabia) and Walachia, indicating the main directions of ​Jewish immigration\n\nThis Jewish population was reinforced by immigration of ​Jews previously established in Bukovina and Bessarabia, who fled these former Moldavian provinces fearing persecution after their annexation by the Habsburg and Russian Empires in 1775 and 1812, respectively. Another significant wave of ​Jewish immigration was triggered by the introduction of the new military law and the implementation of the “cantonist” system for Jews in Czarist Russia in 1827. As a result, every period of military occupation of ​Moldavia by the Russian army (1828–34, 1848–49, and 1877–78) opened the doors for other Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution. Gradually, this Ashkenazi immigration would make its way also into Walachia, especially to its capital, Bucharest (map 2). The head of the traditional form of ​Jewish organization in the principalities was the Ottoman institution of Hakham Bashi (chief rabbi). The Hakham Bashi was the religious leader representing the Jews before the authorities and charged with tax collection (e.g., on kosher meat). The Sublime Porte appointed the first Hakham Bashi with residence in Jassy in 1719 in the person of ​(Sephardi) Rabbi Bezalel Cohen. The Hakham Bashi had jurisdiction over all the Jews in both\n\n12\n\nHistorical Implications of Jewish Surnames\n\nMoldavia and Walachia and appointed a representative in Bucharest for the Jews of ​Walachia. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, a secular organizational structure, parallel to the religious-​oriented Hakham Bashi, also appeared, called the “Jewish Guild.” It was one of the thirty-​three officially recognized guilds representing ethnic minorities (Greeks, Armenians, etc.) and professional associations. The guild was given responsibility for tax collection and the management of communal institutions such as synagogues, Talmud Torahs, cemeteries, and philanthropic activities. The guild was led by an elected Staroste (Rosh Medina in Hebrew), based in Jassy, and a deputy for Walachia in Bucharest (independent since 1822). A Staroste at each local level, together with two-​three advisors, constituted the leadership of the different communities.5 The growing numbers of ​Jewish immigrants from Austrian Galicia and Russian Bessarabia at the beginning of the nineteenth century who came to settle in the new market towns or just to flee Russian army service were not acquainted with the Ottoman-​appointed Hakham Bashi. Concentrating especially in Jassy, they were different from the Jews already rooted in the country (i.e., “native Jews”) in looks, manners, and religious practices, most of them leaning toward Hasidism. They also saw themselves as culturally superior and as such refused to pay taxes to the Hakham Bashi and sought the protection of the Austrian or Russian consuls. Through their interventions with the authorities, they undermined the position of the Hakham Bashi: Prince Alexandru Şuţu decided, in 1819, that this office would have jurisdiction only over native Jews, as opposed to foreign ones. The abolition of the institution of the Hakham Bashi, and subsequently of the Jewish Guild, gave way in 1834 to a long period without organized Jewish self-​government, leading to arbitrary interventions by the Romanian authorities at all levels. Another conflict, stressing the internal divisions in the Jewish population, developed around the establishment in 1856 of the Templul Coral, a modern synagogue, in Bucharest. Promoted by Iuliu Barasch, leader of the Mendelssohnian Haskalah, and a group of modern native Jews together with Jews of Austrian and Prussian origin, it met the fierce opposition of ​R abbi Meir Löb ben Jechiel Michel Weiser (Malbim), representing the Hasidic trend. It proved that native and foreign-​born Jews could eventually work together on the condition that the latter renounce the special status in religious matters conferred by foreign consul protection. Yet the conflict defined other lines of division, such as that between Maskilim and Hasidim as well as between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. As a result, in 1864, Malbim’s tenure was terminated; the Romanian state had already ceased all funding of ​Jewish institutions in 1862.6 5. M. Schwarzfeld, Momente din istoria, 26–29. 6. Ancel, Pinkas Hakehillot, 1:25–26.\n\nHistorical Background\n\n13\n\nPersecution The attitude of the Romanian authorities toward Jews over the centuries was ambivalent, to say the least. Latent Christian religion–based, grassroots anti-​ Semitism was reflected and made extreme in laws promulgated by princes Matei Basarab in Walachia in 1640 and Vasile Lupu in Moldavia in 1646, defining Jews as heretics and prohibiting relations between Christians and Jews. Under Alexandru Mavrocordat (1782–92), many Jews living in the villages were expelled, most of them seeking refuge in the city of ​Jassy. In 1817 and 1818, respectively, Ioan Gheorghe Caragea in Walachia and Scarlat Calimachi in Moldavia granted civil rights to foreigners of all religions; but restrictions remained, especially for Jews: no landownership in villages, no aristocratic status (boyars), and no interfaith marriages. The introduction of the Organic Regulations in 1831–32, under the Russian occupation of ​Moldavia and Walachia during 1828–34, brought a Russian-​style anti-​Semitic influence: paragraph 379 stipulated that Jews were not entitled to civil rights and could practice only trade. In Moldavia, paragraph 94 stipulated that “vagrant” Jews were to be expelled. A legal codex compiled by Andronache Donici stated that Jews could not buy land in villages and could not give testimony in court. Under Mihail Sturdza, in Moldavia, 1839, immigration was to be stopped, Jews were limited to “productive professions,” and “vagrants” were to be expelled. At about the same time, the familiar clichés of the Romanian anti-​Semites were coined: “Jewish invasion,” “Jewish exploitation of national resources” (especially in the villages), “Jewish vagrants” (all those not practicing “productive professions”).7 The national revolutions of 1848 brought new hopes of integration for the Jews in Europe. The revolutionary proclamation in Moldavia promised civil rights to all, irrespective of religion; that of ​Walachia, dated November 6, 1848, stipulated equal rights for Jews (“Israelites”), except for buying land in the villages and aristocratic status (paragraph 21). Many Jews participated in the revolutionary events, among them Lăzărică Zaraful, Daniel Rosenthal, Barbu Iscovescu, and, most important, Davicion Bally, the Sephardic banker who financed the endeavor in Walachia.8 The Congress of ​Paris in 1856 initiated a long series of political pressures by the foreign powers to extend equal rights also to Jews, but to no avail. Instead, there were attempts by the Ministry of the Interior to expel the Jews from the villages. In 1864, nevertheless, Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza succeeded, in his Civil Code, in granting to Jews the right to vote in local elections (civil rights conditioned on military service or high school or academic degrees or industrial ownership). However, this involved no political rights. 7. Gyémánt and Benjamin, Izvoare şi mărturii, 3, part 1, 63–65. 8. Kaufmann, Evrei luptători.\n\n14\n\nHistorical Implications of Jewish Surnames\n\nThe Constitution of 1866, which allowed Romanian citizenship to Christians only, opened an era of persecutions: repeated expulsions of ​“vagrants” and of ​Jews from the villages (1867–68, 1869–72) and the limitation of liquor-​selling permits, 1873. Despite the large Jewish participation in the Romanian War of ​Independence in 1877–78, the Congress of ​Berlin and subsequent pressure in favor of the Jews were followed by more expulsions and the exclusion of ​Jews from the newly established state monopolies over liquor and tobacco production and trade. A constitutional amendment of 1879 granting rights of citizenship to Jews on a personal basis through parliamentary law (!) was followed by further expulsions of foreign Jews in 1885. This policy was halted by the High Court in 1895, but resumed at the time of the peasants’ revolt of 1907, casting blame on “Jewish exploiters.”9 The 1914 Law concerning foreign control gave the government full powers against foreign Jews. The upsurge of anti-​Semitism in Romania in the last third of the nineteenth century has been explained in socioeconomic terms: although politically independent (1878), Romania was characterized by semifeudal conditions and a grave agrarian problem. Instead of striving for modernity together with the Jewish urban strata, the emerging Romanian bourgeoisie, once in power, preferred to achieve social status by acquiring vineyards and farmland. This resulted in creating a new agrarian class that replaced the decadent boyars. They had no incentive to develop an industrial sector that would deprive them of a cheap labor force.10 The most important philosophic and literary Romanian movements embraced this agrarian vision. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Junimea (Youth) movement, supported by Conservative Party circles (Titu Maiorescu, Petre Carp), thought that modern political systems were not fit for Romanian society and instead developed a national mystique of the Romanian peasant, as expressed by the poet Mihai Eminescu, that bordered on xenophobia. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Semănătorul (Sower) magazine (Nicolae Iorga) opposed social changes while idealizing and advocating a return to the past. The Poporanism movement (Constantin Stere) was against development of capitalism and for the improvement of the peasants’ conditions as the sociopolitical basis of ​Romanian society. Both were opposed to “bourgeois civilization” (urbanism, technology), claiming that the Romanian soul was alien to industrial work (poets Octavian Goga, Lucian Blaga).11 Socialist circles viewed the Jewish problem with indifference, seeing it mainly in terms of class struggle. Nevertheless, the Social Democrats’ congress of 1910 called for equality of rights for the Jews. 9. Iancu, Jews in Romania, 128–52. 10. Ancel, Pinkas Hakehillot, 1:40–41. 11. Volovici, Ideologia naţionalistă, 50–64.\n\nHistorical Background\n\n15\n\nJewish sociologist Ştefan Antim (1879–1944) argued that because the Jews were first invited by landowners to delay the development of an indigenous Romanian bourgeoisie, they thus had a pioneering role. But they were isolated as foreigners and not permitted to participate in the country’s internal political life. When the Jews started to demand political rights, they were declared a national hazard. To have total control over the peasants, landowners came out against Jewish settlement in the villages. The emerging middle class, including those in public positions and the state bureaucracy, saw an interest in derogating and excluding/ keeping out the Jews, and also had the power to do so.12 A pervasive climate of ​hostility toward Jews was created, echoed by the Junimea intellectual movement: all evils in Romania were the fault of the “Jewish invasion” and “Jewish proliferation”—Romania would become the “New Palestine.”13 The Jews, with their different clothes and bizarre customs, were deemed alien to any other culture and therefore could not assimilate. An “Anti-​Jewish League” called in 1887 for outright emigration. A new wave of expulsions of ​Jews from the villages was conducted between the years 1881 and 1884: the Jews living in villages in the district of ​Dorohoi, for example, representing 40.6% of all Jews in the district, were forced to move to the town of ​Dorohoi, doubling the town’s population.14 A law prohibiting the activity of peddlers, a traditional Jewish profession, was promulgated in 1884. Another law, from 1893, sanctioned the expulsion of ​Jewish children from all state-​sponsored schools. The peasants’ revolt of 1907 was the pretext for renewed expulsions of ​ Jews from the villages in 1907–8; after this date, relatively few Jews remained in the villages of ​Moldavia, many having migrated to Bukovina. The most immediate reaction of the Jewish population to these conditions, aggravated by the economic crisis caused by drought in 1900, was mass emigration: between 1881 and 1914 over 100,000 Jews left Romania, including about 62,000 for the United States, 30,000 for the United Kingdom, and 3,000 for the Land of ​Israel. Exact figures are reported for the period 1889–1915: 69,855 persons, that is, 22.5% of the entire Jewish population of the country. The period of maximum emigration was 1900–1907, when 50,000 Jews emigrated, peaking in 1900 at 16,687 persons. Called the “emigrants on foot” (fussgeyer in Yiddish), tens of thousands of ​Jews crossed Romania and Europe on their way to America via Hamburg; most were craftsmen out of work as a result of official restrictions.15\n\n12.

Wischnitzer, To Dwell in Safety, 83–85; Rotman, Iancu, and Vago, History of the Jews, 2:137.\n\n16\n\nHistorical Implications of Jewish Surnames\n\nPolitical Activity On another level, many Romanian Jews, especially the native born, whose families had been there for many generations, started to organize in order to struggle for equal rights and emancipation. Jews who had served in the Romanian army organized for the first time in Săveni, Moldavia, opening the way for the Asociaţia generală a israeliţilor pămînteni (General Association of ​Native Jews, AGIP), formed in Bucharest in 1890, professing devotion to the fatherland, fraternity with non-​Jews, and equal rights. Publishing the weekly Emanciparea (Emancipation), the AGIP was active through 1897 and then again in 1903–4, demanding Romanian citizenship for all Jews born in the country. Ideologically, it distanced itself from the foreign Jews, the organized community, and to some extent from Jewish tradition (e.g., accepting mixed marriages, baptisms) and thus was an important stimulus for Jewish intellectual circles to embrace Romanian culture and language (e.g., Max Wechsler, Lazăr Şăineanu, Dr. Hariton Tiktin). The AGIP was opposed to, and attacked by, the incipient Zionist circles, and argued that aliyah was only good for the foreign Jews; despite plans for emigration that had originally been proposed by U.S. consul Benjamin F. Peixotto in 1872, most Romanian Jews decided to stay and struggle for their rights in Romania.16 Jews active in the socialist circle Lumina (Light) called, in 1895, for political rights for all Jews; some of them were even expelled from the country for their activity (B. Brănişteanu, S. Petrianu). Others, such as Dr. Ştefan Stein-​Stâncă, publisher of Asimilarea (Assimilation), went against the Jewish community, claiming it prevented total assimilation. Other assimilatory circles around the newspaper Fraternitatea (Fraternity) railed against Zionists, stressing that a show of nationalist feelings and attracting international attention to anti-​Jewish persecution and attitudes because of emigration would prevent the granting of equal rights. Proposals were made toward assimilation (mixed marriages) and public display of patriotism. Another direction was the attempt to consolidate local Jewish life through the Înfrăţirea Sion (Sion Fraternity) association, by reducing tensions between Sephardim and Ashkenazim, opposing emigration, and demanding rights. After the expulsion of ​Elias Schwarzfeld in 1885, it became part of ​B’nai B’rith in 1888, helping prepare a generation of new leaders, lawyers, physicians, and intellectuals, most of them half assimilated. Zionist activity in Romania started relatively early on. The first attempts at organized aliyah were made in 1880, mostly by foreign Jews affected by professional restrictions and expulsions. Some years before the First Zionist Congress in Basel (1897), a congress for Settlement of the Land of ​Israel was convened in Focşani 16. Wischnitzer, To Dwell in Safety, 25; Iancu, Jews in Romania, 61–67.\n\nHistorical Background\n\n17\n\nin 1882, where representatives of the different communities listed the preferred candidates for aliyah: village dwellers, stonecutters, blacksmiths, copper workers, masons, carpenters, shoemakers, tailors, and saddlers. Representatives of native Jews, B’nai B’rith, and the Lumina circle established the Asociaţia Evreilor Pământeni (Association of ​Native Jews) in Bucharest in 1911, to strive for equal rights and against persecution. Made up mostly of intellectuals (e.g., A. Stern, B. Brociner) and some middle-​class Jews, it was active through 1948, advocating moderate assimilation and closeness between Jewish and Romanian citizens while stimulating Jewish participation in professional organizations against discrimination. Later called the Uniunea Evreilor Pământeni (Union of ​ Native Jews), it represented the interests of the entire Jewish population in the Old Kingdom who had adopted the Romanian language; it published the weekly Înfrăţirea (Fraternity), and its legal bureau assisted multitudes, boosting adherence to this political organization. After WWI and the establishment of Greater Romania, the Union became the Uniunea Evreilor Români (Union of ​Romanian Jews) in 1923, to include Jews from the other provinces as well.17 Assimilatory circles regrouped around the Asociaţia Evreilor Români (Association of ​Romanian Jews), established by Jews who had served in the military, who attacked the Union for struggling for general emancipation and the Zionists as unpatriotic and rootless. In the newspaper Viaţa Românească (Romanian life, edited by S. Muncel), they argued that the Jews were not a people with a culture of their own and that the Romanian state could not accept the existence of a nation within the nation. The assimilation trend was stalled, however, by the local anti-​ Semitism and the belief that assimilation of the Jews would lead to the destruction of ​Romanian culture and to race war. The nationalist trend attracted many young intellectuals, especially from the new provinces. Zionist intellectuals in the Old Kingdom grouped around the Romanian language daily Mântuirea (Salvation, edited by A. L. Zissu), advocating cultural, political, and economic rights for Jews as a national minority, thus appealing to the masses. They promoted the study of ​Jewish history and the Hebrew language. Organizations of ​Zionist women and high school students were established, as well as a student organization, Hashmonia, followed by youth movements and the sports club Macabi. A Jewish party was first established in the Old Kingdom in 1930, and then transformed into the Partidul Evreiesc din România ( Jewish Party in Romania) in 1931 to include the provinces. It obtained 64,193 votes and five representatives in the parliament. Unfortunately, it was banned together with all political parties in 1938. The Union of ​Romanian Jews and the Zionist organizations continued their activities outside parliamentarian life.18 17. Mendelsohn, Jews of ​East, 189–90. 18. Ancel, Pinkas Hakehillot, 1:221–24.\n\n18\n\nHistorical Implications of Jewish Surnames\n\nCultural Life A significant Jewish cultural life developed in the Old Kingdom, growing significantly in the eighteenth century, with the arrival of ​learned rabbis, many of them Hasidic, from Galicia (“Hakhmei Jassy,” “Hakhmei Bucharest”). The first Hebrew secular literature in the principalities was an extension of the Galician Haskalah at the beginning of the second half of the nineteenth century. Intellectuals such as Hillel Kahane called upon Jews to adopt local dress, to be patriotic, and to strive for their rights. A second generation was marked by the rise of mostly Romanian-​born intellectuals writing in Hebrew, Yiddish, German, and later Romanian. Yiddish usage, especially in the market towns of ​Moldavia, was reinforced by waves of immigration and close relations with Galicia and Russia. The Mendelssohnian trend, spearheaded by Iuliu Barasch, called for modernization of ​Jewish life. It promoted Hebrew but also helped spread German culture and language, as many Jewish lawyers, physicians, and researchers went to study in Germany and Austria. At the same time, the Romanian elites spoke French, while Romanian literature was gradually maturing. The development of ​Jewish journalism shows how slowly but surely the transition to Romanian progressed: the Israelitul Român (Romanian Israelite, edited by Iuliu Barasch), 1857, was published in Romanian and French and Timpul (Times, edited by N. Poper), 1859, in Romanian and Yiddish. The first Romanian-​only newspaper, Vocea Apărătorului (Defender’s voice), appeared in 1872, in Focşani. The first newspaper to last more than just a few issues (1879– 1885) was Fraternitatea (edited by I. Auerbach and Elias Schwarzfeld). It struggled against anti-​Semitism, advocated assimilation, and was not sympathetic to aliyah. The weekly Egalitatea (Equality, edited by Moses Schwarzfeld), 1890–1940, was supportive of ​Zionism, and in 1910 it endorsed the Union of ​Native Jews. Another long-​lasting newspaper was Curierul Israelit (Israelite courier, edited by M. Schweig), 1906–48. An array of other publications supported Zionist ideas. By the end of the nineteenth century, Romanian Jews were excelling in poetry: Avram Axelrad, Dumitru Iacobescu, Barbu Nemţeanu, and Felix Aderca; in theater: Moise Ronetti Roman; in literary criticism: Henric Sanielevici and Ion Trivale; in translation: Alexandru Toma; in linguistics: Moses Gaster, Heyman Tiktin, and Lazăr Şăineanu; in historiography: Iacob Psantir and Moses Schwarzfeld; in medicine: Iuliu Barasch; in sociology: Ştefan Antim; in mathematics: David Emmanuel; in mineralogy: D. Roman; and so on. Literary critic George Călinescu noted that Jews were among the first philologists and linguists of the Romanian language.19 After WWI, rabbinical works and Hebrew literature were less important. The bulk of ​Yiddish literature and especially journalism was produced in Bukovina and Bessarabia. Romanian became the dominant language, introduced in 1890 in 19. Călinescu, Istoria literaturii, 976, quoted in Cajal and Kuller, Contribuția evreilor, 21–22.\n\nHistorical Background\n\n19\n\nall schools. Several Hebrew-​language schools nurtured aspirations for an original Jewish culture and opposed the trend toward assimilation. Jews began to make significant contributions to Romanian modern sciences (philology, linguistics, historiography, philosophy, sociology, medicine, mathematics, mineralogy) and literature (poetry, literary criticism, translations) at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries, but only a few Romanian intellectuals, such as acclaimed literary critics Eugen Lovinescu and George Călinescu, were willing to recognize their value.20 Romanian Jewry practically ended abruptly with the extermination of almost half of its members during the Shoah (1941–44) and the subsequent mass emigration of those remaining, mostly to Israel, after 1948. Only a few thousand are still living today in Romania. Demographic Changes Demographic data regarding Jews in the Romanian Principalities before the nineteenth century are scant and inaccurate. Official reports in Moldavia document about 3,100 Jewish taxpayers in 1803 (about 2% of the general population) and around 20,000 persons in 1820. The first official census, held in 1859 at the time of the unification of ​Moldavia and Walachia and reputedly not exact, reported 135,000 Jews, or 3% of the total population. These included some 37,500 Jewish immigrants arriving between the years 1812 and 17 from Bessarabia, after the Russian Empire annexed that province. The first systematic census, that of 1899, gave a Jewish population of 266,652, or 4.5% of the total population. Subsequent censuses registered lower numbers of ​Jews: 245,064 in 1910 and 239,967 in 1912 (3.3%), owing to massive emigration following anti-​Semitic persecutions.21 The reference census of Greater Romania is that of 1930, giving demographic data on the Old Kingdom and all the other provinces included after WWI: 728,115 Jews according to ethnicity (4% of the total population) and 756,930 according to religion (4.2%); 518,754 Jews were registered as having Yiddish as their mother tongue (68.5% of those professing Judaism). Out of these in the Old Kingdom were 252,066 Jews according to ethnicity (2.81%) and 264,038 according to religion (2.94%). Only 131,913 of them (49.9%) spoke Yiddish. The figures (according to religion) were 207,000 for Bessarabia and 93,000 for Bukovina.22 Two indicators are of importance here: one is the difference between religion and ethnicity—it seems that 4.6% of the Jews preserved their religious 20.

The number is higher in Muntenia Province (8.2%), evidence of an assimilation process. This percentage is much larger than in Bessarabia or Bukovina (0.7% in each province!) but smaller than in most of ​Transylvania (average of 6.3%; 3.4% in central Transylvania but almost 20% in Banat). The second indicator is even more significant: 51.1% of the Jews in the Old Kingdom spoke not Yiddish but Romanian. The internal breakdown is even more telling: 67.9% of the Jews in Moldavia spoke Yiddish compared to 21% in Walachia. In all the other provinces, the percentage of ​Yiddish speakers was significantly higher: 60% in Transylvania (except for Banat—5.4%), 79.8% in Bukovina, and 97.8% in Bessarabia. It is obvious, therefore, that the Jewish population in the Old Kingdom, and especially in Walachia, had undergone significant linguistic acculturation. According to the 1930 census, the clear majority of the Jewish population in Walachia resided in urban areas (98.4%), compared to 86.1% in Moldavia. Jews represented a moderate 8.4% of the total urban population of ​Walachia, but a significant 23.6% of that of ​Moldavia. For comparison, the percentage of the Jewish population living in urban areas in Bukovina was 73.9% and was only 48% in Bessarabia, representing nevertheless 30.2% and 26.8% respectively of the total urban population. These data also point to the fact that a sizable part of the Jewish population—52% in Bessarabia, 26% in Bukovina, and 14% in Moldavia—still lived in rural areas in the first third of the twentieth century. The much smaller percentages in Moldavia, as well as in Walachia, reflect the results of a systematic policy of expulsion of ​Jews from rural areas initiated by the Romanian authorities in 1881.\n\nDifferent and Divergent Historical Narratives The Jewish presence in the Old Kingdom, although a well-​established fact, has, unfortunately, been the subject of two divergent trends of interpretations and endless political discussions centered on what has been labeled the “Jewish problem.” This has inevitably been expressed in a set of different and conflicting narratives on the history of ​Romanian Jewry. On the one hand, Romanian scholarship has almost completely glossed over the early settlement of the Jews in the area, either out of sheer ignorance of the facts or because of vested interests or a political agenda, resulting in a distorted image of ​Jews in Romania. On the other hand, Jewish scholars and publicists tend to bring to light and stress the antiquity and richness of ​Jewish life and its contribution to Romania. The process of creating a Romanian national consciousness began, according to most specialists, in the eighteenth century under the influence of the\n\nHistorical Background\n\n21\n\nEnlightenment and Western culture. It was the intelligentsia, taking the lead in the 1848 Revolutions, that gave a romantic aura to the emerging nationalist doctrine. Within the context of constant existential threats from all too powerful neighbors—the Ottoman, Habsburg, and Russian Empires—the idea of nationhood acquired the force of myth, centered on national unity and sovereignty while also nourishing feelings of xenophobia—directed toward both outside forces as well as identifiable internal ethnic elements. In other words, the national Romanian ideology was founded on an autochthonic cult and values aiming at defining and preserving the specific national character by stressing Românism, characterized by both ethnicity and religious orthodoxy. The fear of strangers and external threats was strengthened by the conservative nature of a community averse to change and innovations based on foreign models and suffering from an inferiority complex. The social structure of ​ Romania as of the mid-​nineteenth century was preponderantly rural and patriarchal, and Romanian culture was based on and oriented toward the traditional, popular values of the “village.” Since the peasant, with his spiritual and ethical values, was seen as the quintessential Romanian, the national doctrine developed the opposing negative image of the menacing foreigner: the “Turk,” the “Pole,” the “Hungarian” (in Transylvania), and the “Russian.” The negative model of the internal alien would be, for a time, the “Greek” and—consistently—the “Jew.” Greeks who came to the Romanian lands under the protection of the Phanariot rulers stemmed from aristocratic Greek families that originated in Constantinople and ruled Moldavia and Walachia during the eighteenth century. They occupied many important state functions, dominated trade, and influenced the culture of the elites. Within a century and a half, however, the “Greek problem” was solved through assimilation (facilitated by their being Christian Orthodox), leaving behind a “Phanariot myth” that symbolized the social and moral degradation of the nation. In time, though, even the Phanariot myth was superseded by that of the “Jewish danger” in public consciousness and in nationalist doctrines.23 The internal alien, whether Greek or Jew, which had “infiltrated” Romanian economic and social life and represented a large part of the middle class, became a constant problem in Romanian political ideology. The Jew came to represent the prototype of the foreigner, both internally because he did not wish to assimilate and externally because of ​his links with fellow Jews in other countries, which were conveniently amplified into a “world conspiracy.” By the mid-​nineteenth century, the so-​called Jewish problem in Romania was enhanced by early political anti-​Semitism appearing in Europe. However, it was not triggered directly by the growth of the Jewish population (from 3% of the general population in 1859 to 4.5% in 1899), although the few waves of immigration from 23. Volovici, Ideologia naţionalistă, 26.\n\n22\n\nHistorical Implications of Jewish Surnames\n\nGalicia and Russia were exaggerated as a “Jewish invasion.” Instead, the “problem” really appeared with the formation of the united Romanian state, when the status of the Jews, who were considered perennial foreigners, and their emancipation were called into question and became a condition for recognizing Romania’s sovereignty by the European powers. The response of the Romanian political and intellectual classes was point-​blank refusal, translated into sheer hostility toward the Jews. Among the prominent opponents were Mihail Kogălniceanu, Ion Heliade-​ Rădulescu, Cezar Bolliac, Constantin Negruzzi, Vasile Alecsandri, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Vasile Conta, and Mihai Eminescu. These major figures, who had once spearheaded the 1848 Revolutions in Moldavia and Walachia with their advocacy of equal rights for all, now played a major role in the development of the new Romanian political, social, and cultural ethos.24 Anti-​Jewish attitudes, especially but not exclusively, permeated the middle and upper classes and the intellectual strata. This is how Bogdan P. Hasdeu, at the end of the nineteenth century, summed up the opinions of the Romanian peasants as conveyed to him by village teachers, “Foreigners passing through a village, if they are Christians, are welcomed by the peasants, who give them food and comfort. . . . The Jews are perceived by the people as individuals alien to the nation, to the religion, having the ugliest characteristics.”25 The rejection of foreign intervention on behalf of rights for Jews resuscitated all the medieval prejudices against the Jews and also encouraged new accusations peculiar to the modern anti-​Semitism current in Austria, Germany, and France. The “Jewish problem,” on the other hand, was associated internally with the “agrarian problem” central to Romanian economy and politics: the Jews were to blame for the penetration of capitalist ways within the country and their inevitable destructive effect on the old (feudal) structures. As in Russia and Poland, the mere presence of ​Jewish lessees and tavern keepers in the villages was considered the only and obvious cause for the degradation and pauperism of the Romanian peasant. Thus, the “Jewish problem” became a “vital” question in Romania, a central theme of the debates and discussions on the social and economic state of the country. The historian and politician Mihail Kogălniceanu said as much: “I tell you, Sirs, that no issue is more important for Moldavia than that of the Israelites.”26 More than half a century later, Emil Cioran would note in the same vein, “The 24. Ibid., 28. 25. “Străinii ce trec prin sat, dacă îs creştini, sînt bine priviţi de săteni, ospătîndu-​i şi îngrijindu-i. . . . Evreii sînt priviţi de popor ca nişte indivizi străini de naţie, [de] religie şi cu calităţile cele mai urîte.” Oişteanu, Imaginea evreului, 31. 26. “Vă spun, domnilor, că nu este nici o cestiune mare pentru Moldova decît cestiunea israeliţilor.” Mihail Kogălniceanu, Cestiunea israelită înaintea Adunarei generale a României din 1864 (Bucharest, 1879), 19, quoted in Volovici, Ideologia naţionalistă, 29.\n\nHistorical Background\n\n23\n\nJudaic invasion in the past decades of ​Romania’s development has made anti-​ Semitism the essential feature of our nationalism.”27 The specter of the emancipation of the Jews, therefore, was equated with putting the Romanian economy, and in fact the whole country, at the mercy of the Jews. A whole series of stereotyped characteristics of ​“the Jew” was paraded as fearful warnings for the future. The press and literature participated intensively, from the beginning, in the crystallization and consolidation of the anti-​Semitic stereotype on the cultural level. Strengthened by the writings of prestigious intellectuals, it acquired an “illustrious” pedigree and became part and parcel of the national culture. The ultimate clichéd image of the Jew was created by Vasile Alecsandri, the most important and popular writer in the last third of the nineteenth century and father of the “Polish Jew” (Ostjude) stereotype in Romanian literature. The sidelocks and long black gabardine–wearing Jew, mumbling in a half-​Yiddish Romanian jargon, a greedy swindler devoid of any scruples, a usurer, exploiter, and poisoner (i.e., purveyor of alcohol) of the Romanian peasant, was to become the prototypical image of the Jew caricatured in Alecsandri’s popular play Lipitorile satelor (The village leeches).28 Another staunch opponent of the emancipation of the Jews was the poet Mihai Eminescu, who participated vociferously in the press debates in the years 1876 to 1879. Written at the beginning of ​his literary career, his articles on the “Jewish problem” had no special significance at the time, but after his death, when he achieved the status of a national poet endowed with a mythical aura, his nationalist ideology and attitude toward the Jews had an overwhelming influence on the orientation of the nationalist and anti-​Semitic currents that proudly claimed him as their forerunner. Around 1870, Eminescu studied in Vienna—a focus of modern European anti-​Semitism—and was close to German Romanticism, which emphasized the “national spirit,” looking to the past and predisposed to xenophobia. In Romanian society, he wrote, the impoverishment and degradation of the peasant class, the only “productive” one, was provoked by the capitalist economy, which promoted a new bourgeois class composed mostly of foreigners that suppressed, through fierce competition, the development of a native middle class. The Greeks and especially the Jews constituted a superposed parasitic stratum exploiting the peasants’ work. National economic protectionism was not directed against Jews as such but against the nature of their economic occupations; religious tolerance did not imply also rights because, says Eminescu, “the Jew deserves no rights anywhere in Europe, because he does not work. . . . He is forever consumer, never producer.”29 27. Cioran, Schimbarea la faţă, 128–34, quoted in Ornea, Romanian, 376. 28. Călinescu, Istoria literaturii, 315. 29. “Evreul nu merită drepturi nicăiri în Europa, pentru că nu munceşte. . . . El e vecinic consumător, niciodată producător.” Eminescu, Opere, 9:301.\n\n24\n\nHistorical Implications of Jewish Surnames\n\nIn the poet’s nationalist vision, economic conflicts exacerbate the imperative for national preservation—the penetration of the Jewish element into the Romanian economy morphs into an ethnic danger: “The danger resides in that they are not Romanians—they cannot be Romanians, as they are not and cannot, as a rule, be Germans, English, French, Italians”30 (emphasis in original). In Eminescu’s writings, the negative image of the foreigner as a danger achieves apocalyptic dimensions (see his Doină, a lyric poem specific to Romanian folklore); moreover, among the foreigners—even those settled for centuries in the land—the Jew is the most estranged from the national body: “foreigners of non-​Christian denomination, who cannot melt into our people.”31 He makes no distinction, in general, between the recent immigrants from Galicia or Russia and the Jews living in the Romanian lands for many centuries—all are alike under the same label, venetic (alien). Prominent philologist and writer Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu also put on display what he called the “negative qualities” of the Jew: “parasitism, dishonesty and hostility toward all other peoples.”32 In 1870, Hasdeu established a cultural society called “Românismul.” In time, the term românism, anchored in ethnicity, tradition, and religion, took on strong xenophobic and anti-​Semitic connotations, especially opposed to the “Jewish spirit,” and became central to the nationalist sociological and philosophical writings in the 1930s. A significant impact at the time was the position of philosopher and parliamentarian Vasile Conta, who proposed a scientific argument for the discrimination of the Jews that was based on the principle of the unity of race and religion as the definition of a homogenous nation. Assimilation was deemed impossible: “The kikes constitute a nation distinct from all others and are their enemies.”33 Accusing the Jews of aiming to disenfranchise the Romanians and establish a Jewish state in the country, Conta warned about “domination of the whole world by the kikes” and exhorted in the lower chamber of the parliament, “If we do not combat the Jewish element, we die as a nation.”34 Following WWI, different currents of ideological anti-​Semitism proliferated, which eventually served as a basis for an array of right-​wing political parties that overtly or even purposely promoted the struggle against the alleged “Jewish danger.” When the emancipation of the Jews became a fact (1919, 1923), the old idea of the Jews’ refusal to assimilate was replaced by another echoing the fear that the 30. “Pericolul . . .

One of the most prolific ideologues cum politicians in this arena was Alexandru C. Cuza (1857–1947), professor of political economy and finance at the University of ​Jassy. For him, the Jews represented foremost an ethnic threat. “Foreign by race,” they are presented in his works as unable to assimilate. Their presence is perceived as a mortal danger: “it is no longer about a transitory invasion, but a real conquest, a life and death struggle between two different ethnicities.”35 The high percentage of ​Jews among the urban population and in the different occupations justified, in his view, a protectionist policy that required the “Romanization” of the middle class through the gradual elimination of the Jews.36 A. C. Cuza was one of the most fervent proponents of numerus clausus in the universities as a “a phase of transition toward the last phase, the only logical and therefore definitive one: numerus nullus.”37 At a later stage, in his attempts to popularize his brand of anti-​Semitism, Cuza began to appreciate the power of older theological arguments as well. Articles published in his newspaper Apărarea Naţională (National defense) are heavy with mystical stereotypes and reproductions of blood-​libel stories through the ages. In its pages, Cuza laid the foundations for what he called the “science of anti-​Semitism,” focused on Judaism as a social problem. Under the name of Cuzism in the 1930s, this “science” proposed to withhold political rights and the status of ​“native” that had been granted to the Jews, stating that “the only possible solution of the kike problem is the elimination of the kikes.”38 A close collaborator of Cuza was Nicolae C. Paulescu, professor of physiology at the Faculty of ​Medicine in Bucharest. He cultivated mainly the religious aspect of ​Romanian anti-​Semitism but also tried to find medical and psycho-​pathological arguments, focusing on the “domination” and “property” instincts that allegedly were characteristic of ​Jews. His obsessive preoccupation with the Jewish conspiracy for world domination through the Talmud as doctrine and the Cahal as organization led him to an extreme solution: “Could we exterminate them—as simply as one kills bedbugs, for example? This would be the most convenient way to get rid of them quickly.”39 35. “Strain ca rasă”; “nu mai este vorba de o invazie trecătoare, ci de o adevarată cucerire, de o luptă pe viaţă şi pe moarte între două neamuri deosebite.” Alexandru C.

Iorga, the propagator of the idea of the “Romanian soul” in culture and the arts, wrote prolifically on Romanian civilization and history. Like Eminescu’s, Iorga’s nationalist ideology had a mystical base rooted in traditional rural values, opposition to modernization, and different degrees of xenophobia. During a long phase of political collaboration with A. C. Cuza from 1910 to 1922, Iorga was concerned with the alleged economic domination by the Jews and its destructive effects on the Romanian peasantry. The large number of ​Jews in old Moldavian towns such as Jassy and Suceava was perceived as an “invasion” and the presence of a strong Jewish middle class as a degradation of the national spirit exemplified by the native population.40 A feeling of danger gave his nationalist xenophobic discourse a heavy emotional charge: “an invasive nation. . . . Even in the liberal professions, even in education, sciences, literature, as lawyers, physicians, architects, professors, more and more, with their philologists, philosophers, journalists, poets, with their critics, they are literally throwing us out of our country . . . occupying our places and, even more deadly, falsifying our soul, degrading our morality with their charming journalistic and literary opium.”41 Iorga, however, was no fanatic. At another stage, his style became more conciliatory, European in spirit, rejecting violence and advancing constructive solutions. He acknowledged that the Jews had their own history in Romania—which he studied—and had contributed to Romanian culture. Nonetheless, they were foreigners and therefore dangerous for the Romanian nation because of their numbers and socioeconomic clout. He saw an imperative necessity in replacing the Jews, gradually and “peacefully,” in the important sectors of the country’s social life, with Romanian ethnic elements able to take their place. He favorably viewed redirecting Jews toward other types of occupations, such as farming. Iorga’s cultural and literary influence was felt through his multiple political activities, among them the popular university that he created at his residence in Vălenii de Munte. The juxtaposition of ​his program to promote Romanian spiritual values with the struggle against the “Jewish danger” gave anti-​Semitic discourse a legitimacy and sense of patriotic mission it had lacked before. His thinking changed, however, and in 1922–23 Iorga rejected the numerus clausus claim as an absurdity. In the context of the anti-​Semitic agitations of the period, Iorga 40. Nicolae Iorga, Sămănatorul, 10 November 1904, quoted in Volovici, Ideologia naţionalistă, 53. 41. “Naţie năvălitoare. . . . Pînă şi în profesiunile libere, pînă şi în învăţămînt, în ştiinţă, în literatură, ca avocaţi, ca medici, ca arhitecţi, ca profesori, tot mai mulţi, cu filologii, cu filosofii, cu ziariştii, cu poeţii, cu criticii lor, ei ne dau pur şi simplu afară din ţara noastră . . . ne ocupă locurile şi, ce e mai pierzător, ne falsifică sufletul, ne degradează moralitatea prin opiul ziaristic şi literar cu care ne încîntă” (author’s emphasis). Iorga, Iudaica, 17–18.\n\nHistorical Background\n\n27\n\nmaintained a careful distance from his former collaborator A. C. Cuza. But his core creed remained the same: those elements, “non-​Romanian by blood,” must defer to and comply with “the rightful masters of this land.”42 Based on this unrelenting tradition of animosity toward the Jews, the popular perception of the Jewish presence in Romania, nourished by hostile xenophobic political circles and even, to some extent, by eminent historians, was that of an alien, parasitical, harmful, and even dangerous element. This perception, unfortunately not limited to Romania, can be summed up in the words of the historian Cecil Roth: “It is alleged by modern anti-​Semites . . . that the Jew is essentially a middleman, who has produced nothing; that he is an alien excrescence on Western life; and that the influence which he has had on the world’s culture, during the past two thousand years, has been entirely negative if not deleterious.”43 Not everyone actually adhered to this way of thinking—there were prominent intellectuals, such as Mihail Sadoveanu, Gala Galaction, Tudor Arghezi, and others, who opposed the trend—but for the majority of simple, honest Romanian men and women who had some knowledge of or shared experience with their Jewish compatriots, this only meant a need to permanently struggle internally with the commonly held stereotyped image of the archetypical Jew. The historical Romanian narratives prevailing at the end of the nineteenth century and in the first decades of the twentieth implied, therefore, that the Jews in the Old Kingdom of ​Romania were all part of a recent wave of immigration (“the Jewish invasion”) of foreign stock, having no roots whatsoever in Romanian history or on the Romanian land (i.e., village life). They constituted an exclusively urban population of parasitic exploiters, who were involved only in trade and financial “speculation,” while disdaining any and all “productive occupations.” The Jews were deemed an alien race hostile to any other culture and religion and as such perceived as not able and, most significantly, not willing to assimilate or integrate into the surrounding Romanian society. Conversely, as a countermeasure and in an attempt to support Jewish demands for equal rights and emancipation, Jewish historiography of the time put forward studies and collections of documents stressing the antiquity of the Jewish presence in the country, the participation of ​Jews in the settlement of the land, and the establishment of many market towns in the provinces as well as their valuable contribution to the development of ​local industry and the Romanian economy, as well as Romanian culture, in general—as seen in the first section of this chapter. 42. “Neromâneşti prin sînge”; “stăpînii îndrituiţi ai acestui pamînt.” Nicolae Iorga, “Doctrina naţionalistă,” in Doctrinele partidelor politice (Bucharest, 1923), 45–46, quoted in Volovici, Ideologia naţionalistă, 55. 43.

Exploring a novel approach in historical research by using onomastic tools as an additional and valid research method for the historian, I will analyze these surnames applying a linguistic methodology that reveals semantic, morphological, and phonetic attributes of the older layers of ​Romanian as well as shedding light on the social and economic history of the land. In so doing, I will suggest answers to six main historical questions regarding Jews in the Romanian lands: 1. Is there any substantive evidence of an early Jewish permanent settlement in the Romanian Principalities prior to the growth in Jewish immigration after 1830–1840? A high concentration of specific surnames in very specific areas, as well as the typology of these surnames, strongly supports the existence of early Jewish settlement (chapter 3). 2. Was there any significant Jewish presence in the villages before the beginning of the general trend of internal migration from the rural areas toward the major urban concentrations at the end of the nineteenth century? Surnames derived from certain toponyms and specific occupations attest to a significant Jewish presence in rural surroundings (chapter 4). 3. Were Jews actively involved in occupations and professions beyond those specifically linked to the financial and mercantile sectors? A wide variety of surnames link Jews to very specific manual crafts and physical activities, demonstrating the extent of ​Jewish involvement in all aspects of economic life in the Romanian lands (chapter 5). 4. Was Jewish identity monolithic and self-​centered, resulting in willing ethnic separation, or was it more diverse, fraught with internal tensions and contradictions, and eventually open to different degrees of integration and acculturation? Is there any evidence, on the individual, group, or general level, of the Jews’ willingness to integrate into the surrounding Romanian society? The very existence of ​local or adapted Romanian surnames among Jews in the Romanian lands points to a trend toward integration for at least part of them. Different types of surnames attest to different degrees of integration (chapter 6). 5. What was the Romanian governing circles’ attitude to the Jewish population’s tendencies toward integration and the reflection of those tendencies as expressed in the Romanization of ​Jewish surnames? The lack of ​legal enforcement of surnames for Jews until late in the nineteenth century by the Romanian\n\nHistorical Background\n\n29\n\nauthorities implies a lack of interest in the integration of the Jews. The adoption of ​R omanian surnames, which sometimes matched certain Jewish circles’ attempts to prove integration in support of their claims for emancipation and sometimes served as a means to evade the Jewish social stigma, was increasingly perceived by right-​w ing political groups as a national danger, triggering the government’s intervention to stop the process by means of ​legislation in 1940 (chapters 7 and 8). 6. Was there any difference between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews in coping with their Romanian surroundings? Fewer in number and therefore less menacing, the Sephardic Jews were also more similar in manners, clothing, and language to Romanian society, which in turn was more open to their integration (chapter 9). It is my contention that the analysis of surnames can illuminate historical aspects and processes of ​Romanian society, by either supporting or contradicting specific points of the different anti-​Jewish historical narratives. In this case, I am confident that the analysis of ​Jewish Romanian and Romanized surnames used or adopted by Romanian Jews will contribute to providing answers to the above questions and thus support and complement the manifold historical documentation that has been the source of ​Jewish historiography.\n\nChapter 2\n\nMethodological Approach\n\nMethodological Background A name is a fundamental anthropological fact that has a linguistic basis: it is agreed upon that the linguistic category of a “name” is a universal feature of all languages in the world. As the psychoanalyst Harold Feldman stated, “Personal names are sure to be found in any inventory of cultural items which are common to all known societies.”1 The evolution of ​humanity is seen as being very closely bound up with the institutionalization of names, so much so that the American sociologist Nathan Miller claims that “the nature of societal evolution . . . may be deduced from the study of the name. . . . We are often permitted to gain, through the instrumentality of the name, a flash-​back into the dim recesses of the history of ​human society.”2 In his structuralist analysis, Claude Lévi-​Strauss too gives a central role to proper names.3 Given names therefore characterize mankind from the beginning of ​history, while surnames are a more recent development, motivated by the centralized state authorities. Individuals become aware of the significance of their surnames when they begin to look and live beyond the family circle. Belonging to the social sphere as an identification symbol, the surname can acquire a very different weight, a cumulative one, when the individual lives in a large unit that asserts its rights vis-​à-​vis those of the individual. The practice of naming and the adoption of surnames are both, inevitably, influenced by historical processes, among them emigration and acculturation. Since the individual has no other choice but to realize him- or herself in a name, which is also characteristic of the community, the newcomer tries to receive a name accepted in the new group’s world of names. Sociologists studying the motives 1. Feldman, “Problem,” 237. 2. Miller, “Some Aspects,” 585. 3. Lévi-​Strauss, La Pensée, chaps. 6–7.\n\n30\n\nMethodological Approach\n\n31\n\nand frequency of name adoptions and name changes agree that the new name is being thought of as a way to attain integration, social acceptance, or prestige.4 Changes of names are common in cases of a change of role. A change of name is generally not a phenomenon of the first generation and reflects a deeper contact with the culture of the host country. A surname can refer with some likelihood to such features as social class, religion, and ethnic identity or background.5 Analysis of the character and the forms of names and surnames therefore makes possible a deeper enquiry into the historic processes they reflect. In this study, I will analyze the surnames used by Jews in relation to and in the light of existing historical documentation, including legislative decisions, periodicals, and traditional documents. I will explain in detail the principles of the linguistic and semantic methodology that will be used to analyze surnames and categorize them.\n\nJewish Names and Naming Patterns Traditionally, a Jewish personal name is either a sacred name (shem kodesh), given, for instance, to Jewish boys at their ritual circumcision, or a vernacular (non-​ Hebrew) name (kinnui) for everyday use. The given names that appear in Jewish religious documents are generally sacred names from one of the following groups: biblical names such as Abraham, David, Nathan, and Samuel; Talmudic or other names from the Hebrew or Aramaic lexicons such as Abba, Ben Zion, Chaim, and Nachman; a number of names borrowed from Greek: Alexander, Kalonymus, and Todros; and from Latin: Senior. Jewish communal record books (Pinkasim) are useful for analyzing Jewish names in Eastern Europe before the nineteenth century. They usually list registered sacred names as well as kinnuim that appear as the second part of a double given name, according to the following patterns: Derived from the sacred name: Isaac/Aizik, Israel/Isserl, Solomon/Zalmen Phonetically similar to the sacred name: Benjamin/Bunim, Menachem/Mendel Similar meaning in different languages: Ashe/Zelig (happy), Uri/Shraga (light), Zevi/Hirsch (deer) Traditionally related: Arie/Yehuda, Benjamin/Wolf, Naphtali/Hertz6\n\n4.

Cf ​Jacob’s blessing of ​his offspring, Gen. 49.\n\n32\n\nHistorical Implications of Jewish Surnames\n\nThe traditional naming pattern among Jews was rather simple: “Isaac ben Yaacov,” that is, “Isaac son of ​Yaacov.” In documents written in Aramaic the structure is the same, the patronymic particle bar being used rather than ben: “Tanchum bar Aba.” In the Pinkasim, in some cases, instead of the Hebrew pattern “X ben Y,” the Yiddish equivalent “X Ys” can be found, with the Yiddish possessive mark added to the father’s name: Hillels, Kalmens, Nisens. A few names are made using the Hebrew word ish (man), as in Ish Tropa, Ish Stein, also designating descendants of a particular person. In the examples given above, these patterns are the equivalent of surnames, which is not always the case for indications of ​Kohanic (priestly) or Levitic origin or their acronyms: Katz (Kohen Tzedek) or Segal (S’gan Levi), as can be seen in examples like Isaac Kahana ben Yehoshua ha-​Kohen, where Kahana is a surname while ha-​Kohen indicates priestly lineage. The surnames of community elders appearing in the Pinkasim are either based on place-​names from Western and Central Europe—Auerbach, Epstein, Horowitz, Rapaport, Spira—or derived from the Hebrew lexicon—Ashkenazi, Chefetz, Margolioth. Since there is no certainty that they were hereditary (which is the marker for family names), they should be considered at this stage as nicknames rather than real surnames. The same goes for the few Jews mentioned other than the elders, when occupations or places of residence were added to the given names: for example, Ber Kovna (from Kovno), Zalmen Shamash (the synagogue sexton). Another useful source for analyzing Eastern European Jewish names for the period is tombstone inscriptions in Jewish cemeteries. Surnames are unfortunately very rarely found on tombstones throughout Eastern Europe until the end of the eighteenth century. Jewish names are documented also in non-​Jewish sources. Jewish names in Russian sources from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries7 show an early tendency to record the sacred names in a Slavonized manner, usually through addition of Slavic suffixes: Avrametz, Avrashko, Berko, Moshechko, Mordish. Slavonization of ​Jewish names occurred particularly in localities where only a few Jews lived among the local population. In the eighteenth century, as the Jewish population grew and non-​Jewish scribes gradually became familiar with Jewish names, forms ending in the Yiddish diminutive suffix -l, as in Berl, Yankl, became much more common. There is evidence, on the other hand, of given names of completely Slavic origin, such as Drobna and Khlavno, and of calqued translations of ​Jewish names: Bogdan from Elnathan or Jonathan, Dobrusha from Guta, and so on. Among the Jewish names attested in Romanian-​language documents from 7. Regesty i nadpisi: Svod materialov dlya istorii evreev Rusii, vol. 1 (Petersburg, 1899), quoted in Beider, Dictionary Russian Empire, 4–9.\n\nMethodological Approach\n\n33\n\nroughly the same period8 are names such as Lupul and Cerbul that are obviously Romanian translations of ​Wolf and Hirsch. Most common in Slavic sources are Jewish names made up of a given name and a patronymic. Almost all patronymics were created by adding the suffixes -ovich or -evich to the father’s given name: for example, Abram Fajbishevich. Other suffixes used in patronymics were -uk, -enko, and -chuk. In the case of a woman, the second part of the name could be derived from the husband’s or the father’s given name: Sora Aaronova. Along with patronyms, many nicknames appear in Slavic and other non-​ Jewish sources. Some are based on occupational names or personal characteristics: Abram Dlugach (long), Shalomka Kotlyar (kettle maker), Leizer Vinik (wine dealer). Others are based on place-​names (toponyms) with the addition of the suffix -ski: Movsha Yanovski, Shaya Novgorodski. The major purpose of those nicknames was to distinguish one person from another with the same given name living in the same place. It is sometime difficult to know if the last element of a name is a nickname or a surname (i.e., a hereditary family name). Also, it is not certain these were actual nicknames, or whether Jews were only recorded as such by the Christians living in the same area. Moreover, the number of ​Jews listed with nicknames in Slavic registers in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries is small compared with those mentioned only by given name or given name and patronymic. Generally speaking, toward the end of the eighteenth century, the Jewish population living in Eastern Europe (i.e., Polish-​Lithuanian Commonwealth, Romanian Principalities) did not have surnames. The standard naming pattern recorded at that time in Slavic documents was the given name and a patronymic. In Romanian documents only the given name was generally recorded, sometimes together with the profession.\n\nJewish Surnames: A Typology This situation changed with the redrawing of ​Europe’s eastern borders following the three partitions of ​Poland (1772–95) and the rise of modern centralized national states, which needed to have full control of their tax-​collection apparatus and the military service system. Actual legislation making the use of surnames mandatory for Jews was first implemented by the Austrian emperor Joseph II on 23 July 1787 (“Das Patent über die Judennamen”), complemented in 1805 for the Jews of western Galicia. Corresponding laws were later given in other regions of ​ 8.

In the Russian Empire, the first law was enacted on 9 December 1804, but the process was long and slow, as proven by the need to promulgate a new law on 31 May 1835. In the Polish territories known as the Kingdom of ​Poland within the Russian Empire, mandatory surnames for Jews were introduced following the law of 27 March 1821, and its repeated extensions through 1825. It can be concluded, therefore, that the adoption or creation of ​Jewish surnames at the end of the eighteenth and begi"
