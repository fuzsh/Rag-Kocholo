Pauline Elisabeth Ottilie Luise zu Wied (29 December 1843 – 3 March/2 November 1916) was the Queen consort of Romania as the wife of King Carol I of Romania  As \"Carmen Sylva\", she wrote with facility in German, Romanian, French and English. A few of her voluminous writings, which include poems, plays, novels, short stories, essays, collections of aphorisms, etc., may be singled out for special mention  Her earliest publications were \"Sappho\" and \"Hammerstein\", two poems which appeared at Leipzig in 1880.  In 1888 she received the Prix Botta, a prize awarded triennially by the Académie française, for her volume of prose aphorisms Les Pensees d'une reine (Paris, 1882), a German version of which is entitled Vom Amboss (Bonn, 1890).  Cuvinte Sufletesti, religious meditations in Romanian (Bucharest, 1888), was also translated into German (Bonn, 1890), under the name of Seelen-Gespräche.  Several of the works of \"Carmen Sylva\" were written in collaboration with Mite Kremnitz, one of her maids of honor, who was born at Greifs-wald in 1857, and married Dr Kremnitz of Bucharest; these were published between 1881 and 1888, in some cases under the pseudonyms Dito et Idem. These include:  Aus zwei Welten (Leipzig, 1884), a novel  Anna Boleyn (Bonn, 1886), a tragedy  In der Irre (Bonn, 1888), a collection of short stories  Edleen Vaughan, or Paths of Peril (London, 1894), a novel  Sweet Hours (London, 1904), poems, written in English.  Among the translations made by \"Carmen Sylva\" are:  German versions of Pierre Loti's romance Pecheur d'Islande  German versions of Paul de St Victor's dramatic criticisms Les Deux Masques (Paris, 1881–1884)  and especially The Bard of the Dimbovitza, an English translation of Elena Văcărescu's collection of Romanian folk-songs, etc., entitled Lieder aus dem Dimbovitzathal (Bonn, 1889), translated by \"Carmen Sylva\" and Alma Strettell.  The Bard of the Dimbovitza was first published in 1891, and was soon reissued and expanded. Translations from the original works of \"Carmen Sylva\" have appeared in all the principal languages of Europe and in Armenian.\n\n7. Marie of Romania (Marie Alexandra Victoria, previously Princess Marie of Edinburgh; 29 October 1875 – 18 July 1938) was Queen consort of Romania from 1914 to 1927, as the wife of Ferdinand of Romania.  Marie had become a Romanian patriot, and her influence in the country was large. A.L. Easterman writes that King Ferdinand was \"a quiet, easy-going man, of no significant character… It was not he, but Marie who ruled in Romania.\" He credits Marie's sympathies for the Allies as being \"the major influence in bringing her country to their side\" in the war.  During the war, she volunteered as a Red Cross nurse to help the sick and wounded and wrote a book titled My Country to raise funds for the Red Cross, but these were by no means her most notable contributions to the war effort. With the country half-overrun by the German Army, she and a group of military advisers devised the plan by which the Romanian Army, rather than retreating into Russia, would choose a triangle of the country in which to stand and fight; and through a letter to Loïe Fuller she set in motion the series of events that brought a timely American loan to Romania, providing the necessary funds to carry out the plan. (Fortuitously, the young woman from the US embassy who delivered the letter to Fuller was the former ward of Newton D. Baker, by this time serving as U.S. Secretary of War. Fuller and the young woman travelled from Paris to Washington, DC and secured an audience with Baker who, along with U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Carter Glass, arranged the loan).  After the war ended, the Great Powers decided to settle affairs at the Paris Peace Conference. The Romanian objective was to secure the Romanian-inhabited territories from the now-defunct Austria-Hungary and Russian Empire, thereby uniting all Romanian-speakers in a single state. Romanian diplomats at the peace conference sought to achieve recognition by the Allies of the Unions of Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transylvania with Romania, proclaimed during 1918. With the Romanian delegation losing ground in the negotiations, Prime Minister Ionel Bratianu called upon the Queen to travel to France. Marie famously declared that \"Romania needs a face, and I will be that face,\" astutely calculating that the international press was growing tired of the endless negotiations and would be unable to resist the glamour of a Royal visit. The arrival of the so-called Soldier Queen was an international media sensation and she argued passionately that the Western powers should honour their debt to Romania (which had suffered a casualty rate proportionately far greater than Britain, France or the USA). Behind the scenes, she alternately charmed and bullied the Allied leaders into backing the Romanian cause. As a direct result of her charismatic intervention, Romania won back the initiative and successfully achieved all its pre-conference aims, eventually expanding its territory by 60%, gaining Bessarabia, Bukovina, Transylvania, as well as parts of the Banat, Crişana and Maramureş.\n\n8. Elena Văcărescu (September 21, 1864 in Bucharest – February 17, 1947 in Paris) was a Romanian-French aristocrat writer, twice a laureate of the Académie française.  Through her father, Ioan Văcărescu, she descended from a long line of boyars of Wallachia (the Văcărescu family), including Ienăchiţă Văcărescu, the poet who wrote the first Romanian grammar. She was also a granddaughter of Romanian poet Iancu Văcărescu. Through her mother, Eufrosina Fălcoianu, she descended from the Fălcoianu family, a prominent clan in the times of Prince Michael the Brave.  She spent most of her youth on the Văcărescu estate near Târgovişte. Elena first got acquainted with the English literature through her English governess, Miss Allan. She also studied French literature in Paris, where she met Victor Hugo, whom she later mentioned in her memoirs. She attended courses of philosophy, aesthetics and history, and also studied poetry under the guidance of Sully Prudhomme.  The meeting that changed her life was that with Elisabeth of Wied, Queen of Romania, wife of King Carol I. The Queen invited her to the palace in 1888. Interested in Elena Văcărescu's literary achievements, she became much more interested in the person of the poet. Having not yet recovered from the death of her only daughter in 1874, Elizabeth transferred all her maternal love on Elena.  Văcărescu was the Substitute Delegate to the League of Nations from 1922 to 1924. She was a permanent delegate from 1925 to 1926. She was again a Substitute Delegate to the League of Nations from 1926 to 1938. She was the only woman to serve with the rank of ambassador (permanent delegate) in the history of the League of Nations.  In 1925 she was welcomed as a member of the Romanian Academy. She translated into French, works of Romanian poets such as Mihai Eminescu, Lucian Blaga, Octavian Goga, George Topîrceanu, Ion Minulescu and Ion Vinea.  Just before her death, Văcărescu was a member of the Gheorghe Tătărescu-headed Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference at the end of World War II. She is interred in the Văcărescu family crypt in the Bellu cemetery in Bucharest.\n\n9. Marthe, Princess Bibesco (Marthe Lucie; née Lahovary; 28 January 1886 – 28 November 1973) was a Romanian-French writer of the Belle Époque. Bibesco's papers are at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.  When Romania at last entered the war on the Allied side in 1916, Marthe worked at a hospital in Bucharest until the German army burned down her home in Posada, in the Transylvanian Alps. She fled the country to join her mother and daughter in Geneva after a quarantine exile, imposed by the German occupants, in Austria-Hungary (as a guest of the princely family of Thurn and Taxis at Latchen). There she continued to write. For most of her life, she wrote every morning until lunchtime--her journals alone fill 65 volumes.  In Switzerland, she began work on Isvor, pays des saules (\"Isvor, Land of Willows\"). It was Marthe's Romanian masterpiece, where she brilliantly conveyed the everyday life and customs of her people, the extraordinary mixture of superstition, deep philosophy, resignation and hope, and the unending struggle between age-old pagan beliefs and Christian faith.  Tragedy didn't spare Marthe, as her younger sister and her mother would commit suicide in 1918 and 1920 respectively.  For the Bibescos life after the war was more cosmopolitan than Romanian. Among her literary friends and acquaintances, Marthe counted Jean Cocteau, Paul Valéry, Rainer Maria Rilke, François Mauriac, Max Jacob, and Francis Jammes. In 1919, Marthe was invited to Prince Antoine Bibesco's wedding in London to Elizabeth Asquith, daughter of the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Herbert Henry Asquith, later Earl of Oxford. Princess Elizabeth Bibesco, who died in Romania during World War II, is buried in the Bibesco family vault on the grounds of Mogoşoaia. Marthe for many years occupied an apartment in Prince Antoine's Quai Bourbon house at which she held literary and political salons  During this postwar period she rebuilt Posada, her mountain home, and began restoring the other family estate, Mogoşoaia, the palace built in Byzantine style. Again in London, she met Winston Churchill in 1920, starting a warm friendship that would last until his death in 1965. When her daughter Valentine married the Romanian prince Dimitrie Ghika-Comăneşti (October 1925) in a dazzling traditional ceremony, three Queens attended, (Queen-mother Sophia of Greece, Princess Consort Aspasia Manos of Greece and Queen Marie of Yugoslavia).  Exile  Eventually, Valentine and her husband were released from Romanian detention in 1958, and allowed passage to Britain, where Marthe, now totally dependent on her writing for money, bought them a home, the Tullimaar residence at Perranarworthal in Cornwall. She remained in Paris, first living at the Ritz Hotel (1946-1948), then in her apartment at 45, Quai de Bourbon. In 1955, she was appointed a member of the Belgian Academy of French Language and Literature, on the seat previously held by Anna de Noailles (née Bibesco, princess Bassaraba de Brancovan). Marthe cherished the 1962 award of the Légion d'honneur. It was in 1960 that her novel (27 years-in-the- making), La Nymphe Europe, which was really her autobiography, was published by Plon.  Now a grande dame, she enjoyed her last great friendship with a powerful leader, Charles de Gaulle, who invited her in 1963 to an Élysée Palace reception in the honour of the Swedish Sovereigns. De Gaulle also took a copy of Isvor, Pays des Saules with him when he visited Romania in 1968, and told her in the same year: ... you do personify Europe to me. Marthe was 82 years old. She died on 28 November 1973 in Paris.  In January 2001, a national poll of the most influential women in Romania's history placed princess Marthe Bibesco in the first position as the woman of the Millennium and of the 20th century.\n\n10. Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu ( 8 December 1876 - 5 March 1955 in Bucharest) was a novelist of the Romanian interwar period.  She was born in Iveşti, Galaţi County, the daughter of General Dimitrie Bengescu and of Zoe (born Stefǎnescu). She attended high-school in Bucharest and, aged 20, she married the magistrate Nicolae Papadat but her literary career was delayed because her husband was transferred from town to town (Turnu Măgurele, Buzău, Focşani, Constanţa) and because she had to take care of their four children: Nen, Zoe, Marcela and Elena.  Works  Povârnişul (The Slope) - 1915;  Ape adânci (Deep Waters) - 1919;  Bătrânul (The Old Man) - 1920;  Sfinxul (Sphinx) - 1920;  Femeia în faţa oglinzii (The Woman in Front of the Mirror) - 1921;  Balaurul (The Dragon) - 1923;  Romanţă provincială (Provincial Romance) - 1925;  Fecioarele despletite (The Disheveled Maidens) - 1926;  Concert din muzică de Bach (A Concert of Bach's Music) - 1927;  Desenuri tragice (Tragic Drawings) - 1927;  Drumul ascuns (The Hidden Road) - 1933;  Logodnicul (The Fiance) - 1935;  Rădăcini (Roots) - 1938;  Teatru (Selected Plays) - 1965: Bătrânul (The Old Man), A căzut o stea (A star has fallen), Medievala, Sora mea (My Sister), Ana\n\n11. Nina Cassian (pen name of Renée Annie Cassian; born 27th November 1924)  Is a Romanian poet, composer, journalist and film critic. She is noted for her translating abilities, and has rendered into Romanian the works of William Shakespeare, Bertolt Brecht, Christian Morgenstern, Yiannis Ritsos, and Paul Celan. She has published more than fifty books of her own poetry.  Born in Galaţi, she was married with fellow writer Vladimir Colin in 1943 (divorced in 1948), and later with Al. I. Ştefănescu. At the beginning of her career, Cassian was, with Colin, one of the noted contributors to the magazine Orizont.  She had a very close relation with Ion Barbu, one of the most important Romanian poets and mathematicians.  Cassian travelled to the United States as a visiting professor in 1985. During her stay in America, a friend of hers, Gheorghe Ursu, was arrested by the Securitate for possessing a diary. The diary contained several of Cassian's poems which satirized the Communist regime and the authorities thought to be inflammatory. Hence, she decided to remain in the US.  She was granted asylum in the United States, and she currently resides in New York City.\n\n12. Herta Müller (born 17 August 1953) is a Romanian-born German novelist, poet, essayist and recipient of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature.  Müller is noted for her works depicting the effects of violence, cruelty and terror, usually in the setting of Communist Romania under the repressive Nicolae Ceauşescu regime which she has experienced herself. Many of her works are told from the viewpoint of the German minority in Romania and are also a depiction of the modern history of the Germans in the Banat, and Transylvania. Her much acclaimed 2009 novel The Hunger Angel (Atemschaukel) portrays the deportation of Romania's German minority to Stalinist Soviet Gulags during the Soviet occupation of Romania for use as German forced labor.  Müller has received more than twenty awards to date, including the Kleist Prize (1994), the Aristeion Prize (1995), the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award (1998) and the Franz Werfel Human Rights Award (2009). On 8 October 2009, the Swedish Academy announced that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, describing her as a woman \"who, with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose, depicts the landscape of the dispossessed\".  In 2009, Müller enjoyed the greatest international success of her career. Her novel Atemschaukel (published in English as The Hunger Angel) was nominated for the Deutscher Buchpreis (German Book Prize) and won the Franz Werfel Human Rights Award. In this book, Müller describes the journey of a young man to a gulag in the Soviet Union, the fate of many Germans in Transylvania after World War II. It was inspired by the experience of poet Oskar Pastior, whose memories she had made notes of, and also by what happened to her own mother.  In October 2009, the Swedish Academy announced its decision to award that year's Nobel Prize in Literature to Müller \"who, with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose, depicts the landscape of the dispossessed.\" The academy compared Müller's style and her use of German as a minority language with Franz Kafka and pointed out the influence of Kafka on Müller. The award coincided with the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism. Michael Krüger, head of Müller's publishing house, said: \"By giving the award to Herta Müller, who grew up in a German-speaking minority in Romania, the committee has recognized an author who refuses to let the inhumane side of life under communism be forgotten\"\n\n13. Gabriela Adameșteanu ( born April 2, 1942) is a Romanian novelist, short story writer, essayist, journalist, and translator  The author of the celebrated novels The Equal Way of Every Day (1975) and Wasted Morning (1983), she is also known as an activist in support of civil society and member of the Group for Social Dialogue (GDS), as well as editor of Revista 22.  Drumul egal al fiecărei zile (The Equal Way of Every Day), a story alluding to intellectual survival in a provincial environment during the aggressive Stalinist 1950s, won her critical acclaim and the Romanian Academy prize. In 1979, she published a series of short stories under the title Dăruiește-ți o zi de vacanță (\"Offer Yourself a Day Off\"), which expanded on the themes of The Equal Way. During the same year, in August, she traveled to the People's Republic of Poland, where she witnessed the mood encouraged by the visit of Pope John Paul II (according to her recollections, it was \"a magic sentiment of human dignity\").  With Dimineață pierdută (Wasted Morning), a complex novel centered on an apparently banal conversation between two women, discreetly but fastidiously reconstructing the tragic end of the interwar generation, Adameșteanu was awarded the Writers' Union prize and was confirmed as one of the most important Romanian authors of the 1980s. Wasted Morning was set to stage by Cătălina Buzoianu in 1987, becoming the center of interest at a time when the Ceaușescu regime had entered its more repressive phase.  In 1989, a short while before the Romanian Revolution, she and other writers sent a letter of protest to the Communist leadership over the worsening conditions of life; she resigned from her position at Cartea Românească. In 1990, she joined GDS, and became editor of its magazine, 22, the following year.  Her other literary works include Vară-primăvară (a collection of short stories published in 1989), Obsesia politicii (interviews with post-1989 political figures, 1995), Cele două Românii (essays, 2000), and the 2003 novel Întâlnirea. She has translated into Romanian Guy de Maupassant's Pierre et Jean and Hector Bianciotti's Sans la miséricorde du Christ.\n\n14. She was known by the historians of romanian literature as on of the biggest romanian contemporany poets. She was born at Bucharest in 29 of march 1941. In 1961 she married with the poet Adrian Paunescu. The poetic opera of Constanta Buzea counts over 20 volumes, along she added a few analogies. She died on 31 of august 2012. Her operas started to publish from 1963 to 2008 : first was “From the earth” in 1963 and the last “ The unlived” in 2008.\n\n15. Ana Blandiana ( pen name of Otilia Valeria Coman; b. 25 March 1942, Timişoara) is a Romanian poet, essayist, and political figure. She took her name after Blandiana, near Vinţu de Jos, Alba County, her mother's home village.  In the late 1980s, assuming risks of reprisals of the communist regime, Blandiana started writing protest poems, in answer to the increasingly harsh demands of the system in general.  In 1984 Blandiana's poem 'Totul' ('Everything') was briefly published in the literary magazine Amfiteatru. 'Totul' was a list of elements of everyday life in Bucharest at the time, composed as a comment on the contrast between the official view of life in Romania and the alternative perception of its monotonous shabbiness. The critical nature of the poem led to the edition of Amfiteatru being withdrawn within hours of publication with the editors being dismissed. Nevertheless, the poem appeared in translation in Western media and also had limited underground circulation in Romania.  After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, she entered political life, campaigning for the removal of the communist legacy from administrative office, as well as for an open society.
