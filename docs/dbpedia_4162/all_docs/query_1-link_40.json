        "text": "Brazil's Former Presidential Chief-of-Staff to Stand Trial\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday accepted the charges filed against Brazil's former presidential chief of staff for his alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme at state-owned oil company Petrobras.\n\nThe federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu will face trial on the corruption, racketeering and money laundering charges filed earlier this month.\n\nFourteen other people will also be tried, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of Brazil's governing Workers' Party and Renato de Souza Duque, Petrobras' former head of corporate services.\n\nDirceu is the most senior member of the ruling Workers' Party to be taken into custody in connection with the scheme.\n\nDirceu served as former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's chief of staff between 2003 and 2005.\n\nHe was arrested early August in his home, where he already was under house arrest serving an 11-year sentence for his involvement in a cash-for-votes scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago.\n\nProsecutors have said that Dirceu masterminded the kickback scheme at Petrobras, accepted bribes while in office and continued to receive payments from contractors after he was jailed in late 2013 for the vote-buying scandal.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the scheme at Petrobras involved roughly $2 billion in bribes and other illegal funds.\n\nSome of that money was allegedly funneled back to campaign coffers of the ruling party and its allies.\n\nIt also allegedly included the payment of bribes to Petrobras executives in return for inflated contracts.\n\n'Miraculous' recovery for Peshawar massacre schoolboy\n\nA teenager paralysed after being shot four times in Pakistan's deadliest terror attack has made a \"miraculous\" recovery following treatment in the UK.\n\nMuhammad Ibrahim Khan, 13, had been told by doctors in Pakistan that he would never walk again.\n\nAt least 140 people, mostly children, were killed when gunmen stormed Peshawar's Army Public School last December.\n\nMuhammad, who arrived in London last month for surgery, is being discharged from hospital later.\n\nExactly nine months ago, on an ordinary Tuesday morning, Muhammad sat in his first aid class listening to his teachers intently.\n\nAt the same time seven gunmen disguised in security uniforms were entering the Army Public School.\n\nThey were strapped with explosives and had one simple mission in mind: Kill every man, woman and child they came across.\n\n\"I can't forget what happened that day,\" Muhammad says with a severe stare.\n\nWe were sitting in the auditorium, we were asking questions... and then we heard heavy gunfire outside.\n\nThe terrorists moved inside and they started killing - our teacher was burned alive.\n\nMuhammad described pulling four other pupils out of the auditorium as the carnage unfolded.\n\nHe said he then heard his friend, Hamza calling to him.\n\nHe said, 'oh brother save me'.\n\nI held his hand.\n\nThat's when I was shot in the back, and he was shot in the head.\n\nMost of the people killed in the attack were pupils\n\nHamza died in Muhammad's arms.\n\nMuhammad recalled blacking out after that, and the next thing he knew he was in a hospital bed, paralysed from the waist down.\n\nDoctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, and then Rawalpindi, close to the capital, told his family there was no treatment, and he would never walk again.\n\n\"Seeing him I felt like my soul had left my body,\" says Muhammad's father, Sher Khan\n\nThose nine months were the hardest in my life.\n\nBut Mr Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their cricket-mad son would never be able to use his legs again.\n\nThey campaigned, and appealed for help on Pakistani TV, gaining the support of high profile people such as cricketer turned politician Imran Khan.\n\nFinally, they were able to raise the funds to bring Muhammad to the UK and provide him with treatment at London's private Harley Street Clinic.\n\nConsultant neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Muhammad as \"terrified\" when he first arrived at the hospital.\n\n\"He'd spent the last [few] months lying on a bed, unable to move side to side,\" says Mr Malik.\n\nHe was weak, he had a pressure sore on his back.\n\nHe wasn't in great shape.\n\nA vertebra at the base of Muhammad's spine was destroyed\n\nMuhammad was shot in his shoulder, his hip, and his back during the attack, damaging his lower spine - leading to paralysis.\n\nBut during six hours of surgery, Mr Malik and his team were able to reattach nerve endings and reconstruct the damaged part of the spine.\n\nEven Mr Malik was surprised at what happened next.\n\nExactly one week after the surgery Muhammad stood up and started taking steps and walking.\n\nWe were not expecting to get that sort of excellent result.\n\nThat was miraculous,\" he says.\n\nLess than two weeks after his operation, Muhammad is ready to leave hospital and start the long road to recovery.\n\nMuhammad has defied the odds and started to walk again\n\nHe says he wants to build his strength and continue his education in the UK.\n\nBut he says he is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and help fight terrorism.\n\n\"I feel like I have a second chance at life,\" he says as he shows off pictures he's drawn of guns scribbled out next to school books and pens\n\nMuhammad grows physically stronger every day but the psychological trauma he continues to endure is unimaginable.\n\n\"My anger is not diminishing\" he says.\n\nIn my school little kids were killed.\n\nWhat was their crime?\n\nHis mother, wiping a tear from her eye, caressed his head and said: \"I can see my son walking again.\"\n\nHe'll be able to get on with his normal life.\n\n'Super Voice' 4G service from Three offers better signal\n\nThree is making use of a lower frequency 4G spectrum that can travel more widely\n\nMobile phone provider Three has launched a UK service it says will improve reception inside buildings and in rural black spots.\n\nIts 4G Super Voice enables customers to make calls and send texts using a lower frequency spectrum.\n\nOther networks are looking into introducing the technology, known as Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE).\n\nIt currently works on only the Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone handsets will be added in the coming months.\n\nThree said up to 5.5 million customers would have access to the service by 2017.\n\nChief technology officer Bryn Jones said: \"By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to better indoor coverage and be able to use their phones in more places than ever before.\"\n\nStars prepare for panto season\n\nPantomime season is big business for theatres up and down the UK, with many getting ready for this year's season now.\n\nSome of the biggest names in showbusiness now take part in the yuletide theatre.\n\nMatthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will be appearing in Cinderella - one as an ugly sister, the other as fairy godmother.\n\nThey reveal their panto secrets to BBC Breakfast.\n\nSteven Wilson: 'If I don't do anything, I feel this creeping guilt'\n\nSteven Wilson was recently the big winner at the Progressive Music Awards\n\nSteven Wilson is often dubbed the hardest working musician in the world of progressive rock.\n\nThe multi-talented musician won three prizes at this month's Progressive Music Awards in London, including album of the year for Hand.\n\nThe Guardian's five-star review called it \"a smart, soulful and immersive work of art.\"\n\nSince the 1980s, Wilson has been the driving force in a number of musical projects, the best known of which is the rock band Porcupine Tree.\n\nNow, ahead of two sell-out shows at the Royal Albert Hall, Wilson is releasing a vinyl-only double LP, Transience, to showcase the \"more accessible\" side of his solo output.\n\nHe tells the BBC about his love of vinyl, his busy schedule and explains how comic actor Matt Berry came to be his support act.\n\nWhat does vinyl mean to you?\n\nI grew up at the very tail end of the vinyl era, and at the time, I remember, we couldn't wait for CD to come along because vinyl was so frustrating.\n\nYou would buy the record, take it home, and it would have a scratch, and you would have to take it back again.\n\nI love CDs, and for some kinds of music - classical for example - it is better than vinyl.\n\nBut the problem with the CD and digital downloads is that there's nothing you can really cherish or treasure.\n\nOwning vinyl is like having a beautiful painting hanging in your living room.\n\nIt's something you can hold, pore over the lyrics and immerse yourself in the art work.\n\nI thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it can't be if kids too young to remember vinyl are enjoying that kind of experience.\n\nDo you have a piece of vinyl that you treasure?\n\nThe truth is I got rid of 100% of my vinyl in the 90s.\n\nAll the vinyl I have is re-bought.\n\nI started off from the perspective that I wanted to recreate the collection I had when I was 15, but it's gone beyond that.\n\nThe first record which I persuaded my parents to buy for me was Electric Light Orchestra's Out of the Blue.\n\nIf I still had my original copy, it would have sentimental value, but, alas, it's in a charity shop somewhere.\n\nSteven Wilson hopes the album will be a doorway for potential new fans\n\nWhy release your new compilation Transience on vinyl?\n\nIt was originally conceived as an idea for Record Store Day, but we missed the boat on that.\n\nMy record company had suggested I put together some of my shorter, more accessible songs.\n\nI got a bit obsessed by the idea to make something like \"an introduction to Steven Wilson,\" and I was committed to it being a vinyl-only release.\n\nAnyone who buys the vinyl does also get a high-resolution download.\n\nDo you have a concern that the album won't show your work in a true light?\n\nNo - because although I do focus on more long-form pieces of music, there is one thing I have always valued above everything else: melody.\n\nThere is a lot of progressive rock which focuses on the technical complexity of the track rather than the melodic side.\n\nPink Floyd, the most successful progressive rock band of all time, have stood the test of time because the emphasis was always on melody and atmosphere.\n\nWhat do you have in store for your Albert Hall shows?\n\nI don't want to give away too much.\n\nThe repertoire will be completely different each night.\n\nThe first night is going to be a version of the Hand. Erase. show I've been doing this year - but on steroids - with a couple of guests.\n\nThe second night is going to be more of a trip into my history, which is more aimed at the fans have been following me for years.\n\nHow did it come about that Matt Berry is the support act on the second night?\n\nMyself and everyone on the tour bus are massive fans of [Channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London to the point that we are quoting it endlessly.\n\nI thought that I should check out Matt's music, so I picked up a copy of his Music for Insomniacs.\n\nI chatted with him about our love of Mike Oldfield and asked him to play at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nI'm going to be incredibly star struck by my opening act.\n\nYou've been remixing albums by the likes of XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.\n\nHow much does that influence your own work?\n\nI don't consciously draw from that, but, inevitably, if you are deconstructing these classic albums they really get into your head.\n\nMy last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was without doubt the most old-school progressive album I've ever done.\n\nI don't think it was coincidence that I had been remixing King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost exclusively for the previous year.\n\nThe current album, Hand. Erase., opened up a lot more because I'd been working on Tears for Fears and XTC.\n\nYou are often described as progressive rock's busiest musician.\n\nIs that how it feels?\n\nYou can remove the word progressive.\n\nI think I am probably one of the most work-obsessed people in the music business today, and I don't say that with any sense of pride because believe me it's a curse.\n\nI think I get it from my father, who also had an incredibly strong work ethic.\n\nIf I don't do anything for a whole day, I start to feel this creeping guilt.\n\nThat's why the remix work has been such a gift to me because it means I don't have to be doing my own music all the time.\n\nThe music industry is a hard place to make a living for yourself.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a profession now.\n\nI work every day, and I'm not rich, but I make a good living.\n\nI love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I was lazy about it, I don't think I'd be able to survive.\n\nTransience is out in the UK on 25 September.\n\nSteven Wilson plays the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September as part of his 2015-16 tour of Europe.\n\nContract sees jobs fly back to Skytrans\n\nThe new Skytrans has re-employed some of the airline staff who lost their jobs when the original Skytrans collapsed.\n\nReborn north Queensland airline Skytrans has secured a $25 million contract to transport natural gas company QGC workers, which has led to 18 staff getting their jobs back.\n\nThe Wild family-owned Skytrans went bust in January, after the Newman government awarded the subsidised routes that formed a large part of the airline's business.\n\nThe collapse led to several communities facing potential isolation, with federal LNP north Queensland MP Warren Entsch leading a chorus of criticism of the state LNP government.\n\nAnother company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.\n\nSkytrans chief executive Michael Thinee said the airline's contract with QCG had already created jobs.\n\n\"We have been able to re-employ 18 Skytrans staff back into full time employment as pilots and cabin crew,\" he said.\n\nWe are also pleased to welcome new staff who have direct logistics experience managing flight operations for QGC customers.\n\nWe have grown our workforce by 100 per cent in just five months, with 78 staff being employed in Cairns and now Brisbane.\n\nThe contract would see Skytrans expand its flight operations from its Cairns headquarters, which services Cape York and the Torres Strait, to also include a base in Brisbane.\n\nSkytrans will operate 18 return flights per week for QGC staff and contractors from Brisbane to sites in Chinchilla and Taroom on its 36-seat Dash-8s from Monday, October 26.\n\nQGC managing director Tony Nunan said Skytrans was awarded the contract after a competitive tender process.\n\n\"We're delighted that this contract will help a Queensland company to expand,\" he said.\n\nThe Skytrans contract maintains high quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.\n\nLiberal MP and new mum Kelly O'Dwyer told to express more breast milk to avoid missing votes in the chamber\n\nMore women likely for cabinet\n\nMalcolm Turnbull's new ministry will be sworn in on Monday, with a strong indication there will be more women on the front bench.\n\nOne of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been advised to express more breast milk for her newborn baby to avoid her breastfeeding interfering with her duties in the parliamentary chamber.\n\nThe advice came from the office of the government's Chief Whip Scott Buchholz, who subsequently had to consult his Labor counterpart to find out how to better deal with a breastfeeding MP in accordance with the standing orders.\n\nLiberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter Olivia.\n\nUnder the standing orders - the set of rules which govern behaviour of MPs in the chamber - new mothers who are breastfeeding are given a proxy vote in the Parliament.\n\nThis means their vote is counted even though they are not physically in the chamber.\n\nBut the Whip was unaware of the exemption until he consulted the opposition's Chief Whip, Chris Hayes, about the matter.\n\nThe issue flared up on two occasions when Ms O'Dwyer was unable to attend a division and a speaking obligation because she had just begun breastfeeding.\n\nOn one of these occasions her office was asked whether the MP had considered expressing more milk instead of breastfeeding.\n\nQueensland MP Scott Buchholz is the government's Chief Whip.\n\nThe pair have subsequently resolved the dispute.\n\nBoth declined to comment when contacted by Fairfax Media but sources separate to Mr Buchholz and Ms O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media the Member for Higgins was furious at being told to consider expressing more milk over breastfeeding her daughter Olivia, who was born in May.\n\nThe revelation comes as new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works on the shape of his new cabinet.\n\nMr Buchholz, a Queensland Liberal National MP was promoted to the job of Chief Whip by former prime minister Tony Abbott, as part of the fallout from the attempted spill in February earlier this year.\n\nMs O'Dwyer, pictured with Labor's Amanda Rishworth and son Percy, is one of three new mums in the Parliament.\n\nThe former whip Phillip Ruddock was dumped just days after Mr Abbott stared down a spill motion to remove him as leader and was replaced with Mr Buchholz.\n\nAnother Abbott loyalist, Tasmanian Liberal Andrew Nickolic was also promoted and made a Deputy Whip.\n\nMr Nickolic has made headlines in recent days, after it was revealed he texted Mr Turnbull demanding he rule out a challenge to Mr Abbott's leadership.\n\nMs O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time in August since giving birth to her baby Olivia in May.\n\nShe is one of three new mothers in the Parliament this year.\n\nLabor's health spokeswoman Catherine King said on Wednesday that the proxy vote for breastfeeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.\n\n\"He is now [seven years old],\" she tweeted.\n\nThe Whip should have known.\n\nMs O'Dwyer was promoted to the frontbench late last year and could be promoted under Mr Turnbull who on Wednesday said he wanted more women in his cabinet.\n\n\"There is no greater enthusiast than me to see more women in positions of power, influence, Parliament, ministries, right across the country,\" the Prime Minister told reporters at Parliament House.\n\nMr Abbott included just one woman in his first cabinet and after sustained pressure to boost female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman into cabinet in the December reshuffle.\n\nFive things business wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull\n\nMalcolm Turnbull: how will markets react?\n\nBusinessDay columnist Mal Maiden examines what impact Malcolm Turnbull might have on Australia's business sector.\n\nThe business lobby could not shout its approval loudly enough on Tuesday as Malcolm Turnbull took the nation's reins as Prime Minister.\n\nThe key reason is that so much of what many of them would like to see had been taken off the table under the leadership of Tony Abbott.\n\nEither that, or it had sunk into a negotiated standstill through Abbott's crash-or-crash-through political style.\n\nWith one voice the lobbyists talked about a hoped-for ability in Turnbull to make the public argument, to cut the political deal and get tough things done.\n\nSo what exactly are the nation's biggest companies, and their lobbyists, looking for in our new Prime Minister?\n\nChAFTA will be an early test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity.\n\nTurnbull himself put the China free trade deal up on the tee as an early goal.\n\nIn his first speech to the media announcing the challenge, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) was the focal point for his attack on Labor leader Bill Shorten.\n\nIn a speech in August, Turnbull decried \"outrage outbursts of economic chauvinism\" from Labor over the issue and raised concerns about a racial edge to the criticism.\n\n\"In the ChAFTA context the winners overwhelmingly outnumber the losers,\" he said in the same speech.\n\nBusiness is pinning its hopes on his winning this debate.\n\nBusiness legend Don Argus was quick to make this a key point, he was echoed by the Business Council of Australia (which represents the nation's 100 biggest companies), gaming billionaire James Packer and others.\n\nBusiness wants this deal done and it will be an early test of both Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity and also to negotiate with the senate cross-bench.\n\nSmall Business Minister Bruce Billson supports the Harper Review recommendations.\n\nThis issue is shaping as a potential early rift with the business community.\n\nThe effects test is applied in big mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer from a lack of competition.\n\nIt's called an \"effects test\" because it takes into account not only a company's actions and intent, but the effect that they have on competitors and the market.\n\nHow that test is worded is extremely important to the outcome.\n\nThe Harper review of competition law recommended a change to the effects test that will make harder for large corporates to squeeze smaller operators out.\n\nUnder Tony Abbott, the government was all set to side with the Business Council of Australia and the big retailers.\n\nTurnbull has now signalled he wants to have a full cabinet consider what to do next.\n\nThe BCA has jumped straight out of the blocks to say consumers will pay higher prices if Turnbull takes up the Harper review's recommendations.\n\nOne irony is that business has also strongly urged the new Prime Minister to have a greater respect for cabinet process, which is Turnbull seems to be doing in allowing his Small Business Minister Bruce Billson (who supports the Harper recommendation) to makes his case to his colleagues.\n\nMediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer\n\nSpanish researchers tracked women between sixty and eighty years old.\n\nThose eating mostly plants, fish, and olive oil appeared to *significantly* reduce the likelihood of breast cancer.\n\nTerrence Howard challenges the times tables\n\nTerrence Howard believes that we've got arithmetic all wrong.\n\nThe \"Empire\" villain told Rolling Stone that he does not believe one times one equals one.\n\n\"How can it equal one?\" he said.\n\nIf one times one equals one that means that two is of no value because one times itself has no effect.\n\nOne times one equals two because the square root of four is two, so what's the square root of two?\n\nShould be one, but we're told it's two, and that cannot be.\n\nWe lost you there, Terrence.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Howard's teachers did not agree with his theory, and he subsequently left Pratt Institute, where he was studying chemical engineering.\n\n\"I mean, you can't conform when you know innately that something is wrong,\" he explained.\n\nHoward calls his parallel take on math \"Terrylogy.\"\n\nThe actor said he spends time cutting and re-forming scissors, wire, magnets and sheets of plastic to illustrate his one-times-one theory and other similar theories he has.\n\nHe told the magazine that he and his ex-wife Mira Pak would spend up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.\n\nThe Rolling Stone writer described Howard's creations as \"building blocks but the shapes are infinitely more complex, in two dimensions and three, tied together by copper wire or held in place by magnets.\"\n\nHoward said he hopes to inherit U.S. patent 20150079872 A1 (\"Systems and methods for enhanced building-block applications\"), among others.\n\nThe \"Hustle and Flow\" actor also said that Pythagoras, Einstein and Tesla would \"lose [their minds]\" if they saw Terryology.\n\n\"Since I was a child of three or four,\" he said, \"I was always wondering, you know, why does a bubble take the shape of a ball?\"\n\nWhy not a triangle or a square?\n\nI figured it out.\n\nHoward added that he hopes to change the course of education.\n\n\"This is the last century that our children will ever have been taught that one times one is one,\" he said.\n\nThey won't have to grow up in ignorance.\n\nTwenty years from now, they'll know that one times one equals two.\n\nWe're about to show a new truth.\n\nThe true universal math.\n\nWe'll have to check up in 20 years.\n\nAriana Grande channels Britney Spears during Wheel of Impression\n\nAriana Grande nailed impressions of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera Tuesday during a visit to \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\"\n\nThe 22-year-old pop star played Fallon's Wheel of Impression bit, taking on \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" as Spears, and then showing off her vocal chops with an Aguilera-sounding rendition of \"The Wheels on the Bus.\"\n\nFor his part, Fallon did a nice job channeling Sting and Aaron Neville.\n\nThe two also took turns doing versions of The Weeknd's \"I Can't Feel My Face.\"\n\nGrande has been on the press circuit this week.\n\nEarlier in the day, she paid a visit to \"Good Morning America\" where she opened up about the doughnut licking incident.\n\nTaco Bell hopes wine-serving 'Cantinas' will become urban hotspots\n\nLooking for a swanky night out?\n\nConsider Taco Bell.\n\nOn September 22, the Mexican style fast food chain will open up a new location in Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood featuring a tapas-style menu of appetizers, a mural from a local artist, and even alcoholic beverages.\n\nIt's the first of the chain's 'Taco Bell Cantina' test locations, aimed at catering to a younger crowd increasingly concentrated in city centers.\n\nTaco Bell, which has nearly 6,000 US locations, is rooted primarily in suburban areas and associated with cheap, quick eats, like the wildly popular Doritos Locos Taco.\n\nWith the average Taco Bell tab in the $7 range, the company has utilized drive-throughs and fast service to attract the quantity of customers needed to turn a profit.\n\nBut to cater to Millennials \"seeking more urban environments to live, work, and play,\" according to Taco Bell, the test locations must follow a different model, with smaller footprints and pricier options.\n\nTo put in a drive-thru you need land.\n\nCan you imagine buying an acre of land in a neighborhood like Wicker Park?\n\n\"You couldn't afford it,\" Neil Borkan, the Taco Bell franchisee who will operate the Chicago location told USA TODAY.\n\nAt the Chicago location, new menu items will be prepared alongside Taco Bell's traditional offerings in an open kitchen, where \"you will literally be able to see the food\" before it's prepared, Taco Bell's Chief Development Officer Meredith Sandland told the Associated Press.\n\nThe new location will also serve wine, beer, and frozen alcoholic drinks, echoing recent moves by many of Taco Bell's competitors.\n\nSeventy-five Starbucks cafes now offer \"evening\" menus that include beer, wine, and small snacks.\n\nTen thousand out of Chipotle's roughly 1,900 restaurants offer alcoholic beverages.\n\nAnother Taco Bell Cantina location will be opened in San Francisco near AT&T Park later this month, according to the company, eschewing a drive-thru and parking lot for a patio and a pickup window.\n\nThose changes in location, atmosphere, and additions all point to the fast food chain aiming to attract a clientele beyond those looking for late night junk food.\n\nTaco Bell first set its sights on a higher quality food line in 2012, when it unveiled pricier Cantina bowls and burritos to compete with Chipotle, along with an accompanying ad campaign focusing on the new items' protein content.\n\nIf successful, the Cantina locations will be yet another step in that upscale push.\n\nTaco Bell said it plans to add 2,000 locations in the US by 2022.\n\nMs. Sandland told the AP, \"several hundred\" of them will be \"Cantinas.\"\n\nThey have heated up their phones in the middle of the night: Elton John courts Putin\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin telephoned Elton John on Monday night, just days after the British artist said publicly that he wants to meet the Russian politician to talk together about the Russian antigay legislation.\n\nThe British singer, a declared homosexual, tried unsuccessfully to obtain a meeting with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, a year after he defied the protests in this country and held two concerts in 2013 in a hectic period in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws which ban \"homosexual propaganda\" among minors.\n\nIn 2014 in St. Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and stated the following in front of his fans: \"Although I'm gay, I always felt that I am welcomed here in Russia.\"\n\nIf I were not honest about what I am, I could not write these songs.\n\nThey do not mean gay propaganda.\n\nThey represent the way I express life.\n\nIf we begin to punish people for this, then the world will lose its humanity.\n\nLast Saturday, the artist revealed that he wants to meet with Putin to discuss this controversial issue.\n\nSo far, there is no clear information on the telephone conversation between the two personalities.\n\nCocos confessed everything in the National Authority for Property Restoration (NAPR) file\n\nBusinessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a stinging conviction, by \"singing\" everything to the judges and detailing how he gave millions of euros to the former members of NAPR Commission.\n\nInterviewed yesterday before the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the case in which he is being prosecuted together with his son Alin Cocos, the former head of the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Compensation within NAPR, Dorin Cocos seemed to have been hit by the lightning of sincerity.\n\nHe admitted all the allegations and told in detail to the judges how he helped businessman Stelian Gheorghe in the NAPR Compensation case, while asking instead to be judged more quickly and that his cooperation be taken into account.\n\nCocos stated that he has known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he befriended him after several real estate businesses.\n\nHe said that he met Sergiu Diacomatu in 2010 who told him he worked for NAPR.\n\nLater I learned that (Diacomatu, n.r). is the vice president, and due to the fact that Stelian Gheorghe has a file pending at NAPR, I asked him to help us.\n\nI promised him money, 2.5 million Euro, money that I said I will give in several instalments.\n\nI also promised him political support to remain in office.\n\n\"Diacomatu told me then that he will help me, but that he needs support,\" said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.\n\nHe stated that after this, through an acquaintance, he came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Commission for Compensations, to whom he promised 800,000 Euro.\n\nFor the second case of Gheorghe Stelian, I knew that he wanted to get more than 300,000 Euro.\n\nDiacomatu already had political support, I also gave him five million Euro.\n\nTo Crinuta Dumitrean one million Euro, to Bogdan Dragos I gave 800,000 Euro.\n\nPlease note that I gave all this money in instalments to make sure that the case will be settled.\n\n\"I only told them the following: solve the case, give compensations,\" said Cocos.\n\nAsked why he came to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million Euro for the positive settlement of the second case of Gheorghe Stelian.\n\nI received for the second case eight million euros to solve the problem, but I was left with only 1.2 million.\n\nIn 2013 I also met Alina Bica.\n\n\"We never talked about money or lands\" said Cocos.\n\nHe also said that \"it was a known fact that all NAPR members agreed upon before the meeting.\"\n\nI was not nervous about them giving a positive vote.\n\nAll the NAPR positions were given politically, but I personally did not help Diacomatu politically.\n\n\"I told him I would help him politically only to calm him\", concluded Cocos.\n\nPonta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA (National Anticorruption Directorate)\n\nPrime Minister Victor Ponta went to DNA yesterday for just five minutes, during which he submitted new documents in the file \"Turceni - Rovinari\".\n\nVictor Ponta ran to DNA with a document of the European Court of Justice\n\nConvinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the file in which he is being investigated for forgery under private signature, complicity to tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to DNA, although the documents he had could have been sent though a lawyer.\n\nIt was not to be, as the prosecutor had no time and the Prime Minister left after five minutes, during which he left several documents at the Register's Office.\n\nI wanted to submit (to the case, n.r) the resolution of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.\n\nI say I performed works, the prosecutor says I did not, the European Court of Justice told us we should both mind our business because as long the taxes were paid, things are alright.\n\n\"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory and certain for all European Union countries, there is no case here,\" said Prime Minister Victor Ponta, when he exited DNA.\n\nPonta also said that, in his view, the European Court's decision should apply, if we are EU members.\n\nUntil then, the Prime Minister expects the prosecutor to read the European Court's decision and to call him again for questioning, but also to give him a response to his demands, including the splitting of the file.\n\nIohannis is relishing his mandate without a TV\n\nIn today's Romania, there is no legal provision which forces you to watch television.\n\nNot even to own such a device, since the television fee is added to the energy bill.\n\nBut if you're the president, things change radically.\n\nThis is due to the fact that it is basically implied that the Romanian president's job description states the president is up to date with everyday realities.\n\nEach day, president Iohannis immerses himself in total silence in his office at Cotroceni\n\nBut, to the amazement of even the closest of his people at the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Iohannis refuses to have a TV in the presidential office.\n\nEven after failing to watching TV - any program, even German networks like RTL or Pro Sieben - the president also does not listen to any radio stations or read any newspapers.\n\nIn addition, he does not even receive the \"negative monitoring\" for example. His predecessor requested it as a priority.\n\nInstead, Iohannis only enjoys receiving the news reports which put him in a positive light.\n\nBeside this informational self-isolation, in which the only break is when he accesses Facebook, even more serious is the blockage the president is pushing the overall activity of the Presidential Administration towards, by being passive.\n\nThis happened because, although a lot of time has passed from the moment he was brought into service, Iohannis has yet to sign the loyalty statements for more than half of the employees of the Presidential Administration.\n\nThis is becoming a growing problem, both in terms of human and legal standpoints.\n\nAll is quiet and peaceful\n\nThe presidential entourage is already convinced that nobody and nothing can damage the \"feng shui\" of the presidential office.\n\nA place of peace and quiet.\n\nIt's true that just after a minute to nine (no more, no less!) in the morning, the former mayor of Sibiu requires the presence of the officials.\n\nThis custom probably remained from the days when he was the mayor of the town near the Cibin river.\n\nThe fact that Iohannis does not want a television in his office has already given rise to countless legends, thus people in the Cotroceni Palace already tend to think that, by doing so, the president is trying avoid being monitored.\n\nEspecially since he does not own any radios.\n\nBut, at this rate, the next step is to meditate in the dark, because even the illuminating equipment can hide audio-video recording devices.\n\nAll is good\n\nFurthermore, another oddity at the Cotroceni Palace is that only the \"positive monitoring\" regarding the president is delivered to the him.\n\nThat is, if there is any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the president will receive the information on his desk.\n\nGood news or no news!\n\nEven more interesting is that \"negative monitoring\" is forbidden, given that, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only for watching late night television shows he was criticized in, but asking that every morning the bad news be delivered with priority.\n\nThat does not necessarily mean this was of any help, but, as they say, the gesture counts!\n\nAt least no one can ever say he was not well informed from alternative sources.\n\nNeither fired nor confirmed\n\nAfter all, maybe the mystery of why Klaus Iohannis does not want to watch TV is going to be solved.\n\nUntil then, the resolution of the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the presidential administration would be more important, irrespective of how it may be achieved.\n\nIn order to work, the employees are required to sign a statement of loyalty to the president in office, which must also bear his signature.\n\nBut, since December and until now, Klaus Iohannis has yet to sign for confirmation even half of these statements, although this was supposed to be done within 30 days.\n\nSo hundreds of people representing over half of the staff at the Cotroceni Palace are in an uncertain situation now.\n\nLegally speaking, if the president does not personally sign their statement, they should be fired.\n\nThe thing is that all these employees did not received any negative opinion either!\n\nSo, after all, after the inspectors of the Court of Auditors will carry out an investigation, they will find that for over half a year, many hundreds of people have received their wages sailing close to the wind.\n\nThat is until the president decides if he is going to fire them or confirm their positions, the decision being strictly his own.\n\nTeen was plotting to attack Pope Francis during US visit, authorities say\n\nA teenager's ISIS-inspired plot to attack Pope Francis during his U.S. visit was more \"aspirational\" than operational, a law enforcement source confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday.\n\nThe 15-year-old was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August, when law enforcement authorities foiled the plot.\n\nThe plot is the same one Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, the Homeland Security chairman, referred to during an interview on Sunday, a source told Fox News.\n\n\"We are monitoring very closely threats against the pope as he comes into the United States,\" McCaul said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nPope Francis was not named as the specific target of the plot in an Aug.\n\n14 FBI and Department of Homeland Security joint intelligence bulletin that said the teen planned to use multiple attackers, firearms and explosives to target a \"foreign dignitary at a high-profile event.\"\n\nThe bulletin said the minor was radicalized via social media.\n\nThe teen may suffer from mental health issues, a law enforcement source told Fox News, though the source wouldn't detail specifics about the teen's condition.\n\nMcCaul on Sunday also acknowledged the potential for a so-called \"lone wolf\" attack nationwide and said he was briefed by the Secret Service \"in a classified setting\" about the pope's visit.\n\nAnd with that comes a large security risk...But as that date approaches, I think we're all very vigilant to protect him as he comes into the United States.\n\nFox News' Matt Dean contributed to this report.\n\nMedieval skeleton discovered in tree suffered violent death, experts say\n\nArchaeologists in Ireland have unearthed startling details about the strange medieval skeleton found in the roots of a 215 year-old tree.\n\nThe beech tree in Collooney, Sligo, fell during a storm earlier this year, revealing the macabre sight of a skeleton trapped in its roots.\n\nThe Irish National Monuments Service brought in experts from Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyze the remains, revealing a grisly tale.\n\n\"He had been killed violently,\" Marion Dowd, director of Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, told FoxNews.com.\n\nWe have stab wounds in the upper chest and they were inflicted by a knife - we also have a stab wound in the left hand, which suggests that he was trying to defend himself.\n\nThe skeleton is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.\n\nRadiocarbon analysis has dated the remains to between 900 and 1,000 years old.\n\n\"We don't know if he was killed in a battle or if this was a personal dispute,\" said Dowd, noting that the body was originally buried in a Christian fashion with its head pointing to the west.\n\n\"His family or community must have buried him,\" she added.\n\nDowd told FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree was unaware of the grave.\n\n\"It's completely coincidental - the context is unusual,\" she said.\n\nThere are historical records that say there was a church and graveyard in the area, but there are no remains visible today.\n\nAnother aspect of the excavation is unusual - the young man's height.\n\n\"He's 5-foot-10,\" said Dowd.\n\nFor early medieval society that's pretty tall.\n\nFeds spend $1.5M studying how babies think about food\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) has spent nearly $1.5 million studying how infants think about food.\n\nThe project, \"Infants' and Children's Reasoning About Foods,\" is being conducted by the University of Chicago and so far has determined that young children would rather not eat food that someone has licked or sneezed on.\n\n\"Good nutrition is important for health and longevity, yet many Americans do not consume nutritionally sound diets,\" according to the grant for the project.\n\nEvidence suggests that infants' and children's earliest patterns of eating have lasting consequences for health across the lifespan.\n\nThe premise for the study is that there is a dearth of research about how babies think about eating.\n\n\"Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, developmental psychologists have devoted surprisingly little attention to studying how infants and children perceive, learn, and reason about foods,\" the grant said.\n\nThe current proposal employs methods from cognitive development to test social influences on infants' and children's food choices and consumption.\n\nThe researchers characterize infants as having \"limited knowledge in the food domain.\"\n\nChildren aged three to six years old are \"more knowledgeable than infants and toddlers about foods\" but are \"notoriously picky eaters.\"\n\nFormer 'Star Trek: Voyager' actress charged with indecent exposure in Tennessee\n\nA former actress on the \"Star Trek: Voyager\" television series has been arrested in eastern Tennessee and is accused of exposing herself to children.\n\nMultiple media outlets report that 41-year-old Jennifer Ann Lien, who played \"Kes\" on the TV show, is charged with two misdemeanor counts of indecent exposure involving children under age 13, according to an arrest report.\n\nRoane County Sheriff's Office deputies served the warrants Sept. 3 at Lien's Harriman home, where they say she was naked under a blanket on her couch.\n\nDeputies say Lien refused their requests to get dressed.\n\nHarriman Police Chief Randy Heidle says Lien also faces multiple charges, including aggravated assault, stemming from an April incident in which he says Lien rammed a police cruiser with her vehicle.\n\nIt is unclear if she has an attorney.\n\nPolice identify murder victim found in Epping Forest\n\nA man whose decomposing body was discovered at a woodland beauty spot has been identified.\n\nHidir Aksakal, 53, was found close to Hollow Ponds in Epping Forest, north-east London, on 9 September.\n\nThe Turkish national lived in Margate, Kent, and had close links to the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north London.\n\nHe was last seen in Green Lanes early on Monday 17 August.\n\nA postmortem revealed he was murdered, and detectives said the body could have been in Epping Forest for several weeks.\n\nDCI Jamie Piscopo, from the Metropolitan police, said: \"Mr Aksakal was well known locally as \"Boxer Cetin\" or \"Cetin Boxer\" and we are hopeful that those in the Green Lanes community may have information to help with our investigation.\n\nHollow Ponds is a busy and popular local beauty spot, with a cafe and a boating lake.\n\nIt is also surrounded by a busy roads.\n\nWe would like to speak to anyone who may have been in the area in the last several weeks, and may have witnessed any unusual or suspicious activity, to come and speak to us.\n\nSuper boss: six women on juggling motherhood and work\n\nIn the United States, unlike any other country in the world except Papua New Guinea, a centralized paid maternity leave policy does not exist.\n\nTwo weeks ago, when Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer announced she was pregnant with twins but would be taking very limited maternity leave and \"working throughout\" her time off, the 40-year-old was widely criticized for propagating a culture which expects superwomanhood or nothing.\n\nBut is Mayer, herself the epitome of a woman at the top, to blame for unrealistic expectations?\n\nHow are other women leaders coping?\n\nSeema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of San Francisco's Office of Labor Standards Enforcement, was taking her first steps at a government job in Washington DC a few years ago when her then boss sat her down with an unexpected piece of advice.\n\n\"I don't know anything about you,\" her boss said.\n\nBut if you have any plans to have a family in the future, start saving your leave right now.\n\nPatel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't get a day of paid maternity leave as part of her work arrangement.\n\nBack then, Patel was unmarried and very career-focused, and a family was the last thing on her mind.\n\nBut diligently, she took her boss's word for it.\n\nShe avoided using her sick days over the course of four years so that when she eventually did have her first child two years ago, she had accumulated enough to get three months paid time off.\n\nWhen she had her second baby six months ago, Patel could not pull the same trick.\n\nThe four months she took off were entirely unpaid.\n\nPatel says she experienced no pushback from colleagues, but it is the work structure she has an issue with.\n\n\"I find it extremely unsupportive for anyone trying to have family,\" she says.\n\nIt sends a message: your country does not value you becoming a parent.\n\nKaren Choi, a vice-president at asset management firm Capital Group, says that any working woman who is a mother should be applauded.\n\nChoi, who has four children including a six-month-old baby, describes juggling being a mother and a job \"a constant struggle.\"\n\nSecrets for keeping your head above water include having an \"unbelievably supportive family\" as well as a nanny and babysitter, accepting that there are some areas you are not going to be the best at (\"Not everyone can be the Martha of home décor\"), and simply getting through it.\n\nChoi says she took more maternity leave with every child she had, starting with two and a half months with her first child, and taking six months off with her latest.\n\nThis makes her an exception, especially within her industry.\n\nWhen your child is sick, has fever, is throwing up and you are up all night taking care of your child and knowing that the next morning you have to get your other kids to school and then you have to go to work ...\n\nThat's when it gets to be very challenging,\" she says.\n\nHer firm was supportive, though, and she stresses her investment portfolio's performance did not suffer at all.\n\nWhen she entered the finance industry after university, about 20 or so of her female college mates chose the same path, she says.\n\nToday about 90% of them have left.\n\nWomen who exit jobs and then re-enter are likely to no longer be on track for peak earning positions, she says.\n\nStaying is tough: \"A sacrifice in the short term, but it pays in the long term.\"\n\nIf nothing else, her children have helped provide meaning for this sacrifice, she says, because all four of her children are daughters.\n\nOne of the things that keeps me going is the fact that I would like to be a role model to them.\n\nThe notion of being a role model to her four children is also what drives 48-year-old research scientist and professor Kelly Posner.\n\nThey know that their mom is out there literally helping to save lives.\n\nPosner, who is the founder and director of the Center for Suicide Risk Assessment at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a \"big goal\" career-wise and achieve it.\n\nIt is very important for women to believe that they can have a vision.\n\nMost women do not allow themselves to think that,\" she says.\n\nShe once gave a presentation to 200 people, including government officials in Italy over a webinar while eight months pregnant.\n\nTechnology has also helped, she says, with the ability to stop the car and take a call after picking her kids up, or to answer an email on the go.\n\nJuggling motherhood with a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic, problem-solving disposition, she says - an ability to get through things even when they feel impossible.\n\nJennifer Epps-Addison, 33, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and a mother of two, says that only being able to make career and motherhood work together thanks to private networks of help - like nannies - is wrong.\n\n\"You shouldn't have to get lucky or win the lottery to be able to succeed,\" she says, describing the systemic failure to support women and families - citing oppressively low wages, a flawed health care system and a lack of mandated paid maternity leave.\n\n\"As a society, we are not taking care of each other,\" she says.\n\nWe cannot even guarantee mothers who have just birthed a child to recuperate.\n\nEpps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, gave birth to one of her children while she was on a fellowship.\n\nWith a husband and offspring relying on the healthcare provided by the fellowship, the labor leader was only able to take two weeks maternity leave, she says, before returning to work.\n\nLisa Mosko, a fashion stylist and mother of two, says fewer women would be leaving their professions if more societal support were available in the form of company daycares, keeping to agreed-on schedules, and accepting that good work does not mean overtime.\n\nOn top of logistical constraints, Mosko says she has the added pressure of being in an industry where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of unsophisticated (\"mom clothes\" being among the worst insults).\n\n\"Image is part of your job - it can make or break you,\" she explains.\n\nMosko's \"constant negotiation\" of making her multiple roles work in harmony involves keeping to her chic appearance, beautiful handbag on hand - but sometimes having a toy or two fall out of them.\n\nRemembering men are fathers too might help society cut women some slack, she says.\n\nPeople don't judge men for being bad dads as much as moms.\n\nShola Olatoye, the chair and CEO of New York's housing authority, which houses around 400,000 New Yorkers and employs over 11,000 people, says that talking about \"balance\" is not really what motherhood and career is about.\n\nThe notion of balance is a bit of a misnomer.\n\nIt's more like a seesaw,\" she says.\n\nThe mother of three, including one three-month-old, took just seven weeks maternity leave when she gave birth this year.\n\n\"It was a very important time for the agency,\" she explains.\n\nShe says she knew seven weeks wasn't enough, but her husband was able to take paternity leave and she has been able to have access to a flexible schedule that includes leaving early or coming in later so as to pump milk for her baby.\n\nIndeed Olatoye, who goes on runs with her girlfriends every morning that end at 6am (\"cheaper than therapy\"), is still nursing.\n\nOn the job, she has tried to create an environment that is \"parent-friendly,\" where coming in late because of a kid is fine, and answering emails does not have to be done from within the office walls.\n\n\"The concept and notion of family has changed and is changing so much,\" Olatoye says.\n\n\"The family is very different from what it was like 25, hell, 10 years ago,\" she says.\n\nIt's the workplace that has to adapt.\n\nRussian pranksters say they fooled Elton John with Putin call\n\nTo cynics, it had seemed rather too good to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to Sir Elton John, singer and LGBT campaigner, about gay rights.\n\nUnfortunately for John, it was, in fact, not true: despite an effusive Instagram post in which he thanked the Russian leader for having reached out to him on the issue, it swiftly became clear that, whoever had called him on Monday night, it had not been Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin had already denied all knowledge of the chat.\n\nAnd on Wednesday two famous Russian pranksters stepped forward to claim that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices at the end of the telephone.\n\n\"We thought it wasn't likely that Putin would want to meet with him and call, at least not so quickly,\" said Vladimir \"Vovan\" Krasnov, who said he had impersonated Putin while his co-prankster, Alexei \"Lexus\" Stolyarov, had posed as the president's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov.\n\n\"But it turned out that Elton John was really waiting for this call, and so he immediately believed it really was a conversation with the people who we said we were,\" he told told newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.\n\nHe said: \"Thank you, you've made my day.\"\n\nThis day and this conversation has been the most wonderful and lovely in my life.\n\nAs if to complete John's embarrassment, the pair announced they would broadcast a recording of the conversation on Wednesday on a popular Russian late-night show.\n\nJohn's representatives have not commented on speculation of a hoax.\n\nAt the root of the saga are comments that the singer made at the weekend, in which he called out Putin about his \"ridiculous\" attitude towards gay people while lobbying for LGBT rights in Kiev, criticising in particular a Russian law passed in 2013 which bans the spreading of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations\" among minors.\n\n\"I'd love to meet him [Putin], I'd love to sit down and talk to him,\" John told the BBC, saying that, though the idea was \"probably pie in the sky,\" it was nonetheless worth a try.\n\nThen, on Monday night, the singer elicited incredulity from some observers when he posted a social media message declaring that Putin had responded to his criticisms by picking up the phone.\n\nHe was, he said, \"looking forward to meeting him [the president] face-to-face to discuss LGBT equality in Russia.\"\n\nAlas for John, it was not Putin on the end of the line but Stolyarov and Krasnov, who have prank-called many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.\n\nStolyarov, who speaks English well, had played Peskov and pretended to interpret for the two.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov had told journalists on Tuesday that Putin would be \"ready to meet with Elton John among others to give answers to all the questions that he might ask,\" but said that the Kremlin had not received any requests from the singer.\n\nThe Kremlin had reason to question the Instagram post's authenticity, he added, \"especially because it's not entirely grammatically correct in English.\"\n\nWe don't think that Sir Elton John would have written so ungrammatically.\n\nEven before the Russian duo went public with their hoax, local media had been speculating that John had become the victim of a prank.\n\nSome people online had even identified Krasnov, who is known for fooling politicians with phone calls that he records and posts on his YouTube channel as Vovan222 as the culprit.\n\nPrank-calling public figures and then publishing the recordings has become something of a phenomenon in recent years in Russia.\n\nStolyarov, who is often credited as the father of the genre, has developed a knack for pranking Ukrainian politicians.\n\nHe has been interviewed over the phone on Ukrainian television impersonating Anton Gerashchenko, the outspoken adviser to the interior minister, Arsen Avakov.\n\nHe played Gerashchenko so well that he spoke to the former Dnipropetrovsk governor Ihor Kolomoisky for more than six hours over several days last year.\n\nKrasnov first came to prominence after the parliamentary elections of 2011, which sparked a huge street protest movement after reports of widespread fraud.\n\nPretending to be then president Dmitry Medvedev's aide, Arkady Dvorkovich, he convinced the electoral commission head, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.\n\nBesides numerous Russian celebrities, his victims have also included the former USSR president Mikhail Gorbachev, Kiev mayor and boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, and Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko, whom he tricked into apologising for his athletes\" drunken behaviour.\n\nLast year, Krasnov reportedly called the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, pretending to be the son of the ousted Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nHe was so convincing that the caller on the other end, whose voice sounded like that of Lukashenko, offered asylum.\n\nJohn's initial statement that he wished to speak to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.\n\nThe St Petersburg lawmaker Vitaly Milonov, who helped inspire the gay \"propaganda\" law, told the Guardian that John should not distract Putin with such an \"irrelevant topic\" and that he was ready to meet the singer to explain Russia's position.\n\nThe newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets held an online readers' poll in which 39% of respondents thought Putin and John should meet, while 22% said such a meeting would harm Putin's reputation.\n\nMore people die from air pollution than Malaria and HIV/Aids, new study shows\n\nMore than 3 million people a year are killed prematurely by outdoor air pollution, according to a landmark new study, more than malaria and HIV/Aids combined.\n\nWood and coal burning for heating homes and cooking is the biggest cause, especially in Asia, but the research reveals a remarkably heavy toll from farming emissions in Europe and the US, where it is the leading cause of deaths.\n\nThe report warns that, unless action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths every minute - will double by 2050.\n\n\"This projection should sound alarm bells for public health agencies around the world,\" said environmental health expert Professor Michael Jerrett, at the University of California and who was not involved in the research.\n\nMost air pollution deaths are caused by tiny particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs.\n\nThese cause heart attacks and strokes, which account for three-quarters of the 3.3 million annual deaths, with lung cancer and respiratory diseases responsible for the rest.\n\nThe work did not include the effect of indoor air pollution, from cooking fires for example, which is estimated to cause an additional 3.4 million deaths a year.\n\nThe new work, published in the journal Nature, is the first study to single out different outdoor air pollution sources and estimate the number of premature deaths they each cause, considering road traffic, fossil fuel power stations and other sources.\n\nThe researchers used a detailed computer model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how pollution affects people in China and India.\n\nA third of all premature deaths were the result of using smoky fuels such as wood and coal for heating homes or cooking and using dirty diesel generators for electricity, all well-known hazards.\n\nThis domestic energy use causes half the 645,000 annual deaths in India and a third of the 1.4 million annual deaths in China.\n\nBut the research found that agricultural emissions of ammonia had a \"remarkable\" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld, at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany, who led the research.\n\nA fifth of all global deaths resulted from these emissions, which come mainly from cattle, chickens and pigs and from the over-use of fertiliser.\n\nThe ammonia reacts with fumes from traffic and industry to produce tiny particles and is the largest cause of air pollution deaths in the eastern US, Japan and in Europe.\n\n\"For London, agriculture is the main source,\" said Lelieveld.\n\nAcross the UK, 48% of the premature deaths were ultimately the result of agricultural pollution.\n\nTraffic pollution was still important in developed countries, causing a fifth of deaths, despite crackdowns on dirty vehicles.\n\nIt only caused 5% of deaths across the globe as a whole, but this is likely to rise as more cars take to the road in developing countries.\n\nAir pollution from power stations, mainly coal-burning plants, was significant globally, causing one in seven deaths.\n\nIt is the biggest single factor in the US, causing a third of the 55,000 annual deaths, compared to 16% in the UK.\n\nNatural air pollution, mostly dust in arid regions, caused almost a fifth of global air pollution deaths.\n\nThis source is a major factor in some dry countries, accounting for 92% of deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.\n\n\"The overlap of high pollution and large populations takes a huge toll on public health, but little [was] known about the pollution sources that are responsible for premature deaths,\" said Jerrett.\n\nThe results are surprising and potentially important for protecting public health globally.\n\nCurrently it is assumed that all particulates are equally toxic.\n\nBut if those from fuel burning are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the proportion of premature deaths attributable to farming emissions would be lower.\n\nEven so, Jerrett said, \"the finding is highly valuable ... because agriculture has generally not been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death, and because it suggests that much more attention needs to be paid to agricultural sources, by both scientists and policymakers.\"\n\nDr Oliver Wild, an atmospheric scientist at Lancaster University in the UK said: \"The study really brings home the need for air quality controls to avoid these additional deaths, particularly in heavily populated parts of Asia.\"\n\nA statement of Victor Ponta makes relations with Hungary even more tense\n\nBudapest asks Ponta to stop lying. The Romanian Prime Minister speaks of attitudes reminiscent of Nazism\n\nRelations with Hungary, already tensed after the announcement of the construction of a fence on the border with Romania, after the one on the Serbian border, saw a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta. On Monday, he accused the authorities in Budapest of treating the refugees with violence and \"marking\" them with serial numbers\".\n\nHungarian diplomacy reacted harshly, talking about \"extremist and false\" statements. Victor Ponta strikes back and accuses the government officials of the neighbouring country to be \"a disgrace\" for Europe.\n\nIt should be noted that this it is not the first time Ponta has tried to strain the Romanian-Hungarian relations through statements made in delicate or electoral moments.\n\nIt all started in a statement made Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tries to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.\n\nThe problem is our logistical problem as we want to treat those people as people, not as our Hungarian neighbours treat them with violence, \"marking\" them with serial numbers.\n\nWe do not agree with this.\n\nMr Basescu was put in charge of an ugly horrible feeling which exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic sentiment.\n\nIt's good to have debates, but the burden of solving the problem falls on us.\n\n\"We are going to treat those people like we would treat ourselves\", said Victor Ponta on Monday, quoted by Adevarul.\n\nIt is not clear what Victor Ponta meant when he spoke of serial numbers, but the Czech Republic has recently been in the centre of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of the migrants in several trains, a gesture that recalled of the procedure used by the Nazis to identify the Hebrew prisoners in concentration camps.\n\nAccording to the article of the MTI news agency and picked up by magyaridok.hu, Peter Szijjarto considered that the internal political crises which rocked Victor Ponta's position probably influenced him to make \"extremist and false\" declarations.\n\nThe Romanian charge d'affaires in Budapest was summoned to give explanations, reports Mediafax, citing MTI.\n\n\"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inappropriate statements about how Hungary manages the immigrant crisis\", says the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nLevente Magyar, Secretary of State for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed his \"surprise\" in connection with the \"constant attempts of Victor Ponta to save his controversial moral position with anti-Hungary lies\", emphasizes the diplomacy in Budapest .\n\n\"I do NOT want to respond to the challenges of some Hungarian government representatives - but please read the story below and you will understand the outrage that I feel as a man and an European citizen, in the context of mentalities and attitudes which have beeen seen in Europe only in 1930-1940 !!!\", wrote Ponta on his Facebook page.\n\nHe says that, like other European politicians, he has the \"duty\" to attract attention and sanction the \"constant behaviour of Hungarian government officials of the highest level\" who are \"a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union\" through their \"anti-Semitic attitudes\", \" the way they treat all minorities and now the refugees crisis!\"\n\n\"Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutally will certainly not solve the problem - the only thing this behaviour accentuates is that in the heart of Europe, in Hungary there are policymakers who are no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees are fleeing!\", accused Ponta, saying that he believes in \"solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values \". He also states that \" what we have recently seen in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!\".\n\nIn the evening, Ponta was the guest of Antena 3, where the main topic was Hungary.\n\nIf Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if Hungarian soldiers would start firing or killing children and women, in a speech with several references to Nazism.\n\nThe president of UDMR (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania), Kelemen Hunor, intervened in the debate . He considers that the Romanian authorities should not have an \"emotional approach\" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a fence on the border.\n\nThe leader of UDMR said that what needs to be understood is that this solution is not directed against Romania and the Romanian citizens, stating that the fence might even help our country avoid becoming a route heavily transited by migrants who want to enter the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.\n\nFirstly, I want to emphasize, to state that we should not become hysterical, and take the whole issue as something against Romania and it should not be used to aggravate the not too good relations between the two governments, because it is not the case.\n\nI think any sentimental, visceral approach is wrong.\n\n\"We need to see the rational side of the matter, see why did it come to this and we need to know how to say it. The fence is not against us, is not against Romania and the Romanian citizens and does not prevent free movement between the two countries, in the European Union\", said Kelemen Hunor.\n\nThe West ignored in 2012 Russia's offer to overthrow Bashar al-Assad from ruling Syria\n\nRussia has suggested more than three years ago the removal of President Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace treaty, according to a senior official involved at that time in the closed door negotiations between Western countries and Russia, states The Guardian.\n\nThe former president of Finland and Nobel Peace recipient, Martti Ahtisaari, said the Western powers did not take advantage of that proposal.\n\nFrom 2012 to present day, tens of thousands of people died and millions were forced to flee the country, creating the worst refugee crisis since the end of the Second World War.\n\nAhtisaari held discussions with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (US, UK, France, Russia and China) in February 2012.\n\nHe also said that during the discussions, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, offered a plan that included, among others, the proposal addresses to Assad to step down at some point after the start of the peace treaties between the regime and the opposition.\n\nHe proposed three things:\n\nOne - the opposition should not be armed.\n\nTwo - we must initiate a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.\n\n\"Three - we must find an elegant way for Assad to pull back,\" said Ahtisaari, recounting the Russian ambassador's position.\n\nAhtisaari also said that the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator would fall, that they ignored the Russian Ambassador's proposal.\n\n\"It was a missed opportunity in 2012,\" continued the former president of Finland.\n\nOfficially, Russia firmly supported Bashar al-Assad over the four and a half years of war, insisting that its removal may not represent a proposal in any peace agreement.\n\nAssad believes that Russia will never abandon him.\n\nMoscow recently began sending troops, tanks and military fly machines in Syria, in an effort to stabilize the Assad regime and confront the Islamic State extremists.\n\nThe Internet live program of Antena 3 will be available for a fee\n\nAntena 3 has informed its viewers on Tuesday that starting November 1 its live program can be watched online for a fee on a monthly subscription basis.\n\nIn a \"letter to the viewers\", Intact's news channel said that \"we do this with a heavy hart, and we wish you would stay with us in this new phase imposed by market conditions.\"\n\nAccording to the same letter, the subscription will be 1 euro per month \"for those of you who follow us online\" and the TV station promised that the channel will be broadcast at a very good quality.\n\nAntena 3 claims that \"all these live broadcasts from within the county and abroad, campaigns, everyday news were and are possible due to a consistent financial effort which involved permanent upgrading and focus on quality\".\n\nWe managed to sustain ourselves, given that online and offline retailers have not contributed for the content provided.\n\nThe announcement was made although the news television program is available by subscription on Antena Play online platform, where often recordings of Antena's shows were available.\n\nMarine wildlife populations have halved in the last 40 years, report finds\n\nThe scale of the crisis facing the animals and plants of the sea is documented in detail by the study which claims that marine species around the world, including some that are critical to human food security, are in potentially catastrophic decline.\n\nUnprecedented pressures on the global ocean ecosystem from several directions are combining to create a perfect storm of difficulties for virtually everything that lives in the sea, says the WWF's Living Blue Planet report.\n\nCoral reefs are at serious risk of further decline (WWF) Some marine habitats such as mangroves and seagrasses, on which many other species depend, have seen significant declines, while whole populations of commercially valuable fish, such as mackerel and tuna, have plummeted by as much as three quarters since the 1970s, the report found.\n\nMany coral reefs, often described as the tropical rainforests of the oceans because of their rich diversity of life, could be threatened with extinction by mid-Century if ocean acidity continues to worsen as a result of rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere - which causes a corresponding rise in carbonic acid in the sea.\n\n\"As well as being a source of extraordinary natural beauty and wonder, healthy seas are the bedrock of a functioning global economy,\" said Louise Heaps, chief advisor on marine policy at WWF-UK, who helped to compile the report.\n\n\"By over-exploiting fisheries, degrading coastal habitats and not addressing global warming, we are sowing the seeds of ecological economic catastrophe,\" Dr Heaps said.\n\nThe report, based on a review of the published scientific literature as well as the Living Planet Index, a database maintained by the Zoological Society of London, is one of the most detailed surveys of marine wildlife ever undertaken.\n\nNearly 20 per cent of total mangrove area has been lost between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It investigated a wide range of wildlife, from fish, marine turtles and sea cucumbers - a worm-like animal with leathery skin - to sea plants such as mangroves and sea grasses.\n\nThe report found that seagrass coverage has declined by about 30 per cent over the past century while the total area covered by mangroves has dropped by 20 per cent between 1980 and 2005, primarily as a result of shrimp farming and other forms of aquaculture.\n\nIn the space of a single generation, human activity has severely damaged the ocean by catching fish faster than they can reproduce while also destroying their nurseries.\n\nProfound changes a needed to ensure abundant ocean life for future generations,\" said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International.\n\nSome of the most dramatic declines have been in species fished for commercial gain.\n\nFor instance, some 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - mackerels, tunas and sardines - have fallen by 74 per cent between 1970 and 2010, with no signs of recovery, the report says.\n\nWe are in a race to catch fish that could end with people starved of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.\n\nOverfishing, destruction of marine habitats and climate change have dire consequences for the entire human population, with the poorest communities that rely on the sea getting hit fastest and hardest,\" Mr Lambertini said.\n\n\"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger serious economic decline and undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and malnutrition,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Ken Norris, director of science at the ZL, said: \"These devastating figures reveal how quickly human beings are changing the wildlife in our oceans and are a stark warning of the problems we might face as a result.\"\n\nSeagrasses: Vast underwater \"meadows\" that catch mineral-rich sediments and stabilise the seabed.\n\nCoverage has declined by 30 per cent over the past century.\n\nMangroves: Known to exist in 123 countries, with almost half the coverage in just five nations.\n\nNearly 20 per cent of total mangrove area has been lost between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human encroachment.\n\nCoral reefs: Some of the most biologically rich and productive habitats on earth.\n\nA quarter of all marine species live in or near coral reefs yet three quarters of them are currently threatened and many could be lost this century is ocean acidity continues to worsen.\n\nDeep-sea habitats: Little is known about the deeper parts of the ocean, but the decline in the number of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the past 40 years suggests they are also being affected by global changes to the sea.\n\nSteven Gerrard denies racism claims allegedly made by former Liverpool team-mate El-Hadji Diouf\n\nIn an extract from his upcoming autobiography My Story, serialised by the Daily Mail, Gerrard criticises the Senegalese player for having \"no real interest in football\" and being the signing he \"liked least\" during his 17 years at the club.\n\nIn retaliation, Diouf has been reported to have responded to Gerrard's words on Senegalese radio station Groupe Futurs Medias, with translated quotes attributed to the striker stating that \"Gerrard has never liked black people.\"\n\nGerrard's lawyers have moved to deny any claims he is racist.\n\nIn his latest book, Gerrard, who has publicised his low opinion of Diouf before, criticised his former team-mate's attitude and professionalism.\n\n\"I don't really want to waste time thinking about El Hadji Diouf but it's worth highlighting his wasted seasons at Liverpool as an example of how it can all go wrong,\" he writes.\n\n\"It seemed to me that Diouf had no real interest in football and that he cared nothing about Liverpool,\" he continued.\n\nFor example, the way he spat a huge globule of gunky phlegm at a Celtic fan in a Uefa Cup match at Parkhead in March 2003 summed up his contemptuous and spiteful demeanour.\n\nDiouf proved to be controversial figure during his time at Anfield, with his most notorious night coming at Celtic Park.\n\nThe Senegalese forward was interviewed by police after the spitting incident and fined two weeks wages by his club, with the £60,000 amount being donated to a charity of Celtic's choice.\n\nIn his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard described Diouf as a lazy and self-interested character.\n\n\"His attitude was all wrong,\" Gerrard wrote at the time.\n\nI felt he wasn't really a***d about putting his body on the line to get Liverpool back at the top.\n\nDiouf, who now plays at Malaysian club Sabah, has also criticised Gerrard publicly in the past, as well as attacking Gerrard's long-standing friend and team-mate Jamie Carragher.\n\nIn 2012, Diouf called Gerrard 'egotistical' and claimed that nobody at Anfield likes player who led his side to Champions League victory in 2005.\n\nDiouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is \"jealous.\"\n\nHe said: \"Gerrard is just jealous of me.\n\nHe hasn't achieved what I have done in football.\n\nWhen I came to Liverpool, I came up with the status of boss and he lives there.\n\nI am respected in world football, the greatest football experts have appointed me among the seven best players in the World Cup, the top 100 players of the century.\n\nSeveral big players do not belong.\n\nEverywhere I go out of my country, they worship me - while Gerrard will get abuse whenever he leaves his home city of Liverpool.\n\nFrom hero to hoofer: Alek Skarlatos' speedy path to 'Dancing With the Stars'\n\nAlek Skarlatos doesn't just fill the heroic-man-in-uniform quotient for this season's \"Dancing With the Stars.\"\n\nHe's also a hunky young, athletic guy who's self-effacing and zeitgeisty, producers said.\n\n\"There are a lot of categories he checks off, and we're always looking for that of-the-moment booking,\" said the ABC show's co-executive producer, Deena Katz.\n\nI swear he's going to get an agent out of this.\n\nHe's so charming.\n\nThere's just something about him.\n\nBefore he was a contestant on the hit hoofing show - but only a few weeks before - Skarlatos made international news for taking action in the face of grave danger.\n\nHe and his two childhood friends Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler overpowered a gunman armed with an AK-47 on a packed train from Amsterdam to Paris.\n\nThe trio is credited with stopping what could have been a mass killing by a suspected terrorist.\n\nSkarlatos, a 22-year-old Army National Guardsman who grew up near Sacramento, has since received a call from President Obama, a Twitter shout-out from Donald Trump and a dinner date with Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with decorations from the U.S. military and the French government.\n\nThough he might've anticipated a few local accolades - there was a parade in the young men's honor in Sacramento on Friday -- he didn't expect the breadth of well wishes or the \"Dancing With the Stars\" invitation.\n\n\"Never in a million years did I think I'd get that offer,\" Skarlatos said Saturday during a break in dance practice with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.\n\nIt's all brand new and crazy to me.\n\nWhile he admitted to being \"a little nervous\" before Monday night's show, he handled his first foxtrot like a professional, earning scores that put him near the top of the competitive heap.\n\nJudges Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough said he gave one of the standout performances of the night.\n\nKatz and \"DWTS\" executive producer Rob Wade said they like to keep a spot open on the show for last-minute contestants, such as Skarlatos, who have vaulted into the public eye.\n\nIn this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation who tackled a shooter mid-attack on a 500-passenger train and immediately thought about getting one of them on the dance competition.\n\nShe scoured social media, tracked down family members and started sending messages to Skarlatos.\n\nWhen he appeared on \"Good Morning America\" to discuss the incident, during which Stone and several other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the sister ABC program to cut through the media firestorm.\n\nShe made her \"five-minute elevator pitch,\" and then waited anxiously to learn if Skarlatos would agree to be on \"DWTS.\"\n\n\"It was touch-and-go there for a while because this is so out of his element,\" Katz said.\n\nHe was just serving in Afghanistan not long ago, and now we're asking if he's ready to cha cha.\n\nSkarlatos, who's taking a short leave from the National Guard, hadn't even watched an entire episode of the show until recently.\n\nHe was on the fence about participating, mainly because he didn't want to be singled out.\n\nThe series couldn't accommodate all three friends.\n\nBut producers had an ace-in-the-hole: Noah Galloway, a military vet and double amputee.\n\nThey encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, fan favorite competitor and finalist from last season, and ask about his experience.\n\nThat may have been the tipping point, along with Katz's relentless \"stalking\" and \"psycho texting,\" she said.\n\n\"Noah's a great guy, and I wanted to know how the military would be portrayed and how my friends\" images would be protected,\" Skarlatos said.\n\nHe told me I should do it.\n\nSo after that conversation, I said yes.\n\nSkarlatos, an avid sportsman and history buff, has never danced before, and Arnold has said in interviews that she's been trying to get him to loosen his rather stiff military posture.\n\nBut Katz said she's confident he will adapt and that viewers will respond to him.\n\nHe'll get so much love in the beginning because people are proud of him and what he's just done.\n\n\"How can you not root for him?\", Katz said.\n\nBut that'll only last a few weeks.\n\nHe'll have to dance to keep going.\n\nSkarlatos, who's single and plans eventually to become a police officer, said he's enjoyed himself so far in the completely unfamiliar arena.\n\nScheduling has been the toughest battle, with frequent trips to Los Angeles between his media whistle-stop tour and various awards ceremonies.\n\nHe'd said in late August, on returning to the U.S. just after the train takedown, that he wanted some R&R at home with his family.\n\n\"That lasted about a day and a half,\" he said.\n\nI think I've been home about four days total.\n\nThere's a risk in snagging a newsworthy person who isn't accustomed to being in the spotlight, executive producer Wade said.\n\nAnd the show wants to make sure the contestant can do well and have some fun.\n\n\"This is a lot of pressure, and we want people to have a good experience,\" Wade said.\n\n\"We'd never want Alek to say, \"What have I gotten myself into?\"\n\nFingers crossed he has a good time.\n\nThe McDonald's McRib is back.\n\nFor those who wait all year for the pork patty shaped like a mini rack of ribs, here's your chance to go nuts.\n\nBut is it harder to find this year?\n\nCNBC is reporting that only 55% of the McDonald's franchises in the country are offering the seasonal special.\n\nLast year, 75% of the restaurants served the McRib.\n\n\"For the 2015 McRib promotion there are nearly 8,000 participating restaurants,\" McDonald's spokesperson Lisa McComb told The Times in an email.\n\nThere are a little more than 14,300 locations of the fast-food restaurant in the U.S.\n\nBut according to McComb, it's the individual franchise owners who decide on serving the McRib or not.\n\n\"This participation isn't significantly different than last year,\" said McComb.\n\nOwner/operators are free to offer the menu items they feel their local customers will want.\n\nAnd if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's attempted to explain its ingredients last year with a mythbuster video.\n\nAccording to the video, the McRib patty is made with pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.\n\nThe sandwich will be available at participating McDonald's locations through the end of the year.\n\nThere's also a McRib locator website (not affiliated with McDonald's), that can help.\n\nPeople can report McRib sightings on the website and look for the sandwich near them.\n\nHowever, a quick search on the website shows the nearest McRib to Los Angeles is in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, spotted last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.\n\nSometimes, I just can't fight the craving for BBQ chicken pizza.\n\nKeith Richards hints at new Rolling Stones recordings\n\nKeith Richards is back in the spotlight with a new solo album and documentary feature, but soon the rest of the Rolling Stones might be joining him in the studio.\n\nRichards announced that he and the rest of the Stones -- Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood -- recently met up in London and made, as he put it, \"definite plans to record.\"\n\nRichards was speaking as part of the iHeartRadio ICONS series with interviewer Jim Kerr on Tuesday night.\n\nA potential new Stones album would be the group's first LP since 2005's \"A Bigger Bang.\"\n\nBut the band has been far from idle.\n\nThey've toured stadiums extensively in recent years, and played several small shows around L.A., including stops at the Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.\n\nAt the latter, they revisited their 1971 classic LP \"Sticky Fingers.\"\n\nRichards has been particularly busy this year, collaborating on a documentary feature \"Keith Richards: Under the Influence\" scheduled for a Sept. 18 release on Netflix.\n\nThis year he also released a solo album \"Crosseyed Heart,\" his third solo outing in a five-decade career.\n\nThe Times' Randy Lewis described Richards' new album in an early interview with the guitarist: \"As always, Richards' ragged voice is an instrument that's more serviceable than distinguished....\"\n\nYet Richards gets emotions across in the album's 15 songs, and that's always been what rock 'n' roll is about.\n\nIn the interview, Richards said that the band will likely get into the studio after a South American tour early next year.\n\nHe didn't offer other details, but judging by their recent shows the band still has plenty of life left in it.\n\nToronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman on childhood, adulthood and 'The Family Fang'\n\nJason Bateman has already navigated a few tricky transitions in his career with a low-key charm that has made it look far easier than it must have actually been.\n\nOnce a child actor on such television shows as \"Silver Spoons,\" as an adult he reemerged as a deadpan everyman on TV's \"Arrested Development\" and in films such as \"Horrible Bosses.\"\n\nHis first film as director was the very acerbic comedy \"Bad Words,\" in which he also starred.\n\nThe film was picked up out of the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.\n\nBateman was back in Toronto earlier this week with his second film as director, the tonally ambitious \"The Family Fang,\" an adaption of Kevin Wilson's popular 2011 novel with a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize winner David Lindsay-Abaire and starring Nicole Kidman alongside Bateman as troubled siblings.\n\nThe film is playing the festival looking for U.S. distribution.\n\nMany notices for the book pinned it as a comedy with deeper emotional currents; the film recasts the story somewhat by emphasizing its darker, more dramatic heft.\n\nIn an interview here Tuesday, Bateman said he always saw the material as more dramatic than comedic.\n\n\"I never read the book in that way,\" he said.\n\nFrom the book, the subject matter and themes were always very dramatic and very human.\n\nI thought that Kevin was addressing something that was pretty emotional in a very entertaining way.\n\nSo that was always the order that I saw things, a drama that had some moments of levity and comedy and eccentricity.\n\nMonday night's world premiere screening was introduced by the festival's director of programming, Kerri Craddock, who expressed particular enthusiasm for Bateman's late-'80s/early-'90s sitcom \"The Hogan Family\" -- \"I haven't met a lot of \"Hogan Family\" fans,\" Bateman noted dryly when he came onstage.\n\nYet it was directing a few episodes of that show that got Bateman, now 46, into the Director's Guild at the age of 18.\n\nThe story of his new film revolves around a family with the last name of Fang.\n\nThe parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are performance artists of moderate reputation, best known for the way in which they used their children Annie and Baxter in their pieces, such as staging a bank robbery over lollipops or being purposefully terrible street musicians.\n\nAnnie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) have subsequently struggled to find their own identities in adulthood.\n\nAnnie is an actress of some notoriety, though as much for her public meltdowns as her performances, while Baxter is a struggling novelist and magazine journalist.\n\nWhen Caleb and Camille disappear under mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter are suspicious that this is just another stunt, and they set about trying to discover the truth about their parents and find out some new truths about themselves.\n\nIt is perhaps not difficult to see what in that storyline of child performers moving forward with their adult lives may have spoken directly and deeply to Bateman.\n\n\"My upbringing as a child was very atypical,\" Bateman said.\n\nStarted acting when I was 10, my parents being my manager, there's a lot of overlap in this film from the way in which I was brought up.\n\nSo this was something I certainly didn't see as some kind of surface piece of entertainment.\n\n\"It's something I had a full connection to and a deep understanding of,\" he added, \"and although I didn't try to drag any of my own personal baggage into it, I certainly had a clear idea of what a version of this film might look and feel like if it were to represent children who had a nontraditional upbringing.\"\n\nThe project began with Kidman, also a producer on the film, acquiring the rights to Wilson's book.\n\nWhen Wilson declined to write the adaption himself, Lindsay-Abaire, who adapted his own \"Rabbit Hole,\" which Kidman starred in, was brought on.\n\nBateman, as he says, raised his hand for the chance to direct and costar.\n\n(Kidman, currently onstage in London in a production of \"Photograph 51,\" was not in attendance at Monday's premiere.\n\nThe book's author was among those in the audience.)\n\nIn the Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film a \"smart, tart adaptation\" that \"thumbs its nose at the clichés of the over-trafficked dysfunctional family genre to dissect the sometimes lifelong quest of children to understand their parents in ways that are funny and bittersweet, poignant and often bracingly dark.\"\n\nIn Variety, Justin Chang called the film \"a sharply drawn portrait\" and that Bateman \"shows marked progress and deepening maturity as a filmmaker with this cleverly structured but never arch or mechanical adaptation.\"\n\nAfter the film on Monday, as Bateman and Walken stepped onstage for a Q&A, there was a standing ovation for the much-beloved Walken.\n\nOf observing Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the Q&A that \"I was impressed every day.\n\nI couldn't believe it, the ease with which he went back and forth between directing the movie, which is a handful, and playing the scenes.\n\nHis focus and concentration, really, it's amazing.\n\nIn one dialogue scene in particular, Bateman stands on a staircase in the family home in the back of the frame, obscured in darkness, just a shadow in profile, while Kidman is closer to the camera and seen more clearly.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor debating with Bateman the director over the fact he can't be seen.\n\n\"Directing films is incredibly exciting to me,\" Bateman said.\n\nAll my decisions come from that place, it's never to serve me as an actor.\n\nTo have the privileged position of being the guy who is responsible for shaping the entire experience for an audience as opposed to being just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, it's all-encompassing.\n\nRegardless of whether that ... actor wants a close-up.\n\nBateman said in the Q&A that when he read the script, he immediately thought of Walken to play the part of Caleb, but also that he hoped for composer Carter Burwell for the score.\n\nBest known for his long-standing relationship with the Coen brothers, Burwell also scored two other films at the Toronto festival, Charlie Kaufman's and Duke Johnson's stop-motion-animation story of love and isolation, \"Anomalisa,\" and Brian Helgeland's telling of the 1960s English gangster twins Ronnie and Reggie Kray in \"Legend.\"\n\nBurwell composed the score for Todd Haynes\" upcoming \"Carol\" as well.\n\n\"Things that have an oblong or obtuse tone are very interesting to me,\" Bateman said, expanding on the idea on Tuesday.\n\nNavigating those tones and delivering an audience, hopefully seamlessly, somewhat elegantly, from one tone to the next throughout the film.\n\nCarter has made a career and an incredible reputation as somebody who can navigate the most complicated of tones.\n\nBoth as director and actor, with \"The Family Fang,\" Bateman has taken another bold step in a career that is full of self-aware reinvention and determination, a mix of comedy and drama, lightness and dark.\n\nAs Bateman said while finishing his introduction to the film at Monday's world premiere, \"It turned out exactly the way I wanted it to, for better or worse.\"\n\nFestival is Oscar-buzzing about this tale of the Boston Globe's investigation into pedophile priests\n\nHave you won $240,000 in the lotto?\n\nA X-LOTTO ticket worth more than $240,000 has been left unclaimed for a month.\n\nThe unregistered X-Lotto draw ticket was bought at Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday, August 15.\n\nAlongside the winning ticket sold in South Australia, there were 16 other winning entries across Australia, which shared in X-Lotto's estimated $4 million division one prize pool.\n\nSA Lotteries is urging anyone who purchased a X-Lotto entry at Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check their entries as soon as possible.\n\nThe winning numbers in X-Lotto draw 3555 on Saturday, August 15, were 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.\n\nThe supplementary numbers were 43 and 27.\n\nIngle Farm Lotteries Kiosk manager Kath Venables said she was eagerly waiting to hear the good news that the outlet's winner had checked their X-Lotto ticket.\n\n\"We've been busy spreading the word because someone out there is our division one winner and they may have no idea it's them,\" she said.\n\nMajor Crime detectives search house on Beadell St, Burton, where missing man Daniel Hind was last seen\n\nMr Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said the wait for information about her missing brother was frustrating, particularly because police had been given two different accounts of his movements on the night he was last seen.\n\nShe said her family had been asking police to search the home since her brother's disappearance.\n\n\"We were hoping they were going to search the house, we weren't told they were going to do it,\" she said.\n\nMs Hind said her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak up and be truthful with the police.\n\n\"We just want to know where Daniel is, and what he did that night,\" she said.\n\nThere are four of us kids and quite a few extra family members and about half think he's alive somewhere and the other half don't think he is.\n\nEither way, we want him home for some closure.\n\nBulgaria to Add 635 Km Motorways by 2022\n\nBulgaria's government plans to build 635 kilometers of new motorways and repair 17,000 of existing main and secondary roads until 2022.\n\nCompleting the construction of Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all of them parts of pan-European transport corridors, is among the priorities in a road infrastructure development plan approved by the government on Wednesday.\n\nThe plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network as well as ensure high road safety and efficient management of road transport, the government said in a statement.\n\nBulgaria Is Transit Country for Trafficking in Cultural Goods from Syria\n\nBulgaria is a transit country for the illicit trafficking of stolen cultural goods from the Middle East due to its key geographic location, according to Interior Minister Rumyana Bachvarova.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday at a conference on the fight against looting of Syria's cultural heritage, Bachvarova reminded that Bulgaria's national legislation had been adjusted to the new circumstances, featuring an emphasis on the ban on cross-border trade from Syria and Iraq.\n\nBachvarova, as cited by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency (BTA), stated that the efforts of the competent units of the Interior Ministry and most of all the Chief Directorate \"Combating Organized Crime\" (GDBOP) were focused on preventing the illegal smuggling and sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.\n\nShe declared that Bulgaria was a country with a rich history, with recent surveys placing it third, after Italy and Greece, by trafficking of cultural goods and objects.\n\nBulgaria's Interior Minister said that the trafficking in cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites located in zones such as Iraq and Syria was a phenomenon that was gaining momentum and was described as an exceptionally serious war crime.\n\nShe insisted that concerted and decisiove actions were necessary to stop the ongoing deliberate destruction of history.\n\nUNESCO Director General Irina Bokova noted that footage of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria showed that the country was plagued by industrial scale looting.\n\nThe participants in Wednesday's conference agreed that Syria's cultural heritage was seriously endangered and that the international community had to unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods from the war-torn country.\n\nAerojet Rocketdyne says new AR-1 engine timetable could slip\n\nAerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it expected to complete its new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a soon-to-be banned Russian engine, but the date could slip if it does not receive enough U.S. government funding.\n\nAerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck declined comment on reports that Aerojet has offered $2 billion to acquire United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 rocket launch venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.\n\nAnalysts say the bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to shut out rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, that is developing a new engine favored by ULA for use in its new Vulcan rocket.\n\nULA has said Blue Origin's engine program is about two years ahead of Aerojet's work on the AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet disputes.\n\nWork on the new engines gained urgency after U.S. lawmakers passed a ban on use of Russian RD-180 engines for launches of U.S. military or spy satellites following Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine last year.\n\nVan Kleeck said the company was testing hardware for the engine, which is being designed with 3D-printed parts to fit into both ULA's Atlas 5 rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket that ULA is developing at a cost of about $1 billion.\n\nAerojet says it would be less costly and risky to integrate its engine into the Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a wholly new engine and rocket, as ULA currently plans.\n\nVan Kleeck said Aerojet planned to begin testing full scale engines in 2017, followed by certification in 2019, but the date could slip if the company did not receive enough funding from the Air Force in contract awards expected late in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which begins Oct.\n\nShe said the company was eager to see how the Air Force split funding of about $160 million among rival bidders.\n\nShe said Aerojet was also exploring other private funding options for the engine but gave no details.\n\nThe Air Force competition is a public-private partnership, with each of the bidders asked to provide one-third of the funding, with the Air Force to provide a two-third"
