        "text": "The official name is Serban Voda Cemetery!\n\nThis is Bucharest’s most historic cemetery. To visit it all it might take up to half a day! Of course, a normal tour would normally last about 1h 30- 2h.\n\nThere is a map inside the gate, that points out important graves!\n\nEspecially relevant: most of the graves are grouped by profession – artists in one part, writers in another etc.\n\nConsequently, a good place to start is the Alley of Artists!\n\nPhotography wise, you need an acceptance (permit) you can get at the entrance.\n\nVisiting hours: 10 a.m – 8 p.m\n\nPhone: 021 332 5744\n\nWhy visit a cemetery?\n\nToday cemeteries are the outcasts in a culture obsessed with perpetual youth. Except perhaps for places such as Arlington National Cemetery (In U.S), or Pere Lachaise (in France), or Romania’s own Merry Cemetery from Sapinta, Maramures.\n\nExcept perhaps for places such as Arlington National Cemetery (In U.S), or Pere Lachaise (in France), or Romania’s own Merry Cemetery from Sapinta, Maramures.\n\nYet, as a Bucharest enthusiast, I would invite tourist of all ages to take some time and visit this hidden cultural trove- the Bellu cemetery.\n\nBy walking through this cemetery, you can tell that Bucharest has been quite a sophisticated place.\n\nThe central chapel (which keeps the same hours as the cemetery itself), was built in the 1880s. Its style is similar to one of the cathedrals at Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary). While it is no Sistine chapel, it is still boasting stunning interior paintings.\n\nIn conclusion, visiting a cemetery is not necessarily all about paying respects and reflecting about future. You could learn a lot about a country’s culture, and history at the same time.\n\nAbout Bellu Cemetery\n\nThe place is better known by its popular name “Bellu Cemetery” (rather than the official “Serban Voda Cemetery”). This is because this cemetery is situated on a land a plot of land donated by Baron Barbu Bellu in 1858.\n\nMany artists and important politicians are buried here. Of course , this means that great funeral monuments and beautiful sculptures with quite a lot of stories are scattered all over the alleys.\n\nPart of this cemetery resembles an outdoor museum.\n\nIn conclusion, if you have the time, then we believe you should visit it. ( Do this preferably on a weekday when you’re not rushed because on weekends there are lots of ceremonies in all Romanian cemeteries and they can become anything but quiet places).\n\nWhy visit Bellu cemetery in Bucharest?\n\nHere are some reasons why visiting Bellu cemetery is a thing to do in Bucharest:\n\nThis is the Bucharest’s most prestigious burial ground. It is often called “outdoor museum”, one of Romania’s history pages”.\n\nFurthermore, it houses the tombs of many notable Romanian personalities. From writers, poets, songwriters, and artists to politicians and diplomats of Romania, and also, inventors, mathematicians, flight pioneers and so on and so forth.\n\nIt has 54 acres of one of the most authentic cultural attractions in Bucharest. Thus visiting it is one of the recommended things to do in Bucharest, especially if you are passionate about culture and history.\n\nThe unique opportunity of seeing a snapshot of time, complete with all the trappings of historical and social customs, before it disappears through neglect or destruction.\n\nHow to get to Bellu Cemetery\n\nAdress: Calea Şerban Vodă, nr.249, sector 4\n\nPublic transportation:\n\nBus number 116, 141, 232, 323;\n\nTramway : 4, 11,7,19, 25\n\nSubway station: Eroii Revoluţiei\n\nLandmarks near Bellu cemetery\n\nThe Bellu cemetery is within walking distance from several other places:"
