        "text": "During the archaeological campaign of 2012 in the area of the Sultana-Ghețărie flat settlement, Mânăstirea commune, Călăraşi county, an inhumation grave belonging to the Gumelnița culture was discovered. The grave contained the skeleton in anatomical connection and moderate state of preservation, laid in a lateral foetal position, on the left side, oriented E – W. The legs were accentuated flexed. The both arms were bent with the hand towards the skull. The funerary inventory consists in a bi-lobed needle and a stone axe. The unusual location of this isolated grave will be discussed in this article.\n\nThe use of interdisciplinary methods in researching the XII th grave from the V th tumulus in Cimișlia, attributed to the Belozerka culture, has yielded important data that significantly enriched the information obtained from the archaeological research of this funerary complex. Beyond archaeological research methods, the discovered materials have been analysed from a paleoanthropological and palynological standpoint. The chemical composition of a bronze artefact was determined, and the wood from the cover of the funeral chamber was dated using radiocarbon dating. Thus, by combining data from archaeological research and interdisciplinary studies, we can conclude that in the middle of the 13 th century BC, in the mantle of a tumulus located in the meadow of the Cogâlnic River, the burial of a male individual, who was about 50 years old at the time of death, was performed. The funerary inventory of the grave, in addition to ceramic vessels, also included a bronze knife, in the alloy of which copper is the main component, with tin and lead present in smaller quantities. The wooden arrangement inside the funeral chamber may imitate a living structure. Over the excavated soil from the grave, a layer of manure formed during the months of May and June was deposited.\n\nThe paper presents the results of the anthropological analyses of the four Bronze Age graves discovered in 2006 at Fântânele-Între Acăţi. The cremated remains of the deceased were placed in funerary urns, the analyses proving a low combustion temperature, generally between 525 and 645 °C. A child, a young adult and two adults over the age of 30 were identified; in one case (grave no. 3) sex determination was possible, verifying male's features. During the anthropological analyses, among the human bones from grave no. 1 the fragments of a perforated bone artefact were found. Most probably, it was a personal jewellery item or garment accessory, burnt on the funerary pyre together with the deceased. The object is one of the few bone artefacts found in an early Wietenberg incineration grave."
