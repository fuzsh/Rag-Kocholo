        "text": "1 THE INTERNATIONAL WRITING PROGRAM (1967-­‐1988) Paul Engle FLASHBACKS OF 21 YEARS' <strong>IWP</strong> When a devastating earthquake struck Bucharest a few years ago, a Rumanian novelist walking along the street on his way to a party (the occupational danger of writers) was killed as a building fell on him. He had just written a letter to Iowa. Across the city another writer was at his desk writing a chapter of his book about the life he had led with his beautiful poet-­‐wife in Iowa City. When the apartment building shattered, he fell six stories. He was pinned by a steel beam until night when soldiers came by with a bullhorn, shouting to find any persons alive in the ruins. In his hand was the chapter on Iowa, the only thing he could grab when he felt himself falling. Some time later all the writers in Bucharest who had lived in Iowa City held a memorial party to honor their dead friend-­‐-­‐who was also our friend-­‐-­‐with plenty of strong local brandy. Why had so many of the best Rumanian writers been to a small town in the Midwest of America, not the sort of place where the world's artists, or even the world's business executives, meet annually to discuss their craft? They came (and happily, still come) to be members of the <strong>International</strong> <strong>Writing</strong> <strong>Program</strong>, joining thirty to forty others each year from all parts of the world. How did they come? Certainly they did not travel to Iowa on their own. Very few writers in very few countries can afford plane tickets, especially for flights over the great oceans. This is how they came. How Did It Happen? \"Crazy! That's one of the craziest ideas I've ever heard,\" I shouted to Hualing in the motorboat taking us up the Coralville Reservoir north of Iowa City, an artificial lake made by a dam on the Iowa River. It was in the summer, 1966. At my voice, a great blue heron stopped fishing along the shallow waters by the rivers edge and, with a lunge expressing its contempt for such a notion, lifted into the air and flew away, each beat of its big wings seeming to cry, \"Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!\" What remark had made man and nature conspire to reject that simple, imaginative, and as it turned out very sensible question? Hualing was born in Hubei in Central China on the Yangzi River, survived the Japanese War (going up the river to Zhongqing in a boat pulled by men with ropes, threatened by Japanese planes overhead and hidden rocks underneath), survived the bombings, graduated from Nanjing University, and then survived the Civil War. Going to Taiwan in 1949, she began her career as a novelist and later taught at National Taiwan University and Tung-­‐hai University in the middle of the island, where she was the first person to"
