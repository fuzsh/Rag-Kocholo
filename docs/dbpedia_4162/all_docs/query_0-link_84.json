It discusses the policy concerning music, the greatest Eastern European stars, such as Karel Gott, Czesław Niemen and Omega, as well as DJs and the music press. By conducting original research, including interviews and examining archival material, the authors take issue with certain assumptions prevailing in the existing studies on popular music in Eastern Europe, namely that it was largely based on imitation of western music and that this music had a distinctly anti-communist flavour. Instead, they argue that self-colonisation was accompanied with creating an original idiom, and that the state not only fought the artists, but also supported them. The collection also draws attention to the foreign successes of Eastern European stars, both within the socialist bloc and outside of it.\n\nv>\n\nE-Book Content\n\nPop Music, Culture and Identity Series Editors Steve Clark Graduate School Humanities and Sociology University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan Tristanne Connolly Department of English, St Jerome’s University Waterloo, Ontario, Canada Jason Whittaker School of English & Journalism, University of Lincoln Lincoln, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom\n\nPop music lasts.

Its roots lie in frustration at the limited amount of scholarly work available in English concerning popular music in Eastern Europe and the perspective applied in the majority of them. The number of volumes devoted to popular music originating from, and consumed in countries such as Poland, Hungary or East Germany is low, not only in comparison with books about music in the Anglo-American centre but also with what is known as ‘world music’. It also rarely happens that music from this part of the world is used to illustrate phenomena pertaining to popular music at large, such as stars, genres, music videos, live music, subcultures or local identity. The only exception is when authors discuss the relationship between music and politics (for example, Szemere 1992; Wicke 1992; Wicke and Shepherd 1993; Mitchell 1996: 95-136; Bennett 2000: 49; Connell and Gibson 2003: 120–21), due to the fact that rock E.

MAZIERSKA\n\nfrom Eastern Europe is seen as more political than its western counterpart; an opinion which is problematic. Moreover, existing studies focused on Eastern European popular music, most importantly Timothy Ryback’s Rock Around the Bloc (1990) and the collection Rocking the State: Rock Music and Politics in Eastern Europe and Russia (1994), edited by Sabrina Petra Ramet, are based on problematic assumptions which, broadly speaking, reﬂect a way of thinking pertaining to the Cold War, even if they were already written and published after the fall of state socialism. This collection has the ambition to interrogate and challenge these assumptions.\n\nFROM SELF-COLONISATION TO PARTICIPATION IN COSMOPOLITAN CULTURE One of the assumptions made in existing studies concerns the allegedly marginal status of Eastern European popular music not only globally, but also within the Eastern bloc. Ryback and Ramet argue that, whenever permitted, consumers of popular music from Hungary, Poland or Romania tuned into the media broadcasting western music rather than choosing performers addressing them in their own language. In the introduction to Rock Around the Bloc Ryback evokes a meeting of Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev with the widow of John Lennon, Yoko Ono, in which the then Soviet leader and his spouse present themselves as Lennon’s fans. Ryback also mentions the Beatlemania in Poland, East Germany and the Czech Republic, concluding that: Western rock culture has debunked Marxist-Leninist assumptions about the state’s ability to control its citizens. Across more than eight thousand miles of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, from the cusp of the Berlin Wall to the dockyards of Vladivostok, three generations of young socialists, who should have been bonded by the liturgy of Marx and Lenin, have instead found common ground in the music of the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. (Ryback 1990: 5)\n\nRamet muses: ‘A Yugoslav poll taken in late 1988 found that Eric Clapton, a rock guitarist, was one of the people most admired by young people and that he was more popular among the young than was Serbian party boss Slobodan Milošević.’ Later she adds, ‘There is one ﬁgure who casts a long shadow over the entire East European (and Russian) rock\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nscene and who served as an inspiration to an entire generation: former Beatle John Lennon’ (Ramet 1994: 6). Such claims, although they might be factually correct, lead to questionable conclusions, such as that Lennon and Clapton were more popular in the East than local stars and that throughout its history the state socialist East remained under the spell of a limited number of iconic western stars, hence being doubly backward, by being unable to develop its own rock culture and having limited access to western rock. Instead, the Gorbachevs’ tender recollection of Lennon might reﬂect more their generation (being born in the 1930s), their limited knowledge of pop-rock, and their politeness towards their visitor than the true standing of Lennon in the Soviet bloc at the time of Yoko Ono’s visit. Clapton’s greater popularity among young Serbians than Milošević, in my opinion, merely points to the well-known fact that young people (especially after the end of the 1960s) have shown little interest in politics and hence politicians cannot compete with pop stars as role models. If the West provided the East with the only acceptable cultural model, as above-mentioned authors argue, then popular music of any value originating from this region was a product of imitation. Given that during the Cold War the socialist East and the capitalist West were in conﬂict, the character of such music was oppositional. Rock stars were heroes and martyrs, ‘rocking the state’, as the title of Ramet’s collection announces, ﬁghting with the Leninist ideologues and politicians. In the most extreme version of this view, as proposed by Ramet, ‘the archetypal rock star became, symbolically, the muse of revolution. The decaying communist regimes (in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania especially) seemed to fear the electric guitar more than bombs and riﬂes’ (Ramet 1994: 2).1 According to this narrative, if such stars stayed in their own countries, rather than escaping to the West, this was either because they were locked behind the Iron Curtain or felt responsible for revolutionising the masses, rather than because working for the eastern culture industry brought them some beneﬁts, outstripping the potential advantages of working in the West. By the same token, listeners tuned into their stars to capture the sounds of revolution or at least political subversion. This also means that if a given state was seen as particularly totalitarian, there was no pop-rock worthy of its name, as Ramet argues in relation to Albania and Romania (Ramet 1994: ix). These assumptions have been labelled as ‘self-colonisation’ and ‘political subversion versus state propaganda’. The argument in this book is not that they are false, but that they are simplistic and prevent us from appreciating\n\n4\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\nEastern European popular music in its richness and complexity, including its artistry. At the same time as projecting the Eastern European rocker as an anti-communist ﬁghter, they render the consumer of such music as a machine for capturing political (sub)text, rather than boys and girls searching for entertainment, for whom catchy melody is more important than the message of a song. In this context it is worth mentioning Simon Firth referring to a survey of high school students that was carried out in Michigan in the 1970s which concluded that ‘the vast majority of teenage listeners are unaware of what the lyrics of hit protest songs are about’ (Robinson and Hirsch, quoted in Frith 2007: 95). If listeners in Eastern Europe were similar in this respect to their American peers, then the researchers’ excessive preoccupation with the political content of pop music from this region by-passes the most important part of their experience. To move away from the ‘self-colonisation’ paradigm, a different framework is proposed by considering Eastern European popular music as an articulation of local culture and an act of participation in the global phenomenon of popular music, and especially in what Motti Regev describes as pop-rock. In relation to the ﬁrst point authors such as Martin Stokes (2003a, 2003b), Tony Mitchell (1996), Andy Bennett (2000), and the author’s own work (2015) are followed. These authors propose to divert from the colonial discourse or even its speciﬁc form, ‘cultural imperialism’, according to which Anglo-American pop-rock ‘displace and appropriate authentic representations of local and indigenous music into packed commercial music commodiﬁed for ethnically indeterminate, but predominantly Anglocentric and Eurocentric’ markets (Mitchell 1996: 1). Instead, they suggest that the ‘imperial’ inﬂuences are always reworked at a local level, leading to producing music which reﬂects and addresses local needs and sensibilities, as well as global trends. It is worth mentioning that in the context of popular music in Eastern Europe the term ‘cultural imperialism’ is especially problematic, because, to the vast majority of those listening to western stations broadcasting Anglo-American music, it was not a vehicle of malevolent western powers, but a gentle instrument of enlightenment which was accepted with gratitude, as the term ‘self-colonisation’ reﬂects. However, what the proponents of the ‘cultural imperialism’ thesis and the advocates of ‘self-colonisation’ have in common is the emphasis on what is taken from the West, rather than how it is relocated and reworked in a new context. By contrast, in this collection, the local context will be foregrounded. Regev is more interested in the global, rather than a local facet of popular music, seeing pop-rock as pertaining to late modernity and consisting of a\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nprocess of intensiﬁed aesthetic proximity, overlap, and connectivity between nations and ethnicities or, at the very least, between prominent large sectors within them. It is a process in which the expressive forms of cultural practices used by nations at large (and by groupings within them), to signify and perform their sense of uniqueness, come to share large proportions of aesthetic common ground, to a point where the cultural uniqueness of each nation or ethnicity cannot but be understood as a unit within one complex entity, one variant in a set of quite similar (although never identical) cases. Aesthetic cosmopolitanisation is a term that is best suited to depict this process in world culture [and it] refers to the ongoing formation, in late modernity, of world culture as one complexly interconnected entity, in which social groupings of all types around the globe growingly share wide common grounds in their aesthetic perceptions, expressive forms, and cultural practices. Aesthetic cosmopolitanism refers, then, to the already existing singular world culture (Regev 2013: 3). There are several advantages to applying the concept of aesthetic cosmopolitanism to the phenomena of pop-rock culture in Eastern Europe under state socialism. First, automatically condemning it to the position of a poor relation of music produced in the Anglo-Saxon world is avoided, even if it is widely acknowledged that it has played a privileged role in the global culture of pop-rock (Bennett 2000: 53). Second, it allows one to draw on research about other forms of popular culture produced in Eastern Europe, most importantly cinema, which is typically seen not as an imitator of western culture, but as an autonomous product developing according to its own logic and contributing to global culture along the lines proposed by Regev. Third, by seeing Eastern European popular music as a form of global pop-rock, rather than an imitation, various similarities between popular music can be accounted for within the whole Eastern bloc, and problems with assessing the meaning of the (relatively rare) cases when western artists borrow music from the East can be avoided, as recently happened when Kanye West sampled Omega’s hit Pearls In Her Hair on his track New Slaves.2 Such instances show, as Regev claims, that pop-rock is an interconnected entity and, as argued elsewhere, music is always in the process of relocation and translation (Mazierska 2015). It is also worth mentioning that socialism, both in its Marxist incarnation and that practised in the Soviet Union, did not reject western culture tout court, trying to build a superior one from scratch, as some authors suggest (Risch 2015: 6–7). Rather socialist culture and art were meant to accommodate and build on progressive elements from all previous styles,\n\n6\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\nbeing a logical culmination of history. As Boris Groys put it, ‘The attitude of the Bolshevik leaders towards the bourgeois heritage and world culture in general can be summarised as follows: take from the heritage that which is “best” and “useful to the proletariat” and use it in the socialist revolution and construction of the new world’ (Groys 1988: 37). For this reason, Marx praised Balzac, and Lenin appreciated Tolstoy. Following this logic, there was nothing inappropriate or dangerous in drawing on western music created either in the past or in contemporary times if this culture could be seen as progressive in the same way as Balzac’s novels. Its bland rejection by some regimes in some periods rather points to a betrayal of socialist ideals by selﬁsh and insecure political leaders who did not dare to open their policies to comparison with other versions of socialism (Yurchak 2006). Even when dealing with seemingly straightforward cases of imitation, for example when an artist from the East covers a song from the repertoire of a western star, employing the paradigm of aesthetic cosmopolitanism and music as always being ‘on the move’, encourages us to consider it in multiple contexts: global, national and regional.3 Contributors to this collection are interested in all these contexts by, for example, examining the international careers of Eastern European stars and the ways they tried to fulﬁl expectations of different types of audiences.\n\nWHOSE MUSIC?: REWORKING IDEOLOGY AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL Together with diverting from the ‘self-colonisation’ paradigm, this book tries to overcome the perception of Eastern European pop-rock as being merely a case of political subversion or collusion with the socialist state, as summarised by Ryback in his catchphrase: ‘Leninism versus Lennonism’ (Ryback 1990: 50). In this sense it follows in the footsteps of the recent collection Youth and Rock in the Soviet Bloc (Risch 2015). Its authors acknowledge that Eastern European pop-rock belongs to the sphere of politics, as does popular music in the West and in the rest of the world, but as John Street aptly observes, musicians under state socialism were not only imprisoned and exiled, but also feted and promoted by the state (Street 2001: 252–53).4 In some countries, most importantly East Germany, they were also involved in producing state policy concerning popular music (Wicke and Shepherd 1993; Robb’s chapter in this collection). On many occasions, it is difﬁcult to say whether a given artist was an anti-communist martyr or a communist collaborator, as is argued in the chapter about\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nCzesław Niemen. Moreover, pop-rock artists sang and played not only to upset or ﬂatter the totalitarian rulers but also to express themselves and transmit universal ideas, as well as to gain popularity and earn their living. This often involved avoiding engagement in grand politics and ideology, instead investing their energies in micro-politics, for example being on good terms with local music journalists and music promoters. To understand the speciﬁcity of popular music in the Eastern bloc, we have to pay at least equal attention to such micro-politics and the economy of popular music, as to the grand narrative of the Cold War, with its heroes and villains. To do so, it is worth employing the Althusserian concept of ideology, which, although elaborated to account for capitalism, suits state socialism well. Following Marx, Althusser contended that the economic base or the infrastructure of the capitalist system determines a two-level superstructure. First, ‘the State is a “machine” of repression, which enables the ruling classes (in the nineteenth century the bourgeois class and the “class” of big landowners) to ensure their domination over the working class. The Repressive State Apparatus (RSA) encompasses the police, courts, prisons, the army, as well as the head of State, the government and the administration’ (Althusser 2006: 92). Second, there are the Ideological State Apparatuses (ISAs): the church, educational system, family, legislation, political system, trade unions, communications (press, radio, television, etc.) and culture (Althusser 2006: 95–6). The ISAs, contrary to the RSA, which is single and operates in the public domain, are multiple and belong to the private domain. Moreover, while the RSA functions predominantly by repression, including physical repression, and only secondarily by ideological means, the ISAs function chieﬂy by ideology, but also secondarily by repression even if ultimately this is a very attenuated and concealed form of repression (Althusser 2006: 97–8). Following Marx’s formula that the ideology of the dominant class is a dominant ideology, Althusser believes that ISAs are ultimately in tune with the RSA. However, many authors after Althusser, even those belonging to the Marxist tradition, disagree. They argue that, while striving to appear uniﬁed, the terrain of ideology is actually scarred by hidden silences, elisions and contradictions (Eagleton 2006; on its application to Eastern Europe, see Näripea 2016). Moreover, ideology does not work simply by imposing on people certain ideas from the top, but also by reworking them at grassroots level. Ideologies and ideologues change (ordinary) people, but also people affect ideologies and not only during revolutions but at other times as well. This point is conveyed by the authors contributing to this collection. They refer to the fact that there was no single policy towards popular\n\n8\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\nmusic in the Eastern bloc. Each country had its own (often unwritten) rules, which changed over the years and even within any given period were open to interpretation by different agents, such as political leaders, local politicians and government clerks, and the state media, including prominent journalists and musicians themselves, who tried to navigate between different expectations, often guessing the best course of action for their careers. One example is jazz, which was considered as the protest music of African Americans as well as ‘bourgeois’ decadent music (Yurchak 2006: 166–67; see also Ventsel and Ignácz’s chapters in this collection). Another example is offered by Ana Hofman in her chapter about the censorship of popular music in Yugoslavia, where she refers to the neo-folk song Jugoslavijo, which was panned by critics as kitsch, offending the taste of the Yugoslav people until it was endorsed by Tito himself as a great patriotic song. Although each country and each period was different, certain commonalities can be found. While the role of RSA was crucial during the Stalinist period, it diminished during the periods of ‘thaw’ when ISAs became more important. At the time, censorship eased and popular music gained more space and autonomy within the ofﬁcial culture. This allowed artists to develop their own idiom of expression, both due to reworking foreign inﬂuences and drawing on a larger palette of available motifs. Moreover, from the perspective of socialist ideologues the enemy was initially not only politically incorrect music, but also music seen as kitsch or inauthentic; what ﬁts Adorno’s description of ‘popular music’ (Adorno 1990) and ‘culture industry’ (Adorno 1991). This is because under state socialism the division between serious and popular music was meant to disappear by bringing serious music to the masses5 and creating popular music of a high standard. As Peter Wicke and John Shepherd argue in relation to East Germany, the laws ‘required that the workers who were expending their energies building socialism should be entertained only by highly qualiﬁed individuals with an appropriate degree from an artistic educational institution’ (Wicke and Shepherd 1993: 26). Workers were meant to ‘beneﬁt from the best kind of entertainment possible, and what was considered best derived from traditional bourgeois notions of art’ (Wicke and Shepherd 1993: 28). One means to achieving this goal was by encouraging popular musicians to gain a university education and attributing different categories or ‘tariffs’ reﬂecting their musical craft to them, as demonstrated by passing certain exams. Such an approach might indirectly have led to developing in Eastern Europe music which drew on high art to a\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nlarger extent than in the West, as exempliﬁed by Czesław Niemen, who in his work drew on Polish romantic poetry, or Karel Gott who sang opera arias. Another aspect of the same approach was the use of folk music, seen as an ‘authentic’ expression of the masses. In this respect (as in many others) music in Eastern Europe was not very different from its western counterpart, where folk versus pop opposition surfaced in the 1960s, in part as a response to Bob Dylan abandoning acoustic guitar in favour of the electric guitar (Buxton 1990: 428). The difference was that the perception of authenticity of folk music lasted much longer in the East, leading to the development there of many types of folk rock, such as ‘shepherd rock’ and ‘ethno-rock’. The advantage of such genres was its attractiveness to foreign audiences, who regarded them as mildly exotic ‘world’ music (Connell and Gibson 2003: 121). Privileging of high(er) art within popular music also led to a situation where some genres of popular music subsidised others. A case in point was the use of revenue from rock concerts in Poland in the 1980s to help sustain the jazz industry (Zieliński 2005: 98-9). After the end of Stalinism not only did it become unlikely for musicians to be sent to prison for singing subversive songs, but the role of (any) ideology in the success of a speciﬁc musician or genre diminished. It was rather the quality of ‘music as music’ which decided the popularity and critical acclaim of a given artist or song. At this time it was also impossible for musicians to ignore the needs of the audience. Only by addressing them could they become popular and achieve a degree of artistic freedom and commercial success. It is true that under state socialism there was no simple correlation between the popularity of a particular performer and his or her ﬁnancial success, largely due to the state monopoly of the record industry, which often reacted with delay to the audience’s needs and did not pay artists royalties in proportion to the sale of their records. Nevertheless, there was a link, as the more copies they sold, the more gigs they could play, which was typically the main source of their income. This also brought the chance to perform on television, which was a source of additional income, or to write music for ﬁlm or theatre. Furthermore, success in the domestic market increased the chance to perform and make records abroad. Many bands from Eastern Europe had to content themselves with playing in small to medium size clubs, where they earned relatively little in comparison to their western counterparts. However, due to the high exchange rate of western currency on the black market, back home their earnings were signiﬁcant and allowed them a standard of living which was much higher than the population average.\n\n10\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\nIn the 1980s in some countries such as Poland and Hungary, a slow neo-liberalisation of the popular music industry can be observed. At this time, creating the culture industry in Adorno’s sense was not only tolerated but encouraged. This was reﬂected in the breaking of the state’s monopoly of the record industry by private companies entering the market and an increase in concert ticket prices. This situation led to a greater differentiation of the economic status between the biggest stars and less popular musicians, and a greater independence of artists from state politics. In Poland in the last years of state socialism, despite the overall economic crisis, one could observe in the popular music business a shift from the economy of shortages to a market economy, where supply exceeds demand. This was reﬂected, for example, by cancelling various rock festivals and other gigs not because of their subversive character, but because there were not enough people willing to buy tickets (Zieliński 2005: 75-6). Moreover, changes in the technology, most importantly the almost universal accessibility of the audio cassette and a well-developed black market selling cassettes of foreign records, led to a situation where in some Eastern European countries the productions of local musicians had to effectively compete with music coming in from the West.\n\nFROM ALBANIA TO ESTONIA, FROM LIGHT MUSIC TO POP-ROCK: MAPPING THE FIELD The main purpose of this collection is to present popular music in Eastern Europe during the state socialist period from perspectives which were previously neglected, and focus on areas which were under-represented. One of them concerns the political conditions of production and consumption of music. The authors consider issues such as the effect of socialist ideology on the state of the music business, paying particular attention to the shifts effected by the changes in the leadership of the communist parties. Another area which is examined is that of the role of censors and music journalists in shaping the discourse on popular music in speciﬁc countries. Music journalism is especially neglected in the existing literature on Eastern European music, in part because focusing on music journalists undermines the Manichean vision of Eastern European pop-rock culture, in which nonconformist rockers fought with the oppressive state, by introducing mediators and translators in this battle. Finally, stars are taken into consideration. This is because when thinking about popular music in any country or region one thinks immediately\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nabout its stars. Examining stars also allows us to see many other aspects of music, such as state politics regarding music, dominant genres, organisation of the music industry, fandom, and international connections between music businesses and scenes. Rock stars are frequently endowed with agency; they are regarded as the ultimate authors of their work, not unlike ﬁlm directors, known as ‘auteurs’. Ray Shuker observes that such an approach to stars started in the late 1960s. John Cawelti claimed that ‘one can see the differences between pop groups which simply perform without creating that personal statement which marks the auteur, and highly creative groups, like the Beatles who make of their performance a complex work of art’ (Cawelti, quoted in Shuker 2013: 60). By the early 1970s, ‘self-consciousness became the measure of a record’s artistic status; frankness, musical wit, the use of irony and paradox were musicians’ artistic insignia—it was such self-commentary that revealed the auteur within the machine. The skilled listener was the one who could recognize the artist despite the commercial trappings’ (Frith, quoted in Shuker 2013: 60). By contrast, pop stars are seen as manufactured; they do what is expected of them rather than following their own ideas (Waksman 2015: 297-316). One can notice a similar rule pertaining to pop-rock in Eastern Europe. The ﬁrst stars seen as auteurs appeared in the late 1960s (Niemen, Omega) and the closer we come to the present day, the more we ﬁnd. As in the West, their status was to do with their perception as ‘auteurs within the machine’, as Colin Frith puts it, able to transcend the limitations of the national culture industry. Their presence in the Eastern bloc challenges the claim that the socialist state apparatus attempted to control all spheres of human life and that culture was created from the top down by means of Party directives. Analysis of speciﬁc cases demonstrates that the production of stars was a complex process, which involved a negotiation not only between a star-to-be and the political authorities but also between the star and his or her wider music habits, which included music journalists and promoters. The state socialist system was in some ways hostile to home-grown stars as demonstrated by, for example, limiting the salaries of stars by introducing a system of tariffs and paying them a standard fee for concerts and records, irrespective of the number of tickets and records sold, as previously mentioned. On the other hand, there were some ways in which it was conducive to their creation and sustainment of their careers. Paradoxically, this had to do with the same factors which thwarted or slowed their careers. The shortage of records for foreign and domestic popular music, unlike in\n\n12\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\nthe West when in any given period there were hundreds of bands competing for available space on the shelves in record shops, rendered the music produced by local stars more popular than they otherwise might have been. Moreover, the inertia in the state music business reﬂected in the slow reaction to changing fashions, and the nepotism dominating many state institutions, led to a situation where those who reached the Pantheon of popular music stayed there for decades. The authors of this collection do not use any ofﬁcial deﬁnition of ‘Eastern Europe’ because such a deﬁnition does not exist, but rather try to account for the way this term is currently employed in academic research (on the discussion on Eastern Europe in relation to cinema, see Mazierska 2010). For this reason, there are no chapters about popular music in Russia and the majority of countries comprising the old Soviet Union, because they are usually treated separately from its satellite countries. Nevertheless, the reader will ﬁnd here a chapter about Estonian music because Estonia, together with other Soviet Baltic republics, functioned as a kind of ‘western enclave’ within the Soviet Union. Moreover, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Estonia positioned itself as a Baltic country, politically and culturally closer to Scandinavia than to the old colonial centre of Moscow. While excluding Russia, this collection tries to account for pop-rock in countries which are neglected in existing studies, namely Albania and Romania, on account of particularly harsh political regimes in these countries. The authors of respective chapters do not deny their harshness, but they acknowledge that pop-rock existed there, and in Romania even ﬂourished, testifying on the one hand to the need of populations of these countries to participate in the ﬂow of global popular music, and on the other hand to the difﬁculty in policing the taste of audiences and, at times, of the state accepting its existence and trying to use it to its advantage. The largest part of the book is devoted to music in the three countries which can be described as mini music empires within the Eastern bloc: Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia. These countries had the most developed popular music business (Kan and Hayes 1994: 41). There, artists enjoyed the greatest artistic freedom, were most exposed to foreign inﬂuences and even managed to gain popularity abroad. Of greater interest is music produced in the later decades of state socialism, namely the 1970s and 1980s, because then one can observe an explosion of rock bands in many state socialist countries. Although inﬂuenced by western music, they managed to produce highly original works by incorporating elements of folk music, drawing on local classical music or poetry,\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nemploying metaphor, and taking issue with ‘socialist living’ with its numerous shortcomings, such as the sense of uniformity. In terms of genre, the emphasis in this collection is on what Motti Regev describes as ‘pop-rock’. As Regev himself admits, the term is problematic on two counts. ‘One is the relationship between “pop” and “rock”, and the other is the place of rock in popular music history.’ The author refers to several distinctions between ‘rock’ and ‘pop’, of which the most widely accepted is that ‘rock’ is a more authentic and artistic sector of popular music, while ‘pop’ is its more commercial, ‘inauthentic’ and watered-down version (Regev 2002: 251; on the division between pop and rock, see also Frith 2001: 94–5; Keightley 2001: 109). However, while not rejecting it altogether, Regev argues that what connects pop and rock is more important than what divides them; hence the use of the meta-category. He deﬁnes ‘pop-rock’ by three characteristics: a typical set of creative practices, a body of canonised albums, and two logics of cultural dynamics, namely commercialism and avant-gardism (Regev 2002: 252-57). The creative processes pertaining to ‘pop-rock’ include ‘extensive use of electric and electronic instruments, sophisticated studio techniques of sound manipulation, and certain techniques of vocal delivery, mostly those signifying immediacy of expression and spontaneity’ (Regev 2002: 253). Although the term ‘pop-rock’ is virtually absent from the discourse on popular music in Eastern Europe, and even the words ‘rock’ and ‘pop’ entered the literature on this music relatively late, being replaced by terms such as ‘beat’ or ‘big-beat’ (due to the initial association of ‘rock’ with western imperialism and decadence), this term was opted for because the discussion on Hungarian, Polish or Yugoslav music revolves around the issues identiﬁed by Regev as central to pop-rock. Hence, the reason why ‘beat’ was seen as different from other forms of music such as jazz, classical music and folk, which were exactly those identiﬁed by Regev. Moreover, in the discourse on pop and rock in the aforementioned countries a drive can be observed towards ‘canonisation of the so-called ‘classic’ AngloAmerican rock albums and authors of the 1960s and 1970s, and their inheritors in later decades’ (Regev 2002: 255). Indeed, the typical opinion of critics discussing pop-rock in a speciﬁc Eastern European country is that it achieved a state of maturity when it created its own canon, consisting of albums seen as inheritors of classical Anglo-American rock albums from the 1960s and 1970s, and had performers seen as authors of their own songs (see, for example, discussion of Polish rock in Kan and Hayes 1994;\n\n14\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\nand Zieliński 2005). This is the main reason why Eastern European rock music of the 1970s and 1980s is valued more highly than that which was produced earlier, and why rock in Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia is seen as being of a higher quality than that in the remaining countries of the Eastern bloc. Similarly, the issue of commercialism and avant-gardism is of great importance to critics discussing Eastern European pop-rock, in relation to which an interesting paradox can be observed. While on the level of generalisation most critics castigate Eastern European pop-rock for rejecting the logic of the market, seeing it as the main reason why it lagged behind the West and especially its Anglo-American centre, when it comes to discussing speciﬁc artists, they condemn those who they see as ‘commercial’ and praise those leaning towards the ‘avant-garde’, although ‘commercialism refers to a cultural logic driven by market interests or organizational isomorphism’ (Regev 2002: 256). The question of how the state socialist economy at large and its application to the popular music industry affected the logics of commercialism and avant-gardism of Eastern European poprock is touched upon in some chapters but deserves a separate study. While the terms ‘pop’ and ‘rock’ refer to the music produced after the Second World War, the ﬁeld encompassed by the term ‘popular music’ is larger as it can also be applied to lighter forms of music identiﬁed in the nineteenth century, as well as to genres and phenomena which are concurrent with pop-rock but different from it, as exempliﬁed by the soundtrack from The Sound of Music (Regev 2002: 252). This type of music is covered in this collection due to a close proximity between popular and other types of music under state socialism, most importantly serious and classical music. This resulted from the fact that serious music under this system was meant to be popular and popular music was meant to be of high quality; hence the drive towards avant-gardism and, at an institutional level, pushing the artists to enhance their qualiﬁcations, as discussed earlier. The second reason is a porous boundary between popular music and pop-rock, especially in countries with a heavier censorship of rock, such as Romania, Albania and some Soviet republics. In these countries, popular music labelled ‘light music’ or ‘estrada music’, occupied a position which in other circumstances would be taken by pop-rock, and revealed some characteristics normally associated with this genre, as demonstrated by Aimar Ventsel in the chapter included in this collection. Similarly, the development of ethno-rock, which is one of the most interesting phenomena originating from Eastern Europe, can be seen as a way to hybridise pop-rock with popular music, or even a way to masquerade rock as popular music.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nCovering as many dimensions of popular music as possible comes at the price of exposing more gaps in research than closing them. Among them is the need to engage in a detailed and comparative study of topics such as music policies and industries in speciﬁc countries, sub-genres of pop-rock (for example, progressive rock, ethno-rock, punk, disco, electronic music), scenes, reception of western music, fandom and the relationship of pop-rock to other media, most importantly ﬁlm and video. Some of this work is already taking place, as demonstrated by the recently published volumes and articles on the relationship between youth and rock culture in the Soviet bloc (Risch 2015), and on pop-rock in speciﬁc Eastern European countries, although usually of the period following the fall of the Berlin Wall (for example, Szemere 2001; Buchanan 2006, Mišina 2013)6, rather than the period of state socialism, as is the case in this collection. The hope is that this collection will be followed by more detailed studies. Only by engaging in such research will it be possible to demonstrate the richness of this music and the usefulness of studying it not only for the sake of offering a fuller picture of the cultural history of Eastern Europe, but also the cosmopolitan character of pop-rock music at large.\n\nCHAPTER OUTLINE The collection consists of three parts. The ﬁrst, entitled ‘Reworking State Policies by Grassroots’, examines how state policies affected the production and consumption of music in several Eastern European countries. The ﬁrst chapter, by Ádám Ignácz, entitled ‘Propagated, Permitted or Prohibited? Popular Music in the First Two Decades of Socialist Hungary’, charts the differences in the attitude to popular music on the part of the Hungarian Communist Party and various state organisations, trying to identify the factors which affected it most signiﬁcantly, such as Hungary’s relation to the Soviet Union and the West. Using extensive archival research, Ignácz argues that after the end of Stalinism in the mid1950s, Hungary adopted a cultural model which permitted (if at times grudgingly) the development of different types of popular music, including West-inﬂuenced rock. This was a result of taking a pragmatic stance, based on the assumption that the tide of popular music cannot be stopped by state documents, and later also a realisation that popular music is a source of signiﬁcant revenue. At the same time, artists learnt how to ‘play the system’, maximising their cultural and real capital, which eventually led\n\n16\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\nto Hungary becoming one of the musical ‘mini-empires’ within the Eastern bloc. Ignácz also draws attention to certain peculiarities of Hungarian policy towards popular music, such as ofﬁcially equating classical with popular music and special treatment afforded to folk music. Such ediﬁcation of folk music will also be mentioned by several other authors in this collection. Doru Pop in ‘Pop-Rock in Romania during the Ceaușescu Regime’ examines the attitude of the Romanian regime to western popular music, and those forms of Romanian popular music and youth culture which drew on western inﬂuences. In common with Ignácz, Pop underscores the fact that the attitudes to pop-rock kept changing, largely reﬂecting the changes in political leadership and relations between Romania and foreign countries. The crucial shift took place during the last years of the regime of the hard-line Stalinist Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej in the ﬁrst half of the 1960s and when he was replaced in 1965 by a more liberal-minded Nicolae Ceaușescu, until the early 1970s when Ceaușescu’s policies changed in order to make Romania self-sufﬁcient and isolated from external inﬂuences. Although Romania of state socialism has a reputation as one of the most autarchic and authoritarian countries in the world, Pop, drawing on his own sociological research, argues that the local population was well informed about western music. Moreover, the local pop-rock bands, not unlike in Hungary, learnt to ‘play the system’, and used the state’s determination to produce a socialist culture to showcase their achievements, as demonstrated by the ‘Cenacle’, a state-sponsored multi-media festival. They also exploited Romanian folklore as part of their musical style, to meet the state’s demand to produce ‘national music’, as well as create an original style. Apart from discussing Romanian pop-rock as a distinct phenomenon, Pop also examines its inﬂuence on other spheres of popular culture, such as cinema. Aimar Ventsel in ‘Estonian Invasion as Western Ersatz-pop’ continues with the topic of the ‘West in the East’, but in a different context: the presence of Estonian light pop music (estrada) in other parts of the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. He argues that within the Soviet sphere Estonian music, represented by artists Jaak Joala, Anne Veski and Gunnar Graps, and bands Apelsin and Fix, played the role of western music. Ventsel discusses the mechanism of their success, arguing that Estonia was the Soviet West and Soviet culture managers in Goskontsert and other state organisations promoted that image in order to create popular concert artists. Estonian singers were encouraged not to sing in Russian, and to\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nappear as if they were western pop stars. At the same time, their work was not a simple imitation of western pop-rock, but a creative reworking and adjustment to the expectations of fans. The success of Estonian artists was a product of the informal music industry in the Soviet Union. Every successful Estonian artist had several informal managers who used their contacts to get maximum airtime in key musical programmes of Soviet central TV channels and as many big concerts as possible. Ultimately, Ventsel argues that in the Soviet Union there existed a buoyant proﬁt-oriented music business that operated within the framework of ofﬁcial cultural institutions, contrary to the ‘cold war paradigm’ which emphasises the supremacy of socialist ideology in deciding what kind of music was created and promoted in this part of the world. Even after the fall of the Iron Curtain, when Russian audiences gained easy access to music from all corners of the world, some Estonian artists maintained their popularity, suggesting that they functioned not only as ersatz of the western product but something original. Bruce Williams in a subsequent chapter, ‘The Eagle Rocks: Isolation and Cosmopolitanism in Albania’s Pop-Rock Scene’, considers pop-rock in Albania, widely regarded as the most isolated of all Eastern European countries. Williams argues that despite its isolation, there was an underground penetration of international pop culture. The familiarity of Albanians with international pop music was due to the makeshift antennas, often constructed of soft drink cans wired to parts from transistor radios, which served as decoders and permitted the clandestine reception of Italian radio and television. Of particular consequence was the popularity of the Italian San Remo festival, which was viewed by large groups of friends in concealed locations. During the 1980s, private groups also met at Tirana’s artiﬁcial lake and performed forbidden western music. These performances by the so-called ‘Lake Bands’ provided an opportunity for Albanians to familiarise themselves with western rock music. Nonetheless, it was not until 1988 that singer/guitarist Aleksander Gjoka staged Albania’s ﬁrst rock concert. What is of particular interest is the manner in which Gjoka avoided ofﬁcial censorship and performed the concert at an ofﬁcial venue inside the Palace of Culture. The concert was instrumental in debunking the notion of condoned aesthetics established during the Hoxha years. Although Williams’ chapter is not overtly concerned with censorship, he points to the fact that even in a country epitomising isolation and lack of respect for human rights, there was room for western music (although, signiﬁcantly, coming not only from the geographical West but also the South), and indigenous pop-rock, particularly near the end of Hoxha’s regime.\n\n18\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\nThe second part of the collection, entitled ‘The Function of Gatekeepers’, looks at the role of people and institutions which mediated between the state, artists and their fans, such as censors, journalists, DJs and managers of music clubs. The ﬁrst, entitled ‘Censorship, Dissent and the Metaphorical Language of GDR Rock’, authored by David Robb, considers this phenomenon in East Germany, a country where popular music and youth culture was treated with the utmost seriousness, as demonstrated by the fact that the music scene was controlled by a network of agencies which were directly linked to the organs of government. Robb charts the shifts in attitude to pop-rock on the part of the political regime from the 1960s to the end of state socialist period. Throughout this period the state limited the freedom of expression of artists, but it never tried to eliminate this type of music. Moreover, the pressure to conform was signiﬁcantly eased after Eric Honecker came to power in the early 1970s until the so-called Wolf Biermann affair of 1976. Robb argues that the continuous struggle between artists and censors led to a speciﬁc style of lyrics of East German rock, marked by the wide use of metaphor, which he demonstrates by a close reading of songs from a repertoire of bands such as Puhdys, Renft and City. He argues that this metaphorical style of writing was on the wane in the ﬁnal years of East Germany. The importance attributed by the political regime to popular music was also reﬂected in its attempts to play a major role in the international arena, as reﬂected by organising the annual Festival of Political Song in East Berlin, which was a showcase for international and local political musical artists, including Bob Dylan. On the whole, Robb argues that East German rock, while having some points of contact with its West German counterpart, cannot be considered to be an imitation as it constitutes an original phenomenon. Ana Hofman in ‘Folk Music as a Folk Enemy: Music Censorship in Socialist Yugoslavia’, takes issue with music censorship in Yugoslavia, a country which attempted, with a signiﬁcant degree of success, to implement a so-called liberal socialism. This resulted, among other things, in complex censorship regimes of popular music that operated in the empty space between ofﬁcial negations and actual enforcements. Overt censorship mainly concerned a handful of issues, such as the national identities of the respective constitutional peoples of Yugoslavia and the representation of the country’s leader Tito. Because of that, Hofman shifts her attention from institutional mechanisms of censorship to personal, unspoken and unwritten norms and practices, in particular, self-censorship and so-called ‘editorial censorship’ concerned with limiting the presence of certain\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\ngenres in the media. She focuses on one such genre: Newly Composed Folk Music (NCFM). This music was the object of prejudice and restrictions due to its perceived low artistic quality and purely commercial character, apparent in the characteristic blends of local music idioms and western production and technology. Recognising its strong market potential, the state tolerated its high sales, but distanced itself from its ‘un-cultural’ and ‘un-educational’ features, restricting its visibility in the media and banning its creators from honouring Tito, the Party or Yugoslavia in their songs. In a wider sense, Hofman sides with those authors who criticise the binary relationship between the ‘censor’ and the ‘censored’ and spotlights the multiplicity of actors involved in the censorial activities, instead of a single institution or authority. By the same token, she criticises the totalitarian reading of Eastern European history and its popular music, in which the evil state fought with the musician-political rebels, suggesting that the dividing lines were drawn elsewhere, most importantly between music regarded as high-class and that regarded as kitsch. Zsóﬁa Réti, in a chapter ‘“The Second Golden Age”: Popular Music Journalism during the Late Socialist Era of Hungary’, drawing on archival research, most importantly Hungarian music and youth magazines from 1975 to 1989, analyses how popular music journalism functioned in the late socialist period of Hungary. She argues that although the state determined some of its aspects, and despite the fact that this type of journalism was missing some of the institutional support that was available for the other branches of journalism, it worked well. Hungarian music and youth magazines presented a wide range of opinions, which reﬂected not so much the Party directives as the views of speciﬁc journalists. Hungarian journalists operated as a close-knit community. Everyone was connected, and the most central nodes of this network, the legendary personalities of popular music journalism, were easily recognised by their intermediary nature. They worked in more than one medium, either in a consecutive or a parallel fashion and exerted considerable inﬂuence on the shaping of music fashions. The relative freedom and ﬂourishing of music journalism reﬂected Kádár’s liberal stance towards culture, according to which what was not openly oppositional was tolerated. Réti also argues that the development of music journalism in Hungary was not linear—while in the 1970s the number of articles about pop-rock steadily grew, in the ﬁrst half of the 1980s it saw a sharp dip. She also draws attention to the fact that there is a poignant disparity between the political position taken\n\n20\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\nby journalists at the time of their activity and that in their memoirs, because after 1989 the majority of cultural workers attempted to present themselves as oppositional ﬁgures. The speciﬁcity of journalism in Eastern Europe is also a topic of the chapter ‘Youth under Construction: The Generational Shifts in Popular Music Journalism in Poland of the 1980s’, written jointly by Klaudia Rachubińska and Xawery Stańczyk. Drawing on the concept of the ﬁeld of power, as elaborated by Pierre Bourdieu, they regard Polish journalists as the agents of ‘mild’ pressure that mediated between the state and the artists. However, what interests Rachubińska and Stańczyk is not what Polish music journalists had in common, but what divided them. They explore the topic by analysing articles published in two leading Polish music magazines of the 1980s: Non Stop and Jazz. Magazyn Muzyczny in the years 1979–84. The 1980s is of speciﬁc interest to them because it was a period when pop-rock ﬂourished in Poland and there was a generational shift in the music establishment. The line dividing journalists working at these magazines did not concern their attitude to the state socialist ideology or the government, but rather their attitude to what was perceived as high and low art within popular music, and their own role as tastemakers. Hence, the older Jazz. Magazyn Muzyczny positioned itself as a defender of the avant-garde and educator of readers who it treated in a patronising way, while Non Stop, a specialist magazine for the entertainment industry, was more open to different musical genres and showed respect to professionalism and to the readers, as proved by publishing their letters. On the whole, Rachubińska and Stańczyk also ‘zoom in’ to discuss the case of some of the most inﬂuential Polish music journalists and the way the Polish press presented two arguably greatest music personalities of the 1980s in Poland, Grzegorz Ciechowski from Republika and Marek Jackowski from Maanam. The ﬁnal chapter in this part, ‘The Birth of Socialist Disc Jockey: Between Music Guru, DIY Ethos and Market Socialism’, written by Marko Zubak and based largely on interviews he conducted with Yugoslav socialist disc-jockeys, examines how this profession developed in close proximity with the birth of its respective local pop-rock music scene and the surrounding youth lifestyles. Zubak looks at the difﬁculties of translating this relatively new pop-cultural profession into a seemingly foreign socialist environment, tracing its complex evolution from its beginning in the mid-1960s to its formal recognition a decade later. He argues that socialist disc-jockeys resembled rock journalists in so far as they\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nacted as pop-cultural gatekeepers who spread the new worldview and shaped the musical tastes of the youth in a more direct manner while manoeuvring them on the dance ﬂoor. In addition, the speciﬁc ideological context forced them to develop a different skill set from that of their western colleagues. Linked by default to their natural habitat, they were often personally involved in the foundation and management of the ﬁrst local discotheques. Faced with a limited supply of pop-cultural commodities, they showed a great inclination for improvisation and acquired records through various semi-legal channels. Lacking the expensive technology needed to perform their job, they built their own sound and light equipment, showing considerable electrical engineering knowledge in the process. Embracing a multitude of such diverse roles, from pop-cultural emissaries to business entrepreneurs, socialist disc-jockeys are emblematic ﬁgures of late socialism at large. They epitomise several of its key features, from ideological and cultural relaxation, greater western inﬂuence and the rise of consumerism, to a steady inﬂux of market trends within the socialist economy, all of which defy dated Cold War schemes of repression and dissent, ofﬁcial cultures and youth subcultures. The third part of this collection is devoted to Eastern European stars. It begins with Petr Bilek presenting the career of Karel Gott (b. 1939). Gott was the greatest star of popular music in Czechoslovakia, as the title of this chapter announces, ‘Karel Gott: The Ultimate Star of Czechoslovak Pop Music’, and possibly in the entire Eastern bloc if the number of records sold is taken into account. Bilek situates Gott in the changing context of Czechoslovak politics and culture. His main argument is that Gott epitomised professionalism and the power of music as music. This gave the impression that regimes came and went, while Gott’s music remained the same; untainted by politics and offering solace to often disgruntled citizens. Indeed, although the Czech artist took some years to polish his style, once it reached maturity it changed little. This was possible thanks to Gott being a popular rather than pop star—he drew more on classical music and jazz than reworking world fashions. Bilek points to the fact that Gott was never a political rebel. On the contrary, in 1977 he played a role model for propaganda attempts to minimise the impact of the Charter 77 dissident movement. However, his stardom did not end with the end of communism. During the Velvet Revolution, he performed the Czech national anthem along with Karel Kryl, symbol of a banned exile singer. Even now, in his advanced age, Gott is a great star. Bilek also devotes part of his essay to Gott’s international career, noting his extensive travels to\n\n22\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\ndifferent corners of the world and the great popularity he enjoyed in the Eastern bloc and German-speaking world. Even people who had different musical tastes had to agree that his performance was always impeccable. He was living proof that Eastern Europe can stand not only for shabbiness but also perfectionism. The next star discussed in the book is Czesław Niemen (1939-2004). He is the protagonist of the chapter entitled ‘Czesław Niemen: Between Enigma and Political Pragmatism’. Like Gott in Czechoslovakia, Niemen in Poland occupied the position of a national superstar. However, in contrast to Gott, who is associated with light music and professionalism, Niemen’s posture was distinctly rock. Throughout his life, he was seen as an autonomous artist who created music of such quality that it moved into the area of high art. He drew on classics of Polish romantic literature, most importantly Cyprian Kamil Norwid, and favoured universal themes and messages, as epitomised by his greatest hit, Strange Is This World, rather than songs having distinctly political content. This allowed a large section of his fans to see him as a nonconformist artist without putting him in conﬂict with the authorities. Niemen also beneﬁtted from the high status of progressive rock in Poland, which lasted longer than it did in Britain, thanks to being the ﬁrst and leading representative of the genre. Niemen’s attempts at gaining international recognition are also discussed, especially in Italy and West Germany, which was, as the case of Gott also demonstrates, the most East-friendly music market in Europe. Structural and personal reasons which prevented him from becoming a global star are pointed out, and ultimately the author argues that Niemen lacked any distinct strategy for conquering foreign markets. It is only natural to follow a discussion of Niemen’s career with that of the Hungarian band Omega, the most internationally successful rock band from Eastern Europe, with over a million records sold outside of their country. The authors of the chapter ‘Omega: Red Star from Hungary’, Bence Csatári and Béla Szilárd Jávorszky, chart Omega’s career against the background of social, economic and political forces pertaining to the Hungarian version of state socialism. Although Csatári and Szilárd Jávorszky do not paint members of Omega as anti-communist rebels and martyrs, contrary to the approach taken by Bilek and the author, they emphasise the factors which had a negative inﬂuence on the band’s domestic and international career, especially the monopolistic and highly bureaucratic character of the institutions affecting the careers of Hungarian musicians. They suggest that if the commercial potential of\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\nOmega had been fully exploited by the Hungarian record industry and agencies who were sending artists abroad at least at one point in their career (when they recorded their hit Pearls in her Hair), the band could have reached worldwide fame. Still, Omega’s career is a genuine Eastern European success story, demonstrating that there is much more to Eastern European popular music than imitation. In common with the authors of two earlier chapters devoted to stars, Csatári and Szilárd Jávorszky point to the longevity of Eastern European stardom, with Omega being active for over 50 years, as well as the importance of the German market for musicians from Eastern Europe. The ﬁnal chapter, authored by Piotr Fortuna, ‘Perverse Imperialism: Republika’s Phenomenon in the 1980s’, examines Republika, which together with Maanam was one of the most popular Polish rock bands in the 1980s. Its charismatic leader, Grzegorz Ciechowski became one of the greatest Polish rock stars of all time, despite his perceived arrogance and allegedly embracing the totalitarian character of a socialist state, or at least rendering it sexy rather than ﬁghting it head on, as was allegedly the case with the rockers in Eastern Europe, according to Ryback and Ramet. Fortuna focuses on the years 1981–1986, from the foundation of Republika (previously Res Publica) until their ﬁrst disbanding, when the band achieved its greatest successes. His chapter consists of two parts. In the ﬁrst Fortuna discusses Republika’s lyrics authored by Ciechowski, arguing that its author uses the totalitarian imagery to depict erotic relations between the protagonists of his songs. In the second part, he takes a closer look at the radio mockumentary The Trip, in order to present the position of Republika in Polish rock culture of the 1980s and tease out the role of a rock star in Poland of state socialism. The majority of chapters are written by authors who are based in the countries whose music they present. This allows them to draw on their intimate knowledge of the phenomena at hand. However, others are ‘outsiders’ based in Anglo-Saxon academia or, like myself, are natives living abroad. Not nationality, but knowledge was the main criterion for choosing the authors for this collection. Equally, some authors remember the music they describe from their own experience; others were born too late to attend the concerts of their favourite stars. Such a mixture allows for a more nuanced assessment of popular music in state socialist Eastern Europe than if we hear the voice of one generation only. Although the bulk of the authors recognise that popular music produced in Eastern Europe was inﬂuenced by that produced in the West, especially in\n\n24\n\nE. MAZIERSKA\n\nthe UK and the USA, they refuse to treat this music as a simple imitation or its poor relative. Equally, they point to not only negative but also the positive inﬂuence of state socialism on the careers and type of music produced in the Eastern bloc. Although often seen in their own countries as amateurish and backward (because of suffering from under-development of the recording industry which required musicians to adopt multiple and diverse roles), Eastern European pop-rock can in many ways be seen as foreshadowing the future of popular music globally. In particular, the speciﬁc economic model which dominated in the countries of state socialism, in which the bulk of musicians’ earning came from live performance and subsidiary rights rather than from selling records, today dominates both in the East and the West. It will thus be worth examining in detail for the beneﬁt of current and future generations of musicians. However, to see Eastern European music in this light requires overcoming the (post)colonial and martyro logical mindset, typical not only to researching pop-rock behind the Iron Curtain but also other artefacts coming from this region. It is hoped that the authors of this collection have made the ﬁrst step in this direction.\n\nNOTES 1. I am not the ﬁrst to criticise Ryback and Ramet’s scholarship. For example, Tony Mitchell describes Ramet’s pronouncements as ‘melodramatic’ and reproaches her for caricaturing the political impact of rock music and factual inaccuracies (Mitchell 1996: 95–99; see also Szemere 1995: 273–75). 2. If the ‘imitation’ framework to Kanye West’s case is applied, then one might come to a rather absurd conclusion that sampling Omega the famous American rapper acknowledged the superiority of Hungarian music above its own or perhaps even that of Kadar’s ‘gulash socialism’ over Obama’s version of capitalism. 3. Imitation is also an issue widely discussed in relation to western pop-rock. Simon Frith argues that the attitude to the cover version shifted from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1960s. While in the middle of the 1960s British cover versions of US hits were regarded as necessarily inferior, by the end of the decade it was agreed that a ‘version’ of an old song could be as original as a new song (Frith 2007: 317). From this perspective it will be a fascinating task to examine the way artists from Eastern Europe covered western songs. 4. However, although Risch’s introduction diverts from the simple dichotomies employed by Ryback and Ramet, in some of the chapters they still prevail. For example, Tom Junes’ chapter aptly titled ‘Facing the Music: How the Foundations of Socialism Were Rocked in Poland’\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n25\n\nharks back to the idea promoted by Ramet, that rock destroyed state socialism (Junes 2015). 5. The use of serious music in the education of the masses is excellently portrayed by Dušan Makavejev in his ﬁlm Čovek nije tica (Man Is Not a Bird, 1965), where a symphonic orchestra visits a copper-processing plant in a remote region of Yugoslavia. It is not an accident that such practice was shown in a Yugoslav ﬁlm, because in this country the socialist ideas were taken more seriously than elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where they by this point largely transformed into an empty ritual. 6. In this respect Yugoslavia and post-Yugoslav countries are most thoroughly represented, largely due to the use of popular music in the discourse on nationalism during the Yugoslav wars and their aftermath, proving the point that the special interest in Eastern European popular music concerns its political dimension.\n\nWORKS CITED Adorno, Theodor W.

State Strategies to Control Musical Entertainment in the First Two Decades of Socialist Hungary Ádám Ignácz\n\nWhen examining the history of popular music after the communist seizure of power in Hungary (1948–49), one needs to stay sensitive to the changing nature of the regime’s cultural policy. In the 1960s, western popular music was treated in a substantially different way than in the 1950s. The purpose of this chapter is to challenge a wide-ranging assumption which holds that the communist authorities continuously rejected, if not persecuted, the productions of western popular culture and they only supported the model of socialist realism. It is hypothesised that by the end of the 1960s the regime, while not giving up completely on propagating the ideals of aesthetic education and socialist mass culture,\n\nThis research was supported by the Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Ofﬁce—NKFIH, PD 115373.

The following analysis was primarily based on media coverage, interviews with the most popular musicians of the period1 and archival data of the Institute of Political History (Documents of Hungarian Communist Youth Association), the National Archives of Hungary (Documents of Ministry of [People’s] Education, the Association of Hungarian Musicians, the Hungarian-Soviet Society and the Communist Parties of Hungary) and the Archives for 20th–21st Century Hungarian Music in the Institute of Musicology, Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n\nSTRUCTURAL CHANGES\n\nIN\n\nPOLITICS\n\nAND\n\nIDEOLOGY AFTER 1956\n\nThe Soviet Union and its satellites had already tried to overcome the legacy of the Zhdanovian musical resolutions from 1953.2 However, they insisted on not adopting the ‘bourgeois’ discrimination between serious music and light music as they were committed to the demarcation between politically ‘useful’ and ‘useless’ (or hostile) arts and not one between the ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ spheres of art (Groys 1997: 28–31). Although musical experts had to handle the questions of the two musical spheres simultaneously, in practice the spheres were not treated on equal terms. Popular music was usually judged by the criteria of (socialist) high culture. By the late 1960s, the cultural leadership tried to establish a socialist mass culture, and at the same time acknowledged the right of the socialist man to entertainment, thus legitimising the existence of popular music in socialist culture. There was also a further demarcation within the different genres of popular music. Depending on whether they were described as useful or hostile to socialism, a few musical segments of popular culture (even that of western origin) were adopted and used by the Party (e.g. operetta in the 1950s and later on, jazz), and comrades occasionally attempted to create ideologically valuable new popular genres themselves. Moreover, Hungarian cultural policy, including the treatment of aesthetic and musical questions reﬂected the events of the Cold War. In particular, the assessment of popular music was inﬂuenced by Hungary’s peculiar relation to the Soviet Union and the West (György 2014: 67). The mechanical imitation of the Soviet models and isolation from western countries came to an end after the suppressed revolution in 1956. The revolution resulted in the adoption of a new political leadership which was, however, also unable to break ties with the Soviet Union, as evidenced by\n\n2\n\nPROPAGATED, PERMITTED OR PROHIBITED? STATE STRATEGIES TO . . .\n\n33\n\na number of documents from 1957 onwards (Vass and Ságvári 1964: 504–513). Nevertheless, in the 1960s, Soviet policy opened towards the West and advocated a ‘peaceful coexistence’ of the two camps. The favourable political atmosphere triggered economic and cultural reforms and a reconsidered foreign policy in Hungary which aimed at improving the western bloc’s opinion about the Hungarian socialist regime in the aftermath of 1956 (Rainer 2004: 20). As a consequence of the gradual ‘Thaw’ in the 1960s, the Iron Curtain turned out to be not so impenetrable anymore, as was ostentatiously announced in György Péteri’s famous pun, the ‘nylon curtain’ (Péteri 2004). Still, free communication between the East and West was not allowed, but by absorbing more news from the other side of the Wall, citizens of the Soviet Bloc were nevertheless capable of forming a more realistic picture of the West. In their everyday life, they were irresistibly drawn to the presumed prosperity, cultural effervescence and freedom of the West, and thus, to the new western forms of leisure and entertainment (K. Horváth 2015). Despite being physically isolated from the consumer goods and intellectual products of the West, Eastern Europeans became gradually more informed about western popular culture from the 1960s onwards. As a result, they also liberated their imagination and created cultural artefacts which could be consumed as substitutes for the western ones and later on, they established a new culture of their own which operated as the alternative or counter variant of the ofﬁcial, mainstream culture. This meant a new challenge for the government which had to ﬁnd new solutions to handle their citizens’ modiﬁed perception of reality. The Party’s aesthetic and political evaluation of western popular music underwent a spectacular change from the end of the 1950s onwards. After 1949, in terms of ‘cultural revolution’, the Stalinist cultural policy still aimed at developing an ‘aesthetic totalitarianism’ in popular culture. Besides its administrative measures against jazz and western dance music, it tried to deﬁne all of those compositional and stylistic elements which made the transformation of popular music possible according to the Zhdanov principles (Groys 1992). The Party’s major ideologist and Minister of People’s Education, József Révai (1898–1959) advocated this transformation himself since he believed that arts and literature should be the most important media of communist ideology, and they should all serve daily political purposes. Radical changes were inaugurated in the popular musical scene from 1949/1950 onwards. The newly established musical institutions set up\n\n34\n\nÁ. IGNÁCZ\n\nworking groups, while the Ministry of People’s Education announced a call for Hungarian composers to write popular songs of the new kind following the general aesthetic ideal of ‘national in form, socialist in content’. At the same time, the Popular Music Department of the Association of Hungarian Musicians and its joint committees put serious effort into deﬁning this new quality in popular music. The work in the committees often started with ﬁnding and naming the enemy. The aim was, on the one hand, to purge the musical repertoire of any song that may contain elements of western dance music, and on the other hand, to eliminate unwanted components from the music composed under the aegis of the Party and the Association of Hungarian Musicians. It was not only orchestration that could exude the inﬂuence of Americanism or imperialist jazz (such as the use of a saxophone, a brass section, a clarinet or pistons), but also the frequent use of certain types of chords (such as non-chords or eleventh chords), and techniques of melody-making (chromatic turns) rhythms that can be turned into swing, the more informal types of performance dotted with syncopations, or the atmosphere of a song itself. The second phase of the work concentrated on designing a new, ‘Hungarian’ (nationalistic) style of dance music. The most appropriate way seemed to be the modernisation and recycling of village folk music or folkish urban music which could be brought into harmony with the features of dance music. Composers and performers were encouraged to study the very features of folk songs and discover a particular Hungarian style of performance.3 (Ignácz 2016). A well-known example of that period is the dance-song Szállj, te madár (Fly, you bird 1952) composed by István Pethő, which was modelled on the nineteenth-century Hungarian operatic-style, showcased by the operas Bánk Bán and Hunyadi László of Ferenc Erkel. This programme survived Stalin’s death (1953), as well as the dramatic changes in Hungarian domestic policy in June 1953, which forced József Révai to resign. However, the newly announced government programme which aimed to overcome Révai’s dogmatic approach was not completely effective. Songs produced under the supervision of the so-called Opinion Committee, the state founded dance music composing schools or the Consultation Groups (which fully controlled composing up to the tiny details) were treated in the same manner as before. The regime had not with standing to acknowledge that creativity should not have been oppressed in the name of popularity and clarity.\n\n2\n\nPROPAGATED, PERMITTED OR PROHIBITED? STATE STRATEGIES TO . . .\n\n35\n\nCultural leaders of the post-1956 era emphasised high standards of (musical) education and taste. The Party drew up only the general ideological framework, and it was the artists’ and theoreticians’ personal responsibility to comply with the guidelines of socialist realism in their own individual ways. What is more, theoretical debates over the shaping of the ofﬁcial line were encouraged to involve the non-Party-member Marxist intellectuals. The Party refrained from interfering with the working methods of those authors ‘who [were] ready to serve the people’. However, the regime condemned those persons ‘who [were] working against the collective interest’ of society, and withdrew its support of artworks which were ‘indifferent to the common concerns of society’ in the continued struggled against the spreading of individualism and egoism. The Leninist principle of ‘partiinost’ (partisanship or party-mindedness) prevailed. Nevertheless, the well-known slogan of the Party leader János Kádár ‘anyone who is not against us is with us’, was extended to cultural policy. Politically neutral artists or consumers were no longer persecuted. A new three-grade system of cultural support was introduced by the new head of cultural policy György Aczél (1917–1991) in 1958, the so-called 3 T’s, after the Hungarian words ‘támogatott, tűrt, tiltott’. In this system not only propagated/supported (támogatott) and prohibited (tiltott) works of art appeared but, as a new category, tolerated/ permitted (tűrt) works. Contrary to its predecessor, the post-1956 regime was no longer under the illusion that providing ideologically correct works (e.g. the socialist realist music) would be automatically converted to correct popular belief system. The comprehensive control of popular musical life stayed in place, but the emphasis shifted from aesthetic and compositional questions to those of institutional positions and the circumstances of production and distribution. Melinda Kalmár argues that in the post-1956 period, the arts played a less important role in the transmission of ideology than previously. Science was designated to assume that responsibility. Leaders of cultural policy assigned a more important role to philosophy (aesthetics) and the humanities in general (e.g. sociology) than to art in spreading the ideal of socialist realism. From then on, scientiﬁc results were used in all domains of the construction of a socialist and eventually communist society (Kalmár 1998, 2004). This new turn was palpable in the ﬁeld of popular music too. The former approach of aesthetic totalitarianism was replaced by a sociological one, which was based on large-scale public opinion polls\n\n36\n\nÁ. IGNÁCZ\n\nfocusing on the musical taste and leisure time activities of the masses (e.g. Losonczi 1963). On an institutional level, this meant that the control exercised by the above-mentioned Association of Hungarian Musicians and its departments was handed over to the newly established National Organising Ofﬁce, which became responsible for issuing musical performance licences and organising all concerts in Hungary. To reinforce the control, more power was delegated to the Communist Youth Association (CYA), which translated a former pure musical (or ideological) matter into social and youth policy. An effective youth policy was among the main goals of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party (HSWP) that concentrated its entire policy on the young generation to counteract the fact that students played a crucial role in the short democratic turn in the autumn of 1956. The efforts of János Kádár and his faithful supporters gave the unwanted impression that without convincing the youth the future of communism was endangered. One cannot compare the popular musical scene of the 1950s with that of the 1960s without mentioning the changes in the structure of the public sphere. With the acceleration of Sovietisation of the country (from 1949), a system of political vassalage and representative public sphere 4 (Behrends 2005 and Lázár 1988) emerged in both domestic and foreign policy. The arrangement of the reconsidered Hungarian-Soviet interstate relationship served as a model for the operation of the Hungarian Working People’s Party ([HWPP], the predecessor of HSWP). The leadership of HWPP became subordinated to the Kremlin and, being eager to win the favour of Stalin, tried permanently to outperform Soviet expectations. The same applies to the relations between the inner and outer circle of the Hungarian Party and their ministries: no one was allowed to contradict the decisions of the most powerful leaders. Regarding cultural life, this granted absolute authority to József Révai, especially after 1951. His expectations were accepted, supported and put into practice by his dependents. It seemed as if Révai and the Ministry of People’s Education were behind all cultural (and therefore musical) decisions or administrative measures. Although heads of the cultural policy, similar to other Party leaders, behaved as delegates of the working class and even the oppressed classes, they were not interested in the opinion of the lower ranks of society, but looked down upon the masses and wanted to establish contact only with the intellectual elite. The regime expected the upper classes to be the very medium of the new political and aesthetic ideals who would stake out the course for average individuals.\n\n2\n\nPROPAGATED, PERMITTED OR PROHIBITED? STATE STRATEGIES TO . . .\n\n37\n\nThe Kádárian regime regarded cultural work as being the most difﬁcult and time-consuming of all forms of work. It tried to put an end to elitist behaviour as well as reach an agreement with various social groups. There were a few precedents for asking the people, and submitting (mostly insigniﬁcant) questions to vote. The effect of this seemingly democratic turn was making itself felt in a number of Party resolutions and declarations as well. It is no accident that in scholarly discourse, this gave rise to introducing the terms of simulated or quasi-open publicity. In communicating their political decisions, comrades always pretended to have regard for opinions of the masses. The media, which also became instrumental in the transmission of ideology, were required to exercise the same care. The Party recognised the opportunity of a rapidly growing news consumption and created new strategies for reforming the (printed) media market (Kalmár 1998 and Takács 2012). Youth magazines showing signs of the new approach started to be published as early as 1957. Entitled ‘Hungarian Youth’ [Magyar Ifjúság] and ‘Youth Magazine’ [Ifjúsági Magazin; from 1965], they communicated current political issues and at the same time served as substitutes for western pop magazines, so that they could meet the growing interest of the young generation in western fashion and music. By involving teenagers in the editorial process, these magazines hoped to exercise political inﬂuence and control over them. Well-known examples of expressions of opinions were the ﬁrst Hungarian pop charts that, contrary to western practice, were compiled according to readers’ polls, and votes cast for contestants in Hungarian Dance-Song Festivals. The contemporaries attributed great importance to the polls and votes since these occasions gave people the impression that they had their freedom back, at least in their musical taste (Breuer 1967: 83). It is worth considering here the relationship between nationalism and communism in socialist Hungary. Starting from the Zhdanovian admonitions that ‘internationalism is being born where nationalistic art is thriving’ and ‘only those nations who have their own, sophisticated musical culture can appreciate the wealth of the music of other peoples’ (Zhdanov 1949: 69–70), the Stalinist heads of cultural policy made their stand, to the effect that the total negation of foreign tendencies in music was inevitable and the support of (national) folk music or ‘progressive traditions’ of classical music (e.g. 19th century national opera) was an absolute imperative. A new statefunded popular genre came into being which combined anti-western sentiments with socialist realism and national pride: the so-called ‘national dance music’ (Ignácz 2016).\n\n38\n\nÁ. IGNÁCZ\n\nAfter the suppressed revolution of 1956, the new Party leader János Kádár made it clear that he no longer shared the views of the former regime on nationalist questions. The ﬁrst resolutions of the Party in 1957 already used the term ‘socialist patriotism’ and displayed how the emphasis in the political rhetoric shifted from the national aspect of socialism to an international one. The new doctrine reversed the relation: one cannot be a nationalist without appreciating the Eastern Bloc. The good patriot of the socialist motherland was expected to recognise the ‘congenial interests’ of Hungary and other countries of the Warsaw Pact. The good patriot was expected not to put up a ﬁght against an external enemy but rather against an internal one, for example, against the ‘reactionary ruling classes’ who had popularised ‘pseudo-nationalism’ during the ‘counter-revolutionary’ events in 1956. In a peculiar way, the shift of focus from the external to the internal enemy reinforced the growing tolerance towards western products. The regime, nevertheless, did not dismiss the idea of establishing a pure Hungarian popular culture which would be capable of putting an end to the inﬂow of western music and consumer goods. It is no accident that amateur bands ready to ‘play the game’ of the Party were the ones winning the ‘tolerated’ label. These ‘beat’ groups (i.e. bands that tried to create their own musical manner adopting the style of the early Beatles and Rolling Stones5), predominantly placed in the capital Budapest, the members of which were descended mostly from upperclass families with good political connections, were allowed to perform covers of western hits along with their own new-style songs, if they avoided emulating their western idols in behaviour and physical appearance, and if they concentrated most of their efforts on composing original songs with Hungarian lyrics. The communist leadership (especially through the agency of the CYA) facilitated the evolution of Hungarian beat music with administrative measures. For example, at state-organised amateur pop music competitions, the participants were required to compile the"
