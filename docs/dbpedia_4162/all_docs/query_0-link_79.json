M. Cioran. Ilinca’s goal was to write a biography of Cioran’s Romanian life, from his birth in 1911 until he left Romania for France in 1937—a departure which became permanent after 1941. She had completed more than two-thirds of this project, which constitutes part 1 of the present volume, The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran: chapters 1–3 and 5–7 as printed here, plus her introduction, “Cioran’s Revenge.” I have constructed chapters 4 and 8 (Berlin and Paris) from her drafts, reading notes, computer files, and marginal commentaries in her copies of Cioran’s works. Chapter 9, “The Lyrical Virtues of Totalitarianism,” was one of several analytical studies of Cioran that Ilinca was conducting alongside her biographical work; I have attached it here to provide a kind of conclusion to what must necessarily remain an incomplete whole. During the course of this project, Ilinca became engrossed in another one, an autobiographical account of her experiences in writing Cioran’s biography. This she completed shortly before her death, as Searching for Cioran, Myself: Memoirs of a Publishing Scoundrel, printed herein as part 2: Memoirs of a Publishing Scoundrel. As the first part of her original title suggests, she discovered things about her own past in the process of discovering Cioran’s Romanian past. (She also started an autobiography of her own, called The Escape Artist.) Cioran is no easy biographical subject, for not only were there things about his past he was extremely reticent about, especially his fascistic writings, but he also was a non-person, and persona non grata, in communist Romania, as a “decadent” Western writer. Ilinca never saw or read anything by or about him during her own lifetime in Romania (1952–77). His past seemed to have disappeared twice for her, once into France, and then into oblivion. But after he died in 1995, another drama began, in which Ilinca was caught up, willy-nilly, the essence of which is conveyed by her memoir’s subtitle. Simone Boué,\n\nx Editor’s Preface\n\nCioran’s companion from the early 1940s, was the de facto literary executor of his estate and after his death had to deal not only with publishing responsibilities but also with a huge range of publishing “opportunities” proposed by writers of all stripes who saw a subject of great interest, and profit, in his life and works after his death. Ilinca was ensnared in this drama, as she recounts. Ilinca explains in her introduction how she came to be involved with Cioran personally, and not only as his biographer. Briefly: from a chance suggestion by a friend and colleague, Matei Calinescu, Ilinca had agreed to translate some of Cioran’s five Romanian books, virtually unknown in the West. Two of these appeared, published by the University of Chicago Press: On the Heights of Despair (1933; 1992) and Tears and Saints (1936; 1995). Soon after she started working on these translations, Ilinca met Cioran in Paris and became friends with him and Simone Boué. I and our son Teddy also met them frequently at their apartment on the rue de l’Odéon near the Luxembourg Gardens, where our acquaintance grew into friendship, almost like three generations of a family. As Ilinca walked and talked with Cioran (she was one of the few persons he deigned to address in Romanian, a language he had foresworn in the radical act of transforming himself into a French writer, though they spoke mostly in French), she began to see in his willed self-exile from Romania (ca. 1940) a reflection and anticipation of her own. She decided she had to become his biographer, for no true biography of him exists— still—and all approaches to his life—or lives, the Romanian or the French—are heavily skewed and pre-determined by the writer’s view, pro or con, of Cioran’s temporary allegiance in the mid-1930s to Romania’s home-grown fascist movement, the Legion of St. Michael (the Legionnaires) and its political party, the Iron Guard. I have edited Ilinca’s manuscripts to produce the most complete, coherent, and continuous narrative I can, well aware that her final version—had she lived to produce it—would have benefited from her revisions and corrections, not only in matters of style and conception but also in more mundane matters of references and sources, which I have been able to trace only so far. Her memoir (Scoundrel) is complete as is, though I have removed parts that substantially repeat sections of her biography of Cioran. All Romanian and French texts have been translated into English by her, unless otherwise indicated, although I think she frequently relied on Richard Howard’s superb translations of Cioran’s French books. Similarly, the “I” in both parts of the book refers to her; if there seems any possibility for confusion, I have distinguished her persona from my own by using our initials, IZJ or KRJ. Ilinca wanted to write a biography for general readers, not just for academic or philosophical specialists. But she also wanted to be scrupulously fair and honest,\n\nEditor’s Preface xi\n\nfollowing the best academic standards. These two somewhat different motivations are reflected not only in the two parts of the book but also within each part: part 1 is not completely “objective,” and though part 2 is “subjective,” it contains many details and facts that reflect back onto part 1 as a kind of retrospective commentary. Furthermore, her method is a combination of scholarship and reportage. She knew “the literature” on Cioran, but she also knew Cioran and Simone very well personally, albeit at the end of their lives. So her approach is a combination of scholarship and personal essay. At one point, I thought of sub-titling the book, “A Personal History,” but I decided that might sound like it was Cioran’s own view of his history—and, as Ilinca makes abundantly clear, managing and massaging his personal history constitutes a large part of Cioran’s authorial presence. Editing Ilinca’s Cioran manuscripts has necessarily been a lonely work, but I have been accompanied and helped along the way by some good friends and colleagues. I am especially grateful to Janet Rabinowitch, director of Indiana University Press, for taking a chance on an incomplete project. I am indebted to the Press’s anonymous reviewers, not only for their approval but also for their detailed comments, criticisms and suggestions. Matei Calinescu did much more than write the foreword to the book. Friend and colleague, he is an acclaimed poet and critic both in his native Romania and in his adopted country, author of Five Faces of Modernity and Rereading (among other works), and Professor of Comparative Literature Emeritus at Indiana University. He answered countless queries of mine about everything from Romanian spelling and pronunciation to recondite details about Romania’s complicated interwar cultural history. I also thank Breon Mitchell, director of the Lilly Library (Rare Books and Manuscripts) at Indiana University. Ilinca’s mother, Maria Economu, and her sister, Christina Zarifopol-Illias, provided sympathetic information whenever asked. Finally, I thank Nick Bashall of London for departing from his usual practice of portraiture and agreeing to make from a photograph the charcoal sketch that appears on the book’s jacket. Only one last editorial note: I am not a specialist in Cioran, existentialism, or inter-war European politics. I read and speak Romanian with difficulty (I lived there in 1974–75, when I met Ilinca), and my French is not much better. I am an academic specialist in English Romantic literature, especially Wordsworth. There are references to English Romanticism occasionally in this book, which some readers might think come from my editorial hand. One or two do, but most of them come from Ilinca— and from Cioran. Cioran was an amazingly erudite man, read English easily—and sometimes wished he had “exiled” himself to London instead of Paris. He had a particular fondness for, and insight into, the poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Emily Dickinson. As to Ilinca’s references to Wordsworth and English Romanticism: I was\n\nxii Editor’s Preface\n\nsurprised to see them when I began editing her manuscripts, but I was touched by these hidden textual evidences of the way in which my work had touched hers—as now hers touches mine.\n\nKenneth R. Johnston Bloomington, Indiana December 2007\n\nNote on Romanian Spelling and Pronunciation\n\nThe Romanian language, like the country itself, is often referred to as “a Latin island in a Slavic sea,” because Romanian is a Latin-based Romance language, like Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Most Anglo-American readers will be able to recognize and sound out most of the Romanian words that occur herein (all are translated, of course). However, about 25 percent of the Romanian vocabulary derives from its surrounding Slavic neighbors (including Old Church Slavonic), as well as from its non-Slavic ones, Turkey, Greece, and Hungary. Turkish suzerainty, as the Ottoman Empire, controlled the Romanian territory for centuries—ultimately producing the most famous Romanian of all, in the Western popular imagination, Dracula, or son of the devil, as the nationalist freedom fighter, Vlad Ţepeş, was commonly known. One result of these linguistic and national mixtures is that Romanian has more diacritical marks than most Romance languages. Although they are reproduced herein for accuracy, they need not detain most readers, especially the circumflexes, breves, and other marks over vowels—which are, in my long but still limited experience, very hard for Westerners to hear, let alone reproduce. But the cedilla under ş and ţ are easier, the former sounding as “sh” and the latter as “tz.” So Dracula’s family name would be pronounced “Tzep-esh.” Finally, c before i or e is sounded as “ch,” as in Italian. Hence the family name of the subject of this book, E. M. Cioran, is correctly pronounced “Chore-on” in Romanian, but acceptably as “See-or-an” in French and most other Western languages.\n\nForeword\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, during my visits from the United States to Paris, I always made a point to call Cioran and offer to accompany him on one of his long daily walks, usually solitary, through the streets of his beloved Latin Quarter and the Luxembourg gardens. We would meet in front of the old building at 21, rue de l’Odéon, where he lived in a tiny garret on the sixth floor. In the late 1980s, when he first invited me to have dinner at his place, which he shared with his life-long companion, Simone Boué, he was ambivalent about the recent installation of an elevator. It was an amenity for his rare guests, he admitted, but a temptation—hard to resist—for himself, who had for years taken advantage of climbing the stairs several times a day as healthy exercise, good for blood circulation and the heart. And indeed it wasn’t an ailing heart or other physical impairment that would cause his death (on June 20, 1995, at age eighty-four), but a long battle with an illness, Alzheimer’s, that shattered his extraordinary mind and made him spend the last two years of his life in the geriatric pavilion of a Parisian hospital. By then, Cioran had become a famous figure on the stage of French intellectual life, the admired author of several books of iconoclastic aphorisms, bitter and supremely elegant, apocalyptic and ironic, vertiginously intelligent and memorable. They seemed to represent, in the second half of the twentieth century, an unlikely revival of a great French tradition, that of the moralistes of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: La Rochefoucauld, La Bruyère, Chamfort, Vauvenragues. With the difference that this new La Rochefoucauld had read with particular attention, among many others, the works of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Surprisingly, Cioran wasn’t even French: he came from an obscure corner of Eastern Europe, from a country few people in Paris had heard (or cared) about. And he wasn’t even young, though he burst upon the French intellectual scene in 1949 as a certifiable enfant terrible. He was thirty-eight, and before deciding to write in French, he had published, before the war, several books in his obscure native language.\n\nxvi Foreword\n\nIntriguingly, he showed himself ready to share in his adopted country’s amazement at the very existence of his nation, repeatedly asking himself, “How can one be a Romanian?” Needless to say, this was a recurrent topic in our peripatetic discussions. Much younger than him, I too was nevertheless, as I would put it in jest, an “escapee from the future.” That is, from the Communist regime that had been imposed by the Red Army after World War II not only on our country but on Eastern Europe as a whole, claiming to represent the inevitable future of humanity. Our conversations were exclusively in French—which he spoke flawlessly, rapidly, but with a heavy accent that marked him as a foreigner. In an amiable, friendly way he would correct my mistakes in his adopted language. At the time when I was introduced to him, Cioran enjoyed a solid, if still somewhat “clandestine” (as he liked to joke), reputation. He appeared to relish that imagined “clandestinity,” as well as his being an “exile” in France—a marginal, an apatride or stateless person. Not fortuitously did he write, in the mid-1970s, about Borges, in a wry eulogy later included in Anathemas and Admirations: “The misfortune of being recognized has befallen him. He deserved better.” Did he realize that the same misfortune was in store for himself? On the point of becoming—appallingly, from his own perspective—a cult figure in France toward the end of his life, his buried Romanian pre-war past caught up with him. His foolish admiration for Hitler in 1933–34, the delirious if deeply ambivalent nationalism expressed in his Transfiguration of Romania (1936), his allegiance to the fascistic and anti-Semitic Iron Guard of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, which continued to haunt him secretly long after he had renounced his native Romanian and had begun writing (and speaking) exclusively in French, suddenly became public knowledge. And thus, ironically, the obituaries published in the French press at Cioran’s death in 1995 became a replay in miniature of l’affaire Heidegger of the previous decade. Unlike Heidegger’s engagement with the Nazis, however, Cioran’s fleeting intoxication with the mysticalterrorist Iron Guard could be understood as an unfortunate episode in a life sincerely devoted to the task of “thinking against oneself ” (his most characteristic maxim). Perhaps even as a failed attempt of intellectual suicide, clearly a manifestation of selfhatred—of that strange self-hatred that he managed, later on, to distill into his darkly scintillating French aphorisms. At any rate, as Ilinca Zarifopol-Johnston reflects in her diary notes for 1993 (included in the “Memoirs of a Publishing Scoundrel,” the second part of her book), even after more than a half century of living in France, “Cioran’s avoidance of the limelight, his willingness to live in poverty, on the margins, his rejection of prestigious and lucrative prizes is not just a pose, but it isn’t as disinterested as it seems. I think it is related\n\nForeword xvii\n\nto his fear of revelations about his past. He knows that fame and publicity bring about the inevitable search into the past. But in the end he didn’t escape from it.” As has been said, certain pasts refuse to pass. Starting in the 1960s, Cioran’s French books, admired for their stylistic purity and their arresting paradoxes, began to be translated into many languages, including English. His Temptation to Exist, in the fine version of Richard Howard and with an extremely favorable but not uncritical introduction by Susan Sontag, was published in 1968, followed by The Fall into Time (1970), The New Gods (1974), A Short History of Decay (1975), The Trouble with Being Born (1976), and so forth. Sontag’s broad characterization of Cioran’s philosophical position four decades ago has retained its accuracy. “Our response to the collapse of philosophical systems in the nineteenth century was the rise of ideologies—aggressively anti-philosophical systems of thought, taking the form of various ‘positive’ or ‘descriptive’ sciences of man. Compte, Marx, Freud, and the pioneer figures of anthropology, sociology, and linguistics immediately come to mind. Another response to the debacle was a new kind of philosophizing: personal (even autobiographical), aphoristic, lyrical, anti-systematic. Its foremost examples: Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein. Cioran is the most distinguished figure in this tradition writing today.” What has become clearer in the meantime is the specific biographical-historical drama that underlies Cioran’s work. Ilinca Zarifopol-Johnston’s new book goes a long way in illuminating its contradictory elements and in explaining its continuing interest. Cioran was particularly pleased with Howard’s English versions: a few widely scattered inaccuracies didn’t bother him, as long as the “tone” was right. In the late 1980s, when I learned that he had authorized the translation into French of some of his early Romanian books, I discussed with him the possibility of publishing these books in English as well, in the series of “Romanian Thought and Literature in Translation” I was then directing at the Ohio State University Press. Cioran was at first reluctant. He didn’t trust the abilities of a prospective English translator from the Romanian. What’s more, he had a certain control over the French versions and was able to demand cuts and changes (he was critical of his youthful Romanian style: too “lyrical,” too “loose,” too imprecise), but he was not sure that he could do the same in regard to the English versions. At one point he suggested that the English translations I was urging him to permit be done from the French, but I managed to persuade him that this would not do. I spoke to him highly of my colleague and friend, Ilinca Zarifopol-Johnston, an “escapee from the future” like myself, who was willing to translate his Romanian books, after having read On the Heights of Despair, which fascinated her. Cioran asked for a sample\n\nxviii Foreword\n\nof her work before he made up his mind. Finally, after Simone Boué (a teacher of English at a reputed French lycée in Paris) had read and approved the sample, Cioran agreed and Ilinca translated—euphorically, beautifully—On the Heights of Despair, which was brought out by the University of Chicago Press in 1992 (in the meantime the series at Ohio State University Press had been discontinued). She then also did Tears and Saints (1995) for Chicago and, becoming increasingly fascinated with the thinker’s enigmatic personality, she decided to embark on the ambitious project of an intellectual biography of Cioran. Unfortunately, her research was interrupted by her untimely death; but, fortunately, the manuscript was advanced enough to become, with the editorial help of her husband, Kenneth R. Johnston, the present book. Searching for Cioran is an important and distinctly original contribution to the growing field of Cioran studies. Aside from its subtle analytical edge and the richness of the biographical material concerning Cioran’s youth, it has the advantage, over a book like Cioran l’hérétique by Patrice Bollon (1997), that its author is thoroughly familiar with the thinker’s Romanian background, with what one might call “Cioran’s hidden face,” including the self-inflicted wounds left on it by his wrong-headed youthful commitments. The latter form the subject of a remarkable study by Marta Petreu, recently translated into English as An Infamous Past: E. M. Cioran and the Rise of Fascism in Romania (2005), originally published in Romanian in 1999. (Ilinca had read it in the original and refers to it.) But Petreu’s book is limited to the discussion of a single work by Cioran—The Transfiguration of Romania—and to situating it in the complicated, shifting landscape of the political and cultural life of Romania in the 1930s. What the more comprehensive present study does is to integrate the Transfiguration within the corpus of Cioran’s entire body of Romanian work and to look closely at the ways in which the author tried, in his French writings, to secretly “unwrite” (if one may say so) the earlier books. I should also point out that Searching for Cioran compares favorably with the treatment—which is essentially an indictment—of Cioran in Alexandra LaignelLavastine’s Cioran, Eliade, Ionesco: L’oubli du fascisme (2002). Without glossing over Cioran’s youthful extreme right-wing ideas and rhetoric, Ilinca Zarifopol-Johnston argues convincingly that the mature French Cioran did not simply conceal his past but tried hard to understand it, even though, to himself, it remained incomprehensible, as an act of madness, an act which, even when one is eventually cured, remains essentially incomprehensible. In the chapters devoted to the controversial Transfiguration of Romania, Ilinca demonstrates a psychological acumen and an ability to assess the significance of the tiniest detail in the context of a life-long secret obsession, which are rare among literary commentators.\n\nForeword xix\n\nHer study is complemented by an impressive, lively, and engaging autobiographical attempt to analyze the motives as well as the consequences, intended and unintended, of her “search”—specifically the Search for Cioran—in her own life as an academic researcher, forced by circumstances to become—like the hero of Henry James’s Aspern Papers—a “publishing scoundrel.” Under this allusive and self-deprecating title, we find an unforgettable, poignant portrait of the old Cioran at the Hospital Broca, during the last two years of his life. After a visit to the hospital, Ilinca noted in her diary: “Cioran’s room No. 244, his name on the door. His name also on the books lying on the table in the room. The only books here. He can’t read, but once in a while Simone shows them to him, points to the name and tells him that’s his name, that he wrote those books. He bends his white mane and peers at the name, trying to remember who he is.” His companion, Simone Boué, with whom Ilinca had a complicated relationship, at once rewarding and frustrating, is brought fully to life, as if by a quick, deft, delicate painterly brush. Other fleeting character sketches—of translators of Cioran, researchers, or just admirers visiting him in hospital—are also uncannily vivid. The reading of this whole section of Searching for Cioran is almost hypnotic, revealing in the “scoundrel” a graceful and accomplished prose writer. The search for Cioran, which involved trips to post-Communist Romania (described in the memoir), increasingly becomes for the author a search for herself. At this juncture, she offers the reader an extended and affecting self-portrait against the background of a ruined country, made up of diary entries (encounters, reminiscences, impressions) which uncover the “hidden face” of the scholar. She is a sharp, insightful observer of self and others, courageous and candid, writing in a fresh, quick-silver style totally free of clichés and jargon—in a word, a wonderful memoirist.\n\nMatei Calinescu\n\nChronology: E.

Before World War I, the new country—established between 1861 and 1878 by the union and eventual international recognition of the provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia—was squeezed between the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires like a longstemmed gourd. In the generous post-war settlements, it achieved its largest size, as “Greater Romania,” gaining Bessarabia from Russia and Transylvania from Hungary, as well as other smaller gains in the north and south not shown here, such as Bukovina, the northern extension of Moldavia. After World War II, the country changed shape again, principally by losing Bessarabia back to Russia (since 1917 the U.S.S.R.), and a southeastern triangle (Dobruja) to Bulgaria. These changes did not affect Cioran directly, then living in Paris, but of course he observed and reflected on them, as he did the further change of Bessarabia into the Republic of Moldova after 1989.

(IZJ)\n\nIntroduction: Cioran’s Revenge\n\nIt was cold in Paris in the winter of 1943–44. The war, as it seemed, was going badly for all sides, and shortages were implacable, beyond relief. To keep warm, the Latin Quarter intellectuals flock to the Café de Flore on the Boulevard St. Germain-desPrés, where an impressive stove dominates the main room. Drawn to its generous heat, Jean-Paul Sartre and his group are there every day, arguing for hours around a few marble-topped tables reflected in the Art Deco mirrors on the wall. The Café de Flore is to Sartre’s generation what the Dome and La Coupole were to Hemingway’s. Existentialism, it is commonly said, was born at the Flore. Its birth may have owed as much to the cozy comfort of the steaming stove as to Sartre’s eloquence. Whether “the paths to liberty led through the Flore,” as Sartre claimed, is debatable, but that the path to the Flore led to temporary comfort and refuge for frozen, impecunious students, artists, and writers at the dark end of Europe’s darkest days is without doubt.\n\n4 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran\n\nAt a table next to Sartre, who confidently draws on his pipe, sits a quiet young man, chain-smoking cheap Gauloises. Modestly but correctly dressed with coat and tie, his fedora hat carefully placed on top of a heavy navy overcoat folded next to him on the red velvet bench, there is a vaguely foreign, un-French air about this man, something formal and old-fashioned which strikes an odd note in the bohemian atmosphere of the café. He has a remarkable face: a head of light-colored hair like a lion’s mane, brushed backward, piercing green eyes under a permanently frowning brow and a pinched, willful mouth set in a square jaw which he pushes forward in a moue of great determination. He comes every day, from eight to twelve in the morning, two to eight in the afternoon, and nine to eleven at night. “Like a clerk.”1 He smokes and listens to the heated arguments at the next table. He always sits next to Sartre but never says a word to him. Simone de Beauvoir is also there. Whenever she takes out a cigarette, the young man stands up, bends towards her ceremoniously, and, still silent, lights it for her. She thanks him with a nod of her head; he nods back respectfully and sits down. Every day that winter the silent ceremony is repeated. No one ever asks who the foreign-looking young man is. Every day, he sits without a word next to the “idol” of the French cultural scene. Is he never “tempted” to speak to the idol?2 The young man’s name is Emil Cioran. At the time we see him eavesdropping on Sartre and his group, he is a Romanian doctoral student, in Paris on a renewable fellowship since 1937. But he hasn’t yet written a single line of his thesis. He never will, in fact. He is not really a student; he is a writer. Nor is he as young as he seems: though thirty-three is not old for a doctoral student, some of Cioran’s apparent youth is a feature of his foreignness, which he will cultivate as a permanent aspect of his persona. He is not even a French writer, yet. His equivocal position on the margins of Sartre’s group, gravitating around the axis of French intellectual authority, always silent but always present, sums up this ambitious and divided young man, in quest of a center that will focus his own creative energy. In Romania, he is well known, the published and controversial author of five books and numerous articles. In Paris, in 1943–44, he is nobody, just an exile from Eastern Europe, hoping to make a name for himself in the City of Light. He is finishing a book about Nazi-occupied Paris as symbol of the final decay of Western civilization. But the book, written in Romanian, will remain, forgotten or abandoned, in manuscript form until its publication in 1991. For the young Romanian suddenly decides, the very next summer, to abandon his native language and to write henceforth in French, at last to break into, as it were, the conversations of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Five years later, in the fall of 1949, the French publishing house Gallimard brings out a volume of essays with the curious title Précis de décomposition (A Treatise on Decay). The author is an unknown Romanian, E. M. Cioran, the former Emil Cioran\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nof the Café de Flore. His book causes a sensation in literary circles, and its author is welcomed as the oracle of our disgraced modern times. Maurice Nadeau in Le Combat extols him in rapturous terms as a philosopher for the end of time: he has arrived, he whom we have been waiting for, the prophet of our era of concentration camps and collective suicide, the one whose arrival has been prepared by all the philosophers of the void and of the absurd, harbinger of bad news par excellence. Let us greet him and watch him closely: he will bear witness to our times.3\n\nIn 1950, Cioran’s book is awarded the Rivarol prize for the best manuscript in French by a foreign author. Overnight, Cioran has become a French author, immediately and often compared with Sartre and Camus, if only to be distinguished from them. When he read Nadeau’s article in Le Combat, Cioran was jubilant. “I made it! I won!” he told his companion, Simone Boué. “You must understand how important it is for a Romanian intellectual to be acknowledged and reviewed in France. I made it! I won!”4 To his parents, he wrote in a similarly exuberant vein: “I must confess that the success of the book has surpassed my most optimistic expectations. Not being designed for a wide audience, the book cannot bring me much from a financial point of view. But at least I am no longer a poor unknown stranger, which means a lot in a country where prestige is everything.”5 Cioran had won a wager he made with himself, namely, that he would write and rewrite until he received public recognition in France. Just a few months before the publication of the Précis—which he rewrote four times—Cioran had felt snubbed and humiliated by Albert Camus in the Gallimard offices, when Camus, who had read the manuscript of the Précis, told him he still had to “enter the circulation of great ideas.” Incensed, Cioran had sworn on the spot to “avenge” himself, that is, to write until he would triumph.6 He had embarked on a lonely and painful adventure, but he was never discouraged, not even by Camus’s dismissive comments. Cioran pursued his mission with dogged determination, with a fanatical belief in its importance that was the equivalent of mystical faith. He experienced his revenge as a triumph simultaneously over both French pretentiousness and Romanian provinciality. In retrospect, young Cioran’s silent position next to Sartre at the Flore was not at all accidental. Cioran chose it deliberately. He watched and waited like a spy, quietly measuring his forces against Sartre’s to find out his own worth. “My path was the reverse of Sartre’s,” he said later, even though his essay on Sartre in the Précis, “On an Entrepreneur of Ideas,” shows how much Sartre’s model was on his mind.7 He could speak as well as Sartre, he had read much more, he would write as well as they—Sartre’s circle—were writing. His silence was not shyness or intimidation, but inordinate pride. With his body strategically placed on the margins of fame, Cioran\n\n6 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran\n\nmade a statement. He was nearly inside the magic circle of Sartre and French cultural life, which had enormous prestige in the eyes of European intellectuals, especially marginal Europeans like Romanians. Just outside the circle, or rather on its borderline, the ambitious interloper worked silently and tenaciously in isolation for another five long years—scribbling away like Dostoevsky’s underground man, in the cheapest hotel rooms in the Latin Quarter—to gain the place at the table he had marked out for himself, next to Sartre, publicly recognized in France. But unlike Dostoevsky’s underground man, whose “revenges” were never more than pathetic failures to impress imaginary opponents, Cioran’s “revenge” was a blazing success. Hailed by Nadeau as a “twilight thinker,” by André Maurois as the new “moralist or immoralist,”8 by Claude Mauriac for “masterly language . . . closer to Pascal than Vigny,”9 the Romanian-born Cioran had not merely arrived on the French literary scene; he blazed across it like the meteor, symbol of obscurely powerful poetic genius, in Mallarmé’s poem, “calme bloc ici-bas chu d’un desastre obscur”10 [calm [granite] block fallen down here from some dark disaster]. This is the story my book has to tell: how an unknown young man from the margins of Europe, with a fanatic will to transform himself, achieved fame “in a country where prestige is everything.” This biography covers the crucial first stages of his career, from 1911, the year of his birth, to 1949, the year of his consecration as a French writer, which marks his final break with his Romanian roots.\n\nu After 1949, nearly a dozen more of Cioran’s books—all variations on the same theme, the decadence of the Western liberal world—came out with striking precision at roughly four-year intervals (see Chronology). More prizes followed: the Rivarol, the Saint-Beuve, the Combat, the Nimier. And more praise. In his lifetime, Cioran was acclaimed as “the greatest French writer to honor our language since the death of Paul Valéry” (St. John Perse), “a master of French prose,” and “a modern Socrates” (Marc Fumaroli, professor at the Collège de France), and “the most distinguished figure in the tradition of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Wittgenstein” (Susan Sontag). When he died in Paris in 1995, the event released an avalanche of articles in Le Figaro, Le Monde, Paris Match, Le Nouvel Observateur, and Magazine Littéraire, as well as radio talk-shows and theatre productions reflecting a renewed interest in his life and work.11 More than once, Cioran’s name has been honored with standing ovations in the Assemblée Nationale. In the minutes of the March 17, 1999, session, for example, a member of the Assemblée pays homage to all of the “Francophone Romanians who contributed to the splendor of [our] culture,” and among them to Cioran, “one of the greatest French philosophers of the 20th century.” Cioran has become more conspicuous dead than alive.\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nHowever, though lionized in France and translated into many languages around the world, from Polish to Japanese, Cioran’s name still draws a blank in many circles. He is particularly little known in the Anglo-American world of letters, where, though his work has been translated from French by the distinguished American poet Richard Howard, translator of Proust and Barthes, and praised by Susan Sontag, America’s home-grown “European” intellectual, his writing has not caught on in the way the work of Sartre or Derrida did. Granted, he is a specialized taste, too sharp and bitter for many palates and yet, paradoxically, too lyrical or too “unserious” for others. Yet Cioran is a better, “purer” writer than Sartre or any of the postwar French existentialists. If his stylistic incisiveness has led some critics to put him in the same class with Paul Valéry, an ultimate accolade of linguistic purity, the shocking, bracing verve—and black humor—of his existential despair admits his philosophical prose to the company of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. It’s peculiar to be simultaneously famous and obscure, but it’s a situation that fits Cioran like a glove. If the scene at the Café de Flore tells us anything, it is that Cioran chose for himself a place on the borderline between fame and anonymity, a narrow precipitous place, which he then proceeded to inhabit for the rest of his life. Friend of Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, and Henri Michaux, Cioran was as famous as they, yet he was, as he often put it in interviews, “un ennemi de la gloire.” He insisted that there could not be a greater calamity for a writer than to become somebody—“quelqu’un”—that is, someone important. He vehemently refused to consider himself an established author; he was at the most, he said, “un homme de fragment.”12 Cioran flirted with fame but did not cultivate it. When it came to him, he evaded it: he refused to accept all of the prizes he was awarded with the exception of the first one, Rivarol, which “he found impossible to refuse.”13 He refused to give interviews in France (though he was more accessible to foreign journalists); he made no TV appearances, he had no public political stance. He thus acquired an inverse fame, the reputation of a recluse, who, from his attic in the Latin Quarter, like Bunuel’s Saint Simeon on his column in the desert, regularly launched his books like so many anathemas against our times. If you wanted to put a face to this prophetic voice, he could be easily spotted on his daily rounds in the Luxembourg gardens or in the neighborhood of the cathedral of Saint Sulpice in the Sixth arrondissement. Dressed with the elegance of a British country gentleman in woolen cap, scarf, and coat, but with a most un-British stare in his intense “flashing” eyes and “floating hair,” he cultivated an incongruous look, half-civilized, half-savage. One did not pass this elegant British-looking prophet in the street without asking oneself, “Who is that man?” His aura of mystery and provocation was carefully cultivated.\n\n8 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran\n\nThe same goes for Cioran’s literary reputation. To the question I am so often asked, “Who is E. M. Cioran?” my best short answer is, “a famous marginal.” I haven’t found a better way to describe him. His very name illustrates the Cioranian paradox. It is a hybrid, a partly made-up name. The initials E. M. do not stand for Emil(e) Michel, as the Library of Congress mistakenly lists him, but simply for E. M., as in E. M. Forster. On the eve of his French debut, Cioran made the first two letters of his given name, Emil, into two initials alluding to an English author, who is himself somewhat on the margins of twentieth-century literary fame.14 By thus modifying his given name into a pen name that copied the name of another writer—admittedly not the most famous one, but one who seemed famous to him and with whom he sought to identify— Cioran revealed both his writerly ambitions and his biographical ambiguities. Using the ordinary letters of his own Romanian name, he raised them to the status of famous initials. Thus Cioran, an unknown author, a “barbarian” from the margins of Europe, found the elements for the creation of a new authorial persona. Emil, the Romanian, the Transylvanian, turned himself into the cryptic E. M., and by this act of baptismal abbreviation he reinvented himself as a “civilized” West European author. The name, grafting the old and the new, East and West, the marginal and the famous, is a mirror image of the man’s biography. Cioran has in fact two lives, two identities, two voices: the Romanian Emil Cioran, a “mystical revolutionary,”15 imbued with the ideals of political romanticism, author of five books and numerous articles, and the French E. M. Cioran, referred to simply as “Cioran” in the last stages of his fame, who in 1937 sent himself as exile to Paris, and twelve years later made his spectacular entrance on the French literary scene. In these two lives, he contains within himself much of the history of twentieth-century Europe, uneasily divided between East and West.\n\nu Cioran does not belong to the “once-born,” to use William James’s formulation. He belongs to the “sick souls” or “divided selves,” that is, those who strive for a “second birth” and undergo a “growth-crisis” that will “convert” them to “their habitual center of personal energy.”16 Like Joyce’s Stephen Dedalus in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, young Cioran was engulfed in a cycle of identity crises (existential, religious, political) leading to exile and eventual triumph. Like Stephen, Cioran finds his true artistic self, once his “country has died” for him and he rejects all the embroiling and befuddling “nets” of family, religion, and politics. At the center of his life gapes the wide rift of exile, Cioran’s unique way to self-realization and the driving force of his writing. In a very specific historical, political, and cultural context, Cioran crossed the chasm of exile and found his “habitual center,” reaching what William Carlos Williams calls the creative “self ’s objectives.”\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nCioran’s early life, with its abrupt change of identity, presents a fascinating story of Romantic self-transformation. The European intellectual world knows him as the ironic moralist and elegant stylist, a burnished, fixed image to go with his burnished, flawless style. The world also knows him as the disabused Old Man. Ever since his 1949 literary triumph, Cioran, like Yeats in “Sailing to Byzantium,” adopted the mask of the wise and cynical old man, though he was then only thirty-eight years old. This old man’s voice, which speaks in all of his French writings, creates the false impression that Cioran, even when he alludes to a younger version of himself and refers to unspecified youthful tribulations, has no other history than that of The Recluse of Saint Sulpice. But his images of the recluse, of the “abuser of the universe,” its “universal calumniator,” are carefully constructed versions of himself. Though extraordinary, Cioran’s personal saga is not unique, either in psychological or sociological terms. Psychologically, the stages of Cioran’s evolution follow what Erik Erikson calls “a classical pattern of repudiation and devotion.” First, repudiation of a career as a Romanian intellectual; next, temporary devotion to an extreme ideology, apocalyptic nationalism, that was for him always problematic; then, the sense of a spiritual mission which gradually narrowed its focus from the nation to the self, finally mobilizing the creative capacities of the self into the born-again writer.17 Neither is Cioran’s life very different from the life of other right-wing intellectuals of the inter-war period, from a sociological point of view. It resembles, for example, a pattern which Jerry Muller, in The Other God That Failed, sees as paradigmatic of the life of many German scholars of the period, including perhaps the most famous of them all, Martin Heidegger. Muller’s book, a “representative biography” of the German sociologist Hans Freyer (1887–1969), is especially interested in the “formative contexts, events and patterns of behavior that Hans Freyer shared with other intellectuals,” not merely the particularities of one man’s life. Muller thus identifies three stages in Freyer’s life that are typical rather than particular: 1) “alienation from the liberal welfare state” and “articulate advocacy of an all-encompassing state that would mobilize society and culture for the militant defense of collective particularity”; 2) “ingenuous support for the National Socialist movement in the hope that the movement will provide the vehicle through which the ideal state might be realized”; and 3) disillusionment, disengagement and distancing of oneself in published works from the fascist tenets one previously held.18 Mutatis mutandi, this pattern can be easily traced in Cioran’s life as it moved from early political involvement to detachment and exile, except that for Cioran, the failure of the political dream brought about his literary triumph. To a great extent Cioran’s life pattern reproduces the cycle of political radicalization and subsequent de-radicalization of many twentieth-century intellectuals, a cycle which itself repeats a pattern already established by the European Romantic\n\n10 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran\n\ngenerations after the French Revolution. The cycle begins with intellectuals’ critique of modern society, coupled with utopian, totalitarian solutions. It ends with their revulsion at the excesses of revolution, war, and totalitarianism, and a retreat into the de-politicized realm of art and ideas.19 As an enthusiast of the anti-rationalist philosophies widely popular in Europe during the first decades of the twentieth century, Cioran belonged to the tradition of the intellectual right descended from the Counter-Enlightenment. Its dominant ideology was “radical conservatism,” characterized by strong antipathy toward liberal institutions and capitalist society and appealing for the restoration of civic virtues by radical, revolutionary action.20 This neo-romantic critique of flaccid liberal society looked attractive on paper, but it turned ugly in reality. Hence Cioran, along with other brilliant Romanians of the period, cuts a sorry figure when, from being an “angry young man” in his bookish speculations, he becomes an advocate of the fascistic Iron Guard movement. Surprisingly little biographical work has been done on Cioran. Academic monographs have tended to ignore Cioran’s Romanian life and works and concentrate on the major (French) philosophical themes in his work. More recent works in Romania and the Romanian emigré press discuss Cioran in the context of over-all reevaluations of the intellectual generation of the 1930s. Some are flatly critical of his early right-wing political attachments, while others try to explain them away. In France, where Cioran has been exclusively known as a French writer, the question of his Romanian past has only recently come to the fore. Gabriel Liiceanu’s Itinéraires d’une vie (1995) prefaces an interview with the ailing eighty-three-year-old Cioran with a biographical sketch that briefly outlines Cioran’s Romanian period. Patrice Bollon’s Cioran l’hérétique is a more ambitious project, connecting Cioran’s Romanian work to his French œuvre. But Bollon concentrates exclusively on the anti-semitic aspect of Cioran’s early work, which he considers a “youthful error,” entirely attributable to the political climate and blind prejudices of the time. Thus for Bollon, Cioran’s “second birth” as a French writer was a way of erasing the guilty trace from his past. Submitting himself to the rigor and discipline of the French language, Cioran, according to Bollon, gradually came to his senses, abandoned, regretted, and partially retracted his earlier anti-semitic stance.21 This book is neither a case for Cioran’s prosecution nor an apologia pro vita sua. Our century is dominated by a trial mentality, as Milan Kundera rightly observed, and the temptation to “prosecute” an intellectual and prove that he or she remains a fascist (or a Communist) at heart is an inherent danger for any biography.22 Mine is rather an attempt at understanding or comprehension, in Hannah Arendt’s sense: Comprehension does not mean denying the outrageous, deducing the unprecedented from precedents, or explaining phenomena by such analogies and generalities that the\n\nIntroduction 11 impact of reality and the shock of experience are no longer felt. It means, rather, examining and bearing consciously the burden that events have placed upon us—neither denying their existence nor submitting meekly to their weight as though everything that in fact happened could not have happened otherwise.23\n\nAvoiding both the witch-hunts of political attack and the high-minded celebrations of the “Olympian” Cioran of his later French years, I concentrate instead on Cioran’s important formative years, his youth in a Romanian village in Transylvania, his student years in Bucharest during Romania’s politically troubled inter-war period when, along with Eugène Ionesco and Mircea Eliade, he belonged to Romania’s generation of “angry young men,” and his first years in France, roughly coinciding with the outbreak of the World War II, the occupation of Paris, and the defeat of Nazi Germany, a period which was for Cioran the crucial turning point in his life as a writer. Throughout, I seek to answer the question of how this provincial young man made himself into the ironic moralist and elegant stylist so admired today. But, if Cioran’s life is a paradigm of self-creation, the questions still remain: How well did he succeed? How does he stand out? What makes him Cioran and what explains his triumph? While acknowledging the “formative events” and historical contexts in Cioran’s life, this biography shows another aspect of the process, whereby a young man from a place as marginal to Western culture as Transylvania—a place that many Americans imagine exists only as the home of Dracula—was “radicalized” by intense experiences of spiritual and political awakening during the early years of Romania’s “spiritual revolution.” It shows how he reconstructed himself, by a process far more complex than a simple political retrenchment or self-imposed silence, into a writer, moralist, and essayist, who is now by most accounts one of the greatest stylists in the French language. But there are dangers in contextualizing Cioran too much, reading him exclusively either as a right-wing Romanian or an apolitical Western intellectual. Thus, to read (and explain) him entirely in his Romanian context is not a complete solution. On the contrary, it can be an obstacle because of the danger of “Roumanizing” him, reducing him again to a general rule: how he is like other Romanian intellectuals of his generation. It would also force him back into the narrow confines of a small nation he always wanted to escape. One should read Cioran against the historical background of his early life and times to see also how he stood out and apart from his national context. Milan Kundera’s comment on Leoš Janáček’s cultural fate is relevant for Cioran as well: “If in the case of Broch, of Musil, of Gombrowicz, and in a sense Bartok, delay in recognition is due to historic catastrophes (Nazism, war) . . . , in Janáček’s case it was his small nation that completely took over the role of catastrophes.”24 Being Romanian\n\n12 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran\n\nwas for Cioran a calamity he did everything in his power to transcend, and his struggle to overcome this calamity is faithfully recorded in his books. On the other hand, to compare him with German right-wing intellectuals such as Hans Freyer or Martin Heidegger is also limiting—for in their cases one cannot speak of triumphs. As Muller shows, in the aftermath of the war and through the entire de-nazification period, these intellectuals were barely surviving, only precariously maintaining a livelihood and their professional reputation. It is precisely at this point of crisis, however, that Cioran’s path deviates from the general pattern: where they fall, he rises. Disenchantment with his former politicized self, instead of being debilitating, becomes the motor of Cioran’s literary career in the West. At the distance of more than half a century, we tend to forget how much, in the first two decades after the war, when Cioran was making his reputation in France, the memory of the catastrophe of the war and of totalitarianism(s) dominated the political and cultural life of Western Europe. Cioran’s work must be understood in the pervasive climate of disappointment with political utopias. In his critique of the liberal, decadent West and the totalitarian aberrations it had led to, Cioran capitalized on the experience of the century and voiced the “spirit of the age,” gaining recognition as “prophet” of the era. He snatched his personal victory from the jaws of Europe’s defeat. In this “triumph of failure” lies Cioran’s “revenge,” and the secret of his self-reconstruction. Cioran actually lived the experience of the century first-hand. It was, first and foremost, his own life experience. His existential prose draws upon it. The English Romantic poets, Wordsworth and Byron, wrote and rewrote many poems about the most formative years of their lives: the time of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, a time when it was “bliss to be alive, but to be young was very heaven.”25 During the years of his revolutionary youth—the decade of the 1930s, characterized by the rise of fascism in Western Europe and Stalin’s reign of terror in Russia—Cioran, like Wordsworth and Byron, was deeply political and “subscribed to fanaticism, rage and madness,” with a desperate abandon that was unusually intense and vehement. This was the time of Cioran’s involvement with Romania’s Iron Guard movement. It was then that he wrote his one political tract, Romania’s Transfiguration (1937), a wildly fanciful utopia in which he dreamt of a Romania with “the destiny of France and the population of China”—and which he disbelieved almost as soon as he imagined it. This period full of “juvenile errors,” as Wordsworth called them, became the substance of Cioran’s subsequent writings. As he himself observes, the spirit of the times precipitated young people into politics, exploiting the idealism and fervor natural to youth:\n\nIntroduction 13 He, who between the age of twenty and thirty, has not subscribed to fanaticism, rage and madness is an imbecile. . . . Misfortune is reality for young people. They are the ones who proclaim totalitarian doctrines, and who carry them out, they are the ones who clamor for blood, who revel in noise, screams, barbarity. At the time when I was young, the entire Europe believed in youth, all of Europe pushed the young into politics, urged them to take part in government.26\n\nThe turbulent years were followed by his self-imposed exile to France and adoption of a new persona—ironic, disenchanted, and skeptical—a move again uncannily similar to Wordsworth’s retreat into the English Lake District, though in reverse, since Wordsworth retreated into nature’s bosom, whereas Cioran chose the most sophisticated city in Western Europe. Both writers recreated themselves in exile, Cioran as the last of the French moralistes, Wordsworth as the first great English nature poet. The new self-image these authors presented to the public was in both cases apparently removed from the nightmare of history and politics, but only apparently. It is only at the level of sublimation of the personal that Cioran could appeal to the Western public. No one would have listened in 1949 to the confessions of a marginal, a passport-less alien, a sans papiers. To have remained specific, to have played up his Romanian origins, would really have been the death of him. He would not have become “Cioran” but merely a footnote in history. Thus we need to interpret Cioran’s texts in a closer relation to his life than has yet been done: not as direct reflections of the life but as his own interpretations of it. And this is, in fact, the approach Cioran himself advocates. As he put it in an interview, “all my books are more or less veiled confessions.” In spite of appearances, the aphoristic Cioran is a profoundly autobiographical writer. His works are autobiographical precisely because they don’t seem to be. For, as he put it in De l’incovénient d’être né, “l’unique confession sincère est celle que nous faisons indirectement—en parlant des autres” [the only sincere confession is the one we make indirectly—while speaking of others].27 The sublimated autobiography was for Cioran a means of (re)-imagining himself. One must read his indirect confessions on two registers at once: the autobiographical, personal and the aphoristic, universal. The two levels interact dialogically: the autobiographical detail or fact shapes the general thought while, at the same time, the thought requires the projection of an author’s figure. A passage from La tentation d’exister illustrates Cioran’s manner of indirect confession. Embedded in an attack on biographical writing, we find his definition of life as a wound, of writing as a cure, and of the author as a martyr undergoing meaningless suffering. Simultaneously autobiographical and therapeutic writing both conceals and reveals the writer’s life:\n\n14 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran In the age of biographies, no one covers his wounds without running the risk of having the bandage torn off and the wounds exposed for all to see; and, if they fail to expose them, we go away totally disappointed. And even he who ended on the cross, it is not because he suffered for us that he still matters to us, but because he suffered without end and gave out some cries that were as profound as they were free of charge.28\n\nThe metaphor of the wound of life, dressed in layers of writing, nowhere makes sense so well as in Cioran’s own work. In this respect, Cioran resembles Luther, or rather Kierkegaard’s perception of Luther: a “lifestyle of patienthood as a sense of imposed suffering, of an intense need for cure, and a passion for expressing and describing one’s suffering.”29 By giving outward expression to his tormented inner life, Cioran managed to reduce its intensity and avoid a self-destructive internal combustion, for, as he memorably put it: “un livre est un suicide différé” [a book is a postponed suicide].30 His passion for describing his own suffering is especially evident in his first book, On the Heights of Despair, written because Cioran, at age twenty-one, could find no better way to resist the temptation to commit suicide. It was Cioran’s first successful attempt at a “writing cure.” Though all of Cioran’s works are autobiographies in disguise, his earlier Romanian writings have an almost visceral quality: in them the wound of life is still raw, unhealed, close to the surface. They are intensely lyrical, almost savage in their passionate selfexpression. They have a barbaric quality; they are made of “blood and tears.” In them, Cioran groans and cries out in despair, reveling in descriptions of his inner torments. There is a lot of dramatic posturing in these early books that some readers find off-putting, but they are the signs of a genuine affliction, the difficulty Cioran has in finding a central direction to his life. Since he is not an “imbecile,” he experiences his identity crisis as an illness. He gropes for an identity as for a cure throughout this early Romanian period, and his flights of passion alternate with flights of despair in his books, like red lines on a fever chart. In his early writings, Cioran lets us in on the evolution of an idea, the thinker’s hesitations and tribulations before he reaches his thought. He thus gives the reader the impression that he is witness to a most intimate process, and creates between the reader and himself intellectual tension and excitement. Cioran’s later writings are more intellectual and less obviously autobiographical. In them, any trace of the process of thought elaboration is eliminated, but the bons mots, the aphorisms, the paradoxes, spectacular as they are as linguistic and intellectual tours de force, retain their confessional and intimate, “lived” quality; they are as much cris du cœur as they are philosophical fireworks, or as Cioran himself put it, they remain “tears turned into thoughts.” They are still about the same “juvenile errors,” but Cioran is now a contemplative commentator on his own past. The wound is now\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nhidden from view under writing which has sublimated the martyred author’s ordeal. The bandage—writing—is the wound’s only trace, and the sufferer, now a master of style, is in control of his agony. His personal agony has become aestheticized to the point that one can speak of a tortured dandyism. By now Cioran has turned “passion” into a style, a lifestyle. If Cioran’s early writings are too self-revelatory and therefore guilty of “clearing up too many of those misunderstandings essential to a writer’s secret fame” as Cioran said of Paul Valéry, his later writings, though obsessively returning to the same life experiences, treat them in a universal rather than personal way, with a drier, distanced, aphoristic style.31 The later French texts project Cioran’s private identity crisis into the tragedy of the human condition, moving, as Sorin Antohi says, from “the psychological abyss of stigmatized ethnic identity to the metaphysical plane of generic humanity. . . . When the question of identity is thus reoriented towards the entire humanity, the last traces of anxiety disappear, and Cioran, eternally obsessed with his roots, can finally escape from the metaphysical trap of stigmatization.”32 This transformation from the viscerally personal to the impersonal is clearly marked by a change of language, tone, and style in Cioran’s texts: from Romanian to French, from disheveled prose to the reticence of aphoristic fragments, from the vulgar forcefulness of prophecy and anathema to the elegant refinements of irony and paradox afforded by the eighteenth-century French style he deliberately chose as his model of writing. He chose to write in a language that was, by his own definition, universal, impersonal, and dead, and therefore best suited to his new condition as a writer without a language and without a country or a past. “Un idiome n’approche de l’universalité que lorsqu’il s’émancipe de ses origines, s’en éloigne et les renie” [A language only approaches universality when it is emancipated from its origins, distances itself from them and repudiates them].33 Thus eighteenth-century French became both the model and the means—a sort of steep shortcut—to satisfy his ambitious aspirations to universality. Alerted to this transformation, any reader of Cioran, and his intellectual biographer in particular, must question Cioran’s French reputation as a skeptical apatride (man without a country) and read all of his work in light of his life and times, as writings and rewritings of those years when the young Cioran was marching in step with his generation to the trumpets of History.\n\nFigure 1.

Even if I had been a logician, I would still have been an elegiacal man. Every day I relive the expulsion from Paradise with the same passion and the same regret as the one who was first banished. —Cioran, Cahiers, 683 I am not from here; condition of inner exile; I’m nowhere at home— absolute rootlessness. Paradise lost,—my constant obsession. —Cioran, Cahiers, 19 I have lived all my life with the feeling that I was chased away from my true place. If the phrase “metaphysical exile” had been deprived of meaning, my existence alone would have sufficed to give it one. —Cioran, “De l’inconvénient d’être né,” Œuvres, 1320\n\nThe Past’s Omnipresence: 21, rue de l’Odéon, Paris, July 1960 He lay fully clothed on his narrow cot in the unfamiliar attic room, staring at the gray light filtered through a small skylight in the ceiling. He preferred overcast skies; blue skies were troubling, stirring up one’s wanderlust. And now he had stopped wandering: for ten years, while living in furnished hotel rooms, Cioran had been dreaming\n\nRăşinari, Transylvania, 1911–1921 21\n\nof an apartment of his own. The dream had finally come true, but now it gave him little satisfaction. Having a home: if only God would forgive him such decadence! He was nowhere at home, he was the exile par excellence. He thought himself a passant, “en instance de depart, realité provisoire” [on the point of departure, provisional reality].1 He had been almost homeless all his life, moving from one city to another, farther and farther away from his birthplace: Răşinari, Sibiu, Bucharest, Berlin, Paris. Răşinari and Paris: the beginning and the end of his life’s journey. Farthest apart in time and space, they shared one advantage for him: they were both places “out of time.” The former was his childhood paradise, the latter was the “home” of his exile, which fed his vocation for marginality. Between them, they spanned history, and he abhorred history.2 He had felt homeless ever since the day he left his village in the Carpathian mountains to go to secondary school in the nearby old German town of Sibiu (Hermannstadt) in Transylvania.3 Now forty years had passed, and he could not forget the feeling of estrangement he experienced then. He saw himself, a sturdy, fair-haired child of ten, dressed in the stiff new school uniform, sitting on a load of hay in the back of a horse-drawn cart. His parents sat on the box in front. Though a priest, his father had enough of the peasant left in him to drive the horses himself. His robust back, draped in priestly black robes, rose straight and massive in front of his son’s eyes like an insurmountable obstacle or a terrible menace. The cart advanced slowly in the blue haze of an early September morning. The villagers on their way to their fields stopped and respectfully lifted their hats to greet them. They stared after the cart. The village priest’s son was going away to school. Like a wedding or a funeral, it was an event worthy of their attention. As the towers of Sibiu’s churches gradually came into view, his heart sank with despair. He burst into tears, sobbing with uncontrollable and unmitigated grief. His father was “tearing him away from the village he adored to the point of idolatry.” He had been used to running barefoot in the fields and hills of his native village from May to November, totally free. Suddenly he felt trapped. The outskirts of the approaching city were the new limits of his freedom, and his father’s bulky black shape, their guardian. His new clothes itched, his new shoes pinched. He felt as if his feet had sunk into an anthill and were being slowly eaten by the tireless insects. He shook with helpless rage. He wished the new school would disappear, wiped away by some disaster. One of his childhood friends had thought up an ingenious method to do away with school: he had rubbed their old country school with lard, hoping the dogs would eat it. It was an action of protest worthy of Rabelais’s Panurge. How well he understood the feeling that had prompted it!\n\n22 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran\n\nStill crying, he was duly delivered into the competent hands of two German sisters who ran a boarding house in Sibiu. On that fateful day, after his parents had left, he spent a long time at the window of his new home, looking sorrowfully after their cart, looking back toward the “one place in the world [he] loved most,” the village which for him was “the end of the world, or rather, the center.” It was a place to which he afterward returned only briefly for summer vacations, and where he would never go back to live again. But he entertained fantasies of return all his life, for “the farther the place is, the more attached to it one becomes.” As he grew older, childhood memories gained more and more terrain, pushing out all other memories. They were stored up in images that trampled on his thoughts. They threw themselves at him in disjointed fashion. They did not exactly prevent him from thinking, but they prevented his thoughts from expanding. Nostalgia boiled like poison in his blood. His childhood exploded like a bomb in front of his eyes. He saw it in small fragments, a shred of memory here, a splinter there.\n\nu Life didn’t suit him. He was made for a savage existence, for total solitude, outside of time, enclosed in a crepuscular paradise. Răşinari, his mountain village, what a splendid paradise! There, in that time before time, a young boy of six, dressed in white peasant clothes, ran barefoot through a narrow cobbled-stone lane, from after breakfast until noon, and then again from lunch till late at night—a pair of ragged pants, a coarse linen shirt flowing loose behind him. He ran toward the forbidden site, the gypsy settlement at the end of his village. Rounding up his friends with a promise of the raw sugar candy called bear shit (caca de urs) stolen from his grandmother’s store, the children played hide-and-seek (de-a hoţii şi jandarii) on a nearby hill—his beloved Coasta Boacii (Hill of the Boacis)—till night closed in on them. No one checked or interrupted his games. Why did he ever leave Coasta Boacii?\n\nu His calling had been to live in nature, not to read and write. He was not just at home in nature. He was a child of nature, a “wild beast,” fostered and reared by the river that ran behind his house and by the nearby wooded hills, which stretched toward the village like three knotty, rough fingers of a giant hand, reaching down from the lofty heights of the Carpathian mountains on the horizon. The river was Rîul Caselor, river of the houses. He practically lived in it, like a water creature. Through its clear, shallow water, he could see the bottom lined with round pebbles and small boulders, all smooth, shiny, slippery, covered with a thick short fur of yellow algae. He made the smooth pebbles skip along the surface of the water. He waded and splashed around all summer long. He bathed in the shade of the\n\nRăşinari, Transylvania, 1911–1921 23\n\nold walnut trees by the edge of the water, where he had dammed up the river with boulders, forming a small, dark pool, big enough for one child. Sometimes he would climb and hide inside the tree’s thick foliage, picking and eating the green walnuts that left a crisp, cool taste in his mouth. In winter, the frozen surface of the river rang with the noise of bundled-up children, pushing and shoving each other in primitive improvisations of ice hockey, an alternative to sledding on Coasta Boacii. The snow was piled high in the streets of Răşinari, with only a narrow path to make one’s way through it. His favorite snow route was the lane, ulitza, that led toward Trainei, a small shepherd settlement on the northern edge of the village. The lane was really a river bed, the Steaza, which came in tumultuously from the faraway mountains at one end of the village, slowed down as it traversed the village, and then continued on its way, flowing lazily into the plain stretching toward Sibiu. At the end of the ulitza in Trainei rose the ruins of an old Roman fortress, Cetaˇţuia, so beaten by weather and the passing of time that it looked more like part of the hill than a man-made structure. From its battlements, he participated in mythic snowball fights, little Romans defending themselves from barbarian onslaughts. He missed the snow more than anything. The swiftly melting snow in wet, desolate Paris was nothing like the enduring snows of Răşinari. Yet stepping in it, like Proust over the stones of Venice, brought back to him the memory of long, harsh winters in his remote mountain village, when the forest was still and mysterious under its heavy cape of snow. Wonderful, mythical Răşinari, in which the consciousness of time had not yet inserted itself, was borne back to him by the ephemeral snows of Paris. Why had he ever left it? Why did he ever leave Coasta Boacii?\n\nThe Exacerbation of Memory: 21, rue de l’Odéon, Paris, January 1970 But beside these ideal images lay others more disturbing. Winter nights in Răşinari were long and cold. They—he, his older sister, and his younger brother—lay huddled together in their night shifts to keep warm, on a bed erected above the wood-burning stove, while Aunt Stanca told terrifying bedtime stories of children stolen by the gypsies, murdered by demons, and of witches and fairies bathing naked at midnight in the river outside. They were alone in the old house except for mad Stanca and their grandmother: three little kids struck dumb with fear, staring at each other with huge worried eyes, too scared to venture out at night even for the most pressing needs, too scared even to sleep. It was past midnight. He lay still on his bed in Paris. His loneliness was so immense, it felt like cosmic destitution. He became accustomed to watch time flow during long waking hours, where one became one with the night, a palpable, “liquid\n\n24 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran\n\nnight.” He would count the seconds the way a prisoner, submitted to the water torture, counted the drops falling on his face. In this way he had learned to “perceive time’s detachment from what was not time, its autonomous existence, its particular status, its empire, its tyranny.”4 Memories of his distant childhood assailed him and turned the idea of origins into an obsession. He was born in a land where birth was considered a curse. He empathized with his clear-sighted ancestors. “Thracians and Bogomiles [primitive peoples of the region]—I can’t forget that I have roamed the same space as them, nor that the former cried over their newborn babies while the latter, to exculpate God, blamed Satan for the crime of Creation.”5 Birth was an inconvenience, monstrous, abnormal. It was much easier to think of it as an anomaly than as a natural fact. His own birth had been an unfortunate accident. It had made him a prisoner of life, of history. He first became aware of time at precisely three o’clock on a lazy summer afternoon when he was five years old. Like Wordsworth in Cumberland, this was a “spot of time” which Cioran chose as his self-defining moment. The world suddenly emptied before his very eyes.6 While his village slumbered in the heavy heat, with only the buzz of drones to disturb the stillness in the air, he felt dizzy with “a sort of unbearable anxiety.”7 Everything around him lost its meaning as if it had vanished; time became still yet palpable. It felt as if it had stopped flowing and was “detaching” itself from things. The world suddenly felt solitary, engulfed in an “essential void.” The experience lasted perhaps ten minutes, like an epileptic fit or a mystical ecstasy, yanking him from animal sleep into human insomnia, his adult malaise, a heightened, torturing consciousness of time. His real birth was not his biological one. If his trip to school in Sibiu at age ten severed him from his home place, his “fall into time” occurred on that lazy summer afternoon five years earlier, when he first experienced time as an “extraordinary frisson of spleen,” a “profoundly disturbing feeling,” a “complaisance à l’ennui,” to which he became so addicted that one could say of him what Saint-Simon said of Louis XV: “He was born bored.”8 To live where one was born should be the law for everyone. But it was not his. He was an exile. He worked hard at erasing the memory of his birthplace. And yet he lived in a space defined by nostalgia. He would suddenly remember things such as the color of the earth in the Răşinari cemetery, where he spent a good portion of his time during his early childhood. He knew it so well he could tell where every tomb had its place. His family had a garden next to the cemetery where he played. The old gravedigger became his friend and on many visits handed him freshly dug skulls to kick around. He played football with death. Afterward, cemeteries became favorite haunts. In Riul-Sadului, a small neighboring hamlet, there was a cemetery buried in wild, overgrown grass. On a rotting wooden cross, he had read a banality which exerted a great fascination on\n\nRăşinari, Transylvania, 1911–1921 25\n\nhim: “Life is hope, death is forgetfulness.”9 But his obsession was more medieval, with death as reality and life as the illusion.10 Exhausted from lack of sleep, he greeted every morning with a helpless and selfdestructive rage, impossible to control. He felt he would need centuries of British education to achieve self-mastery, but he came from a country where one still howled ritually at funerals. Why do I have to undergo this slow torture? he asked himself. The answer was always the same: “Because I was born.”11 His own birth was a “minor obsession,” a personal disease, symptom of a greater, all-engulfing “malaise of cosmic proportions.” In his youthful writings, he had tried to cure himself of this personal illness, but to no avail. His profound unhappiness with his own birth gave way to his more general malaise of being, “malaise dans l’être.” He wrote about this calamity, this absurdity, the act of birth, to cure himself of his obsession, just as he had cured himself of his obsession with suicide or with death. But until he wrote and published his book on the tragedy of birth, he would have no rest, no peace.\n\nThe Interpretations of Memory In later life, Cioran talked about his childhood with interviewers and wrote about it in his letters and his private journal. His early life, or rather his opinions and interpretations of it, shaped his philosophy. He was troubled by the fact that he was born in a marginal place whose role in history was so minor and abject that it was almost nonexistent. He felt that he was born with the “wrong” identity. The trauma of being born under humiliating historical circumstances marked his entire œuvre, gradually rising from a personal level into an existential and metaphysical drama. As we have seen, Cioran depicts himself as an energetic child, high-strung and hypersensitive but blissfully happy in the primitive world of his native village, driven out of that paradise by his father. These are his sunny memories of a splendid, timeless mountain village through which a robust little peasant boy, full of joie de vivre, moved aloof and alone, master of the universe. And then there are his troubled memories of a cursed mountain village in which history had wreaked havoc. There, a child of precocious sensibility, easily depressed, subject to fits of melancholy and absent-mindedness, and black humors that sent him sprawling on the floor in nervous spasms, he developed a double consciousness: of time and of its humiliations, its limits. Though the dominant memory is that of “une enfance couronnée,” a “crowned childhood,” “only calamities followed,” he said, after his departure from Răşinari. The “calamities” he speaks of were all versions of his going away to school: first to Sibiu, then to Bucharest, later to Berlin, and, finally, to Paris. Going away to school may not strike modern people, especially if they are English or American, as a “calamity.” But for Cioran, that relatively ordinary occurrence took on huge proportions and became\n\n26 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran\n\na unique event, so extraordinary that he placed it on the same level as Man’s original fall from grace. Its memory haunted him all his life, as he noted in his private diary: “Every day I relive the expulsion from Paradise with the same passion and the same regret as the one who was first banished.” Imaginatively, in light of that defining event, Cioran construed his entire life as exile into the world. If we are to believe his personal testimony, the sophisticated Parisian writer of existential malaise is none other than the little boy who “wept to dream again” and looked mournfully after his parents’ horse-drawn cart disappearing in the direction of his mountain village. After Răşinari, as Cioran put it, his “vocation for sadness and regret had become a vice,” curable only through writing. For the disconsolate tears of the little boy, the older man substituted pages of writing whose very titles speak of his enduring, mourning grief: The Trouble with Being Born, The Fall into Time, Syllogisms of Bitterness. The despair of being torn from a harmonious environment and being thrown into the world in utter solitude, as a hard-born baby is ripped from his mother’s womb, was translated into the writer’s predominant themes of decadence and exile—personal, political, artistic, and existential. The foundation stone on which the myth of a blissful childhood is erected is, paradoxically, the myth of its loss. Cioran’s strong sense of abandonment indicates a Romantic sensibility, of which he is keenly conscious: “If I think about it, my sensibility is of a romantic sort, that is, as I am incapable to believe in absolute values, I take my humors to be worlds, I consider them substitutes for the ultimate reality.”12 In other words, it suited his Romantic temperament to represent himself as an exile, and he deliberately adopted that stance as the central element of his life’s narrative. He looked for models in literary history and found a kindred spirit in Emily Brontë. That female Byron was a connoisseur of powerful emotions sprung from childhood attachments to wild, remote original places, which she turned into the mythical world of Wuthering Heights. In his journal, he noted that Emily Brontë, disconsolate for having left Haworth, was, in fact, “the only one” whose despair at being taken away from home matched his own. But if Cioran found his match in Emily Brontë’s intensity of despair, he could not find anyone to match the intensity of his happiness as a child: “I don’t know of anyone with a happier childhood than mine,” he told one interviewer. “I lived near the Carpathian mountains, playing freely in the fields and in the mountains, without any duties or obligations.”13 Cioran’s memories of mythical Răşinari emphasize the natural elements: the river, the snow, the hills and forests, but dwell little on the parental home. They situate the happy, carefree child outside his home, alone as if orphaned. Paradise does not have a history nor historical figures; it is only a landscape with wild life. “I was out in the mountains, from morning to night, like a wild beast,” he told another interviewer.14\n\nRăşinari, Transylvania, 1911–1921 27\n\nIn keeping with the romantic spirit that animates him, Cioran fondly and typically exaggerates the uniqueness of his happiness as a child, an exaggeration which in turn intensifies to the extreme his sense of loss. In his journal, he writes: When I think of my early years in the Carpathians, I must make an effort not to cry. It’s quite simple: I can’t imagine that anyone has had a childhood like mine. The earth and the sky belonged to me, literally. Even my apprehensions were happy. I woke up and went to bed as Master of the Universe.15\n\nThe child of nature, running free, naked, a miniature god, unfettered by social obligations and untainted by civilization, is of course a Romantic cliché, and comparable cases abound in Romantic literature from Rousseau and Wordsworth onwards. Echoing his Romantic models, Cioran recast for himself the myth of a perfect childhood, in which he, like Kierkegaard’s Adam, was troubled only by the dream of future loss: “I knew my happiness and felt I was going to lose it. A secret fear gnawed at me. I was not as happy as I now pretend to have been.”16\n\nThe Turn into History The myth of the “crowned childhood” of the child of nature, by short-circuiting history out of the picture, provides a wholesome, uncomplicated, unfissured matrix of identity. It is, however, only a cover for Cioran’s ambivalence toward his birthplace, and his perennial quest for a suitable identity. He both loved and hated Răşinari, which he called “ce maudit, ce splendide paradis,” this cursed and splendid paradise. It is no accident that he placed “cursed” before “splendid.” For when he was not moved by ripping regret and idealizing nostalgia, Cioran saw his birthplace as the site of ignominious historical beginnings, a paradise flawed by history. It is in this enchanted earthly paradise that “the Barbarians, rejects of the Great Invasions, of those hordes who, unable to continue their march towards the West, collapsed along the Carpathians and the Danube, where they hid and slumbered, a mass of deserters on the edge of the Empire, scum with a touch of Latinity.”17 The slothful blood of these original hordes contaminated subsequent generations, paralyzing their will to act and assert themselves in history. From this less sentimental perspective, the glow of the idyllic, peaceful little world fades and gives way to a historical nightmare, in which the streams, the woods, the valleys, and the “lofty heights” become the dwelling places of spell-bound peasants, trampled on by stronger people (Huns, Tartars, Slavs, Turks) who happen to pass through and sometimes settle in their midst. Accepting with resignation their role as victims of the whims and slights of history, “ageless, fond of their torpor, and practically bursting with dazed mindlessness,” the natives live like “petrified larvae,” lost in a “geological dream.”18\n\n28 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran\n\nThe question naturally arises: What are the historical facts that determine Cioran’s double vision—on the one hand idealized and sanitized to the point of cliché, on the other negative and problematic—of his own past? Emil Cioran first saw the light of day on April 8, 1911, the second of three children born to Emilian Cioran, one of the Orthodox village priests and his twenty-two-yearold wife, Elvira Comanici. They already had a three-year-old daughter, Virginia (Gica), and two years later Cioran’s younger brother, Aurel (Relu), would be born. As the oldest son, Cioran was given his father’s name. Emil(ian) is not a traditional peasant name. It is a Roman, Latin name—as are Virginia and Aurel(ian)—chosen by the parents expressly for its Roman connection. The choice of a Roman name for a Romanian child in multi-national Transylvania of the Austro-Hungarian empire was a political statement. Like many other children of educated Romanians, the Cioran children were given names that were meant, first, to affirm the Latin origins of the Romanian people, as opposed to the non-Latin origin of the other nationalities of the region, the Hungarians and Germans, and, second, to suggest that as the descendants of the Romans, the original colonizers of the province, the Romanians had more right to exist on its territory than the other populations, who arrived later during the Middle Ages. Cioran’s first name thus already marks the newborn child twice, investing him with a split identity. As a Roman name, it claims that he is a son or citizen of Rome, legitimizes his birth, placing him in a noble, heroic lineage. However, as a Romanian name—that is, the kind of name used by a certain class of Romanians—it sets him apart as marginal and lower caste in another empire, the Austro-Hungarian, where the Romanians’ right to be is questioned and their existence merely tolerated. In its former capacity, the name participates in a national fiction of self-definition and survival; in the latter, it denotes a historical reality. On the other hand, his family name marks him literally as a black sheep even among his own people. According to the genealogist Mihai Rădulescu, “cioran” derives from a Slavic word for black and was applied to black sheep (and their shepherds) who ranged far away beyond the Carpathians in winter, sometimes as far as the Crimea.19 If any Cioran might be said to have fulfilled the destiny of his etymology, it was E. M. Cioran, whom we might call a “black sheep” in spades. Furthermore, generations of Romanians in Transylvania had been haunted by a need for self-definition which they hoped would lead to political self-determination. Like all other Romanian nationals born in pre–World War I Transylvania, Cioran inherited at his birth an “identity problem” which was existential in a literal sense, since\n\nRăşinari, Transylvania, 1911–1921 29\n\nthe very existence of Romanians in the Austro-Hungarian province was questioned on political and historical rather than metaphysical grounds. Thus Cioran’s various names each reflect something of the entire controversial history of Transylvania. A real geographical region, not a fictional Dracula-land, Transylvania is situated on a high plateau of thick dark forests, broad shallow rivers, and golden wheat and cornfields, enclosed within the wide ring formed by the tail end of the Southern Carpathian mountains and comprising an area twice the size of Belgium. Formerly a Roman province known as Dacia Felix, and then an autonomous feudal principality ruled by various warring Hungarian princes during the Middle Ages, Transylvania was annexed by Austria in 1691. Romanians, though the predominant population— in 1785, for example, they accounted for 63.5% of the total population of Transylvania versus 24% Hungarians and 12.5% Saxons—were mostly peasants or serfs and had the status of only a “tolerated nation.” That is, they had no political rights and did not function as an active group in the political life of the country.20 With the exception of one brief interlude (1861–65) when, legally if not in practice, the equality of the Romanians of Transylvania with the other nations of the empire was recognized by the Austrian court, the history of the Romanian nation right up to 1918 is the history of a “tolerated” people, struggling for recognition of their right to exist.21 To overcome their status as tolerated nation, the Romanians of Transylvania searched mainly for institutional solutions. In the absence of an indigenous noble class to provide leadership, the Romanian clergy were instrumental in this struggle for national rights. Throughout the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, the Romanians of Transylvania sent memorandum after memorandum to Vienna pleading for the removal of the status of “tolerated nation” and for equality and official recognition as an independent nation in Austria’s constitution. Their plea for political reform rested on arguments about their “historical right” to existence, owing to their direct descent from the original Roman colonizers of the province and their uninterrupted presence in Transylvania after the Roman retreat.22 During the eighteenth century, as an emerging class of lay intellectuals, teachers, historians, and editors took on the task of national emancipation, political nationalism was coupled with an “active cultural nationalism.”23 Aware of their nation’s cultural backwardness, Romanian intellectuals believed that political emancipation would follow in the wake of cultural and spiritual renaissance. Education and culture were therefore seen as the principal means for shaping the people’s national consciousness\n\n30 The Romanian Life of Emil Cioran\n\nor, in the words of a popular patriotic song, for “waking the Romanians from their death-like sleep.” In Transylvanian history, Răşinari, Cioran’s birthplace, is distinguished as a hub of organized national resistance, “a bastion of the Romanian national consciousness.”24 Established in 1204, Răşinari struggled to survive as an independent community. The early date is important in a region where the Romanians’ right to exist was constantly challenged: it shows the continuity of a thriving, industrious Romanian community of small land owners, with long-standing connections on both sides of the border, who during the Middle Ages acted as servientes castri, border patrols. The history of the village’s fight to preserve its independent status is the history of a centuries-long unequal fight between the ever richer and more powerful Saxons of Sibiu encroaching upon the rights of the unprotected Romanians. It involved the gradual erosion of the Romanians’ landowning privileges and, despite fierce resistance, their steady slide into serfdom.25 In the region, the peasants from Răşinari have a reputation for “toughness” and “meanness,” an invidious reflection of their positive character traits: seriousness, intelligence, pride. Unlike Romanian peasants elsewhere, “shyly humble, used to all kinds of masters,” the peasant from Răşinari is supposed to be proud, independent, and loath to ask for favors or do hu"
