The individuals who inhabited this expansive territory built cities, cultures, kingdoms, and religions that impacted their locality and the world around them in manifold ways. The series is particularly keen to include studies on traditionally underrepresented subjects in Anglophone scholarship (such as medieval eastern Europe) and to consider submissions from scholars not natively writing in English in an effort to increase the diversity of Anglophone publishing on the greater medieval European world.

Sergiu Musteaţă\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION THE EARLY MIDDLE Ages are of special importance for European history, as this period marks the genesis of many peoples, of state formation, and of the affirmation of feudal relations. This work spans almost two centuries, from the end of the seventh until the late ninth century. During this time a series of political, military, economic, social, and religious transformations took place. The lower chronological limit is marked by the migration of the Bulgars south of the Danube (680/​681), and the upper limit coincides with the movement of the Hungarians from the Eastern European steppes to the Carpathian Basin (895/​896). This span includes significant events in the history of Central and Southeastern Europe. The Avar Kaganate controlled not only the Pannonian Steppe but also some regions east of the Tisza up to the Western Carpathians, which has been proven by the Avar graves and cemeteries identified in these areas. The Bulgarians’ settlement south of the Danube and the creation of a new political power changed political realities in the region and directly contributed to the distancing of relations between Byzantium and the North-​Danube regions. The situation in the ninth century directly affected the so-​called political silence in the Carpathian-​Danubian regions (Map 1). Political reshuffling in the North-​Danube areas began with the liquidation of Avar power and was followed by the division of spheres of influence between the Franks, the Moravians, and the Bulgarians. The appearance of the Hungarians at the mouth of the Danube and their conflicts with the powers and populations in the region led to the establishment of their control over the Pannonian Steppe and some other regions east of the Tisza in the late ninth century and beginning of the tenth century. Geographical Boundaries. The appearance and evolution of human beings was and is closely linked to natural factors, but human interactions with the natural environment have still only been modestly investigated.1 Therefore, during historical research, it is necessary to know the peculiarities of the geographical environment (relief, hydrography, climate, vegetation, etc.) and their connections with the anthropic factor.2 The research is geographically bounded by natural landmarks, such as the Tisza, Danube, and Dniester Rivers to the west, east and south, to the southeast by the Black Sea coast, and to the north by the northern Bukovina region (Map 1). This area is known in the literature as the Carpathian-​Danubian region, as the Carpathian-​Danubian-​Pontic 1 V. Cucu, Geografia populaţiei şi aşezărilor umane, 2nd ed. (Bucureşti, 1981); F.

At the same time, the space included in this work is not separated from neighbouring territories, especially since the regions to the east of the Carpathians fall within the context of the North-​Pontic and East-​European steppes, while those from the west fall within the extensive areas of the Pannonian Steppe. The Carpathian-​Danubian space is a macro-​territorial system, the result of a long paleogeographical evolution, and a component part of the European continent, having Central and East-​European, Balkan and Pontic interferences.3 In this part of Europe, several forms of reliefs conjoin, such as seashores, plains, plateaus, hills, and depressions, and these constitute the morphological structural steps of the area (mountains, hills and plateaus, and plains, including coastal platforms). Thus, the geographical environment in the north of the Lower Danube is quite varied and complex.4 The geo-​system of the region is thus a harmonious unity of geological, relief, hydrographical network, socio-​ economic, and human-​ordered elements (Map 1). The landscape is determined by the geological structure of the region, the result of a continuous development process that influenced the formation of other elements of the environment (the hydrography, soils, flora and fauna, human settlements, economy etc.). The component parts of the Carpathian-​Danubian-​Pontic geographical macro-​system are proportional, symmetrical, and concentrically disposed towards the Carpathians. From the territorial point of view, we can distinguish seventeen geographical regions: the Eastern Carpathians, the Curvature Carpathians, the Southern Carpathians, the Banat Mountains and the Western Carpathian Mountains, the Transylvanian Plateau (Depression), the sub-​Carpathians, the Hills of Banat, the Hills of Crișana and Sylvania, the Moldovan Plateau, the Getic Plateau, the Mehedinți Plateau, the Dobrogea Plateau, the Western Plain, the Romanian Plain, the Delta, and the coastal platform (Map 1).5 The diversity of the relief directly influences human activities carried on its surface. The Carpathian Mountains form the backbone of a geographical macro-​system. The Carpathians are part of the longest mountain chain in Europe6 and are made up of two areas, the Beskid and the Danube-​Pontic. They form a mountain range 1,500 km long and up to 180 km wide. The Carpathians are mountains of medium and low height, with an average height of 840 m, while peaks of over 2,000 m are rare and those exceeding 2,500 m are exceedingly rare. The average altitude oscillates in the east between 1,100 m and 1,300 m, 1,500–​1,700 m in the south, and in the west between 800 m and 1,000 m. The circular shape of the Carpathians, enclosing the Transylvanian Depression, imposed a circular radial structure on the Carpathian-​Danubian territory that influenced 3 V.

Ştefănescu (Timişoara, 2004), 217.\n\n3\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nthe organization of the socio-​political and economic system of the region throughout its history. Thus, around the Carpathians, there is a large staircase of plateaus and plains, bounded by the medium quaternary of three rivers: the Tisza, the Danube, and the Dniester. The Carpathian passes and passages are not major forms of relief, but by facilitating circulation with the Carpathian regions they constitute an important feature of the evolution of habitats in the region.7 The highlands include forested hills, depressions, and valleys that were deforested and cultivated, with some maintaining meadows and patches of woods. The hills, owing to fertile soils, grasslands, forest, and fauna resources, have been appreciated by the people factor since ancient times. From a strategic point of view the hills used to be a defensive zone, located between the mountain and the steppe regions; such as, for example, in the case of the Eastern Carpathians and the Ponto-​Caspian steppes.8 The plains are the lowest land area, with little or no slope. These plains stretch from the Trotuş and Delta to the Oaș Mountains, with a small break at the Danube Gorge. The Romanian Plain is linked with the Southern and Curvature Carpathians bounded by the Lower Danube Plain in the south and divided into the Gaetic Plain and the Eastern Plain (of Bugeac). In the north, the maximum elevation is approximately 250 m, and the average elevation of the Northern Plain is approximately 200 m, reduced to the south and east to a mere 10 m and 5 m respectively. The Tisza Plain (the Western Lowland, or Banat-​Crisana), a component part of the Pannonian Basin, is influenced by the Western Mountains, the Banat Mountains, and the Tisza River.9 The hydrographical network of the region is made up of rivers, lakes of various types, ground-​waters, and the Black Sea. Most rivers originate in the Carpathian Mountains, collect in the Danube, and flow to the Black Sea, thus forming the Carpathian-​Danubian network.10 The rivers that cross the Carpathian-​Danubian basin are grouped into several hydrographical networks: intra-​ Carpathian, extra-​Carpathian, and trans-​Carpathian. They have their sources mostly in the Carpathian and sub-​Carpathian regions. The number of lakes in this area is quite large and they have various origins: ice, volcanoes, natural dams, or human activity. At the same time, we can distinguish several categories of natural lakes: mountainous, hill, plateau, plains, and sea. The climate is one of the geographical factors that has a significant influence on the evolution of the natural and the anthropic environment of each region. The Carpathian-​ Danubian space is located approximately halfway between the Atlantic side of the continent and the conventional limit with Asia, which provides a temperate continental climate with four clearly marked seasons and a continuous change in the length of day and night. The location of the region at the junction of the western, eastern, northern, and southern climate brings warmer wet air from the west. In the winter, drier, frostier 7 Posea, Geografia fizică, 71.\n\n8 L.

From the north comes cold and wet air, and from the south, the air brings drought in summer and warm air with rain in the winter.11 The diversity of the landscape, especially that of the Carpathian chain, greatly influences the movement of air masses and thus generates large climatic differences (Map 1). The problematic of the proposed subject is both pertinent and important, for this project addresses and completes different aspects of the history of the Carpathian-​ Danubian space in the eighth and the ninth centuries. Over the years it has lost none of its relevance; on the contrary, it has generated new and novel interpretations, visions, and, solutions for a number of issues concerning the lifestyle of the inhabitants to the north of the Lower Danube in the early Middle Ages. In 1978 Dan Gh. Teodor states: “The evolution of civilization in Moldova during the seventh and the ninth centuries was presented in the Romanian literature incompletely, due to the large number of archaeological findings from this era, it remained unpublished for a long time.” From then until today many things have changed, but the problem of publication of archaeological materials remains actual and common to all states.12 The proposed issues are currently important, as they are not sufficiently addressed in contemporary historiography. Also, we should note that the geographical area proposed for research, has been the focus of attention from the great powers from the medieval period to the present, which has resulted in a different historical consideration and interpretation of historical and archaeological realities of these regions. The given subject of study, although it began to be intensely studied in the 1950s, still remains relevant and is complemented by new archaeological discoveries. In these circumstances, there is a need for a review and an overview of the history of the Carpathian-​Danubian space in the eighth and ninth centuries based on a complex analysis of the historical sources available today. The lack of a work of synthesis covering the major archaeological discoveries on the territories between the Tisza and the Dniester, referring to this time, together with the numerous contradictions in the previous publications have confirmed the importance of what follows; a synthetic treatment regarding the history of the regions to the north of the Lower Danube during the eighth and ninth centuries.13 The purpose of this book is to re-​examine the history of the Carpathian-​Danubian region during the eighth and the ninth centuries. Thus, the central task is to provide an overview on the historical realities to the north of the Lower Danube over two centuries. Writing this book began from the desire to develop a synthetic study through which we will reconstruct the history of the Carpathian-​Danubian region during the eighth and ninth centuries based on narrative, archaeological, and numismatic sources. The diversity of issues presented by such a study requires analysing the following topics in 11 Posea, Geografia fizică, 19.\n\n12 D. Gh. Teodor, Teritoriul est-​carpatic în veacurile V–​XI e.n. (Iaşi, 1978), 67.\n\n13 A. Tvauri’s contribution could be an example of such work: Andres Tvauri, The Migration Period, Pre-​Viking Age, and Viking Age in Estonia, Estonian Archaeology 4 (Tartu: Tartu University Press, 2012).\n\n5\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nsuccession: the historiography of the problem, the particularities of the human habitat, the reconstitution of economic occupations, the establishment of the features of spiritual life, the evolution of social relations, the chronological and ethnic affiliation of discoveries, the reconstitution of the political history of the region, and so on. The achievement of this goal, the objectives, and the proposed plan rely on examination of the composition of the repository of sites and archaeological findings from the Carpathian-​Danubian regions during the eighth and ninth centuries. Thus, I will try to point out some issues related to the eighth and the ninth centuries, seeking to contribute thereby to the fixing of an image that would allow for an updated scientific interpretation of the early Middle Ages in the regions to the north of the Lower Danube (Map 1). The study presents a reconstruction of the socio-​economic, ethnic, cultural, and ultimately political history of the aforementioned area in the eighth and ninth centuries based on the analysis of the narrative and archaeological sources known so far. In this book, for the first time, the archaeological remains from the Carpathian-​Danubian regions (Banat, Crișana, Maramureș, Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia, including Bukovina and Bessarabia) are presented as organic unities, which, despite representing inherent parts of a well-​defined geographical area over several decades, have previously been dealt with separately, without generalizations performed at the macro-​ region level (Map 1). Thus, the work fills a substantial gap in the historiography and puts in a new light the historical and the archaeological issues relating to the eighth and ninth centuries. In terms of technique and methodology, the realization of the work represents a critical and comparative analysis of the narrative, archaeological, and numismatic data regarding the Carpathian-​Danubian regions in the eighth and ninth centuries. This work claims a broad and multifaceted analysis of data and historical phenomena in a clearly defined geographical and chronological framework, as well as the application of the methods of critical and comparative analysis of historical sources, statistical, cartographical, stratigraphic, and chronological data. The application of the above-​mentioned methods has made it possible to reveal the general and special features of human habitats in the Carpathian-​Danubian space during the eighth and ninth centuries. In the absence of written sources that directly relate to the eighth and the ninth centuries, the main source base used is the results of archaeological investigations, which for decades have accumulated information about the lifestyle of the population in the Carpathian-​Danubian space in the given period. Through modern methods of collecting and analysing historical data we have compiled the register of discoveries, comprising the majority of archaeological sites (settlements, hillforts, cemeteries, graves, and funerary findings of uncertain nature), as well as numismatic findings from the proposed area for the investigation chronologically assigned to the eighth and the ninth centuries. The repository was drawn up alphabetically and separately for each country (Romania, Moldova, Serbia, Ukraine, and Hungary), and comprises a total of 2,595 archaeological points (Table 1, Chart 1, Map 2). The obtained data were afterward analysed from the statistical, typological, and cartographical points of view. The register of archaeological findings is the basis of this work. Recording them in a single database enabled us to perform a typological systematization (settlements,\n\n6\n\n6 Introduction\n\nhillforts, cemeteries, caves, cemeteries, and singular graves), combining the analysis of archaeological materials with the historical synthesis and generalization, while mapping these sites revealed regional groupings of settlements in the eighth and ninth centuries. The mapping of these records was realized with the help of computer programs, based on the exact geographical coordinates of each locality (latitude and longitude). Every point on the map corresponds to a contemporary village. The localities with many archaeological points are collapsed into one single point. In situations where points are part of the different typological categories, they are visible on each map, and in the case of settlements, they have to be combined with the register of discoveries. Based on published archaeological data we are able to analyse and describe the peculiarities of human habitat (construction typology, economic occupations, rites, and rituals, etc.) in the Carpathian-​Danubian in the eighth and ninth centuries. By comparison, I have tried to highlight certain characteristic features of one or another region because then we can discuss issues regarding the cultural and ethnic affiliations of these discoveries. The importance of the subject lies in the elucidation of some significant and actual problems that have been insufficiently and incompletely researched to date.14 Different aspects of the material and spiritual life of the inhabitants of the Carpathian-​Danubian regions in the eighth and the ninth centuries and their relations with their neighbouring peoples have been analysed successively and in a complex way. For the first time, the archaeological findings from the Carpathian-​Danubian space, including the territories between the Tisza and the Dniester, which are now the component parts of the Republic of Moldova, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, and Hungary, have been thoroughly analysed (Map 2). I hope for this study to become a tool in advancing our historical knowledge of the region. The obtained results can be used in further research on the historical development of the territories to the north of the Lower Danube or in producing synthetic studies on the early Middle Ages in Europe.\n\n14 Şt.

Studying the historical sources and the extant historiography will allow us to determine both the volume and the quality of the information currently known, based on which our scientific research on the history of the Carpathian-​Danubian space in the eighth and ninth centuries can be realized. Historical sources are a set of information which constitutes the cultural heritage of mankind. Each work of historical research stems from analysis of the sources from which it can be developed. A separate critical analysis of narrative and archaeological sources and then their collation and dissection will allow us to support some conclusions about the historical realities to the north of the Lower Danube in the eighth and ninth centuries. However, we must consider the lack of internal narrative sources in reference to the history of the Carpathian-​Danubian regions in the eighth and ninth centuries, while the number of external narratives is small and their content is often controversial.\n\nWritten Sources\n\nIn the absence of direct written sources, foreign internal narrative sources occasionally refer to the early medieval histories of the territories to the north of the Lower Danube, often having a very general or even contradictory character. Some Byzantine, Russian, Hungarian, and Oriental sources from the eighth and the ninth centuries describe certain events from the seventh–​tenth centuries which have a direct or a tangential connection with either the territories to the north of the Danube or the people who lived in or passed through these areas. The style, the quality of the content, and the veracity of these early medieval sources have attracted the attention of historians for a long time.1 The most numerous narrative sources on the Carpathian-​Danubian regions are Byzantine sources. The Byzantine Writings\n\nThe Byzantine writings regarding the Danube regions in the second half of the first millennium are quite general. If for the sixth–​seventh centuries Byzantine reports on the situation in the Lower Danube and with the Empire’s confrontations with these tribes\n\n1 N.-​Ş.

The number of the Byzantine narrations from the eighth century is limited, only Synkellos Georgios describes certain moments, more linked to the beginning of the ninth century than to the end of the eighth century.2 This situation is due to the passage of the Bulgarians to the south of the Danube and to the creation of the Bulgarian Khanate in 681, which broke the links between Byzantium and the Danube regions. In the ninth century, the Byzantines carried on a series of wars with the Bulgarian Khanate; it was only after the Christianization of the Bulgarians that Byzantine politics again turned towards the Danube territories that had once belonged to them. This process continued in the subsequent centuries and would be completed with the restoration of Byzantine control of the Danube at the end of the tenth century. This shift in Byzantine politics is also reflected in an increasing number of reports on the situation in the Danube regions in the eleventh–​ twelfth centuries. For the events of the late seventh century, we should mention the Chronograph, by Theophanes Confessor, who continued the work of Georgios Synkellos.3 In addition to the information on relations between Byzantium and the Avars,4 the author describes the Bulgarian arrival in the Danube regions (680–​681), noting that they had settled temporarily in Onglos, the territory located between the rivers the Danapris, the Danastris, and the Danube.5 Theophanes Confessor writes that Asparuh managed to cross the Danube in 679, following the incident when the Byzantine fleet retired, believing that the Emperor Constantine IV (668–​685) ran away from his enemies, and the Bulgarians settled in the country that was “then under the protection of Christians,”6 also mentioning that the Sclavins organized into “seven peoples or tribes, including the Severians.”7 Confrontations between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines during the seventh–​tenth centuries were often mentioned in the works of many Byzantine authors: Nichifor, the Patriarch of Constantinople;8 the Patriarch Fotie,9 Georgios Monachos,10 Leo Grammaticus,11 and Genesios.12 Out of a range of similar claims, none of the Byzantine authors refer to the political and cultural situation in the Carpathian-​ Danubian regions. 2 Fontes Historiae Dacoromanae (FHDR) 2 (Bucureşti, 1970): 589. 3 FHDR 2, 591. 4 FHDR 2, 617. 5 FHDR 2, 619. 6 FHDR 2, 619. 7 FHDR 2, 621.\n\n8 FHDR 2, 625–​27. 9 FHDR 2, 637.\n\n10 FHDR 2, 633–​35. 11 FHDR 2, 647. 12 FHDR 2, 655.\n\n9\n\nSources\n\n9\n\nAn important source for the history of the Danube regions is the work of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (913–​959), De Imperio Administrando,13 in which the author describes several events regarding the ethnic, political, and religious situation of the Danube regions. The author informs us that the Emperor Constantine IV, in order to strengthen their positions in the face of the Bulgarians’ expansion, created thema Thracia, subsequently divided into three: Bulgaria, Istros, and Haemus. The Byzantine emperor describes the political situation to the north of the Danube in the ninth century, noting that, “in front of the fortress Distra stretches the Pecenegs’ country,” which was bordered in the north by the Russians.14 The author locates the Cavar and the Hungarian on the rivers Timiş, Tutis, Mureş, Criş, and Tisza.15 Also, abandoned old hillforts in the fords across the river Dniester have been recorded and in the interior of their constructions traces of churches with crosses carved in the tuff have been observed. This offers evidence that the Romeii once had settlements here.16 The association of C. Porfirogenetus’ claims with the cultural realities in the ninth and tenth centuries on the Dniester is hard to prove. This is due to the fact that there have not been any known settlements and Christian cemeteries in the Middle Dniester regions to date. In this situation, we must consider the fact that those who informed the Byzantine emperor could have transmitted very general and, presumably, even wrong information. Indeed, on the Lower Dniester and the Răut there are several cave complexes that belonged to or where Christian communities were present, but this could have happened much later. The emergence and the existence of monastic structures, without political support and without an ecclesiastical structure, are difficult to imagine in the ninth century. We do not exclude the possibility of the occasional emergence of hermits or monks fleeing from the Empire into the Dniester regions, especially in the iconoclastic period, who, nevertheless, did not have enough capacity to build large churches amongst pagan communities. Moreover, since the second half of the tenth century, late migrations were gaining momentum, which, in successive waves, directly affected the regions between the Prut and the Dniester. The Byzantine Emperor’s statements on the existence of abandoned cities and churches and the crosses carved in the rock on the right bank of the Dniester most likely refer to the territories of Dobrogea, where the churches carved in the rocks dating from the tenth century have been certified (see Basarabi Murfatlar), and his statement that “that is why it is said by tradition that the Romeii that once had 13 FHDR 2, 657, 660–​61; 666–​67.\n\n14 FHDR 2, 669. Describing the areas controlled by the Pechenegs, the Byzantine emperor writes: “The land of the Pechenegs includes all the lands to Russia and Bospor and to Kherson and to Sarat, Vurat and to other parties. Its length from the River Danube to the Dnieper is 120 miles. From the Dniester to the Dnieper there are 80…,” C.

That is because, along the Lower Dniester, except the Tyras fortress, neither the Greeks nor the Byzantines built fortresses, most of their efforts being concentrated on the present territory of Dobrogea and the Crimea. Therefore we believe that the claims of the emperor C. Porfirogenetus do require ­critical analysis. As regards the ethnicity of some of the peoples that reached the Lower Danube, the Emperor Constantine Porfirogenetus, in the work De thematibus, called late Turanic migrants, arriving near the Danube in the ninth century, “Scythians,” and their territory “the land of the Scythians,”17 pointing out that the Protobulgarians were also, before reaching the area south of the Danube, called “the Onogurs.”18 In the case of this mention and in other cases we must be very careful, as the Byzantine writers named one region or another taking into account historical tradition (e.g. The Land of Scythians referring to the North-​Pontic steppes) or the military elites that controlled these regions (the Scythians, the Avars, the Bulgarians, the Hungarians). In 837–​838 they mention the inhabitants of Adrianople returning—​the survivors of the 10,000 deported in 831 by the Bulgarian Khan Krum into “Bulgaria across the Danube”19 to the south of the Danube by the Byzantine fleet. This was an event that raised broader historiographical debates and to which we will return throughout this book. Genesios mentioned, in the context of the description of the events in the first half of the ninth century, the ethnic diversity of mercenaries in the imperial army of the Emperor Theophilus (829–​842): “the polyglot army of the Slavs, the Huns, the Vandals, the Gets.”20 It is true that the Byzantine army was made up of various ethnic elements, especially if we consider allies of the Byzantines. However, the presence of some historic populations in the Byzantine army during the ninth century, such as the Huns, the Vandals, and the Gets, is explained, in all likelihood, mostly by this historical tradition and the fact that these soldiers had come from the regions previously inhabited or controlled by the peoples nominated by Genesios. The writings of high value for the early medieval history of the Danube regions are those of the following Byzantines: Leo the Deacon,21 Ioannes Skylitzes-​Georgios Kedrenos,22 Ioannes Zonaras,23 Theophanes Confessor,24 Nicephoros,25 Georgios 17 About the provinces, FHDR 2, 669, 671. 18 FHDR 2, 671.\n\n19 Simeon Magister, FHDR 2,631; Leo Grammaticus, FHDR 2, 651–​53.\n\n20 In all likelihood, the author used a range of archaic names for the populations of the ninth century, FHDR 2, 655.\n\n21 The work, written around 992, provides information on shipments of Russian princes on Byzantium. FHDR 2, 677. 22 In the work Compedium Historiarum, it is also written about the murder of the Prince Sviatoslav by the Pechenegs on his return to Kiev from the Danube, FHDR 3, 136–​43. 23 Chronicon, FHDR 3, 216–​17. 24 FHDR 2, 591. 25 FHDR 2, 625.\n\n11\n\nSources\n\n11\n\nMonachos,26 the Patriarch Fotie,27 Simeon Magister,28 Leo the Wise,29 Theophanes Continuatus,30 Suidas,31 and so on. The mention of the so-​called “episcopal chair of the Scythians and the Avars and of the Danube River” found in the Daco-​Romanae Fontes Historiae, (vol. 2, 639), is a confusion due to ignorance of the source context. In reality, the passage from Notitia Episcopatuum describes only the limit of papal jurisdiction and does not refer to a particular bishop of the Scythians and the Avars.32 However, most of these mentions go beyond the chronological and geographical framework analysed in this book and refer to either a later period (tenth–​eleventh centuries) or to the regions to the south of the Danube River. Therefore we will not involve them in this study. Bulgarian Sources (Epigraphic)\n\nFrom the time of Omurtag, there have been two attested epigraphic inscriptions on tombstones. The first inscription, in Greek, on a stone column, mentions a campaign waged north of the Danube by the Bulgarians, who went through the south of Moldova and came up to the Dnieper, where Kopan Okorses was killed. The source does not mention against whom the Bulgarian expedition was organized, but from the political circumstances of the time, it appears that they could have been the Hungarians.33 The second inscription describes another Bulgarian military expedition, this time to the Tisza river region, where Tarkan Onegavon(ais) was killed.34 This fact can be attributed to the fighting between the Bulgarians and the Slavic rulers from the Pannonian Steppe (early ninth century). Russian Sources\n\nImportant information about the historical situation in the Carpathian-​Danubian regions during the ninth–​eleventh centuries is provided by the old Russian chronicles. In the chronicle Povest’ Vremennyh Let, attributed to Nestor, it is stated that the Hungarians, after they had crossed the Carpathians, “began to struggle with the Vlachs and the Slavs 26 FHDR 2, 633. 27 FHDR 2, 637. 28 FHDR 2, 631. 29 FHDR 2, 643. 30 FHDR 2, 673. 31 FHDR 2, 699.\n\n32 Madgearu, “Românii,” 323.\n\n33 V.

Hungarian Sources\n\nOne of the most disputed medieval chronicles in modern and contemporary historiography is Gesta Hungarorum, by an anonymous notary of the Hungarian King Bela I of the eleventh century.37 Only the first fifty-​seven chapters have reached us. In its contents, we can find historical, political, demographic, economic, and ethnic data. The Hungarian chronicler noted that when the Hungarians came in Pannonian Steppe and the regions to the east of the Tisza they met several duchies inhabited by sclauij, Bulgari jet Blachij, ac pastores Romanorum.38 Thus, Gelu, quidam Blacus, who ruled over terra Ultrasilvania,39 is remembered in the Plateau of the Tisza in the late ninth century, which was inhabited by the Blasii et Sclavii. Menumorut resided in the city of Biharea,40 and Glad in the fortress Ursoua. Another medieval chronicle was that of Simon of Keza, who, in Chronicon Hungaricum, written in the late thirteenth century during the reign of the King Ladislas IV (1272–​1290), stated that the Blacki lived in Pannonia during the reign of Attila after his death, referring to the route covered by the Hungarians to the upper valley of the Tisza and their attacks against the Romanian duchies.41 Western Sources\n\nAnnales Regni Francorum stands apart from the other early medieval western chronicles referring to events in the Carpathian Basin and reporting on the conflicts between the Avars and the Franks, together with the Fuldenses Annals that refer to Byzantine-​Bulgarian 35 Povest’ Vremennyh Let, čast’ pervaja, tekst i perevod D.S. Lihačev (Moskva-​Leningrad, 1950), 217. 36 Povest’ Vremennyh Let, 20–​21, 23, 33.\n\n37 The Hungarian chronic that is known as “P. dictus magister ac quondam bone memorie gloriosissimi bele regis hungarie notarius…” or Anonymus. The fact that the notary mentions in his chronicle the events only until the year 1050/​1060 makes us believe that he wrote his chronicle in the time of the King Bela I. In the literature it is considered that it could have been the notary of the Hungarian King Bela III (1172–​1196). 38 Cronica Notarului Anonymus. Faptele Ungurilor, trans. P.

However, the source refers to the marketing of salt from the Transylvanian regions and to the areas of expansion of the Frankish kingdom eastwards and of the Bulgarian Khanate northwest.42 Oriental Sources\n\nGeography, attributed to an Armenian who lived in the ninth century, Moise Chorenaţ’i, where the land of Balak is mentioned, seems to have had Anania Sirakaţ’i from the eighth century as the author in reality, according to the conclusions of specialist armenologists, and the passage at issue is a late interpolation, in all likelihood from the beginning of the second millennium.43 The old Turanic chronicle Oguzname is of special interest for the political situation at the mouth of the Danube during the tenth–​thirteenth centuries, as it mentions the presence of the Romanians (Ulak) at the beginning of the twelfth century in the context of Cumanian invasions. However, the chronicle reports Hungarians leaving Etelköz and their settlement in the northern-​pontic regions in 895.44 As it is correctly observed by some archaeologists, the modest nature of written sources on the early medieval historical realities of the Carpathian-​Danubian regions does not allow us to stick to the idea of a “silence of sources.”45 The lack of Byzantine interest in the Danube regions in the seventh–​tenth centuries is explained by the political situation in these regions (the migration of some populations and imperial border withdrawal to the south of the Danube). Thus, the political situation had limited the Byzantine authors as to sources of direct information about the situation in this region. It resulted in the numerical modesty, confusion, and inaccuracy of these sources. We must also take into account the fact that in the Byzantine historical tradition there was frequent use of some archaic names regarding the names of neighbouring peoples, so that “Scythians” or “Avars” referred, practically, to all the inhabitants of the Lower Danube regions,46 and the Khazars, the Hungarians, and the Pechenegs were often simply called “Turks.”47 In order to check the authenticity of the information left by the Byzantine, Russian, Hungarian, and other authors they must be analysed in conjunction with other historical sources; in this case, primarily with archaeological ones. In the absence or the modest presence of narrative sources, the archaeological data obtain a special importance for elucidating the early medieval history of the Carpathian-​Danubian regions. 42 Annales Fuldenses sive Annales regni Francorum orientalis, ed.

These provide data on material and spiritual achievements of the human communities in different historical eras. Thus, archaeological sources dispose of considerable weight for studying the history of the territories to the north of the Lower Danube in the last quarter of the first millennium. The archaeological investigations from the last seven to eight decades have gathered rich and diverse archaeological material, the analysis and interpretation of which allow us to reconstruct the historical realities of the studied period and its geographical framework. The category of early medieval archaeological sources includes findings from the settlements, cemeteries, graves, uncertain funerary discoveries, deposits, hoards, and isolated coins, and is the result of either methodical investigation or accidental discoveries. All these findings, taken together, make a real contribution to research into the economic, social, and cultural realities to the north of the Lower Danube during the eighth–​ninth centuries. The first archaeological materials from the eighth–​ninth centuries identified on the territory of Romania, Hungary, and Serbia come from occasional discoveries in the second half of the nineteenth century. During the twentieth century, a series of systematic excavations were carried out under the auspices of specialized institutions from Romania, Hungary, Serbia (Yugoslavia), Moldova, and Ukraine (USSR) which revealed rich and varied archaeological material from the eighth–​ninth centuries. The political changes at the end of the twentieth century decreased the intensity of archaeological investigations in the countries of the former socialist camp. In recent years there has been a return of interest in Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Hungary, and Serbia through continuing excavations or the opening of new archaeological sites aimed at researching early medieval realities north of the Lower Danube. These archaeological materials include data from surface research, rescue excavations, and systematic investigation, and from the results of accidental discoveries without a precise location which were subsequently verified and analysed archaeologically. Over 2,500 archaeological (Table 1, Chart 1, Map 2) and over 130 numismatic discoveries (Table 6, Chart 4, Map 7) have been recorded and mapped in this book to the present in the specialized publications regarding the Carpathian-​Danubian regions. Archaeological sources include various data that reflect the material and spiritual activity of a people from various historical eras. For the period studied here, characteristic are open and hillforts, built housing and buildings for economic purposes, cemeteries and graves, and a wide variety of objects and tools intended for economic activities or pieces of jewellery and coins. Settlements\n\nThe results of investigations of settlements give us important data on the organization of human habitats to the north of the Lower Danube in the eighth–​ninth centuries. Thus, based on archaeological data we can reconstruct the economic and social organization of these communities. In this book, we catalogued and mapped 2,101 settlements known\n\n15\n\nSources\n\n15\n\nin the literature on the basis of field surveys and archaeological excavations (Table 1, Map 3). Hillforts\n\nHillforts, the research of which allows for the reconstitution of the military, social, and political history of the region, forms a special category. In this book over ninety hillforts (Table 1, Map 4, 4a) have been catalogued and mapped. Burial Findings\n\nThe category of burial findings includes singular graves and cemeteries: 388 burial findings date back to the eighth–​ninth centuries, among which there are 221 cemeteries, 79 graves, and 89 uncertain funerary findings (Table 2, Chart 2, Map 5). Numismatic Findings\n\nNumismatic sources are of special interest for historical studies. The coins represent a special category of research sources that help us reconstruct not only the realities of the economic, political, and social order but also to solve the problem of chronology regarding archaeological findings.48 This category of sources includes coins that circulated in the eighth–​ninth centuries in the Carpathian-​Danubian space. The numismatic material certified in cultural layers of the eighth–​ninth centuries is represented, in most cases, by singular discoveries of Byzantine and Arab coins. Out of the total number of coins, the Byzantine pieces predominate in comparison with the Arab ones. Thus, over 130 coins from the eighth–​ninth centuries are known from the region to the north of the Lower Danube, most of which come from singular discoveries, with only a third from the hoards of Cleja, Răducăneni, and Alcedar.49 After issuance, the coins fell into three groups: Arabian, Byzantine, and Western European (Tables 6–​10, Charts 4–​6, Maps 6–​9). The attempts to synthesize archaeological findings from the areas north of the Lower Danube in the socialist period were incomplete, often influenced by political pressures. In most cases, archaeologists have sought to compare the results of discoveries from the east, from south of the Carpathians, or from Transylvania with those regions nearby without trying to integrate them into a wider geographical area.

Thus, based on archaeological and numismatic sources, we will analyse a number of aspects of the history of the Carpathian-​Danubian space in the eighth–​ninth centuries in succession.\n\n50 A.

Registering, mapping, and analysing these archaeological data allow us to distinguish some archaeological features of human habitation from this period in the regions that are the subject of this research. Geo-​climatic conditions have played an important role in influencing the lifestyle of human society and thus in the study of the peculiarities of habitations from particular eras. The Carpathian-​Danube basin has undergone many environmental changes over the past two millennia; geo-​climatic conditions directly influenced the lifestyle of human societies.1 The natural features of the landscape are also important in studying changes in the environment in relation to the human habitat. An increase or decrease in the number of archaeological sites in a region speaks of the attractiveness or insignificance of that area in the period studied. During the Holocene, the development of a temperate climate favoured the development of complex vegetation. Beech forests came from areas west and northwest; oak forests came from the south, and steppe vegetation came from the east. During the time of the Roman Empire (150 BC to AD 300) a cooling period began that lasted until about AD 900, the so-​called Roman Climatic Optimum (although the average global temperature remained relatively warm until about AD 600). The archaeological record of the Carpathian-​Danube region from the end of the seventh until the late ninth century reveals significant historical developments in Central and Southeast Europe. The lower chronological limit marks the migration of the Bulgars south of the Danube (680/​681) and the upper limit coincides with the movement of the Hungarians from the East-​European steppes to Pannonia (895/​896). After a cold period with higher-​than-​average precipitation at the end of seventh century, a dry period started that peaked at the end of eighth century and affected large areas of Asia2 and Western Europe. From the temperate zone of the Volga and the Carpathians (from the mouth of the Danube to the mouth of the Volga), the steppe vegetation was largely the same.3 A great increase in the density of settlements in the Carpathian-​ Danube region occurred from the eighth to the tenth century (a similar development has been noted for the period of the third to the fourth century). 1 Drăgan and Şt. Airinei, Geoclimate.\n\n2 In Asia, drought had catastrophic effects, a range of water sources dried up (rivers, lakes, and springs), many hillforts were abandoned, and some towns were covered by sand.\n\n3 M.

In the ninth century, the climate became more humid in the Carpathian Basin, which led to the rejuvenation of vegetation and made the situation attractive to nomadic steppe people. High humidity is not the most favourable condition for livestock; wet grass favours the development of diseases which are detrimental to animals.5 This seems to have led nomadic people in the late ninth century, including the Hungarians, to seek areas with a warmer climate and a lower relative humidity.6 In general, the period between 900 and 1150 was predominantly warm and dry, with some variation depending on the season and landform (mountains, hills, or plains).7 The Middle Ages in Europe fell within the period of the so-​called Medieval Climatic Anomaly, which lasted from approximately AD 950 to AD 1400, when the climate in this part of the European continent enjoyed mild winters and hot summers.8 Human beings became an important factor in the reshaping of the landscape through their efforts to provide themselves with food, clothing, and so on. Anthropogenic influence on the geographical environment became more noticeable during the second millennium. Deforestation and the expansion of agriculture caused a reduction in forested areas and an expansion of grasslands. Deforestation and the draining of large territories had direct consequences on the landscape, the flora, and the fauna of region. Excessive hunting led to the extinction of some animal species, such as the aurochs, which disappeared in the fifteenth century, bison and tarpan, extinct since the eighteenth century, the castor, or European beaver, becoming extinct in the first half of the nineteenth century, and so on.9 On the territories to the west of the Carpathians deforestation began during the Avar period and continued in the Carolingian period.10 Major deforestation occurred in the Carpathian-​Danubian-​Pontic space only near to the Modern Age (the 4 I.

Many rivers in the plains regions changed their courses (the Buzau river flowed in the current Călmăţui Valley, the Mostiştea represented the lower flow of the Ialomița, the Krasna passed along the Ier Valley into the Barcău Basin to the north, to the Someș, and then directly to the Tisza, and so on). The Danube delta also underwent a number of changes as a result of the sludge-​setting process in suspension, as fresh water flowed into the salt water of the sea and formed underwater bar formations, and so on.12 The Carpathians, the Danube, the Black Sea, the commercial crossroads between the East and the West, the North and the South, and its natural resources constituted geopolitical and strategic elements attracting armies and settlers to the Carpathian-​Danubian-​ Pontic region since ancient times.13 The Tisza Plain was one of the last major lowland regions in the path of nomadic populations coming from the East, since the lowland areas in northern Europe had been characterized by a harsher climate and the Padova Plain was of smaller dimensions. Thus, the Tisza Plain became “a space to absorb migratory nomads and halting of their movement to the other lands in the west of the continent.”14 The regions to the east and the south of the Carpathians were not an exception to this phenomenon through late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. In search of explanations of the causes of the displacements of populations from one region to another, we should not confine ourselves to only political and military factors, but also to review the geo-​ climatic conditions that played such an important role throughout history in migration phenomena. There is thus a need for more efficient corroboration of written archaeological sources and of new opportunities for analysing changes in climate in order to respond to the multitude of questions about the particularities of human habitation in the early Middle Ages in Europe and Asia. The southeastern part of the researched region is bathed by the Black Sea, which covers an area of 413,488 square km, with an average depth of 1,282 m and the maximum depth of 2,245 m. The coast represents a strip interfacing between the sea and the continent, composed of firm land and a submerged area. Sea breezes are felt inland over a distance of up to 25 km, which creates a coastline climate in this area.15 After the second half of the first millennium AD, the Black Sea entered the phase of transgression, manifesting in the past centuries at intensity of approximately 20 cm per century. The consequences of this rise in sea level led to the transformation of the mouths of the rivers from the region into estuaries, to the flooding of maritime levels, and to the growth of alluvial plains inside the Delta.16 Lagoons and estuaries are also specific forms of the seashore. The Danube delta is shaped like a triangle with its top in Pătlăgeanca, being either a delta evolved from the Danube Depression or developed on a former 11 Bacumenco, “Structuri geospaţiale,” 193; Botzan, Mediu şi vieţuire, 12. 12 Petrescu-​Dîmboviţă and Vulpe, Istoria Românilor, 17.\n\n13 G.

There are also azonal soils (halomorphic, hydromorphic, sandy, and alluvial).19 Thus approximately one quarter of the entire area to the north of the Lower Danube is covered by mollisols, primarily by chernozems, widely used in farming (arable); one quarter pertains to clay-​alluvial soils (reddish-​brown and brown soils) used not only in crop production, in horticulture, and in viticulture, but also for forests and meadows; slightly over 20 per cent belong to the areas with mountain soils (podzols, brown acid) occupied by forests and alpine pastures, and approximately one-​ quarter is made up of other soil types with varied usage.20\n\nArchaeological Sites\n\nMapping the sites from the eighth–​ninth centuries to the north of the Lower Danube reveals both the demographic situation and the degree of archaeological research in the region. Compared with the previous period (the sixth–​seventh centuries), we notice a demographic jump characteristic of the era throughout the whole of the Carpathian-​ Danubian-​Pontic territory. In the Prut-​Dniester space, the number of settlements practically doubled in the eighth–​ninth centuries when compared to the sixth–​seventh centuries. Some archaeologists believe that the maximum duration of a settlement may be spread over two or three generations.21 A social and historical explanation of this phenomenon can be found in the analysis of the successive resettlement process of these settlements from one to another area, imposed either by climatic factors or by swarming, to which are also added the settlements which appeared due to populations coming from other regions. The confirmation of an impressive number of settlements to the north of the Lower Danube dating from the eighth–​ninth centuries does not require their concomitant existence during those two centuries.22 17 Posea, Geografia fizică, 174.\n\n18 Bacumenco, “Structuri geospaţiale,” 185.\n\n19 G.

Natural disasters (floods /​ water level changes) and invasions were crucial factors in settlement relocation. In this context, we must take into account both short-​term housing cases, demonstrated by thin cultural layers from some settlements and cases of prolonged habitation or inhabitation with interruptions. Organized movements took place, in all likelihood, within some sub-​units or a micro-​region, clearly delimited geographically.28 In the context of these migrations and the displacement of populations, agrarian societies in most cases took account of both the area’s topographical conditions and of soil quality. Regarding the territorial concentration of archaeological sites from the eighth–​ninth centuries, it appears that in some regions the density is higher than in others (Maps 1, 2). The reasons for this can be both the geopolitical and economic conditions of the investigated period, and the fact that some areas were simply more thoroughly investigated than others. The problem of poorly researched geographical areas was mentioned by Dan. Gh. Teodor,29 V. Spinei,30 and, more recently, by G. T. Rustoiu.31 We must also take into account the geographical conditions of the areas where the settlements are missing or where their number is reduced (swampy, mountain, steppe regions, etc.).

Dry climate and droughts in the eighth century led to lower water levels in rivers, lakes, and swamps, which directly influenced the location and development of settlements in certain areas. So we can see through the ages the concentration of settlements in areas with average humidity, with plateaus, or foothills, compared to plains where they are less numerous. Thus, besides other drivers of the political and economic order, the lack of settlements in the steppe areas north of the Lower Danube in the fifth–​seventh centuries can be explained by the climate. Two good examples are the southern part of the Bugeac Steppe and the hilly Steppe Horincea-​Elan-​Prut,32 where, during the fifth–​seventh centuries, settlements were absent and, in the ninth–​tenth centuries, a “population explosion” took place (Maps 1–3). This phenomenon may be related both to the climatic changes of the ninth century, with richer precipitation which facilitated the emergence of a whole chain of settlements in the zone of the Danubian lakes, and to the political situation, such as confrontations between the Avar Kaganate, the Carolingian State, Byzantium, and the Bulgarian Khanate, which caused population movements, some of them settling in the regions from the north of the Danube (Maps 1, 5). The same situation is seen in the Banat-​Crișan Plain. In Banat most settlements are located on the terraces of rivers at relatively low altitudes; in particular, there are some groups near the Danube between Orșova and New Moldova, along the Bega river in the zone of Timișoara, on the Timis’ waters, and in the area of Ocna de Fier (Maps 1, 2).33 In the northwest areas of the Carpathian-​Danubian-​Pontic space, the groups of settlements are between the Crișul Repede, the Someș in the north and the Meses gates in the east, between the Mureș and the Crișul Repede, and in the Beiuş Depression.34 In the intra-​Carpathic space there is a concentration of settlements seen in the basins of the rivers Someș and Mureș and on the Transylvania Plain, between the Crișul Alb and the Mures, near the city of Alba Iulia, near the headwaters of the Târnavelor, on the upper and middle courses of the Olt river, near Barsa, on the left bank of the Olt, in the Breţcu valley, and in Brașov area (Maps 1, 2).35 In eastern Wallachia, toward the north and the south are found certified concentrations of sites and a relatively high density of settlements near the cities of 32 G.

The assertion of some Soviet archaeologists from the 1970s regarding a total lack of settlements from the eighth–​tenth centuries in Wallachia and Oltenia does not correspond to contemporary archaeological realities.38 On the territories to the east of the Carpathians we should highlight the concen­ trations of settlements of a few groups: the northern part of the Bukovina, the basins of the rivers Siret and Prut, on the lower course of the Jijia, the Bahlui, and the Prut; the central region of the Central Moldavian Plateau, between the Prut and the Bârlad, in the region of Vrancea, with extensions to the course of the Oituz into the Trotuş and in the Oituz valley; and the southern region, groups of settlements between the lower courses of the rivers Bistrița, Moldova, and Siret, and between the lower courses of the Siret and the Prut (Maps 1, 2).39 In the Prut-​ Dniester space, fourteen groups of settlements have been distinguished: the Hotin Forest; the plateau of the northern Moldovan-​Briceni region; the plateau of the northern Moldovan Donduşeni-​Ocniţa region; the hilly plain of the Middle Prut-​Rоşcani-​Prut region; the Plateau of Soroca; the residual height of Ciuluc; the hilly region between the Răut and the Dniester; the Orhei Forest; the Central Plateau-​the Calarași Forest; the Lăpuşna Land; the Tigheci Forest; the Bugeac Plain; the Danubian Lakes region; and the plains of the Lower Dniester (Maps 1, 2).40 From the geographic point of view, the settlements from the eighth–​ninth centuries have been virtually certified on the surface of most landforms present to the north of the Danube (plains, hills, and foothills), though the mountainous regions and some sectors of the plains are exceptions (the hilly Plain of Bălţi, in Bugeac, and in northern Oltenia and Wallachia) (Maps 1, 2). The lack of settlements in the mountainous areas and their limited number in the sub-​mountain areas with rugged terrain, often forested, have restricted archaeological investigations, a fact recognized by some Romanian archaeologists.41 However, we generally find that human settlements documented to date in the regions to the north of the Lower Danube are concentrated in clearly delineated areas of the available habitat (Maps 1, 2). 36 A.
