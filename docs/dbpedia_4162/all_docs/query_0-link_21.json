        "text": "Although the island of Cyprus seems to have remained largely isolated throughout the earlier phases of the Bronze Age, during the later 2nd millennium BCE it became a significant trade spot in the maritime networks of the East Mediterranean. Because of the considerable intensification of copper production and export during the Late Cypriote period, the island greatly increased its external contacts and transformed into the important trade partner of Egypt, Levant, Anatolia and the Aegean. As active participants in international trade, especially in the export of copper, the merchants from Cyprus most probably adapted existing metrological systems from other areas. Balance weights have come to light at numerous Late Bronze Age sites on Cyprus in various contexts: in settlements (e.g. Hala Sultan Tekke; Apliki-Karamallos), in graves (e.g. Hala Sultan Tekke; Ayia Irini-Paleokastro; Paleokastro by Ayia Irini) and in hoards (e.g. Kalavassos-Ayios Dhimitrios; Enkomi; Pyla-Kokkinokremos). The primary aim of this paper is to review the weighing equipment (balance weights and scales), as well as metrological systems used on Cyprus in the Late Bronze Age. It seems that only Egyptian and Near Eastern metrological systems were adapted, while the Aegean system was not applied. This is especially striking since wide trade and social contacts with the Aegean had existed for many centuries and became particularly intensive in the Late Bronze Age. In addition, the relationship between metal production and weighing utensils, including both canonical and uncanonical weights (potential stone weights), will be investigated.\n\nA small-brained species of hominin, Homo naledi was discovered in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site. It was recently determined to date to the Middle Pleistocene, in contrast with previous suggestions for a much older age. Its date demonstrates that H. naledi co-existed with larger-brained hominins in South Africa’s central interior. Moreover, it is contemporary with the beginning of the Middle Stone Age in the region (characterized by prepared core or mode 3 assemblages). In light of this, its discoverers have explicitly cast it as a potential producer of Middle Stone Age technologies (Berger et al. 2017). We develop a hypothesis on the ecological and technological niche Homo naledi likely occupied. We briefly review relevant elements H. naledi’s anatomy and their implications for its ecology. We provide an overview of the characteristics of the South African archaeological record contemporary with H. naledi. We reason from the principle of competitive exclusion and suggest a technological repertoire consisting of simple cores and flakes functioning in a niche focusing on extracted foods is most likely for Homo naledi. We contend that prepared core assemblages were associated with larger-brained populations, fossil remains of which are also known from South Africa’s central interior. Berger, L.R., Hawks, J., Dirks, P.H.G.M., Elliott, M., Roberts, E.M. (2017). Homo naledi and Pleistocene hominin evolution in subequatorial Africa. eLife, 6, e24234.\n\nThe different criteria used to analyze and to categorize the results through the different research traditions make difficult to compare data. Although many technological approaches have been developed, there are still differences in method between the different countries in the study of the Middle Pleistocene industries in the Western side of Europe. The British research has been based on the typological system of Wymer or the morphometric system of Roe for the analysis and classification of handaxes, as well as on the simple description of shaping sequences developed by Newcomer and Wenban-Smith. In turn, the French traditions are mainly based on the typological view proposed by Bordes, on the complex approach of the chaine operatoire, and on the techno-functional approach proposed by Boëda. Meanwhile, the Spanish tradition has been highly influenced by the French school, with significant methodological developments coming from the Logical Analytic System. This work proposes a common method of analysis of the Acheulean technology to go beyond the local perspective and gain a regional point of view in the Western side of Europe. This requires a deep understanding of the underlying technology to identify the differences or similarities in processes and traditions of manufacture. The new methodology, applied in several sites of UK and France, is based on the selection of those technological attributes which give more information about the LCT and how they have been produced. Each tool will be analyzed as a unit and also divided in its three main morpho-potential sections: distal, medium and proximal parts. And, taking advantage of new technologies and combining the basic technological analysis with 3D models, we willto standardize the process of measurement and documentation of the pieces. This methodological approach is the base of a Post-doctoral Marie Skłodowska Curie project, entitle The Western European Acheulean Project, (ID. 748316).\n\nThe implication of cloth and/or clothing in ritual actions is amply testified in Aegean Late Bronze Age iconography. Nevertheless, their identification involves problems related to both our main iconographical sources, i.e. wall paintings and various sphragistic media (signet rings, seals and seal impressions/sealings). Pictorial wall paintings, which appear in Crete from late MM III and spread afterwards to Cyclades, Rhodes, Miletus and Mainland Greece, are in their vast majority poorly preserved, with the exception of Akrotiri (Thera) frescoes. So, we deal with partial (often) or dubious (occasionally) restorations, let alone the stylistic conventions. Drawing upon a common iconographical tradition, the much richer seal imagery, from the 16th century B.C. onwards, often fills the gaps of the fragmentary wall paintings. Usually however, features related to the limited sphragistic surface (miniature scale, lack of details, schematization), as well as the occasional poor preservation of the scenes, make their interpretation difficult. Data offered by miscellaneous media (figurines, vases, sarcophagi, faience models etc.) remain valuable though disparate. Despite the problems of ambiguity arisen, I aim at discussing the types of cloth and clothing detected in Aegean Late Bronze Age religious iconography and their role in specific rituals, with reference to their possible correlation with terms testified on Linear B tablets.\n\nCyprus became a significant trade spot in the maritime networks of the East Mediterranean during the later 2nd millennium BCE. Because of the considerable intensification of copper production and export during the Late Cypriote period, external contacts of the island has greatly increased and it transformed into the important trade partner of Egypt, Levant, Anatolia and the Aegean.

The primary aim of this paper is to review the weighing equipment (balance weights and scales), as well as metrological systems used on Cyprus in the Late the Bronze Age. It seems that only Egyptian and Near Eastern metrological systems were adapted, while the Aegean system was not applied. It is striking because of wide trade and social contacts with the Aegean which existed already for many centuries and became particularly intensive in the Late Bronze Age. In addition, a relationship between metal production and weighing utensils, both canonical and uncanonical weights (potential stone weights) will be investigated.\n\nOsseous artefacts were very important in everyday lives of prehistoric communities, especially before the invention of metallurgy. However, they were long neglected area of study, particularly in some regions of Europe. For the Early Holocene period, the region of the Iron Gates is particularly interesting, because the presence of both Mesolithic and Early Neolithic sites enables analyses of traditions and innovations in raw material selection, technological choices, etc. Relatively rich finds were published in more detail for the sites in Romania. This paper will focus on the Mesolithic and Neolithic sites from Serbia (Kula, Velesnica, Knjepište, etc.). Technological and typological data will be discussed: raw material selection, manufacturing techniques, etc. Antlers were the dominant raw material in the Mesolithic period and their importance continues into the Neolithic period, although in most of the Starčevo sites bones prevailed. Typological repertoire included heavy duty and small craft tools, rarely other types of artefacts. Certain techno-types introduced in the Neolithic sites are of Near-Eastern origin, in particular spatula-spoons from cattle metapodia. Manufacture debris is not abundant and the question is whether this is related to taphonomy, excavation and recovery techniques, or specific activities carried out at some of the sites. Overall importance of analyses of the osseous industries and comparative approach of different technologies will be discussed.\n\nThe early byzantine settlement of Caričin Grad in southern Serbia, which is supposed to be the imperial city Iustiniana Prima, existed for merely 90 years. Without any marks of earlier or later occupation, the excavations provide undisturbed insight into everyday life in an early medieval settlement of the 6th century. Excavations in Caričin Grad take place since 100 years. Considering the concept and methodology of Household Archaeology, one single room house was excavated in 2014 and 2015 in high resolution with integration of archaeobiology and soil science. The finds indicate a habitational function. The interpretation of the building bases on the results of the interdisciplinary research. The simple configuration of the house and the multiplicity of potential types of use in a single room structure challenge the examination. This is the crucial point where field work and the theories of Household Archaeology come together. Working with an elementary constructed house and a few objects connected with specific activities restrict the possibilities which houses with many rooms and outdoor-areas may provide. It is necessary to examine the activities in- and outside the building to understand the function the household fulfils in the settlement system regarding social, religious and economic aspects. The building accommodated one or more persons who belonged to an average or low social stratum. Taking their perspective on the settlement raises the question of their everyday life. The analysis of installations and formation processes helps to understand activities carried out in daily routine and how the domestic space may be used. The distribution of finds is imbalanced between the inside of the house and its exterior what depicts the pattern of disposal organisation. This and other domestic activities display in little the organisation of the whole settlement. Working on households provides information of how the dwellers contributed to the development of the society. The talk will examine if it is generally possible to work with the household concept if there are unspecific structures or if it is rather necessary to apply it to gain more information. For this purpose it will place the archaeological remains of a specific small house into the context of the organisation of a settlement.\n\nThe manufacture of textiles and garments had a long tradition in the Aegean already prior to the beginnings of the Early Bronze Age. Numerous textile tools, especially spindle whorls and loom weights, are preserved from the Neolithic sites which demonstrate that spinning with spindle whorls and weaving on the warp-weighted loom were commonly practiced. Plant fibres, particularly linen, seem to have been the main material for the production of cloth and textiles during this period. At some point, most probably during the Early Bronze Age, animal fibres (sheep wool) began to be used in the Aegean on a wider scale. Since hardly any Neolithic and Early Bronze textiles are preserved from the Aegean, we can study textile tools made of stone, bone and clay in order to comprehend technological traditions and innovations in textile production. Diachronic changes in the use of spindle whorls and loom weights (their weights, dimensions and shapes) may shed some light on alternations in not only fibre use, but also in various spinning and weaving techniques. In this paper I would like to focus on chosen aspects of textile implements from Early Bronze Age Peloponnese.\n\nThe management of archaeological and historic environment assets increasingly articulates with other tools which seek to deliver more sustainable rural landscape management. A range of landscape scale planning and management tools are currently being applied in Europe including Biosphere Reserves, Ecomuseums, Landscape Observatories, Landscape Partnership Schemes, Landscape Plans, Landscape Programmes and World Heritage Sites. We wish to critically explore how archaeology, historic environment and cultural heritage currently sit within such tools: • How are archaeological, historic environment and cultural heritage assets weighted and prioritised (e.g. in contrast to ecological or social values)? • What opportunities does archaeology and historic environment offer for sustainable economic development in rural landscapes? • How can archaeological (and historical ecological) research help to historically characterize environmental resources management practices, based on local actors and local knowledge, to offer new tools for management of rural areas? • What are the benefits and challenges of living traditions and heritage produce in sustaining resilient cultural landscapes? • What opportunities do archaeological assets provide for building broader sustainability and legacy? • Are there examples of past land tenure and stewardship from which lessons (both negative and positive) can be learnt in future management of landscapes? • How successfully have communities been engaged and involved in the development and delivery of such tools? • How successful have such landscape planning and management tools been at creating legacies and sustainable approaches to more integrated landscape management? We welcome papers which address some of the questions above, either through case studies on experiences, broader critical reflection on landscapes management policy and tools, or by exploring opportunities for future innovation."
