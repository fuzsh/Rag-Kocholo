        "text": "In 2005 four outstanding multiple burials were discovered near Eulau, Germany. The 4,600-year-old graves contained groups of adults and children buried facing each other. Skeletal and artifactual evidence and the simultaneous interment of the individuals suggest the supposed families fell victim to a violent event. In a multidisciplinary approach, archaeological, anthropological, geochemical (radiogenic isotopes), and molecular genetic (ancient DNA) methods were applied to these unique burials. Using autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-chromosomal markers, we identified genetic kinship among the individuals. A direct child-parent relationship was detected in one burial, providing the oldest molecular genetic evidence of a nuclear family. Strontium isotope analyses point to different origins for males and children versus females. By this approach, we gain insight into a Late Stone Age society, which appears to have been exogamous and patrilocal, and in which genetic kinship seems to be a focal point of social organization.\n\nObjectives: Straight next to a segment of the outer ditch of the Late Neolithic Michelsberg Culture earthwork of Bruchsal-Aue in SW-Germany (ca. 4250–3650 calBC), a multiple burial of eight individuals (two male adults and six children) plus a subsequent child burial was excavated. In this study, we applied a multidisciplinary approach to elucidate interpersonal relationships and life histories within this collective. Materials and methods: To determine the identity of this collective, we performed aDNA analyses in addition to osteological examination using HVR I plus Y-chromosomal and autosomal STR profiling to find evidence for kinship relations. Strontium isotopic analyses were used to reconsider migrational behavior. To find evidence for a specific social affiliation, the individual diet was reconstructed by performing nitrogen and carbon isotopic analyses. Furthermore, radiocarbon-dating was carried out to integrate the burial context into an absolute timeframe. Two nearby single burials were included in the analyses for comparison. Results: Because of a shared HVR I haplotype, three pairs of individuals were most likely linked by kinship, and statistical testing on autosomal STR profiles shows a high probability for the pair of two men being brothers. Although it cannot be excluded, isotopic data gave no clear proof for migration. A rather poor health status is indicated by skeletal stress markers even though the isotope data attest to a diet rich in meat and fish. Discussion: Although clear kinship relations among the infants remain unconfirmed, a relationship could also be indicated by the positioning of the bodies in the burial pit. Whereas a common cause of death might have been the presupposition for their special treatment, interpersonal relationships were likely the decisive factor for the multiple burial.\n\nKinship and social structure have long been a major focus of anthropological research, mainly in the subfield of cultural anthropology. But recent small-scale societies are not the only ones organised along kinship relations, their counterparts in the past apparently followed the same patterns. When dealing with archaeological cultures two different approaches can be identified: the interpretation of material culture in terms of social kinship and the reconstruction of biological kinship by analysing the human skeletal remains from funerary contexts. Various methods have been used for the latter on a population and individual level. This article will discuss the recent application of current methods for two Neolithic sites; a collective grave of the Bernburg culture from Benzingerode and four Corded Ware culture multiple burials from Eulau, both located in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. From these examples it becomes evident that in these ancient societies social kinship, expressed in the funeral ritual by the spatial arrangement of the individuals within the grave, was also based on genetic kinship. Combined approaches, which consider social and biological relations and utilize insights from cultural anthropology, can reach the most detailed level of kinship reconstruction currently possible.\n\nIn funerary studies, \" multiple burials \" that have received several individuals in the same grave at the same time naturally raise questions concerning both the relationship linking the deceased and the cause of their simultaneous death. During the Merovingian period in Northeast France, multiple burials were revealed as highly rare and were consequently considered special burials linked to exceptional dramatic events. To help document the status of the deceased recovered from such special burials, we conducted ancient DNA analyses (mitochondrial and nuclear markers) to investigate the possible maternal kinship between a woman and three immature individuals simultaneously deposited in burial 41 at the Hérange site (Lorraine, France). The genetic data obtained (i) strongly supported a maternal (genetic) kinship between the woman centrally deposited in the burial and the two immatures deposited right beside her but (ii) permitted the exclusion of a genetic link between the woman and the teenager deposited along her legs. Thus, these data support the view that survivors had intimate knowledge of the deceased relationship and buried these individuals in a manner to illustrate their biological connections. As a consequence, if a common cause of death was the presupposition for the special treatment of the deceased recovered from Hérange burial 41, then interpersonal relationship was likely the deciding factor for setting this multiple burial.\n\nThe burial of multiple individuals within a single funerary monument invites speculation about the relationships between the deceased: were they chosen on the basis of status, gender or relatedness, for example? Here, the authors present the results of aDNA and isotope analyses conducted on seven individuals from an Early Iron Age barrow at Dolge njive, south-eastern Slovenia. All seven individuals are close biological relatives. While the group composition suggests strict adherence to neither patrilineal nor matrilineal structures, the funerary tradition appears highly gendered, and family links through both the male and female lines seem important in structuring of the community. The results have implications for understanding of kinship and funerary practices in late prehistoric Europe.\n\nWe present a high-resolution cross-disciplinary analysis of kinship structure and social institutions in two Late Copper Age Bell Beaker culture cemeteries of South Germany containing 24 and 18 burials, of which 34 provided genetic information. By combining archaeological, anthropological, genetic and isotopic evidence we are able to document the internal kinship and residency structure of the cemeteries and the socially organizing principles of these local communities. The buried individuals represent four to six generations of two family groups, one nuclear family at the Alburg cemetery, and one seemingly more extended at Irl-bach. While likely monogamous, they practiced exogamy, as six out of eight non-locals are women. Maternal genetic diversity is high with 23 different mitochondrial haplotypes from 34 individuals, whereas all males belong to one single Y-chromosome haplogroup without any detectable contribution from Y-chromosomes typical of the farmers who had been the sole inhabitants of the region hundreds of years before. This provides evidence for the society being patrilocal, perhaps as a way of protecting property among the male line, while in-marriage from many different places secured social and political networks and prevented inbreeding. We also find evidence that the communities practiced selection for which of their PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone."
