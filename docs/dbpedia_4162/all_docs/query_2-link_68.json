        "text": "In the first part of the article, I discuss finds of western origin glass vessels from the Three Kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula. Such glassware has been discovered among the grave goods of the elites of the Kingdom of Silla, and, to the lesser extent, in those of the Gaya Confederation. Several fragments of glassware have also been discovered within the Buddhist temple complex in the territory of Baekje. Glass products have seldom been in the focus of archaeologists researching the issue of relations between the West and the East along the Silk Road. A considerably big number of such finds of glassware related with the Roman glassmaking is a proof that some routes of the Silk Road extended farther than previously thought- to Korea and even to Japan. It is still an open question, though, if this participation had an active or passive character. A systematic stylistic analysis of glassware, has established that strong links to the Syrian-Palestinian glassmaking existed, and that analogical vessels have also been discovered along the northern coasts of the Black Sea, as well as in Rhineland. Their chemical analyses, surprisingly, have shown that the chemical composition of a part of the vessels (coming from the mound no. 98 Hwangnamdaechong - Southern grave) resembles the Sasanian and Central Asian compositions. This fact is even more astonishing as shapes of the vessels mentioned are not related to Sasanian forms but to those from the Late Roman workshops. In several other cases, chemical analyses as well as the formal resemblance, both suggest Roman provenance. The rest of specimens, with a high probability, are Roman imitations produced in Central Asia. Three chronological horizons with glass vessels can be distinguished within the Period of the Three Kingdoms of Korea: 1 - the period starting from the second quarter of the fourth century AD; 2 - the horizon covering the fifth and the first half of the sixth century; 3 - the horizon representing the period after the half of the sixth century. Most numerously, glassware was represented in the second of the horizons, prevailingly in the rich burials attributed to the rulers of Silla in Gyeongju. Imports of glass vessels to the territories of the Three Kingdoms, Silla and Gaya above all, should be connected with the nomadic ruling dynasties of Northern China, i.e. with the Xianbei tribes, whose burials also contain glassware.\n\nA total of 146 glass samples from Daoye, Daoye South, and Wujiancuo in southwestern Taiwan were subjected to elemental analysis using LA-ICP-MS and SEM-EDS. These samples cover a time span from the first to the eighth century CE. The results provide evidence of the existence of multiple long-distance glass exchange networks that directly or indirectly connected Taiwan to Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia, and possibly the Mediterranean region. The predominance of the South Asian m-Na-Al glass sub-type 1 suggests that Taiwan mainly participated in the South China Sea maritime glass exchange network, while the identification of a newly recognised sub-type, m-Na-Al low Al low Ca, indicates the possibility of small-scale glass production workshops or a less controlled recipe for m-Na-Al glass production. Furthermore, this research reveals compelling evidence linking early v-Na-Ca glass found in Taiwan to origins in Mesopotamia or Sasanian territories, with the secondary production areas remain unclear. In addition, a potash glass and a Roman HIMT glass were also discovered. The chemical profiles of the potash glass do not align with those of early potash glass, while the HIMT glass can be attributed to the Roman Mediterranean. Taken together, these findings shed light on the intricate maritime exchange networks that operated over vast distances, spanning from the eastern part of the South China Sea to West Asia, covering over eight thousand kilometers. This study thus addresses a significant research gap regarding the maritime exchange of glass during the understudied period of the early to mid-1st millennium CE around the South China Sea and beyond.\n\nThe starting point of this paper is a group of glass vessels excavated during the last 50 years in tombs of the Han period (206 BCE–220 CE) in Guangxi province in southern China. They were found mainly in the area of Hepu near the coast and in the area of Guixian (recently renamed Guigang) farther inland (Figs. 12.1 and 12.10). When the first five of these glass vessels were excavated from Eastern Han tombs in the Guixian area in the 1950s, they came as a great surprise. At that time, glass vessels found in China in contexts of the early periods were held to be imports. An x-ray fluorescence analysis of one of the cups published in 1983 seemed to confirm this (Fan and Zhou 1983: 100–1, Fig. 5, analysis sample no. 7; Fan and Zhou 1991: 196–7, 200, sample 7. An 1984: 456, sample 2; An 1987: 45, sample 2). It gave some qualitative values\n\nThe paper presents two different groups of vessel glass fragments found in fourteenth century Singapore. They differ in almost every aspect of size, shape, technique, and chemical composition of their glass. The first group consists of small, apparently core-formed vessels with polychrome decoration. The second group represents a selection of blown glass vessels characterised by their peculiar rim shape. The paper explores the stylistic, typological, and technical relation of the glass vessels in their historical context. According to the chemical analyses the glass of the first group originates from China, whereas that of the second group from South Asia. The find distribution of related glassware in Southeast Asia reflects the flow of such luxury commodities along the maritime trade routes, emphasising the geographical situation of Singapore “between two oceans”, the South China Sea and – via the Strait of Malacca – the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe use of a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer revealed the provenance of a shard of a relief-cut glass bowl which was dedicated to ancient ritual on the sacred island of Okinoshima, Japan over a thousand years ago. The shard was unearthed from one of the ritual sites on the island in the 1950s and is now designated as a national treasure in Japan. A nondestructive and on-site X-ray fluorescence analytical technique was applied to the Okinoshima glass shard to establish where and when it was originally manufactured based on its chemical composition. Clear correspondence of chemical composition between the shard and glass excavated from a Sasanian city site in Mesopotamia demonstrated that the shard was derived from a type of glassware primarily produced in glass workshops within the Sasanian Empire between the fifth and seventh centuries AD. This is the first scientific evidence demonstrating that glass was imported from overseas across thousands of kilometers and then dedicated for the ritual on Okinoshima Island. This simultaneously gives us a glimpse of the specific details of divine rituals conducted on Okinoshima Island in ancient times.\n\nAnalyses of a sample of 68 carnelian and agate beads from Korea’s late Proto-Three Kingdoms and Three Kingdoms period (C.E. 100–668) provide evidence for long distance exchange with South Asia. Three Kingdoms period elites were rejecting locally made stone beads made of local materials for stone beads obtained from long distance trade and made of non-local materials. Some of these beads may also be derived from South, Central, or Southeast Asia as well as from regions of modern China or Mongolia. The beads were recovered from burials at sites associated with the Paekche (RR: Baekje), Kaya (RR: Gaya), and Silla cultural traditions. There have been no local bead workshops found during the Three Kingdoms period and the carnelian beads were manufactured using different drilling technologies compared to earlier Korean drilling. Faceted hexagonal, spherical, and irregularly shaped carnelian beads were perforated using diamond drills, a technology originally developed in South Asia ca. 600 B.C.E. Quantitative analyses of drill hole size and overall size and shape of the beads points to, multiple workshops supplying the imported beads. The distribution patterns of the beads in different polities may reflect changes in trade networks over time as well as stylistic choices of bead shapes used as a means of differentiating specific groups or individuals. Evidence for string wear and external weathering indicate that some beads were used for long periods of time enroute to Korea or in Korea itself before burial in mortuary contexts.\n\nRelations between the Roman and the early Chinese Empires have been considerably popular fields of research, however, principally from a trade-oriented point of view. Contextualising Roman-related glass finds unearthed in the People's Republic of China provides a more complex nexus. Transparent glass vessels carry multiple testimonia of cultural impacts and interactions , leading towards a stereotyped and utopian perception of the Imperium Romanum. This paper focuses on the complexity of such inter-imperial connections through contextualising the most significant Roman-interpreted glass finds in China. Furthermore, by a detailed and critical examination of Roman-related transparent glass vessels , it also aims to highlight problems of earlier identifications and interpretations. In addition, a precise recollection of the existing data not only allows to catalogue these various glass objects, but also helps to insert these glass artefacts into the Roman glass typology system. The extended version of paper presented at The 25th Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference. University of Leicester, Friday 27 to Sunday 29 March 2015.\n\nA B S T R A C T Khao Sek, a coastal settlement located in the Upper-Thai Peninsula and 80 km south of the early urbanized port of Khao Sam Kaeo in the Chumphon province, yielded an impressive quantity of glass waste and ornaments suggesting that glass bracelets and beads were manufactured at the site as early as the 4th c. BCE. This article discusses the glass material found at Khao Sek using typological observation but also elemental analysis with laser ablation – inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry. Beyond obvious morphological resemblance, compositional analyses of the glass confirm similarities between the glass industries at Khao Sam Kaeo and Khao Sek and the existence of a fairly standardized glass ornament production at an early period. This article provides new arguments to discuss the fashioning of a regional standardized craft system as early as the mid-first millennium BC and its role in participating in the production of a pan-regional style, the \" Late Prehistoric South China Sea style \". Finally, this study contributes to define the political developments that took place in the Upper-Thai Peninsula for the period 500 BCE–500 CE, hypothesizing the emergence of a ranked and complementary confederation of ports-of-trade."
