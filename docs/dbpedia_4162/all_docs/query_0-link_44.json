Several plants with antibacterial and healing applications are used in medicine such as Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile L.). Wound infection is one of the most prevalent infections among infectious diseases around the world. Due to appearance of drug resistance, researchers are now paying attention to medicinal plants. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the antimicrobial and wound healing properties of C. nobile against Pseudomonas aeruginosa using in vivo conditions. Ethanolic extract of C. nobile was provided using standard method. The 5% C. nobile ointment was prepared by dissolving lyophilized extract in eucerin. Forty five male rats were obtained from Ilam university. After anesthetization and wound creation, wounds were infected by P. aeruginosa. The rats were divided into three groups, group I was treated with C. nobile ointment, group II was treated with tetracycline ointment and the third group was treated with base gel as control group. Antibacterial and wound healing activities of C. nobile ointment were more than tetracycline ointment significantly. Our results indicated that extract of C. nobile had effective antibacterial activity and accelerated the progression of wound healing. Our study indicated that antibacterial and wound healing activities of C. nobile ointment were notable. C. nobile therapy in combination with antibiotics can also be useful because medicinal plants contents operate in synergy with antibiotics. These results revealed the value of plant extracts to control antibiotic resistant bacteria in wound infections.

In the present study, the gut microbiota, genes associated with metabolism, and putative resistome of Inca and Italian nobility mummies were characterized by using high-throughput sequencing. The Italian nobility mummies exhibited a higher bacterial diversity as compared to the Inca mummies when using 16S ribosomal (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing, but both groups showed bacterial and fungal taxa when using shotgun metagenomic sequencing that may resemble both the thanatomicrobiome and extant human gut microbiomes. Identification of sequences associated with plants, animals, and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) may provide further insights into the dietary habits of Inca and Italian nobility mummies. Putative antibiotic-resistance genes in the Inca and Italian nobility mummies support a human gut resistome prior to the antibiotic therapy era. The higher proportion of putative antibiotic-resistance genes in the Inca compared to Italian nobility mummies may support the hypotheses that a greater exposure to the environment may result in a greater acquisition of antibiotic-resistance genes. The present study adds knowledge of the microbiome resulting from the process of mummification of the human gut, insights of ancient dietary habits, and the preserved putative human gut resistome prior the antibiotic therapy era.\n\nGut Microbiome and Putative Resistome of Inca and Italian Nobility Mummies\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTasha M.

The present study was carried out to investigate the anticancer as well as apoptotic activity of ethyl acetate fraction of C. nobile on different cancerous cell lines. The cells were treated with varying concentrations (0.001- 0.25 mg/mL) of this fraction for 24, 48 and 72 h. Apoptosis induced in MCF-7 cells following treatment with ethyl acetate fraction was measured using Annexin V/PI, flowcytometry and western blotting analysis. The results showed that C. nobile ethyl acetate fraction revealed relatively high antiproliferative activity on MCF-7 cells; however, it caused minimal growth inhibitory response in normal cells. The involvement of apoptosis as a major cause of the fraction-induced cell death was confirmed by annexin-V/PI assay. In addition, ethyl acetate fraction triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by decreasing the Bcl-2 as well as increasing of Bax protein expressions and subsequently increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Furthermore, decreased proliferation of MCF-7 cells in the presence of the fraction was associated with G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. These findings confirm that ethyl acetate fraction of C.nobile may contain a diversity of phytochemicals which suppress the proliferation of MCF-7 cells by inducing apoptosis.\n\nLuminosity on development and flowering of Dendrobium nobile Lindl.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYara Brito Chaim Jardim Rosa\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available This study, conducted at Jardinocultura area of Faculdade de CiÃªncias AgrÃ¡rias of UFGD during the period from September of 2010 to August of 2011, had as aim evaluate the cultivation and flowering of Dendrobium nobile Lindl., under five levels of luminosity (83, 104, 115, 154 e 237 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 . During 12 months the plants were irrigated and fertilized with NPK 10-10-10 and after this period they were evaluated for the number, length and diameter of pseudobulbs, being calculated the increments in relation to initial data. At flowering time it was counted the total buds, reproductive buds, vegetative buds and undifferentiated buds and registered the anthesis at each light intensity. The experimental was arranged at completely randomized design with five treatments and seven replicates with two plants and the averages were compared by Tukey test at 5% probability. All the lighting conditions were favorable to the D. nobile cultivation, being registered increases of 36,7%, 16,0% e 16,2% in the number, diameter and length of pseudobulbs, respectively. The largest number of reproductive buds was observed at 104 Î¼mol m-2 s-1. D. nobile can be cultivated in the light conditions varying between 83 and 237 Î¼mol m-2 s-1, recommending the luminosity of 104 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 to promote their flowering.\n\nAntibacterial, anti-swarming and anti-biofilm formation activities of Chamaemelum nobile against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKazemian, Hossein; Ghafourian, Sobhan; Heidari, Hamid; Amiri, Pouya; Yamchi, Jalil Kardan; Shavalipour, Aref; Houri, Hamidreza; Maleki, Abbas; Sadeghifard, Nourkhoda\n\n2015-01-01\n\nChamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) is widely used throughout the world, and has anti-inflammatory, deodorant, bacteriostatic, antimicrobial, carminative, sedative, antiseptic, anti-catarrhal, and spasmolytic properties. Because of the increasing incidence of drug-resistant bacteria, the development of natural antibacterial sources such as medical herbs for the treatment of infectious diseases is necessary. Extracts from different plant parts such as the leaves, flowers, fruit, and bark of Combretum albiflorum, Laurus nobilis , and Sonchus oleraceus were found to possess anti-quorum sensing (QS) activities. In this study, we evaluated the effect of C. nobile against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation. The P. aeruginosa samples were isolated from patients with different types of infection, including wound infection, septicemia, and urinary tract infection. The flowers of C. nobile were dried and the extract was removed using a rotary device and then dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at pH 7.4. The microdilution method was used to evaluate the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of this extract on P. aeruginosa , and biofilm inhibition was assayed. Eighty percent of the isolated samples (16/20) could form a biofilm, and most of these were isolated from wound infections. The biofilm inhibitory concentration of the C. nobile extract was 6.25-25mg/ml, whereas the MIC was 12.5-50mg/ml. The anti-QS property of C. nobile may play an important role in its antibacterial activity, thus offering an additional strategy in the fight against bacterial infections. However, molecular investigation is required to explore the exact mechanisms of the antibacterial action and functions of this phytocompound.\n\nTandem Mass Spectrometry for Structural Identification of Sesquiterpene Alkaloids from the Stems of Dendrobium nobile Using LC-QToF.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Yan-Hong; Avula, Bharathi; Abe, Naohito; Wei, Feng; Wang, Mei; Ma, Shuang-Cheng; Ali, Zulfiqar; Elsohly, Mahmoud A; Khan, Ikhlas A\n\n2016-05-01\n\nDendrobium nobile is one of the fundamental herbs in traditional Chinese medicine. Sesquiterpene alkaloids are the main active components in this plant. Due to weak ultraviolet absorption and low content in D. nobile, these sesquiterpene alkaloids have not been extensively studied using chromatographic methods. Herein, tandem mass spectrometry combined with liquid chromatography separation provides a tool for the identification and characterization of the alkaloids from D. nobile. A total of nine sesquiterpene alkaloids were characterized by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. These alkaloids can be classified into two subgroups that are represented by dendrobine and nobilonine. Tandem mass spectrometric studies revealed the fragmentation pathways of these two subgroup alkaloids that were used for the identification and characterization of other alkaloids in D. nobile. Characterization of these alkaloids using accurate mass and diagnostic fragments provided a reliable methodology for the analysis of D. nobile by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The limit of detection was defined as the signal-to-noise ratio equal to 3â:â1. Limits of detection of dendrobine and nobilonine were less than 30âng/mL. The developed method was applied for the analysis of various Dendrobium species and related dietary supplements. Alkaloids were identified from D. nobile, but not detected from commercial samples including 13 other Dendrobium species and the 7 dietary supplements.

The effect of silver nitrate concentration, quantity of the plant extract and the reaction time on particle size was optimized and studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The appearance of brownish color with Î» max of 422ânm confirmed the formation of AgNPs. Synthesized nanoparticles were further characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, antimicrobial activity of the AgNPs against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis was evaluated based on the inhibition zone using the disc-diffusion assay and measurement of minimal inhibition concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration by standard microdilution method. In conclusion, synthesis of nanoparticle with aqueous Chamaemelum nobile extract is simple, rapid, environmentally benign and inexpensive. Moreover, these synthesized nanoparticles exhibit significant antibacterial activity.\n\nA new phenolic glycoside from the stem of Dendrobium nobile.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhou, Xue-Ming; Zheng, Cai-Juan; Wu, Jia-Ting; Chen, Guang-Ying; Zhang, Bin; Sun, Chong-Ge\n\n2017-05-01\n\nA new phenolic glycoside dendroside (1), together with seven known compounds (2-8) were isolated from the stems of Dendrobium nobile. The structures of these compounds were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods. The inhibitory activities of all compounds against three cancer cell lines HeLa, MCF-7 and A549 were evaluated.\n\nDendrobium nobile Lindl. alkaloids regulate metabolism gene expression in livers of mice.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXu, Yun-Yan; Xu, Ya-Sha; Wang, Yuan; Wu, Qin; Lu, Yuan-Fu; Liu, Jie; Shi, Jing-Shan\n\n2017-10-01\n\nIn our previous studies, Dendrobium nobile Lindl. alkaloids (DNLA) has been shown to have glucose-lowering and antihyperlipidaemia effects in diabetic rats, in rats fed with high-fat diets, and in mice challenged with adrenaline. This study aimed to examine the effects of DNLA on the expression of glucose and lipid metabolism genes in livers of mice. Mice were given DNLA at doses of 10-80Â mg/kg, po for 8Â days, and livers were removed for total RNA and protein isolation to perform real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Dendrobium nobile Lindl. alkaloids increased PGC1Î± at mRNA and protein levels and increased glucose metabolism gene Glut2 and FoxO1 expression. DNLA also increased the expression of fatty acid Î²-oxidation genes Acox1 and Cpt1a. The lipid synthesis regulator Srebp1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1) was decreased, while the lipolysis gene ATGL was increased. Interestingly, DNLA increased the expression of antioxidant gene metallothionein-1 and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1 (Nqo1) in livers of mice. Western blot on selected proteins confirmed these changes including the increased expression of GLUT4 and PPARÎ±. DNLA has beneficial effects on liver glucose and lipid metabolism gene expressions, and enhances the Nrf2-antioxidant pathway gene expressions, which could play integrated roles in regulating metabolic disorders.

As the important enzyme in the sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (HMGS catalyze the crucial step in the mevalonate pathway in plants. To isolate and identify the functional genes involved in the sesquiterpene biosynthesis of C. nobile L., a HMGS gene designated as CnHMGS (GenBank Accession No. KU529969 was cloned from C. nobile. The cDNA sequence of CnHMGS contained a 1377 bp open reading frame encoding a 458-amino-acid protein. The sequence of the CnHMGS protein was highly homologous to those of HMGS proteins from other plant species. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that CnHMGS clustered with the HMGS of Asteraceae in the dicotyledon clade. Further functional complementation of CnHMGS in the mutant yeast strain YSC6274 lacking HMGS activity demonstrated that the cloned CnHMGS cDNA encodes a functional HMGS. Transcript profile analysis indicated that CnHMGS was preferentially expressed in flowers and roots of C. nobile. The expression of CnHMGS could be upregulated by exogenous elicitors, including methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid, suggesting that CnHMGS was elicitor-responsive. The characterization and expression analysis of CnHMGS is helpful to understand the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoid in C. nobile at the molecular level and also provides molecular wealth for the biotechnological improvement of this important medicinal plant.\n\nCloning, Expression Profiling and Functional Analysis of CnHMGS, a Gene Encoding 3-hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Synthase from Chamaemelum nobile.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCheng, Shuiyuan; Wang, Xiaohui; Xu, Feng; Chen, Qiangwen; Tao, Tingting; Lei, Jing; Zhang, Weiwei; Liao, Yongling; Chang, Jie; Li, Xingxiang\n\n2016-03-08\n\nRoman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile L.) is renowned for its production of essential oils, which major components are sesquiterpenoids.

Due to various anthropogenic pressures the natural populations of this important orchid species are presently facing threats of extinction. In the present study, genetic and chemical diversity existing amongst 6 natural populations of D. nobile were assessed using molecular markers, and the influence of genetic factors on its phytochemical activity especially antioxidant potential was determined. Molecular fingerprinting of the orchid taxa was performed using ISSR and DAMD markers along with the estimation of total phenolics, flavonoids and alkaloid contents. Antioxidant activity was also measured using DPPH and FRAP assays which cumulatively revealed a significant level of variability across the sampled populations. The representatives from Sikkim in Northeast India revealed higher phytochemical activity whereas those from Mizoram showed lesser activity. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that variation amongst the populations was significantly higher than within the populations. The data generated by UPGMA and Bayesian analytical models were compared in order to estimate the genetic relationships amongst the D. nobile germplasm sampled from different geographical areas of Northeast India. Interestingly, identical grouping patterns were exhibited by both the approaches. The results of the present study detected a high degree of existing genetic and phytochemical variation amongst the populations in relation to bioclimatic and geographic locations of populations. Our results strongly establish that the cumulative marker approach could be the best suited for assessing the genetic relationships with high accuracy amongst distinct D. nobile accessions.

Here, we reported a collection of 15017 expressed sequence tags (ESTs from the vernalized axillary buds of an Orchidaceae species, Dendrobium nobile, which were assembled for 9616 unique gene clusters. Functional enrichment analysis showed that genes in relation to the responses to stresses, especially in the form of low temperatures, and those involving in protein biosynthesis and chromatin assembly were significantly overrepresented during 40 days of vernalization. Additionally, a total of 59 putative flowering-relevant genes were recognized, including those homologous to known key players in vernalization pathways in temperate cereals or Arabidopsis, such as cereal VRN1, FT/VRN3, and Arabidopsis AGL19. Results from this study suggest that the networks regulating vernalization-induced floral transition are conserved, but just in a part, in D. nobile, temperate cereals, and Arabidopsis.\n\nBall culture of the Moscow nobility of the 18th - first halfof 19th century: ceremony, entertainment or love game?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÐ Ð ÐÐ¾ÑÐ¾ÑÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð°\n\n2008-06-01\n\nFull Text Available In the article on the basic of various sources, including the manuscripts and personal origin, attempt of reconstruction of ball culture of the Russian metropolitan nobility of the eighteenth and the first half of nineteenth century.

The orchid species, Dendrobium nobile, requires vernalization to achieve flowering in the spring, but the underlying regulatory network has not been identified to date. The MADS-box transcription factor DnAGL19 was previously identified in a study of low-temperature treated D. nobile buds and was suggested to regulate vernalization-induced flowering. In this study, phylogenetic analysis of DnAGL9 and the MADS-box containing proteins showed that DnAGL19 is phylogenetically closely related to the SOC1-like protein from orchid Dendrobium Chao Parya Smile, DOSOC1. The orchid clade closed to but is not included into the SOC1-1/TM3 clades associated with either eudicots or monocots, suggesting that DnAGL19 is an SOC1-1/TM3-like ortholog. DnAGL19 was found to be highly expressed in pseudobulbs, leaves, roots and axillary buds but rarely in flowers, and to be substantially upregulated in axillary buds by prolonged low-temperature treatments. Overexpression of DnAGL19 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in a small but significantly reduced time to bolting, suggesting that flowering time was slightly accelerated under normal growth conditions. Consistent with this, the A. thaliana APETELA1 (AP1 gene was expressed at an earlier stage in transgenic lines than in wild type plants, while the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT gene was suppressed, suggesting that altered regulations on these transcription factors caused the weak promotion of flowering. HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE 1 (HOS1 was slightly activated under the same conditions, suggesting that the HOS1-FT module may be involved in the DnAGL19-related network. Under vernalization conditions, FT expression was significantly upregulated, whereas HOS1 expression in the transgenic A. thaliana has a level similar to that in wild type. Taken together, these results suggest that DnAGL19 controls the action of the\n\nStructural Analysis and Immuno-Stimulating Activity of an Acidic Polysaccharide from the Stems of Dendrobium nobile Lindl.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Jun-Hui; Zuo, Shu-Rong; Luo, Jian-Ping\n\n2017-04-10\n\nDendrobium nobile Lindl., an epiphytic herb distributed in the Southeast Asia, is used as a tonic and antipyretic herbal medicine in China. In this study, a water-soluble acidic heteropolysaccharide, DNP-W4, containing mannose, glucose, galactose, xylose, rhamnose, and galacturonic acid, in the molar ratios of 1.0:4.9:2.5:0.5:1.0:0.9, was obtained from the stems of Dendrobium nobile Lindl. Using methylation analysis, partial acid hydrolysis, pectolyase treatment, NMR, and ESI-MS, the structure of DNP-W4 was elucidated. The obtained data indicated that DNP-W4 was a complex heteropolysaccharide and possessed a backbone composed of (1â4)-linked Î²-d-Glcp, (1â6)-linked Î²-d-Glcp, and (1â6)-linked Î²-d-Galp, with substitutes at O-4/6 of Glcp residues and O-3 of Galp.

Protocorm like bodies (PLBs) were induced from the pseudostem segments using thidiazuron (TDZ; 1.5Â mg/l), by-passing the conventional auxinâcytokinin complement approach for plant regeneration. Although, PLB induction was observed at higher concentrations of TDZ, plantlet regeneration from those PLBs was affected adversely. The best rooting (5.41 roots/shoot) was achieved in MS medium with 1.5Â mg/l TDZ and 0.25% activated charcoal. Plantlets were successfully transferred to a greenhouse with a survival rate of 84.3%, exhibiting normal development. Genetic stability of the regenerated plants was investigated using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and start codon targeted (SCoT) polymorphism markers which detected 97% of genetic fidelity among the regenerants. The PIC values of RAPD and SCoT primers were recorded to be 0.92 and 0.76 and their Rp values ranged between 3.66 and 10, and 4 and 12 respectively. The amplification products of the regenerated plants showed similar banding patterns to that of the mother plant thus demonstrating the homogeneity of the micropropagated plants. A comparative phytochemical analysis among the mother and the micropropagated plants showed a higher yield of secondary metabolites. The regeneration protocol developed in this study provides a basis for ex-situ germplasm conservation and also harnesses the various secondary metabolite compounds of medicinal importance present in D. nobile.

A total of sixty individuals comprising of six natural populations were investigated for the existing natural genetic diversity. One hundred and thirty two (132) amplicons were produced by SCoT marker generating 96.21% polymorphism. The PIC value of the SCoT marker system was 0.78 and the Rp values of the primers ranged between 4.43 and 7.50. The percentage of polymorphic loci (Pp) ranging from 25% to 56.82%, Nei's gene diversity (h) from 0.08 to 0.15 with mean Nei's gene diversity of 0.28, and Shannon's information index (I) values ranging from 0.13 to 0.24 with an average value of 0.43 were recorded. The gene flow value (0.37) and the diversity among populations (0.57) demonstrated higher genetic variation among the populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed 43.37% of variation within the populations, whereas 56.63% variation was recorded among the populations. Cluster analysis also reveals high genetic variation among the genotypes. Present investigation suggests the effectiveness of SCoT marker system to estimate the genetic diversity of D. nobile and that it can be seen as a preliminary point for future research on the population and evolutionary genetics of this endangered orchid species of medicinal importance.

The liberal wing supported the creation of a new world outlook system which was expected to provide the basis for transforming the political system by means of gradual transition to peopleâs representatives or constitutional form of government. The liberal landowners insisted on the introduction of zemstvo (district council, the solution of the Cossack issue; they strived for liberalization of the military and bureaucratic control of the Cossack troops and demanded the withdrawal of civil government agencies from the competence of the Military department. The liberal nobility actively supported the change of conditions of service for the Cossacks and pressed for easier draft obligation and releasing the Cossack troops from police duties which clashed with the military dignity. The conservative type of liberalism prevailed within the noble class of the DHR that distanced itself from both the left and the right political forces. The liberalism of the Don nobles was also a reflection of social and cultural peculiarities of the Cossacks. The social basis of the Don liberalism differed from the common Russian analogs. As the Cossack class was rather numerous at the Don, and its representatives made up quite an important part of the regional liberal corporation, they influenced its tactics and the political programming considerably.\n\nPicrotoxane sesquiterpenoids from the stems of Dendrobium nobile and their absolute configurations and angiogenesis effect.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMeng, Chun-Wang; He, Yu-Lin; Peng, Cheng; Ding, Xing-Jie; Guo, Li; Xiong, Liang\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFive picrotoxane sesquiterpenoids belonging to the unusual dendrobine-type (1 and 4) and the picrotoxinin-type (2, 3, and 5) were isolated from the stems of Dendrobium nobile Lindl. Their structures were established by spectroscopic analyses and physical properties. Compound 1 was a new dendrobine analogue. Although the planar structure of 2 and 3 had been reported, their absolute configurations were first determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and circular dichroism. Compound 2 exhibited angiogenesis effect against sunitinib-induced damage on intersegmental blood vessels in Tg (flk1: EGFP) and Tg (fli1: nEGFP) transgenic zebrafish at concentrations of 3.13, 6.25, 12.50, and 25.00Î¼M.

However, different species of Huoshan Dendrobium exhibit considerable difference in pharmaceutical efficacy, so rapid and absolutely non-destructive discrimination of Huoshan Dendrobium nobile according to different species is crucial to quality control and pharmaceutical effect. In this study, as one type of miniature near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer, MicroNIR 1700 was used for absolutely nondestructive determination of NIR spectra of 90 batches of Dendrobium from five species of differ- ent commodity grades. The samples were intact and not smashed. Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) pattern recognition based on principal component analysis (PCA) was used to classify and recognize different species of Dendrobium samples. The results indicated that the SIMCA qualitative models established with pretreatment method of standard normal variate transformation (SNV) in the spectra range selected by Qs method had 100% recognition rates and 100% rejection rates. This study demonstrated that a rapid and absolutely non-destructive analytical technique based on MicroNIR 1700 spectrometer was developed for successful discrimination of five different species of Huoshan Dendrobium with acceptable accuracy.\n\nArminio nobile e la misura del cielo ovvero le disavventure di un astronomo napoletano\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nCapaccioli, Massimo\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLa scienza Ã¨ unâesaltante avventura che Ã¨ costume raccontare attraverso le gesta dei grandi.

The Heroic Era in Polar Exploration coincided with the conception of film technology and rise of commercial cinema, and many polar explorers saw potential in utilising this new technology as a research tool. As a result there exists a range of films from the Polar Explorations, but since their making and initial screenings they have received little attention. The story of these films is also an interesting one, although it has not yet been written. A few years after the production of the first film cameras, the explorer Carsten Borchgrevink brought one along on his British Antarctic Expedition in 1898. His main sponsor, a newspaper publisher, wanted to make news films, but the cinematograph, the film reel and the filming skills were not sufficiently developed to capture living images from the polar region. Our record of this first attempt at making a polar film is limited to one scene from when the expedition is leaving London.The first explorer to succeed in filming in the Arctic was Anthony Fiala in 1902, and since his breakthrough the cinematograph became standard scientific equipment on all polar expeditions. The Mechanical Era in Polar Exploration came with the aeroplanes, the airships and the telegraph. Roald Amundsen played a major role here; he claimed his idea about using aeroplanes was as important to the polar exploration as NansenÂ´s use of skies and dogsledges in the heroic era. This article tells the story about explorers with film camera trying to reach the North Pole from Spitzbergen. Wellman, Amundsen, Byrd and Nobile are the main characters. The story of their fantastic expeditions is told by others; this is the story about their films, and how the films from the Arctic developed from just documenting landscape and animal life until they became proper documentary\n\nQuantification of spiroether isomers and herniarin of different parts of Matricaria matricarioides and flowers of Chamaemelum nobile.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMa, Chao-Mei; Winsor, Linda; Daneshtalab, Mohsen\n\n2007-01-01\n\nA simple HPLC-PAD-MS method was established to quantitatively analyse two spiroether isomers (cis-en-yn-dicycloether and trans-en-yn-dicycloether) and the main coumarin, herniarin, in chamomile herbs, simultaneously. By using this method, the contents of these three compounds in the flowers of two chamomile species, Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) and pineapple weed (Matricaria matricarioides), as well as in different parts of pineapple weed, were investigated. It was found that the flowers of both herbs contained large amounts of cis-en-yn-dicycloether and trans-en-yn-dicycloether, with the trans-form being more abundant than the cis-form. The leaves of pineapple weed were found to have the highest concentration of cis-en-yn-dicycloether and herniarin than the other parts. HPLC-PAD-MS-guided isolation and identification of other constituents are also discussed.\n\nTransformation of Manor of the Nobility in Russian Culture-Historical space of 18th â19th Centuries (Materials of Chernozem Region\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTatjyana V.

Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic interpretation. The biological activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated toward multiple targets related to inflammation and metabolic disorder such as NAG-1, NF-ÎºB, iNOS, ROS, PPARÎ±, PPARÎ³, and LXR. Similar to the action of NSAIDs, all the six compounds (1-6) increased NAG-1 activity 2-3-fold. They also decreased cellular oxidative stress by inhibiting ROS generation. Compounds 3, 5, and 6 activated PPARÎ³ 1.6-2.1-fold, while PPARÎ± was activated 1.4-fold by compounds 5 and 6 only. None of the compounds showed significant activity against iNOS or NF-ÎºB. This is the first report of biological activity of octulosonic acid derivatives toward multiple pathways related to inflammation and metabolic disorder. The reported anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, antiedemic, and antioxidant activities of Roman chamomile could be partly explained as due to the presence of these constituents.\n\nClergy, nobility and crown in DecadÃªncia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYi Liu\n\n2005-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In the current work I intend to inquire into the internal motives that led the Portuguese seaborne empire to decadence. After making a brief review of the historiography about the decline of Estado da Ãndia, I proceed to the analysis of the Crown-Church-Nobility triangle in the course of os Descobrimentos, and of their respective roles in the evolution of Portuguese empire. The absolutization of the crown, the over-expansion of the clergy and the empowerment of the aristocracy became the most conspicuous and longstanding features in the Portuguese social fabric after the country launched herself into maritime undertakings, which crippled her agriculture and retarded the industrialization. As a consequence, the rise of bourgeoisie and the transformation of mercantilist economy into the capitalist were obstructed, and a strong adventurous but non-productive spirit mixed with disdain of manual work prevailed both in metropolis and in overseas territories. In conclusion, the Portuguese decadence commenced from within rather than from without, and far prior to Dutch intrusions in Portuguese Asia, which only accelerated the decline.No presente trabalho tenciono indagar as causas internas que dirigiram o impÃ©rio marÃ­timo portuguÃªs Ã decadÃªncia.

It gives the evidences of the past the possibility of \"survivingâ to the present day. At the same time, the museum should present these materials to the attention of the public, showing the origins of civilization, life in all its complexity, thereby helping the visitor to better understand the world with its secrets. Considering the role of the museum heritage in the development of society, we carried out a study of the collections of the National Museum of the History of Moldova related to the history of the Bessarabian noble families. The Cantacuzins and the Krupensky are two families, belonging to the elite of the nobility and having a centuries-old history. In our study we are considering the Bessarabian branch of these families. From 1991 to 2005 the National Museum of History of Moldova accepted as a gift and purchased important materials reflecting the history of the Cantacuzin family. These materials were collected by Irina Cantacuzin, the wife of the last descendant of the Bessarabian Cantacuzins, Pavel (1902-1992. Of particular value is the collection of documents and photographs of the family of Pavel Cantacuzin, collected and transferred to the museum by A. Krakan in 1993. It consists of about 50 units, among which 36 are originals and copies of photographs relating to the period from the 19th century to 1990. It is this collection that contains a number of photographs with representatives of the family of Krupensky, who were related to the Cantacuzins. In 2001, the NMHM received another collection of documents, photographs and other materials related to the Bessarabian Prince Pavel Cantacuzin. It reflects his life and activities during the period of imprisonment and after rehabilitation. The museum collections hold several things and household items belonging to these families.

Growing evidence indicates that deficit of autophagy eventually leads to the axonal degeneration. Our previous studies have shown that Dendrobium nobile Lindl alkaloid (DNLA) had protective effect on neuron impairment in vivo and in vitro; however, the underlying mechanisms is still unclear. We exposed cultured hippocampus neurons to AÎ² 25-35 to investigate the effect of DNLA in vitro. Axonal degeneration was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and MTT assay. Neurons overexpressing GFP-LC3B were used to measure the formation of autophagosome. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion, the lysosomal pH, and cathepsin activity were assessed to reflect autophagy process. Proteins of interest were analyzed by Western blot. DNLA pretreatment significantly inhibited axonal degeneration induced by AÎ² 25-35 peptide in vitro. Further studies revealed DNLA treatment increased autophagic flux through promoting formation and degradation of autophagosome in hippocampus neurons. Moreover, enhancement of autophagic flux was responsible for the protective effects of DNLA on axonal degeneration. DNLA prevents AÎ² 25-35 -induced axonal degeneration via activation of autophagy process and could be a novel therapeutic target.

(Estudo in anima nobile)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSilveira, Livio de Barros\n\n2001-07-01\n\nFor this study 20 patients with periodontal disease were selected. The treatment required for all of then was the gingivectomy, a ressective periodontal surgery. This technique consists of removing the whole excess of gingival tissue with the intent of reestablishing the anatomy and the correct function. The gingival area was submitted to 2 different wavelengths and then histologically analysed to search for alterations, mainly concerning mast cells behavior, a blood cell responsible, among other things, for blood vases enlargement. During the surgical procedure each gingival area was submitted to infrared low intensity laser ({lambda} = 785 nm) or to red laser ({lambda} = 688 nm), both with 50 mW of power and fluence of 8 J/cm{sup 2}. A third area was analysed, the control area, in which no laser treatment was employed. The samples were fixated in formol, cut and stained by hematoxyline eosine and toluidine blue. Based on the result we can conclude: the 2 wavelengths used in this study led to the reduction in the number of mast cells present in the tissue as well as to the increase on the degranulation of the remaining mast cells, considered statistically significant taken the degranulation index and; there was no significant difference caused by the action of the two laser wavelengths {lambda}=785 nm and {lambda}=688 nm -50 mW of power and fluence of 8 J/cm{sup 2}-, over the degranulation of the mast cells; the length and width of the randomly chosen blood vases were not statistically different among the analysed groups.

Electron microscopy analysis showed two types of hard phases in the alloy. One-pass mode scanning Kelvin force microscopy (KFM) was used to investigate relative nobility of the hard phases. Volta potential mapping indicates higher nobility for the hard phases than the alloy matrix, and, the V- and N-rich particles exhibit the highest Volta potential. Post-polarization analysis by SEM revealed localized dissolution initiated in matrix regions adjacent to hard phase particles, and the boundary region surrounding the Cr- and Mo-rich particles is more prone to localized corrosion.\n\nHistorisch adelsonderzoek over de late middeleeuwen en de vroegmoderne periode in BelgiÃ« en Nederland: een momentopname\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJ.

On the one hand, the collected essays demonstrate the state-of-the-art in the research carried out in 2008 on the nobility, on the other, they focus on the mediaeval and early modern periods. The major themes and problems of this historiographical tradition are evoked, emerging from the study outlined in another special issue of a historical journal, the Tijdschrift voor Geschiedenis of 1980, which looked at perspectives for future research. This introduction mainly examines the methods used by historians to confront inevitable questions such as: âWhat exactly is the nobility?â and âHow can this historical phenomenon be situated within processes and historical movements such as economic structures and conjunctures, social mobility and political centralization and decentralization?â\n\nExogenous Catalase and Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Improve Survival and Regeneration and Affect Oxidative Stress in Cryopreserved Dendrobium nobile Protocorm-like Bodies.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDi, W; Jia, M X; Xu, J; Li, B L; Liu, Y\n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative damage is responsible for viability loss in plant tissues following cryopreservation. Antioxidants may improve viability by preventing or repairing the injury. This work aimed at studying the effect of catalase (CAT) and pyruvateÂ dehydrogenase (PDH), which are involved in ROS metabolism and are differentially expressed during pollen cryopreservation, for cryopreservation of Dendrobium nobile Lindl. 'Hamana Lake Dream' protocorm-like bodies (PLBs). Different concentrations of exogenous CAT or PDH were added at the loading, PVS2 treatment, unloading steps during vitrification-cryopreservation of PLBs. Their survival and regeneration were evaluated and correlated with physiological oxidative indexes. PLB survival increased significantly when CAT and PDH were added separately to the unloading solution at a suitable concentration. CAT at 400 UÂ·ml -1 increased PLB survival and regeneration by 33.5 and 14.6 percent respectively. It had no impact on the production of superoxide anion radical (Â·O2-) and on superoxideÂ dismutase (SOD) activity, but it reduced the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and enhanced ascorbicÂ acid (AsA) and endogenous CAT levels compared to PLBs cryopreserved using the standard vitrification protocol (CK1). PDH at 0.1 UÂ·ml -1 significantly improved PLB survival (by 2.5 percent), but it had no marked effect on regeneration compared to the CK1 group. It induced the same variationsÂ in Â·O2-, AsA and endogenous CAT levels that were observed following CAT addition. However, PDH did not affect the H 2 O 2 and MDA content but significantly increased SOD activity. These results indicate that the addition of 400 UÂ·ml -1 CAT and 0.1 UÂ·ml -1 PDH at the unloading step increased survival of cryopreserved PLBs and that this improvement was associated with scavenging of H 2 O 2 and the repair of oxidative damage. Exogenous CAT also significantly improved PLB regeneration after\n\nCeremonial dress of the Achaemenid nobility of the VIâ V centuries BC (according to findings from the fifth Pazyryk kurgan and synchronous iconic monuments of the Achaemenid time\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTsareva E.G.\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The article represents the results of study of a unique composite horse trapping and breast belt, found by expedition of S.I.

(Case study: noble family Celinski and Cernilev/Cernelevski In the article, based on archive documents and published monographic studies, to treat the problem of assimilation of allergenic nobles by Bessarabian nobility, having as example the polish nobles. Being strategically, located Bessarabia was of particular interest in expansion policy of the Russian Empire. For these reasons, once the territory annexed, the tsarist searched to create a social base here to support and promote imperial policy. Besides granting various privileges to the native population, especially to the nobility, the imperial administration directed an intense colonization policy of the territory between Dniester and Prut and infiltration of Russian nobles or just simple clerks of Russian origin, coming from different parts such as Poland, Austria etc. among native nobility. As a result, during the XIXth century, alongside with local boyars in the confirmation of titles of nobility, at the commission created to this purpose, were registered representatives of allergenic nobility. Analysis of the files submitted by polish nobility revealed that their noble titles were confirmed after the presentation of a certificate certifying the applicant's noble affiliation by Assembly of Deputies of nobility from Podolia. There are as well cases of refusal of confirmation of titles to the polish nobility.

Fumigant toxicity varied with plant essential oils or constituents, exposure time, and concentration. Among the tested essential oils, those from Chamaemelum nobile exhibited the strongest fumigant toxicity, followed by those from Santolina chamaecyparissus, Ormenis multicaulis, and Eriocephalus punctulatus at 2 days after treatment. In all, 15, 24, 19, and 9 compounds were identified in the essential oils from C. nobile, E. punctulatus, O. multicaulis, and S. chamaecyparissus, respectively, by using gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, or open-column chromatography. The identified compounds were tested individually for their fumigant toxicity against Japanese termites. Among the test compounds, trans-pinocarveol, caryophyllene oxide, sabinene hydrate, and santolina alcohol showed strong fumigant toxicity against Japanese termites. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition activity of the identified compounds from C. nobile, E. punctulatus, O. multicaulis, and S. chamaecyparissus essential oils were tested to determine the mode of their action. The IC50 values of (+)-Î±-pinene, (-)-limonene, (-)-Î±-pinene, Î²-pinene, and Î²-phellandrene against Japanese termite AChE were 0.03, 0.13, 0.41, 0.42, and 0.67mg/mL, respectively. Further studies are warranted to determine the potential of these essential oils and their constituents as fumigants for termite control. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, the nutritional characterisation of C. nobile was performed, and herbal material and its decoction and infusion were submitted to an analysis of phytochemicals and bioactivity evaluation. The antioxidant activity was determined by free radicals scavenging activity, reducing power and inhibition of lipid peroxidation, the antitumour potential was tested in human tumour cell lines (breast, lung, colon, cervical and hepatocellular carcinomas), and the hepatotoxicity was evaluated using a porcine liver primary cell culture. C. nobile proved to be an equilibrated valuable herb rich in carbohydrates and proteins, and poor in fat, providing tocopherols, carotenoids and essential fatty acids (C18:2n6 and C18:3n3). Moreover, the herb and its infusion are a source of phenolic compounds (flavonoids such as flavonols and flavones, phenolic acids and derivatives) and organic acids (oxalic, quinic, malic, citric and fumaric acids) that showed antioxidant and antitumour activities, without hepatotoxicity. The most abundant compounds in the plant extract and infusion were 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid and an apigenin derivative. These, as well as other bioactive compounds, are affected in C. nobile decoction, leading to a lower antioxidant potential and absence of antitumour potential. The plant bioactivity could be explored in the medicine, food, and cosmetic industries. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Bendrick\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available The airship Italia, commanded by General Umberto Nobile, crashed during its return flight from the North Pole in 1928. The cause of the accident was never satisfactorily explained. We present evidence that the crash may have been fatigue-related. Nobile's memoirs indicate that at the time of the crash he had been awake for at least 72 h. Sleep deprivation impairs multiple aspects of cognitive functioning necessary for exploration missions. Just prior to the crash, Nobile made three command errors, all of which are of types associated with inadequate sleep. First, he ordered a release of lift gas when he should have restarted engines (an example of incorrect data synthesis, with deterioration of divergent thinking; second, he inappropriately ordered the ship above the cloud layer (a deficiency in the assessment of relative risks; and third, he remained above the cloud layer for a prolonged period of time (examples of attention to secondary problems, and calculation problems. We argue that as a result of these three errors, which would not be expected from such an experienced commander, there was no longer enough static lift to maintain level flight when the ship went below the cloud layer. Applying Circadian Performance Simulation Software to the sleepâwake patterns described by Nobile in his memoirs, we found that the predicted performance for someone awake as long as he had been is extremely low. This supports the historical evidence that human fatigue contributed to the crash of the Italia.\n\nDe Beaufort, een aanzienlijke familie tijdens de Republiek, de Bataafs-Franse tijd en het Koninkrijk 1613-1876\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMelchers, R.R.J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn 1613 Pierre de Beaufort aged 18, left the French town of Sedan for the Dutch Republic.

The Cu 3s photoabsorption cross-section seems to be strongly overestimated. âº We find/confirm that (CuAu) dealloying proceeds into depth like a spinodal decomposition. -- Abstract: We studied pristine and leached ultra-thin Cu{sub x}Au (x â 4) films by hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Au 4f and Cu 3s core levels show a shift in binding energy which is opposite to expected from the nobility of the elements, which is explained by charge transfer involving differently screening s and d valence levels of the elements [W. Eberhardt, S.C. Wu, R. Garrett, D. Sondericker, F. Jona, Phys. Rev. B 31 (1985) 8285]. The magnitude of the chemical shifts of the metal lines is strongly influenced by the finite size and disorder of the films. Angular dependent photoelectron emission allowed to assess the alloy composition as a function of depth larger than 5 nm. The potential controlled dealloying proceeds into depth like a spinodal decomposition with Cu going into solution and the remaining Au accumulating in the surface region. The compositional gradient did not lead to a significant broadening of the metal photoelectron lines suggesting a non-local screening mechanism.\n\nElectrochemical, Polarization, and Crevice Corrosion Testing of Nitinol 60, A Supplement to the ECLSS Sustaining Materials Compatibility Study\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, R. E.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn earlier trials, electrochemical test results were presented for six noble metals evaluated in test solutions representative of waste liquids processed in the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Subsequently, a seventh metal, Nitinol 60, was added for evaluation and subjected to the same test routines, data analysis, and theoretical methodologies. The previous six test metals included three titanium grades, (commercially pure, 6Al-4V alloy and 6Al-4V low interstitial alloy), two nickel-chromium alloys (Inconel(RegisteredTrademark) 625 and Hastelloy(RegisteredTrademark) C276), and one high-tier stainless steel (Cronidur(RegisteredTrademark) 30). The three titanium alloys gave the best results of all the metals, indicating superior corrosive nobility and galvanic protection properties. For this current effort, the results have clearly shown that Nitinol 60 is almost as noble as titanium, being very corrosion-resistant and galvanically compatible with the other six metals electrochemically and during long-term exposure. is also quite noble as it is very corrosion resistant and galvanically compatible with the other six metals from both an electrochemical perspective and long-term crevice corrosion scenario. This was clearly demonstrated utilizing the same techniques for linear, Tafel and cyclic polarization, and galvanic coupling of the metal candidate as was done for the previous study. The high nobility and low corrosion susceptibility for Nitinol 60 appear to be intermediate to the nickel/chromium alloys and the titanium metals with indications that are more reflective of the titanium metals in terms of general corrosion and pitting behavior.\n\nBasic study of magnetic microwires for sensor applications: Variety of magnetic structures\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nChizhik, Alexander, E-mail: oleksandr.chyzhyk@ehu.es [Universidad del Pais Vasco, UPV/EHU, 20080 San Sebastian (Spain); Zhukov, Arcady [Universidad del Pais Vasco, UPV/EHU, 20080 San Sebastian (Spain); IKERBASQUE, 48011 Bilbao (Spain); Gonzalez, Julian [Universidad del Pais Vasco, UPV/EHU, 20080 San Sebastian (Spain); Stupakiewicz, Andrzej [Laboratory of Magnetism, University of Bialystok, 15-245 Bialystok (Poland)\n\n2017-01-15\n\nWe examine magnetic glass-coated microwires used for magnetic sensors.

Different surface magnetic domains coexist, characterized by various domain periods, magnetization directions, and nobilities of domain walls. - Highlights: â¢ Temperature induced transformation of the domain structure in the microwires. â¢ Co-existence of two magnetic structures differing in period and mobility of domain walls. â¢ Short review of the basic domain structures in microwire.\n\nAW OCRACY LOPMENT LAW DEMOCRACY & DEVELOPMENT\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nLAW\n\nserved as a central authority, while regional/provincial and local nobilities exercised ... and the accommodation of diversity in Ethiopia: A comparative study (2007) at 16; .... expansionist move.25 This was the case, for instance, in Kafa, the Oromo ..... and urban local government: woredas (districts) in rural areas and cityÂ ...\n\nFrom the local fueros to the Valenciaâs Fuero in the Context of the Feudal Society Instauration Process at the 13th Century in the Reign of Valencia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEnric GUINOT RODRÃGUEZ\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper analyzes the process of changing local laws (fueros to a territorial law (fuero in the context of the new kingdom of Valencia created in 1240 by King James I. Following the tradition of Catalonia and Aragon, also in Valencia the crown and nobility initially organized the repopulation based on different local fueros: SepÃºlveda, Zaragoza, Daroca, Teruel, Fontana, costum de Lleida or costum/fuero of Valencia. But from 1245, the monarchy drove the territorial law (fuero of Valencia, which has traditionally been interpreted as a political reason for confrontation between Catalan and Aragonese populators. Our study explains how the Fuero of Zaragoza/Aragon was limited during the 13th Century to a few seigneuries, and how widespread the Fuero of Valencia. Thus, the conflict between the nobility of Aragonese origin to the public power (monarchy and citizens began when the first courts of 1261 approved extending the Fuero of Valencia as a territorial law for the new kingdom.\n\nBolshevik Revolution.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHueston, Stephen P.\n\nSuitable for use in a high school social studies course, this class game simulates the political interaction and general unrest in the nine-month period following the death of Tsar Nicholas II in Russia in 1917.

Ãngeles Faya DÃ­az\n\n2003-04-01\n\nFull Text Available The kings of the Austria dynasty used widely the sale of offices with the purpose of arbitrating resources for their hegemonical politics. Through the analysis of this sales we have been able to settle down the serious economic and social consequences they brought as well as the institutional opposition generated. The process of patrimonialization of the public thing and the oligarchic way taken by the municipalities propitiated abuses and corruption, causing the complete degradation of the municipal institution. For the highest layer of the nobility, it supposed a statement of their power and his dignificaciÃ³n as a class. To satisfy their longings of power the nobility will invest in offices, dominions and taxes (Â«alcabalasÂ» sold by the kings. While the Crown obtains about 300.000 ducados from the sale of offices, the investment in unproductive goods and the inmobilization of the capitals of the nobility caused a lack of wealth creation in Asturias. The expense of the dominant class adquiring habits and titles as well as his luxury and ostentation, they act in the same sense. In addition, the costs of cases, rescues and consumption of offices produced the indebtedness of the municipalities and, together with other forms of fiscal pressure, an important social cost.\n\nDendrobium nobile Lindley and its bibenzyl component moscatilin are able to protect retinal cells from ischemia/hypoxia by dowregulating placental growth factor and upregulating Norrie disease protein.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChao, Wen-Haur; Lai, Ming-Yi; Pan, Hwai-Tzong; Shiu, Huei-Wen; Chen, Mi-Mi; Chao, Hsiao-Ming\n\n2018-06-22\n\nPresumably, progression of developmental retinal vascular disorders is mainly driven by persistent ischemia/hypoxia. An investigation into vision-threatening retinal ischemia remains important. Our aim was to evaluate, in relation to retinal ischemia, protective effects and mechanisms of Dendrobium nobile Lindley (DNL) and its bibenzyl component moscatilin. The therapeutic mechanisms included evaluations of levels of placental growth factor (PLGF) and Norrie disease protein (NDP). An oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model involved cells cultured in DMEM containing 1% O 2 , 94% N 2 and 0Â g/L glucose. High intraocular pressure (HIOP)-induced retinal ischemia was created by increasing IOP to 120Â mmHg for 60Â min in Wistar rats. The methods included electroretinogram (ERG), histopathology, MTT assay and biochemistry. When compared with cells cultured in DMEM containing DMSO (DMSO+DMEM), cells subjected to OGD and pre-administrated with DMSO (DMSO+OGD) showed a significant reduction in the cell viability and NDP expression. Moreover, cells that received OGD and 1Â h pre-administration of 0.1Â Î¼M moscatilin (Pre-OGD Mos 0.1Â Î¼M) showed a significant counteraction of the OGD-induced decreased cell viability. Furthermore, compared with the DMSO+OGD group (44.54âÂ±â3.15%), there was significant elevated NDP levels in the Pre-OGD Mos 0.1Â Î¼M group (108.38âÂ±â29.33%). Additionally, there were significant ischemic alterations, namely reduced ERG b-wave, less numerous retinal ganglion cells, decreased inner retinal thickness, and reduced/enhanced amacrine's ChAT/MÃ¼ller's GFAP or vimentin immunolabelings. Moreover, there were significantly increased protein levels of HIF-1Î±, VEGF, PKM2, RBP2 and, particularly, PLGF (pg/ml; Sham vs. Vehicle: 15.11âÂ±â1.58 vs. 39.53âÂ±â5.25). These ischemic effects were significantly altered when 1.0Â g/Kg/day DNL (DNL1.0â+âI/R or I/R+ DNL1.0) was applied before and/or after ischemia, but not vehicle (Vehicle+I/R).

Dubey\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Needle shaped SbTeI crystals were obtained by solid state reaction. Electrical resistance was measured in the temperature range of 4âK to 550âK. SbTeI shows a metallic behavior from 4âK to 300âK, and at higher temperature (>300âK, it shows semiconducting behavior. Unlike SbSI, this material shows almost zero resistance around 550âK. It shows a piezoelectric behavior "
