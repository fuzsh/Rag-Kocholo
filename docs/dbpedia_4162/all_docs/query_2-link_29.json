Since Cryocyte bags of Baxter (B-bags) are no longer available, an alternative bag was sought. Also, the influence of freezing volume was studied. Miltenyi Biotec (MB)- and MacoPharma (MP)-bags passed the integrity tests without failure. Comparing MB- and MP-bags with B-bags, no difference in WBC recovery or viability was found when using a WBC-enriched product as a \"dummy\" HPC product. Further, a freezing volume of 30âmL resulted in better WBC recovery and viability than 60âmL. Additonal studies using real HPC might be necessary. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Clinical translation of differentiation protocols requires standardization of production procedures, and surface-marker-based cell sorting is considered instrumental for reproducible generation of defined cell products. Here, we demonstrate that integrin-associated protein (IAP) is a cell surface marker suitable for enrichment of hPSC-derived mesDA progenitor cells. Immunomagnetically sorted IAP + mesDA progenitors showed increased expression of ventral midbrain floor plate markers, lacked expression of pluripotency markers, and differentiated into mature dopaminergic (DA) neurons inÂ vitro. Intrastriatal transplantation of IAP + cells sorted at day 16 of differentiation in a rat model of PD resulted in functional recovery. Grafts from sorted IAP + mesDA progenitors were more homogeneous in size and DA neuron density. Thus, we suggest IAP-based sorting for reproducible prospective enrichment of mesDA progenitor cells in clinical cell replacement strategies. Copyright Â© 2017 Miltenyi Biotec GmbH.

Known as the City of Light, Paris has been extolled for centuries as one of the great cities of the world. Its location on the Seine River, at a strategic crossroads of land and river routes, has been the key to its expansion since the Parisii tribe first settled here in the 3rd century BC. Paris is an alluring city boasting many monumental landmarks, such as the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the Louvre, and the Eiffel Tower. Its beautiful gardens, world-class cuisine, high fashion, sidewalk cafÃ©s, and intellectual endeavors are well known.

The study material consisted of 12 frozen HPC pairs (= 24 transplant units) that were no longer needed for autologous treatment of patients. After thawing, one unit of a pair was transferred into the Miltenyi (M) bag; the other unit remained in the original Baxter (B) bag. After refreezing both units, all units were stored again under cryogenic conditions either partially immersed in liquid nitrogen (n = 22) or in the vapor phase over liquid nitrogen, n = 2, <-170Â°) before thawing. The correlation coefficients (r) between the results obtained from the two bag types were high for white blood cells (WBC) content (r = 0.98), mononuclear cells (MNC) (r = 0.97), lymphocytes (r = 0.98), monocytes (r = 0.96), membrane integrity (r = 0.93), concentration of 'free' hemoglobin (r = 0.97) and hemolysis rate (r = 0.95). With regard to clonogenicity, there were no significant differences (Student's paired t-test) for the three parameters investigated [i.e. total number of colonies, including the numbers of burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies, respectively). The CryoMACS freezing bag 200-074-402 is bioequivalent to the Cryocyte freezing container R4R9955. An advantageous feature of the CryoMACS is that its double-sterile wrapping provides additional safety regarding potential cross-contamination during cryogenic storage.\n\n[Suicide in Paris and Ile-de-France].\n\nPubMed\n\nLecomte, D; Hatton, F; Jougla, E; Le Toullec, A\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA study carried out in collaboration between the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Paris and the INSERM (SC8) concerned all the suicide occurred in Paris region over 1990; 455 suicides in Paris and 1,229 in the suburbs of Paris (overall, 1,684 suicides observed in Paris area for the same period). For Paris city, the rate of suicide reaches 23.3 per 100,000 subjects. This frequency increases up to 40 years and falls after this age with a further rise between 75 and 85 years. Suicide represents 17% of the total mortality for adolescents and young adults living in Paris, with a large over-representation of males (277 males, 178 females). Suicide is more frequent before 45 years in Paris than in France but this tendency is reversed after 45 years. It represents the first cause of violent deaths among young population (15-34 years) living in Paris and is, after AIDS, the second cause of death. In Paris suburbs, it constitutes the second cause of mortality after traffic accidents. The mode of suicide in Paris is essentially poisoning, then hanging and jumping from high place. In contrast, outside Paris, the hanging is more frequently used than poisoning and firearms. The contribution of the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Paris is essential for the knowledge of these voluntary deaths, a large part of them being unknown in the National statistic of causes of death. This underestimation is extremely important: only 68% of the suicides are known by the Official Statistic in Paris region and 26% for Paris city.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nParis INDCs: will they achieve the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTribett, W. R.; Salawitch, R. J.; Hope, A. P.; Bennett, B.; Canty, T. P.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe provide an overview of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted prior to the 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which are the backbone of the Paris Climate Agreement. Two flavors of INDCs were submitted: unconditional (i.e., firm commitments) and conditional (commitments contingent on financial flow and/or technology transfer). Generally, the Paris INDCs extend to year 2030. However, achievement of either the target (1.5 Â°C warming) or upper limit (2.0 Â°C warming) of the Paris Agreement requires consideration of emissions out to 2060, due to the projected rise in energy demand, growing populations, and rising standards of living. We therefore project global carbon emissions out to year 2060, and compare to various RCP scenarios of IPCC (2013). These projections will be used to assess whether the target (1.5 Â°C warming) or upper limit (2.0 Â°) of the Paris Climate Agreement will be met.\n\nParis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2001-01-01\n\n[figure removed for brevity, see original site] Figure 1 This image of Paris was acquired on July 23, 2000 and covers an area of 23 by 20 km.

This study was aimed to elucidate the chemical characteristics of Paris fargesii var. brevipetala (PFB) that may be administrated as alternate resource of legal RP. A HPLC-ELSD method was established to characterize the steroid saponins in rhizomes of PFB and two legal Paris species [Paris polyphylla var. chinensis (PPC) and P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis (PPY)] in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (CP). Ten saponins (paris saponins I, II, V, VI, VII, H, gracillin and other three paris saponins) were involved as standards. The results indicated that PFB contained pennogenyl saponins as the main components with small amounts of diosgenin saponins. The total contents of the detected saponins in PFB ranged from 9.12mg/g to 85.33mg/g. Nine of the twelve PFB samples own a total content of paris saponins I, II, VI, and VII more than 6.0mg/g (meeting the standard of CP 2010 edition). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares-Discriminate Analysis (PLS-DA) both confirmed the fact that saponin profiles of PFB, PPC and PPY were different from each other. In addition, paris saponin H (Ps H), the predominant saponin of PFB (>50%), was tested in vitro to evaluate its cytotoxic activities on HepG2, A549, RPE and L929 cells with a positive control of Cisplatin. Ps H showed a remarkable cytotoxic activity on A549 cells with an IC(50) value of 1.53Â±0.08Î¼g/mL. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Donald Cline Astronomy Scholar. I developed multiple projects and assisted as a mentor to PARI Space Science Lab and Duke TIP high school gifted student program which both took place during my stay. My main focus was the development of the Polaris imaging telescope. This telescope is used to take images of the pulsating variable star Polaris. These readings are used to make seeing estimates for the air column above PARI. The system stores and archives images and analyzes them for magnitude change and movement of the stellar image. In addition to the Polaris project I developed a solar panel voltage and charge monitoring system which involved me working with charge controllers and photovoltaic technology. I developed a charging scheme using Flexmax 60 charge controller. Data is recorded and transmitted via optical fiber for analysis and correlation with solar zenith angle.\n\nPARIS reprograms glucose metabolism by HIF-1Î± induction in dopaminergic neurodegeneration.\n\nPubMed\n\nKang, Hojin; Jo, Areum; Kim, Hyein; Khang, Rin; Lee, Ji-Yeong; Kim, Hanna; Park, Chi-Hu; Choi, Jeong-Yun; Lee, Yunjong; Shin, Joo-Ho\n\n2018-01-22\n\nOur previous study found that PARIS (ZNF746) transcriptionally suppressed transketolase (TKT), a key enzyme in pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in the substantia nigra (SN) of AAV-PARIS injected mice. In this study, we revealed that PARIS overexpression reprogrammed glucose metabolic pathway, leading to the increment of glycolytic proteins along with TKT reduction in the SN of AAV-PARIS injected mice. Knock-down of TKT in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells led to an increase of glycolytic enzymes and decrease of PPP-related enzymes whereas overexpression of TKT restored PARIS-mediated glucose metabolic shift, suggesting that glucose metabolic alteration by PARIS is TKT-dependent. Inhibition of PPP by either PARIS overexpression or TKT knock-down elevated the level of H 2 O 2 , and diminished NADPH and GSH levels, ultimately triggering the induction of HIF-1Î±, a master activator of glycolysis. In addition, TKT inhibition by stereotaxic injection of oxythiamine demonstrated slight decrement of dopaminergic neurons (DNs) in SN but not cortical neurons in the cortex, suggesting that TKT might be a survival factor of DNs. In differentiated SH-SY5Y, cell toxicity by GFP-PARIS was partially restored by introduction of Flag-TKT and siRNA-HIF-1Î±. We also observed the increase of HIF-1Î± and glycolytic hexokinase 2 in the SN of Parkinson's disease patients. Taken together, these results suggest that PARIS accumulation might distort the balance of glucose metabolism, providing clues for understanding mechanism underlying selective DNs death by PARIS.

If UV hazard has been evaluated in tropical countries or in some population - children, outdoor activities - little information is available about UV hazard in high latitude towns like Paris, considered as the most 'charismatic city' in the world. To evaluate UV exposure in Paris in spring, in sun and shade, in real life conditions. We evaluated erythemal UV exposure, during four sunny days in May-June in eight Paris touristic sites during peak hours (2 days), and during two walks in touristic downtown of Paris. Measures were performed in sun and shade. UV radiation exposure was evaluated with UV index performed with a 'Solarmeter ultraviolet index (UVI)' and UV dose with 'standard erythema dose' (SED) and 'minimal erythema dose' (MED) calculations. Despite 'average' UVI in sunny conditions, a 4-h sun exposure reaches 13-20 SED and 3-10 MED according to phototype. Clouds were inefficient to protect against UV. Shade of places reduces moderately UVI (50-60%) in forecourts. Exposure during 1-h walk reach at least one MED in real life conditions for skin phototypes I-IV. UV risk for tourist is quite high in spring in Paris. UVI remains high despite high cloud fraction. Shade reduces UVI, but UV protection factor is only 2-3 in large places such as Place Notre Dame and Place Charles de Gaulle. So sun protection campaigns should be proposed, and sun protective strategies could be integrated in urban planning. Â© 2012 The Authors.

Smith is extensively used in traditional systems of Indian and Chinese medicines mainly for its anticancerous property. The national and international demand for P. polyphylla is constantly increasing and most of the supplies come from wild. Illegal and unscientific exploitation coupled with habitat destruction decreases the natural population of the herb, as a consequence this species comes under vulnerable category. Restoration and conservation of the natural population of this potential herb is prerequisites. This article aims to provide an overview on chemical and biological prospective of P. polyphylla. Secondary metabolites such as daucosterol, polyphyllin D, Î² -ecdysterone, Paris saponins I, II, V, VI, VII, H, dioscin, oligosaccharides, heptasaccharide, octasaccharide, trigofoenoside A, protogracillin, Paris yunnanosides G-J, padelaoside B, pinnatasterone, formosanin C and 20-hydroxyecdyson saponins have been isolated from P. polyphylla. Several biological activities such as anticancerous, antitumor, cytotoxic, anthelmintic, antimicrobial, antiangiogenic, immunostimulating, contractile and hemostatic have also been reported. Consequently, this review will be helpful to the researcher and scientist for further research.\n\nPINK1 Primes Parkin-Mediated Ubiquitination of PARIS in Dopaminergic Neuronal Survival.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Yunjong; Stevens, Daniel A; Kang, Sung-Ung; Jiang, Haisong; Lee, Yun-Il; Ko, Han Seok; Scarffe, Leslie A; Umanah, George E; Kang, Hojin; Ham, Sangwoo; Kam, Tae-In; Allen, Kathleen; Brahmachari, Saurav; Kim, Jungwoo Wren; Neifert, Stewart; Yun, Seung Pil; Fiesel, Fabienne C; Springer, Wolfdieter; Dawson, Valina L; Shin, Joo-Ho; Dawson, Ted M\n\n2017-01-24\n\nMutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and parkin cause autosomal-recessive Parkinson's disease through a common pathway involving mitochondrial quality control. Parkin inactivation leads toÂ accumulation of the parkin interacting substrate (PARIS, ZNF746) that plays an important role in dopamine cell loss through repression of proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1-alpha (PGC-1Î±) promoter activity. Here, we show that PARIS links PINK1 and parkin in a common pathway that regulates dopaminergic neuron survival. PINK1 interacts with and phosphorylates serines 322 and 613 of PARIS to control its ubiquitination and clearance by parkin. PINK1 phosphorylation of PARIS alleviates PARIS toxicity, as well as repression of PGC-1Î± promoter activity. Conditional knockdown of PINK1 in adult mouse brains leads to a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that is dependent on PARIS. Altogether, these results uncover a function of PINK1 to direct parkin-PARIS-regulated PGC-1Î± expression and dopaminergic neuronal survival. Copyright Â© 2017 The Author(s).

Paris's wartime circumstances deviate substantially from the \"all else being equal\" assumption, and at least three other hypotheses for the cirrhosis decline may be contemplated. Historical and statistical review. Wartime Paris underwent tumultuous changes. Wine consumption did decline, but there were, as well, a myriad of other changes in diet and life experience, many involving new or heightened hardships, nutritional, experiential, institutional, health and mortality risks. Three competing hypotheses are presented: (1) A fraction of the candidates for cirrhosis mortality may have fallen to more sudden forms of death; (2) alcoholics, heavy drinkers and Paris's clochard subpopulation may have been differentially likely to become removed from the city's wartime population, whether by self-initiated departure, arrest and deportation, or death from other causes, even murder; and (3) there was mismeasurement in the cirrhosis mortality decline. The alcohol-cirrhosis connection provided the template for the alcohol research effort (now more than 20 years old) aimed at re-establishing scientific recognition of alcohol's direct alcohol-problems-generating associations and causal responsibilities. In a time given to reports of weaker associations of the alcohol-cirrhosis connection, the place and importance of the Paris curve in the wider literature, as regards that connection, remains. For this reason, the Paris findings should be subjected to as much research scrutiny as they undoubtedly deserve.\n\nPARIS II: Computer Aided Solvent Design for Pollution Prevention\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThis product is a summary of U.S. EPA researchers' work developing the solvent substitution software tool PARIS II (Program for Assisting the Replacement of Industrial Solvents, version 2.0).

Even if all countries abide by the Paris climate agreement, capping global mean temperatures to 2oC will likely require net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2085 and substantial negative emissions over the long term. Before the Paris agreement was finished, it was clear that the pledged emission cuts by 2030 would not be sufficient in and of themselves, to stay under 2oC. Given the accumulation of greenhouse gases to date, limiting warming to a maximum of 2oC would require bending the curve of global emissions by 2020, i.e., over the next four years. If the past is a prologue, without even taking into account an emergence from the global recession, we stand a realistic chance of blowing right past the 2oC target. What, then, are the challenges going forward? Is 2oC a real goal that is attainable, or is it a stretch goal? Meeting a 2oC target is a function of when mitigation begins in earnest, the rate of mitigation, and the rate and amount of carbon sequestration. What are the implications of this trade space? While much effort has been put into designing a climate observing system from a science perspective, relatively little thought has been put into determining what observations are needed to support policy decisions, mitigation, and verify the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions that resulted from the Paris Agreement. If 2oC is a stretch goal, intellectual honesty requires that we consider mitigation and adaptation in tandem, and not as either/or. Similarly, even with all its attendant ethical dilemmas, it is important to thoroughly study geoengineering so that policy makers have a robust\n\nAEC Experiment Establishes Computer Link Between California and Paris\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\ndemonstrated that a terminal in Paris could search a computer in California and display the resulting (Copies) AEC EXPERIMENT ESTABLISHES COMPUTER LINK BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND PARIS The feasibility of a worldwide information retrieval system which would tie a computer base of information to terminals on the\n\nEnvisioning disaster in the 1910 Paris flood.\n\nPubMed\n\nJackson, Jeffrey H\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis article uncovers the visual narratives embedded within the photography of the 1910 Paris flood.

Investigating three interlocking narratives of ruin, beauty, and fraternitÃ©, the article shows how photographs of Paris under water allowed residents to make sense of the destruction but also to imagine the cityâs reconstruction. The article concludes with a discussion of the role of visual culture in recovering from urban disasters.\n\n[Chemical Constituents of Paris polyphylla var. chinensis Aerial Parts].\n\nPubMed\n\nYin, Wei; Song, Zu-rong; Liu, Jin-qi; Zhang, Guo-sheng\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTo study the chemical constituents of aerial parts of Paris polyphylla var. chinensis .

PARIS represses the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator-1Î± (PGC-1Î±), although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that PARIS can be SUMOylated, and its SUMOylation plays a role in the repression of PGC-1a promoter activity. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT y (PIASy) was identified as an interacting protein of PARIS and shown to enhance its SUMOylation. PIASy repressed PGC-1a promoter activity, and this effect was attenuated by PARIS in a manner dependent on its SUMOylation status. Co-expression of SUMO-1 with PIASy completely repressed PGC-1a promoter activity independently of PARIS expression. PARIS-mediated PGC-1a promoter repression depended on the activity of histone deacetylases (HDAC), whereas PIASy repressed the PGC-1a promoter in an HDAC-independent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that PARIS and PIASy modulate PGC-1a gene transcription through distinct molecular mechanisms. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The first informations concerning this topic reached England in late fall of 1846 and after that came to France and especially Paris. The German physician Aloys Martin from Munich who was living in Paris at that time was largely responsible for conveying the news about these new findings in medical science to the German-speaking nations. Controversial discussions concerning the anaesthetic properties of ether developed among the members of various scientific circles right after the news from America had reached the city--and many members of the \"Verein Deutscher Aerzte in Paris\" (Association of German Physicians in Paris) took part in them, Martin then was one of the club's most active members and repeatedly reported on the new method as a correspondent for the widely read \"Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung\": Documents discovered recently at the archives of the \"Leopoldinisch-Carolinischen Akademie\" of Halle provide an interesting insight into this association, whose members tried to find out more about the anaesthetic properties and side effects of ether carrying out a series of well appreciated self-experiments in the spring of 1847. The following text reports on the history of the \"Verein Deutscher Aerzte in Paris\" which has largely fallen into oblivion and emphasizes the importance of Aloys Martin whose name is strongly attached to the spread of the use of ether throughout the German-speaking countries.\n\nMessier, Copernicus, Flamsteed: The SAF Rare-Book Collection in Paris\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPasachoff, Jay M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe historic books belonging to the SociÃ©tÃ© Astronomique de France, founded by Camille Flammarion in 1887, are located partly in Paris and partly at the Flammarion site in Juvisy, a Paris suburb.

Nevertheless, the budget could suggest a certain wealth. Receipts are mainly based on financial funding and real estate incomes. Expenses are, for one half, linked to patients considered as hosts: food, heating, cleaning, etc. Staff expenses are moderate (12%). Various expenditures are in the same range within the different hospitals. It is interesting to outline the fact that drug expenses have the same importance than 150 years later: 4%. This feature is only an average insofar as general hospital spend about 10% of their budget in drugs as long-term care hospitals spend 1%. This disparity is clearly the proof of an increasing medicalization of Paris hospitals in the middle of the 19th century.\n\n[History of the JournÃ©es Dermatologiques de Paris].\n\nPubMed\n\nTilles, G\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFounded in 1801 at the HÃ´pital Saint-Louis, Paris, under Jean-Louis Alibert, the French School of Dermatology was initially structured around the French Society of Dermatology (1889) and the organization of two world congresses (Paris 1889, 1900). After World War I, the creation of dermatological societies in the provinces infused French dermatology with new energy. In 1922, the first congress of the French-speaking dermatologists further contributed to the public profile of dermatologists in France. The \"JournÃ©es de Mars\" were initiated in 1961 at the HÃ´pital Saint-Louis, and in 1975 they went on to become the \"JournÃ©es dermatologiques de Paris\". Pr. Jean Civatte played a key role in their creation and in their organization for 30 years. After 1979, since actual patients could no longer be presented, the organizers of the congress had to change the content of the meeting from clinical presentations to post-graduate teaching and clinical research. From its origins in the form of meetings of French dermatologists in an intimate setting at the HÃ´pital Saint-Louis, the \"JournÃ©es dermatologiques de Paris\" grew within the ensuing decades into a major scientific event of the French-speaking dermatological community, bringing together more than 4000 participants in December each year.

The cohort investigated in this study consisted of 830 male members of the Brigade des sapeurs-pompiers de Paris (BSPP). These professional had served for a minimum of 5 years on 1 January 1977. They were monitored for a 14 year period, finishing 1 January 1991. When compared to the average French male, the Paris fire-fighters were found to have a far lower overall mortality (SMR = 0.52 [0.35-0.75]). None of the cause specific SMRs were significantly different from unity. However a greater number of deaths than expected was observed for genito-urinary cancer (SMR = 3.29), digestive cancer (SMR = 1.14), respiratory cancer (SMR = 1.12) and 'cerebrovascular disease' (SMR = 1.16). The low overall SMR observed was consistent with the healthy worker effect. As for cause specific SMRs, they will be confirmed or invalidated by a further analysis as the follow-up of this cohort is being carried on.\n\nFlashbulb memories of the Paris attacks.\n\nPubMed\n\nGandolphe, Marie-Charlotte; El Haj, Mohamad\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFlashbulb memories are vivid autobiographical memories of the circumstances where an individual first learns about emotionally significant public events. Our paper assesses whether these memories were triggered by the attacks of Friday 13 November 2015 in Paris. Two hundred and ninety-one participants answered a web-based questionnaire that assessed their memory of the circumstances in which they first learned of the attacks. The questionnaire also assessed vividness, rehearsal, emotion, surprise and novelty. The results showed substantial and vivid recall of the context in which the participants first learned of the event. This recall was associated with fair rehearsal, negative emotional valence, surprise, and novelty. Regression analysis showed that the flashbulb recall was predicted by negative emotion. Negative emotion seems to play a key role in the formation of flashbulb memories, at least those associated with the Paris attacks.

In France, synthetic cathinones emerged in 2008 (while first mentioned by the French police force in 2007Â first alerts among users appeared in 2008) and have grown to be popular drugs of abuse. Under the Official Journal dated 11thÂ JuneÂ 2010, only mephedrone has been listed as narcotics but \"designer drugs\" have synthesized new substitute cathinones in order to avoid anti-drug laws. However, since JulyÂ 2012, in France, all synthetic drugs from the cathinones family have been banned and listed as narcotics following the example of United Kingdom. Despite their recent classification and inclusion on narcotic list, they are readily available on Internet and used widely. Paris Addictovigilance Centre observed a signal of derivate cathinones abuse (21Â cases over a two-year period). Paris Addictovigilance Centre and Marmottan Hospital wanted to describe the use of cathinones in the Paris area and alert the health care community about the abuse identification and risk assessment problems of these compounds. After a review of derivated cathinone's chemical structure, pharmacology and toxicology, this article seeks to provide patricians with a clinical description and treatment's modality. Most users of synthetic cathinones will experience euphoria, increased energy, talkativeness, openness and increased sexual arousal. Signs and symptoms of toxicity are consistent with a sympathomimetic toxidrome. The main reasons for care access are psychiatric (hallucinations, psychotic symptoms, agitation) and addiction disorders. Somatic complications were described with various patterns of symptoms such as headache, tachycardia, confusional states, rhabdomyolysis with renal failure or serotonin syndrome.

In this new era, ecosystems across the globe face mounting dual pressure from human land use change (LUC) and climate change (CC). With the Paris Agreement, the international community has committed to holding global warming below 2Â°C above preindustrial levels, yet current pledges by countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions appear insufficient to achieve that goal. At the same time, the sustainable development goals strive to reduce inequalities between countries and provide sufficient food, feed, and clean energy to a growing world population likely to reach more than 9 billion by 2050. Here, we present a macro-scale analysis of the projected impacts of both CC and LUC on the terrestrial biosphere over the 21st century using the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to illustrate possible trajectories following the Paris Agreement. We find that CC may cause major impacts in landscapes covering between 16% and 65% of the global ice-free land surface by the end of the century, depending on the success or failure of achieving the Paris goal. Accounting for LUC impacts in addition, this number increases to 38%-80%. Thus, CC will likely replace LUC as the major driver of ecosystem change unless global warming can be limited to well below 2Â°C. We also find a substantial risk that impacts of agricultural expansion may offset some of the benefits of ambitious climate protection for ecosystems.\n\n[Studies on the extraction process of total saponins from Paris polyphylla Smith].\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Zhi-Guo; Zhang, Lin; Li, Ling-Jun; Tian, Jing-Kui\n\n2007-06-01\n\nTo optimize the extraction process of total saopnins from Paris polyphylla Smith.

It has been used as an ingredient of 81 Chinese patent medicines, with a wide application and large market demand. Based on the data retrieved from state Intellectual Property Office patent database, a comprehensive analysis was made on Paris patents, so as to explore the current features of Paris patents in the aspects of domestic patent output, development trend, technology field distribution, time dimension, technology growth rate and patent applicant, and reveal the development trend of China's Paris industry. In addition, based on the current Paris resource application and development, a sustainable, multi-channel and multi-level industrial development approach was built. According to the results, studies of Paris in China are at the rapid development period, with a good development trend. However, because wild Paris resources tend to be exhausted, the studies for artificial cultivation technology should be strengthened to promote the industrial development.

Furthermore, the richness and variety of the Paris Observatory's patrimonial collections, which includes ancient books, periodicals, manuscripts, archives, and iconographic documents, makes it an invaluable source for research on the history of astronomy. This is why the Paris Observatory library has started work on a digitisation policy and has since launched several digitisation projects.\n\nGHG monitoring over Paris megacity and OrlÃ©ans forest\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTe, Y.

C.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nIn a growing world with more than 7 billion inhabitants and big emerging countries such as China, Brazil and India, emissions of anthropogenic pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs) are increasing continuously. Their monitoring and control in megacities have become a major challenge for scientists and public health authorities in environmental research area. The ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer (QualAir FTS[a], model IFS 125HR) of the QualAir platform located in downtown Paris at University Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), is a scientific research instrument dedicated to the survey of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and urban air quality. Equipped with a sun-tracker, the remote sensing QualAir FTS relies on solar infrared absorption for monitoring trace gas concentrations and their variability in the Ile-de-France region[b]. Concentrations of atmospheric GHGs, especially CO2, CH4 and N2O, are retrieved by the radiative transfer model PROFFIT[c]. Because Paris is the third largest European megacity, the QualAir FTS can provide new and complementary measurements as compared to existing ground-based FTS network stations (NDACC and TCCON) located in unpolluted environments, such as the TCCON-OrlÃ©ans station[d] situated in the forest of OrlÃ©ans (100 km south of Paris). In the effort to integrate QualAir FTS into the TCCON network, simultaneous FTS measurements of GHGs at Paris and OrlÃ©ans have been performed. We will emphasize on comparisons of CO2 from these two sites. Our comparison will be completed by high-resolved direct CO2 modeling outputs from the Meso-NH model, and ground in situ measurements at different sites (OrlÃ©ans/Trainou, Paris/Jussieu, Paris/Eiffel Tower). Parts of the data were acquired in the framework of the French CO2-MEGAPARIS project[e, f], whose main goal is to quantify CO2 emissions from the Paris area. The present data intercomparison will help to reduce uncertainties in carbon cycle models and to better characterize regional GHG fluxes\n\n75 FR 41523 - Paris Accessories, Inc., Including On-Site Leased Workers From Job Connections, New Smithville...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-07-16\n\n...

Thus far, the validity and reproducibility of this classification have not been assessed. We aimed to determine the interobserver agreement for the Paris classification among seven Western expert endoscopists. A total of 85 short endoscopic video clips depicting polyps were created and assessed by seven expert endoscopists according to the Paris classification. After a digital training module, the same 85 polyps were assessed again. We calculated the interobserver agreement with a Fleiss kappa and as the proportion of pairwise agreement. The interobserver agreement of the Paris classification among seven experts was moderate with a Fleiss kappa of 0.42 and a mean pairwise agreement of 67%. The proportion of lesions assessed as \"flat\" by the experts ranged between 13 and 40% (P<0.001). After the digital training, the interobserver agreement did not change (kappa 0.38, pairwise agreement 60%). Our study is the first to validate the Paris classification for polyp morphology. We demonstrated only a moderate interobserver agreement among international Western experts for this classification system. Our data suggest that, in its current version, the use of this classification system in daily practice is questionable and it is unsuitable for comparative endoscopic research. We therefore suggest introduction of a simplification of the classification system.\n\nThe epileptic singers of belle Ã©poque Paris.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaxendale, Sallie; Marshall, Fiona\n\n2012-12-01\n\nIn late 19th century Paris, people with epilepsy were treated alongside those with hysteria in the now famous SalpÃªtriÃ¨re Hospital, where both conditions were deemed to have a neurological basis. When Jean Martin Charcot became chief physician at the SalpÃªtriÃ¨re Hospital in 1862, he described himself 'in possession of a kind of museum of living pathology whose holdings were virtually inexhaustible'. He opened the doors of his 'living museum' and exhibited his prize specimens to all of Paris. By putting his patients on display, Charcot introduced a vogue for pathology that permeated well beyond the world of medical enquiry and into the public psyche and vernacular. Not only did Charcot's demonstrations provide the inspiration for high culture in the form of operas, plays and novels, they also provided the inspiration for the 'gommeuses epileptiques' (epileptic singers), who entertained the masses at the cafÃ© concerts. This paper explores the foundations of our current medical approaches to mental illness and epilepsy, with a particular focus on the boundaries that emerged between hysteria and epilepsy in 19th century Paris. These clinical boundaries were both shaped by and reflected in the popular entertainments in the city.\n\nThe Paris to Lexington Road Reconstruction Project.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2001-09-01\n\nThis report summarizes the effort to provide the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet with an evaluation of the results obtained for the Paris to Lexington Road Reconstruction Project from 1997 to 2001.

This article begins with a textual analysis of the 1.5Â°C goal. It considers whether the goal creates individual or collective obligations for Parties, and whether it is sufficiently specific to enable the tracking of individual or collective performance. Next, it assesses the operational relevance of the 1.5Â°C temperature goal, by considering the role it will play in the Paris Agreement's institutions and procedures. To the extent that the goal plays a role, and implies global limits on greenhouse gas emissions, this article observes that it could have implications for the sharing of the effort between Parties. Thus, this article considers the relevance of equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, to understanding how the 1.5Â°C goal could be reached. In this context, this article explores whether the 1.5Â°C goal could play a role in the Paris Agreement's `ambition cycle'. Finally, this article asks whether there are any legal or political implications, individually or collectively under the Paris Agreement, should the Parties fail to achieve the 1.5Â°C goal. This article is part of the theme issue `The Paris Agreement: understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels'.\n\nInterobserver reproducibility of The Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology.\n\nPubMed\n\nLong, Theresa; Layfield, Lester J; Esebua, Magda; Frazier, Shellaine R; Giorgadze, D Tamar; Schmidt, Robert L\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology represents a significant improvement in classification of urinary specimens. The system acknowledges the difficulty in cytologically diagnosing low-grade urothelial carcinomas and has developed categories to deal with this issue. The system uses six categories: unsatisfactory, negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (NHGUC), atypical urothelial cells, suspicious for high-grade urothelial carcinoma, high-grade urothelial carcinoma, other malignancies and a seventh subcategory (low-grade urothelial neoplasm). Three hundred and fifty-seven urine specimens were independently reviewed by four cytopathologists unaware of the previous diagnoses. Each cytopathologist rendered a diagnosis according to the Paris System categories. Agreement was assessed using absolute agreement and weighted chance-corrected agreement (kappa). Disagreements were classified as low impact and high impact based on the potential impact of a misclassification on clinical management. The average absolute agreement was 65% with an average expected agreement of 44%. The average chance-corrected agreement (kappa) was 0.32. Nine hundred and ninety-nine of 1902 comparisons between rater pairs were in agreement, but 12% of comparisons differed by two or more categories for the category NHGUC. Approximately 15% of the disagreements were classified as high clinical impact. Our findings indicated that the scheme recommended by the Paris System shows adequate precision for the category NHGUC, but the other categories demonstrated unacceptable interobserver variability. This low level of diagnostic precision may negatively impact the applicability of the Paris System for widespread clinical application.\n\n76 FR 12399 - Culturally Significant Objects Imported for Exhibition Determinations: âParis: Life & Luxuryâ\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-03-07\n\n...

Why BjÃ¸rnstjerne BjÃ¸rnson died in Paris 1910].\n\nPubMed\n\nAarli, J A\n\n1995-12-10\n\nThe Norwegian poet and playwright BjÃ¸rnstjerne BjÃ¸rnson (1832-1910), Nobel prize laureate in literature 1903, died in Paris. He had suffered from angina pectoris for a few years and had difficulties in walking because of thrombophlebitis in his right leg. In 1909, he had received electrotherapy from a French physiologist, Dr. d'Arsonval, in Paris and felt rejuvenated after the treatment. In May 1909, while undergoing spa treatment in Larvik, he had an apoplexy which left him with a left hemiparesis, presumably due to a thrombosis of the right internal carotid artery. He became bedridden, developed focal epilepsy and was unable to participate in the national cultural activities that used to be part of his life. He then decided to return to Paris for another series of electrotherapy. He was brought to Paris in the Royal Danish railway carriage, and was received at the border as an official guest of the French republic. The electrotherapy machine was installed in his room at Hotel Wagram, where he stayed for several months while receiving treatment. However, his health deteriorated during the treatment and he died in Paris in April 1910.\n\nImpact of zinc roofing on urban runoff pollutant loads: the case of Paris.\n\nPubMed\n\nGromaire, M C; Chebbo, G; Constant, A\n\n2002-01-01\n\nPrevious research on the Marais catchment in Paris demonstrated the very high zinc and cadmium contamination of runoff from zinc roofing. Thus further investigations were aimed at evaluating the relative importance of this type of roofing in Paris and its potential contribution to zinc and cadmium loads in wet weather flows. According to these results, about 40% of the surface of roofs in Paris is covered with rolled zinc (1016 ha), and this proportion is not likely to vary significantly in the next years, due to architectural rules. The Zn and Cd concentrations measured in runoff from these roofs are in accordance with literature\n\nImplementation Targets for the Paris Climate Agreement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBennett, B.; Hope, A. P.; Tribett, W. R.; Salawitch, R. J.; Canty, T. P.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe provide an overview of reductions in the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) needed to achieve either the target (1.5 Â°C warming) or upper limit (2.0 Â°C warming) of the Paris Climate Agreement. We will show how much energy must be produced, either by renewables that do not emit significant levels of atmospheric GHGs or via carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) coupled to fossil fuel power plants, to meet forecast global energy demand out to 2060. These projections will be based on two modeling frameworks: our empirical model of global climate (EM-GC) and the CMIP 5 GCMs used throughout IPCC (2013). For each framework, we will show estimates of transient climate response to cumulative emission of carbon to place limits on future emission of CO2 via the combustion of fossil fuel. We will also quantify the impact of future atmospheric CH4 on achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nThe legal character and operational relevance of the Paris Agreement's temperature goal.\n\nPubMed\n\nRajamani, Lavanya; Werksman, Jacob\n\n2018-05-13\n\nThis article assesses the legal character and operational relevance of the Paris Agreement's 1.5Â°C temperature goal. This article begins with a textual analysis of the 1.5Â°C goal. It considers whether the goal creates individual or collective obligations for Parties, and whether it is sufficiently specific to enable the tracking of individual or collective performance. Next, it assesses the operational relevance of the 1.5Â°C temperature goal, by considering the role it will play in the Paris Agreement's institutions and procedures. To the extent that the goal plays a role, and implies global limits on greenhouse gas emissions, this article observes that it could have implications for the sharing of the effort between Parties. Thus, this article considers the relevance of equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, to understanding how the 1.5Â°C goal could be reached. In this context, this article explores whether the 1.5Â°C goal could play a role in the Paris Agreement's 'ambition cycle'. Finally, this article asks whether there are any legal or political implications, individually or collectively under the Paris Agreement, should the Parties fail to achieve the 1.5Â°C goal.This article is part of the theme issue 'The Paris Agreement: understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels'.

M.; Ali, Nasar; Fierro, Giuseppe; Aliofkhazraei, Mahmood; Chipara, Mircea\n\n2018-07-01\n\nThe \"International Conference on Surfaces, Coatings and Nano-Structured Materials\" (NANOSMAT) has rapidly emerged as the premier conference in the field of materials science, engineering, technology and all aspects of \"nano\". The 12th International Conference on Surfaces, Coatings and Nanostructured Materials (NANOSMAT) was held at the Pierre & Marie Curie University in Paris, France. This conference is in the NANOSMAT conference series. The first two NANOSMAT conferences were held in Portugal (2005, 2007), whereas, the subsequent NANOSMAT meetings were held in Barcelona (Spain), Rome (Italy), Reims (France), Krakow (Poland), Prague (Czech Republic), Granada (Spain), Dublin (Ireland), Manchester (UK) and Aveiro (Portugal).\n\nNumerical determination of Paris law constants for carbon steel using a two-scale model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMlikota, M.; Staib, S.; Schmauder, S.; BoÅ¾iÄ, Å½.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nFor most engineering alloys, the long fatigue crack growth under a certain stress level can be described by the Paris law. The law provides a correlation between the fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR or da/dN), the range of stress intensity factor (ÎK), and the material constants C and m. A well-established test procedure is typically used to determine the Paris law constants C and m, considering standard specimens, notched and pre-cracked. Definition of all the details necessary to obtain feasible and comparable Paris law constants are covered by standards. However, these cost-expensive tests can be replaced by appropriate numerical calculations. In this respect, this paper deals with the numerical determination of Paris law constants for carbon steel using a two-scale model. A micro-model containing the microstructure of a material is generated using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to calculate the fatigue crack growth rate at a crack tip. The model is based on the Tanaka-Mura equation. On the other side, a macro-model serves for the calculation of the stress intensity factor. The analysis yields a relationship between the crack growth rates and the stress intensity factors for defined crack lengths which is then used to determine the Paris law constants.\n\nComparison of Synthetic Media Designed for Expansion of Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nLensch, Michelle; Muise, Angela; White, Lisa; Badowski, Michael; Harris, David\n\n2018-05-14\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into various cell types, such as osteoblasts, myocytes, and adipocytes. This characteristic makes the cells a useful tool in developing new therapies for a number of common maladies and diseases. The utilization of animal-derived growth serum, such as fetal bovine serum (FBS), for the expansion of MSCs has traditionally been used for cell culture. However, in clinical applications, animal-derived products present limitations and safety concerns for the recipient, as exposure to animal (xeno-) antigens and infectious agents is possible. Multiple synthetic, xeno-free media have been developed to combat these limitations of animal-derived growth serum and have the potential to be used in ex vivo MSC expansion for clinical use. The goal of this study was to determine if xeno-free media are adequate to significantly and efficiently expand MSCs derived from adipose tissue. MSCs were cultured in both standard FBS-containing as well as xeno-free media. The media were compared for cell yield, viability, and phenotypic expression via flow cytometry and directed differentiation. The xeno-free media that were tested were StemMACS MSC Expansion Media (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), PLTMax Human Platelet Lysate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and MesenCult-hPL media (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). All xeno-free media showed promise as a feasible replacement for animal-derived growth serums. The xeno-free media expanded MSCs more quickly than the FBS-containing medium and also showed great similarity in cell viability and phenotypic expression. In fact, each xeno-free media produced a greater viable cell yield than the standard FBS-containing medium.\n\nEvaluating maturation and genetic modification of human dendritic cells in a new polyolefin cell culture bag system.\n\nPubMed\n\nMacke, Lars; Garritsen, Henk S P; Meyring, Wilhelm; Hannig, Horst; PÃ¤gelow, Ute; WÃ¶rmann, Bernhard; Piechaczek, Christoph; Geffers, Robert; Rohde, Manfred; Lindenmaier, Werner; Dittmar, Kurt E J\n\n2010-04-01\n\nDendritic cells (DCs) are applied worldwide in several clinical studies of immune therapy of malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and transplantations. Most legislative bodies are demanding high standards for cultivation and transduction of cells. Closed-cell cultivating systems like cell culture bags would simplify and greatly improve the ability to reach these cultivation standards. We investigated if a new polyolefin cell culture bag enables maturation and adenoviral modification of human DCs in a closed system and compare the results with standard polystyrene flasks. Mononuclear cells were isolated from HLA-A*0201-positive blood donors by leukapheresis. A commercially available separation system (CliniMACS, Miltenyi Biotec) was used to isolate monocytes by positive selection using CD14-specific immunomagnetic beads. The essentially homogenous starting cell population was cultivated in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 in a closed-bag system in parallel to the standard flask cultivation system. Genetic modification was performed on Day 4. After induction of maturation on Day 5, mature DCs could be harvested and cryopreserved on Day 7. During the cultivation period comparative quality control was performed using flow cytometry, gene expression profiling, and functional assays. Both flasks and bags generated mature genetically modified DCs in similar yields. Surface membrane markers, expression profiles, and functional testing results were comparable. The use of a closed-bag system facilitated clinical applicability of genetically modified DCs. The polyolefin bag-based culture system yields DCs qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to the standard flask preparation. All steps including cryopreservation can be performed in a closed system facilitating standardized, safe, and reproducible preparation of therapeutic cells.\n\nAutomated manufacturing of chimeric antigen receptor T cells for adoptive immunotherapy using CliniMACS prodigy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMock, Ulrike; Nickolay, Lauren; Philip, Brian; Cheung, Gordon Weng-Kit; Zhan, Hong; Johnston, Ian C D; Kaiser, Andrew D; Peggs, Karl; Pule, Martin; Thrasher, Adrian J; Qasim, Waseem\n\n2016-08-01\n\nNovel cell therapies derived from human T lymphocytes are exhibiting enormous potential in early-phase clinical trials in patients with hematologic malignancies. Ex vivo modification of T cells is currently limited to a small number of centers with the required infrastructure and expertise. The process requires isolation, activation, transduction, expansion and cryopreservation steps. To simplify procedures and widen applicability for clinical therapies, automation of these procedures is being developed. The CliniMACS Prodigy (Miltenyi Biotec) has recently been adapted for lentiviral transduction of T cells and here we analyse the feasibility of a clinically compliant T-cell engineering process for the manufacture of T cells encoding chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) for CD19 (CAR19), a widely targeted antigen in B-cell malignancies. Using a closed, single-use tubing set we processed mononuclear cells from fresh or frozen leukapheresis harvests collected from healthy volunteer donors. Cells were phenotyped and subjected to automated processing and activation using TransAct, a polymeric nanomatrix activation reagent incorporating CD3/CD28-specific antibodies. Cells were then transduced and expanded in the CentriCult-Unit of the tubing set, under stabilized culture conditions with automated feeding and media exchange. The process was continuously monitored to determine kinetics of expansion, transduction efficiency and phenotype of the engineered cells in comparison with small-scale transductions run in parallel. We found that transduction efficiencies, phenotype and function of CAR19 T cells were comparable with existing procedures and overall T-cell yields sufficient for anticipated therapeutic dosing. The automation of closed-system T-cell engineering should improve dissemination of emerging immunotherapies and greatly widen applicability. Copyright Â© 2016.

Up until now there has been a lack of data on air quality in child day care centers. The aim of this study is to document the indoor environment quality of Paris child day care centers by repeated measurements, and to compare pollutant levels in child day care centers with levels in Paris dwellings. We selected 28 child day care centers frequented by a random sample of babies who participated in the PARIS birth cohort environmental investigation, and visited the child day care centers for one week twice in one year. Biological contaminants assessed were fungi, endotoxin, dust mite allergens, and chemical pollutants: aldehydes, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Relative humidity, temperature, and carbon dioxide levels were measured simultaneously. A standardized questionnaire was used to gather information about the buildings and their inhabitants. Airborne endotoxin levels in child day care centers were higher than those found in Paris dwellings. Dust mite allergens in child day care centers were below the threshold level for sensitization in the majority of samples, and in common with dwelling samples. Penicillium and Cladosporium were the most commonly identified genera fungi. The child day care center indoor/outdoor ratio for most chemical pollutants was above unity except for NO2, the levels for NO2 being significantly higher than those measured in homes. Chemical and biological contamination in child day care centers appears to be low, apart from endotoxin and NO2. Failure to take child exposure in child day care centers into account could result in an overestimation of children's exposure to other pollutants. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

R.; Huang, J.; Hutchins, M.; Liang, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAfter the recent US Federal Administration announcement not to adhere to the Paris Accords, 359 mayors (and counting) in the US pledged to maintain their commitments, reducing emissions within their jurisdictions by 26-28% from their 2005 levels by the year 2025. While important, this leaves a large portion of the US landscape, and a large amount of US emissions, outside of the Paris commitment. With Federal US policy looking unlikely to change, could additional effort by US cities overcome the gap in national policy and achieve the equivalent US national Paris commitment? How many cities would be required and how deep would reductions need to be? Up until now, this question could not be reliably resolved due to lack of data at the urban scale. Here, we answer this question with new data - the Vulcan V3.0 FFCO2 emissions data product - through examination of the total US energy related CO2 emissions from cities. We find that the top 500 urban areas in the US could meet the national US commitment to the Paris Accords with a reduction of roughly 30% below their 2015 levels by the year 2025. This is driven by the share of US emissions emanating from cities, particularly the largest cohort. Indeed, as the number of urban areas taking on CO2 reduction targets grows, the less the reduction burden on any individual city. In this presentation, we provide an analysis of US urban CO2 emissions and US climate policy, accounting for varying definitions of urban areas, emitting sectors and the tradeoff between the number of policy-active cities and the CO2 reduction burden.\n\nCurrent and historical perspectives on methodological flaws in processing umbilical cord blood.\n\nPubMed\n\nMehrishi, J N\n\n2013-11-01\n\nUmbilical cord blood (UCB) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC-CD34+) are valuable for treating malignant or nonmalignant disease. Processing UCB by HESPAN-6% and anti-CD34-Miltenyi particles provides insufficient cells for treating adults. Physicochemical-electrokinetic studies on UCB-mononuclear cells (MNCs) under conditions of delayed processing, ice or very low temperatures, and some cell separation media identified artifacts introduced by procedures. Adsorption of biomaterials from cell damage by temperature, degradation products after using enzymes, harsh reagents, dithiothreitol, and HESPAN affect cell properties and distribution. Miltenyi particles internalized by cells could release iron that accumulating in liver or spleen would then risk toxicity. Summary topics included the effects of temperature, HESPAN (fast sedimenting agent), glycoproteases, DNase, and dithiothreitol risk affecting cell receptors in recognition, \"homing,\" leading to possible unintended iatrogenic bioeffects should such cells be transfused into humans. The loss of undetectable and uncaptured low CD34 antigen-bearing cells by Miltenyi particles seems to occur when the current methods of isolation of CD34+ cells and other cells are critically assessed. The purpose here is to highlight and suggest avoiding the procedural flaws involved. Preventing ice temperatures avoids ice-damaged platelets releasing biomaterials that are adsorbed on cells altering UBC-MNCs/HSC properties and cell loss. Omitting the positive selection with antibody-linked Miltenyi particles obviates the use of harsh reagents to release the cells. Internalized Miltenyi particles are a toxicity hazard that needs investigations. Achieving approximately 5% yields of CD34+ cells (153âÃâ10(5) /110âmL cord-placenta blood) is a major advance holding great promise, for the first time increasing the prospect of stem cell therapy of 70-kg adults, using a single UCB donation (with dose of 1.5âÃâ10(5) cells/kg) and\n\nParis terrorist attack: early lessons from the intensivists.\n\nPubMed\n\n2016-04-08\n\nDuring the night of 13-14 November, the city of Paris was exposed, within a few hours, to three bomb explosions, four shooting scenes, and one 3-hour hostage-taking of several hundred people causing at least 130 deaths and more than 250 injured victims. Most unstable patients were transferred to the six trauma centers of the Paris area, all members of the TRAUMABASE Group. A rapid adaptation of the organization of trauma patients' admittance was required in all centers to face the particular needs of the situation. Everything went relatively well in all centers, with overall hospital mortality below 2 %. Nevertheless, most physicians nowadays agree that anticipation, teaching, and training are crucial to appropriately face such events. All of us have learned many additional issues from this experience. Following a meeting of the TRAUMABASE Group, the most relevant issues are detailed in the following.\n\nParis saponin-induced autophagy promotes breast cancer cell apoptosis via the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nXie, Zhan-Zhi; Li, Man-Mei; Deng, Peng-Fei; Wang, Sheng; Wang, Lei; Lu, Xue-Ping; Hu, Liu-Bing; Chen, Zui; Jie, Hui-Yang; Wang, Yi-Fei; Liu, Xiao-Xiao; Liu, Zhong\n\n2017-02-25\n\nParis saponins possess anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects. However, the anticancer effect of Paris saponins has not been well elucidated and the mechanisms underlying the potential function of Paris saponins in cancer therapy are needed to be further identify. In this study, we report that saponin compounds isolated from Paris polyphylla exhibited antitumor activity against breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Paris saponin XA-2 induced apoptosis in both cell lines, as evidenced by the activation of caspases and cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. The ability of XA-2 to induce autophagy was confirmed by acridine orange staining, accumulation of autophagosome-bound Long chain 3 (LC3)-II, and measurement of autophagic flux. XA-2-induced autophagy was observed to promote apoptosis by the combined treatment of breast cancer cell lines with XA-2 and autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1, respectively. Moreover, we report a decrease in the levels of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway proteins, such as the phosphorylated forms of Akt, mTOR, P70S6K, and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). Taken together, these results provide important insights explaining the anticancer activity of Paris saponins and the potential development of XA-2 as a new therapeutic agent.

P.; Paltsev, S.; Chen, Y. H. H.; Monier, E.; Libardoni, A. G.; Forest, C. E.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn December of 2015 during COP21 meeting in Paris almost 200 countries signed an agreement pledging to reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Recently USA announced plans to withdraw from the agreement. In this study, we estimate an impact of this decision on future climate using the MIT Integrated Global System Model, which consists of the human activity model, Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, and a climate model of intermediate complexity, the MIT Earth System Model (MESM). For comparison, we also estimated impacts of possible withdrawals of China, Europe or India. In addition to the \"no climate policy\" scenario, we consider five emissions scenarios: Paris, Paris_no_USA, Paris_no_EUR and so on. Climate simulations were carried out from 1861 to 2005 driven by prescribed changes in GHGs and natural forcings and them continued to 2100 driven by GHG emissions produced by EPPA model. Because Paris agreement only cover the period up to 2030, last five scenarios were created assuming that emissions or carbon intensity will continue to decrease after 2030 at the same rate as in the 2020-2030 period. To account for uncertainty in climate system response to external forcing, we carry out 400 member ensembles on climate simulations for each scenario. Probability distributions for climate parameters are obtained by comparing simulated climate for 1861 to 2010 with observations. Our analysis shows that, full implementation of Paris agreement (under above-descried assumptions) will increase probability of surface air temperature in the last decade of this century increasing by less than 3oC relative to pre-industrial form about 20% for \"no climate policy\" to about 86%. Withdrawal of USA, China, Europe or India will decrease this probability to about 63, 67, 75 and 82%, respectively.\n\nThe Paris prospective birth cohort study: which design and who participates?\n\nPubMed\n\nClarisse, B; Nikasinovic, L; Poinsard, R; Just, J; Momas, I\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Paris prospective birth cohort study was implemented in 2003 to assess environmental/behavioural factors associated with respiratory and allergic disorder occurrence in early childhood. This paper describes the design and sociodemographic features of eligible/enrolled families. Full-term newborns without any medical problem at birth were recruited in five Paris maternity hospitals. They resided in the Paris area and had French speaking mothers. Sample size is at least 3500 infants, and children are followed-up until their sixth birthday. Data collection is based on regular medical and environmental self-administered questionnaires to parents. Information on dwellings is gathered by means of phone questionnaires, and standardized medical examinations are carried out at 18 months and 6 years. Exposure to traffic-related pollution is modelled. At inclusion, some information concerning refusals is gathered in order to describe sociodemographic features of participating families as compared with eligible children. 4115 (63%) out of the 6493 eligible infants are now participating in this study. Participation rate is higher in parents with a high SES (socioeconomic status), for French and European parents, and for > or =25-year-old mothers, but decreases with sibship size. Similar determinants are associated with the distribution of reasons for non-participation. The participation rate in the Paris study is comparable with other similar studies. Finally, giving detailed explanation of the study aims at inclusion, establishing regular mailed and phoned contacts with families, offering free complete medical examinations for the participant child and re-sent missing questionnaires are very important to improve participation at inclusion and during follow-up.\n\nThe Computerization of the National Library in Paris.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLerin, Christian; Bernard, Annick\n\n1986-01-01\n\nDescribes the organization and automation plan of the Bibliotheque Nationale (Paris, France) that was begun in 1981.

Adult knockout of parkin in the ventral midbrain of mice leads to an age-dependent loss of dopamine neurons that is dependent on the accumulation of parkin interacting substrate (PARIS), zinc finger protein 746 (ZNF746), and its transcriptional repression of PGC-1Î±. Here we show that adult knockout of parkin in mouse ventral midbrain leads to decreases in mitochondrial size, number, and protein markers consistent with a defect in mitochondrial biogenesis. This decrease in mitochondrial mass is prevented by short hairpin RNA knockdown of PARIS. PARIS overexpression in mouse ventral midbrain leads to decreases in mitochondrial number and protein markers and PGC-1Î±âdependent deficits in mitochondrial respiration. Taken together, these results suggest that parkin loss impairs mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to declining function of the mitochondrial pool and cell death.

By now, the vast majority of countries have submitted their intended actions (also known as Nationally Determined Contributions - NDCs). This begs the question what these amount to and whether they are in line with the agreement`s long-term temperature goal. A structured sensitivity analysis of the emissions implications of the Paris pledges has been carried out, showing that the ambiguity and imprecision of the NDCs leaves open a wide range of possible outcomes by 2030. This range has important implications for the feasibility and cost of pathways that attempt to limit warming to the temperature goals of the Agreement. We identify salient steps to reduce the overall uncertainty, and explore the minimum requirements that have to be met for integrated energy-economy-land models to still find options to stay within the temperature limits of the Paris Agreement. These requirements come under the form of near-term emissions reductions, and assumptions about the deployment of carbon-dioxide removal technologies in the second half of the century.\n\nInfant Mortality and Income in 4 World Cities: New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRodwin, Victor G.; Neuberg, Leland G.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nObjectives. We investigated the association between average income or deprivation and infant mortality rate across neighborhoods of 4 world cities. Methods. Using a maximum likelihood negative binomial regression model that controls for births, we analyzed data for 1988â1992 and 1993â1997. Results. In Manhattan, for both periods, we found an association (.05% significance level) between income and infant mortality. In Tokyo, for both periods, and in Paris and London for period 1, we found none (5% significance level). For period 2, the association just missed statistical significance for Paris, whereas for London it was significant (5% level). Conclusions. In stark contrast to Tokyo, Paris, and London, the association of income and infant mortality rate was strongly evident in Manhattan.

The first of these considers the demographic differences between households whose members lose money playing the lottery and/or engaging in pari-mutuel betting and those whose members do not lose money participating in such activities. The second assesses demographic differences among households whose members lose money playing the lottery and/or engaging in pari-mutuel betting. It was found that respondents living in money-losing households are slightly older, better off financially, more likely to be married or divorced, more likely to live in a state with at least one legal casino and more likely to live in the Northeast than respondents living in non-money-losing households. Among those living in money-losing households, the least wealthy and African American respondents are more likely to lose a higher proportion of their respective incomes purchasing lottery tickets and engaging in pari-mutuel betting than wealthier respondents and whites.\n\nUrban boundary-layer height determination from lidar measurements over the paris area.\n\nPubMed\n\nMenut, L; Flamant, C; Pelon, J; Flamant, P H\n\n1999-02-20\n\nThe Paris area is strongly urbanized and is exposed to atmospheric pollution events. To understand the chemical and physical processes that are taking place in this area it is necessary to describe correctly the atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) dynamics and the ABL height evolution. During the winter of 1994-1995, within the framework of the Etude de la Couche Limite AtmosphÃ©rique en AgglomÃ©ration Parisienne (ECLAP) experiment, the vertical structure of the ABL over Paris and its immediate suburbs was extensively documented by means of lidar measurements. We present methods suited for precise determination of the ABL structure's temporal evolution in a dynamic environment as complex as the Paris area. The purpose is to identify a method that can be used on a large set of lidar data. We compare commonly used methods that permit ABL height retrievals from backscatter lidar signals under different meteorological conditions. Incorrect tracking of the ABL depth's diurnal cycle caused by limitations in the methods is analyzed. The study uses four days of the ECLAP experiment characterized by different meteorological and synoptic conditions.\n\nChallenges for the geosciences after the Paris agreement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKnutti, R.; Sedlacek, J.; Rogelj, J.; Fische"
