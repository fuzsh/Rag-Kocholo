        "text": "Friday night’s game between Sportivo Ameliano and 12 de Octubre was full of action with goals and red cards, but it was a fan rather than anybody on the pitch that stole the show in stoppage time. A video clip of Silvio Sens, a former player and lifelong fan of the club, throwing a ball from the stands to disrupt a last gasp corner has gone viral. Paraguay Football Blog got in touch to learn more about this superfan who brightened up our weekend!\n\nSilvio was born and raised in Barrio Jara, a middle-class suburb of the capital Asunción and home to both Sportivo Ameliano and their arch rivals Tacuary. He grew up with the “V Azulada” playing in their youth teams and even the first team between 1984 and 1995. At the time they played in the lower divisions, and Silvio reminds me that in 1995 “we played a final against Club Atlántida who had Paulo Da Silva in their ranks at the time”.\n\nFast forward to last night’s game in May 2022 and Paulo Da Silva is now the most capped Paraguay National Team player ever and still playing aged 42. As fate would have it he was captaining Ameliano’s rivals while Silvio was in the stands with his group of fans that are always there, so much so they call themselves “Los de Siempre”. The game had been back and forth in the first half, ending 2-2 but on 54 minutes Ameliano were reduced to 10 men and with 15 minutes let on the clock they went down to just nine players. “We saw the board show that there were going to be seven extra minutes” Silvio retells his story to us on Saturday afternoon via WhatsApp, “our players were so tired, not just because of the two red cards but also because our right back, Victor Ayala, was injured with what I think was a dislocated shoulder”. It was a desperate moment and Silvio said that when the ball was cleared into the stands his first thought was to just “hold onto it to see what happened”.\n\nWhen he saw Alexis Rojas trotting over to take the corner, and that a ball had already been placed by the corner flag he got an idea. “At first I wanted to just throw the ball as close to him as possible…to try and shave some time off the clock”. But Silvio didn’t just get it close, he hit the ball spot on, how did he have such good aim?\n\n“We throw paper balls into the bin at work, you know during a bit of down time, and I don’t miss a lot” Silvio comments while laughing. “But if I had to, I’d throw myself down there from the stands if it means helping the team!”\n\nAnd that sums up Silvio Sens, a true superfan of Sportivo Ameliano who told us that reaching the Primera División for the first time was “like touching heaven”. He signs off our brief interview with a greeting to his new found fans across the world. “A big hello from a fanatical supporter of a very humble club here in Paraguay, a club de barrio that is now in first division, Sportivo Ameliano!”\n\nThe Copa América 2021 is finally upon us having been postponed from 2020, reduced from 12 teams to 10 and then rejected by its original hosts before finally ending up in four cities in Brazil. Paraguay find themselves in Group A alongside Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina and will play their games Goiânia, Brasília and Rio de Janeiro. Here we’ll preview the squad and their chances while also looking at some historical stats surrounding Paraguay in the Copa América against these opponents and in these cities (SPOILER ALERT: Goiânia doesn’t hold happy memories!).\n\nThe Squad\n\nParaguay confirmed a 28-man squad for the world’s longest-running national team tournament on Thursday with just four changes from the recent World Cup Qualifiers where they took on Uruguay and Brazil. Juan Escobar removed himself for personal reasons, there are rumours that the Cruz Azul defender was unhappy at being considered third choice by Berizzo but others have reported a pending legal case that he needs to resolve. Another defender Alexis Duarte missed out and will be doing a full preseason with Cerro Porteño. Finally the fourth goalkeeper Juan Espínola and Libertad’s Hugo Martínez were not considered.\n\nStrength in Defence\n\nDespite conceding six goals in their three home WCQs to date, this current crop do have strength at the back and have generally become more organized under Marcelo Bielsa’s former assistant. Gustavo Gómez is the captain and in the past two games against Luis Suárez and a rampant Brazil he showed the kind of form that has made him a hero in Palmeiras and one of South America’s leading centrebacks. Alongside him the Albirroja can field another one of Brazil’s leading defenders in Junior Alonso or Bundesliga & Premier League players in Omar Alderete and Fabián Balbuena. Such riches in the heart of the defence tempted Berizzo into playing three at the back against Brazil although we’re unlikely to see that kind of set up in the group stages where four out of the five sides qualify.\n\nMidfield Balance\n\nFurther up the field the cracks begin to appear in this side who began with a more expansive style that also saw them concede goals (notably 2-2 draws at home to Peru and Bolivia). As they have tried to become more solid in the middle with the Pika Lucena and Mathías Villasanti pairing that has worked so well at Cerro Porteño they have lost some of that creative spark. Finding the right balance in the middle has been difficult, many fans and journalists have been calling for the inclusion of Club América’s Richard Sánchez who is more of a box-to-box player. Gastón Giménez has started all six WCQs so far but other than his well-taken goal against Venezuela he has been shackled and unable to create much. A different option for Berizzo could be the talented Alejandro “Kaku” Romero.\n\nFalse strikers\n\nIn the hope to achieve mobility and pace on the counter attack with a more direct and fluid forward line there has been a lack of a traditional number 9 leading the line. Dario Lezcano was preferred in early games while Tonny Sanabria made one start against Bolivia but neither will be in Brazil. Ángel Romero has led the line valiantly in this month’s matches but all these uses of “False nines” doesn’t seem to have clicked. Both Gabriel Ávalos and Carlos González are on the bench and would offer a much more physical presence in attack and should be able to hold the ball up more with their back to goal. A wilcard option would be to throw the teenage sensation Julio Enciso into the mix, the 17-year-old is even younger than Roque Santa Cruz when he played the Copa América opener against Bolivia in 1999.\n\nExpectations\n\nPressure has been building recently with the team now four games without a win and seemingly struggling to find a style with the ball despite good signs of better organization. The opening game against Bolivia is a must win fixture to settle the nerves and will almost certainly ensure particpation in the knockout stages with four of the five sides qualifying. Nobody is expected much more than that from this Albirroja side in transition, moreso than results there is a desire for Berizzo to set up his side correctly from the start. It is telling that in his ten competitive games so far the Albirroja have only won the first half on three occassions (twice versus Argentina and Qatar). The tinkering, like playing Mathías Villasanti wide on the right against Brazil, has backfired so with a relatively long preparation and four guaranteed games we expect to see something more cohesive in possession.\n\nCopa América History\n\nParaguay will be playing their 175th* Copa América game on Monday night against Bolivia, a team they have faced ten times in this competition, winning seven and drawing twice. The only defeat came in Cochabamba in 1963 the year that Bolivia hosted and won the tournament. Their only previous meeting in a Copa América hosted in Brazil was the 1949 edition in Rio de Janeiro, the Albirroja ran out 7-0 victors in the São Januário with Jorge Duilio Benítez netting four times. To this day he is the only Paraguayan to score four in a single game for the Albirroja.\n\nThat said the game is in Goiânia where Paraguay’s only game was a 0-6 reverse to a Tele Santana’s rampant Brazil side in a 1980 friendly, they were blown away by Zico and Socrates that day. It will be their first game in Brasilia, while Rio de Janeiro has hosted the Albirroja on 32 occasions having won seven times and twice versus Uruguay.\n\nWe know Paraguay enjoy a draw, having tied three of their last four games and famously reaching the 2011 Copa América final with five consecutive drawn contests, but it isn’t a new phenomenon – their 44 draws is more than any other side in the history of the tournament!\n\nAgainst the other group rivals the recent record is rather concerning, in their last 18 games against the trio of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay they’ve only won once, that was the 3-0 victory over Chile in the first leg of the 1979 Final which was also the last time the Guaraní won the title. At this point I’m obliged to remind you all that Paraguay have NEVER beaten the Albiceleste in this competition, 25 games and counting.\n\nWe’ll have more stats and facts on Twitter and Guaraní Vision, and of course in match previews right here on this blog!\n\n*Assuming you include the random two qualifiers in 1966!\n\nThe Intermedia is upon us with a bumper season having expanded to 18 teams as last year’s tournament was canceled meaning no promotion, but they receive the two relegated teams from Primera. There will be three direct promotion spots this year, while one playoff place to take on the 9th placed side in the top division. For the champion there is a lucrative spot available in the 2022 Copa Sudamericana, the first time the APF have offered a continental spot to sides outside of the top flight.\n\nThroughout the week most of the clubs have been confirming their squads on social media which I’ve compiled here.\n\nSportivo Iteño based in the city Itá (the Guaraní word for stone) about 40 km from Asunción have been almost ever present in Intermedia, only missing out on one of the 23 seasons (in 2013 they were in Primera B). Their closest moment to reaching Primera was in 1998 when they finished runner-up losing the playoff final to Resistencia.\n\nResistencia SC are based in the Chacarita barrio in Asunción to the north of downtown that borders the Paraguay River, it is one of the most dangerous areas of the capital city with the stadium essentially inside a shantydown. Their stadium is famous for having a tree growing through one of the stands behind the goal.\n\nSome good players recruited this season like Wildo Alonso, Nicolas Caballero (who resorted to setting up a fast food street stand to pay the bills during 2020), Christian Ledesma a league winner in Chile and the most interesting Julian Benítez who has 91 goals in Primera putting him 10th on the all-time list.\n\nFernando de la Mora gets is name from one of the key players in Paraguay’s independence and is also the name of a city right next to Asunción. The Emiliano Ghezzi stadium is technically in the capital city, prior to the pandemic it was well known for hosting rock concerts as well as football matches.\n\nCurrent coach Hernán Acuña has a long association with the club and is well known for his work with young players in Paraguay, most notably he coached Miguel Almirón while managing Cerro Porteños youth sides.\n\nSportivo 2 de Mayo is based in the north-east of Paraguay right on the border with Brazil, in fact you can cross the main road to enter the neighbouring country. While it has a bad reputation as a hotbed of illicit activity the Río Parapití stadium was used for the 1999 Copa América and has a capacity for 25,000 one of the biggest stadiums outside of Greater Asunción.\n\nIn their squad they have incorporated Osmar Leguizamón who smashed 18 goals in 2016 with General Caballero in Primera. Their coach is Ariel Galeano who is just 23 years old.\n\nSportivo Trinidense are based in one of Asunción’s oldest areas and have been in Primera as recently as 2017, they are currently coached by Gabino Román who got River Plate promoted four years ago. They have a few decent players in the squad including Ernesto “Teto” Cristaldo an Olympic silver medallist in 2004, Wilson Pittoni who scored in the 2013 Copa Libertadores Final and Nery Cardozo a natural goalscorer who earned a move to Norway in his youth.\n\nIf you are in Asunción right now and want to watch regular football? You can get a season ticket at Trinidense for just 200,000 guaraníes ($32).\n\n3 de Febrero or to give you their full name Atlético 3 de Febrero de Ciudad del Este who are arguably the biggest side outside of Asunción and surrounds. The giant in the East have never finished in the bottom half of Intermedia and have spent several season at the top. César Llamas is still there ready to run down the wing, a veritable Ryan Giggs having been at the club for 13 years, playing one game for the national team back in 2012.\n\nRubio Ñu has traditionally been a lower division side but they fought it out in Primera having won Intermeida in 2008 under Chiqui Arce and had a reputation for producing good young players. Their current coach is Alejandro Da Silva who sepnt a long time at Cerro Porteño as a player.\n\nRonald Huth, winner of the youth Premier League with Liverpool (2007-08), will play behind midfielder Derlis Mereles who was at Benfica B last year.\n\nIndependiente de Campo Grande are based in what has become one of the most lucrative areas of Asunción, just off the principal road that runs from the airport through the CBD to the main artery that directs people to downtown. They have a history of producing good young players like Lorenzo Melgarejo and Sebastián Ferreira while helping Jordan Santacruz and Fidencio Oviedo develop.\n\nThey are coached by Pablo Caballero a much-loved and respected coach in the country, and boast some key veterans like goalkeeper Victor Centurión (champion with Olimpia, Guaraní and Deportivo Calí), Copa Libertadores finalist Derlis Orué and striker Ángel Orué who has won domestic titles with Libertad and Nacional.\n\nSportivo San Lorenzo were relegated from Primera last year, they are from one of the biggest cities in Paraguay located right next to the capital Asunción. Their sponsor Ochsi are based in the city a producer of sausages and hams, which explains the pig logo splashed on the front of their shirts!\n\nDeportivo Santaní have been to the highs of the Copa Sudamericana despite only being formed in 2009, they are based in San Estanislao some 150 km from Asunción.\n\nTheir start player is the striker Wilson Levia nicknamed Leivandowski after winning the league with Libertad in 2016 and 2017, he was linked with a move to the Bundesliga with Schalke as recently as 2020.\n\nTacuary FBC were once a stalwart of Primera and even qualified for the Copa Libertadores, but after their then eccentric owner Francisco Ocampo left the club in 2014 they have struggled both financially and on the pitch.\n\nIn 2019 they played in Primera B, achieving promotion by grabbing the runners up spot in the division. This will be their first season in Intermedia since 2015.\n\nGeneral Díaz are one of the oldest clubs in Paraguayan football, founded in 1917 in the city of Luque. They were relegated last season amid serious financial problems with players going unpaid for months. Their new coach is 34-year-old Víctor Ferreira who was playing for the Aguilas just a couple of years ago, he is best known for winning the league with Cerro Porteño in 2006 and 2009.\n\nFulgencio Yegros de Ñemby are from the city to the south of Asunción probalby best known for being the home of the Coca-Cola factory in the country. The etymology of the city’s name Ñemby is disputed but I prefer the version that suggests it is dervied from Ñe’e he’emby which means “sweet language” in reference to Guaraní.\n\nDeportivo Capiatá were a mainstay in Primera since their promotion in 2012 but will have to rebuild this season having been relegated in 2020. They are from the “Mythical City” in relation to the Museo Mitológico that documents some traditional guaraní mythology related to Tau & Kerana and their seven children Ao Ao, Teyú Yaguá, Mbói Tu’i, Moñái, Yasý Yateré, Kurupí and Luisón.\n\nAtyrá FC are from a town in the countryside that claims to be the cleanest city in the country, the pituresque place is up a hill about 60 km from Asunción and is certainly worth a visit.\n\nThis will be only their second season in the second division, having been promoted to the division in 2019.\n\nGeneral Caballero de Juan León Mallorquín are based in the far east of the country close to 3 de Febrero, like Atyrá this is just their second season having come up in 2019.\n\nNot much to add here, they don’t have any social media that I could find!\n\nSportivo Ameliano are based in one of the more affluent suburbs of Asunción, the stadium backs onto some very nice houses where the ball sometimes gets lost with an errant clearance. For the Dundee fans reading this my only visits to Ameliano was when Fabio Caballero (number 7 came down from heaven) was either playing or managing the side.\n\nThis will be their first season in Intermedia since the league’s restructuring in 1997 having knocked around the 3rd and 4th tier. They have picked up a very astute manger in Humberto Garcia who guided General Díaz to the Copa Sudamericana.\n\nGuaraní de Trinidad are making their debut in the Intermeida having been crowned champion of the UFI (Rural Federation) Nacional B back in 2019. They are based in Trinidad, Itapuá in the south of the country very close to Encarnación, the tiny city is most famous for a UNESCO heritage site related to Jesuit ruins."
