        "text": "Psychosocial problems in thalassemic adolescents and young adults\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nManoj Jain\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: With the availability of better treatment regimen, life span of thalassemic patients is increasing. Chronic nature of thalassemia and its intensive and demanding treatment result in significant psychologic burden on the patients and their families. A lot has been studied about beta-thalassemia major but little attention has been paid to the psychological aspect of this disease. Hence, the study was planned to analyse the psychosocial problems in thalassemic adolescents and young adults. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, conducted from January 2007 to March 2008 in thalassemic day-care centre of a tertiary care teaching hospital. Fifty four thalassemic children and controls above 9 years of age were enrolled. Psychosocial assessment done with assessment of Finer Psychopathology using ICMR Symptom checklist (ICMR task force, 1983. The prevalence of various problems was calculated and compared with controls. Studentâ²s t-test and Chi-square test were used for testing differences in variables. Results: Patients were divided into three groups - Group A (10-15 years, 30 patients; Group B (15-20 years, 18 patients, and Group C (20-25 years, 6 patients. In group A, behavior problems were common (12 patients -40% (P< 0.001, significant. In group B, mood disorders were common (8 patients, 44% (P< 0.001, significant. In group C, psychotic symptoms were common (3 patients, 50% (P< 0.05, significant. Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that psychosocial problems are more in thalassemic adolescents and young adults. Psychosocial aspects need to be addressed in the overall treatment of children with thalassemia.\n\nPredictors of anxiety and depression in Egyptian thalassemic patients: a single center study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYahia, Sohier; El-Hadidy, Mohamed Adel; El-Gilany, Abdel-Hady; Anwar, Rokiah; Darwish, Ahmad; Mansour, A K\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThalassemic patients are vulnerable to emotional and behavioral problems. Each patient age group exhibits problems unique to that stage of development, and although up to 80Â % of thalassemic patients are likely to have psychological disorders, e.g., anxiety and depression, predictors of these disorders remain poorly understood. The present study was designed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression in a sample of Egyptian thalassemic patients and to identify predictors of these psychiatric disorders. A case-control study was conducted in 218 thalassemic patients, with 244 healthy subjects as a control. All patients and control subjects were subjected to thorough evaluation of medical history and clinical examination, and examined by a psychiatrist using the clinician version of the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SCID-CV), hospital anxiety and depression scale and Coopersmith self-esteem inventory. Abnormal and borderline anxieties were reported by 36.7 and 20.6Â % of thalassemic patients, respectively, while abnormal and borderline depressions were reported by 32.1 and 16.1Â % of patients, respectively. Hospitalization, low self-esteem, diabetes mellitus and heart failure were independent predictors of anxiety. The independent predictors of depression were heart failure, hospitalization, diabetes mellitus, short stature and delayed puberty. Thalassemic patients were more vulnerable to anxiety and depression, indicating that screening and management for such psychiatric disorders should be considered in treating all such patients.\n\nCephalometric radiography in thalassemic patients\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPusaksrikit, S.; Hathirat, P.; Isarangkura, P.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nIn a normal population, the cephalometric radiographs of the face are divided into skeletal types, 1, 2, and 3, ie, those with straight, convex and concave profiles, respectively. Bone marrow hyperplasia caused by rapid red blood cell turnover in thalassemic patients results in changes of the bony structures, particularly in the face. This chapter reports on the facial skeletal profile in children with thalassemia in relation to the type of the disease and severity of anemia\n\nClinical evaluation of 413 Thalassemic patients\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKorosdari Gh.H\n\n2000-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Thalassemia is the most prevalent genetic disorder in Iran and around the world and these patients need regular careful care. The present study reports results of routine examination of patients visited Thalassemia clinic of Tehran. Data about clinical and laboratory examinations of 413 Thalassemic were extracted and analyzed. The prevalence of heart complications, diabetes, growth retardation, delayed puberty and primary and secondary amenorrhea was 9%, 8%, 21.3%, 3.1% and 6.3%, respectively. 44% didn't have secondary sex characteristics. Splenectomy had been done for 67.2% of cases. HBsAg, HBsAb and HBcAb were positive in 1.9%, 57.4% and 43%, respectively. We concluded that blood transfusion standards in this clinic was acceptable, whereas because of poor knowledge, iron chelating is unfavorable.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging signal reduction may precede volume loss in the pituitary gland of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemic patients\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHekmatnia, Ali; Rahmani, Ali Asghar; Adibi, Atoosa (Image Processing and Signal Research Center, Dept. of Radiology, Isfahan Univ. of Medical Sciences, Isfahan (Iran)); Radmard, Amir Reza (Dept. of Radiology, Shariati Hospital, Tehran Univ. of Medical Sciences, Tehran (Iran)); Khademi, Hooman (Shariati Hospital, Tehran Univ. of Medical Sciences, Tehran (Iran)), e-mail: radmard@ams.ac.ir\n\n2010-01-15\n\nBackground: Pituitary iron overload in patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia may lead to delayed puberty. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to estimate tissue iron concentration by detecting its paramagnetic effect and hypophyseal damage by measuring its dimensions indirectly. Purpose: To investigate the association of pituitary MRI findings and pubertal status in thalassemic patients as well as to demonstrate any priority in appearance of them. Material and Methods: Twenty-seven beta-thalassemic patients, aged 15-25 years, were divided into 13 with (group A) and 14 without hypogonadism (group B), matched by age, gender, duration of transfusion, and chelation therapy. Thirty-eight age- and sex-adjusted healthy control individuals were also included (group C). All participants underwent pituitary MRI using a 1.5T unit. Pituitary-to-fat signal intensity ratios (SIR) were calculated from coronal T2-weighted images. Estimated pituitary volumes were measured using pituitary height, width, and length on T1-weighted images. Results: The mean values of pituitary-to-fat SIRs were significantly lower in group A as compared with group B (P <0.001), and likewise group B had statistically lower values than group C (P=0.03). The pituitary height and volume were significantly decreased in group A compared to group B (P = 0.006 and P = 0.002, respectively), while these differences did not demonstrate statistically significance between groups B and C. Conclusion: Pituitary MRI findings such as signal intensity reduction and decrease in volume can be useful markers in estimating pituitary dysfunction in beta-thalassemic patients. Compared to healthy controls, lower values of pituitary-to-fat SIRs in thalassemic patients experiencing normal puberty, without marked decrease in volume, indicate that signal reduction may precede volume loss and could be expected first on MRI\n\nAlterations of thalassemic erythrocytes detected by wavelet entropy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKorol, A. M.; Rasia, R. J.; Rosso, O. A.\n\n2007-02-01\n\nA quantitative analysis of erythrocytes deformation under shear stress (the viscoelastic properties) observed on healthy donors as well as thalassemic patients are made by means of the normalized total wavelet entropy (NTWS). The results suggest that NTWS quantifier could be useful for characterizing pathological disturbances for the sake of clinical treatment.\n\nMolecular investigations of Î²-thalassemic children in Erbil governorate\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHasan, Ahmad N.; Al-Attar, Mustafa S.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe present work studies the molecular investigation of 40 thalassemic carriers using polymerase chain reaction. Forty thalassemic carriers who were registered and treated at Erbil thalassemic center and twenty apparently healthy children have been included in the present study. Ages of both groups ranged between 1-18 years. Four primers used to detect four different beta thalassemia mutations they were codon 8/9, codon 8, codon 41/42 and IVS-1-5. The two most common mutations detected among thalassemia group were Cd8/9 with 8 cases (20%) and Cd-8 with 6 cases (15%) followed by codon 41/42 with 4 cases (10%) which investigated and detected for the first time in Erbil governorate through the present study and finally IVS-1-5 with 3 cases (7.5%), while no any cases detected among control group.\n\nCan Homeopathy Bring Additional Benefits to Thalassemic Patients on Hydroxyurea Therapy? Encouraging Results of a Preliminary Study\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAntara Banerjee\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Several homeopathic remedies, namely, Pulsatilla Nigricans (30th potency, Ceanothus Americanus (both mother tincture and 6th potency and Ferrum Metallicum (30th potency selected as per similia principles were administered to 38 thalassemic patients receiving Hydroxyurea (HU therapy for a varying period of time. Levels of serum ferritin (SF, fetal hemoglobin (HbF, hemoglobin (Hb, platelet count (PC, mean corpuscular volume (MCV, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH, white blood cell (WBC count, bilirubin content, alanine amino transferase (ALT, aspartate amino transferase (AST and serum total protein content of patients were determined before and 3 months after administration of the homeopathic remedies in combination with HU to evaluate additional benefits, if any, derived by the homeopathic remedies, by comparing the data with those of 38 subjects receiving only HU therapy. Preliminary results indicated that there was a significant decrease in the SF and increase in HbF levels in the combined, treated subjects. Although the changes in other parameters were not so significant, there was a significant decrease in size of spleen in most patients with spleenomegaly and improvement in general health conditions along with an increased gap between transfusions in most patients receiving the combined homeopathic treatment. The homeopathic remedies being inexpensive and without any known side-effects seem to have great potentials in bringing additional benefits to thalassemic patients; particularly in the developing world where blood transfusions suffer from inadequate screening and fall short of the stringent safety standards followed in the developed countries. Further independent studies are encouraged.\n\nStudy of red blood cell alloimmunization in multitransfused thalassemic children of Jammu region\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAshu Dogra\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction: Thalassemia is one of the most common genetic disorder of hemoglobin synthesis in Jammu region. Although RBC transfusion is life saving for these patients, it may be associated with some complications like RBC alloimmunization. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of alloimmunization and the most common alloantibodies involved. Material and Methods: This was a descriptive study involving a total of 70 thalassemic patients in the age range of 2-17 years receiving regular blood transfusions, registered at SMGS Blood Bank, Jammu. Relevant clinical and laboratory data was collected with reference to age at the start of transfusions, total number of transfusions received and splenectomy status. Antibodies screening, antibody identification, and cross matching was done on allpatient samples included in the study, during the period between November 2009 and October 2010. Results: In this study, a total of six alloantibodies six patients (8.5% and one autoantibody (1.42% was detected. All identified alloantibodies belonged to Rh system (i.e. anti-E, in 3 patients (50%, anti D, in one patient (16.66% and Kell system (anti-K, in two patients (33.34%. Higher frequency of alloimmunization was found, with increase in number of transfusions and in those who received transfusions after 1 year of age. Alloimmunization was not significantly associated with gender and splenectomy status (P-value > 0.05. Conclusion: Red cell alloantibodies developed in 8.5% of thalassemic patients and 1.42% had autoantibodies. The most common alloantibodies identified were anti Rh system antibodies (anti-E and anti-D present in 50% and 16.66% of patients respectively. Alloimmunization is not an uncommon problem faced by blood banks and finding compatible units for regularly transfused thalassemic patients may become very difficult. In order to reduce alloimmunization, a policy for performing extended red cell phenotyping of these patients is\n\nShort-term Assessment of HSCT Effects on the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis in Pediatric Thalassemic Patients.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHamidieh, Amir Ali; Mohseni, Fariba; Behfar, Maryam; Hamidi, Zohreh; Alimoghaddam, Kamran; Pajouhi, Mohamad; Larijani, Bagher; Mohajeri-Tehrani, Mohammad-Reza; Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir\n\n2018-02-01\n\nBeta thalassemia major (BTM) and its treatment by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may have deleterious effects on the endocrine systems. We assessed endocrine complications of HSCT in pediatric patients for 3 months. In 20 (6 female) pediatric major thalassemic patients (mean age of 10.8 Â± 3.9 years old), prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), T4, T3, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), IGF-1, testosterone (in males) or estradiol (in females) were measured as a batch at the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center (EMRC) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) laboratories before HSCT and 1 and 3 months afterwards. The cosyntropin test for all and the clonidine test for short stature patients was conducted before HSCT. Before HSCT, delayed puberty and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was found in 10% and 20% of patients, respectively. GH deficiency, low IGF1 and short stature was found in 25%, 55% and 40% of patients, respectively. Hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism and panhypopituitarism was found in 15%, 10% and 15% of patients, respectively. Prevalence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, low IGF1, hypothyroidism and panhypopituitarism was found in 20%, 40%, 10% and 10% of patients after 3 months, respectively (delayed puberty and short stature prevalence do not change after 3 months). HSCT caused lower T3 and estradiol and higher TSH. Corticosteroid users (15) had higher GH and lower T3 and testosterone or estradiol. Ferritin had a significant (negative) correlation with (before) prolactin and a significant correlation with T3 and T4 after HSCT. Age and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) had no significant effect. Considering the small sample size and short duration of the study, it is difficult to reach any conclusion however it seems HSCT does not appear to have an overall positive or negative effect on prevalence of pituitary- hypothalamus axis disorders in pediatric thalassemic patients in 3 months.

Administration of antioxidants, is promising towards minimizing oxidative damage in both thalassemic and HSCT patients.Method: This was a prospective cross-sectional observational study. Patients as a part of institutional protocol were received Vitamin C (Vit C (all the patients received oral Vit C; 200 mg and 400 mg Vit C, if they were less or more than 20 kg respectively plus 10 mg/kg/day intravenous infusion of Vit C.We measured plasma Vit C and total antioxidant (TAs levels at four different time points; baseline, transplantation day (0, day +7 and day +14. We calculated mean and standard error for plasma levels of Vit C and TAs.Results: Fifthy patients enrolled in this study (mean age 7.97Â± 3.53. In all four time points, means of Vit C and TAs serum levels were under their reference values and their highest means were belong to baseline. Serum TAs and Vit C both depleted significantly from baseline to day 0 (P: 0.00 for both variables, then increased up to day +7 and it keeps rising till day +14 (P: 0.00 from day0 to day +7 and +14 for both variables. These changes were significant through the measurement time. There is also a significant correlation between baseline Vit C and baseline TAs (P: 0.11. This means the higher level of Vit C is correlated with higher level of TAs and vice versa.Conclusion: We did not observe any beneficial effects of administering Vit C in thalassemic patients undergoing HSCT in order to increase or prevent depletion of Vit C and TAs serum levels. This could be resolved by further investigations carrying out higher doses or longer duration and having a control group.\n\nAssociation of TNF-alpha (-308 A/G) and IFN-gamma (+874 A/T) gene polymorphisms in response to spontaneous and treatment induced viral clearance in HCV infected multitransfused thalassemic patients.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBiswas, Aritra; Gupta, Nabyendu; Gupta, Debanjali; Datta, Abira; Firdaus, Rushna; Chowdhury, Prosanto; Bhattacharyya, Maitreyee; Sadhukhan, Provash C\n\n2018-06-01\n\nMultitransfused thalassemic individuals are at high risk of developing transfusion transmitted Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The aim of the study was to correlate the effects of host cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms of TNF-Î± (-308 A/G) and IFN-Î³ (+874 A/T) in spontaneous or IFN induced treatment response in the HCV infected thalassemic individuals. A total of 427 HCV sero-reactive thalassemic individuals were processed for HCV viral genomic diversity and host gene polymorphisms analysis of TNF-Î± (-308 A/G) and IFN-Î³ (+874 A/T). Out of 427 HCV sero-reactive individuals, 69.09% were found to be HCV RNA positive with genotype 3 as the predominant infecting strain (94.29%). Study highlighted that, A allele was significantly associated with (pâ¯<â¯.05) spontaneous clearance of HCV infection and G allele was correlated with viral persistence at TNF-Î± (-308) gene polymorphism. Whereas in case of IFN-Î³ (+874) SNPs, A allele was significantly responsible (pâ¯<â¯.05) for spontaneous clearance than T allele. Our study also indicated that in relapsed cases, IFN-Î³ (+874) T allele is more responsible than A allele. Though no significant correlation was found at both TNF-Î± (-308) and IFN-Î³ (+874) gene polymorphism among SVR and relapsed thalassemic patients. A allele at both TNF-Î± (-308) and IFN-Î³ (+874) were strongly associated with spontaneous clearance among this population. But in case of SVR and relapsed cases no significant association was found. This cytokine gene polymorphisms pattern will help clinicians to take an informed decision about therapeutic management of HCV infected thalassemic individuals. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Methodology: A total of 31 thalassemic children were a part of the study. Cephalometric readings were recorded for the study and the control group. Results: Within the Group I stage, the anterior cranial base length was 68.40Â±2.93 mm, shorter when compared to the control group. In the Group II stage, the maxillary/mandibular angle was 31.58Â° for the case group and the mandibular length was shorter in comparison to the controls. In the Group III stage, the SNB angle was 76.42Â°, lesser than the control group. A relative maxillary prognathism of 9.88 mm and 12.85 mm was observed in thalassemic males and females respectively through the Wiley's analysis. Conclusion: The overall picture depicted a retruded position of the maxilla and a retrognathic mandible within the study group. A class II profile has also been observed among the study subjects.\n\nOxidative stress modulates heme synthesis and induces peroxiredoxin-2 as a novel cytoprotective response in Î²-thalassemic erythropoiesis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDe Franceschi, Lucia; Bertoldi, Mariarita; De Falco, Luigia; Santos Franco, Sara; Ronzoni, Luisa; Turrini, Franco; Colancecco, Alessandra; Camaschella, Clara; Cappellini, Maria Domenica; Iolascon, Achille\n\n2011-11-01\n\nÎ²-thalassemic syndromes are inherited red cell disorders characterized by severe ineffective erythropoiesis and increased levels of reactive oxygen species whose contribution to Î²-thalassemic anemia is only partially understood. We studied erythroid precursors from normal and Î²-thalassemic peripheral CD34(+) cells in two-phase liquid culture by proteomic, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses. We measured intracellular reactive oxygen species, heme levels and the activity of Î´-aminolevulinate-synthase-2. We exposed normal cells and K562 cells with silenced peroxiredoxin-2 to H(2)O(2) and generated a recombinant peroxiredoxin-2 for kinetic measurements in the presence of H(2)O(2) or hemin. In Î²-thalassemia the increased production of reactive oxygen species was associated with down-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 and biliverdin reductase and up-regulation of peroxiredoxin-2. In agreement with these observations in Î²-thalassemic cells we found decreased heme levels related to significantly reduced activity of the first enzyme of the heme pathway, Î´-aminolevulinate synthase-2 without differences in its expression. We demonstrated that the activity of recombinant Î´-aminolevulinate synthase-2 is inhibited by both reactive oxygen species and hemin as a protective mechanism in Î²-thalassemic cells. We then addressed the question of the protective role of peroxiredoxin-2 in erythropoiesis by exposing normal cells to oxidative stress and silencing peroxiredoxin-2 in human erythroleukemia K562 cells. We found that peroxiredoxin-2 expression is up-regulated in response to oxidative stress and required for K562 cells to survive oxidative stress. We then showed that peroxiredoxin-2 binds heme in erythroid precursors with high affinity, suggesting a possible multifunctional cytoprotective role of peroxiredoxin-2 in Î²-thalassemia. In Î²-thalassemic erythroid cells the reduction of Î´-aminolevulinate synthase-2 activity and the increased\n\nTo study the quality of life and its relation with socioeconomic status in thalassemic adolescents in a tertiary care center\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNavjot Kaur Grewal\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background and Objectives: A large number of children are afflicted by thalassemia in India which may significantly impact their quality of life (QOL; hence, we hypothesized that there exists a strong relationship between socioeconomic status and QOL. We thus designed this study to assess QOL in adolescents diagnosed with Î² thalassemia major and its association with socioeconomic status. Further, we also compared the QOL and socioeconomic status between thalassemic and nonthalassemic adolescents. Materials and Methods: We recruited 35 adolescents diagnosed with Î² thalassemia major and 35 nonthalassemics in the age group of 10-18 years who matched in age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Selected cases and their parents were administered using PedsQL 4.0 India/Hindi questionnaire to assess QOL and modified Kuppuswamy scale to assess socioeconomic status. Results: Almost half of the thalassemic adolescents, i.e., 51.4% had poor QOL, whereas 48.6% of adolescents in control group had high QOL. There was no statistically significant association between QOL and socioeconomic status in both groups. It was observed that the difference between QOL and socioeconomic class though not significant but was more pronounced in study group (P = 0.114 than control group (P = 0.594. The receiver operating characteristic curve for QOL parameters indicated that social domain was the major contributor to poor QOL in thalassemics. Conclusion: Our study showed that thalassemic adolescents had significantly poor QOL, social domain being the major contributor as compared to nonthalassemics. We propose that provision of subsidized organized care can negate the impact of poor socioeconomic status on QOL of thalassemics.\n\nThe experience of thalassemic adults with their treatment La experiencia de los talasÃ©micos adultos con su tratamiento A experiÃªncia dos talassÃªmicos adultos ao tratamento\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarcela Ganzella\n\n2011-08-01\n\nFull Text Available This study, based on medical anthropology and oral reports, analyzes the meanings attributed by thalassemic adults to their experiences with the treatment. Interviews were used to collect data, which were analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. Eleven young adults, six of whom were men, at different ages, with different educational levels and occupations participated in the study. The meanings are discussed through the theme \"the lives of patients with thalassemia in relation to their treatment\". This core meaning highlights the difference made in their identity by having the disease trait, the recognition of the importance of adhering to their treatment, the difficulties in maintaining their social functions, the patients' irregular treatment adherence and their justifications for non-adherence to their treatment. Thalassemic patients conform to their condition and employ a normalization strategy to control the disease and justify irregular treatment adherence.El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar los sentidos dados por los talasÃ©micos adultos a su experiencia con el tratamiento, con base en la antropologÃ­a mÃ©dica y en el mÃ©todo del relato oral. Para la recolecciÃ³n de datos usamos entrevistas y seguimos el anÃ¡lisis temÃ¡tico inductivo. Participaron once adultos jÃ³venes, seis del sexo masculino; con edades, niveles educacionales y profesiones, distintas. Los sentidos da la experiencia son presentados por el tema \"La vida del portador de talasemia con el tratamiento\". El tema destaca la identidad de ser diferente por: el trazo de la enfermedad, el reconocimiento de la importancia de la adhesiÃ³n al tratamiento, las dificultades en mantener sus funciones sociales y los episodios de irregularidad en la terapia y sus justificaciones. Aprendimos que los portadores estÃ¡n resignados con su condiciÃ³n y emplean la estrategia de normalizaciÃ³n para el control de la enfermedad y para justificar la irregularidad en el tratamiento\n\nThalassemic osteopathy: a new marker of bone deposition.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBaldini, M; Forti, S; Orsatti, A; Marcon, A; Ulivieri, F M; Airaghi, L; Zanaboni, L; Cappellini, M D\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOsteopathy represents a prominent cause of morbidity in patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM) and manifests as osteopenia/osteoporosis. Biochemical turnover markers (BTMs) are considered a useful, non-invasive tool for the clinical follow-up of osteoporotic patients; they can provide a dynamic view of the remodeling process and give information on the metabolic activity of bone tissue as well as on the pathogenesis of bone loss. The amino-terminal pro-peptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) is a recently introduced marker that is considered the most sensitive index of bone formation. Although demonstrated in several categories of patients with bone disease, there is little information on the clinical usefulness of this bone formation index in thalassemic patients. We evaluated the P1NP levels of 53 adult patients with b-thalassemia major (21 males and 32 females, mean age 34.5 Â± 5.7, range 22-46 years) and associated osteopathy. We investigated the correlation between P1NP and bone condition as examined by dual X-ray photon absorptiometry and with BTMs expressing bone resorption and bone mineralization (carboxyterminal collagen cross-linked (CTX) terminal regions of type I collagen and osteocalcin, respectively). P1NP serum levels were correlated with CTX levels (r=0.545, p<0.001); the results were unchanged when males and females, as well as osteoporotic and osteopenic subgroups, were considered separately. No correlation was demonstrated neither between OC and CTX (r=0.17, p=ns), nor between P1NP and OC levels (r=0.11, p=ns). No correlation was demonstrated among the P1NP/CTX ratio and age, OC or densitometric values and no difference was found in the same ratio between osteopenic (0.19 Â± 0.16) and osteoporotic (0.15 Â± 0.14) patients. Similar results were obtained for the OC/CTX ratio, as it was not correlated with age, P1NP or densitometric values.

There is probably an advantage in giving GTE with DFP when treating patients with iron overload.\n\nSix-day stability of erythrocyte and reticulocyte parameters in-vitro: a comparison of blood samples from healthy, iron-deficient, and thalassemic individuals.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSudmann-Day, Ã shild A; Piehler, Armin; Klingenberg, Olav; Urdal, Petter\n\n2015-05-01\n\nStability for up to 6 days' storage of erythrocyte and reticulocyte parameters in samples from iron-deficient and thalassemic individuals has not yet been reported. This lack of knowledge challenges evaluation of the full blood count in referral samples for hemoglobinopathy evaluation. We therefore hereby present such sample stability data. We included fresh (less than 4 hours old) blood samples from eight healthy, eight iron-deficient, and 11 thalassemic individuals. A full blood count, including reticulocyte parameters, was performed on a Sysmex XE-2100 once daily during a 6-day storage period at room temperature. For healthy individuals, we also studied stability of refrigerated samples and investigated analytical and biological variation. Hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte count, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were stable for 6 days in all diagnostic groups. Mean corpuscular volume increased less in samples from iron-deficient individuals while the number of reticulocytes increased more in samples from thalassemic, as compared to healthy individuals. Ret-He stability depended on its baseline value. Within-person biological variation in samples from healthy individuals was low both for erythrocyte parameters and for reticulocyte hemoglobin, while higher for reticulocyte counts. Results for hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte count, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin are reliable in hemoglobinopathy investigation of referred samples for up to 6 days. Storage time-dependent changes of other erythrocyte and reticulocyte parameters in blood samples from iron-deficient and thalassemic individuals differ from those of healthy individuals.\n\nPrevalence of anti HCV infection in patients with beta-thalassemia in Isfahan-Iran\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBehrooz Ataei\n\n2012-01-01\n\nConclusions: Our findings revealed that blood transfusion was the main risk factors for HCV infection among beta-thalassemic patients. Therefore, more blood donor screening programs and effective screening techniques are needed to prevent transmission of HCV infection among beta-thalassemic patients.\n\nFertility assessment in thalassemic men\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nShahla Ansari\n\n2017-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Male infertility in Î²-thalassemia patients is typically considered to be the consequence of iron deposition in the endocrine glands. Adult male patients with Î²-thalassemia, on regular blood transfusions, are prone to developing acquired hypogonadism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fertility indicators in male patients with Î²-thalassemia major and intermedia. In this study we evaluated testicular volume, semen parameters and serum FSH, LH, and Testosterone concentrations in 62 male patients in reproductive age, with major and intermedia thalassemia, at a tertiary care hospital in Tehran, Iran. The range of serum ferritin level in our patients was from 182 to 11053 ng/mL (mean 2067 ng/mL. The mean concentration of sperm was 61.04 million per milliliter. The mean volume of right and left testes was 11.4 cc and 11.7 cc, respectively. Those patients who had lower testicular volumes significantly had lower sperm concentration, lower percents of motile and also lower percents of normal morphologic sperms (P=0.04. The frequency of hypogonadism was significantly higher in patients whose testicular volume was lower (P=0.02. Hypogonadism and hypothyroidism were seen in 22.6% and 17.7% of patients, respectively. Patients with hypogonadism had significantly lower ejaculate volume, lower sperm concentration, lower percents of motile and progressively motile sperms and also lower percents of normal morphologic sperms (P=0.001. This study suggests that in thalassemic men, concentrations of serum testosterone, LH, FSH has significant correlation with sperm parameters and testicular volume.

The treatment, however, is very costly, particularly in the context of low and middle income countries, and no studies have been carried out to explore its economic justifiability. This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of HSCT compared with blood transfusions combined with iron chelating therapy (BT-ICT) for severe thalassemia in Thailand, and to investigate the affordability of HSCT using a budget impact analysis. A Markov model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes over the patients' lifetimes taking a societal perspective as recommended by Thailand's health technology assessment guidelines. All future costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per annum. Primary outcomes of interest were lifetime costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in Thai baht (THB) per QALY gained. Compared to BT-ICT, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increased with patient age from 80,700 to 183,000 THB per QALY gained for related HSCT and 209,000 to 953,000 THB per QALY gained for unrelated HSCT among patients aged 1 to 15 years (US$1= 34 THB). The governmental budget impact analysis showed that providing 200 related HSCT to patients aged 1 to 10 years, in accordance with the current infrastructure limitations, would initially require approximately 90 million additional THB per year. At a societal willingness to pay of 100,000 THB per QALY gained, related HSCT was likely to be a cost-effective and affordable treatment for young children with severe thalassemia in Thailand.\n\nPrevalence of growth hormone deficiency in adult polytransfused Î²-thalassemia patients and correlation with transfusional and chelation parameters.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPoggi, M; Pascucci, C; Monti, S; Pugliese, P; Lauri, C; Amodeo, G; Girelli, G; Toscano, V\n\n2010-09-01\n\nDysfunction of GH-IGF-I axis has been described in many patients affected by Î²-thalassemia major (TM), especially in children and in adolescents. Recent studies have demonstrated the necessity to evaluate adult patients affected by TM to establish the presence of this alteration which could be relevant in the pathogenesis of cardiac and bone disease, frequently present in this hematological condition. The pathogenesis of this alteration, correlated in the past with iron overload, is not yet completely understood. The aim of this paper is to evaluate GH-IGF-I axis in a group of adult polytransfused Î²-thalassemic patients (TM) and to correlate the results with transfusional and chelation parameters. We performed an arginine plus GHRH stimulation test in 28 adult TM patients. Ferritin, IGF-I, liver enzymes, and liver iron concentration, assessed by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) susceptometer were also determined. Moreover, in each patient we evaluated the bone status by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry study. We found the presence of GH deficit in 9 patients (32.1%). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the value of ferritin, liver enzymes, and liver iron concentration, assessed by SQUID. The group affected by GH deficit showed a worse bone profile. This study confirms the necessity to screen the status of GH/IGF-I axis in this group of patients, even in adult age. The presence of GH deficiency does not seem to be correlated with the efficacy parameters of transfusional and chelation therapy. Other mechanisms, additional to iron overload, could therefore play a role in the pathogenesis of this clinical condition. The presence of GH deficit seems to be very important on clinical aspects, like bone disease, that are crucial for quality of life in these patients.\n\nDiscrimination indices as screening tests for beta-thalassemic trait.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNtaios, George; Chatzinikolaou, Anastasia; Saouli, Zoi; Girtovitis, Fotios; Tsapanidou, Maria; Kaiafa, Georgia; Kontoninas, Zisis; Nikolaidou, Androula; Savopoulos, Christos; Pidonia, Ifigenia; Alexiou-Daniel, Stiliani\n\n2007-07-01\n\nThe two most frequent microcytic anemias are beta-thalassemic trait (beta-TT) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Several discrimination indices have been proposed to distinguish between these two conditions. These indices are derived from several simple red blood cell indices, like red blood cell (RBC) count, mean cell volume, and RBC distribution width (RDW), as these are provided by electronic cell counters. The purpose of the study is to examine the diagnostic accuracy of six discrimination indices in the differentiation between IDA and beta-TT. The six discrimination indices that were examined were as follows: Mentzer Index (MI), Green & King Index (G&K), RDW Index (RDWI), England & Fraser Index (E&F), RDW, and RBC count. We calculated these indices on 373 patients (205 men, 168 women) with beta-TT and 120 patients (50 men, 70 women) with IDA, as well as their sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative prognostic value, efficiency, and Youden's index (YI). G&K shows the highest reliability, followed by E&F, RBC count, MI, and RDWI. On the contrary, RDW completely failed to differentiate between IDA and beta-TT. G&K proved to be the most reliable index as it had the highest sensitivity (75.06%), efficiency (80.12%), and YI (70.86%) for the detection of beta-TT. These six discrimination indices cannot be relied on for a safe differential diagnosis between beta-TT and IDA. They do have high specificity, but their sensitivity for the detection of beta-TT is not satisfactory. Consequently, they cannot be used neither as a screening tool for beta-TT because they could result in a significant number of false negative results.\n\nTherapeutic hemoglobin levels after gene transfer in Î²-thalassemia mice and in hematopoietic cells of Î²-thalassemia and sickle cells disease patients.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLaura Breda\n\nFull Text Available Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the feasibility of treating Î²-thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD by lentiviral-mediated transfer of the human Î²-globin gene. However, previous studies have not addressed whether the ability of lentiviral vectors to increase hemoglobin synthesis might vary in different patients.We generated lentiviral vectors carrying the human Î²-globin gene with and without an ankyrin insulator and compared their ability to induce hemoglobin synthesis in vitro and in thalassemic mice. We found that insertion of an ankyrin insulator leads to higher, potentially therapeutic levels of human Î²-globin through a novel mechanism that links the rate of transcription of the transgenic Î²-globin mRNA during erythroid differentiation with polysomal binding and efficient translation, as reported here for the first time. We also established a preclinical assay to test the ability of this novel vector to synthesize adult hemoglobin in erythroid precursors and in CD34(+ cells isolated from patients affected by Î²-thalassemia and SCD. Among the thalassemic patients, we identified a subset of specimens in which hemoglobin production can be achieved using fewer copies of the vector integrated than in others. In SCD specimens the treatment with AnkT9W ameliorates erythropoiesis by increasing adult hemoglobin (Hb A and concurrently reducing the sickling tetramer (Hb S.Our results suggest two major findings. First, we discovered that for the purpose of expressing the Î²-globin gene the ankyrin element is particularly suitable. Second, our analysis of a large group of specimens from Î²-thalassemic and SCD patients indicates that clinical trials could benefit from a simple test to predict the relationship between the number of vector copies integrated and the total amount of hemoglobin produced in the erythroid cells of prospective patients. This approach would provide vital information to select the best candidates for these\n\nLiver, bone marrow, pancreas and pituitary gland iron overload in young and adult thalassemic patients: a T2 relaxometry study\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nArgyropoulou, Maria I.; Astrakas, Loukas; Metafratzi, Zafiria; Efremidis, Stavros C.; Kiortsis, Dimitrios N.; Chalissos, Nikolaos\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThirty-seven patients with Î²-thalassemia major, including 14 adolescents (15.2 Â± 3.0 years) and 23 adults (26.4 Â± 6.9 years), were studied. T2 relaxation time (T2) of the liver, bone marrow, pancreas and pituitary gland was measured in a 1.5-Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) imager, using a multiecho spin-echo sequence (TR/TE 2,000/20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160 ms). Pituitary gland height was evaluated in a midline sagittal scan of a spin-echo sequence (TR/TE, 500/20 ms). The T2 of the pituitary gland was higher in adolescents (59.4 Â± 15 ms) than in adults (45.3 Â± 10.4 ms), P < 0.05. The T2 of the pancreas was lower in adolescents (43.6 Â± 10.3 ms) than in adults (54.4 Â± 10.4 ms). No difference among groups was found in the T2 of the liver and bone marrow. There was no significant correlation of the T2 among the liver, pancreas, pituitary gland and bone marrow. There was no significant correlation between serum ferritin and T2 of the liver, pancreas and bone marrow. Pituitary T2 showed a significant correlation with pituitary gland height (adolescents: R = 0.63, adults: R = 0.62, P < 0.05) and serum ferritin (adolescents: R = -0.60, adults: R = -0.50, P < 0.05). In conclusion, iron overload evaluated by T2 is organ specific. After adolescence, age-related T2 changes are predominantly associated with pituitary siderosis and fatty degeneration of the pancreas. Pituitary size decreases with progressing siderosis.

The aim of this prospective monocentric pilot study was to investigate the effects of a dietary supplement with vitamin K2 (50 mcg menaquinone-7) and vitamin D (5 mcg calcitriol) on the patients with TOSP. Twenty children (12 girls, 8 boys; age varied from 3 to 18 y) with Î² TM, who underwent regular blood transfusion and iron chelation therapy, were enrolled in this study and investigated at the initial, sixth, and 12th month of the treatment. We detected a significant improvement in the bone mineral density and Z-score at the lumbar spine area of the patients at the sixth and 12th month of the treatment, especially in the prepubertal group. We also found a decrease in the ratio of undercarboxylated osteocalcin to carboxylated osteocalcin, however, this was not found to be significant. Although the natural course of TOSP is worsening or at least stabilizing, our pilot study demonstrated that vitamin K2 and calcitriol combination clearly has a positive effect on the bone mineral density of the children with TM during a 1-year period. Supplementation of menaquinone-7 instead of drugs is an augmented physiological intake and seems a beneficial alternative for the treatment of TOSP. Further studies on a large number of participants are necessary to highlight the effect of vitamin K2 on TOSP.\n\nSpontaneous fertility in a male thalassemic patient after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNicoletta Iacovidou\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Patients with thalassemia major who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation are at increased risk of gonadal insufficiency and reduced fertility due to the toxicity of both the transfusional iron overload and the gonadotoxic effects of drugs used in the conditioning regimen. We present a case of an ex-thalassemic patient with spontaneous recovery of spermatogenesis that fathered a healthy, term male neonate. Maternal hemoglobin electrophoresis was within normal limits. At the age of 9.5 years the patient underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation. The conditioning therapy included busulfan (16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg. No irradiation was administered. Thirty-two days after the hematopoietic cell transplantation the patient developed acute graft-versus-host disease needing long-term treatment with methylprednisolone, cyclosporine and immunoglobulin. Although consecutive semen analyses after the hematopoietic cell transplantation revealed azoospermia, the last semen analysis before conception, at the age of 33 years, was improved and normal follicle stimulating hormone (FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH and testosterone (Te levels were detected. The current pregnancy was the result of physical conception. In this case, it seems that thalassemia major along with the respective treatment prior to- and posthematopoietic cell transplantation did not irreparably impair spermatogenesis, probably due to the pre-pubertal time frame they were implemented.

Study Design: A cross-sectional multi-centre survey. Place and Duration of Study: Karachi, Lahore and Quetta Centres of Fatimid Foundation, from October 2009 to October 2010. Methodology: An indigenously developed Qualifty of Life (QoL) questionnaire modified from SF-36 questionnaire was administered to 101 transfusion dependent subjects suffering from thalassemia major. Variables were analyzed using SPSS version 15 for descriptive statistics. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 10.5 years ranging from 6 - 21 years. Less than one third of the patients felt that their health was slightly worse as compared to last year. Forty five (44%) of the patients felt loneliness due to their disease. Parents of 36 (35.6%) of the children at times did not allow their children to play because of their disease. Twenty eight (27.7%) stated difficulty in mingling with children of their age. Seventy one (70.3%) of the patients reported that at some or all times they were worried about their future life and career while 70 (69.3%) admitted being taken extra care of by their friends and 56 (55.4%) by their teachers. Conclusion: The quality of life of surveyed thalassemic patients was immensely affected. Having physical impairments, social stresses, financial burdens and problems with their education and career make them very much vulnerable to psychological trauma very early in their life. All of this creates a hindrance in their way of developing into autonomous functioning adults.

Trivedi\n\n2014-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Thalassemia is a genetic disease having 3-7% carrier rate in Indians. It is transfusion dependent anemia having high risk of iron overloading. A clinical symptom of iron overload becomes detectable in second decade causing progressive liver, heart and endocrine glands damage. There is a need to assess iron overload in thalassemics below 5 years of age to protect them from complications at later age of life. Aims and objectives: Present study was undertaken to estimate serum iron status and evaluate serum transferrin saturation in both homozygous & heterozygous form of thalassemia as an index of iron overload among children of one to five years of age. Materials and Methods: Clinically diagnosed thirty cases of Î² thalassemia major & thirty cases of Î² thalassemia minor having severe anemia, hepatospleenomegaly and between 1 year to 5 years of age were included in study group and same age matched healthy controls were included in the study. RBC indices and HbA, HbA2 and HbF were estimated along with serum iron & serum Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC and serum transferrin levels. Results: Significant difference was observed in hemoglobin levels between control and both beta thalassemia groups. Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH values were reduced. Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed the elevated levels of HbF and HbA2 in both beta thalassemia groups. Among serum iron parameters, serum iron, TIBC and transferrin saturation were elevated whereas serum transferrin levels were low in thalassemia major in children below 5 years of age. Conclusion: Although clinical symptoms of iron overload have been absent in thalassemic children below five years of age, biochemical iron overloading has started at much lower age which is of great concern.\n\nCorrelation between T2* cardiovascular magnetic resonance with left ventricular function and mass in adolescent and adult major thalassemia patients with iron overload.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDjer, Mulyadi M; Anggriawan, Shirley L; Gatot, Djajadiman; Amalia, Pustika; Sastroasmoro, Sudigdo; Widjaja, Patricia\n\n2013-10-01\n\nto assess for a correlation between T2*CMR with LV function and mass in thalassemic patients with iron overload. a cross-sectional study on thalassemic patients was conducted between July and September 2010 at Cipto Mangunkusumo and Premier Hospitals, Jakarta, Indonesia. Clinical examinations, review of medical charts, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and T2*CMR were performed. Cardiac siderosis was measured by T2*CMR conduction time. Left ventricle diastolic and systolic functions, as well as LV mass index were measured using echocardiography. Correlations between T2*CMR and echocardiography findings, as well as serum ferritin were determined using Pearson's and Spearman's tests. thirty patients aged 13-41 years were enrolled, of whom two-thirds had -thalassemia major and one-third had HbE/-thalassemia. Diastolic dysfunction was identified in 8 patients, whereas systolic function was normal in all patients. Increased LV mass index was found in 3 patients. T2*CMR conduction times ranged from 8.98 to 55.04 ms and a value below 20 ms was demonstrated in 14 patients. There was a statistically significant moderate positive correlation of T2*CMR conduction time with E/A ratio (r = 0.471, P = 0.009), but no correlation was found with LV mass index (r=0.097, P=0.608). A moderate negative correlation was found between T2*CMR and serum ferritin (r = -0.514, P = 0.004), while a moderate negative correlation was found between serum ferritin and E/A ratio (r = -0.425, P = 0.019). T2*CMR myocardial conduction time has a moderate positive correlation with diastolic function, moderate negative correlation with serum ferritin, but not with LV mass index and systolic function.\n\nPituitary gland height evaluated by MR in patients with Î²-thalassemia major: a marker of pituitary gland function\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nArgyropoulou, M.I.; Metafratzi, Z.; Efremidis, S.C.; Kiortsis, D.N.; Bitsis, S.; Tsatoulis, A.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIn transfusion-dependent Î²-thalassemia major, increased iron deposition in the pituitary gland has a cytotoxic effect leading mainly to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

The reproductive and sexual health issues concerning persons affected by thalassemia major are complex. The study was planned to investigate the psychological attitudes and expectations in a group of thalassemic pregnant women attending hospital for regular blood transfusion. Methods. The study included 20 consecutive thalassemic patients and a control group of 42 healthy pregnant volunteers. We evaluated the personality structure by Rorschach's test and the presence of psychic symptoms by SCL-90-R and STAI. Results. Narcissism and sexual traumas are significantly higher in thalassemic women with respects to the control group. Also the percent of anxiety and depression observed with the SCL-90-R was significantly higher than in control group. The score observed with the STAI shows that the state of anxiety changed significantly between thalassemic pregnant women and the control group, even though the scores values arenât pathologic in neither group. Conclusions. This study addresses the need for developing, implementing and evaluating proper psychological support for thalassemic pregnant patients. The limit of this study is to analyze just thalassemic women because it doesnât consider other pathologies; so the results canât be extended to other pathologies different from thalassemic. Moreover, psychological screening and support prior to, during and following pregnancy would be indicated. Since not there are psychological studies in literature on the pregnancy in the thalassemic patients, the evaluation of the effects of pregnancy on the thalassemic disease will be the aim of future psychological investigations.\n\nHearing status of thalassemic patients treated with dessfroxamin\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMajid Ashrafi\n\n2011-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Major beta thalassemia is the most common inherited anemia with high prevalence in Iran and hearing loss is one of its side effects. The present study aimed to determine the hearing status of patients with major thalassemia and its relationship with serum ferritin level, period of blood transfusion and Dessfroxamin administration.Methods: This descriptive-analytic study was performed on 80 thalassemia major patients (36 Male and 44 Female aged 4-32 (14.2 Â±2.3 who were referred to Bou Ali Hospital for two years. The studied variables include age, gender, serum ferritin level, amount and duration of Desferal injection and hearing level. All subjects went under evaluation for their otologic and audiometric status. The collected data were analyzed using t-test and ANOVA with SPSS software.Results: The findings of the study indicated that 38 patients (47% had entirely hearing loss. Among these 38 patients, 17 patients had sensory neural type f hearing loss 12 patients had conductive and 7 patients had mixed type of hearing problems. The results showed a significant relationship (p<0.05 between hearing loss and serum ferritin level and the dosage and duration of Desferal administration. Conclusion: Hearing impairment may develop with increasing dosage of Dessfroxamin. Periodic follow up and physical examination is recommended to prevent hearing impairment in major thalassemia.\n\nMorphometric analysis of erythrocytes from patients with thalassemia using tomographic diffractive microscopy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLin, Yang-Hsien; Huang, Shin-Shyang; Wu, Shang-Ju; Sung, Kung-Bin\n\n2017-11-01\n\nComplete blood count is the most common test to detect anemia, but it is unable to obtain the abnormal shape of erythrocytes, which highly correlates with the hematologic function. Tomographic diffractive microscopy (TDM) is an emerging technique capable of quantifying three-dimensional (3-D) refractive index (RI) distributions of erythrocytes without labeling. TDM was used to characterize optical and morphological properties of 172 erythrocytes from healthy volunteers and 419 erythrocytes from thalassemic patients. To efficiently extract and analyze the properties of erythrocytes, we developed an adaptive region-growing method for automatically delineating erythrocytes from 3-D RI maps. The thalassemic erythrocytes not only contained lower hemoglobin content but also showed doughnut shape and significantly lower volume, surface area, effective radius, and average thickness. A multi-indices prediction model achieved perfect accuracy of diagnosing thalassemia using four features, including the optical volume, surface-area-to-volume ratio, sphericity index, and surface area. The results demonstrate the ability of TDM to provide quantitative, hematologic measurements and to assess morphological features of erythrocytes to distinguish healthy and thalassemic erythrocytes.\n\nPathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis in patients affected by Î²-thalassemia major and sickle cell anaemia post allogenic bone marrow transplant.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMartino, F; Di Mauro, R; Paciaroni, K; Gaziev, J; Alfieri, C; Greco, L; Floris, R; Di Girolamo, S; Di Girolamo, M\n\n2018-03-01\n\nSickle cell anemia (SCA) and Î² -thalassemia major are well-recognized beta-globin gene disorders of red blood cells associated to mortality and morbidity included bone morbidities due to ineffective erythropoiesis and bone marrow expansion, which affect every part of the skeleton. While there are an abundance of described disease manifestations of the head and neck, the manner of paranasal sinuses involvement and its relations to Î²-thalassemia and SCA process was not studied yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate a possible increased risk of rhinosinusitis and the real pathogenetic mechanism of it, comparing these two hematological diseases using msCT, gold standard for paranasal sinuses evaluation. A retrospective analysis of 90 patients affected by Î²-thalassemia major or SCA (respectively 59 and 31) underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and 44 control subjects was performed. Both patient categories and control group have been subjected to hematological and radiological evaluation using 64-multidetector-row CT scanner without contrast injection. Statistical analysis reveals that patients of the two study groups exhibit a significantly increased risk of sinusitis in comparison with the normal controls (RR: 3.55 for Î²-thalassemic pediatric subjects; RR: 3.35 for SCA pediatric subjects). A significant difference (pâ¯<â¯0,5) was found between the Î² -thalassemic patients on the one side, and SCA and control group on the other side, with regard to the evaluation of the typical anatomic alteration of maxillary sinus: Î²-thalassemic children had significant increase in the bone thickness of anterior and lateral sinus walls and significant reduction in volume and density compared to SCA patients and control group, with normal conditions of these parameters. In these hematological patients, there is an increased incidence of sinonasal infections due their therapy-induced immunosuppression post transplantation.

This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of intracerebral calcifications in patients with thalassemia with and without hypoparathyroidism. Methods: 47 beta-thalassemia patients with hypoparathyroidism underwent a brain CT scan to investigate the presence and extent of intracerebral calcification. 30 age- and sex-matched beta-thalassemic patients with normal parathyroid function who had undergone brain CT for headache, or some other minor neurologic problems were also enrolled in the study serving as controls. The amount of intracerebral calcification, hematologic parameters, and some clinical findings were compared between both groups. Results: Intracerebral calcification was present in 54.2% of beta-thalassemia patients with hypoparathyroidism. The most frequent sites of calcification were basal ganglia, and frontoparietal areas of the brain. Thalami, internal capsule, cerebellum and posterior fossa were other less frequently calcified regions of the brain. In contrast, there was no evidence of intracerebral calcifications in the 30 thalassemic patients with normal parathyroid function. There was not a statistically significant difference between serum ferritin concentrations in thalassemia patient with hypoparathyroidism and those with normal parathyroid function (2781 vs. 2178, P > 0.05). Conclusion: Intracranial calcification is a common finding in thalassemia patients with hypoparathyroidism, it can be extensive and involves most regions of the brain.\n\nHypoparathyroidism and intracerebral calcification in patients with beta-thalassemia major\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKarimi, M.; Rasekhi, A.R.; Rasekh, M.; Nabavizadeh, S.A.; Assadsangabi, R.; Amirhakimi, G.H.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground: Hypoparathyroidism is one of the most important endocrine complications of thalassemia major.

To identify the specific site of oxidative damage, changes in lipid fluidity at different regions in LDL and HDL particle were investigated using two fluorescence probes and two ESR spin probes. The magnitude of increased lipid fluidity in thalassemic lipoproteins was dependent on the location of the probes. In hydrophobic region, the rotational correlation times for 16-doxyl stearic acid and DPH anisotropy were markedly changed in LDL and HDL of the patients. In the surface region, there was only a slight change in the order parameter (S) for 5-doxyl stearic acid and TMA-DPH anisotropy. Lipid fluidity at the core of LDL and HDL showed good correlation with oxidative stress markers, the ratio of CL/CO, and the level of Î±-tocopherol, suggesting that hydrophobic region of thalassemic lipoprotein was a target site for oxidative damage\n\nAffective control and life satisfaction in thalassemics\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCarmela Mento\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background. Thalassemia is a chronic disease that can lead to an impact on psychological functioning and social behavior of patients. However, still little is known about the specific psychological aspects of the disease, such as the degree of tension, life satisfaction and affective control, especially in adult patients. Aim. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether patients with thalassemia have specific psychological pattern relating to the dimensions of tension, satisfaction and quality of life, management of affection. Method. We evaluated 31 patients with thalassemia major and intermedia (19 women and 12 men aged between 18 and 50 years (M = 34 + 16, belonging to the Complex Unit of Medical Genetics. For the evaluation were used the Profile of Mood States (POMS, the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q and the Rorschach test. Results. The findings show an inverse relationship between the levels of self-reported tension and the affective control indicators at Rorschach. Life satisfaction, instead, seems to vary according to the severity of the disease - major vs. intermediate - and the type of therapy. Conclusions. An understanding of the psychological mechanisms involved in thalassemia, both self-reported and projective, can contribute to a wider patient takeover, by considering the subjective aspects related to the psychological and socioemotional well-being, fundamental in the care compliance.\n\nFrequency of Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HFE) Gene Mutations in Egyptian Beta Thalassemia Patients and its Relation to Iron Overload.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEnein, Azza Aboul; El Dessouky, Nermine A; Mohamed, Khalda S; Botros, Shahira K A; Abd El Gawad, Mona F; Hamdy, Mona; Dyaa, Nehal\n\n2016-06-15\n\nThis study aimed to detect the most common HFE gene mutations (C282Y, H63D, and S56C) in Egyptian beta thalassemia major patients and its relation to their iron status. The study included 50 beta thalassemia major patients and 30 age and sex matched healthy persons as a control group. Serum ferritin, serum iron and TIBC level were measured. Detection of the three HFE gene mutations (C282Y, H63D and S65C) was done by PCR-RFLP analysis. Confirmation of positive cases for the mutations was done by sequencing. Neither homozygote nor carrier status for the C282Y or S65C alleles was found. The H63D heterozygous state was detected in 5/50 (10%) thalassemic patients and in 1/30 (3.3%) controls with no statistically significant difference between patients and control groups (p = 0.22). Significantly higher levels of the serum ferritin and serum iron in patients with this mutation (p = 001). Our results suggest that there is an association between H63D mutation and the severity of iron overload in thalassemic patients.\n\nThe New Self-Inactivating Lentiviral Vector for Thalassemia Gene Therapy Combining Two HPFH Activating Elements Corrects Human Thalassemic Hematopoietic Stem Cells\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPapanikolaou, Eleni; Georgomanoli, Maria; Stamateris, Evangelos; Panetsos, Fottes; Karagiorga, Markisia; Tsaftaridis, Panagiotis; Graphakos, Stelios\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbstract To address how low titer, variable expression, and gene silencing affect gene therapy vectors for hemoglobinopathies, in a previous study we successfully used the HPFH (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin)-2 enhancer in a series of oncoretroviral vectors. On the basis of these data, we generated a novel insulated self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector, termed GGHI, carrying the AÎ³-globin gene with the â117 HPFH point mutation and the HPFH-2 enhancer and exhibiting a pancellular pattern of AÎ³-globin gene expression in MEL-585 clones. To assess the eventual clinical feasibility of this vector, GGHI was tested on CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from nonmobilized peripheral blood or bone marrow from 20 patients with Î²-thalassemia. Our results show that GGHI increased the production of Î³-globin by 32.9% as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (p=0.001), with a mean vector copy number per cell of 1.1 and a mean transduction efficiency of 40.3%. Transduced populations also exhibited a lower rate of apoptosis and resulted in improvement of erythropoiesis with a higher percentage of orthochromatic erythroblasts. This is the first report of a locus control region (LCR)-free SIN insulated lentiviral vector that can be used to efficiently produce the anticipated therapeutic levels of Î³-globin protein in the erythroid progeny of primary human thalassemic hematopoietic stem cells in vitro.

Sixteen thalassemic patients with their sex- and age-matched controls were recruited into the study, 12 with thalassemia major, and 4 with thalassemia intermedia. Both the thalassemia patients and control subjects suffered from back pain, which was subjective rather than measured/pain scored. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the lumbar spine, and 11 of the cases and 8 controls had lumbar spine radiographs. Each lumbar disc was scored for radiographic appearances and MR features of disc degeneration and disc protrusion. Proportion values for these parameters and median scores were derived at each disc level, and were analyzed and compared. There was a statistically-significant difference between proportion values of cases and controls for the MR features (P value=0.01, n=16) and the radiographic features (P value=0.01, n=11 cases, n=8 controls) of disc degeneration. The median disc level scores for the thalassemic group were uniformly high across all lumbar discs, and at all levels except at L 4/5. The control group conversely demonstrated a predilection for disc degeneration at L4/5 level. The distribution of lumbar disc degeneration in thalassemic patients with back pain is more extensive, severe and multi-level in nature compared to matched controls, and disc degeneration should be considered as a significant cause of back pain in this population group.

However, the prolonged survival of these patients leads to the development of other health problems including degenerative diseases such as arthropathies, which require further attention since they have a significant impact on the quality of life. In the current case report, we present a 45-year-old white man with Ã-thalassemia complaining of non-traumatic pain and restriction in the range of motion of both knees. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI revealed a tear in the medial meniscus of the left knee as well as iron deposits in both knees. Histological findings confirmed the presence of hemosiderin in both joints. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of macroscopically documented iron deposits in the knee joints of a patient with Ã-thalassemia using MRI.\n\nCure of murine thalassemia by bone marrow transplantation without eradication of endogenous stem cells\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWagemaker, G.; Visser, T.P.; van Bekkum, D.W.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nalpha-Thalassemic heterozygous (Hbath/+) mice were used to investigate the possible selective advantage of transplanted normal (+/+) hemopoietic cells. Without conditioning by total-body irradiation (TBI), infusion of large numbers of normal bone marrow cells failed to correct the thalassemic peripheral blood phenotype. Since the recipients' stem cells are normal with respect to number and differentiation capacity, it was thought that the transplanted stem cells were not able to lodge, or that they were not stimulated to proliferate. Therefore, a nonlethal dose of TBI was given to temporarily reduce endogenous stem cell numbers and hemopoiesis. TBI doses of 2 or 3 Gy followed by infusion of normal bone marrow cells proved to be effective in replacing the thalassemic red cells by normal red cells, whereas a dose of 1 Gy was ineffective. It is concluded that cure of thalassemia by bone marrow transplantation does not necessarily require eradication of thalassemic stem cells. Consequently, the objectives of conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation of thalassemic patients (and possibly other nonmalignant hemopoietic disorders) should be reconsidered\n\nDietary intake and nutritional status in cancer patients; comparing adults and older adults.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGÃ³mez Valiente da Silva, Henyse; Fonseca de Andrade, Camila; Bello Moreira, Annie Seixas\n\n2014-04-01\n\nEvaluate the nutrient intake and nutritional status of food in cancer patients admitted to a university hospital, with comparison of adult and older adult age category.

In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to identify the rate and severity of depression among Iranian patients with Î²-thal using the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Î²-Thalassemic patients aged 13-20 years [median age 17.2 years; 27 males (48.2%), 29 females (51.8%)], who presented to the Mofid Children Hospital, Tehran, Iran, for blood transfusions within a 1-year period, were asked to complete the BDI questionnaire. Based on the BDI score, patients were classified as normal or mild-to-severe depression groups, and the collected data were then analyzed according to age and sex. A total of 56 subjects completed the BDI form. Mean score for BDI was 14.27âÂ±â12.79. Based on the BDI results, 35 (62.5%) had a BDI score below 16 and were therefore not classified as being depressed, while seven (12.5%) patients suffered from severe depression (BDIâ>â47). Age and gender did not have any significant association with the BDI results (pâ=â0.52 and pâ=â0.67, respectively). The total prevalence of various degrees of depression was 30.8% in this study. We concluded that the noticeable rate of depression in thalassemic patients signifies the necessity for improving psychosocial care in this specific group of patients.\n\nDietary intake and nutritional status in cancer patients: comparing adults and older adults\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGÃ³mez Valiente da Silva, Henyse; Fonseca de Andrade, Camila; Seixas Bello Moreira, Annie\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective: Evaluate the nutrient intake and nutritional status of food in cancer patients admitted to a university hospital, with comparison of adult and older adult age category Methods: Cross-sectional study.

Samples taken from these patients included complete blood and thyroid profile (serum thyroxine T4, triiodothyronine T3 and thyroid stimulating hormone TSH). These blood samples were labeled and sent to Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Rawalpindi for analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Primary hypothyroidism was defined by TSH levels >4IU/ml. Statistical analysis was done at the end of study using SPSS version 10. Significance for association was calculated using student t-test. Results: Sixty patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria out of these sixty four patients lost the follow up while 56 patients completed the study. Out of 56 patients, 21 (37.5 percent) had biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism. Mean Ferritin level was 3924 +- 1247ng/ml in hypothyroid and 3136 +- 1387ng/ml in euthyroid patients indicating a significant difference in mean serum ferritin levels between hypothyroid patients and others. Conclusion: The study demonstrates hypothyroidism in a significant number of hyper transfused Beta- thalassemic patients, emphasizing the importance of monitoring thyroid functions in thalassemic patients, particularly in those receiving suboptimal chelation.

AIMS: We aimed to characterize hematological abnormalities in adult patients with DS and determine their long-term significance. METHODS: We retrospectively studied a cohort of nine DS patients referred to the adult hematology service in our institution between May 2001 and April 2008. Data collected were: full blood count (FBC), comorbidities, investigations performed, duration of follow-up and outcome to most recent follow-up. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 26 months (9-71). Of the nine patients, two had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at presentation. Of these, one progressed, with increasing marrow failure, and requiring support with transfusions and gCSF. The remaining eight patients, with a variety of hematological abnormalities including leukopenia, macrocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, had persistently abnormal FBCs. However there was no evidence of progression, and no patient has evolved to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CONCLUSIONS: MDS is a complication of DS and may require supportive therapy. However, minor hematological abnormalities are common in adult DS patients, and may not signify underlying marrow disease.\n\nPlasma lipid pattern and red cell membrane structure in Î²-thalassemia patients in Jakarta\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSeruni K.U. Freisleben\n\n2011-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Over the last 10 years, we have investigated thalassemia patients in Jakarta to obtain a comprehensive pictureÂ of iron overload, oxidative stress, and cell damage.Methods: In blood samples from 15 transfusion-dependent patients (group T, 5 non-transfused patients (group N and 10Â controls (group C, plasma lipids and lipoproteins, lipid-soluble vitamin E, malondialdehyde (MDA and thiol status wereÂ measured. Isolated eryhtrocyte membranes were investigated with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR spectroscopyÂ using doxyl-stearic acid and maleimido-proxyl spin lables. Data were analyzed statistically with ANOVA.Results: Plasma triglycerides were higher and cholesterol levels were lower in thalassemic patients compared to controls.Â Vitamin E, group C: 21.8 vs T: 6.2 Î¼mol/L and reactive thiols (C: 144 vs. T: 61 Î¼mol/L were considerably lower inÂ transfused patients, who exert clear signs of oxidative stress (MDA, C: 1.96 vs T: 9.2 Î¼mol/L and of tissue cell damage,Â i.e., high transaminases plasma levels. Non-transfused thalassemia patients have slight signs of oxidative stress, but noÂ significant indication of cell damage. Erythrocyte membrane parameters from EPR spectroscopy differ considerablyÂ between all groups. In transfusion-dependent patients the structure of the erythrocyte membrane and the gradients of polarityÂ and fluidity are destroyed in lipid domains; binding capacity of protein thiols in the membrane is lower and immobilized.Conclusion: In tranfusion-dependent thalassemic patients, plasma lipid pattern and oxidative stress are associatedÂ with structural damage of isolated erythrocyte membranes as measured by EPR spectroscopy with lipid and proteinthiolÂ spin labels.

Materials and methods: We retrospectively evaluated chronically transfused patients, testing glucose with enzymatic tests, serum ferritin with chemiluminescence, LPI with cellular fluorescence, and T2* MRI to assess iron content in the heart, liver, and pancreas. MRI results were compared with one another and with serum glucose, ferritin, and LPI. Liver iron concentration (LIC) was determined in 11 patientsâ liver biopsies by atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: 289 MRI studies were available from 115 patients during the period studied. 9.4% of patients had overt diabetes and an additional 16% of patients had impaired fasting glucose. Both pancreatic and cardiac R2* had predictive power (p 2 = 0.20, p 2 = 0.09, p 2 = 0.14, p 2 = 0.03, p 2 of 0.91. Conclusions: Pancreatic iron overload can be assessed by MRI, but siderosis in other organs did not correlate significantly with pancreatic hemosiderosis.\n\nQuality of life assessment of children with thalassemia\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMasyitah Sri Wahyuni; Muhammad Ali; Nelly Rosdiana; Bidasari Lubis\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Thalassemia is a chronic disease that is becoming aÂ major health problem in the world, including the Mediterranean,Â as well as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
