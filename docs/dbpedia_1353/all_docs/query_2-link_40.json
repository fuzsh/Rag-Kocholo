        "text": "“Al Wasl contracted with coach Gustavo Quinteros to train the first team,” they tweeted.\n\nA tough task awaits to follow on from Arrubarrena, who worked wonders since his June 2016 arrival at an outfit who operate within their financial means.\n\nFinishes of second and third in the Arabian Gulf League represent the best of an otherwise trying professional era. Narrow defeats for the 42-year-old’s side in the Arabian Gulf Cup and President’s Cup showpieces were recorded in 2017/18.\n\nBut the outfit from Zabeel Stadium stunned UAE football by declining to renew the ex-Argentina, Boca Juniors and Villarreal left-back’s expired deal.\n\nHis replacement, Quinteros, is the latest in a long line of coaches from South America.\n\nCurrent Egypt boss Hector Cuper left after 13 poor AGL matches in 2013/14. He was replaced by Brazil’s World Cup 1994-winning right-back Jorginho, but he lasted until just October in the next campaign.\n\nCombustible ex-Argentina midfielder Gabriel Calderon then secured successive sixth-placed finishes, prior to Arruabarrena’s brilliant two-season stint."
