Tubo-ovarian and peritoneal high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is characterized by aberrant p53 expression induced by a TP53 mutation. However, our experience with some HGSC cases with a wild-type p53 immunostaining pattern led us to comprehensively review previous cases and investigate the TP53 mutational status of the exceptional cases. We analyzed the immunophenotype of 153 cases of HGSC and performed TP53 gene sequencing analysis in those with a wild-type p53 immunostaining pattern. Immunostaining revealed that 109 (71.3%) cases displayed diffuse and strong p53 expression (missense mutation pattern), while 39 (25.5%) had no p53 expression (nonsense mutation pattern). The remaining five cases of HGSC showed a wild-type p53 immunostaining pattern. Direct sequencing analysis revealed that three of these cases harbored nonsense TP53 mutations and two had novel splice site deletions. TP53 mutation is almost invariably present in HGSC, and p53 immunostaining can be used as a surrogate marker of TP53 mutation. In cases with a wild-type p53 immunostaining pattern, direct sequencing for TP53 mutational status can be helpful to confirm the presence of a TP53 mutation.

As patients receive intensified treatment, we sought to identify whether TP53 mutational status confers additional prognostic information. Patients and Methods We studied 40 patients with DAWT with anaplasia in the tissue from which DNA was extracted and analysed for TP53 mutations and 17p loss. The majority of cases were profiled by copy number (nâ=â32) and gene expression (nâ=â36) arrays. TP53 mutational status was correlated with patient event-free and overall survival, genomic copy number instability and gene expression profiling. Results From the 40 cases, 22 (55%) had TP53 mutations (2 detected only after deep-sequencing), 20 of which also had 17p loss (91%); 18 (45%) cases had no detectable mutation but three had 17p loss. Tumours with TP53 mutations and/or 17p loss (nâ=â25) had an increased risk of recurrence as a first event (pâ=â0.03, hazard ratio (HR), 3.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26â16.0) and death (pâ=â0.04, HR, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.36â31.7) compared to tumours lacking TP53 abnormalities. DAWT carrying TP53 mutations showed increased copy number alterations compared to those with wild-type, suggesting a more unstable genome (pâ=â0.03). These tumours showed deregulation of genes associated with cell cycle and DNA repair biological processes. Conclusion This study provides evidence that TP53 mutational analysis improves risk stratification in DAWT. This requires validation in an independent cohort before clinical use as a biomarker.

TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene, and its inactivation is widespread among human cancer types. However, the landscape of genomic alterations in human cancers stratified by the TP53 mutation has not yet been described. We obtained somatic mutation and copy number change data of 6551 regular-mutated samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compared significantly mutated genes (SMGs), copy number alterations, mutational signatures and mutational strand asymmetries between cancer samples with and without the TP53 mutation. We identified 126 SMGs, 30 of which were statistically significant in both the TP53 mutant and wild-type groups. Several SMGs, such as VHL, SMAD4 and PTEN, showed a mutation bias towards the TP53 wild-type group, whereas ATRX, IDH1 and RB1 were more prevalent in the TP53 mutant group. Five mutational signatures were extracted from the combined TCGA dataset on which mutational asymmetry analysis was performed, revealing that the TP53 mutant group exhibited substantially greater replication and transcription biases. Furthermore, we found that alterations of multiple genes in a merged mutually exclusive network composed of BRAF, EGFR, PAK1, PIK3CA, PTEN, APC and TERT were related to shortened survival in the TP53 wild-type group. In summary, we characterized the genomic differences and similarities underlying human cancers stratified by the TP53 mutation and identified multi-gene alterations of a merged mutually exclusive network to be a poor prognostic factor for the TP53 wild-type group.\n\nTP53 mutation-correlated genes predict the risk of tumor relapse and identify MPS1 as a potential therapeutic kinase in TP53-mutated breast cancers.\n\nPubMed\n\nGyÅrffy, BalÃ¡zs; Bottai, Giulia; Lehmann-Che, Jacqueline; KÃ©ri, GyÃ¶rgy; Orfi, LÃ¡szlÃ³; Iwamoto, Takayuki; Desmedt, Christine; Bianchini, Giampaolo; Turner, Nicholas C; de ThÃ¨, Hugues; AndrÃ©, Fabrice; Sotiriou, Christos; Hortobagyi, Gabriel N; Di Leo, Angelo; Pusztai, Lajos; Santarpia, Libero\n\n2014-05-01\n\nBreast cancers (BC) carry a complex set of gene mutations that can influence their gene expression and clinical behavior. We aimed to identify genes driven by the TP53 mutation status and assess their clinical relevance in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative BC, and their potential as targets for patients with TP53 mutated tumors. Separate ROC analyses of each gene expression according to TP53 mutation status were performed. The prognostic value of genes with the highest AUC were assessed in a large dataset of untreated, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy treated patients. The mitotic checkpoint gene MPS1 was the most significant gene correlated with TP53 status, and the most significant prognostic marker in all ER-positive BC datasets. MPS1 retained its prognostic value independently from the type of treatment administered. The biological functions of MPS1 were investigated in different BC cell lines. We also assessed the effects of a potent small molecule inhibitor of MPS1, SP600125, alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Consistent with the gene expression profiling and siRNA assays, the inhibition of MPS1 by SP600125 led to a reduction in cell viability and a significant increase in cell death, selectively in TP53-mutated BC cells. Furthermore, the chemical inhibition of MPS1 sensitized BC cells to conventional chemotherapy, particularly taxanes. Our results collectively demonstrate that TP53-correlated kinase MPS1, is a potential therapeutic target in BC patients with TP53 mutated tumors, and that SP600125 warrant further development in future clinical trials.

It is currently unknown how common TP53 mutations with low variant allele frequency (VAF) are, whether they are linked to hydroxyurea (HU) cytoreduction, and what disease progression risk they carry. Using ultra-deep next-generation sequencing, we examined 254 MPN patients treated with HU, interferon alpha-2a or anagrelide and 85 untreated patients. We found TP53 mutations in 50 cases (0.2â16.3% VAF), regardless of disease subtype, driver gene status and cytoreduction. Both therapy and TP53 mutations were strongly associated with older age. Over-time analysis showed that the mutations may be undetectable at diagnosis and slowly increase during disease course. Although three patients with TP53 mutations progressed to TP53-mutated or TP53-wild-type AML, we did not observe a significant age-independent impact on overall survival during the follow-up. Further, we showed that complete p53 inactivation alone led to neither blast transformation nor HU resistance. Altogether, we revealed patient's age as the strongest factor affecting low-burden TP53 mutation incidence in MPN and found no significant age-independent association between TP53 mutations and hydroxyurea. Mutations may persist at low levels for years without an immediate risk of progression.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective analysis of pretreatment tumor TP53, HPV, Bcl-xL and cyclin D1 status in stage III and IV larynx cancer patients in a clinical trial. METHODS TP53 exons 4-9 from 58 tumors were sequenced. Mutations were grouped using three classifications based on their expected function. Each functional group was analyzed for response to induction chemotherapy, time to surgery, survival, HPV status, p16INK4a, Bcl-xl and cyclin D1 expression. RESULTS TP53 Mutations were found in 22/58 (37.9%) patients with advanced larynx cancer, including missense mutations in 13/58 (22.4%) patients, nonsense mutations in 4/58 (6.9%), and deletions in 5/58 (8.6%). High risk HPV was found in 20/52 (38.5%) tumors. A classification based on crystal Evolutionary Action score of p53 (EAp53) distinguished missense mutations with high risk for decreased survival from low risk mutations (p=0.0315). A model including this TP53 classification, HPV status, cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL staining significantly predicts survival (p=0.0017).

Our study explored the associations of TP53 mutations, gene expression, clinical outcomes, and TP53 interaction networks across 33 cancer types using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We show that TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in a number of cancers, and its mutations appear to be early events in cancer initiation. We identified genes potentially repressed by p53, and genes whose expression correlates significantly with TP53 expression. These gene products may be especially important nodes in p53 interaction networks in human cancers. This study shows that while TP53-truncating mutations often result in decreased TP53 expression, other non-truncating TP53 mutations result in increased TP53 expression in some cancers. Survival analyses in a number of cancers show that patients with TP53 mutations are more likely to have worse prognoses than TP53-wildtype patients, and that elevated TP53 expression often leads to poor clinical outcomes. We identified a set of candidate synthetic lethal (SL) genes for TP53, and validated some of these SL interactions using data from the Cancer Cell Line Project. These predicted SL genes are promising candidates for experimental validation and the development of personalized therapeutics for patients with TP53-mutated cancers.

To date, no studies have addressed the impact of TP53 mutations in prospective clinical trial cohorts. To evaluate the impact of TP53 mutation to current risk models in aggressive B-NHL, we investigated TP53 gene mutations within the RICOVER-60 trial. Of 1,222 elderly patients (aged 61-80 years) enrolled in the study and randomized to six or eight cycles of CHOP-14 with or without Rituximab (NCT00052936), 265 patients were analyzed for TP53 mutations. TP53 mutations were demonstrated in 63 of 265 patients (23.8%). TP53 mutation was associated with higher LDH (65% vs. 37%; pâ<â0.001), higher international prognostic index-Scores (IPI 4/5 27% vs. 12%; pâ=â0.025) and B-symptoms (41% vs. 24%; pâ=â0.011). Patients with TP53 mutation were less likely to obtain a complete remission CR/CRu (CR unconfirmed) 61.9% (mut) vs. 79.7% (wt) (pâ=â0.007). TP53 mutations were associated with decreased event-free (EFS), progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (median observation time of 40.2 months): the 3 year EFS, PFS and OS were 42% (vs. 60%; pâ=â0.012), 42% (vs. 67.5%; pâ<â0.001) and 50% (vs. 76%; pâ<â0.001) for the TP53 mutation group. In a Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusting for IPI-factors and treatment arms, TP53 mutation was shown to be an independent predictor of EFS (HR 1.5), PFS (HR 2.0) and OS (HR 2.3; pâ<â0.001). TP53 mutations are independent predictors of survival in untreated patients with aggressive CD20+ lymphoma. TP53 mutations should be considered for risk models in DLBCL and strategies to improve outcome for patients with mutant TP53 must be developed. Â© 2017 UICC.\n\nNutlinâ3a selects for cells harbouring TP 53 mutations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHollstein, Monica; Arlt, Volker M.; Phillips, David H.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTP53 mutations occur in half of all human tumours. Mutagenâinduced or spontaneous TP53 mutagenesis can be studied in vitro using the human TP53 knockâin (Hupki) mouse embryo fibroblast (HUF) immortalisation assay (HIMA). TP53 mutations arise in up to 30% of mutagenâtreated, immortalised HUFs; however, mutants are not identified until TP53 sequence analysis following immortalisation (2â5 months) and much effort is expended maintaining TP53âWT cultures. In order to improve the selectivity of the HIMA for HUFs harbouring TP53 mutations, we explored the use of Nutlinâ3a, an MDM2 inhibitor that leads to stabilisation and activation of wildâtype (WT) p53. First, we treated previously established immortal HUF lines carrying WT or mutated TP53 with Nutlinâ3a to examine the effect on cell growth and p53 activation. Nutlinâ3a induced the p53 pathway in TP53âWT HUFs and inhibited cell growth, whereas most TP53âmutated HUFs were resistant to Nutlinâ3a. We then assessed whether Nutlinâ3a treatment could discriminate between TP53âWT and TP53âmutated cells during the HIMA (nâ=â72 cultures). As immortal clones emerged from senescent cultures, each was treated with 10 ÂµM Nutlinâ3a for 5 days and observed for sensitivity or resistance. TP53 was subsequently sequenced from all immortalised clones. We found that all Nutlinâ3aâresistant clones harboured TP53 mutations, which were diverse in position and functional impact, while all but one of the Nutlinâ3aâsensitive clones were TP53âWT. These data suggest that including a Nutlinâ3a counterâscreen significantly improves the specificity and efficiency of the HIMA, whereby TP53âmutated clones are selected prior to sequencing and TP53âWT clones can be discarded.

The aim of this study was to investigate the detailed TP53 mutation and human papilloma virus (HPV) status of OSCC in patients, younger than 45Â years. TP53 mutations were determined with direct sequencing on paraffin-embedded carcinoma tissue from 31 young patients and compared with two older age OSCC reference groups: one from the same institute (NÂ =Â 87) and an independent one (NÂ =Â 675). Biologically active tumour HPV was detected by p16-immunohistochemistry followed by a HPV-DNA GP5Â +Â /6Â +Â -PCR. HPV16 was present in one OSCC (3%). TP53 mutations were found in 14 (45%) OSCC: five were missense and nine resulted in a truncated protein. Six of these latter were insertions or deletions of one or more nucleotides leading to frameshift, one was at a splice site and two resulted in a stop codon. The percentage of truncating mutations (64% of all mutations) was higher than that observed in the institute's reference group (44%, PÂ =Â 0.23) and in the independent reference group (24%, PÂ =Â 0.002). This study shows that TP53 mutations are common in OSCC of young adult patients; infection with biologically active HPV is rare. Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Ninety-one patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma were included. Mutational analysis of TP53, exons 4-10, was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing. P53 and P21 protein immunostaining was assessed. Multivariate Cox models were adjusted for gender, number of metastasis, resection margin, presence of TP53 mutations and chemotherapy treatment. Forty-six of 91 (50.05%) metastases showed mutations in TP53, observed mainly in exons 5-8, although 14.3% (n = 13) were located in exons 9 and 10. Forty percent (n = 22) were protein-truncating mutations. TP53 status associated with multiple (> or =3) metastases (65.6%, P = 0.033), advanced primary tumor Dukes' stage (P = 0.011) and younger age (<57 years old, P = 0.03). Presence of mutation associated with poor prognosis in univariate (P = 0.017) and multivariate Cox model [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-3.06, P = 0.028]. Prognostic value was maintained in patients undergoing radical resection (R0 series, n = 79, P = 0.014). Mutation associated with a worse outcome in chemotherapy-treated patients (HR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.12-5.75, P = 0.026). The combination of > or =3 metastases and TP53 mutation identified a subset of patients with very poor prognosis (P = 0.009). P53 and P21 protein immunostaining did not show correlation with survival. TP53 mutational status seems to be an important prognostic factor in patients undergoing surgical resection of colorectal cancer HMs.\n\nOptimized p53 immunohistochemistry is an accurate predictor of TP53 mutation in ovarian carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¶bel, Martin; Piskorz, Anna M; Lee, Sandra; Lui, Shuhong; LePage, Cecile; Marass, Francesco; Rosenfeld, Nitzan; Mes Masson, Anne-Marie; Brenton, James D\n\n2016-10-01\n\nTP53 mutations are ubiquitous in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC), and the presence of TP53 mutation discriminates between high and low-grade serous carcinomas and is now an important biomarker for clinical trials targeting mutant p53. p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is widely used as a surrogate for TP53 mutation but its accuracy has not been established. The objective of this study was to test whether improved methods for p53 IHC could reliably predict TP53 mutations independently identified by next generation sequencing (NGS). Four clinical p53 IHC assays and tagged-amplicon NGS for TP53 were performed on 171 HGSOC and 80 endometrioid carcinomas (EC). p53 expression was scored as overexpression (OE), complete absence (CA), cytoplasmic (CY) or wild type (WT). p53 IHC was evaluated as a binary classifier where any abnormal staining predicted deleterious TP53 mutation and as a ternary classifier where OE, CA or WT staining predicted gain-of-function (GOF or nonsynonymous), loss-of-function (LOF including stopgain, indel, splicing) or no detectable TP53 mutations (NDM), respectively. Deleterious TP53 mutations were detected in 169/171 (99%) HGSOC and 7/80 (8.8%) EC. The overall accuracy for the best performing IHC assay for binary and ternary prediction was 0.94 and 0.91 respectively, which improved to 0.97 (sensitivity 0.96, specificity 1.00) and 0.95 after secondary analysis of discordant cases. The sensitivity for predicting LOF mutations was lower at 0.76 because p53 IHC detected mutant p53 protein in 13 HGSOC with LOF mutations. CY staining associated with LOF was seen in 4 (2.3%) of HGSOC.

The objective of this study was to test whether improved methods for p53 IHC could reliably predict TP53 mutations independently identified by next generation sequencing (NGS). Four clinical p53 IHC assays and taggedâamplicon NGS for TP53 were performed on 171 HGSOC and 80 endometrioid carcinomas (EC). p53 expression was scored as overexpression (OE), complete absence (CA), cytoplasmic (CY) or wild type (WT). p53 IHC was evaluated as a binary classifier where any abnormal staining predicted deleterious TP53 mutation and as a ternary classifier where OE, CA or WT staining predicted gainâofâfunction (GOF or nonsynonymous), lossâofâfunction (LOF including stopgain, indel, splicing) or no detectable TP53 mutations (NDM), respectively. Deleterious TP53 mutations were detected in 169/171 (99%) HGSOC and 7/80 (8.8%) EC. The overall accuracy for the best performing IHC assay for binary and ternary prediction was 0.94 and 0.91 respectively, which improved to 0.97 (sensitivity 0.96, specificity 1.00) and 0.95 after secondary analysis of discordant cases. The sensitivity for predicting LOF mutations was lower at 0.76 because p53 IHC detected mutant p53 protein in 13 HGSOC with LOF mutations. CY staining associated with LOF was seen in 4 (2.3%) of HGSOC.

In order to assess the prognostic value of these two genes' mutations in lung cancer recurrence, we analyzed mutations in codon 12 of the KRAS gene and in hotspot codons of the TP53 gene in 176 bronchial biopsies obtained from 77 former lung cancer patients. Forty-seven patients (61.0%) showed mutations, including 35/77 (45.5%) in the KRAS gene and 25/77 (32.5%) in the TP53 gene, among them 13/77 (16.9%) had mutations in both genes. When grouped according to past or current smoking status, a higher proportion of current smokers showed mutations, in particular those in the TP53 gene (Pâ=â0.07), compared with ex-smokers. These mutations were found in both abnormal lesions (8/20 or 40%) and histologically normal tissues (70/156 or 44.9%) (Pâ=â0.812). They consisted primarily of G to A transition and G to T transversion in both the KRAS (41/56 or 73.2%) and TP53 (24/34 or 70.6%) genes, consistent with mutations found in lung tumors of smoking lung cancer patients. Overall, recurrence-free survival (RFS) among all subjects could be explained by age at diagnosis, tumor stage, tumor subtype, and smoking (Pâ<â0.05, Cox proportional hazard). Therefore, KRAS and TP53 mutations were frequently detected in bronchial tissues of former lung cancer patients. However, the presence of mutation of bronchial biopsies was not significantly associated with a shorter RFS time. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Complex karyotype (CK), TP53 deletions and/or mutations (TP53 disruption), IGVH mutational status, and, more recently, recurrent somatic mutations have been identified as prognostic markers in CLL. On a cohort of 110 patients with CLL treated with first-line fludarabin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab treatment compared with 33 untreated (watch and wait) patients with CLL, we report more frequent complex karyotypes (34 vs 15%; PÂ =Â .05), unmutated IGHV (70 vs 21%; PÂ <Â .0001), ATM deletion (25 vs 6%, PÂ =Â .02), and NOTCH mutation (3 vs 17%, PÂ =Â .04). Among treated patients, 39 relapsed during the follow-up period. These patients were characterized before treatment by a higher incidence of trisomy 12 (38 vs 11%, PÂ <Â .001) and TP53 disruption (31 vs 4%, PÂ =Â .0002). A significantly shorter 5-year overall survival was found for treated patients with CK (72.4 vs 85.8%; PÂ =Â .007), unmutated IGHV (70 vs 100%; PÂ =Â .04), or TP53 disruption (55.7 vs 82.7%; PÂ <Â .0001). Three risk groups were defined based on the status of TP53 disruption or unmutated IGVH, which differed significantly in terms of 5-year overall survival. Moreover, the presence of CK impacted pejoratively 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival in all these 3 groups. Conventional karyotyping therefore appears to be of value, CK being an additional factor, undetectable in classical FISH, in patients with CLL at the stage when therapy becomes required.

Despite intense efforts, to date, no other genes have been associated with the disorder in a significant number of TP53 mutation-negative families. A search for defects in TP53 other than heterozygous missense mutations showed that neither intron variants nor sequence variants in the TP53 promoter are frequent in LFS, and multiexon deletions have been found to be responsible for LFS only in several cases. Another cancer predisposition syndrome, hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, has been associated with epigenetic silencing of one allele of the MLH1 or MSH2 genes. This prompted us to test the methylation of the TP53 gene promoter in a set of 14 families suggestive of LFS using bisulphite sequencing of three DNA fragments from the 5' region of the gene. We found no detectable methylation at any of the CG dinucleotides tested. Thus, epigenetic silencing of the TP53 promoter is not a frequent cause of the disorder in families suggestive of LFS but with no germline mutations in the coding part of the gene.\n\nWNT activation by lithium abrogates TP53 mutation associated radiation resistance in medulloblastoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhukova, Nataliya; Ramaswamy, Vijay; Remke, Marc; Martin, Dianna C; Castelo-Branco, Pedro; Zhang, Cindy H; Fraser, Michael; Tse, Ken; Poon, Raymond; Shih, David J H; Baskin, Berivan; Ray, Peter N; Bouffet, Eric; Dirks, Peter; von Bueren, Andre O; Pfaff, Elke; Korshunov, Andrey; Jones, David T W; Northcott, Paul A; Kool, Marcel; Pugh, Trevor J; Pomeroy, Scott L; Cho, Yoon-Jae; Pietsch, Torsten; Gessi, Marco; Rutkowski, Stefan; BognÃ¡r, Laszlo; Cho, Byung-Kyu; Eberhart, Charles G; Conter, Cecile Faure; Fouladi, Maryam; French, Pim J; Grajkowska, Wieslawa A; Gupta, Nalin; Hauser, Peter; Jabado, Nada; Vasiljevic, Alexandre; Jung, Shin; Kim, Seung-Ki; Klekner, Almos; Kumabe, Toshihiro; Lach, Boleslaw; Leonard, Jeffrey R; Liau, Linda M; Massimi, Luca; Pollack, Ian F; Ra, Young Shin; Rubin, Joshua B; Van Meir, Erwin G; Wang, Kyu-Chang; Weiss, William A; Zitterbart, Karel; Bristow, Robert G; Alman, Benjamin; Hawkins, Cynthia E; Malkin, David; Clifford, Steven C; Pfister, Stefan M; Taylor, Michael D; Tabori, Uri\n\n2014-12-24\n\nTP53 mutations confer subgroup specific poor survival for children with medulloblastoma. We hypothesized that WNT activation which is associated with improved survival for such children abrogates TP53 related radioresistance and can be used to sensitize TP53 mutant tumors for radiation. We examined the subgroup-specific role of TP53 mutations in a cohort of 314 patients treated with radiation. TP53 wild-type or mutant human medulloblastoma cell-lines and normal neural stem cells were used to test radioresistance of TP53 mutations and the radiosensitizing effect of WNT activation on tumors and the developing brain. Children with WNT/TP53 mutant medulloblastoma had higher 5-year survival than those with SHH/TP53 mutant tumours (100% and 36.6%Â±8.7%, respectively (p<0.001)). Introduction of TP53 mutation into medulloblastoma cells induced radioresistance (survival fractions at 2Gy (SF2) of 89%Â±2% vs. 57.4%Â±1.8% (p<0.01)). In contrast, Î²-catenin mutation sensitized TP53 mutant cells to radiation (p<0.05). Lithium, an activator of the WNT pathway, sensitized TP53 mutant medulloblastoma to radiation (SF2 of 43.5%Â±1.5% in lithium treated cells vs. 56.6Â±3% (p<0.01)) accompanied by increased number of Î³H2AX foci. Normal neural stem cells were protected from lithium induced radiation damage (SF2 of 33%Â±8% for lithium treated cells vs. 27%Â±3% for untreated controls (p=0.05). Poor survival of patients with TP53 mutant medulloblastoma may be related to radiation resistance. Since constitutive activation of the WNT pathway by lithium sensitizes TP53 mutant medulloblastoma cells and protect normal neural stem cells from radiation, this oral drug may represent an attractive novel therapy for high-risk medulloblastomas.\n\nHPV-negative penile squamous cell carcinoma: disruptive mutations in the TP53 gene are common.\n\nPubMed\n\nKashofer, Karl; Winter, Elke; Halbwedl, Iris; Thueringer, Andrea; Kreiner, Marisa; Sauer, Stefan; Regauer, Sigrid\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe majority of penile squamous cell carcinomas is caused by transforming human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. The etiology of HPV-negative cancers is unclear, but TP53 mutations have been implicated. Archival tissues of 108 invasive squamous cell carcinoma from a single pathology institution in a low-incidence area were analyzed for HPV-DNA and p16 ink4a overexpression and for TP53 mutations by ion torrent next-generation sequencing. Library preparation failed in 32/108 squamous cell carcinomas. Institutional review board approval was obtained. Thirty of 76 squamous cell carcinomas (43%; average 63 years) were HPV-negative with 8/33 squamous cell carcinomas being TP53 wild-type (24%; average 63 years). Twenty-five of 33 squamous cell carcinomas (76%; average 65 years) showed 32 different somatic TP53 mutations (23 missense mutations in exons 5-8, 6 nonsense, 1 frameshift and 2 splice-site mutations). Several hotspot mutations were detected multiple times (R175H, R248, R282, and R273). Eighteen of 19 squamous cell carcinomas with TP53 expression in immunohistochemistry had TP53 mutations. Fifty percent of TP53-negative squamous cell carcinomas showed mostly truncating loss-of-function TP53 mutations. Patients without mutations had longer survival (5 years: 86% vs 61%; 10 years: 60% vs 22%), but valid clinically relevant conclusions cannot be drawn due to different tumor stages and heterogeneous treatment of the cases presented in this study. Somatic TP53 mutations are a common feature in HPV-negative penile squamous cell carcinomas and offer an explanation for HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis. About half of HPV-negative penile cancers are driven by oncogenic activation of TP53, while a quarter is induced by loss of TP53 tumor suppressor function. Detection of TP53 mutations should be carried out by sequencing, as immunohistochemical TP53 staining could not identify all squamous cell carcinomas with TP53 mutations.\n\nHSP27 expression in primary colorectal cancers is dependent on mutation of KRAS and PI3K/AKT activation status and is independent of TP53.\n\nPubMed\n\nGhosh, Anil; Lai, Cecilia; McDonald, Sarah; Suraweera, Nirosha; Sengupta, Neel; Propper, David; Dorudi, Sina; Silver, Andrew\n\n2013-02-01\n\nColorectal adenomas display features of senescence, but these are often lost upon progression to carcinoma, indicating that oncogene induced senescence (OIS) could be a roadblock in colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been implicated in the prognosis of CRC and HSP based therapy is a current interest for drug development. Recent cell culture studies have suggested that in the absence of a TP53 mutation, OIS mediated by PI3K/AKT activation can be circumvented by high expression of HSPs. Furthermore, while PI3K/AKT activation and KRAS mutations are independent inducers of OIS, PI3K/AKT activation can suppress KRAS-induced OIS when both are present in cultured cells. As KRAS mutations, PI3K/AKT activation and TP53 mutations are all common features of CRC, it is possible that the requirement for HSP to inhibit OIS in CRC is dependent on the mutation spectrum of a tumour. However, work on HSP that utilised mutation profiled human tumour tissues has been limited. Here, we characterised the expression of two major HSP proteins (HSP27 and 72) by immunohistochemistry (IHC), the mutation status of TP53, KRAS and PIK3CA genes by direct sequencing and the activation status of AKT by IHC in a cohort of unselected primary CRC (n=74). We compare our data with findings generated from cell-based studies. Expression of HSP27 and HSP72 was correlated to clinicopathological and survival data but no significant association was found. We also established the mutation status of TP53, KRAS and PIK3CA genes and the activation status of AKT in our CRC panel. We did not detect any associations between HSP27 or HSP72 expression with TP53 mutation status. However, HSP27 expression in CRCs was strongly associated with the co-presence of wildtype KRAS and activated PI3K/AKT (p=0.004), indicating a possible role of HSP27 in overcoming PI3K/AKT induced OIS in tumours. Our studies suggest a role for using archival tissues in validating hypotheses generated from cell\n\nTP53 mutations in primary breast carcinomas from white and African-Brazilian patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nNagai, Maria Aparecida; Schaer Barbosa, Helenemarie; Zago, Marco Antonio; AraÃºjo Silva, Wilson; Nishimoto, InÃªs Nobuko; Salaorni, Sibeli; Guerreiro Costa, LÃ­via Nery Franco; Silva AraÃºjo, Marcos; Caldas Oliveira, Ana Gabriela; MourÃ¢o Neto, MÃ¡rio; Brentani, Maria Mitzi\n\n2003-07-01\n\nWe have attempted to determine the incidence, nature and clinical significance of TP53 mutation in a group of white (242 cases) and African-Brazilian (52 cases) patients with breast cancer. The interethnic admixture as estimated by STR markers showed that white subjects displayed 67.9+/-0.4%, 25.0+/-1.7% and 7.0%+/-1.6% and the black populations had 34.4+/-1.9%, 56.2+/-1.9 and 9.4+/-2.2% respectively of European, African and Amerindian genes. Clinical parameters such as age, lymph node status and steroid receptors were similar in both groups. African-Brazilian patients presented more advanced lesions. Mutation screening was performed using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation analysis followed by sequencing. Compared to whites (13.6%), a relatively high frequency of TP53 mutation was found in blacks (32.7%) (p=0.001). African-Brazilian women have a larger proportion of mutations in exons 5 and 7, whereas white women have more mutations in exon 8. Mutations within exon 4 were found only in tumors of white patients. The spectra of TP53 mutations show that A:T-->G:C nucleotide transversion and G:C-->C:G transition were more common in African-Brazilian women whereas G:C-->T:A transversion occurs very frequently in whites. A high prevalence of G:C-->A:T nucleotide transitions and deletions was detected in both groups. No association was found between p53 gene mutation and tumor or clinical parameters independently of the ethnic group. With a median follow-up of 35.6 months for whites and 43.4 months for the blacks, no differences in overall survival were found. If white patients were stratified according to the type and location of TP53 mutations, patients with mutations affecting amino acids directly involved in DNA or Zn binding displayed a poor prognosis. The pattern of mutations found in our population seems to reflect a base line pattern observed in populations with similar ethnic profile with some modifications, which might be derived from specific\n\nClinical implications of genomic profiles in metastatic breast cancer with a focus on TP53 and PIK3CA, the most frequently mutated genes.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Ji-Yeon; Lee, Eunjin; Park, Kyunghee; Park, Woong-Yang; Jung, Hae Hyun; Ahn, Jin Seok; Im, Young-Hyuck; Park, Yeon Hee\n\n2017-04-25\n\nBreast cancer (BC) has been genetically profiled through large-scale genome analyses. However, the role and clinical implications of genetic alterations in metastatic BC (MBC) have not been evaluated. Therefore, we conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq of 37 MBC samples and targeted deep sequencing of another 29 MBCs. We evaluated somatic mutations from WES and targeted sequencing and assessed gene expression and performed pathway analysis from RNA-Seq. In this analysis, PIK3CA was the most commonly mutated gene in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC, while in ER-negative BC, TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene (p = 0.018 and p < 0.001, respectively). TP53 stopgain/loss and frameshift mutation was related to low expression of TP53 in contrast nonsynonymous mutation was related to high expression. The impact of TP53 mutation on clinical outcome varied with regard to ER status. In ER-positive BCs, wild type TP53 had a better prognosis than mutated TP53 (median overall survival (OS) (wild type vs. mutated): 88.5 Â± 54.4 vs. 32.6 Â± 10.7 (months), p = 0.002). In contrast, mutated TP53 had a protective effect in ER-negative BCs (median OS: 0.10 vs. 32.6 Â± 8.2, p = 0.026). However, PIK3CA mutation did not affect patient survival. In gene expression analysis, CALM1, a potential regulator of AKT, was highly expressed in PIK3CA-mutated BCs. In conclusion, mutation of TP53 was associated with expression status and affect clinical outcome according to ER status in MBC. Although mutation of PIK3CA was not related to survival in this study, mutation of PIK3CA altered the expression of other genes and pathways including CALM1 and may be a potential predictive marker of PI3K inhibitor effectiveness.\n\nSequential mutations in Notch1, Fbxw7, and Tp53 in radiation-induced mouse thymic lymphomas.\n\nPubMed\n\nJen, Kuang-Yu; Song, Ihn Young; Banta, Karl Luke; Wu, Di; Mao, Jian-Hua; Balmain, Allan\n\n2012-01-19\n\nT-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphomas commonly demonstrate activating Notch1 mutations as well as mutations or deletions in Fbxw7. However, because Fbxw7 targets Notch1 for degradation, genetic alterations in these genes are expected to be mutually exclusive events in lymphomagenesis. Previously, by using a radiation-induced Tp53-deficient mouse model for T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma, we reported that loss of heterozygosity at the Fbxw7 locus occurs frequently in a Tp53-dependent manner. In the current study, we show that these thymic lymphomas also commonly exhibit activating Notch1 mutations in the proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine (PEST) domain. Moreover, concurrent activating Notch1 PEST domain mutations and single-copy deletions at the Fbxw7 locus occur with high frequency in the same individual tumors, indicating that these changes are not mutually exclusive events. We further demonstrate that although Notch1 PEST domain mutations are independent of Tp53 status, they are completely abolished in mice with germline Fbxw7 haploinsufficiency. Therefore, Notch1 PEST domain mutations only occur when Fbxw7 expression levels are intact. These data suggest a temporal sequence of mutational events involving these important cancer-related genes, with Notch1 PEST domain mutations occurring first, followed by Fbxw7 deletion, and eventually by complete loss of Tp53.\n\nBRCA1/2 and TP53 mutation status associates with PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in ovarian cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nWieser, Verena; Gaugg, Inge; Fleischer, Martina; Shivalingaiah, Giridhar; Wenzel, Soeren; Sprung, Susanne; Lax, Sigurd F; Zeimet, Alain G; Fiegl, Heidelinde; Marth, Christian\n\n2018-04-03\n\nCheckpoint molecules such as programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 are critically required for tumor immune escape. The objective of this study was to investigate tumoral PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA-expression in a cohort of ovarian cancer (OC) patients in relation to tumor mutations. We analyzed mRNA expression of PD-1 , PD-L1 and IFNG by quantitative real-time PCR in tissue of 170 patients with low grade-serous (LGSOC), high-grade serous (HGSOC), endometrioid and clear cell OC compared to 28 non-diseased tissues (ovaries and fallopian tubes) in relation to tumor protein 53 ( TP53 ) and breast cancer gene 1/2 ( BRCA1/2 ) mutation status. TP53 -mutated OC strongly expressed PD-L1 compared to TP53 wild-type OC ( p = 0.028) and BRCA1/2 -mutated OC increasingly expressed PD-1 ( p = 0.024) and PD-L1 ( p = 0.012) compared to BRCA1/2 wild-type OC. For the first time in human, we noted a strong correlation between tumoral IFNG and PD-1 or PD-L1 mRNA-expression, respectively ( p < 0.001). OC tissue increasingly expressed PD-1 compared to healthy controls (vs. ovaries: p < 0.001; vs. tubes: p = 0.018). PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA-expression increased with higher tumor grade ( p = 0.008 and p = 0.027, respectively) and younger age (< median age, p = 0.001). Finally, in the major subgroup of our cohort, FIGO stage III/IV HGSOC, high PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA-expression was associated with reduced progression-free ( p = 0.024) and overall survival ( p = 0.049) but only in the univariate analysis. Our study suggests that in OC PD-1 / PD-L1 mRNA-expression is controlled by IFNÎ³ and affected by TP53 and BRCA1/2 mutations. We suggest that these mutations might serve as potential predictive factors that guide anti- PD1 / PD-L1 immunotherapy.\n\nClinicopathological features and clinical outcomes associated with TP53 and BRAFNon-V600 mutations in cutaneous melanoma patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Dae Won; Haydu, Lauren E; Joon, Aron Y; Bassett, Roland L; Siroy, Alan E; Tetzlaff, Michael T; Routbort, Mark J; Amaria, Rodabe N; Wargo, Jennifer A; McQuade, Jennifer L; Kemnade, Jan; Hwu, Patrick; Woodman, Scott E; Roszik, Jason; Kim, Kevin B; Gershenwald, Jeffrey E; Lazar, Alexander J; Davies, Michael A\n\n2017-04-15\n\nBRAF V600 , NRAS, TP53, and BRAF Non-V600 are among the most common mutations detected in non-acral cutaneous melanoma patients. Although several studies have identified clinical and pathological features associated with BRAF V600 and NRAS mutations, limited data are available regarding the correlates and significance of TP53 and BRAF Non-V600 mutations. This study analyzed the patient demographics, primary tumor features, and clinical outcomes of a large cohort of non-acral cutaneous melanoma patients who had undergone clinically indicated molecular testing (nâ=â926). The prevalence of BRAF V600 , NRAS, TP53, and BRAF Non-V600 mutations was 43%, 21%, 19%, and 7%, respectively. The presence of a TP53 mutation was associated with older age (Pâ=â.019), a head and neck primary tumor site (Pâ=â.0001), and longer overall survival (OS) from the diagnosis of stage IV disease in univariate (Pâ=â.039) and multivariate analyses (Pâ=â.015). BRAF Non-V600 mutations were associated with older age (Pâ=â.005) but not with primary tumor features or OS from stage IV. Neither TP53 nor BRAF Non-V600 mutations correlated significantly with OS with frontline ipilimumab treatment, and the TP53 status was not significantly associated with outcomes with frontline BRAF inhibitor therapy. Eleven patients with BRAF Non-V600 mutations were treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Three patients were not evaluable for a response because of treatment cessation for toxicities; the remaining patients had disease progression as the best response to therapy. These results add to the understanding of the clinical features associated with TP53 and BRAF Non-V600 mutations in advanced cutaneous melanoma patients, and they support the rationale for evaluating the prognostic significance of TP53 in other cohorts of melanoma patients.

G-quadruplexes (G4s) are secondary structural motifs occurring in guanine tracks, with regulatory effects on DNA and RNA. We analyzed 85 polymorphisms within or near five predicted G4s in TP53 in search of modifiers of penetrance of LFS/LFL in Brazilian cancer families with (n = 35) or without (n = 110) TP53 mutations. Statistical analyses stratified on family structure showed that cancer tended to occur ~15 years later in mutation carriers who also carried the variant alleles of two polymorphisms within predicted G4-forming regions, rs17878362 (TP53 PIN3, 16 bp duplication in intron 3; P = 0.082) and rs17880560 (6 bp duplication in 3â² flanking region; P = 0.067). Haplotype analysis showed that this inverse association was driven by the polymorphic status of the remaining wild-type (WT) haplotype in mutation carriers: in carriers with a WT haplotype containing at least one variant allele of rs17878362 or rs17880560, cancer occurred ~15 years later than in carriers with other WT haplotypes (P = 0.019). No effect on age of cancer onset was observed in subjects without a TP53 mutation. The G4 in intron 3 has been shown to regulate alternative p53 messenger RNA splicing, whereas the biological roles of predicted G4s in the 3â² flanking region remain to be elucidated. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that G4 polymorphisms in haplotypes of the WT TP53 allele have an impact on LFS/LFL penetrance in germline TP53 mutation carriers.

Methods and materials: The TP53 mutation and HPV status were analyzed in 78 cases of locoregionally advanced OPSCC. The possible correlation of these factors with locoregiownal control, relapse-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) was also investigated. Results: Of these 78 cases, 22 had disruptive and 22 had non-disruptive (silent) TP53 mutations; the remaining 34 cases had wild-type (WT) TP53. HPV 16 DNA was found in 9 cases (11%), but all HPV-positive (HPV+) cases carried a functionalmoreÂ Â» p53 protein, except for 1 case that had a silent mutation. HPV+ patients fared better than HPV-negative (HPV-) patients in terms of all survival parameters, with highly statistically significant differences between the groups. Specifically, no distant metastases were observed in the HPV+ patients, whereas they occurred in 17% of the HPV- patients. However, no difference was observed between the WT TP53 and mutation group, even when this was analyzed in terms of disruptive and non-disruptive mutations. Regardless, treatment with chemotherapy nearly doubled the 5-year OS rates, both in the mutation (42% vs. 22%) and WT (30 vs. 16%) group, but only the mutation group showed improvement in all survival parameters. In addition, the second tumor-free 5-year survival rate was 72% in HPV- cases, but no second tumors were observed in HPV+ and WT p53 cases. Conclusions: Patients with HPV+ OPSCC have an excellent prognosis after radiochemotherapy, but cisplatin-based chemotherapy may not confer a satisfactory outcome, especially in WT cases, thereby justifying the additional or alternative use of taxanes and epidermal growth factor receptors inhibitors. Uncommon distant metastases and second tumors in the HPV+ group may be cause for clinicians to review the follow-up policies in these patients.Â«Â less\n\nDriver mutations in TP53 are ubiquitous in high grade serous carcinoma of the ovary.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmed, Ahmed Ashour; Etemadmoghadam, Dariush; Temple, Jillian; Lynch, Andy G; Riad, Mohamed; Sharma, Raghwa; Stewart, Colin; Fereday, Sian; Caldas, Carlos; Defazio, Anna; Bowtell, David; Brenton, James D\n\n2010-05-01\n\nNumerous studies have tested the association between TP53 mutations in ovarian cancer and prognosis but these have been consistently confounded by limitations in study design, methodology, and/or heterogeneity in the sample cohort. High-grade serous (HGS) carcinoma is the most clinically important histological subtype of ovarian cancer. As these tumours may arise from the ovary, Fallopian tube or peritoneum, they are collectively referred to as high-grade pelvic serous carcinoma (HGPSC). To identify the true prevalence of TP53 mutations in HGPSC, we sequenced exons 2-11 and intron-exon boundaries in tumour DNA from 145 patients. HGPSC cases were defined as having histological grade 2 or 3 and FIGO stage III or IV. Surprisingly, pathogenic TP53 mutations were identified in 96.7% (n = 119/123) of HGPSC cases. Molecular and pathological review of mutation-negative cases showed evidence of p53 dysfunction associated with copy number gain of MDM2 or MDM4, or indicated the exclusion of samples as being low-grade serous tumours or carcinoma of uncertain primary site. Overall, p53 dysfunction rate approached 100% of confirmed HGPSCs. No association between TP53 mutation and progression-free or overall survival was found. From this first comprehensive mapping of TP53 mutation rate in a homogeneous group of HGPSC patients, we conclude that mutant TP53 is a driver mutation in the pathogenesis of HGPSC cancers. Because TP53 mutation is almost invariably present in HGPSC, it is not of substantial prognostic or predictive significance. Copyright (c) 2010 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

The reasons for these differences are not clear, and molecular differences between HIV-related HNSCC and non-HIV-related HNSCC may exist. This study compared the mutational patterns of HIV-related HNSCC and non-HIV-related HNSCC. The DNA of 20 samples of HIV-related HNSCCs and 32 samples of non-HIV-related HNSCCs was sequenced. DNA libraries covering exons of 18 genes frequently mutated in HNSCC (AJUBA, CASP8, CCND1, CDKN2A, EGFR, FAT1, FBXW7, HLA-A, HRAS, KEAP1, NFE2L2, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NSD1, PIK3CA, TGFBR2, TP53, and TP63) were prepared and sequenced on an Ion Personal Genome Machine sequencer. DNA sequencing data were analyzed with Ion Reporter software. The human papillomavirus (HPV) status of the tumor samples was assessed with in situ hybridization, the MassARRAY HPV multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay, and p16 immunostaining. Mutation calls were compared among the studied groups. HIV-related HNSCC revealed a distinct pattern of mutations in comparison with non-HIV-related HNSCC. TP53 mutation frequencies were significantly lower in HIV-related HNSCC. Mutations in HIV+ patients tended to be TpC>T nucleotide changes for all mutated genes but especially for TP53. HNSCC in HIVIIs presents a distinct pattern of genetic mutations, particularly in the TP53 gene. HIV-related HNSCC may have a distinct biology, and an effect of the HIV virus on the pathogenesis of these tumors should not be ruled out. Cancer 2018;124:84-94. Â© 2017 American Cancer Society.

Previous studies comparing the frequency of KRAS and TP53 mutations in IBD-CRC and S-CRC were inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the presence of KRAS and TP53 mutations among patients with IBD-CRC, S-CRC, and IBD without dysplasia. A total of 19 publications (482 patients with IBD-CRC, 4,222 with S-CRC, 281 with IBD without dysplasia) met the study inclusion criteria. KRAS mutation was less frequent (RR=0.71, 95%CI 0.56-0.90; P=0.004) while TP53 mutation was more common (RR=1.24, 95%CI 1.10-1.39; P<0.001) in patients with IBD-CRC compared to S-CRC. Both KRAS (RR=3.09, 95%CI 1.47-6.51; P=0.003) and TP53 (RR=2.15, 95%CI 1.07-4.31 P=0.03) mutations were more prevalent in patients with IBD-CRC compared to IBD without dysplasia. In conclusion, IBD-CRC and S-CRC appear to have biologically different molecular pathways. TP53 appears to be more important than KRAS in IBD-CRC compared to S-CRC. Our findings suggest possible roles of TP53 and KRAS as biomarkers for cancer and dysplasia screening among patients with IBD and may also provide targeted therapy in patients with IBD-CRC.

FGFR3 mutations are most frequent in low-grade low-stage tumours, whereas TP53 mutations are most frequent in high-grade high-stage tumours. Several studies have reported FGFR3 and TP53 mutations to be mutually exclusive events, whereas others have reported them to be independent. We carried out a meta-analysis of published findings for FGFR3 and TP53 mutations in bladder cancer (535 tumours, 6 publications) and additional unpublished data for 382 tumours. TP53 and FGFR3 mutations were not independent events for all tumours considered together (ORâ=â0.25 [0.18-0.37], pâ=â0.0001) or for pT1 tumours alone (ORâ=â0.47 [0.28-0.79], pâ=â0.0009). However, if the analysis was restricted to pTa tumours or to muscle-invasive tumours alone, FGFR3 and TP53 mutations were independent events (ORâ=â0.56 [0.23-1.36] (pâ=â0.12) and ORâ=â0.99 [0.37-2.7] (pâ=â0.35), respectively). After stratification of the tumours by stage and grade, no dependence was detected in the five tumour groups considered (pTaG1 and pTaG2 together, pTaG3, pT1G2, pT1G3, pT2-4). These differences in findings can be attributed to the putative existence of two different pathways of tumour progression in bladder cancer: the CIS pathway, in which FGFR3 mutations are rare, and the Ta pathway, in which FGFR3 mutations are frequent. TP53 mutations occur at the earliest stage of the CIS pathway, whereas they occur would much later in the Ta pathway, at the T1G3 or muscle-invasive stage.\n\nMutations in TP53 and JAK2 are independent prognostic biomarkers in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nForero-Castro, Maribel; Robledo, Cristina; Benito, RocÃ­o; Bodega-Mayor, Irene; Rapado, Inmaculada; HernÃ¡ndez-SÃ¡nchez, MarÃ­a; AbÃ¡igar, MarÃ­a; Maria HernÃ¡ndez-SÃ¡nchez, JesÃºs; Quijada-Ãlamo, Miguel; MarÃ­a SÃ¡nchez-Pina, JosÃ©; Sala-ValdÃ©s, MÃ³nica; Araujo-Silva, Fernanda; Kohlmann, Alexander; Luis Fuster, JosÃ©; Arefi, Maryam; de Las Heras, Natalia; Riesco, Susana; RodrÃ­guez, Juan N; HermosÃ­n, Lourdes; Ribera, Jordi; Camos Guijosa, Mireia; RamÃ­rez, Manuel; de Heredia Rubio, Cristina DÃ­az; BarragÃ¡n, Eva; MartÃ­nez, JoaquÃ­n; Ribera, JosÃ© M; FernÃ¡ndez-Ruiz, Elena; HernÃ¡ndez-Rivas, JesÃºs-MarÃ­a\n\n2017-07-11\n\nIn B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), the identification of additional genetic alterations associated with poor prognosis is still of importance. We determined the frequency and prognostic impact of somatic mutations in children and adult cases with B-ALL treated with Spanish PETHEMA and SEHOP protocols. Mutational status of hotspot regions of TP53, JAK2, PAX5, LEF1, CRLF2 and IL7R genes was determined by next-generation deep sequencing in 340 B-ALL patients (211 children and 129 adults). The associations between mutation status and clinicopathological features at the time of diagnosis, treatment outcome and survival were assessed. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors associated with overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse rate (RR). A mutation rate of 12.4% was identified. The frequency of adult mutations was higher (20.2% vs 7.6%, P=0.001). TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene (4.1%), followed by JAK2 (3.8%), CRLF2 (2.9%), PAX5 (2.4%), LEF1 (0.6%) and IL7R (0.3%). All mutations were observed in B-ALL without ETV6-RUNX1 (P=0.047) or BCR-ABL1 fusions (P<0.0001). In children, TP53mut was associated with lower OS (5-year OS: 50% vs 86%, P=0.002) and EFS rates (5-year EFS: 50% vs 78.3%, P=0.009) and higher RR (5-year RR: 33.3% vs 18.6% P=0.037), and was independently associated with higher RR (hazard ratio (HR)=4.5; P=0.04). In adults, TP53mut was associated with a lower OS (5-year OS: 0% vs 43.3%, P=0.019) and a higher RR (5-year RR: 100% vs 61.4%, P=0.029), whereas JAK2mut was associated with a lower EFS (5-year EFS: 0% vs 30.6%, P=0.035) and a higher RR (5-year RR: 100% vs 60.4%, P=0.002). TP53mut was an independent risk factor for shorter OS (HR=2.3; P=0.035) and, together with JAK2mut, also were independent markers of poor prognosis for RR (TP53mut: HR=5.9; P=0.027 and JAK2mut: HR=5.6; P=0.036).

Methods 450 pre-therapeutic, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core biopsies from the phase II neoadjuvant GeparSixto trial that included HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) were subjected to Sanger sequencing of exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene. TP53 status was correlated to response to neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy with or without carboplatin and trastuzumab/lapatinib in HER2-positive and bevacizumab in TNBC. p53 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the TNBC subgroup. Results Of 450 breast cancer samples 297 (66.0%) were TP53 mutant. Mutations were significantly more frequent in TNBC (74.8%) compared to HER2-positive cancers (55.4%, P < 0.0001). Neither mutations nor different mutation types and effects were associated with pCR neither in the whole study group nor in molecular subtypes (P > 0.05 each). Missense mutations tended to be associated with a better survival compared to all other types of mutations in TNBC (P = 0.093) and in HER2-positive cancers (P = 0.071). In TNBC, missense mutations were also linked to higher numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs, P = 0.028). p53 protein overexpression was also linked with imporved survival (P = 0.019). Conclusions Our study confirms high TP53 mutation rates in TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer.

This study sought to investigate the role of one-off non-contrast whole-body MRI (WB MRI) in the screening of asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers. 44 TP53 mutation carriers and 44 population controls were recruited. Scans were read by radiologists blinded to participant carrier status. The incidence of malignancies diagnosed in TP53 mutation carriers against general population controls was calculated. The incidences of non-malignant relevant disease and irrelevant disease were measured, as well as the number of investigations required to determine relevance of findings. In TP53 mutation carriers, 6 of 44 (13.6, 95% CI 5.2-27.4%) participants were diagnosed with cancer during the study, all of which would be considered life threatening if untreated. Two were found to have two primary cancers. Two participants with cancer had abnormalities on the MRI which were initially thought to be benign (a pericardial cyst and a uterine fibroid) but transpired to be sarcomas. No controls were diagnosed with cancer. Fifteen carriers (34.1, 95% CI 20.5-49.9%) and seven controls (15.9, 95% CI 6.7-30.1%) underwent further investigations following the WB MRI for abnormalities that transpired to be benign (pâ=â0.049). The cancer detection rate in this group justifies a minimum baseline non-contrast WB MRI in germline TP53 mutation carriers. This should be adopted into national guidelines for management of adult TP53 mutation carriers in addition to the current practice of contrast enhanced breast MRI imaging.\n\nSignificance of TP53 Mutation in Wilms Tumors with Diffuse Anaplasia: A Report from the Children's Oncology Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nOoms, Ariadne H A G; Gadd, Samantha; Gerhard, Daniela S; Smith, Malcolm A; Guidry Auvil, Jaime M; Meerzaman, Daoud; Chen, Qing-Rong; Hsu, Chih Hao; Yan, Chunhua; Nguyen, Cu; Hu, Ying; Ma, Yussanne; Zong, Zusheng; Mungall, Andrew J; Moore, Richard A; Marra, Marco A; Huff, Vicki; Dome, Jeffrey S; Chi, Yueh-Yun; Tian, Jing; Geller, James I; Mullighan, Charles G; Ma, Jing; Wheeler, David A; Hampton, Oliver A; Walz, Amy L; van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M; de Krijger, Ronald R; Ross, Nicole; Gastier-Foster, Julie M; Perlman, Elizabeth J\n\n2016-11-15\n\nTo investigate the role and significance of TP53 mutation in diffusely anaplastic Wilms tumors (DAWTs). All DAWTs registered on National Wilms Tumor Study-5 (n = 118) with available samples were analyzed for TP53 mutations and copy loss. Integrative genomic analysis was performed on 39 selected DAWTs. Following analysis of a single random sample, 57 DAWTs (48%) demonstrated TP53 mutations, 13 (11%) copy loss without mutation, and 48 (41%) lacked both [defined as TP53-wild-type (wt)]. Patients with stage III/IV TP53-wt DAWTs (but not those with stage I/II disease) had significantly lower relapse and death rates than those with TP53 abnormalities. In-depth analysis of a subset of 39 DAWTs showed seven (18%) to be TP53-wt: These demonstrated gene expression evidence of an active p53 pathway. Retrospective pathology review of TP53-wt DAWT revealed no or very low volume of anaplasia in six of seven tumors. When samples from TP53-wt tumors known to contain anaplasia histologically were available, abnormal p53 protein accumulation was observed by immunohistochemistry. These data support the key role of TP53 loss in the development of anaplasia in WT, and support its significant clinical impact in patients with residual anaplastic tumor following surgery. These data also suggest that most DAWTs will show evidence of TP53 mutation when samples selected for the presence of anaplasia are analyzed. This suggests that modifications of the current criteria to also consider volume of anaplasia and documentation of TP53 aberrations may better reflect the risk of relapse and death and enable optimization of therapeutic stratification.

However, almost all studies of TP53 gene abnormality so far have been limited to mutation searches in the DNA binding domain. As there have been few reports examining both mutation and deletion over the full-length of the TP53 gene, the clinical characteristics of TP53 gene abnormality have not yet been clearly established. In this study, TP53 gene mutation was observed in 7.3% of the total 412 de novo AML cases (33 mutations in 30 cases), with mutation outside the DNA binding domain in eight cases (27%). TP53 gene deletion was observed in 3.1% of 358 cases. All cases had monoallelic deletion with TP53 gene mutation on the opposite allele. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that TP53 gene mutation in the DNA binding domain and outside the DNA binding domain was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and relapse-free survival among the total cohort and it is also an unfavorable prognostic factor in FLT3-ITD-negative AML cases aged 70Â years or below with intermediate cytogenetic prognosis. In stratified treatment, full-length search for TP53 gene mutation is therefore very important.\n\nPrognostic and predictive value of TP53 mutations in node-positive breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline- or anthracycline/taxane-based adjuvant therapy: results from the BIG 02-98 phase III trial\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbstract Introduction Pre-clinical data suggest p53-dependent anthracycline-induced apoptosis and p53-independent taxane activity. However, dedicated clinical research has not defined a predictive role for TP53 gene mutations. The aim of the current study was to retrospectively explore the prognosis and predictive values of TP53 somatic mutations in the BIG 02-98 randomized phase III trial in which women with node-positive breast cancer were treated with adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy with or without docetaxel. Methods The prognostic and predictive values of TP53 were analyzed in tumor samples by gene sequencing within exons 5 to 8. Patients were classified according to p53 protein status predicted from TP53 gene sequence, as wild-type (no TP53 variation or TP53 variations which are predicted not to modify p53 protein sequence) or mutant (p53 nonsynonymous mutations). Mutations were subcategorized according to missense or truncating mutations. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox-regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of outcome. Results TP53 gene status was determined for 18% (520 of 2887) of the women enrolled in BIG 02-98. TP53 gene variations were found in 17% (90 of 520). Nonsynonymous p53 mutations, found in 16.3% (85 of 520), were associated with older age, ductal morphology, higher grade and hormone-receptor negativity. Of the nonsynonymous mutations, 12.3% (64 of 520) were missense and 3.6% were truncating (19 of 520). Only truncating mutations showed significant independent prognostic value, with an increased recurrence risk compared to patients with non-modified p53 protein (hazard ratio = 3.21, 95% confidence interval = 1.740 to 5.935, P = 0.0002). p53 status had no significant predictive value for response to docetaxel. Conclusions p53 truncating mutations were uncommon but associated with poor prognosis. No significant predictive role for p53 status was detected.

TP53 and FGFR3 mutations were not independent events for all tumours considered together (ORâ=â0.25 [0.18â0.37], pâ=â0.0001) or for pT1 tumours alone (ORâ=â0.47 [0.28â0.79], pâ=â0.0009). However, if the analysis was restricted to pTa tumours or to muscle-invasive tumours alone, FGFR3 and TP53 mutations were independent events (ORâ=â0.56 [0.23â1.36] (pâ=â0.12) and ORâ=â0.99 [0.37â2.7] (pâ=â0.35), respectively). After stratification of the tumours by stage and grade, no dependence was detected in the five tumour groups considered (pTaG1 and pTaG2 together, pTaG3, pT1G2, pT1G3, pT2-4). These differences in findings can be attributed to the putative existence of two different pathways of tumour progression in bladder cancer: the CIS pathway, in which FGFR3 mutations are rare, and the Ta pathway, in which FGFR3 mutations are frequent. TP53 mutations occur at the earliest stage of the CIS pathway, whereas they occur would much later in the Ta pathway, at the T1G3 or muscle-invasive stage.

We characterize head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with different HPV16 DNA and RNA (E6*I) status from 290 consecutively recruited patients by gene expression profiling and targeted sequencing of 50 genes. We show that tumors with transcriptionally inactive HPV16 (DNA+ RNA-) are similar to HPV-negative (DNA-) tumors regarding gene expression and frequency of TP53 mutations (47%, 8/17 and 43%, 72/167, respectively). We also find that an immune response-related gene expression cluster is associated with lymph node metastasis, independent of HPV16 status and that disruptive TP53 mutations are associated with lymph node metastasis in HPV16 DNA- tumors. We validate each of these associations in another large data set. Four gene expression clusters which we identify differ moderately but significantly in overall survival. Our findings underscore the importance of measuring the HPV16 RNA (E6*I) and TP53-mutation status for patient stratification and identify associations of an immune response-related gene expression cluster and TP53 mutations with lymph node metastasis in HNSCC.

In this study we examined the potential effect of Wee1 kinase inhibition on inducing replication stress in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods and Materials: Five independent datasets from the Oncomine database comparing gene expression in HCC compared to normal tissue were combined and specific markers associated with Wee1 sensitivity were analyzed. We then performed a series of inÂ vitro experiments to study the effect of Wee1 inhibition on irradiated HCC cell lines with varying p53 mutational status. Clonogenic survival assays and flow cytometry using anti-Î³H2AX and phospho-histone H3moreÂ Â» antibodies with propidium iodide were performed to study the effect of AZD1775 on survival, cell cycle, and DNA repair. Additionally, nucleoside enriched medium was used to examine the effect of altering nucleotide pools on Wee1 targeted radiation sensitization. Results: Our analysis of the Oncomine database found high levels of CDK1 and other cell cycle regulators indicative of Wee1 sensitivity in HCC. In our inÂ vitro experiments, treatment with AZD1775 radiosensitized and chemosensitized Hep3B, Huh7, and HepG2 cell lines and was associated with delayed resolution of Î³H2AX foci and the induction of pan-nuclear Î³H2AX staining. Wee1 inhibition attenuated radiation-induced G{sub 2} arrest in the Hep3B (TP53 null) and Huh7 (TP53 mutant) cell lines but not in the TP53 wild-type cell line HepG2. Supplementation with nucleosides reversed the radiation-sensitizing effect of AZD1775 and reduced the amount of cells with pan-nuclear Î³H2AX staining after radiation. Conclusions: Radiation sensitization with Wee1 inhibition occurs in cells regardless of their p53 mutational status. In this study we show for the first time that replication stress via the overconsumption of nucleotides plays an important role in AZD1775-induced radiation sensitization.Â«Â less\n\nBRCA1, TP53, and CHEK2 germline mutations in uterine serous carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nPennington, Kathryn P; Walsh, Tom; Lee, Ming; Pennil, Christopher; Novetsky, Akiva P; Agnew, Kathy J; Thornton, Anne; Garcia, Rochelle; Mutch, David; King, Mary-Claire; Goodfellow, Paul; Swisher, Elizabeth M\n\n2013-01-15\n\nUterine serous carcinoma (USC) is not recognized as part of any defined hereditary cancer syndrome, and its association with hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma and Lynch syndrome are uncertain. Using targeted capture and massively parallel genomic sequencing, 151 subjects with USC were assessed for germline mutations in 30 tumor suppressor genes, including BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset), BRCA2, the DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1 [mutL homolog 1], MSH2 [mutS homolog 2], MSH6, PMS2 [postmeiotic segregation increased 2]), TP53 (tumor protein p53), and 10 other genes in the Fanconi anemia-BRCA pathway. Ten cases with < 10% serous histology were also assessed. Seven subjects (4.6%) carried germline loss-of-function mutations: 3 subjects (2.0%) with mutations in BRCA1, 2 subjects (1.3%) with mutations in TP53, and 2 subjects (1.3%) with mutations in CHEK2 (checkpoint kinase 2). One subject with < 10% serous histology had an MSH6 mutation. Subjects with MSH6 and TP53 mutations had neither personal nor family histories suggestive of Lynch or Li-Fraumeni syndromes. Of the 22 women with USC and a personal history of breast carcinoma, the frequency of BRCA1 mutations was 9%, compared to 0.9% in 119 women with no such history. Approximately 5% of women with USC have germline mutations in 3 different tumor suppressor genes: BRCA1, CHEK2, and TP53. Mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes that cause Lynch syndrome are rare in USC. The germline BRCA1 mutation rate in USC subjects of 2% is higher than expected in a nonfounder population, suggesting that USC is associated with hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma in a small proportion of cases. Women with USC and breast cancer should be offered genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.

Experimental Design All DAWTs registered on National Wilms Tumor Study-5 (n=118) with available samples were analyzed for TP53 mutations and copy loss. Integrative genomic analysis was performed on 39 selected DAWTs. Results Following analysis of a single random sample, 57 DAWT (48%) demonstrated TP53 mutations, 13(11%) copy loss without mutation, and 48(41%) lacked both (defined as TP53-wildtype (wt)). Patients with Stage III/IV TP53-wt DAWTs (but not those with Stage I/II disease) had significantly lower relapse and death rates than those with TP53 abnormalities. In-depth analysis of a subset of 39 DAWT showed 7(18%) to be TP53-wt: these demonstrated gene expression evidence of an active p53 pathway. Retrospective pathology review of TP53-wt DAWT revealed no or very low volume of anaplasia in 6/7 tumors. When samples from TP53-wt tumors known to contain anaplasia histologically were available, abnormal p53 protein accumulation was observed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion These data support the key role of TP53 loss in the development of anaplasia in WT, and support its significant clinical impact in patients with residual anaplastic tumor following surgery. These data also suggest that most DAWTs will show evidence of TP53 mutation when samples selected for the presence of anaplasia are analyzed. This suggests that modifications of the current criteria to also consider volume of anaplasia and documentation of TP53 aberrations may better reflect the risk of relapse and death and enable optimization of therapeutic stratification.

In the current study, we evaluated a novel computational approach termed Evolutionary Action (EAp53) to stratify patients with tumors harboring TP53 mutations as high or low risk, and validated this system in both in vivo and in vitro models. Patients with high risk TP53 mutations had the poorest survival outcomes and the shortest time to the development of distant metastases. Tumor cells expressing high risk TP53 mutations were more invasive and tumorigenic and they exhibited a higher incidence of lung metastases. We also documented an association between the presence of high risk mutations and decreased expression of TP53 target genes, highlighting key cellular pathways that are likely to be dysregulated by this subset of p53 mutations which confer particularly aggressive tumor behavior. Overall, our work validated EAp53 as a novel computational tool that may be useful in clinical prognosis of tumors harboring p53 mutations.

We utilized a two-stage SNP association study to detect variants associated with breast cancer survival in a TP53-dependent manner. Initially, a genome-wide study (n = 575 cases) was conducted to discover candidate SNPs for genotyping and validation in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The SNPs were then tested for interaction with tumor TP53 status (n = 4,610) and anthracycline treatment (n = 17,828). For SNPs interacting with anthracycline treatment, siRNA knockdown experiments were carried out to validate candidate genes. In the test for interaction between SNP genotype and TP53 status, we identified one locus, represented by rs10916264 (p(interaction) = 3.44 05E010-5; FDR-adjusted p = 0.0011) in estrogen receptor (ER) positive cases. The rs10916264 AA genotype associated with worse survival among cases with ER-positive, TP53-positive tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 2.36, 95% confidence interval [C.I] 1.45 - 3.82). This is a cis-eQTL locus for FBXO28 and TP53BP2; expression levels of these genes were associated with patient survival specifically in ER-positive, TP53-mutated tumors. Additionally, the SNP rs798755 was associated with survival in interaction with anthracycline treatment (p(interaction) = 9.57 05E010-5, FDR-adjusted p = 0.0130). RNAi-based depletion of a predicted regulatory target gene, FAM53A, indicated that this gene can modulate doxorubicin sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines. If confirmed in independent data sets, these results may be of clinical relevance in the development of prognostic and predictive marker panels for breast cancer.
