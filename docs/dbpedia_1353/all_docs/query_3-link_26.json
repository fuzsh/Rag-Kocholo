        "text": "Fractures in pituitary adenoma patients from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Varsseveld, N C; van Bunderen, C C; Franken, A A M; Koppeschaar, H P F; van der Lely, A J; Drent, M L\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe effects of growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy on fracture risk in adult GH deficient (GHD) patients with different etiologies of pituitary GHD are not well known, due to limited data. The aim of this study was to investigate characteristics and fracture occurrence at start of (baseline) and during long-term GH replacement therapy in GHD adults previously treated for Cushing's disease (CD) or acromegaly, compared to patients with previous nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA). From the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults, a nationwide surveillance study in severe GHD adults, all patients using â¥30Â days of GH replacement therapy with previous NFPA (nÂ =Â 783), CD (nÂ =Â 180) and acromegaly (nÂ =Â 65) were selected. Patient characteristics, fractures and potential influencing factors were investigated. At baseline, patients with previous CD were younger, more often female and had more often a history of osteopenia or osteoporosis, whereas patients with previous acromegaly had more often received cranial radiotherapy and a longer duration between treatment of their pituitary tumor and start of adult GH replacement therapy. During follow-up, a fracture occurred in 3.8Â % (nÂ =Â 39) of all patients. Compared to patients with previous NFPA, only patients with previous acromegaly had an increased fracture risk after 6Â years of GH replacement therapy. During GH replacement therapy, an increased fracture risk was observed in severe GHD adult patients previously treated for acromegaly, but not in those previously treated for CD, compared to severe GHD adult patients using GH replacement therapy because of previous NFPA. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to elucidate potential underlying mechanisms.\n\nRegulation of fuel metabolism during exercise in hypopituitarism with growth hormone-deficiency (GHD).\n\nPubMed\n\nZueger, Thomas; Loher, Hannah; Egger, Andrea; Boesch, Chris; Christ, Emanuel\n\n2016-08-01\n\nGrowth hormone (GH) has a strong lipolytic action and its secretion is increased during exercise. Data on fuel metabolism and its hormonal regulation during prolonged exercise in patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is scarce. This study aimed at evaluating the hormonal and metabolic response during aerobic exercise in GHD patients. Ten patients with confirmed GHD and 10 healthy control individuals (CI) matched for age, sex, BMI, and waist performed a spiroergometric test to determine exercise capacity (VO2max). Throughout a subsequent 120-minute exercise on an ergometer at 50% of individual VO2max free fatty acids (FFA), glucose, GH, cortisol, catecholamines and insulin were measured. Additionally substrate oxidation assessed by indirect calorimetry was determined at begin and end of exercise. Exercise capacity was lower in GHD compared to CI (VO2max 35.5Â±7.4 vs 41.5Â±5.5ml/minâkg, p=0.05). GH area under the curve (AUC-GH), peak-GH and peak-FFA were lower in GHD patients during exercise compared to CI (AUC-GH 100Â±93.2 vs 908.6Â±623.7ngâmin/ml, p<0.001; peak-GH 1.5Â±1.53 vs 12.57Â±9.36ng/ml, p<0.001, peak-FFA 1.01Â±0.43 vs 1.51Â±0.56mmol/l, p=0.036, respectively). There were no significant differences for insulin, cortisol, catecholamines and glucose. Fat oxidation at the end of exercise was higher in CI compared to GHD patients (295.7Â±73.9 vs 187.82Â±103.8kcal/h, p=0.025). A reduced availability of FFA during a 2-hour aerobic exercise and a reduced fat oxidation at the end of exercise may contribute to the decreased exercise capacity in GHD patients. Catecholamines and cortisol do not compensate for the lack of the lipolytic action of GH in patients with GHD. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our increasing understanding of the factors involved in the development of somatotropes and the dynamic function of the somatotrope network may explain, at least in part, the development and progression of childhood GHD in different age groups. With respect to the genetic etiology of isolated GHD (IGHD), mutations in known genes such as those encoding GH (GH1), GHRH receptor (GHRHR), or transcription factors involved in pituitary development, are identified in a relatively small percentage of patients suggesting the involvement of other, yet unidentified, factors. Genome-wide association studies point toward an increasing number of genes involved in the control of growth, but their role in the etiology of IGHD remains unknown. Despite the many years of research in the area of GHD, there are still controversies on the etiology, diagnosis, and management of IGHD in children. Recent data suggest that childhood IGHD may have a wider impact on the health and neurodevelopment of children, but it is yet unknown to what extent treatment with recombinant human GH can reverse this effect. Finally, the safety of recombinant human GH is currently the subject of much debate and research, and it is clear that long-term controlled studies are needed to clarify the consequences of childhood IGHD and the long-term safety of its treatment.\n\nExtensive expertise in endocrinology: UK stance on adult GH replacement: the economist vs the endocrinologist.\n\nPubMed\n\nShalet, S M\n\n2013-10-01\n\nIn the UK, through the use of a forced economic model, endocrinologists are in the curious position of offering GH replacement to some patients with severe GH deficiency (GHD) but withholding it from other patients with even more severe GHD. This approach is counter-intuitive to endocrine practice in treating endocrine deficiency states. For all other endocrine deficiencies, one would opt for treating those with the most severe biochemical evidence of deficiency first. If this endocrine approach was applied to adult GH replacement in an era of rationing, one would start with the GHD patients with a pathologically low IGF1 level. Given that the prevalence of subnormal IGF1 levels in a GHD population is age-dependent, this would result in GH replacement being offered to more young adult onset (AO) GHD and childhood onset GHD adults, and less often to middle-aged and elderly AO GHD adults. This in itself has the added advantage that the skeletal benefits appear more real in the former cohort of patients.\n\nDeregulation of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis in adults with cystic fibrosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPascucci, C; De Biase, R V; Savi, D; Quattrucci, S; Isidori, A M; Lubrano, C; Gnessi, L; Lenzi, A\n\n2018-05-01\n\nPatients with cystic fibrosis (CF) present with signs and symptoms that overlap with those of adult growth hormone deficiency (GHD) syndrome: loss of muscle mass, bone fragility and lower stress tolerance. In literature, the prevalence of GHD in pediatric CF patients is higher than general population, but these studies have been performed on children with growth delay. To our knowledge, there are no studies on adult patients. The aim of this paper is to evaluate GH-IGF1 axis in an adult CF population. Fifty clinically stable adult patients, 30 males; age 36Â Â±Â 2Â years; BMI 21.39Â Â±Â 0.22Â kg/m 2 and FEV 1 67Â Â±Â 4% were studied. Data regarding glycometabolic status and results of pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, gonadal and adrenal function tests were recorded. All patients underwent a GH releasing hormone (GHRH)Â +Â Arginine stimulation test to confirm a GHD. GHRHÂ +Â Arginine test revealed the presence of GHD in 16 patients (32%); specifically 7 patients had a severe deficiency and 9 a partial deficiency. Adult patients with CF may show GHD. These patients should be followed over time to assess if the GHD could impact the clinical progression of CF.\n\nAssociation between l-thyroxine treatment, GH deficiency, and radiological vertebral fractures in patients with adult-onset hypopituitarism.\n\nPubMed\n\nMazziotti, G; Mormando, M; Cristiano, A; Bianchi, A; Porcelli, T; Giampietro, A; Maffezzoni, F; Serra, V; De Marinis, L; Giustina, A\n\n2014-06-01\n\nIn this study, we aimed at evaluating the association between radiological vertebral fractures and levo-thyroxine (l-T4) replacement doses in adult patients with hypopituitarism. Cross-sectional study. We studied 74 adult hypopituitary patients (males, 43; females, 31; mean age, 57 years; and range, 23-79) with central hypothyroidism treated with l-T4 (median daily dose: 1.1 âÎ¼g/kg). All patients also had severe GH deficiency (GHD) and 38 of them were replaced with recombinant GH. Vertebral fractures were assessed by a quantitative morphometric analysis performed on thoracic and lumbar spine lateral X-ray. Radiological vertebral fractures were found in 23 patients (31.1%) in association with untreated GHD (P=0.02), higher serum free T4 levels (P=0.03), a higher daily dose of l-T4 (P=0.005), and a longer duration of hypopituitarism (P=0.05). When GHD was treated, the prevalence of vertebral fractures was more frequent (P=0.03) in patients receiving high l-T4 doses (third tertile: >1.35â Î¼g/kg per day) as compared with patients who were treated with lower drug doses (first tertile: <0.93 âÎ¼g/kg per day). Such a difference was not observed in patients with untreated GHD who showed a higher prevalence of vertebral fractures regardless of l-T4 daily doses. Multivariate analysis showed that untreated GHD (odds ratio: 4.27, 95% CI 1.27-14.33; P=0.01) and the daily dose of l-T4 (odds ratio: 4.01, 95% CI 1.16-14.39; P=0.03) maintained a significant and independent association with vertebral fractures in patients with central hypothyroidism. Our data suggest for the first time that a relative overtreatment with l-T4 may influence the fracture risk in some patients with hypopituitarism.

A secondary objective was to determine the accuracy of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels in predicting GHD in patients with TBI. Anterior pituitary function was assessed in 235 adult patients with TBI through evaluation of fasting morning hormone levels. GH levels were assessed through provocative testing, specifically the glucagon stimulation test. GHD was diagnosed in a significant number of patients, with 45% falling into the severe GHD (â¤3âÎ¼g/L) category. IGF-1 levels were not predictive of GHD. Patients with GHD were more disabled and less independent compared with those patients who were not GHD. Those patients with more severe GHD also showed decreased levels of cortisol and testosterone. Symptoms of depression were also more prevalent in this group. In addition, patients with severe GHD had delayed admission to post-acute rehabilitation. This study confirms the high prevalence of GHD in patients with TBI and the necessity to monitor clinical symptoms and perform provocative testing to definitively diagnose GHD. PMID:26414093\n\nImpaired quality of life in growth hormone-deficient adults is independent of the altered skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism found in conditions with peripheral fatigue.\n\nPubMed\n\nSinha, Akash; Hollingsworth, Kieren G; Ball, Steve; Cheetham, Tim\n\n2014-01-01\n\nGrowth hormone-deficient (GHD) adults often report impaired quality of life (QoL) - with fatigue, a key element. This deficit can improve following GH replacement. The basis of this response is unclear. Perturbations in skeletal muscle metabolism have been demonstrated in several conditions in which fatigue is a prominent symptom. We wished to define the role of skeletal muscle metabolism in the impaired QoL observed in patients with GHD. To compare in vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation using phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy in matched untreated GHD adults, treated GHD adults and healthy volunteers. Twenty-two untreated GHD adults, 23 treated GHD adults and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited at a regional centre. All patients underwent assessment of muscle mitochondrial function (Ïâ/â PCr) and proton handling using spectroscopy. Fasting biochemical analyses and anthropometric measurement were obtained. All patients completed the QoL-AGHDA and physical activity assessment (IPAQ) questionnaires. Untreated and treated GHD adults complained of significantly increased fatigue and an impaired QoL (P = 0Â·002) when compared to healthy controls. There was no difference in maximal mitochondrial function (P = 0Â·53) nor pH recovery (P = 0Â·38) of skeletal muscle between the three groups. Untreated GHD patients had significantly lower IGF-1 than both treated GHD and healthy volunteers (P < 0Â·001), but there was no association between Ïâ/â PCr and serum IGF-1 (r = -0Â·13, P = 0Â·32). The impaired QoL seen in GHD adults is not associated with the skeletal muscle spectroscopic 'footprint' of altered mitochondrial oxidative function, anaerobic glycolysis or proton clearance that are a feature of several conditions in which fatigue is a prominent feature. These data suggest that the pathophysiology of fatigue and impaired QoL in GHD may have a significant central rather than peripheral (skeletal muscle) component.

In the present study we evaluated the QoL and the perception of the effect of former GH treatment in Belgian young adults with childhood GHD. Thirty-six patients (22 males) were included in the study. They all were treated during childhood with GH for GHD. QoL was evaluated with a standardised questionnaire: the Quality of Life Assessment of Growth Hormone Deficiency in Adults (QoL-AGHDA). Psychosocial functioning, sexual experience and schooling were evaluated by semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The influence of gender, type of hormone deficiency (isolated GHD vs multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies [MPHD]), age at the start of GH therapy (before 12 yr vs after 12 yr) and the height deficit at the start of GH therapy (< -3 SDS vs > -3 SDS) were studied. In addition, the patients' and parents' perception of height and of the effect of GH treatment was retrospectively evaluated by semi-structured interviews. Age (mean +/- SD) at the time of evaluation was 20.0 +/- 1.3 yr and final height was -0.5 +/- 0.9 SDS, comparable to mid-parental height (-0.6 +/- 0.8 SDS). The QoL-AGHDA score was 9 +/- 6. About half of the patients, especially those in whom GH treatment was started after the age of 12 years, complained of retrospective difficulties with self-confidence and social contact, and about one-quarter of the patients had current difficulties with self-confidence, social contact, contact with the opposite sex and with emotional life. Only 44% of the patients had had sexual intercourse--none of those with MPHD. According to the parents, the patients had and still have more difficulties with self-confidence and social contact than their siblings and/or peers, and they needed and still need more emotional support. In one out of four patients the parents expected\n\nLong-Acting C-Terminal Peptide-Modified hGH (MOD-4023): Results of a Safety and Dose-Finding Study in GHD Children.\n\nPubMed\n\nZelinska, Nataliya; Iotova, Violeta; Skorodok, Julia; Malievsky, Oleg; Peterkova, Valentina; Samsonova, Lubov; Rosenfeld, Ron G; Zadik, Zvi; Jaron-Mendelson, Michal; Koren, Ronit; Amitzi, Leanne; Raduk, Dmitri; Hershkovitz, Oren; Hart, Gili\n\n2017-05-01\n\nDaily injections are required for growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy, which may cause low compliance as a result of inconvenience and distress in patients. C-terminal peptide-modified human GH (MOD-4023) is developed for once-a-week dosing regimen in GH-deficient (GHD) adults and children. The present trial was a safety and dose-finding study for weekly MOD-4023 in GHD children. A multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled phase 2 study in children with GHD, evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of three different weekly MOD-4023 doses, compared with daily recombinant human GH (r-hGH). The trial was conducted in 14 endocrinology centers in Europe. Fifty-three prepubertal children with GHD completed 12 months of treatment with either MOD-4023 (N = 42) or r-hGH (N = 11). C-terminal peptide-modified hGH (MOD-4023) was administered weekly at a dose of either 0.25, 0.48, or 0.66 mg/kg/wk and compared with daily hGH at a dose of 0.24 mg/kg/wk. MOD-4023 showed an estimated half-life approximately fivefold to 10-fold longer when compared with daily r-hGH. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-binding peptide 3 showed a dose-dependent increase during MOD-4023 treatment. IGF-I standard deviation score for MOD-4023 did not exceed +2. All MOD-4023 cohorts demonstrated adequate catch-up growth. The 0.66 mg/kg/wk dose demonstrated efficacy closest to daily r-hGH. No serious adverse events were observed during MOD-4023 treatment, and its tolerability was consistent with known properties of r-hGH. This study confirms the long-acting properties of MOD-4023 and shows a promising safety and tolerability profile. This provides support for initiation of a phase 3 study in GHD children using a single weekly injection of MOD-4023.

Puberty is the most likely time for normalization of GH secretion. The objectives of this study are to establish the characteristics and the percentage of the subjects with isolated GHD who normalized secretion at puberty and to compare their statural outcomes with those of the subjects with persistent deficiency treated also after retesting. This was a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label study conducted in a university research hospital. Sixty-nine subjects (40 male, 29 female) with a diagnosis before puberty of isolated GHD by means of arginine and l-dopa tests were reevaluated with the same tests after at least 2 yr of therapy and after puberty onset. If GH peak at retesting was more than 10 microg/liter, therapy was withdrawn. Percentage and characteristics of normalized subjects at retesting, outcome of treatment in the subjects treated or untreated to adult height, and factors predictive of growth outcome were measured. At retesting, 44 subjects (63.7%) confirmed a GH peak less than 10 microg/liter (24 of 40 male and 20 of 29 female). Apart from a less delayed bone age at diagnosis in females, the subjects with confirmed GHD were not different at diagnosis from the other group for height deficit at diagnosis, first year growth response to GH, age and height at puberty onset, height, and IGF-I at retesting. Mean adult height was 165.1 +/- 4.5 cm in the male group treated until adult height vs. 164.0 +/- 3.4 cm in the group who suspended therapy at retesting. Mean adult height was 153.2 +/- 4.1 cm in the female group treated until adult height vs. 152.9 +/- 5.2 cm in the group that suspended therapy at retesting. As regards the parameters expressing the final outcome, the only difference was found in the mean increment adult height-target height sd score in\n\nThe Growth Hormone Research Society consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adult GH deficiency.\n\nPubMed\n\nHartman, M L\n\n1998-02-01\n\nThe Growth Hormone Research Society (GRS) convened a workshop in Port Stephens, Australia in April 1997 to establish consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with GH deficiency (GHD). Scientists with expertise in the field, representatives from industry involved in the manufacture of GH and representatives from health authorities from a number of countries participated in the workshop. The workshop considered the following questions: (1) How should adult GHD be defined? (2) Who should be tested for adult GHD? (3) How should the diagnosis of adult GHD be established? (4) How should GH and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) assays be standardized? (5) Who should be treated for adult GHD? (6) What dose of GH should be used for treatment of adult GHD? (7) How should treatment of adult GHD be monitored? (8) What are the contraindications to treatment of adult GHD? (9) What safety issues need to be considered? (10) How long should treatment of adult GHD be continued? The consensus guidelines developed at this workshop and the rationale for some of these recommendations will be reviewed in this paper.\n\nGrowth hormone (GH) effects on central fat accumulation in adult Japanese GH deficient patients: 6-month fixed-dose effects persist during second 6-month individualized-dose phase.\n\nPubMed\n\nChihara, Kazuo; Shimatsu, Akira; Kato, Yuzuru; Kohno, Hitoshi; Tanaka, Toshiaki; Takano, Kazue; Irie, Minoru\n\n2006-12-01\n\nBoth Japanese and Caucasian adults with GH deficiency (GHD) have pronounced abdominal obesity, which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular complications. We investigated the effects of GH treatment in 27 adult Japanese GHD patients, 15 with adult onset (AO) and 12 with childhood onset (CO) GHD. Patients initially received GH titrated to 0.012 mg/kg/day for 24 weeks in a double-blind design and the dose was then individualized for each patient according to IGF-I for a further 24 weeks. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data were evaluated for percentages of trunk fat, total body fat and lean body mass. Serum IGF-I and lipid concentrations were determined at a central laboratory. There were 25 patients who completed 48 weeks of treatment, with 7, 6 and 12 patients then receiving GH at 0.003, 0.006 and 0.012 mg/kg/day, respectively. With the reductions in dose when individualized between weeks 24 and 48, mean serum IGF-I level was reduced and excessively high values, observed in AO patients on the fixed GH dose, were no longer seen. The decrease from baseline in trunk fat was similar at week 24 (-3.8 +/- 3.3%, p<0.001) and week 48 (-3.1 +/- 3.7%, p<0.001), and the difference between changes was not significant. Total cholesterol was decreased from baseline by -24 +/- 28 mg/dl (p<0.001) at week 24 and -17 +/- 28 mg/dl (p = 0.007) at week 48. Two patients had elevated HbA1c levels: one continued GH treatment after a dose reduction and the other discontinued due to persistent impaired glucose tolerance. Therefore, excessively high IGF-I levels can be avoided by individualized dosing during long-term GH treatment. Individualized dosing maintains the decrease in abdominal fat in adult Japanese GHD patients and should reduce the cardiovascular risk.\n\nDirect and indirect effects of Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) on lung function in children: A mediation analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nCilluffo, Giovanna; Ferrante, Giuliana; Fasola, Salvatore; Ciresi, Alessandro; Cardillo, Irene; Tancredi, Giancarlo; Viegi, Giovanni; Giordano, Carla; Scichilone, Nicola; La Grutta, Stefania\n\n2018-04-01\n\nStudies on pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) children are lacking. The aims of this study were: (i) to investigate PFTs in GHD pre-pubertal children with respect to Controls, before starting Growth Hormone Therapy (GHT) (T0); (ii) to evaluate changes of PFTs in GHD vs Controls, after 1-year GHT (T1). For both aims the mediation analysis (MA) was applied to evaluate the extent to which the relationship between GHD and PFTs could be ascribed to a height-mediated (indirect) or a GH direct effect. 47 pre-pubertal GHD children (aged 5-14 years) underwent PFTs at T0 and T1. At T0, 47 healthy children matched for age and sex were enrolled as Controls. A MA was performed to assess the relationship between GHD and PFTs and height. Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software R (https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. At T0, PFTs indices were significantly lower in GHD than in Controls. From T0 to T1 a significant improvement was found in PFTs. The percentages of the mediated effect on FVC, FEV 1 , FEF 25-75% and TLC were <50% at T0, suggesting that the direct effect was prevalent. At T1, the percentages of the mediated effect for spirometry indices were â¥50%, indicating that the indirect (height-mediated) effect was the most relevant. The study shows that pre-pubertal children with GHD have an impairment of lung function not exclusively attributable to the indirect (height-mediated) effect, but also to the direct GH action which is mitigated after 1-year of GHT.

Effects of GH in adults are favorable, though. The aim of the work was to verify effects of GH administration on body composition in adult patients with GH deficit (GHD). The authors examined 15 adult patients with GHD originated in 13 of them in adulthood and in two of them in childhood. Their mean age was 43.9 +/- 11.3 years, the mean body mass was 80.0 +/- 15.2 kg. The GH deficit was verified by the stimulation insulin tolerance test. For the period of 12 months, they were subcutaneously administered recombinant human GH in a substitution dose of 0.5 to 1.5 IU/m2 body surface/day. A stable substitution of the hormone was applied for the period of at least six months in all these patients provided any deficit of other hormones had not been demonstrated. The examination by whole-body dosimeter Lunar DPX-L was made in the patients before the GH treatment began and after 12 months of therapy. It enabled to determine the amount of lean body mass (LBM) and fatty mass. After 12 months of GH treatment the mean level of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) was increased (P = 0.002). A statistically significant increase of total LBM (48.6 +/- 9.8 vs. 50.8 +/- 9.9 kg, P = 0.004) developed, the fatty mass did not change. Nine of these 15 patients were further followed and the administration of GH proceeded for six months. The densitometric examination was repeated, but no change of LBM was observed. The administration of GH was halted and after the period of 12 months the whole-body densitometric examination was done. The increase of LBM lasted. The amount of fat mass did not change, a decrease of fatty mass was observed after the GH administration ended. After 12 months of GH treatment there was also an increase of maximal output reached on bicycle ergometer (157.3 +/- 34.2 vs. 197.5 +/- 68.1 W, P = 0.006).

Based on the results of insulin tolerance test (ITT) patients were qualified for one of the following groups: 1) severe GHD - SGHD (26 patients; 8 women and 18 men); 2) partial GHD - PGHD (22 patients, 7 women and 15 men); 3) normal GH status - NGHS (28 patients, 9 women and 19 men). The fourth examined group consisted of healthy individuals - H (46 participants; 15 women, 31 men). Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, BMI), analysis of body composition and serum glucose, lipids, insulin, IGF-1 and APN assays were performed in all participants. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of APN between groups. After calculation of the total APN content in extracellular fluids per unit of fat tissue mass (TAPN/FM), these values were significantly lower in the SGHD (p<0.001) and correlated with the degree of impairment of the GH/IGF-1 axis functioning. In patients with GHD positive correlations between APN and serum HDL cholesterol (r=0.39, p<0.05) have been demonstrated. In the subjects with normal GH secretion serum APN correlated positively with serum HDL cholesterol (r=0.28; p<0.05), and negatively with fasting blood glucose (r=-0.31; p<0.05). Severe, but not partial growth hormone deficiency impairs adiponectin production in the adipose tissue that is compensated by the increase of fat mass. The degree of GH/IGF-1 axis disruption is related to the TAPN/FM. This parameter may be potentially\n\nImpact of the primary aetiology upon the clinical outcome of adults with childhood-onset GH deficiency.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoybye, Charlotte; JÃ¶nsson, Peter; Monson, John P; Koltowska-HÃ¤ggstrÃ¶m, Maria; HÃ¡na, VÃ¡clav; Geffner, Mitchell; Abs, Roger\n\n2007-11-01\n\nThe impact of the aetiology of childhood-onset GH deficiency (CO-GHD) on the clinical presentation during adulthood and the response to GH replacement has been poorly defined. Our study aims to characterize CO-GHD in adults due to different aetiologies and evaluate the effect of 2 years of GH replacement therapy. Data from 353 adults with CO-GHD from Pfizer International Metabolic Database KIMS were retrospectively grouped according to GHD aetiology: non-organic disorder (n=147), organic pituitary disease (n=159), and brain tumour (n=47). Extent of pituitary dysfunction, IGF-I concentration, lipid concentrations and quality-of-life (QoL) were assessed at baseline and after 2 years of GH replacement. GHD was diagnosed at a later age in the organic pituitary group than in the other groups, resulting in a shorter duration of GH treatment during childhood. However, the final height was greater in the organic pituitary group. Panhypopituitarism was most common in the non-organic disorder and in the organic pituitary groups, while isolated GHD was more prominent in the brain tumour group. Serum IGF-I levels were the lowest in the non-organic group. QoL was the poorest in the brain tumour group. Lipid profile and QoL improved significantly during GH replacement. The adverse consequences of CO-GHD in adulthood vary between aetiologies, but improve similarly with GH treatment. It is, therefore, important to consider retesting all patients with CO-GHD in early adulthood and, if persistent severe GHD is confirmed, recommence GH replacement.\n\nIncreased prevalence of growth hormone deficiency in patients with vernal keratoconjuntivitis; an interesting new association.\n\nPubMed\n\nStagi, Stefano; Pucci, Neri; di Grande, Laura; de Libero, Cinzia; Caputo, Roberto; Pantano, Stefano; Seminara, Salvatore; de Martino, Maurizio; Novembre, Elio\n\n2014-01-01\n\nVernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a chronic conjunctivitis that mainly affects children living in temperate areas. The notable difference between genders and VKC's resolution with puberty have persistently suggested a role of hormonal factors in VKC development. To describe six cases of males with VKC and growth hormone deficiency (GHD) reported as a long-term follow-up during rhGH treatment. Six consecutive male patients (median age at GHD diagnosis 9.7, range 7.9 to 13.1 years) with VKC, were recruited from July 2005 to July 2013 at the Paediatric Endocrinology Unit of Anna Meyer Children's Hospital in Florence, Italy. In these patients, anthropometric data were collected periodically. In three of these patients, data were collected to near-adult or adult height. Familial history was uneventful for all patients. The target height was normal, ranging from 0.65 standard deviation scores (SDS) to 2.01 SDS. The patients showed a normal birth-weight (from -1.21 to 1.35 SDS) and birth-length (from -0.93 to 1.21 SDS). At GHD diagnosis, all of the patients exhibited demonstrated important growth retardation (from -2.05 to -2.78 SDS). Plasmatic concentrations of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were low (from -1.85 to -3 SDS and from -1.81 to -2.76 SDS, respectively). GH stimulation tests showed classic GHD symptoms in all of the patients. Pubertal onset was normal. All of the patients treated with rhGH responded well to rhGH treatment. Adult height, evaluated in three patients, was in accordance with their target height. To our current knowledge, we have described for the first time six patients affected by VKC with GH deficiency, in some of whom we performed a long-term follow-up to adult height. Further studies will be needed to establish whether GHD may be a common feature of VKC patients. Nevertheless, it appears to be useful to carefully follow statural growth of VKC patients, while the possibility of a GH deficiency must to be taken into account in the presence of growth\n\nReappraisal of serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) measurement in the detection of isolated and combined growth hormone deficiency (GHD) during the transition period.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoguszewski, Cesar L; Lacerda, Claudio Silva de; Lacerda Filho, Luiz de; Carvalho, Julienne A R de; Boguszewski, Margaret C S\n\n2013-12-01\n\nTo evaluate the accuracy of serum IGF-1 in the detection of isolated (IGHD) or combined growth hormone deficiency (CGHD) at the transition phase. Forty nine patients with GHD during childhood [16 with IGHD (10 men) and 33 with CGHD (24 men); age 23.2 Â± 3.5 yrs.] were submitted to an insulin tolerance test (ITT) with a GH peak < 5 Âµg/L used for the diagnosis of GHD at the transition phase. Pituitary function and IGF-1 measurements were evaluated in the basal sample of the ITT. Transition patients were reclassified as GH-sufficient (SGH; n = 12), IGHD (n = 7), or CGHD (n = 30). Five (31%) patients with IGHD and 32 (97%) with CGHD at childhood persisted with GHD at retesting. One patient with IGHD was reclassified as CGHD, whereas 3 patients with CGHD were reclassified as IGHD. Mean GH peak was 0.2 Â± 0.3 Âµg/L in the CGHD, 1.3 Â± 1.5 Âµg/L in the IGHD, and 18.1 Â± 13.1 Âµg/L in the SGH group. Serum IGF-1 level was significantly higher in the SGH (272 Â± 107 ng/mL) compared to IGHD (100.2 Â± 110) and CGHD (48.7 Â± 32.8) (p < 0.01). All patients reclassified as CGHD, 86% reclassified as IGHD, and 8.3% reclassified as SGH had low IGF-1 level, resulting in 97.3% sensitivity and 91.6% specificity in the detection of GHD at the transition period; the cutoff value of 110 ng/mL showed 94.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Mean IGF-1 values did not differ in IGHD or CGHD associated with one, two, three, or four additional pituitary deficiencies. IGF-1 measurement is accurate to replace ITT as initial diagnostic test for IGHD and CGHD detection at the transition phase.\n\n[Long-term effects of 7-year growth hormone substitution on bone metabolism, bone density, and bone quality in growth hormone-deficient adults].\n\nPubMed\n\nWilhelm, Birgit; Kann, Peter Herbert\n\n2004-10-15\n\nSubnormal bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk are described in patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Growth hormone (GH) has been reported to have beneficial effects on bone in GHD. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of GH replacement therapy on bone metabolism, BMD, and bone quality in patients with GHD. 20 adult patients with GHD (eleven male, nine female, mean age 42.5 years) were included in the study and randomized to either GH or placebo in a dose of 0.25 U/kg body weight/week. After 6 months all patients received GH. After a 1-year double-blind, placebo-controlled study the patients were followed for another 72 months in an open study. The patients were compared to 20 age- und sex-matched healthy controls. Bone turnover was determined by ICTP (type I collagen carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide) as parameter of bone resorption and PICP (carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen) as marker of bone formation. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine by dual-photon absorptiometry (DPA) and at the forearm by single-photon absorptiometry (SPA). Apparent phalangeal ultrasound transmission velocity (APU) was assessed as parameter of bone quality independent of BMD. At the beginning of the study BMD at both measuring sites was lower in patients with GHD than in healthy controls. During the 1st year of GH replacement therapy BMD decreased, followed by a continuous increase in BMD (about 12%) up to 60 months which remained unchanged thereafter, building up a plateau. After 72 months no significant difference between the patients and the healthy controls could be detected. Concerning parameters of bone turnover, first ICTP as marker of bone resorption showed a significant increase, later on the marker of bone formation increased as well. APU decreased during the first 6 months of treatment, but had returned to its baseline value after 24 months and remained unchanged throughout the rest of the study.

The aim of the study was to compare both short- (1 year) and long-term (5 years) effects of rhGH in 38 GHD adult patients (19 operated for Craniopharyngioma (CP) and 19 for NFPA). IGF-I levels, body composition (BF%), BMI, lipid profile and glucose homeostasis were evaluated in all patients. Pituitary MRI was performed at baseline and during follow-up, as needed. At baseline no difference between the two groups was observed, apart from a higher prevalence of diabetes insipidus in CP patients (79 vs 21%). After 12 months, IGF-I SDS normalized and BF% significantly decreased only in the NFPA group. During long-term treatment, decrease in BF% and improvement in lipid profile shown by reduction in total- and LDL-cholesterol were present in NFPA group only, while increase in insulin levels and HbA1c and decrease of QUICKI were observed in CP patients only. Accordingly, after long-term therapy, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) was significantly higher in CP than in NFPA group (37% in CP and in 5% in NFPA group; p < 0.05). The present data suggest that CP patients are less sensitive to the positive rhGH effects on lipid profile and BF% and more prone to insulin sensitivity worsening than NFPA patients, resulting in increased prevalence of MS in CP only.\n\nGrowth hormone replacement normalizes impaired fibrinolysis: new insights into endothelial dysfunction in patients with hypopituitarism and growth hormone deficiency.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiljic, D; Miljic, P; Doknic, M; Pekic, S; Stojanovic, M; Cvijovic, G; Micic, D; Popovic, V\n\n2013-12-01\n\nCardiovascular morbidity in adult patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and hypopituitarism is increased. Clustering of cardiovascular risk factors leading to endothelial dysfunction and impaired fibrinolysis has also been reported and may account for progression to overt vascular changes in these patients. However, effect of long lasting GH replacement therapy on fibrinolytic capacity in GH deficient patients has not been investigated so far. To investigate fibrinolysis before and after challenge with venous occlusion in GHD patients with hypopituitarism before and during one year of growth hormone replacement. Hospital based, interventional, prospective study. Twenty one patient with GHD and fourteen healthy control subjects matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Anthropometric, metabolic and fibrinolytic parameters were measured at the start and after three, six and twelve months of treatment with human recombinant GH. At baseline GHD patients had significantly impaired fibrinolysis compared to healthy persons. During treatment with GH, significant changes were observed in insulin like growth factor 1(IGF-1) [from baseline 6.9(2.4-13.5) to 22.0(9.0-33.0) nmol/l after one month of treatment; p<0.01] and fibrinolysis. Improvement in fibrinolysis was mostly attributed to improvement of stimulated endothelial tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) release in response to venous occlusion [from baseline 1.1(0.4-2.6) to 1.9(0.5-8.8) after one year of treatment; p<0.01]. Growth hormone replacement therapy has favorable effects on t-PA release from endothelium and net fibrinolytic capacity in GHD adults, which may contribute to decrease their risk of vascular complications.

In this study, children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) (including isolated idiopathic growth hormone deficiency [IGHD] and multiple pituitary hormone deficiency [MPHD]), idiopathic short stature (ISS), and Turner syndrome (TS) were evaluated for near-adult height (NAH) and percent achieving NAH within the normal range after approximately 4Â years of GHT. Data from the American NorditropinÂ® Web-Enabled Research (ANSWER) Program were analyzed for NAH from age at treatment start (ATS) (i.e., referral age as defined by age at enrollment in the study) to last clinic visit using one of the following two criteria: 1) age â¥18Â years, or 2) if male: â¥16Â years and height velocity (HV) <2Â cm/year; if female: â¥15Â years and HV <2Â cm/year. All patients had a baseline height standard deviation score (HSDS)ââ¤â-2, and either GHD (nâ=â201), ISS (nâ=â19), or TS (nâ=â41). The main outcome measures included HSDS and corrected HSDS (HSDS-target HSDS) in response to GH treatment, and correlation of ATS with NAH HSDS. Mean (Â± SD) chronological and bone ages at baseline were 14.0âÂ±â2.1Â years and 11.7âÂ±â2.0Â years, respectively, and mean GHT duration was 4.0âÂ±â1.6Â years.

Retrospective study of patients followed over a total period of 11 years. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed by the QOL-Assessment of Growth Hormone Deficiency in Adults (QoL-AGHDA) score and adherence to treatment was measured by a specific questionnaire. Clinical, biological, body composition and bone mineralization parameters were also analyzed. Data from 81 patients were analyzed. After a median treatment duration of 7 years, 2/3 of patients reported improved QOL (mean decrease of AGHDA score of 3.0 points, P<0.001). A trend towards more frequent improvement was observed in middle-aged patients, women, childhood-onset GHD, and in patients with initially more impaired QOL. More than 60% of the patients reported continuing treatment without interruption. Seventy percent declared good adherence (â¤2 missed injections/month). A majority reported enhanced well-being. Additionally, we observed a mean weight increase of 2 kg, while fat mass, waist/hip circumference ratio and lipids were unchanged. Bone mineral density was significantly increased at lumbar spine and femoral neck. Our study confirmed a sustained improvement in quality of life and showed that majority of patients were still on GH treatment after a median duration of 7 years. Copyright Â© 2014.

It may be found in (over-) treated acromegaly as well as in active Cushing's syndrome. Hypopituitarism may develop in patients after definitive treatment of acromegaly, although the exact prevalence of GHD in this population is still uncertain because of limited awareness, and scarce and conflicting data so far available. Because GHD associated with acromegaly and Cushing's syndrome may yield adverse consequences on similar target systems, the final outcomes of some complications of both acromegaly and Cushing's syndrome may be further affected by the occurrence of GHD. It is still largely unknown, however, whether GHD in patients with post-acromegaly or active Cushing's syndrome (e.g. pharmacologic glucocorticoid treatment) may benefit from GH replacement. We review the diagnostic, clinical and therapeutic aspects of GHD in adults treated for acromegaly and in those with active Cushing's syndrome. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Retrospective analysis of 14 GHD adults from Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who were treated with a GH regimen aimed at maintaining serum IGF-1 levels between the median and upper reference limit (high dose group - HDGH) and 18 GHD adults from Federal University Hospital, Curitiba, Brazil, who received a fixed GH dose of 0.2mg/day in the first year of treatment, followed by titration to maintain serum IGF-1 levels between the median and lower reference limit (low dose group - LDGH). All patients were followed for 2 years with analysis of anthropometric parameters, serum levels of IGF-1, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, lipid profile, and transthoracic echocardiography. Changes on weight, BMI and waist circumference were similar between the two groups. Insulin levels increased and HOMA-IR worsened in the LDGH group at 1year and improved thereafter. Total cholesterol and triglycerides did not change with therapy. LDL cholesterol reduced in both groups, while HDL-cholesterol significantly increased only in the HDGH group (p=0.007 vs LDGH). No significant variations on echocardiographic parameters were observed. The HDGH and LDGH regimens resulted in similar changes on anthropometric, echocardiographic, glucose and lipid parameters in GHD adults, except for increase in HDL cholesterol that was only observed in the HDGH regimen.

Profound GH deficiency (GHD) in adults with pituitary disease is associated with symptoms that improve with GH substitution, but it is important to tailor the GH dose to avoid overtreatment. Measurement of serum IGF-I levels is an important clinical tool in this regard, but it is well recognized that some patients receiving GH treatment do not show an increase in IGF-I. Objective: The objective of the study was to identify novel serum biomarkers of GH treatment in adults with GHD. Design and Patients: Eight patients with profound GHD as a consequence of a pituitary adenoma or its treatment were evaluated before and 3 months after GH replacement therapy (0.2â0.4 mg/d). Main Outcome Measures: Serum proteomic changes were studied using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Protein profiles were analyzed and compared in serum samples obtained before and after GH treatment. Results: The levels of six serum protein spots were significantly altered after GH substitution. These proteins were identified as five isoforms of haptoglobin (decreased in posttreatment samples) and one isoform of apolipoprotein A-I (increased in posttreatment samples). Importantly, changes in the levels of the identified proteins were associated with decreases in fat mass and increases in lean mass in all patients. These results were independent of serum IGF-I levels. Conclusions: Evaluation of the identified proteins provides a novel alternative to traditional markers of GH status, such as serum IGF-I levels, to assess GH therapy in GH deficient adults.

The association of leptin with GHD characteristics and the effect of gene variants of leptin on GHD are unknown. Our aim was to examine the association of circulating leptin levels and common genetic variants in leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor (LEPR) genes with anthropometric measures, circulating hormone concentrations and GHD. A case control study of 125 GHD cases and 159 control subjects were characterized for bone age, body mass index (BMI), height, weight, leptin, IGF-1, GH and their genotype at the leptin promoter G-2548A, and LEPR variants, K109R and Q223R, at Chung Shan Medical University Hospital. Leptin levels were significantly associated with lower bone age, weight and BMI in GHD patients. Leptin levels were also significantly associated with reduced IGF-1 levels in girls but not boys in both groups. The frequency of LEPR223 [A/G or A/A] genotype was significantly higher than the LEPR223 G/G genotype in the GHD group. The LEPR223 [A/G or A/A] genotype was significantly associated with increased weight and BMI in the control group, but not in the GHD group. In conclusion, the GHD group carried a significantly higher frequency of the LEPR [G/A or A/A] genotype and of the A allele (LEPR223R). The LEPR223R polymorphism affected weight and BMI in control, but not in GHD patients, suggesting that the effect of LEPR223 [A/G or A/A] genotype was counteracted by other factor(s) in GHD patients.\n\nInternational Comparison of Adult Height in Children with Growth Hormone Deficiency and Limitations of Growth Hormone Treatment in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanaka, Toshiaki\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe approved therapeutic dose of growth hormone (GH) for growth hormone deficiency (GHD) varies depending on the country. Japan has the lowest therapeutic dose globally, with a single dose of 0.175 mg/kg/week. GH treatment for GHD is considered as a replacement therapy and in fact, a dose of 0.175 mg/kg/week is slightly higher than GH secretion in prepubertal healthy children but nearly the same as that of pubertal children. Although the same growth rate as that of healthy children is expected in response to replacement therapy, the catch-up growth observed for the first 1 to 2 years of GH treatment was misinterpreted as an effect of the GH replacement therapy. The real effect of the GH replacement therapy was the growth rate appeared after more than 3 years of GH therapy, when patients showed nearly the same growth rate as healthy children. Therefore, children with GHD can have a higher growth rate than healthy children only for the first 1 to 2 years of GH therapy, after which their growth rate begins to wane. In the United States and Europe, the various therapeutic doses and high-dose treatment are accepted and the SD score of adult height after treatment is higher than that in Japan. The improvement degree of the height SD score and the adult height SD score with GH therapy are lower in Japan compared with other countries that administer a similar therapeutic dose. This suggests that the response to GH can be affected by race. Actual comparison of the response to GH between Japanese and Caucasian patients using KIGS (Pharmacia International Growth Database) data showed that both the short-term response and the effect on adult height were reduced in Japanese patients. As there is a strong positive correlation between adult height and height at the onset of puberty, treatment methods that can increase pubertal growth will be considered in the future for patients with GDH who enter puberty with short stature.

This prospective study tested the hypothesis that traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with GHD or GH insufficiency (GHI) would exhibit greater NB/QOL impairment than patients without GHD/GHI. Complicated mild, moderate, and severe adult TBI patients (GCS score 3-14) had pituitary function and NB/QOL testing performed 6-9 months postinjury. GH-secretory capacity was assessed with a GHRH-arginine stimulation test and GHD and GHI were defined as peak GH<6 or patients (mean age, 32+/-18 years; median GCS, 7), one (2%) was GHD, seven (16%) were GHI, and 36 (82%) were GH-sufficient at 6-9 months post-injury. Mean peak GH was 8.2+/-2.1 ng/mL in the GHD/GHI group versus 45.7+/-29 ng/mL in the GHsufficient group. The two groups were well-matched in injury characteristics, except that one patient with GHD had central hypogonadism treated with testosterone prior to NB/QOL testing. At 6-9 months postinjury, patients with GHD/GHI had higher rates of at least one marker of depression (p<0.01), and reduced QOL (by SF-36 Health Survey) in the domains of limitations due to physical health (p=0.02), energy and fatigue (p=0.05), emotional well-being (p=0.02), pain (p=0.01), and general health (p=0.05). Chronic GHI develops in approximately 18% of patients with complicated mild, moderate, or severe TBI, and is associated with depression and diminished QOL. The impact of GH replacement therapy on NB function and QOL in these TBI patients is being tested in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.\n\nPossible effects of an early diagnosis and treatment in patients with growth hormone deficiency: the state of art.\n\nPubMed\n\nStagi, Stefano; Scalini, Perla; Farello, Giovanni; Verrotti, Alberto\n\n2017-09-16\n\nGrowth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a relatively uncommon and heterogeneous endocrine disorder presenting in childhood with short stature. However, during the neonatal period, the metabolic effects of GHD may to require prompt replacement therapy to avoid possible life-threatening complications. An increasing amount of data suggests the importance of an early diagnosis and treatment of GHD because of its auxological, metabolic, and neurodevelopmental features with respect to the patients diagnosed and treated later in life.The available results show favourable auxological outcomes for patients with GHD diagnosed and treated with r-hGH early in life compared with those from patients with GHD who do not receive this early diagnosis and treatment. Because delayed referral for GHD diagnosis and treatment is still frequent, these results highlight the need for more attention in the diagnosis and treatment of GHD.Despite these very encouraging data regarding metabolic and neurodevelopmental features, further studies are needed to better characterize these findings. Overall, the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of GHD needs to be addressed.\n\nAdult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with GH deficiency have normal self-rated quality of life but impaired neuropsychological performance 20 years after cranial irradiation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLink, Katarina; MoÃ«ll, Christian; Osterberg, Kai; Persson, Roger; Ãrbaek, Palle; Garwicz, Stanislaw; Cavallin-StÃ¥hl, Eva; Erfurth, Eva Marie\n\n2006-11-01\n\nCranial radiotherapy (CRT) was, until recently, important for achieving long-term survival in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Because survival rates have improved markedly, the long-term complications, such as GH deficiency (GHD) and neuropsychological impairment, have become increasingly important. The level of self-reported quality of life and neuropsychological functioning was investigated in 44 adults (21 women) with a median age of 25 years who had been treated for childhood onset (CO) ALL with CRT (median 24 Gy). Comparison was made with matched population controls. A subset of patients with GHD was evaluated for neuropsychological functioning after 1 year of GH treatment. Compared to controls, the patients had significantly lower performance in neuropsychological tests. Early age at treatment had a significant negative impact on neuropsychological performance in adulthood. No relationship was found between dose of CRT, time since treatment of ALL or gender and neuropsychological performance. Compared to controls, the patients did not show a poor quality of life or a lowered availability of social interactions or social networks; however, significantly more patients were living alone or with their parents. After GH testing, the patients were all considered GH deficient or insufficient, but no relationship was observed between stimulated peak GH secretion and neuropsychological performance. Treatment with GH for 1 year in a subgroup of the patients did not improve their neuropsychological performance. This study showed that adults treated with CRT for CO ALL had GHD and significantly impaired neuropsychological performance, although self-reported quality of life was not affected. The effect of GH treatment in this patient group has to be further elucidated.\n\nProvincial Disparities of Growth Hormone Coverage for Young Adult Survivors of Paediatric Brain Tumours across Canada\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHasan, Haroon; Howard, Fuchsia; Morgan, Steven G.; Metzger, Daniel L.; Gill, Sabrina; Johnson, Michelle; Lo, Andrea C.; Goddard, Karen\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: Young adult survivors of paediatric brain tumours (PBTs) who have been treated with radiation therapy will likely be severely growth hormoneâdeficient when retested at the achievement of final height. Growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) is administered to treat growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Public drug coverage for GHRT falls under the responsibility of provincial governments across Canada. This study sought to determine the extent of public drug coverage and cost in each Canadian province for GHRT to treat GHD during adulthood for young adult survivors of PBTs. Methods: Data were collected from provincial government resources and drug formularies from 2012â2013 on the extent of coverage for GHRT based on a clinical case scenario representative of a young adult survivor of a PBT with childhood-onset radiation-induced GHD, the ingredient cost for GHRT and the applicable provincial public drug plan cost-sharing policies. A model was then created to simulate out-of-pocket costs incurred by a young adult male and a young adult female survivor of a PBT for one year of GHRT in each province with applicable cost-sharing arrangements and levels of low annual individual total income that best represent the majority of young adult survivors of PBTs. Out-of-pocket costs were expressed as a percentage of annual income. Comparisons were made between provinces descriptively, and variation among provinces was summarized statistically. Results: Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador provide coverage for GHD during adulthood on a case-by-case basis, while British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island provide no coverage. The percentage of annual income to fund GHRT across the provinces without public coverage ranged from 14.4% to 25.5% for males and 21.5% to 38.3% for females, and with public coverage was 0.0% to 4.1% for males and 0.0% to 5.0% for females.

GHD is the most frequent endocrine disorder presenting with short stature in childhood. During neonatal period, metabolic effects due to congenital GHD require a prompt replacement therapy to avoid possible life-threatening complications. In childhood and adolescence, growth impairment is the most evident effect of GHD and early treatment has the aim of restore normal growth and to reach normal adult height. We reassume in this review the conditions causing GHD and the diagnostic challenge to reach an early diagnosis, and an early treatment, necessary to obtain the best results. Finally, we summarize results obtained in clinical studies about pediatric patients with GHD treated at an early age, in which a marked early catch-up growth and a normalization of adult height were obtained.\n\nReal-life GH dosing patterns in children with GHD, TS or born SGA: a report from the NordiNetÂ® International Outcome Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlankenstein, Oliver; Snajderova, Marta; Blair, Jo; Pournara, Effie; Pedersen, Birgitte TÃ¸nnes; Petit, Isabelle Oliver\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTo describe real-life dosing patterns in children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), born small for gestational age (SGA) or with Turner syndrome (TS) receiving growth hormone (GH) and enrolled in the NordiNet International Outcome Study (IOS; Nbib960128) between 2006 and 2016.

The main function of somatotropin is stimulation of linear growth, but it also affects carbohydrate metabolism, increases bone mass and has potent lipolytic, antinatriuretic and antidiuretic effects. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) may occur both in children and in adults. At the moment there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of GHD, and the diagnosis should take into account clinical, auxological, biochemical and radiological changes and, if necessary, genetic testing. Recent studies have highlighted that the biochemical diagnosis of GH deficiency is still imperfect. Stimuli used in the tests are non-physiological, and various substances are characterized by a different mechanism of action and potency. A few years ago it was thought that GHD treatment in children must be completed at the end of linear growth. Studies performed in the last two decades have shown that GHD deficiency in adults may result in complex clinical problems, and if untreated shortens the life expectancy and worsens its comfort. Discontinuation of GH therapy after the final height has been reached in fact negatively impacts the physiological processes associated with the transition phase, which is the period of human life between achieving the final height and 25-30 years of age. Given the adverse metabolic effects of GH treatment interruption after linear growth has been completed, the latest recommendations propose reassessment of GH secretion in the period at least one month after cessation of treatment and continuation of the therapy in case of persistent deficit.\n\nProposal of a clinical response score and predictors of clinical response to 2 years of GH replacement therapy in adult GH deficiency.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchneider, Harald J; Buchfelder, Michael; Wallaschofski, Henri; Luger, Anton; Johannsson, Gudmundur; Kann, Peter H; Mattsson, Anders\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThere is no single clinical marker to reliably assess the clinical response to growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). The objective of this study was to propose a clinical response score to GHRT in adult GHD and to establish clinical factors that predict clinical response. This was a prospective observational cohort study from the international KIMS database (Pfizer International Metabolic Database). We included 3612 adult patients with GHD for proposing the response score and 844 patients for assessing predictors of response. We propose a clinical response score based on changes in total cholesterol, waist circumference and QoL-AGHDA quality of life measurements after 2 years of GHRT. A score point was added for each quintile of change in each variable, resulting in a sum score ranging from 3 to 15. For clinical response at 2 years, we analysed predictors at baseline and after 6 months using logistic regression analyses. In a baseline prediction model, IGF1, QoL-AGHDA, total cholesterol and waist circumference predicted response, with worse baseline parameters being associated with a favourable response (AUC 0.736). In a combined baseline and 6-month prediction model, baseline QoL-AGHDA, total cholesterol and waist circumference, and 6-month change in waist circumference were significant predictors of response (AUC 0.815). A simple clinical response score might be helpful in evaluating the success of GHRT. The baseline prediction model may aid in the decision to initiate GHRT and the combined prediction model may be helpful in the decision to continue GHRT.

A gluten-free diet (GFD) induces a catch-up growth with the recovery of height in about 2 years. AIM AND DISCUSSION: The lack of the height improvement has been related to growth hormone (GH) secretion impairment. CD is an autoimmune disease often associated with other endocrine and non-endocrine autoimmune disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate antipituitary autoantibodies (APA) and antihypothalamus autoantibodies in CD children with poor clinical response to a GFD and growth hormone deficiency (GHD). We diagnosed CD on the basis of specific antibodies and endoscopic biopsies in 130 patients aged 1-15 years. Seven CD children, without catch-up growth after at least 12-months GFD, were tested for GH secretion and, in five out of seven patients, the diagnosis of GHD was made in the absence of metabolic and systemic diseases. APA and antihypothalamus antibodies were detected by the indirect immunofluorescence method in the seven CD children without catch-up growth factor and in 25 CD children without growth impairment matched for sex and age, and in 58 healthy children as control groups. APA resulted positive at high titres in four out of five CD-GHD patients and were also positive at low titres (<1:8) in three of only CD children and in two out of 58 controls. Hypothalamic-pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal in all patients except in one with cystic pineal. APA have been previously detected not only in adults with GHD, but also in idiopathic GHD children, suggesting the occurrence of an autoimmune hypophysitis in these patients. In our study, the presence of APA in CD children without catch-up growth after GFD seems to be able to identify an autoimmune form of hypophysitis involving the somatotrophs cells.\n\nBrazilian adult individuals with untreated isolated GH deficiency do not have accelerated subclinical atherosclerosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCosta, Ursula M M; Oliveira, Carla R P; Salvatori, Roberto; Barreto-Filho, JosÃ© A S; Campos, Viviane C; Oliveira, Francielle T; Rocha, Ivina E S; Oliveira, Joselina L M; Silva, Wersley A; Aguiar-Oliveira, Manuel H\n\n2016-01-01\n\nGH and its principal mediator IGF1 have important effects on metabolic and cardiovascular (CV) status. While acquired GH deficiency (GHD) is often associated with increased CV risk, the consequences of congenital GHD are not known. We have described a large group of patients with isolated GHD (IGHD) due to a homozygous mutation (c.57+1G>A) in the GH releasing hormone receptor gene, and shown that adult GH-naÃ¯ve individuals have no evidence of clinically evident premature atherosclerosis. To test whether subclinical atherosclerosis is anticipated in untreated IGHD, we performed a cross-sectional study of 25 IGHD and 27 adult controls matched for age and gender. A comprehensive clinical and biochemical panel and coronary artery calcium scores were evaluated by multi-detector tomography. Height, weight, IGF1, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, creatinine and creatininekinase were lower in the IGHD group. Median and interquartile range of calcium scores distribution was similar in the two groups: IGHD 0(0) and control 0(4.9). The vast majority of the calcium scores (20 of 25 IGHD (80%) and 18 of 27 controls (66.6%)) were equal to zero (difference not significant). There was no difference in the calcium scores classification. None of IGHD subjects had minimal calcification, which were present in four controls. Three IGHD and four controls had mild calcification. There were two IGHD individuals with moderate calcification and one control with severe calcification. Our study provides evidence that subjects with congenital isolated lifetime and untreated severe IGHD do not have accelerated subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.

NordiNetÂ® International Outcome Study (IOS) (Nbib960128), a non-interventional, multicentre study, evaluates the long-term effectiveness and safety of NorditropinÂ® (somatropin) (Novo Nordisk A/S) in the real-life clinical setting. Patients ( n â=â172) treated to NAH (height at â¥18 years, or height velocity <2âcm/year at â¥16 (boys) or â¥15 (girls) years) were grouped by age (years) at treatment start (early (girls, <8; boys, <9), intermediate (girls, 8-10; boys, 9-11) or late (girls, >10; boys, >11)) and GHD severity (<3âng/mL or 3 to â¤10âng/mL). Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of age at treatment start (as a categorical and continuous variable) on NAH standard deviation score (SDS). Age at treatment start had a marked effect on NAH SDS; NAH SDS achieved by patients starting treatment early ( n â=â40 (boys, 70.0%); least squares mean (standard error) -0.76 (0.14)) exceeded that achieved by those starting later (intermediate, n â=â42 (boys, 57.1%); -1.14 (0.15); late, n â=â90 (boys, 68.9%); -1.21 (0.10)). Multiple regression analysis showed a significant association between NAH SDS and age at treatment start ( P â<â0.0242), baseline height SDS (HSDS) ( P â<â0.0001), target HSDS ( P â<â0.0001), and GHD severity ( P â=â0.0012). Most (78.5%) patients achieved a normal NAH irrespective of age at treatment start. Early initiation of GH treatment in children with isolated GHD improves their chance of achieving their genetic height potential.

We aimed to define the effects of GH therapy on thyroid volume (TV) and nodular growth. The records of 96 subjects (47 males and 49 females, median age 48 years) with GH deficit (GHD) were investigated. Seventy also had central hypothyroidism (CH). At the time of our retrospective evaluation, median treatment duration was 5 years. Pre-treatment TV was smaller in GHD patients than in healthy subjects (P=0.030). During GH treatment, TV significantly increased (P=0.016 for the entire group and P=0.014 in euthyroid GHD patients). Before starting GH therapy, 17 patients harbored thyroid nodules. During GH therapy, nodule size increased slightly in seven patients, and new thyroid nodules occurred in nine patients. Among the 79 patients without pre-existing thyroid nodules, 17 developed one or more nodules. There was no difference in the prevalence of CH in GHD patients with or without thyroid nodules (P=0.915; P=0.841, when patients with pre-therapy nodular goiter were excluded), the main predictor for nodule development being serum IGF1 (P=0.038). GHRT is associated with TV's increase in GHD patients. Thyroid nodules developed in 27% of patients, mainly in relation to pre-therapy IGF1 levels, independently of normal or impaired TSH stimulation.

Patients were grouped by tertiles of stimulated GH peak concentration at baseline (Group A lowest tertile, nÂ =Â 342; Group B middle tertile, nÂ =Â 345; Group C highest tertile, nÂ =Â 338). Baseline demographics, lipid levels, body mass index categories and mean Framingham cardiovascular risk indexes were similar in the three groups and remained substantially unchanged over time, with no subsequent significant between-group differences (except mean levels of triglycerides increased in the highest tertile group). GHD was adult-onset for >75% of patients in all groups. The percentage of patients with multiple pituitary deficiencies was higher in Group A than in the other groups; isolated GHD was reported with highest frequency in Group C. Patients in Group A received the lowest mean starting dose of GH. Hyperlipidaemia at baseline was reported in 35Â·1%, 31Â·1% and 24Â·7% of patients in groups A, B and C, respectively (PÂ =Â 0Â·029). Mean duration of GH treatment was 7Â·21, 5Â·45 and 4Â·96Â years, respectively. The proportion of patients with adverse events did not differ significantly between groups, with a low prevalence over time of diabetes and cancer. In Italian patients from HypoCCS, the level of GH deficit did not influence changes over time in metabolic parameters or adverse event profile, despite differences in GHD severity at baseline and in the starting GH dose.

A retrospective analysis of 20 patients with ISS and 9 patients with GHD treated with combined therapy was undertaken. Twelve children with ISS and ten with GHD, treated with GH alone, served as controls. Patients were matched at baseline for chronological age, bone age, height standard deviation score (SDS), and pubertal development. Patients with ISS or GHD treated with combined therapy improved both their predicted adult height (PAH) at 2 years of therapy (ISS, p < 0.001; GHD, p = 0.03) and their NFH (ISS, p < 0.05; GHD, p = 0.05). Treatment with combined therapy did not generate additional benefits on the PAH after 2 years of therapy (ISS children, an increase of 7.9 +/- 4.9 cm with combined therapy vs. 7.3 +/- 6.0 cm with GH; GHD children, an increase of 6.8 +/- 7.8 cm with combined therapy vs. 5 +/- 5.9 cm with GH). The total height gain SDS was higher in patients treated with GH alone compared with those with combined therapy, but the difference was not significant (ISS children, a gain of 2.4 SDS with GH vs. 0.8 SDS with combined therapy; GHD children, a gain of 1.8 SDS with GH vs. 0.6 SDS with combined therapy). Although 2 years of combined treatment with GH and LHRHa improved the PAH and the NFH of ISS and GHD patients in early puberty, this improvement was not significant compared with that observed in similar subjects treated with GH alone.\n\nGrowth hormone treatment in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome: the Scandinavian study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSode-Carlsen, Rasmus; Farholt, Stense; Rabben, Kai Fr; Bollerslev, Jens; Schreiner, Thomas; Jurik, Anne Grethe; Christiansen, Jens Sandahl; HÃ¶ybye, Charlotte\n\n2012-04-01\n\nPrader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by short stature, muscular hypotonia, cognitive dysfunction, and hyperphagia usually leading to severe obesity. Patients with PWS share similarities with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Few studies have dealt with growth hormone (GH) treatment in PWS adults. The purpose of the Scandinavian study was to evaluate the effects of GH on body composition, lipid and glucose metabolism, physical performance and safety parameters in adults with PWS. Twenty-five women and 21 men with PWS were randomized to treatment with GH or placebo during 1Â year followed by 2Â years of open labeled GH treatment. At baseline 1/3 had normal BMI, six patients severe GHD, ten impaired glucose tolerance and seven diabetes. At 1Â year insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) SDS had increased by 1.51 (PÂ <Â 0.001) and body composition improved in the GH treated group. Visceral fat decreased by 22.9Â ml (PÂ =Â 0.004), abdominal subcutaneous fat by 70.9Â ml (PÂ =Â 0.003) and thigh fat by 21.3Â ml (PÂ =Â 0.013), whereas thigh muscle increased 6.0Â ml (PÂ =Â 0.005). Lean body mass increased 2.25Â kg (PÂ =Â 0.005), and total fat mass decreased 4.20Â kg (PÂ <Â 0.001). The positive effects on body composition were maintained after 2Â years of GH treatment. Peak expiratory flow increased by 12% (PÂ <Â 0.001) at 2Â years of GH treatment. Lipid and glucose metabolism were unchanged, however, three patients developed diabetes at 2Â years of GH treatment. In conclusion GH treatment had beneficial effects on the abnormal body composition without serious adverse events making it a logic treatment option in adults with PWS.\n\nGrowth Hormone Deficiency in Adults\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... tests that help detect GHD are performed after fasting overnight.

GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are also known to have roles in cardiac development and as modulators of myocardial structure and function in the adult heart. However, little is known about cardiac diastolic function in young adults with childhood onset GH deficiency in which GH treatment was discontinued following puberty. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of long standing GHD and peri-pubertal or continuous GH replacement therapy on diastolic function in the adult dwarf rat. The dwarf rat, which possesses a mutation in a transcription factor necessary for development of the somatotroph, does not exhibit the normal peri-pubertal rise in GH around day 28 and was used to model childhood or early-onset GHD (EOGHD). In another group of male dwarfs, GH replacement therapy was initiated at 4 weeks of age when GH pulsatility normally begins. Ten weeks after initiation of injections, GH-treated dwarf rats were divided into 2 groups; continued treatment with GH for 12 weeks (GH-replete) or treatment with saline for 12 weeks. This latter group models GH supplementation during adolescence with GHD beginning in adulthood (adult-onset GHD; AOGHD). Saline-treated heterozygous (HZ) rats were used as age-matched controls. At 26 weeks of age, cardiac function was assessed using invasive or noninvasive (conventional and tissue Doppler) indices of myocardial contractility and lusitropy. Systolic function, as determined by echocardiography, was similar among groups. Compared with HZ rats and GH-replete dwarfs, the EOGHD group exhibited significant reductions in myocardial relaxation and increases in left ventricular filling pressure, indicative of moderate diastolic dysfunction. This was further associated with a decrease in the cardiac content of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA2), one of the important cardiac calcium\n\nGH replacement therapy and second neoplasms in adult survivors of childhood cancer: a retrospective study from a single institution.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrignardello, E; Felicetti, F; Castiglione, A; Fortunati, N; Matarazzo, P; Biasin, E; Sacerdote, C; Ricardi, U; Fagioli, F; Corrias, A; Arvat, E\n\n2015-02-01\n\nGrowth hormone deficiency (GHD) is the most common endocrine late effect observed in childhood cancer survivors (CCS) previously submitted to cranial irradiation. Radiation therapy can also increase the risk of second neoplasms (SNs). Since in previous studies GH replacement therapy was associated with increased incidence of neoplasia, we explored the association between SNs and GH replacement therapy in a cohort of CCS with GHD. Within the clinical cohort of CCS referred to the Transition Unit for Childhood Cancer Survivors of Turin between November 2001 and December 2012, we considered all patients who developed GHD as a consequence of cancer therapies. GHD was always diagnosed in childhood. To evaluate the quality of data, our cohort was linked to the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont. GHD was diagnosed in 49 out of 310 CCS included in our clinical cohort. At least one SN was diagnosed in 14 patients, meningioma and basal cell carcinoma being the most common SNs. The cumulative incidence of SNs was similar in GH-treated and -untreated patients (8 SNs out of 26 GH-treated and 6 out of 23 GH-untreated patients; pÂ =Â 0.331). Age, sex and paediatric cancer type had no impact on SNs development. In our CCS, GH replacement therapy does not seem to increase the risk of SNs. Anyway, independently from replacement therapy, in these patients we observed an elevated risk of SNs, possibly related to previous radiation therapy, which suggests the need of a close long-term follow-up.\n\nCognitive, emotional, physical and social effects of growth hormone treatment in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nHÃ¶ybye, C; ThorÃ©n, M; BÃ¶hm, B\n\n2005-04-01\n\nPrader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystem genetic disorder characterized by short stature, muscular hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity, maladaptive behaviour, hypogonadism and partial growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD). Severe GHD of other aetiologies has been shown to affect mood and quality of life negatively, and there are reports of improvements with GH replacement. We have studied cognitive, emotional, physical and social parameters in PWS adults at baseline, during and after GH treatment. Nineteen patients, 9 females and 10 males, median age 25 years, mean BMI 35 kg/m2 participated in this study. Approximately half of the group had GHD. All patients fulfilled the clinical criteria for PWS and 13 had a positive genotype. The patients were randomized to 6 months of treatment with either GH [1.6 IU/day (0.53 mg/day)] or placebo, followed by 12 months of active GH treatment. Treatment was then stopped, and the patients were followed for an additional period of 6 months. A test battery for general cognitive evaluation and a computer-based measurement of reaction time, motor speed and fluency were employed at baseline, after 6 months and at the end of GH treatment. At the same time intervals, a self-evaluation questionnaire was answered at the end of each test session. Other questionnaires reflecting the patients' cognitive, emotional, physical and social status were answered by relatives/caretakers at baseline and at 3 and 6 months following cessation of GH treatment. Baseline cognitive level was estimated to be moderately to mildly impaired; IQ range was 40-90. The results from some of the cognitive and the motor performance tests improved significantly after 6 and 18 months of GH treatment. According to the questionnaires, both the patients and the relatives/caretakers evaluated physical status rather negatively at baseline, but still, impairments in both physical and social status and overall functioning were observed when GH treatment was discontinued. The\n\nGrowth Hormone Deficiency in the Transition Age.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoche, Sandro; Di Iorgi, Natascia; Patti, Giuseppa; Noli, Serena; Giaccardi, Marta; Olivieri, Irene; Ibba, Anastasia; Maghnie, Mohamad\n\n2018-01-01\n\nGrowth hormone (GH) is essential not only for normal growth during childhood, but also for the acquisition of bone mass and muscle strength in both sexes. This process is completed after the achievement of adult height in the phase of transition from adolescence to adulthood. Adolescents with childhood onset GH deficiency (GHD) show reduction of bone mineral density, decrease in lean body mass, increase in fat mass, and deterioration of the lipid profile. For this reason, continuation of GH replacement therapy in the transition age is recommended in all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of GHD. To confirm the diagnosis of GHD, GH treatment should be discontinued for at least 1 month after the attainment of adult height, and the patient should be re-evaluated for GH secretion. Current guidelines indicate that retesting is not required for those with a transcription factor mutation, more than 3 pituitary hormone deficits, or isolated GHD associated with an identified mutation. The key predictors of persistent GHD are its severity, the presence of additional pituitary hormone deficits, low insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentration, and the presence of structural hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities Treatment should be initiated with a low dose (0.2-0.5 mg/day s.c.) and then adjusted according to IGF-I concentrations.

After detection of a heterozygous, non-synonymous mutation R179C in exon 6 in one single patient with acquired GH-deficiency (GHD) in late adulthood, analysis of her clinical data followed, leading to the diagnosis of mild short stature (-1.5SD). For further endocrine evaluation, five pituitary stimulation tests (arginine) of this patient were statistically compared to stimulation tests (arginine) of ten GH-deficient control patients, retrospectively. The formerly in patients with Laron syndrome and idiopathic short stature reported mutation R179C leads to an amino acid change from an arginine residue (codon CGC) to a cysteine residue (codon TGC) in position 179 of the extracellular domain of the GHR. Statistical analysis revealed significant decreased IGF-I/GH(0) ratio (p=0.004) and IGF-I/GH(max) ratio (p=0.001) of the index patient compared to the control patients, implying growth hormone resistance of the index patient at the level of the GHR, according to the detected R179C mutation. This study reports on the unusual case of a patient with mild short stature, who acquired GHD in late adulthood due to a non-secreting pituitary adenoma and get additionally diagnosed for pre-existing growth hormone insensitivity due to a formerly in two short statured patients described, single, heterozygous, non-synonymous mutation in the GHR. Our findings support the\n\nLong-term response to recombinant human growth hormone treatment: a new predictive mathematical method.\n\nPubMed\n\nMigliaretti, G; Ditaranto, S; Guiot, C; Vannelli, S; Matarazzo, P; Cappello, N; Stura, I; Cavallo, F\n\n2018-07-01\n\nRecombinant GH has been offered to GH-deficient (GHD) subjects for more than 30Â years, in order to improve height and growth velocity in children and to enhance metabolic effects in adults. The aim of our work is to describe the long-term effect of rhGH treatment in GHD pediatric patients, suggesting a growth prediction model. A homogeneous database is defined for diagnosis and treatment modalities, based on GHD patients afferent to Hospital Regina Margherita in Turin (Italy). In this study, 232 GHD patients are selected (204 idiopathic GHD and 28 organic GHD). Each measure is shown in terms of mean with relative standard deviations (SD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). To estimate the final height of each patient on the basis of few measures, a mathematical growth prediction model [based on Gompertzian function and a mixed method based on the radial basis functions (RBFs) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) models] was performed. The results seem to highlight the benefits of an early start of treatment, further confirming what is suggested by the literature. Generally, the RBF-PSO method shows a good reliability in the prediction of the final height. Indeed, RMSE is always lower than 4, i.e., in average the forecast will differ at most of 4Â cm to the real value. In conclusion, the large and accurate database of Italian GHD patients allowed us to assess the rhGH treatment efficacy and compare the results with those obtained in other Countries. Moreover, we proposed and validated a new mathematical model forecasting the expected final height after therapy which was validated on our cohort.\n\nChanges in circulating IGF1 receptor stimulating activity do not parallel changes in total IGF1 during GH treatment of GH-deficient adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nVarewijck, Aimee J; Lamberts, Steven W J; van der Lely, A J; Neggers, Sebastian J C M M; Hofland, Leo J; Janssen, Joseph A M J L\n\n2015-08-01\n\nPreviously we demonstrated that IGF1 receptor stimulating activity (IGF1RSA) offers advantages in diagnostic evaluation of adult GH deficiency (GHD).
