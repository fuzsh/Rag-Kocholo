For you, this means: A wider choice <strong>of</strong> providers and locations. Access to care in facilities owned and operated by providers. Some health plans provide coverage through a group <strong>of</strong> employed doctors and staff, in clinics owned and operated by the plan. In contrast, we believe our approach expands your choices, helps strengthen the patient-doctor relationship, and provides care in a more personal, relaxed setting. Our approach also means that occasionally providers join and leave our plan. This directory is a listing <strong>of</strong> providers as <strong>of</strong> July 2007. HNE cannot guarantee continued participation <strong>of</strong> any provider listed in this directory. For an updated provider list, please visit www.hne.com. <strong>Provider</strong>s listed in this directory are independent contractors and are not employees or agents <strong>of</strong> HNE.
