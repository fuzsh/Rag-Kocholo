The nature of the simulation of the radiotherapy planning for BNCT and Fast Neutron Therapy, etc., requires that the doses be computed in the entire volume. The \"entire volume\" includes the patient and beam geometries as well as the air spaces in between. Isodoses derived from the computed doses will therefore extend into the air regions between the patient and beam geometries and thus depict the unrealistic possibility that radiation deposition occurs in regions containing no physical media. This problem is solved by computing the doses for the entire geometry and then masking the physical and air regions along with the isodose contours superimposed over the patient image at the corresponding plane. The user is thus able to mask out (remove) the contour lines from the unwanted areas of the image by selecting the appropriate contour masking region from the raster image.\n\nDose factor entry and display tool for BNCT radiotherapy\n\nDOEpatents\n\nWessol, Daniel E.; Wheeler, Floyd J.; Cook, Jeremy L.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nA system for use in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) radiotherapy planning where a biological distribution is calculated using a combination of conversion factors and a previously calculated physical distribution. Conversion factors are presented in a graphical spreadsheet so that a planner can easily view and modify the conversion factors. For radiotherapy in multi-component modalities, such as Fast-Neutron and BNCT, it is necessary to combine each conversion factor component to form an effective dose which is used in radiotherapy planning and evaluation. The Dose Factor Entry and Display System is designed to facilitate planner entry of appropriate conversion factors in a straightforward manner for each component. The effective isodose is then immediately computed and displayed over the appropriate background (e.g. digitized image).\n\nSERA -- An advanced treatment planning system for neutron therapy and BNCT\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNigg, D.W.; Wemple, C.A.; Wessol, D.E.\n\n1999-09-01\n\nDetailed treatment planning calculations on a patient-specific basis are required for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Two integrated treatment planning systems developed specifically for BNCT have been in clinical use in the United States over the past few years. The MacNCTPLAN BNCT treatment planning system is used in the clinical BNCT trials that are underway at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A second system, BNCT{_}rtpe (BNCT radiation therapy planning environment), developed independently by the Idaho national Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in collaboration with Montana State University (MSU), is used for treatment planning in the current series of BNCT clinicalmoreÂ Â» trials for glioblastoma at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). This latter system is also licensed for use at several other BNCT research facilities worldwide. Although the currently available BNCT planning systems have served their purpose well, they suffer from somewhat long computation times (2 to 3 CPU-hours or more per field) relative to standard photon therapy planning software. This is largely due to the need for explicit three-dimensional solutions to the relevant transport equations. The simplifying approximations that work well for photon transport computations are not generally applicable to neutron transport computations. Greater computational speeds for BNCT treatment planning must therefore generally be achieved through the application of improved numerical techniques rather than by simplification of the governing equations. Recent efforts at INEEL and MSU have been directed toward this goal. This has resulted in a new paradigm for this type of calculation and the subsequent creation of the new simulation environment for radiotherapy applications (SERA) treatment planning system for BNCT. SERA is currently in initial clinical testing in connection with the trials at BNL, and it is expected to replace the present BNCT{_}rtpe system upon general\n\nDevelopment of a new multi-modal Monte-Carlo radiotherapy planning system.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumada, H; Nakamura, T; Komeda, M; Matsumura, A\n\n2009-07-01\n\nA new multi-modal Monte-Carlo radiotherapy planning system (developing code: JCDS-FX) is under development at Japan Atomic Energy Agency. This system builds on fundamental technologies of JCDS applied to actual boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) trials in JRR-4. One of features of the JCDS-FX is that PHITS has been applied to particle transport calculation. PHITS is a multi-purpose particle Monte-Carlo transport code. Hence application of PHITS enables to evaluate total doses given to a patient by a combined modality therapy. Moreover, JCDS-FX with PHITS can be used for the study of accelerator based BNCT. To verify calculation accuracy of the JCDS-FX, dose evaluations for neutron irradiation of a cylindrical water phantom and for an actual clinical trial were performed, then the results were compared with calculations by JCDS with MCNP. The verification results demonstrated that JCDS-FX is applicable to BNCT treatment planning in practical use.\n\nBoron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) in Finland: technological and physical prospects after 20 years of experiences.\n\nPubMed\n\nSavolainen, Sauli; Kortesniemi, Mika; Timonen, Marjut; Reijonen, Vappu; Kuusela, Linda; Uusi-Simola, Jouni; Salli, Eero; Koivunoro, Hanna; SeppÃ¤lÃ¤, Tiina; LÃ¶nnroth, Nadja; VÃ¤limÃ¤ki, Petteri; HyvÃ¶nen, Heini; Kotiluoto, Petri; SerÃ©n, Tom; Kuronen, Antti; Heikkinen, Sami; Kosunen, Antti; Auterinen, Iiro\n\n2013-05-01\n\nBoron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a binary radiotherapy method developed to treat patients with certain malignant tumours.

Since 1998 we treated 23 newly-diagosed GBM patients with BNCT without any additional chemotherapy. Their median survival time was 19.5 months; the 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 31.8%, 22.7%, and 9.1%, respectively.

This system (developing code: JCDS-FX) builds on fundamental technologies of JCDS. JCDS was developed by JAEA to perform treatment planning of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) which is being conducted at JRR-4 in JAEA. JCDS has many advantages based on practical accomplishments for actual clinical trials of BNCT at JRR-4, the advantages have been taken over to JCDS-FX. One of the features of JCDS-FX is that PHITS has been applied to particle transport calculation. PHITS is a multipurpose particle Monte-Carlo transport code, thus applicationmoreÂ Â» of PHITS enables to evaluate doses for not only BNCT but also several radiotherapies like proton therapy. To verify calculation accuracy of JCDS-FX with PHITS for BNCT, treatment planning of an actual BNCT conducted at JRR-4 was performed retrospectively. The verification results demonstrated the new system was applicable to BNCT clinical trials in practical use. In framework of R and D for laser-driven proton therapy, we begin study for application of JCDS-FX combined with PHITS to proton therapy in addition to BNCT.

The effectiveness of BNCT is limited by the low delivery and accumulation of the used boron-containing compounds. Here we report the development and the characterization of BPO4 nanoparticles (NPs) as a novel possible alternative drug for BNCT. An extensive analysis of BPO4 NP biocompatibility was performed using both mature blood cells (erythrocytes, neutrophils and platelets) and a model of hematopoietic progenitor cells. A time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity study was performed on neoplastic coloncarcinoma and osteosarcoma cell lines. BPO4 functionalization with folic acid, introduced to improve the uptake by tumor cells, appeared to effectively limit the unwanted effects of NPs on the analyzed blood components. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a radiotherapy treatment modality based on the accumulation of a (10)B-containing drug and subsequent irradiation with low energy neutrons, inducing the decay of (10)B to (7)Li and an Î± particle, causing neoplastic cell death. This team of authors reports on a folic acid functionalized BPO4 nanoparticle with improved characteristics compared with conventional BNCT approaches, as demonstrated in tumor cell lines, and hopefully to be followed by translational human studies.

A flexible software environment is being created that allows planning radiation treatment for these new modalities and combining different forms of radiation treatment with consideration of biological effects. The system uses common input interfaces, medical image sets for definition of patient geometry and dose reporting protocols. Previously, the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), Montana State University (MSU) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) had accrued experience in the development and application of Monte Carlo based, three-dimensional, computational dosimetry and treatment planning tools for radiotherapy in several specialized areas. In particular, INEEL and MSU have developed computational dosimetry systems for neutron radiotherapy and neutron capture therapy, while LLNL has developed the PEREGRINE computational system for external beam photon-electron therapy. Building on that experience, the INEEL and MSU are developing the MINERVA (modality inclusive environment for radiotherapeutic variable analysis) software system as a general framework for computational dosimetry and treatment planning for a variety of emerging forms of radiotherapy. In collaboration with this development, LLNL has extended its PEREGRINE code to accommodate internal sources for molecular targeted radiotherapy (MTR), and has interfaced it with the plugin architecture of MINERVA. Results from the extended PEREGRINE code have been compared to published data from other codes, and found to be in general agreement (EGS4â2%, MCNPâ10%) (Descalle et al 2003 Cancer Biother. Radiopharm. 18 71-9). The code is currently being benchmarked against experimental data.

The development of BNCT at IRT plays a very significant role in the plan for sustainable application of the reactor. A centralized scientific information system on BNCT is being built at the INRNE with the purpose to collect and sort new information as knowledge accumulated during more than thirty years history of BNCT. This BNCT information system will help the creation and consolidation of a well informed and interconnected interdisciplinary team of physicists, chemists, biologists, and radio-oncologists for establishing BNCT cancer treatment in Bulgaria. It will strengthen more intensive development of the national network as well as its enlargement to the Balkan region countries. Furthermore, to acquaint the public at large with the opportunity for BNCT cancer treatment will be addressed. Human, social, and economics results due to BNCT for many patients from Balkan region are expected.\n\nAn Overview on the Developments and Improvements of a Treatment Planning System for BNCT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCerullo, N.; Daquino, G. G.; Muzi, L.\n\n2006-06-01\n\nBoron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a radiation therapy for cancer that employs a neutron beam and a /sup 10/B-loaded drug to selectively kill tumor cells whilst sparing surrounding healthy tissues (HT). In conventional radiation therapy, treatment planning systems (TPSs) implementing simplified models of radiation transport and dose deposition allow to efficiently optimize all the relevant parameters prior to the patient's irradiation. This simplified approach is not feasible in BNCT, because the presence of neutrons requires the use of more complex radiation transport models. For this reason, current BNCT TPSs routinely perform several radiation transport simulations based on the Monte Carlo method. Our team has been involved in BNCT TPS research since 1996, introducing the original trait of employing in the simulation a three-dimensional map of the highly heterogeneous boron distribution in tissues, obtained through PET scanning of the target region. This approach differs markedly from the standard one, in which boron concentration is assumed to be uniform in each \"macro region\" within the patient's head, and its value is estimated on the basis of blood sampling. The first result of this research was the prototype software CARONTE, employed to test the feasibility of the new approach and to carry out a comparative study by applying the two different approaches to the same test case. The results, presented in this paper in terms of the computed physical dose rate due to the /sup 10/B reaction, show how the different assumptions made in the two approaches can significantly influence important TP parameters. This led to the development of Boron Distribution TP Software (BDTPS), an original and complete TPS. The different phases of the experimental validation of BDTPS, which included the design and construction of an ad hoc phantom able to host a number of vials loaded with /sup 10/B solutions, is presented here. The phantom, which subsequently underwent\n\n124Sb-Be photo-neutron source for BNCT: Is it possible?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGolshanian, Mohadeseh; Rajabi, Ali Akbar; Kasesaz, Yaser\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIn this research a computational feasibility study has been done on the use of 124SbBe photo-neutron source for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) using MCNPX Monte Carlo code. For this purpose, a special beam shaping assembly has been designed to provide an appropriate epithermal neutron beam suitable for BNCT. The final result shows that using 150 kCi of 124Sb, the epithermal neutron flux at the designed beam exit is 0.23Ã109 (n/cm2 s). In-phantom dose analysis indicates that treatment time for a brain tumor is about 40 min which is a reasonable time. This high activity 124Sb could be achieved using three 50 kCi rods of 124Sb which can be produced in a research reactor. It is clear, that as this activity is several hundred times the activity of a typical cobalt radiotherapy source, issues related to handling, safety and security must be addressed.\n\n\"Sequential\" boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT): a novel approach to BNCT for the treatment of oral cancer in the hamster cheek pouch model.\n\nPubMed\n\nMolinari, Ana J; Pozzi, Emiliano C C; Monti Hughes, Andrea; Heber, Elisa M; Garabalino, Marcela A; Thorp, Silvia I; Miller, Marcelo; Itoiz, Maria E; Aromando, Romina F; Nigg, David W; Quintana, Jorge; Santa Cruz, Gustavo A; Trivillin, VerÃ³nica A; Schwint, Amanda E\n\n2011-04-01\n\nIn the present study the therapeutic effect and potential toxicity of the novel \"Sequential\" boron neutron capture therapy (Seq-BNCT) for the treatment of oral cancer was evaluated in the hamster cheek pouch model at the RA-3 Nuclear Reactor. Two groups of animals were treated with \"Sequential\" BNCT, i.e., BNCT mediated by boronophenylalanine (BPA) followed by BNCT mediated by sodium decahydrodecaborate (GB-10) either 24 h (Seq-24h-BNCT) or 48 h (Seq-48h-BNCT) later. In an additional group of animals, BPA and GB-10 were administered concomitantly [(BPA + GB-10)-BNCT]. The single-application BNCT was to the same total physical tumor dose as the \"Sequential\" BNCT treatments. At 28 days post-treatment, Seq-24h-BNCT and Seq-48h-BNCT induced, respectively, overall tumor responses of 95 Â± 2% and 91 Â± 3%, with no statistically significant differences between protocols. Overall response for the single treatment with (BPA + GB-10)-BNCT was 75 Â± 5%, significantly lower than for Seq-BNCT. Both Seq-BNCT protocols and (BPA + GB-10)-BNCT induced reversible mucositis in the dose-limiting precancerous tissue around treated tumors, reaching Grade 3/4 mucositis in 47 Â± 12% and 60 Â± 22% of the animals, respectively. No normal tissue toxicity was associated with tumor response for any of the protocols. \"Sequential\" BNCT enhanced tumor response without an increase in mucositis in dose-limiting precancerous tissue.

It is a combination of specially developed in-house software that uses an application programming interface to communicate with a commercial radiotherapy treatment planning system. It also interfaces with a commercial secondary dose verification software. The necessary inputs to the system are a Treatment Plan Order, approved by the radiation oncologist, and a simulation computed tomography (CT) image, approved by the radiographer. The RPA then generates a complete radiotherapy treatment plan. For the cervical cancer treatment plans, no additional user intervention is necessary until the plan is complete. For head/neck treatment plans, after the normal tissue and some of the target structures are automatically delineated on the CT image, the radiation oncologist must review the contours, making edits if necessary. They also delineate the gross tumor volume. The RPA then completes the treatment planning process, creating a VMAT plan. Finally, the completed plan must be reviewed by qualified clinical staff.

Geographic misses in radiotherapy planning may play a role in this seemingly ineluctable recurrence. Planning is typically performed on post-contrast MRIs, which are known to underreport tumour volume relative to FDOPA PET scans. FDOPA PET fused with contrast enhanced MRI has demonstrated greater sensitivity and specificity than MRI alone. One sign of potential misses would be differences between gross target volumes (GTVs) defined using MRI alone and when fused with PET. This work examined whether such a discrepancy may occur. Materials and Methods: For six patients, a 75 minute PET scan using 3,4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluoro-L-phynel-alanine (18F-FDOPA) was taken within 2 days of gadolinium enhanced MRI scans. In addition to standard radiotherapy planning by an experienced radiotherapy oncologist, a second gross target volume (GTV) was defined by an experienced nuclear medicine specialist for fused PET and MRI, while blinded to the radiotherapy plans. The volumes from standard radiotherapy planning were compared to the PET defined GTV. Results: The comparison indicated radiotherapy planning would change in several cases if FDOPA PET data was available. PET-defined contours were external to 95% prescribed dose for several patients. However, due to the radiotherapy margins, the discrepancies were relatively small in size and all received a dose of 50 Gray or more. Conclusions: Given the limited size of the discrepancies it is uncertain that geographic misses played a major role in patient outcome. Even so, the existence of discrepancies indicates that FDOPA PET could assist in better defining margins when planning radiotherapy for advanced glioma, which could be important for highly conformal radiotherapy plans.\n\nAdvances in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) at kyoto university - From reactor-based BNCT to accelerator-based BNCT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSakurai, Yoshinori; Tanaka, Hiroki; Takata, Takushi; Fujimoto, Nozomi; Suzuki, Minoru; Masunaga, Shinichiro; Kinashi, Yuko; Kondo, Natsuko; Narabayashi, Masaru; Nakagawa, Yosuke; Watanabe, Tsubasa; Ono, Koji; Maruhashi, Akira\n\n2015-07-01\n\nAt the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURRI), a clinical study of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) using a neutron irradiation facility installed at the research nuclear reactor has been regularly performed since February 1990. As of November 2014, 510 clinical irradiations were carried out using the reactor-based system. The world's first accelerator-based neutron irradiation system for BNCT clinical irradiation was completed at this institute in early 2009, and the clinical trial using this system was started in 2012. A shift of BCNT from special particle therapy to a general one is now in progress. To promote and support this shift, improvements to the irradiation system, as well as its preparation, and improvements in the physical engineering and the medical physics processes, such as dosimetry systems and quality assurance programs, must be considered. The recent advances in BNCT at KURRI are reported here with a focus on physical engineering and medical physics topics.\n\nâSequentialâ Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT): A Novel Approach to BNCT for the Treatment of Oral Cancer in the Hamster Cheek Pouch Model\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAna J.

In this study, simulations and experimental measurements have been carried out to identify the BNCT beam parameters including the beam uniformity, the distribution of the thermal neutron dose, boron dose, gamma dose in a phantom and also the Therapeutic Gain (TG). To do this, the entire TRR structure including the reactor core, pool, the thermal column and beam tubes have been modeled using MCNPX Monte Carlo code. To measure in-phantom dose distribution a special head phantom has been constructed and foil activation techniques and TLD700 dosimeter have been used. The results show that there is enough uniformity in TRR thermal BNCT beam. TG parameter has the maximum value of 5.7 at the depth of 1 cm from the surface of the phantom, confirming that TRR thermal neutron beam has potential for being used in treatment of superficial brain tumors. For the purpose of a clinical trial, more modifications need to be done at the reactor, as, for example design, and construction of a treatment room at the beam exit which is our plan for future. To date, this beam is usable for biological studies and animal trials. There is a relatively good agreement between simulation and measurement especially within a diameter of 10 cm which is the dimension of usual BNCT beam ports.

Tsukuba Plan allows for dose estimation in proton therapy, X-ray therapy and heavy ion therapy in addition to BNCT because the system employs PHITS as the Monte Carlo dose calculation engine. Regarding BNCT, several verifications of the system are being carried out for its practical usage. The verification results demonstrate that Tsukuba Plan allows for accurate estimation of thermal neutron flux and gamma-ray dose as fundamental radiations of dosimetry in BNCT. In addition to the practical use of Tsukuba Plan in BNCT, we are investigating its application to other radiation therapies. Â© The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

This phase II study included 30 patients, 26-69 years old, with a good performance status of which 27 have undergone debulking surgery. BPA-F (900 mg BPA/kg body weight) was given i.v. over 6h. Neutron irradiation started 2h after the completion of the infusion. Follow-up reports were monitored by an independent clinical research institute. The boron-blood concentration during irradiation was 15.2-33.7 microg/g. The average weighted absorbed dose to normal brain was 3.2-6.1 Gy (W). The minimum dose to the tumour volume ranged from 15.4 to 54.3 Gy (W). Seven patients suffered from seizures, 8 from skin/mucous problem, 5 patients were stricken by thromboembolism and 4 from abdominal disturbances in close relation to BNCT. Four patients displayed 9 episodes of grade 3-4 events (WHO). At the time for follow-up, minimum ten months, 23 out of the 29 evaluable patients were dead. The median time from BNCT treatment to tumour progression was 5.8 months and the median survival time after BNCT was 14.2 months. Following progression, 13 patients were given temozolomide, two patients were re-irradiated, and two were re-operated. Patients treated with temozolomide lived considerably longer (17.7 vs. 11.6 months). The quality of life analysis demonstrated a progressive deterioration after BNCT. Although, the efficacy of BNCT in the present protocol seems to be comparable with conventional radiotherapy and the treatment time is shorter, the observed side effects and the requirement of complex infrastructure and higher resources emphasize the need of further phase I and II studies, especially directed to improve the accumulation of (10)B in tumour cells.\n\n[Integration of the radiotherapy irradiation planning in the digital workflow].\n\nPubMed\n\nRÃ¶hner, F; Schmucker, M; Henne, K; Momm, F; Bruggmoser, G; Grosu, A-L; Frommhold, H; Heinemann, F E\n\n2013-02-01\n\nAt the Clinic of Radiotherapy at the University Hospital Freiburg, all relevant workflow is paperless. After implementing the Operating Schedule System (OSS) as a framework, all processes are being implemented into the departmental system MOSAIQ. Designing a digital workflow for radiotherapy irradiation planning is a large challenge, it requires interdisciplinary expertise and therefore the interfaces between the professions also have to be interdisciplinary. For every single step of radiotherapy irradiation planning, distinct responsibilities have to be defined and documented. All aspects of digital storage, backup and long-term availability of data were considered and have already been realized during the OSS project. After an analysis of the complete workflow and the statutory requirements, a detailed project plan was designed. In an interdisciplinary workgroup, problems were discussed and a detailed flowchart was developed. The new functionalities were implemented in a testing environment by the Clinical and Administrative IT Department (CAI). After extensive tests they were integrated into the new modular department system. The Clinic of Radiotherapy succeeded in realizing a completely digital workflow for radiotherapy irradiation planning. During the testing phase, our digital workflow was examined and afterwards was approved by the responsible authority.\n\nBoron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) in an oral precancer model: therapeutic benefits and potential toxicity of a double application of BNCT with a six-week interval.\n\nPubMed\n\nMonti Hughes, Andrea; Pozzi, Emiliano C C; Heber, Elisa M; Thorp, Silvia; Miller, Marcelo; Itoiz, Maria E; Aromando, Romina F; Molinari, Ana J; Garabalino, Marcela A; Nigg, David W; Trivillin, VerÃ³nica A; Schwint, Amanda E\n\n2011-11-01\n\nGiven the clinical relevance of locoregional recurrences in head and neck cancer, we developed a novel experimental model of premalignant tissue in the hamster cheek pouch for long-term studies and demonstrated the partial inhibitory effect of a single application of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) on tumor development from premalignant tissue. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a double application of BNCT with a 6 week interval in terms of inhibitory effect on tumor development, toxicity and DNA synthesis. We performed a double application, 6 weeks apart, of (1) BNCT mediated by boronophenylalanine (BPA-BNCT); (2) BNCT mediated by the combined application of decahydrodecaborate (GB-10) and BPA [(GB-10+BPA)-BNCT] or (3) beam-only, at RA-3 nuclear reactor and followed the animals for 8 months. The control group was cancerized and sham-irradiated. BPA-BNCT, (GB-10+BPA)-BNCT and beam-only induced a reduction in tumor development from premalignant tissue that persisted until 8, 3, and 2 months respectively. An early maximum inhibition of 100% was observed for all 3 protocols. No normal tissue radiotoxicity was detected. Reversible mucositis was observed in premalignant tissue, peaking at 1 week and resolving by the third week after each irradiation. Mucositis after the second application was not exacerbated by the first application. DNA synthesis was significantly reduced in premalignant tissue 8 months post-BNCT. A double application of BPA-BNCT and (GB-10+BPA)-BNCT, 6 weeks apart, could be used therapeutically at no additional cost in terms of radiotoxicity in normal and dose-limiting tissues.

It is a binary treatment modality that requires selective delivery of a {sup 10}B-labeled compound to a tumor and slow neutron irradiation of the tumor-bearing tissues. In order to improve the penetration of the neutron beam, an epithermal neutron beam was developed at the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor (BMRR). This epithermal neutron beam can deliver relatively high thermal neutron fluence at depth without severe skin damage. Boronophenylalanine-fructose (BPA-F), a nontoxic boron carrier, was found to preferentially accumulate in tumor cells following intravenous infusion in patients with GBM. InmoreÂ Â» preclinical BNCT studies in rats bearing 9L gliosarcoma, BPA-mediated BNCT was shown to be more efficacious than photon irradiation. In 1994, improvements in the neutron beam and in the understanding of the radiobiology of BPA-mediated BNCT led to the initiation of BNCT trials for human GBM at BMRR using BPA-F and epithermal neutrons. The primary objective of the phase I/II clinical trial of BPA-mediated BNCT at BMRR is to evaluate the safety of the BPA-F-mediated BNCT using epithermal neutrons in patients with GBM at a series of escalating BNCT doses. An incidental objective is to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of BNCT at each dose level. For each dose escalation group, the average brain dose (ABD) is escalated, as well as the minimum tumor dose. In summary, the BNCT procedure employed in the phase I/II clinical trial of BPA-F-mediated BNCT for GBM at BNL was found to be safe in all patients. The palliation afforded by a single session of BNCT compares favorably with palliation provided by fractionated photon therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. If no evidence of radiation-induced brain toxicity is found in the current protocol, BNCT radiation dose will be further escalated.Â«Â less\n\nNeutron beams implemented at nuclear research reactors for BNCT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBavarnegin, E.; Kasesaz, Y.; Wagner, F. M.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis paper presents a survey of neutron beams which were or are in use at 56 Nuclear Research Reactors (NRRs) in order to be used for BNCT, either for treatment or research purposes in aspects of various combinations of materials that were used in their Beam Shaping Assembly (BSA) design, use of fission converters and optimized beam parameters. All our knowledge about BNCT is indebted to researches that have been done in NRRs. The results of about 60 years research in BNCT and also the successes of this method in medical treatment of tumors show that, for the development of BNCT as a routine cancer therapy method, hospital-based neutron sources are needed. Achieving a physical data collection on BNCT neutron beams based on NRRs will be helpful for beam designers in developing a non-reactor based neutron beam.\n\nCritical review, with an optimistic outlook, on Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT).\n\nPubMed\n\nMoss, Raymond L\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe first BNCT trials took place in the USA in the early 1960's, yet BNCT is still far from mainstream medicine. Nonetheless, in recent years, reported results in the treatment of head and neck cancer and recurrent glioma, coupled with the progress in developing linear accelerators specifically for BNCT applications, have given some optimism to the future of BNCT. This article provides a brief reminder on the ups and downs of the history of BNCT and supports the view that controlled and prospective clinical trials with a modern design will make BNCT an evidence-based treatment modality within the coming decade.

Our group has initiated a multi-pronged approach to reduce these errors. We report on our development of Bayesian models of radiotherapy plans. Bayesian networks consist of joint probability distributions that define the probability of one event, given some set of other known information. Using the networks, we find the probability of obtaining certain radiotherapy parameters, given a set of initial clinical information. A low probability in a propagated network then corresponds to potential errors to be flagged for investigation. To build our networks we first interviewed medical physicists and other domain experts to identify the relevant radiotherapy concepts and their associated interdependencies and to construct a network topology. Next, to populate the networkâs conditional probability tables, we used the Hugin Expert software to learn parameter distributions from a subset of de-identified data derived from a radiation oncology based clinical information database system. These data represent 4990 unique prescription cases over a 5 year period. Under test case scenarios with approximately 1.5% introduced error rates, network performance produced areas under the ROC curve of 0.88, 0.98, and 0.89 for the lung, brain and female breast cancer error detection networks, respectively. Comparison of the brain network to human experts performance (AUC of 0.90 Â± 0.01) shows the Bayes network model performs better than domain experts under the same test conditions. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of comprehensive probabilistic models as part of decision support systems for improved detection of errors in initial radiotherapy plan verification procedures.\n\nRadiotherapy Planning using MRI\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchmidt, Maria A; Payne, Geoffrey S\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Radiotherapy (RT) planning is rapidly expanding. We review the wide range of image contrast mechanisms available to MRI and the way they are exploited for RT planning. However a number of challenges are also considered: the requirements that MR images are acquired in the RT treatment position, that they are geometrically accurate, that effects of patient motion during the scan are minimised, that tissue markers are clearly demonstrated, that an estimate of electron density can be obtained. These issues are discussed in detail, prior to the consideration of a number of specific clinical applications. This is followed by a brief discussion on the development of real-time MRI-guided RT.

This study documented and evaluated the outcomes of weekly, disease site-specific, radiotherapy peer review, quality assurance rounds at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary, Canada with a view to making recommendations about the optimal timing and documentation of peer review during the radiotherapy planning processes. Outcomes of each case reviewed at (i) breast, (ii) head and neck (including thyroid and cutaneous cases) and (iii) lung team quality assurance rounds from 6 January to 5 May 2015 were recorded prospectively. Each radiotherapy plan was assigned an outcome: A for plans with no suggested changes; B for satisfactory, but where issues were raised to consider for future patients; or C when a change was recommended before the first or next fraction. The B outcomes were further subdivided into B1 for a case-specific concern and B2 for a policy gap. Plans were assessed after contour definition and before the plan was formulated (post-contouring reviews) and/or assessed when the plan was complete (post-planning reviews). 209 radiotherapy plans prescribed by 20 radiation oncologists were peer reviewed at 43 quality assurance meetings. 93% were curative-intent and 7% were palliative. 83% of plans were reviewed before delivery of the first treatment fraction. There were a total of 257 case reviews: 60 at the post-contouring stage, 197 at the post-planning stage, including 46 patients reviewed at both time points. Overall rates of A, B1, B2 and C outcomes were 78%, 9%, 4% and 9%, respectively. The most common reason for a B or C outcome was related to target volume definition. Only 56% of C outcomes at the post-planning stage would have been detected at the post-contouring stage. Results varied between tumour site groups. 9% of\n\nRadiotherapy Treatment Planning for Testicular Seminoma\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWilder, Richard B., E-mail: richardbwilder@yahoo.com; Buyyounouski, Mark K.; Efstathiou, Jason A.\n\n2012-07-15\n\nVirtually all patients with Stage I testicular seminoma are cured regardless of postorchiectomy management. For patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, late toxicity is a major concern. However, toxicity may be limited by radiotherapy techniques that minimize radiation exposure of healthy normal tissues. This article is an evidence-based review that provides radiotherapy treatment planning recommendations for testicular seminoma. The minority of Stage I patients who choose adjuvant treatment over surveillance may be considered for (1) para-aortic irradiation to 20 Gy in 10 fractions, or (2) carboplatin chemotherapy consisting of area under the curve, AUC = 7 Multiplication-Sign 1-2 cycles. Two-dimensional radiotherapymoreÂ Â» based on bony anatomy is a simple and effective treatment for Stage IIA or IIB testicular seminoma. Centers with expertise in vascular and nodal anatomy may consider use of anteroposterior-posteroanterior fields based on three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy instead. For modified dog-leg fields delivering 20 Gy in 10 fractions, clinical studies support placement of the inferior border at the top of the acetabulum. Clinical and nodal mapping studies support placement of the superior border of all radiotherapy fields at the top of the T12 vertebral body. For Stage IIA and IIB patients, an anteroposterior-posteroanterior boost is then delivered to the adenopathy with a 2-cm margin to the block edge. The boost dose consists of 10 Gy in 5 fractions for Stage IIA and 16 Gy in 8 fractions for Stage IIB. Alternatively, bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin chemotherapy for 3 cycles or etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy for 4 cycles may be delivered to Stage IIA or IIB patients (e.g., if they have a horseshoe kidney, inflammatory bowel disease, or a history of radiotherapy).Â«Â less\n\nINEL BNCT Program\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAckermann, A.L.\n\n1991-08-01\n\nThis Bulletin presents a summary of accomplishments and highlights in the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory's (INEL) Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) Program for August 1991.

It provides a new type of information in radiotherapy, functional rather than anatomical. PET imaging can also be used for target volume definition in radiotherapy treatment planning. The need for very precise target volume delineation has arisen with the increasing use of sophisticated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy techniques and intensity modulated radiation therapy. It is expected that better delineation of the target volume may lead to a significant reduction in the irradiated volume, thus lowering the risk of treatment complications (smaller safety margins). Better tumour visualisation also allows a higher dose of radiation to be applied to the tumour, which may lead to better tumour control. The aim of this article is to review the possible use of PET imaging in the radiotherapy of various cancers. We focus mainly on non-small cell lung cancer, lymphoma and oesophageal cancer, but also include current opinion on the use of PET-based planning in other tumours including brain, uterine cervix, rectum and prostate.\n\nRadiotherapy for gastric lymphoma: a planning study of 3D conformal radiotherapy, the half-beam method, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nInaba, Koji; Okamoto, Hiroyuki; Wakita, Akihisa; Nakamura, Satoshi; Kobayashi, Kazuma; Harada, Ken; Kitaguchi, Mayuka; Sekii, Shuhei; Takahashi, Kana; Yoshio, Kotaro; Murakami, Naoya; Morota, Madoka; Ito, Yoshinori; Sumi, Minako; Uno, Takashi; Itami, Jun\n\n2014-11-01\n\nDuring radiotherapy for gastric lymphoma, it is difficult to protect the liver and kidneys in cases where there is considerable overlap between these organs and the target volume. This study was conducted to compare the three radiotherapy planning techniques of four-fields 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), half-field radiotherapy (the half-beam method) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) used to treat primary gastric lymphoma in which the planning target volume (PTV) had a large overlap with the left kidney. A total of 17 patients with gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) were included. In DLBCL, immunochemotherapy (Rituximab + CHOP) was followed by radiotherapy of 40 Gy to the whole stomach and peri-gastric lymph nodes. 3DCRT, the half-field method, and IMRT were compared with respect to the dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters and generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) to the kidneys, liver and PTV. The mean dose and gEUD for 3DCRT was higher than for IMRT and the half-beam method in the left kidney and both kidneys. The mean dose and gEUD of the left kidney was 2117 cGy and 2224 cGy for 3DCRT, 1520 cGy and 1637 cGy for IMRT, and 1100 cGy and 1357 cGy for the half-beam method, respectively. The mean dose and gEUD of both kidneys was 1335 cGy and 1559 cGy for 3DCRT, 1184 cGy and 1311 cGy for IMRT, and 700 cGy and 937 cGy for the half-beam method, respectively. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the liver revealed a larger volume was irradiated in the dose range <25 Gy with 3DCRT, while the half-beam method irradiated a larger volume of liver with the higher dose range (>25 Gy). IMRT and the half-beam method had the advantages of dose reduction for the kidneys and liver. Â© The Author 2014.

First case includes a beam shaping assembly estimation for a D-T neutron source to find epi-thermal neutrons which are the goal in the BNCT. Second issue is the percent depth dose calculation in the adult Snyder head phantom. Monte-Carlo simulations and verification of a suggested beam shaping assembly (including internal neutron multiplier, moderator, filter, external neutron multiplier, collimator, and reflector dimensions) for thermalizing a D-T neutron source as well as increasing neutron flux are carried out and our results are given herein. Finally, we have simulated its corresponding doses for treatment planning of a deeply-seated tumor.\n\nLong range healthcare capacity planning in the Netherlands. The case of radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nPostma, T J B M; Terpstra, S\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThis contribution discusses centralization vs. decentralization in healthcare strategic decision making, focusing on long-range planning of facilities for radiotherapy. The radiotherapy case illustrates that more centralized, comprehensive, and systematic planning and strategic decisions making may be necessary to account for inputs of various parties and decision-making levels in this area. The expertise required cannot generally be found at a local or even regional level. It requires initiatives from coordinating healthcare institutions such as the Health Council and other professional organizations.\n\nAutomatic planning on hippocampal avoidance whole-brain radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Shuo; Zheng, Dandan; Zhang, Chi; Ma, Rongtao; Bennion, Nathan R; Lei, Yu; Zhu, Xiaofeng; Enke, Charles A; Zhou, Sumin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMounting evidence suggests that radiation-induced damage to the hippocampus plays a role in neurocognitive decline for patients receiving whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT).

The main focus of the audit is the dosimetry verification of the delivery of a radiation treatment plan for three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy using high energy photon beams. The audit has been carried out in eight European countries - Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Serbia, Slovakia, Poland and Portugal. The corresponding results are presented. The TPS audit reviews the dosimetry, treatment planning and radiotherapy delivery processes using the 'end-to-end' approach, i.e. following the pathway similar to that of the patient, through imaging, treatment planning and dose delivery. The audit is implemented at the national level with IAEA assistance. The national counterparts conduct the TPS audit at local radiotherapy centres through on-site visits. TPS calculated doses are compared with ion chamber measurements performed in an anthropomorphic phantom for eight test cases per algorithm/beam. A set of pre-defined agreement criteria is used to analyse the performance of TPSs. TPS audit was carried out in 60 radiotherapy centres. In total, 190 data sets (combination of algorithm and beam quality) have been collected and reviewed. Dosimetry problems requiring interventions were discovered in about 10% of datasets. In addition, suboptimal beam modelling in TPSs was discovered in a number of cases. The TPS audit project using the IAEA methodology has verified the treatment planning system calculations for 3D conformal radiotherapy in a group of radiotherapy centres in Europe. It contributed to achieving better understanding of the performance of TPSs and helped to resolve issues related to imaging, dosimetry and treatment planning.\n\nA new methodological approach for PET implementation in radiotherapy treatment planning.\n\nPubMed\n\nBellan, Elena; Ferretti, Alice; Capirci, Carlo; Grassetto, Gaia; Gava, Marcello; Chondrogiannis, Sotirios; Virdis, Graziella; Marzola, Maria Cristina; Massaro, Arianna; Rubello, Domenico; Nibale, Otello\n\n2012-05-01\n\nIn this paper, a new methodological approach to using PET information in radiotherapy treatment planning has been discussed. Computed tomography (CT) represents the primary modality to plan personalized radiation treatment, because it provides the basic electron density map for correct dose calculation. If PET scanning is also performed it is typically coregistered with the CT study. This operation can be executed automatically by a hybrid PET/CT scanner or, if the PET and CT imaging sets have been acquired through different equipment, by a dedicated module of the radiotherapy treatment planning system. Both approaches have some disadvantages: in the first case, the bore of a PET/CT system generally used in clinical practice often does not allow the use of certain bulky devices for patient immobilization in radiotherapy, whereas in the second case the result could be affected by limitations in window/level visualization of two different image modalities, and the displayed PET volumes can appear not to be related to the actual uptake into the patient. To overcome these problems, at our centre a specific procedure has been studied and tested in 30 patients, allowing good results of precision in the target contouring to be obtained. The process consists of segmentation of the biological target volume by a dedicated PET/CT console and its export to a dedicated radiotherapy system, where an image registration between the CT images acquired by the PET/CT scanner and a large-bore CT is performed. The planning target volume is contoured only on the large-bore CT and is used for virtual simulation, to individuate permanent skin markers on the patient.\n\nAn Accelerator Neutron Source for BNCT\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBlue, Thomas, E\n\n2006-03-14\n\nThe overall goal of this project was to develop an accelerator-based neutron source (ABNS) for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). Specifically, our goals were to design, and confirm by measurement, a target assembly and a moderator assembly that would fulfill the design requirements of the ABNS. These design requirements were 1) that the neutron field quality be as good as the neutron field quality for the reactor-based neutron sources for BNCT, 2) that the patient treatment time be reasonable, 3) that the proton current required to treat patients in reasonable times be technologially achievable at reasonable cost with good reliability,moreÂ Â» and accelerator space requirements which can be met in a hospital, and finally 4) that the treatment be safe for the patients.Â«Â less\n\nAssessing advantages of sequential boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) in an oral cancer model with normalized blood vessels.\n\nPubMed\n\nMolinari, Ana J; Thorp, Silvia I; Portu, Agustina M; Saint Martin, Gisela; Pozzi, Emiliano C C; Heber, Elisa M; Bortolussi, Silva; Itoiz, Maria E; Aromando, Romina F; Monti Hughes, Andrea; Garabalino, Marcela A; Altieri, Saverio; Trivillin, VerÃ³nica A; Schwint, Amanda E\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe previously demonstrated the therapeutic success of sequential boron neutron capture therapy (Seq-BNCT) in the hamster cheek pouch oral cancer model. It consists of BPA-BNCT followed by GB-10-BNCT 24 or 48 hours later. Additionally, we proved that tumor blood vessel normalization with thalidomide prior to BPA-BNCT improves tumor control. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and explore potential boron microdistribution changes in Seq-BNCT preceded by tumor blood vessel normalization. Tumor bearing animals were treated with thalidomide for tumor blood vessel normalization, followed by Seq-BNCT (Th+ Seq-BNCT) or Seq-Beam Only (Th+ Seq-BO) in the window of normalization. Boron microdistribution was assessed by neutron autoradiography. Th+ Seq-BNCT induced overall tumor response of 100%, with 87 (4)% complete tumor response. No cases of severe mucositis in dose-limiting precancerous tissue were observed. Differences in boron homogeneity between tumors pre-treated and not pre-treated with thalidomide were observed. Th+ Seq-BNCT achieved, for the first time, response in all treated tumors. Increased homogeneity in tumor boron microdistribution is associated to an improvement in tumor control.\n\nRadiobiological concepts for treatment planning of schemes that combines external beam radiotherapy and systemic targeted radiotherapy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFabiÃ¡n CalderÃ³n MarÃ­n, Carlos; GonzÃ¡lez GonzÃ¡lez, JoaquÃ­n Jorge; Laguardia, Rodolfo Alfonso\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe combination of radiotherapy modalities with external bundles and systemic radiotherapy (CIERT) could be a reliable alternative for patients with multiple lesions or those where treatment planning maybe difficult because organ(s)-at-risk (OARs) constraints. Radiobiological models should have the capacity for predicting the biological irradiation response considering the differences in the temporal pattern of dose delivering in both modalities. Two CIERT scenarios were studied: sequential combination in which one modality is executed following the other one and concurrent combination when both modalities are running simultaneously. Expressions are provided for calculation of the dose-response magnitudes Tumor Control Probability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP). General results on radiobiological modeling using the linear-quadratic (LQ) model are also discussed. Inter-subject variation of radiosensitivity and volume irradiation effect in CIERT are studied. OARs should be under control during the planning in concurrent CIERT treatment as the administered activity is increased. The formulation presented here may be used for biological evaluation of prescriptions and biological treatment planning of CIERT schemes in clinical situation.\n\nSU-F-T-358: Is Auto-Planning Useful for Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy Planning in Rectal Cancer Radiotherapy?\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLi, K; Chang, X; Wang, J\n\nPurpose: To evaluate whether Auto-Planning based volumetric-modulated radiotherapy (auto-VMAT) can reduce manual interaction time during treatment planning and improve plan quality for rectal cancer radiotherapy. Methods: Ten rectal cancer patients (stage II and III) after radical resection using Dixon surgery were enrolled. All patients were treated with VMAT technique. The manual VMAT plans (man-VMAT) were designed in the Pinnacle treatment planning system (Version 9.10) following the standard treatment planning procedure developed in our department. Clinical plans were manually designed by our experienced dosimetrists. Additionally, an auto-VMAT plan was created for each patient using Auto-Planning module. However, manual interaction was stillmoreÂ Â» applied to meet the clinical requirements. The treatment planning time and plan quality surrogated by the DVH parameters were compared between manual and automated plans. Results: The total planning time and manual interaction time were 50.38 and 4.47 min for the auto-VMAT and 36.81 and 16.94 min for the man-VMAT (t=60.14,â23.86; p=0.000, 0.000). In terms of plan quality, both plans meet the clinical requirements. The PTV homogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) were 0.054 and 0.822 for the auto-VMAT and 0.059 and 0.815 for the man-VMAT (t=â1.72, 0.36;p=0.119,0.730).Compared to the man-VMAT, the auto-VMAT showed reduction of 11.9% and 0.7% in V40 and V50 of the bladder, respectively.The V30 and D mean were reduced by 14.0% and 5.1Gy in the left femur and 12.2% and 3.8Gy in the right femur. Conclusion: The Auto-Planning based VMAT plans not only shows similar or superior plan quality to the manual ones in the rectal cancer radiotherapy, but also improve the planning efficiency significantly. However, manual interactions are still required to achieve a clinically acceptable plan based on our experiences.Â«Â less\n\nMR Imaging Based Treatment Planning for Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2008-02-01\n\nRadiotherapy, MR-based treatment planning, dosimetry, Monte Carlo dose verification, Prostate Cancer, MRI -based DRRs 16.

It is known, however, that magnetic resonance images are geometrically distorted, thus deteriorating dose delivery accuracy. The present work focuses on the assessment of geometric distortion inherent in magnetic resonance images used in stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy treatment planning and attempts to quantitively evaluate the consequent impact on dose delivery. The geometric distortions for 3 clinical magnetic resonance protocols (at both 1.5 and 3.0 T) used for stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy treatment planning were evaluated using a recently proposed phantom and methodology. Areas of increased distortion were identified at the edges of the imaged volume which was comparable to a brain scan. Although mean absolute distortion did not exceed 0.5 mm on any spatial axis, maximum detected control point disposition reached 2 mm. In an effort to establish what could be considered as acceptable geometric uncertainty, highly conformal plans were utilized to irradiate targets of different diameters (5-50 mm). The targets were mispositioned by 0.5 up to 3 mm, and dose-volume histograms and plan quality indices clinically used for plan evaluation and acceptance were derived and used to investigate the effect of geometrical uncertainty (distortion) on dose delivery accuracy and plan quality. The latter was found to be strongly dependent on target size. For targets less than 20 mm in diameter, a spatial disposition of the order of 1 mm could significantly affect (>5%) plan acceptance/quality indices. For targets with diameter greater than 2 cm, the corresponding disposition was found greater than 1.5 mm. Overall results of this work suggest that efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy applications could be compromised in case of very\n\nFeasibility study of using laser-generated neutron beam for BNCT.\n\nPubMed\n\nKasesaz, Y; Rahmani, F; Khalafi, H\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe feasibility of using a laser-accelerated proton beam to produce a neutron source, via (p,n) reaction, for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) applications has been studied by MCNPX Monte Carlo code. After optimization of the target material and its thickness, a Beam Shaping Assembly (BSA) has been designed and optimized to provide appropriate neutron beam according to the recommended criteria by International Atomic Energy Agency. It was found that the considered laser-accelerated proton beam can provide epithermal neutron flux of â¼2Ã10(6) n/cm(2) shot. To achieve an appropriate epithermal neutron flux for BNCT treatment, the laser must operate at repetition rates of 1 kHz, which is rather ambitious at this moment.

W.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTo develop an automated radiotherapy treatment planning and optimization workflow to efficiently create patient specifically optimized clinical grade treatment plans for prostate cancer and to implement it in clinical practice. A two-phased planning and optimization workflow was developed to automatically generate 77Gy 5-field simultaneously integrated boost intensity modulated radiation therapy (SIB-IMRT) plans for prostate cancer treatment. A retrospective planning study (nââ=ââ100) was performed in which automatically and manually generated treatment plans were compared. A clinical pilot (nââ=ââ21) was performed to investigate the usability of our method. Operator time for the planning process was reduced toââ<5âmin. The retrospective planning study showed that 98 plans met all clinical constraints. Significant improvements were made in the volume receiving 72Gy (V72Gy) for the bladder and rectum and the mean dose of the bladder and the body. A reduced plan variance was observed. During the clinical pilot 20 automatically generated plans met all constraints and 17 plans were selected for treatment. The automated radiotherapy treatment planning and optimization workflow is capable of efficiently generating patient specifically optimized and improved clinical grade plans. It has now been adopted as the current standard workflow in our clinic to generate treatment plans for prostate cancer.\n\n[Optimization of radiotherapy planning for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using 18FDG-PET].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmidt, S; Nestle, U; Walter, K; Licht, N; Ukena, D; Schnabel, K; Kirsch, C M\n\n2002-10-01\n\nIn recent years, FDG-PET examinations have become more important for problems in oncology, especially in staging of bronchogenic carcinoma. In the retrospective study presented here, the influence of PET on the planning of radiotherapy for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was investigated. The study involved 39 patients with NSCLC who had been examined by PET for staging. They received radiotherapy on the basis of the anterior/posterior portals including the primary tumour and the mediastinum planned according to CT- and bronchoscopic findings. The results of the PET examination were not considered in initial radiotherapy planning. The portals were retrospectively redefined on the basis of FDG uptake considering the size and localization of the primary tumour; and FDG activities outside the mediastinal part of the portals. In 15 out of 39 patients, the CT/PET-planned portals differed from the CT-planned ones. In most causes (n = 12) the CT/PET field was smaller than the CT field. The median geometric field size of the portals was 179 cm2, after redefinition using PET 166 cm2. In 20 patients with disturbed ventilation caused by the tumour (atelectasis, dystelectosis), a correction of the portal was suggested significantly more frequently than in the other patients (p = 0.03). Our results demonstrate the synergism of topographical (CT) and metabolic (FDG-PET) information, which could be helpful in planning radiotherapy of bronchial carcinoma, especially for patients with disturbed ventilation.\n\nDosimetry audit simulation of treatment planning system in multicenters radiotherapy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKasmuri, S.; Pawiro, S.

This study used CIRS phantom 002LFC representing the human thorax and simulated all external beam radiotherapy stages. The phantom was scanned using CT Scanner and planned 8 test cases that were similar to those in clinical practice situation were made, tested in four radiotherapy centers.

Precise information on the extension of prostate cancer is crucial for the choice of an appropriate therapeutic strategy. (11)C-choline positron emission tomography ((11)C-choline PET/CT) has two roles in radiation oncology (RT): (1) patient selection for treatment and (2) target volume selection and delineation. In conjunction with high-accuracy techniques, it might offer an opportunity of dose escalation and better tumour control while sparing healthy tissues. We carried out a retrospective study in order to analyse RT planning modification based on (11)C-choline PET/CT in 16 prostate cancer patients. Patients were treated with hypofractionated step-and-shoot Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), or Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), and a daily cone-beam CT for Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT). All patients underwent a (11)C-choline-PET/CT scan prior to radiotherapy. In 37.5% of cases, a re-delineation and new dose prescription occurred. Data show good preliminary clinical results in terms of biochemical control and toxicity. No gastrointestinal (GI)/genitourinary (GU) grade III toxicities were observed after a median follow-up of 9.5 months. In our experience, concerning the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa), (11)C-choline PET/CT may be helpful in radiotherapy planning, either for dose escalation or exclusion of selected sites.\n\nMethods and computer readable medium for improved radiotherapy dosimetry planning\n\nDOEpatents\n\nWessol, Daniel E.; Frandsen, Michael W.; Wheeler, Floyd J.; Nigg, David W.\n\n2005-11-15\n\nMethods and computer readable media are disclosed for ultimately developing a dosimetry plan for a treatment volume irradiated during radiation therapy with a radiation source concentrated internally within a patient or incident from an external beam. The dosimetry plan is available in near \"real-time\" because of the novel geometric model construction of the treatment volume which in turn allows for rapid calculations to be performed for simulated movements of particles along particle tracks therethrough. The particles are exemplary representations of alpha, beta or gamma emissions emanating from an internal radiation source during various radiotherapies, such as brachytherapy or targeted radionuclide therapy, or they are exemplary representations of high-energy photons, electrons, protons or other ionizing particles incident on the treatment volume from an external source. In a preferred embodiment, a medical image of a treatment volume irradiated during radiotherapy having a plurality of pixels of information is obtained.\n\nPhysics of epi-thermal boron neutron capture therapy (epi-thermal BNCT).\n\nPubMed\n\nSeki, Ryoichi; Wakisaka, Yushi; Morimoto, Nami; Takashina, Masaaki; Koizumi, Masahiko; Toki, Hiroshi; Fukuda, Mitsuhiro\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe physics of epi-thermal neutrons in the human body is discussed in the effort to clarify the nature of the unique radiologic properties of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).

Nonetheless, the anti-tumor effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) was recently demonstrated in two patients with MPNST. Subsequently, tumor-bearing nude mice subcutaneously transplanted with a human MPNST cell line were injected with p-borono-L-phenylalanine (L-BPA) and subjected to BNCT.

Thus there is a vested interest in the various physical and radiobiological processes governing the interaction of ion beams with matter, specifically living systems. We discuss the various modelling steps which lead from basic interactions to the application in actual patient treatment planning. The nano- and microscopic scale is covered by sample calculations with our TRAX code. On the macroscopic scale we feature the TRiP98 treatment planning system, which was clinically used in GSI's radiotherapy pilot project.\n\nAutomated radiotherapy treatment plan integrity verification\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nYang Deshan; Moore, Kevin L.\n\n2012-03-15\n\nPurpose: In our clinic, physicists spend from 15 to 60 min to verify the physical and dosimetric integrity of radiotherapy plans before presentation to radiation oncology physicians for approval. The purpose of this study was to design and implement a framework to automate as many elements of this quality control (QC) step as possible. Methods: A comprehensive computer application was developed to carry out a majority of these verification tasks in the Philips PINNACLE treatment planning system (TPS). This QC tool functions based on both PINNACLE scripting elements and PERL sub-routines. The core of this technique is the method ofmoreÂ Â» dynamic scripting, which involves a PERL programming module that is flexible and powerful for treatment plan data handling. Run-time plan data are collected, saved into temporary files, and analyzed against standard values and predefined logical rules. The results were summarized in a hypertext markup language (HTML) report that is displayed to the user. Results: This tool has been in clinical use for over a year. The occurrence frequency of technical problems, which would cause delays and suboptimal plans, has been reduced since clinical implementation. Conclusions: In addition to drastically reducing the set of human-driven logical comparisons, this QC tool also accomplished some tasks that are otherwise either quite laborious or impractical for humans to verify, e.g., identifying conflicts amongst IMRT optimization objectives.Â«Â less\n\nExploring Boron Neutron Capture Therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarÃ­as, RubÃ©n O; Bortolussi, Silva; MenÃ©ndez, Pablo R; GonzÃ¡lez, Sara J\n\n2014-12-01\n\nBoron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a radiotherapy that combines biological targeting and high LET radiation.
