        "text": "Chemotherapeutic potential of quercetin on human bladder cancer cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrÅ¡oliÄ, Nada; KaraÄ, Ivo; Sirovina, Damir; Kukolj, Marina; KunÅ¡tiÄ, Martina; Gajski, Goran; Garaj-Vrhovac, Vera; Å tajcar, Damir\n\n2016-07-28\n\nIn an effort to improve local bladder cancer control, we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of quercetin on human bladder cancer T24 cells. The cytotoxic effect of quercetin against T24 cells was examined by MTT test, clonogenic assay as well as DNA damaging effect by comet assay. In addition, the cytotoxic effect of quercetin on the primary culture of papillary urothelial carcinoma (PUC), histopathological stage T1 of low- or high-grade tumours, was investigated. Our analysis demonstrated a high correlation between reduced number of colony and cell viability and an increase in DNA damage of T24 cells incubated with quercetin at doses of 1 and 50 ÂµM during short term incubation (2Â h). At all exposure times (24, 48 and 72Â h), the efficacy of quercetin, administered at a 10Ã higher dose compared to T24 cells, was statistically significant (P < 0.05) for the primary culture of PUC. In conclusion, our study suggests that quercetin could inhibit cell proliferation and colony formation of human bladder cancer cells by inducing DNA damage and that quercetin may be an effective chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent for papillary urothelial bladder cancer after transurethral resection.\n\nQuercetin Reduces Ehrlich Tumor-Induced Cancer Pain in Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCalixto-Campos, Cassia; CorrÃªa, Mab P.; Carvalho, Thacyana T.; Zarpelon, Ana C.; Hohmann, Miriam S. N.; Rossaneis, Ana C.; Coelho-Silva, Leticia; Pavanelli, Wander R.; Pinge-Filho, Phileno; Bernardy, Catia C. F.; Verri, Waldiceu A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCancer pain directly affects the patient's quality of life. We have previously demonstrated that the subcutaneous administration of the mammary adenocarcinoma known as Ehrlich tumor induces pain in mice. Several studies have shown that the flavonoid quercetin presents important biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, and antitumor activity. Therefore, the analgesic effect and mechanisms of quercetin were evaluated in Ehrlich tumor-induced cancer pain in mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatments with quercetin reduced Ehrlich tumor-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, but not paw thickness or histological alterations, indicating an analgesic effect without affecting tumor growth. Regarding the analgesic mechanisms of quercetin, it inhibited the production of hyperalgesic cytokines IL-1Î² and TNFÎ± and decreased neutrophil recruitment (myeloperoxidase activity) and oxidative stress. Naloxone (opioid receptor antagonist) inhibited quercetin analgesia without interfering with neutrophil recruitment, cytokine production, and oxidative stress. Importantly, cotreatment with morphine and quercetin at doses that were ineffective as single treatment reduced the nociceptive responses. Concluding, quercetin reduces the Ehrlich tumor-induced cancer pain by reducing the production of hyperalgesic cytokines, neutrophil recruitment, and oxidative stress as well as by activating an opioid-dependent analgesic pathway and potentiation of morphine analgesia. Thus, quercetin treatment seems a suitable therapeutic approach for cancer pain that merits further investigation.

In this study, we investigated the role of quercetin on the antitumor effects of DOX on liver cancer cells and its ability to provide protection against DOX-mediated liver damage in mice. Methodology and Results The MTT and Annexin V/PI staining assay demonstrated that quercetin selectively sensitized DOX-induced cytotoxicity against liver cancer cells while protecting normal liver cells. The increase in DOX-mediated apoptosis in hepatoma cells by quercetin was p53-dependent and occurred by downregulating Bcl-xl expression. Z-VAD-fmk (caspase inhibitor), pifithrin-Î± (p53 inhibitor), or overexpressed Bcl-xl decreased the effects of quercetin on DOX-mediated apoptosis. The combined treatment of quercetin and DOX significantly reduced the growth of liver cancer xenografts in mice. Moreover, quercetin decreased the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase that were increased in DOX-treated mice. Quercetin also reversed the DOX-induced pathological changes in mice livers. Conclusion and Significance These results indicate that quercetin potentiated the antitumor effects of DOX on liver cancer cells while protecting normal liver cells. Therefore, the development of quercetin may be beneficial in a combined treatment with DOX for increased therapeutic efficacy against liver cancer.

Quercetin (QU) is a hydrophobic agent with potential anticancer activity. In this work, we encapsulated QU into biodegradable monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) micelles and tried to provide proof-of-principle for treating ovarian cancer with this nano-formulation of quercetin. These QU loaded MPEG-PCL (QU/MPEG-PCL) micelles with drug loading of 6.9% had a mean particle size of 36 nm, rendering the complete dispersion of quercetin in water. QU inhibited the growth of A2780S ovarian cancer cells on a dose dependent manner in vitro. Intravenous administration of QU/MPEG-PCL micelles significantly suppressed the growth of established xenograft A2780S ovarian tumors through causing cancer cell apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, the anticancer activity of quercetin on ovarian cancer cells was studied in vitro. Quercetin treatment induced the apoptosis of A2780S cells associated with activating caspase-3 and caspase-9. MCL-1 downregulation, Bcl-2 downregulation, Bax upregulation and mitochondrial transmembrane potential change were observed, suggesting that quercetin may induce apoptosis of A2780S cells through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Otherwise, quercetin treatment decreased phosphorylated p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphorylated Akt, contributing to inhibition of A2780S cell proliferation. Our data suggested that QU/MPEG-PCL micelles were a novel nano-formulation of quercetin with a potential clinical application in ovarian cancer therapy.\n\nAssociation of Dietary Quercetin with Reduced Risk of Proximal Colon Cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDjuric, Zora; Severson, Richard K.; Kato, Ikuko\n\n2012-01-01\n\nQuercetin is a flavonol that appears to be protective against several cancers, but its possible role in prevention of colorectal cancer is not yet well studied. We evaluated dietary intakes of quercetin and risk of colorectal cancer in a large case-control study conducted in Metropolitan Detroit, MI (n = 2664). The protective effects of quercetin intake, as assessed by food frequency questionnaire, were confined to risk of proximal colon cancer. Stratified analyses showed that the protective effects of quercetin on risk of proximal colon cancer were significant only when fruit intake or the Healthy Eating Index score were high, or when tea intake was low, with odds ratios (OR) for the highest versus the lowest quartile = 0.49, 0.44, and 0.51, respectively. Increased quercetin intake had no protective effects when tea intake was high. Interestingly, increased intake of quercetin was associated with increased risk of distal colon cancer when total fruit intake was low (OR for the highest versus the lowest quartile = 1.99). These results suggest that quercetin can have disparate effects on colon cancer risk depending on whether dietary intakes of fruit or tea are high, and that quercetin had protective effects only on proximal, not distal, colon cancer.

Current treatments offered in the clinics are often toxic and have severe side effects. Hence, to treat and manage PCa, new agents with fewer side effects or having potential to reduce side effects of conventional therapy are needed. In this study, we show anti-cancer effects of quercetin, an abundant bioflavonoid commonly used to treat prostatitis, and defined quercetin-induced cellular and molecular changes leading to PCa cell death. Cell viability was assessed using MTT. Cell death mode, mitochondrial outer membrane potential, and oxidative stress levels were determined by flow cytometry using Annexin V-7 AAD dual staining kit, JC-1 dye, and ROS detection kit, respectively. Antibody microarray and western blot were used to delineate the molecular changes induced by quercetin. PCa cells treated with various concentrations of quercetin showed time- and dose-dependent decrease in cell viability compared to controls, without affecting normal prostate epithelial cells. Quercetin led to apoptotic and necrotic cell death in PCa cells by affecting the mitochondrial integrity and disturbing the ROS homeostasis depending upon the genetic makeup and oxidative status of the cells. LNCaP and PC-3 cells that have an oxidative cellular environment showed ROS quenching after quercetin treatment while DU-145 showed rise in ROS levels despite having a highly reductive environment. Opposing effects of quercetin were also observed on the pro-survival pathways of PCa cells. PCa cells with mutated p53 (DU-145) and increased ROS showed significant reduction in the activation of pro-survival Akt pathway while Raf/MEK were activated in response to quercetin. PC-3 cells lacking p53 and PTEN with reduced ROS levels showed significant activation of Akt and NF-ÎºB pathway. Although some of these changes are commonly associated with oncogenic response, the\n\nArctigenin in combination with quercetin synergistically enhances the anti-proliferative effect in prostate cancer cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Piwen; Phan, Tien; Gordon, David; Chung, Seyung; Henning, Susanne M.; Vadgama, Jaydutt V.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nScope We investigated whether a combination of two promising chemopreventive agents arctigenin and quercetin increases the anti-carcinogenic potency at lower concentrations than necessary when used individually in prostate cancer. Methods and results Androgen-dependent LAPC-4 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with low doses of arctigenin and quercetin alone or in combination for 48h. The anti-proliferative activity of arctigenin was 10-20 fold stronger than quercetin in both cell lines. Their combination synergistically enhanced the anti-proliferative effect, with a stronger effect in androgen receptor (AR) wild-type LAPC-4 cells than in AR mutated LNCaP cells. Arctigenin demonstrated a strong ability to inhibit AR protein expression in LAPC-4 cells. The combination treatment significantly inhibited both AR and PI3K/Akt pathways compared to control. A protein array analysis revealed that the mixture targets multiple pathways particularly in LAPC-4 cells including Stat3 pathway. The mixture significantly inhibited the expression of several oncogenic microRNAs including miR-21, miR-19b, and miR-148a compared to control. The mixture also enhanced the inhibition of cell migration in both cell lines compared to individual compounds tested. Conclusion The combination of arctigenin and quercetin, that target similar pathways, at low physiological doses, provides a novel regimen with enhanced chemoprevention in prostate cancer.

In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative effect of quercetin in two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), which differed in hormone receptor. IC50 value (37Î¼M) of quercetin showed significant cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells, which was not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells even at 100Î¼M of quercetin treatment. To study the response of cancer cells to quercetin, with respect to different hormone receptors, both the cell lines were treated with a fixed concentration (40Î¼M) of quercetin. MCF-7 cells on quercetin treatment showed more apoptotic cells with G1 phase arrest. In addition, quercetin effectively suppressed the expression of CyclinD1, p21, Twist and phospho p38MAPK, which was not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. To analyse the molecular mechanism of quercetin in exerting an apoptotic effect in MCF-7 cells, Twist was over-expressed and the molecular changes were observed after quercetin administration. Quercetin effectively regulated the expression of Twist, in turn p16 and p21 which induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, quercetin induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through suppression of Twist via p38MAPK pathway.

We aimed to investigate the protective effects of quercetin according to different doses on hepatic and ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Fifty mature male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups (nâ¯=â¯10 for each). All the animal groups underwent laparotomy. Group 1 rats served as a sham-operated group. Groups 2-5 underwent 1â¯h hepatic ischemia and were followed by 2â¯h reperfusion. Group 3-5 animals received an additional intraperitoneal dose of 25, 50 or 100â¯mg/kg quercetin respectively before I/R operation. Blood samples were collected for determining serum aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Also, liver tissue samples were taken for measuring of liver MDA concentration and for histopathology assessment. The highest levels of biochemical parameters were observed in group 2. In quercetin-treated groups, serum AST, ALT, MDA levels, and tissue MDA concentration were decreased as inversely with increasing quercetin dose. Microscopic evaluation revealed that most conspicuous histological improvement was observed in 50â¯mg/kg quercetin co-treated rats. 25 and 100â¯mg/kg quercetin co-treatment could not protect completely against hepatic I/R injury. Quercetin can be effective in preventing of hepatic I/R injury when the correct dose was used. Copyright Â© 2018.

Quercetin, a natural flavonol present in many commonly consumed food items, is widely demonstrated to exert inhibitory effects on cancer progression through various mechanisms. Since there is a strong association with diets containing abundant vegetables, fruits, and grains, and significant decline in the risk of colon cancer, accumulation studies have focused on the anticancer potential of quercetin in colorectal cancer. Cell cycle arrest, increase in apoptosis, antioxidant replication, modulation of estrogen receptors, regulation of signaling pathways, inhibition of and metastasis and angiogenesis are among various mechanisms underlying the chemo-preventive effects of quercetin in colorectal cancer. This review covers various therapeutic interactions of Quercetin as to how targets cellular involved in cancer treatment.

However, quercetin has extremely low water solubility, which is a major challenge in drug absorption. In this study, we described a simple method for the synthesis of quercetin nanoparticles. The quercetin nanoparticles had an average diameter of 82â¯nm and prominent yellow emission under UV irradiation. Therefore, we used an inÂ vitro model treated with quercetin and quercetin nanoparticles to investigate the effects of quercetin nanoparticles on MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. MCF-7â¯cells were cultured with different concentrations (1-100â¯Î¼M) of quercetin nanoparticles at the 24th, 48th and 72â¯ndâ¯hours, and cell cycle and apoptosis assays were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). In this study, we found that quercetin nanoparticles (1-100â¯Î¼M) could significantly reduce cell vitality, growth rate and colony formation of MCF-7â¯cells. Quercetin nanoparticles can inhibit cell growth by blocking the cell cycle and promoting apoptosis in MCF-7â¯cells more than quercetin. As a result, quercetin nanoparticles may be useful therapy or prevention on breast cancer. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Certain flavonoids, in particular quercetin, have been shown to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction and reduce blood pressure (BP), possibly by increasing the bioavailability of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Several studies have indicated that improvements in measures of cardiovascular health do not occur linearly, but rather, plateau or decrease with an increasing dose of flavonoids. We determined whether the acute administration of increasing doses of a common quercetin glycoside (quercetin-3-O-glucoside) improves endothelial function and reduces BP in a dose-dependent manner. We also explored whether any effects were correlated with changes in plasma NO production. A randomized, controlled, crossover study was performed in 15 healthy volunteers who each completed 5 visits with a minimum washout period of 1 wk between testing days. Participants received each of the following 5 interventions in a random order: 1) 0, 2) 50, 3) 100, 4) 200, or 5) 400 mg quercetin-3-O-glucoside. Endothelial function and BP were assessed before and 60 min after intervention. A blood sample was taken before and 90 min after intervention for the analysis of plasma nitrate and nitrite as markers of NO production as well as of plasma quercetin metabolites. Although we observed a significant correlation between the dose of quercetin-3-O-glucoside and plasma concentrations of total quercetin (R(2) = 0.52, P < 0.001) and isorhamnetin (R(2) = 0.12, P = 0.005), we showed no improvements in endothelial function or BP and no changes in NO production after any dose. From these results, we conclude that there are no acute changes in BP or the NO-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation of the brachial artery with doses of quercetin ranging from 50 to 400 mg in healthy men and women. This trial was registered at www.anzctr.org.au as ACTRN12615001338550.

Thus, it becomes imperative to find new therapeutic targets as well as new molecules with therapeutic potential for tumors. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that may be potential therapeutic agents. Several studies have shown that these compounds have a higher anticancer potential. Among the flavonoids in the human diet, quercetin is one of the most important. In the last decades, several anticancer properties of quercetin have been described, such as cell signaling, pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative and anti-oxidant effects, growth suppression. In fact, it is now well known that quercetin has diverse biological effects, inhibiting multiple enzymes involved in cell proliferation, as well as, in signal transduction pathways. On the other hand, there are also studies reporting potential synergistic effects when combined quercetin with chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy. In fact, several studies which aim to explore the anticancer potential of these combined treatments have already been published, the majority with promising results. Actually it is well known that quercetin can act on the chemosensitization and radiosensitization but also as chemoprotective and radioprotective, protecting normal cells of the side effects that results from chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which obviously provides notable advantages in their use in anticancer treatment. Thus, all these data indicate that quercetin may have a key role in anticancer treatment. In this context, this review is focused on the relationship between flavonoids and cancer, with special emphasis on the role of quercetin.\n\nQuercetin induced apoptosis of human oral cancer SAS cells through mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum mediated signaling pathways.\n\nPubMed\n\nMa, Yi-Shih; Yao, Chien-Ning; Liu, Hsin-Chung; Yu, Fu-Shun; Lin, Jen-Jyh; Lu, Kung-Wen; Liao, Ching-Lung; Chueh, Fu-Shin; Chung, Jing-Gung\n\n2018-06-01\n\nOral cancer is a cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide and the treatment of oral cancer includes radiation, surgery and chemotherapy. Quercetin is a component from natural plant products and it has been demonstrated that quercetin is able to induce cytotoxic effects through induction of cell apoptosis in a number of human cancer cell lines. However, there is no available information to demonstrate that quercetin is able to induce apoptosis in human oral cancer cells. In the present study, the effect of quercetin on the cell death via the induction of apoptosis in human oral cancer SAS cells was investigated using flow cytometry, Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, western blotting and confocal laser microscopy examination, to test for cytotoxic effects at 6-48 h after treatment with quercetin. The rate of cell death increased with the duration of quercetin treatment based on the results of a cell viability assay, increased Annexin V/PI staining, increased reactive oxygen species and Ca 2+ production, decreased the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨ m ), increased proportion of apoptotic cells and altered levels of apoptosis-associated protein expression in SAS cells. The results from western blotting revealed that quercetin increased Fas, Fas-Ligand, fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase-8, all of which associated with cell surface death receptor. Furthermore, quercetin increased the levels of activating transcription factor (ATF)-6Î±, ATF-6Î² and gastrin-releasing peptide-78 which indicated an increase in endoplasm reticulum stress, increased levels of the pro-apoptotic protein BH3 interacting-domain death antagonist, and decreased levels of anti-apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma (Bcl) 2 and Bcl-extra large which may have led to the decreases of ÎÎ¨ m . Additionally, confocal microscopy suggested that quercetin was able to increase the expression levels of cytochrome c , apoptosis-inducing factor and\n\nPerorally active nanomicellar formulation of quercetin in the treatment of lung cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTan, Bee-Jen; Liu, Yuanjie; Chang, Kai-Lun; Lim, Bennie KW; Chiu, Gigi NC\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Realizing the therapeutic benefits of quercetin is mostly hampered by its low water solubility and poor absorption. In light of the advantages of nanovehicles in the delivery of flavanoids, we aimed to deliver quercetin perorally with nanomicelles made from the diblock copolymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Methods Quercetin-loaded nanomicelles were prepared by using the film casting method, and were evaluated in terms of drug incorporation efficiency, micelle size, interaction with Caco-2 cells, and anticancer activity in the A549 lung cancer cell line and murine xenograft model. Results The incorporation efficiency into the nanomicelles was â¥88.9% when the content of quercetin was up to 4% w/w, with sizes of 15.4â18.5 nm and polydispersity indices of <0.250. Solubilization of quercetin by the nanomicelles increased its aqueous concentration by 110-fold. The quercetin nanomicelles were stable when tested in simulated gastric (pH 1.2) and intestinal (pH 7.4) fluids, and were non-toxic to the Caco-2 cells as reflected by reversible reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance and â¤25% lactose dehydrogenase release. The anticancer activity of quercetin could be significantly improved over the free drug through the nanomicellar formulation when tested using the A549 cancer cell line and murine xenograft model. The nanomicellar quercetin formulation was well tolerated by the tumor-bearing animals, with no significant weight loss observed at the end of the 10-week study period. Conclusion A stable PEG-PE nanomicellar formulation of quercetin was developed with enhanced peroral anticancer activity and no apparent toxicity to the intestinal epithelium.

However, quercetin suffers from poor metabolic stability, which appears to offset its pharmacological efficacy. Recently, we isolated quercetin-6-C-Î²-D-glucopyranoside (QCG) from Ulmus wallichiana planchon that has greater stability profile over quercetin. In the present study, the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of QCG on prostate cancer cells were assessed. QCG inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation by arresting cells at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and induces apoptosis as evident from cytochrome c release, cleavage of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Mechanistic studies revealed that QCG inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and Akt/mTOR cell survival pathways. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was a critical mediator of QCG action as knockdown of AhR attenuated QCG-induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and inhibition of Akt/mTOR pathway in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that QCG exhibits anti-cancer activity against prostate cancer cells via AhR-mediated down regulation of Akt/mTOR pathway in PC-3 cells.

The antioxidant activity of quercetin and its protective effects against cardiovascular disorders, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities have been extensively documented; however, the clinical request of quercetin in cancer treatment is significantly limited due to its very poor delivery features. In order to increase the hydrophilicity and drug delivery capability, we encapsulated quercetin into liposomes. Our data indicated that liposomal quercetin can significantly improve the solubility and bioavailability of quercetin and can be used as an effective antioxidant for ROS protection within the polar cytoplasm, and the nano-sized quercetin encapsulated by liposomes enhanced the cellular uptake (cancer cell human MCF_7). Quercetin has many pharmaceutical applications, many of which arise from its potent antioxidant properties. The present research examined the antioxidant activities of quercetin in polar solvents by a comparative study using reduction of ferric iron in aqueous medium, intracellular ROS/toxicity assays, and reducing DPPH assays. Cell viability and ROS assays demonstrated that quercetin was able to penetrate into the polar medium inside the cells and to protect them against the highly toxic and deadly belongings of cumene hydroperoxide. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a liposomal formulation of quercetin can suggestively improve its solubility and bioavailability and can be a possible request in the treatment of tumor. The authors encapsulated quercetin in a liposomal delivery system. They studied the in vitro effects of this compound on proliferation using human MCF-7 carcinoma cells. The activity of liposomal quercetin was equal to or better than that of free quercetin at equimolar concentrations. Our data indicated that liposomal quercetin can significantly improve the\n\nA Comprehensive Review on Pharmacotherapeutics of Three Phytochemicals, Curcumin, Quercetin, and Allicin, in the Treatment of Gastric Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaghi, Atousa; Azimi, Haniye; Rahimi, Roja\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGastric cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Medicinal plants are one of the main sources for discovery of new pharmacological agents especially for treatment of cancers. The aim of the present study is to review pharmacotherapeutic aspects of three mostly studied phytochemicals including curcumin, quercetin, and allicin for management of gastric cancer. Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for the effects of curcumin, quercetin, allicin, and their analogs in gastric cancer. Data were collected up to November 2015. The search terms were \"curcumin,\" \"quercetin,\" \"allicin,\" and \"gastric cancer\" or \"cancer.\" Curcumin demonstrated anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, pro-apoptotic, and anti-helicobacter activities. Quercetin inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy as well as anti-Helicobacter activity. Allicin showed apoptotic and anti-Helicobacter properties. All three natural compounds had low bioavailability. Although preclinical studies demonstrated the activity of curcumin, quercetin, and allicin in gastric cancer, clinical trials are needed to confirm their effectiveness. Applying their possible synergistic action and suitable drug delivery system in clinical studies can be also an attractive approach with the purpose of finding new extremely efficient anti-gastric cancer agents. Curcumin, quercetin, and allicin seem to be good candidates for management of gastric cancer through their pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, and anti-helicobacter activities.\n\nQuercetin suppresses insulin receptor signaling through inhibition of the insulin ligandâreceptor binding and therefore impairs cancer cell proliferation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWang, Feng; Department of Nanomedicine, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030; Yang, Yong, E-mail: yyang@houstonmethodist.org\n\nGraphical abstract: - Highlights: â¢ Quercetin inhibits insulin ligandâreceptor interactions. â¢ Quercetin reduces downstream insulin receptor signaling. â¢ Quercetin blocks insulin induced glucose uptake. â¢ Quercetin suppresses insulin stimulated cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. - Abstract: Although the flavonoid quercetin is known to inhibit activation of insulin receptor signaling, the inhibitory mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that quercetin suppresses insulin induced dimerization of the insulin receptor (IR) through interfering with ligandâreceptor interactions, which reduces the phosphorylation of IR and Akt. This inhibitory effect further inhibits insulin stimulated glucose uptake due to decreased cell membrane translocationmoreÂ Â» of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), resulting in impaired cancer cell proliferation. The effect of quercetin in inhibiting tumor growth was also evident in an in vivo model, indicating a potential future application for quercetin in the treatment of cancers.Â«Â less\n\nQuercetin, a Natural Flavonoid Interacts with DNA, Arrests Cell Cycle and Causes Tumor Regression by Activating Mitochondrial Pathway of Apoptosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSrivastava, Shikha; Somasagara, Ranganatha R.; Hegde, Mahesh; Nishana, Mayilaadumveettil; Tadi, Satish Kumar; Srivastava, Mrinal; Choudhary, Bibha; Raghavan, Sathees C.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nNaturally occurring compounds are considered as attractive candidates for cancer treatment and prevention. Quercetin and ellagic acid are naturally occurring flavonoids abundantly seen in several fruits and vegetables. In the present study, we evaluate and compare antitumor efficacies of quercetin and ellagic acid in animal models and cancer cell lines in a comprehensive manner. We found that quercetin induced cytotoxicity in leukemic cells in a dose-dependent manner, while ellagic acid showed only limited toxicity. Besides leukemic cells, quercetin also induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells, however, its effect on normal cells was limited or none. Further, quercetin caused S phase arrest during cell cycle progression in tested cancer cells. Quercetin induced tumor regression in mice at a concentration 3-fold lower than ellagic acid. Importantly, administration of quercetin lead to ~5 fold increase in the life span in tumor bearing mice compared to that of untreated controls. Further, we found that quercetin interacts with DNA directly, and could be one of the mechanisms for inducing apoptosis in both, cancer cell lines and tumor tissues by activating the intrinsic pathway. Thus, our data suggests that quercetin can be further explored for its potential to be used in cancer therapeutics and combination therapy.

Quercetin is a major dietary flavonoid consumed with a diet rich in onions, tea, and apples. We used HT-29 human colon cancer cells and investigated the effects of quercetin on proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation as processes shown to be disregulated during cancer development. To identify the cellular targets of quercetin action, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed and proteins altered in expression level after quercetin exposure of cells were identified by mass spectrometry of peptide fragments generated by tryptic digestion. Quercetin inhibited the proliferation of HT-29 cells with an IC(50)-value of 81.2 +/- 6.6 microM. Cell differentiation based on surface expression of alkaline phosphatase was enhanced 4-fold and the activity of the pro-apoptotic effector caspase-3 increased 3-fold. Those effects were associated with the regulation of heat-shock proteins and annexins shown to both play a crucial role in the process of apoptosis. Cytoskeletal caspase substrates were found as regulated as well and various proteins involved in intermediary metabolism and in gene regulation showed altered steady-state expression levels upon quercetin treatment of cells. In conclusion, quercetin alters the levels of a variety of proteins involved in growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of colon cancer cells. Their identification as molecular targets of quercetin may explain the anti-cancer activities of this flavonoid.\n\nQuercetin and Cancer Chemoprevention\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGibellini, Lara; Pinti, Marcello; Nasi, Milena; Montagna, Jonas P.; De Biasi, Sara; Roat, Erika; Bertoncelli, Linda; Cooper, Edwin L.; Cossarizza, Andrea\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSeveral molecules present in the diet, including flavonoids, can inhibit the growth of cancer cells with an ability to act as âchemopreventersâ. Their cancer-preventive effects have been attributed to various mechanisms, including the induction of cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis as well as the antioxidant functions. The antioxidant activity of chemopreventers has recently received a great interest, essentially because oxidative stress participates in the initiation and progression of different pathological conditions, including cancer. Since antioxidants are capable of preventing oxidative damage, the wide use of natural food-derived antioxidants is receiving greater attention as potential anti-carcinogens. Among flavonoids, quercetin (Qu) is considered an excellent free-radical scavenging antioxidant, even if such an activity strongly depends on the intracellular availability of reduced glutathione. Apart from antioxidant activity, Qu also exerts a direct, pro-apoptotic effect in tumor cells, and can indeed block the growth of several human cancer cell lines at different phases of the cell cycle. Both these effects have been documented in a wide variety of cellular models as well as in animal models. The high toxicity exerted by Qu on cancer cells perfectly matches with the almost total absence of any damages for normal, non-transformed cells. In this review we discuss the molecular mechanisms that are based on the biological effects of Qu, and their relevance for human health.

Thus, more effective therapeutic strategies are required. Quercetin (QCT) is a natural flavonoid compound that has attracted increasing interest due to its anticancer activity. However, the clinical application of quercetin is largely hampered by its poor water solubility and low bioavailability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of novel QCT-loaded nanomicelles (M-QCTs) assembled from DSPE-PEG2000 for prostate cancer treatment. Our results indicated that QCT was efficiently encapsulated into micelles up to 1 mg mL-1, which corresponds to a 450-fold increase of its water solubility. In vitro studies showed that the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value (20.2 Î¼M) of M-QCTs was much lower than free QCT (>200 Î¼M). Thus, M-QCTs were considerably more effective than free QCT in proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction of human androgen-independent PC-3 cells. Furthermore, M-QCTs showed superior antitumor efficacy and the tumor proliferation rate reduced by 52.03% compared to the control group in the PC-3 xenograft mouse model, possibly due to increased accumulation of M-QCTs at the tumor site by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Collectively, our studies demonstrated that M-QCTs significantly increase drug accumulation at the tumor site and exhibit superior anticancer activity in prostate cancer. Thus, our nanomicelle-based drug delivery system constitutes a promising and effective therapeutic strategy for clinical treatment. Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: XRD and 1H NMR analysis of quercetin-loaded DSPE-PEG2000 micelles (M-QCTs); in vitro cytotoxicity of increasing concentrations of empty micelles (EMs) against PC-3 cells; hemolysis assay of empty micelles (EMs); representative images of H&E staining of various organs from mice with PC-3 cell xenografts after treatment with QCT or M-QCTs at a quercetin-equivalent dose of 30 mg kg-1 and the serum\n\nMetformin combined with quercetin synergistically repressed prostate cancer cells via inhibition of VEGF/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Shuben; Gong, Fanger; Liu, Ping; Miao, Qilong\n\n2018-04-17\n\nThe aim of present study was to examine whether metformin in association with quercetin has any synergistically anti-tumor effects on prostate cancer. Our findings showed that metformin in combination with quercetin synergistically inhibited the growth, migration and invasion of both PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Co-treatment of these two agents induced more apoptosis than single agent treatment. The co-treatment-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent and accompanied by the down-regulation of Bcl-2 family members. Our data also indicated that co-treatment of metformin and quercetin strongly inhibited the VEGF/Akt/PI3K pathway. Moreover, these two agents acted synergistically to repress the growth of human prostate cancer cell xenograft in vivo in nude mice. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the combination therapy of metformin and quercetin exerted synergistic antitumor effects in prostate cancers via inhibition of VEGF/Akt/PI3K pathway. Thus, combination treatment of metformin and quercetin would be a promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer patients. Copyright Â© 2017.

In this study, we examined the effects of quercetin on cell cycle, viability and proliferation of cancer cells, either singly or in combination with the microtubule-targeting drugs taxol and nocodazole. Although quercetin induced cell death in a dose dependent manner, 12.5-50Î¼M quercetin inhibited the activity of both taxol and nocodazole to induce G2/M arrest in various cell lines. Quercetin also partially restored drug-induced loss in viability of treated cells for up to 72 hours. This antagonism of microtubule-targeting drugs was accompanied by a delay in cell cycle progression and inhibition of the buildup of cyclin-B1 at the microtubule organizing center of treated cells. However, quercetin did not inhibit the microtubule targeting of taxol or nocodazole. Despite the short-term protection of cells by quercetin, colony formation and clonogenicity of HCT116 cells were still suppressed by quercetin or quercetin-taxol combination. The status of cell adherence to growth matrix was critical in determining the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to quercetin. We conclude that while long-term exposure of cancer cells to quercetin may prevent cell proliferation and survival, the interference of quercetin with cell cycle progression diminishes the efficacy of microtubule-targeting drugs to arrest cells at G2/M.

Our study deals with chemotherapeutic effects of vanadium, when coordinated with the flavonoid quercetin on a defined model of chemically induced rat mammary carcinogenesis in vivo and on human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in vitro. The characterization of the complex was achieved through UV-Visible, IR, and Mass spectra and antioxidant activity was assessed by DPPH, FRAP and ABTS methods. In vitro studies established that the complex upregulated the expressions of p53, Caspase 3 and 9, whereas down regulating Akt, mTOR and VEGF expressions and also induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in a dose dependent manner. Acute and Sub-acute toxicity was performed to determine safe doses. 7,12-Dimethylbenz(Î±)anthracene (0.5Â mg/100Â g body weight) was used for induction of breast cancer in female Sprague-Dawley rats via single tail vein injection. The histopathological analysis after 24Â weeks of carcinogenesis study depicted substantial repair of hyperplastic lesions. TUNEL assay showed an increase in apoptotic index (0.14âÂ±â0.03; 0.15âÂ±â0.01) in vanadium-quercetin treated groups as compared to the carcinogen control (0.02âÂ±â0.01) along with upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax and p53. Immunohistochemical analysis also exhibited decrease in cell proliferation in the vanadium-quercetin treated groups (11.3âÂ±â0.12; 11.8âÂ±â0.10). Thus, results from both in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that vanadium-quercetin complex could be a potential candidate for development of approved drug for breast cancer in the near future.\n\nQuercetin suppresses HeLa cells by blocking PI3K/Akt pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiang, Tao; Fang, Yong; Wang, Shi-Xuan\n\n2014-10-01\n\nTo explore the effect of quercetin on the proliferation and apoptosis of HeLa cells, HeLa cells were incubated with quercetin at different concentrations. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay, cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin-V/PI double labeled cytometry and DNA ladder assay. Cell cycle was flow cytometrically determined and the morphological changes of the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope after Hoechst 33258 staining and the apoptosis-related proteins in the HeLa cells were assessed by Western blotting. The results showed that quercetin significantly inhibited the growth of HeLa cells and induced obvious apoptosis in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, quercetin induced apoptosis of HeLa cells in cell cycle-dependent manner because quercetin could induce arrest of HeLa cells at G0/G1 phase. Quercetin treatment down-regulated the expression of the PI3K and p-Akt. In addition, quercetin could down-regulate expression of bcl-2, up-regulate Bax, but exerted no effect on the overall expression of Akt. We are led to conclude that quercetin induces apoptosis via PI3k/Akt pathways, and quercetin has potential to be used as an anti-tumor agent against human cervix cancer.\n\nCombination of quercetin and tannic acid in inhibiting 26S proteasome affects S5a and 20S expression, and accumulation of ubiquitin resulted in apoptosis in cancer chemoprevention.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Tsui-Ling; Wang, Chi-Hsien\n\n2013-04-01\n\nTo look for oral proteasome inhibitors, daily injested food is the best source for cancer chemoprevention. A combination of active components from vegetables, coffee, tea, and fruit could be more efficient to inhibit 26S proteasome activities for preventing cancer diseases. Tannic acid and quercetin have been shown to strongly inhibit 26S proteasome activity, but the molecular target involved remains unknown. Overlay assay, peptide assay, Western blot, and 2-D gels were used to assess the combination of quercetin and tannic acid as a potential inhibitor. Here, we demonstrated that the combination of quercetin and tannic acid (1) synergistically suppresses chymotrypsin-, caspase-, and trypsin-like proteolytic activities, (2) are tightly binding substrates, (3) do not perturb the proteasome structure, (4) inhibit the 26S proteasome affected by ubiquitin, ATP, or Î²-casein, and (5) inhibit Î²-casein degradation by the 26S proteasome in vitro. Finally, the inhibition of the proteasome by a combination of quercetin plus tannic acid in Hep-2 cells resulted in the induction of S5a at low dose, accumulation of ubiquitin, and the cleavage of pro-caspase-3, followed by the induction of apoptotic cell death. Evaluating the combination of quercetin and tannic acid as an oral drug to prevent cancer may provide a pharmacological rationale to pursue preclinical trials of this combination.\n\nThe critical role of quercetin in autophagy and apoptosis in HeLa cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yijun; Zhang, Wei; Lv, Qiongying; Zhang, Juan; Zhu, Dingjun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn recent years, the effects of quercetin on autophagy and apoptosis of cancer cells have been widely reported, while effects on HeLa cells are still unclear. Here, HeLa cells were subjected to quercetin treatment, and then proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy were evaluated using MTT, flow cytometry, and MDC staining, respectively. The LC3-I/II, Beclin 1, active caspase-3, and S6K1 phosphorylation were detected using Western blot assay. The ultrastructure of HeLa was observed via transmission electron microscope (TEM). Our findings showed that quercetin can dose-dependently inhibit the growth of HeLa cells. The MDC fluorescence was enhanced with increased concentration of quercetin and hit a plateau at 50Â Î¼mol/l. Western blot assay revealed that LC3-I/II ratio, Beclin 1, and active caspase-3 protein were enforced in a dose-dependent method. However, the phosphorylation of S6K1 gradually decreased, concomitant with an increase of autophagy. In addition, TEM revealed that the number of autophagic vacuoles was peaked at 50Â Î¼mol/l of quercetin. Besides, interference of autophagy with 3-MA led to proliferation inhibition and increased apoptosis in HeLa cells, accompanied by the decreased LC3-I/II conversion and the increased active caspase-3. In conclusion, quercetin can inhibit HeLa cell proliferation and induce protective autophagy at low concentrations; thus, 3-MA plus quercetin would suppress autophagy and effectively increased apoptosis.\n\nThe effect of quercetin nanoparticle on cervical cancer progression by inducing apoptosis, autophagy and anti-proliferation via JAK2 suppression.\n\nPubMed\n\nLuo, Cheng-Lin; Liu, Yu-Qiong; Wang, Peng; Song, Chun-Hua; Wang, Kai-Juan; Dai, Li-Ping; Zhang, Jian-Ying; Ye, Hua\n\n2016-08-01\n\nCervical cancer is a cause of cancer death, making it as the one of the most common cause for death among women globally. Though many studies before have explored a lot for cervical cancer prevention and treatment, there are still a lot far from to know based on the molecular mechanisms. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) has been reported to play an essential role in the progression of apoptosis, autophagy and proliferation for cells. We loaded gold-quercetin into poly (dl-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles to cervical cancer cells due to the propertities of quercetin in ameliorating cellular processes and the easier absorbance of nanoparticles. Here, in our study, quercetin nanoparticles (NQ) were administrated to cells to investigate the underlying mechanism by which the cervical cancer was regulated. First, JAK2-inhibited carvical cancer cell lines were involved for our experiments in vitro and in vivo. Western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), ELISA, Immunohistochemistry, and flow-cytometric analysis were used to determine the key signaling pathway regulated by JAK2 for cervical cancer progression. And the role of quercetin nanoparticles was determined during the process. Data here indicated that JAK2, indeed, expressed highly in cancer cell lines compared to the normal cervical cells. And apoptosis and autophagy were found in JAK2-inhibited cancer cells through activating Caspase-3, and suppressing Cyclin-D1 and mTOR regulated by Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 3/5 and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/protein kinases (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. The cervical cancer cells proliferation was inhibited. Further, tumor size and weight were reduced by inhibition of JAK2 in vivo experiments. Notably, administration with quercetin nanoparticles displayed similar role with JAK2 suppression, which could inhibit cervical cancer cells proliferation, invasion and migration. In addition, autophogy and apoptosis were induced, promoting cervical cancer cell\n\nEfficacy of quercetin against chemically induced murine oral squamous cell carcinoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDROGUETT, DANIEL; CASTILLO, CHRISTIAN; LEIVA, ELBA; THEODULOZ, CRISTINA; SCHMEDA-HIRSCHMANN, GUILLERMO; KEMMERLING, ULRIKE\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common form of head and neck cancer, and oxidative damage is associated with the development of OSCCs. Antioxidants have therefore been proposed for use as chemoprotective agents against different types of cancer. In the present study, the effect of the antioxidant quercetin, administered at doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, was investigated in an experimental murine model of 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced carcinogenesis. The survival of the treated animals, the plasmatic levels of reduced glutathione and the type and severity of lesions (according the International Histological Classification of Tumors and Bryne's Multifactorial Grading System for the Invasive Tumor Front) were assessed. Additionally, the organization of the extracellular matrix was analyzed by carbohydrate and collagen histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry was used to assess the expression of the tumor markers proliferating cell nuclear antigen and mutated p53. The results indicate that, despite the promising effect of quercetin in other studies, this drug is ineffective as a chemoprotective agent against 4-NQO-induced OSCC in mice at the assayed doses.

Skin tumor was induced by topical application of 7, 12-dimethyl Benz (a) anthracene (DMBA) and Croton oil in Swiss albino mouse. Quercetin was orally administered at a concentration of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight daily for 16 weeks in mouse to evaluate chemopreventive potential. Skin cancer was assessed by histopathological analysis. We found that quercetin reduced the tumor size and the cumulative number of papillomas. The mean latent period was significantly increased as compared to carcinogen treated controls. Quercetin significantly decreased the serum levels of glutamate oxalate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. It significantly increased the levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase. The elevated level of lipid peroxides in the control group was significantly inhibited by quercetin. Futhermore, DNA damage was significantly decreased in quercetin treated mice as compared to DMBA and croton oil treated mice. The results suggest that quercetin exerts chemopreventive effect on DMBA and croton oil induced skin cancer in mice by increasing antioxidant activities.

In the present study, chemopreventive efficacy of curcumin and quercetin was investigated against benzo(a)pyrene (BP)-induced lung carcinogenesis. The mice were segregated into five groups, which included normal control, BP-treated, BP + curcumin-treated, BP + quercetin-treated, and BP + curcumin + quercetin-treated groups. The morphological and histological analyses of tumor nodules confirmed lung carcinogenesis22 weeks after weeks single intraperitoneal injection of BP at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight to mice. Curcumin and quercetin when administered individually as well as in combination significantly elevated the expression of acetylated-p53, which was otherwise depressed due to BP treatment. Also, both the phytochemicals significantly reduced the BP-inflicted increased levels of phosphorylated-p53. Furthermore, observed increase in the number of apoptotic cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), assay and increased activities of caspase 3 and 9 confirmed the induction of apoptosis by curcumin and quercetin. Moreover, the histological slides also showed noticeable improvement in the histoarchitecture of lungs by phytochemicals. The present study concludes that prophylactic treatment with curcumin and quercetin induces apoptosis in the lungs by modulation of p53 posttranslational modifications.\n\nArctigenin in combination with quercetin synergistically enhances the antiproliferative effect in prostate cancer cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Piwen; Phan, Tien; Gordon, David; Chung, Seyung; Henning, Susanne M; Vadgama, Jaydutt V\n\n2015-02-01\n\nWe investigated whether a combination of two promising chemopreventive agents arctigenin (Arc) and quercetin (Q) increases the anticarcinogenic potency at lower concentrations than necessary when used individually in prostate cancer. Androgen-dependent LAPC-4 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with low doses of Arc and Q alone or in combination for 48 h. The antiproliferative activity of Arc was 10- to 20-fold stronger than Q in both cell lines. Their combination synergistically enhanced the antiproliferative effect, with a stronger effect in androgen receptor (AR) wild-type LAPC-4 cells than in AR mutated LNCaP cells. Arc demonstrated a strong ability to inhibit AR protein expression in LAPC-4 cells. The combination treatment significantly inhibited both AR and PI3K/Akt pathways compared to control. A protein array analysis revealed that the mixture targets multiple pathways particularly in LAPC-4 cells including Stat3 pathway. The mixture significantly inhibited the expression of several oncogenic microRNAs including miR-21, miR-19b, and miR-148a compared to control. The mixture also enhanced the inhibition of cell migration in both cell lines compared to individual compounds tested. The combination of Arc and Q that target similar pathways, at low physiological doses, provides a novel regimen with enhanced chemoprevention in prostate cancer. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, resistance against lapatinib is an unresolved problem in clinical oncology. Recently, interest in the use of natural compounds to prevent or treat cancers has gained increasing interest because of presumed low toxicity. Quercetin-3-methyl ether, a naturally occurring compound present in various plants, has potent anticancer activity. Here, we found that quercetin-3-methyl ether caused in a significant growth inhibition of lapatinib-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cells. Western blot data showed that quercetin-3-methyl ether had no effect on Akt or ERKs signaling in resistant cells. However, quercetin-3-methyl ether caused a pronounced G2/M block mainly through the Chk1-Cdc25c-cyclin B1/Cdk1 pathway in lapatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells. In contrast, lapatinib produced an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase mediated through cyclin D1, but only in lapatinib-sensitive cells. Moreover, quercetin-3-methyl ether induced significant apoptosis, accompanied with increased levels of cleaved caspase 3, caspase 7 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in both cell lines. Overall, these results suggested that quercetin-3-methyl ether might be a novel and promising therapeutic agent in lapatinib-sensitive or -resistant breast cancer patients.

Various anticancer drugs including adriamycin, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine were used. Cell viability was measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphe-nyltetra zolium bromide assay. Apoptosis was determined by 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclei staining and flow cytometry in PANC-1 cells treated with 50 Âµg/mL quercetin for 24 hours. Expression of endoplas mic reticulum (ER) stress mediators including, Grp78/Bip, p-PERK, PERK, ATF4, ATF6 and GADD153/CHOP proteins were measured by Western blot analysis. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by fluorescence staining with JC-1, rhodamine 123. Quercetin induced the apoptosis of PANC-1, which was characterized as nucleic acid and genomic DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and sub-G0/G1 fraction of cell cycle increase. But not adriamycin, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and 5-FU. PANC-1 cells were markedly sensitive to quercetin. Treatment with quercetin resulted in the increased accumulation of intracellular Ca(2+) ion. Treatment with quercetin also increased the expression of Grp78/Bip and GADD153/CHOP protein and induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Quercetin exerted cytotoxicity against human pancreatic cancer cells via ER stress-mediated apoptotic signaling including reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial dysfunction. These data suggest that quercetin may be an important modulator of chemosensitivity of cancer cells against anticancer chemotherapeutic agents.\n\nMolecular mechanisms of action of quercetin in cancer: recent advances.\n\nPubMed\n\nKashyap, Dharambir; Mittal, Sonam; Sak, Katrin; Singhal, Paavan; Tuli, Hardeep Singh\n\n2016-10-01\n\nIn the last few decades, the scientific community has discovered an immense potential of natural compounds in the treatment of dreadful diseases such as cancer. Besides the availability of a variety of natural bioactive molecules, efficacious cancer therapy still needs to be developed. So, to design an efficacious cancer treatment strategy, it is essential to understand the interactions of natural molecules with their respective cellular targets. Quercetin (Quer) is a naturally occurring flavonol present in many commonly consumed food items. It governs numerous intracellular targets, including the proteins involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, detoxification, antioxidant replication, and angiogenesis. The weight of available synergistic studies vigorously fortifies the utilization of Quer as a chemoprevention drug. This extensive review covers various therapeutic interactions of Quer with their recognized cellular targets involved in cancer treatment.\n\nHigher plasma quercetin levels following oral administration of an onion skin extract compared with pure quercetin dihydrate in humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurak, Constanze; BrÃ¼ll, Verena; Langguth, Peter; Zimmermann, Benno F; Stoffel-Wagner, Birgit; Sausen, Udo; Stehle, Peter; Wolffram, Siegfried; Egert, Sarah\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTo investigate the plasma kinetics of quercetin derived from hard capsules filled with onion skin extract powder or quercetin dihydrate in humans. In a randomized, single-blind, diet-controlled crossover study, 12 healthy subjects (six men and six women) aged 21-33Â years were administered a single oral supra-nutritional dose of approximately 163Â mg quercetin derived from onion skin extract powder (containing 95.3Â % of total flavonoids as quercetin aglycone) or quercetin dihydrate (134Â mg quercetin aglycone equivalent). Blood samples were collected before and during a 24-h period after quercetin administration. The concentrations of quercetin and its two monomethylated derivatives, isorhamnetin (3'-O-methyl quercetin), and tamarixetin (4'-O-methyl quercetin), were measured using HPLC with fluorescence detection after plasma enzymatic treatment. The systemic availability, determined by comparing the plasma concentration-time curves of quercetin, was 4.8 times higher, and the maximum plasma concentration (C max ) was 5.4 times higher after ingestion of the onion skin extract than after ingestion of pure quercetin dihydrate. By contrast, t max did not differ significantly between the two formulations. The C max values for isorhamnetin and tamarixetin were 3.8 and 4.4 times higher, respectively, after administration of onion skin extract than after pure quercetin dihydrate. The plasma kinetics of quercetin were not significantly different in men and women. Quercetin aglycone derived from onion skin extract powder is significantly more bioavailable than that from quercetin dihydrate powder filled hard capsules.\n\nQuercetin does not alter the oral bioavailability of Atorvastatin in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoritala, Rekha; Challa, Siva Reddy; Ragam, Satheesh Kumar; Geddam, Lal Babu; Venkatesh Reddy Challa, Venkatesh Reddy; Devi, Renuka; Sattenapalli, Srinu; Babu, Narendra\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of Quercetin on the pharmacokinetics of Atorvastatin Calcium. In-vivo Pharmacokinetic studies were performed on rats in a single dose study and multiple dose study. Rats were treated with Quercetin (10 mg/kg) and Atorvastatin Calcium (20 mg/kg) orally and blood samples were collected at (0) pretreatment and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours post treatment. Plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin were estimated by HPLC method. Quercetin treatment did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin like AUC(0-24), AUC(0-Î±) , T(max), C(max) and T(Â½) in both single dose and multiple dose studies of Atorvastatin Calcium. Quercetin does not alter the oral bioavailability of Atorvastatin Calcium in rats.\n\nQuercetin-induced downregulation of phospholipase D1 inhibits proliferation and invasion in U87 glioma cells\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPark, Mi Hee; Min, Do Sik, E-mail: minds@pusan.ac.kr\n\nHighlights: {yields} Quercetin, a bioactive flavonoid, suppresses expression and enzymatic activity of phospholipase D1. {yields} Quercetin abolishes NFkB-induced phospholipase D1 expression via inhibition of NFkB transactivation. {yields} Quercetin-induced suppression of phospholipase D1 inhibits invasion and proliferation of human glioma cells. -- Abstract: Phospholipase D (PLD) has been recognized as a regulator of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, but little is known about the molecules regulating PLD expression. Thus, the identification of small molecules inhibiting PLD expression would be an important advance in PLD-mediated physiology. Quercetin, a ubiquitous bioactive flavonoid, is known to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in a variety ofmoreÂ Â» cancer cells. In the present study, we examined the effect of quercetin on the expression of PLD in U87 glioma cells. Quercetin significantly suppressed the expression of PLD1 at the transcriptional level. Moreover, quercetin abolished the protein expression of PLD1 in a time and dose-dependent manner, as well as inhibited PLD activity. Quercetin suppressed NF{kappa}B-induced PLD1 expression via inhibition of NFkB transactivation. Furthermore, quercetin inhibited activation and invasion of metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a key modulator of glioma cell invasion, induced by phosphatidic acid (PA), a product of PLD activity. Taken together these data demonstrate that quercetin abolishes PLD1 expression and subsequently inhibits invasion and proliferation of glioma cells.Â«Â less\n\nEffect of quercetin on apoptosis of PANC-1 cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Joo Hyun; Lee, Han-Beom; Jung, Gum O; Oh, Jung Taek; Park, Dong Eun\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPurpose To investigate the chemotherapeutic effect of quercetin against cancer cells, signaling pathway of apoptosis was explored in human pancreatic cells. Methods Various anticancer drugs including adriamycin, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine were used. Cell viability was measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphe-nyltetra zolium bromide assay. Apoptosis was determined by 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclei staining and flow cytometry in PANC-1 cells treated with 50 Âµg/mL quercetin for 24 hours. Expression of endoplas mic reticulum (ER) stress mediators including, Grp78/Bip, p-PERK, PERK, ATF4, ATF6 and GADD153/CHOP proteins were measured by Western blot analysis. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by fluorescence staining with JC-1, rhodamine 123. Quercetin induced the apoptosis of PANC-1, which was characterized as nucleic acid and genomic DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and sub-G0/G1 fraction of cell cycle increase. But not adriamycin, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and 5-FU. PANC-1 cells were markedly sensitive to quercetin. Results Treatment with quercetin resulted in the increased accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ ion. Treatment with quercetin also increased the expression of Grp78/Bip and GADD153/CHOP protein and induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Quercetin exerted cytotoxicity against human pancreatic cancer cells via ER stress-mediated apoptotic signaling including reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusion These data suggest that quercetin may be an important modulator of chemosensitivity of cancer cells against anticancer chemotherapeutic agents.

Animal and human studies have shown that flavonoids have remarkable toxicological profiles. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of quercetin in an experimental radiation-induced brain injury. A total of 32 adult male Wistar-Albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (control, quercetin, radiation, and radiation+quercetin groups, with eight rats in each group). Doses (50 mg/kg) of quercetin were administered to the animals in the quercetin and radiation+quercetin groups; radiation and radiation+quercetin groups were exposed to a dose of 20 Gy to the cranium region. Tissue samples, and biochemical levels of tissue injury markers in the four groups were compared. In all measured parameters of oxidative stress, administration of quercetin significantly demonstrated favorable effects. Both plasma and tissue levels of malondialdehyde and total antioxidant status significantly changed in favor of antioxidant activity. Histopathological evaluation of the tissues also demonstrated a significant decrease in cellular degeneration and infiltration parameters after quercetin administration. Quercetin demonstrated significant neuroprotection after radiation-induced brain injury. Further studies of neurological outcomes under different experimental settings are required in order to achieve conclusive results.\n\nChemical Proteomics Identifies Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 as the Molecular Target of Quercetin in Its Anti-cancer Effects in PC-3 Cells*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKo, Chia-Chen; Chen, Yun-Ju; Chen, Chih-Ta; Liu, Yu-Chih; Cheng, Fong-Chi; Hsu, Kai-Chao; Chow, Lu-Ping\n\n2014-01-01\n\nQuercetin, a flavonoid abundantly present in plants, is widely used as a phytotherapy in prostatitis and prostate cancer. Although quercetin has been reported to have a number of therapeutic effects, the cellular target(s) responsible for its anti-cancer action has not yet been clearly elucidated. Here, employing affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) as a direct target of quercetin. A specific interaction between quercetin and hnRNPA1 was validated by immunoblotting and in vitro binding experiments. We found that quercetin bound the C-terminal region of hnRNPA1, impairing the ability of hnRNPA1 to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and ultimately resulting in its cytoplasmic retention. In addition, hnRNPA1 was recruited to stress granules after treatment of cells with quercetin for up to 48 h, and the levels of cIAP1 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis), an internal ribosome entry site translation-dependent protein, were reduced by hnRNPA1 regulation. This is the first report that anti-cancer effects of quercetin are mediated, in part, by impairing functions of hnRNPA1, insights that were obtained using a chemical proteomics strategy.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an experimental diet containing either 0, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 g/kg of quercetin for 15 days. The DNA microarray analysis of the gene expression profile in pooled RNA samples from rats fed diets containing 0, 5, and 20 g/kg of quercetin revealed genes of some isoenzymes of glutathione transferase (Gst) and aldo-keto reductase (Akr) to be activated by this flavonoid. Real-time PCR conducted with RNA samples from individual rats fed varying amounts of quercetin together with the microarray analysis showed that quercetin caused marked dose-dependent increases in the mRNA expression of Gsta3, Gstp1, and Gstt3. Some moderate increases were also noted in the mRNA expression of isoenzymes belonging to the Gstm class. Quercetin also dose-dependently increased the mRNA expression of Akr1b8 and Akr7a3. However, it did not affect the parameters of the other Gst and Akr isoenzymes. It is apparent that quercetin increases the mRNA expression of Gst and Akr involved in drug metabolism in an isoenzyme-specific manner. Inasmuch as Gst and Akr isoenzymes up-regulated in their gene expression are involved in the prevention and attenuation of cancer development, this consequence may account for the chemopreventive propensity of quercetin.\n\nFlavonoids apigenin and quercetin inhibit melanoma growth and metastatic potential.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaltagirone, S; Rossi, C; Poggi, A; Ranelletti, F O; Natali, P G; Brunetti, M; Aiello, F B; Piantelli, M\n\n2000-08-15\n\nFlavonoids are a class of polyphenolic compounds widely distributed in the plant kingdom, which display a variety of biological activities, including chemoprevention and tumor growth inhibition. Our aim was to investigate the effects of several polyphenols on the growth and metastatic potential of B16-BL6 melanoma cells in vivo. Intraperitoneal administration of quercetin, apigenin, (-)-epigallocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG), resveratrol, and the anti-estrogen tamoxifen, at the time of i.m. injection of B16-BL6 cells into syngeneic mice, resulted in a significant, dose-dependent delay of tumor growth, without toxicity. The relative descending order of potency was EGCG > apigenin = quercetin = tamoxifen > resveratrol > control. Furthermore, polyphenols significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect of a non-toxic dose of cisplatin. When tested for the ability to inhibit lung colonization, quercetin, apigenin, and tamoxifen (but not EGCG or resveratrol) significantly decreased the number of B16-BL6 colonies in the lungs in a dose-dependent manner, with quercetin and apigenin being more effective than tamoxifen. Interestingly, quercetin, apigenin, and tamoxifen (but not EGCG or resveratrol) significantly decreased the invasion of B16-BL6 cells in vitro, with quercetin and apigenin being more effective than tamoxifen. This suggests that anti-invasive activity is one of the mechanisms underlying inhibition of lung colonization by quercetin and apigenin. In conclusion, quercetin and apigenin inhibit melanoma growth and invasive and metastatic potential; therefore, they may constitute a valuable tool in the combination therapy of metastatic melanoma.

The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of a microemulsion for that purpose. A microemulsion consisting of isopropyl myristate, 150 mM NaCl solution, Tween 80 and ethanol was prepared. The skin delivery of quercetin by microemulsion using excised guinea-pig and Yucatan micropig skin in Franz diffusion cells was examined. Lipid peroxidation in skin was also tested using iron(II) and citrate. Using a w/o microemulsion as a vehicle, intradermal delivery of quercetin was significantly increased, as was its solubility. Quercetin penetrated deep into the skin, but no transfer was observed into the receptor compartment. It was confirmed that quercetin retained in the skin dose-dependently inhibited lipid peroxidation. The findings indicate the potential use of microemulsions for the skin delivery of quercetin, where it exerts antioxidative effects.\n\nQuercetin increased the antiproliferative activity of green tea polyphenol (â)-epigallocatechin gallate in prostate cancer cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Piwen; Heber, David; Henning, Susanne M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe previously demonstrated that 50% of (â)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was present in methylated form (4â³-MeEGCG) in human prostate tissue, which is less bioactive. We therefore investigated whether quercetin, a natural inhibitor of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), will inhibit EGCG methylation leading to enhanced antiproliferative activity of EGCG in prostate cancer cells. Incubation with both, quercetin and EGCG, for 2 hr increased the cellular concentrations of EGCG by 4 to 8-fold and 6 to 10-fold in androgen-independent PC-3 cells and androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, respectively. Concurrently, the percent of 4â³-MeEGCG in the total EGCG was decreased from 39% to 15% in PC-3 cells and from 61% to 38% in LNCaP cells. Quercetin and EGCG in combination synergistically inhibited cell proliferation, caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. In LNCaP cells EGCG and quercetin exhibited a stronger antiproliferative activity leading to an additive effect. The synergistic effect of these two agents in PC-3 cells could be based on the fact that EGCG primarily inhibited COMT activity while quercetin reduced the amount of COMT protein. In summary, quercetin combined with EGCG in vitro demonstrated enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation by increasing the intracellular concentration of EGCG and decreasing EGCG methylation.

A simple, rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed to simultaneously determine quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin absorped by human breast cancer cells. Cells were treated with ginkgo flavonols and then lysed with Triton-X 100. The flavonols in the samples were measured by RP-HPLC with a C18 column after a simple extraction with a mixture of ether and acetone. The mobile phase contained phosphate buffer (pH 2.0; 10 mM) tetrahydrofuran, methanol and isopropanol (65:15:10:20, v/v/v/v). The ultraviolet detector was operated at 380 nm. The calibration curve was linear from 0.1 to 1.0 microM (r > 0.999) for each flavonol. The mean extraction efficiency was about 70%. The recovery of the assay was between 98.9 and 100.6%. The limit of detection was 0.01 microM for quercetin and kaempferol and 0.05 microM for isorhamnetin. The limit of quantitation was 0.1 microM (R.S.D.<10%) for each flavonol. The intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 10% (R.S.D.). The validated method was applied to quantify quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin in human breast cancer Bcap37 and Bcap37/MDR1 cells.\n\nAmeliorative Effect of Quercetin on Neurochemical and Behavioral Deficits in Rotenone Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease: Modulating Autophagy (Quercetin on Experimental Parkinson's Disease).\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Horany, Hemat E; El-Latif, Rania N Abd; ElBatsh, Maha M; Emam, Marwa N\n\n2016-07-01\n\nAutophagy is necessary for neuronal homeostasis and its dysfunction has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) as it can exacerbate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER stress-induced apoptosis. Quercetin is a flavonoid known for its neuroprotective and antioxidant effects. The present study investigated the protective, autophagy-modulating effects of quercetin in the rotenone rat model of PD. Rotenone was intraperitoneally injected at dose of 2Â ml/kg/day for 4 weeks. Simultaneous intraperitoneal injection of quercetin was given at a dose of 50Â mg/kg/day also for 4 weeks. Neurobehavioral changes were studied. Oxidative/antioxidant status, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Beclin-1, and dopamine levels were assessed. DNA fragmentation and histopathological changes were evaluated. This research work revealed that quercetin significantly attenuated rotenone-induced behavioral impairment, augmented autophagy, ameliorated ER stress- induced apoptosis with attenuated oxidative stress. From the current study, quercetin can act as an autophagy enhancer in PD rat model and modulates the microenvironment that leads to neuronal death.

The intra-articular administration of zymosan is an experimental model that promotes inflammatory parameters resembling RA. Therefore, this model was used to investigate the efficacy of quercetin as a treatment of articular inflammation. Treatment with quercetin dose-dependently reduced zymosan-induced hyperalgesia, articular edema and the recruitment of neutrophils to the knee joint cavity. Histological analysis confirmed that quercetin inhibited zymosan-induced arthritis. The treatment with quercetin also inhibited zymosan-induced depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, TNFÎ± and IL-1Î² production, and gp91 phox , prepro-endothelin-1 (preproET-1), and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression. These molecular effects of quercetin were related to the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-B and induction of Nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor (Nrf2)/home oxygenase (HO-1) pathway. Thus, quercetin exerted anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antioxidant effects in experimental arthritis, suggesting quercetin is a possible candidate for arthritis treatment.

Thus, dysregulation of this pathway contributes to the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2diabetes, and cancer. We previously reported that a combination of grape polyphenols (resveratrol, quercetin and catechin: RQC), at equimolar concentrations, reduces breast cancer (BC) growth and metastasis in nude mice, and inhibits Akt and mTOR activities and activates AMPK, an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR, in metastatic BC cells. The objective of the present study was to determine the contribution of individual polyphenols to the effect of combined RQC on mTOR signaling. Metastatic BC cells were treated with RQC individually or in combination, at various concentrations, and the activities (phosphorylation) of AMPK, Akt, and the mTOR downstream effectors, p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and 4E binding protein (4EBP1), were determined by Western blot. Results show that quercetin was the most effective compound for Akt/mTOR inhibition. Treatment with quercetin at 15Î¼M had a similar effect as the RQC combination in the inhibition of BC cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. However, cell cycle analysis showed that the RQC treatment arrested BC cells in the G1 phase, while quercetin arrested the cell cycle in G2/M. In vivo experiments, using SCID mice with implanted tumors from metastatic BC cells, demonstrated that administration of quercetin at 15mg/kg body weight resulted in a ~70% reduction in tumor growth. In conclusion, quercetin appears to be a viable grape polyphenol for future development as an anti BC therapeutic.

The anticancer activity of quercetin at 10, 20, 40, 80 and 120 ÂµM was assessed in vitro by MMT assay in 9 tumor cell lines (colon carcinoma CT-26 cells, prostate adenocarcinoma LNCaP cells, human prostate PC3 cells, pheocromocytoma PC12 cells, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells, acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 T-cells, human myeloma U266B1 cells, human lymphoid Raji cells and ovarian cancer CHO cells). Quercetin was found to induce the apoptosis of all the tested cancer cell lines at the utilized concentrations. Moreover, quercetin significantly induced the apoptosis of the CT-26, LNCaP, MOLT-4 and Raji cell lines, as compared to control group (P<0.001), as demonstrated by Annexin V/PI staining. In in vivo experiments, mice bearing MCF-7 and CT-26 tumors exhibited a significant reduction in tumor volume in the quercetin-treated group as compared to the control group (P<0.001). Taken together, quercetin, a naturally occurring compound, exhibits anticancer properties both in vivo and in vitro.

Earlier studies describe the details of the complex formation, characterization and antioxidant study of the complex but toxicity profile is still under darkness. The present study was taken up to investigate the oral acute toxicity, 28days repeated oral sub-acute toxicity study and genotoxicity study of Quercetin-Magnesium complex in Swiss albino mice. Quercetin-Magnesium complex showed mortality at a dose of 185mg/kg in the Swiss albino mice. In 28days repeated oral toxicity study, Quercetin-Magnesium complex was administered to both sex of Swiss albino mice at dose levels of 150, 130 and 100mg/kg body weight respectively. Where 150mg/kg dose shows increased levels of white blood cells and changes in total protein, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Histopathological study of Quercetin-Magnesium complex shows minor structural alteration in kidney at 150mg/kg dose. No observed toxic level found in 130mg/kg or below doses. No genotoxic effect found in any doses of the complex. Therefore 130mg/kg or below dose level could be better for further study. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

During latency, virus exists predominantly as a chromatin-associated, multicopy episome in the nuclei of a variety of tumor cells derived from B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and epithelial cells. Licorice is the root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis or G. glabra that has traditionally cultivated in eastern part of Asia. Licorice was reported to have anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-atopic, hepatoprotective, anti-neurodegenerative, anti-tumor, anti-diabetic effects and so forth. Quercetin and isoliquiritigenin are produced from licorice and highly similar in molecular structure. They have diverse bioactive effects such as antiviral activity, anti-asthmatic activity, anti-cancer activity, anti-inflammation activity, monoamine-oxidase inhibitor, and etc. To determine anti-EBV and anti-EBVaGC (Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric carcinoma) effects of licorice, we investigated antitumor and antiviral effects of quercetin and isoliquiritigenin against EBVaGC. Although both quercetin and isoliquiritigenin are cytotoxic to SNU719 cells, quercetin induced more apoptosis in SNU719 cells than isoliquiritigenin, more completely eliminated DNMT1 and DNMT3A expressions than isoliquiritigenin, and more strongly affects the cell cycle progression of SNU719 than isoliquiritigenin. Both quercetin and isoliquiritigenin induce signal transductions to stimulate apoptosis, and induce EBV gene transcription. Quercetin enhances frequency of F promoter use, whereas isoliquiritigenin enhances frequency of Q promoter use. Quercetin reduces EBV latency, whereas isoliquiritigenin increases the latency. Quercetin increases more the EBV progeny production, and inhibits more EBV infection than isoliquiritigenin. These results indicate that quercetin could be a promising candidate for antiviral and antitumor agents against EBV and human gastric carcinoma\n\nEffects of the flavonoid drug quercetin on the response of human prostate tumours to hyperthermia in vitro and in vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nAsea, A; Ara, G; Teicher, B A; Stevenson, M A; Calderwood, S K\n\n2001-01-01\n\nTumour hyperthermia, although potentially a powerful therapeutic agent and radiation sensitizer, is hindered by a number of considerations including inhomogeneous heating of deep seated tumours due to energy deposition and perfusion issues. One solution is to design hyperthermia sensitizers to amplify the effects of hyperthermia, particularly at cold spots within the tumour undergoing treatment. This study examined the use of Quercetin, a flavonoid drug shown previously to antagonize the expression of HSP72 and induce apoptosis as a sensitizer of prostate cancer growth in vivo. Quercetin dose-dependently suppressed PC-3 tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. When combined in a treatment protocol with hyperthermia, quercetin drastically inhibited tumour growth and potently amplified the effects of hyperthermia on two prostate tumour types, PC-3 and DU-145 in vivo. These experiments, thus, suggest the use of Quercetin as a hyperthermia sensitizer in the treatment of prostate carcinoma.\n\nOral administration of quercetin is unable to protect against isoproterenol cardiotoxicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nRÃ­ha, Michal; VoprÅ¡alovÃ¡, Marie; PilaÅovÃ¡, Veronika; SemeckÃ½, VladimÃ­r; HoleÄkovÃ¡, Magdalena; VÃ¡vrovÃ¡, Jaroslava; Palicka, Vladimir; FilipskÃ½, TomÃ¡Å¡; Hrdina, RadomÃ­r; NovÃ¡kovÃ¡, Lucie; MladÄnka, PÅemysl\n\n2014-09-01\n\nCatecholamines are endogenous amines that participate in the maintenance of cardiovascular system homeostasis. However, excessive release or exogenous administration of catecholamines is cardiotoxic. The synthetic catecholamine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol, ISO), with non-selective Î²-agonistic activity has been used as a viable model of acute myocardial toxicity for many years. Since the pathophysiology of ISO-cardiotoxicity is complex, the aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of oral quercetin pretreatment on myocardial ISO toxicity. Wistar-Han rats were randomly divided into four groups: solvent or quercetin administered orally by gavage in a dose of 10Â mgÂ kg(-1) daily for 7Â days were followed by s.c. water for injection or ISO in a dose of 100Â mgÂ kg(-1). Haemodynamic, ECG and biochemical parameters were measured; effects on blood vessels and myocardial histology were assessed, and accompanying pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. Quercetin was unable to protect the cardiovascular system against acute ISO cardiotoxicity (stroke volume decrease, cardiac troponin T release, QRS-T junction elevation and histological impairment). The sole positive effect of quercetin on catecholamine-induced cardiotoxicity was the normalization of increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure caused by ISO. Quercetin did not reverse the increased responsiveness of rat aorta to vasoconstriction in ISO-treated animals, but it decreased the same parameter in the control animals. Accompanying pharmacokinetic analysis showed absorption of quercetin and its metabolite 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid formed by bacterial microflora. In conclusion, a daily oral dose of 10Â mgÂ kg(-1) of quercetin for 7Â days did not ameliorate acute ISO-cardiovascular toxicity in rats despite minor positive cardiovascular effects.\n\nEstrogen modulation properties of mangiferin and quercetin and the mangiferin metabolite norathyriol.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilkinson, Ashley S; Taing, Meng-Wong; Pierson, Jean Thomas; Lin, Chun-Nam; Dietzgen, Ralf G; Shaw, P Nicholas; Gidley, Michael J; Monteith, Gregory R; Roberts-Thomson, Sarah J\n\n2015-06-01\n\nMango fruit contain many bioactive compounds, some of which are transcription factor regulators. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) and beta (ERÎ²) are two regulators of gene transcription that are important in a variety of physiological processes and also in diseases including breast cancer. We examined the ability of the mango constituents quercetin, mangiferin, and the aglycone form of mangiferin, norathyriol, to activate both isoforms of the estrogen receptor. Quercetin and norathyriol decreased the viability of MCF-7 breast cancer cells whereas mangiferin had no effect on MCF-7 cells. We also determined that quercetin and mangiferin selectively activated ERÎ± whereas norathyriol activated both ERÎ± and ERÎ². Despite quercetin, mangiferin and norathyriol having similar polyphenolic structural motifs, only norathyriol activated ERÎ², showing that bioactive agents in mangoes have very specific biological effects. Such specificity may be important given the often-opposing roles of ERÎ± and ERÎ² in breast cancer proliferation and other cellular processes.\n\nTherapeutic charm of quercetin and its derivatives: a review of research and patents.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharma, Ajay; Kashyap, Dharambir; Sak, Katrin; Tuli, Hardeep Singh; Sharma, Anil K\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBioactive polyphenolic compounds derived from plants are being utilized for prevention of various chronic diseases including cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Quercetin, a potential poly-phenolic flavonol, found in onions, apples and berries, has been implicated against cancer proliferation, chronic inflammation and various other oxidative manifestations. Evidences suggested that quercetin negatively regulates the numerous crucial signaling pathways associated with life-threatening diseases. Major signaling pathways including NF-ÎºB,Â MAPK, PI3K-AKT and mTOR are found to be regulated by quercetin. In addition, several patents have reported recently on quercetin derivatives describing wide therapeutic applications such as anticancer/antiproliferatory, antioxidative/antiaging, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective. Present review emphasizes the chemistry and sources of quercetin followed by description of its broad-spectrum therapeutic potential along with proposed mechanisms of action. Furthermore, this review also highlights the important modifications in the basic chemical structure of quercetin in terms of published patents. Insolubility of the bioactive compounds restricts their medicinal importance which could be overcome by modifications in the chemical structure of so-called derivatives. Most of the patents deal with the modifications in chemical structure of quercetin mainly at hydroxyl groups and C-6 and C-7 positions.\n\nQuercetin exerts synergetic anti-cancer activity with 10-hydroxy camptothecin.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Qin; Ji, Fangling; Wang, Jingyun; Guo, Lianying; Li, Yachen; Bao, Yongming\n\n2017-11-15\n\nQuercetin (Qu) is known as a dietary antioxidant with numerous bioactivities, but its function in anti-cancer has not been fully investigated. Here, we show that Qu at low doses (â¤10Î¼M) significantly enhances the inhibition of 10-hydroxy camptothecin (HCPT) on the proliferation of MCF7, BGC823 and HepG2 cells. A plasmid DNA relaxation assay indicates that the inhibition of HCPT on the catalytic activity of topoisomerase I (Topo I) is increased by Qu at 10Î¼M. Compared to the treatment by Qu or HCPT alone, phosphorylation at Ser 139 of Î³H2A.X in MCF7 cells starts to increase significantly (P<0.05) at 6h when treated by the combination of 10Î¼M Qu and 0.62Î¼M HCPT. Moreover, the combinational group successively arrests MCF7 cells at G1, S and G2/M phases from 1"
