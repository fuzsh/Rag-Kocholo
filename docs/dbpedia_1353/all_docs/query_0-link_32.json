This document summarizes a court case regarding the import of goods by Cebu United Enterprises. \n\nThe key issues were: 1) Whether the valid period of the import license should be counted from when the ships carrying the goods left port, or from the date on the bills of lading. The court ruled the date of shipment is the date on the bills of lading, not when the ships departed. 2) Whether the goods were imported within the validity period of the license. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the importation occurred before the license expired.",
