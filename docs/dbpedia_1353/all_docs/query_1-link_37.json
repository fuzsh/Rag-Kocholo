The petitioner, Christian General Assembly, Inc., entered into a contract to sell a subdivision lot with the respondents. However, the petitioner later discovered that the property was actually part of a larger property that was under litigation. As a result, the petitioner filed a case in regional trial court seeking rescission of the contract. The respondents argued the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, claiming it fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, but the Court of Appeals reversed, finding the HLURB had exclusive jurisdiction. The petitioner now seeks to overturn the Court of Appeals decision.",
