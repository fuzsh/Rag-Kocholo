        "text": "Genotoxicity-Related Chemistry of Human Metabolites of Benzo[ghi]perylene (B[ghi]P) Investigated using Electro-optical Arrays and DNA/Microsome Biocolloid Reactors with LC-MS/MS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPan, Shenmin; Li, Dandan; Zhao, Linlin; Schenkman, John B.; Rusling, James F.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThere is limited and sometimes contradictory information about the genotoxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[ghi]perylene (B[ghi]P). Using recently developed metabolic toxicity screening arrays and a biocolloid reactor-LC-MS/MS approach, both featuring films of DNA and human metabolic enzymes, we demonstrated relatively low reactivity of metabolically activated B[ghi]P towards DNA. Electro-optical toxicity screening arrays showed that B[ghi]P metabolites damage DNA at a 3-fold lower rate than benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), whose metabolites have a strong and well-understood propensity for DNA damage. Metabolic studies using magnetic bead biocolloid reactors coated with microsomal enzymes in 96-well plates showed that cyt P450s 1A1 and 1B1 provide high activity for B[ghi]P and B[a]P conversion. Consistent with published results, the major metabolism of B[ghi]P involved oxidations at 3,4 and 11,12 positions, leading to formation of B[ghi]P 3,4-oxide and B[ghi]P 3,4,11,12-bisoxide. B[ghi]P 3,4-oxide was synthesized and reacted with deoxyadenosine at N6 and N7 positions and with deoxyguanosine at the N2 position. B[ghi]P 3,4-oxide is hydrolytically unstable and transforms into the 3,4-diol or converts to 3- or 4-hydroxy B[ghi]P. LC-MS/MS of reaction products from the magnetic biocolloid reactor particles coated with DNA and human enzymes revealed for the first time that a major DNA adduct results from reaction between B[ghi]P 3,4,11,12-bisoxide and deoxyguanosine. Results also demonstrated 5-fold lower formation rates of the major DNA adduct for B[ghi]P metabolites compared to B[a]P. Overall, results from both ECL array and biocolloid reactor-LC-MS/MS consistently suggest a lower human genotoxicity profile of B[ghi]P than B[a]P.

This paper describes a statistical analysis of the global horizontal solar irradiation (GHI) at Fez city, Morocco. For better reliability, we have first applied a set of check procedures to test the quality of hourly GHI measurements. We then eliminate the erroneous values which are generally due to measurement or the cosine effect errors. Statistical analysis show that the annual mean daily values of GHI is of approximately 5 kWh/mÂ²/day. Daily monthly mean values and other parameter are also calculated.\n\nIdentification of periods of clear sky irradiance in time series of GHI measurements\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nReno, Matthew J.; Hansen, Clifford W.\n\n2016-01-18\n\nIn this study, we present a simple algorithm for identifying periods of time with broadband global horizontal irradiance (GHI) similar to that occurring during clear sky conditions from a time series of GHI measurements. Other available methods to identify these periods do so by identifying periods with clear sky conditions using additional measurements, such as direct or diffuse irradiance. Our algorithm compares characteristics of the time series of measured GHI with the output of a clear sky model without requiring additional measurements. We validate our algorithm using data from several locations by comparing our results with those obtained from amoreÂ Â» clear sky detection algorithm, and with satellite and ground-based sky imagery.Â«Â less\n\nIdentification of periods of clear sky irradiance in time series of GHI measurements\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nReno, Matthew J.; Hansen, Clifford W.\n\nIn this study, we present a simple algorithm for identifying periods of time with broadband global horizontal irradiance (GHI) similar to that occurring during clear sky conditions from a time series of GHI measurements.

Firstly we evaluated the model's performance by comparing calculated GHI values for the Base Case with observations for the Reunion Island for 2014. In general, the model calculates the largest bias during the austral summer. This indicates that the model is less accurate in timing the formation and dissipation of clouds during the summer, when higher water vapor quantities are present in the atmosphere than during the austral winter. Secondly, the model sensitivity on changing the microphysics, cumulus parameterization and land surface models on calculated GHI values is evaluated. The sensitivity simulations showed that changing the microphysics from the Thompson scheme (or Single-Moment 6-class scheme) to the Morrison double-moment scheme, the relative bias improves from 45% to 10%. The underlying reason for this improvement is that the Morrison double-moment scheme predicts the mass and number concentrations of five hydrometeors, which help to improve the calculation of the densities, size and lifetime of the cloud droplets. While the single moment schemes only predicts the mass for less hydrometeors. Changing the cumulus parameterization schemes and land surface models does not have a large impact on GHI calculations.\n\nDOCKING OF STRUCTURALLY RELATED DIOLEPOXIDES OF BENZO(GHI)FLUORANTHENE WITH DNA\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nDocking of structurally-related diolepoxides of benzo{ghi}fluoranthene and benzo{c}phenanthrene with DNA\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a class of chemicals found in the environment.

P.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRedox-cycling compounds, including endogenously produced phenazine antibiotics, induce expression of the efflux pump MexGHI-OpmD in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Previous studies of P. aeruginosa virulence, physiology, and biofilm development have focused on the blue phenazine pyocyanin and the yellow phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). In P. aeruginosa phenazine biosynthesis, conversion of PCA to pyocyanin is presumed to proceed through the intermediate 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylate (5-Me-PCA), a reactive compound that has eluded detection in most laboratory samples. Here, we apply electrochemical methods to directly detect 5-Me-PCA and find that it is transported by MexGHI-OpmD in P. aeruginosa strain PA14 planktonic and biofilm cells. We also show that 5-Me-PCA is sufficient to fully induce MexGHI-OpmD expression and that it is required for wild-type colony biofilm morphogenesis. These physiological effects are consistent with the high redox potential of 5-Me-PCA, which distinguishes it from other well-studied P. aeruginosa phenazines. Our observations highlight the importance of this compound, which was previously overlooked due to the challenges associated with its detection, in the context of P. aeruginosa gene expression and multicellular behavior. This study constitutes a unique demonstration of efflux-based self-resistance, controlled by a simple circuit, in a Gram-negative pathogen.

It has been known that dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic coronary artery disease have become more frequent in patients with celiac disease. The aim of the study was to assess Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio in patients with celiac disease. This study was conducted at a single center in collaboration with gastroenterology and cardiology clinics. Between January 2014 and June 2015, a total of 76 consecutive patients were enrolled (38 patients with celiac disease and 38 control subjects). Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratio were measured from the 12-lead electrocardiogram. Tp-e interval (64.2Â±11.0 vs. 44.5Â±6.0; p<0.001), Tp-e/QT ratio (0.18Â±0.02 vs. 0.13Â±0.02; p<0.001) and Tp-e/QTc ratio (0.16Â±0.02 vs. 0.11Â±0.01; p<0.001) were significantly higher in patients with celiac disease than control subjects. There was a significant positive correlation between Tp-e/QTc ratio and disease duration in patients with celiac disease (r=0.480, p=0.003) and also there was a significant positive correlation between Tp-e/QTc ratio and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r=0.434, p<0.001). Our study showed that Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios were increased in patients with celiac disease. Whether these changes increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia deserve further studies. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U. and Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de Medicina Interna (SEMI).

Recently, it was shown that Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT, and Tp-e/QTc ratio can be novel indicators for prediction of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality. We aimed to investigate the association between AS and ventricular repolarization using Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio. Totally, 105 patients with AS and 60 control subjects were enrolled to this study. The severity of AS was defined by transthoracic echocardiographic examination. Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT, and Tp-e/QTc ratios were measured from the 12-lead electrocardiogram. Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT, and Tp-e/QTc ratios were significantly increased in parallel to the severity of AS (P < 0.001, P = 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively). Also, it was shown that Tp-e/QTc ratio had significant positive correlation with mean aortic gradient (r = 0.192, P = 0.049). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, Tp-e/QTc ratio and left ventricular mass were found to be independent predictors of severe AS (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04, respectively). Our study showed that Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT, and Tp-e/QTc ratios were increased in patients with severe AS. Tp-e/QTc ratio and left ventricular mass were found as independent predictors of severe AS.

Several studies have suggested that the interval from the peak to the end of the electrocardiographic T wave (Tp-e) may correspond to the transmural dispersion of repolarization and that increased Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio are associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to evaluate ventricular repolarization by using Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio in patients with AS, and to assess the relation with inflammation. Sixty-two patients with AS and 50 controls were included. Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were measured from a 12-lead electrocardiogram, and the Tp-e interval corrected for heart rate. The plasma level of high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured. These parameters were compared between groups. In electrocardiographic parameters analysis, QT dispersion (QTd) and corrected QTd were significantly increased in AS patients compared to the controls (31.7 Â± 9.6 vs 28.2 Â± 7.4 and 35.8 Â± 11.5 vs 30.6 Â± 7.9 ms, P = 0.03 and P = 0.007, respectively). cTp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were also significantly higher in AS patients (92.1 Â± 10.2 vs 75.8 Â± 8.4 and 0.22 Â± 0.02 vs 0.19 Â± 0.02 ms, all P values <0.001). cTp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were significantly correlated with hsCRP (r = 0.63, P < 0.001 and r = 0.49, P < 0.001, respectively).

Several studies have suggested that the interval from the peak to the end of the electrocardiographic T wave (Tp-Te) may correspond to the transmural dispersion of the repolarization and that increased Tp-Te interval and Tp-Te/QT ratio are associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ventricular repolarization by using Tp-Te interval and Tp-Te/QT ratio in patients with CSF. This study included 50 CSF patients (40 male, mean age 48.6Â±12.5 years) and 40 control individuals (23 male, mean age 47.8Â±12.5 years). Tp-Te interval and Tp-Te/QT ratio were measured from the 12-lead electrocardiogram. These parameters were compared in groups. Baseline characteristics of the study groups were comparable. In electrocardiographic parameters analysis, QT and corrected QT were similar in CSF patients compared to the controls (357Â±35.2 vs 362Â±38.0 milliseconds and 419Â±25.8 vs 430Â±44.2 milliseconds, all p value >0.05).

These canonical activities can be repressed by TP63 in normal stratifying epithelia to maintain proliferative capacity or drive proliferation of squamous cell carcinomas, where TP63 is frequently overexpressed/amplified. Here we use ChIP-sequencing, integrated with microarray analysis, to define the genome-wide interplay between TP53 and TP63 in response to genotoxic stress in normal cells. We reveal that TP53 and TP63 bind to overlapping, but distinct cistromes of sites through utilization of distinctive consensus motifs and that TP53 is constitutively bound to a number of sites. We demonstrate that cisplatin and adriamycin elicit distinct effects on TP53 and TP63 binding events, through which TP53 can induce or repress transcription of an extensive network of genes by direct binding and/or modulation of TP63 activity. Collectively, this results in a global TP53-dependent repression of cell cycle progression, mitosis and DNA damage repair concomitant with activation of anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic canonical target genes. Further analyses reveal that in the absence of genotoxic stress TP63 plays an important role in maintaining expression of DNA repair genes, loss of which results in defective repair.

The aim of this study was to evaluate ventricular repolarization by using the Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to assess the relation with inflammation. Ninety-six patients (72 females, 24 males; mean age 43.8Â±11.8 years) with RA and 50 controls (35 females, 15 males; mean age 44.2Â±11.1 years) were included. From the 12-lead electrocardiogram, Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were measured. Blood samples were taken for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). These parameters were compared between groups. The relationship between ventricular repolarization and inflammation was assessed by Pearson correlation coefficients. Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were increased in RA patients compared to the controls (72.6Â±8.2 vs 66.4Â±8.5 ms, 0.20Â±0.02 vs 0.18Â±0.02; p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). The Tp-e interval was significantly correlated with CRP, ESR, and disease activity score (DAS-28) (r=0.56, p<0.001, r=0.57, p<0.001, and r=0.29, p=0.02, respectively). The Tp-e/QT ratio was also correlated with CRP, ESR, and DAS-28 score (r=0.43, p<0.001, r=0.53, p<0.001, and r=0.25, p=0.03, respectively). In RA patients, the increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias may be explained by increased indexes of ventricular repolarization and their relationship with inflammation.\n\nEvaluation of Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio in patients with non-dipper hypertension.\n\nPubMed\n\nDemir, Mehmet; Uyan, Umut\n\n2014-01-01\n\nNon-dipper hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Several studies have suggested that the interval from the peak to the end of the electrocardiographic T wave (Tp-e) may correspond to the transmural dispersion of repolarization and that increased Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio are associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to evaluate ventricular repolarization by using Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio in patients with non-dipper hypertension. This study included 80 hypertensive patients. Hypertensive patients were divided into two groups: 50 dipper patients (29 male, mean age 51.5âÂ±â8 years) and 30 non-dipper patients (17 male, mean age 50.6âÂ±â5.4 years). Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were measured from the 12-lead electrocardiogram. These parameters were compared between groups. No statistically significant difference was found between two groups in terms of basic characteristics. In electrocardiographic parameters analysis, QT dispersion (QTd) and corrected QTd were significantly increased in non-dipper patients compared to the dippers (39.4âÂ±â11.5 versus 27.3âÂ±â7.5âms and 37.5âÂ±â9.5 versus 29.2âÂ±â6.5âms, pâ=â0.001 and pâ=â0.01, respectively).

We intended to evaluate the interval from the peak to the end of the electrocardiographic T wave (Tp-e), Tp-e/QTc ratio, and fQRS as presumed markers of arrhythmias in LC. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 88 consecutive patients with LC according to clinical, biological, ultrasonographic, or histological criteria and 73 control subjects were enrolled. The severity of cirrhosis was classified according to Pugh-Child's classification and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QTc ratio, and fQRS rates were measured from the 12-lead electrocardiogram. Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QTc ratio and fQRS rates were significantly increased in parallel to the severity of LC (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.003, respectively). In correlation analysis, Pugh-Child stage showed a significantly positive correlation with Tp-e interval (r = 0.462, P < 0.001), QTc interval (r = 0.373, P < 0.001), Tp-e/QTc ratio (r = 0.352, P < 0.001), and fQRS (r = 0.407, P < 0.001). Furthermore, Tp-e interval (r = 0.414, P < 0.001) and Tp-e/QTc ratio (r = 0.426, P< 0.001) had significant positive correlation with MELD score. Our study demonstrated that Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QTc ratios, and fQRS rates were significantly increased in parallel to the severity of LC. Thus, these findings may implicate that Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QTc ratio, and fQRS may be novel and useful indicators for prediction of arrhythmias in LC.

Mutagenâinduced or spontaneous TP53 mutagenesis can be studied in vitro using the human TP53 knockâin (Hupki) mouse embryo fibroblast (HUF) immortalisation assay (HIMA). TP53 mutations arise in up to 30% of mutagenâtreated, immortalised HUFs; however, mutants are not identified until TP53 sequence analysis following immortalisation (2â5 months) and much effort is expended maintaining TP53âWT cultures. In order to improve the selectivity of the HIMA for HUFs harbouring TP53 mutations, we explored the use of Nutlinâ3a, an MDM2 inhibitor that leads to stabilisation and activation of wildâtype (WT) p53. First, we treated previously established immortal HUF lines carrying WT or mutated TP53 with Nutlinâ3a to examine the effect on cell growth and p53 activation. Nutlinâ3a induced the p53 pathway in TP53âWT HUFs and inhibited cell growth, whereas most TP53âmutated HUFs were resistant to Nutlinâ3a. We then assessed whether Nutlinâ3a treatment could discriminate between TP53âWT and TP53âmutated cells during the HIMA (nâ=â72 cultures). As immortal clones emerged from senescent cultures, each was treated with 10 ÂµM Nutlinâ3a for 5 days and observed for sensitivity or resistance. TP53 was subsequently sequenced from all immortalised clones. We found that all Nutlinâ3aâresistant clones harboured TP53 mutations, which were diverse in position and functional impact, while all but one of the Nutlinâ3aâsensitive clones were TP53âWT. These data suggest that including a Nutlinâ3a counterâscreen significantly improves the specificity and efficiency of the HIMA, whereby TP53âmutated clones are selected prior to sequencing and TP53âWT clones can be discarded.

Our study explored the associations of TP53 mutations, gene expression, clinical outcomes, and TP53 interaction networks across 33 cancer types using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We show that TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in a number of cancers, and its mutations appear to be early events in cancer initiation. We identified genes potentially repressed by p53, and genes whose expression correlates significantly with TP53 expression. These gene products may be especially important nodes in p53 interaction networks in human cancers. This study shows that while TP53-truncating mutations often result in decreased TP53 expression, other non-truncating TP53 mutations result in increased TP53 expression in some cancers. Survival analyses in a number of cancers show that patients with TP53 mutations are more likely to have worse prognoses than TP53-wildtype patients, and that elevated TP53 expression often leads to poor clinical outcomes. We identified a set of candidate synthetic lethal (SL) genes for TP53, and validated some of these SL interactions using data from the Cancer Cell Line Project. These predicted SL genes are promising candidates for experimental validation and the development of personalized therapeutics for patients with TP53-mutated cancers.

Specifically, the tilapia piscidins are a group of peptides that possess antimicrobial, wound-healing, and antitumor functions. In this study, we focused on tilapia piscidin 3 (TP3) and TP4, which are peptides derived from Oreochromis niloticus, and investigated their inhibition of acute bacterial infections by infecting hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) with Vibrio vulnificus and evaluating the protective effects of pre-treating, co-treating, and post-treating fish with TP3 and TP4. In vivo experiments showed that co-treatment with V. vulnificus and TP3 (20 Î¼g/fish) or TP4 (20 Î¼g/fish) achieved 95.3% and 88.9% survival rates, respectively, after seven days. When we co-injected TP3 or TP4 and V. vulnificus into tilapia and then re-challenged the fish with V. vulnificus after 28 days, the tilapia exhibited survival rates of 35.6% and 42.2%, respectively. Pre-treatment with TP3 (30 Î¼g/fish) or TP4 (20 Î¼g/fish) for 30 minutes prior to V. vulnificus infection resulted in high survival rates of 28.9% and 37.8%, respectively, while post-treatment with TP3 (20 Î¼g/fish or 30 Î¼g/fish) or TP4 (20 Î¼g/fish) 30 minutes after V. vulnificus infection yielded high survival rates of 33.3% and 48.9%. In summary, pre-treating, co-treating, and post-treating fish with TP3 or TP4 all effectively decreased the number of V. vulnificus bacteria and promoted significantly lower mortality rates in tilapia. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of TP3 and TP4 that were effective for treating fish infected with V. vulnificus were 7.8 and 62.5 Î¼g/ml, respectively, whereas the MICs of kanamycin and ampicillin were 31.2 and 3.91 Î¼g/ml. The antimicrobial activity of these peptides was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), both of which showed\n\n7-Deazapurine containing DNA: efficiency of c7GdTP, c7AdTP and c7IdTP incorporation during PCR-amplification and protection from endodeoxyribonuclease hydrolysis.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSeela, F; RÃ¶ling, A\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe enzymatic synthesis of 7-deazapurine nucleoside containing DNA (501 bp) is performed by PCR-amplification (Taq polymerase) using a pUC18 plasmid DNA as template and the triphosphates of 7-deaza-2'-deoxyguanosine (c7Gd), -adenosine (c7Ad) and -inosine (c7Id). c7GdTP can fully replace dGTP resulting in a completely modified DNA-fragment of defined size and sequence. The other two 7-deazapurine triphosphates (c7AdTP) and (c7IdTP) require the presence of the parent purine 2'-deoxyribonucleotides. In purine/7-deazapurine nucleotide mixtures Taq polymerase prefers purine over 7-deazapurine nucleotides but accepts c7GdTP much better than c7AdTP or c7IdTP. As incorporation of 7-deazapurine nucleotides represents a modification of the major groove of DNA it can be used to probe DNA/protein interaction. Regioselective phosphodiester hydrolysis of the modified DNA-fragments was studied with 28 endodeoxyribonucleases. c7Gd is able to protect the DNA from the phosphodiester hydrolysis in more than 20 cases, only a few enzymes (Mae III, Rsa I, Hind III, Pvu II or Taq I) do still hydrolyze the modified DNA. c7Ad protects DNA less efficiently, as this DNA could only be modified in part. The absence of N-7 as potential binding position or a geometric distortion of the recognition duplex caused by the 7-deazapurine base can account for protection of hydrolysis.

Detection of deletion of TP53 locus (17p deletion) by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has become standard and performed prior to every line of treatment as the incidence dramatically increases as relapses occur. As monoallelic mutations of TP53 equally affect outcome, novel methods are being developed to improve detection of TP53 defects and include next-generation sequencing (NGS) and functional assays. TP53 defects highly affect outcome of immunochemotherapy but also alter response durations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although BCR-targeting agents and Bcl-2-inhibitos have achieved durable responses in some patients with TP53 defects, long-term follow-up is currently lacking. In this review biological and clinical consequences of TP53 dysfunction as well as applicability of currently available methods to detect TP53 defects are described. In addition, proposed novel therapeutic strategies specifically for patients with TP53 dysfunction are discussed. In summary, the only curative treatment option for TP53-defective CLL is still allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Other treatment strategies such as rationale combinations of agents with different (TP53 independent) targets, including kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic molecules but also immunomodulatory agents need to be further explored.

This study was to compare the short-term efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus DDP in treating locally advanced NPC. Fifty-seven patients with stage T3-4N2-3M0 NPC diagnosed pathologically from December 2005 to December 2006 were randomized into TP group (30 patients) and DDP group (27 patients). Both groups received TP regimen as induction chemotherapy with docetaxel (70 mg/m(2)) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m(2)) on Day 2, repeating every 21 days for 2 cycles. For concurrent chemotherapy, TP group were administered docetaxel (60 mg/m(2)) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m(2)) on Day 2; DDP group were administered DDP (80 mg/m(2)) on Day 1. Both schedules were repeated every 21 days for 2 cycles. Linear accelerator was used as radioactive source. Irradiation field was designed with CT-simulation and conventional fractions. The 57 patients received 111 cycles of induction chemotherapy, and 53 of them received 103 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy; four patients ceased induction chemotherapy and three ceased concurrent chemotherapy. All patients completed radiotherapy. The major toxicity of induction chemotherapy was hematologic toxicity; the main toxicities of concurrent chemoradiotherapy were hematologic toxicity and mucositis. The occurrence rates of Grade 3-4 leucopenia and Grade 3-4 neutropenia were significantly higher in TP group than in DDP groups (p <0.05). In concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the application rate of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly higher in TP group than in DDP group (100% vs. 72.0%, p<0.05). After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rates of the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes were 93.3% and 92.9% in TP group, and were 96.3% and 91.3% in DDP group (p>0.05).

To date, no studies have addressed the impact of TP53 mutations in prospective clinical trial cohorts. To evaluate the impact of TP53 mutation to current risk models in aggressive B-NHL, we investigated TP53 gene mutations within the RICOVER-60 trial. Of 1,222 elderly patients (aged 61-80 years) enrolled in the study and randomized to six or eight cycles of CHOP-14 with or without Rituximab (NCT00052936), 265 patients were analyzed for TP53 mutations. TP53 mutations were demonstrated in 63 of 265 patients (23.8%). TP53 mutation was associated with higher LDH (65% vs. 37%; pâ<â0.001), higher international prognostic index-Scores (IPI 4/5 27% vs. 12%; pâ=â0.025) and B-symptoms (41% vs. 24%; pâ=â0.011). Patients with TP53 mutation were less likely to obtain a complete remission CR/CRu (CR unconfirmed) 61.9% (mut) vs. 79.7% (wt) (pâ=â0.007). TP53 mutations were associated with decreased event-free (EFS), progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (median observation time of 40.2 months): the 3 year EFS, PFS and OS were 42% (vs. 60%; pâ=â0.012), 42% (vs. 67.5%; pâ<â0.001) and 50% (vs. 76%; pâ<â0.001) for the TP53 mutation group. In a Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusting for IPI-factors and treatment arms, TP53 mutation was shown to be an independent predictor of EFS (HR 1.5), PFS (HR 2.0) and OS (HR 2.3; pâ<â0.001). TP53 mutations are independent predictors of survival in untreated patients with aggressive CD20+ lymphoma. TP53 mutations should be considered for risk models in DLBCL and strategies to improve outcome for patients with mutant TP53 must be developed.

Here we have performed structure/function analyses of DOR guided by identification of conserved regions in the DOR gene family by phylogenetic reconstructions. We show that DOR is present in metazoan species. Invertebrates harbor only one gene, DOR/Tp53inp2, and in the common ancestor of vertebrates Tp53inp1 may have arisen by gene duplication. In keeping with these data, we show that human TP53INP1 regulates autophagy and that different DOR/TP53INP2 and TP53INP1 proteins display transcriptional activity. The use of molecular evolutionary information has been instrumental to determine the regions that participate in DOR functions. DOR and TP53INP1 proteins share two highly conserved regions (region 1, aa residues 28-42; region 2, 66-112 in human DOR). Mutation of conserved hydrophobic residues in region 1 of DOR (that are part of a nuclear export signal, NES) reduces transcriptional activity, and blocks nuclear exit and autophagic activity under autophagy-activated conditions. We also identify a functional and conserved LC3-interacting motif (LIR) in region 1 of DOR and TP53INP1 proteins. Mutation of conserved acidic residues in region 2 of DOR reduces transcriptional activity, impairs nuclear exit in response to autophagy activation, and disrupts autophagy. Taken together, our data reveal DOR and TP53INP1 as dual regulators of transcription and autophagy, and identify two conserved regions in the DOR family that concentrate multiple functions crucial for autophagy and transcription.\n\nDOR/Tp53inp2 and Tp53inp1 Constitute a Metazoan Gene Family Encoding Dual Regulators of Autophagy and Transcription\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSancho, Ana; Duran, Jordi; GarcÃ­a-EspaÃ±a, Antonio; Mauvezin, Caroline; Alemu, Endalkachew A.; Lamark, Trond; Macias, Maria J.; DeSalle, Rob; Royo, Miriam; Sala, David; Chicote, Javier U.; PalacÃ­n, Manuel; Johansen, Terje; Zorzano, Antonio\n\n2012-01-01\n\nHuman DOR/TP53INP2 displays a unique bifunctional role as a modulator of autophagy and gene transcription.

Despite intense efforts, to date, no other genes have been associated with the disorder in a significant number of TP53 mutation-negative families. A search for defects in TP53 other than heterozygous missense mutations showed that neither intron variants nor sequence variants in the TP53 promoter are frequent in LFS, and multiexon deletions have been found to be responsible for LFS only in several cases. Another cancer predisposition syndrome, hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, has been associated with epigenetic silencing of one allele of the MLH1 or MSH2 genes. This prompted us to test the methylation of the TP53 gene promoter in a set of 14 families suggestive of LFS using bisulphite sequencing of three DNA fragments from the 5' region of the gene. We found no detectable methylation at any of the CG dinucleotides tested. Thus, epigenetic silencing of the TP53 promoter is not a frequent cause of the disorder in families suggestive of LFS but with no germline mutations in the coding part of the gene.\n\nProlonged Tp-e Interval in Down Syndrome Patients with Congenitally Normal Hearts.\n\nPubMed\n\nKucuk, Mehmet; Karadeniz, Cem; Ozdemir, Rahmi; MeÅe, Timur\n\n2018-03-25\n\nHeterogeneity of ventricular repolarization has been assessed by using the QT dispersion in Down syndrome (DS) patients with congenitally normal hearts. However, novel repolarization indexes, the Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio, have not previously been evaluated in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio in DS patients without congenital heart defects. Twelve-lead surface electrocardiograms of 160 DS patients and 110 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were used to evaluate and compare the Tp-e interval, Tp-e dispersion, and Tp-e/QT ratio. Heart rate, Tp-e interval, Tp-e dispersion, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios were significantly higher in DS group than in the controls. Myocardial repolarization indexes in DS patients with congenitally normal hearts were found to be prolonged compared to those in normal controls. Further evaluation is warranted to reveal a relationship between prolonged repolarization indexes and arrhythmic events in these patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

The binding of lipopolysaccharide to Toll-like receptors causes phosphorylation of Cot/Tp12 to activate the MAPK cascade. Previous in vitro studies showed that Cot/Tp12 was essential for the induction of RANKL expression by lipopolysaccharide. In this study, we examined whether Cot/Tp12 deficiency reduced the progression of alveolar bone loss and osteoclastogenesis during experimental periodontitis. We found that the extent of alveolar bone loss and osteoclastogenesis induced by ligature-induced periodontitis was decreased in Cot/Tp12-deficient mice. In addition, reduction of RANKL expression was observed in periodontal tissues of Cot/Tp12-deficient mice with experimental periodontitis. Furthermore, we found that Cot/Tp12 was involved in the induction of TNF-alpha mRNA expression in gingiva of mice with experimental periodontitis. Our observations suggested that Cot/Tp12 is essential for the progression of alveolar bone loss and osteoclastogenesis in periodontal tissue during experimental periodontitis mediated through increased RANKL expression.\n\nElectron heating and Tp/Te variations during magnetic dipolarizations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrigorenko, Elena; Kronberg, Elena; Daly, Patrick; Ganushkina, Natalia; Lavraud, Benoit; Sauvaud, Jean-Andre; Zelenyi, Lev\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe proton-to-electron temperature ratio (Tp/Te) in the plasma sheet (PS) of the Earth's magnetotail is studied by using 5 years of Cluster observations (2001-2005). The PS intervals are searched within a region defined with -19Tp/Te varies over a wide range from a few units to several tens of units. In 86 PS intervals the Tp/Te decreases below 3.5. In the majority of these intervals the Tp/Te drops are observed during magnetotail dipolarizations. A superposed epoch analysis applied to these events shows that the minimum value of Tp/Te is observed after the dipolarization onset during the \"turbulent phase\" of dipolarization, when a number of transient Bz pulses are reduced, but the value of Bz field is still large and an intensification of wave activity is observed. The Tp/Te drops and associated increases of Te often coincide either with bursts of broadband electrostatic emissions, which may include electron cyclotron harmonics, or with broadband electromagnetic emission in a frequency range from proton plasma frequency (fpp) up to the electron gyrofrequency (fce). These findings show that the wave activity developing in the current sheet after dipolarization onset may play a role in the additional electron heating and the associated Tp/Te decrease.

These remarkably soluble BPTI derivatives show strong optical absorption in the range of Î»=300-500â nm and have a high triplet-state energy of 1.67â eV. A cyanophenyl substituent renders BPTI such a strong electron acceptor (Ered =-0.11â V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode) that electron-trapping reactions with O2 and H2 O do not occur. The BPTI radical anion on a fluorine-doped tin oxide|TiO2 electrode is persistent up to tens of seconds (t1/2 =39â s) in air-saturated buffer solution. As a result of favorable packing, theoretical electron mobilities (10(-2) â¼10(-1)â cm(2)âV(-1) s(-1)) are high and similar to the experimental values observed for perylene diimide and C60 derivatives. Our studies show the potential of the cyanophenyl-modified BPTI compounds as electron acceptors in devices for artificial photosynthesis in water splitting that are also very promising nonfullerene electron-transport materials for organic solar cells.

Thus, TP53-linked cell death appears exacerbated in several age-related neuropathologies, while TP53 mutation-associated phenotypes indicate a loss of function accounting for approximately half of cancers. Thus, TP53 plays a pivotal role in these phenotypically distinct pathologies, a hypothesis reinforced by recent epidemiological studies suggesting an opposite risk to develop one type of pathology relative to the other. Dysfunctions in mitophagic processes also occur in both types of pathologies and again, TP53 has been proposed as one of the regulators of this cellular process. The consensus view postulates that TP53 exerts both anti- and pro-autophagy functions that are directly driven by a specific subcellular localization. Thus, TP53 positively modulates autophagy via the transcriptional control of several genes while it is acknowledged that its anti-autophagy phenotype is exclusively linked to a transcription-independent cytosolic control of an AMPK-MTOR cascade. Our study indicates that TP53 can also downregulate the specialized autophagy-related mitophagy response via the transcriptional repression of PINK1. This is the first demonstration of an anti-mitophagic control by nuclear TP53.\n\nRITA displays anti-tumor activity in medulloblastomas independent of TP53 status.\n\nPubMed\n\nGottlieb, Aline; Althoff, Kristina; Grunewald, Laura; Thor, Theresa; Odersky, Andrea; Schulte, Marc; Deubzer, Hedwig E; Heukamp, Lukas; Eggert, Angelika; Schramm, Alexander; Schulte, Johannes H; KÃ¼nkele, Annette\n\n2017-04-25\n\nCurrent therapy of medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood, achieves 40-70% survival. Secondary chemotherapy resistance contributes to treatment failure, where TP53 pathway dysfunction plays a key role. MDM2 interaction with TP53 leads to its degradation. Reactivating TP53 functionality using small-molecule inhibitors, such as RITA, to disrupt TP53-MDM2 binding may have therapeutic potential. We show here that RITA decreased viability of all 4 analyzed medulloblastoma cell lines, regardless of TP53 functional status. The decrease in cell viability was accompanied in 3 of the 4 medulloblastoma cell lines by accumulation of TP53 protein in the cells and increased CDKN1A expression. RITA treatment in mouse models inhibited medulloblastoma xenograft tumor growth. These data demonstrate that RITA treatment reduces medulloblastoma cell viability in both in vitro and in vivo models, and acts independently of cellular TP53 status, identifying RITA as a potential therapeutic agent to treat medulloblastoma.\n\nRITA displays anti-tumor activity in medulloblastomas independent of TP53 status\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGottlieb, Aline; Althoff, Kristina; Grunewald, Laura; Thor, Theresa; Odersky, Andrea; Schulte, Marc; Deubzer, Hedwig E.; Heukamp, Lukas; Eggert, Angelika; Schramm, Alexander; Schulte, Johannes H.; KÃ¼nkele, Annette\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCurrent therapy of medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood, achieves 40â70% survival. Secondary chemotherapy resistance contributes to treatment failure, where TP53 pathway dysfunction plays a key role. MDM2 interaction with TP53 leads to its degradation. Reactivating TP53 functionality using small-molecule inhibitors, such as RITA, to disrupt TP53-MDM2 binding may have therapeutic potential. We show here that RITA decreased viability of all 4 analyzed medulloblastoma cell lines, regardless of TP53 functional status. The decrease in cell viability was accompanied in 3 of the 4 medulloblastoma cell lines by accumulation of TP53 protein in the cells and increased CDKN1A expression.

We hypothesized that WNT activation which is associated with improved survival for such children abrogates TP53 related radioresistance and can be used to sensitize TP53 mutant tumors for radiation. We examined the subgroup-specific role of TP53 mutations in a cohort of 314 patients treated with radiation. TP53 wild-type or mutant human medulloblastoma cell-lines and normal neural stem cells were used to test radioresistance of TP53 mutations and the radiosensitizing effect of WNT activation on tumors and the developing brain. Children with WNT/TP53 mutant medulloblastoma had higher 5-year survival than those with SHH/TP53 mutant tumours (100% and 36.6%Â±8.7%, respectively (p<0.001)). Introduction of TP53 mutation into medulloblastoma cells induced radioresistance (survival fractions at 2Gy (SF2) of 89%Â±2% vs. 57.4%Â±1.8% (p<0.01)). In contrast, Î²-catenin mutation sensitized TP53 mutant cells to radiation (p<0.05). Lithium, an activator of the WNT pathway, sensitized TP53 mutant medulloblastoma to radiation (SF2 of 43.5%Â±1.5% in lithium treated cells vs. 56.6Â±3% (p<0.01)) accompanied by increased number of Î³H2AX foci. Normal neural stem cells were protected from lithium induced radiation damage (SF2 of 33%Â±8% for lithium treated cells vs. 27%Â±3% for untreated controls (p=0.05). Poor survival of patients with TP53 mutant medulloblastoma may be related to radiation resistance. Since constitutive activation of the WNT pathway by lithium sensitizes TP53 mutant medulloblastoma cells and protect normal neural stem cells from radiation, this oral drug may represent an attractive novel therapy for high-risk medulloblastomas.\n\nCrystal structure of thermostable p-nitrophenylphosphatase from Bacillus Stearothermophilus (Bs-TpNPPase).\n\nPubMed\n\nGuo, Zheng; Wang, Fengbin; Shen, Tiantian; Huang, Jing; Wang, Yuandong; Ji, Chaoneng\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThermostable p-nitrophenylphosphatase from Bacillus Stearothermophilus (Bs-TpNPPase) is involved in the Mg(2+)-dependent hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme at an optimum reaction temperature of 55Â°C. Bs-TpNPPase has been cloned and overexpressed in the E.coli M15 strain. Based on the conserved active sites, the protein was suggested to be a member of the haloalkanoate dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. Two site-specific point mutants of Bs-TpNPPase were prepared by changing the catalytic Asp10 and Thr43 to Ala10 and Ala43, respectively. The activity of the two mutants further confirms Bs-TpNPPase as a member of the HAD superfamily. HAD superfamily can be divided into the four subfamilies and play several biochemical roles such as DNA repair, signal transduction and secondary metabolism. To understand the relationship between structure and thermostability in HAD superfamily, Bs-TpNPPase from Bacillus Stearothermophilus was selected. The X-ray crystal structure of Bs-TpNPPase was determined at 1.5A resolution using the molecular replacement phasing method. The structure of Bs-TpNPPase has been deposited and the PDB code is 4KN8. Compared with Bsp, a mesophilic prokaryotic putative p-nitrophenyl phosphatase from Bacillus Subtilis, Bs- TpNPPase showed highly homology but variations in the level of leucine content, aromatic clusters, cation-Pi and hydrophobic interaction. These differences may affect the thermal stability of the protein. The crystal structure of Bs-TpNPPase described herein may serve as a guide to better understand the mechanism of thermostability and provide insights for further mutation work.\n\nCharacterizing genomic differences of human cancer stratified by the TP53 mutation status.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Mengyao; Yang, Chao; Zhang, Xiuqing; Li, Xiangchun\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe key roles of the TP53 mutation in cancer have been well established. TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene, and its inactivation is widespread among human cancer types. However, the landscape of genomic alterations in human cancers stratified by the TP53 mutation has not yet been described. We obtained somatic mutation and copy number change data of 6551 regular-mutated samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compared significantly mutated genes (SMGs), copy number alterations, mutational signatures and mutational strand asymmetries between cancer samples with and without the TP53 mutation. We identified 126 SMGs, 30 of which were statistically significant in both the TP53 mutant and wild-type groups. Several SMGs, such as VHL, SMAD4 and PTEN, showed a mutation bias towards the TP53 wild-type group, whereas ATRX, IDH1 and RB1 were more prevalent in the TP53 mutant group. Five mutational signatures were extracted from the combined TCGA dataset on which mutational asymmetry analysis was performed, revealing that the TP53 mutant group exhibited substantially greater replication and transcription biases. Furthermore, we found that alterations of multiple genes in a merged mutually exclusive network composed of BRAF, EGFR, PAK1, PIK3CA, PTEN, APC and TERT were related to shortened survival in the TP53 wild-type group. In summary, we characterized the genomic differences and similarities underlying human cancers stratified by the TP53 mutation and identified multi-gene alterations of a merged mutually exclusive network to be a poor prognostic factor for the TP53 wild-type group.\n\n[Evaluation of the Performance of Two Kinds of Anti-TP Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay].\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Nan; Huang, Li-Qin; Wang, Rui; Jia, Jun-Jie; Wu, Shuo; Zhang, Jing; Ge, Hong-Wei\n\n2018-06-01\n\nTo evaluate the accuracy and precision of 2 kinds of anti-treponema pallidum (anti-TP) ELISA reagents in our laboratory for detecting the anti-TP in voluntary blood donors, so as to provide the data support for use of ELISA reagents after introduction of chemiluminescene immunoassay (CLIA). The route detection of anti-TP was performed by using 2 kinds of ELISA reagents, then 546 responsive positive samples detected by anti-TP ELISA were collected, and the infections status of samples confirmed by treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test was identified. The confirmed results of responsive samples detected by 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA reagents were compared, the accuracy of 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA reagents was analyzed by drawing ROC and comparing area under curve (AUC), and precision of 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA reagents was compared by statistical analysis of quality control data from 7.1 2016 to 6.30 2017. There were no statistical difference in confirmed positive rate of responsive samples and weak positive samples between 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA reagents. The responsive samples detected by 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA reagents accounted for 85.53%(467/546) of all responsive samples, the positive rate confirmed by TPPA test was 82.87%. 44 responsive samples detected by anti-TP ELISA reagent A and 35 responsive samples detected by anti-TP ELISA reagent B were confirmed to be negative by TPPA test. Comparison of AUC showed that the accuracy of 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA reagents was more high, the difference between 2 reagents was not statistically significant. The coefficient of variation (CV) of anti-TP ELISA reagent A and B was 14.98% and 18.04% respectively, which met the precision requirement of ELISA test. The accuracy and precision of 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA reagents used in our laboratory are similar, and using any one of anti-TP ELISA reagents all can satisfy the requirements of blood screening.\n\nSteric and electronic effects on arylthiolate coordination in the pseudotetrahedral complexes [(Tp(Ph,Me))Ni-SAr] (Tp(Ph,Me) = hydrotris{3-phenyl-5-methyl-1-pyrazolyl}borate).\n\nPubMed\n\nDeb, Tapash; Anderson, Caitlin M; Chattopadhyay, Swarup; Ma, Huaibo; Young, Victor G; Jensen, Michael P\n\n2014-12-14\n\nSynthesis and characterization of several new pseudotetrahedral arylthiolate complexes [(Tp(Ph,Me))Ni-SAr] (Tp(Ph,Me) = hydrotris{3-phenyl-5-methyl-1-pyrazolyl}borate; Ar = Ph, 2,4,6-(i)Pr3C6H2, C6H4-4-Cl, C6H4-4-Me, C6H4-4-OMe) are reported, including X-ray crystal structures of the first two complexes. With prior results, two series of complexes are spanned, [(Tp(Ph,Me))Ni-S-2,4,6-RC6H2] (R'' = H, Me, (i)Pr) plus the xylyl analogue [(Tp(Ph,Me))Ni-S-2,6-Me2C6H3], as well as [(Tp(Ph,Me))Ni-S-C6H4-4-Y] (Y = Cl, H, Me, OMe), intended to elucidate steric and/or electronic effects on arylthiolate coordination. In contrast to [(Tp(Me,Me))Ni-SAr] analogues that adopt a sawhorse conformation, the ortho-disubstituted complexes show enhanced trigonal and Ni-S-Ar bending, reflecting the size of the 3-pyrazole substituents. Moreover, weakened scorpionate ligation is implied by spectroscopic data. Little spectroscopic effect is observed in the series of para-substituted complexes, suggesting the observed effects are primarily steric in origin. The relatively electron-rich and encumbered complex [(Tp(Ph,Me))Ni-S-2,4,6-(i)Pr3C6H2] behaves uniquely when dissolved in CH3CN, forming a square planar solvent adduct with a bidentate scorpionate ligand, [(Îº(2)-Tp(Ph,Me))Ni(NCMe)(S-2,4,6-(i)Pr3C6H2)]. This adduct was isolated and characterized by X-ray crystallography. Single-point DFT and TD-DFT calculations on a simplified [(Îº(2)-Tp)Ni(NCMe)(SPh)] model were used to clarify the electronic spectrum of the adduct, and to elucidate differences between Ni-SAr bonding and spectroscopy between pseudotetrahedral and square planar geometries.\n\nTP53 mutation-correlated genes predict the risk of tumor relapse and identify MPS1 as a potential therapeutic kinase in TP53-mutated breast cancers.\n\nPubMed\n\nGyÅrffy, BalÃ¡zs; Bottai, Giulia; Lehmann-Che, Jacqueline; KÃ©ri, GyÃ¶rgy; Orfi, LÃ¡szlÃ³; Iwamoto, Takayuki; Desmedt, Christine; Bianchini, Giampaolo; Turner, Nicholas C; de ThÃ¨, Hugues; AndrÃ©, Fabrice; Sotiriou, Christos; Hortobagyi, Gabriel N; Di Leo, Angelo; Pusztai, Lajos; Santarpia, Libero\n\n2014-05-01\n\nBreast cancers (BC) carry a complex set of gene mutations that can influence their gene expression and clinical behavior. We aimed to identify genes driven by the TP53 mutation status and assess their clinical relevance in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative BC, and their potential as targets for patients with TP53 mutated tumors. Separate ROC analyses of each gene expression according to TP53 mutation status were performed. The prognostic value of genes with the highest AUC were assessed in a large dataset of untreated, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy treated patients. The mitotic checkpoint gene MPS1 was the most significant gene correlated with TP53 status, and the most significant prognostic marker in all ER-positive BC datasets. MPS1 retained its prognostic value independently from the type of treatment administered. The biological functions of MPS1 were investigated in different BC cell lines. We also assessed the effects of a potent small molecule inhibitor of MPS1, SP600125, alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Consistent with the gene expression profiling and siRNA assays, the inhibition of MPS1 by SP600125 led to a reduction in cell viability and a significant increase in cell death, selectively in TP53-mutated BC cells. Furthermore, the chemical inhibition of MPS1 sensitized BC cells to conventional chemotherapy, particularly taxanes. Our results collectively demonstrate that TP53-correlated kinase MPS1, is a potential therapeutic target in BC patients with TP53 mutated tumors, and that SP600125 warrant further development in future clinical trials.

The etiology of HPV-negative cancers is unclear, but TP53 mutations have been implicated. Archival tissues of 108 invasive squamous cell carcinoma from a single pathology institution in a low-incidence area were analyzed for HPV-DNA and p16 ink4a overexpression and for TP53 mutations by ion torrent next-generation sequencing. Library preparation failed in 32/108 squamous cell carcinomas. Institutional review board approval was obtained. Thirty of 76 squamous cell carcinomas (43%; average 63 years) were HPV-negative with 8/33 squamous cell carcinomas being TP53 wild-type (24%; average 63 years). Twenty-five of 33 squamous cell carcinomas (76%; average 65 years) showed 32 different somatic TP53 mutations (23 missense mutations in exons 5-8, 6 nonsense, 1 frameshift and 2 splice-site mutations). Several hotspot mutations were detected multiple times (R175H, R248, R282, and R273). Eighteen of 19 squamous cell carcinomas with TP53 expression in immunohistochemistry had TP53 mutations. Fifty percent of TP53-negative squamous cell carcinomas showed mostly truncating loss-of-function TP53 mutations. Patients without mutations had longer survival (5 years: 86% vs 61%; 10 years: 60% vs 22%), but valid clinically relevant conclusions cannot be drawn due to different tumor stages and heterogeneous treatment of the cases presented in this study. Somatic TP53 mutations are a common feature in HPV-negative penile squamous cell carcinomas and offer an explanation for HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis. About half of HPV-negative penile cancers are driven by oncogenic activation of TP53, while a quarter is induced by loss of TP53 tumor suppressor function. Detection of TP53 mutations should be carried out by sequencing, as immunohistochemical TP53 staining could not identify all squamous cell carcinomas with TP53 mutations.\n\nGlucagon-Secreting Alpha Cell Selective Two-Photon Fluorescent Probe TP-Î±: For Live Pancreatic Islet Imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgrawalla, Bikram Keshari; Chandran, Yogeswari; Phue, Wut-Hmone; Lee, Sung-Chan; Jeong, Yun-Mi; Wan, Si Yan Diana; Kang, Nam-Young; Chang, Young-Tae\n\n2015-04-29\n\nTwo-photon (TP) microscopy has an advantage for live tissue imaging which allows a deeper tissue penetration up to 1 mm comparing to one-photon (OP) microscopy. While there are several OP fluorescence probes in use for pancreatic islet imaging, TP imaging of selective cells in live islet still remains a challenge. Herein, we report the discovery of first TP live pancreatic islet imaging probe; TP-Î± (Two Photon-alpha) which can selectively stain glucagon secreting alpha cells. Through fluorescent image based screening using three pancreatic cell lines, we discovered TP-Î± from a TP fluorescent dye library TPG (TP-Green). In vitro fluorescence test showed that TP-Î± have direct interaction and appear glucagon with a significant fluorescence increase, but not with insulin or other hormones/analytes. Finally, TP-Î± was successfully applied for 3D imaging of live islets by staining alpha cell directly. The newly developed TP-Î± can be a practical tool to evaluate and identify live alpha cells in terms of localization, distribution and availability in the intact islets.\n\nMononuclear Sulfido-Tungsten(V) Complexes: Completing the Tp*MEXY (M = Mo, W; E = O, S) Series.\n\nPubMed\n\nSproules, Stephen; Eagle, Aston A; George, Graham N; White, Jonathan M; Young, Charles G\n\n2017-05-01\n\nOrange Tp*WSCl 2 has been synthesized from the reactions of Tp*WOCl 2 with boron sulfide in refluxing toluene or Tp*WS 2 Cl with PPh 3 in dichloromethane at room temperature. Mononuclear sulfido-tungsten(V) complexes, Tp*WSXY {X = Y = Cl, OPh, SPh, SePh; X = Cl, Y = OPh; XY = toluene-3,4-dithiolate (tdt), quinoxaline-2,3-dithiolate (qdt); and Tp* = hydrotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)borate} were prepared by metathesis of Tp*WSCl 2 with the respective alkali metal salt of X - /XY 2- , or [NHEt 3 ] 2 (qdt). The complexes were characterized by microanalysis, mass spectrometry, electrochemistry, and infrared (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electronic absorption spectroscopies. The molecular structures of Tp*WS(OPh) 2 , Tp*WS(SePh) 2 , and Tp*WS(tdt) have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The six-coordinate, distorted-octahedral W centers are coordinated by terminal sulfido (Wâ¡S = 2.128(2) - 2.161(1) Ã ), terdentate facial Tp*, and monodentate/bidentate O/S/Se-donor ligands. The sulfido-W(V) complexes are characterized by lower energy electronic transitions, smaller g iso , and larger A iso ( 183 W) values, and more positive reduction potentials compared with their oxo-W(V) counterparts. This series has been probed by sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), the spectra being assigned by comparison to Tp*WOXY (X = Y = SPh; XY = tdt, qdt) and time-dependent density functional theoretical (TD-DFT) calculations. This study provides insight into the electronic nature and chemistry of the catalytically and biologically important sulfido-W unit.\n\nTLR4 has a TP53-dependent dual role in regulating breast cancer cell growth\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHaricharan, Svasti; Brown, Powel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBreast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death, and it is important to understand pathways that drive the disease to devise effective therapeutic strategies. Our results show that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) drives breast cancer cell growth differentially based on the presence of TP53, a tumor suppressor. TP53 is mutationally inactivated in most types of cancer and is mutated in 30â50% of diagnosed breast tumors. We demonstrate that TLR4 activation inhibits growth of TP53 wild-type cells, but promotes growth of TP53 mutant breast cancer cells by regulating proliferation. This differential effect is mediated by changes in tumor cell cytokine secretion. Whereas TLR4 activation in TP53 mutant breast cancer cells increases secretion of progrowth cytokines, TLR4 activation in TP53 wild-type breast cancer cells increases type I IFN (IFN-Î³) secretion, which is both necessary and sufficient for mediating TLR4-induced growth inhibition. This study identifies a novel dichotomous role for TLR4 as a growth regulator and a modulator of tumor microenvironment in breast tumors. These results have translational relevance, demonstrating that TP53 mutant breast tumor growth can be suppressed by pharmacologic TLR4 inhibition, whereas TLR4 inhibitors may in fact promote growth of TP53 wild-type tumors. Furthermore, using data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium, we demonstrate that the effect of TP53 mutational status on TLR4 activity may extend to ovarian, colon, and lung cancers, among others, suggesting that the viability of TLR4 as a therapeutic target depends on TP53 status in many different tumor types.

We utilized a two-stage SNP association study to detect variants associated with breast cancer survival in a TP53-dependent manner. Initially, a genome-wide study (n = 575 cases) was conducted to discover candidate SNPs for genotyping and validation in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The SNPs were then tested for interaction with tumor TP53 status (n = 4,610) and anthracycline treatment (n = 17,828). For SNPs interacting with anthracycline treatment, siRNA knockdown experiments were carried out to validate candidate genes. In the test for interaction between SNP genotype and TP53 status, we identified one locus, represented by rs10916264 (p(interaction) = 3.44 05E010-5; FDR-adjusted p = 0.0011) in estrogen receptor (ER) positive cases. The rs10916264 AA genotype associated with worse survival among cases with ER-positive, TP53-positive tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 2.36, 95% confidence interval [C.I] 1.45 - 3.82). This is a cis-eQTL locus for FBXO28 and TP53BP2; expression levels of these genes were associated with patient survival specifically in ER-positive, TP53-mutated tumors. Additionally, the SNP rs798755 was associated with survival in interaction with anthracycline treatment (p(interaction) = 9.57 05E010-5, FDR-adjusted p = 0.0130). RNAi-based depletion of a predicted regulatory target gene, FAM53A, indicated that this gene can modulate doxorubicin sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines. If confirmed in independent data sets, these results may be of clinical relevance in the development of prognostic and predictive marker panels for breast cancer. PMID:28179588\n\nInterrelationship between TP53 gene deletion, protein expression and chromosome 17 aneusomy in gastric adenocarcinoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground This study evaluates the existence of numerical alterations of chromosome 17 and TP53 gene deletion in gastric adenocarcinoma. The p53 protein expression was also evaluated, as well as, possible associations with clinicopathological characteristics. Methods Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunostaining were performed in twenty gastric cancer samples of individuals from Northern Brazil. Results Deletion of TP53 was found in all samples. TP53 was inactivated mainly by single allelic deletion, varying to 7â39% of cells/case. Aneusomy of chromosome 17 was observed in 85% of cases. Chromosome 17 monosomy and gain were both observed in about half of cases. Cells with gain of chromosome 17 frequently presented TP53 deletion. The frequency of cells with two chr17 and one TP53 signals observed was higher in diffuse than in intestinal-type GC. Immunoreactivity of p53 was found only in intestinal-type samples. The frequency of cells with two chr17 and two TP53 signals found was higher in samples with positive p53 expression than in negative cases in intestinal-type GC. Conclusion We suggest that TP53 deletion and chromosome 17 aneusomy is a common event in GC and other TP53 alterations, as mutation, may be implicated in the distinct carcinogenesis process of diffuse and intestinal types.

In this study, we investigated the effects of rTp0965 on the endothelial barrier. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with rTp0965 resulted in increased levels of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and MCP-1 mRNA and protein expression. These increases contributed to the adhesion and chemataxis of monocytes (THP-1 cells) to HUVECs preincubated with rTp0965. In addition, rTp0965 induced reorganization of F-actin and decreased expression of claudin-1 in HUVECs. Interestingly, inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK signal pathway protected against rTp0965-induced higher endothelial permeability as well as transendothelial migration of monocytes. These data indicate that Tp0965 protein may play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of syphilis.

The association studies were identified from PubMed, and eligible reports were included. RevMan 5.3.1 software, Oncolnc, cBioPortal, and Oncomine online tools were used for statistical analysis. A random/fixed effects model was used in meta-analysis. The data were reported as risk ratios or mean differences with corresponding 95% CI. We confirmed that TP53 was associated with colorectal cancer, the alteration frequency of TP53 was 53% mutation and 7% deep deletion, and TP53 mRNA expression was different in different types of colorectal cancer based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Then, 18 studies were included that examine the association of TP53 codon 72 gene polymorphism with colorectal cancer risk in Asians. The meta-analysis indicated that TP53 Pro allele and Pro/Pro genotype were associated with colorectal cancer risk in Asian population, but Arg/Arg genotype was not (Pro allele: odds ratios [OR]=1.20, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.35, P =0.003; Pro/Pro genotype: OR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.69, P =0.0007; Arg/Arg genotype: OR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.00, P =0.05). Interestingly, in the meta-analysis of the controls from the population-based studies, we found that TP53 codon 72 Pro/Arg gene polymorphism was associated with colorectal cancer risk (Pro allele: OR=1.33, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.55, P =0.0002; Pro/Pro genotype: OR=1.61, 95% CI: 1.28 to 2.02, P <0.0001; Arg/Arg genotype: OR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.93, P =0.009). TP53 was associated with colorectal cancer, but the different value levels of mRNA expression were not associated with survival rate of colon and rectal cancer. TP53 Pro allele and Pro/Pro genotype were associated with colorectal cancer risk in Asians.\n\nAssociation of mRNA expression of TP53 and the TP53 codon 72 Arg/Pro gene polymorphism with colorectal cancer risk in Asian population: a bioinformatics analysis and meta-analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Weimin; Wang, Cunchuan\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground The relationship between TP53 codon 72 Pro/Arg gene polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk in Asians is still controversial, and this bioinformatics analysis and meta-analysis was performed to assess the associations. Methods The association studies were identified from PubMed, and eligible reports were included. RevMan 5.3.1 software, Oncolnc, cBioPortal, and Oncomine online tools were used for statistical analysis. A random/fixed effects model was used in meta-analysis. The data were reported as risk ratios or mean differences with corresponding 95% CI. Results We confirmed that TP53 was associated with colorectal cancer, the alteration frequency of TP53 was 53% mutation and 7% deep deletion, and TP53 mRNA expression was different in different types of colorectal cancer based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective analysis of pretreatment tumor TP53, HPV, Bcl-xL and cyclin D1 status in stage III and IV larynx cancer patients in a clinical trial. METHODS TP53 exons 4-9 from 58 tumors were sequenced. Mutations were grouped using three classifications based on their expected function. Each functional group was analyzed for response to induction chemotherapy, time to surgery, survival, HPV status, p16INK4a, Bcl-xl and cyclin D1 expression. RESULTS TP53 Mutations were found in 22/58 (37.9%) patients with advanced larynx cancer, including missense mutations in 13/58 (22.4%) patients, nonsense mutations in 4/58 (6.9%), and deletions in 5/58 (8.6%). High risk HPV was found in 20/52 (38.5%) tumors. A classification based on crystal Evolutionary Action score of p53 (EAp53) distinguished missense mutations with high risk for decreased survival from low risk mutations (p=0.0315). A model including this TP53 classification, HPV status, cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL staining significantly predicts survival (p=0.0017). CONCLUSION EAp53 functional classification of TP53 mutants and biomarkers predict survival in advanced larynx cancer.

To characterize the mutational landscape of treatment-induced sarcomas and to identify candidate SMN-predisposing variants we analyzed germline and SMN samples from pediatric cancer survivors. Experimental Design We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on radiation-induced sarcomas arising from two pediatric cancer survivors. To assess the frequency of germline TP53 variants in SMNs, Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze germline TP53 in thirty-seven pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) without history of a familial cancer predisposition syndrome but known to have developed SMNs. Results WES revealed TP53 mutations involving p53âs DNA binding domain in both index cases, one of which was also present in the germline. The germline and somatic TP53 mutant variants were enriched in the transcriptomes for both sarcomas. Analysis of TP53 coding exons in germline specimens from the CCSS survivor cohort identified a G215C variant encoding an R72P amino acid substitution in six patients and a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism A639G in four others, resulting in ten out of 37 evaluable patients (27%) harboring a germline TP53 variant. Conclusions Currently, germline TP53 is not routinely assessed in pediatric cancer patients. These data support the concept that identifying germline TP53 variants at the time a primary cancer is diagnosed may identify patients at high risk for SMN development, who could benefit from modified therapeutic strategies and/or intensive post-treatment monitoring.

This technique has awaited the advent of a suitable mid-infrared (2.9 microns) laser source. Turnable mid-IR lasers now exist that are capable of meeting the specifications required of a high sensitivity TP/LIF OH sensor.\n\nCrystal growth of triphenylphosphine oxide 4-nitrophenol (TP4N) for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPandian, Muthu Senthil; Karuppasamy, P.; Kamalesh, T.; Ramasamy, P.; Verma, Sunil\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe optically good quality organic single crystals of triphenylphosphine oxide 4-nitrophenol (TP4N) were successfully grown by slow evaporation solution technique (SEST) using methanol as solvent. The lattice parameters of the grown crystal were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The optical transmittance, cut-off wavelength and band gap of the TP4N crystal were obtained by UV-Vis NIR spectrum analysis. The photoluminescence studies were carried out to find out the luminesce properties of TP4N single crystal. The photoconductivity studies reveal that the TP4N crystal has negative photoconductive nature. The third order nonlinear susceptibility (Ï(3)) of TP4N crystal was evaluated using the Z-scan technique at 640 nm.\n\nOptimized p53 immunohistochemistry is an accurate predictor of TP53 mutation in ovarian carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¶bel, Martin; Piskorz, Anna M; Lee, Sandra; Lui, Shuhong; LePage, Cecile; Marass, Francesco; Rosenfeld, Nitzan; Mes Masson, Anne-Marie; Brenton, James D\n\n2016-10-01\n\nTP53 mutations are ubiquitous in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC), and the presence of TP53 mutation discriminates between high and low-grade serous carcinomas and is now an important biomarker for clinical trials targeting mutant p53. p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is widely used as a surrogate for TP53 mutation but its accuracy has not been established. The objective of this study was to test whether improved methods for p53 IHC could reliably predict TP53 mutations independently identified by next generation sequencing (NGS). Four clinical p53 IHC assays and tagged-amplicon NGS for TP53 were performed on 171 HGSOC and 80 endometrioid carcinomas (EC). p53 expression was scored as overexpression (OE), complete absence (CA), cytoplasmic (CY) or wild type (WT). p53 IHC was evaluated as a binary classifier where any abnormal staining predicted deleterious TP53 mutation and as a ternary classifier where OE, CA or WT staining predicted gain-of-function (GOF or nonsynonymous), loss-of-function (LOF including stopgain, indel, splicing) or no detectable TP53 mutations (NDM), respectively. Deleterious TP53 mutations were detected in 169/171 (99%) HGSOC and 7/80 (8.8%) EC. The overall accuracy for the best performing IHC assay for binary and ternary prediction was 0.94 and 0.91 respectively, which improved to 0.97 (sensitivity 0.96, specificity 1.00) and 0.95 after secondary analysis of discordant cases. The sensitivity for predicting LOF mutations was lower at 0.76 because p53 IHC detected mutant p53 protein in 13 HGSOC with LOF mutations. CY staining associated with LOF was seen in 4 (2.3%) of HGSOC. Optimized p53 IHC can approach 100% specificity for the presence of TP53 mutation and its high negative predictive value is clinically useful as it can exclude the possibility of a low-grade serous tumour. 4.1% of HGSOC cases have detectable WT staining while harboring a TP53 LOF mutation, which limits sensitivity for binary prediction of mutation to 96%.\n\nOptimized p53 immunohistochemistry is an accurate predictor of TP53 mutation in ovarian carcinoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKÃ¶bel, Martin; Piskorz, Anna M; Lee, Sandra; Lui, Shuhong; LePage, Cecile; Marass, Francesco; Rosenfeld, Nitzan; Mes Masson, AnneâMarie\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract TP53 mutations are ubiquitous in highâgrade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC), and the presence of TP53 mutation discriminates between high and lowâgrade serous carcinomas and is now an important biomarker for clinical trials targeting mutant p53. p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is widely used as a surrogate for TP53 mutation but its accuracy has not been established.
