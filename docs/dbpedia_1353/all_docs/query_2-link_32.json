        "text": "Granulomatous slack skin syndrome: Report of a unique case.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaheswari, S Uma; Sampath, V; Ramesh, A\n\n2018-01-01\n\nGranulomatous slack skin syndrome is a rare variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). It is characterized clinically by redundant skin folds, which show a predilection towards flexural areas such as the axilla and the groin. Histologically, it shows a granulomatous T-cell infiltrate and loss of elastic tissue. It has an indolent but progressive course; and is usually refractory to treatment. We report a unique case of slack skin syndrome, sparing the classical sites with rapid and unusual involvement of non-intertriginous areas.\n\nA unique case of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome presenting with congenital hypopituitarism.\n\nPubMed\n\nJivani, Nurin; Torrado-Jule, Carmen; Vaiselbuh, Sarah; Romanos-Sirakis, Eleny\n\n2016-11-01\n\nShwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive bone marrow failure syndrome typically characterized by neutropenia and pancreatic dysfunction, although phenotypic presentations vary, and the endocrine phenotype is not well-described. We report a unique case of a patient with SDS who initially presented with hypoglycemia and micropenis in the newborn period and was diagnosed with congenital hypopituitarism. We are not aware of any other cases of SDS documented with this combination of complex endocrinopathies.\n\nUnique and atypical deletions in Prader-Willi syndrome reveal distinct phenotypes.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Soo-Jeong; Miller, Jennifer L; Kuipers, Paul J; German, Jennifer Ruth; Beaudet, Arthur L; Sahoo, Trilochan; Driscoll, Daniel J\n\n2012-03-01\n\nPrader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystem, contiguous gene disorder caused by an absence of paternally expressed genes within the 15q11.2-q13 region via one of the three main genetic mechanisms: deletion of the paternally inherited 15q11.2-q13 region, maternal uniparental disomy and imprinting defect. The deletion class is typically subdivided into Type 1 and Type 2 based on their proximal breakpoints (BP1-BP3 and BP2-BP3, respectively). Despite PWS being a well-characterized genetic disorder the role of the specific genes contributing to various aspects of the phenotype are not well understood. Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) is a recently developed technique that detects copy number changes and aberrant DNA methylation. In this study, we initially applied MS-MLPA to elucidate the deletion subtypes of 88 subjects. In our cohort, 32 had a Type 1 and 49 had a Type 2 deletion. The remaining seven subjects had unique or atypical deletions that were either smaller (n=5) or larger (n=2) than typically described and were further characterized by array-based comparative genome hybridization. In two subjects both the PWS region (15q11.2) and the newly described 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region were deleted. The subjects with a unique or an atypical deletion revealed distinct phenotypic features. In conclusion, unique or atypical deletions were found in â¼8% of the deletion subjects with PWS in our cohort. These novel deletions provide further insight into the potential role of several of the genes within the 15q11.2 and the 15q13.3 regions.\n\nCotard Syndrome with Catatonia: Unique Combination\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBasu, Aniruddha; Singh, Priti; Gupta, Rajiv; Soni, Sandeep\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCotard syndrome is a rare psychiatric condition characterized by extreme nihilistic delusions.

The major finding was asymmetric formation of the lateral temporal lobes, with marked enlargement of the right superior temporal gyrus, suggesting that alcohol is preferentially toxic to temporal lobe patterning during gestation. Critical maturational changes unique to adolescence can unmask psychotic symptomatology mediated by temporal lobe pathology that has been clinically dormant since birth. Elucidating the neuropathologic basis of the secondary psychiatric disorders in fetal alcohol syndrome can help provide insight into their putative developmental origins.

It typically affects postmenopausal women without angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. We report here an uncommon occurrence of secondary TTS in a male with coronary artery disease after exogenous catecholamine administration and pacemaker implantation. This unexpected case suggests that, in such clinical scenario, a TTS diagnosis might be considered even in unsuspected individuals.\n\nThe Gaming of Concussions: A Unique Intervention in Postconcussion Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLynch, James M.; Anderson, Megan; Benton, Brooke; Green, Sue Stanley\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective: To present the case of 2 adolescent high school student-athletes who developed postconcussion syndrome with protracted and limiting visual complaints that markedly affected academic, social, and athletic activity for a year after the onset of symptoms. Both had significant improvement soon after a unique intervention was administered. Background: A 14-year-old female soccer and softball player sustained 2 concussions in the same week. She had persistent symptoms for a year that affected her grades and precluded athletic participation. A 15-year-old male football player sustained a concussion during an altercation with 2 other male adolescents. He continued to have symptoms 1 year later, with a marked decrease in academic performance and restriction from athletics. Both adolescents reported blurry vision, photophobia, and associated headache as significant components of the postconcussion syndrome. Differential Diagnosis: Concussion, postconcussion syndrome, skull fracture, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, second-impact syndrome, and visually sensitive migraine. Treatment: Both patients were advised to obtain computer gaming glasses to use throughout the day. The female patient was diligent in her use of the glasses, with marked lessening of symptoms. The male patient was less accepting of the glasses but did report lessening of symptoms when using the glasses. Uniqueness: We hypothesized that postconcussion syndrome with marked visual complaints would respond to and improve with decreased stimulation of the visual system. This was attempted with the addition of computer gaming glasses. Both adolescent athletes responded well to the filtering of visual stimuli by off-the-shelf computer gaming glasses. Conclusions: Postconcussion syndrome is a persistent condition with a myriad of symptoms. Two young athletes developed postconcussion syndrome with prominent visual symptoms that lasted a year. The addition of computer gaming glasses markedly lessened\n\nUnique cerebrovascular anomalies in Noonan syndrome with RAF1 mutation.\n\nPubMed\n\nZarate, Yuri A; Lichty, Angie W; Champion, Kristen J; Clarkson, L Kate; Holden, Kenton R; Matheus, M Gisele\n\n2014-08-01\n\nNoonan syndrome is a common autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by gain-of-function germline mutations affecting components of the Ras-MAPK pathway. The authors present the case of a 6-year-old male with Noonan syndrome, Chiari malformation type I, shunted benign external hydrocephalus in infancy, and unique cerebrovascular changes. A de novo heterozygous change in the RAF1 gene was identified. The patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography to further clarify the nature of his abnormal brain vasculature. The authors compared his findings to the few cases of Noonan syndrome reported with cerebrovascular pathology. Â© The Author(s) 2013.\n\nA Disorder Unique to Adolescence?

A 12-year-old girl with otherwise unremarkable medical history presented with abrupt, painless loss of vision. Over the next few months, she developed moderate sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, migraines, anhedonia and thyroiditis. Ocular examination confirmed bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Metabolic workup documented elevated cerebrospinal fluid lactate. Initial genetic analyses excluded the three most common LHON mutations. Subsequently, Sanger sequencing of the entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome was performed. Whole mtDNA sequencing revealed a pathogenic heteroplasmic mutation m.13046T>C in MTND5 encoding the ND5 subunit of complex I. This particular variant has previously been described in a single case report of MELAS/Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalopathy). Based on the constellation of clinical symptoms in our patient, we diagnose the condition as LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome. We describe a unique presentation of LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome resulting from a m.13046T>C mutation in a 12-year-old girl. In patients with sudden vision loss in which three of the most prevalent LHON mitochondrial mutations have been ruled out, molecular genetic examination should be extended to other mtDNA-encoded subunits of MTND5 complex I. Furthermore, atypical clinical presentations must be considered, even in well-described phenotypes.\n\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by severe esophagitis: a unique clinical syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuntipalli, Prathima; Chason, Rebecca; Elliott, Alan; Rockey, Don C\n\n2014-12-01\n\nWe have recognized a unique clinical syndrome in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding who are found to have severe esophagitis. We aimed to more clearly describe the clinical entity of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with severe esophagitis. We conducted a retrospective matched case-control study designed to investigate clinical features in patients with carefully defined upper gastrointestinal bleeding and severe esophagitis. Patient data were captured prospectively via a Gastrointestinal Bleeding Healthcare Registry, which collects data on all patients admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with endoscopically documented esophagitis (cases) were matched with randomly selected controls that had upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by other lesions. Epidemiologic features in patients with esophagitis were similar to those with other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, hematemesis was more common in patients with esophagitis 86% (102/119) than in controls 55% (196/357) (p < 0.0001), while melena was less common in patients with esophagitis 38% (45/119) than in controls 68% (244/357) (p < 0.0001). Additionally, the more severe the esophagitis, the more frequent was melena. Patients with esophagitis had less abnormal vital signs, lesser decreases in hematocrit, and lesser increases in BUN. Both pre- and postRockall scores were lower in patients with esophagitis compared with controls (p = 0.01, and p < 0.0001, respectively). Length of hospital stay (p = 0.002), rebleeding rate at 42 days (p = 0.0007), and mortality were less in patients with esophagitis than controls. Finally, analysis of patients with esophagitis and cirrhosis suggested that this group of patients had more severe bleeding than those without cirrhosis. We have described a unique clinical syndrome in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding who have erosive esophagitis. This syndrome is manifest by typical clinical features and is associated with\n\nGrowing skull hemangioma: first and unique description in a patient with Klippel-TrÃ©naunay-Weber syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan der Loo, Lars E; Beckervordersandforth, Jan; Colon, Albert J; Schijns, Olaf E M G\n\n2017-02-01\n\nWe present the first and unique case of a rapid-growing skull hemangioma in a patient with Klippel-TrÃ©naunay-Weber syndrome. This case report provides evidence that not all rapid-growing, osteolytic skull lesions need to have a malignant character but certainly need a histopathological verification. This material offers insight into the list of rare pathological diagnoses in an infrequent syndrome.\n\nA unique rodent model of cardiometabolic risk associated with the metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Danni; Dyck, Michael K; Uwiera, Richard R E; Russell, Jim C; Proctor, Spencer D; Vine, Donna F\n\n2009-09-01\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligo-/anovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology and is a complex endocrine disorder that also presents with features of the metabolic syndrome, including obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. These latter symptoms form cardiometabolic risk factors predisposing individuals to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). To date, animal models to study PCOS in the context of the metabolic syndrome and CVD risk have been lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the JCR:LA-cp rodent as an animal model of PCOS associated with the metabolic syndrome. Metabolic indices were measured at 6 and 12 wk, and reproductive parameters including ovarian morphology and estrous cyclicity were assessed at 12 wk or adulthood. At 6 wk of age, the cp/cp genotype of the JCR:LA-cp strain developed visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia) compared with control animals. Serum testosterone concentrations were not significantly different between groups at 6 wk of age. However, at 12 wk, the cp/cp genotype had higher serum testosterone concentrations, compared with control animals, and presented with oligoovulation, a decreased number of corpora lutea, and an increased number of total follicles, in particular atretic and cystic follicles. The cardiometabolic risk factors in the cp/cp animals were exacerbated at 12 wk including obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. The results of this study demonstrate that the JCR:LA-cp rodent may be a useful PCOS-like model to study early mechanisms involved in the etiology of cardiometabolic risk factors in the context of both PCOS and the metabolic syndrome.\n\nUnique Variants in OPN1LW Cause Both Syndromic and Nonsyndromic X-Linked High Myopia Mapped to MYP1.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Jiali; Gao, Bei; Guan, Liping; Xiao, Xueshan; Zhang, Jianguo; Li, Shiqiang; Jiang, Hui; Jia, Xiaoyun; Yang, Jianhua; Guo, Xiangming; Yin, Ye; Wang, Jun; Zhang, Qingjiong\n\n2015-06-01\n\nMYP1 is a locus for X-linked syndromic and nonsyndromic high myopia. Recently, unique haplotypes in OPN1LW were found to be responsible for X-linked syndromic high myopia mapped to MYP1. The current study is to test if such variants in OPN1LW are also responsible for X-linked nonsyndromic high myopia mapped to MYP1. The proband of the family previously mapped to MYP1 was initially analyzed using whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. Additional probands with early-onset high myopia were analyzed using whole-exome sequencing. Variants in OPN1LW were selected and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Long-range and second PCR were used to determine the haplotype and the first gene of the red-green gene array. Candidate variants were further validated in family members and controls. The unique LVAVA haplotype in OPN1LW was detected in the family with X-linked nonsyndromic high myopia mapped to MYP1. In addition, this haplotype and a novel frameshift mutation (c.617_620dup, p.Phe208Argfs*51) in OPN1LW were detected in two other families with X-linked high myopia. The unique haplotype cosegregated with high myopia in the two families, with a maximum LOD score of 3.34 and 2.31 at Î¸ = 0. OPN1LW with the variants in these families was the first gene in the red-green gene array and was not present in 247 male controls. Reevaluation of the clinical data in both families with the unique haplotype suggested nonsyndromic high myopia. Our study confirms the findings that unique variants in OPN1LW are responsible for both syndromic and nonsyndromic X-linked high myopia mapped to MYP1.\n\nThe autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeBoeuf, Nicole; Garg, Amit; Worobec, Sophie\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy syndrome is characterized by the presence of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, adrenal insufficiency, and hypoparathyroidism. Almost all patients have skin or nail findings early in the course of the disease. Therefore, the dermatologist is in the unique position of being able to identify patients with this syndrome early in its course and to facilitate careful monitoring of potentially lethal complications.\n\nUnique topological characterization of braided magnetic fields\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nYeates, A. R.; Hornig, G.\n\nWe introduce a topological flux function to quantify the topology of magnetic braids: non-zero, line-tied magnetic fields whose field lines all connect between two boundaries. This scalar function is an ideal invariant defined on a cross-section of the magnetic field, and measures the average poloidal magnetic flux around any given field line, or the average pairwise crossing number between a given field line and all others. Moreover, its integral over the cross-section yields the relative magnetic helicity. Using the fact that the flux function is also an action in the Hamiltonian formulation of the field line equations, we prove thatmoreÂ Â» it uniquely characterizes the field line mapping and hence the magnetic topology.Â«Â less\n\nAnterior ankle impingement syndromes.\n\nPubMed\n\nUmans, Hilary R; Cerezal, Luiz\n\n2008-06-01\n\nAnkle impingement syndromes are painful conditions that may complicate ankle trauma and are characterized by chronic, progressive pain, swelling, and limitation of movement. These disorders are subclassified according to anatomical location about the tibiotalar joint. This article reviews the various forms of anterior ankle impingement, detailing the unique clinical features, anatomical considerations, pathoetiology, and imaging findings for each.\n\nOphthalmologic Findings in H Syndrome: A Unique Diagnostic Clue.\n\nPubMed\n\nMolho-Pessach, Vered; Mechoulam, Hadas; Siam, Rula; Babay, Sofia; Ramot, Yuval; Zlotogorski, Abraham\n\n2015-01-01\n\nH syndrome is an autosomal recessive histiocytosis with multisystemic involvement caused by mutations in the SLC29A3 gene. The term H syndrome was coined to denote the major clinical findings which include hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, hearing loss, hepatosplenomegaly, hypogonadism, hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus and hallux valgus/flexion contractures. Almost 100 individuals affected with this disorder have been reported, however, a thorough evaluation of the ophthalmologic features of H syndrome has not yet been performed. Ophthalmic examination of a 50-year-old male with H syndrome. Mutation analysis of SLC29A3 was also performed in this patient. Ophthalmic findings included; shallow orbits with exorbitism, bilateral pterygium, limbal thickening, corneal arcus and cortical cataract. We also review ophthalmologic findings in previously reported H syndrome patients. The presence of dilated lateral scleral vessels, corneal arcus and shallow orbits should raise the suspicion of H syndrome, especially when seen in young age.\n\nEfficacy of Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2 in treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in children: a double blind, randomised placebo controlled study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSudha, M Ratna; Jayanthi, N; Aasin, M; Dhanashri, R D; Anirudh, T\n\n2018-06-15\n\nThe efficacy of the probiotic strain, Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2 in the treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) was evaluated in children. A total of 141 children of either sex in the age group 4-12 years, diagnosed with IBS according to the Rome III criteria, participated in the double-blind randomised controlled trial. Children received either B. coagulans Unique IS2 chewable tablets or placebo once daily for eight weeks followed by a two week follow-up period. Reduction in pain intensity as well as other symptoms associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome like abdominal discomfort, bloating, distension, sense of incomplete evacuation, straining at stool, urgency of bowel movement, passage of gas and mucus, and bowel habit satisfaction were assessed. B. coagulans Unique IS2 treated group showed a greater reduction in pain scores as evaluated by a weekly pain intensity scale. There was a significant reduction (P<0.0001) in pain intensity in the probiotic treated group (7.6Â±0.98) as compared to the placebo group (4.2Â±1.41) by the end of the treatment period (8 weeks). There was also a significant improvement in stool consistency as well as reduction in abdominal discomfort, bloating, staining, urgency, incomplete evacuation and passage of gas. Bowel habit satisfaction and global assessment of relief was also observed in the B. coagulans Unique IS2 treated group as compared to the placebo group. This study demonstrates the efficacy of B. coagulans Unique IS2 in reducing the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in children in the age group of 4-12 years.\n\nCleft palate and ADULT phenotype in a patient with a novel TP63 mutation suggests lumping of EEC/LM/ADULT syndromes into a unique entity: ELA syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nProntera, Paolo; Garelli, Emanuela; Isidori, Ilenia; Mencarelli, Amedea; Carando, Adriana; Silengo, Margherita Cirillo; Donti, Emilio\n\n2011-11-01\n\nAcro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome is a rare condition belonging to the group of ectodermal dysplasias caused by TP63 mutations. Its clinical phenotype is similar to ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate (EEC) and limb-mammary syndrome (LMS), and differs from these disorders mainly by the absence of cleft lip and/or palate. We report on a 39-year-old patient who was found to be heterozygous for a c.401G > T (p.Gly134Val) de novo mutation of TP63. This patient had the ADULT phenotype associated with cleft palate. Our findings, rather than extend the clinical spectrum of ADULT syndrome, suggest that cleft palate can no longer be considered an element for differential diagnosis for ADULT, EEC, and LMS. Our data, added to other reports on overlapping phenotypes, support the combining of these three phenotypes into a unique entity that we propose to call \"ELA syndrome,\" which is an acronym of ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip and palate, limb-mammary, and ADULT syndromes.

The disease was initially reported to manifest with severe erythroderma, failure to thrive, atopic manifestations, recurrent infections, hypotrichosis and palmoplantar keratoderma. We present 3 new cases of SAM syndrome in 2 families and review the cases published so far. Whole exome and direct sequencing were used to identify SAM syndrome-causing mutations. Consistent with previous data, SAM syndrome was found in all 3 patients to result from homozygous mutations in DSG1 predicted to result in premature termination of translation. In contrast, as compared with patients previously reported, the present cases were found to display a wide range of clinical presentations of variable degrees of severity. The present data emphasizes the fact that SAM syndrome is characterized by extensive phenotypic heterogeneity, suggesting the existence of potent modifier traits.

Erin; Dobyns, William B.; Pessoa, AndrÃ©; Ventura, Camila V.; da Fonseca, Eduardo Borges; Ribeiro, Erlane Marques; Ventura, Liana O.; Neto, Norberto Nogueira; Arena, J. Fernando; Rasmussen, Sonja A.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nImportance Zika virus infection can be passed prenatally from a pregnant woman to her fetus. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that intrauterine Zika virus infection is a cause of microcephaly and serious brain anomalies, but the full spectrum of anomalies has not been delineated. To inform pediatric healthcare providers who may be called upon to evaluate and manage affected infants and children, we review the most recent evidence to better characterize congenital Zika syndrome. Observations We reviewed published reports of congenital anomalies occurring in fetuses or infants with presumed or laboratory-confirmed intrauterine Zika virus infection. Congenital anomalies were considered in the context of the presumed pathogenetic mechanism related to the neurotropic properties of the virus. We conclude that congenital Zika syndrome is a recognizable pattern of structural anomalies and functional disabilities secondary to central and perhaps peripheral nervous system damage. Although many of the components of this syndrome such as cognitive, sensory and motor disabilities are shared by other congenital infections, there are five features that are rarely seen with other congenital infections or are unique to congenital Zika virus infection: severe microcephaly with partially collapsed skull; thin cerebral cortices with subcortical calcifications; macular scarring and focal pigmentary retinal mottling; congenital contractures; and marked early hypertonia and symptoms of extrapyramidal involvement. Conclusions and Relevance Although the full spectrum of adverse reproductive outcomes caused by Zika virus infection is not yet determined, a distinctive phenotype, the congenital Zika syndrome, has emerged. Recognition of this phenotype by healthcare providers for infants and children can help ensure appropriate etiologic evaluation as well as comprehensive clinical investigation to define the range of anomalies in an affected infant and determine essential follow\n\nCharacterization of pain, disability, and psychological burden in Marfan syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpeed, Traci J; Mathur, Vani A; Hand, Matthew; Christensen, Bryt; Sponseller, Paul D; Williams, Kayode A; Campbell, Claudia M\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome frequently cause pain. This study aimed to characterize pain in a cohort of adults with Marfan syndrome and investigate demographic, physical, and psychological factors associated with pain and pain-related disability. Two hundred and forty-five participants (73% female, 89% non-Hispanic white, 90% North American) completed an online questionnaire assessing clinical features of Marfan syndrome, pain severity, pain-related disability, physical and mental health, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and insomnia. Eighty-nine percent of respondents reported having pain with 28% of individuals reporting pain as a presenting symptom of Marfan syndrome. Almost half of individuals reported that pain has spread from its initial site. Participants in our study reported poor physical and mental health functioning, moderate pain-related disability, and mild levels of depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and pain catastrophizing. Those who identified pain as an initial symptom of Marfan syndrome and those who reported that pain had spread from its initial site reported greater psychological burden compared with those without pain as an initial symptom or pain spreading. Physical health is the largest predictor of pain severity and pain-related disability. While pain catastrophizing and worse mental health functioning are significant correlates of pain severity and pain-related disability, respectively. Pain is a significant and persistent problem in Marfan syndrome and is associated with profound disability and psychological burden. Further studies are indicated to better characterize the directionality of pain, pain-related disability, and psychological burden in Marfan syndrome. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Some abnormalities, such as webbed neck, renal malformations (>50%) and cardiac defects (10%) are less common. The intelligence of these patients is considered normal. Non-mosaic monosomy X is observed in approximately 45% of postnatal patients with Turner syndrome and the rest of the patients have structural abnormalities or mosaicism involving 46,X,i(Xq), 45,X/46,XX, 45,X and other variants. The phenotype of 45,X/46,X,+mar individuals varies by the genetic continent and degree of the mosaicism. The gene content of the marker chromosome is the most important when correlating the phenotype with the genotype. Here we present an 11-year-old female who was referred for evaluation of her short stature and learning disabilities. Conventional cytogenetic investigation showed a mosaic 45,X/46,X,+mar karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the marker chromosome originated from the X chromosome within the androgen receptor (AR) and X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) genes. Therefore, it is possible that aberrant activation of the marker chromosome, compromising the AR and XIST genes, may modify the Turner syndrome phenotype.\n\nCOTARD SYNDROME IN SEMANTIC DEMENTIA\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMendez, Mario F.; RamÃ­rez-BermÃºdez, JesÃºs\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Semantic dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of meaning of words or concepts. semantic dementia can offer potential insights into the mechanisms of content-specific delusions. Objective The authors present a rare case of semantic dementia with Cotard syndrome, a delusion characterized by nihilism or self-negation. Method The semantic deficits and other features of semantic dementia were evaluated in relation to the patient's Cotard syndrome. Results Mrs. A developed the delusional belief that she was wasting and dying. This occurred after she lost knowledge for her somatic discomforts and sensations and for the organs that were the source of these sensations. Her nihilistic beliefs appeared to emerge from her misunderstanding of her somatic sensations. Conclusion This unique patient suggests that a mechanism for Cotard syndrome is difficulty interpreting the nature and source of internal pains and sensations. We propose that loss of semantic knowledge about one's own body may lead to the delusion of nihilism or death.

It is characterized by a primary infection in the face including a septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and disseminated metastatic abcesses. Fusobacterium necrophorum is the main pathogen found in that syndrome. The diagnosis is based on clinical features, then on the microbiology with positive anaerobic blood cultures as key role and finally on the computed tomography. Most of the time a well-chosen antibiotic treatment against anaerobic pathogens and Gram negative bacilli is efficient but surgery can be useful. We report a case of a 73 years old man, which seems to be unique because it is the first case reported of a Lemierre's syndrome characterized by a parotitis infected by F. necrophorum.

The GBM is initially thin, and with ongoing remodeling, develops a thickened basket-woven appearance. We report a unique case of a 9-year-old boy who was biopsied for hematuria and proteinuria, diagnosed as IgA nephropathy, with normal GBM appearance and thickness. Due to a family history of hematuria and chronic kidney disease, he subsequently underwent genetic evaluation and a mutation of Î±3 type IV collagen (COL4A3) was detected. Additional studies of the initial biopsy demonstrated abnormal type IV collagen immunostaining. A repeat biopsy 4years later showed characteristic glomerular basement membrane morphology of Alport syndrome, and scarring consistent with sequelae of IgA nephropathy. This is the first description of this unusual transition from an initial normal appearance of the glomerular basement membrane to the classic Alport phenotype. Copyright Â© 2018.

We identified a subset of five individuals who had been putatively diagnosed with \"DA2A with severe neurological abnormalities\" and for whom congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and global developmental delay had resulted in early death in three cases; this is a unique condition that we now refer to as CLIFAHDD syndrome. Exome sequencing identified missense mutations in the sodium leak channel, non-selective (NALCN) in four families affected by CLIFAHDD syndrome. We used molecular-inversion probes to screen for NALCN in a cohort of 202 distal arthrogryposis (DA)-affected individuals as well as concurrent exome sequencing of six other DA-affected individuals, thus revealing NALCN mutations in ten additional families with \"atypical\" forms of DA. All 14 mutations were missense variants predicted to alter amino acid residues in or near the S5 and S6 pore-forming segments of NALCN, highlighting the functional importance of these segments. In vitro functional studies demonstrated that NALCN alterations nearly abolished the expression of wild-type NALCN, suggesting that alterations that cause CLIFAHDD syndrome have a dominant-negative effect. In contrast, homozygosity for mutations in other regions of NALCN has been reported in three families affected by an autosomal-recessive condition characterized mainly by hypotonia and severe intellectual disability. Accordingly, mutations in NALCN can cause either a recessive or dominant condition characterized by varied though overlapping phenotypic features, perhaps based on the type of mutation and affected protein domain(s).

Mullerian agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and the upper part (2/3) of the vagina in a woman with normal development of secondary sexual characteristics and a normal 46,XX karyotype. The phenotypic manifestations of MRKH syndrome may sometimes overlap with various other syndromes and require accurate delineation. The coexistence of both these disorders is extremely rare. Here, we report a case of 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis and MRKH syndrome with anatomically dispersed congenital anomalies unique among reported cases.\n\nA cognitive characterization of dyscalculia in Turner syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nBruandet, Marie; Molko, Nicolas; Cohen, Laurent; Dehaene, Stanislas\n\n2004-01-01\n\nCurrent theories of number processing postulate that the human abilities for arithmetic are based on cerebral circuits that are partially laid down under genetic control and later modified by schooling and education. This view predicts the existence of genetic diseases that interfere specifically with components of the number system. Here, we investigate whether Turner syndrome (TS) corresponds to this definition. TS is a genetic disorder which affects one woman in 2500 and is characterized by partial or complete absence of one X chromosome. In addition to well-characterized physical and hormonal dysfunction, TS patients exhibit cognitive deficits including dyscalculia. We tested 12 women with Turner syndrome and 13 control subjects on a cognitive battery including arithmetical tests (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as tests of the understanding of numerosity and quantity (cognitive estimation, estimation, comparison, bisection, subitizing/counting). Impairments were observed in cognitive estimation, subitizing, and calculation. We examine whether these deficits can be attributed to a single source, and discuss the possible implications of hormonal and genetic factors in the neuropsychological profile of TS patients.\n\nMoyamoya syndrome in a patient with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Jin-Ho; Oh, Moon-Yeon; Yum, Mi-Sun; Lee, Beom Hee; Kim, Gu-Hwan; Yoo, Han-Wook\n\n2015-03-01\n\nNoonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair is one of the RASopathies characterized by Noonan syndrome-like features with unique ectodermal abnormalities. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the SHOC2 gene. We encountered a patient with moyamoya syndrome associated with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair presenting with transient ischemic attacks. A 6-year-old girl was diagnosed with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair because of profound short stature and ectodermal anomalies such as sparse and easily pluckable hair. A heterozygous mutation of c.4A>G (p.S2G) in the SHOC2 gene was identified, and recombinant human growth hormone therapy was initiated at 8 years of age. At age 10, she manifested recurrent left hemiplegia. Moreover, cerebrovascular imaging revealed occlusion or narrowing of both internal carotid arteries and both middle cerebral arteries with distal moyamoya-like vessels. She is treated with aspirin and calcium channel blocker. We describe the first case of Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair associated with moyamoya syndrome, although it has been reported to be associated with a few cases of other RASopathies, including Noonan, cardiofaciocutaneous, and Costello syndromes. This report emphasizes the associations between cerebrovascular anomalies and Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Hypopigmentation of the choroid is a unique feature of this condition examined with multi-modal Ultra-Widefield Imaging in this report. Material/Methods Report of a single case. Results Bilateral symmetric choroidal hypopigmentation was observed with hypoautofluorescence in the region of hypopigmentation. Fluorescein angiography revealed a normal vasculature, however a thickened choroid was seen on Enhanced-Depth Imaging Spectral-Domain OCT (EDI SD-OCT). Conclusion(s) Choroidal hypopigmentation is a unique feature of Waardenburg syndrome, which can be visualized with ultra-widefield fundus autofluorescence. The choroid may also be thickened in this condition and its thickness measured with EDI SD-OCT.

It is for this reason that NASA/LeRC contracted Unique Mobility Corporation to exploit their novel actuator designs to build a robot that would advance the present state of technology with respect to these requirements. Custom-designed motors are the key feature of this robot. They are compact, high-performance dc brushless servo motors with a high pole count and low inductance, thus permitting high torque generation and rapid phase commutation. Using a custom-designed digital signal processor-based controller board, the pulse width modulation power amplifiers regulate the fast dynamics of the motor currents. In addition, the programmable digital signal processor (DSP) controller permits implementation of nonlinear compensation algorithms to account for motoring vs. regeneration, torque ripple, and back-EMF. As a result, the motors produce a high torque relative to their size and weight, and can do so with good torque regulation and acceptably high velocity saturation limits. This paper presents the Unique Mobility Corporation robot prototype: its actuators, its kinematic design, its control system, and its experimental characterization. Performance results, including saturation torques, saturation velocities and tracking accuracy tests are included.\n\nDifferences in manifestations of Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeester, Josephina A N; Verstraeten, Aline; Schepers, Dorien; Alaerts, Maaike; Van Laer, Lut; Loeys, Bart L\n\n2017-11-01\n\nMany different heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTD) have been described over the past decades. These syndromes often affect the connective tissue of various organ systems, including heart, blood vessels, skin, joints, bone, eyes, and lungs. The discovery of these HCTD was followed by the identification of mutations in a wide range of genes encoding structural proteins, modifying enzymes, or components of the TGFÎ²-signaling pathway. Three typical examples of HCTD are Marfan syndrome (MFS), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS). These syndromes show some degree of phenotypical overlap of cardiovascular, skeletal, and cutaneous features. MFS is typically characterized by cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal manifestations and is caused by heterozygous mutations in FBN1 , coding for the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibrillin-1. The most common cardiovascular phenotype involves aortic aneurysm and dissection at the sinuses of Valsalva. LDS is caused by mutations in TGBR1/2 , SMAD2/3 , or TGFB2/3 , all coding for components of the TGFÎ²-signaling pathway. LDS can be distinguished from MFS by the unique presence of hypertelorism, bifid uvula or cleft palate, and widespread aortic and arterial aneurysm and tortuosity. Compared to MFS, LDS cardiovascular manifestations tend to be more severe. In contrast, no association is reported between LDS and the presence of ectopia lentis, a key distinguishing feature of MFS. Overlapping features between MFS and LDS include scoliosis, pes planus, anterior chest deformity, spontaneous pneumothorax, and dural ectasia. EDS refers to a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous connective tissue disorders and all subtypes are characterized by variable abnormalities of skin, ligaments and joints, blood vessels, and internal organs.

WS is subdivided into 4 major types (WS1â4), where WS2 is characterized by the absence of dystopia canthorum. This study was launched to investigate clinical and molecular characteristics of WS in an extended Iranian WS2 family. A comprehensive clinical investigation was performed. Peripheral blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted. Affected members of the family were studied for possible mutations within the SOX10, MITF, and SNAI2 genes. Six WS2 individuals affected from a large Iranian WS2 kindred were enrolled. All affected members carried the novel substitution c.877C>T at exon 9 in the MITF gene, which resulted in p.Arg293* at the protein level. None of the healthy members and also of 50 ethnically matched controls had this variant. In addition, a spectrum of unique ocular findings, including nystagmus, chorioretinal degeneration, optic disc hypoplasia, astigmatism, and myopia, was segregated with the mutant allele in the pedigree. Our data provide insight into the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of WS2 in an Iranian family and could further expand the spectrum of MITF mutations and have implications for genetic counseling on WS in Iran.

To date, approximately 40 different p63 mutations have been identified, all heterozygous. No definitive treatments are available to counteract and resolve the progressive corneal degeneration due to a premature aging of limbal epithelial stem cells. Here, we describe a unique case of a young female patient, aged 18 years, with EEC and corneal dysfunction, who was, surprisingly, homozygous for a novel and de novo R311K missense mutation in the p63 gene. A detailed analysis of the degree of somatic mosaicism in leukocytes from peripheral blood and oral mucosal epithelial stem cells (OMESCs) from biopsies of buccal mucosa showed that approximately 80% were homozygous mutant cells and 20% were heterozygous. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses excluded genomic alterations, thus suggesting a de novo mutation followed by an allelic gene conversion of the wild-type allele by de novo mutant allele as a possible mechanism to explain the homozygous condition. R311K-p63 OMESCs were expanded in vitro and heterozygous holoclones selected following clonal analysis. These R311K-p63 OMESCs were able to generate well-organized and stratified epithelia in vitro, resembling the features of healthy tissues. This study supports the rationale for the development of cultured autologous oral mucosal epithelial stem cell sheets obtained by selected heterozygous R311K-p63 stem cells, as an effective and personalized therapy for reconstructing the ocular surface of this unique case of EEC syndrome, thus bypassing gene therapy approaches. This case demonstrates that in a somatic mosaicism context, a novel homozygous mutation in the p63 gene can arise as a consequence of an allelic gene conversion event, subsequent to a de novo mutation. The heterozygous mutant R311K-p63 stem cells can be isolated by means of clonal analysis and given their good regenerative\n\nIdentification of three novel NHS mutations in families with Nance-Horan syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Kristen M; Wu, Junhua; Brooks, Simon P; Hardcastle, Alison J; Lewis, Richard Alan; Stambolian, Dwight\n\n2007-03-27\n\nNance-Horan Syndrome (NHS) is an infrequent and often overlooked X-linked disorder characterized by dense congenital cataracts, microphthalmia, and dental abnormalities. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the NHS gene, whose function is not known. The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency and distribution of NHS gene mutations and compare genotype with Nance-Horan phenotype in five North American NHS families. Genomic DNA was isolated from white blood cells from NHS patients and family members. The NHS gene coding region and its splice site donor and acceptor regions were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR, and the amplicons were sequenced directly. We identified three unique NHS coding region mutations in these NHS families. This report extends the number of unique identified NHS mutations to 14.\n\nDental management of patient with Williams Syndrome - A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nWong, Daniel; Ramachandra, Srinivas Sulugodu; Singh, Ashish Kumar\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWilliams syndrome is a multisystemic rare genetic disorder caused by deletion of 26-28 genes in the long arm of chromosome 7. It is characterized by developmental and physical abnormalities including congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, mental retardation, neurological features, growth deficiency, genitourinary manifestations, gastrointestinal problems, musculoskeletal problems, unique behavioral characteristics, and dental problems. Dental abnormalities include malocclusion, hypodontia, malformed teeth, taurodontism, pulp stones, increased space between teeth, enamel hypoplasia, and high prevalence of dental caries. Authors report a 17-year-old female patient with underlying Williams syndrome. Oral features and problems seen in the patient are listed. Malocclusion and screwdriver shaped teeth were noticed. Generalized widening of the periodontal ligament space with vital teeth was seen. This finding has not been reported in cases of Williams syndrome earlier.

It has been postulated that a vascular apoptosis inducing component of Russell's viper venom that is not neutralized by the commercially available anti-snake venom (ASV) is responsible for this complication as it occurs even after adequate doses of ASV administration in most cases. Acute kidney injury often requiring dialysis is invariably present in all patients because of reduced renal perfusion and ischemic acute tubular necrosis as a result of hypotension. Management mainly involves aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. There are no other proven effective treatment modalities, except a few reports of successful treatment with plasmapheresis. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy, terbutaline, aminophylline, and intravenous immunoglobulin are other treatment modalities tried.

Metabolic cutis laxa results from Menkes syndrome, caused by a defect in the ATPase copper transporting alpha (ATP7A) gene; congenital disorders of glycosylation due to mutations in subunit 7 of the component of oligomeric Golgi (COG7)-congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) complex; combined disorder of N- and O-linked glycosylation, due to mutations in ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a2 (ATP6VOA2) gene; pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 deficiency; pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase deficiency; macrocephaly, alopecia, cutis laxa, and scoliosis (MACS) syndrome, due to Ras and Rab interactor 2 (RIN2) mutations; transaldolase deficiency caused by mutations in the transaldolase 1 (TALDO1) gene; Gerodermia osteodysplastica due to mutations in the golgin, RAB6-interacting (GORAB or SCYL1BP1) gene; and mitogen-activated pathway (MAP) kinase defects, caused by mutations in several genes [protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor-type 11 (PTPN11), RAF, NF, HRas proto-oncogene, GTPase (HRAS), B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF), MEK1/2, KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS), SOS Ras/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (SOS2), leucine rich repeat scaffold protein (SHOC2), NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (NRAS), and Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (RAF1)], which regulate the Ras-MAPK cascade. Here, we further expand the list of inborn errors of metabolism associated with cutis laxa by describing the clinical presentation of a 17-month-old girl with Leigh-like syndrome due to enoyl coenzyme A hydratase, short chain, 1, mitochondria (ECHS1) deficiency, a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the second step of the beta-oxidation spiral of fatty acids and plays an important role in amino acid catabolism, particularly valine.\n\nSUMMARY OF TECNIQUES AND UNIQUE USES FOR DIRECT PUSH METHODS IN SITE CHARACTERIZATION ON CONTAMINATED FIELD SITES\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nAt many of the sites where we have been asked to assist in site characterization, we have discovered severe discrepancies that new technologies may be able to prevent.

Loss-of-function mutations in the FERMT1 gene are the cause of Kindler syndrome. Kindler syndrome is categorized as a subtype of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). During infancy and childhood, there is clinical overlap between Kindler syndrome and dystrophic EB. Unlike other forms of EB, Kindler syndrome is characterized by impaired actin cytoskeleton-extracellular matrix interactions and a variable plane of blister formation at or close to the dermal-epidermal junction. This article reviews clinicopathologic and molecular features of Kindler syndrome and discusses patient management.\n\nImaging findings in a child with calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain syndrome after bone marrow transplant for beta thalassemia major.\n\nPubMed\n\nAyyala, Rama S; Arnold, Staci D; Bhatia, Monica; Dastgir, Jahannaz\n\n2016-10-01\n\nCalcineurin inhibitor-induced pain syndrome is an entity recognized in patients on immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation. Diagnosis is characterized by onset of pain beginning in the setting of an elevated calcineurin-inhibitor trough level. Reducing the medication dose relieves symptoms.

The syndrome is caused by mutations in the NHS gene, whose function is not known. The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency and distribution of NHS gene mutations and compare genotype with Nance-Horan phenotype in five North American NHS families. Methods Genomic DNA was isolated from white blood cells from NHS patients and family members. The NHS gene coding region and its splice site donor and acceptor regions were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR, and the amplicons were sequenced directly. Results We identified three unique NHS coding region mutations in these NHS families. Conclusions This report extends the number of unique identified NHS mutations to 14.

We have previously identified a homozygous deletion of 179,311 bp on chromosome 2p21 as the cause of a unique syndrome, inherited in a recessive mode, consisting of cystinuria, neonatal seizures, hypotonia, severe somatic and developmental delay, facial dysmorphism, and reduced activity of all the respiratory chain enzymatic complexes that are encoded in the mitochondria. We now present the transcription content of this region: Multiple splicing variants of the genes protein phosphatase 1B (formerly 2C) magnesium-dependent, beta isoform (PPM1B), SLC3A1, and KIAA0436 (approved gene symbol PREPL) were identified and their patterns of expression analyzed. The spliced variants are predicted to have additional functions compared to the known variants and their patterns of expression fit the tissues affected by the syndrome. The first exon of an additional gene (C2orf34) is encoded in the deleted region and the gene is not expressed in the patients. In addition several transcripts with very short open reading frames are also encoded in the deletion. The identification of all transcripts encoded in the region deleted in the patients is the first step in the study of the genotype-phenotype correlation of the 2p21 patients.\n\nA unique TBX5 microdeletion with microinsertion detected in patient with Holt-Oram syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorine, Mikio; Kohmoto, Tomohiro; Masuda, Kiyoshi; Inagaki, Hidehito; Watanabe, Miki; Naruto, Takuya; Kurahashi, Hiroki; Maeda, Kazuhisa; Imoto, Issei\n\n2015-12-01\n\nHolt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by upper limb and congenital heart defects and caused by numerous germline mutations of TBX5 producing preterminal stop codons. Here, we report on a novel and unusual heterozygous TBX5 microdeletion with microinsertion (microindel) mutation (c.627delinsGTGACTCAGGAAACGCTTTCCTGA), which is predicted to synthesize a truncated TBX5 protein, detected in a sporadic patient with clinical features of HOS prenatally diagnosed by ultrasonography. This uncommon and relatively large inserted sequence contains sequences derived from nearby but not adjacent templates on both sense and antisense strands, suggesting two possible models, which require no repeat sequences, causing this complex microindel through the bypass of large DNA adducts via an error-prone DNA polymerase-mediated translesion synthesis.

Engel more than 50 years ago, the idea of a unique structure in personality emerged, which was given a causal meaning in the development of Sudeck's Disease (now known as complex regional pain syndrome - CRPS), of which the pathogenesis is particularly unknown until today. It was supposed that certain psychological traits predispose one to develop CRPS. Predisposition in this context was apprehended as a personal susceptibility to produce and maintain an excessive reaction to nociceptive stimulations. This model has been maintained for a long time and was the subject of scientific examination just in the last two decades. Some publications reporting sporadic correlations between CRPS and certain personality traits, for example anxiety, neuroticism and depressive mood, are presented as are also 15 current empirical studies and five reviews, which deal in a more differentiated manner with the formulated question and lead to sobering results. The relevant state of research as well as the fundamental and methodical difficulties in regard to verifying a CRPS personality or pain-prone personality are discussed critically. In general, there is a lack of high-quality relevant studies. Some retrospective/cross-sectional studies yield contradictory results regarding psychological problems in patients with CRPS but the majority shows no association, and studies with higher methodological quality tend to the conclusion of no relationship between psychological factors like depression, anxiety, neuroticism, or anger and CRPS. Especially, the few prospective studies do not report such a relationship, psychological factors are not associated with CRPS onset. Compared to other patients with chronic pain there is no unique disturbed psychological profile and no higher degree of psychosocial disturbance in CRPS patients. In all, the results of research cannot confirm the hypothesis of correlations between\n\nTAFRO syndrome: current perspectives.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakashita, Kentaro; Murata, Kengo; Takamori, Mikio\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMulticentric Castleman's disease (MCD), a distinct subtype of Castleman's disease, is a rare, nonneoplastic, lymphoproliferative disorder. Patients with MCD present with systemic symptoms and multiple lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis of various histological MCD patterns including hyaline vascular, plasma cell, and mixed types. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) infection was identified as an important etiology of MCD among immunocompromised patients such as those positive for human immunodeficiency virus. Although HHV8-negative MCD was reported in immunocompetent patients, the underlying etiology remains unknown. Several experts speculate that MCD in immunocompetent patients might be due to proinflammatory hypercytokinemia because of infection by a virus other than HHV8, inflammation, or neoplastic disease. In 2010, a distinct variant of HHV8-negative MCD reported in Japan was characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly (TAFRO). Recent case reports and a systematic review suggest that TAFRO syndrome might have a unique pathogenesis among HHV8-negative MCD variants. This review introduces TAFRO syndrome as a subtype of HHV8-negative MCD and offers an overview of the current perspectives on this syndrome.\n\nSpecial Deveice as Aids in the Management of Child Self-Mutilation in the Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLetts, R.

Children who survive the severe bone marrow dysfunction in childhood develop Kearns-Sayre syndrome later in life. Here we report on four new cases with this condition and define their biochemical abnormalities. Three out of four patients presented with failure to thrive, with most of them having normal development and head size. All patients had evidence of bone marrow involvement that spontaneously improved in three out of four patients. Unique findings in our patients were acute pancreatitis (one out of four), renal Fanconi syndrome (present in all patients, but symptomatic only in one), and an unusual organic aciduria with 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria in one patient. Biochemical analysis indicated low levels of plasma citrulline and arginine, despite low-normal ammonia levels. Regression analysis indicated a significant correlation between each intermediate of the urea cycle and the next, except between ornithine and citrulline. This suggested that the reaction catalyzed by ornithine transcarbamylase (that converts ornithine to citrulline) might not be very efficient in patients with Pearson syndrome. In view of low-normal ammonia levels, we hypothesize that ammonia and carbamylphosphate could be diverted from the urea cycle to the synthesis of nucleotides in patients with Pearson syndrome and possibly other mitochondrial disorders.

Dilated fundus examination revealed irregular hypopigmentation posterior to the equator in both eyes, confirmed by fundus autofluorescence. A thickened choroid was seen on enhanced-depth imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (EDI SD-OCT). Systemic evaluation revealed sensorineural deafness, telecanthus, and a white forelock. Further investigation revealed a first-degree relative with Waardenburg syndrome. Waardenburg syndrome is characterized by a group of features including telecanthus, a broad nasal root, synophrys of the eyebrows, piedbaldism, heterochromia irides, and deafness. Choroidal hypopigmentation is a unique feature that can be visualized with ultrawide-field fundus autofluorescence. The choroid may also be thickened and its thickness measured with EDI SD-OCT.

A battery of Social and Intrapersonal ToM tasks was administered to 39 children with autism and 34 children with Asperger syndrome. For both groups of children, ToM differentiated and Intrapersonal ToM was stronger than Social ToM. This asymmetry was greater for children with autism, whose Social ToM was especially weak. These results support a differentiated, as opposed to integrated, ToM. Moreover, the findings provide a more thorough understanding of the cognitive abilities associated with autism and Asperger syndrome.

The enormous genetic heterogeneity that characterizes our own species, the complexities of numerous nature-nurture interactions, and the quantitative and qualitative variations of the senescent phenotype that are observed suggest that precise patterns of aging in each of us may be unique. Patterns of aging may also differ sharply among species (for example, semelparous vs. multiparous mammals). Some potential common denominators, however, allow one to identify progeroid syndromes in man that could lead to the elucidation of important pathways of gene action. (The suffix \"-oid\" means \"like\"; it does not mean identity.) Unimodal progeroid syndromes (eg., familial dementia of the Alzheimer type, an autosomal dominant) can help us understand the pathogenesis of a particular aspect of the senescent phenotype of man. Segmental progeroid syndromes (eg. the Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive) may be relevant to multiple aspects of the senescent phenotype. Some results of research on the Werner syndrome may be interpreted as support for \"peripheral\" as opposed to \"central\" theories of aging; they are consistent with the view that gene action in the domain of development (adolescence, in this instance) can set the stage for patterns of aging in the adult; they point to the importance of mesenchymal cell populations in the pathogenesis of age-related disorders; finally, they underscore the role of chromosomal instability, especially in the pathogenesis of neoplasia.\n\n[Cotard syndrome].\n\nPubMed\n\nSimovici, G; Bauer, A\n\n1996-01-01\n\nWe describe a schizophrenic paranoid patient, who developed a unique clinical state that fits the Cotard syndrome.

CAPS includes diseases with various severities. The aim of this study was to characterize patients according to the disease severity of CAPS. Five Japanese patients with four kinds of gene variations in NLRP3 were found and diagnosed as CAPS or juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Two mutations in NLRP3, Y563N and E688K, found in CAPS patients exhibit significant positive activities in the nuclear factor-ÎºB reporter gene assay. Increased serum interleukin (IL)-18 levels were only observed in severe cases of CAPS. In mild cases of CAPS, the serum IL-18 levels were not increased, although lipopolysaccharide- or hypothermia-enhanced IL-1Î² and IL-18 production levels by their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detectable. This series of case reports suggests that a combination of in vitro assays could be a useful tool for the diagnosis and characterization of the disease severity of CAPS.\n\nClinical characterization and mutation spectrum in Hispanic families with adenomatous polyposis syndromes.\n\nPubMed\n\nCruz-Correa, Marcia; Diaz-Algorri, Yaritza; Mendez, Vanessa; Vazquez, Pedro Juan; Lozada, Maria Eugenia; Freyre, Katerina; Lathroum, Liselle; Gonzalez-Pons, Maria; Hernandez-Marrero, Jessica; Giardiello, Francis; Rodriguez-Quilichini, Segundo\n\n2013-09-01\n\nSeveral genetically defined hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndromes are associated with colonic polyposis including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and MUTYH adenomatous polyposis (MAP).

To describe the phenotype and genotype of Puerto Rican Hispanic patients with FAP and MUTYH and compare with other ethnic and racial groups. Probands were identified from the Puerto Rico Familial Colorectal Cancer Registry (PURIFICAR). Recruited individuals completed risk factors, medical, and family history questionnaires and underwent genetic testing for genotype analysis. Frequency analysis, Chi square, Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for statistical analysis methods. A total of 31 FAP (from 19 families) and 13 MAP (from 13 families) Hispanic patients recruited from the PURIFICAR were evaluated. Among the FAP cases, mean age at diagnosis was 27.6 (range 9-71 years); 67.7 % cases had more than 100 polyps and 41.9 % had upper gastrointestinal polyps. Among the 19 FAP families, there were 77 affected FAP individuals and 26 colorectal cancer cases. Genetic mutations were available for 42.2 % of FAP families; all mutations identified were unique. Surgeries were reported in 31 cases; 14 (45.2 %) prophylactic surgeries and 6 (19.4 %) therapeutic surgeries for management of CRC. Among MAP cases, mean age at diagnosis was 53 (range 34-76 years). Genetic analysis revealed homozygous biallelic mutations (G382D) in 53.8 %, compound heterozygous mutations (G382/Y165C) in 23 %, and non-G382/Y165C monoallelic mutations in 23 %.

We report a3-year-old girl with classic diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome who developed late onset seizures, hemiparesis and transient blindness on the 17th hospital day, at which time her recovery was characterized by improvement in her blood pressure, serum electrolytes, renal function, hematocrit and platelet count. A CT and MR revealed brainstem and posterior parietal and occipital infarct/edema. The association of these radiologic findings within the posterior distribution along with visual loss and seizures are unique to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Within 7 days, she regained motor function and vision and had no further seizure activity. At 6 months follow-up, physical examination revealed normal motor function and vision and a repeat MR showed near resolution of the previous findings with minimal occipital lobe gliosis.

A current model proposes autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a developmental disconnection syndrome, supported by converging evidence in both non-syndromic and syndromic ASD. However, the effects of abnormal connectivity on network properties have not been well studied, particularly in syndromic ASD. To close this gap, brain functional networks of electroencephalographic (EEG) connectivity were studied through graph measures in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), a disorder with a high prevalence of ASD, as well as in patients with non-syndromic ASD. Methods EEG data were collected from TSC patients with ASD (n = 14) and without ASD (n = 29), from patients with non-syndromic ASD (n = 16), and from controls (n = 46). First, EEG connectivity was characterized by the mean coherence, the ratio of inter- over intra-hemispheric coherence and the ratio of long- over short-range coherence. Next, graph measures of the functional networks were computed and a resilience analysis was conducted. To distinguish effects related to ASD from those related to TSC, a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied, using age as a covariate. Results Analysis of network properties revealed differences specific to TSC and ASD, and these differences were very consistent across subgroups. In TSC, both with and without a concurrent diagnosis of ASD, mean coherence, global efficiency, and clustering coefficient were decreased and the average path length was increased. These findings indicate an altered network topology. In ASD, both with and without a concurrent diagnosis of TSC, decreased long- over short-range coherence and markedly increased network resilience were found. Conclusions The altered network topology in TSC represents a functional correlate of structural abnormalities and may play a\n\nConcurrent Van der Woude syndrome and Turner syndrome: A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nLos, Evan; Baines, Hayley; Guttmann-Bauman, Ines\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMost cases of Van der Woude syndrome are caused by a mutation to interferon regulatory factor 6 on chromosome 1. Turner syndrome is caused by complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome in girls. We describe a unique case of the two syndromes occurring concurrently though apparently independently in a girl with Van der Woude syndrome diagnosed at birth and Turner syndrome at 14âyears 9âmonths. Short stature was initially misattributed to Van der Woude syndrome and pituitary insufficiency associated with clefts before correctly diagnosing Turner syndrome. We discuss the prevalence of delayed diagnosis of Turner syndrome, the rarity of reports of concurrent autosomal chromosome mutation and sex chromosome deletion, as well as the need to consider the diagnosis of Turner syndrome in all girls with short stature regardless of prior medical history.\n\nUnique autosomal recessive variant of palmoplantar keratoderma associated with hearing loss not caused by known mutations*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHegazi, Moustafa Abdelaal; Manou, Sommen; Sakr, Hazem; Camp, Guy Van\n\n2017-01-01\n\nInherited Palmoplantar Keratodermas are rare disorders of genodermatosis that are conventionally regarded as autosomal dominant in inheritance with extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity.

These previously normal children had no evidence of expressive aphasia during their symptomatic periods. Further, in both cases, auditory agnosia was associated with sleep-activated electroencephalographic (EEG) epileptiform activity, consistent with Landau-Kleffner syndrome. However, both cases are unique since the episodic auditory agnosia and sleep-activated EEG epileptiform activity rapidly responded to combination therapy with pulse benzodiazepine and corticosteroids. Further, in each case, recurrences were characterized by similar symptoms, EEG findings, and beneficial responses to the pulse benzodiazepine and corticosteroid therapy. These observations suggest that pulse combination high-dose corticosteroid and benzodiazepine therapy may be especially effective in Landau-Kleffner syndrome.
