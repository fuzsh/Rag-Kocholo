        "text": "Club career\n\nBorn in Rosario, Santa Fe, Sarmiento began his career in Argentina with Estudiantes de La Plata, signing for La Liga side Racing de Santander in July 2007. A complicated transfer situation between both clubs, which involved the Court of Arbitration for Sport's mediation, meant that the 17-year-old spent the entire 2007–08 season without making a single first-team appearance.\n\nFor the 2008–09 campaign, Sarmiento was loaned to Xerez CD in Segunda División, first appearing officially in a 1–1 home draw against Real Murcia on 3 September 2008 for that year's Copa del Rey. Although not an undisputed starter, he did feature significantly as the Andalusians achieved a first-ever top flight promotion, earning the nickname Currito de Jerez by their fans in the process.\n\nOn 31 August 2009, Sarmiento went on another season-long loan, yet in the second level, now with Girona FC. He made his first appearance on 3 October in a 2–2 draw against SD Huesca, scoring his team's second goal, but was released by the Catalans in late January 2010 for disciplinary issues, subsequently training with former club Santander to stay fit.\n\nSarmiento spent 2010–11 with UD Salamanca, again on loan and in the Spanish division two. On 15 January 2011 he netted his first league for goal for the Castile and León team, but in 2–3 home loss to FC Barcelona B. On 1 March he scored the game's only goal at home against Villarreal CF B, helping the side to their first win in three months.\n\nInternational career"
