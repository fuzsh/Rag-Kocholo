        "text": "Lifetime Increased Risk of Adult Onset Atopic Dermatitis in Adolescent and Adult Patients with Food Allergy.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Hsu-Sheng; Tu, Hung-Pin; Hong, Chien-Hui; Lee, Chih-Hung\n\n2016-12-27\n\nFood allergy can result in life-threatening anaphylaxis. Atopic dermatitis (AD) causes intense itching and impaired quality of life. Previous studies have shown that patients with classical early-onset AD tend to develop food allergy and that 10% of adults with food allergies have concomitant AD. However, it is not known whether late-onset food allergy leads to adult-onset AD, a recently recognized disease entity. Using an initial cohort of one-million subjects, this study retrospectively followed-up 2851 patients with food allergy (age > 12 years) for 14 years and compared them with 11,404 matched controls. While 2.8% (81) of the 2851 food allergy patients developed AD, only 2.0% (227) of the 11,404 controls developed AD. Multivariate regression analysis showed that food allergy patients were more likely to develop AD (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.49, p < 0.0001). Controls had a 1.99% risk of developing AD, while food allergy patients had a significantly higher risk (7.18% and 3.46% for patients with â¥3 and <3 food allergy claims, respectively) of developing adult-onset AD. This is the first study to describe the chronological and dose-dependent associations between food allergy in adolescence and the development of adult-onset AD.\n\nNurse Value-Added and Patient Outcomes in Acute Care\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYakusheva, Olga; Lindrooth, Richard; Weiss, Marianne\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective The aims of the study were to (1) estimate the relative nurse effectiveness, or individual nurse value-added (NVA), to patientsâ clinical condition change during hospitalization; (2) examine nurse characteristics contributing to NVA; and (3) estimate the contribution of value-added nursing care to patient outcomes. Data Sources/Study Setting Electronic data on 1,203 staff nurses matched with 7,318 adult medicalâsurgical patients discharged between July 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011 from an urban Magnet-designated, 854-bed teaching hospital. Study Design Retrospective observational longitudinal analysis using a covariate-adjustment value-added model with nurse fixed effects. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Data were extracted from the study hospital's electronic patient records and human resources databases. Principal Findings Nurse effects were jointly significant and explained 7.9 percent of variance in patient clinical condition change during hospitalization. NVA was positively associated with having a baccalaureate degree or higher (0.55, pÂ =Â .04) and expertise level (0.66, pÂ =Â .03). NVA contributed to patient outcomes of shorter length of stay and lower costs. Conclusions Nurses differ in their value-added to patient outcomes. The ability to measure individual nurse relative value-added opens the possibility for development of performance metrics, performance-based rankings, and merit-based salary schemes to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. PMID:25256089\n\nDupilumab therapy provides clinically meaningful improvement in patient-reported outcomes (PROs): A phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD).\n\nPubMed\n\nSimpson, Eric L; Gadkari, Abhijit; Worm, Margitta; Soong, Weily; Blauvelt, Andrew; Eckert, Laurent; Wu, Richard; Ardeleanu, Marius; Graham, Neil M H; Pirozzi, Gianluca; Sutherland, E Rand; Mastey, Vera\n\n2016-09-01\n\nModerate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with substantial patient burden despite current therapies. We sought to evaluate dupilumab treatment on patient-reported outcomes in adults with moderate to severe AD. Adults (NÂ =Â 380) with moderate to severe AD inadequately controlled by topical medications were randomized to 16Â weeks of double-blind, subcutaneous treatment with dupilumab 100Â mg every 4Â weeks, 200Â mg every 2Â weeks, 300Â mg every 2Â weeks, 300Â mg once weekly, or placebo. Patient-reported outcomes included pruritus numeric rating scale; patient-reported sleep item on Scoring AD scale; Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Dermatology Life Quality Index; and 5-dimension 3-level EuroQol. Dupilumab reduced peak itch at 16Â weeks relative to placebo by 1.1 to 3.2 points on numeric rating scale (PÂ <Â .0001 all doses, except 100Â mg every 4Â weeks P < .05); improved sleep and health-related quality of life on Dermatology Life Quality Index and 5-dimension 3-level EuroQol (PÂ <Â .05 all doses, except 100Â mg every 4Â weeks); and reduced anxiety and depression symptoms (PÂ <Â .05 all doses). Dupilumab's effects appeared early and achieved clinically relevant improvements without significant safety concerns. There are potential cultural differences affecting patient-reported outcome responses. Outcomes were secondary or exploratory end points. Dupilumab produced early and sustained patient-reported and clinically relevant improvements in sleep, mental health, and health-related quality of life; the two 300-mg dose regimens resulted in greatest benefits.

The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks provided one such opportunity. Patients with AD, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy older adults were given a telephone questionnaire in the initial weeks after the event, again three to four months later, and finally one year afterwards to evaluate their memory for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. We were particularly interested in using the attacks as an opportunity to examine the decline of episodic memory in patients with AD, patients with MCI, and older adult controls over a period of months. We found that compared to healthy older adults, patients with AD and MCI showed impaired memory at the initial time point, more rapid forgetting from the initial to the three-month time point, and very similar changes in memory from the three-month to the one-year time point. We speculated that these findings were consistent with patients with AD and MCI showing initial impaired encoding and a more rapid rate of forgetting compared with healthy older adults, but that once the memories had been consolidated, their decay rate became similar to that of healthy older adults. Lastly, although memory distortions were common among all groups, they were greatest in the patients with AD.\n\nThe Effect of Comparatively-Framed versus Similarity-Framed E-Cigarette and Snus Print Ads on Young Adults' Ad and Product Perceptions.\n\nPubMed\n\nBanerjee, Smita C; Greene, Kathryn; Li, Yuelin; Ostroff, Jamie S\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThis study examined the effects of comparative-framing [C-F; ads highlighting differences between the advertised product and conventional cigarettes and/or smokeless tobacco products] versus similarity-framing (S-F; ads highlighting congruence with conventional cigarettes and/or smokeless tobacco products) in e-cigarette and snus ads on young adult smokers' and non-smokers' ad- and product-related perceptions. One thousand fifty one (1,051) young adults (18-24 years; 76% women; 50% smokers) from existing consumer panels were recruited in a within-subjects quasi-experiment. Each participant viewed 4 online advertisements, varied by tobacco product type (e-cigarette or snus) and ad framing (C-F or S-F). The dependent measures for this study were ad-related (ad perceptions, ad credibility) and product-related perceptions (absolute and comparative risk perceptions, product appeal, and product use intentions). Former and current smokers rated C-F ads as more persuasive than S-F ads, as evidenced by favorable ad perceptions and high product use intentions. Former and current smokers also rated e-cigarette ads with more favorable ad perceptions, low absolute and comparative risk perceptions, high product appeal, and high product use intentions as compared to snus ads. However, the effect sizes of the significant differences are less than.2, indicating small magnitude of difference between the study variables. Unless FDA regulates e-cig and snus advertising, there is a potential of decreasing risk perceptions and increasing use of e-cigs among young adults. Further research on implicit/explicit comparative claims in e-cigarettes and snus advertisements that encourage risk misperceptions is recommended.\n\nAdded sugars: consumption and associated factors among adults and the elderly. SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nBueno, Milena Baptista; Marchioni, Dirce Maria Lobo; CÃ©sar, Chester Luis GalvÃ£o; Fisberg, Regina Mara\n\n2012-06-01\n\nTo investigate added sugar intake, main dietary sources and factors associated with excessive intake of added sugar. A population-based household survey was carried out in SÃ£o Paulo, the largest city in Brazil. Cluster sampling was performed and the study sample comprised 689 adults and 622 elderly individuals. Dietary intake was estimated based on a 24-hour food recall. Usual nutrient intake was estimated by correcting for the within-person variance of intake using the Iowa State University (ISU) method. Linear regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with added sugar intake. Average of energy intake (EI) from added sugars was 9.1% (95% CI: 8.9%; 9.4%) among adults and 8.4% (95% CI: 8.2%; 8.7%) among the elderly (p < 0.05). Average added sugar intake (% EI) was higher among women than among men (p < 0.05). Soft drink was the main source of added sugar among adults, while table sugar was the main source of added sugar among the elderly. Added sugar intake increased with age among adults. Moreover, higher socioeconomic level was associated with added sugar intake in the same group. Added sugar intake is higher among younger adults of higher socioeconomic level. Soft drink and table sugar accounted for more than 50% of the sugar consumed.\n\nProspective association between added sugars and frailty in older adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaclaustra, Martin; Rodriguez-Artalejo, Fernando; Guallar-Castillon, Pilar; Banegas, Jose R; Graciani, Auxiliadora; Garcia-Esquinas, Esther; Ordovas, Jose; Lopez-Garcia, Esther\n\n2018-05-01\n\nSugar-sweetened beverages and added sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) in the diet are associated with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which are all risk factors for decline in physical function among older adults. The aim of this study was to examine the association between added sugars in the diet and incidence of frailty in older people. Data were taken from 1973 Spanish adults â¥60 y old from the Seniors-ENRICA cohort. In 2008-2010 (baseline), consumption of added sugars (including those in fruit juices) was obtained using a validated diet history. Study participants were followed up until 2012-2013 to assess frailty based on Fried's criteria. Statistical analyses were performed with logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking status, body mass index, energy intake, self-reported comorbidities, Mediterranean Diet Adherence Score (excluding sweetened drinks and pastries), TV watching time, and leisure-time physical activity. Compared with participants consuming <15 g/d added sugars (lowest tertile), those consuming â¥36 g/d (highest tertile) were more likely to develop frailty (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.34, 3.90; P-trendÂ =Â 0.003). The frailty components \"low physical activity\" and \"unintentional weight loss\" increased dose dependently with added sugars. Association with frailty was strongest for sugars added during food production. Intake of sugars naturally appearing in foods was not associated with frailty. The consumption of added sugars in the diet of older people was associated with frailty, mainly when present in processed foods. The frailty components that were most closely associated with added sugars were low level of physical activity and unintentional weight loss. Future research should determine whether there is a causal relation between added sugars and frailty.\n\nSources of Added Sugars in Young Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Low and High Intakes of Added Sugars\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFulgoni, Victor L.; Cowan, Alexandra E.; Gaine, P. Courtney\n\n2018-01-01\n\nHigh intake of added sugars is associated with excess energy intake and poorer diet quality. The objective of this cross-sectional study (n = 16,806) was to estimate usual intakes and the primary food sources of added sugars across the range of intakes (i.e., deciles) among U.S. children (2â8 years), adolescents and teens (9â18 years), and adults (â¥19 years) using the National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES) data from 2009â2012. The percent energy contributed by added sugars was 14.3 Â± 0.2% (2â8 years), 16.2 Â± 0.2% (9â18 years), and 13.1 Â± 0.2% (â¥19 years), suggesting the highest intakes are among adolescents and teens. However, the primary foods/beverages that contribute to added sugars were remarkably consistent across the range of intakes, with the exception of the lowest decile, and include sweetened beverages and sweet bakery products. Interestingly across all age groups, even those in the lowest decile of added sugars exceed the 10% guidelines. Additional foods contributing to high intakes were candy and other desserts (e.g., ice cream) in children and adolescents, and coffee and teas in adults. Tailoring public health messaging to reduce intakes of these identified food groups may be of utility in designing effective strategies to reduce added sugar intake in the U.S. PMID:29342109\n\nSources of Added Sugars in Young Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Low and High Intakes of Added Sugars.\n\nPubMed\n\nBailey, Regan L; Fulgoni, Victor L; Cowan, Alexandra E; Gaine, P Courtney\n\n2018-01-17\n\nHigh intake of added sugars is associated with excess energy intake and poorer diet quality.

The objective was to evaluate the sources of added sugars in the diets of a representative sample of US children and adults by food purchase location and food source (eg, food group). This cross-sectional study among 31,035 children, adolescents, and adults aged â¥6 y from the 2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010 NHANES used data from a 24-h dietary recall to evaluate consumption of added sugars. Food locations of origin were identified as stores (supermarket or grocery store), quick-service restaurants/pizza (QSRs), full-service restaurants (FSRs), schools, and others (eg, vending machines or gifts). Added sugars consumption by food purchase location was evaluated by age, family income-to-poverty ratio, and race-ethnicity. Food group sources of added sugars were identified by using the National Cancer Institute food categories. Added sugars accounted for â¼14.1% of total dietary energy. Between 65% and 76% of added sugars came from stores, 6% and 12% from QSRs, and 4% and 6% from FSRs, depending on age. Older adults (aged â¥51 y) obtained a significantly greater proportion of added sugars from stores than did younger adults. Lower-income adults obtained a significantly greater proportion of added sugars from stores than did higher-income adults. Intake of added sugars did not vary by family income among children/adolescents. Soda and energy and sports drinks were the largest food group sources of added sugars (34.4%), followed by grain desserts (12.7%), fruit drinks (8.0%), candy (6.7%), and dairy desserts (5.6%). Most added sugars came from foods obtained from stores. The proposed changes to the Nutrition Facts Label should capture the bulk of added sugars in the US food supply, which suggests that the recommended changes have the potential to reduce added sugars consumption.

In-person interviews of 170 older adults revealed that those with low subjective health literacy evaluated the educational value of DTC ads significantly lower than did those with high subjective health literacy. The results prompt us to pay more scholarly attention to determining how effectively DTC ads convey useful medical information, particularly to those with limited health literacy.\n\nApproximate Quantification in Young, Healthy Older Adults', and Alzheimer Patients\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGandini, Delphine; Lemaire, Patrick; Michel, Bernard Francois\n\n2009-01-01\n\nForty young adults, 40 healthy older adults, and 39 probable AD patients were asked to estimate small (e.g., 25) and large (e.g., 60) collections of dots in a choice condition and in two no-choice conditions.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 recommends limiting total intake of discretionary calories, including both added sugars and solid fats, to 5%-15% per day (4). Recent analyses indicate that children and adolescents obtain approximately 16% of their total caloric intake from added sugars (5).

Use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in pediatric patients with Down syndrome has been described, but minimal data exist for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in adults with Down syndrome. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and to determine if there were differences between adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients with Down syndrome that were alive (aDS) versus those that died (dDS) prior to hospital discharge. Patients with Down syndrome that were 18 years and older registered in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry from 1983 to 2016 were analyzed. Demographics and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation characteristics were recorded. A total of 21 adults with Down syndrome were identified. Incidence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in adults with Down syndrome was 0.88 per 1000 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedures. Hospital mortality was 57.1% (12/21). There were no significant differences between aDS versus dDS for age (24.9âÂ±â4.8 vs. 28.1âÂ±â10.2 years), weight (90.7âÂ±â13.0 vs. 79.1âÂ±â27.0 kg), gender (4 males vs. 8 males), initial pH (7.18âÂ±â0.19 vs. 7.27âÂ±â0.16), or initial pO2 (51.7âÂ±â13.9 vs. 45.4âÂ±â19.9), respectively. There were no significant differences between aDS versus dDS in duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation run (239âÂ±â159 h vs. 455âÂ±â570 h, respectively), ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation mode, and nitric oxide use. aDS had fewer incidences of mechanical and neurologic complications (41.7% vs. 0.0%, Pâ<â0.05) versus dDS.

However, AD may persist until adulthood (persistent AD), or directly start in adults (adult-onset AD). AD often shows a non-flexural rash distribution, and atypical morphologic variants in adults and specific diagnostic criteria are lacking. Moreover, adult AD prevalence as well as detailed data which can characterize persistent vs adult-onset subtype are scant. The aim of this study was to investigate on the main features of adult AD particularly highlighting differences between persistent vs adult-onset form. An Italian multicentre observational study was conducted between April 2015-July 2016 through a study-specific digital database. 253 adult AD patients were enrolled. Familiar history of AD was negative in 81.0%. Erythemato-desquamative pattern was the most frequent clinical presentation (74.3%). Flexural surface of upper limbs was most commonly involved (47.8%), followed by eyelid/periocular area (37.9%), hands (37.2%), and neck (32%). Hypertension (7.1%) and thyroiditis (4.3%) were the most frequent comorbidities. A subgroup analysis between persistent (59.7%) vs adult-onset AD patients (40.3%) showed significant results only regarding AD severity (severe disease was more common in persistent group, pÂ <Â 0.05), itch intensity (higher in adult-onset disease), and comorbidities (hypertension was more frequent in adult-onset group, pÂ <Â 0.01). Adult AD showed uncommon features such as significant association with negative AD family history and lacking of association with systemic comorbidities respect to general population. No significant differences among persistent vs adult-onset subgroup were registered except for hypertension, itch intensity, and disease severity.\n\nKetamine added to morphine or hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia for acute postoperative pain in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Li; Johnston, Bradley; Kaushal, Alka; Cheng, Davy; Zhu, Fang; Martin, Janet\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTo determine whether ketamine added to morphine or hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) provides clinically relevant reductions in postoperative pain, opioid requirements, and adverse events when compared with morphine or hydromorphone PCA in adults undergoing surgery. We systematically searched six databases up to June 2, 2015 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ketamine plus morphine/hydromorphone PCA vs morphine/hydromorphone PCA for postoperative pain in adults. Thirty-six RCTs including 2,502 patients proved eligible, and 22 of these were at low risk of bias. The addition of ketamine to morphine/hydromorphone PCA decreased postoperative pain intensity at six to 72 hr when measured at rest (weighted mean difference [WMD] on a 10-cm visual analogue scale ranged from -0.4 to -1.3 cm) and during mobilization (WMD ranged from -0.4 to -0.5 cm). Adjunctive ketamine also significantly reduced cumulative morphine consumption at 24-72 hr by approximately 5-20 mg. Predefined subgroup analyses and meta-regression did not detect significant differences across subgroups, including a dose-response relationship. There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction scores at 24 and 48 hr. Nevertheless, the addition of ketamine to morphine/hydromorphone PCA significantly reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting (relative risk, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 0.85; absolute risk reduction, 8.9%; 95% CI, 4.6 to 12.2). Significant effects on other adverse events (e.g., hallucinations, vivid dreams) were not detected, though only a few studies reported on them. Adding ketamine to morphine/hydromorphone PCA provides a small improvement in postoperative analgesia while reducing opioid requirements. Adjunctive ketamine also reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting without a detected increase in other adverse effects; however, adverse events were probably underreported.\n\nEffects of structured patient education in adults with atopic dermatitis: Multicenter randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeratizadeh, Annice; Werfel, Thomas; Wollenberg, Andreas; Abraham, Susanne; Plank-Habibi, Sibylle; Schnopp, Christina; Sticherling, Michael; Apfelbacher, Christian; Biedermann, Tilo; Breuer, Kristine; Fell, Isabel; FÃ¶lster-Holst, Regina; Heine, Guido; Grimm, Jennifer; Hennighausen, Lars; Kugler, Claudia; Reese, Imke; Ring, Johannes; SchÃ¤kel, Knut; Schmitt, Jochen; Seikowski, Kurt; von Stebut, Esther; Wagner, Nicola; WaÃmann-Otto, Anja; Wienke-Graul, Ute; Weisshaar, Elke; Worm, Margitta; Gieler, Uwe; Kupfer, Joerg\n\n2017-09-01\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing skin disease prevalent in 1% to 3% of adults in Western industrialized countries. We sought to investigate the effectiveness of educational training in an outpatient setting on coping with the disease, quality of life, symptoms, and severity in adults with AD. In this German prospective, randomized controlled multicenter study, adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD were educated by referring to a comprehensive 12-hour training manual consented by a multiprofessional study group from different centers (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Neurodermitisschulung fÃ¼r Erwachsene [ARNE]). Patients were randomly allocated to the intervention or waiting control groups. Study visits were performed at baseline and after 1Â year (1Â year of follow-up). Primary outcomes were defined as a decrease in (1) \"catastrophizing cognitions\" with respect to itching (Juckreiz-Kognitions-Fragebogen questionnaire), (2) \"social anxiety\" (Marburger Hautfragebogen questionnaire), (3) subjective burden by symptoms of the disease (Skindex-29 questionnaire), and (4) improvement of disease signs and symptoms assessed by using the SCORAD index at 1Â year of follow-up. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. At 1Â year of follow-up, patients from the intervention group (nÂ =Â 168) showed a significantly better improvement compared with the waiting group (nÂ =Â 147) in the following defined primary study outcomes: coping behavior with respect to itching (PÂ <Â .001), quality of life assessed by using the Skindex-29 questionnaire (PÂ <Â .001), and the SCORAD index (PÂ <Â .001). This is the first randomized, controlled multicenter study on patient education in adult AD. The ARNE training program shows significant beneficial effects on a variety of psychosocial parameters, as well as AD severity. Copyright Â© 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The present study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), a new questionnaire specifically tailored to assess subthreshold forms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in adulthood. 102 adults endorsing at least one DSM-5 symptom criterion for ASD (ASDc), 143 adults diagnosed with a feeding and eating disorder (FED), and 160 subjects with no mental disorders (CTL), were recruited from 7 Italian University Departments of Psychiatry and administered the following: SCID-5, Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale 14-item version (RAADS-14), and AdAS Spectrum. The AdAS Spectrum demonstrated excellent internal consistency for the total score (Kuder-Richardson's coefficient=.964) as well as for five out of seven domains (all coefficients>.80) and sound test-retest reliability (ICC=.976). The total and domain AdAS Spectrum scores showed a moderate to strong (>.50) positive correlation with one another and with the AQ and RAADS-14 total scores. ASDc subjects reported significantly higher AdAS Spectrum total scores than both FED (p<.001) and CTL (p<.001), and significantly higher scores on the Childhood/adolescence, Verbal communication, Empathy, Inflexibility and adherence to routine, and Restricted interests and rumination domains (all p<.001) than FED, while on all domains compared to CTL. CTL displayed significantly lower total and domain scores than FED (all p<.001). A significant effect of gender emerged for the Hyper- and hyporeactivity to sensory input domain, with women showing higher scores than men (p=.003). A Diagnosis* Gender interaction was also found for the Verbal communication (p=.019) and Empathy (p=.023) domains. When splitting the ASDc in subjects with one symptom criterion (ASD 1 ) and those with a ASD, and the FED in subjects with no ASD symptom criteria (FED 0 ) and those with\n\nAd hoc vs. Non-ad hoc Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Strategies in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nToyota, Toshiaki; Morimoto, Takeshi; Shiomi, Hiroki; Ando, Kenji; Ono, Koh; Shizuta, Satoshi; Kato, Takao; Saito, Naritatsu; Furukawa, Yutaka; Nakagawa, Yoshihisa; Horie, Minoru; Kimura, Takeshi\n\n2017-03-24\n\nFew studies have evaluated the prevalence and clinical outcomes of ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), performing diagnostic coronary angiography and PCI in the same session, in stable coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.MethodsâandâResults:From the CREDO-Kyoto PCI/CABG registry cohort-2, 6,943 patients were analyzed as having stable CAD and undergoing first PCI. Ad hoc PCI and non-ad hoc PCI were performed in 1,722 (24.8%) and 5,221 (75.1%) patients, respectively. The cumulative 5-year incidence and adjusted risk for all-cause death were not significantly different between the 2 groups (15% vs. 15%, P=0.53; hazard ratio: 1.15, 95% confidence interval: 0.98-1.35, P=0.08). Ad hoc PCI relative to non-ad hoc PCI was associated with neutral risk for myocardial infarction, any coronary revascularization, and bleeding, but was associated with a trend towards lower risk for stroke (hazard ratio: 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.60-1.02, P=0.06). Ad hoc PCI in stable CAD patients was associated with at least comparable 5-year clinical outcomes as with non-ad hoc PCI. Considering patients' preference and the cost-saving, the ad hoc PCI strategy might be a safe and attractive option for patients with stable CAD, although the prevalence of ad hoc PCI was low in the current study population.\n\nSense of coherence, depression, and anger among adults with atopic dermatitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakaki, Hiroko; Ishii, Yasutomo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe prevalence of atopic disease (AD) in adults has significantly increased in industrialized countries. Psychological traits and lack of skills to cope with stress could be maintaining factors of AD. The first aim of the present study was to compare sense of coherence (SOC), depression, and anger among adult patients with AD, adults with remission from AD, and adults without AD. The second aim was to explore whether depression and anger have significant impacts on SOC. A cross-sectional survey was carried out from May to September of 2007. In total, 43 adult patients with AD, 32 adults with remission from AD, and 63 adults without AD participated. A one-way analysis of variance showed that adult patients with AD have significantly higher levels of depression than adults with remission from AD and adults without AD. Furthermore, structural equation modeling indicated a significant impact of depression on SOC across the three groups, along with a significant impact of anger suppression on depression, particularly in adult patients with AD. The findings of this study suggest that psychological traits have a negative impact on skills for coping with stress, and that this relationship might be a contributory factor for maintenance of AD.\n\nAdded Sugars Intake Across the Distribution of US Children and Adult Consumers: 1977-2012.\n\nPubMed\n\nPowell, Elyse S; Smith-Taillie, Lindsey P; Popkin, Barry M\n\n2016-10-01\n\nPublic health organizations in the United States have recently increased focus on reducing population consumption of added sugars. The objective of this study is to provide in-depth information on national trends in added sugars consumption and to examine both the mean and distribution of added sugars intake from 1977 toÂ 2012. We conducted a descriptive study using six cross-sectional nationally representative surveys of food intake in the United States: the 1977-1978 National Food Consumption Survey (n=29,668), the 1989-1991 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (n=14,827), the 1994-1998 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (n=19,027), the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n=8,273), the 2009-2010 NHANES (n=9,042), and the 2011-2012 NHANES (n=16,451). We examined the key dependent variables, calories from added sugars and percentage of total energy intake from added sugars, at the mean and by quintiles of added sugars consumption for children (2 to 18 years) and adults (19 years and older) across the survey years. We also examined trends in added sugars intakes from foods and beverages. We used ordinary least squares regression to examine linear trends between survey years and multinomial logistic regressions to examine sociodemographic characteristics by quintile of added sugars consumption. We adjusted estimates by race, income, sex, and education. The US mean adjusted intake of added sugars remains high. In 2011-2012, children and adults consumed 326 kcal/day and 308 kcal/day, respectively, of added sugars, or 14% and 17%, respectively, of total their energy. For both children and adults, there was a considerable increase in calories from added sugars from 1977 to 2003, followed by a substantial decline from 2003 to 2012. There was no decline in the percentage of total energy intake from added sugars from 2003 to 2012. Changes over time were consistent across each quintile of added sugars consumption.

However, the effects of ADS on airway inflammation remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of exposure to ADS with airway inflammation. The subjects were 33 adult patients with asthma who measured daily peak flow expiratory (PEF) from March to May 2012. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was measured before and after ADS. The FeNO values were 13.8Â±13.7 ppb before the ADS and 20.3Â±19.0 ppb after the ADS, with no significant difference. There was also no significant association of PEF with ADS exposure. However, the increase of FeNO after ADS exposure was proportional to the decrease of PEF (R=-0.78, P<0.0001). These results suggest that airway inflammation aggravated by ADS exposure may induce a decrease in pulmonary function in some adult patients with asthma.\n\nUsefulness of Sweat Management for Patients with Adult Atopic Dermatitis, regardless of Sweat Allergy: A Pilot Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaneko, Sakae; Murota, Hiroyuki; Murata, Susumu; Katayama, Ichiro; Morita, Eishin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground . Sweat is an aggravating factor in atopic dermatitis (AD), regardless of age. Sweat allergy may be involved in AD aggravated by sweating. Objective. We investigated whether sweat exacerbates adult AD symptoms and examined the extent of sweat allergy's involvement. Method. We asked 34 AD patients (17 men, 17 women; mean age: 27.8 years) to record the extent to which sweat aggravated their symptoms on a 10-point numerical scale. Participant responses were compared with histamine release tests (HRT). Furthermore, 24 of the patients received instructions on methods of sweat management, and their outcomes were evaluated on a 10-point scale. Results. Sweat HRT results were class â¥ 2 in 13 patients, but HRT results were not correlated with the patients' self-assessments of symptom aggravation by sweat. One month after receiving sweat management instructions, a low mean score of 4.6 was obtained regarding whether active sweating was good, but a high mean score of 7.0 was obtained in response to whether the sweat management instructions had been helpful. Conclusion . Our investigation showed that patients' negative impressions of sweat might derive from crude personal experiences that are typically linked to sweating. Sweat management for patients with adult atopic dermatitis was extremely useful regardless of sweat allergy.\n\nIgE Sensitization Profiles Differ between Adult Patients with Severe and Moderate Atopic Dermatitis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJohansson, Catharina; Lupinek, Christian; Lundeberg, Lena; Crameri, Reto; Valenta, Rudolf; Scheynius, Annika\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex chronic inflammatory disease where allergens can act as specific triggering factors. Aim To characterize the specificities of IgE-reactivity in patients with AD to a broad panel of exogenous allergens including microbial and human antigens. Methodology Adult patients with AD were grouped according to the SCORAD index, into severe (n = 53) and moderate AD (n = 126). As controls 43 patients were included with seborrhoeic eczema and 97 individuals without history of allergy or skin diseases. Specific IgE reactivity was assessed in plasma using PhadiatopÂ®, ImmunoCapâ¢, micro-arrayed allergens, dot-blotted recombinant Malassezia sympodialis allergens, and immune-blotted microbial and human proteins. Results IgE reactivity was detected in 92% of patients with severe and 83% of patients with moderate AD. Sensitization to cat allergens occurred most frequently, followed by sensitization to birch pollen, grass pollen, and to the skin commensal yeast M. sympodialis. Patients with severe AD showed a significantly higher frequency of IgE reactivity to allergens like cat (rFel d 1) and house dust mite (rDer p 4 and 10), to Staphylococcus aureus, M. sympodialis, and to human antigens. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of IgE reactivity to the grass pollen allergens rPhl p 1, 2, 5b, and 6 between the two AD groups. Furthermore the IgE reactivity profile of patients with severe AD was more spread towards several different allergen molecules as compared to patients with moderate AD. Conclusion We have revealed a hitherto unknown difference regarding the molecular sensitization profile in patients with severe and moderate AD. Molecular profiling towards allergen components may provide a basis for future investigations aiming to explore the environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors which could be responsible for the different appearance and severity of disease phenotypes in AD.

The concentration of AD is typically expressed in particulate matter less than 10Â Î¼m (PM10) and 2.5Â Î¼m (PM2.5). However, PM10 and PM2.5 consist of various substances besides AD. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems can selectively measure the quantity of AD particles to distinguish non-spherical airborne particles from spherical airborne particles. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between pulmonary function in adult asthma patients and AD using LIDAR data. Subjects were 231 adult asthma patients who had their morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) measured from March to May 2012. A linear mixed model was used to estimate the association of PEF with sand dust particles detected by LIDAR. Increases in the interquartile range of AD particles (0.018Â km(-1)) led to changes in PEF ofÂ -0.42Â L/min (95% confidence interval [CI],Â -0.85 to 0.01). An increase of 11.8Â Î¼g/m(3) in suspended particulate matter and 6.9Â Î¼g/m(3) in PM2.5 led to decreases ofÂ -0.17Â L/min (-0.53 to 0.21) and 0.03Â L/min (-0.35 to 0.42), respectively. A heavy AD day was defined as a day with a level of AD particles >0.032Â km(-1), which was the average plus one standard deviation during the study period, and six heavy AD days were identified. Change in PEF after a heavy AD day wasÂ -0.97Â L/min (-1.90 toÂ -0.04). Heavy exposure to AD particles was significantly associated with decreased pulmonary function in adult asthma patients.

AD significantly affects the quality of life. Not all patients respond to topical therapies, and often systemic therapy is required to control the disease. To review the treatment options for adult AD patients including those options for patients who do not respond adequately or have contraindications to oral systemic therapy. A working group of clinicians with experience managing AD was convened to review the current literature on treatment options for adult AD patients. This review is based on the best available evidence from a published systematic review and an additional literature search. Current treatments for AD are reviewed, including options for adult AD patients who do not respond or have contraindications to current systemic therapies. A new approach with targeted therapies is reviewed based on best available evidence. Many AD patients respond satisfactorily to topical or systemic treatments, but for those patients who do not respond or have contraindications, new biologic agents appear to be promising therapies.\n\nPrevalence and clinical characteristics of adult-onset atopic dermatitis with positive skin prick testing to mites.\n\nPubMed\n\nKulthanan, Kanokvalai; Chularojanamontri, Leena; Manapajon, Araya; Nuchkull, Piyavadee\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe clinical role of house dust mite (HDM) in atopic dermatitis (AD) is still controversial. The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence, clinical relevance and characteristics of adult-onset AD patients with positive skin prick tests (SPT) to mites. The case record forms of adult-onset AD patients who underwent SPT at the Skin Allergy Clinic, Siriraj Hospital were reviewed. Forty-one of 62 patients (66.1%) had positive SPT to mites. The frequency of intrinsic AD among adult-onset AD was 4.8% (3/62). SPT to HDM tended to be positive in patients who had personal or family history of atopy, positive SPT to several specific antigens or who presented with elevated serum IgE, chelitis, recurrent conjunctivitis and perifollicular accentuation, respectively. CONCLUSION The prevalence of adult-onset AD patients with mite sensitivity was high. There were some notable features that tended to be present in mite sensitive adult-onset AD patients.\n\nFamiliarity-based memory as an early cognitive marker of preclinical and prodromal AD\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWolk, David A.; Mancuso, Lauren; Kliot, Daria; Arnold, Steven E.; Dickerson, Bradford C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThere is great interest in the development of cognitive markers that differentiate ânormalâ age-associated cognitive change from that of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its prodromal (i.e., mild cognitive impairment; MCI) or even preclinical stages. Dual process models posit that recognition memory is supported by the dissociable processes of recollection and familiarity. Familiarity-based memory has generally been considered to be spared during normal aging, but it remains controversial whether this type of memory is impaired in early AD. Here, we describe findings of estimates of recollection and familiarity in young adults (YA), cognitively normal older adults (CN), and patients with amnestic-MCI (a-MCI). These measures in the CN and a-MCI patients were then related to a structural imaging biomarker of AD that has previously been demonstrated to be sensitive to preclinical and prodromal AD, the Cortical Signature of AD (ADsig). Consistent with much work in the literature, recollection, but not familiarity, was impaired in CN versus YA. Replicating our prior findings, a-MCI patients displayed impairment in both familiarity and recollection. Finally, the familiarity measure was correlated with the ADsig biomarker across the CN and a-MCI group, as well as within the CN adults alone. No other standard psychometric measure was as highly associated with the ADsig, suggesting that familiarity may be a sensitive biomarker of AD-specific brain changes in preclinical and prodromal AD and that it may offer a qualitatively distinct measure of early AD memory impairment relative to normal age-associated change.

Clinical practice models also continue to evolve, with more disciplines prescribing parenteral nutrition (PN) or managing the cases of patients who are receiving it, further adding to the need for proficiency in general PN skills. This tutorial focuses on the daily management of adult hospitalized patients already receiving PN and reviews the following topics: (1) PN basics, including the determination of energy and volume requirements; (2) PN macronutrient content (protein, dextrose, and intravenous fat emulsion); (3) PN micronutrient content (electrolytes, minerals, vitamins, and trace elements); (4) alteration of PN for special situations, such as obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, refeeding, and hepatic/renal disease; (5) daily monitoring and adjustment of PN formula; and (6) PN-related complications (PN-associated liver disease and catheter-related complications).\n\nSociodemographic and Behavioral Factors Associated with Added Sugars Intake among US Adults\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPark, Sohyun; Thompson, Frances E.; McGuire, Lisa C.; Pan, Liping; Galuska, Deborah A.; Blanck, Heidi M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Reducing added sugars intake is one of the Healthy People 2020 objectives. High added sugars intake may be associated with adverse health consequences. Objective This cross-sectional study identified sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics associated with added sugars intake among US adults (18 years and older) using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey data (n=24,967). Methods The outcome variable was added sugars intake from foods and beverages using scoring algorithms to convert dietary screener frequency responses on nine items to estimates of individual dietary intake of added sugars in teaspoons per day. Added sugars intake was categorized into tertiles (lowest, middle, highest) stratified by sex. The explanatory variables were sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios for the highest and middle tertile added sugars intake groups as compared with the lowest tertile group. Results Estimated median added sugars intake was 17.6 tsp/d for men and 11.7 tsp/d for women. For men and women, those who had significantly greater odds for being in the highest tertile of added sugars intake (men: â¥22.0 tsp/d; women: â¥14.6 tsp/d) were younger, less educated, had lower income, were less physically active, were current smokers, and were former or current infrequent/light drinkers, whereas non-Hispanic other/multiracial and those living in the West had significantly lower odds for being in the highest tertile of added sugars intake.

These conditions are risk factors for periodontal disease. However, the role of sugar intake in the cause of periodontal disease has not been adequately studied. We evaluated the association between the frequency of added sugar consumption and periodontal disease in young adults by using NHANES III data. Data from 2437 young adults (aged 18-25 y) who participated in NHANES III (1988-1994) were analyzed. We estimated the frequency of added sugar consumption by using food-frequency questionnaire responses. We considered periodontal disease to be present in teeth with bleeding on probing and a probing depth â¥3 mm at one or more sites. We evaluated this outcome as a discrete variable in Poisson regression models and as a categorical variable in multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for sex, age, race-ethnicity, education, poverty-income ratio, tobacco exposure, previous diagnosis of diabetes, and body mass index. A high consumption of added sugars was associated with a greater prevalence of periodontal disease in middle [prevalence ratio (PR): 1.39; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.89] and upper (PR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.85) tertiles of consumption in the adjusted Poisson regression model. The upper tertile of added sugar intake was associated with periodontal disease in â¥2 teeth (PR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.52) but not with periodontal disease in only one tooth (PR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.34) in the adjusted multinomial logistic regression model. A high frequency of consumption of added sugars is associated with periodontal disease, independent of traditional risk factors, suggesting that this consumption pattern may contribute to the systemic inflammation observed in periodontal disease and associated noncommunicable diseases.

MPH has shown to improve apathy in AD, and both apathy and attention have been related to dopaminergic function. The goal was to investigate MPH effects on attention in AD and assess the relationship between attention and apathy responses. MPH (10 mg PO twice daily) or placebo was administered for six weeks in a randomized, double-blind trial in mild-to-moderate AD outpatients with apathy (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Apathy â¥ 4). Attention was measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Digit Span (DS) subtest (DS forward, selective attention) and apathy with the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). A mixed effects linear regression estimated the difference in change from baseline between treatment groups, defined as Î´ (MPH (DS week 6-DS baseline)) - (placebo (DS week 6-DS baseline)). In 60 patients (37 females, age = 76 Â± 8, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) = 20 Â± 5, NPI Apathy = 7 Â± 2), the change in DS forward (Î´ = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.06-1.68), p = 0.03) and DS total (Î´ = 1.01 (95% CI: 0.09-1.93), p = 0.03) favored MPH over placebo. Of 57 completers, 17 patients had improved apathy (â¥3.3 points on the AES from baseline to end point) and 40 did not. There were no significant associations between AES and NPI Apathy with DS change scores in the MPH, placebo, AES responder, or non-responder groups. DS scores did not predict apathy response to MPH treatment. These results suggest MPH can improve attention and apathy in AD; however, the effects appear independent in this population.\n\nThe burden of atopic dermatitis in US adults: Health care resource utilization data from the 2013 National Health and Wellness Survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nEckert, Laurent; Gupta, Shaloo; Amand, Caroline; Gadkari, Abhijit; Mahajan, Puneet; Gelfand, Joel M\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThere is a lack of data on the burden of atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults relative to the general population. To characterize the AD burden in adult patients relative to both matched non-AD controls and matched patients with psoriasis in terms of comorbidities, health care resource utilization (HCRU), and costs. Adults (â¥18Â years) who self-reported a diagnosis of AD or psoriasis and adult non-AD controls were identified from the 2013 US National Health and Wellness Survey. Patients with AD were propensity score-matched with non-AD controls and patients with psoriasis on demographic variables. Patient-reported outcomes were analyzed between matched cohorts. Patients with AD had a significantly greater risk for atopic comorbidities, as well as significantly greater HCRU and total cost compared with non-AD controls. The burden of AD was generally comparable to that of psoriasis, although patients with AD reported increased use of emergency room visits compared with patients with psoriasis. Patient-reported data are susceptible to recall bias and erroneous classification. Adult patients with AD reported a substantial disease burden, suggesting an unmet need for more effective AD treatment options. Copyright Â© 2017 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

In this study, we assessed the earliest cortical changes associated with AD in 71 cognitively healthy, adult children of AD patients (AD offspring) as compared with 69 with no family history of AD (non-AD offspring). Cortical thickness measures were obtained using FreeSurfer from 1.5T magnetic resonance (MR) scans. ApoE genotyping was obtained. Primary analyses examined family history and ApoeE4 effects on cortical thickness. Secondary analyses examined age effects within groups. All comparisons were adjusted using False Discovery Rate at a significance threshold of p < 0.05. There were no statistically significant differences between family history and ApoE4 groups. Within AD offspring, increasing age was related to reduced cortical thickness (atrophy) over large areas of the precuneus, superior frontal and superior temporal gyri, starting at around age 60. Further, these patterns existed within female and maternal AD offspring, but were absent in male and paternal AD offspring. Within non-AD offspring, negative correlations existed over small regions of the superior temporal, insula and lingual cortices. These results suggest that as AD offspring age, cortical atrophy is more prominent, particularly if the parent with AD is mother or if the AD offspring is female.

Asthmaâchronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS), characterized by coexisting symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is considered a separate disease entity. Previously, we investigated the effects of AD on pulmonary function in adult patients with asthma. Here, we present the findings of our further research on the differences in the effects of AD exposure on pulmonary function between patients with asthma alone and those with ACOS. Methods Between March and May 2012, we conducted a panel study wherein we monitored daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) values in 231 adult patients with asthma. These patients were divided into 190 patients with asthma alone and 41 patients with ACOS in this study. Daily AD particle levels were measured using light detection and ranging systems. Two heavy AD days (April 23 and 24) were determined according to the Japan Meteorological Agency definition. A linear mixed model was used to estimate the association between PEF and AD exposure. Results Increments in the interquartile range of AD particles (0.018 kmâ1) led to PEF changes of â0.50 L/min (95% confidence interval, â0.98 to â0.02) in patients with asthma alone and â0.11 L/min (â0.11 to 0.85) in patients with ACOS. The PEF changes after exposure to heavy AD were â2.21 L/min (â4.28 to â0.15) in patients with asthma alone and â2.76 L/min (â6.86 to 1.35) in patients with ACOS. In patients with asthma alone, the highest decrease in PEF values was observed on the heavy AD day, with a subsequent gradual increase over time. Conclusion Our results suggest that the effects of AD exposure on pulmonary function differ between patients with asthma alone and ACOS, with the former exhibiting a greater likelihood of decreased pulmonary function after AD exposure.

However, survival and clinical features of young patients, especially those with stage IV disease, relative to adult patients remain unclear. This retrospective single-institution cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care cancer center. Subjects were 861 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer at the age of 15 to 74Â years and who were referred to the division of surgery or gastrointestinal oncology at the National Cancer Center Hospital from 1999 to 2013. Overall survival (OS) was investigated and clinicopathological variables were analyzed for prognostic significance. Of these, 66 (8%) were adolescent and young adult patients and 795 (92%) were adult patients. Median survival time was 13.6Â months in adolescent and young adult patients and 22.4Â months in adult patients, and 5-year OS rates were 17.3% and 20.3%, respectively, indicating significant worse prognosis of adolescent and young adult patients (pâ=â0.042). However, age itself was not an independent factor associated with prognosis by multivariate analysis. When compared with adult patients, adolescent and young adult patients consisted of higher proportion of the patients who did not undergo resection of primary tumor, which was an independent factor associated with poor prognosis in multivariate analysis. In patients who did not undergo resection (nâ=â349), OS of adolescent and young adult patients were significantly worse (pâ=â0.033). Prognoses were worse in adolescent and young adult patients with stage IV colorectal cancer compared to adult patients in Japan, due to a higher proportion of patients who did not undergo resection with more advanced and severe disease, but not due to age itself.\n\nSick Leave and Factors Influencing Sick Leave in Adult Patients with Atopic Dermatitis: A Cross-Sectional Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Os-Medendorp, Harmieke; Appelman-Noordermeer, Simone; Bruijnzeel-Koomen, Carla; de Bruin-Weller, Marjolein\n\n2015-03-27\n\nLittle is known about the prevalence of sick leave due to atopic dermatitis (AD). The current literature on factors influencing sick leave is mostly derived from other chronic inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of sick leave due to AD and to identify influencing factors. A cross-sectional study was carried out in adult patients with AD. sick leave during the two-week and one-year periods, socio-demographic characteristics, disease severity, quality of life and socio-occupational factors. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine influencing factors on sick leave over the two-week period. In total, 253 patients were included; 12% of the patients had to take sick leave in the last two weeks due to AD and 42% in the past year. A higher level of symptom interference (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.13-1.40) or perfectionism/diligence (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.83-0.96) may respectively increase or decrease the number of sick leave days. Sick leave in patients with AD is a common problem and symptom interference and perfectionism/diligence appeared to influence it. Novel approaches are needed to deal with symptoms at work or school to reduce the amount of sick leave due to AD.\n\nDistinguishing neurocognitive deficits in adult patients with NP-C from early onset Alzheimer's dementia.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnen, Andreas; Pawlowski, Matthias; Duning, Thomas\n\n2018-06-05\n\nNiemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the NPC1 or the NPC2 gene. Neurocognitive deficits are common in NP-C, particularly in patients with the adolescent/adult-onset form. As a disease-specific therapy is available, it is important to distinguish clinically between the cognitive profiles in NP-C and primary dementia (e.g., early Alzheimer's disease; eAD). In a prospective observational study, we directly compared the neurocognitive profiles of patients with confirmed NP-C (nâ=â7) and eAD (nâ=â15). All patients underwent neurocognitive assessment using dementia screening tests (mini-mental status examination [MMSE] and frontal assessment battery [FAB]) and an extensive battery of tests assessing verbal memory, visuoconstructive abilities, visual memory, executive functions and verbal fluency. Overall cognitive impairment (MMSE) was significantly greater in eAD vs. NP-C (pâ=â0.010). The frequency of patients classified as cognitively 'impaired' was also significantly greater in eAD vs. NP-C (pâ=â0.025). Patients with NP-C showed relatively preserved verbal memory, but frequent impairment in visual memory, visuoconstruction, executive functions and in particular, verbal fluency. In the eAD group, a wider profile of more frequent and more severe neurocognitive deficits was seen, primarily featuring severe verbal and visual memory deficits along with major executive impairment. Delayed verbal memory recall was a particularly strong distinguishing factor between the two groups. A combination of detailed yet easy-to-apply neurocognitive tests assessing verbal memory, executive functions and verbal fluency may help distinguish NP-C cases from those with primary dementia due to eAD.\n\nThe incremental validity of a computerised assessment added to clinical rating scales to differentiate adult ADHD from autism spectrum disorder.\n\nPubMed\n\nGroom, Madeleine J; Young, Zoe; Hall, Charlotte L; Gillott, Alinda; Hollis, Chris\n\n2016-09-30\n\nThere is a clinical need for objective evidence-based measures that are sensitive and specific to ADHD when compared with other neurodevelopmental disorders. This study evaluated the incremental validity of adding an objective measure of activity and computerised cognitive assessment to clinical rating scales to differentiate adult ADHD from Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Adults with ADHD (n=33) or ASD (n=25) performed the QbTest, comprising a Continuous Performance Test with motion-tracker to record physical activity. QbTest parameters measuring inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity were combined to provide a summary score ('QbTotal'). Binary stepwise logistic regression measured the probability of assignment to the ADHD or ASD group based on scores on the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale-subscale E (CAARS-E) and Autism Quotient (AQ10) in the first step and then QbTotal added in the second step. The model fit was significant at step 1 (CAARS-E, AQ10) with good group classification accuracy. These predictors were retained and QbTotal was added, resulting in a significant improvement in model fit and group classification accuracy. All predictors were significant. ROC curves indicated superior specificity of QbTotal. The findings present preliminary evidence that adding QbTest to clinical rating scales may improve the differentiation of ADHD and ASD in adults.

Among many research tasks, it is of particular interest to identify noninvasive imaging biomarkers for AD diagnosis. In this paper, we present a robust deep learning system to identify different progression stages of AD patients based on MRI and PET scans. We utilized the dropout technique to improve classical deep learning by preventing its weight co-adaptation, which is a typical cause of over-fitting in deep learning. In addition, we incorporated stability selection, an adaptive learning factor, and a multi-task learning strategy into the deep learning framework. We applied the proposed method to the ADNI data set and conducted experiments for AD and MCI conversion diagnosis. Experimental results showed that the dropout technique is very effective in AD diagnosis, improving the classification accuracies by 5.9% on average as compared to the classical deep learning methods.

ICI-RS 2014.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnding, Ralf; Rosier, Peter; Smith, Phillip; Gammie, Andrew; Giarenis, Ilias; Rantell, Angela; Thiruchelvam, Nikesh; Arlandis, Salvador; Cardozo, Linda\n\n2016-02-01\n\nTo debate and evaluate the evidence base regarding the added value of video to urodynamics in adults and to define research questions. In the ICI-RS Meeting 2014 a Think Tank analyzed the current guidelines recommending video urodynamics (VUD) and performed a literature search to determine the level of evidence for the additional value of the imaging with urodynamic assessment of both neurogenic and non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. Current guidelines do not specify the added value of imaging to urodynamics. Recommendations are based on single center series and expert opinion. Standard imaging protocols are not available and evidence regarding the balance between number and timing of pictures, patient positioning, and exposure time on the one hand and diagnosis on the other hand is lacking. On the basis of expert consensus VUD is relevant in the follow-up of patients with spinal dysraphism. Evidence for the value of VUD in non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction is sparse. There is some evidence that VUD is not necessary in uncomplicated female SUI, but expert opinion suggests it might improve the evaluation of patients with recurrent SUI. There is only low level evidence for the addition of video to urodynamics. The ICI-RS Think Tank encourages better reporting of results of imaging and systematic reporting of X-ray doses. Specific research hypotheses regarding the added value of imaging are recommended. The panel suggests the development of standards for technically optimal VUD that is practically achievable with machines that are on the market.

To assess this information in daily practice, the \"Mental health care Monitor Older adults\" (MEMO) was developed in the Netherlands. The aim of this paper is to describe MEMO and the older adults who attend outpatient mental health care regarding their predisposing and enabling characteristics and need for care. In MEMO all patients referred to the division of old age psychiatry of the participating mental health care organisations are assessed at baseline and monitored at 4, 8 and 12-month follow-up. Primary outcomes are mental and social functioning, consumer satisfaction, and type of treatment provided (MEMO Basic). Over the years, MEMO Basic is repeated. In each cycle, additional information on specific patient groups is added (e.g. mood disorders). Data collection is supported by a web-based system for clinicians, including direct feedback to monitor patients throughout treatment. First results at baseline showed that the majority of patients that entered the division of old age psychiatry was female (69%), had low education (83%), lived alone (53%), was depressed (42%) and had a comorbid condition (82%). It seemed that older immigrants were not sufficiently reached. The current study is the first in the Netherlands to evaluate patient characteristics and outcome in mental health care provided for older adults in day-to-day practice. If MEMO works out successfully, the method should be extended to other target groups.

Previous studies have focused mostly on pediatric patients, while epidemiological investigation on adult AD has been very limited.The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical features of adult AD in outpatients with dermatitis and eczema in China mainland.A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted among outpatients with eczema or dermatitis from 39 tertiary hospitals of 15 provinces in China from July 1 to September 30, 2014.Of 8758 patients, 407 were adult AD. Compared with adults with other types of dermatitis, the mean age (41.8âÂ±â14.3 vs 42.04âÂ±â15.38 years, Pâ<â0.05) and onset age (35.2âÂ±â11.2 vs 39.2âÂ±â14.0 years, Pâ<â0.001) of adult AD were younger, and mean disease duration was longer (5.3âÂ±â7.1 vs 2.8âÂ±â4.9 years, Pâ<â0.001). About 53.3% adult AD involved 3 or more body locations, higher than adults with other types of dermatitis (34.4%, Pâ<â0.001), but lower than those with pediatric and adolescent AD (73.8%, Pâ<â0.001). History of asthma (19.2% vs 6.9%, Pâ<â0.001) or allergic conjunctivitis (21.9% vs 14.9%, Pâ<â0.05) was more common in adult AD than pediatric/adolescent AD. Suspected bacterial infection was more frequently in adult AD than adults with other types of dermatitis (24.3% vs 14.6%, Pâ<â0.001) and pediatric/adolescent AD (24.3% vs 14.9%, Pâ<â0.001). More severe itching was observed in 31.4% of adult AD, higher than that of adults with other types of dermatitis (15.4%, Pâ<â0.001), whereas similar to that of pediatric/adolescent AD (28.7%, Pâ>â0.05). The highest (8.7%) and lowest prevalence (3.7%) of adult AD were in 25Â°N to 30Â°N and 35Â°N to 40Â°N latitude region.A substantial part of adult outpatients with eczema or dermatitis is adult AD.

To estimate the prevalence of AD in adults and by disease severity. This international, cross-sectional, web-based survey was performed in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and Japan. Adult members of online respondent panels were sent a questionnaire for AD identification and severity assessment; demographic quotas ensured population representativeness for each country. A diagnosis of AD required subjects to be positive on the modified UK Working Party/ISAAC criteria and self-report of ever having an AD diagnosis by a physician. The proportion of subjects with AD who reported being treated for their condition was determined and also used to estimate prevalence. Severity scales were Patient-Oriented SCORAD, Patient-Orientated Eczema Measure, and Patient Global Assessment. Among participants by region, the point prevalence of adult AD in the overall/treated populations was 4.9%/3.9% in the US, 3.5%/2.6% in Canada, 4.4%/3.5% in the EU, and 2.1%/1.5% in Japan. The prevalence was generally lower for males vs females, and decreased with age. Regional variability was observed within countries. Severity varied by scale and region; however, regardless of the scale or region, proportion of subjects reporting severe disease was lower than mild or moderate disease. Prevalence of adult AD ranged from 2.1% to 4.9% across countries. Severe AD represented a small proportion of the overall AD population regardless of measure or region.

The objective of this study was to determine compounding pharmacists' self-perceptions of the value-added services they provide. A web-based survey method was used. Respondents' perceptions of their most important value-added service frequently fell into one of two categories: (1) enhanced pharmacist contribution to developing and implementing patient therapeutic plans and (2) providing customized medications of high pharmaceutical quality. The results were consistent with a hybrid community clinical practice model for compounding pharmacists wherein personalization of the professional relationship is the value-added characteristic.\n\nDevelopment of the Korean Adult Reading Test (KART) to estimate premorbid intelligence in dementia patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSeo, Eun Hyun; Han, Ji Young; Sohn, Bo Kyung; Byun, Min Soo; Lee, Jun Ho; Choe, Young Min; Ahn, Suzy; Woo, Jong Inn; Jun, Jongho; Lee, Dong Young\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe aimed to develop a word-reading test for Korean-speaking adults using irregularly pronounced words that would be useful for estimation of premorbid intelligence. A linguist who specialized in Korean phonology selected 94 words that have irregular relationship between orthography and phonology. Sixty cognitively normal elderly (CN) and 31 patients with Alzheimerâs disease (AD) were asked to read out loud the words and were administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th edition, Korean version (K-WAIS-IV). Among the 94 words, 50 words that did not show a significant difference between the CN and the AD group were selected and constituted the KART. Using the 30 CN calculation group (CNc), a linear regression equation was obtained in which the observed full-scale IQ (FSIQ) was regressed on the reading errors of the KART, where education was included as an additional variable. When the regressed equation computed from the CNc was applied to 30 CN individuals of the validation group (CNv), the predicted FSIQ adequately fit the observed FSIQ (R2 = 0.63). In addition, independent sample t-test showed that the KART-predicted IQs were not significantly different between the CNv and AD groups, whereas the performance of the AD group was significantly worse in the observed IQs. In addition, an extended validation of the KART was performed with a separate sample consisted of 84 CN, 56 elderly with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 43 AD patients who were administered comprehensive neuropsychological assessments in addition to the KART. When the equation obtained from the CNc was applied to the extended validation sample, the KART-predicted IQs of the AD, MCI and the CN groups did not significantly differ, whereas their current global cognition scores significantly differed between the groups. In conclusion, the results support the validity of KART-predicted IQ as an index of premorbid IQ in individuals with AD.

The CD30 molecule belongs to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family and is expressed on activated T cells with a sustained expression in Th2 cells. This molecule also exists in a soluble form (sCD30). Elevated serum levels of sCD30 have been found in patients with Hodgkin's disease, chronic hepatitis B infection and HIV infection. Studies were undertaken to compare the serum levels of sCD30 in patients with AD (n=49) and healthy non-atopic controls (n=94). The presence of sCD30 was analysed with ELISA. A significantly higher concentration of sCD30 was noted in AD patients, median sCD30 level 29 U/ml (range 1-708 U/ml), compared with healthy non-atopic controls (P<0.001), where the median level was 11 U/ml with a range of 1-1042 U/ml. No correlation was found between sCD30 levels and total serum IgE, or between the AD patients' SCORAD values and concentration of sCD30. sCD30 levels were also analysed in 20 AD patients, which during ketoconazole treatment had improved their clinical scores and reduced their serum IgE and eosinophil cationic protein levels. However, no significant decrease in sCD30 levels was noted after treatment. The results show that patients with AD have elevated levels of sCD30, but without correlation to total serum IgE or disease activity.\n\nIndividual Patient Diagnosis of AD and FTD via High-Dimensional Pattern Classification of MRI\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDavatzikos, C.; Resnick, S. M.; Wu, X.; Parmpi, P.; Clark, C. M.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of MRI-based high-dimensional pattern classification in differentiating between patients with Alzheimerâs Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and healthy controls, on an individual patient basis. MRI scans of 37 patients with AD and 37 age-matched cognitively normal elderly individuals, as well as 12 patients with FTD and 12 age-matched cognitively normal elderly individuals, were analyzed using voxel-based analysis and high-dimensional pattern classification. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of spatial patterns of regional brain atrophy found to be characteristic of AD and FTD were determined via cross-validation and via split-sample methods. Complex spatial patterns of relatively reduced brain volumes were identified, including temporal, orbitofrontal, parietal and cingulate regions, which were predominantly characteristic of either AD or FTD. These patterns provided 100% diagnostic accuracy, when used to separate AD or FTD from healthy controls. The ability to correctly distinguish AD from FTD averaged 84.3%. All estimates of diagnostic accuracy were determined via cross-validation. In conclusion, AD- and FTD-specific patterns of brain atrophy can be detected with high accuracy using high-dimensional pattern classification of MRI scans obtained in a typical clinical setting.

Both diseases appear to have similar clinical symptoms, such as deficits in attention and executive function, but specific cognitive domains are affected. Current cohort studies have shown a close relationship between Î±Î² deposits and age-related macular degeneration (Johnson et al., 2002; Ratnayaka et al., 2015). Additionally, a close link between the thinning of the retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) and AD patients has been described, while it has been proposed that AD patients suffer from a non-specific type of color blindness (Pache et al., 2003). Our study included 103 individuals divided into three groups: A healthy control group (n = 35), AD (n = 32) according to DSM-IV-TR, NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and VaD (n = 36) based on ÎÎÎDS-AIREN, as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) results. The severity of patient's cognitive impairment, was measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and was classified according to the Reisberg global deterioration scale (GDS). Visual perception was examined using the Ishihara plates: \"Ishihara Color Vision Test - 38 Plate.\" The three groups were not statistically different for demographic data (age, gender, and education). The Ishihara color blindness test has a sensitivity of 80.6% and a specificity of 87.5% to discriminate AD and VaD patients when an optimal (32.5) cut-off value of performance is used. Ishihara Color Vision Test - 38 Plate is a promising potential method as an easy and not time-consuming screening test for the differential diagnosis of dementia between AD and VaD.\n\nCleft palate and ADULT phenotype in a patient with a novel TP63 mutation suggests lumping of EEC/LM/ADULT syndromes into a unique entity: ELA syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nProntera, Paolo; Garelli, Emanuela; Isidori, Ilenia; Mencarelli, Amedea; Carando, Adriana; Silengo, Margherita Cirillo; Donti, Emilio\n\n2011-11-01\n\nAcro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome is a rare condition belonging to the group of ectodermal dysplasias caused by TP63 mutations. Its clinical phenotype is similar to ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate (EEC) and limb-mammary syndrome (LMS), and differs from these disorders mainly by the absence of cleft lip and/or palate.
