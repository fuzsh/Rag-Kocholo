        "text": "SLOW PRODUCTIVITY\n\nby Cal Newport\n\n(Portfolio, March 2024)\n\nNew York Times Bestseller\n\nIt is not enough to be a great writer. If you want your book to stand the test of time, you must also be a great storyteller. Whether the subject is history or nature, self-improvement or pop culture, science or sports, Laurie Abkemeier looks for a distinctive voice and a natural talent for artfully conveying ideas or skillfully crafting a narrative. Regardless of the subject listed below, she is very interested in working with people of color and those from historically marginalized communities who are writing on these topics.\n\nA successful senior editor who became an agent in 2003, Laurie specializes in nonfiction and has placed hundreds of books with every major publisher, as well as mid-size publishers and small presses. As someone with extensive experience about what goes on behind publishersâ€™ doors, she works closely with her talented roster of authors to develop their ideas, polish their proposals, and guide them from deal to publication.\n\nDeFiore and Company is a literary agency founded by Brian DeFiore in 1999 and headquartered in New York's Flatiron District.
