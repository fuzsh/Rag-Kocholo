        "text": "What do literary agents do?\n\nA literary agent represents your book to acquiring editors who want to publish it. In other words, an agent gets your foot in the door of a publishing house — and onto the path of getting traditionally published.\n\nIn addition to championing you and your writing and serving as your point of contact with others in publishing, literary agents understand editors’ tastes and the types of books that publishers are looking to add to their lists — a crucial component in getting any publishing house to invest in the works of new authors. Since most big publishers don’t accept unsolicited submissions, getting a literary agent who’s accepting submissions is the most realistic route to traditional publication, particularly for debut authors.\n\nAside from getting your foot in the door, what else do literary agents do?\n\nThey are expert negotiators, combining publishing acumen with a nose for the value of good, sellable writing;\n\nThey act as mediators between you and your publisher (when you don’t want to hurt your working relationship with an editor by talking brass tacks);\n\nThey manage the financial and marketing side of things while you concentrate on the writing; and\n\nThey often have strong editorial skills, helping refine your manuscript before you send it to a publisher.\n\nAs you might've guessed, literary agents are especially important for debut authors, who often don't have a starting point in the vast maze that is the publishing industry. That's what a literary agent will become for you: a guide to help you throughout the publishing process, and kickstart your publishing career.\n\nNew authors might be intimidated by the wealth of information and cautionary signs in the industry. It's especially tricky to research literary agents when some are open to submissions from new authors, and some are not.\n\nIf you're one of those debut authors, don't fret! We've got you covered with the resources that you need to gain your bearings.\n\nResources for new authors landing a literary agent in 2024\n\nYou might think that a great book is all you need to catch a literary agent’s attention. But you’ll need to put in a good amount of work to land them — and that includes everything from the careful study of each agent's wishlist to personalizing your query letter for each candidate..\n\nWhether you’re a new author learning how to research literary agents or an experienced writer refining your query letter, here are the resources that can give you a headstart.\n\nFree online materials for debut authors\n\nHow to Get a Query Letter Review - Find out here\n\nHow to Find a Literary Agent - Our 7-step guide\n\nHow to Write a Query Letter - Includes a free template\n\nHow to Personalize Your Query Letters - Watch webinar here\n\nHow to Write a Nonfiction Book Proposal - Learn more here\n\nHow to Write a Nonfiction Query Letter - To accompany your proposal\n\nHow to Format Your Manuscript - A simple how-to guide\n\nRecommended books"
