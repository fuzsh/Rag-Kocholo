But Calvin is no longer in his cage, and her parents just say he’s in a “better place.” When Amelia and her best friend, Camila, have an argument, and Amelia later misses the school talent show, she doesn’t know what to do. Without Calvin, who does she talk to about her disappointments at school? And who does she talk to about missing Calvin?\n\nJust when Amelia thinks she’s completely alone, a new student arrives, and they begin to sort things out together. Amelia learns that it’s always possible to make new friends, that expressing yourself can happen in different ways, and that it all starts with talking it out.\n\nMORE PRAISE FOR CALVIN AND THE SUGAR APPLES\n\n“A sensitive and rich children’s novel—a thoughtful, warm reflection on overcoming loss and embracing change.” —Foreword Reviews"
