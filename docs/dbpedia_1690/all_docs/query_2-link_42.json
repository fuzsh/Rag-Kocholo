        "text": "May 18, 2007\n\nI just finished this book, and it was amazing. So many ideas about color, how it permeates the world, right up my alley! Some ideas in it are things I have mulled over many times before, some are totally new and exciting! Very, very creative writing style. How life, love, and all experiences are handled in this book denotes a frame of mind unbounded, exuberant, and deeply in touch with the Source.\n\nI could understand contextually most of the Portuguese phrases, a few I didn't know. I'd like to talk the book over with: Someone who speaks Portuguese, or people who have been to/live in the Azores.\n\nAugust 7, 2014\n\nThe story itself took me into another world created in the point of view of an Portuguese-American character. It scared me how uncanny the resemblance of Clara to myself, or any other women out there who wanted to express their freedom, their emotions, their longing and sadness without the stereotypes of each generation when it comes to women. Helio's character can also be related in a sense of being a wondrous mix of grounded reality and dreamscapes with his obsession in grafting. The two souls met and it was a passionate love that brought upon the annihilation of a physical attraction. Though I can feel that Helio was obsessed with Clara it was the typical ending that I wanted to happen for him. Clara on the other hand lived in her reality where she was obsessed with choosing to be another human being but her emotions and her art cannot really be contained and expressed in one being. The story was very rich in life and color.\n\nRead\n\nFebruary 2, 2016\n\nI felt like I was reading a long poem or hearing someone recount a dream in that the storyline matters less than the way the words are put together and the images that the author so vividly brings to the mind of the reader.\n\nI gave this book a lot of my time, energy and attention but I was not able to quite finish it because it lacked the forward motion that I need in a book.\n\nDecember 23, 2007\n\nLoved it. A book about Azoreans in California--how many fiction books like this can you find?\n\nAugust 12, 2020\n\nThis had the potential to be a great book, based on the first 50 pages. Clara was born in Azores, daughter of a dreamer fisherman and his beloved wife. However, as a kid she didn't talk or show much understanding of sound, so those around her found alternative ways to communicate with her.\n\nBut once the setting changed from Azores to US I became completely disengaged in the story. Clara seemed intriguing as a kid, but became mundane as a young adult and I just couldn't understand her or what was happening in the plot.\n\nI did enjoy all the references to Portugal, Portuguese language and Portuguese traditions and also the writing style. But the plot lost me completely.\n\nApril 5, 2013\n\nIt's been so long since I read this book but I've been searching for it for a long time. One of my all time favorite books and the concepts on color and language always stuck with me after I read it.\n\nApril 2, 2016\n\nI initially gave this two stars, but over time it has grown on me. The writing is lovely, but the story is slippery and hard to hold in line. At the time, I thought it was incredibly depressing, but I find myself thinking about some of the sections now with more appreciation.\n\nApril 4, 2008\n\nI don't even think this book is in print anymore, but it's wonderful."
