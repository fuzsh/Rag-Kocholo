Schwartz\n\nReview from Booklist:\n\n“Schwartz’s new book works as both an intelligent class textbook… and absorbing personal reading.”\n\nThe Great Baseball Revolt\n\nRobert B. Ross\n\nReview from the New York Labor Association:\n\n“…as a contribution to our understanding of the role of athletes and sports leagues in American life, this text is outstanding.”\n\nTransmedial Narratology and Contemporary Media Culture\n\nJan-Noël Thon\n\nReview from European Comic Art:\n\n“Thon successfully fills the gap of a foundation for transmedial narratology that is remarkable as much for its precise critical re-examination of established narratological terms and concepts as for its own clear terminology and conceptualisations that provide fertile ground for future research.”\n\nCoyote Anthropology\n\nRoy Wagner\n\nReview from Journal of Folklore Research:\n\n“…a thought-provoking book, without a doubt.”\n\nPraise from the Washington Independent Review of Books:\n\n“Finally, we can all be inspired by the significant contributions made by a woman who was brave, relentless, and — comfortingly — ordinary.”\n\nAuthors\n\nMelissa Fraterrigo\n\nAuthor article in The Millions.\n\nClayton Anderson\n\nAuthor interviewed on Fox News.\n\nCarolyn Ducey"
