        "text": "A Colloquium on the 50th Anniversary of the Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1974, including the screening of the feature film April’s Captains\n\nPresented by the Saab for Portuguese Studies, in partnership with the UMass Lowell Department of World Languages and Cultures. Sponsored in part by the Consulate-General of Portugal in Boston and Camões, I.P.\n\nThursday, April 25, 2024, 2:30-9 p.m.\n\nIn-person at Coburn Hall 110 and via Zoom\n\nFree and open to the public.\n\nParking in the Wilder Lot, corner of Wilder and Broadway Streets.\n\nRegister for Transitions to Democracy in Portugal and Spain: A Colloquium on the 50th Anniversary of the Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1974.\n\nThis lecture will discuss what inspires fiction or writing in general, and how the process unfolds. How do images work in stories, and how can we achieve great emotional impact with surprising plots? What are the secrets to making stories come alive? It will focus on the particulars of \"Our Lady of the Artichokes\" as the lead story in a collection, and its current adaptation process into a screenplay. \"Revenge in the Name of All Owls\" grew out of one singular, strong feeling: How do we convey to others what that might be without stating it outright? Finally, what does it mean to write out of our Luso/a backgrounds?\n\nKatherine Vaz is a former Briggs-Copeland Fellow in Fiction at Harvard University, a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and a recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship. She is the author of the novel Above the Salt (Flatiron Books/Macmillan, 2023), a People Magazine Book of the Week, a Top 15 Pick of Good Morning, America, and a Top November pick on Goodreads. Her previous novel Mariana has been selected by the Library of Congress as one of the Top Thirty International Books of 1998). Her collection Fado & Other Stories won the Drue Heinz Literature Prize, and Our Lady of the Artichokes received the Prairie Schooner Book Award. She is the first Portuguese American to have her work recorded for the Archives of the Library of Congress (Hispanic Division).\n\nFor additional information, write to Frank F. Sousa, director of the Saab Center, by email at: frank_sousa@uml.edu.\n\nFrancisco Duarte Lopes is the Portuguese Ambassador to the United States, having formerly served in the equivalent position at the United Nations. Among the many other leadership positions held were Director-General of Foreign Policy, Director-General for European Affairs, and Diplomatic Advisor to the Prime-Minister.\n\nRobert A. Sherman served as the U.S. ambassador to Portugal from 2014 to 2017, focusing on bilateral economic development and international security issues. From 1991 to 1993, he was the assistant attorney general of Massachusetts and chief of the state’s Consumer Protection Division. Sherman is a founding member of Greenberg Traurig’s Boston office. He teaches International Relations in our Political Science Department.\n\nFor additional information, write to Frank F. Sousa, director of the Saab Center, by email at: frank_sousa@uml.edu."
