        "text": "The genre of historical fiction is one of the most captivating ones. Historical fiction transports us to a different era and location, much as fantasy or science fiction. But historical fiction distinguishes itself by portraying actual occasions and everyday life. It's intriguing to learn about living in a different era. Historical fiction may take us somewhere new, much as people like traveling to different countries to experience other cultures.\n\nThe following historical fiction books will be available in November 2023:\n\n1. The Liberators by E.J. Koh\n\nEJ Koh's deftly rendered portraits and symphonic testimony from guards, prisoners, perpetrators, and liberators span continents and four generations of two Korean families forever changed by fateful past choices made in love and war, from the Gwangju Massacre to the 1988 Olympics, flashbacks to Korean repatriation after the Japanese surrender, and the Sewol ferry accident. The Liberators is an exquisitely crafted family narrative of memory, trauma, and empathy that is incredibly beautiful, extraordinarily poignant, and a striking monument to the outcomes and fortunes of inheritance. This book is scheduled to be released by Tin House Books on November 7, 2023.\n\n2. Above the Salt by Katherine Vaz\n\nA captivating and epic love story that centers on two Portuguese immigrants who rekindle their burgeoning affection in Civil War America after fleeing religious strife.

An American classic receives new life in this evocatively written book. This book is anticipated to be released by Atria Books on November 14, 2023.\n\n5. The Temple of Fortuna (Wolf Den Trilogy #3) by Elodie Harper\n\nThe last volume of Elodie Harper's Wolf Den Trilogy, which was published in the Sunday Times.

That’s what people were always telling us, at least; the strangers’ hands on our bellies, saying how careful we must be to enjoy the time. How it’ll all be over in a blink of an eye. How before we know it, they’ll be walking, talking, leaving us.”\n\n― Aimee Molloy, The Perfect Mother\n\nA group of women's lives suddenly become entangled in this gripping psychological thriller when one of their infants goes missing.\n\nSynopsis from Goodreads...\n\nThey call themselves the May Mothers—a collection of new moms who gave birth in the same month. Twice a week, with strollers in tow, they get together in Prospect Park, seeking refuge from the isolation of new motherhood; sharing the fears, joys, and anxieties of their new child-centered lives.\n\nWhen the group’s members agree to meet for drinks at a hip local bar, they have in mind a casual evening of fun, a brief break from their daily routine. But on this sultry Fourth of July night during the hottest summer in Brooklyn’s history, something goes terrifyingly wrong: one of the babies is abducted from his crib. Winnie, a single mom, was reluctant to leave six-week-old Midas with a babysitter, but the May Mothers insisted that everything would be fine. Now Midas is missing, the police are asking disturbing questions, and Winnie’s very private life has become fodder for a ravenous media.\n\nThough none of the other members in the group are close to the reserved Winnie, three of them will go to increasingly risky lengths to help her find her son. And as the police bungle the investigation and the media begin to scrutinize the mothers in the days that follow, damaging secrets are exposed, marriages are tested, and friendships are formed and fractured.\n\nMy reaction to this novel...\n\nI've had this book for a very long time, but I'm just now able to read it. Despite not knowing the author, I chose to purchase it because of the book's attractive cover. The fact that it discusses moms piqued my curiosity because that is one of my favorite reading subjects. The narrative is set in New York during a regular gathering of moms in a park. As all of their babies are anticipated to be born in May, they refer to themselves as the May Mothers. This get-together's concept appeals to me much because I believe that pregnant women, especially those expecting their first child, should feel supported. This notion in the novel, I believe, should be implemented in every town in real life because it is rather challenging to be a first-time parent because of the numerous unknown problems one might experience.\n\nEvery time I read the introduction to a chapter in the book as I was reading it, I was impressed since the author included some advice on how to take care of newborns before moving on to the tale. It seemed similar to getting parenting advice via email. That bit is great. The story's conclusion was also rather exciting, so I was anxious to complete it right away since I was anticipating the outcome. Despite the women's numbers and disparities, I was able to get to know them. However, there are also moments when it is unclear who is speaking or whose perspective is being described.\n\nHalfway through the narrative, I started to get quite bored and perplexed. There are chapters that are told from someone's point of view, but I couldn't tell if it was Winnie's. The tale grew hazy to me at that moment. Additionally, the author included several elements that I feel are unnecessary or would be better off being left out because they don't make sense. Because the plot began to make little to no sense to me and the story I was anticipating was totally different from what was happening, I was eager to end it as soon as possible. Since the story began off nicely before getting muddled and repetitive, I must admit that it did frustrate me. It's difficult to distinguish between the characters, and the ending felt abrupt and entirely illogical. Putting in so much reading time just to be so perplexed is difficult. There is not enough character delineation and there is too much going on. I also didn't appreciate the author's use of the name of Jesus in profanity either; it is outright blasphemy.\n\nAfter reading positive reviews of this book, I was ultimately really disappointed since I was very certain that I did not share their sentiments. It simply made me frustrated and baffled, and it made me feel like I should read other novels instead of this one. However, I've already done it, and even if it didn't come out well, it was still an enjoyable experience. Simply said, it isn't that fantastic in my opinion, thus I'm not sure whether I will suggest it. Perhaps it would be best not to raise expectations if someone were to read this and begin to inquire so as to prevent them from being overly frustrated.\n\nMy Overall Rating: ⭐✨(1.5/5)\n\nWhere to buy this book?\n\n“Just because I'd spent so many years coloring inside the lines, it wasn't fair for me to expect perfection. People make mistakes. Life isn't fair. People change.”\n\n― Sarah Dunn, The Big Love\n\nDunn's most recent book will be the passing recommended book of the summer because it is both funny and devastating, mixing the psychological incisiveness of Jane Austen with the current frankness of \"Sex and the City.\"\n\nSynopsis from Penguin...\n\nWhen Alison sends her boyfriend Tom out in the middle of a dinner party to buy Dijon mustard, the last thing she expects is his phone call telling her that he isn't coming back. Not now. Not ever.\n\nWhile Alison tries to figure out where she went wrong with Tom, she realises she has some serious catching up to do and that when freedom beckons, you'd be mad not to follow. After all, of the two men she's slept with, one was gay and one was Tom. She's got a handsome new boss, decades of evangelical guilt to offload and an urge to have undefined-yet-presumably-meaningless sex with the aforementioned boss.\n\nBut is this enough? And if Tom isn't the Big Love, who on earth is?\n\nMy reaction to this novel...\n\nI found this book while seeking for a quick read. I didn't have any problems reading it at first because it's only a few pages long. The book's engaging start made me want to read it more. Despite the fact that I don't know Sarah Dunn and this is my first book by her, I continue reading despite my lack of familiarity with her work. In this instance, I merely want to remark that she did a fantastic job since she didn't use any difficult-to-understand phrases. Instead, she used straightforward language. Usually, when a writer uses lofty language, it pulls me out of the tale because I have to look up the meaning before I can relate. I kept reading because I liked the manner she told the story, which is very lively. I felt the uniqueness of the author's way of writing, so I enjoyed her narrative for a while.\n\nEverything went well until she brought up Christians after having an affair with her boss. Everything I read seemed off, and the story's flow became nasty. I don't understand why so many people who suffer in this world as a result of their decisions blame it on us Christians and what we firmly hold to be true. Why put the blame on God and Christians when she decides on everything in this book that makes her happy, although knowing it's wrong? Since you made those decisions, I believe you are to blame, especially if you were a Christian previously and abandoned your faith for the same reason the character did: to satiate the desires of the flesh. I don't want to keep reading, but I'm not that sort of reader, so I gave her a chance, hoping for a shift in the narrative.\n\nNearly every character featured in this book was unlikeable, especially the main character. The purpose of the digressions she makes is to elucidate her personality and range of emotions, yet they fall short of endearing her. The main character must be liked or, if not from the beginning, possess redeeming traits enabling the reader to empathize with her. However, in this novel, the character's journey is spoon-fed to readers, making it less pleasurable to engage with Alison as she grows in her character. You don't get the same sense of accomplishment from getting alongside Alison as you would if the author had just let you know what she discovered and how her view of things has shifted. It is just not effective in this situation to breach the mystery rule. I was utterly let down, and I did not like reading this book at all.\n\nGiven that she heavily lambasted Christians in this book and I am a Christian, many of you may assume that I gave the book a bad review. However, I can assure you that it is absolutely upfront and wholeheartedly correct, YES I gave her a bad review because of that as well as her not-so-good story. I will not put up with a narrative in which a woman accuses Christians of being to fault for her own mistakes and decisions. I'm simply being sincere and forthright with regard to how I felt about this book and expressing that I won't suggest it to anyone, particularly Christians, since there are critics of our faith and some profanity that uses the name of our God, which is quite grating. I'm not sure if the author was formerly a Christian, but I pray God shows mercy on her for the story she penned.\n\nMy Overall Rating: ⭐(1/5)\n\n“Love, it never dies. It never goes away, it never fades, so long as you hang on to it. Love can make you immortal”\n\n― Gayle Forman, If I Stay\n\nGayle Forman wrote the young adult book If I Stay, which was released in 2009. Summit Entertainment optioned the book in December 2010 for a 2014 film adaptation after it got favorable reviews from the young adult market.\n\nSynopsis from Goodreads...\n\nIn the blink of an eye everything changes. Seventeen ­year-old Mia has no memory of the accident; she can only recall what happened afterwards, watching her own damaged body being taken from the wreck. Little by little she struggles to put together the pieces- to figure out what she has lost, what she has left, and the very difficult choice she must make. Heartwrenchingly beautiful, this will change the way you look at life, love, and family. Now a major motion picture starring Chloe Grace Moretz, Mia's story will stay with you for a long, long time.\n\nMy reaction to this novel...\n\nThe book If I Stay was written by Gayle Forman. A young woman's life is abruptly flipped upside down in this incredibly touching novel. The story revolves around Mia's struggle to decide on that crucial course of action. The story is told in flashbacks between the past, present, and future. The scenes with Mia and her family in the hospital and her recollections of crucial individuals from her daily life are intercut. Through Mia's memories while she rests in a trance-like state in the intensive care unit, on the verge of death, we get to know all those involved. It's heartbreaking to see as each loved one approaches her and expresses their support, love, and compassion for her. They battle to keep her while knowing why it's so difficult. Every chapter is emotionally intense, and every memory makes me cry.\n\nI found it difficult to put this book down. The writing was fantastic, and there is a ton of thought-provoking stuff, some of it is partially covered through flashbacks and the stories themselves say a lot. Despite the fact that it doesn't hold back on the emotions, despite the hefty subject matter, it also has a breezy aspect. This was one of those rare novels that simply really channels you. You may picture flashes of happiness, joy, misery, and pleasure while reading this novel. It's a novel whose narrative just sticks with you. I adore the structure of \"If I Stay\"'s story. Although it is recounted from Mia's point of view, it is not only her version of the present. When everything is taken into account, it revolves around her experiences and those of her loved ones. This lends the entire work a certain amount of self-contradictory quality.\n\nOn the other hand, I found it difficult to accept how the characters were portrayed. Everyone is calm and considerate. It didn't appear like real people were there. Anyhow, this is a novel about family, hardship, and impossible choices, but it is also a story of perfection. It discusses the bonds between the people we love. Really, the book was so good that I didn't figure out what was going to happen in the final chapter until the book was over.\n\nAlthough I was aware that this book was written many years ago and that a movie based on it was produced—which I haven't seen—this book strikes me as being quite innocent yet having a powerful and engaging story that everyone should be familiar with. You'll be moved to tears and wish you could save Mia by going back in time. I can't even begin to imagine how distressing it would be for someone to see themself in a coma. sometimes all you can do is lie there and hear your loved ones' happy and sad news. It hurts a great deal.\n\nI would strongly suggest it to everyone who like dramatic literature. This book has the ability to both cheer up readers and tear their hearts at the same time.\n\nMy Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐(4/5)\n\nWhere to buy this book\n\n“She’s the sort of person who puts a brave face on even when she feels like crying.”\n\n― Anne-Marie Conway, Forbidden Friends\n\nA new relationship, a horrific tragedy, and a long-buried deceit are the subjects of this remarkable tale from the author of Butterfly Summer.\n\nSynopsis from Goodreads\n\nWhen Lizzie and Bee meet on holiday, it feels as if they were always meant to be friends. Escaping their parents and exploring, everything seems perfect in the hot summer sun. As the two girls grow closer however, strange questions rise to the surface… Is Lizzie an only child? Why has Bee’s dad disappeared? And why, as the holiday comes to an end, are the two girls forbidden from seeing each other again? Could one dark secret from the past hold the answer? Could one fateful night keep Lizzie and Bee apart…for ever?\n\nMy reaction to this novel...\n\nSince it isn't too long, I merely chose to read this after seeing it on my shelf. I just finished reading it a little over a week ago, and I'm not sure how to feel about it. A pair of girls' perspectives are used to write the book. It wasn't horrible, but I didn't particularly appreciate it because it was intended for adolescents as the target audience was 13 years old. Additionally, perhaps because it was written with teenagers in mind, it was rather lighthearted and gave the impression that individuals can change and recover fast, which struck me as odd considering the nature of the tale and occurrence described in the book.\n\nThe author's tone sounds positive, and she utilized simple language. Her storytelling style is one that I truly appreciate. The teen in me could genuinely appreciate it and take pleasure in every aspect of it, but there are many instances when it is so grating that I can't tolerate it. In the story's flow, for instance, the author maintained the secret until around halfway through the narrative, which was excessively sluggish. It seems like the author is unsure on whether or which chapter to include the big reveal, and as a result, every page becomes monotonous. In order to explain what's occurring, I firmly believed that the secret had to be shocking. Yet it isn't. It was surprising, but not in the way I expected, but because of how she presented the twist, as if it were no big issue, which is why it failed to capture my attention and was highly ineffectual. I truly hope she made that turn of events surprising enough to save the narrative.\n\nThe treatment Lizzie received from her father following the tragedy is another element of the novel that I considered to be so superficial. Because of how the father responded, I honestly believed she was involved or at fault. It wasn't overprotective, but I think he needs to consult a psychiatrist, and after that big disclosure and of how effortlessly he turned for the better, it was unbelievable. And, with just a simple confrontation, he was able to let go of all his drama after ten years. Who exactly is he kidding here?\n\nThe turmoil surrounding Bee's mother is another thing that bothers me. It was an exaggeration. Why was it the only time she reacted that way after ten years had passed? How about the last nine years? Was it only after the tenth year after the tragedy that she became like that? How irrational and overbearing! That pink letter should not have been included either; it was inappropriate for the plot. It happens in a very uncomfortable and annoying way. It seems to imply that Bee is the one who is responsible for the tragedy, which makes me wonder why Bee and her mother need to travel to Spain. The plot of the narrative is so absurd that I find it impossible to imagine it in any other way.\n\nOverall, I find the tale to be tedious; I'm not sure if young adults would find it appealing, but for me, the plot shifts abruptly, as if the author first takes her time with it before suddenly wanting to get to the end because she doesn't want the story either. She must strike a balance in order to give the narrative a satisfying beginning and conclusion since there is no reasonableness in it. I regret to say that I will not suggest it to other adult bookreaders like me.\n\nMy Overall Rating: ⭐✨(1.5/5)\n\nWhere to buy this book...\n\nThe continuously changing field of young adult literature is where some of the greatest and most original stories on the shelves can be found.
