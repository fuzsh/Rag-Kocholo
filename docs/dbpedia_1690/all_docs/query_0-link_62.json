        "text": "American novelist\n\nPaula Huston (born April 25, 1952) is an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, and creative nonfiction writer.\n\nPaula Huston was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the eldest of five children of Lyle and Solveig Dahl, and grew up in Long Beach, California, where she attended Millikan High School. She married her first husband a year after graduation, and in 1973, they moved to San Luis Obispo, California, where she began writing and publishing short stories. Her daughter, Andrea, was born in 1977, and her son, John, arrived in 1978. Divorced in the early 1980s, she married Michael Huston in 1985, who had two daughters of his own.\n\nShe enrolled at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in her mid-thirties, where she earned a bachelor's degree in English and a master's degree in British and American Literature, going on to teach in the Cal Poly English Department for the next twelve years.\n\nIn 1994, she was awarded a National Endowment of the Arts Fellowship in Creative Writing. Her first novel, Daughters of Song, was published in 1995. In 1999 she helped design and implement the California State University Consortium Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, in which she taught for the next three years. When the program ended in 2002, she took an early retirement from Cal Poly to become a full-time writer, speaker, and retreat leader. She served as a creative nonfiction mentor for the Seattle Pacific University MFA program from 2011-2016.\n\nRaised Lutheran, she left the church when she was seventeen, but returned as a Catholic in 1994. In 1999, she became a Camaldolese Benedictine oblate, a lay member of New Camaldoli Hermitage's community of monks in Big Sur, California.[1] She served as co-director of New Camaldoli’s oblate formation program from 2015-2022, and as president of the Chrysostom Society, a national organization of literary Christian writers, from 2016-2019.\n\nShe and her husband live on four acres on the Central Coast of California. They have five grandchildren.\n\nFor fifteen years before she became a Benedictine oblate, Huston wrote literary fiction, often with artist protagonists or themes involving art. Her first novel, Daughters of Song, was a coming-of-age story about a young piano prodigy.[2] As her interest in religion deepened, she switched to spiritual writing. In Signatures of Grace: Catholic Writers on the Sacraments, she and co-editor Tom Grady invited various authors including Ron Hansen, Paul Mariani, Mary Gordon, Patricia Hampl, Katherine Vaz, and Murray Bodo to contribute personal essays on the Catholic sacraments. Huston went on to write seven books of spiritual nonfiction, including The Holy Way: Practices for a Simple Life, a narrative account of the spiritual practices she learned from her association with the monks of New Camaldoli; By Way of Grace: Moving from Faithfulness to Holiness, about the cardinal and theological virtues; Forgiveness: Following Jesus into Radical Loving; Simplifying the Soul: Lenten Practices to Renew the Spirit; and A Season of Mystery: 10 Spiritual Practices for Embracing a Happier Second Half of Life.\n\nIn 2013, she published her second novel, A Land Without Sin, about a hardened young battlefield photojournalist seeking her missing priest brother in the jungles of Central America. In 2016, she returned to narrative spiritual nonfiction with One Ordinary Sunday: A Meditation on the Mystery of the Mass, an explanation of the historical roots and theological meaning of each element of the Catholic Mass. In 2021, she published a history of New Camaldoli Hermitage entitled The Hermits of Big Sur.\n\nShe has been a regular contributor to Give Us This Day (Liturgical Press) since 2011, writes essays for a series called Seton and Culture (St. Elizabeth Seton Shrine), and has done numerous interviews for blogs, magazines, radio shows, and podcasts.\n\nA Land Without Sin (Slant Books, 2013) ISBN 9781620326589\n\nDaughters of Song (Random House, 1995) ISBN 9780679419693\n\nThe Hermits of Big Sur (Liturgical Press, 2021) ISBN 9780814685068\n\nOne Ordinary Sunday: A Meditation on the Mystery of the Mass (Ave Maria Press, 2016) ISBN 9781594715952\n\nA Season of Mystery: 10 Spiritual Practices for Embracing a Happier Second Half of Life (Loyola Press, 2012) ISBN 9780829437546\n\nSimplifying the Soul: Lenten Practices to Renew Your Spirit (Ave Maria Press, 2011) ISBN 9781594712692\n\nForgiveness: Following Jesus Into Radical Loving (Paraclete Press, 2009) ISBN 9781557255709\n\nBy Way of Grace: Moving from Faithfulness to Holiness (Loyola Press, 2007) ISBN 9780829423310\n\nThe Holy Way: Practices for a Simple Life (Loyola Press, 2003) ISBN 9780829414417\n\nSignatures of Grace: Catholic Writers on the Sacraments, contributed to the essay \"Matrimony\" (Dutton, 2000) ISBN 9780525945338\n\n\"Pilgrimage,\" Image, Spring 2010[3]\n\n\"The Cattle Raid of Cooley,\" Image, Spring 2003[4]\n\n\"Serenissma,\" Missouri Review, Spring 1996[5]\n\n\"A Misery of Love,\" Story, Autumn 1993[6]\n\n\"Mercy,\" American Short Fiction, Winter 1992[7]\n\n\"War Story,\" North American Review, June 1989[8]\n\n\"Swimmer,\" The Massachusetts Review, Summer 1984 (written under name \"Paula Keisler\")[9]\n\n\"The Bouzouki,\" Virginia Quarterly Review, Spring 1983 (written under name \"Paula A.
