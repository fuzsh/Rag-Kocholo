Who does Amelia talk to about her disappointments at school? Who does she talk to about missing Calvin? And just when Amelia thinks she’s completely alone, a new student, Iris, arrives. Amelia learns that expressing oneself can happen in different ways, but it always starts with talking it out.\n\nBook Guide →\n\nGet your copy\n\nAmazonBarnes & NobleBookshop.orgBooks-A-MillionIndieBound"
