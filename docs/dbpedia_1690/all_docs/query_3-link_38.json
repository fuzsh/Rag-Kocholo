        "text": "(Ace of hearts image above from the video game ‚ÄúFallout: New Vegas‚Äù)\n\nKatherine Vaz was one of my favorite new to me authors last year, which earned her a ‚Äúrecurring role‚Äù in my Deal Me In challenge for this year as the Ace of Hearts on my story roster. I‚Äôm slowly working my way through the tales in her collection ‚ÄúFado and Other Stories,‚Äù and this is the sixth one I‚Äôve read. Last year, I posted about ‚ÄúUndressing the Vanity Dolls‚Äù and ‚ÄúFado,‚Äù both of which I enjoyed immensely.\n\nA cutesy way to summarize this story would be ‚ÄúKind of a Nikolai Gogol rewrites ‚ÄúThe Nose‚Äù using an eyeball while assisted by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.‚Äù You see, Jose is in love with Ana. Ana is married but they have a secret place where they meet at regular intervals. Jose ‚Äì or ‚ÄúZe‚Äù to his friends ‚Äì yearns for more and cherishes opportunities to see and observe her outside of their routine. One such opportunity presents itself in ‚ÄúThe Day of Contests‚Äù in the valley where they live. Though Ana is in attendance with her husband, Ze decides that distinguishing himself by accumulating the most points in all the contests will further insure Ana‚Äôs devotion.\n\nDuring the last of the contests he spots Ana in the crowd.\n\n‚ÄúA short, stocky man was resting his hand against the back of her neck, where the tips of her blonde hair lay, always, neatly. She was laughing at something he was saying. Was it the laughing done by married people who did not love each other but wanted to reassure others that any fighting would be done at home‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nZe is an over-analzyer of everything in his affair with Ana. Every expression, every laugh, every look, every word. It is during the final contest that he has spotted Ana and her husband. During this contest, he also realizes he‚Äôs over extended himself in his exertions in the prior ones, and he begins to slip into a sort of altered state of consciousness and then a prolonged hallucination or waking dream. In this dream, he is being punished by the people of the village in a sort of medieval ‚Äúcucking chair‚Äù (pictured below), being lowered into a river and held there. During this procedure his eyes pop out of their sockets(!) and though one is ‚Äúeaten by a fish‚Äù the other survives and takes us on a surreal journey through the town in search of his Ana.\n\nI have to admit this story wasn‚Äôt one that grabbed me right away, but the further I read the more fascinated I became with the new form of protagonist of the story. Its ‚Äúobservations‚Äù we‚Äôre unique and often quite humorous. I was reminded, too, how poetic Vaz‚Äôs writing is. At one point the eyeball is accidentally kicked by a passerby:\n\n‚ÄúThe kick left the eye‚Äôs vision blurred, and in the dimness it wonders if it were a boy again in the Azores, seeing the women in their doorways doing their embroidery in the last light of day ‚Äì God‚Äôs light ‚Äì because electricity was too expensive.‚Äù\n\nAnd once, when the eyeball is ‚Äúpicked up cautiously‚Äù by a dog:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶in a mouth that was fragrant like rotting straw. The tongue was velvet, with those bumps that put everything eaten onto a pedestal of sorts before it is consumed.‚Äù\n\nOverall, an interesting read and one which has likely ‚Äòearned‚Äô this author a spot in next year‚Äôs DMI roster as well. üôÇ\n\nBelow: the author at an appearance at CUNY. The link below the picture also includes a brief video of her speaking about her writing, etc. Worth a watch ‚Äì it‚Äôs only a few minutes long.\n\nhttp://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/academics/journalism/Vaz.htm\n\nIt‚Äôs week forty-six and I drew the seven of hearts. This is my second story from this author for this year‚Äôs Deal Me In short story reading challenge. I wrote about her ‚ÄúUndressing the The Vanity Dolls‚Äù earlier this year, and it remains a strong contender for my favorite DMI story of 2014. I read, ad hoc, another story of hers this year titled, ‚ÄúThe Birth of Water Stories,‚Äù and was blown away by that one too. The story ‚ÄúFado‚Äù was not as moving as those other two (that, admittedly, set the bar quite high) but I continue to enjoy getting acquainted with this author.\n\nPlus I learned a new word from this story‚Äôs title. üôÇ Do you know what a ‚ÄúFado‚Äù is? I do (now). It‚Äôs ‚Äúa plaintive, Portuguese folk song.‚Äù It‚Äôs a perfect title for this ‚Äúcover story‚Äù of the collection, and seems appropriate for the collection as a whole too. I also learned what a ‚Äúwish ribbon‚Äù was. One of the characters in this story puts great stock in their efficacy. Primarily, I believe, a Brazilian tradition, the wish ribbon enters this story when Xica is at the post office to pick up a ribbon ‚Äúdo Nosso Senhor de Bonfim‚Äù sent from that country by her cousin. How are they supposed to work? ‚ÄúWrap the wish ribbon around the wrist, and make 3 knots, making a wish for each of the 3 knots tied. Once the Brazilian Wish Bracelet falls off the wrist on its own, it is believed that the 3 wishes will come true.‚Äù\n\nIn this story, ‚ÄúXica‚Äù is the neighbor and ‚Äôsurrogate grandmother‚Äô of the young female narrator. Xica has endured many hardships and the worst of them is that her bright and promising son Manuel has been rendered mute and apparently brain damaged by an auto accident. Compounding the problem is that Manuel‚Äôs young and beautiful wife, Marina, has lost interest in him because of the accident, where Xica feels she should be supporting him ‚Äúin sickness and health‚Äù as the vows go.\n\nXica is one of the more interesting characters I‚Äôve met during this year‚Äôs Deal Me In reading. I was particularly amused by the fact that she kept an ‚Äúofensa ledger‚Äù wherein she catalogs the sins of those around her and proposes appropriate punishments. She knows that keeping such a register is God‚Äôs job but feels that ‚Äúonce again, He was asleep.‚Äù Much of her grit, and unfortunately, her superstition and vengefulness as well are passed on to her surrogate granddaughter, Rosa.\n\nThe last few pages of the story feature an accelerated recap of Rosa‚Äôs growing into a woman after Xica has passed on. I believe it is in these chapters that we see how Rosa has applied what she learned from Xica‚Äôs somewhat unique approach to life. We see her through her fist sexual encounter ‚ÄúSex happens the way a pearl is formed. It begins with a grain or parasitic worm that itches in the soft lining until the entire animal buckles around it. With enough slathering it will relax into a gem.‚Äù Not bad, huh?\n\nRosa even later makes peace with Marina and tends to her when she becomes sick, leaving us with our other ‚Äútake away‚Äù from the story: Rosa tells us, ‚ÄúHere is the seal from which all grace comes: We must create Pietas in order to live. Flesh that is torn, flesh that is dead or dying, even as it is rotting through your fingers ‚Äì hold it next to your heart. Find ripe and tender flesh too, and hold it in your arms, because your life depends on it. Hold it for as long as you can, and ask for its blessing.‚Äù\n\nBelow: Michelangelo‚Äôs ‚ÄúPieta‚Äù\n\nOkay, so after reviewing the story in accompaniment of writing this post, I‚Äôve decided that I like this story almost as much as the other anyway. üôÇ There is some powerful stuff in these thirteen pages.\n\nHave you read Kahteirne Vaz before? I can unreservedly recommend her.\n\nOnly six stories left to read for DMI 2014!\n\n39.667765 -86.070575\n\nNew posts this week from the DMI crew:\n\nCoincidentally, with me also reading The Martian Chronicles this week, two of us drew a Ray Bradbury story from their Deal Me In deck.\n\nDale read ‚ÄúSome Live Like Lazarus‚Äù http://mirrorwithclouds.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/ray-bradbury-some-live-like-lazarus/\n\nAnd Randall read ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Play Poison‚Äù http://timeenuf.blogspot.com/2014/11/lets-play-poison-by-ray-bradbury.html\n\nThe avalanche of stories from Returning Reader continues:\n\n1) Gabriel Garcia Marquez‚Äôs ‚ÄúEva is Inside Her Cat‚Äù http://returningreader.wordpress.com/2014/11/03/short-story-30-eva-is-inside-her-cat-gabriel-garcia-marquez/\n\n2) the Ernest Hemingway classic ‚ÄúThe Snows of Kilimanjaro‚Äù http://returningreader.wordpress.com/2014/11/05/short-story-31-the-snows-of-kilimanjaro-ernest-hemingway/\n\n3) Anton Chekhov‚Äôs ‚ÄúGooseberries‚Äù http://returningreader.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/short-story-32-gooseberries-anton-chekhov/\n\n4) Dylan Thomas‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Child‚Äôs Christmas in Wales‚Äù\n\nhttp://returningreader.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/short-story-33-a-childs-christmas-in-wales-dylan-thomas/\n\n5) Ungulani Ba Ka Khosa‚Äôs ‚ÄúAn Unexpected Death‚Äù http://returningreader.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/short-story-34-an-unexpected-death-ungulani-ba-ka-khosa/\n\nKatherine has exhausted her hearts suit after reading Robyn Carr‚Äôs ‚ÄúNatasha‚Äôs Bedroom‚Äù http://katenread.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/deal-me-in-week-45-natashas-bedroom/ There‚Äôs also a magic trick video featuring her card üôÇ\n\nI missed Halloween by one day in drawing Ambrose Bierce‚Äôs ghost story, ‚ÄúBeyond the Wall‚Äù (I got goosebumps) https://bibliophilica.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/beyond-the-wall-a-ghost-story-by-ambrose-Bierce/\n\nCandiss posted about Margaret Atwood‚Äôs ‚ÄúHappy Ending‚Äù http://readthegamut.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/deal-me-in-challenge-story-45-happy-endings-by-margaret-atwood/\n\nSome other short story content from the week that I found interesting:\n\nHave you heard of author Ron Rash before? I hadn‚Äôt, but this collection sounds like it would be at home on my bookshelf http://www.thedailynewsonline.com/entertainment/article_6fa4c738-66d1-11e4-9fcb-dfce161211a2.html\n\nGreat article about an event in NY where some of the authors featured in The Best American Short Stories (2014 edition) read their work at a Barnes and Noble. I‚Äôve included some stories from The BASS series the past couple Deal Me In challenges. Looks like I may want to do so again. üôÇ http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/07/jennifer-egan-writing-technologies-short-stories\n\nI follow a couple Irish literary accounts n Twitter and they appear to have a thriving short story culture over there. The Davy Byrnes award is one of their prestigious writing prizes. (I‚Äôve read one story from this source in a previous DMI, Claire Keegan‚Äôs ‚ÄúFoster‚Äù. https://bibliophilica.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/a-perfect-opportunity-to-say-nothing/)\n\nHere‚Äôs a collection of the cream of that crop.\n\nhttp://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/six-of-the-best-davy-byrnes-stories-2014-1.1988889\n\n39.703606 -86.064179\n\nThis week for my Deal Me In Short Story Reading Challenge I drew the ‚Äúmustache-less‚Äù King of Hearts (he‚Äôs the only king without a mustache ‚Äì a fun bit of trivia I only learned today when preparing this post).\n\nDid you also know that the four kings in the standard deck of cards also supposedly represent four historical kings? The King of Hearts is Charlemagne, while Spades = King David, Clubs = Alexander the Great, and Diamonds, depending on who you ask = Julius or Augustus Caesar. Okay, done with the trivia. üôÇ\n\nFor this year‚Äôs challenge, Hearts are my suit for stories recommended by others. (Update 4/12/14: actually I have this wrong: diamonds are my ‚Äúrecommended by others‚Äù suit. I had more stories recommended by others that I had room for in that suit and a few bled into other suits. Hearts is actually my suit for women authors) Katherine Vaz is a Portugese-American writer who I learned about in quite a random way. Often, after our monthly meetings at the Kurt Vonnegut Library book club, some of us will adjourn to a nearby restaurant (named after the Vonnegut novel, Bluebeard) for lunch. Last July, it was just going to be two of us going, so I agreed with my colleague to ‚Äújust meet you over there.‚Äù I got there first, and when he arrived he had two strangers with him. Seems he had been chatting with some ‚Äúinternational visitors‚Äù in the library and, when asked to recommend a good place for lunch, did what any fine ambassador of our city would do and invited them along. They were in town for a ‚ÄúPortuguese Diaspora‚Äù conference (apparently there‚Äôs one every year somewhere in the world) at Butler University. We enjoyed a nice lunch and also a sharing of our literary interests. Long story short, I saw this as excellent opportunity to collect some reading recommendations. I explained my annual short story reading challenge to our guests, and they offered several Portuguese authors to consider. One was Katherine Vaz, and I‚Äôve included two of her stories from her collection ‚ÄúFado and Other Stories‚Äù in my 2014 roster.\n\nI got off to a slow start with this story and was worried I wouldn‚Äôt like it. I even remember thinking, well, at least I learned what vanity dolls are (‚Äúpeople use them to displace vain desires. If a nun, or any devout person, painted a ball-gown onto a doll and gave it new earrings, the doll absorbed her wish to have those things. A doll dressed as a sailor could cure a travel bug, and one painted with flowers could relieve one of carnal aches.‚Äù) I‚Äôd never heard of vanity dolls before, and I guess I‚Äôve assumed they really exist and aren‚Äôt just a vehicle for this story. Does anyone know?\n\nAnyway, the story really blossomed the more of it I read. The main character, Reginald, now an astronomer, is making a visit to an old favorite botany professor of his (from twenty years ago) who is dying. The hook of the story is that Reginald has always suspected that there was once ‚Äúsomething between‚Äù the professor (Eduardo Dias) and Reginald‚Äôs wife, Alicia. Reginald has never directly confronted Alicia with his suspicions, but has hinted around the bush about it for years. Appropriately, Vaz describes his marriage thus: ‚ÄúReginald‚Äôs marriage to Alicia was redolent with what was withheld, which made it an ordinary, garden-variety union.‚Äù\n\nDias was/is an inveterate charmer, and Reginald has before told his wife that Dias ‚Äú‚Ä¶had that ability to make everyone feel that he, or she, I suppose, was the only other person alive. It‚Äôs a gift. He was like that with me.‚Äù On Reginald‚Äôs visit to the dying man, Dias insists he take him to the seashore, as a red tide will be coming in, and he wants to see it. Reginald is spellbound by the phenomenon and thinks of Dias that ‚Äú‚Ä¶he still knew the best secrets. He had a way of making you want to give him something in return.‚Äù His visit to Dias also leads him to know, ‚Äúbetter than he has ever known‚Ä¶ that vitality is plainly the cloak that sexuality wears, so that it can go out in public. That was what his professor was made of, that was his cloak, his finery.‚Äù\n\nVaz‚Äôs writing in the final pages of this story totally wowed me. An example: ‚ÄúThe red tide was drifting south, the neon blue receding, and as easily as that, as easily and swiftly as a comet arrives, passes on, and does not return again, not in one‚Äôs lifetime, the moment for Dias to ask Reginald why he had given him the silent treatment, and for Reginald to ask if the letters were never for Alicia out of a well-founded guilt, came and left, and would present its chance to be regarded no more. Such nullifying moments exist, and their vacancy is as strong as all else that one might name.‚Äù\n\nThat passage ‚Äì especially the last sentence ‚Äì gave me goosebumps, and did again just now as I typed this. So ‚Ä¶ I guess I liked this story. üôÇ\n\nWhat about you? Have you heard of or read this author? What about other Portuguese or Portuguese-American writers? Id love to hear of them.\n\n(Below: a red tide.)\n\n39.666162 -86.074692\n\nTop Ten Tuesday is a weekly meme hosted by the talented folks over at The Broke and the Bookish. Hundreds participate EVERY week. Why not be one of them ‚Äì if you‚Äôre not already? & If you‚Äôre visiting Bibliophilopolis for the first time, I invite you to look around a bit to see if our reading tastes overlap orjustleave a comment to say ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù I usually check out every tenth TTT post on their list. I‚Äôd like to view more, but there‚Äôre just way too many. üôÇ\n\nTop Ten Books on my Winter To Read List:\n\n10. The Universe vs. Alex Woods by Gavin Extence\n\nI‚Äôve forgotten where I first heard of this one, but it sounded interesting. It‚Äôs on my TR shelf at Goodreads.com which I‚Äôve promised myself to clear out. (Where have I heard that before?)\n\n9. Winter‚Äôs Tale by Mark Helprin\n\nThis one‚Äôs been around for awhile and I‚Äôve been hearing good things about it for just as long. My blogging colleague Dale at Mirror with Clouds is reading it now, so unless he pans it in a review, it‚Äôll be part of my winter list.\n\n(above: Eleanor Catton with her prize-winning novel)\n\n8. The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton\n\nThe 2013 Mann-Booker prize winner. I enjoyed one of the other finalists for this year‚Äôs prize so much (see my last post), I thought I should give the winner a try.\n\n7. Dirtyville Rhapsodies by Josh Green\n\nRecommended to me by author Robert Rebein at a book event this summer at Bookmama‚Äôs Bookstore. Green was also a student here in Indy. AND it was reviewed favorably by my local blogging colleague, Melissa at so I‚Äôll give it a read.\n\n6. Annals of the Former World by John McPhee\n\nA non-fiction classic. Recommended by a neighbor of mine from I was growing up, who has now lived in New Mexico for many years. He visited here this summer and we talked books. It was also a favorite of my Dad, who didn‚Äôt dispense his approbation lightly.\n\n(above: Herman Melville)\n\n5. Benito Cereno by Herman Melville\n\nSomehow I was volunteered to lead a discussion of this novella next month. I‚Äôve read it before, but probably twenty years ago and I remember almost nothing\n\n4. Our Lady of Artichokes and other Portuguese-American Stories by Katherine Vaz\n\nI met a couple from Portugal who were in town for a conference and happened to visit the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library. Over lunch at Bluebeard (a restaurant named after a Vonnegut novel!) I mentioned my annual short story project and asked for recommendations. This was one of them.\n\n3. Crimes in Southern Indiana: Stories by Frank Bill\n\nI was intrigued by this title, and then I also heard some good things about it. As an Indiana resident myself, I feel I should read it. üôÇ\n\n2. The Light Between Oceans by M.L. Stedman\n\nSeveral friends and acquaintances have read this one. It‚Äôs my turn.\n\n1. Never Let Me Go ‚Äì Kazuo Ishiguro\n\nFinally I will read this, which has been on my list for a long time. Its another Mann-Booker prizewinner (from 2005). My friend and co-worker Jane gifted her copy to me after she finished it or her book club. So, no excuse not to read it now. üôÇ This will be first up if I ever finish Barbara Kingsolver‚Äôs ‚ÄúFlight Behavior‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs it for me. What books will you ‚Äúhole up with‚Äù while you‚Äôre awaiting spring‚Ä¶?\n\n39.906163 -86.076923"
