Previous knowledge of the original Sleeping Beauty/Snow White stories will help.) The Sleeper and The Spindle, writtenContinue reading “Book Review: The Sleeper And The Spindle”\n\n3 New Books I Recommend This Month\n\nHappy February! I hope you all have tolerable months, or that at least all your troubles will be confined to the mere 27 days left stretching ahead of us, and thus over soon. “February is the shortest month of the year, so if you are having a miserable month, try to schedule it for February.”Continue reading “3 New Books I Recommend This Month”\n\nThoughts on Some Stories in Rogues (ed. George R. R. Martin)\n\nEarlier this week, I was hit with a fantasy craving. I needed to read something completely engrossing, something with really cool magic and characters full of surprises. But I didn’t know exactly where to start. Should I try an author I’d never read before? Should I return to an old favorite? Did I want to read fantasy setContinue reading “Thoughts on Some Stories in Rogues (ed. George R. R. Martin)”\n\nArchived Review: My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me\n\n(I originally wrote this little review for a magazine at my University, back in Feb 2012. I’m cross posting it here because I’ve been thinking about fairy tales a lot, lately, and seriously recommend this collection. It’s still in print, too, unlike some of my other favorite anthologies.) I was a little wary when IContinue reading “Archived Review: My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me”\n\n13 Favorite Books For 2013\n\n…And then it was the last day of 2013, which was a surprise for everyone involved in the passage of time, and they stared at their calenders and the sky in horrified incomprehension. Last time I checked, I was lying outside reading W.B. Yeats to some barn cats who didn’t seem to like poetry veryContinue reading “13 Favorite Books For 2013”\n\nAll Hallow’s Read Suggestions: YA and Children’s Books\n\nI’ve got excuses for the scarcity of reviews this month, and they’re waiting at the end of this list. But first, here are some random books amongst the dozens which I’ve been recommending to young readers as Halloween approaches. I encourage all of you to participate in Neil Gaiman’s invented holiday known as All Hallow’sContinue reading “All Hallow’s Read Suggestions: YA and Children’s Books”\n\nAnticipating Gaiman’s The Ocean At The End Of The Lane\n\nSo, like nearly every other nerd in book-land, I am having trouble containing my excitement for Neil Gaiman’s new adult novel, The Ocean At The End Of The Lane, which comes out on June 18th. No one’s let on exactly what the plot is, but I’m happy about that because I want to dive into those pagesContinue reading “Anticipating Gaiman’s The Ocean At The End Of The Lane”"
