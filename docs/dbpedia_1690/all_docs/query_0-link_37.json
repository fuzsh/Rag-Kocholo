If she’d only followed her cop instincts instead of the juju—her random prophetic dreams—the perpetrator would have been off the streets and her mother would still be alive. The only salve against her guilt is Yolanda’s vow to reject that juju crap, and to solve cases using only good solid detective work.\n\nBut when her godson is kidnapped and his parents are suspected of murder, Yolanda finds herself caught between what she feels and what she knows. And with the escalation of the case comes the escalation of her dreams. Until she can no longer ignore their importance.\n\nIf she wants to overcome the guilt and deal with her pent-up grief, Yolanda must confront the juju and learn to trust its place in her life. If she doesn’t, she risks losing yet another loved one. And she can’t possibly let that happen.\n\nNOTE: See site for details.\n\nWhere: Cellar Door Bookstore\n\nDate: Thursday the 15th\n\nTime: 6 pm\n\nAddress: 473 E.

Her parents, determined to give her the best education possible, instilled in her at an early age that she had to be the best. When Camarillo Gutierrez was fifteen, her parents’ visas expired and they were forced to return to Mexico. She had to make an impossible choice—return to Mexico with her parents or stay in the U.S. as an unaccompanied homeless youth, a status affecting thousands of underage victims of family separation due to broken immigration laws.\n\nCamarillo Gutierrez stayed, taking on the responsibility of her own education as well as her younger brother’s. Determined to break the cycle of being a “statistic,” she knew that even though her parents couldn’t stay, there was no way she could let go of the opportunities the U.S. could provide. Armed with only her passport and sheer teenage determination, she forged ahead with the life her parents had dreamed of for her, eventually working as one of the few Latina women on the Wall Street trading floor. Fueled by a desire to make her brother’s dreams easier to achieve than her own, her story is a reminder of the boundless love that can carry families through the most difficult of circumstances.\n\nElizabeth Camarillo Gutierrez was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, as a second-generation immigrant. She graduated from high school at the top of her class and, in 2018, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in philosophy, politics, and economics. She worked as a banking analyst at Wells Fargo and is now a product manager at a big tech company, where she uses her background and knowledge to empower communities. She has been featured on NPR’s Latino USA and delivered a viral TED Talk on finding opportunity and stability in the United States.\n\nElio Morillo, born in Ecuador and raised in both Puerto Rico and NYC, is a space systems engineer engaged in cutting-edge missions within the lunar and Martian programs. With a solid foundation in mechanical, electrical, and space systems engineering from the University of Michigan, Elio has played a pivotal role in groundbreaking missions such as NASA-JPL’s Mars 2020. Here, he contributed to the success of the Perseverance rover and the initial flights of the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars. Most recently, he has worked on Blue Origin’s lunar lander, the Blue Moon MK-1. Elio is driven by a profound passion for exploration, expansion, and creating equal opportunities for everyone to access the wonders of space. He shares his insights through inspiring keynote speeches, volunteer work, coaching, and mentorship.\n\nNOTE: See site for details.\n\nWhere: Chevalier’s Bookstore\n\nDate: Thursday the 15th\n\nTime: 6 pm\n\nAddress: 133 N.

Employing found poetry, Davis raises issues of omphalophobia, love over time, missed communication, superficiality, and environmental destruction. Through her use of juxtaposing images and writing styles, Davis shows how love can be fragile and can often fail. The Language of Fractions does not simply comment on love, but also paints a picture of a broken world. It obsesses over the question: Do we love wholly or only in parts?\n\nAmy Gerstler’s books of poems include Index of Women (Penguin, 2021), and Scattered at Sea, (Penguin, 2015). She received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2018. In 2019 she received a C.D. Wright Award from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts.

Rich in data and detail, Who Are We Now? goes beyond today’s headlines to connect our current reality to a larger more-than-human story.\n\nAt the heart of the book is a set of surveys conducted between 2016 and 2021, asking thousands of anonymous respondents all over the United States questions about their behavior and identity, and especially about gender and sexuality. The resulting window into people’s lives is a bit like that of the Kinsey Reports, which scandalized postwar America more than 70 years ago. Today, the landscape is—In every sense—even queerer. Twentieth century heterosexual “normalcy” is on the wane, especially among young and urban people.\n\nBlaise Agüera y Arcas is a frequent speaker at TED and many other conferences, winner of MIT’s TR35 Prize and Fast Company’s Most Creative People award, and a Vice President and Fellow at Google Research. He leads a 500 person team working on Artificial Intelligence (AI), large language models, smart devices, technology ethics, and privacy. Publicly visible projects from his team include Federated Learning, Artists and Machine Intelligence, Coral, Hollywood gender equality work with the Geena Davis Institute, and many AI features in Pixel and Android. In 2016 he wrote a widely read essay on the relationship between art and technology, and in 2017 he co-authored another popular essay on physiognomy and bias in AI and a refutation of claims that facial structure reveals sexual orientation. While Blaise’s role at Google focuses on AI, his career has often been at the intersection of computing with other disciplines in the sciences and humanities. He raised early alarms (starting in 2015) about fairness and bias in machine learning, which led to deeper study of the differential impacts of technology on people underrepresented in tech. His quest to map the changing landscape of human identification with minority and majority subgroups led to this book. He lives in Seattle, Washington.\n\nJoanne McNeil was the inaugural winner of the Carl & Marilynn Thoma Art Foundation’s Arts Writing Award for an emerging writer.

His best-selling 1976 memoir Born on the Fourth of July is an antiwar classic and was adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring Tom Cruise as Kovic. His follow-up, Hurricane Street, chronicled his advocacy for Vietnam veterans’ rights, including a seventeen-day hunger strike in the office of the late California senator Alan Cranston.\n\nThe book opens with Kovic’s never-before-revealed Vietnam diary (July 7, 1967–July 26, 1968). Deeply troubled by the growing antiwar movement in 1967, Kovic decided to set his own example of patriotism by returning to Vietnam for a second tour of duty. His entries from this period portray a patriotic young soldier with a strong moral and religious conscience, unburdened by the foreknowledge of the terrible events to come. His third memoir is ultimately the inspirational story of a young man finding a way to rise above his depression and despair, forgiving his enemies and himself, growing deeply committed to a new life.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: Book Soup\n\nDate: Friday the 16th\n\nTime: 7 pm – 8:30 pm\n\nAddress: 8818 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, CA 90069\n\nWebsite: https://www.booksoup.com/event/ron-kovic-john-densmore\n\nAida Zilelian Book Launch/Reading: with Guests Lori Bedilian, Arthur Kayzakian, Shahe Mankerian, Raffi Wartanianat North Figueroa Bookshop – In-Person Event\n\nAida Zilelian is a first generation American-Armenian writer, educator and storyteller from Queens, NY.
