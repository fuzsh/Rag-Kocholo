        "text": "Ann Garvin, the Author of “There’s No Coming Back From This,” has written a heartwarming, captivating, witty, and delightful novel. The genres for this novel are Contemporary Fiction, Women’s Fiction, Chick-Lit, Romance and Fiction.\n\nI love the wit, empathy, and compassion the author uses in her well-written story. Ann Garvin vividly describes the scenery, props, plot, and colorful and dramatic characters. The author describes her characters as complex, complicated, flawed, quirky, and likable. Even the adorable dog in this story has a unique personality. Some characters exhibit toxic behavior. You’ll have to read to form your conclusions.\n\nI love the name that Ann Garvin has given to the protagonist, Poppy Lively. Poppy hasn’t had the best of luck. She is unemployed and about to lose her house after her accountant took her money; now, the IRS is after Poppy. Poppy has to keep this information a secret from her daughter, who is about to start Nursing School.\n\nAfter running into an old boyfriend, Poppy gets a job offer to work in the Wardrobe in Hollywood. She will have to deal with temperamental actors and all matters of design. Does it matter that Poppy has no experience, and everyone dislikes her because they think she got this job from her special connection? Anything and everything can go wrong in this department. There are betrayals and strange happenings.\n\nI appreciate how Ann Garvin discusses the importance of self-worth, self-growth, forgiveness, and second chances. The author also mentions the importance of honesty, communication, friendship, family, love, and hope. I highly recommend this thought-provoking novel. Happy Reading!"
