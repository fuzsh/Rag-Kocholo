        "text": "The author of “An American Marriage” likes to bring hardcover books with her when she flies: “I accepted a gig in Dubai just for 18 hours of luxurious reading time.”\n\nWhat books are on your nightstand?\n\n“In the Wake,” by Christina Sharpe; “Dimestore,” by Lee Smith; “This Will Be My Undoing,” by Morgan Jerkins and “Stories of Scottsboro,” by James Goodman.\n\nWhat’s the last great book you read?\n\n“Never Let Me Go,” by Kazuo Ishiguro. I don’t know how this one missed me, but I read it last year and I was so smitten that I changed my syllabus so that I could require my grad students to read it and talk about it as much as I wanted.\n\nWhat’s your favorite book no one else has heard of?\n\nThis is tricky because you have to define “no one.” It makes me think of Toni Morrison’s famous interrogation of Ralph Ellison: “Invisible to whom?” With that qualifier in place, I’ll say “The Darkest Child,” by Delores Phillips, a stirring coming-of-age story set at the cusp of the civil rights movement. It’s a heartbreaker — there has never been a more problematic mother-daughter relationship in all of literature. But it’s also a heart-healer. Soho Press is putting out a gorgeous reissue that I hope will cement the author’s legacy and get this important book into everyone’s hands."
