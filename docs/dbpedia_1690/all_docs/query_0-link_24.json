        "text": "Books: Fantasy\n\nAnthologies\n\nSnow White, Blood Red (1993), Ruby Slippers, Golden Tears (1995), A Wolf at the Door (2000), The Green Man: Tales from the Mythic Forest (2002), Swan Sister (2003), Outsiders: 22 All-New Stories From the Edge (2005), Teeth: Vampire Tales (2011)\n\nSnow White, Blood Red (1993) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\nI often have a hard time putting down interesting books. Which means that if I'm reading a book I real like before bed, I end up staying up past my bed time instead of falling asleep. One solution is to read non-fiction before bed. The other solution is to read short story anthologies. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of high quality anthologies out there. At least, not enough to keep up with the rate at which I can read.\n\nSo I decided to go back and reread Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling's fantasy anthology Snow White, Blood Red. This book has a whole bunch of things going for it at once: it's edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling; it's got stories by Neil Gaiman and Charles de Lint; and the stories are retellings or reinventions of folk and fairy tales. Mostly fairy tales in this book.\n\nPlus, a gorgeous cover by Thomas Canty.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with folk tales and fairy tales, many of the original tales--before they got cleaned up and given to kids--were filled with sex, (in addition to the casual violence of people getting eyes poked out or chopping off bits of feet or being shoved into ovens.)\n\nIn other words, these are not stories for children.\n\nLike a Red, Red Rose by Susan Wade\n\nThe Moon is Drowning While I Sleep by Charles de Lint\n\nThe Frog Prince by Gahan Wilson\n\nStalking Beans by Nancy Kress\n\nSnowbyDrop by Tanith Lee\n\nLittle Red by Wendy Wheeler\n\nI Shall Do Thee Mischief in the Wood by Kathe Koja\n\nThe Root of the Matter by Gregory Frost\n\nThe Princess in the Tower by Elizabeth A. Lynn\n\nPersimmon by Harvey Jacobs\n\nLittle Poucet by Steve Rasnic Tem\n\nThe Changelings by Melanie Tem\n\nThe Springfield Swans by Caroline Stevermer and Ryan Edmonds\n\nTroll Bridge by Neil Gaiman\n\nA Sound, Like Angels Singing by Leonard Rysdyk\n\nPuss by Esther M. Friesner\n\nThe Glass Casket by Jack Dann\n\nKnives by Jane Yolen\n\nThe Snow Queen by Patricia A. McKillip\n\nBreadcrumbs and Stones by Lisa Goldstein\n\nAs best I can tell, this anthology is still available, so if you like short stories, this is an anthology you won't want to miss. However, if you like anthologies, this is probably one you already have sitting on your shelves.\n\nPublished by Harper Collins\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nRuby Slippers, Golden Tears (1995) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\nRuby Slippers by Susan Wade\n\nThe Beast by Tanith Lee\n\nMasterpiece by Garry Kilworth\n\nSummer Wind by Nancy Kress\n\nThis Century of Sleep, or Briar Rose Beneath the Sea by Farida S. T. Shapiro\n\nThe Crossing by Joyce Carol Oates\n\nRoach in Loafers by Roberta Lannes\n\nNaked Little Men by Michael Cadnum\n\nBrother Bear by Lisa Goldstein\n\nThe Emperor Who had Never Seen a Dragon by John Brunner\n\nBilly Fearless by Nancy A Collins\n\nThe Death of Koshchei the Deathless by Gene Wolfe\n\nThe Real Princess by Susan Palwick\n\nThe Huntsman's Story by Milbre Burch\n\nAfter Push Comes to Shove by Milbre Burch\n\nHansel and Grettel by Gahan Wilson\n\nMatch Girl by Anne Bishop\n\nWaking the Prince by Kathe Koja\n\nThe Fox Wife by Ellen Steiber\n\nThe White Road by Neil Gaiman\n\nThe Traveler and the Tale by Jane Yolen\n\nThe Printer's Daughter by Delia Sherman\n\nPublished by Harper Collins\n\nA Wolf at the Door (2000) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\nI love folk tales and fairy tales, and I love the idea of stories that have been told and retold, and then finally captured on paper. The problem of course, is finding an author who is good at translating stories from an oral tradition into something that works well written.\n\nThere's something wonderful about a well-told short story, and I think that the best short stories in the world are folk and fairy tales.\n\nEllen Datlow and Terri Windling are very good at finding authors who can take these stories and retell them, and they always put together wonderful anthologies. They brought together thirteen writers for this collection of retold fairy tales.\n\nThe Months of Manhattan by Delia Sherman\n\nCinder Elephant by Jane Yolen\n\nInstructions by Neil Gaiman\n\nMrs Big: \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" Retold by Michael Cadnum\n\nFalada: The Goose Girls Horse by Nancy Farmer\n\nA Wolf at the Door by Tanith Lee\n\nAli Baba and the Forty Aliens by Janeen Webb\n\nSwans by Kelly Link\n\nThe Kingdom of Melting Glances by Katherine Vaz\n\nHansel's Eyes by Garth Nix\n\nBecoming Charise by Kathe Koja\n\nThe Seven Stage a Comeback by Gergory Maguire\n\nThe Twelve Dancing Princesses by Patricia A. McKillip\n\nAlthough one or two of the stories I found to be just okay, others were nothing short of excellent. It also seems as if the stories were I liked the best were towards the end of the book. For me the collection started out okay, and then got better and better the more I read.\n\nNot that I think the purpose of these stories is necessarily to scare us, as much as it is to make us pay attention to what is happening around us.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nThe Green Man : Tales from the Mythic Forest (2002) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\nGoing Wodwo (poem) by Neil Gaiman\n\nGrand Central Park by Delia Sherman\n\nDaphne by Michael Cadnum\n\nSomewhere in My Mind There is a Painting Box by Charles de Lint\n\nAmong the Leaves So Green by Tanith Lee\n\nSong of the Cailleach Bheur (poem) by Jane Yolen\n\nHunter's Moon by Patricia A. McKillip\n\nCharlie's Away by Midori Snyder\n\nA World Painted by Birds by Katherine Vaz\n\nGrounded by Nina Kiriki Hoffman\n\nOverlooking by Carol Emshwiller\n\nFie, Fi, Fo, Fum by Gregory Maguire\n\nJoshua Tree by Emma Bull\n\nAli anugne o chash (the boy who was) by Carolyn Dunn\n\nRemnants by Kathe Koja\n\nThe Pagodas of Ciboure by M. Shayne Bell\n\nThe Green Man (poem) by Bill Lewis\n\nThe Green Word by Jeffrey Ford\n\nPublished by Viking\n\nSwan Sister (2003) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\nI don't think I've come across a short story collection put together by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling that I didn't like, and Swan Sister is no exception to the rule.\n\nThe stories are fairy tales retold, by a variety of authors--many some of my favorites.\n\nGreenkid by Jane Yolen\n\nGolden Fur by Midori Snyder\n\nChambers of the Heart by Nina Kiriki Hoffman\n\nLittle Red and the Big Bad by Will Shetterly\n\nThe Fish's Story by Pat York\n\nThe Children of Tilford Fortune by Christopher Rowe\n\nThe Girl in the Attic by Lois Metzger\n\nThe Harm that Sang by Gregory Frost\n\nA Life in Miniature by Bruce Coville\n\nLupe by Kathe Koja\n\nAwake by Tanith Lee\n\nInventing Aladdin by Neil Gaiman\n\nMy Swan Sister by Katherine Vaz\n\nAll in all, there wasn't a weak story in this collection.\n\nLike A Wolf at the Door, this is a collection for children and young adults. However, the stories are so well written that adults should find them just as appealing. If you like folk and fairy tales, I highly recommend this collection.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nYear's Best Fantasy and Horror: Sixteenth Edition (2003) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\nPublished by St. Martin's Griffin\n\nOutsiders: 22 All-New Stories From the Edge (2005) edited by Nancy Holder & Nancy Kilpatrick\n\nThe Empty Chambers by Neil Gaiman\n\nThe Company You Keep by Steve Rasnic\n\nTem Under the Needle by Léa Silhol\n\nScarabesque: The Girl Who Broke Dracula by Tanith Lee\n\nExpanding Your Capabilities Using Frame/Shift(tm) Mode by David J. Schow\n\nCat and the Cold Prince by Freda Warrington\n\nFaces in Revolving Souls by Caitlín R. Kiernan\n\nLighten Up by Jack Ketchum\n\nPit Boy by Elizabeth Massie\n\nThe Country of the Blind by Melanie Tem\n\nRuby Tuesday by Kathe Koja\n\nRunning Beneath the Skin by Brett Alexander\n\nSavory Grim Peeper by Katherine Ramsland\n\nCraving by Yvonne Navarro\n\nViolent Angel by Thomas S. Roche\n\n...And the Damage Done by Michael Marano\n\nPop Star in the Ugly Bar by Bentley Little\n\nMiss Singularity by John Shirley\n\nThe Working Slob's Prayer by Poppy Z. Brite\n\nIf I Should Wake Before I Die by Brian Hodge\n\nHoning Sebastian by Elizabeth Engstrom\n\nThe Shadows, Kith and Kin by Joe R. Lansdale\n\nTeeth: Vampire Tales (2011) edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling\n\nThis is an Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling anthology, so as always, there are fascinating bits of folklore.\n\nRice, not garlic, was the most effective means of keeping Chinese vampires at bay, for they had a strange compulsion to count. Throwing rice at the ghost compelled it to stop; it would not move again until each grain was counted.\n\n\"Things to Know About Being Dead\" by Genevieve Valentine\n\n\"All Smiles\" by Steve Berman\n\n\"Gap Year\" by Christopher Barzak\n\n\"Bloody Sunrise\" by Neil Gaiman\n\n\"Flying\" by Delia Sherman\n\n\"Vampire Weather\" by Garth Nix\n\n\"Late Bloomer\" by Suzy McKee Charnas\n\n\"The List of Definite Endings\" by Kaaron Warren\n\n\"Best Friends Forever\" by Cecil Castellucci\n\n\"Sit the Dead\" by Jeffrey Ford\n\n\"Sunbleached\" by Nathan Ballingrud\n\n\"Baby\" by Kathe Koja\n\n\"In the Future When All's Well\" by Catherynne M. Valente\n\n\"Transition\" by Melissa Marr\n\n\"History\" by Ellen Kushner\n\n\"The Perfect Dinner Party\" by Cassandra Clare & Holly Black\n\n\"Slice of Life\" by Lucius Shepard\n\n\"My Generation\" by Emma Bull\n\n\"Why Light?\" by Tanith Lee\n\n\"Baby\" by Kathe Koja is another story in the horror genre. Another not for me.\n\nAs expected, this was a very good anthology, and although I didn't like the horror or the poetry, that's a failing of mine, not the anthology.\n\nPublished by Harper Collins"
