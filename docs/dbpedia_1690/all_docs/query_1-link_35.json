        "text": "Sheila Kohler\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nWe’re a little late with this episode and it’s all my fault! As I mentioned in my May 1st post, for the first time in four years, I conducted an amazing interview with Sheila Kohler and forgot to hit record on Zoom. Sheila–the most gracious person on Earth–forgave me for wasting 45 minutes of her time and agreed to re-record the episode.\n\nThank you to Sheila for sitting down with me twice!\n\nAfter I recovered from the shame, I realized this might be a great boon for readers. I loved Cracks, the short story, the novel, and the movie! You will find links to all three below. It was fascinating to talk about Sheila’s adaptation from short story to novel, also, to hear about the making of the movie and the decision to set the movie in England rather than South Africa.\n\nI hope you have had time to read the short story and the novel. What did you think of the movie? Let me know if you have any follow-up questions or comments. I would love to hear.\n\nHere are the links:\n\nCracks, the short story, by Sheila Kohler\n\nCracks, The Novel by Sheila Kohler, available at Bookshop and Amazon.\n\nCracks, The Movie\n\nAfter you’ve read the short story, our podcast is available on\n\nSpotify here\n\nor\n\nApple here\n\nor wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nSheila Kohler Bio:\n\nSheila Kohler was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the younger of two girls. Upon matriculation at 17 from Saint Andrews, with a distinction in history (1958), she left the country for Europe. She lived for 15 years in Paris, where she married, did her undergraduate degree in literature at the Sorbonne, and a graduate degree in psychology at the Institut Catholique. After raising her three girls, she moved to the USA in 1981, and did an MFA in writing at Columbia.\n\nIn the summer of 1987, her first published story, “The Mountain,” came out in “The Quarterly” and received an O.Henry prize and was published in the O.Henry Prize Stories of 1988. It also became the first chapter in her first novel, “The Perfect Place,” which was published by Knopf the next year.\n\nKnopf also published the first volume of her short stories, “Miracles in America,” in 1990.\n\nKohler has won two O.Henry prizes for “The Mountain” 1988 and “The Transitional Object” 2008. She has been short-listed in the O.Henry Prize Stories for three years running: in 1999 for the story, “Africans”; in 2000 for “Casualty,” which had appeared in the Ontario Review; and 2001 for “Death in Rome,” a story which had appeared in The Antioch Review. “Casualty” was also included in the list of distinguished stories in The Best American Short Stories of 2001.\n\nIn 1994 she published a second novel, “The House on R Street,” also with Knopf, about which Patrick McGrath said, in “The New York Times Book Review: ” “Sheila Kohler has achieved in this short novel a remarkable atmosphere, a fine delicate fusion of period, society and climate.”\n\nIn 1998 she published a short story, “Africans,” in Story Magazine, which was chosen for the Best American Short Stories of 1999, was read and recorded at Symphony Space and at The American Repertory Theatre in Boston and was translated into Japanese. It was also included in her second collection of stories,” One Girl,” published by Helicon Nine, which won the Willa Cather Prize in 1998 judged by William Gass.\n\nIn 1999 she published her third novel, “Cracks,” with Zoland, which received a starred review from Kirkus, was nominated for an Impac award in 2001, and was chosen one of the best books of the year by Newsday and by Library Journal.” Cracks” also came out with Bloomsbury in England, was translated into French and Dutch, and will come out in Hebrew. It has been optioned six times by Killer films and Working Track 2. The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September, 2009, and at the London film festival and came out here in the summer of 2010 and is now on Netflix. It is directed by Jordan Scott, with Eva Green in the role of Miss G.\n\nIn 2000 Kohler received the Smart Family Foundation Prize for “Underworld,” a story published in the October “Yale Review.”\n\nIn 2001 she published her fourth novel,” The Children of Pithiviers,” with Zoland, a novel about the concentration camps during the Vicky Period in France in Pithiviers and Beaune la Rolande.\n\nIn 2003 she was awarded a fellowship at the Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Institute to work on a historical novel based on the life on the Marquise de la Tour du Pin, a French aristocrat who escaped the Terror by bringing her family to Albany, New York. Also that year she published her third volume of short stories, “Stories from Another World” with the Ontario Review Press.\n\nShe won the Antioch Review Prize in 2004 for work in that magazine. Both “ The Perfect Place” and “Miracles in America” came out in England with Jonathan Cape and in paperback with Vintage International. “The Perfect Place” was translated into French, German, Japanese, and Portuguese.\n\nHer fifth novel, “Crossways,” came out in October, 2004, also, with the Ontario Review Press edited by Raymond Smith and Joyce Carol Oates. It received a starred Kirkus Review and is out in paperback with the Other Press as well as “The Perfect Place.”\n\nKohler has published essays in The Boston Globe, Salmagundi (summer 2004, 2009), The Bellevue Literary magazine, and O Magazine,”The Heart Speaks” ( May 2004), “What Happy Ever After Really Looks Like” (2008) and reviews in The New Leader and Bomb as well as essays in The American Scholar in 2014 and 2015.\n\nKohler began teaching at The Writer’s Voice in 1990, going on from there to teach at SUNY Purchase, Sarah Lawrence, Colgate, CCNY , Bennington and Columbia. She has taught creative writing at Princeton since 2008 and now teaches freshman seminars there .\n\nSheila’s sixth novel, “Bluebird or the Invention of Happiness” was published in 2007, and the paperback was published with Berkely in 2008. “The Transitional Object” in Boulevard won an O.Henry prize and is included in the 2008 volume.\n\nHer tenth book, “Becoming Jane Eyre” came out with Viking Penguin in December, 2009, and was a New York Times editor’s pick. Casey Cep wrote in the Boston Globe about this novel: “With an appreciation for their craft and sympathy for their difficult profession, Kohler’s “Becoming Jane Eyre’’ is a tender telling of the Brontë family’s saga and the stories they told.”\n\nHer eleventh book “Love Child” was published by Penguin in America and by La Table Ronde in France. In June of 2012, her twelfth book “The Bay of Foxes,” was published by Penguin. “Dreaming for Freud” was published by Penguin in 2014. It will be translated into Turkish\n\nIn 2013 the story, “Magic Man” was published in Best American Short Stories.\n\nSheila Kohler published her memoir “Once we were sisters” in 2017 with Penguin in America and with Canongate in England and Alba in Spain. Sheila’s latest novel is “Open Secrets” published by Penguin in July 2020.\n\nKohler currently lives in New York and Amagansett.\n\n***\n\nIn other news, I am taking a sabbatical from the podcast this summer to rest and regroup and figure out what direction to take this show in in the future. I love doing it but every now and then I think it’s a good idea to re-evaluate and hone in on what has been valuable and what parts need to go.\n\nMy first guest in the fall is Tim Tomlinson. Although I will be talking to him about one of his short stories, he does a have new book coming out this month. Looks terrific!\n\nCheers!\n\nKelly\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSheila Kohler\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nWe’re a little late with this episode and it’s all my fault! For the first time in four years, I conducted an amazing interview with Sheila Kohler and forgot to hit record on Zoom. ACK!! Then, Sheila–who is possibly the most gracious person on Earth–forgave me for wasting 45 minutes of her time and agreed to re-record the episode. Unfortunately, this didn’t leave enough time for Elliot Bancel to edit the episode by May 1st so it will be a few days late.\n\nThank you to Sheila! I loved Cracks, the short story, the novel, and the movie! You will find links to all three below. It was fascinating to talk about Sheila’s adaptation from short story to novel, also, to hear about the making of the movie and the decision to set the movie in England rather than South Africa.\n\nI hope the delay in the podcast will allow you time to read both the short story and the novel and possibly watch the movie before listening to our discussion. I know that’s a big ask, but there is a lot to learn from the close study of all three versions. If you invest the time, you will be greatly enriched by the experience, I promise.\n\nHere are the links:\n\nCracks, the short story, by Sheila Kohler first published in The Paris Review.\n\nCracks, The Novel by Sheila Kohler, available at Bookshop and Amazon.\n\nCracks, The Movie\n\nSee you on May 15th!\n\nCheers,\n\nKelly\n\nBio:\n\nSheila Kohler was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the younger of two girls.

I’m joined on the podcast by Keith Hood, One Story’s 2024 Adina Talve-Goodman Fellow. Keith read the version of the story available in Alice Munro’s collection (1st person POV) and I read the New Yorker version. I suggest reading both as we had a great discussion about POV and narrative distance and Alice Munro’s decision to switch POV. Please find the stories here:\n\nThe Progress of Love from Alice Munro’s collection or her Selected Stories available for purchase on Amazon or Bookshop.\n\nThe New Yorker Version typed by Kelly is available below and available only for the month of April with possible typos. After April, please purchase a subscription and support good writing at The New Yorker here.\n\nAs always, I’d love to hear any suggestions for upcoming guests and/or possible stories for review. We always appreciate ratings, reviews, or donations (see the donation button on this page). If you have any ideas, comments, or additional insights into this story, please message me on the Let’s Deconstruct a Story Facebook Page. I’d love to add additional comments to this page (below) so check back over time for more insights.\n\nI hope you enjoy the show!\n\nKelly\n\nLet’s Deconstruct a Story on Apple\n\nLet’s Deconstruct a Story on Spotify\n\nARTICLES AND BOOKS REFERENCED IN THIS PODCAST\n\n“Switchback Time” by Joan Silber\n\n“The Long-Clock Story” by Amy Gustine\n\nThe Mookes and The Gripes thoughts on “The Progress of Love.”\n\nTantalizing Silences: Articulating Pain in “.The Progress of Love”\n\nThe Erotics of Restraint: Essays on Literary Form\n\nDouglas Glover (Author\n\nGuest, Keith Hood:\n\nMostly true stuff even though not true of me. A Google search reveals that someone who shares Keith Hood’s name is a Compliance Director in Hoboken, NJ, a Senior Military Advisor in Washington D.C., and Managing Director of Warner Financial Services in the UK where a different Keith Hood established a thriving photographic business. Other Keith Hoods have experience in the medical field as dentist, periodontist, plastic surgeon, and ophthalmologist. A Keith Hood MD has written numerous articles in medical journals including, “Hematomas in Aesthetic Surgery.”(Again, I’m not that Keith Hood although I’ve written lots of short stories and essays (see Publications) but I’ve never written any medical articles. I don’t even have a college degree. I have never been a male or female prostitute, an operas singer or athlete. Despite rumors to the contrary, I have never been a staff writer for Star Trek: The Next Generation (although I tried my damnedest). Countless LinkedIn profiles say of various Keith Hoods that he is “an all-around splendid person.” For more on this Keith Hood, visit his website ⁠here. ⁠\n\nPodcast Host Kelly Fordon:\n\nKelly Fordon’s latest short story collection, I Have the Answer (Wayne State University Press, 2020), was chosen as a Midwest Book Award Finalist and an Eric Hoffer Finalist. Her 2016 Michigan Notable Book, Garden for the Blind (WSUP), was an INDIEFAB Finalist, a Midwest Book Award Finalist, an Eric Hoffer Finalist, and an IPPY Awards Bronze Medalist. Her first full-length poetry collection, Goodbye Toothless House (Kattywompus Press, 2019), was an Eyelands International Prize Finalist and an Eric Hoffer Finalist. It was later adapted into a play by Robin Martin and published in The Kenyon Review Online. She is the author of three award-winning poetry chapbooks and has received a Best of the Net Award and Pushcart Prize nominations in three different genres. She teaches at Springfed Arts in Detroit and online.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nWe had so much fun discussing Leigh Newman’s short story, “An Extravaganza in Two Acts” available here from Electric Literature. You are going to learn so much about writing historical fiction. Leigh is a hoot! The conversation moved at a clip, so I have some discussion notes for you below.\n\nAlso, check out the bonus question one of my earlier guests, award-winning author and Pulitzer-prize nominated journalist, Desiree Cooper, sent to Leigh after we recorded the podcast.\n\nWe have a new Let’s Deconstruct a Story Facebook page and Instagram page. I’d love to see you there. Please like or follow it, if you have a chance, and feel free to post questions or comments or suggestions for future guests.\n\nHere’s a link to the podcast on Apple, Spotify, and Audible.\n\nNext month, I’ll be talking to Cara Blue Adams about her short story, “Vision,” available here. You might consider buying Cara Blue Adams’ book, You Never Get it Back, from Bookshop because my co-host for that podcast, Vincent Perrone, is part owner of Book Suey in Hamtramck, and all sales that roll through Bookshop next month will support his store.\n\nThe transcript is available for a small fee on my store page. I have to charge for these transcripts because I pay for them out of pocket. I hope we have enough revenue someday to make them free!\n\nHappy reading!\n\nKelly\n\nPS: Do you have trouble sleeping? If so, I highly recommend Nothing Much Happens, Bedtime Stories for Grown-ups by Kathryn Nicolai. Apparently, Kathryn also lives in Michigan. I don’t know her, but I’m obsessed with these bedtime stories because they are designed to put you to sleep, and her voice is very soothing, but they are also wonderful. If you are in the mood for delightful, feel-good stories, check them out here.\n\nPSS: I have to give one television show a plug…I was listening to a podcast featuring a former classmate from Kenyon, and she suggested a Swedish show called The Restaurant. IT IS SO GOOD. It’s winter here in Detroit, and bleak bleak bleak, so I figured, like me, you might want to light some candles and curl up with a good drama. This one is cutting into my reading time, which is the highest praise from me. Let me know what you think!!\n\nDiscussion Notes:\n\nShawn Vestal, Godforsaken Idaho\n\nFitzcarraldo Werner Herzog\n\nCook Inlet’s Deadly Mud Flats\n\nDeadwood\n\nDesiree Cooper’s Question for Leigh Newman:\n\nI’ve been ploughing through “Extravaganza.” It’s really fascinating. On my second read, I’m paying a lot more attention to the diction, the masterful descriptions, the use of internal rhyme, alliteration, etc. It’s a great story to teach from, plus, it has a stunning female protagonist who we only get to know through her guardian’s POV. My question is how Newman made the POV decision? Did she ever consider Genevieve’s? I can imagine me using this story for some of my workshops. Thanks for bringing it to my attention!\n\nLeigh Newman’s answer:\n\nOh wow! This is a really interesting question. I think a lot about point of view because I’m really very at home with third person and so I find first person to be tricky. I often use it just as an exercise and some of my best stories have been written in first person, but it’s a serious undertaking for me. I never considered setting Genevieve story in Genevieve ‘s voice. It was always his story about her because he was looking at her and loving her but I do think it might’ve been really interesting to have what she felt spoken.\n\nBio: Leigh Newman’s collection Nobody Gets Out Alive (Scribner) was long-listed for the National Book Award for Fiction and The Story Prize. Her stories have appeared in the Paris Review, Harper’s, Best American Short Stories 2020, Best American Mystery and Suspense 2023, Tin House, McSweeney’s Quarterly Concern, One Story and Electric Literature, and have been awarded a Pushcart prize and an American Society of Magazine Editors’ fiction prize. Still Points North (Dial Press), her memoir about growing up in Alaska, was a finalist for the National Book Critic Circle’s John Leonard prize. In 2020, she received the Paris Review’s Terry Southern Prize for “humor, wit, and sprezzatura.”\n\nNewman’s essays and book reviews have appeared in The New York Times, Bookforum, Vogue, O The Oprah Magazine, and other magazines. When not writing, she looks after her two dogs, two kids, and one cat. Goals include: goats and more chickens.\n\nLeigh’s books are available here on Bookshop and here on Amazon.\n\nPodcast Host: Kelly Fordon’s latest short story collection, I Have the Answer (Wayne State University Press, 2020), was chosen as a Midwest Book Award Finalist and an Eric Hoffer Finalist.

This month I’m talking to Jai Chakrabarti about his wonderful story, “A Small Sacrifice for an Enormous Happiness.” Please find the link to the story here at LitHub. It’s best to read the story before listening to the podcast.\n\nPlease listen to the podcast on Spotify here or Apple here or Audible here or pretty much anywhere you get your podcasts!\n\nBio:\n\nO. Henry and Pushcart Prize winner Jai Chakrabarti is the author of the novel A Play for the End of the World (Knopf ’21), which earned him the National Jewish Book Award for debut fiction. The novel was also recognized as the Association of Jewish Libraries Honor Book, a finalist for the Rabindranath Tagore Prize, and long-listed for the PEN/Faulkner Award.\n\nChakrabarti is also the author of the story collection A Small Sacrifice for an Enormous Happiness (Knopf), which was included in several end-of-year lists, including The New Yorker’s Best Books of 2023. His short fiction has been published in Best American Short Stories, Ploughshares, One Story, Electric Literature, A Public Space, Conjunctions, and elsewhere and performed on Selected Shorts by Symphony Space.\n\nBeyond fiction, Chakrabarti’s nonfiction has been widely published in journals such as The Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, Writer’s Digest, Berfrois, and LitHub. He was an Emerging Writer Fellow with A Public Space and holds an MFA in Creative Writing from Brooklyn College. Despite his literary pursuits, Chakrabarti is also a trained computer scientist.\n\nBorn in Kolkata, India, he currently lives in New York with his family and is a faculty member at Bennington Writing Seminars.\n\nJai’s books are available on Bookshop or Amazon.\n\nNext month, I’ll be talking to Leigh Newman about her story, “An Extravaganza in Two Acts,” also available via Electric Literature. If you have any questions for Leigh, feel free to contact me, and I will pass them along.\n\nAlso, I’ve switched over to Let’s Deconstruct a Story accounts on both Facebook and Instagram. Please follow us on Facebook and Instagram as well as Spotify or Apple.\n\nI was hoping to send out a newsletter with my big list of 2023 resources/books/recommendations, but I have to be honest, 2023 was a TOUGH year, so I have compiled a small resources list (below) and hope you will enjoy it. Cheers to more great stories in 2024!\n\n2023 Recommendations:\n\nI read 52 books (besides short story collections) this year and although I can’t manage a “best of” list, four books really stuck with me:\n\nThe Poetics of Wrongness by Rachel Zucker\n\nDemon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver\n\nHappening by Annie Ernaux\n\nThe Vaster Wilds by Lauren Groff\n\nIt goes without saying, I was truly inspired by the work of every short story writer who visited the podcast in 2023!\n\nHere is the complete list of 2023 Let’s Deconstruct a Story Guests plus links to their work:\n\nKevin Fitton\n\nJulie Ann Stewart\n\nMeghan Louise Wagner\n\nRobin Luce Martin\n\nAnna Caritj\n\nCaroline Kim\n\nChad B. Anderson\n\nGeorge Singleton\n\nBonnie Jo Campbell\n\nKatherine Vaz\n\nThank you so much to everyone who visited the show in 2023!\n\nIn other news, in May 2023 I created and launched an audiobook.\n\nMy short story collection, I Have the Answer, was published by Wayne State University Press in April 2020. The timing alone would have been what I like to call a suckitude, but the press was also going through a kerfuffle, so the book just sort of floated off into the ether.\n\nIn 2023, I asked for (and graciously received) the audiobook rights from WSUP. With the help of sound engineer, Elliot Bancel, I contacted five audiobook narrators and read a few stories myself. I am terrible at self-promotion, but I am proud of it so wanted to give it a year-end shout out.\n\nCheck it out here.\n\nLastly, a couple of writing resources:\n\nI LOVED the generative experiments offered by Gabriela Denise Frank through the Poetry Foundation. I took this one-day seminar late in a very tough year (2023-epic suckitude) and was completely bowled over by this class and her teaching technique. I was tempted–like Gollum–to keep this information to myself, but I am sharing it here against my better judgement.\n\nDid you know you can join Off Campus Writers Workshop even if you don’t live in Chicago? And if you join for a nominal fee, all of their weekly classes are $10 a piece. This year they are hosting Peter Orner, Charles Baxter, and many other luminaries.\n\nEvery year I complete a year-end review offered by Annette Gendler and I have to say that even though I will be glad to say adieu to 2023, I actually wrote a lot more than I realized, and I only know this because I took the time to complete this inventory. It might make you feel MUCH better about your writing life. Here’s the link.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nKelly\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHi!\n\nI am so happy to share my podcast interview with the esteemed Southern writer George Singleton. We delved into some serious subjects: the legacy of racism in the South, gun control, and substance abuse, but despite all of that we managed to laugh every now and then because he is hilarious!\n\n(And I said the word “interesting” about a gazillion times–Why? Why did I keep saying the same word over and over again as if I was malfunctioning?)\n\nAnyway, George taught me a lot about persevering despite the fact that he (like many of us) gets sick of his own voice. He shared an anecdote about working with C. Michael Curtis of “The Atlantic Monthly” that shocked and delighted me.\n\nWe laughed about that too.\n\nPlease read his story, “I’m Down Here on the Floor,” before you listen to the podcast on Apple, Spotify, Audible, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nMy apologies to StorySouth. I forgot to mention where the story was published during the podcast, but this is actually the second story in a row from StorySouth. Check out Jason Ockert’s story “The Peoplemachines” from the September 1st episode as well. Thanks to Dan Wickett of Dzanc for these suggestions!\n\nAlso, here’s a link to The Atlantic Monthly story George mentioned called “Show and Tell.” I think the paywall might be down now (?) but I subscribe to that magazine so someone needs to let me know.\n\n*Warning: There is some profanity on this episode, folks.\n\nSee you next month when I’ll be talking to Bonnie Jo Campbell about her story, “Boar Taint,” from The Kenyon Review.\n\nCheers,\n\nKelly\n\nBio: George Singleton has published eight collections of stories, two novels, and a book of writing advice. Over 200 of his stories have appeared in magazines such as the Atlantic Monthly, Harper’s, Playboy, the Georgia Review, the Southern Review, the Cincinnati Review, and elsewhere. He is the recipient of a Pushcart Prize, a Guggenheim fellowship, the Hillsdale Award from the Fellowship of Southern Writers, and the Corrington Award for Literary Excellence. He lives in Spartanburg, SC, where he holds the John C. Cobb Chair in Humanities at Wofford College. Please find his books on Bookshop or Amazon.\n\nWe are so grateful to sound engineer Elliot Bancel for his work on this episode. If you need help with your podcast, please find his contact information here.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nThis month I’m taking a pause from Let’s Deconstruct a Story to launch my audiobook I Have the Answer.\n\nThe print edition of my short story collection, I Have the Answer, came out from Wayne State University Press (@WSUPress) in April 2020.\n\nNot an auspicious time for a launch.\n\nIt was tough, even though I had a fantastic publicist, Gregory Henry, who landed many online gigs. I was very grateful to him, but it was not the same as launching a book in the real world.\n\nIn 2022, I decided I wanted to give the book a second shot at life, and WSUP generously offered me the rights to the audiobook. Now I have some intel on the process, and I’d love to share a little bit for the other writers out there who may be considering this route.\n\nFirst, I have to say that with very limited funding–I had already paid for a publicist–I had to rely on ACX, which is an affiliate of Amazon (audible). I would have preferred to offer the book on libro.fm or through another independent venue, but honestly, for financial reasons, I had no choice. Signing an exclusive contract with Audible was by far the cheapest option.\n\nOn ACX, narrators post auditions and you can choose the narrator for your audiobook. Luckily I have a friend (shout out to Robin Martin) who introduced me to @DeniceStradling and she kindly narrated three stories. I met @GriffinPuatu, Simone Brooks and Tom Fria through the ACX auditions. I contacted Stacey Glemboski after listening to her reading a story from Lily King’s short story collection, Five Tuesdays in Winter (@lilybooks), and I recorded four of the stories myself.\n\nThe most important component? My new friend and sound engineer extraordinaire, Elliot Bancel! I was very fortunate that Paul Bancel, a fantastic writer I met at the Springfed Arts conference last fall, introduced me to his son, Elliot. Elliot had just moved home from Chicago and was willing to help me. He was kind and patient as I attempted to read the stories myself–yikes. He also sound edited and uploaded the entire collection and advised me on the purchase of a reasonable microphone and headset . In other words, without his help, the book would not exist.\n\nIf you are in need of any sound engineering help at all, I am including Elliot’s contact information below as well as samples of three of the narrators (more samples will follow in the June 1st newsletter) as well as the ACX link.\n\nHere’s the scary part about this….\n\nI hope after all of this, someone will purchase the book. As most writers know, we barely break even in this business, and if we do, we often consider that success. My goal is to just break even. In order to do that, I will have to sell at least 100 copies of this audiobook, which is a lot for an independent author.\n\nLinks to more information and three clips from I Have the Answer below. I’ll post the rest of the clips in June.\n\nLet’s Deconstruct a Story returns on June 1st with a visit from Anna Caritj. We will be discussing her @sewaneereview story, “Ugly Sister.”\n\nCheers!\n\nKelly\n\nPurchase the audiobook here.\n\nACX: http://www.acx.com.\n\nYou can reach sound engineer, Elliot Bancel at: elliotbancel@gmail.com\n\nReach out to Denice Stradling here.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nRobin and I have been good friends and writing buddies since we met at a writer’s conference in 2008. Since then, she has won numerous awards for her work and I am so thrilled to feature her brilliant writing here.\n\nWe did something a little bit different for this episode. We talked about two of her stories: “1969” featured at The New Orleans Review and “Through the Hole” a story up on PenDust Radio.\n\nTo get the most out of this podcast episode, it would be best to read and listen to these two stories first.\n\nMany thanks to Elliot Bancel for his help editing this episode.\n\nThe podcast is available on:\n\nApple\n\nAudible\n\nSpotify\n\nor wherever you get your podcasts!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nKelly\n\nBio:\n\nRobin Luce Martin’s honors for stories and novel excerpts include the Tennessee Williams Festival Story First Prize, San Francisco PEN John Keats Soul Awakening Story Competitions, Old Scores won the 2019 Novel Manuscript and Lizardmaid 2020 Eyelands International 3Rock prize.

Devastating in their revelations, yet hopeful in their commitment to perseverance, these lecture-essays of protest and reckoning resist the notion of being wrong as a stopping point on the road to being right, and insist on wrongness as an analytical lens and way of reading, writing, and living that might create openness, connection, humility, and engagement. Expanded from lectures presented for the Bagley Wright Lecture Series in 2016, Zucker’s deft dismantling of outdated paradigms of motherhood, aesthetics, feminism, poetics, and politics feel prescient in their urgent destabilization of post-war thinking. In her four essay-lectures (and an appendix of selected, earlier prose), Zucker calls Sharon Olds, Bernadette Mayer, Emily Dickinson, Adrienne Rich, Alice Notley, Natalie Diaz, Allen Ginsberg, Marina Abramović, and Audre Lorde—among others—into the conversation. This book marks a turning point in Zucker’s significant body of work, documenting her embrace of the multivocality of interview in her podcasting, and resisting the univocality of the lecture as a form of wrongness in and of itself.\n\nIn this workshop, we’ll discuss the first essay in Zucker’s book during the first hour, and write a little bit ourselves during the second hour. People who would like to share their work are always encouraged to do so, but it is not required.
