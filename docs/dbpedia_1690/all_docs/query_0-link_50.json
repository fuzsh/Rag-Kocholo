        "text": "Four Stories was an award-winning literary series founded in 2005 by the writer Tracy Slater to bridge Greater Boston’s nightlife and arts communities. Each event took place in a club, bar, or lounge, and featured some of the most acclaimed authors in the nation, all reading their work under a unified theme. In 2006, the series expanded to Japan, with events in both Tokyo and Osaka.\n\nThe idea: to bring writers and readers, intellectuals and club-goers, friends and interested people together in a more upscale environment than a bookstore, to think, drink, eat, talk, laugh, hear stories, trade tales. Each event was designed to be simple, amusing, thought-provoking, free for entry, and open to the public.\n\nThe experience: like a 19th-Century salon, only 150 years later―same socializing, same witty banter, corsets optional.\n\nThe Four Stories style of literary investigation: if you asked the best question, you won a free drink!\n\nSELECT READINGS ON MP3\n\nLit Crawl/Four Stories, a special installment of the Boston Book Festival 2017 Lit Crawl | Salon Acote 132 Newbury Street 10/26/17\n\nOlivia Kate Cerrone, author of The Hunger Saint, a historical novella about the child miners of Sicily (MP3)\n\nE.
