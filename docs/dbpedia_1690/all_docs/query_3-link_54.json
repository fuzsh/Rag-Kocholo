        "text": "This year we’re celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Carnation Revolution, the military coup that ended the authoritarian Estado Novo regime and began Portugal’s transition to democracy. You can read more about the events of April 25, 1974 here.\n\nFrom its founding in 1945, and particularly under the leadership (from 1965) of Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen, our partner organization the Centro Nacional de Cultura served as a haven for writers, artists, and the free exchange of ideas. Over the past few months, they’ve been posting interviews from their archives about the role of the CNC in building the foundations of a free culture in Portugal – all available here in Portuguese.\n\nWe’re grateful for the opportunity to gather as writers in this historic space, and to celebrate this milestone year with our friends at the CNC.\n\nThe debut novel from Disquiet alum Nora Lange arrives in September 2024 from Two Dollar Radio! You can preorder it here.\n\n“Us Fools is a boisterous, irreverent, and moving novel about two sisters growing up in an America that doesn’t much care for them or their midwestern farming family. With comic tenderness and with an unforgettable, ferocious voice, Nora Lange paints a remarkable portrait of connection and alienation, of love and heartbreak, and all points in between.” —Edan Lepucki"
