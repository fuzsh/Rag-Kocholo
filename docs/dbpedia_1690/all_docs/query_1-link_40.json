        "text": "Book of the Month is a subscription box in which members choose up to 3 hardcover books to receive each month. Once you become a BOTM BFF, you can receive up to 5 books per month.\n\nYou can sign up here to get your first book for $5.\n\nEvery month, I make (pretty accurate) predictions about which books will be featured by Book of the Month (BOTM). I take a lot of time to research upcoming releases, analyze past selections, and choose books that are solid bets.\n\nNovember and December are publishingâ€™s slowest months. This means that fewer books are released, and BOTM has fewer books to choose from. Because December has the fewest releases (and because I ran out of time), I have not included any December books as early releases in these predictions. Since October 31st is a Tuesday, I think there is a strong likelihood that we will see a few books published then as selections.\n\nWith November 1st falling on a Wednesday, I think the books are likely to drop Monday or Tuesday. Wednesday is also a possibility but to a lesser extent.\n\nContemporary & Literary Fiction\n\nI considered including a number of additional books in this genre. I wavered whether to include a few books but ultimately ruled them out, including Again and Again by Jonathan Evison and The Happy Couple by Naoise Dolan.\n\nHistorical Fiction\n\nThere were also a few choices I went back and forth on but ultimately did not include: The Liberators by E.J. Koh and Last Night at the Hollywood Canteen by Sarah James.\n\nRomance\n\nBOTM has been light on the romance picks this year. I know Sophie Cousens is a previous BOTM author; however, it looks like Aardvark snagged her November release, The Good Part. There is a possibility BOTM could also carry it, but since that has not happened, I am doubtful.\n\nThrillers & Mysteries\n\nI waffled about a couple of books, primarily The Manor House by Gilly Macmillian, but ultimately left it off my prediction list.\n\nFantasy, Science Fiction, & Magical Realism\n\nYoung & New Adult\n\nNonfiction"
