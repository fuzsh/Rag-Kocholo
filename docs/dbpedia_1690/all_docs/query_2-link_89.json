In the social media age, atrocity often reaches us in 140-character packages. Conversely, witness literature focuses a wide narrative lens on the subject. Why write fiction over nonfiction? What moral and ethical questions do writers confront along the way? How do craft and truth intersect? Five authors with varying degrees of closeness to their subjects discuss how they bear witness through fiction.\n\nDiscussion with Lorraine Adams (Harbor), Julie Wu (The Third Son), and Nayomi Munaweera (Island of a Thousand Mirrors), Moderated by Naomi Benaron (Running the Rift)\n\nGraywolf Press 40th Anniversary Reading\n\nWashington State Convention Center, Room 615/616/617, Level 6\n\n10:30 am to 11:45 am\n\nIn 2014, Graywolf Press celebrates forty years of publishing essential works of contemporary literature.

Panel moderated by Terry Hong.\n\nAs national borders disintegrate through war and technology, fictional ones do not necessarily follow suite, often staying true to place; but must writers whose lives are political, and who function as spokespersons for worlds that American readers may never visit, write politics into their art? Writers with ties to current debates about Iran, Palestine, Algeria, Sri Lanka, Mexico, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, discuss the burden of truth and the choices they make as cultural translators.\n\nThe Road Less Traveled: How to be a Writer Without a Full-time Academic Gig\n\nI will be speaking on this panel along with Cheryl Strayed, Steve Almond, Amy Holman, Christian TeBordo, and Marisa de los Santos\n\nThe path to solvency and security for most writers is to pair writing with full-time jobs in academia. On this panel, six authors will talk about their lives as writers without the de facto college teaching gig. Panelists will discuss the range of ways they’ve supported themselves, the reasons they’ve chosen the paths they have, and also the liberations and constraints they’ve experienced as writers outside the writer-faculty track that’s so deeply embedded in what it means to be a writer today.\n\nChicago, IL\n\nFebruary 29th – March 3rd, 2012\n\nAssociation of Writers & Writing Programs (AWP)\n\nI will be rocking the book launch party for Eugene Cross’ fantastic debut fiction collection, Fires of Our Choosing, getting my daily laps at the book fair and keeping the lobby bar in business while also making dozens of last-minute plans, listening to some fabulous writers and having A Proper Breakfast each morning. I will also be serious and erudite at the following official events:\n\nThursday, March 1st: 10.30 – 11.45\n\nContinental C, Hilton Chicago, Lobby Level\n\nR129. Troubling the Label: When Does a Text Become Feminist?\n\n(Arielle Greenberg, Cate Marvin, Amal Amireh, Eloise Healy, Ru Freeman)\n\nFrom conception to critique, what is the significance of when the label is applied? Does it matter who applies it? How do we interpret works of literature through a contemporary feminist context? So to Speak: A Feminist Journal of Language and Art brings together writers, publishers, and academics to discuss the stage at which a work is labeled feminist and the issues implicated with labeling, writing, and publishing socially conscious work.\n\nThursday, March 1st: 3 – 4.15pm\n\nR214. Writing Class: Representing Socioeconomic Realities in Your Work\n\nWiliford B, Hilton Chicago, 3rd Floor\n\nCourtney Tenz, Josh Weil, Ru Freeman, Sabra Wineteer, Ta-Nehisi Coates.)\n\nAs economic realities devolve the broader American Dream, writers are shaping a new U.S. life narrative. This panel collects contemporary authors’ responses to this socioeconomic shift by asking: will class-focused writing replace the American race and ethnicity paradigm? Can such a shift illuminate the differences in income and status and lead to greater understanding? Or will the money gap cut out most socioeconomic classes and usher in a new era of class appropriation in literature?"
