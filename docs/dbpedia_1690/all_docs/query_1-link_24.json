        "text": "All Genres\n\nI'm the NYT-bestselling author of eight books in a variety of genres, most recently Beowulf: A New Translation, and The Mere Wife. My reimagining of Vergil's Aeneid into a full-cast musical for Audible came out in 2023. I've taught at Sarah Lawrence and Bennington College, and as well as teaching dozens of masterclasses and workshops at universities around the world. For the Shipman Agency Workroom, I've taught workshops on finding your voice, adapting the classics into contemporary work, and editing yourself, among others. Over the twenty years or so since I sold my first book, I've often consulted with writers (some of whose names you'd know!), helping them develop projects from ideas to actualities, line-editing drafts, and giving intricate editorial feedback. I've done everything from full novel responses to inspiration sessions in which a writer tells me what they find intriguing, and we develop it together. Many people who've worked with me have felt that I helped equip them with the inspiration to begin believing in their projects. I want you to get what you need to go deeper in your work, and I'll help you find the right tools. That's my natural inclination no matter what the project.\n\nMy consultations are pretty flexible for that reason. I'm happy to work with people who don't have manuscripts yet, as long as they have a sense of something they're dreaming of writing, and some work samples so I can tell if we'll be a good fit. If you don't have a manuscript yet, we'll have a couple of video sessions to begin plotting a course, with research suggestions, creative brainstorming, and discussions of your personal map of inspirations. We'll make a plan that suits your workstyle. Typically, I meet on Zoom with writers twice a month in an ongoing development scenario, but we can work out a plan depending on what your project is - smaller projects, like short stories, may be more suited for written feedback.\n\nI charge hourly because I want you to have the flexibility to choose the engagement - and because I'm available to work on many different kinds of projects, in a variety of different ways.\n\nAs a writer, I have experience in almost every corner of a storymaking career, whether it's nonfiction, fiction, scripts, translation, memoir, poetry - I've done it all. If I wasn't a writer for a living, I'd be an editor, because I love editing just as much as I love writing.\n\nMy style is both empathetic and pragmatic. I'll tell you what's great, what's wobbly, and what's not working - along with questions and suggestions for how to craft the piece you want to craft."
