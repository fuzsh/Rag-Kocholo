        "text": "The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, an international champion for picture book art, and its creators, has announced the 2024 Carle Honors Honorees. These distinguished individuals will be awarded at the Benefit Gala at the New-York Historical Society, in New York City, on Thursday, September 26, 2024. Now in its 17th year, the gala remains focused on individuals and organizations whose creative vision and long-term dedication have had a profound effect on picture book art and the vital role they play in the children’s literature community.\n\n“The children’s book world has no shortage of awards and accolades but the Carle Honors is the only one that is designed to acknowledge the whole, far-flung community of gifted and generous people and organizations that together perform the vital work of creating the best children’s books and getting them out to all who benefit from them,” said Leonard S. Marcus, Carle Trustee, children’s literature historian, and chairman and founder of the Carle Honors Committee.\n\nThis year’s Honors boasts a new venue and format with the goal of inspiring the joy felt through engagement with the Museum. The presentation of awards will feature honoree tributes from Grace Lin, Dr. Claudette S. McLinn, and more. A special musical revue with Marlo Thomas and Friends will pay homage to the 50th anniversary exhibition of the book Free to Be…. You and Me, which will open at The Carle in November 2024. A reception with cocktails, food, and mingling will follow for all. In lieu of an auction, The Carle will spotlight the newest artworks added to our significant permanent collection including pieces by Ludwig Bemelmans, Lucy Cousins, Leo and Diane Dillon, Barry Moser, LeUyen Pham, Beatrix Potter, and Mo Willems, among others, and honoring those artists who contributed these works.\n\nThe 2024 Carle Honors honorees are:\n\nThe Carle Honors Honorees are selected each year by a committee chaired by Marcus. The committee recognizes four distinct awards: Artist, for lifelong innovation in the field; Angel, whose generous resources are crucial to making illustrated children’s book art exhibitions, education programs, and related projects a reality; Bridge, individuals or organizations who have found inspired ways to bring the art of the picture book to larger audiences through work in other fields, and Mentor, editors, designers, and educators who champion the art form.\n\nSponsorships and Donations\n\nThe Carle Honors is a key fundraiser for The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, and all proceeds support the Museum’s mission. Macmillan Children’s Books is the Exclusive Premier Sponsor of the 2024 Honors. Committee Hosts are Suzanne Collins and Cap Pryor, Jane Bayard Curley, Janet and William Gorth, and Katherine Vaz and Christopher Cerf. Additional hosting opportunities and corporate and individual sponsorships are available. A portion of every ticket purchased will support the attendance of select artists and educators through an Inspiration Fund. For immediate details about these, please contact Rebecca Miller Goggins, director of development at 413-559-6308 or rebeccag@carlemuseum.org.\n\nAbout The Museum\n\nCo-founded by Eric and Barbara Carle in 2002, The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art is the international champion of picture book art. Situated on 7.5 acres in Amherst, Massachusetts, The Carle houses a rich and deep collection of art, and illuminates its collection through exhibitions, education, programming, and art-making—making it a critical resource for picture book artists and authors, and art-loving communities locally, nationally, and abroad. The Carle’s mission is to elevate picture book art and inspire a love of art, art creation, and reading. Since opening its doors more than 20 years ago, The Carle has welcomed more than one million visitors—plus more than four million additional museum-goers who have enjoyed its touring exhibitions around the world.\n\nThe Carle’s permanent collection includes over 9,000 works of art by over 300 artists. The art in the permanent collection dates from the late 19th century to the present and consists primarily of works on paper, including significant holdings by artists Ashley Bryan, Remy Charlip, Antonio Frasconi, Leo Lionni, Arnold Lobel, Petra Mathers, Alice Bolam Preston, William Steig, Susanne Suba, Simms Taback, and Leonard Weisgard. Educational offerings include professional training for educators around the country and master’s degree programs in children’s literature in partnership with Simmons University.\n\nMore than 2,500+ students, educators, and librarians participate in The Carle’s youth outreach and professional development programs per year. The Carle Community Fund, which launched in 2019, covers Museum admission for low-income families, field trip fees for schoolchildren at Title One Schools, and professional development fees for early childhood educators and Title One school teachers and librarians. For online visitors, the Museum offers a wealth of digital resources, including art activities, book lists, collections art, exhibition videos, and workshops.\n\nEvery year, The Carle’s exhibitions travel to museums in the US and abroad, including cities in New York, Texas, Michigan, and Iowa, as well as internationally in Japan, China, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan, ensuring museums everywhere can introduce new audiences to the joy of picture book art. The Museum offers digital resources, including art activities, book recommendations, collections, exhibition videos, and workshops for online visitors.
