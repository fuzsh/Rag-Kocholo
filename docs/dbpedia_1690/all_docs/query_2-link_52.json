His first novel, Nenhum Olhar (published as Blank Gaze in the UK and as The Implacable Order of Things in the US), was shortlisted in all major literary awards in Portugal and won the José Saramago Literary Award. In 2007, his novel Cemitério de Pianos (published as The Piano Cemetery in the UK) won the Calamo Award for the best-translated novel published in Spain. The novel Galveias, published in 2016, received the Oceanos Literature Award, which is given to the best novel written in all Portuguese-speaking countries. His books have been shortlisted for the Portugal Telecom Prize, the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and the Femina Prize. In the realm of poetry achievements, Gaveta de Papéis was presented with the Daniel Faria Award, and A Criança em Ruínas received the Portuguese Society of Authors (Sociedade Portuguesa de Autores) Award. A short story collection, Antídoto, a joint project with the heavy metal band Moonspell, brought in new readers worldwide and was published as Antidote in the US. Peixoto’s first foray into travel literature, Dentro do Segredo: Uma Viagem na Coreia do Norte (Inside the Secret: A Journey in North Korea), was published in 2012. Peixoto has since published a second travelogue about Thailand, O Caminho Imperfeito, and is a contributing columnist to travel magazines in Portugal and Brazil. An anthology of his previous poetry books, A Child in Ruins, was published in the US in 2016."
