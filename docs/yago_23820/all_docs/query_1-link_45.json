        "text": "There's a peculiar fascination about ambitious unfinished works that listeners, viewers and readers are left to complete in their minds. In cinema there are a string of pictures left in tantalisingly fragmentary form due to illnesses, accidents or deaths, among them Eisenstein's Que Viva México! , Renoir's Une Partie de Campagne, Von Sternberg's I, Claudius, Welles's Don Quixote and Munk's The Passenger. To this number must be added L'Enfer, which Clouzot, the greatest French filmmaker to emerge in the 1940s, embarked on in 1964.\n\nThe 57-year-old director of Les Diaboliques and The Wages of Fear set out to challenge the arrogant new-wave arrivistes by making the ultimate auteurist film, a study of pathological jealousy using state-of-the-art aural and visual effects to convey states of mind. Columbia Studios gave him carte blanche, and Clouzot went ahead with Serge Regianni and Romy Schneider starring and three full camera crews. But he began acting like the crazy director in Fellini's 8½ (a picture he sought to emulate), lost all sense of urgency, drove Regianni to collapse and himself had a heart attack. The insurers coughed up.\n\nSerge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea have now drawn on the hours of material Clouzot shot (including the amazing test footage) and have interviewed everyone connected with the film who's still alive, and they've produced a fascinating picture. Thirty years later Claude Chabrol filmed Clouzot's script under its original title and using expressive decor to convey the protagonist's inner life. It was nothing to write to Cahiers du cinéma about."
