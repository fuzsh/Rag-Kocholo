        "text": "A new 35 mm print of Henri-Georges Clouzot’s The Wages of Fear (Le salaire de la peur, France/Italy 1953)-a riveting study of desperation, existential despair, fraternal bonding and corporate greed all wrapped up in a gritty action movie-opens an exclusive San Francisco engagement June 8 at San Francisco Film Society Cinema (1746 Post Street).\n\nIn a squalid South American oil town, four desperate men sign on for a suicide mission to drive trucks loaded with nitroglycerin over a treacherous mountain route. As they ferry their explosive cargo to a faraway oil fire, each bump and jolt tests their courage, their friendship and their nerves. The result is one of the greatest thrillers ever committed to celluloid, a white-knuckle ride from France’s legendary master of suspense and the winner of the 1953 Cannes Palme d’Or. This new print was created from a complete HD digital restoration completed by the Criterion Collection. Written by Henri-Georges Clouzot, Jérôme Géronimi. Photographed by Armand Thirard With Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck. In French with subtitles. 147 min.
