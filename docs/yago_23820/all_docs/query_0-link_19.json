And it’s not about speed – in fact, just the opposite. Four desperate men stuck in a desolate town in Central America, agree to earn $2,000 each to carefully drive two trucks filled with nitroglycerine over 300 miles of rocky, decrepit mountain roads to help extinguish a raging oil well fire.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot's masterpiece is one of the great, existential movie thrillers – both darkly funny and utterly nerve-wracking. Clouzot (Diabolique) has staged sequences that are as agonizingly suspenseful as anything in movie history. That's no accident, since endurance, fate, and the human condition are what The Wages of Fear is about.\n\nThe restored original cut of this visionary work is thrilling in ways we always hope suspense films will be; we are reminded, almost perversely, to be careful what we wish for. Grand Prize, Cannes Film Festival. In French with English subtitles.\n\n\"The film is about their responses to the grueling test of driving the trucks. You sit there waiting for the theatre to explode.\" -Pauline Kael, The New Yorker\n\n1953 | Directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot | 147 min.\n\nWe’re celebrating this weekend’s Concours with what is likely the greatest film about driving ever made.
