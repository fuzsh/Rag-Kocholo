        "text": "Seldom have the exquisite pain and pleasure of motion-picture suspense been mixed with quite the intoxicating effects that Henri-Georges Clouzot achieves in his 1953 classic, \"The Wages of Fear\" (\"Le Salaire de la Peur\").\n\nThe film, being released in this country for the first time in its entirety, opens today at Film Forum 2, where it may well run forever.\n\nNo other show in town can match \"The Wages of Fear\" for the purely gut sensations it prompts, the kind that make you laugh out loud as the heart threatens to go on permanent hold. Yet \"The Wages of Fear\" is a lot more than a spectacular roller-coaster ride. It's about courage as well as fear, about the impulse to persevere in the face of apparent futility.\n\n\"The Wages of Fear\" is also a 1950's time capsule, the contents of which reflect French attitudes toward everything from Sartre's existentialism to America's post-World War II hegemony. No wonder that William Friedkin's 1977 remake, titled \"Sorcerer,\" seemed so wan: it didn't have an attitude. The Clouzot original is not only one of the most breathtaking thrillers ever made but also a film that is grounded in attitude.\n\nFor its initial American release in 1955, the film's distributors toned down (and sometimes pared away entirely) everything they thought might offend American audiences in the Eisenhower era. The running time was thus collapsed to 105 minutes from 148, which is the version on the Film Forum screen.\n\nThe excised Clouzot attitude now looks pretty tame but, in the early 50's there were many who might have taken \"The Wages of Fear\" to be inflammatory.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
