The French thriller film The Wages of Fear, first released in 1953 under the title Le Salaire de la peur, was directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. It was based on a 1950 novel by Georges Arnaud.

A fire is raging in a South American oil well that is owned by an American company, and the only way to stop it is to use nitroglycerin. Transporting the volatile substance to the well is considered too dangerous for the company’s union workers, so four desperate locals (all of them transplanted Europeans) are lured by the promise of $2,000 per man to make the near-suicidal delivery across the hazardous South American terrain. The first part of the movie builds slowly as the four main characters are introduced, led by Yves Montand as Mario, a playboy. The characters’ dead-end lives are sketched clearly, showing why even a perilous mission is deemed a golden opportunity. Once their ominous journey begins, however, the suspense is unrelenting, as each bump in the road and jostle of the trucks tests the characters’ mettle, friendship, and nerves. Mario is the only survivor of the ordeal, receiving his pay and a hero’s welcome. However, he recklessly plunges to his death from a mountain road in the very truck in which he had so carefully delivered the deadly cargo.
