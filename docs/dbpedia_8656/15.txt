Requirements for enrollment - CSUs

High School GPA

California residents and graduates of California high schools will be eligible for admission by earning a 2.50 or greater “a-g" GPA.

Any California high school graduate or resident of California earning a GPA between 2.00 and 2.49 may be evaluated for admission based upon supplemental factors such as number of courses exceeding minimum “A-G" requirements, household income, extracurricular involvement, and other available information that would inform the campus admission decision. Each CSU campus will determine the supplemental factors used with GPA to determine eligibility in these cases and communicate these criteria publicly for prospective students.

Non-California residents may be eligible for admission to the CSU by earning a 3.00 or greater “a-g" GPA along with other supplemental factors utilized by the individual campus, including those outlined by impacted campuses and programs.​
