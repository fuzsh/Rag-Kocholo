        "text": "Earlier this year, when Degreechoices released its new rankings of the economic value of American colleges and universities, there were several noteworthy surprises at the top of the charts.\n\nMost observers of college ranking schemes are accustomed to seeing elite private colleges and public flagship universities dominate, but with our revised methodology, which measures the economic return students can expect to receive from attending different institutions, public colleges and universities fared much better.\n\nSure, many of the big-name universities still performed very well. Princeton, Stanford, Harvard and Yale all made the top ten. But several public universities – such as CUNY City College, the University of Florida, and Florida International University – also ranked high on the list of best national universities. Those are all excellent schools, but they seldom rank in the top tier of ranking schemes that place a premium on institutional reputation and wealth.\n\nWe want to draw special attention to high-achieving schools, so we are starting a spotlight series that focuses on the unique qualities and achievements of several of “overperformers.”\n\nWe want to draw special attention to these high-achieving schools, so we are starting a spotlight series that focuses on the unique qualities and achievements of several of these “overperformers.” We begin with 5 campuses in the California State University system, each of which performed very well in either the national university category or the best colleges in the West category.\n\nA reminder about how our ranking methodology works\n\nUsing public cost and earnings data from the Department of Education’s College Scorecard and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), we calculate 2 metrics that are then mathematically combined into an institution’s total economic score. Our ranking are based on this final score (the lower, the better).\n\nPayback measures how long it takes on average for students to recoup their total cost of attending college (after financial aid) with their marginal earnings. Marginal earnings are the difference between what the average student would have earned without attending college and what he or she earns afterwards. Payback is similar to Third Way’s Price-to-Earnings Premium, whose educational director Michael Itzkowitz consulted on our methodology.\n\nEarningsPlus compares student earnings after college against a benchmark that is adjusted based on 2 variables that influence salary comparisons:\n\nEach school’s unique mix of academic programs (e.g., does it offer degrees in disciplines such as engineering, nursing, computer science, and education).\n\nThe percentage of in-state and out-of-state students in its overall enrollment\n\nWhether payback or EarningsPlus is more important will vary depending on individual circumstances. Payback reveals how soon educational costs can be recovered on average, while EarningsPlus conveys relative economic advantages later down the road.\n\nLearn more in our methodology statement.\n\nAs illustrations of that fact, consider 2 institutions in the California State University system – California State University, Fresno (also known as Fresno State University) and California State University, Fullerton, which ranked 24th and 25th, respectively on the list of national universities.\n\nFresno State University\n\nFresno State has a total enrollment of about 24,000 students, more than half of whom are Hispanic.\n\nThe university accepts 97% of its applicants.\n\nOver half (57%) of its undergraduates receive Pell Grants.\n\nIt has an excellent 6-year graduation rate of 71%, far higher than the national average for public 4-year institutions.\n\nEconomic score: 1.23\n\nFor Fresno State students, it takes just a bit over a year for the average student receiving federal financial aid to pay back the total cost of an education there. And 10 years after attending, those students, regardless of whether they graduated or not, are earning an average of $52,201 a year. These numbers are consistent with the university’s reputation as an institution that offers its students, many of whom are the first in their families to attend college, excellent prospects for upward economic mobility.\n\nCalifornia State University, Fullerton\n\nCalifornia State University, Fullerton is the largest of the 23 campuses in the Cal State system, with an enrollment topping 39,000 students.\n\nIt accept 59% of applicants.\n\nIts 6-year graduation rate is an outstanding 79%.\n\nThe university ranks second in the nation and first in California among colleges and universities for the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded to minority students.\n\nAmong its undergraduates, 49% receive a Pell Grant, which is much higher than the national average of about 34%.\n\nEconomic score: 1.29\n\nAt Cal State, Fullerton, students earn $54,586 on average 10 years after attending, and it takes those receiving federal aid about 1.3 years, on average, to pay back their total cost of attendance.\n\nWhy do these schools rank so well?\n\nWhat accounts for these 2 institutions’ strong national rankings?\n\nFirst, they both offer a large number of degrees in engineering and several health professions, two fields of study that tend to lead to good-paying jobs.\n\nSecond, through a combination of relatively low tuition sticker price and generous financial aid received by a large percentage of their students, both schools are very affordable.\n\nAnd third, they provide students with a strong set of academic and social support, helping drive those good graduation rates.\n\nOther high-ranking Cal State colleges\n\nThree other campuses in the California State University system ranked in the top 10 for Degreechoices’ best colleges in the West region. They were:\n\nCalifornia State University, Los Angeles\n\nIs ranked second in the region with an economic score of .66, behind only Stanford University. With an enrollment of about 26,000 students, Cal State, Los Angeles accepts 91% of its applicants and graduates 69% of its undergraduates in 6 years. It takes less than a year for its students to pay back their average annual educational costs ($3,302), and on average their students are making an annual salary of $51,997 10 years after attending.\n\nCalifornia State University, Dominguez Hills\n\nRanks fourth in the West region with an economic score of .89. Its total enrollment exceeds 15,000 students. Cal State, Dominguez Hills accepts 90% of applicants and its 6-year graduation rate is 66%. More than half of its undergraduates receive Pell Grants, and 86% of its students are students of color. Its annual cost of education after subtracting financial aid averages $4,026, which students are able to pay back in less than a year on average. Annual income 10 years after attendance is $47,340.\n\nCalifornia State University, Stanislaus\n\nRanks eighth in the West region, with an economic score of 1.12. On average, it takes its students a little more than a year to recoup the annual costs ($6,566) of their education. Ten years later, they are earning an average of $53,963 a year. “Stan State” enrolls more than 9,000 students, two-thirds of whom are racial minorities and more than half of whom receive a federal Pell Grant.\n\nCalifornia State University is the largest public university system in the United States, with an enrollment exceeding 475,000 students. It is also the most ethnically and socially diverse of any public university system. More than half of its students are racial minorities, and about a third are the first in their families to attend college.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nFor our purposes, these universities deserve a ranking spotlight because of their impressive achievements in 2 fundamental areas: making college affordable and preparing student to be economically successful. Cal State proves that institutions can provide broad access and promote widespread student success at the same time.\n\nCal State proves that institutions can provide broad access and promote widespread student success at the same time.\n\nIts campuses are not highly selective, they are not particularly wealthy, and their endowments are relatively meager compared to most universities. But when it comes to the bottom line that the majority of today’s college students care about most – will this college prepare me for a productive career – the campuses of California State University are moving to the head of the class."
