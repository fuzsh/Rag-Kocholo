In addition to the exceptional University of California (UC) schools (see UC rankings here), there are an additional 23 universities housed within the California State University system. Our list of the Best CSU Schools Ranked will also share data such as undergraduate enrollment, number of freshman applicants, acceptance rate, average GPA of accepted applicants, transfer acceptance rate, and graduation rate. In creating these Cal State rankings of all 23 undergraduate degree-granting schools, we want to make crystal clear that all 23 have something positive to offer academically AND come at a bargain price. In fact, two years after graduating, CSU grads from all campuses and majors enjoy an average salary of $52k; ten years later, the mean figure rises to $82,000.\n\nOur rankings are based on selectivity, the number of standout academic programs, career services offerings, and postgraduate outcomes. Again, we encourage our readers not to make too much of the numerical ranking of the schools. These rankings can be a useful tool when trying to take in the admissions landscape, but this doesn’t mean you should automatically pick the 9th-best school over the 13th-best. Rather, we recommend using these rankings only as a starting point as you investigate the CSU campus that will best suit your unique academic and career goals.\n\nTo provide a quick reference, our Best CSU Schools Ranked are as follows:\n\n1) Cal Poly SLO\n\n2) SDSU\n\n3) Long Beach\n\n4) Cal Poly Pomona\n\n5) San Jose State\n\n6) Fullerton\n\n7) Fresno\n\n8) Chico\n\n9) Northridge\n\n10) Los Angeles\n\n11) Maritime\n\n12) Monterey Bay\n\n13) Sonoma State\n\n14) San Bernardino\n\n15) San Francisco State\n\n16) Bakersfield\n\n17) Sacramento State\n\n18) East Bay\n\n19) San Marcos\n\n20) Channel Islands\n\n21) Stanislaus\n\n22) Cal Poly Humboldt\n\n23) Dominguez Hills\n\nNow, let’s transition into a meatier version that features academic outcomes and admissions data.\n\nThe Best CSU Schools Ranked – 2024\n\n*Acceptance rates on our list of the Best CSU Schools Ranked are from the Class of 2027, unless otherwise noted.\n\n1) Cal Poly SLO\n\nResting atop our Cal State rankings, Cal Poly SLO’s School of Engineering is the university’s crown jewel.
