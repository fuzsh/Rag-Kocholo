All of California’s public colleges and universities and some private institutions offer targeted support for foster youth scholars.\n\nLAist offers a website that provides a roadmap to college for California students, offering guidance on how to determine what school to attend, how to decide what to study, how to apply and more.\n\nCommunity colleges offer students a range of short-term certificate programs, two-year associate degrees, the opportunity to transfer to a four-year university and in some cases four-year bachelors degrees. There are 116 campuses across the state. Community colleges don’t require that students have a certain GPA and there are no tests to take or essays to write in order to be admitted. Visit the CCC website for details. Visit our CTE page to learn about Career and Technical Education options at community colleges.\n\nThere are thousands of private colleges and universities across the country offering 4-year bachelor’s degree programs and more. While these programs typically cost more than a public university, many offer generous financial aid, making them an affordable option in some cases. The College Board offers a search tool to find options that may be right for you.\n\nPrivate vocational schools offer CTE programs typically at a much higher cost than community colleges. These programs can leave you in serious debt at the end of the program. Make sure that you fully understand the costs of these programs and discuss the pros and cons with an advisor, mentor or other adult who you trust before choosing a private for-profit program."
