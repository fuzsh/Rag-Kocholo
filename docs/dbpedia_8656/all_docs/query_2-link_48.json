        "text": "Cal State Monterey Bay provides over 7,500 students an extraordinary opportunity to learn on a residential campus just one mile from the shores of the beautiful Monterey Bay. Our diverse student body receives personal attention in small classes while pursuing degrees in 25 undergraduate and nine graduate majors.\n\nFounded in 1994 on the former site of Fort Ord by educators and community leaders, CSU Monterey Bay faculty and staff build on that legacy as we explore innovative ways to meet the needs of a new generation of students while simultaneously powering the Monterey County economy.\n\nWhile we serve students from the entire state of California, 38 percent of our undergraduates come from Monterey, San Benito and Santa Cruz counties. We pride ourselves on making higher education accessible to traditionally underserved and low-income populations. Seventy-two percent of our students receive some form of financial aid. Fifty-three percent of our students are among the first generation of their family to go to college. And with 52 percent of our students living on campus, we are one of the most residential universities in the CSU.\n\nMonterey Bay, CA: A thriving coastal community\n\nLocated along the central coast of California, Monterey Bay is a vibrant and dynamic community that offers a unique blend of natural beauty and cultural attractions.\n\nWith its stunning coastline, rolling hills, and lush forests, this area provides students with a peaceful and relaxing environment that is perfect for study and recreation.\n\nWhether you're looking for a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of city life or a dynamic and vibrant community in which to pursue your education and career, Monterey Bay has it all."
