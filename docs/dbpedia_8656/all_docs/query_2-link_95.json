        "text": "The United States has a wide variety of institutions that provide higher education. There are so many options that it can be very overwhelming for international students to understand the different choices. One of the more common questions asked by international students is what is the difference between a public and private university?\n\nWhat’s the Difference?\n\nThe most obvious difference is the price. Public universities are less expensive than private universities. Private universities can cost well over $100,000 for a four-year degree. While public universities might be less expensive. Private universities tend to be more geographically diverse as the tuition is the same price for students regardless of whether they live in the state that the university is in. Alternately, public universities are more demographically diverse due to the lower cost of tuition.\n\nPublic University\n\nA public university, also commonly called a state university, is funded by the public through the government of that state. For example, UCLA is a public university and is funded by the state of California. Every state in the USA has a public university or college.\n\nUniversity of West Georgia\n\nUniversity of Florida ELI\n\nUniversity of North Alabama\n\nLos Angeles City College\n\nSouth Dakota State University\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Pembroke\n\nMission College\n\nLos Angeles Pierce College (CA)\n\nSanta Monica College\n\nUniversity of California, Irvine\n\nOlympic College\n\nCalifornia State University at Dominguez Hills\n\nPrivate University\n\nA private university is not funded or operated by the government. For example, Loyola Marymount University is not funded by the state of California but is partially funded by endowments that are given by private donors. Every state in the USA has private universities or colleges.\n\nUniversity of San Diego\n\nGeorgetown University School of Continuing Studies\n\nManhattan College\n\nBerkeley College\n\nNorthwest School\n\nAmerican University – International Accelerator\n\nBaylor University\n\nUniversity of Tampa\n\nLipscomb University\n\nWestern New England University\n\nIn case you missed it, rewatch our informative live session to Understand the U.S. Education System.\n\nHow to Choose Between a Public vs Private University\n\nSo, how do you decide? Ask yourself what is important to you when considering a college or university:\n\nSize—if you like the idea of a big campus with many people, a public university may be a great choice. If you thrive in smaller environments, you might consider a private university or college.\n\nCost—no matter where you live, public universities are likely going to cost less. However, if cost is not a major concern, considering private universities allows you to look at a wider variety of schools.\n\nMajor—if you have a specific major, degree, or program in mind, make sure the private universities on your list offer it before applying. If they do not, consider that public universities will have more options and a greater number of faculty, as well as graduate programs.\n\nCheck out our other articles below:\n\nScholarships for Every Type of Student Who Wants to Study in the USA\n\nHow to Get Your U.S. Student Visa\n\nWhat is a GPA?\n\nIs an MBA Right for You?\n\nThere are many highly reputable private and public universities in America. Although, according to U.S. News Best Colleges rankings, the first 19 institutions are private universities. That is not to say there aren’t prestigious public universities in the USA. There are many highly ranked public universities; lower tuition does not equate to lower quality education"
