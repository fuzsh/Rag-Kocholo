In high-demand majors and campuses a GPA of 2.00 may not be sufficient to be admitted;\n\nbe in good standing at the last college or university attended. In simple terms, “good standing” means you are eligible to re-enroll at your last college or university;\n\nhave completed 10 general education courses (30 semester units or 45 quarter units) of basic skills courses, with a grade of C- or better, and, specifically, four courses completed in the following areas (in either column) which are known as the Golden Four:\n\nGeneral Education-Breadth\n\nIntersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum* (IGETC)\n\nArea A - English Language Communication and Critical Thinking\n\nArea 1 - English Communication\n\nA1 - Oral Communication\n\n1A - Written Communications\n\nA2 - Written Communications\n\n1B - Critical Thinking\n\nA3 - Critical Thinking\n\n1C - Oral Communications\n\nArea B - Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Reasoning\n\nArea 2 - Mathematical Concept and Quantitative Reasoning\n\nB4 - Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning\n\nHigh-Unit Majors with Authorized Exceptions to Admission and GE Breadth Requirements.\n\nSome CSU campuses and/or majors may have additional requirements for admission.
