Composed of 23 campuses spread across the state and home to almost a half-million students, it’s hard to understate the impact of this enormous institution. For example, one of every 20 Americans with a college degree is a CSU graduate and for every dollar that California invests in the CSU, it generates $5.43 for California’s economy.\n\nIf you’re interested in attending one of the schools in the California State University System, you’ll likely find this ranked list of the best Cal state schools helpful.\n\nCollegeVine’s Ranking Methodology\n\nOur list of the 10 best California State University Schools was constructed with a focus on school quality, outcomes, and return on investment (ROI).

Although the UC schools are generally more selective and have higher academic standards to meet, you’ll still need an impressive profile to catch the eye of one of the schools in the California State University System."
