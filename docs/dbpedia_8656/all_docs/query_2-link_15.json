The environment has none of that hectic vibe you might experience elsewhere. That's the beauty of CSULB, that you still have cool, challenging, rigorous classes and programs, but none of the stressful drama!\n\nJacky from Lancaster, CA\n\nThis school requires a good amount of studying and focus, plus you'll be walking quite a bit from class to class. It has a laid back atmosphere, and the teachers are helpful. It's a very good value for the price.\n\nPaul from Long Beach, CA\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nPomona, CA\n\nFullerton, CA\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nNorthridge, CA\n\nDavis, CA\n\nIrvine, CA\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nRiverside, CA\n\nLa Jolla, CA\n\nSanta Barbara, CA\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nSee All"
