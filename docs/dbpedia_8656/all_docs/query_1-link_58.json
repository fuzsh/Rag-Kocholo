        "text": "Higher Education\n\nHundreds arrested and suspended: How California colleges are disciplining faculty and students over protests\n\nStudents and faculty protesting the Israel-Hamas war at universities throughout California are facing a range of consequences from arrests to suspensions and bans from campus. Meanwhile, students and faculty have also had to endure campus closures, canceled events, and classes moving online. What are the academic and legal costs of civil disobedience for California’s college protesters?\n\nHigher Education\n\nCollege campuses can’t hire undocumented students. How that might change in California\n\nTwo state bills would allow public colleges and universities to hire undocumented students, which is currently barred by federal law. The proposals are based on a legal theory that the law doesn’t apply to state agencies.\n\nCollege Beat\n\nCalifornia colleges have to slash emissions. Here’s why decarbonization is complex and costly.\n\nCalifornia’s three public university systems are either setting or reworking their climate plans to fall in line with the state’s goal for carbon neutrality by 2045, all while striving to expand in size and scope. New plans do away with a large reliance on carbon offsets, making an already difficult and costly process of reducing emissions even harder.\n\nEducation\n\nCalifornia universities struggle to graduate Black students. Cultural centers aim to help\n\nWhile graduation rates for Black students are the lowest in California universities, cultural centers can help address equity issues. Centers for Black students create a safe space to foster community while connecting with academic resources and Black faculty."
