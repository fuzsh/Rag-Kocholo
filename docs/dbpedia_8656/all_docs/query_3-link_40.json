I am grateful for the helpful faculty who have helped me achieve my academic goals. The faculty at Cal State LA is a reason why I will always recommend family and friends to attend the university.\n\nNicole\n\nCSULA has excellent professors that care about their students' education. The material they teach focus on timely topics that are relevant to the real world and the professors are very responsive to inquiries via technological platforms. Though the CSULA administration system needs improvement, their teaching staff makes my overall experience in CSULA's MBA program well worth my time and money.\n\nNina from El Monte, CA\n\nsuch an amazing school and campus. the professors i have had so far are very nice, friendly and very helpful. the campus is really big and there are many places to study, there is always a quiet place to study.\n\nJazmin from Huntington Park, CA\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nPomona, CA\n\nCarson, CA\n\nFullerton, CA\n\nLong Beach, CA\n\nNorthridge, CA\n\nBerkeley, CA\n\nIrvine, CA\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nRiverside, CA\n\nSanta Barbara, CA\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nSee All"
