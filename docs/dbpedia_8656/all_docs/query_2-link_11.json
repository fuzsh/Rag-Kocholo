        "text": "Average Support Cost per Full-time Equivalent Student Sources of Funds\n\nThe total support cost per full-time equivalent student (FTES) includes the expenditures for current operations, including payments made to students in the form of financial aid, and all fully reimbursed programs contained in state appropriations. The average support cost is determined by dividing the total cost by the number of FTES. The total CSU 2023-24 budget amounts were $4,988,674,000 from state General Fund (GF) appropriations, $2,459,737,00, from gross tuition revenue, and $707,090,000 from other fee revenues for a total of $8,155,501,000. The 2023-24 resident FTES target is 387,114 and the nonresident FTES based on past-year actual is 20,907 for a total of 408,021 FTES. The GF appropriation is applicable to resident students only whereas fee revenues are collected from resident and nonresident students. FTES is derived by dividing the total student credit units attempted by a fixed amount depending on academic level (e.g., 30 for a semester university and 45 for a quarter university, the figures that define a full-time undergraduate or postbaccalaureate student's academic load).\n\n2022/23\n\nCost Per FTES Amount Average Cost Per FTES % State Appropriation (GF)* $4,988,674,000 $12,887 61.2% Gross Tuition Revenue** $2,459,737,000 $6,028 30.1% Other Fees Revenue** $707,090,000 $1,733 8.7% Total Support Costs $8,155,501,000 $20,648 100%\n\nThe 2023-24 average support cost per FTES based on GF appropriation and tuition fee revenue only is $18,915 and is $20,648, which includes all fee revenue (e.g., tuition fees, application fees, and campus mandatory fees) in the CSU Operating Fund. Of this amount, the average tuition and other fee revenue per FTES is $7,761.\n\nThe average CSU 2023-24 academic year, resident, undergraduate student basic tuition and other mandatory fees required to apply to, enroll in, or attend the university is $7,662 ($5,742 tuition fee plus $1,880 average campus-based fees). However, the costs paid by individual students will vary depending on the university, program, and whether a student is part-time, full-time, resident, or nonresident.\n\nCampus Smoking Policy\n\nPlease view the revised smoking policy for the Cal Poly campus at the Campus Administrative Policies website.\n\nCareer Placement\n\nThe Career Services office 805.756.2501 may furnish, upon request, information about the employment of students who graduate from programs or courses of study preparing students for a particular career field. Data provided must be in a form that does not allow for the identification of any individual student. This information includes data concerning the average starting salary and the percentage of previously enrolled students who obtained employment. The information may include data collected from graduates of the university or graduates of all universities in the California State University system.\n\nCivil and Criminal Penalties for Violation of Federal Copyrights Law\n\nAnyone who is found to be liable for copyright infringement may be liable for either the owner's actual damages along with any profits of the infringer or statutory damages of up to $30,000 per work infringed. In the case of a willful infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. (See 17 U.S.C. §504.) Courts also have discretion to award costs and attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party. (See 17 U.S.C. §505.) Under certain circumstances, willful copyright infringement may also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment and fines. (See 17 U.S.C. §506 and 18 U.S.C. §2319.)\n\nDetermination of Residency for Tuition Purposes\n\nUniversity requirements for establishing residency for tuition purposes are independent from requirements for establishing residency for other purposes, such as for tax purposes, or other state or institutional residency. These regulations were promulgated not to determine whether a student is a resident or nonresident of California, but rather to determine whether a student qualifies to pay university fees at the in-state or out-of-state rate. A resident for tuition purposes is someone who meets the requirements set forth in the Uniform Student Residency Requirements. These laws governing residency for tuition purposes at the California State University are California Education Code sections 68000-68086, 68120- 68133, and 89705-89707.5, and California Code of Regulations, Title 5, Subchapter 5, Article 4, sections 41900- 41915. This material can be viewed by accessing the California State University website.\n\nEach CSUs Admissions Office is responsible for determining the residency status of that university's new and returning students based, as applicable, on the student's Application for Admission, Residency Questionnaire, and, as necessary, other information the student furnishes. A student who fails to provide sufficient information to establish resident status will be classified as a nonresident.\n\nResidency Requirements\n\nInitial Determination: Eligible Immigration Status, Physical Presence and Intent\n\nA student seeking to pay in-state tuition at a California State University (CSU) as a first-time freshman, transfer, or as a post-baccalaureate/graduate student must have an eligible immigration status to establish residency (see Eligible Immigration Information), meet physical presence by the Residence Determination Date, and demonstrate intent to indefinitely remain in the State of California for more than one year immediately preceding the Residence Determination Date. If the student is under the age of 19 (with limited exceptions), the student's residence status is derived from that of the parent or from that of the legal guardian.\n\nRequirements for Residency for Tuition Purposes\n\nPhysical Presence: The student or parent/guardian must be physically present in California for more than one year immediately preceding the Residence Determination Date in which enrollment is contemplated. For example, if a student plans to attend the CSU for the Fall 2024 academic term, and the Residence Determination Date for that term is September 20, 2024, the student must establish physical presence in California no later than September 19, 2023.\n\nEligible Immigration Status\n\nA student seeking to pay in-state tuition at a California State University campus as a first-time freshman, transfer, or post-baccalaureate/graduate student must have an eligible immigration status to establish residency. Therefore, the student must be a United States citizen, a permanent resident (Green Card holder), or hold an eligible visa status (all eligible visas can be found at www.calstate.edu/residency).\n\nStudents in the category of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Humanitarian Parole, or Temporary Protected Status (TPS) are also eligible to establish residency for tuition purposes. Also, students who are adjusting their immigration status, such as asylum, may qualify for residency depending on where they are in the application process.\n\nMost nonimmigrant visa holders, such as an F-1 or J-1 visa holder, are not eligible to establish California residency for tuition purposes. Students with a visa or without an immigration status should contact the university Admissions Office.\n\nIf a student does not qualify as a California resident, the student may be eligible for certain exceptions and exemptions, such as California Nonresident Tuition Exemption, commonly known as AB 540. Nonresident students (including US citizens, permanent residents, and undocumented individuals, including students with a T visa U visa, DACA, Humanitarian Parole (certain countries), Special Immigrant Juvenile, asylum, refugee, or Temporary Protected Status) may be exempted from paying nonresident tuition. Students seeking the AB 540 Exemption must satisfy attendance and graduation/transfer requirements from a California school (e.g., K-12, adult school, and community college).\n\nPhysical Presence: The student or parent/guardian must be physically present in California for more than one year immediately preceding the Residence Determination Date in which enrollment is contemplated. For example, if a student plans to attend the CSU for the Fall 2024 academic term, and the Residence Determination Date for that term is September 20, 2024, the student must establish physical presence in California no later than September 19, 2023.\n\nResidency Determination Dates\n\nIntent: California law stipulates the burden of proof rests with the student, and merely living in California for a year does not support a claim for residency for tuition purposes. The student, or in some cases a parent or legal guardian, must demonstrate intent to remain indefinitely in the state for more than one year immediately preceding the Residence Determination Date (RDD) and sever all residential ties with the former state or country of residence. If the student is under the age of 19, the student's residence status is derived from that of the parent or legal guardian unless an exception applies. There must be sufficient documentation to demonstrate that intent was established more than one year (a minimum of one year and one day) before the RDD.\n\nDocuments must include the student's name, the student's California address, and a date at least one year and one day prior or on the RDD for the term. For students under the age of 19, documents must be in the parent or legal guardian's name unless an exception applies. Also, a parent or legal guardian's immigration status does not preclude a student from establishing residency; therefore, the parent or legal guardian is not required to provide any immigration documents to demonstrate intent.\n\nEvidence demonstrating intent to remain in the State of California indefinitely may vary from case to case, but will include, and is not necessarily limited to, the absence of residential ties to any other state, California voter registration and history of actually voting in California elections, maintaining California vehicle registration and driver's license, maintaining active California bank accounts, filing California income tax returns and listing a California address on federal tax returns, owning residential property or occupying or renting a residence where permanent belongings are kept, maintaining active memberships in California professional or social organizations, and maintaining a permanent military address and home of record in California. For a complete list of acceptable supporting documents, please visit www.calstate.edu/residency under Intent.\n\nResidency Exceptions and Exemptions\n\nStudents not classified as California residents for tuition purposes may qualify for an exception or an exemption from payment of nonresident tuition. Exceptions to the general residency requirements are contained in California Education Code sections 68070-68086 and California Code of Regulations, Title 5, Subchapter 5, Article 4, sections 41906- 41906.6, 41910. Whether an exception applies to a particular student can only be determined after the submission of an application for admission and, as necessary, additional supporting documentation. Because neither the university nor the Chancellor's Office staff may give legal advice, applicants are strongly urged to review the material for themselves and consult with a legal advisor.\n\nResidency determination dates are set each term, They are:\n\nReclassification - Financial Independence (only applies to continuing students)\n\nA student classified as a nonresident for a prior term may seek reclassification in any subsequent term; however, reclassification requires that, in addition to satisfying the requirements of physical presence and intent to remain indefinitely in the state, the student must also satisfy the requirement of financial independence as outlined in Title 5 CCR § 41905.5. To do so, the student must contact the appropriate person in the university admissions office and complete a Residency Questionnaire Form and provide supporting documents.\n\n41905.5. Residence Reclassification - Financial Independence Requirement\n\nAny nonresident student requesting reclassification to resident for tuition purposes must demonstrate financial independence\n\nStudent has not and will not be claimed as an exemption for state and federal tax purposes by his/her parent in the calendar year the reclassification application is made and in any of the three calendar years prior to the reclassification application\n\nStudent has not and will not receive more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) per year in financial assistance from his/her parent in the calendar year the reclassification application is made and in any of the three calendar years prior to the reclassification application\n\nStudent has not lived and will not live for more than six weeks in the home of his/her parent during the calendar year the reclassification application is made and in any of the three calendar years prior to the reclassification application\n\nNote: Students who receive a government scholarship and/or financial assistance should be viewed the same as state and federal financial aid, and athletics grants-is-aid; and should not be counted as parental support.\n\nEffective Fall 2020 academic term, if the student meets at least one of the following criteria, the student does not have to meet the financial independence requirement. Student must provide the university admissions office supporting documents (e.g. state income tax returns, court documents, marriage certificate, military order form) that demonstrate they meet the criteria.\n\nDependent on a parent who has California residence for more than one year immediately preceding the residence determination date;\n\nEnrolled in a graduate or postbaccalaureate program, regardless of age;\n\nTurned 24 years of age by the residence determination date;\n\nMarried or registered domestic partner as of the residence determination date;\n\nActive duty members serving in the U.S Armed Forces;\n\nVeteran of the U.S. Armed Forces;\n\nLegal dependent other than spouse or registered domestic partner;\n\nFormer ward of the court, foster youth or both parents are deceased;\n\nDeclared by a court to be an emancipated minor; or\n\nUnaccompanied youth who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.\n\nResidency Appeals\n\nA student classified as a nonresident may appeal a final university decision within 30 days of notification by the university. Appeals will be accepted only if at least one of the following criteria applies:\n\n1. The decision was based on:\n\na. A significant error of fact by the university;\n\nb. A significant procedural error by the university; or\n\nc. An incorrect application of the law which, if corrected would require that the student be reclassified as a California resident; and/or\n\nd. Significant new information, not previously known or available to the student, became available after the date of the university decision classifying the student as a nonresident and based on the new information, the classification as a nonresident is incorrect.\n\nInstructions to submit an appeal and additional information can be found on the California Residency for Tuition Purposes Website.\n\nAppeals via email, fax and U.S. mail will not be accepted. A student with a documented disability who is requesting an accommodation to submit an appeal through the California State University (CSU) website should contact Student Affairs and Enrollment Management at residencyappeals@calstate.edu.\n\nThe Office of the Chancellor will either decide the appeal or send the matter back to the university for further review.\n\nA student incorrectly classified as a resident or incorrectly granted an exception from nonresident tuition is subject to reclassification as a nonresident or withdrawal of the exception and subject to payment of nonresident tuition in arrears. If incorrect classification results from false or concealed facts, the student may also be subject to discipline pursuant to Section 41301 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations. A student previously classified as a resident or previously granted an exception is required to immediately notify the Admissions Office if the student has reason to believe that the student no longer qualifies as a resident or no longer meets the criteria for an exception.\n\nChanges may have been made in the rate of nonresident tuition and in the statutes and regulations governing residency for tuition purposes in California between the time this information is published and the relevant residency determination date. Students are urged to review the statutes and regulations stated above.\n\nBack to top\n\nHigher Education Act (HEA)\n\nUnder the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) and its many amendments, Cal Poly is required to make certain disclosures and institutional information “readily available” to prospective and enrolled students, employees, the general public and the department of education on an annual basis (20 U.S.C. Section 1092(a)). For additional information, please contact the Dean of Students Office at 805.756.0327.\n\nPRIVACY RIGHTS OF STUDENTS IN EDUCATION RECORDS\n\nThe federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. 1232g) (FERPA) and regulations adopted thereunder (34 C.F.R. 99) set out requirements designed to protect students’ privacy in their educational records maintained by the university. The statute and regulations govern access to certain student records maintained by the university and the release of those records. FERPA provides that the university must give a student access to most records directly related to the student, and must also provide opportunity to correct the records if the student believes the records are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise inappropriate. The right to petition to correct a record under FERPA does not include any right to challenge the appropriateness of a grade determined by the instructor. In addition, FERPA generally requires the university obtain a student’s written consent before releasing personally identifiable data pertaining to the student. The university has adopted a set of policies and procedures governing implementation of FERPA and the regulations. Copies of these policies and procedures may be obtained at Office of Academic Records or the Educational Equity Services Office. Among the information included in the university statement of policies and procedures is:\n\nThe student records maintained and the information they contain;\n\nThe university official responsible for maintaining each record;\n\nThe location of access lists indicating persons requesting or receiving information from the record;\n\nPolicies for reviewing and expunging records;\n\nStudent access rights to their records;\n\nProcedure for challenging the content of student records; and\n\nThe student’s right to file a complaint with the Department of Education. The Department of Education has established an office and review board to investigate complaints and adjudicate violations. The designated office is: Student Privacy Policy Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. 20202-5920.\n\nFERPA authorizes the university to release “directory information” pertaining to students. “Directory information” may include the student’s name, address, telephone listing, electronic mail address, photograph, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, grade level, enrollment status, degrees, honors, and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution the student attended. The university may release this “directory information” unless the university has received prior written objection from the student specifying the information the student requests not be released. Written objections must be sent to University Registrar.\n\nFERPA authorizes the university is authorized to provide access to student records without prior student consent to university officials, employees, and others who have legitimate educational interests in such access. These persons include those with legitimate reasons to access student records to perform the university's academic, administrative or service functions, and those with a reason for accessing student records associated with their university or other related academic responsibilities. Student records will be disclosed to the CSU Chancellor’s Office to conduct research, to analyze trends, or to provide other administrative services. Student records may also be disclosed to other persons or organizations under certain conditions (e.g., as part of the accreditation or program evaluation; in response to a court order or subpoena; in connection with financial aid; or to other institutions to which the student is transferring).\n\nCompletion/Graduation Rates\n\nInformation concerning completion, graduation rates and student body diversity at Cal Poly may be found at the Institutional Research website.\n\nEquity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA)\n\nhttp://ir.calpoly.edu/content/publications_reports/ret_grad/index\n\nThe Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act requires co-educational institutions of postsecondary education that participate in a Title IV, federal student financial assistance program, and have an intercollegiate athletic program, to prepare an annual report to the Department of Education on athletic participation, staffing, and revenues and expenses, by men’s and women’s teams.\n\nIn compliance with this requirement, information contained in the current report for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is available on the US Department of Education’s web site at http://ope.ed.gov/athletics (select “Get data for one institution”). Alternatively, a link is also available to this and other publications through Cal Poly’s Institutional Planning & Analysis web site (see link at top of this section). A paper copy of the report is available upon request.\n\nCampus Security Report (Clery Act)\n\nhttp://afd.calpoly.edu/police/\n\nCrime statistics for Cal Poly are provided for all prospective and current students, faculty and staff on the website, along with critical updates and prevention advisories. These statistics are reported monthly to the Federal and State Departments of Justice as well as annually to the Office of the Chancellor of the CSU. Crime statistics are published to inform the campus community and to meet mandated reporting requirements. A printed copy of the Campus Security Report is available by request at the University Police Department.\n\nStudent Activities\n\nInformation concerning student activities may be found at the Cal Poly Student Affairs website http://www.studentaffairs.calpoly.edu/get-involved; 805.756.5903.\n\nAvailability of Institutional and Financial Assistance Information\n\nStudent Financial Assistance.

Licensure and credentialing requirements are set by agencies that are not controlled by or affiliated with the CSU and requirements can change at any time. For example, licensure or credentialing requirements can include evidence of the right to work in the United States (e.g., social security number or tax payer identification number) or successfully passing a criminal background check. Students are responsible for determining whether they can meet licensure or credentialing requirements. The CSU will not refund tuition, fees, or any associated costs, to students who determine subsequent to admission that they cannot meet licensure or credentialing requirements. Information concerning licensure and credentialing requirements are available from the Office of the Registrar, Admin. 222; 805.756.2531.\n\nThe California State University has not determined whether its programs meet other states’ educational or professional requirements for licensure and certification. Students enrolled in a California State University program who are planning to pursue licensure or certification in other states are responsible for determining whether they will meet their state’s requirements for licensure or certification. This disclosure is made pursuant to 34 CFR §668.43(a)(5)(v)(C).\n\nMilitary Selective Service Act\n\nThe federal Military Selective Service Act (the \"Act\") requires most males residing in the United States to present themselves for registration with the Selective Service System within thirty days of their eighteenth birthday. Most males between the ages of 18 and 25 must be registered.\n\nSelective Service registration forms are available at any U.S. Post Office, and many high schools have a staff member or teacher appointed as a Selective Service Registrar. For more information on the Selective Service System and to initiate the registration process, visit the official Selective Service System website.\n\nStudent Complaint Procedure (Complaints Regarding the CSU)\n\nThe California State University (CSU) takes very seriously complaints and concerns regarding the institution. If you have a complaint regarding the CSU, you may present your complaint as follows:\n\nIf your complaint concerns CSU’s compliance with academic program quality and accrediting standards, you may present your complaint on the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) website. WASC is the agency that accredits the CSU's academic program.\n\nIf your complaint concerns an alleged violation by CSU of any law that prohibits discrimination, harassment or retaliation based on a protected status (such as age, disability, gender (or sex), gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity (including color, caste, or ancestry), religion or veteran or military status), you may present your complaint as described in CSU Non-discrimination Policy.\n\nIf your complaint concerns an alleged violation by the CSU of other state law, including laws prohibiting fraud and false advertising, you may present your claim complaint to the university president or designee at (Jessica Darin, Chief of Staff, darin@calpoly.edu). See Procedure for Student Complaints—Executive Order No. 1063 for details regarding the complaint requirements and complaint process.\n\nOther complaints regarding the CSU may be presented to the university dean of students [or another appropriate administrator], who will provide guidance on the appropriate university process for addressing your particular issue.\n\nIf you believe that your complaint warrants further attention after you have exhausted all the steps outlined by the university, or by WASC, you may file an appeal with the Assistant Vice Chancellor, Academic and Student Affairs (or designee) at the CSU Chancellor's Office.\n\nThis procedure should not be construed to limit any right that you may have to take legal action to resolve your complaint.\n\nStudent Conduct\n\nInappropriate conduct by students or by applicants for admission is subject to discipline as provided in Sections 41301 through 41304 of Title 5, California Code of Regulations. These sections are:\n\nTitle 5, California Code of Regulations, § 41301. Standards for Student Conduct\n\nUniversity Community Values\n\nThe university is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy living and learning environment for students, faculty, and staff. Each member of the university community should choose behaviors that contribute toward this end. Students are expected to be good citizens and to engage in responsible behaviors that reflect well upon their university, to be civil to one another and to others in the university community, and contribute positively to student and university life.\n\nGrounds for Student Discipline\n\nStudent behavior that is not consistent with the Student Conduct Code is addressed through an educational process that is designed to promote safety and good citizenship and, when necessary, impose appropriate consequences. The following are the grounds upon which student discipline can be based:\n\nDishonesty, including:\n\nCheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic dishonesty that are intended to gain unfair academic advantage.\n\nFurnishing false information to a university official, faculty member, or university office.\n\nForgery, alteration, or misuse of a university document, key, or identification instrument.\n\nMisrepresenting one’s self to be an authorized agent of the university or one of its auxiliaries.\n\nUnauthorized entry into, presence in, use of, or misuse of university property.\n\nWillful, material and substantial disruption or obstruction of a university-related activity, or any on-campus activity.\n\nParticipating in an activity that substantially and materially disrupts the normal operations of the university, or infringes on the rights of members of the university community.\n\nWillful, material and substantial obstruction of the free flow of pedestrian or other traffic, on or leading to campus property or an off-campus university-related activity.\n\nDisorderly, lewd, indecent, or obscene behavior at a university-related activity, or directed toward a member of the university community.\n\nConduct that threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person within or related to the university community, including physical abuse, threats, intimidation, harassment, or sexual misconduct.\n\nHazing or conspiracy to haze. Hazing is defined as any method of initiation or pre-initiation into a student organization or student body, whether or not the organization or body is officially recognized by an educational institution, which is likely to cause serious bodily injury to any former, current, or prospective student of any school, community college, college, university or other educational institution in this state (Penal Code 245.6), and in addition, any act likely to cause physical harm, personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm, to any former, current, or prospective student of any school, community college, university, or other educational institution. The term “hazing” does not include customary athletic events or school sanctioned events. Neither the express or implied consent of a victim of hazing, nor the lack of active participation in a particular hazing incident is a defense. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of hazing is not a neutral act and is also a violation of this section.\n\nUse, possession, manufacture, or distribution of illegal drugs or drug-related paraphernalia, (except as expressly permitted by law and university regulations) or the misuse of legal pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nUse, possession, manufacture, or distribution of alcoholic beverages (except as expressly permitted by law and university regulations), or public intoxication while on campus or at a university related activity.\n\nTheft of property or services from the university community, or misappropriation of university resources.\n\nUnauthorized destruction, or damage to university property or other property in the university community.\n\nPossession or misuse of firearms or guns, replicas, ammunition, explosives, fireworks, knives, other weapons, or dangerous chemicals (without the prior authorization of the university president) on campus or at a university related activity.\n\nUnauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication of academic presentations (including handwritten notes) for a commercial purpose.\n\nMisuse of computer facilities or resources, including:\n\nUnauthorized entry into a file, for any purpose.\n\nUnauthorized transfer of a file.\n\nUse of another's identification or password.\n\nUse of computing facilities, campus network, or other resources to interfere with the work of another member of the university community.\n\nUse of computing facilities and resources to send obscene or intimidating and abusive messages.\n\nUse of computing facilities and resources to interfere with normal university operations.\n\nUse of computing facilities and resources in violation of copyright laws.\n\nViolation of a university computer use policy.\n\nViolation of any published university policy, rule, regulation or presidential order.\n\nFailure to comply with directions of, or interference with, any university official or any public safety officer while acting in the performance of their duties.\n\nAny act chargeable as a violation of a federal, state, or local law that poses a substantial threat to the safety or well-being of members of the university community, to property within the university community or poses a significant threat of disruption or interference with university operations.\n\nViolation of the Student Conduct Procedures, including:\n\nFalsification, distortion, or misrepresentation of information related to a student discipline matter.\n\nDisruption or interference with the orderly progress of a student discipline proceeding.\n\nInitiation of a student discipline proceeding in bad faith.\n\nAttempting to discourage another from participating in the student discipline matter.\n\nAttempting to influence the impartiality of any participant in a student discipline matter.\n\nVerbal or physical harassment or intimidation of any participant in a student discipline matter.\n\nFailure to comply with the sanction(s) imposed under a student discipline proceeding.\n\nEncouraging, permitting, or assisting another to do any act that could subject them to discipline.\n\nProcedures for Enforcing this Code\n\nThe chancellor shall adopt procedures to ensure students are afforded appropriate notice and an opportunity to be heard before the university imposes any sanction for a violation of the Student Conduct Code. [Note: At the time of publication, such procedures are set forth in the California State University Student Conduct Procedures Policy (Revised October 6, 2023).]\n\nApplication of this Code\n\nSanctions for the conduct listed above can be imposed on applicants, enrolled students, students between academic terms, graduates awaiting degrees, and students who withdraw from school while a disciplinary matter is pending. Conduct that threatens the safety or security of the university community, or substantially disrupts the functions or operation of the University is within the jurisdiction of this Article regardless of whether it occurs on or off campus. Nothing in this Code may conflict with Education Code section 66301 that prohibits disciplinary action against students based on behavior protected by the First Amendment.\n\nTitle 5, California Code of Regulations, § 41302. Disposition of Fees: University Emergency; Interim Suspension. The president of the university may place on probation, suspend, or expel a student for one or more of the causes enumerated in Section 41301. No fees or tuition paid by or for such student for the semester, quarter, or summer session in which the student is suspended or expelled shall be refunded. If the student is readmitted before the close of the semester, quarter, or summer session in which the student is suspended, no additional tuition or fees shall be required of the student on account of the suspension.\n\nDuring periods of emergency, as determined by the president of the individual university, the president may, after consultation with the chancellor, place into immediate effect any emergency regulations, procedures, and other measures deemed necessary or appropriate to meet the emergency, safeguard persons and property, and maintain educational activities.\n\nThe president may immediately impose an interim suspension in all cases in which there is reasonable cause to believe that such an immediate suspension is required in order to protect lives or property and to insure the maintenance of order. A student so placed on interim suspension shall be given prompt notice of charges and the opportunity for a hearing within 10 days of the imposition of interim suspension. During the period of interim suspension, the student shall not, without prior written permission of the president or designated representative, enter any of the CSUs other than to attend the hearing. Violation of any condition of interim suspension shall be grounds for expulsion.\n\nUse of Social Security Number\n\nApplicants are required to include their correct social security numbers in designated places on applications for admission pursuant to the authority contained in Section 41201, Title 5, California Code of Regulations, and Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6109). The university uses the social security number to identify students and their records including identification for purposes of financial aid eligibility and disbursement and the repayment of financial aid and other debts payable to the institution. Also, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the university to file information returns that include the student's social security number and other information such as the amount paid for qualified tuition, related expenses, and interest on educational loans. This information is used by the IRS to help determine whether a student, or a person claiming a student as a dependent, may take a credit or deduction to reduce federal income taxes. The Financial Aid Office will also use it to report Federal Work Study earnings to the Federal Department of Education."
