        "text": "Best Colleges in California: Introduction\n\nWith one of the most robust public university systems in the nation—as well as many top-ranked private colleges—California has a lot to offer college students. So, if you want to be surrounded by beautiful landscapes, incredible cities, and ocean views, one of the best colleges in California might be the place for you.\n\nAs you can see, the best universities in California include both public and private schools. However, as we’ll discuss, there are plenty of top colleges in California beyond those listed above.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explore the best colleges in California—what they are, where you’ll find them, and what makes each of them special.\n\nSpecifically, we’ll look at:\n\nHow many colleges are in California?\n\nWhat kinds of colleges are in California?\n\nThe best universities in California\n\nWhat are the best liberal arts colleges in California?\n\nPrivate colleges in California\n\nUniversity of California rankings\n\nWhat makes different top California colleges unique?\n\nCommunity colleges in California\n\nAnd more!\n\nWe’ll also use factors like the University of California rankings and the California State University rankings to help you decide where each school falls on your college list. In truth, this can help you find the top universities in California based on your needs.\n\nNow, let’s take a closer look at what the best universities in California have to offer. Then, we’ll dig into the top universities in California by category and describe what makes them unique.\n\nHow many colleges are in California?\n\nAs one of the largest states in the country, it’s no surprise that there are hundreds of colleges in California. In total, there are over 450 colleges and universities in California.\n\nThis includes:\n\nSo, if you’re looking for top colleges in California, you’ll have plenty of options. The top universities in California are both public and private. From Caltech to UC Berkeley to Claremont McKenna, there’s no shortage of choice when it comes to the top universities in California.\n\nLargest public university system in the world\n\nCalifornia is home to the largest public university system in the world—the CSU system. As such, this system includes many top colleges in California. So, as you think about public universities in California, you can also look at schools beyond the nine University of California campuses. While the UC system includes many top colleges in California, you can also get a great education at other public schools in the California State University system.\n\nThere are also plenty of great private colleges in California. Some of the best private colleges in California include the Claremonts, which we’ll discuss in more depth later in this article. But suffice it to say, from private colleges in California to public universities in California, this state has a school for everyone. So, let’s take a deeper dive into the top universities in California!\n\nWhat kinds of colleges are in California?\n\nThe best universities in California come in all shapes and sizes. No matter your interests, you’ll likely find California colleges that suit your needs.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at three types of public and private top colleges in California that might interest you:\n\nPublic research universities\n\nPrivate research universities\n\nPrivate liberal arts colleges\n\nPublic universities in California\n\nWe’ve discussed that California is home to the UC system, which includes many of the top universities in California. With nine campuses spread across the state, the UC system is one of the best public university systems in the nation. It includes many of the top colleges in California, and competition for acceptance can be fierce.\n\nNote that the UC schools are test-blind. In short, this means they do not consider test scores in the review process.\n\nSeveral more UCs\n\nThe UC system also includes UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Riverside, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Merced (graduate studies only). Incredibly, these schools can all be counted among the top colleges in California. However, note that the UC Davis ranking is below the UC Irvine ranking. The UCSD ranking and the UC Santa Cruz rankings are also slightly lower than their others in the UC system. However, the UCSD ranking is by no means low, nor is the UC Santa Cruz ranking.\n\nWhile all of the UC schools are among the best universities in California, each has their own distinct character. We’ve highlighted how the top universities in California all differ, and the UC schools are no exception.\n\nSo, as you prepare for the UC application process, do your research. That way, you can find the top universities in California for your needs and goals. Then, work hard on your essays so your application stands out—and check out our advice here. Plus, for more tips on the UC application and Personal Insight Questions, read this guide. The UCs are some of the best universities in California, so you’ll want to make sure you’ve done your research when you apply!\n\nBeyond the UC System\n\nWe’ve discussed how the UC schools are some of the best universities in California. However, there are other incredible colleges out there. If you’re looking for top California colleges that are a bit less selective, you might turn your attention to the California State University system.\n\nThe California State University rankings are admittedly not as high as the UCSB ranking or UC Irvine ranking. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t get a top-tier education at any one of these 23 campuses. So, when you think about the top universities in California, don’t discount these schools.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the CSU system—specifically, the three top schools on the California State University rankings:\n\nBest Colleges in California: Private Universities\n\nOf course, you’ll find some excellent private universities in California. Many of these schools are universally acknowledged as the top universities in California. However, this can also make these top California colleges more challenging to get into.\n\nBased on the U.S. News rankings, the best universities in California (private) are:\n\nSo many schools to choose from\n\nAs you can see, there are plenty of private and public universities in California. Each has its own distinct character, academic reputation, and campus feel. So, if you’re set on attending college in California, make sure you do your research. This is key as you find the top universities in California for your needs.\n\nCollege rankings are a great place to start. However, don’t get too hung up on the Pepperdine ranking, the Caltech ranking, or the USC ranking. At the end of the day, remember to center your own priorities. Think about the college location, college size, and overall college experience that might be right for you. After all, the best universities in California will be specific to your unique needs.\n\nLiberal Arts Colleges in California\n\nThere are also several top-ranked liberal arts colleges in California: namely, the Claremont Colleges. Located in Claremont, CA—just 40 minutes away from Los Angeles—the Claremont Colleges have a tight-knit campus feel. Given their small class sizes, these schools suit students looking for more personal interactions with their professors. The Claremont Colleges definitely qualify as some of the top California colleges.\n\nMost students live on campus at each of the Claremont Colleges, making the city a bustling college town. Students can also cross-register for courses at any one of the Claremont Colleges. So, if you attend Pomona but want to take classes at Harvey Mudd, you can feel free to do so. Let’s take a closer look at the Claremont Colleges and their rankings:\n\nCommunity Colleges in California\n\nYou’ll also find plenty of community colleges in California. While these schools might not top the college rankings, that doesn’t make them less valuable. If you’re looking for a starting point in your higher education process, you might look at various community colleges in California. Depending on your needs, like college size or location, these might be some of the top colleges in California for you.\n\nA community college degree allows you to pursue higher education on a part-time basis. It can also give you the opportunity to transfer to a larger university after you complete a certain number of credits.\n\nMost community colleges in California don’t have campus housing. This means that community colleges in California will predominantly serve those who already live (aptly) in the community. You can commute to classes and enjoy a more flexible course schedule, often including online credits. Community colleges in California (and elsewhere) are also often more affordable, which can be deeply valuable to students. So, for some applicants, the best universities in California include several of the community colleges in California that made our list!\n\nColleges in California Map\n\nBelow, you’ll find a map of some top California colleges. This includes many of the top colleges in California.\n\nAs you can see from our colleges in California map, the best colleges in California are located all across the state. If you want to be at the center of Los Angeles, you might consider UCLA or USC. Or, if you want to be near the city but don’t mind a drive, the Claremont Colleges might be the place for you.\n\nMoving north, you’ll find Stanford and UC Davis, among other top schools. While both of these colleges are in a suburban setting, students still have access to plenty of resources. Maybe one or both of these are the top colleges in California for you!\n\nThe California Coast\n\nIf you want to be on the coast, you might look at Pepperdine or UC Santa Barbara. These colleges provide students with ready access to the beach—for research and recreation alike.\n\nCalifornia is a large state, and—as you can see from our colleges in California map—the best colleges in California span hundreds of miles. So, do your research, and don’t forget to think about college location. This will help you as you begin your UC application process or consider other top California colleges.\n\nWhat are the best colleges in California?\n\nSo, we’ve already broken down the best universities in California into several categories. Now, let’s look at a list of the overall best colleges in California according to U.S. News.\n\nBefore we dig into the rankings, a reminder: no list can tell you the best colleges in California for you. Take all college rankings with a grain of salt. Do your research on every school that interests you, and don’t focus too much on the numbers. Instead, look at what programs they offer, what class sizes are like, where the campus is located, and other key features. Plus, if you have time for college visits, seeing a school in person can make a huge difference. Only this research can help you determine the top California colleges for your college list.\n\nTop 10 Best Colleges in California\n\nNow, let’s explore some lists of the top universities in California. Of course, these lists are not the objective final word.\n\nAfter all, college rankings aren’t everything. At the end of the day, you want to find the top universities in California for you. U.S. News can’t tell you what you need in a college, so always use your judgment. These rankings are meant to help guide you as you choose your top California colleges to apply to. Based on the college rankings, the best universities in California are:\n\nThese are some of the top universities in California. As you can see, they vary in college size and college setting. However, as we’ve discussed, there are hundreds of colleges in California. So, if the top universities in California for your needs aren’t on that list, don’t worry. There are plenty of top colleges in California, and they all have their unique features. Each applicant will likely have a different list of the best universities in California for them.\n\nTop Colleges in California — Liberal Arts Schools\n\nNote that the list above only includes the best universities in California—that is, it does not include liberal arts schools. In terms of the best liberal arts colleges in California, Niche ranks the top California colleges as follows:\n\nAs you can see, the Claremont Colleges are consistently ranked as the best colleges in California. These schools have vast resources and a powerful consortium network despite their small college size. This makes them some of the top colleges in California by any metric.\n\nHowever, there are also plenty of top California colleges beyond the Claremont Colleges. These include Occidental College, Vanguard University, and MiraCosta College, among others. So, feel free to think beyond the Claremonts as you look for the top colleges in California.\n\nTop 10 Private Colleges in California\n\nIf you’re looking for private colleges in California, you’ll have plenty of options when it comes to the best colleges in California. There are many top universities in California with both private and public funding. While a school’s funding status might dictate its tuition or other key attributes, you can get a great education at any of the top universities in California.\n\nPrivate colleges can offer students boundless opportunities. According to the U.S. News rankings, the best universities in California (private) are:\n\nPrivate vs. public\n\nHowever, note that these private colleges won’t necessarily give you a better education than the best public universities in California or even the top community colleges in California. In fact, looking at the college rankings, many UC campuses outrank the private colleges listed above, exceeding the USC ranking and the Pepperdine ranking. So, don’t just look at factors like the Caltech ranking to make your college decisions. Instead, when it comes to the top colleges in California, think about how public colleges, including community colleges in California, stack up.\n\nTop universities in California come in all shapes and sizes. So, as you search for top California colleges, you should look at both public and private institutions. This will help you find the best colleges in California for you.\n\nNext, let’s look at some more of the top colleges in California.\n\nWhat’s the best college in California?\n\nAccording to the U.S. News rankings, Stanford is the best college in California. The Stanford University ranking is #1 among California Universities.\n\nStanford is one of the best colleges in California for biology.\n\nIn fact, biology is one of the top ten majors at Stanford. Other popular majors include computer science, engineering, and physical sciences. However, Stanford isn’t just for STEM-focused students. The school also has many impressive humanities programs, as well as one of the best business schools in California.\n\nStanford is also one of the best colleges in California for doctors. Many students at Stanford pursue a pre-med track, taking advantage of the school’s vast resources. Students who attend Stanford often go on to medical school at top universities across the nation.\n\nSince the Stanford University ranking is so high, it’s no surprise that the school isn’t easy to get into. Stanford is one of the top colleges in California, which makes it quite selective. With an acceptance rate of just 4%, most admitted students have high GPAs and star-studded extracurricular achievements.\n\nSeeing beyond rankings\n\nIt’s also important to note that while Stanford is (by ranking) the best college in California, it might not be the best college in California for you. You shouldn’t build your college list based on rankings alone. Instead, you should get more specific as you find the top colleges in California for you. For example, you should also look at the University of California rankings or the Pepperdine ranking when making your college list.\n\nYou should look at overall “college fit,” considering factors like college setting, class size, and more. You can also look back at our colleges in California map for some inspiration. Additionally, you can look at specialty lists of the best colleges in California for nursing, economics, film, or other fields that interest you. This can help you narrow down your list of the top colleges in California for you.\n\nWhat’s the number one community college in California?\n\nBased on college rankings, Foothill College is the best community college in California.\n\nHowever, when it comes to community colleges in California, you shouldn’t fixate on college rankings. Instead, you should look at community colleges in California in your area or in an area where you’d like to find housing and/or work.\n\nFoothill College has an open-door admissions policy. That means that if you’re over 18, you’re automatically eligible to register—no application needed. So, if you’re looking for a stress-free way to start your education, this might be one of the top colleges in California for you.\n\nAssociates degrees in Arts or Sciences\n\nStudents at Foothill College can graduate with an Associate in Arts or Sciences and either enter the job market or transfer to a four-year institution. Like many other community colleges in California, Foothill also allows students to transfer into schools within the California State University system. So, the community colleges in California can be great stepping stones for many students before they pursue a B. S. or B. A. at another school.\n\nAll to say—as you consider the best colleges in California, keep your own needs in mind. The college rankings might not consider community colleges in California to be the best colleges in California. However, given their flexibility, these schools can be the best colleges in California for some students. So, don’t immediately knock community colleges in California off your list.\n\nExploring the University of California System\n\nWe’ve looked at a variety of the best colleges in California, from the best universities in California to the best community colleges in California. Next, let’s take a closer look at the UC schools.\n\nWhen exploring the best colleges in California, institutions within the University of California system are popular options. Why do the UC campuses rank as some of the top California colleges? There are many reasons for the consistently impressive University of California rankings as top universities in California. They tell us that students will have access to advanced facilities with knowledgeable professors from many fields.\n\nThe University of California was founded over 150 years ago on the idea that college should be available to everyone. The UC schools try to maintain that principle to this day. However, with the University of California rankings so high among national public institutions, the acceptance rates are low. You’ll notice that the UC schools top many lists of the best universities in California.\n\nFocus on the best school for YOU\n\nWhen finding the right school for you, lists naming the top universities in California can be helpful. Still, there are plenty of other top colleges in California to choose from. Certainly, the University of California rankings tell us they are some of the best universities in California. That being said, your personal “Best Universities in California” list may not have a single UC school on it. That’s okay. Choosing your top universities in California is a personal choice that depends on factors like college size, major, price, and location. So, each student’s top California colleges list will look different!\n\nAfter all, how many colleges are in California? Look at our colleges in California map for some inspiration. There are loads of schools, including public universities in California, private colleges in California, and community colleges in California. You’ll find everything from large research institutes like Stanford University to community colleges like Foothill College. But for now, let’s take a closer look at some of the more well-known best universities in California.\n\nHow many UCs are there?\n\nThere are ten campuses in the University of California system, nine of which offer undergraduate degrees. All of them are considered some of the best universities in California. With so many options, students set on top universities in California would be happy at many of the UC locations.\n\nThe UC campuses offer 160 academic programs and 800-degree options. No matter what you choose to study, there’s a campus within the UC system that will provide you with a top education in that field. Schools within the UC system are known as some of the best research public universities in California and the nation.\n\nPersonal Insight Questions\n\nThe UC application is similar to the Common Application. However, when completing the UC application, students will use the UC portal and answer UC-specific essays. Students should know to which campus they wish to apply before completing the UC application.\n\nThe consistently high University of California rankings tell us that UC schools are some of the best universities in California. So, students should take time to carefully and thoughtfully complete their UC application, from essays to activities. Note that the UC system is not just test-optional, but test-blind. UC admissions doesn’t consider standardized test scores as part of your UC application. Check out this webinar to learn more about applying to UC schools.\n\nLet’s take a look at each UC college setting, as they are all some of top universities in California:\n\nDiscovering California State Universities\n\nWhen researching the best colleges in California, you might focus on the UC system rather than the California State University system. However, the CSUs are also some of the top colleges in California. Like the UC system, the California State system houses multiple public universities in California. There are 23 campuses within the California State University system. Yearly, the CSU educates over 477,000 students.\n\nUniversities within the CSU system strive to be affordable options for students. In fact, the California State University rankings show that these are not only some of the top California colleges, but also some of the best budget options nationwide. More than half of CSU students graduate with no student loan debt. Wow, no wonder these are considered some of the top colleges in California!\n\nCalifornia State University rankings\n\nWhile college rankings aren’t everything, the California State University rankings can tell you a bit more about how these schools compare to other institutions. This can help you decide if the CSU system is right for you. Maybe the CSUs will be first on your list of the best universities in California for you.\n\nThere are many college location options within the California State University system. So, you should find your campus match before starting your application to these top universities in California. Be sure to check the application dates and deadlines, as they will vary according to each campus.\n\nTop Colleges in California: The Claremont Colleges\n\nThere are seven institutions in total that make up the Claremont Colleges, including five private colleges in California:\n\nPomona College\n\nClaremont Graduate University\n\nScripps College\n\nClaremont McKenna College\n\nHarvey Mudd College\n\nPitzer College\n\nKeck Graduate Institute\n\nLike the UC and CSU schools, these are some of the top colleges in California. Unlike the institutions in the UC and CSU system, the Claremont Colleges are all private colleges in California near each other. As the name implies, all of the Claremont Colleges are located in Claremont, a city in Southern California. Located on over 500 acres of land, the Claremont Colleges are home to 9,000 students. These colleges consistently make top colleges in California lists.\n\nThe city of trees and PhDs\n\nKnown as the “City of Trees and PhDs”, Claremont offers a truly unique environment to its students. It is close to Los Angeles but situated in the hills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Students hoping to join this consortium—which includes some of the top colleges in California—must apply to each campus individually. However, once admitted, students have access to all of the institutions’ facilities. With so many facilities, it’s no wonder these schools are some of the top colleges in California.\n\nWhile the Claremont Colleges are some of the best universities in California, there are other small, private liberal arts schools. For example, Pepperdine University is just one example of many top California colleges that may have made your list. The Pepperdine ranking is #55 on U.S. News’ National Universities list. This tells us that Pepperdine is among the top California colleges. The high Pepperdine ranking means they too offer a quality education, making it one of the best universities in California. Remember, you have plenty of options when choosing your top colleges in California.\n\nWhat are each of the Claremont Colleges known for?\n\nSimilar to the UC and CSU system, applicants who hope to attend one of the private colleges in California that make up the Claremont Colleges will need to apply to the specific campus and institution.\n\nOnce again, these schools are some of the best colleges in California. You can apply to multiple Claremont colleges, and each has its own character.\n\nLet’s check out a snapshot of each of the institutions that make the Claremont Colleges, which are some of the top California colleges.\n\nBest Colleges in California by Major\n\nWhen deciding to study in California, there are many choices for top colleges in California or top universities in California.

However, there are many top California colleges lists to help you find top-ranking pre-med programs.\n\nThere’s no definitive list of the best pre-med programs or the best colleges in California for doctors. This is because programs can vary greatly depending on the school. So, instead, look for the best universities in California for doctors for you.

In that case, think about studying at one of the best colleges in California for biology. Many universities on our list will look familiar, as they are some of the best colleges in California overall.\n\nHowever, remember that our “best colleges in California for biology” list may be different from your own. There are plenty of top universities in California offering excellent biology programs.\n\nHere is Niche’s top 5 best colleges in California for biology:\n\nBest universities in California: Admissions Odds\n\nWhen crafting an application for one of the best colleges in California, remember that many of the top universities in California will have very low acceptance rates and very competitive admissions. For example, Stanford, the #1 top college in California, has an acceptance rate of just 4.3%. Caltech, at with a Caltech ranking of #2 out of the best colleges in California, has an acceptance rate of around 4% as well– similar to the acceptance rates of Ivy League Colleges like Princeton or Yale.\n\nSince California has such high-ranking public universities, the acceptance rates for these research-driven top public universities will be lower than at similar schools in other states. An example of this is UC Berkeley: despite being a large public university, UC Berkeley is incredibly selective with a 15% acceptance rate.\n\nThe low acceptance rates at many of the top colleges in California mean that you need to put extra effort into your application. This means crafting persuasive and well-written college essays, paying close attention to your extracurriculars, and keeping your GPA high.\n\nBuild a well-balanced list\n\nWhen you’re crafting a college list, make sure to balance it between safeties, matches, and reaches– don’t only apply to the top colleges in California with the lowest acceptance rates. Additionally, keep in mind that many colleges have gone test-optional – check out our guide on the best test-optional colleges.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that just because some of the best colleges in California have incredibly low acceptance rates doesn’t necessarily make those schools a better fit for you. When making your college decisions, you should take many factors into account. For example, does the school have extracurriculars that you would enjoy? Is there a good student-faculty ratio? Is the food good? Would you rather have a school that has beautiful autumns, cool winters, hot summers and pleasant springs, or are you more interested in attending a school that has a balmy climate year-round? The best colleges in California are incredibly varied– don’t limit yourself by only applying to the best universities in California with the lowest acceptance rates. And, don’t apply only because U.S. News told you which were the top colleges in California– do your own research!\n\nWhat is the easiest college to get into in California?\n\nIf you’re just trying to study in California and don’t care about a university’s prestige, consider a community college. Most community colleges have 100% acceptance rates, making them statistically the easiest colleges to get into in California.\n\nCommunity colleges have many benefits, including flexible schedules, low tuition prices, transferable credits, and online classes. Going to community college might be a good fit for you if you are taking a non-traditional college path, want to work a full-time job while you attend college, or are saving up to attend a more expensive graduate school. Plus, the community colleges in California have a deal with the California state college system, making it very easy to transfer your community college credits after a few years and enroll in one of the best universities in California.\n\nEven if you are aiming to attend one of the best colleges in California, like UC Berkeley or Caltech, you need to balance out your college list with some safety schools. Here are some schools in California that are less selective if your top priority is to be in California:\n\nWhat is the hardest college to get into in California?\n\nWhen thinking about the “hardest” colleges to get into, there are many factors to take into account. Since most universities review applications holistically, what makes a school difficult to get into depends on the strengths and weaknesses of your application.\n\nFor example, if you have very strong writing skills but lower grades, a school that has a very high average GPA for their first-year class might be harder to get into. Alternatively, if you have strong grades and test scores but worry about your ability to tell a story, applying to STEM-focused schools like Caltech might give you a better chance.\n\nIn terms of acceptance rates, the college with the lowest acceptance rate in California is Stanford. Stanford is statistically the hardest college to get into in California, with an acceptance rate of 4.3%. This means that they only accept around 4 of every 100 applicants, so even if you have perfect scores, a 4.0 GPA, well-written essays, and extracurriculars that demonstrate leadership and investment, Stanford would still be a “reach” school.\n\nAnother reach school\n\nIn addition, Caltech is also one of the hardest colleges to get into in California. Caltech has an acceptance rate of 6.4%. Caltech has a very small student body–around 1000 undergrads– so it is incredibly selective in its admissions process. Caltech is also more academically focused, and is not a traditional “liberal arts” college. If you’re applying to Caltech, you should have a passion for science and research and be committed to pursuing a career in these fields.\n\nRemember, acceptance rates aren’t everything. The top colleges in California are the colleges that are the best fit for you. If you want to attend a small liberal arts college, UCLA’s #4 ranking shouldn’t pull you to their campus of 30,000 students. Look beyond prestige and prioritize your needs when it comes to deciding on a college.\n\nWhat is the prettiest college in California?\n\nIf you’re applying to some of the best colleges in California, you might have seen some schools achieve rankings of the most beautiful college campuses in the U.S. Stanford frequently is mentioned on these lists for its unique architecture and sunny weather. California is a geographically varied and beautiful state, with ocean views, forests, mountains, and deserts alike– so if you’re looking for natural beauty, you’ve come to the right state!\n\nHowever, beauty is subjective– there is no one “prettiest college” in California. That said, California is an incredibly geographically diverse state with many gorgeous natural features and many beautiful college campuses. Depending on your needs, these top colleges in California with stunning campuses might provide the aesthetic background to your studies that you’re looking for:\n\nWhat is the cheapest college in California?\n\nWhile reading this article about the best colleges in California, you might have been wondering: how much does it cost to attend one of the top universities in California, like Stanford or Caltech? The price of college tuition is a very influential factor for many families when it comes to choosing what university to attend but worry not: you can still attend one of the best colleges in California without breaking the bank.\n\nIf money is a priority, look no further than the California State University system. The CSUs are incredibly well regarded nationally for having some of the best value-for-money out of any colleges in the United States. According to the “Washington Monthly,” all 23 CSU campuses were included in their 2021 list of “Best Bang for the Buck” campuses in the West. The CSUs also celebrate diversity; nearly half of students at CSUs are underrepresented minorities.\n\nAnd if that weren’t reason enough to attend universities in the California State University system, the CSU includes many of the cheapest colleges in the whole state of California.\n\nCSU & Affordabilty\n\nThe CSU system sets a base tuition every academic year, and each campus adds their own mandatory fees. The base tuition for CSUs is $5,742 per year.\n\nHere are some examples of CSUs prices per year including Full-time Tuition + Campus Fees:\n\nCSU Bakersfield: $7,637\n\nCSU Fresno: $6,663\n\nCSU Los Angeles: $6,805\n\nCompared to the UC system, these prices are significantly lower. For example, the yearly tuition at UC Merced is $13,657 for in-state students and $43,411 for out-of-state applicants. The cost of attending a campus in the CSU system is not only significantly cheaper but does not change for in-state vs. out-of-state applicants.\n\nMost expensive schools\n\nIf you’re wondering about the most expensive colleges in California, look to private, liberal arts colleges. Number one on the CBS News list of most expensive colleges in the United States is Harvey Mudd. Harvey Mudd is part of the Claremont Colleges, a consortium of small, liberal arts schools in Claremont, CA. However, it is important to note that around 70% of Harvey Mudd’s student body receives some form of financial aid, so most attendees of the college are not paying the full $77K tuition.\n\nAnother college that ranks high on the list of most expensive colleges in the United States is USC, the University of Southern California. One of the best colleges in California, USC is the fourth most expensive college in the U.S., and the second most expensive college in California.\n\nCollegeAdvisor Resources on California Colleges\n\nAt CollegeAdvisor, we see many students every year looking to study in California for college.

To learn more about Stanford, look at our page on Stanford and why we think it has earned an A+ general rating as a university.\n\nClaremont Colleges\n\nIf you want to attend one of the top colleges in California but nearly 8,000 undergraduates feels too overwhelming, the Claremont colleges might be a good option. The Claremont colleges are five small liberal arts universities in a consortium: Harvey Mudd, Pomona, Scripps, Pitzer, and Claremont McKenna. However, keep in mind that by limiting your search to small, private universities, you’ll miss out on some of the best colleges in California– the UCs.\n\nUniversity of California System\n\nThe UC system is one of the best public university systems in the country, and many UCs rank among the best colleges in California. In fact, UCLA and UC Berkeley fall within the top five universities in California, and other campuses like UC San Diego, UC Davis, and UC Santa Barbara are all listed within the top 10 best colleges in California.\n\nCalifornia State University System\n\nIf you are intrigued by the idea of a public university but want a bit more flexibility in your course of study, look to the CSUs. The California State University system differs from the UCs in many ways, and price is one of the most significant. The CSU system charges a base rate of tuition of $5,742 per year for all of its campuses and adds on a few thousand dollars in fees based on the campus you attend. This is significantly cheaper than the UC system. If you were raised in California, tuition for somewhere like UC Berkeley could be around $14,226, but if you live out-of-state, tuition jumps to $43,980.\n\nSo, if you’re still stumped on how to navigate the best colleges in California, we at CollegeAdvisor are here to support you.
