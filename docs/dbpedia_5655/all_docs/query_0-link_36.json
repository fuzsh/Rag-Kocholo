        "text": "Melvyn Stokes is Professor of Film History at University College London. He has also been a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow at Princeton and Fulbright Visiting Professor at Mount Holyoke College. His authored books are: D. W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation: A History of “The Most Controversial Motion Picture of All Time” (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007); Gilda (London: BFI Publishing/Palgrave Macmillan, 2010); and American History through Hollywood Film: From the Revolution to the 1960s (London: Bloomsbury, 2013). He is currently completing a book for Oxford University Press on the reception of Charlie Chaplin’s films and star persona in France. He has edited or co-edited 12 books, including a 4-volume series for British Film Institute Publishing (1999-2004) on Hollywood’s audiences. One of these, Hollywood Abroad: Audiences and Cultural Exchange, is believed to be the first book to address the subject of the audiences for American movies outside the United States. He has also published more than 40 articles in scholarly journals and books, many dealing with transatlantic cultural interactions. For 6 years (2008-2014) he was president of SERCIA, the European film organization devoted to the study of English-speaking cinema.\n\n– Michael Pullen, Paxton Rigby, Shane Walker\n\nMichael Pullen, Paxton Rigby, Shane Walker: The Birth of the Nation broke box office records. What was so appealing about this movie to Americans?\n\nMelvyn Stokes: It was surrounded by enormous “hype” suggesting it had cost half a million dollars to make (really $100,000) and used thousands of actors and extras (more like 300 in all). It was the first long American historical film and beautifully edited to its climax in two “rescue” scenes. Most if not all scenes were tinted (war scenes were red, for example). It was initially shown only in “live” theatres at unusually high prices (up to $2 a seat). It was also road-showed – shown mainly in larger cities (people sometimes had to travel for long distances to see it). News of it spread by word of mouth as well as publicity campaigns, and many people went to see it several times. Watching it, accompanied by a full orchestra playing Joseph Carl Breil’s score, seems to have been an overwhelming experience for white Americans of 1915.\n\nMP & PR & SW: How is the KKK represented in the film?\n\nMS: Favorably. Gallant white-robed ‘knights’ who rescue white women and other repressed whites in Reconstruction-era South Carolina. They do so by fighting and defeated the attempt to impose “black” rule on the South and punishing (supposedly) sexually predatory black men. Historically, all this was rubbish (though not very far removed from what some historians of the early twentieth century believed). The Klan disappeared around 1870/71 and took no part in the restoration of white rule in South Carolina in 1876/77. But the representation of the Klan suggests that the white North and South could easily unite together again after the Civil War in opposition to African Americans. By doing this, it helped justify the denial of civil and political rights to American blacks that characterized much of the South in the first 60+ years of the twentieth century.\n\nMP & PR & SW: Why was the film censored? What were the primary objections against it?\n\nMS: For the most part it wasn’t censored in the US (though France banned it in 1916 and again in 1923). The so-called National Board of Censorship in New York approved it in March 1915. During its initial run, it was banned in only 2 states: Ohio and Kansas. Attempts to ban it in cities like Chicago by organizations such as the NAACP either failed or were quickly overturned by the courts. Part of the problem was that almost no jurisdictions (Des Moines, Iowa was an exception) banned films such as this for encouraging racial prejudice. The courts, by contrast, accepted that the contractual rights of those exhibitors who had paid to show the film in their town or city could not be infringed. Those who campaigned against it, such as members of the NAACP, did so because The Birth of a Nation was an intensely racist film that caricatured African Americans as villains.\n\nMP & PR & SW: Where was the filmed debuted? What is the significance?\n\nMS: It opened in Los Angeles on February 8, 1915. It started its run in New York (after a detour to Washington, where it shown to President Woodrow Wilson and members of Congress and the Supreme Court) on March 3, 1915 at the Liberty Theater (an unfortunately ironic name!). It opened in Boston on April 10. Opposition to it in Boston was led not by the NAACP as much as by William Monroe Trotter, who used in his campaign against the film types of protest and direct action that would later become characteristic of the Civil Rights Movement. All to no avail. The film opened and ran with just a few cuts. One week after it opened, May Childs Nerney, secretary of the NAACP, confessed broken-heartedly that “I never believed myself that this thing could be shown in Abolition Boston.” The South was much poorer than the North and West, a legacy of the Civil War, so there wasn’t much point in having it first shown there in economic terms. It began its run in the South from September 1915 and, when first shown in Georgia, accompanied (rather than inspired) the revival of the Ku Klux Klan by “Colonel” William J. Simmons. In some towns in the South, the film was escorted in by robed members of the new Klan. It carried on being shown to chapters of the Klan, as a recruitment or retention device, at least until the late 1970s. In more general terms, of course, The Birth of a Nation acted as a justification for the unpleasant record of black disfranchisement and segregation that characterized much of the South until the 1960s.\n\nMP & PR & SW: What are the stakes of censoring the film? Why is this film important?\n\nMS: A basic problem for those pushing for censoring the film was that the white liberals who dominated the NAACP board in its early years were torn between their dislike of the film and their dislike of censoring freedom of expression. There were almost no local laws at first in the US banning films that were likely to encourage racial prejudice. Yet, after the Mutual case decision by the Supreme Court in 1915 (a week before Birth of a Nation opened in New York, though Mutual had nothing to do with Griffith’s film), there was no legal basis for defending such films under the free speech protections of the First Amendment. (It took 36 years for the Supreme Court to reverse itself on this.) So the NAACP carried on with its long campaign, securing some local successes over the years, to have the movie banned. While the film usually wasn’t banned, the fact that by the 30s and 40s cinema managers knew that showing it would lead to demonstrations outside their theaters acted as a strong disincentive to showing it. By then, of course, it was showing its age: what had been ground-breaking in 1915 was old-hat in cinematic terms by the 1940s.\n\nThe film is important because, together with Leni Riefenstahl’s Triumph of the Will (1936), it’s one of the two most racist films of all time. And, as I argued in an article in the Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era in October last year, it’s a very conscious racism on director David W. Griffith’s part.\n\nMP & PR & SW: What is problematic about black characters being portrayed in blackface in the film?\n\nMS: It taps into the tradition of minstrel shows using ‘black-face.” Some whites (including liberal progressive Jane Addams) seem not to have noticed that the “blacks” in the film in major roles were all white. But that (the sue of white actors in “black” roles) in part was because of the sexual themes of the film and the fact that many states in 1915 had laws banning miscegenation. But Griffith is also on record with the extremely racist comment that he wanted “no black blood” amongst the principal characters in his film.\n\nMP & PR & SW: What is the relationship between the original film and the recent Birth of a Nation?\n\nMS: Zilch. Nate Parker decided to name his new film about the Nat Turner slave rebellion in tidewater Virginia in 1831 as, presumably, a way of critiquing and overwriting Griffith’s 1915 production. But Griffith’s film was really about white violence against blacks while Parker’s is really about black violence against whites. Slavery, a benign system according to Griffith, is rendered horrid and brutal in Parker’s movie. Parker is right and Griffith was wrong. But both are equally flawed in suggesting that violence is ever the answer to racial problems.\n\nMP & PR & SW: Would you like to add anything else?"
