        "text": "Biography\n\nCelebrated for her artistic contributions to the pulp fiction industry during the 1940s, Gloria Stoll Karn (b. 1923) was one of very few female illustrators working to create a steady stream of tantalizing images for the covers of popular romance and dime store magazines. During the first half of the twentieth century, inexpensive fiction magazines were described as “the pulps” for the wood pulp paper that they were printed on, in contrast to the glossies or “slicks” like The Saturday Evening Post, Collier’s, and Harper’s, which were published on higher quality stock. Sensational subjects—from romance and westerns to crime and detective stories—were popular fare for the genre, which was enjoyed by millions for its captivating entertainment value.\n\nFig. 1. Gloria Stoll Karn, Cover illustration for Detective Tales, July 1945\n\nFrom 1941 to 1949, Stoll Karn’s vibrant, sometimes provocative illustrations were highly sought after by Popular Publications, one of the largest publishers of pulp magazines, and her work appeared regularly in issues of Black Mask, Dime Mystery, Detective Tales, New Detective, All-Story Love, New Love, Love Book, Love Short Stories, Love Novels, Romance, and Thrilling Love, as well Argosy. At the time, female illustrators more frequently worked in educational publishing, or created illustrations focused on domesticity and themes relating to childhood or motherhood. Gloria Stoll Karn: Pulp Romance, a Norman Rockwell Museum exhibition scheduled to be on view from February 10 through June 10 2018, explores the illustrator’s prolific, nearly decade-long career, and her unexpected journey in a world previously assigned to male artists.\n\nThe child of Charles and Anne Stoll, both artists, Stoll Karn was born in the Bronx, New York, and grew up in the borough of Queens. Her earliest aesthetic lessons were derived from her father, a designer and illustrator who gently critiqued her youthful drawings for their accuracy and adherence to the conventions of artistic technique. In describing the use of contour, light, and shadow to describe form, “he reminded me that the lightest lights and the darkest darks never appears on the edge of an object,” she said. “I always remembered that, and it's so true, because even the darkest side of an object has some reflected light coming from its surroundings.”\n\nDuring her teenage years at the newly-established High School of Music and Art, Stoll Karn established fond memories and developed a strong portfolio, hoping to forge a career in the field. However, her father’s untimely death at the age of 45, when she was just 15, and the urgency to earn an income, almost caused her to change course. After graduation, hoping to assist her mother in supporting their household, she sought employment as an artist, but became discouraged when assignments did not materialize. To shore up her finances, she obtained an office job at New York Life Insurance Company, where did secretarial work and filed informational cards on the company’s clients. Eventually, she was promoted from filer to puller, “so I removed the cards then, and there were just endless rows of steel filing cabinets. I can remember looking at the clock and watching the second hand go around,” she said.\n\nFig. 2. Gloria Stoll Karn, 1941\n\nSure that a career in the arts would not be realized, Stoll Karn decided to free up space in the small apartment that she shared with her mother by burning her art portfolio in in her Queens building incinerator. Too large to fit down the chute, she left her work on the floor, awaiting trash removal. Thankfully, a knock on her door by the building’s handyman the next morning revealed that her art was still intact—he had taken the time to leaf through her work and share it with famous pulp illustrator Rafael DeSoto (1904-1992), who was also a building resident. Impressed by what he saw, DeSoto referred Stoll Karn to Popular Publications, and the steady stream of assignments that followed allowed her to establish a thriving freelance career.\n\n“I was still working for the insurance company when he got me a story to illustrate,” Stoll Karn remembered. “We were not supposed to leave the company at lunch or anytime, so I snuck out of the building and took the subway up to 42nd Street to deliver the illustration. I was seated in the editor's office, and after a while, the secretary who had delivered my piece to the art director came back saying, \"Well, Alex said 'we've had worse.'\" Thinking that her career had been launched, Stoll Karn wondered about the implication of this statement, and was concerned that this might be her last opportunity to publish her art, “ but low and behold, sure enough, I did,” she said. “I got another illustration to do, and then another, and another, and another. That's how I got started.”\n\nJust seventeen when she met DeSoto, Stoll Karn found the more established artist to be an important mentor—he willingly shared background on painting techniques and the publishing business, and encouraged her to continue drawing from the model to enhance her knowledge of the figure. While earning her living as an illustrator, she attended evening classes at the Art Students League, where Norman Rockwell had received training decades before, studying anatomy, etching, painting, and lithography. Noted Golden Age illustrator Harvey Dunn (1884-1952), who had been a student of Howard Pyle (1853-1911) and classmate of N.C. Wyeth (1882-1945), was one of her most highly regarded teachers.\n\nVisit artist's website\n\nIllustrations by Gloria Stoll Karn\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nYesterday’s Papers\n\n“Gloria Stoll Karn: Pulp Romance” exhibition video\n\nBibliography\n\nEllis, Douglas, Ed Hulse, and Robert Weinberg.
