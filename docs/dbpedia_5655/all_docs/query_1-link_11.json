        "text": "(1896–1975). American film director William Wellman made more than 80 movies, which included Hollywood classics of documentary-like realism as well as numerous unmemorable films. For his best movies he has been ranked as an action director alongside Howard Hawks and John Ford.\n\nWilliam Augustus Wellman was born on February 29, 1896, in Brookline, Massachusetts. After trying his hand at a number of jobs, he became a professional ice hockey player in Boston, Massachusetts. There actor Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., saw him play, took a liking to him, and offered to find him a job in Hollywood, California. Meanwhile, in 1917, before the United States had entered World War I, Wellman volunteered for ambulance duty in France, then joined the French Foreign Legion, and finally became a fighter pilot in the Lafayette Escadrille, a French air corps unit made up of American flyers. In the process he earned the nickname “Wild Bill,” was shot down, and won the Croix de Guerre for gallantry under fire. Before the war ended, Wellman joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and served as a flight instructor in San Diego, California.\n\nFollowing the war, Wellman took up Fairbanks’s longstanding offer and went to Hollywood. After appearing in a small role in the silent film The Knickerbocker Buckaroo (1919), however, he found that he did not like acting. With Fairbanks’s help, Wellman then got a job at Goldwyn Pictures as a messenger and worked his way up through the ranks of the new industry. By 1923 he was directing B-film westerns, and in 1926 he signed with Paramount. His third picture for that studio was Wings (1927), a World War I aviation drama written by former pilot John Monk Saunders. It shared what was in effect the first Academy Award for best picture with director F.W. Murnau’s Sunrise. Wings reflected Wellman’s interest in aviation and his war experience while setting standards for documentary-like realism with its remarkable aerial camera work and staging of airborne combat. Wellman and Saunders collaborated again on The Legion of the Condemned (1928), a tale about the Lafayette Escadrille. Wellman’s first partial sound film was Beggars of Life (1928).\n\nWellman’s next significant effort was The Public Enemy (1931), a gangster saga that became one of the year’s biggest hits and launched James Cagney on the road to stardom. Wellman’s next two films starred Barbara Stanwyck: in Night Nurse (1931) she played a nurse who stands up to a gangster, played by Clark Gable, and then played the lead in So Big (1932), a version of Edna Ferber’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name. For the remainder of the early 1930s, Wellman made a series of melodramas—with some aerial adventure mixed in—before directing Wild Boys of the Road (1933), a film about three kids during the Great Depression who take to the road in search of a better life.\n\nAfter making several films for Warner Brothers in 1933, Wellman began a successful period as a freelancer. Among his films from the mid-1930s were The Call of the Wild (1935), a major box-office success that starred Gable as the hero of Jack London’s novel of the same name; The President Vanishes (1934), a political tale that is memorable chiefly for providing Rosalind Russell’s first screen appearance; and the love story Small Town Girl (1936), which teamed Robert Taylor and Janet Gaynor.\n\nWellman next directed A Star Is Born (1937), producer David O. Selznick’s remake of the George Cukor-directed film What Price Hollywood? (1932). Wellman collaborated with Robert Carson and Alan Campbell on the story, which won an Academy Award for best original story. Wellman also received a nomination for best director; stars Gaynor and Fredric March were nominated for the best acting awards; and the screenplay and film also received nominations. Nothing Sacred (1937), a screwball comedy that featured Carole Lombard, was just as well received. Men with Wings (1938) was an account of the early days of aviation, written by Wellman and Carson.\n\nBeau Geste (1939) was a remake of the 1926 silent film based on the novel of the same name by Percival C. Wren. In the movie Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, and Robert Preston starred as brothers who stake their honor against the cruelty of their French Foreign Legion commander (played by Brian Donlevy, who earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor). Wellman’s follow-up was The Light That Failed (1939), an adaptation of a Rudyard Kipling story that starred Ronald Colman and Ida Lupino.\n\nIn the 1940s Wellman had success with the comedy Roxie Hart (1942), which many decades later would be the basis for the Broadway musical and film Chicago (2002). His next big hit was the Academy Award-nominated The Ox-Bow Incident (1943), a powerful indictment of mob rule based on Walter van Tilburg Clark’s 1940 novel of the same name. The murder mystery Lady of Burlesque (1943), the biopic Buffalo Bill (1944), and the action film This Man’s Navy (1945) followed.\n\nWellman then directed The Story of G.I. Joe (1945), a critical success about World War II. Robert Mitchum earned an Academy Award nomination for best actor for his portrayal of a battle-weary infantry captain, and Burgess Meredith gave a memorable performance as war correspondent Ernie Pyle, on whose coverage of the U.S. Army’s Italian campaign the film is based. Gallant Journey (1946) was another exploration into aviation; Magic Town (1947), was a satire of Middle America featuring James Stewart; and The Iron Curtain (1948) was a Cold War drama about Russian espionage in Canada. The western Yellow Sky (1948) pitted Gregory Peck and Richard Widmark against each other. Wellman ended the decade with Battleground (1949), an account of the Battle of the Bulge during World War II that was a major box-office hit. The film brought Wellman an Academy Award nomination for best director."
