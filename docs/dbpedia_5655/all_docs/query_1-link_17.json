As icon, as mediated personality, and as object of audience fascination and desire, the Hollywood star remains the model for celebrity in modern culture and represents a paradoxical combination of achievement, talent, ability, luck, authenticity, superﬁciality, and ordinariness. In all of the volumes, stardom is studied as an effect of, and inﬂuence on, the particular historical and industrial contexts that enabled a star to be “discovered,” to be featured in ﬁlms, to be promoted and publicized, and ultimately to become a recognizable and admired— even sometimes notorious—feature of the cultural landscape. Understanding when, how, and why a star “makes it,” dazzling for a brief moment or enduring across decades, is especially relevant given the ongoing importance of mediated celebrity in an increasingly visualized world. We hope that our approach produces at least some of the surprises and delight for our readers that stars themselves do. ADRIENNE L. McLEAN AND MURRAY POMERANCE SERIES EDITORS\n\nJennifer M.

Since then, they have provided invaluable help and guidance, as individual pieces were conceived and reconceived (I still think a chapter on Bugs Bunny would have been ideal for this volume, but there you go!), as potential contributors came and went, and as deadlines approached and sailed past. I appreciate their patience, advice and—in the case of McLean—speciﬁc written contribution to this tome. I also express my debt to all the authors who have lent their expertise and enthusiasm to this endeavor. I also want to state my gratitude and admiration to a number of people at Southern Methodist University. The Division of Cinema-Television has been of enormous support to me throughout the process. I am privileged to be teaching among so many nationally esteemed colleagues, many of whom are represented in this tome. Whether speciﬁcally contributing or not, the SMU community has never ceased to offer inordinate encouragement, advice, and friendship. Much of the work herein is also indebted to two invaluable research resources: the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the Constance McCormack Collection of star scrapbooks housed at the Cinema-Television Library at the University of Southern California. Both contain a veritable treasure trove of clippings from trade papers, movie fan magazines, and studio press releases, primary sources that were vital for such a project as this series. I am certain everyone involved herein extends a thank you to the staff at both these institutions. I have always thought the 1940s to be an undervalued decade in American ﬁlm history, and so was very pleased when I was invited to be involved in this project. I wanted to try to evoke the uniqueness of the moment as personiﬁed by the stars who are speciﬁcally identiﬁed with the era. A number of them have of course received their own chapters in this collection. Many others did not—Danny Kaye, Jennifer Jones, Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake, Lena Horne, Carmen Miranda, Sabu, Van Johnson, Margaret O’Brien, Esther Williams, Jeanne Crain, Dana Andrews. I hope the ambience of the period that they helped shape still emerges. So, to quote a hit song from the period, praise the Lord and pass the ammunition . . . ix\n\nWhat Dreams Were Made Of\n\nINTRODUCTION ★★★★★★★★★★ ✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩\n\nStardom in the 1940s SEAN GRIFFIN\n\nThe 1940s are often conceptualized as a split decade, a temporal “house divided.” Most obviously, World War II deftly cleaved the decade in half. Hitler invaded Poland in late 1939, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. While the United States refrained from entering the ﬁght initially, the pull grew month by month, until the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The war then dominated all aspects of American public life for the next few years. Victory came in both the European and Paciﬁc theaters in 1945, and suddenly the country and the entire world had entered a new world order. This postwar era saw a rapid and full-scale revision of life and thought. Not unexpectedly, many hoped to revert quickly to the way things were before the upheaval of the war. Yet major changes in global politics and advances in scientiﬁc research also irrevocably altered American life. The onset of the Cold War created a new enemy for the United States, and new fears of internal subversion— which at times veered into a fear of anything that diverged from majority thought. The postwar era was also referred to as the Atomic Age, as humanity started coming to terms with the fact that we could now literally destroy the planet and ourselves. As Jacqueline Foertsch has written, “The momentous events of the mid-1940s are thus pivotal in multiple respects,” creating an “impulse to read the 1940s as a decade that is as neatly bisected as it neatly hangs together” (1–2). It was a split decade for the Hollywood studios as well. Many ﬁlm history books cut the 1940s in half, regarding the ﬁrst part as an extension of the classic Hollywood era of the 1930s, and the second part as the start of the post-classical era of the 1950s (Schatz; Lewis; Jewell; Casper). While the studios in wartime had to adjust to the loss of employees to the military, and to stronger involvement (and potential interference) from the federal government, the ﬁrst half of the decade was generally a high time for Hollywood. With national employment ﬁgures suddenly at an all-time high after a decade of economic woes, but with wartime rationing limiting what was available for purchase, everyone went to the movies. Furthermore, the studios had by this time reﬁned their business patterns and the “Hollywood 1\n\n2\n\nSEAN GRIFFIN\n\nstyle” of production, resulting in a number of expertly produced, smoothly told, and conﬁdently crafted ﬁlms. Motion picture theater attendance reached its highest level ever in 1946. And then the bottom fell out. The federal government’s antitrust case, which had been shelved during the war, was revived and in 1948 the Supreme Court decreed (in what became known as the Paramount Decision) that the major studios divest themselves of one arm of their vertically integrated holdings (production, distribution, or exhibition)—signaling an end to the smooth organization of the classical Hollywood system. Furthermore, certain members of the government began training their suspicions on communist inﬁltration on Hollywood, throwing ﬁlmmakers into new panic. Most of all, though, audiences started abandoning ﬁlm theaters. With the onset of the postwar Baby Boom, many moved to newly formed suburban communities—far from urban centers where most movie theaters resided. Whether in cities or suburbs, Americans also increasingly stayed home to watch the new mass-marketed gadget called television (whose development, like the antitrust case, had been put on hold until the end of the war). As the decade ended, Hollywood was scrambling to ﬁgure out how to survive in a very different environment (Dixon). If the studios felt a sharp divide in the 1940s, it is unsurprising that stars experienced it as well. The war signiﬁcantly impacted the lives and careers of most stars, and the postwar period brought even more changes. Actors and actresses, like all Americans, were deeply affected by the war. Some men signed up for active duty in the military, such as James Stewart, Robert Montgomery, and Clark Gable. Others were drafted, like Gene Kelly, Victor Mature, and Mickey Rooney. Some, such as (somewhat ironically) Roy Rogers and John Wayne, received deferments and consequently felt certain pressure to explain why they were not “doing their part.” Such losses left the studios scrambling to ﬁnd leading men—resulting in a number of young actors promoted to stardom, such as Van Johnson, Gregory Peck, Danny Kaye, and Alan Ladd. With women only allowed to enlist in women’s auxiliary units (the WACs, the WAVEs), actresses did not feel as much pressure to put their careers on hold. Yet female stars did actively participate in the war effort, volunteering at war bond drives, and meeting with soldiers at camps, on USO tours, or at the Hollywood Canteen. Older male stars not eligible for the draft did likewise (Doherty; Dick; Koppes and Black). In multiple ways, then, stars increased their actual physical presence among the rest of the population, strengthening their connections to the general public. Cheesecake photos and ﬁlms shipped overseas for screenings in combat zones provided troops with a sense of home and “what they\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nWith many male performers entering the armed services during World War II, Hollywood studios began grooming and promoting a new crop of men. Van Johnson, for example, quickly became MGM’s top male star during the war. Collection of the author.\n\nwere ﬁghting for.” Increased movie attendance further deepened the felt relationship audiences had with stars. Together, these elements created a sense that stars were “just like us,” just perhaps a little “more so.” As one woman opined at the time, “If your idea of a factory girl is a thin little creature who looks downtrodden and underfed, you’re way off the beam, as my chums say. A factory girl in real life looks very much like Brenda Marshall, Anne Shirley, or Betty Grable” (Giles 123).\n\n4\n\nSEAN GRIFFIN\n\nThe major studios had instituted a relatively well oiled system for discovering, grooming, and showcasing talent (as well as controlling it) long before the 1940s, knowing that stars helped market their product. Articles in the industry press indicate that studios began relying more on stars during the decade. Efforts to alleviate pressure from the antitrust case led studios to lessen the amount of block-booking done with theaters, resulting in individual ﬁlms needing to be able to sell themselves. This often meant employing stars more often in projects (Schatz 103–04). While budgets on average increased during the 1940s partly due to this development, even pictures made at B-studios such as Republic began to rely on stars such as Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, and Judy Canova. No doubt recognizing their net worth to the studios, stars began to assert greater power. More and more stars ﬁnished their studio contracts and became independent artists. This trend had begun by the early part of the 1940s (with the likes of Fred Astaire, Claudette Colbert, Ronald Colman, Ginger Rogers, and Barbara Stanwyck working freelance), but the numbers grew dramatically after the war. New income tax laws spurred individuals to “incorporate” themselves, leading a large number of actors and actresses to set up independent production companies. Stars had greater opportunity to become independent due to a landmark case brought by Olivia de Havilland against Warner Bros. in 1943. The courts decided against the conventional Hollywood studio policy of adding the time an actor was on suspension to the end of the contract period (for stars usually set at seven years), which potentially kept an actor in the studio’s control indeﬁnitely. The ruling granted actors the right to refuse roles and to sit out the duration of their contracts (Schatz 206–08). Thus, as the war ended, stars were ﬁnding new power and independence. Independence, though, also meant a lack of protection by the studio against scandal. While valuable contract players could depend upon their studio to help sweep ugly matters under the rug, stars increasingly had to fend for themselves. Headlines about Robert Mitchum’s arrest for possession of marijuana or Ingrid Bergman’s extramarital pregnancy exempliﬁed a newer “no holds barred” era of star coverage in the press. Most devastatingly, stars found themselves easy targets for communist paranoia in the second half of the decade. Many actors and actresses had looked into socialism or other leftist groups during the depths of the Depression; others had made ﬁlms or public comments showing support of Soviet Russia as a wartime ally. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and various civic groups that sprang up after the war to ferret out communist sympathizers quickly jumped on these factors to accuse a number of people\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nOlivia de Havilland’s successful lawsuit against Warner Bros. helped free stars from inordinate studio control over their careers. As an independent artist in the late 1940s, de Havilland won two Oscars as Best Actress for To Each His Own (1946) and The Heiress (1949). Collection of the author.\n\nof working to help the Soviet Union undermine American strength. Some stars (such as Gary Cooper, Robert Taylor, and Ginger Rogers) eagerly testiﬁed about potential communist inﬂuence in the industry. Others (Larry Parks, John Garﬁeld) had their careers destroyed (and sometimes their lives) as a blacklist developed to keep suspects from ﬁnding work.\n\n6\n\nSEAN GRIFFIN\n\nStars, therefore, like Hollywood and America at large, experienced the 1940s as a split decade. Yet a sense of division has been a key concept to star studies in general. Dyer theorizes how star images are “related to contradictions in ideology. . . . The relations may be one of displacement . . . or of the suppression of one half of the contradiction and the foregrounding of the other . . . or else it may be that the star effects a ‘magic’ reconciliation of the apparently incompatible terms” (Stars 30). Barbara Deming, writing about ﬁlms in the 1940s, also stressed that “the heroes and heroines who are most popular at any particular period are precisely those who, with a certain added style, with a certain distinction, act out the predicament in which we all ﬁnd ourselves—a predicament from which the movie-dream then cunningly extricates us” (Deming 2). Many analyses of star images emphasize how performers become stars by somehow embodying (and thus resolving) cultural contradictions. That Deming writes speciﬁcally about the 1940s indicates that the decade was split not just in terms of timeline. Examinations of the decade are often rife with metaphors of ambivalence, divided emotions, and even schizophrenia. Film books about the 1940s stress this duality, often directly in the titles: Deming’s Running Away from Myself or Dana Polan’s Power and Paranoia. Even a book about Hollywood studio design in the 1940s touches on this lack of cohesion, describing a tendency to collapse multiple decorative styles into an overarching mélange of tastes (Madelbaum and Myers 25). That Deming began putting together notes for her book during the time in question shows that considering this period as dislocated was common then, and not just in hindsight. The growing interest in psychoanalysis in 1940s America undoubtedly helped spur thought about split personalities and divided desires. Psychological testing in the military rose during the war, most notoriously in an effort to weed homosexuals out of the service. Many in Hollywood also became enamored with Freudian therapy at this time. Conceptualizing the conﬂict between one’s id and one’s ego led to a consideration of warring tendencies within the cultural landscape of the period—and there were certainly plenty of “incompatible terms” to negotiate. While World War II is often portrayed as uniting everyone together in a shared goal, plenty of internal disagreement still existed. Until the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the country was locked in vibrant debate between isolationists and interventionists, but ﬁghting the war created its own contradictions. Most centrally, the war was being fought to restore liberty for all individuals, but doing so required people to suppress their individualism and work as part of a team (either in the ranks or on the factory line). Championing freedom also led\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nto much propaganda about America as a land of opportunity for all races and religions. Yet the Zoot Suit riots between white sailors and Los Angeles’ Latino population during the war, as well as the number of race riots in cities where factories began integrating their workforce, demonstrated the wealth of prejudice still to be overcome. Women’s place in American society was also very ambiguous. Wartime propaganda promoted female strength and capability at traditionally masculine work, while many other aspects of culture (pulp novels and ﬁlm noir in particular) expressed deep fears about powerful women. Such worries became exacerbated once the culturally enforced unity of wartime ended. Postwar culture became littered with ambivalent antiheroes, and the call for humanist brotherhood after the war was matched by a concomitant growth of existentialist nihilism. Such emotional dislocation was matched by actual physical dislocation. Men were being drafted and sent to military bases and overseas, and large numbers on the home front moved to industrial centers to work in factories. Integration of women and people of color into the workforce also physically redistributed populations. The federal government also forcibly relocated thousands of Japanese Americans into internment camps. With parents away in the service or working in factories, children were often largely unattended (an issue that was of importance during this period, but has largely been overlooked in subsequent histories of the home front). New housing arrangements, and often housing shortages, were widespread during the war. Such mobility continued after the war, albeit in a different fashion, as thousands abandoned the cities for the suburbs (Polan 254). Polan and Deming both note the motif of the “wanderer” in ﬁlms of the period—someone without a home, without direction (see, in particular, Polan 264–71). Home itself becomes a site of ambivalence and duality. While a number of ﬁlms glorify the American home—particularly nostalgic representations of America at the turn of the century—the shadowy apartments and mansions found in noir, gothic romances, and wartime spy thrillers present home as entrapment and danger. Certain ﬁlms encapsulate both emotions, such as Alfred Hitchcock’s Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Vincente Minnelli’s Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), or Frank Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life (1946). For male veterans attempting to adjust to a civilian life that no longer felt comfortable, as well as women feeling constrained by a concerted effort to place them back into the domestic sphere after the war, home was an increasingly complex environment. Stars, therefore, may have provided an anchor for audiences feeling cut adrift from everything they had known before. Certain stars seemed present to address each of the contradictory set of values or emotions listed.\n\n8\n\nSEAN GRIFFIN\n\nBrazilian “bombshell” Carmen Miranda became an iconic ﬁgure of the Good Neighbor Policy, singing and dancing in musicals of the 1940s. While presented as comically outrageous, her stardom celebrated cultural outreach between the United States and nations south of its border. Collection of the author.\n\nSome performers even founded their stardom on divided selves: Danny Kaye constantly played dual roles, and Lon Chaney Jr. was forever typecast as the Wolf Man. The prevalence of star couples also suggests the divided self: Abbott and Costello, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Individual stars such as Carmen Miranda, Sabu, or Lena Horne acknowledged racial and ethnic diversity,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nbut often within a certain comfort zone for white audiences. Others helped negotiate the thorny issue of individualism versus working as a unit. For example, male stars such as John Garﬁeld, James Cagney, and Errol Flynn regularly played self-centered guys learning to be part of a team. Various female stars became prominent by balancing elements of selfassertiveness with conventional female glamour—whether the gumption and gams displayed by Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth, the grace yet grit of Greer Garson, or Jennifer Jones’s ability to be both earthy and innocent (in different proportion depending on the role). Representative of the interest in psychoanalysis, a number of actresses starred as characters with fragmented psyches: Bette Davis in Now, Voyager (1942), Ginger Rogers in Lady in the Dark (1944), Joan Crawford in Possessed (1947), Gene Tierney in Leave Her to Heaven (1947), Olivia de Havilland in The Snake Pit (1948). Female stars such as Veronica Lake, Lana Turner, Lauren Bacall, and Barbara Stanwyck also delved into the duplicitous ﬁgure of the femme fatale common to noir (Renov). The most emblematic stars of the decade, though, were the actors who crafted images of weary souls, cynical about the world but upholding a sense of morality and justice nonetheless. Deming’s analysis of the decade’s ﬁlms reveals the prevalence of disenchanted heroes who take up the war effort, yet often with a semi-suicidal sacriﬁce implicit. She connects these ﬁgures to “tough guys” after the war actively courting the ultimate disinvestment of death. Whether crusading in the cycle of social problem ﬁlms that developed during the postwar period or wading through webs of intrigue in noir thrillers, leading men (John Garﬁeld and James Cagney again, but also Robert Mitchum and Dick Powell, among others) doggedly carried on in their missions, even though they were not certain of victory, or even survival (Naremore; Palmer). Nowhere is this more evident than in the rise to popularity of Humphrey Bogart, whose star image perfectly demonstrates the dualities of the era, and who stands as probably the most iconic star of the entire decade. He and others gave voice to the dis-ease many seemed to feel at the time, yet these stars appeared to hold seemingly opposite aspects together and resolve the tensions, at least for the duration of each performance. In various ways, the stars discussed in this volume negotiated the unstable, ever-shifting terrain of the 1940s and helped audiences do the same. Certain stars are emblematic of the decade. The comic duo of Abbott and Costello, as David Sedman describes, shot to stardom in a series of military farces that helped prepare a still wary American public for entrance into another war. Their slide after the war and rebound toward the end of the\n\n10\n\nSEAN GRIFFIN\n\ndecade by uniting with various iconic horror ﬁgures is an almost perfect mapping of how many stars had to reconﬁgure their careers across this period. Similarly, Hannah Hamad details how Greer Garson became the queen of the MGM lot in the early 1940s, supplanting Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, and Norma Shearer, but then found it difﬁcult to adjust to postwar tastes. The 1940s also saw the rise of the pinup, and Adrienne McLean examines the two most famous ones: Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. McLean shows how the two, in different ways, counterbalanced the overt objectiﬁcation of their bodies with expressions of female independence. While such a balance ﬁt the “Rosie the Riveter” era of the war, it became more problematic afterward. McLean details how Grable began to fade in popularity toward the end of the decade and Hayworth became the source of scandal for asserting what was considered a bit too much independence in her affair with Aly Khan. Robin Blaetz describes how Ingrid Bergman was also punished by Hollywood for her extramarital relationship with Italian director Roberto Rossellini. Having become one of the most respected and in-demand stars of the mid-1940s, Bergman’s story provides a stark picture of how quickly fortunes could change during this era. As mentioned, Humphrey Bogart has become symbolic of 1940s Hollywood, precisely for his ability to straddle categories and attitudes—arguably American cinema’s ﬁrst antihero. Rick Worland describes Bogart’s path from villain in supporting parts to existential romantic ﬁgure. Part of that transition happened through the chemistry the actor found with Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca (1943), and then in his ﬁlms with Lauren Bacall. Worland also examines the rise of Bacall, who developed a female persona that matched Bogart’s sense of strength yet cynicism. Ed Countryman’s chapter on John Wayne suggests many parallels between Wayne and Bogart. While Wayne is often regarded as an uncomplicated icon of American masculinity, Countryman shows how often Wayne played characters who were just as world-weary and emotionally isolated as Bogart in his westerns and war ﬁlms of the 1940s. The personae of singing cowboy stars Gene Autry and Roy Rogers are considered usually in even more simplistic terms than Wayne. Ed Buscombe, though, displays how each, in his own way, mediated between city and county and between tradition and modernity. Charlie Keil’s examination of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant along with David Lugowski’s discussion of Claudette Colbert, Ginger Rogers, and Barbara Stanwyck are reminders that performers who rose to prominence in the 1930s had to negotiate the ever-shifting terrain of the 1940s as well. Both authors describe the personae that had served each of these stars earlier, and then show how those images were altered to maintain popularity\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nboth during the war and afterward. In particular, the female stars in various ways domesticated their images—or played characters punished for their independence and strength. Grant’s image, though, as Keil points out, also felt pressure to become more “ordinary.” The emphasis on stars as not much different than the average Joe or Jane trails through many of the analyses in this volume. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the popularity of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland during the decade. My overview of their careers shows how audiences liked to perceive them as “ordinary Americans” or average teenagers, even though it was plainly obvious how extraordinarily talented they were. That both had troubles balancing that sense of ordinariness and extraordinariness in the latter half of the 1940s matches up with the experiences of many of the other stars investigated herein. In sum, the 1940s were—for the United States, for Hollywood, and for its stars—exhilarating and frightening, ﬁlled with potential and uncertainty: the best of times and the worst of times, but always (as Bogart’s Sam Spade intones at the end of The Maltese Falcon [1941]) what dreams were made of.\n\n1 ★★★★★★★★★★ ✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩ Abbott and Costello Who’s on First? DAVID SEDMAN\n\nUp from the deeps of bedizened burlesque, and toting all the gags mellowed in the memories of that medium and the medicine shows before it, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello have spiraled in two short years and seven quick pictures from nowhere on the screen to the Number One spot among the Money-Making Stars. —William R. Weaver, Motion Picture Herald, 26 December 1942\n\nBud Abbott and Lou Costello were undeniably the most proliﬁc comedic actors of the 1940s. In that single decade the comedians appeared in more than two dozen ﬁlms, as well as performed live on Bud Abbott and Lou Costello portrait, c. 1944. Collection of the author. 12\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO\n\n13\n\nstage, broadcast multiple radio shows, appeared on Broadway, and made numerous fund-raising tours to sell U.S. war bonds. Their slapstick routines and ﬂawless comedic timing captivated audiences and helped catapult them to fame far beyond the burlesque shows in which they began their partnership. In contrast to some Hollywood stars of the era who tried to maintain some degree of privacy in their lives, Abbott and Costello chose the path of all-out publicity to further enhance their reputations. Consistent exposure was the guiding force in building their public image and promoting them as the country’s preeminent comedy team. Publicity experts, as well as the duo’s ﬁlm studios (Universal and MGM) and broadcast networks (NBC and ABC), went to considerable effort to ensure that the public knew what Abbott and Costello were up to personally as well as professionally. Abbott and Costello’s onscreen and offscreen pursuits were covered regularly throughout the 1940s by the major Hollywood columnists, including Hedda Hopper, Wood Soanes, Sheilah Graham, and Jimmy Fidler. The sheer volume of their appearances in ﬁlms and broadcasting led to consistent coverage by fan magazines such as Photoplay, Screenland, Motion Picture, and Movie Story. Beginning in 1948, they even had their own monthly comic book. The pair granted scores of interviews to the press and enjoyed performing for reporters while relating colorful stories about their days on the burlesque circuit prior to hitting it big.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nThe Abbott and Costello Story\n\nBud Abbott was born in 1895 to parents working in the circus. He left school at fourteen to work at Coney Island, which led to jobs in the theater and vaudeville. He married burlesque dancer and comedienne Betty Smith in 1918 and began producing touring shows. By the mid1920s, Abbott had become a highly regarded straight man on the burlesque circuit. Lou Costello was athletic as a youth and excelled in basketball and boxing at school. His athletic skills were put to good use when he was hired as a stuntman in Hollywood in the late 1920s. When that failed to provide a steady income, Costello decided to become a performer in burlesque. Like Abbott, he was also married to a burlesque dancer, Anne Battler. As a result, Abbott and his wife would cross professional paths with Costello and his wife while touring the country. Abbott and Costello worked together for the ﬁrst time in 1935 and became a comedy team in 1936, with Abbott playing the part of the straight man and Costello delivering the punch lines.\n\n14\n\nDAVID SEDMAN\n\nThe comedy pair’s humor was anything but subtle. As Abbott put it, “There are only two types of comedy: there’s the topical such as Jack Benny and Bob Hope do, and there’s the old-fashioned corny comedy from the ‘burley’ houses—and that’s us” (Frank Daugherty, “Comedy as Comedians See It,” Christian Science Monitor, 17 October 1941, 14). Abbott explained that their approach to comedy was based on two-man comic strips such as Mutt and Jeff. From the newspapers came their formula: “Right then an idea was born, why couldn’t we be animated comic strips?” (Hold That Ghost Show Showman’s Manual, 1941). Abbott and Costello’s rise as a team was rather rapid by show-business standards. They secured an agent and manager, Eddie Sherman, and were represented by Sam Weisbord of the William Morris Agency. Within three years of debuting the new formula on the burlesque stage, they received their ﬁrst national exposure on radio’s “Kate Smith Hour” as guest performers in 1938. Their popularity grew, and they continued on as “Smith Hour” regulars for the next two years. This led to roles in a 1939 Broadway musical, The Streets of Paris, for which they received rave reviews. Hollywood scouts soon recognized their stage presence and visual humor, and the bid was made. In 1940, Universal Pictures signed the comedy team for the musical One Night in the Tropics (1940), designed primarily as a showcase for its star, Allan Jones. Abbott and Costello would be supporting characters and, supposedly, perform one comedy bit. The duo’s ﬁrst ﬁlmed scene was what was to become their signature skit, “Who’s on First?”—the baseball-themed routine that had captivated audiences on the burlesque circuit. The news from the set was that Abbott and Costello’s comic timing was so stellar that they might be headliners on ﬁlm and certainly deserved more exposure in Tropics. Universal was conﬁdent enough in the duo’s appeal that it directed its newsreel division to highlight them in coverage of the ﬁlm’s world premiere in July 1940. The studio moved the scheduled October opening of One Night in the Tropics from New Orleans to Lou Costello’s hometown of Paterson, New Jersey, where Costello was performing a beneﬁt to help raise funds for his church. Universal took no rental fees for the opening, and the publicity continued with the town declaring it “Costello Day” as its native son broke ground on the site of the new Saint Anthony’s Church. The Abbott and Costello publicity effort would continue unbridled throughout the decade. Their success encapsulated the American dream, a storyline that would only escalate thanks to the star-making publicity machinery of 1940s Hollywood.\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\n15\n\nEarly Publicity in Hollywood “Publicity,” Lou Costello said. “We’re always reading things we didn’t do.” —Frederick James Smith, This Week Magazine, 28 September 1941\n\nIn the late 1930s, Abbott and Costello gave the impression that their earliest professional meetings occurred in 1929. They told of their struggles together until being discovered in 1938. The team reportedly could make as much as $100 a week during the 1930s (Frank S. Nugent, “Loco Boys Make Good,” New York Times Magazine, 24 August 1941, 112). In the embellished story, the comedy duo met their spouses simultaneously at an unspeciﬁed performance after separating the dancers during a “backstage squabble” (Dee Lowrance, “Hollywood Finds a New Team,” Washington Post, 1 June 1941, L1). In a nationally syndicated column, Dale Harrison’s “New York,” Costello punctuated the story by saying that the newfound female acquaintances were plied with the invitation, “Let us all go forth to a lunch wagon and partake of some rare delicacies—hamburgers with onions, let us say” (Reno Evening Gazette, 12 July 1939, 4). From there, Costello said it was true love and both were married. While this account was not quite accurate in its timeline, the populist storyline would play well to an America that had suffered through the Depression years. For Universal Studios, having signed the duo to star in two low-budget B-comedies following One Night at the Tropics, the rags-to-riches theme was too good to pass up. Universal’s publicity was based upon the theme that the team began its professional alliance in 1930, with success following many years of ﬁnancial deprivation. The studio’s bio, sent out to both the press and fans, began, “Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in 1940 celebrated their tenth year as partners and their second year as partners with money in the bank” (Abbott and Costello–Biography, News Release, 1940–1942). Articles in the press that echoed the Universal bio were commonplace in the early 1940s. Wood Soanes, in his nationally syndicated column, wrote that the comic pair “had been turned away from the studios and been kicked around generally” (“Curtain Calls: Miracle of Abbott, Costello Told,” Oakland Tribune, 25 August 1941, 14). Movie Album wrote, “The death of vaudeville hit the boys hard, and they were playing for peanuts” prior to getting into movies (“Fun for Your Money,” 1941, 30). In the pages of the Movie-Radio Guide, Abbott and Costello’s struggles were said to have occurred after the “1929 era,” where “for seven years they kicked about ‘small time’ and offered their act for free to passers-by in Times Square.” The publication awarded the duo its “Stars of the Year” award because “never has there been such an\n\n16\n\nDAVID SEDMAN\n\nutter phenomenon as the team of Abbott and Costello” (“Stars of the Year: Abbott and Costello,” 12–18 July 1941, 8). The comedy team’s leap from obscurity to stardom is generally told in fan magazines and newspapers as that “one big break” where “dame fortune smiled upon” them. One could easily point to the team hooking up with manager Eddie Sherman and getting William Morris representation from Sam Weisbord as their biggest breaks. Television producer and director Bob Banner, who directed the TV biopic Bud and Lou (1978) and also once worked with the boys in live television, said that “Sherman ran their lives” and was responsible for virtually all their professional dealings (personal interview, 14 June 2007). Of Weisbord, Norman Brokaw, the founder and chairman of William Morris, said, “We get the talent in the right venues; that’s what we do and that’s what Sam could do” (personal interview, 15 June 2007). The notion of a singular big break is a moving target because the story as told by Abbott and Costello themselves incorporates several “one big break” themes. One story the pair liked to tell was that Jesse Kay of the Roxy Theatre gave them their biggest break by moving them out of small-time appearances and to a much bigger presence on the stage of the Roxy. Another of their oft-told stories is that Harry Kaufman gave them their break by putting them in the Broadway version of The Streets of Paris, which legitimized their stature beyond the burlesque circuit. Another undeniable big break was that Ted Smith, Kate Smith’s manager, saw the pair live and was convinced by Weisbord and Sherman to feature them as guests on “The Kate Smith Hour.” The guest spot proved so successful that it turned into nearly a hundred consecutive guest spots on Smith’s show. And again, another big break came when producer Jules Levey wanted them for a supporting role in Universal’s One Night at the Tropics. Despite the fact that the team’s success revolved around a series of major breaks that occurred in a timeframe between roughly 1937 and 1941, Abbott and Costello would generally concentrate their success on one big break as opposed to a series of breaks, apparently to make the storyline more approachable to their readers. That big break varied from interview to interview. Yet one of the lesser-told storylines of their fame in Hollywood was their pairing with producer Alex Gottlieb in 1940 for their ﬁrst starring role in Universal’s Buck Privates (1941). Although rarely focused on publicly, it would be a milestone in the team’s professional history. Gottlieb was a reporter who became a publicity director in live theater in the 1930s and moved on to publicity and advertising jobs in the ﬁlm industry, after which he began writing for both radio and ﬁlm. With this diverse back-\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO\n\n17\n\nground, Universal hired him as a producer for Buck Privates. Much like RKO’s Wheeler and Woolsey and Fox’s Ritz Brothers ﬁlms made in the 1930s, Gottlieb said his goal was made clear by the head of Universal with the Abbott and Costello comedies: “Do anything you want with them, just make the pictures and don’t spend too much money” (Furmanek and Palumbo 43). Gottlieb’s frugality and efﬁciency was embodied on the set. Moreover, it led to a large proﬁt potential and a model for virtually every Universal Abbott and Costello ﬁlm to follow. The formula was rather straightforward: shoot the project quickly while allowing the comedy team to fulﬁll its radio commitments and live touring schedules. The key was to get as much in one take as possible. This method only worked because Abbott and Costello frowned upon multiple takes and eschewed most rehearsals. Their enormous talent for performing comedy bits ﬂawlessly on the burlesque stage translated well to the medium of ﬁlm where they could perform their scenes in a time-efﬁcient manner. While most ﬁlms of the period would take several months to shoot prior to their post-production editing, Buck Privates was shot in about twenty shooting days covering four weeks, including a break at Christmas. Within three weeks of wrapping its shooting schedule, the ﬁlm was edited, given its premiere, and released as a Bpicture which, like any such B-ﬁlm, was designed to play with A-ﬁlms as the lower half of a double bill. Buck Privates is fairly typical of most of Abbott and Costello’s ﬁlms in which they work in comedy bits from their live act. The boys play Slicker Smith and Herbie Brown, tie salesmen struggling to make ends meet, either looking for a better job opportunity or becoming entangled in some comical scenario not of their own making. Peddling their wares from the street with no small amount of hucksterism, Slicker and Herbie also must stay one step ahead of the police. One fateful day, the boys elude the police by entering a movie theater. While there, they sign up for what they think is a drawing for a prize, only to ﬁnd out that the theater has become an army recruiting center and that they have unwittingly volunteered for the army. This turn of events allows Abbott and Costello to perform a comedy routine from their stage act known as “The Drill,” in which the boys deliver a staggering array of jokes and sight gags. As straight man, Abbott’s Slicker barks out “Order arms,” to which Costello’s Herbie responds with “I’ll have a cap gun.” This basic formula would repeat itself throughout much of the Abbott and Costello oeuvre of the 1940s. In their ﬁrst starring ﬁlm roles, Abbott and Costello delighted audiences. Gottlieb and company had delivered in a big way, as Buck Privates would become Universal’s biggest grossing ﬁlm in 1941, taking in $4 million at the\n\n18\n\nDAVID SEDMAN\n\nbox ofﬁce (which was more than the year’s most talked-about ﬁlm, Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane). Reviews were stellar. Variety noted that the ﬁlm “has a good chance to skyrocket the former burlesk and radio team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello into topﬂight starring ranks” (5 February 1941, 12). There was a word of caution in the Dallas Morning News review, however: “Unless they are badly messed up by corny handling, they will take a place among movie greats” (John Rosenfeld, “Ladeez and Gen’mun, Abbott and Costello,” 6 April 1941, 6:1). The concern voiced by the Dallas critic and a number of others centered on the longevity of comedy teams in general. In the 1930s, teams such as Wheeler and Woolsey and Olsen and Johnson had simply run out of good quality scripts. As a result, the shelf life of comedy teams in Hollywood tended to be rather short. The publicity savvy of Gottlieb came to the fore, however: he declared that he had writers working on some ninety-two stories that would keep Bud and Lou busy until the year 1983. The success of Abbott and Costello’s ﬁrst ﬁlm was a pleasant surprise and, at the same time, a missed opportunity for Universal. Because Buck Privates was released as a B-ﬁlm, the lion’s share of the proﬁts went not to the studio but to the movie theater exhibitors. It was something of an embarrassment that a ﬁlm the studio had pegged as a B-ﬁlm outgrossed all of the more prestigious ﬁlms that it had released as A-pictures. Universal quickly realized the ﬁnancial error it had made and sold the team’s second starring ﬁlm, In the Navy (1941), as an A-picture.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nGiving the Public What It Wants Sure we know it’s low comedy that we do, but that’s apparently just what the public wants. . . . 100,000,000 Americans can’t be wrong. —Lou Costello, qtd. in Hold That Ghost Showman’s Manual, 1941, 1\n\nIn the two-year period 1941–1942, Abbott and Costello starred in a staggering eight feature ﬁlms. They ﬁlmed ﬁve to six days a week, and, on Sundays, they were also regular performers on “The Chase and Sanborn Hour” radio show starring the venerable ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummy Charlie McCarthy. This was said to be by design, as Universal publicity noted that Bud and Lou “have a dread of inactivity, real or anticipated. When a variety man is not busy, he is out of work and out of pocket. In a decade of vaudeville, night club engagements, tent shows, tabloid tours, and revue assignments, Abbott and Costello were never at liberty” (Who Done It? Showman’s Manual, 1942, 2). Scripts for the comedy team were prepared while one ﬁlm was in release and another was being\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO\n\n19\n\nAbbott and Costello’s humor was anything but subtle; here the pair yuck it up for publicity shots on the set of Keep ’Em Flying (1941), one of four service comedies made by the team during the 1940s. Copyright 1941, Universal Pictures, Inc.\n\nshot. As Costello said, “If you don’t have a good picture ready to show right now, you’re a dead duck” (Don Reeve, “Rumors on Set of Killers,” Universal Studios News Release, 1 March 1949, 1). Three of their eight ﬁlms, Buck Privates, In the Navy, and Keep ’Em Flying (1941), were service comedies that played well as America entered World War II. In her nationally syndicated column, Hedda Hopper called Abbott and Costello “the ﬁrst cinematic heroes of the present war” (“Balmy\n\n20\n\nDAVID SEDMAN\n\nBiographies!,” Washington Post, 17 June 1942, 14). Some articles attributed the success of these service comedies as the team’s sole reason for becoming breakout ﬁlm stars. “Loyal Americans and excellent citizens, Bud and Lou hate and despise Hitler, but had it not been for him and that atmosphere,” a 1942 Liberty magazine cover story noted, “Abbott and Costello would probably still be playing some four-a-day grinder” (Frederick VanRyn, “Abbott, Costello, and Hitler,” 23 May 1942, 21). Twice in 1942, Abbott and Costello would prove their loyalty by engaging in cross-country tours raising money for the war effort. Following Pardon My Sarong (1942), the team decided to tour to buy a bomber to knock out Hitler. Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson suggested that the tour be revised to raise money for the Army Emergency Relief Fund. The comedy team’s connection to the public was never made clearer than when they had no problem raising their targeted goal of $500,000. After shooting Who Done It? (1942), Abbott and Costello toured seventy-eight cities in thirty-four days and raised a staggering $85 million for war bonds and stamps (It Ain’t Hay Showman’s Manual, 1943, 3). The combination of radio, burlesque tours, war bond tours, populist marketing, and approachable humor led the public to feel extremely close to the comedy duo. Children, in particular, had no reservations about approaching them for special requests. One such example occurred on their cross-country tour. On a stop in Omaha, a twelve-year-old named Jerry Young sneaked into their hotel and offered Abbott and Costello seventy cents to perform at a beneﬁt being held in the child’s backyard. After an appearance in nearby Lincoln, the comedy team honored their commitment to the youth, helping him raise some eighty dollars. The exploits of Costello, Abbott, and Young made national headlines and their show was even captured in an issue of True Comics (“Jerry Young Presents Abbott and Costello,” December 1942, 52–53). On another stop, some boys requested a cheering-up gift to a local orphanage, and Costello soon sent a case of gum to the children there. For Universal, the embedding of its star comics in public service announcements and newsreels, as well as promoting the boys’ great service to the country on their fund-raising tours, was pure gold. In a report of its own war effort carried in the Film Daily Yearbook of 1943, Universal explained how the studio worked closely with the Navy and War Departments on two Abbott and Costello service comedies. The publicity department’s copy was well rooted in patriotism: “Long before Pearl Harbor, Universal pictures went on alert. Buck Privates starring that indefatigable pair, Abbott and Costello, broke the ice for a steady ﬂow of productions keyed to the war effort before and since that fateful December 7” (Alicoate 232).\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO\n\n21\n\nIn 1942, the comedy pair toured seventy-eight cities in just over a month and raised $85 million for the war effort; this photo taken by a fan in the crowd of an event in September 1942 demonstrates the magnitude of the event. Collection of the author.\n\nIn the years 1941 through 1944, Abbott and Costello placed in the Top Ten of the annual Motion Picture Herald Exhibitor Poll each year, including a ﬁrst-place ﬁnish in 1942. The New York Times called them the “best and most promising clowns to hit the screen in ten years” (“Low Comedy of a High Order,” 15 June 1941, X3). In an article explaining why Abbott and Costello were “slap happy,” the pair felt their stock had risen to the point that they valued their gags—which they willed to their sons, Bud Jr. and Lou Jr.—at $100,000,000 (Movie Life Yearbook, “Why Abbott and Costello are Slap Happy,” 1943, 92). But despite their number one status at the box ofﬁce, their incredible good will from the American public, and their continued presence in live shows, radio broadcasts, and ﬁlms, trouble was just under the surface. The quickly produced ﬁlms that were once seen as box ofﬁce security were becoming too similar. These ﬁlms, which had thin premises even by Abbott and Costello standards, began receiving fewer positive reviews. For Universal, the ﬁlms were proﬁtable and allowed the studio to ﬁnance more prestigious ﬁlms during a period in which it was trying to recast itself as a serious movie studio. But Abbott and Costello did not sit back quietly and let this happen; they began to use the press to complain about the ongoing ﬁlm production system of the 1940s. This led to favorable press coverage in\n\n22\n\nDAVID SEDMAN\n\ntheir support. An example can be found in a 1942 issue of the fan magazine Hollywood: When Hollywood wants to get rid of a player, it uses its own peculiar process that works like slow poison. Poor stories, typed roles, unsympathetic parts, too much publicity. . . . Right now, the most ﬂagrant case of killing players is going on with Abbott and Costello. They’re new in Hollywood. They don’t know how the subtle, slow killing works. They’re being shoved into one picture after another. . . . Every critic in the country is crying out against the treatment they’re receiving. But they’re a couple of geese who are laying golden eggs. Yet, their studio insists upon feeding them material that is better suited for the scrap heap. “They’re giving us ﬁve dollar stories,” they complain bitterly, “but what can we do about it?” (Gene Schrott, “How Hollywood Kills Its Stars,” July 1942, 25)\n\nUniversal was aware of the concerns and countered such articles in the publicity material it sent to motion picture exhibitors. In the 1942 showman’s manual for Who Done It? the studio highlighted the fact that it was the boys’ ninth comedy in two years. It commented, “All this talk about the boys making too many pictures and thereby recklessly spending their box ofﬁce value seems to be just that—talk.” Despite the publicity effort and the ﬁnancial success of each Abbott and Costello ﬁlm, many reviewers directed their critical barbs not at the actors but toward the ﬁlm studio for the shortcomings that were apparent in the ﬁlms. A New York Times review of the comedy team’s ﬁlm In Society (1944) demonstrates the focus of the problem for Universal: Probably no other comedy team in pictures has been so sincerely and enthusiastically supported by screen observers and critics generally. Whatever criticisms have been leveled, they have been pointed, not at the comedians, but at their vehicles. This almost universal loyalty from the press springs from the personal warmth of the comedians themselves plus a deep faith, on the parts of most critics, in the real comedy potentialities of the two men. Thus we ﬁnd a team generally accredited with having all the qualiﬁcations of a longenduring comedy and money-earning combination being bled white, so to speak, in pieces beneath their abilities. . . . In Society will undoubtedly make money for the studio, too. But what will they do for Abbott and Costello? That’s the thought for today. (Paul P. Kennedy, “Abbott-Costello, Inc.,” 24 August 1944, X1)\n\nMany Hollywood columnists credited Deanna Durbin and Abbott and Costello with saving Universal Studios from ﬁnancial ruin. But, by the end of the war, even Universal had to rethink its handling of its top-drawing stars, as its comedy team would drop off the list of the top ten money-making stars for three consecutive years, 1945 through 1947. In the marketing of\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO\n\n23\n\ncomedy teams, Hollywood had found it difﬁcult to resurrect a comedy team’s act once it began to fade at the box ofﬁce. As such, Universal had a challenge ahead of it.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nRefreshing the Act\n\nAlthough enormous proﬁts continued to be derived from each Abbott and Costello ﬁlm, problems began to exist for Universal in the marketing of the duo. Universal had built an image based upon a couple of regular Joes who had struggled together since the beginning of the Depression and who were enormously patriotic during World War II. But once both the war and the Depression had ended, the studio had to face the fact that what it had was a very rich but aging property. Critics complained about the studio’s handling of its stars, but if there were any question about the comedy team being well compensated for its endeavors, a Treasury Department report put an end to it. For the 1943 tax year, the Treasury Department listed Abbott and Costello as the fourth-highest earners in the country, at $424,320 (“Film Magnate Again Tops U.S. Personal Income List,” Dallas Morning News, 13 December 1945, 6). (Abbott and Costello had the distinction of being the only unrelated taxpayers in the country considered as a pair.) The next year, the Treasury Department listed them as the highest salary earners of 1944 with $469,170, just ahead of the combined salaries of Universal’s chairman of the board J. Cheever Cowdin and Universal executive producer N. J. Blumberg (“Abbott, Costello Top Big Pay List,” New York Times, 7 January 1947, 27). To combat the potential for the public viewing its underdogs, the “Mutt and Jeff” comedy duo, as getting too big for its britches, Universal publicity sent out a press release that explained how Abbott and Costello spent their money. Said Abbott and Costello: Well, we give each of us $234,535. Then each one of us gives Uncle Sam $175,000. Then we toss most of the remainder into the foundation. Then we spend a little bit on our families, and, if there’s any left over, we go out and buy a new shirt or a pair of socks. . . . Just shows what success can do for a couple of guys—it makes paupers out of them! (qtd. in Don Reeve, Buck Privates Come Home, Universal Studios News Release, 16 February 1947, 1)\n\nThe publicity material added that Bud and Lou were known as “soft touches for any worthy cause.” When they heard of a child who needed life-saving surgery, they paid all expenses, “all of this without the beneﬁt of publicity,” according to a Universal press release (Reeve, Buck Privates\n\n24\n\nDAVID SEDMAN\n\nAbbott and Costello were recognized as among Hollywood’s most generous stars; here they pose with Father Bernard Hubbard (a.k.a. the “Glacier priest”) as Bud and Lou reportedly give up their personal 16 mm ﬁlm library and projectors for the sake of America’s “entertainment starved troops” in the Aleutians. Collection of the author.\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO\n\n25\n\nCome Home, 1). In another instance, an Oklahoman in need of an iron lung was sent the medical item, and Bud and Lou paid all related costs. The comedians helped acquire a “new wonder drug” known as penicillin to save the life of a two-year-old (“Ethel Powell Gives Rare Drug to Boy,” Case Grande Dispatch, 24 September 1948, 8). Even Abbott’s own restaurant, The Stagedoor, was a haven for people who needed a meal or a job. Said to lose about $50,000 per year, the restaurant, Abbott claimed, was purchased and operated to help those in need. “For years,” he said, “I walked the sidewalks without the price of beer in my pocket. I ﬁnally made enough money to buy a place” where he and some selected patrons who were less fortunate could “receive a free meal” (Don Reeve, “Bud Offered $75k for His Restaurant,” Universal Studios News Release, 23 February 1949, 1). Abbott said he would put old-time friends who found themselves out of work on his payroll as assistant managers at his restaurant. This theme of helping out the less fortunate extended to the movie sets, according to Lou’s daughter Chris. She explained that it was not uncommon for Costello to “support the underdog” and provide accommodations for cast and crew that the studio would not fund. In one instance, Costello used his own money to buy airconditioned trailers for co-stars because Universal would only provide ﬂimsy tents (personal interview with Chris Costello, 21 May 2007). One reason that Abbott and Costello earned as much as they did was because of their grueling schedule, which included their weekly radio show, ﬁlms, endorsements for products ranging from antacids to car batteries, and personal appearances. The sheer amount of time spent together took a physical and mental toll on both. Lou Costello was diagnosed with rheumatic fever that took him out of work for parts of 1943 and 1944. Further bad news came in 1944 when Costello’s infant son, Butch, drowned in the family swimming pool. Even though Costello, in show business tradition, continued with his professional duties the night after learning of Butch’s death, the event obviously changed Costello forever. He would create a foundation devoted to building a youth center in Los Angeles for underprivileged children. The team faced further unfortunate events at this time. Alex Gottlieb, who had produced eight of the team’s comedies, left Universal for Warner Bros., and his understanding of how to handle the team was to be sorely missed. Each of the next three Abbott and Costello ﬁlms—In Society (1944), Lost in a Harem (1944), and Here Come the Co-eds (1945)—would have different producers, each with only middling success. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., some criticism was leveled at the nature of the war bond sales effort. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau criticized a press release from\n\n26\n\nDAVID SEDMAN\n\nUniversal’s publicity department lauding Abbott and Costello’s war bond efforts. Morgenthau said that entertainers should not exploit bond sales for personal publicity. He commented, “I have been watching this sort of thing and will check it still more closely” (“Scores Publicity for Bond Sellers,” New York Times, 16 July 1942, 11). Finally, in 1945, rumors of a split between Abbott and Costello were becoming rampant. A national column by Elizabeth Poston suggested that the team was ﬁnished. In the article, Costello said there was no reconciling his differences with Abbott: “I’ve tried to keep the team together, but Abbott and his advisors have been hitting me time and again below the belt” (“Funny Man Lou Costello Bares an Old Feud with Bud Abbott,” The Oklahoman, 22 July 1945, 9). Other gossip columns echoed that the split was either imminent or had already taken place. One of the earliest internal memos at Universal dealing with such concerns suggested changing the duo’s bio to say that their initial performance together occurred in 1936 rather than in 1930. In a January 1947 memo, publicity chief Maurice Bergman wondered if the studio were to alter their timeline up and accordingly promote the team’s tenth anniversary that “we might freshen the boys up a bit,” especially if “it is a fact.” Indeed, Universal moved up the anniversary, and their future communications cited 1936 as the year the team ﬁrst appeared in vaudeville acts together, at a Chicago theater. As a result, Abbott and Costello had two twelfth anniversaries, one cited in the publicity materials for Rio Rita (1941) (Rio Rita Showman’s Manual, 1941, 4) and another in a Universal press release picked up by a number of newspapers (Don Reeve, “Bud and Lou Celebrate Their 12th Anniversary,” Universal Studios News Release, 27 September 1948, 1). Many articles in the early 1940s referenced the boys’ propensity for playing rummy on the set with each other. This masked the reality that they were well known among insiders as big-time gamblers in poker and horse racing. As a result, they became involved with non-Hollywood businessmen, which in one case led to a legal battle. The team was subpoenaed and forced to testify in a trial involving a nightclub owner and poker acquaintance to whom the comedians had paid $85,000 in a four-year stretch (“Abbott and Costello Subpoenaed,” New York Times, 21 March 1947, 28). This not only was their ﬁrst widely reported negative publicity but also the ﬁrst indication of their ﬁnancial liabilities. The ﬁnancial woes would mount by decade’s end to the point that Costello faced tax liens from the Internal Revenue Service (“Costello, Flynn Faced by Income Tax Liens,” Cedar Rapids Times, 21 September 1949, 18) and Abbott was forced into bankruptcy during the 1950s. Universal’s publicity department was also concerned about\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO\n\n27\n\nthe impact the gambling-related trial might have on its stars. At the time of the trial, it issued a press release: “Costello has never taken an alcoholic drink nor a smoke, they gambled for money just once in ﬁlms but then didn’t hold their winnings. Neither has knowingly broken a law.” In an almost hopeful tone, the release continued, “Few other fun-maker pairs have held on to box ofﬁce potency through as many pictures as Abbott and Costello. . . . Bob Hope and Bing Crosby are still going strong but have not approached Abbott and Costello’s 20 vehicles” (Harry Friedman, Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap, 6 June 1947, 1). The most aggressive publicity campaign was associated with the Lou Costello Jr. Youth Foundation. The actors personally funded $400,000 for a community space for underprivileged children in Los Angeles, which opened its doors in 1947. Costello also produced a ﬁlm short, 10,000 Kids and a Cop (1948), that would be shown in movie theaters across the United States to spotlight the project. Columnist Jimmie Fidler wrote that despite the fact that the pair would never win Academy Awards, they should receive “an even more enviable award. They’re neither child psychologists, ‘welfare workers’ nor reformers—just good Americans who saw a job to do and did it” (“Costello’s Charity Going Strong,” The Oklahoman, 22 May 1947, 11). In another column, Fidler noted that they “deserve an extra deep bow” for donating all proceeds from one of their ﬁlms to the foundation, and appealed to other stars to donate to the cause. “I want to wonder a bit about the apathy of other in-the-money stars who seem strangely disinterested in the magniﬁcent job that these two comics are doing” (“There Oughta Be a Law,” The Oklahoman, 11 November 1947, 13). In hoping to refresh the act, Universal also heeded advice from its stars and from the industry and raised the bar on the ﬁrst two postwar Abbott and Costello ﬁlms, Little Giant (1946) and The Time of Their Lives (1946). A top-rated director, William A. Seiter, was brought in to direct Little Giant, working from a script that downplayed gags and slapstick. In the publicity material for the ﬁlm, Seiter said that “an artist must grow or fall into a decline. And since there seemed no further room for improvement in the established technique of Abbott and Costello, it followed a new prescription was indicated” (Little Giant Showman’s Manual, 1946, 5). Both ﬁlms broke the established formula of Bud as straight man, Lou as funnyman, and scenes built around comedy bits from the team’s stage act. The Time of Their Lives best reﬂects the new approach, featuring Costello as Horatio, an eighteenth-century tinker hoping to marry a housemaid. His rival is Abbott’s character, a butler named Cuthbert. Horatio and the housemaid’s mistress are mistaken for traitors and shot to death by the army. The\n\n28\n\nDAVID SEDMAN\n\nstory moves to the twentieth century where the ghosts of Horatio and his ﬁancée’s mistress are trying to clear their names. Abbott, in a dual role, portrays a psychiatrist who is a descendant of Cuthbert. What makes this ﬁlm different is that Abbott and Costello’s characters share dialogue in just one scene early in the ﬁlm. Not one Abbott and Costello routine from their live act is included in the ﬁlm. Abbott would get a chance to play a comic character instead of the usual straight man. Further, the production costs for The Time of Their Lives were the highest yet for an Abbott and Costello picture. The studio brought in director Charles T. Barton, who would direct the team in its next eight features. The Hollywood Reporter wrote of The Time of Their Lives, “Something new is being offered by Abbott and Costello. . . . Long specialists in the borrowed and the blue, Bud and Lou had their ﬁrst whirl at situation comedy in Little Giant, and they came out so well that Universal really throws the book at them. . . . By long odds, it is the best A&C show to date” (16 August 1946). Universal International (Universal having merged with International Pictures in 1946) tried to upgrade Abbott and Costello pictures much as they were trying to move up into the upper echelon of ﬁlm studios. In a press release, Universal International Pictures noted, “This is part of the studio’s plan to stress that Abbott and Costello are now playing characters in well-formulated stories, rather than in loosely contrived farces” (Universal Studios News Release, 4 June 1947, 1). When the box ofﬁce results did not pay off, the comedy team went back to familiar turf, doing a sequel to Buck Privates entitled Buck Privates Come Home (1947). The boys reprised their roles from the earlier ﬁlm, now having returned from their tour of duty in World War II. Playing familiar characters allowed the comedy team to return to the straight man and funnyman formula associated with their earlier, more successful ﬁlms. Their follow-up ﬁlm, The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap (1947), also found the team returning to their familiar formula, as Bud and Lou played Duke Egan and Chester Wooley, traveling salesmen who are wrongfully charged with murder in a ﬁnancially strapped Montana town. The scenario has many comic scenes, including a revised routine from one of their earlier movies. By ﬁlm’s end, not only are Duke and Chester cleared of the charge, but Duke’s claim that the town would be saved ﬁnancially if the local judge married the “wistful widow” turns out to be true. Audiences welcomed the familiarity of Buck Privates Come Home and the Wistful Widow judging by their success at the box ofﬁce. This return to form for Abbott and Costello led the studio to sign a new deal with the team that would call for two low-budget ﬁlms per year.\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO\n\n29\n\nCostello exploited columnist Sheilah Graham in helping to secure yet another new contract with Universal International. “Lou Costello had coffee with me at the U.I. Café and sprung the bombshell that directly [after] he ﬁnishes his current Mexican Hayride [1948] he’ll stage another ﬁght to pry himself loose from the studio. Lou says he’s not getting enough money” (“Hollywood in Person,” Dallas Morning News, 2 July 1948, 17). Clearly, Graham felt burned in a subsequent column pertaining to UI’s new contract with the comedy team. She wrote, “If Lou Costello ever complains again, I’ll have no sympathy for him! His new percentage deal, based on returns of recent pictures, will give him and partner Bud Abbott $1,000,000 for two pictures—which makes them top earners in Hollywood” (“Hollywood: Good Deal for Abbott and Costello,” Dallas Morning News, 26 May 1949, 4).\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nAbbott and Costello Meet Profits at Decade’s End\n\nThe formula for the Abbott and Costello ﬁlms in the late 1940s was straightforward: keep the productions cheap, produce them quickly, and hold advertising costs low. Abbott and Costello would receive bonuses for ﬁlms that came in under budget. UI treated its Abbott and Costello ﬁlms like a property akin to a B-series and, as a result, the advertising and marketing budgets were minuscule, often one-tenth the amount of other comedy ﬁlms. The advertising agency that handled many of Abbott and Costello’s ﬁlms wrote a memo in 1947 to the head of UI, William Goetz, which pleaded, “Could you possibly use your inﬂuence to get Abbott and Costello to start mentioning on their radio program . . . their forthcoming picture Buck Privates Come Home . . . in view of the fact we have no national advertising on this picture . . . most of this success is in their hands” (19 February 1947, 1). The studio’s reliance on the Abbott and Costello series to maximize proﬁts is also seen in its use of the team-up concept in which the duo was paired with some other property owned by the studio. Universal utilized the characters associated with its successful horror series of the 1930s and 1940s to create new genre-bending ﬁlms. For example, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) was one of UI’s highest earning ﬁlms of the year. The ﬁlm starred Bud and Lou as Chick Young and Wilbur Gray, well intentioned but bumbling railroad baggage clerks. Two crates headed for MacDougal’s House of Horrors that contain the remains of Frankenstein and Dracula are mishandled by the clerks. The clerks are then forced to go to the House of Horrors where a mixture of comedy and thrills await them,\n\n30\n\nDAVID SEDMAN\n\nincluding meeting up with the Universal Studios monsters Frankenstein, Dracula, and The Wolf Man. The ﬁnancial success of Meet Frankenstein paved the way for Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff (1949), Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951), and Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1953). With a proﬁt and speed mentality combined with fairly predictable storylines, UI had virtually ensured that Abbott and Costello would earn neither an Oscar nomination for their work at the studio nor the critical attention Universal International had contemplated for the pair just a few years earlier. But what it did ﬁnd was a business plan for ﬁnancial success at a time when studios were beginning to worry about the impact of television on their proﬁts. The studio would replicate its production model with the highly proﬁtable “Ma and Pa Kettle” and “Francis the Talking Mule” ﬁlms in which the characters’ names were also placed in the title to sell the ﬁlms to theaters and audiences alike. Abbott and Costello’s resurgence at the box ofﬁce was demonstrated in their return to the top ten, according to the Exhibitors Poll; they ﬁnished third in both 1948 and 1949. These were the team’s ﬁrst top ten appearances since 1944. In terms of their standing in the community, Abbott and Costello were viewed as two of Hollywood’s “Ten Best Citizens” according to Modern Screen magazine. The Lou Costello Jr. Youth Foundation helped lead to a 40 percent decrease in juvenile delinquency on Los Angeles’s east side (“Hollywood’s Ten Best Citizens,” February 1950, 73). From the theater owner’s standpoint, a Life feature crowned the comedy duo as the champs at the concession stands. “Their comedies sell more popcorn than anyone,” said one theater owner (“Popcorn Bonanza,” 25 July 1949, 41). This fact was not lost on UI, which decided to use the item in their trade advertisement for one of their features (David Lipton, memo to Hank Linet, 25 July 1949, 1). Though shooting twenty-ﬁve feature ﬁlms in the 1940s, not one Abbott and Costello movie during this period was shot in color. The decade opened with Deanna Durbin and Abbott and Costello keeping the lights on at Universal Studios and, by decade’s end, Hedda Hopper noting that ﬁlms such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein made “everyone at Universal-International happy because the Abbott and Costello pictures plus Ma and Pa Kettle pay the salaries” (“$4.5 million for A&C Meet Frankenstein,” Pittsburgh Press, 25 January 1949, 17). While critics still complained about Universal’s treatment of the decade’s busiest and most bankable stars, director Charles Barton held a different view. He explained that a number of radio comics had tried to make the transition into ﬁlms but not all succeeded. “Who made\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO\n\n31\n\nBud and Lou?” Barton asked. “It was the studio in back of them that said we’ll gamble on them” (Furmanek and Palumbo 32). Despite the smiles within the studio’s accounting ofﬁce, rumors of Abbott and Costello’s breakup were still active at the end of the decade. In Harold Swisher’s United Press Radio Feature, “In Movieland,” Abbott said, “I hear the rumor is out again that Lou and I are breaking up. Please help us deny it. We’ve been together 13 years day and night. We’ll continue to be a team for many years to come. Sure we have squabbles. What partners don’t?” (18 July 1949, 1). There was a need to quash such rumors; UI itself may have contributed to the problem by suspending the duo just before the end of 1949. The studio said it was “just a technicality” so that Universal would not have to pay the stars’ $6,500 weekly salary while Costello recovered from a prolonged illness (“Costello Illness Cited in Suspension of Duo,” Cedar Rapids Times, 22 December 1949, 3). Despite the suspension, Abbott and Costello were poised to start the 1950s in strong form with projects already lined up. The boys had signed to do their ﬁrst European comedy tour, rumors abounded that the pair was being courted to do television, their radio series continued, and there seemed to be no end in sight for the Abbott and Costello ﬁlms. Press agent Joe Glaston and the boys believed that his clients’ biggest moneymaking ﬁlm would be Abbott and Costello Meet Hopalong Cassidy if the money could be raised for the production (Cedar Rapids Gazette, 1 September 1949, 24). UI addressed the breakup rumors head-on with a press release suggesting that the two had a lifetime contract that prohibited either from appearing without the other. The contract would run for as long as the two were physically able to continue their careers together. “I have a copy in my safe at home,” Abbott said, “and Lou has a copy in his safe” (Reeve, “Rumors on Set of Killers,” 1). The comedians ended the 1940s looking forward to the decade ahead and hoping for new and improved professional opportunities. Costello said, “Comedians like Danny Kaye and Red Skelton get color and good stories, and girls like Esther Williams in their pictures. We’re third on the box ofﬁce list, a bigger draw than any of them. But we’ve never done a color picture: we’ve never gone on location, and instead of Jane Russell we get Patricia Alphin. From now on we’re going to give the fans more” (Patricia Clary, “Costello, Well Again, Thinner Than Bud Abbott,” Cedar Rapids Gazette, 7 September 1949, 13). For the comedy team that had shot more than two dozen features, starred in hundreds of hours of radio shows, and made countless personal appearances during the 1940s, as well as perfecting one of comedy’s most enduring sketches in “Who’s on First?,” giving the fans more would be a daunting task.\n\n32\n\nDAVID SEDMAN\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nPostscript: Bud and Lou after the 1940s\n\nAs they entered the 1950s, Costello’s prediction of the team’s starring in its ﬁrst color ﬁlm came true but it would not be backed by Universal. Instead, Abbott and Costello independently ﬁnanced their color feature Jack and the Beanstalk (1952). They appeared on television semiregularly as hosts on twenty episodes of the “Colgate Comedy Hour” in 1951, and in two seasons of their own situation comedy, “The Abbott and Costello Show” in 1952 and 1953. Unfortunately, the added exposure of television did not help their longevity as a team. When Abbott and Costello’s status as the most sought-after comedy pair was taken over by Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, the team’s descent was almost as rapid as its rise to stardom. Abbott and Costello ﬁnished 1951 with their seventh top ten ranking in the Motion Picture Herald exhibitor’s poll, behind Martin and Lewis. Less than four years later, in 1955, Abbott and Costello found themselves without a studio movie contract when Universal could not reach an agreement with the two comedians. The team made what would be its ﬁnal ﬁlm together in the independently produced Dance with Me, Henry (1956). The absence of a regular ﬁlm, radio, or television series contract meant that the Hollywood fan magazines provided scant coverage of the pair during the mid1950s. For a team that depended on maximum exposure, the future looked dim. Meanwhile, bad ﬁnancial news came when, in 1956, at a most inopportune time, the IRS forced each of the stars to pay back taxes. The ﬁnancial liabilities resulted in tremendous loss of their assets, including their homes and their ﬁlm rights. The team even lost its comic book deal when the publisher, St. John’s, discontinued the comic line in September 1956. When news of their split as a team was announced in 1957, neither the fan magazines nor the general press gave the story much prominence. The comedians, known for feuding away from the cameras, continued to have moments of bad blood. Abbott sued Costello for $222,000 in 1958 over a dispute concerning the amount of money Abbott earned on the situation comedy earlier in the decade (“Bud Abbott Sues Costello Over Pay,” The Oklahoman, 12 March 1958, 2). Abbott would retire temporarily from show business until his less-than-stellar return in the 1960s, while Costello died in 1959 just after completing his only solo comedy, The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock (1959). Yet the pair received perhaps its most prized recognition when the Baseball Hall of Fame placed their gold record of the skit “Who’s on First?” in a permanent exhibit. Said Costello, “This is better than winning an Oscar” (“Baseball Skit in Shrine,” New York Times 30 May 1956, 16).\n\n2 ★★★★★★★★★★ ✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩✩ Gene Autry and Roy Rogers The Light of Western Stars EDWARD BUSCOMBE\n\nFriends have learned to tolerate my apparent obsession with the western movie (they don’t any longer call them “cowboy ﬁlms” when I’m around). Even so, there were some sniggers when I said I was trying to write something about singing cowboys. “You mean Roy Rogers?” they’d say with a laugh, scarcely bothering to disguise their disdain. “Do you really like that stuff?” Gene Autry portrait, c. 1942; Roy Rogers portrait, c. 1944. Both photos collection of the author. 33\n\n34\n\nEDWARD BUSCOMBE\n\nSuch an apparently simple question raises a lot more questions in turn. First, there’s the assumption that in order to write about something you have to actively enjoy it. Perhaps only people who aren’t ﬁlm studies academics (normal people, if you like) believe that. They think that ﬁlm criticism or ﬁlm history is a sort of cheerleading activity. You write about things to convey your enthusiasm and hopefully to convert others to your enthusiasm. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course, and I’ve done it myself. But that’s not why I am writing this piece. I really don’t mind if not one reader is inspired to watch a Gene Autry ﬁlm. I don’t want to turn anyone into a fan. I’m not really a fan myself. What I’d like to do is try to understand something that was once a considerable phenomenon in the cinema, something too big to be ignored, though mostly it has been. I was a fan once. When I was very young, I was passionate about Roy Rogers. In the small town in the west of England where I grew up, the local picture house—called, with a deplorable lack of ambition, The Cinema—ran double bills that changed twice a week, and as likely as not a singing cowboy western would make up one half of the bill. There must have been plenty of Gene Autry ﬁlms on offer, but my memory is that whenever I pleaded with my mother to be allowed to go to the pictures for the second time in a week, it was always because there was a new Roy Rogers ﬁlm I simply had to see. My brother and I preferred Roy because, ﬁrst, his ﬁlms also featured George “Gabby” Hayes, whom we much preferred to Gene’s regular partner, Smiley Burnette. I guess we just thought he was funnier, though actually I now think I prefer Smiley. Gabby is just, well, too gabby. Also, Gabby was relentlessly misogynistic, whereas Smiley was always mooning after girls, which we didn’t approve of. (I feel differently now.) Second, it was our feeling that there was more action in Roy’s ﬁlms, more chases on horseback, more ﬁstﬁghts and gunﬁghts. And the action (you could hardly call it violence) was just a little more realistic in Roy’s ﬁlms. Most important, Roy didn’t sing as much. At least that’s what we thought. In fact, further research shows that both Gene and Roy sang ﬁve or six songs each per ﬁlm. For us that was ﬁve or six too many. We liked the ﬁlms because they were westerns, not because they were musicals. But while I suspect most small boys at the time shared our views, the music that Roy and Gene made was immensely popular with older audiences, and it’s clear that both performers regarded themselves as singers who acted, not the other way round. In his autobiography, Back in the Saddle Again, Autry put it thus: “Music has been the better part of my career. Movies are wonderful fun, and they give you a famous face. But how the words and melody are joined, how they come together out of air and enter the mind, this is art. Songs are forever” (Autry 18).\n\nGENE AUTRY AND ROY ROGERS\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\n35\n\nThe Careers: Stardust on the Sage\n\nGene and Roy (it seems natural to refer to them in that friendly manner; they encouraged that kind of identiﬁcation) had a lot in common; in many ways they were mirror images of each other. Both came from humble backgrounds. Gene Autry was born in rural Oklahoma in 1907 (originally named Orvon Grover Autry). His education was limited; at age seventeen he got a job working on the St. Louis–San Francisco Railroad. In his early twenties he combined railroad work with singing on local radio shows, and by 1929 he had begun a successful recording career, though his family was too poor to buy a phonograph on which to play his records. It’s hard to imagine that degree of poverty now; in 1932 Autry’s mother died of pellagra, a disease caused by malnourishment. (His father was constantly in and out of jail for petty frauds.) In 1931 Autry moved to Chicago to appear on the highly popular “Barn Dance” show put out by radio station WLS. It was at this point that Autry began dressing in western style and was billed as “The Oklahoma Yodeling Cowboy,” his style of music owing much to the “hillbilly” yodeling songs of Jimmie Rodgers. In 1934 Autry was taken to Hollywood and signed by Mascot Pictures to appear in a couple of westerns starring Ken Maynard. Mascot was almost immediately taken over by Republic, who would produce almost all of Autry’s early ﬁlms. His role in these ﬁrst ﬁlms, In Old Santa Fe and Mystery Mountain, was mainly to sing, while Maynard supplied the action. Though Autry’s acting was stiff and awkward, the popularity of his singing was not in doubt, and when Maynard left the company Autry was offered the starring role in The Phantom Empire (1935), a serial that was a bizarre hybrid of the western and science ﬁction genres. The ﬁlm was enough of a success for Autry to be given his ﬁrst starring role in a feature western, Tumbling Tumbleweeds (1935), in which Autry sings in a total of nine musical numbers. In subsequent ﬁlms that number was trimmed to half a dozen, but otherwise the format was to vary little over the next twenty years. During that time Autry made some ninety ﬁlms, which up until 1948 were distributed by Republic and thereafter by Columbia. Roy Rogers was born Leonard Slye in Ohio in 1911. Like Autry, his parents were poor and he had minimal schooling. His family moved to California in 1930, and Roy got work as an itinerant fruit picker. He joined several shortlived musical groups before helping to found in 1934 the Sons of the Pioneers, who would eventually achieve great and lasting success. By this time he had changed his name to Dick Weston, but when he was signed by Republic in 1937 the studio renamed him once more, and Roy Rogers was born.\n\n36\n\nEDWARD BUSCOMBE\n\nThough he had several bit parts, largely uncredited, with the Sons of the Pioneers, Rogers’s big break came in 1938. Gene Autry was in the middle of a bitter dispute with Republic, essentially about getting a bigger share of the spoils from his growing movie popularity. As a means of putting pressure on Autry to settle, Republic head Herbert J. Yates offered a contract to Rogers, whose ﬁrst feature, Under Western Stars, was released in 1938. Though Autry soon returned to the fold, Rogers was enough of a success for Yates to keep him working, and the careers of the two singing cowboys continued in tandem for some years. When the United States entered World War II, Autry enlisted in the Army Air Corps and spent the war years ﬂying planes, his ﬁlm career suspended. Rogers, on the other hand, stayed behind in Hollywood. There are different accounts of why Rogers did not join the military. In his autobiography, Happy Trails, he says that he was too old for active service; he would have been thirty when war was declared (Rogers and Evans 71). But another version was that he was kept out by chronic arthritis (George-Warren 224). However this may be, Autry’s absence provided Rogers with the perfect opportunity to leap ahead in the popularity stakes, and in 1943 he topped the list of western stars performing best at the box ofﬁce. Autry resumed his Hollywood career in 1946 and thereafter he and Rogers vied for the number one spot. The following year Autry left Republic and his remaining ﬁlms were to be produced by Columbia. Both Rogers and Autry were alert to the coming appeal of television, and each tried to prevent Republic selling their old ﬁlms to TV, because such screenings would affect the box ofﬁce for their current theatrical releases. At the same time, each was anxious to begin production of his own television show, and screenings on TV of their old ﬁlms damaged the prospects for this. Eventually these disputes were settled and the two stars made the transit from cinema to television. Autry’s ﬁnal feature ﬁlm, appropriately titled Last of the Pony Riders, was released in 1953. “The Gene Autry Show” ﬁrst aired on television in 1950. Roy Rogers’s last leading role in a western was in Pals of the Golden West (1951); “The Roy Rogers Show” premiered on television the same year.\n\n✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★✩ ★\n\nThe Films: Happy Trails\n\nNot surprisingly, in view of the fact that Rogers was groomed as a replacement for Autry, their ﬁlms were similar in many respects. Budgets were tight; Republic’s boss, Herbert Yates, didn’t like to throw his money around. The ﬁlms generally ran just over an hour. The formula was arrived at very early, and scarcely deviated in twenty years of production.\n\nGENE AUTRY AND ROY ROGERS\n\n37\n\nIn his autobiography, Autry describes it thus: “1) a decent story; 2) good music; 3) comedy relief; 4) enough action, with chases and ﬁghts; and 5) a little romance. And always we played it against the sweep of desert scenery, mountains and untamed land, and an ocean of sky” (Autry 39). From the sound of that summary, one might suppose that the ﬁlms made by the singing cowboys closely followed the recipe for westerns that had been laid down almost from the beginning of cinema: an entertaining tale of the frontier, with glorious western scenery, and plenty of action, with the only variation being the addition of songs integrated into the diegesis. But in fact the differences from the standard A-feature western as it had become codiﬁed by the mid-1930s are as striking as the similarities. In the ﬁlms of Autry and Rogers the stories follow a basic pattern. The motor that drives the plot is usually some kind of criminal activity. Bad guys are trying to cheat or strong-arm some nice, ordinary folks out of their rightful possessions, often a ranch, a mine, or some kind of business. Gene or Roy comes to their rescue, convincing the victims of his honesty of purpose, winning their trust, and eventually defeating the villains with a combination of ingenuity, good sense, and a little forceful physicality. The ﬁlms eschew the historical themes and narratives that commentators have seen as the essence of the western genre, lacking the mythical dimension the western has frequently exhibited. Manifest Destiny, the winning of the West, the conﬂict of civilization and savagery—none of these plays a large role. Instead of dealing with such grand themes as the Indian Wars, building the transcontinental railroad, or westward migration, singing cowboy ﬁlms are concerned with problems of a more contemporary nature. As Peter Stanﬁeld has shown, there is a considerable afﬁnity between their actions and the ethos of Roosevelt’s New Deal (Stanﬁeld, Horse Opera 144). Small farmers and ranchers are often the victims of crooked bankers or lawyers from the city. Roy or Gene is successful in defending them because the hero is very much an ordinary man, not possessed of superhuman qualities, and with only one exceptional talent—a pleasing singing voice. The west of Gene and Roy has largely been settled; it’s not really a frontier world at all. Indians scarcely exist. The ﬁlms take place in a curious never-never land that mingles past and present. Many iconographical trappings originating in the western’s historical roots are present onscreen: Gene and Roy appear on horseback (Autry on Champion, Rogers on the equally famous Trigger), dressed in a stylized version of western costume (wide-brimmed hat, fancy shirt, embossed gunbelt and six-shooter, cowboy boots). But the stories are not usually set in the historical past. The milieu they inhabit is recognizably modern, replete with radio, telephones, cars,\n\n38\n\nEDWARD BUSCOMBE\n\nRoy Rogers with his trusty equine sidekick, Trigger, c. 1941.

Thus the ﬁlms are able to deliver many of the traditional pleasures of the western (ﬁstﬁghts and gunﬁghts, chases on horseback) while at the same time the stories are more closely related to a contemporary everyday world.1 Under Fiesta Stars (1941) is representative. It has a present-day setting. Gene is left a half-share in a mine by an elderly man who had been his mentor. The man has been employing local men ruined by the dustbowl, many of them Mexicans. Unfortunately, the other half of the mine has been\n\nGENE AUTRY AND ROY ROGERS\n\n39\n\nleft to the man’s niece, Barbara (Carol Hughes), who simply wants to sell her share for as much money as she can get. She hires a couple of shyster lawyers, who in turn pay some hit men to dispose of Gene. In a confrontation, Gene tells her off for being mercenary, and she counters by calling him a cheap rodeo rider. But eventually through the sheer goodness of his personality Gene wins her over to his way of thinking and the bad guys are routed. The mine can continue to fulﬁll a socially useful purpose. In Silver Spurs (1943), Roy’s employer owns a large ranch where oil has been discovered. Legal complications mean he is unable to sell it, but his widow could. Some crooks from the big city hatch a plan to marry him off to a pretty newspaper reporter. He is then shot and Roy is framed for the crime. But eventually Roy unmasks the crooks, having ﬁrst won over the reporter to his side. At the end Roy and the girl plan to set up a cooperative oil company to beneﬁt all in the community. One curious feature of the narratives is that almost invariably the character that Autry plays is named “Gene Autry.” Rogers, too, is more often than not playing a character named Roy. This further removes the story from any historical referent, serving instead to blur the line between a ﬁctional world and the world outside the movies, in which Gene Autry and Roy Rogers are real people. The ﬁlms thus become something resembling the stars’ personal appearances or their radio shows, expressions not so much of a recognizable western milieu as a continuation of their life as showbiz personalities. In the A-feature western of the 1940s we ﬁnd an increasing concern with issues of masculinity, focused in particular on the nature and consequences of violence, the need for a man to stand up and be counted, and to overcome whatever doubts he has about his courage and commitment. This is the era of the so-called “psychological” western, in which the troubled hero broods upon his fate, often suffering from the burden of some emotionally crippling incident in his past. The hero’s personality is often dominating, harsh, even bitter. Frequently condemned to live on the margins of society, he shoulders a heavy burden, and the forces he pits himself against are merciless. Gene and Roy have undergone no such psychological traumas. Invariably sunny and serene in their disposition, they never doubt themselves, nor suffer anxiety about what to do next. Their way forward is always clear, and they integrate easily into the world they inhabit. Instead of an aggressive masculinity, they display a genial and friendly manner, kind to children, animals, and women. Occasional musical interludes are not unknown in the A-feature western. One thinks of the stars of Rio Bravo (1959) singing “My Riﬂe, My Pony, and Me” together in the jailhouse. But such numbers are not an essential\n\n40\n\nEDWARD BUSCOMBE\n\npart of the ﬁlm’s appeal. With Autry and Rogers, their fame as singing stars was what made their ﬁlms viable. The western musical, such as The Harvey Girls (1946) or Calamity Jane (1953), is a special case, a separate subgenre. The music of such ﬁlms does not have a speciﬁcally western style. Instead, it comes out of the American stage musical tradition, the show-business world of composers such as Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, and Irving Berlin. The plots of these musical ﬁlms center around a romantic relationship, as in nonwestern musicals, whereas in the singing cowboy ﬁlms, as we shall see, romance is incidental. The singing cowboys’ musical style originates in what was later to become country music, at that time still labeled “hillbilly” music. Autry early modeled himself on Jimmie Rodgers, whose distinctive style of “blue yodeling” gained him a large following in the South in the 1920s. Rodgers’s songs are plaintive, sometimes scabrous laments for a rambling, restless life, full of brushes with the law, drinking bouts, and women who played fast and loose with his affections. Rodgers had nothing of the cowboy about him; Peter Stanﬁeld’s thesis is that this music lent itself to adaptation to a western idiom because the cowboy was a similarly restless roamer. But in transposing the music from south to west, Autry, a key player in this process, effaced the “overt racist or class connotations of the hillbilly,” as well as repressing the “black heritage apparent in so much early country music.” Repackaging the popular music of the south into a cowboy format gave it nationwide popularity, and cleaning up the sexual frankness of the hillbilly tradition made it more suitable for a public medium such as the radio, upon which so much of the economics of popular music depended at that time (Stanﬁeld Horse Opera).2 There’s little to choose between the singing styles of Autry and Rogers. Both of them were hugely popular as recording artists as well as movie performers, and Autry in particular had some breakout numbers that took him beyond the limitations of his cowboy persona. “Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” released in 1949, reached the top of both the country & western and pop charts in Billboard magazine. In the ﬁrst year the song sold two million copies, and sales reached twenty-ﬁve million over the next forty years. But in terms of their movies, both Rogers and Autry remained comfortably within their niche market. True, Roy Rogers had occasional parts in bigger movies, appearing alongside Bob Hope in Son of Paleface, a comedy western of 1952. But this was a rare excursion outside the self-contained world of the singing western. Although, as I have said, romance is not a major element within the ﬁlms, it does feature prominently in the songs that Autry and Rogers sing.\n\nGENE AUTRY AND ROY ROGERS\n\n41\n\nGene Autry with guitar, c. 1941.

A third song, “Fort Worth Jail,” is more in the Jimmie Rodgers tradition, a lament about falling foul of a treacherous girl and landing in prison. The fourth song, “In Old Capistrano,” celebrates the musical vitality of the Mexican town where some of the action is set (the Hispanic southwest, on both sides of the border, is a persistent leitmotif in the ﬁlms of both Autry and Rogers).
