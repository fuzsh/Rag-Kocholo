        "text": "by Sam Juliano\n\nOne of the key figures of the pre-code era in American cinema, William A. Wellman’s critical reputation remains in a state of flux, ranging from glowing comparisons to D.W. Griffith to repudition of his “impersonal” style as the product of studio domination. His most ardent supporters make claim for auteur status and a favorable comparison with other masculine filmmakers of lofty regard like Howard Hawks, John Ford and Raoul Walsh. The advocates could further make a persuasive case for Wellman’s versatility and prolific output, both of which rival Hawks, and for a career that spans nearly five decades. But the two are further linked by their love and experience in aviation, a subject that was treated in several Wellman features dating back to the celebrated Oscar winner Wings in 1928 and concluding appropriately enough with the director’s final film, Lafayette Escadrille, which chronicles the period he spent in in France during World War I serving as a volunteer fighter pilot. One of Hawks’ two lost films, The Air Circus, about the friendship of two pilots, was also released in 1928. Hence it seems like no fluke that both men, (born the same year, with Wellman four months older) with similar macho backgrounds would direct what are arguably the two greatest old-school gangster films ever made, The Public Enemy and Scarface, released within five months of each other in the early 1930’s. Some of the most prominent actors and actresses got their start under Wellman and Hawks, and both made smooth transitions from the silent era to the advent of the talkies. Some would claim the comparisons would end there, and see Hawks as the greater talent with some compelling evidence, but a recently-concluded 40 film Wellman retrospective at Manhattan’s Film Forum has shown if nothing else, that both of these distinguished figures can and should be spoken of with a comparable degree of veneration. Yes, Ernst Lubitsch, James Whale and Joseph Von Sternberg are also major players during this period, and a case could be made for the achievements of the first two at least eclipsing Wellman during the five year period (1929-1934) of this era, but only Hawks and Anthony Mann can match Wellman by way of the diversity of his output. Wellman made great contributions in the gangster, western, adventure, social drama, noir, silent, screwball comedy and melodrama genres, and any list of his greatest films would invariably tap into a number of these types.\n\nMost film critics and historians have resisted attaching the prestigious auteur label on Wellman because his vital social-consciousness and organized crime films of the 1930’s for Warner Brothers are in large measure indistinguishable from the other studio work crafted by others, especially films helmed by Hawks and Ford, who some feel developed themes with a greater degree of artistic and a personal stamp. Yet, it could also be persuasively argued that Wellman helped to developed the trademark Warner Brothers depression-era style than anyone else, and several of his best films like Wild Boys of the Road and Heroes for Sale showcase this propensity. While some of Wings for all of it’s bravura filmmaking was artificially transcribed, everything worked in The Public Enemy which propelled it’s iconic lead actor to superstardom, and employed vivid images and an acute sence of violence and brutality that even resonated in off-screen implications. Some of this style can also be seen in the same year’s The Star Witness, but in the Cagney classic everything came together in a way that was quite achieved again. It can be rightly asserted that Wellman’s films are more formidable than the man who made them, and that there isn’t really a unifying style. This goes back to the intrinsic differences in the exploration of disperate genres (who can readily tell for example the similarities between The Public Enemy, Nothing Sacred, A Star is Born and The Story of G.I. Joe by way of tone or style?) even if as Wellman afficionado Judy Geater contends in her exceptional essays of the director at Movie Classics, there are compelling hints that Wellman is overseeing the works. For one, Wellman likes filming in the rain, and an acute theme of survival runs through practically his entire canon, especially his Depression era and war films. And then, perhaps most perceptibly, the music of movement in the way it’s transcribed in travel was launched early in his career with his first masterpiece Beggars of Life which first introduced trains (later the actual subject of the extraordinary Wild Boys of the Road) and characters who jump on and off them in some breakneck narrative strains. Wellman’s aviation films of course speak for themselves and amply demonstrate the director’s technical skills learned from years of actual experience, and in addition to Wings, the retrospective featured Gallant Journey, Men with Wings and aforementioned Lafayette Escardrille as further entries in this sub-genre. While the latter film is artistically uneven and flawed, the first two rarities are engaging and show the director at his most lyrical and care free, fully in command of his craft, and the looming specter of his own emotional and psychological experiences as part of the cinematic equation. Earning the nickname “Wild Bill” both for his real-life exploits in the service of the Lafayette Escadrille and for the wild parties, bad temper and fisticuffs that occured during the making of his films, Wellman possessed a larger than life personality that often obscured his work and sometimes accentuated his lesser films, which were relatively abundent in a prolific career of over 60 films where he served as director.\n\nWellman’s painful and poignant delineation of Norman Maine’s gradual downfall in the screen’s original and best version of A Star is Born, his expressionist gamble in the late-career Track of the Cat, his powerful transcription of Walter Van Tilberg Clark’s literary masterwork The Ox-Bow Incident, the astounding dramatic power he builds and orchestrates in the Western classic Yellow Sky, and his celebrated kinship with Ernie Pyle during the filming of the war classic The Story of G.I. Joe will always be seen as highlights in the director’s career, but a remarkable scroll of performers attests to his vital role in building their own futures, among them: Cagney, Cooper, Rogers, Gaynor, March, Barthelmess, L. Young, Powell, Dvorak, O’Brien, Fonda, Andrews, Darwell, Beery, L. Brooks, F. Vidor, Huston, Gable, Baxter, Dunne, Dix, Murray, Peck, Widmark, Arthur, McCrae, O’Hara, Johnson, Lombard, Menjou and G. Rogers. His own son, William Wellman Jr., who has tirelessly promoted his father’s work for decades, and who has written books and appear at various festivals, (including this one where he spoke and conducted Q & A sessions after screenings of Wings and The High and the Mighty) played his father in Lafayette Escadrille and remains the foremost authority on Wellman the Man.\n\nThe harshest critics of Wellman’s cinema either concede that he may have made a single masterwork, or none at all are slowly decreasing in numbers as a serious re-evaluation of his work and influence in the glory years continues to have sway with the discerning scholars and historians. After watching 39 of 40 films over a consecutive 21 day period at the Film Forum from February 10th to March 1st (I had of course seen many of these before on DVD and at other venues, and have also managed six or seven Wellmans not shown at the festival) and negotiating some superlative prints, I am of the opinion that five or six of the director’s films can rightfully be placed in the top rank. I have noted the particulars in the following re-cap of the films I saw at the festival, and have included capsule assessments and summary ratings for all 39. I only missed Island in the Sky, though like many I’ve seen it previously:\n\nWings **** 1/2 (1928)\n\nThe first-ever Best Picture winner was presented in spectacular fashion with a HD print that features the new blu-ray restoration. The extraordinarily eloquent William Wellman Jr. (now 75, and author of a new book on the film) dazzled the audience with a delightful introduction and fascinating anecdotes of his early life growing up and of visits to his home of celebrities like Gary Cooper. He spoke of the stunts employed in the film, and of his father’s propensity for bizarre humor. He cited the ‘bubbles’ sequence in WINGS as a prime example. Cooper and Clara Bow are memorable in a film that features some of the best aviation sequences ever captured.\n\nThe High and the Mighty *** (1954)\n\nA pioneer of disaster movies, and Wewllman’s most successful commercial feature starring John Wayne. Nothing really special here save for the aerial sequences and Dmitri Tiomkin’s Oscar-winning score.\n\nChinatown Heights ** 1/2 (1929)\n\nMinor Wellman about mobster activity in Chinatown, New York City with a convincing realism and evocation of period. Less effective are the violent set pieces.\n\nYou Never Know Women *** (1926)\n\nThought lost until discovery in 2001 this silent romantic adventure has some fine performances and an interesting stunt, scene but overall rather mediocre.\n\nA Star is Born ***** (1937)\n\nSatire on Hollywood directed with skill, insight and passion by Wellman, and beautifully acted by Frederic March as the Hollywood actor on the way down because of drink and Janey Gaynor as the young girl he discovers and turns into a star. A wittily scripted film with an Oscar winning original story by Wellman and Robert Carson and some lovely early Technicolor photography by W. Howard Greene. Superior to the Garland re-make of 1954, and suffused with a refreshing innocence. One of Wellman’s finest films.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-Z46ioykM0\n\nNothing Sacred **** 1/2 (1937)\n\nSmall-town girl (Carole Lombard), thought to be dying from radium poisoning but in reality as fit as a fiddle, is given the time of her life in New York by a large newspaper who hopes to gain publicity by following the “last weeks” of her life. Generally regarded as a classic satire from a brilliant script. Ben Hecht’s attacks on publicity methods and the gutter press are consistently on target. Frederick March, Walter Connolly as his editor and Sig Rumann as a faous European specialist on radium poisoning.\n\nThe Great Man’s Lady *** (1942)\n\nForgettable, but reasonably entertaining comedy drama with Barabara Stanwyck and Joel McCrea with a flashback structure.\n\nBuffalo Bill *** (1944)\n\nJoel McCrea’s William Cody is a memorable character, and visually this is a striking feature, but narratively it’s rather uneventful and marginally eentertaining. Wellman’s weakest Technicolor effort.\n\nNight Nurse ****\n\nBarabara Stanwyck and Joan Blondell, quick-changing between uniforms, breezily battle bootleggers, drunken mothers, corrupt doctors and meanacing chauffeur Clark Gable. It’s a fast-moving fun film in Wellman’s best pre-code style.\n\nThe Purchase Price *** (1932)\n\nBecoming George Brent’s mail order bride in Elk’s Crossing, North Dakota, don’t look so bad to Broadway thrush Barbara Stanwyck after tussles with gangster boyfriend Lyle Talbot. Bu there are some other problems. It’s a moderately fun movie, even though it’s rather unmemorable afterwards.\n\nThe Man I Love **** (1929)\n\nHerman Mankiewitz scripted this very first Wellman talkie, which boasted a nice print and some archtypal Wellman characters including an arrogant boxer and a temptress. Strong melodrama that is one of Wellman scholar Frank Thompson’s personal favorites.\n\nWild Boys of the Road ***** (1933)\n\nOne of Wellman’s greatest films, and one that best represents his most stellar qualities in his peak period. Wild Boys of the Road is a Depression era drama following the plight of teenagers Eddie Smith (Darrow) and Tommy Gordon (Phillips) who hit the open road when their parents are left unemployed and destitute. Hopping freight cars heading east, they eventually take up with other homeless juveniles including Sally (Coonan) who has been passing herself off as a boy. Their journey finds them battling hardships including unsympathetic railroad detectives, an impenetrable labor market in nearly every town along their bicoastal journey, and adults willing to exploit the disadvantaged and naive youths. Darro comes off as a young Cagney and the young boys immediately grab the heart with their sincerity and desire to improve the general good. Technically, this is one of Wellman’s finest hours with the economical use of the train props, and the sense of realism during the Depression era deeply resonates. The social issues broached here mirrored a widespread injustice during this period, and the film inspires with it’s resolutions.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDC8AAtZkck\n\nHeroes For Sale **** 1/2 (1933)\n\nA Wellman pre-code gem features Richard Barthelmess as a drug addict who moves from the World War I trenches to the breadlines and railroad ties of 1933, encountering communism, welfare capitalism, Red Squads, police brutality and riots along the way. Bathelmess is deeply affecting in a film that refuses to take the easy way out.\n\nYellow Sky ***** (1948)\n\nHoled up in a ghost town named “Yellow Sky” after a post-bank robbery chase across a desert, Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark and the gang find they’re not alone when tom-boyish Anne Baxter gets the drop on them, and then gold complicates the story. One of the truly great westerns, with spectacular cinematography by Joseph MacDonald, and a building dread.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7tupbE3v18\n\nThe Ox-Bow Incident *****\n\nWestern drama of Nevada in the 1880’s based on literary classic by Walter Van Tillberg Clark about three cowboys lynched for a murder they did not commit. Relentless, uncompromising film is one of the most powerful indictments of prejudice and mob hysteria ever put on the screen. Exceptional performances from Dana Andrews, Anthony Quinn and Francis Ford as the three men, Henry Fonda as an unwilling lyncher, and Jane Darwell as a lewd old bitch. Arthur Miller’s atmospheric photography and Cyril J. Mockridge’s music are outstanding and the film leaves an unforgettable impression and sense of outrage. By any barometer of measurement it’s one of Wellman’s greatest films.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lljIrAfBzYs\n\nBeggars of Life *****\n\nBeggars of Life is a drama of Nancy (Louise Brooks), a young woman on a farm who kills her foster father when he attempts to rape her. She is assisted in escaping from the farm by Jim (Richard Arlen), a young hobo who has stopped to ask for food. By dressing in rough men’s clothing, Nancy, with the assistance of Jim, eludes the police. They hop a freight train and, when thrown off by the brakeman, they wander into a hobo camp. The leadership of the hobo camp is bitterly contested between Arkansas Snake (Robert Perry) and Oklahoma Red (Wallace Beery). The encampment is broken up by detectives forcing Nancy and Jim take refuge with a seriously ill tramp in an abandoned shack. Oklahoma Red unexpectedly shows up in a stolen car and woman’s clothing to help Nancy escape. This masterful silent, in dire need of restoration exhibits a remarkable sense of realism and a riveting mise en scene with a comelling drama.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb2iMfWpFnI\n\nBeau Geste **** 1/2\n\nP.C. Wren’s famous adventure story about three young English brothers who run off to join the Foreign Legion when one of them is suspected of stealing the family sapphire. A superlative cast featuring Gary Cooper, Robert Preston, Ray Milland and Brian Donleavy with some dazzling action sequences and exquisite set design. Repeat viewings have always been kind.\n\nCall of the Wild ***\n\nAverage adventure yarn with Clark Gable based on Jack London classic.\n\nSafe in Hell **** 1/2 (1931)\n\nDorothy Mackail as a shady lady in the tropics in one of Wellman’s finest pre-coders. After murdering the man responsible for launching her life as a prostitute, Gilda (Mackail) escapes to a tropical island in coutroom drama of love and fidelity. Sidney Hickox’s camerwork boats some expressionistic flourishes.\n\nStingaree **** (1934)\n\nDown Under western, as Richard Dix’s eponymous Aussie outlaw aids maid Irene Dunne’s rise to international opera stardom. It’s certainly a bizarre film in many ways, but much of the attempts at humor hit the mark, and the musical numbers are delightful. One of Wellman’s more unique efforts.\n\nCentral Airport ** 1/2 (1933)\n\nNot a Wellman one is likely to remember, but still a reasonably entertaining film in a minor key featuring a favorite Wellman locale.\n\nThe Story of G.I. Joe **** 1/2 (1945)\n\nThe experiences of a small group of World War II infantrymen from the days of their first action in Tunisia to the fall of Cassino and the march on Rome. Based on the Pulitzer-prize winning correspondent Ernie Pyle (later killed in the fighting at Iwo Jima) and beautifully directed with restraint by Wellman, whose directorial skill was never more evident than in the sequence showing some Nazi snipers being ferreted out of a ruined Italian church. Burgess Meredith is excellent as Pyle, as is Robert Mitchum in an early role as a war-weary sergeant.\n\nBattleground *** 1/2 (1949)\n\nA vivid reconstruction of the 1944 defense of Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge during Von Rundstedt’s last offensive of the war. Ambitious war film, better than some give it credit for, thought not as fine as The Story of G. I. Joe. Outstanding monochrome photography from Paul Vogel, who won an Oscar.\n\nReaching for the Sun **** (1941)\n\nA wonderful rarity starring Joel McCrae, Eddie Bracken and Ellen Drew in a Preston Sturges like story about a man on a special mission, undaunted till the end.\n\nMen With Wings **** (1938)\n\nA beautiful Technicolor rarity that allows Wellman to again immerse himself into some clever aerial sequences in a mainly melodramatic film that mostly engages.\n\nTrack of the Cat **** 1/2 (1954)\n\nA bizarre and dysfunctional family in one of the strangest westerns ever filmed, one that is basically and black and white film shot in color. It’s the most experimental of all Wellman’s films, it’s often a hoot, and in the end a near-masterpiece.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SovuVJjjK6I&feature=related\n\nWestward the Women *** 1/2 (1951)\n\nWoman-hating scout Robert Taylor guides a wagon-train of mail order brides across the plains to California, highlighted by a monumental drunk at a gravesite, a flash flood and a waterless trek through the desert. A splendidly filmed western with a refreshing feminist perspective, and some great humorous moments.\n\nThe Star Witness **** (1931)\n\nA solid gangster film that came out the same year as The Public Enemy, but not quite in the same league despite the strongest of commendations from Thompson and Gallagher. Walter Huston delivers an outstanding performance.\n\nThe Public Enemy ***** (1931)\n\nKey gangster movie of the early 1930’s traces the rise, career and violent death of a liquoe rachet gangster named Tom Powers, with a egendary performance by James cagney. Taken from a story by former Chicago news reporters John Bright and Kubec Glasmon and forever famous for the scene in which a disgruntled Cagney shoves a grapefruit into the face of startled floozie Mae Clarke. Some unforgettable scenes include the off-screen shooting of a race horse who caused the death of it’s rider, a gang member; a shoot-up in the rain with a badly-wounded Cagney struggling through puddles to escape, and the ghoulish ending when Cagney is “delivered” to his family. Many consider this Cagney’s greatest role, though there are a few others that match it.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTXJyo5Vry4\n\nRoxie Hart **** (1942)\n\nFarce starring Ginger Rogers (that inspired the musical Chicago) who plays a 1920’s showgirl who confesses to a murder just for the publicity. The sensational trial grants her the name recognition she always sought, and along the way the humor is inspired in large measure.\n\nLady of Burlesque *** (1943)\n\nBased on The G-String Murders, a best-selling novel by famed stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, Lady of Burlesque is decidedly minor Wellman with a charismatic turn as always from Barabara Stanwyck. The bawdy atmosphere and the Oscar-nominated musical score and songs are what remembers most here.\n\nYoung Eagles *** (1930)\n\nOn leave in Paris from ongoing World War II, air duel with Paul Lukas’s German ace the Grey Eagle, American flyboy Buddy Rogers falls for expatriate Jean Arthur, in a film that is narratively uneven, though with a spectacular crash sequence. Another in Wellman’s aviation sub-genre.\n\nFrisco Jenny *** 1/2\n\nAfter the 1906 quake, desperate single mom Ruth Chatterton turns tricks in Chinatown, then takes the fall for a murder rap, her fortunes improving with the golden age of bootlegging. A memorable Wellman pre-coder, with Chatterton in top form.\n\nThe Conquerors **** (1932)\n\nIn the wake of the 1873 panic, Richard Dix and Ann Harding shrug off an attack by river pirates and a mass lynching to build a successful bank in Nebraska, living to see their grandson (Dix) become a flyboy hero in World War I and sustain the Great Depression. Indeed the stock market crash sequence near the film’s end is superbly presented.\n\nThe Iron Curtain *** (1948)\n\nSoviet embassy code clerk Dana Andrews decides to defect, but will any of those Canadian bureaucrats actually want his top secret documents? First of the major post-war Red scare films, but based firmly on the actual Igor Gouzenko case. Rather pedestrian film in story and stylistics.\n\nThe President Vanishes **** (1934)\n\nA favorite with the Film Forum staff this rarity concerns a President who is feared kidnapped, and displays some terrific visual style, editing and camer atricks. Definitely one of Wellman’s most stylistic ventures and sorely deserving of a DVD release.\n\nThe Happy Years **** 1/2 (1950)\n\nA personal favorite, and a glorious use of Technicolor in a turn-of-the-centry boy’s school yarn featuring an impressive Dean Stockwell as a boy coming-of-age under teh watchful eye of a seemingly uncompromising headmaster. Some wonderful set pieces, innocense and charm, and an accurate transcription of a carefree time long since gone.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6feDFG-5adE\n\nGallant Journey **** (1946)\n\nA surprisingly breathtaking, lyrical and beautifully filmed story of the first pioneer, suffused with a strain of fantasy and an engaging performance by Glenn Ford. A rarity.\n\nLafayette Escadrille *** (1958)\n\nWellman’s final film stars his son as Wellman Sr. in an episodic yarn about the early days as a fighter pilot in France. It’s impressively filmed, but only moderately engaging and passably performed. A weak send-off, but enough here to transcribe the director’s deepest passion.\n\nMy 10 Favorite Wellmans in order:\n\n1. Wild Boys of the Road\n\n2. The Ox-Bow Incident\n\n3. The Public Enemy\n\n4. A Star is Born\n\n5. Yellow Sky\n\n6. Beggars of Life\n\n7. The Happy Years\n\n8. Heroes For Sale\n\n9. Track of the Cat\n\n10. The Story of G.I.
