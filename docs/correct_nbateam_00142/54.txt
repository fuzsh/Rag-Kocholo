Veteran guard Gerald Green is retiring after playing 12 NBA seasons and will join the Houston Rockets as a player development coach, the team announced Friday.

Green, a Houston native, was chosen by the Boston Celtics with the 18th overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft. He played for eight NBA teams, including multiple stints with the Celtics and Rockets, and finished with career averages of 9.7 points, 2.5 rebounds and 0.9 assists.

He averaged a career-high 15.8 points for the Phoenix Suns in 2013-14.

Green last played for Houston during the 2018-19 season, averaging 9.2 points in 73 games off the bench. He missed the 2019-20 season with a foot injury and was waived by the Rockets prior to last season. He worked out for Houston again as recently as last month but did not sign a contract.

The 35-year-old Green won the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest at All-Star Weekend and finished second to Dwight Howard the following year.
