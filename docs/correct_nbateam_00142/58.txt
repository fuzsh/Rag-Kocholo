The Houston Rockets are waiving veteran wing Gerald Green, sources tell ESPN's Tim MacMahon.

Houston is currently hard-capped and had limited options to keep the former first-round pick. Guard Chris Clemons' season-ending Achilles injury likely cost Green his roster spot as the team is required to guarantee the former's 2020-21 salary per NBA rules.

Green missed the entire 2019-20 campaign after undergoing surgery to repair a broken bone in his left foot.

The 34-year-old played a valuable role off the bench during his second stint with the Rockets, averaging 10.3 points and shooting 36% from deep.

Green posted 11.5 points per contest in a pair of preseason appearances for Houston.
