        "text": "Joel Anthony, Gary Payton II and Brandon Rush were released Saturday as the Milwaukee Bucks trimmed their roster to the NBA maximum of 15.\n\nThat left Gerald Green, a 6-foot-7 wing with 10 seasons of NBA experience, as the last man standing after nearly three weeks of training camp competition, although the team had not formally announced a contract agreement.\n\nGreen didn't put up standout numbers during the team's four preseason games. He averaging 4.0 points, 1.0 rebounds, 0.8 assists in 10.5 minutes per game while shooting 5 of 13 from the field and 1 of 6 from beyond the three-point arc.\n\nThose numbers don't fully represent the type of player Green has been throughout his career, which is a highly athletic, willing scorer who can create his own shot from any spot on the floor. He's known for high-flying dunks as well as being a solid three-point shooter. In 2013-'14, Green had his most productive season in Phoenix, averaging 15.8 points in 28.4 minutes while shooting a career-high 40.0% from three-point range.\n\nOver the past three seasons while playing an average of 18.6 minutes per game with the Suns, Miami Heat and Boston Celtics, Green's scoring numbers have gone down as has his three-point shooting percentage, which dipped to 34.3% over those seasons.\n\nBut Green is still an overall scoring threat off the bench, something the Bucks need after losing Michael Beasley in free agency over the summer. Green may not have shown it in games, but he proved his shooting skills rank among the best on the team at practices.\n\nHe ran away with a three-point shooting competition against the team's best shooters after a recent practice. Then, following another practice, he made 14 three-pointers in a row from different spots on the floor with the competition on the line.\n\nAmong the three players cut, Payton is the most likely to remain around the team."
