        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nHad jaw-dropping, explosive athleticism. An elite athlete, he played well above the rim and had the potential to take games over offensively for stretches (but rarely did). Flashed lightning quickness and was very fast and coordinated for a player of his size. Versatile, he had an ability to play anywhere from shooting guard to power forward, if needed. Did not always make the most of his incredible physical tools and his intensity level could disappear at the defensive end sometimes. Bumped around the NBA for much of his career, raising questions about whether he declared for the draft too early."
