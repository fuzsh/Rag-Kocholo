        "text": "Gerald Green doesn’t want to talk about dunks.\n\nThat’s the first thing he tells me at the conclusion of the Phoenix Suns’ morning shootaround in an overcast San Antonio. It’s not for a lack of them. There was the time he blew out a candle in the dunk contest, the time he windmilled an alley-oop, the time he threw down off the backboard as a rookie. Green’s Wikipedia page has 24 instances of the word ‘dunk.’ LeBron James’ has three.\n\nYet there’s so much more to the man than YouTube highlights. After all, he lost part of his right ring finger in an accident as a child. He was cut from his high school basketball team twice. He was once compared to Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady coming out of high school, yet he never came close to living up to those comparisons and was out of the league just four seasons after he was drafted. He navigated a winding road back into relevancy that took him through Russia, China and the D-League.\n\nSo, no. Gerald Green doesn’t want to talk about dunks.\n\n\"Nah, hell no,\" he says. \"I don’t want to be remembered for dunks, even though that will probably happen. Hopefully I can win a ring before it’s all said and done. Hopefully they’ll remember me as being a champion.\"\n\nMichael Hickey/Getty Images\n\nAn uneven childhood sent Green careening toward his NBA future. His home life was stable and he wasn’t a bad kid, but some of his choices were – skipping school, earning poor grades, running around the streets.\n\nWhen he was 11, he lost most of his right ring finger in an accident. While jumping to touch a door ledge, a ring on his finger caught a protruding nail, tearing it to the bone and leaving no choice but amputation. At 15, he lost his grandmother, who he was very close with, in a murder-suicide. He was a naturally gifted athlete and basketball player, but his grades and immaturity hurt him even on the court when he was cut from his freshman and sophomore teams.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Green transferred to Gulf Shores Academy and found the man who helped him become who he is today: Ken \"Juice\" Williams, a former player at the University of Houston.\n\n\"I looked at that kid and I said, ‘I got a pro on my team,’\" Williams tells me by phone. \"And everyone who I said that to thought I was crazy.\"\n\nGreen credits so much of his development to Williams. \"Everybody thought I wasn’t going to amount to shit,\" Green says. \"He’s the only one who’s seen me and believed in me, believed I was a good kid, believed I could go to college or maybe go to pros by playing basketball.\"\n\nComing out of high school, Green, at 6’7, 192 pounds, with a 39-inch vertical leap and a sweet, confident stroke, had all the makings of an NBA swingman. But he didn’t play like one when Williams first got hold of him.\n\nTo break Green’s habit of drifting down low into the post, Williams stopped practice and made the entire team run. It only took one instance before all of Green’s teammates were yelling at him any time he strayed below the 3-point line. In the meantime, Williams had Green dribbling everywhere -- at practice, at home, late into the night, after lunch.\n\n\"I told Gerald, ‘You have 15 minutes to eat and then you’re going to come out here and dribble the ball,’\" Williams says. \"And it’d be cold out there, and he’d come out there. He never mumbled one bad word. He just did it.\"\n\nGreen entered the 2005 NBA Draft as a senior, the final year before David Stern imposed an age limit. He chose to forgo a scholarship at Oklahoma State University, believing he would be selected with the third pick. Instead, he tumbled all the way to Boston at No. 18, out of the lottery and into an uncertain future.\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\nAfter a forgettable rookie year, Green averaged 10 points in 81 games his second season in Boston and appeared to be finding his rhythm as a professional. Few could have predicted he would fall out of the NBA two short years later.\n\nThat following summer, Green was dealt as part of a package for Kevin Garnett, leaving Boston with only a 2007 Slam Dunk Contest championship to show for his time there. (\"That’s a great trade,\" Green says. \"I’d trade myself for Kevin Garnett.\") He played for Minnesota briefly before a trade returned him to his hometown Rockets, but Houston waived him weeks later.\n\nA season with the Dallas Mavericks in 2008 stands out because it was his last in the NBA for nearly three years. He only averaged 10 minutes in 38 games under first-year head coach Rick Carlisle. Still, he left an impression on his teammates.\n\n\"He was an unbelievably gifted, jumping out of the gym,\" Dirk Nowitzki recalls. \"He was good with us, he just -- I don’t know. He never really found his role, but there were games where we were either up big or down big and he would come in and get 10 points within three, four minutes. I mean, I guess you could see it then already how explosive he was.\"\n\nGreen doesn’t know why Dallas didn’t work out or why he found himself jobless the following fall. \"Maybe I was still too young,\" he says. \"I don’t know.\"\n\nGreen spent the next two years in Russia, but his lowest point of his career came in China in 2012. Green played four games for the Guangdong Foshan Dralions before he was cut because his team had lost all four, even though he was averaging 27 points. Out of options, Green returned to the States and entered the D-League.\n\n\"Gerald was humiliated,\" Williams says. \"He was humiliated. I know he was. But he never said nothing about it to me. He just said, ‘Coach, I had to go through something and now I’m back.’\"\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images"
