        "text": "BOSTON — Gerald Green spent part of his summer driving around a flood-stricken Houston looking to help those stranded in the wake of Hurricane Harvey — even soliciting the donation of a boat on social media.\n\nNow Green is planning to help bring some cheer to his hometown in a different way after the two-time former Celtics forward signed with the Houston Rockets in time for Thursday night’s game at TD Garden.\n\n“You all know how I feel about Houston,” Green said before the game. “Especially with everything that Houston had been through this summer, for me to be a part of this team, and how they’re playing right now, this definitely was my Christmas gift.”\n\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens said he got a chance to talk with Green before the game and was pleased his former player found a good landing spot — to an extent.\n\n“He fits perfect for how they play,” Stevens said. “I wish they would have waited until [Friday after the game in Boston]. But I’m really happy for Gerald.’’\n\nGreen made his return to the Celtics last season nearly 10 years after the former first-round pick was included in the package to acquire Kevin Garnett from the Minnesota Timberwolves. He was in and out of the rotation throughout the regular season before reemerging in a surprise way when Stevens inserted him into the starting lineup with the Celtics down 2-0 in the first-round playoff series against the Chicago Bulls.\n\n“He’s a big reason why we advanced out of the first round,” Stevens said. “I thought [it was] him starting in that Bulls series, and spreading the floor, and being able to guard up a spot. He was matched up against [Nikola] Mirotic. I think we can all recognize it was no easy task. Mirotic is an accomplished guy.”\n\nWhile Green appreciated the sentiment, he deferred credit on the playoff series comeback.\n\n“He’s being modest,” Green said of Stevens. “Obviously, the way he was able to make adjustments Game 3 and Game 4, throughout the rest of the playoffs, was big for us as well.”\n\nGreen said he has no hard feelings that Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge and the team did not make a great effort to re-sign him this summer.\n\n“Things ended good in Boston,” he said. “They made a lot of changes to the roster this year. And it’s for the better. They are the No. 1 team in the East and they’re doing well. Things, for me in Boston, did not end badly.”\n\nGreen wound up signing with the Milwaukee Bucks this summer, but before he left for training camp, he felt the need to jump into action during the disaster caused by Hurricane Harvey.\n\n“When you see the neighborhood that you grew up in being underwater,” Green said, “either you can sit down and look like everybody else, or you can get up and go try to help somebody that needs to be helped.”\n\nHe thought he would be helping the Bucks contend against the Celtics in the East this season, but said a day after he’d been told he’d made the team he was informed that the Bucks were going in another direction. He said he tried to stay active in the gym, getting up shots and playing pickup games, before the call from the Rockets finally came.\n\n“It’s been kind of tough,” Green said, \"but tough people last.”\n\nHe said he was surprised by all the changes in Boston for a team that earned the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference and made the conference finals, but added that Ainge always has a plan.\n\n“Danny Ainge is a genius, man,” Green said. “He knows what he’s doing. Every year he makes changes that nobody knows [how they’ll work]. But, for some reason, they are always successful the next year.”\n\nAround the rim\n\nMarcus Morris returned to the lineup Thursday after sitting out Wednesday’s game in Charlotte. Playing for a second time in three games on his troublesome left knee, he remained under a minutes restriction of approximately 20. Jaylen Brown (knee) and Semi Ojeleye (back) remained out. Brown went through shooting drills on the court while wearing a brace before the game. But Stevens said he has yet to simulate game speed. ... The Maine Red Claws — the Celtics’ G-League affiliate — traded for 2013 No. 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett on Thursday. While the move does not necessarily move the Celtics closer to bringing him to Boston, he will work under their system while in Portland."
