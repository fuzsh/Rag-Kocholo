        "text": "The writer Gerald Green, who has died at 84, was best known for his multi-million-selling book Holocaust (1978), derived from his controversial television saga. He was adept at telling grittily humane tales whose social issues fill hundreds of pages and, at their best, have a pace and ear for dialogue often lacking in avowedly literary novels.\n\nGreen was born in Brooklyn, where his father was a doctor. After studying at Columbia University he served in the US army in Germany during the war and, returning to Columbia, took another degree, in journalism. After several years' agency work, he moved to the NBC television network, for which he wrote and produced many topical programmes.\n\nHe had already written a historical novel with Lawrence Klingman; far better was his own The Last Angry Man (1956). Across its 500 pages, Green alternated a version of his television career with his father's medical work through the 20th century: ratings-hungry Woody Thrasher spots a newspaper report about Brooklyn doctor Samuel Abelman, who rescues a girl from rape in a district pervaded by gangs, addicts and a neighbour trying to poach his custom. Here could be a new television series, America, USA, in which \"we can bring them to life far beyond the power of a rewrite man's slovenly prose\".\n\nThe cantankerous, Thoreau-reading Abelman has his doubts, succumbs and, aided by his nephew Myron, relates a career which includes supervision of those locked in Bellevue hospital's prison wards. If, in depicting the rise of nazism as the city's tribal behaviour writ large, the novel sometimes verges on the ponderously moral, the acerbic Abelman carries it along, with all the brio of a Jimmy Porter. The novel - soon filmed with Paul Muni - brilliantly catches a city where people who have slogged for decades live alongside those who came \"in droves and they outslicked the city slickers, simply because they were better at make-believe\".\n\nMedicine recurs as the basis for To Brooklyn With Love (1967), and in The Chains (1980) Abelman reappears at the birth of somebody who lifts the eponymous family from its racketeering origins. Rather different is The Hostage Heart (1976), told in almost real time while a surgeon's team is held at gunpoint during an operation while the patient's associates come up with $10m for a gang. It is preposterously convincing, unlike The Healers (1979) or Karpov's Brain (1983).\n\nAlso an amateur archaeologist, Green used his interest in The Lotus-Eaters (1959), whose hero recalls war experiences on a Florida dig while his wife is shed of her puritanical leanings and more by a public relations man with designs on the site. No stylist per se, Green nailed such moments in adroit phrases, while marshalling many characters.\n\nThis butressed his work on Holocaust for NBC. The transatlantic cast of this nine-hour series included an early appearance by Meryl Streep as a member of the Weiss family, who do not realise what is brewing in a Berlin symbolised by a lawyer associate now in the SS. It drew an audience of 300m around the world. If no more a masterwork than the spin-off novel, it did - like Roots - alert many people to something of which they were ignorant, especially when eventually shown in Germany, where the statute of limitation on Nazi criminals was then lifted.\n\nThat was no mean achievement for a writer. How dismaying, then, that Green's score of novels - including a charming fantasy about a dog, Girl (1977) - are out of print. He is worth exploring. He is survived by his second wife, Marlene, whom he married a year after the 1979 death of his first, Maria, with whom he had three children."
