        "text": "BOSTON â€” The Houston Rockets have signed veteran swingman Gerald Green.\n\nGeneral manager Daryl Morey announced the signing Thursday a few hours before the Rockets played at Boston, where Green played 47 games last season. Green, 31, was wearing No. 14 on the bench for the Rockets, who were without point guard Chris Paul for the third straight game with a left abductor strain.\n\nThe No. 18 overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft out of Gulf Shores Academy in Houston, Green has also played for Minnesota, Dallas, Brooklyn, Indiana, Phoenix and Miami. He was cut by the Milwaukee Bucks at the end of training camp. He has averaged 9.6 points and 2.4 rebounds in 544 career NBA games.\n\n[relatedlinks]"
