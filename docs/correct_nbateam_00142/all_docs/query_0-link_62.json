        "text": "Gerald Green and his hometown Houston Rockets are staying together.\n\nThe Houston native has agreed to a one-year deal at the $2.4 million minimum, a person familiar with the terms tells The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal cannot be signed until the NBA’s moratorium ends on Friday.\n\nGreen averaged 12.1 points last season for the Rockets, who finished with the NBA’s best regular-season record. He had five games of 20-plus points off the bench last season.\n\n[relatedlinks]"
