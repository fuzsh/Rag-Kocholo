Green originally signed with the Rockets on Dec. 28, 2017 and averaged 12.1 points over the remainder of the season.  He hit the third-most 3-pointers of any reserve in the league over that span. For the season, Green averaged 2.7 3-pointers made in 22.7 minutes per game.  No other player in NBA history averaged more than 2.5 3FGM in fewer than 25.0 mpg in a single season.",
