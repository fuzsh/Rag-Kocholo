        "text": "HOUSTON — “That’s four, damn!”\n\nAt the same time the Houston Rockets formally announced that free agent Gerald Green had re-signed with the team for another year, the 33-year-old forward was going through a corner 3-point shooting drill at Shadow Creek High School’s gym. He had missed the final of five shots and was angry at himself, in typical Green fashion.\n\nBy late July, it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid sweating profusely — whether it’s from the Houston heat and humidity or a grueling workout. Three-and-a-half hours in, Green’s T-shirt was completely drenched. Waiting closely behind him for their turn to shoot were Danuel House — his teammate and the other half of the “GreenHouse effect” — and Jazz forward Royce O’Neale, all under the watch of trainer Kenny Ellis.\n\nSimply put, Green hates messing up. If he misses a shot during a drill, he wants to start over. If he loses in the one-on-one games after practice, he’ll make sure you run it back. Failure isn’t in his DNA, and it’s a large reason why he has stayed in the NBA for over a decade.\n\n“For sure,” Ellis said in acknowledgment of Green’s mindset. “I think regardless of his age, his main focus is going into this new season with an opportunity for more consistency. So with him, the frustration is knowing what he’s capable of doing and wanting to perfect that craft. We understand that it comes with timing. But at the end of the day, it’ll all get worked out.”\n\nHe’s motivated by his last poor playoff performance, a difficult period in which his game time was cut in half from the previous season, and his shooting fell across the board, averaging just 3.5 points on 30 percent from the field, 34 from 3 and just 18 from two.\n\nGreen hit three consecutive shots, and a slight smirk emerged. Progress. He had to use the bottom of his shirt to wipe the perspiration dripping from his forehead and eyes. Before the session ended, the trio engaged in strikeout, a last-man-standing one-on-one drill. They were accompanied by his brother, Garlon Green, among a few others who had been in the gym at the time.\n\nAt this point, Green was locked in. One by one, he got the upper hand on all who stepped up.\n\n“That’s great D, outstanding!” Green exclaimed after blocking House’s shot. For the potential game-winning shot, Green caught the ball on the right elbow, being guarded by O’Neale, as Ellis counted down.\n\nFive … four … three … two … one …\n\nGreen spun around, pulled up for a fadeaway, and knew it was good before the shot even passed through the net. “’08 and still got it! ’08 and still got it, man, this is what I do,” he said as he trotted off the court.\n\nGreen sat down with The Athletic on July 22 to discuss why he returned to Houston, his excitement for new teammate Russell Westbrook, his rap career and more.\n\nI remember last season you and I talked about your love for rap and some of the unreleased heat you had, and this summer we’re seeing some of that music come out. Is it just you becoming more comfortable with yourself and being able to express yourself?\n\nDefinitely. You know I honestly just really wanted to work at it a bit. It’s always been a hobby of mine, especially growing up in the Houston area, man, you know a lot of dudes are like serious freestylers and shit like that. I didn’t want to just come out being raw, even though I felt like I’m so raw when it comes to that lane. I just really wanted to work on that, but it was kind of hard during the season. Do you know what I mean? Because (I’m) staying focused on basketball. Sometimes I have an off-day, but you know I had to watch film, and by the time I do all that and get my extra work in, I’ll be tired and don’t wanna go to the studio. So it was just different, but obviously, in the offseason and the beginning of the season, I was able to take a little break, focus in on that. Kinda just worked on some of the old stuff, some of the new stuff and just being able to come. That’s what got me — when I was able to get comfortable, I could go back in like, “All right, I feel like I’ve gotten better since last year.”\n\nWell, as you’re well aware, the NBA and the world of hip-hop have been intertwined for a long, long time. Can we expect more of this in the future from you and some others?\n\nI think so. I think it’s gonna be like that in the future, man. I really think there’s gonna be more guys venturing off into that lane. Every day we work out, we’re listening to music or it’s always different hip-hop artists coming to our games. It’s always different athletes going to hip-hop concerts and stuff like that. So I think they intertwine with each other. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone like myself or any of these guys or any guys in the future do something or make a lot of noise when it comes to music.\n\nEarlier today, the Rockets formally announced that you had re-signed for another season. What exactly does that mean to you, knowing this is going to be your 13th season, and you’re 33 years old?\n\nMan, I’m so thankful for this organization! Not only thankful for the organization but thankful for the city for embracing me throughout all these years. A lot of people can’t even go back home and get that type of love that they get even in their hometown, so for me to get the type of love in my own city, and the organization wanting me back, means a lot to me.\n\nThese workouts are long and sweaty. We don’t usually see NBA players change a decade-plus in, but is there any one specific thing you want to work on this offseason? Any goal or target for you heading into next season?\n\nReally, man, I just want to be a more efficient shooter. Just being able to get a bucket off one or two dribbles, being able to knock down wide-open shots no matter what the situation is. Off transition, off open shots, off double team kick-outs, off catch and shoot, off handoffs, whatever it is … corner 3. Every time I play I just want to be able to knock down an open shot, so just be more consistent and knock down more contesting shots because I’m always shooting those. I just want to be more consistent.\n\nWhat about on the other side of the ball?\n\nI want to be a better rebounder, so I’ve obviously just been working on different little things and different little techniques trying to get my lower body stronger, just trying to work on all aspects of my game. Obviously, defensively, I feel like last year, didn’t really necessarily say I took a step back, but I wasn’t the best. I know I could’ve done more defensive-wise. I feel like I’ve gotten better as a defensive player since I got to the Rockets guaranteed, but I know I can do more, and I will do more this year.\n\nThe NBA landscape is constantly changing, but is it a good thing a contender like Houston is electing to stay together and keep the core the same? What about your new teammate Russell Westbrook?\n\nHell, yeah, hell, yeah, man. I love what we’re doing. Don’t get me wrong I love CP, man, and you know I really think CP is the type of point guard that doesn’t get a lot of credit for the things he does within the organization. The type of impact he has on the organization, everybody just focuses on if we’re winning or not, and that always doesn’t look that bad on him, but when he was with the Rockets it was an honor to get to play with him. He was one of the best point guards I’ve ever played with. And no knock to the ones I’ve played with in the past, but he’s just been one of those guys for me that I truly feel that way. I’ll always be a friend to him, and I’m happy for him. Chris Paul gets paid $40 million a year; I mean he’s made enough money to be able to take care of his family. I know for him he just wants to be able to compete for the championship, and he’s not over — he still got a lot of basketball left in his tank. The future is bright for him and if not, he’s had a hell of a career. He’s a Hall of Fame guy and you know what, I’m pretty sure a lot of guys respected the career that he’s had. I don’t think it’s over for him. I don’t think it’s that, he got to turn a situation that he didn’t want into one that he’s gonna always cherish. So I have nothing but good things to say about CP, he’s always been a cool guy to me and I wish him nothing but the best at OKC.\n\nAt the end of your workout, you yelled “’08, still got it!” Is that a testament to everything you’ve done over 12 years?\n\nFor sure, for sure, man. Honestly, I feel like I’ve been slept on, man, I really have. The Rockets are the only ones that really banked on me. That’s why I feel like I’m so fortunate and so grateful for this organization and this city. Everybody keeps sleeping on me, man, but the Rockets don’t. I’m just trying to do the best job to make sure Daryl Morey looks good, Mike D’Antoni looks good, I want to make James Harden and Russell Westbrook look good, make D. House look good. I’m just trying to make my teammates look good, make my family look good and make my fans look even better.\n\n(Top photo: Keithrick Denson / Two3Films)"
