        "text": "Phoenix Suns' Gerald Green goes from a big jump to a step back\n\nIt is not the best sign for the Suns that their most popular player is an occasionally hot reserve guard who fell out of favor and the rotation.\n\nFans and Green feel justified in thinking he should have never had his role reduced. Green had made 129 consecutive appearances since joining Phoenix until he was benched for a Jan. 30 home game (Green rattles off the date by memory) against Chicago. The unexpected move had people thinking Green had been traded when it was really a staff decision for fear of Green's suspect defense against All-Star Jimmy Butler.\n\nThe Suns won and moved to 28-20, the pinnacle of their season. Since then, the Suns are 11-18 with Green appearing in 22 of those games and averaging 14.7 minutes in them.\n\nThe Suns probably would not have beaten Utah on Saturday night if Green had not had his best scoring game (24 points) since November. He played his most minutes (22) since Feb. 20, when the Suns were shorthanded after three trades. The Green light was only a flash. Had he been this kind of shooter regularly, his role would not have diminished in a 41 percent shooting season.\n\n\"In the beginning, I thought I was playing better than last year but I guess other people thought otherwise,\" said Green, who started 48 games, averaged 15.8 points and made 40 percent of 3-pointers last season. \"It hasn't been the same (since the Chicago game). I ain't gonna lie. It's been frustrating because I know I can help win.\"\n\nGreen said more than that during Saturday's game, telling teammates that they would be in the playoffs had he been playing more in the past 2Â½ months. He admits that the Jan. 30 benching affected his psyche but it was not the start of his playing-performance issues.\n\nGreen already was not shooting as well and having familiar defensive troubles. When the Suns went to a three-point-guard lineup more to accommodate the top players, Green got the squeeze. When the Suns made three Feb. 19 trades, playing time was there for the taking again and Green could not secure it, going 4 for 28 on 3s over a month (Feb. 26-March 25).\n\nSuns coach Jeff Hornacek spent that time searching for a scorer to step up.\n\nPHOTOS: JAZZ AT SUNS\n\n\"He never really seemed to get it going and then it comes to the point where, if you're not scoring and if your defense isn't picking up, it's hard to stay in the game,\" Hornacek said.\n\n\"The next guy is going, 'I needed help here and the guy wasn't here.' We're trying to develop something for the future, not just being out here for everybody to play in the game. We want to get to a top-notch winning level and you've got to do it on both sides.\"\n\nGreen used to scowl every time he was pulled from a game but he has taken his part-time role well, becoming one of the bench's more outward supporters. Inside, it is worrisome for Green. He is about to become a free agent. Free agency has meant Green ending up in Russia, China and the D-League in the past.\n\nEven after it all, the 29-year-old still said he would rather re-sign with Phoenix and retire with the Suns. This is the first time Green has played successive years with the same NBA team since his first two seasons with Boston (2005-07).\n\n\"I want to be here but I just don't know if they want me here,\" Green said. \"Because if you want somebody, you show them. I didn't think I was playing that bad and now we're here.\"\n\nThe Suns have a four-game trip and playoff elimination coming before one final home game on April 14 against San Antonio. The calls for \"Put in Green\" and \"We want Green\" will come, especially from anyone donning the four-fingered foam hand that honors Green.\n\nHe is frustrated but enters the game ready to burst like a jack-in-the-box. When not playing, he encourages and celebrates his younger teammates. He knows what a breakthrough feels like after finishing fourth in Most Improved Player voting last season, just two years after being cut in China.\n\n\"I feel like I could've helped a lot more than I did this season,\" Green said. \"Those decisions weren't up to me. If I play, I'll go out and give it my best. I don't really get excited about games any more because I don't know if I'm going to play. These type of games don't excite me any more. They don't give me confidence.\n\n\"I don't want to get too excited because I know the next game I might not play.\"\n\nThe Heat Index can be reached at paul.coro@arizonarepublic.com or (602) 444-2470. Follow him on Twitter @paulcoro.\n\nTuesday's game\n\nSuns at Hawks\n\nWhen: 4:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Philips Arena, Atlanta\n\nTV/radio: FSAZ/KMVP-FM (98.7)."
