        "text": "The Houston Rockets are waiving veteran wing Gerald Green, sources tell ESPN's Tim MacMahon.\n\nHouston is currently hard-capped and had limited options to keep the former first-round pick. Guard Chris Clemons' season-ending Achilles injury likely cost Green his roster spot as the team is required to guarantee the former's 2020-21 salary per NBA rules.\n\nGreen missed the entire 2019-20 campaign after undergoing surgery to repair a broken bone in his left foot.\n\nThe 34-year-old played a valuable role off the bench during his second stint with the Rockets, averaging 10.3 points and shooting 36% from deep.\n\nGreen posted 11.5 points per contest in a pair of preseason appearances for Houston."
