        "text": "Gerald Green, whose high-flying dunks have electrified Nets fans since the team signed him out of the D-League after the All-Star break, has agreed to a contract to remain with the team the rest of the season, the Nets announced today.\n\nGreen, a 6-foot-8 forward and one-time first-round draft pick and NBA All-Star weekend slam dunk champion, has scored in double figures in each of the past five games for the Nets, getting 16 Saturday in the loss to New Orleans, a team-high 14 Friday in the loss to Orlando and a game-high 26 Wednesday in the win over Toronto. In 11 games with the Nets, he has averaged 11.7 points per game.\n\nGreen had played so well, in fact, that Nets coach Avery Johnson had said last week it was possible he might eventually earn himself a spot in the starting lineup.\n\nGM Billy King said in a radio interview Friday he was talking with Green’s agent about possibly signing Green to a two-year contract, which would have kept him with the team for the rest of this year plus next year.\n\nThe acquisition of 6-foot-7 forward Gerald Wallace on Thursday at the NBA trade deadline squelched the chance of Green becoming a starter, and the Nets either changed their mind or the two sides weren’t able to come to an agreement on a two-year deal.\n\nBut on Friday, Green said he was less concerned about the details of how long he would be signed for and more appreciative of just being in the position that the Nets wanted him at all.\n\n“I’m kind of blown away because I just never thought I’d be in the situation I am now,” he said. “I’m very thankful for everything that’s come to me.”\n\nGreen, 26, was the 18th pick overall by the Boston Celtics in 2005, but after two seasons with them — including the 2006-07 year, when he won the dunk contest — he was traded to Minnesota as part the deal that brought Kevin Garnett to Boston.\n\nThe Timberwolves played Green sparingly and eventually traded him to his hometown Houston Rockets, who released him after a few weeks.\n\nAfter playing for Dallas in 2008-09, Green played in Russia the next two seasons before going to China last fall. Cut by his Chinese team in December, Green went to training camp with the Los Angeles Lakers, but he didn’t make the team and ended up playing in the D-League with the L.A. D-Fenders. That is where he was when the Nets signed him to a 10-day contract Feb. 27.\n\nGreen said he doesn’t know why teams shied away from him after he left Dallas, but he refuses to focus on that.\n\n“Whatever it is, I’m here today,” he said.\n\n“As far as what was happening the last (three) years, I don’t know. I just tried not to just quit. Because sometimes I did have a tendency to think that I would never be back. ... I would never be wearing an NBA logo. I just thought that it’d never happen. Everything just seems like it’s coming so fast — it’s almost like it’s faster than my rookie year.”\n\nColin Stephenson: cstephenson@starledger.com"
