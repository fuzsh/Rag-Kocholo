        "text": "You can officially cancel that missing persons report on Gerald Green. The guy Brad Stevens was hoping he could have in his quiver to fire at opponents went for 19 points in 19 minutes last night.\n\nThe same Gerald Green who had sat on the bench for the entire game by coach’s decision 13 times since Nov. 18 and been out with a hip issue for two others received a mostly standing ovation when he exited the 113-103 victory against Memphis.\n\n“I never had a standing ovation before, I don’t think, so for me to have one at this day and age in my career, man, that was something special,” he said.\n\nAnd yes, the same Gerald Green who came to the Celtics as a 19-year-old draftee out of high school in 2005 before beginning a circuitous route back to the Hub is now nearing his 31st birthday and is legally allowed to use the term “day and age.”\n\nWhen he played in just 13 of the first 28 games, and generally insignificant minutes at that, it looked as if his day would not really come here. But that seemed to take a turn last night. Sure, Green played a critical supporting role in the Christmas Day win in New York, but as was the case with his previous two appearances, his presence on the floor was mainly the product of Stevens seeking to inject a shot of adrenaline into a sleepy offense.\n\nLast night, Green was a real and bona fide member of the rotation. The Celts attack was doing just fine early on. This was not a “break glass in case of emergency” call for help.\n\nThis was Stevens wanting to keep a good thing going. This was the coach recognizing that Green had earned a bigger gig.\n\n“Yeah, I think that’s really fair,” Stevens said. “I think, you know, we talked about it at the start of the season. He had some injury issues, and then you’re trying to play a fast-paced game while learning a new system on the fly basically without any practice time. That’s hard. I think he’s more comfortable in how we’re trying to play on both ends of the court, and he brought great energy. And then obviously we needed every one of his 19 points (last night). I thought he was really good.”\n\nNow it would seem he will have to play himself out of it to land back among the splinter set — not that he’ll say that.\n\n“That’s coach’s decision,” Green said. “That’s why I’m glad I’m the player and he’s the coach. Right now, the most important thing is that we’re winning games. Whatever rotation that he throws out there, as long as we win games and keep getting better as a unit, keep getting better as a team, that’s the most important thing. It doesn’t matter who plays or not.\n\n“I know it’s a tough time, man, because there’s a lot of people on this team that can play, so there’s always going to be somebody that’s unhappy, you know what I mean?”\n\nLast week, Green was that “somebody.” He had shown rust in Memphis when he played for the first time in two weeks.\n\n“It’s hard to get in a rhythm when you don’t even know when you’re getting to play,” he said before the next game. “And then it’s kind of tough to get in a rhythm when you do play, you’re only playing, you know, you can count your minutes on one hand. So it’s tough. I’m not really used to it, but it’s something I’ve got to go through right now. I’m not used to just sitting like this, but whatever coach wants me to do, I’m going to do. I’m not going to second-guess him at all.”\n\nLast night, Isaiah Thomas was saying it would be foolish to second-guess Green’s ability.\n\n“He’s one of the best scorers I’ve seen in the NBA,” said Thomas, a teammate of Green in Phoenix a few years ago. “Whether it be practice or games, it only takes one shot for him to feel like he’s on fire. He can help us, really. Coach is pointing in his direction, and he took advantage of his opportunity the last few games that he’s played.\n\n“What he did (last night), that’s what he does. I mean, he comes off the bench and gives a spark and he gives us energy.”\n\nThere was Green, pulling down three offensive rebounds and getting into passing lanes and pushing the pace at every opportunity.\n\nAnd there he was midway through the fourth quarter with the Celtics in fairly tight quarters with the Grizzlies, tracking down a long offensive carom in the right corner, then taking the rock to the rack. He went by Tony Allen and used his body to protect the ball from Zach Randolph as he double-clutched and scored.\n\n“I don’t like to put it on any one guy to live up to that kind of night every night,” Stevens said, “but I think the bottom line is that he certainly is capable of that. And I talked about in the preseason (that) he’s a guy that, when he gets into a rhythm, you have to be wary of if you’re the opponent. I felt that way when we were coaching against him, and he’s had an impact — a big impact — on the last two games.”"
