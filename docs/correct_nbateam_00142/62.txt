Houston Rockets assistant coach Gerald Green is unretiring and plans to sign in the G League.

There are a lot of opportunities these days with so many players in the protocols, so Green couldn’t help himself. An NBA contract could be just around the corner once he gets his wind back in the G League, but this isn’t something fantasy managers need to monitor for now.

The Rockets have waived Gerald Green.

Houston is hard-capped and Chris Clemons’ (Achilles) contract is guaranteed, so Green falls victim to the roster squeeze here. He looked good this preseason, averaging 23 points on 65.2 TS%, so he might get a look from contending teams who need some bench scoring. He could also return to Houston at some point later this season, but for now, he’ll be looking for a contract and is safe to ignore in all leagues.

Gerald Green has signed a one-year deal for the minimum with the Rockets.

It’s a non-guaranteed deal for Green, so he will have to make the team during training camp. Green sat out the entire 2019-20 season with a broken foot but is out to prove that he still has something left in the tank at age 34.

Multiple teams were said to be interested in signing free agent Gerald Green prior to the NBA’s return to Orlando, but Green decided not to play in the restart.

Green, who didn’t play this season due to a foot injury, is expecting a child in August and decided not to sign with a team for family reasons. But there appears to be a pretty good chance he’ll be on an NBA roster at the start of next season.

Gerald Green (foot) said he hopes he will be “ready to go by the end of this year, maybe towards the playoffs.”

Green underwent surgery on his left foot in late October and was expected to be sidelined for approximately six months. Even if he is medically cleared late in the season, he’ll have no fantasy value. He should be left on waivers in all formats.

Gerald Green will be out for approximately six months as he rehabilitates the broken left foot that was operated on Monday.

With that timeline Green’s 2019-20 season is essentially over before it even began, but there is a small chance that he’d be available for the postseason. Danuel House, already part of the rotation, will be asked continue to produce as he has to begin the season (11.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 3.0 3-pointers and 1.5 assists per game).

Russell Westbrook had 23 points, seven boards, six assists, four steal and one 3-pointer on Wednesday, going 9-of-20 from the field and 4-of-4 from the line.

The Rockets are just 6-5 in their past 11 games and tonight they had to navigate the absence of Austin Rivers (illness), in addition to Eric Gordon (right knee surgery) and Gerald Green (left foot fracture). Westbrook and James Harden (55/8/3/2/2 tonight) have been scintillating, though, propelling the Rockets to a 16-8 record. Westbrook came in with near-triple-double averages over the past few weeks, and Cleveland is in assists allowed to opponents (26.2 per game), so the only surprise is that he didn’t have even more dimes.
