Netscape’s What’s Related Service

One possibly underused facility in the Netscape browser is its What’s Related feature. When viewing a Web page, clicking on the What’s Related button in the Netscape toolbar (shown in Figure 1) will display related information about the page being viewing.

The information displayed by use of the What’s Related service is illustrated in Figure 2. As can be seen a number of related Web sites will be displayed. In addition information about the Web site will be displayed, including its popularity, the number of pages on the Web site and the number of links to the Web site.

About The What’s Related Service

What’s Related is a feature of Netscape Communicator that is designed to “help you figure out where to go next when you’re surfing the web or drilling for information”. By clicking on the icon ion the toolbar you can see sites that provides information or offers products and services that are similar or connected to those offered by the site that you’re currently viewing. You can go directly to a related site by selecting one of the links in the drop-down menu, or select the Detailed List to see a web page with a list of related sites.

Figure 1: Netscape’s What’s Related Service

The What’s Related data is created by Alexa Internet. Alexa uses crawls the Web to create and categorise related Web sites for millions of web URLs. Alexa uses links on the crawled pages to find related sites. The day-to-day use of What’s Related also helps build and refine the data. As the service is used the requested URLs are logged. By looking at high-level trends, Netscape and Alexa can deduce relationships between Web sites. For example, if thousands of users go directly from site A to site B, the two sites are likely to be related.

Once all the relationships have been established and the links have been checked, the top ten related sites for each URL are chosen by looking at the strength of the relationship between the sites.

Each month, Alexa recrawls the web and rebuilds the data to pull in new sites and to refine the relationships between the existing sites. New sites with strong relationships to a site will automatically appear in the What’s Related list for that site by displacing any sites with weaker relationships.

Figure 2: Netscape’s What’s Related Service

Note that since the relationships between sites are based on strength, What’s Related lists are not necessarily balanced. Site A may appear in the list for Site B, but Site B may not be in the list for Site A. Generally this happens when the number of sites with strong relationships is greater than ten or when sites do not have similar enough content.

As an example of this difference in content, consider the relationship between several major Internet sites: Netscape is a browser and server software company as well as an Internet portal, so the What’s Related list will contain a mix of these types of companies. When visiting a “pure” Internet portal, you might see Netscape Netcenter in the list; however, when you visit Netcenter, you might not see that “pure” portal in the Netcenter What’s Related list because several other browser and server software companies are included along with the related Internet portals.

Further information about Netscape’s What’s Related service is available on the Netscape Web site [1]. A What’s Related FAQ is also available [2], from which the above description was taken.

It should be noted that Netscape’s What’s Related service was an early example of an RDF application. Brief information about the implementation in Mozilla is available at the Mozilla Web site [3].

Survey

On 21st and 23rd October 2000 the What’s Related service was used to obtain information for the main server hosted by UK Higher Educational Institutions, based on the HESA list [4].

Information on the popularity of the Web server, the number of pages on the Web sites and the number of links to the Web site were recorded. Links to the What’s Related service for each institution are provided in the survey data, allowing the current information to be obtained.

Findings

A summary of the popularity data, numbers of pages on Web site and numbers of links to Web server is given below.

Popularity

The five most popular Web servers, based on the information provided by Netscape’s What’s Related Service, is given in Table 1.

Note that it would be interesting to compare the information on the number of links to the main institutional Web servers with the survey carried out in March 2000 using ALtaVista which was published in Ariadne issue 23 [5].

Related Pages

As might be expected the related pages for University Web sites were often other University Web sites (especially other Universities within the region or Universities beginning with the same letter) as can be seen from Figure 4.

Figure 4: What’s Related For The University Of Bath

It was interesting to note that many Universities were seen to be related to the Graduatebase.com Web site [6].

A number of other interesting relationships were observed, some of which are summarised below.

Table 4: Examples of Related SitesInstitutionRelated SiteCheckBradfordRelated to a Greek Web siteTry itOxfordRelated to Yale and HarvardTry itCambridgeRelated to Dalhousie University, Halifax, NovaTry itRoyal Veterinary CollegeRelated to The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh and the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of LiverpoolTry it

It should be noted that the relationships are provided for the Web site and not for individual Web pages. So, for example, if you are viewing a page on nuclear physics which is hosted on the institutional Web server, the What’s Related information will provide links to Web sites which are related to the institutional Web server, and not to the pages on nuclear physics.

This provides an argument for hosting departmental and project pages on their own domain rather than on the institutional Web server. As can be seen from Figure 5, which shows the What’s Related links for the DESIRE project [7], more relevant links can be provided in such cases.

Figure 5: What’s Related For The DESIRE Project

This argument for hosting departmental and project pages on their own domain does not, of course, address the maintenance and support issues.

Discussion

The success of the Google search engine [8] has demonstrated the effectiveness of citation analysis for finding relevant resources - a resource is given a high rating if there are many Web sites which link to the resource. Although Netscape’s What’s Related Service does not seem to be widely used (possibly due to Netscape’s uncertain future following the AOL / Time Warner takeover deals) it may be useful to monitor developments in services which use citation information.

The What’s Related Service is interesting since it not only uses the link information provided by Alexa [9] (which in turn uses the Internet Archive service [10]) but, since it is integrated within a Web browser, it can also make use of end user browser patterns (resource A is related to resource B not only becuase there are hyperlinks between A and B, but also because many users follow the link).

The figures on the popularity of Web sites, the numbers of pages on the Web site and the numbers of links to the Web site are, of course, open to various interpretions. Further work remains to be done.

Appendix 1: Survey Results

The Netscape What’s Related service was used to analyse institutional Web servers in UK Universities. The survey was carried out on 20 and 23 October 2000.

The following table contains details of the survey. Column 2 gives the name of the institution and a link to the institutional web server. Column 3 gives the information provided by What’s Related service on (a) the popularity of the institional Web site, (b) the number of pages on the site and © the number of links to the site. This column also has a link enabling you to obtain the current details for the site. Column 4 provides a link to Google’s Find Similar service.
