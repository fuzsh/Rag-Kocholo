Access & Use Browser Breakdown New Versions Offer Security Enhancements & More Personalization Features W eb browsers appear to be simple software. You open your Internet connection and type a Web address to open a Web page in your browser. The process is simple enough. Obviously, though, the inner-workings of a Web browser are more complex. Web browsers have all sorts of features, including tools to save your most recently visited sites and features for viewing content offline. The newest utensils in browsers are personalization features that can help you make the most of your Internet experience. And the features keep coming. Microsoft and Netscape have both recently released upgraded versions of their browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. Some of the less popular types of browsers available, including Opera, have upgraded versions, too. The new features don't involve must-have components in every instance, but they do involve some components that are key to improving security or that enhance the browser's capabilities. Internet Explorer 5.5 Typically, when a software company releases a major upgrade to a version of software, it gives it a new version number to the left of the decimal point. When the changes are less drastic, the software company changes the number to the right of the decimal point. Microsoft's new browser version, called Internet Explorer 5.5 And Internet Tools, came out in July 2000. Even though it wasn't different enough to warrant a completely new version number, it does contain a few new features for developers and consumers alike. When Microsoft released the software, some j reviewers criticized the company for not incorporating enough new features in version 5.5, especially because the beta (or testing) version of the software came out in January j 2000. Six months of testing is almost an eternity when browser software is concerned and especially when the visible new features for consumers are rare. However, Internet Explorer j 5.5 has plenty of new benefits for developers. Developer Tools. Most consumers proba¬ bly won't use most of Internet Explorer 5.5's new features, such as its ability to display text in a vertical layout, even though these tools will benefit them in the end. Web page developers, on the other hand, should find their jobs easier to do thanks to the newest version of Internet Explorer, which includes better support for DHTML (Dynamic Hypertext Markup Lan- j guage, a specification that uses style sheets and additional scripts, along with Hypertext Markup Language to create more interactive Web pages). HTML editing. Developers can more ! easily create WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) pages by editing pages directly through Internet Explorer 5.5 using the browser's new HTML editor, called MSHTML. Consumers can use MSHTML, as well, when viewing Web pages. For instance, a consumer could use the editor to create a personalized product to order through a store's Web page. Improved design. When Web developers design Web pages for use with Internet Explorer 5.5, the pages will be able to contain more tradi¬ tional design elements such as the ones in print¬ ed media. The new version has improved sup¬ port for CSS (cascading style sheets, which are style sheets that can be applied to multiple Web , pages instead of one), which lets page designers incorporate design elements such as large initial capital letters, pop-up windows, navigation but¬ tons, drop-down menus, improved magnifica¬ tion capabilities, and customized scroll bars. Most of these elements will benefit consumers in the end, making Web pages easier to use and 4 Newest Web Tools / Learning Series Access & Use navigate by making them more like traditional Windows-based software. Designers using Internet Explorer 5.5 now also can more easily design pages for Chinese and Japanese traditional text, which uses a vertical text layout. With previous versions of Internet Explorer, such design elements weren't possible or were extremely difficult to create. Improved framing. Users will notice that loading pages with frames in Internet Explorer 5.5 is much speedier. Microsoft estimates such pages should load 30% to 75% faster than they did with previous versions of the browser. The reason for this is Internet Explorer 5.5 lets developers display multiple frames within a single copy of the browser software. In previous versions, each frame on the Web page contained a different copy of the browser software, which occupied more of your sys¬ tem's resources and slowed the computer's processing. Another new feature is that developers can make the pages within frames transparent, which means they can place images in the background. Improved streaming media. By incorporating some of Internet Explorer 5.5's new features, develop¬ ers more easily can create Web pages that use more multimedia elements. The new version of the browser can achieve better synchro¬ nization of streaming audio and video, allowing for a smoother playback within the browser window. Downloaded multimedia elements should load and run more quickly, as well. In the Print Preview window, you'll see exactly how the Web page will look when you print it, including the location of the page breaks. This is a handy paper-saving feature, especially if you want to print only a small portion of the Web page. The toolbar across the top of the Print Preview page lets you control the image. Click the Page Setup button (the second button from the left) to set the margins or change your docu¬ ment from a portrait layout to a landscape lay¬ out. You also can change the header and footer information printed on each page from the Page Setup dialog box. Unfortunately, you still must use coding to create the effects you want in the headers and footers. For instance, the &u code will print the Web address for the page. Click the question mark (?) button in the Page Setup If you find yourself often using this especially handy Internet Explorer 5.5 tool, you can make it easier to access by adding it to your Web browser's toolbar. Right-click the toolbar and click Customize. Highlight Print Preview on the left side of the Customize Toolbar window. On the right side of the window, highlight the location on the toolbar where you want the new button to appear. The Print Preview button will appear to die left the highlighted button on the toolbar. Then click the Add button followed by the Close button. According to Microsoft, the Print Preview feature was one of the most requested features from customers after the release of Internet Explorer 5. Most Internet Explorer users will find this new feature alone well worth the work to download Internet Explorer 5.5; the other features and im¬ provements are bonuses. (Cynics would note Nav¬ igator has incorporated a Print Preview command for a few years alf eady.) However, if you're a Navigator user, and you didn't find enough features in Internet Explorer 5 to cause you to make the switch, Internet Explorer 5.5 probably isn't going to make you want to switch, w. The Web was supposed to hasten the advent of a paperless society, letting us electronically move documents from location to location. Even though moving documents through Web pages is extremely easy, we still insist on printing those Web pages. We might feel guilty about wasting paper—especially when we know the documents are going to be on the Web site indefinitely—but we do it anyway. Internet Explorer 5.5 makes printing those Web pages easier (if not quite guilt free), thanks to its new Print Preview command. Click the File menu followed by Print Preview to use this feature. than two hours if you use a dial-up connection and a 56Kbps. dialog box and click the Header or Footer field to see a list of the codes you can use. If the Web page contains enough informa¬ tion, it will split into more than one printed page. To view each of these pages, use the arrow buttons in the middle of the toolbar. Toward the right side of the toolbar, you can shrink or magnify your view of the Web page, ranging from 10% to 500% of the original size. The largest magnification setting will help you see the sharpness with which graphics and text on the page will print; the smallest settings let you view several printed pages at once in the Print Preview window. Click the Print button to open the Print window and print the Web page. In the Print dialog box, you can select certain pages to print. Click the Close button to close the Print Preview window without printing. . We found the new version to be extremely easy to down- load and install. The entire process took less than two hours using a dial-up modem. You can download Internet Explorer 5.5 from the Microsoft Web site (http://www .microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/ie55 .htm) for free. You also can order the product for $10 on a CD through an order form on the browser's home page or by calling (800) 485- 2048. For more information about Internet Explorer 5.5, check out Microsoft's Web site at http://www.miCTOsoft.com/windows/ie. Netscape 6 At the time of this writing, Netscape 6, the latest version of Netscape Navigator, was still in beta testing, with the final version due out late in 2000. Even though we didn't have a chance to test the final version for this story, Learning Series / Newest Web Tools 5 Access & Use Find Your Browser Version T o find out which version of your Web browser you’re using, open the browser window, click the Help menu, and select the About command. The version number should be along the top of the window. In most cases, you can ignore the digits listed to the right of the first or second number after the decimal point. With Internet Explorer, you can click the Update Information link in the middle of the About window to see whether any upgrades are available for your browser version. □ the beta was extremely impressive, containing several new features that will benefit consumers. Customization. The My Sidebar feature incorporated in Navigator 6 is impossible to miss; it resides along the left side of the browser window and contains numerous helpful tools. My Sidebar gives you access to several important Web functions, such as a search engine, stock prices, instant messaging, news, and more while keeping the main portion of your browser windows free for load¬ ing Web pages. You can even person¬ alize the information in the My Side- bar area, which Netscape describes as a \"skinny Web page.\" You can choose to use My Sidebar's default layout and features, or you can customize My Sidebar to meet your needs by clicking the Add button and Customize Sidebar. The new version of Navigator gives you the ability to manage your e-mail accounts more easily through Navigator Mail. You can manage each Web e-mail account you have with a separate folder, which lets you easily sort all your e-mail messages. In addition, you can send messages from any of your registered e-mail addresses. Users wanting to view Web pages in their native language, rather than En¬ glish, can use Netscape 6's AutoTranslate feature to make the translation. Click the View menu and select the Translate command to begin the process. Corporate users and developers can alter Netscape 6's menus and buttons so they can prevent'employees from accessing certain aspects of the browser. Integration. Users will like Netscape 6's ability to give them one piece of soft¬ ware for performing several Internet functions, such as Web browsing, e-mail management, and instant messaging. For Web page developers, Netscape 6 should provide a vehicle for creating Web pages that incorporate a wide variety of industry stan¬ dards. The browser fully complies with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) stan¬ dards, giving developers the chance to use less code to create pages that work well with the major browsers. One drawback to this indus¬ try compliance is Netscape 6 may not recog¬ nize some of the nonstandard HTML that pre¬ vious versions of Navigator could read and display. Designers might need to rework pages containing some nonstandard HTML to give Netscape 6 the ability to read them properly. Security Features. Cookie files are often a confusing and frustrating aspect of using the Internet. However, Netscape 6 should help a little with the management of cookie files, which are files a Web site stores on your computer to help track your personal information. Many sites use cookies to load your personalized set¬ tings for the site. (Some industry experts worry that companies also can j use cookie files to track j users' browsing habits without their knowl¬ edge.) Through Net¬ scape 6, you can choose to accept or reject cookie files, which is a feature I similar to past versions of Navigator. However, you now can instruct Navigator to remember your cookie preferences on a site-by-site basis. Password manage¬ ment is much easier j with Netscape 6 than i with previous versions of the browser software, too. Netscape 6 gives you the option of having the browser remember user names and passwords for various Web sites. You also can choose to have the browser remember some passwords but not others. (Internet Explorer 5 already offers this feature.) In addition, a master password | used within the Netscape 6 browser protects your password list. ■ Simplicity. Although the trend for soft¬ ware packages as they evolve is\" to become more complex and squeeze more buttons and icons onto the screen, Netscape 6 has tried to make its interface more simplistic. Users will notice fewer visible buttons in the standard window. The cleaner look should help users find the features they j want more quickly, and it lets users view a larger portion of the Web page in the Web I browser window. - Along with this streamlined look, Netscape has compiled a less complex browser engine, giving Netscape 6 the ability to quickly load several types of Web pages. Critics criticized Navigator 5 for containing too many slow-working features. Netscape 6 incorporates easier search functions, too. Instead of loading a search engine Web page, you can type your search phrase directly into Netscape 6's URL address field and click Search. Netscape 6 uses Netscape Search, avail¬ able through Netscape Netcenter, for its directory search and technology from Google for its keyword search. If you prefer to use a different search engine, Netscape 6 lets you select the search engine you prefer by clicking a link after you complete the original 6 Newest Web Tools / Learning Series Access & Use search. Your search results remain in the My Sidebar window, regardless of which pages you load into the main browser window, giving you easy access to the search results 1 no matter which links you follow. The Search menu at the top of the Netscape 6 window lets you quickly find any of several reference tools, such as addresses, phone ! numbers, product information, or maps. For [ instance, you can access an online thesaurus at any time through the Netscape Search menu, t This feature is extremely handy ... or conve- I nient... or practical. (You get the idea.) | B Installation. We installed the beta version of Netscape 6, Preview Release 2, and it was easy to download and install. The ! entire process required less than two hours, i Before you decide to download any beta soft¬ ware, though, keep in mind that such soft- | ware often contains bugs. After all, it is in the I testing stage, and its developers are looking ' for users to find any bugs that they need to f correct before the release of the final version. In addition, most beta versions expire after a certain time period, meaning you must download the full version later anyway. Technical support usually isn't available for , beta versions, either. When Netscape releases the final version of j Netscape 6, it should be available for a free j download at Netscape's Web site (http:// I home.netscape.com/browsers/6/index.html). ] Previous versions of Navigator have been ! available for purchase on CD for $10, but at i the time of this writing, it was unknown j whether Netscape 6 would be available for j purchase on CD. We found Netscape 6's Preview Release 2 to be an extremely impressive upgrade, offering a wide variety of features. Even the staunchest Navigator-hater will have a hard time not finding something to like in this version. Users of previous versions of Navigator almost certainly will want to download the impressive final version, when Net¬ scape releases it. Internet Explorer users will want to look at Navigator 6, too. For more information on this browser, visit Net¬ scape's Web site at http://home.netscape .com/browsers/index.html. Opera 4.02 Opera 4.02 doesn't attempt to market itself as a browser containing dozens of features, most of which the average user won't ever use. Instead, Opera attempts to keep its feature list simple, making it work more quickly to display Web pages. Opera also works well on older computers, and it runs on a variety of computing platforms. Opera 4.02 offers several improvements over the previous version of Opera, including e-mail management and 128-bit encryption for improved security. If you need complex e-mail management features, Opera 4.02 probably still won't meet your needs, but it works well for managing basic e-mail accounts. The new version of Opera lets you accept and reject cookies based on the Web site from which they originate, just as Netscape 6 does. Another nice feature of Opera is the ability to auto¬ matically delete all cookie files as soon as you close the browser's window. With the new fea¬ tures, Opera 4.02 runs a little slower than previous versions, but it still requires much less storage space and runs more quickly than Internet Explorer 5.5 and Netscape 6. B Installation. Downloading and in¬ stalling Opera 4.02 was extremely easy. Because it is streamlined software, the down¬ load and installation process required less than 30 minutes, and we used the Java- enabled version. Downloading and installing the non-Java version should take less than 10 minutes. You can download Opera 4.02 for a 30-day free trial from Opera's Web site (http://www .opera.com/download/index.html). If you want to continue using Opera beyond the trail, you must register the software and pay a $39 fee (at the time of this writing). Upgrades to previous versions of Opera cost $15. You cannot order a copy of Opera 4.02 on a CD, but you can choose to pay for the registered software through the com¬ pany Web site or by telephone, fax, or mail. Because Opera is based in Norway, though, paying for the soft¬ ware other than by credit card through the Web could be a hassle. Opera 4.02 offers some nice improvements over previous ver¬ sions, and the upgrade price isn't overwhelming. (For more informa¬ tion about Opera, visit the Opera Web site at http://www.opera.com.) However, it's tough to recommend a fee-based browser when you can obtain Microsoft's or Netscape's browser for free. @ by Kyle Schurman WebTV’s Enhancements I f you don’t use a traditional browser for surfing the Web, you probably use WebTV. To improve your browsing capabili¬ ties, Microsoft introduced a few new features in the summer of 2000 . One new feature is the ability to access instant messages through the Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger service. You can share instant messages with other WebTV users and MSN Messenger users. This feature includes support for a “buddy list,” as well as blocking features for preventing unwanted messages. WebTV also has improved support for the RealAudio and Windows Media Player formats, which should give users improved performance from streaming media through the Web. Microsoft added support for a few new printers, too. Late this fall, Microsoft is expected to roll out its new interactive TV service: UltimateTV. It will offer improve¬ ments over WebTV, including digital video recording and inter¬ active television. Using a new computer chip in the set-top box, UltimateTV users will be able to record two programs at once or play along with game shows, among other features. (NOTE: WebTV users with older receivers may not be able to take full advantage of these enhancements ) \\; Learning Series / Newest Web Tools 7 Access & Use Look, Ma, No Wires Gadgets That Help You Stay Connected In The Wireless Age I t's one of the strange paradoxes of modem life that the more we move, the more we need to stay in touch with what we leave behind. Fortunately, a whole crop of wireless Internet devices make it possible to not merely cope with this contradiction, but to revel in it. You now can get the information you want regardless of where you are, and at a price that compares favorably with the wired con¬ nectivity alternatives. ■ Wireless Tools. Wireless connectivity begins with one of five pieces of hardware: a pager, a phone, a PDA (personal digital assis¬ tant), a handheld computer, or a notebook (portable PC). You must have one of these devices if you plan to send and receive Internet content. That seems simple enough, right? Well, as wireless technology evolves, it becomes increasingly more difficult to spot the differences among these five platforms. Today, you can find pagers with keyboards, handheld devices that function as phones, phones that function as PDAs, and notebooks that do it all. In the midst of such change, perhaps the best way to find a wireless device that meets your needs is to look at them all. Pagers. Pagers that connect to the Internet for the purpose of sending and receiving digital messages are called two-way pagers. Each of these tiny plastic devices is smaller than a pack of playing cards and has an integrated wireless communications mechanism, similar to a radio transmitter, that maintains a perpetual connec¬ tion to a wireless network. When it's turned on, a two-way pager is in constant communication with the wireless network. Relevant incoming signals are processed by the pager's built- in microchip; a buzz, tone, on-screen message announces the presence of new data. Outgoing mes¬ sages transmit back across the wireless network to their destinations, typ¬ ically at speeds of less than 6,400bps (bits per second). Although the ability to send and receive elec¬ tronic messages is the core function of a two-way pager, it is the device's extended capabili¬ ties that make it so useful. For example, most two- way pagers now offer some form of message management. This function gives you an effective means of organizing your incoming and outgoing messages. Many pagers also contain a small amount of built-in memo¬ ry, as well as personal information management software, which lets ] you create and store schedules, address books, , and personal lists on the pager. Moreover, many wireless paging networks now partner with content providers to deliver j stock quotes, sport scores, news headlines, and other tidbits of information directly to j your pager throughout the day. Finally, to make the process more enjoyable, pager man¬ ufacturers have recently devised several design improvements that make the pagers j easier to use. Many pagers have built-in key¬ boards and scrolling wheels, for instance. Two-way pagers also offer multiline displays j with backlighting, support for simple graphics I and images, infrared data ports, and audible J alarms. Price is definitely the biggest drawback to j two-way paging. Because of their enhanced functionality, two-way pagers cost substantial- ! ly more than traditional pagers. Expect to pay j as much as $350 for a robust twp-way pager from a reputable manufacturer, such as j Motorola or Compaq. For the same amount, you can get a decent handheld computer or a 1 top-of-the-line Internet-enabled cellular phone. Once you have a two-way pager, however, I the cost of using it is quite reasonable. All you I need is service with a wireless ISP (Internet I service provider), such as GoAmerica (http:// I www.goamerica.net), PageNet (http:// j www.pagenet.com), or SkyTel (http:// J www.skytel.com). Monthly fees are generally j $10 to $30 and are based on the amount of data I transmitted to and from the pager. SkyTel's SkyWriter service, for instance, costs $24.95 I per month for 10,000 characters of transmitted text, plus $0.10 for every 10 characters after j that. Similarly, GoAmerica's Go.Lite plan 1 charges $9.95 per month for the first 25KB j (kilobytes) of transmitted data, plus $0.10 per j kilobyte after that. Internet phones. Internet-enabled cellular j phones, also called Internet phones, have I become all the rage in the past year or so. These phones essentially put the power of the Internet in the palm of your hand. You can use them to read complete news articles, get dri¬ ving directions, access Web sites, receive stock updates, check airline schedules, send e-mail messages, and perform a host of other tasks. That's just for starters. With a little more band¬ width and a bit more functionality, Internet phones could be used to conduct financial ] transactions, order groceries, pay freeway tolls, play digital music files, change the chan¬ nel on your TV set, and store all your medical 8 Newest Web Tools / Learning Series Access & Use records. It's easy to see how they could become the most important computing device of all. Phone manufacturers recognize this poten¬ tial and have begun in the past year to develop products that explore the boundaries of phone technology. The pdQ smartphone from Kyocera Wireless, for instance, is based on the Palm Computing platform, putting PDA func¬ tionality in an Internet phone. Motorola's StarTAC Mobile Organizer is a clip-on device that attaches to Motorola StarTAC phones for the purpose of providing personal information management services to the phone. The Motorola Timeport P8167 doubles as a wire¬ less modem, and the Sprint PCS Touchpoint 2200 supports voice activation. You can expect to see similar innovations from phone manu¬ facturers in the future. With so many recent hardware develop¬ ments, it's now time for the content to catch up, says Jay Highley, vice president of the business customer unit at Sprint PCS. Content providers must find ways to deliv¬ er business-oriented information and ser¬ vices to Internet phone users. \"We've created very robust infrastruc¬ tures and databases, and we can provide incredible access to important, mission-crit¬ ical information,\" Highley says. \"The prob¬ lem is that you have to be at your desktop to get it. The wireless Web for business is about extending that information to the palm of your hand. We'll deliver content that's relevant to the business customer so that the phone becomes a productivity tool.\" Whatever the content, Internet phones are rather easy to understand. When you want to connect to the Internet, you launch the phone's minibrowser. The minibrowser is basically a gateway through which you access Internet content at a speed of approximately 14.4Kbps (kilobits per second). The minibrowser doesn't look like Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, or whatever Web browser you use on your desktop or notebook comput¬ er. Instead, the phone's minibrowser consists of a bland text menu of content options. Shortly after launching the minibrowser, your Internet connection is active. The cost of accessing Internet content through a cellular phone is a combination of a flat monthly fee for the service and a per- minute charge for actual usage. You can mini¬ mize the cost by purchasing a service package that includes a certain number of minutes at a set price. Sprint PCS, for instance, gives you 700 minutes of phone time (to be used for either telephone calls or Internet access) for $69.99. After adding in the fee of $9.99 per month for wireless Web usage, you pay less than 12 cents per minute. If you use more than 700 minutes in a month, you pay 25 cents per minute for the extra usage. As you can see, the best deal is to choose a plan that covers your expected needs. The typical price for an Internet phone ranges from a low of less than $100 all the way up to $300 or more, depending on the features you want. You can buy Internet phones direct¬ ly from a cellular service provider, such as Sprint PCS (http://s6.sprintpcs.com/store) or Verizon Wireless (http://www. verizon wireless.com); from a phone manufacturer; or from a third-party retailer, such as ROXY.com You might want to consider a single service subscription when you need to support multiple wireless devices. For example, you can use the GoAmerica wireless service with both a pager and a handheld device. (http://www.roxy.com). You might have to pay a phone activation fee of approximately $25 when you first sign up for service. To off¬ set this cost, ask the service provider about any rebates you may qualify for. Handheld devices. Internet connectivity is just starting to become a feature of handheld computers and PDAs. It's about time. Until recently, only a handful of handheld devices (term used to include both handheld comput¬ ers and PDAs) were capable of performing basic online tasks, such as sending and receiv¬ ing e-mail messages, tracking stock portfolios, and accessing Web data. Sure, they were use¬ ful for all sorts of offline activities, such as tak¬ ing memos and storing addresses, but without support for network connectivity, these devices risked being displaced by the latest generations of full-function Internet phones. Internet access for a handheld computer and PDA is possible in one of two ways. The device either contains an integrated wireless modem or it provides an external connector into which you can plug a wireless modem. If it has an integrated wireless modem, as the Palm VIIx does, you don't have to take any extraordinary measures to access the Internet. Just turn on the handheld device and open the Internet application to establish an active Internet connection. If, on the other hand, the device doesn't have an integrated modem, then you need to take stock of its external connector to deter¬ mine exactly what type of modem you should get. Every device requires something different. The iPAQ H3600 from Compaq, for instance, supports a proprietary PC card expansion pack that fits a handheld device like a plastic sleeve. Once you have the expansion pack, you can plug any compatible PC Card device, including a wireless modem, into the iPAQ. Conversely, the Palm V from Palm uses a special snap-on modem from OmniSky. You can expect to pay $200 or so for a handheld device, plus $300 or more for a wireless modem and other necessary Internet-related accessories. (Note that you might be able to get a hefty rebate on your modem purchase if you sign a year-long contract with a wireless service provider.) Handheld devices that have an integrated modem cost more than those that don't, but the price is almost always less than paying for a handheld device and a modem separately. In any case, connectivity is achieved simply by activating the device's Internet applications. No dial-up is needed, and trans¬ mission speeds typically peak at approximate¬ ly 19.2Kbps. That might sound slow, but it's actually more than adequate for transmitting e-mail messages, news articles, stock quotes, and other text data. Until a significant portion of handheld devices provide support for full- color graphics and motion video, the low- bandwidth transmission limitations won't cause a problem. To get Internet connectivity for your hand¬ held device, you need to do two things. First, you must select a wireless modem that works with your handheld device (if you don't own a compatible modem already). Read the users manual or contact the manufacturer to find out which modems are available to you. Have the name and model number of your handheld device handy when you call. Some devices only support one type of wireless modem, and you need to know which one that is. Second, you must sign up for Internet ser¬ vice with a wireless service provider, such as Learning Series / Newest Web Tools 9 Access & Use GoAmerica or OmniSky. Monthly service with a wireless provider will cost between $40 and $60 per month, based on unlimited usage with¬ in the specified coverage areas. OmniSky, for example, provides wireless service in more than 115 metropolitan areas in the United States for a monthly rate of $39.95. OmniSky subscribers enjoy unlimited wireless service as long as they stay within any of those coverage areas. Subscribers who venture outside the cov¬ erage areas will be unable to access the service. Notebooks. The communications activities that take place on a notebook are often more demanding than those that take place on other communications devices. You may use your notebook to look at large color images of prod¬ ucts you want to buy, for example, or you may use it to send a database of potential clients to a distant colleague. These sort of Internet-relat¬ ed tasks would be difficult, if not impossible, to conduct on a pager, Internet phone, or handheld device. Unfortunately, the present state of wireless Internet access makes it quite tedious to access graphics-laden Web sites, large data files, and streaming multimedia content on a notebook. Peak throughput rates of 19.2Kbps, which are adequate for PDAs, Internet phones, and pagers, just aren't robust enough to accommodate nor¬ mal mobile computing functionality, says Jeff Morris, director of marketing for Sierra Wireless. \"Today, wireless access is useful and func¬ tional,\" Morris says. \"You can check your e- mail. You can access a Web site. But you wouldn't want to be surfing the Web. When high-speed wireless networks become avail¬ able, they will be just like the high-speed net¬ works you have in the office. This will open up new wireless applications, including many that we don't even think of today.\" Until then, notebook users must modify their online habits. Limiting the size of file attachments and using a browser's offline browsing features are two ways of dealing with a slow Internet connection. Another option is to sign up for wireless service that has been opti¬ mized to perform at artificially faster transmis¬ sion speeds. The Sprint PCS Enhanced Internet Connection service, for example, uses data compression technology to mimic 56Kbps transmission speeds on a digital network. Try not to get too gloomy about the state of wireless access for notebooks. High-speed networks are on their way. The most notable is the Metricom Ricochet network, which promises wireless Internet access of 128Kbps in 41 U.S. cities by next summer. You can prepare for this network by purchasing a Ricochet-compliant wireless modem and checking with the Metricom Web site (http://www.metricom.com) to see if high¬ speed wireless service will be available where you need it. The best way to purchase a wireless modem for your notebook is to get one through a wire¬ less service provider. Why? Because the wireless market currently supports several network stan¬ dards, including CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), CDMA (Code-Division Multiple Access), and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications). Ricochet will be another such network. When purchasing a wireless modem, you must get one that supports the wireless net¬ work you're planning to use. Instead of buying a product to match the network, it's easier to choose a network that offers coverage in the places where you work and travel. Then pick up the service provider's recommended modem. Not only will you avoid access problems by shopping this way, but you'll probably get the modem for much less than its retail price. As far as price goes, you can expect to pay nearly $500 (not including rebates) for a wire¬ less modem from any of the major manufac¬ tures, including Sierra Wireless or Novatel Wireless. The modems typically come in sever¬ al formats, but PC cards are preferred because they're small and have no cables. Wireless Internet service, available through companies such as Metricom or AT&T Wireless (http://www.attws.com), typically costs $50 to $60 per month for unlimited usage. ■ Gadgets Galore. The push for faster access, wider coverage, and more device func¬ tionality has resulted in the development of some unique wireless gadgets that will defi¬ nitely wow your neighbors and increase your productivity. We've gathered some of the most impressive ones we could find. You'll be amazed at what some of these devices can do. AirCard 510 Sierra Wireless (877) 231-1144; (604) 231-1100 http://www.sierrawireless.com Thanks to a special data compression technology called BlueKite, the AirCard 510 ($399,. direct from Sprint PCS) is able to transmit data at speeds that compare to those of a 56Kbps modem. The only catch is that you have to use the modem on the Sprint PCS wireless network. iPAQ BlackBerry W1000 Compaq (800) 888-0220, (281)370-0670 http://www.compaq.com Just to show how far pagers have come, Compaq advertises the iPAQ BlackBerry W1000 pager ($399, direct from Compaq) as a wireless e-mail solution. That is definitely a fit¬ ting description for the device, which features a built-in keyboard, message organizer, and a function for synchronizing data with Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Domino. iPAQ H3600 Compaq (800) 888-0220, (281) 370-0670 http://www.compaq.com The iPAQ H3600 ($499 MSRP) gives you a color display, one-touch access to the calendar and contacts database, and a built-in voice recorder. Plus, it provides Internet access via add-on Expansion Packs ($39 for Compact Flash and $149 for PC Card, both MSRP). These packs, which are essentially plastic sleeves into which you slide the iPAQ, support any PC Card or Compact Flash wireless modem. Merlin Wireless PC Card for Ricochet Novatel Wireless (888) 888-9231,(403) 295-4800 http://www.novatelwireless.com The next big thing for wireless access is high bandwidth, and this modem delivers it—just as soon as the Metricom Ricochet network becomes available (pricing is not available yet, either). You can buy the PC Card modem soon, but you will have to wait until summer for the Ricochet service to begin. When coupled with service from Sprint PCS, the AirCard 510 NSJJ A from Sieira Wireless provides Internet access at rates that mimic 56Kbps (kilobits per second). 10 Newest Web Tools / Learning Series Access & Use have only recently begun to provide wireless Internet Minstrel V from OmniSky is retrofit¬ ted for the Palm V, * fitting just like an auxiliary battery pack on the back of the device. Minstrel V wireless modem OmniSky (800) 860-5767, (650) 969-7700 http://www.omnisky.com The much-discussed snap-on modem from OmniSky ($299, direct from OmniSky) fits onto the back of the Palm V, providing instant Internet access to the handheld device. The modem provides access to the Internet at a rate of 19.2Kbps via a digital network. Nokia 7100 Nokia (888) 665-4228, (972) 894-5000 http://www.nokia.com You know this phone was designed for Web access as soon as you see the Navi Roller, a miniature roller incorporated into the face of the phone. You can spin the roller up or down to scroll through the contents of a Web site. Unfortunately, the Nokia 7100 is not yet available in the United States (its price isn't available, either). A similar phone, the Nokia 7110, is currently available in Europe, Africa, and Asia. PageWriter 2000X Motorola (800) 548-9954 http://www.motorola.com The first thing you'll notice about the PageWriter 2000X ($399.99, from PC Zones at http://www.zones.com) is its miniature key¬ board, which lets you type entire messages for transmission to PCs, fax machines, telephones, or other pagers. The pager can synchronize with your PC, and it offers full message management capabilities, including confirmed message delivery. In addition, PageWriter 2000x has a built-in scheduler, notepad, and alarm clock. Palm Mix Palm (800) 881-7256, (408) 326-9000 http://www.palm.com The Palm VIIx ($449.98, from PC Zones at http://www.zones.com) is currently the only handheld device that has an integrated modem. That's not the best part of Palm VIIx connectivi¬ ty, though. What's really impressive is the wide array of Web clipping applications (software that delivers only the important data instead of all content from a Web site) available for the Palm VIIx. pdQ smartphone Kyocera Wireless (800) 349-4188, (858) 882-1410 http://www.kyocera-wireless.com Internet phones on the market today of Internet functionality. The Nokia 7110, for instance, even has a proprietary roller for scrolling through Web content. The pdQ smartphone ($799.99, from Sundial.com at http://www.sundial.com), which developed by QUALCOMM (http:// www.qualcomm.com) and sold to Kyocera Wireless along with the rest of QUALCOMM'S consumer phone division, has the unique dis¬ tinction of being based on the Palm computing platform. The phone definitely looks and acts like a Palm pocket organizer. It has a date book, address book, e-mail client, and mini- j browser. It even allows data input using Palm's proprietary . Graffiti handwriting software. But dang, it's expensive! StarTAC clipOn Organizer Motorola (800)331-6456 http://www.motorola.com You can turn any Motorola StarTAC Internet phone into a handheld device just by attaching it to this clip-on module ($99, direct from Motorola). The device, which is approximately the same size and shape of an auxiliary bat¬ tery pack, adds scheduling and message organizing capabilities to your phone. It also provides a data synchronization function for synchronizing data between the phone and your PC. Timeport P8167 Motorola (800) 331-6456 http://www.motorola.com Talk about multipurpose. When coupled with Motorola's Data Connectivity Kit ($149.99, direct from Motorola), the Timeport P8167 Internet phone ($249.99, direct from Sprint PCS) actually doubles as a wireless modem for your notebook. The connectivity kit contains TrueSync Software and all the cables and software you need to plug this phone (or any of the 12 other supported phones from Motorola) into your notebook. Touchpoint2200 Sprint PCS (800)480-4727,(816)759-2300 http://www.sprintpcs.com The Touchpoint 2200 ($229.99, direct from Sprint PCS) is unique for two reasons. First, it allows you to record up to four minutes of voice memos and messages for playback at a later time. Second, it supports voice activation. You can dial numbers, view the scheduler, or access any of your bookmarked Web sites just by talking to the phone. ■ What’s Next. You can bet your analog modem that wireless Internet access and ser¬ vices will only get more popular as time goes on. Whether it's integrated into a pager or a boat, wireless technology has innumerable applications that promise to have a positive effect on real life. All that's needed is high bandwidth, and that's on the way. ITsl by Jeff Dodd Hands-free wireless Web browsing is a reality with the Touchpoint 2200 from Sprint PCS. The recent addition of extended functions, such as voice activation, to wireless devices has given the wireless market a boost. Learning Series / Newest Web Tools 11 Access & Use Free ISPs Will They Replace Paid Services? I f you talk to people who work for free Internet ser¬ vice providers (ISPs), you rapidly get the impression that the biggest news in the com¬ puter industry is the impend¬ ing demise of pay dial-up ISPs. Why pay twenty-some dollars a month, the argument goes, when you can get all the Internet connectivity and fea¬ tures you could want, for free? Naturally, that point of view is the source of some controversy, with many paid ISPs such as America Online betting the free companies won't survive long term. Nonetheless, the free ISPs are working hard to be competi¬ tive with paid services. And some ISPs, such as Earthlink and Juno, are hedging their bets by offering both paid and free options. ■ The Price Of Freedom. According to representatives from several free ISPs, there's still skepticism among users as to whether an online connection service can really be free. Yes, it can. But while no money is involved, you do pay by giving the ISP other items of value. Those items are your on-screen real estate and some information. When your free ISP is running, a small portion of your screen is taken over and devoted to advertising. Usually, the advertising appears as part of a control panel. The control panel offers a variety of buttons that will take you around the service. Clicking one button may bring up your e-mail, for example, while another will bring you your local weather report or retrieve a stock quote. Another may launch a search engine or take you to shopping sites. But no matter what you do, that miniature billboard appears in the center of it all. In this regard, the ISP is free in the same way that broadcast television or radio is free. It may cost money, but advertisers pay the bill in exchange for a chance to get their messages in front of you. As NetZero's Brian Woods expresses it, \"We'll let you go where you want to go and see what you want to see, but we'll show you commercials.\" He's quick to point out, though, ISP ads are unlike broadcast commercials in that they don't stop the show. While many are tastefully designed, other ads use garish colors, animation, blinking text or flashing backgrounds in an ongoing attempt to wrest your attention from your work. Just as with television, the ads run the full range of good, bad, and ugly with their designers often either forgetting or ignoring David Ogilvy's dictum that you can't irritate people into buy¬ ing your product. The only way around,the ads is to learn to visually tune them out. Control panels are pro¬ grammed to always appear on top of whatever you have displayed on your monitor. There is no covering them up with other windows. Jim Shissler, of AltaVista, says that AltaVista has worked hard to add functionality to its control panels to make them as convenient as possible for users without short-changing the advertisers. Other companies have done the same. Panels can be reduced to take up less screen area. The ads remain the same, but the controls may be smaller and such additional informa¬ tion windows as stock tickers may be closed. Most panels are now dockable, so that you can move them to whatever part of your screen is most convenient and lock them into place there.- Control panel ads aren't the only advertising you'll face on a free ISP; they are merely the most relentless. Move to any page on the ISP's own site and the odds are that you'll find a banner advertisement there as well. But those ads can be left behind. When you access any other page oh the Web, you'll see those pages just as they were designed to be. Some will have ads, some won't, but ________ yoiir ISP won't impose any on ; you beyond the limits of its own site. IPpRsfIp-‘ Ads may appear in other ways, though. When you log on to NetZero, for example, you may find a 30-second tele¬ vision-like ad playing while your service loads. And per¬ haps a pop-up ad will invite you to visit some other site when you click to log off. ■ The Annoyance Factor. Just how obnox¬ ious these ads are depends on several factors, including your own ability to ignore them. At least some of the free ISPs do understand that they won't keep you as a user if you find the advertising more inconvenient than a paid ISP's monthly bill for twenty dollars or more. NetZero, for example, uses software able to deliver ads to highly targeted markets. To the advertisers, that means their ads will be sent only to those most likely to be good prospects. To you as the user, it means that if you have to be on the receiving end of adver¬ tising, at least you'll see ads about things like¬ ly to interest you. It works like this. In signing up for NetZero, you provide a good deal of information about yourself and your interests. So if you let them know that you're a 38-year-old divorced male with no children, interested in football, elec¬ tronics and motor sports, you probably won't see the banner ad for Auntie Bev's House of Disposable Diapers by Mail. Your 27-year-old sister with the newborn, though, just might. NetZero can target ads by a number of fac¬ tors, doing in many ways what direct mail marketers have been doing for years through 12 Newest Web Tools / Learning Series postal mail. Even locality can be taken into account, making it practical for local business¬ es to advertise over an ISP. Your local pizzeria | wouldn't want to pay the national rates to t reach hundreds of thousands of customers far | beyond its delivery area, but they can afford to send you a banner ad suggesting you not cook tonight and get two extra toppings free. I Getting To Know You. This, of course, is where the other form of payment comes in— [ information. Free ISPs want to know a lot 1 about you and what you do because that is i what makes them so potentially valuable to f advertisers. It's not merely the space for them to run an ad, but the knowledge of what l types of users click on which types of banner : ads and go to which types of links. When you sign up for a free ISP, expect to answer a lot of questions. I Among the information com- j monly required are your • name, age, and address; date f of birth; gender; educational | level; income range; types of i cars you own; whether you rent or own your home; how often you shop online and | what types of items you buy; | what your recreational activ¬ ities are; what types of publi¬ cations you read; your mari¬ tal status; ages of children ! living with you and how much you spend on your average phone bill. This is the sort of information used | to determine which ads get j to you and which would be a waste of your time and the advertiser's money. But this is just the beginning of information collection. Your ISP is likely to track the j amount of time you spend online, what sites you visit, how much time you spend there, what links you click on, etc. Some of this infor¬ mation is used by the ISP to improve services, and some may be passed along to advertisers. Keep in mind that when we talk about advertisers getting information about you, that does not necessarily mean information about you personally. \"Users should understand that all the infor- J mation advertisers get from NetZero is in i aggregate,\" Says Woods. \"They know that so many people with certain interests visit their j site, but names are never attached.\" Shissler is just as emphatic in discussing AltaVista's dedication to user privacy, point¬ ing out that they, too,, have one of the most stringent privacy policies on the Internet. What this means is that advertisers may get information telling them that, of all the people who clicked on their link on a given day, 247 were female cat-owners in their 20s with col¬ lege degrees and annual incomes of $35,000 or more. But they have no idea who any of those 247 women are, nor do they have any informa- 'tion that will let them figure out whether you are among them. It's quite possible for an ISP to provide information that can, in theory, be traced back to you. Not necessarily just by name, address¬ es, or phone number but also by information that identifies individual computers. They can track the_use of a specific computer online and tell the advertiser that a computer which is now browsing their web site is the same com¬ puter that visited the site of Chef Arno's Cookware Emporium Web site last Thursday before spending two hours at the site of RazzTazz Exotic Undies. The details on how much information is col¬ lected, how it's used, and- who gets to see it is spelled out in the ISP's Privacy Policy. It's a legally binding agreement between the ISP and the user, so be sure to read it before you sign up for any service. (NOTE: Some companies reserve the right to change their privacy policies, as Amazon.com recently did. If you are very con¬ cerned about the privacy of your information you may be better off avoiding any online services or companies that require you to provide it.) Keep in mind that the fact that a policy is approved by an outside certification company such as TRUSTe does not mean that your information is being kept private. It means that the certification company has made reasonably sure that the ISP is being honest in telling you how your information is collected and used. Although companies like AltaVista and NetZero take great pains to assure that your personal information isn't shared with third parties without your approval, remember that when you sign up for services provided by outside partners, you are giving permissions to share whatever information is required to per¬ form that service. For example, Juno has a partnership with Snapfish, a service that allows you to get your film developed, receive free prints and a free online photo album. Obviously, this service is not possible unless Snapfish also has some of your personal information. Your ISP cannot be responsible for the privacy policies of those third par¬ ties. So make sure you see what partners might have access to your information and check out their privacy policies as well before you sign up for outside services. ■ Is It Worth It? If you dislike the idea of having companies watch over your shoulder, a free ISP is proba¬ bly not for you. You may, however, be the sort of per¬ son who enjoys taking mar¬ keting surveys and having a voice in how things change. Or perhaps you have no objection to your online habits being known as long as no name is attached to your information and you can remain reasonably private. Maybe that adver¬ tisement sitting at the top of your screen does not bother you either, or you're at least willing to rent out the space for a $20 a month savings. In that case, a free ISP is a bargain. \"A lot of people are concerned about the idea that you get what you pay for,\" says Woods. But he points out that the free ISPs can deliver all the features and benefits people get from paid services. The only difference is that, thanks to the advertising, somebody else is paying. In most areas that seems to be true. In the realm of customer service, though, there's Learning Series / Newest Web Tools 13 Access & Use significant variation among providers. Alta Vista, Juno, and NetZero, for example, all have 24-hour telephone technical support available with response times in no way infe¬ rior .to what we've seen with America Online or other national ISPs. AltaVista, however, was the only ISP that offered totally free per¬ sonal support with a toll-free call. NetZero doesn't charge for the support but does require what will be a long-distance call for most users; a call in the 805 area code in the United States, or the 613 area code in Canada. Juno charges $1.95 a minute for live telephone technical support for its free Internet service. Not everybody needs live telephone technical support, of course. NetZero offers downloadable help files, an online support area answering common questions and sup¬ port by e-mail. Should you need help and not have time to wait in the queue for standard telephone support, immediate help is avail¬ able 24 hours a day for a fee of $14.95. That's not to say that you should expect a long wait at the basic support number. As with all tech¬ nical support services, the wait time can vary greatly, but when we called the wait was only about two to three minutes. Juno offers online help areas as well as free support by e-mail, although it's primarily an automated service. AltaVista, on top of online help files and support by e-mail, offers, answers to the most common problems in .recordings accessible through their telephone support service. Should you need to talk to a live tech support person, however, it's easy to choose that option. While at first look it seems as though free ISPs can't afford to deliver the same level of customer service as their for-pay counterparts, there is a growing awareness within the indus¬ try that they cannot afford not to. The NetZero * staff, for example, likes to draw an analogy to dating and marriage. When you're married, the thinking goes, you're committed to a rela¬ tionship and more willing to work out prob¬ lems. When you're only dating, it's much easi¬ er to call it quits and move along in search of someone else. A contract with a paid ISP, they say, is like a marriage. You have a certain commitment to the business relationship, even if bound only by the monthly bill and the hassles that can be involved in closing an account. A free ISP is always a date. If you become dissatisfied with NetZero, it's easy to simply stop using it and start with AltaVista, or vice versa. So, like a date who wants to be sure you call back again, free ISPs have to devote resources to making certain you're enjoying the relationship, and that means providing the same level of cus¬ tomer support you'd expect from their for-pay competition. One area where the free ISPs are performing excellently is in connectivity. The leading free ISPs have local phone access from almost everywhere in the United States. Shissler notes how AltaVista has connectivity resources rival¬ ing that of AOL, while Woods is proud of NetZero's 98% call completion rate, about as good as you're likely to find in online services. In fact, the ease of connection to the free ISPs is one of the things most praised by reviewers. Features. The free ISPs have certainly become far more than mere portals to the Internet. And while they're not in a position to develop great depth of content and features on their own, they don't need to. \"We have the ability to form partnerships with a wide variety of content providers and services,\" Woods explains. A look at the home page of any of the major free ISPs does show all the features you'd expect from a giant paid service—and perhaps some extras. Some of the features have become so univer¬ sal that they can pretty much be taken for granted, such as a free e-mail account and a Web site you can personalize. You can also expect any ISP, free or paid, to easily connect you to news, sports, weather and stock market information. Beyond those sorts of basics, features can vary. But with the scramble to remain competi¬ tive, it's likely that what works for one ISP will soon be appearing on others. \"I'd intuit that about 75% of what you'll see on any ISP is going to be the same,\" says 1 Woods. About 20% will be differences in how they're presented. And maybe 5% will be specialized features to differentiate them.\" AltaVista recently intro¬ duced its new AltaVista Messenger, which is its ver¬ sion of across-the-Internet instant communications soft¬ ware along the lines of ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger. The AltaVista version is com¬ patible with Microsoft Messenger and PowWow, among others, allowing you These are several of the information windows you’ll need to fill out to use Juno. Other services require similar information because you pay for your account in demographic data rather than money. 14 Newest Web Tools / Learning Series Access & Use to chat one-on-one with any of your friends online, no matter what ISP they're logged on to, as long as they're running compatible software. AltaVista Messenger in¬ cludes capability for voice chat so that you can talk to a friend as you'd talk over the telephone, as long as you both have a microphone and speakers attached to your system. It also allows you to create your own personalized chat areas so that several people can gather together in one electronic \"room,\" even when all logged on through different services. One stand-out service from NetZero is the new NetZero Message Center, powered by ThinkLink. As it stands right now, it gives you free voice mail. You receive an assigned phone number which people can call to leave you messages. You can retrieve your messages by phone or through your NetZero inbox. Others can also call into your box with their comput¬ ers, typing in messages that are read back to you with a computer-generated voice. As if that's not enough, the service is expanding to make it a full-scale message ' FREE INTERNET ACCESS NETZ.EKO AND FREE E-MAIL COPj From the NetZero home page, you can download a version of the free software for use in either the United States or Canada. center. You can set it up to forward your messages to wherever you are. It makes it possible for you to get your messages by reg¬ ular telephone line, cellular phone, beeper, or even fax machine. At Juno, the upcoming release of the software will include the ability to automati¬ cally check e-mail on other accounts whenever you download your Juno e-mail. Other mail tools include greater ability to sort and control your incoming and outgoing mail so that you can sort and file them as you wish and automatically delete unwanted junk e-mail.

I Who’s Not Paying? The question of who is using free ISPs is a matter of some discussion, and brings us back to the dispute over whether free ISPs are likely to displace paid services. Shissler notes that he's seen a noticeable change in AltaVista's clientele from a year ago. Then, he says \"it was primarily newcomers to computing who saw the price of ISPs as a barrier to getting online.\" Now, more new users are coming from paid services. Woods adds that he is seeing the same change in the user base that is turn¬ ing up all across the Internet, with more older users and more women. Whoever the users are, there are a lot of them. AltaVista and BlueLight both announced their 3 millionth registered user in July 2000. Both free ISPs were only months old at the time. It took AOL several years to hit the 3 million mark. NetZero, launched in 1998, hit 3 million in January 2000. One thing that remains unknown is how many of these people use the free ISPs as their primary connect¬ ion and how many use it as a backup for their paid provider. . Furthermore, with hard drive space so cheap, it's now practical to down¬ load the software from multiple free ISPs and have several backup ser¬ vices at your disposal. Even if you don't want to live with the flashing ads all the time, if you're going to use the service only when you can't get through to your primary provider, having a free service makes a very reasonable alternative to paying a monthly fee to an ISP that you won't use for weeks at a time. ITsI by Steve Glaser and Elizabeth Lewis Learning Series / Newest Web Tools 15 Access & Use Affinity ISPs Internet Services That Cater To Your Interests T he more than 7,000 ISPs (Internet service providers) in the United States offer a range of technology products and ser¬ vices that can boggle the mind. They cater to the American share of the more than 115 mil¬ lion adults worldwide who have access to the Internet. Industry experts expect the number of adults online worldwide to almost double dur¬ ing the next four years; that means approxi¬ mately 100 million more people around the world will get online. In order to meet the growing demand, expect ISPs to continue pop¬ ping up with more and better services. For end users, the extensive number of ISPs to choose from means you need to do your homework when it comes to pinpointing exactly what kind of service you want. ■ What Are They? Before you sign up with just any Internet provider, consider this: The growing demand for services has driven com¬ petition within the industry to an all-time high. The latest trend in ISP marketing is big hardware owners farming out blocks of Internet connections to groups that can sell at least 1,000 subscriptions. Translated, this means that powerful companies such as AT&T, GTE, and PSINet, the owners of the actual wiring to homes and businesses, have decided to offer wholesale connections to groups that can go out and secure the clients. Businesses or organizations can buy Internet connections for one price per subscriber, then resell them for a few dollars more. For businesses, entrepreneurs, and other organizations, a completely new concept in using the Internet to form online, electronic communities has opened up. Any group that can muster enough subscribers can form an alliance with one of the muscle companies to offer members a full range of Internet services including high-speed access and membership in a select community. An organization such as the Girl Scouts can recruit members for a new ISP that they can call Girlscouts.net. It would be able to offer its members unlimited connections and all the amenities offered by generic ISPs. These \"new\" providers are known as affinity ISPs because they offer members a chance to become part of a singly- focused, special-interest online community. For end users who thought that surfing the Internet would be the ultimate exercise in I anonymity, affinity ISPs offer just the op¬ posite. They provide the perfect meeting ground for customers and services while wrapping it in the security of an exclusive online community. Once identified as hav¬ ing certain interests, users are then eligible to receive targeted information and promo¬ tions that apply specifically to the affinity groups they join. Businesses that want to use the Internet to reach potential cus¬ tomers can maximize their efforts by focus¬ ing on select communities. The affinity ISP I decides who is in and who is not, thereby shielding members from Internet spam, bogus offers, and annoying ads. For many groups, becoming an affinity ISP j sounds like a great idea, but dealing with the j technical aspects of launching a full-fledged ISP keeps many groups from entering the j industry. Again, changes in the marketplace have led to good news for end users. A new kind of middleman now handles j complex technology, conducts market research, and makes it possible for busi- i nesses and groups to harness the power of j the Internet as part of their marketing strat- j egy. eCommunity and H20 networks are i just two of the middlemen that offer affinity i hopefuls a range of services that include all the necessary planning, design, and operations expertise needed to build and maintain elec¬ tronic community networks. They make sure that the community and business participants j are carefully matched and managed and that participants receive services that are beneficial to everyone. i UltraStar, a privately held Internet enter- i tainment company also builds and manages ! exclusive, subscription-based online communi- j ties. Its primary focus is on major entertain¬ ment and sports groups. ■ Find An Affinity ISP. A search on the j Internet for affinity ISPs will reveal few sources to try. However, look at a recent mail- I ing from your favorite company, a newsletter j from a special interest group you subscribe to, or the box of a favorite product you recently { purchased. Not long ago, some General Mills cereals, including Chex, came with a free CD- j ROM containing the PC game Who Wants to j Be a Millionaire and some other goodies. The 16 Newest Web Tools / Learning Series Access & Use CD-ROM also included an option to sign up for Lightdog, a new Internet service with all the trappings of an affinity ISP. Another way to find affinity ISPs is to visit I the Web site of your favorite team or artist. You j may have to poke around, but you could find a link or banner that says \"join our online com- i munity,\" \"get a free e-mail account at...\", ! \"members login here,\" \"join now,\" or a similar j message. Sometimes you have to hunt a little, | and sometimes the message is clear. If you're affiliated with a particular inter- i est group, you can visit its Web site or call it [ to see if it offers Internet service. The f National Wildlife Federation, a nationwide l conservation group that protects nature and wildlife, recently entered the affinity ISP market. It hopes to \"be the Internet\" for its ! members. The organization intends to create I a thriving online community while maintain¬ ing a virtual one-on-one relationship with j members. It offers a special NWF browser, i unlimited access, and a full range of goodies [ including your own e-mail ©nwfnetwork .com, Web space and more. I Reasons To Switch To An Affinity ISP. If you already have an ISP, then you proba¬ bly need a really good reason to switch. If you're new to the market, you should give | ■ affinity ISPs a fair share of scrutiny. Here are a few reasons that might convince you: Identity. Most affinity ISPs are not free, and they do not intend to compete with the free¬ bies. What they do offer you is an online identi¬ ty, an electronic image, or your own \"e-denti- ty.\" Tell the world who you are and what you like, and share in the benefits offered by affini¬ ty ISPs. E-mail. When you belong to an online com¬ munity, you can tell your friends and family to e-mail you at yourname@yankees.com, or your- nflme@nwfnetwork.com, etc. According to P.R. Nichols, president of eCommunity, a favorite aspect of becoming a member of sausalito.net is SAUSMAIL, a remote e-mail service that's a lot like \"hotmail\" but without the spam. According to Nichols, \"it's free and most peo¬ ple alias to their existing e-mail address. They like this feature because if they ever change their ISP, they don't have to change their e- mail address.\" Targeted marketing. Vanity aside, another reason to join an affinity ISP is that you're exposed to carefully controlled adver¬ tising and services tailored to your interests. You also get information you want rather than all the information there is. For example, kingdomonline.net, an Internet community of Christians, provides an online Bible, book¬ store, prayer request board, news, games, and links to Christian businesses and Web sites. Incentives. Affinities want you to switch, so many of them offer enticements that can fatten your wallet, such as rebates, discounts, and subsidies. According to a consumer survey con¬ ducted by Jupiter Communications this spring, more than 47% of present ISP customers would switch if offered an economic incentive. It may take awhile, but if you do your homework, you could end up with better service, and some nice rewards. Technology. Affinity ISPs offer a lot in the way of technology to their customers, including high-speed connections, lots of connection choices (blackpower.net), filtered Internet surf¬ ing (family-network.net), online interactive databases, 3-D chat rooms, superior audio and video (davidbowie.com), and virtual-reality style participation. Many focus on making your online experience everything you hope it will be plus a lot more, all within the scope of your per¬ sonal interests. 13 Try Before You Buy. If you want to try an affinity-style service without switching providers first, you might like the approach offered by ISPs built by UltraStar. Affinities including davidbowie.com, clevelandbrowns .com, hanson.net, and yankees.com, let you try an exclusive content membership while sticking with your old ISP. According to Bob Goodale, president and chief strategy officer of UltraStar, \"Interestingly, the better response has been with the pure subscription approach; we've had more people pick that than change their ISPs to get the exclusive content.\" However, Goodale thinks that may change as more people get connected.

Access & Use Become Anonymous Don’t Let Others Track Your Web Surfing Habits & E-mail Use T here was a cartoon going around a few years ago of a dog typing away at a computer, with the cap¬ tion: \"On the Internet, no one knows you're a dog.\" This might have been true then, but the unfortunate truth is that now they not only know you're a dog, but they know your breed, favorite dog food, brand of dog collar, as well as the fact that you just came from the site http://www.cutepoodle,com. The amount of information you can give away when surfing the Internet or sending e-mail is staggering, and the simple fact is that you just never know who is going to be collecting such information, how long it will be stored, or how it will be used in the future (sold to advertisers and marketing firms, or worse). In just the past few months, high- profile privacy issues such as the following have made the news: :CueCat. The original idea was to send out this barcode scanner for free to hundreds of thousands of consumers, who could then use it to scan barcodes and easily browse to company or product Web sites. A great idea... until it was revealed that :CueCat also came equipped with a tracking feature to monitor and report your usage. Carnivore. This FBI e-mail surveillance system is capable of sifting through a massive amount of e-mail to find specific messages, a little akin to tapping every phone in New York City to get evidence on one suspect. Toys. What is it with toy companies? A suit filed in September against Toys \"R\" Us claims that they track online user activity and share data with third parties, while the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently quashed a plan by Toysmart.com to sell its customer database, especially since Toysmart.com claimed while gathering the information that it never would. Drug czar. The use of cookies was banned on all federal Web sites after it was found that Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the drug czar, and his Office of National Drug Control Policy were using them to track people who were accessing online drug information. The list, unfortunately, goes on, and with very little regulatory overview, it's safe to assume the worst when it comes to Internet privacy, and plan accordingly. Two great ways to minimize your risk are to try and make your Web surfing habits and e-mail use as anonymous as possible. ■ Break Free From Web Tracking. Every time you go to look at a Web page, you could be giving a considerable amount of information to that site, including: your browser type and operating system; what plug-ins you have installed; whether Java, JavaScript, or VBScript are enabled on your system; your processor type, monitor resolu¬ tion, and size; and your IP (Internet Protocol) address. Plus, sites can also track how many other sites you've accessed in the current browsing session, the last page you visited, and more. Luckily, a variety of both software and Web-based solutions now exist that can dramatically reduce the amount of informa¬ tion you give away. Freedom. Zercr-Knowledge Systems' Freedom software (http://www.freedom .net) is rather unique among the majority of solutions offered here in that it lets you not only surf the Internet anonymously, but also send and receive e-mail and use telnet, chat, and newsgroups. Freedom makes use of pseudonyms (or \"nyms,\" as they call them) that you can set up. With each nym, you decide how much you wish to disclose. This concept not only lets you con¬ trol how much information you give away, but also lets you sep¬ arate your online interests through the use of several nyms, a perfect solution for those with split virtual personalities. Freedom works through the Freedom Network, a series of \"privacy-enhanced detours\" that sit between you and the Internet. Every time you send or receive a request, it is wrapped in several layers of encryption, and each bounce through the network strips of a layer, creating a powerful cloaking system that shields you from prying eyes (including, according to the company, Zero-Knowledge itself). All of this is controlled through a small panel that sits on your Desktop and shows your current nym, the type of information you're sending, and more. Special features include the ability to store cookies for each nym in its own special cookie jar (where you can view and delete them), use digital signatures that keep people fjorn impersonating you, and much more. Freedom 1.1 is available for $49.95, which will give you five nyms for one year, at which time, you'll have to resubscribe (as in, pay more money) to keep using the system. Anonymity 4 Proxy. As the name implies, Anonymity 4 Proxy (http://www .inetprivacy.com/a4proxy) makes use of proxy servers (with IP addresses that you can use to hide your identity while surfing) to give you more anonymity on the Internet. This software comes with a database stuffed with hundreds of public anonymous proxy 20 Newest Web Tools / Learning Series Access & Use servers located around the world. These proxy servers not only let you access Web pages through them (using a proxy in Denmark, for example, will make it appear ; that you are logging into a site from Denmark), but they also claim to be anony¬ mous, meaning that no part of your address transmits to the Web site from the proxy. Using a proxy server is often a leap of faith. | Is it up? Is it fast enough to use? Is it really anonymous? With Anonymity 4 Proxy, how¬ ever, you can run a series of tests on a proxy server to determine its response time, speed, j and most importantly, whether it really does ! hide your identity. You can select one proxy from the database to use full-time, or set Up ; the software so that a different proxy is I called upon with each request, j Anonymity 4 Proxy works with Web i browsers and download managers such as | GetRight, and while it has no ability to | cloak you for use with chat, newsreaders, ! or e-mail, you can use it with Web-based I systems like Hotmail as an anonymous e-mail solution. The software comes with a number of powerful features, including the ability to generate unique IP addresses, block cookies, and use it over a LAN (local-area network) so that each computer i can have an anonymous Internet connec¬ tion all to itself. Anonymity 4 Proxy 2.5 is $35 for non- I commercial/home use, and supports up to | three computers. You also get free software and proxy database updates for life. Anonymizer.com. Anonymizer.com I (http://www.anonymizer.com) has definitely | become the high-profile king of low-profile : Web surfing. Around since 1996, Anony- mizer.com provides a variety of solutions, from free surfing to dial-up access, that put anonymity before all else by masking your identity, disabling cookies, addressing Java and JavaScript, and more. To find out what's really at stake, initially click-through to its Privacy Analysis, where it \"reads\" your connection and lets you know exactly what you're giving away (the list that started this section was compiled using its Analysis). It's a pretty sobering experience, and a very effective advertising tool for one of Anonymizer.com's services: • Free Surfing. With the Anonymizer.com j Free Surfing service, anyone can surf the Web anonymously by plugging an address into the Anonymizer.com site and pressing the Go! button. Links subsequently clicked will continue to be anonymous, and you can easily tell if you're surfing incognito by the presence of a sizeable banner and strip at the top of the page. A delay is built into the free version (pages take longer to load), and you're limited to a 10MB (megabytes) file size for downloads. It also doesn't allow streaming video.
