        "text": "In this chapter I examine the concepts and uses of data as they are expressed in representations of self-tracking (otherwise known as life logging, the quantified self or personal informatics).Self-tracking is not only a technology of the self, but it is also a data practice. Self-tracking may be further conceptualised as a data practice that produces data assemblages. Most recently and noticeably, detailed quantifiable data has become valorised above other forms of information about oneâ€™s life, health and wellbeing. I will discuss the valorisation of quantification as a self-tracking data practice, but I also go on to examine alternative data practices with which some people are experimenting as part of self-tracking strategies.\n\nAn audience exists for personal information, including quantified-self data, beyond an individual&#39;s social network and social communities. In the era of big data, the research and policy arenas are two areas where up-to-date assemblages of personal information have market value. In this ongoing study, we examine the long-term value of small data [2], acknowledging that there is also a societal need and an audience for rich, personalized collections of digital self-tracking records. Using qualitative research methods, we interviewed 18 people to explore the nature of self-tracking data that exists as a byproduct of daily life, and their sense of why and how their data could be archived for posterity. In the process, the intellectual and design challenges of a digital quantified-self archive are explored.\n\nIn this chapter I discuss the ways in which people engage with the data that are generated from their interactions with online technologies and digital sensing and communication devices. Due to the reactive and responsive nature of computer software and the ubiquity of the devices that people carry with them or that sense their movements, the lives of humans have become increasingly entangled with digital technologies. People are confronted with attempting to gain some purchase on information about themselves which is not only continually generated but is also used by other actors and agencies in ways of which they may not be fully aware. They are also dealing with the ways in which their data are announced to themselves, such as the push notifications and targeted advertising based on their browsing or online purchasing habits that they receive when using apps and online platforms. I address the topic of personal data practices in response to lively data with reference to several of my own current research projects.\n\nThere are often several interconnected complex factors affecting one's healthy behavior. Visualization of a single factor, as current tools provide, is limited and makes overall analysis difficult. We describe a system that supports both the self-monitoring of vital statistics as well as the collaborative exploratory analysis of multivariate contextual and behavioral information with respective domain experts. These analyses, data and visualizations are automatically shared through the use Google Drive."
