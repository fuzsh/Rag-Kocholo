        "text": "Find out whether you can register under your locality, and if so, who manages domains for the locality. This old list of delegated subdomains gives you an idea of whatâs available. For up-to-date contact information, perform a WHOIS query for the delegated subdomain belonging to the locality you want. For example, if youâre interested in a cincinnati.oh.us domain and your computer runs Linux or macOS, youâd run the following command:\n\nwhois cincinnati.oh.us\n\nThere are plenty of Web-based WHOIS lookup tools, but only a few offer support for the .us locality namespace. Your best bet is the WHOIS tool run by GoDaddy itself. Note the âDelegated Manager Contact Emailâ or âDomain Manager Emailâ: this is where youâll send the application. (Or if theyâre really stuck in the past, note their fax number.)\n\nIf the locality youâre interested in has no WHOIS entry, it may just be that GoDaddy has been unable to contact its delegated manager. However, if the delegated manager is listed as GoDaddy or Neustar (the former .us registrar), youâre definitely out of luck: under an âInterim Undelegated Name Policyâ approved by the Commerce Department, you have to be an official representative of that locality in order to register a domain. You could wait for this eternal interim period to conclude, or you could choose a different locality.\n\nDelegated managers are free to establish their own eligibility criteria. The vast majority of them offer free registrations. A few require you to have a local address."
