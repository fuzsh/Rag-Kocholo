        "text": "Who Were NetScape's Competitors\n\nWebRouser, UdiWWW, and Microsoft's Internet Explorer were some of Netscapes biggest competitors.Â However, despite its early success, Netscape had no real chance to beat Microsoft who released IE 1.0 soon after Netscape and continued to improve on it until they finally took over Netscape and were able to offer a consistently better product than their counterpart.\n\nIt was also no secret that Microsoft had wanted to beat Netscape. An internal memo from May 1995, clearlyoutlines Microsoft CEO Bill Gates' objective to become the preferred web browser at the time.\n\nâ\n\nWhy did Netscape Fail and Shut Down?\n\nNetscape eventually became obsolete for the most part but was, however, acquired by AOL in November 1998 for $4.2 billion.Â\n\nAfter the acquisition, the company tried again to release upgraded versions of the browser but the battle seemed to have already been won by Microsoft.\n\nNetscape finally decided to outsource their code which would later give rise to Firefox. AOL finally shut down Netscape in 2008.\n\nâ\n\nFrequently Asked QuestionsÂ\n\nWhat Happened To The Netscape Browser?\n\nNetscape was one of the first online browsers, competing with Microsoftâs Internet Explorer. However Internet Explorer surpassed it in market share and technology, and it was formally shut down.\n\nâ\n\nDoes Netscape Still Exist?\n\nThe end of Netscape Navigator was officially discontinued. Despite this, users were able to transfer their data to Flock and Firefox using migration tools forsome time after the company was shut down.Â\n\nâ\n\nIs Netscape Now Firefox?\n\nFirefox is a descendent of Netscape. After the software got discontinued as a Navigator some of its features and technology were implemented in the development of other browsers such as Flock and Firefox.\n\nâ\n\nGo on Reading"
