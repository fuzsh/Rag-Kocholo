        "text": "1990s: Word Wide Web\n\nA CERN scientist named Tim Berners-Lee develops HyperText Markup Language, or HTML. The concept allows text and pictures to be encoded so that when clicked, it leads to another internet document or file. This will form the basis for the World Wide Web.\n\n1991: Al Gore “Invents” the Internet\n\nIn an unfortunate comment made while running for the Presidential nomination, Al Gore said that he “took the initiative in creating the internet.” This comment was publicly mocked as Gore claiming to have invented the internet. What he actually did, in 1991 was introduce the High-Performance Computing and Communications Act of 1991 (known as the Gore bill). The act allocated $600 million in funding to help fund the National Information Infrastructure, or Information Superhighway.\n\nThe First WebCam: Engineers hook a camera pointed at a coffee pot to the internet, so they could see when it became empty. This becomes the first known webcam.\n\n1993: The First Browser and AOL\n\nUp until now, the Internet has been largely a text-based system requiring knowledge of text command lines to use. While at the University of Illinois, Marc Andreesen develops Mosaic, an internet browser that allows users to display webpages and images. Users could use a mouse to easily scroll pages, point and click at links.\n\n1994: Netscape\n\nThe U.S. government gets out of the Internet business, privatizing the Internet’s backbone and decommissioning the NSFNET backbone the following year.\n\nAndreesen takes his Mosaic browser to the private sector from the university in the form of Netscape, the first commercial browser. During 1994, Microsoft, sensing a threat to its computing dominance, creates its own Internet Explorer browser, which it gives away for free as part of its operating system.\n\nAlso in 1994, Jerry Yang and David Filo launch Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web. The company would later become Yahoo!, a category-based internet directory of website links.\n\nThe First Spam: Two lawyers post the first ‘spam’ to the internet: An offering for Green Card services is cross-posted to nearly every single group on Usenet, regardless of relevance.\n\n1995: The Internet Goes Prime Time\n\nAOL, Compuserve and Prodigy, all former closed networks, begin providing public Internet access.\n\nOnline companies Amazon and eBay are founded. At this time, Amazon sells only books, and eBay only does auctions.\n\nNetscape has its IPO and begins the Internet bubble on the U.S. stock market. Its stock price quickly skyrockets from the $28 IPO price to close at $58.25. By December it was worth over $80 per share.\n\n1997: Netflix\n\nThe now ubiquitous streaming service Netflix is launched as a DVD by mail service. Users signup and select DVDs online over the Internet, but physical DVDs get mailed to the home and mailed back when the customer is finished. Two revolutionary ideas propel Netflix’s success: no shipping fees and no late fees.\n\n1998: Google\n\nGoogle is launched in 1998. Google’s initial algorithm basically counted the number of links a website had pointing at it. The more links, the higher the website ranked. While ‘Search Engine Optimization’ or SEO has grown much more complex, this is still the underlying basis for the Google ranking algorithm today.\n\nThe IPv6 Standard is published. The original IPv4 standard provides what at the time seemed like a lot of IP addresses, approximately 4.3 billion. However, concern about IPv4 addresses eventually running out spurred the development of IPv6, which offers 3.4 x 1038 addresses. While this seems like more addresses than will ever be needed, if history is any guide, sometime in the future, that will prove not to be the case.\n\nTurn of the Millenium: Napster & Internet Bubble Pops\n\nThe Napster service goes online and quickly becomes a popular way to share music files for free, illegally, setting off the still raging battle between the music industry and pirates. The Internet affects everyone in America for the first time as the bursting of the ‘dotcom bubble’ crashes the stock market and takes the economy with it. In one of the most disastrous mergers of all time, AOL buys out Time Warner for $165 billion in mostly stock, later turning out to be largely worthless.\n\n2001: Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia launches as a free, user-created and edited encyclopedia. While the effort is initially mocked and its accuracy frequently questioned, the website continues to be one of the most visited on the Internet today.\n\n2003: iTunes\n\nApple launches iTunes as a way to legally buy and download music over the Internet. All songs were 99 cents each.\n\n2004/05: Facebook, Web 2.0 & YouTube\n\nFacebook is founded by Mark Zuckerberg while at Harvard University. Initially, the now worldwide, Facebook was limited to just Harvard students. It was eventually opened to all students, and by 2006, opened to everyone over the age of 13.\n\nAlthough first used in 1999, the term Web 2.0 goes mainstream after computing book publisher O’Reily Media hosts a Web 2.0 conference that draws the attention of the tech press. Mydoom, the fastest ever email-spread worm/virus infects machines globally after unsuspecting users open an infected attachment. YouTube is founded as a way to upload and share videos.\n\n2006/07: Twitter & iPhone"
