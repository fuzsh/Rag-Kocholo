International Conference on the Use of the Internet in Mental Health • 15 Years of Mental Health Online Anyone who wants to see what happens on a 2 month drug holiday just look at my updated VL and CD4 count. After being taken off of old meds to track down some unwanted side affects. My VL spiked from undetectable up to 7,360 in a two month period. Having been on new meds for 28 days my VL dropped precipitously. As of last Tuesday 220. I must say also that a drug holiday is not what it once was. Not taking 8 relatively small easy to swallow pills a day just does not compare to not taking 30 giant rubberized stick to the back your throat pills a day. I just kinda feel like I am on a drug holiday all the time by comparison. Patients Like Me HIV forum Drug Holiday\n\n27.
