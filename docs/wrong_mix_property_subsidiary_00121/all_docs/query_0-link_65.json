The Internet, Digital Media, and Media Convergence Starting a decade ago, the most famous mar- keting campaign for mobile phones involved a Verizon Wireless test technician wearing horn-rimmed glasses saying “Can you hear me now?” into his phone from various locations. These days, the original purpose of a mobile phone—a voice call—is no longer the main attraction. Instead, the Blackberry, the iPhone, and Google’s Android phones lead a growing list of smartphones that feature options like mobile broadband, Wi-Fi, texting, GPS navigators, music players, touch screens, full keyboards, cameras, and speech recognition. Mobile phones today represent a “fourth screen” (after movie screens, televisions, and computers) for many users, allowing us to go online, watch vid- eos, or take and send photos wherever we are. We may be on the go, but now we aren’t discon- nected from the mass media—we take it with us. (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 38���MASS MEDIA AND THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE THE INTERNET, DIGITAL MEDIA, AND MEDIA CONVERGENCE The change in the technology and\n\n3. culture of mobile phones is evident in current mobile phone marketing. When HTC released its Droid Incred- ible smartphone for Verizon in 2010, voice calls were hardly even a feature worth promoting. Indeed, the only times Verizon mentioned voice was in connec- tion to the voice-enabled keyboard (so users can speak their text messages in- stead of typing them) and voice search, which uses voice recognition to search Google. The more important features in the marketing campaign were the powerful processors, the touch screen, social networking ease, synced e-mail accounts, Google Maps, the 8 mega- pixel camera, and thousands of apps and widgets from the Android Market (similar to the iPhone’s App Store). One of the latest entries, Motorola’s Bravo (for AT&T) is a smartphone whose design and features focus on Web browsing and social networking so much that most reviews don’t even address the phone’s call quality. Instead, the Bravo’s marketing efforts show off its full HTML browser with Adobe Flash Lite 3 (for a content-rich surfing experi- ence) and a large touch screen (making it better for watching video). The phone also features MOTOBLUR, a service that syncs your Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter updates into a single feed. However, given the fierce competition in the market, it can be difficult to know\n\n4. which of the many new smartphones will be popular with consumers and have lasting power. This shift in marketing reflects a sig- nificant trend: By 2009, traffic from text, video, and other data surpassed voice call traffic in mobile phone sys- tems in the United States.1 Ironically, the amount of data traffic on Apple’s iPhones has swamped AT&T’s cellular networks in major metropolitan areas like New York, San Francisco, and Austin, resulting in a chronic problem of dropped voice calls.2 Despite occasional technological pitfalls, smartphones contain more and more functions and applications with every new release. Along with comput- ers, digital music players, and a new generation of touchscreen devices like the iPad, smartphones are part of the general shift to media convergence in media devices over the past decade. We may be talking (on the phone) less, but now we have other tools to communi- cate the drama of our lives instantly. “We may be on the go, but now we aren’t disconnected from the mass media—we take it with us.” (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6\n\n5. CHAPTER 2 ○ INTERNET���39 THE INTERNET—the vast network of telephone and cable lines, wireless connections, and satellite systems designed to link and carry digital information worldwide—was initially described as an information superhighway. This description implied that the goal of the Internet was to build a new media network, a new superhighway, to replace traditional media (e.g., books, newspa- pers, television, and radio), the old highway system. In many ways, the original description of the Internet has turned out to be true. The Internet has expanded dramatically from its initial establishment in the 1960s to an enormous media powerhouse that encompasses—but has not replaced—all other media today. Even with its tremendous growth, the full impact of the Internet has yet to emerge. Unlike radio, television, and other mass media, the Internet uniquely lacks technological limitations\n\n6. on how large its databases of content can grow and how many people around the globe can be connected to it. Unending waves of new innovations and capabilities appear rapidly online. These advances have presented both challenges and opportunities to virtually every traditional mass medium, including the recording industry, radio, broadcast and cable television, movies, newspapers, magazines, and books. With its ability to host personal conversations, social networks, and multimedia mass communication, the Internet has begun to break down conventional distinctions among various media industries and between private and public modes of communication. As governments, corporations, and public and private interests vie to shape the Internet’s continuing evolution, answers for many questions remain ambiguous. Who will have access to the Internet, and who will be left behind? Who or what will manage the Internet? What infor- mation is private, and what is public? What are the implications for the future and for democ- racy? The task for critical media consumers is to sort through\n\n7. competing predictions about the Internet and new technology, analyzing and determining how the Internet can best serve the majority of citizens and communities. Why discuss the Internet before exploring the many traditional forms of media—books, radio, television, and so on—that both preceded and shaped it? The answer is simple: We are all witnesses and participants in the emergence of this mass medium. Because of this unique vantage point, we are able to gain firsthand understanding of the factors that cause a medium to evolve over time, and we can apply that understanding to the older, more established media we’ll talk about in later chapters. In this chapter, we examine the many dimensions of the Internet, digital media, and con- vergence. We will: • Review the birth and evolution of the Internet from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0 • Provide an overview of the key features of the Internet, including instant messaging, blogs, and social knowledge networks\n\n8. • Discuss the convergence of the Internet with other forms of media, smartphones, and touchscreen technology • Explore the world of video games, including online gaming and convergence, the economics and effects of gaming, and the future of gaming technology • Examine the economics and critical issues of the Internet: ownership, targeted advertising, free speech, security, and access As you read through this chapter, think back to your first experiences with the Internet. What was your first encounter like? What were some of the things you remember using the Internet for YOUTUBE is the most popular Web site for watching videos online. Full of amateur and home videos, the site now partners with mainstream television and movie companies to provide professional content as well (a change that occurred after Google bought the site).

By the 2000s, the Internet was a multimedia source for both information and entertainment as it quickly became an integral part of our daily lives. For ex- ample, in 2000, about 50 percent of American adults were connected to the Internet; by 2010, about 80 percent of American adults used the Internet. The Birth of the Internet The Internet originated as a military-government project, with computer time-sharing as one of its goals. In the 1960s, computers were relatively new and there were only a few of the expen- sive, room-sized mainframe computers across the country for researchers to use. The Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) developed a solution to enable\n\n10. researchers to share computer processing time starting in the late 1960s. This original Internet— called ARPAnet and nicknamed the Net—enabled military and academic researchers to commu- nicate on a distributed network system (see Figure 2.1 on page 41). First, ARPA created a wired The Evolution of the Internet “The dream behind the Web is of a common informa- tion space in which we communicate by sharing informa- tion. Its universality is essential: the fact that a hyper- text link can point to anything, be it personal, local, or global, be it draft or highly polished.” TIM BERNERS-LEE, INVENTOR OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB, 2000 The Internet, Digital Media, and Media Convergence E-mail\n\n11. The process by which electronic messages are sent from computer to computer on a network is first developed in the early 1970s, revolutionizing modes of communication (p. 42). NSF Network In 1982, the National Science Foundation bankrolls a high-speed communications network, connecting computers across the country (p. 42). 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 Digital Technology In the late 1940s, images, texts, and sounds are first converted into “binary code“—ones and zeros— vastly improving the rate at which information is stored and reproduced (p. 45). ARPAnet The U.S. Defense Department begins re- search in the late 1960s on a distributed com- munication network— the groundwork for the\n\n12. Internet (p. 40). Microprocessors These miniature compu- ter circuits, developed in 1971, enable personal computers to be born. PCs become increasingly smaller, cheaper, and more powerful (p. 42). then? How did it compare with your first encounters with other mass media? How has the Internet changed since your first experiences with it?

Second, to prevent logjams in data communication, the network used a system called packet switching, which broke down messages into smaller pieces to more easily route\n\n13. them through the multiple paths on the network before reassembling them on the other end. Ironically, one of the most hierarchically structured and centrally organized institutions in our culture—the national defense industry—created the Internet, possibly the least hierarchical and most decentralized social network ever conceived. Each computer hub in the Internet has similar status and power, so nobody can own the system outright and nobody has the power to Fiber-Optic Cable Thin glass bundles of fiber are developed in the mid-1980s, capable of transmit- ting thousands of digital messages and allowing broadcast channels, telephone signals, and other data to go on the Internet (p. 43). AOL The company is launched in 1985, becoming the most successful Internet service provider for the next decade (p. 44).\n\n14. Web Browsers The Internet becomes navigable with a user-friendly graphic layout, and by 1993 the Internet is poised to become a mass medium (p. 44). Broadband By 2005, dial-up Internet connec- tions decline sharp- ly as users switch to cable modem or DSL connections (p. 44). Online Gaming In 1999, Sega intro- duces the Dream- cast, the first console to have a modem. It transforms video games into an online, multiplayer social activity (p. 52). 1990 2000 2010 2020 Blogging In 1999, Pyra Labs releases Blogger Software,\n\n15. helping to popu- larize blogging (p. 46). Net Neutrality In 2010, a federal appeals court rules to allow Comcast to slow its customers’ access to the file-sharing site BitTorrent, despite fierce opposition from the FCC (p. 51). Blackberry Introduced in 2002, the Black- berry is the first Internet-capable smartphone to catch on, allowing users to check their e-mail anytime and anywhere (p. 49). Game Center Apple jumps into the world of video games in 2010 with the launch of its Game Center, where players can connect with oth- ers for multiplayer games and keep track of their\n\n16. scores (p. 54). Hypertext In the mid-1980s, this data-linking fea- ture enables users to link one Web page to another, creating the World Wide Web (p. 43).

There isn’t even a master power switch, so authority figures cannot shut off the Internet—although as we will discuss later, some nations and corporations have at- tempted to restrict access for political or commercial benefit. To enable military personnel and researchers involved in the development of ARPAnet to better communicate with one another from separate locations, an essential innovation during the development stage of the Internet was e-mail. It was invented in 1971 by computer engineer Ray Tomlinson, who developed software to send electronic mail messages to any computer on ARPAnet. He decided to use the @ symbol to signify the location of the computer user, thus\n\n18. establishing the “login [email protected] computer” convention for e-mail addresses. At this point in the development stage, the Internet was primarily a tool for universities, govern- ment research labs, and corporations involved in computer software and other high-tech products to exchange e-mail and to post information on computer bulletin boards, sites that listed information about particular topics such as health issues, computer programs, or employment services. As the use of the Internet continued to proliferate, the entrepreneurial stage quickly came about. The Net Widens From the early 1970s until the late 1980s, a number of factors (both technological and historical) brought the Net from the development stage, in which the Net and e-mail were first invented, to the entrepreneurial stage, in which the Net became a marketable medium. The first signal of the Net’s marketability came in 1971 with the introduction of micropro- cessors, miniature circuits that process and store electronic signals. This innovation facilitated the integration of thousands of transistors and related circuitry into thin strands of silicon along\n\n19. which binary codes traveled. Using microprocessors, manufacturers were eventually able to introduce the first personal computers (PCs), which were smaller, cheaper, and more powerful than the bulky computer systems that occupied entire floors of buildings during the 1960s. With personal computers now readily available, a second opportunity for marketing the Net came in 1986, when the National Science Foundation developed a high- speed communications network (NSFNET) designed to link university research computer centers around the country and also “A fiber the size of a human hair can deli- ver every issue ever printed of the Wall Street Journal in less than a second.” NICHOLAS NEGROPONTE, BEING DIGITAL, 1995 COMMODORE 64 This advertisement for the Commodore 64, one of the first home PCs, touts the features of the computer. Although it was heralded\n\n20. in its time, today’s PCs far exceed its abilities.

This innovation led to a dramatic increase in Internet use and further opened the door to the widespread commercial pos- sibilities of the Internet. In the mid-1980s, fiber-optic cable became the standard for transmitting communication data speedily. Featuring thin glass bundles of fiber capable of transmitting thousands of messages simultaneously (via laser light), fiber-optic cables began replacing the older, bulkier copper wire used to transmit computer information. This development made the commercial use of computers even more viable than before. With this increased speed, few limits exist with regard to\n\n21. the amount of information that digital technology can transport. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, the ARPAnet military venture officially ended. By that time, a growing community of re- searchers, computer programmers, amateur hackers, and commercial inter- ests had already tapped into the Net, creating tens of thousands of points on the network and the initial audience for its emergence as a mass medium. Web 1.0: The World Begins to Browse The introduction of the World Wide Web and the first web browsers, Mosaic and Netscape, in the 1990s helped to prompt the mass medium stage of the Internet. That first decade of the Web is now often referred to as Web 1.0. Prior to the 1990s, most of the Internet’s traffic was for e-mail, file transfers, and re- mote access of computer databases. The World Wide Web (or the Web) changed all of that. Developed in the late 1980s by software engineer Tim Berners- Lee at the CERN particle physics lab in Switzerland to help scientists better collaborate,\n\n22. the Web was initially a text data-linking system that allowed computer-accessed information to associate with, or link to, other information no matter where it was on the Internet. Known as hypertext, this data- linking feature of the Web was a breakthrough for those attempting to use the Internet. HTML (hypertext markup language), the written code that creates Web pages and links, is a language that all computers can read, so computers with different operating systems, such as Windows or Macintosh, can communicate easily. The Web and HTML allow information to be organized in an easy-to-use nonlinear manner, making way for the next step in using the Internet. The release of Web browsers—the software packages that help users navigate the Web— brought the Web to mass audiences. In 1993, computer programmers led by Marc Andreessen at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign released Mosaic, the first window-based browser to load text and graphics together in a magazine-like layout, with attractive fonts and easy-to-use back, forward, home,\n\n23. and bookmark buttons at the top. In 1994, Andreessen joined investors in California’s Silicon Valley to introduce a commercial browser, Netscape. Together, the World Wide Web and Mo- saic gave the Internet basic multimedia capability, enabling users to transmit pictures, sound, and video. The Internet experienced extraordinarily rapid growth, and by 1994 the masses had arrived. As USA Today wrote that year, this “new way to travel the Internet, the World Wide Web,” was “the latest rage among Net aficionados.”3 The Web soon became everyone else’s rage, too, as universities and businesses, and later home users, got connected. The Commercial Structure of the Web As with other mass media forms, the Internet quickly became commercialized, leading to battles between corporations vying to attract the most users. In the beginning, commercial enti- ties were seeking to capture business in four key areas: Internet service, Web browsing, e-mail, and Web directories/search engines. WEB BROWSERS The GUI (graphical user\n\n24. interface) of the World Wide Web changed overnight with the release of Mosaic in 1993 (above). As the first popular Web browser, Mosaic unleashed the multimedia potential of the Internet. Mosaic was the inspiration for the commercial browser Netscape, which was released in 1994. “The medium, or process, of our time—electric technology—is reshaping and restructuring patterns of social interdependence and every aspect of our personal life.” MARSHALL McLUHAN, 1967 (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 44���MASS MEDIA AND THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE THE INTERNET, DIGITAL MEDIA, AND MEDIA CONVERGENCE\n\n25. Internet Service Providers One of the first ways businesses got involved with the Internet was by offering connections to it. AOL (formerly America Online), which began in 1985 and bought the world’s largest media com- pany, Time Warner, in 2001, was for a long time the United States’ top Internet service provider (ISP), connecting millions of home users to its proprietary Web system through dial-up access. As broadband connections—which can quickly download multimedia content—became more avail- able (about 64 percent of all American households had such connections by 2010), users moved away from the slower telephone dial-up ISP service (AOL’s main service) to high-speed service from cable, telephone, or satellite companies. In 2007, both AT&T (offering DSL broadband) and Comcast (cable broadband) surpassed AOL in numbers of customers. Other national ISPs include Verizon, Time Warner Cable, and Earthlink. These are accompanied by hundreds of local services, many offered by regional telephone companies that compete to provide consumers with access to the Internet. Web Browsing\n\n26. In the early 1990s, as the Web became the most popular part of the Internet, many thought that the key to commercial success on the Net would be through a Web browser, since it is the most common interface with the Internet. As discussed earlier, the first browser to come on to the market was the government-funded Mosaic in 1993. The next year, Andrees- sen and several of his graduate school colleagues from NCSA relocated to Silicon Valley in California and teamed with venture capital firms to release Netscape. In 1995, Microsoft released its own Web browser, Internet Explorer; and within a few years, Internet Explorer— strategically bundled with Microsoft operating system software—overtook Netscape as the most popular Web browser. It continues to dom- inate the Web browser business today. AOL purchased Netscape in 1998, and today Netscape survives only as a minor brand of AOL. Other browsers, such as Safari, Firefox, Opera, and Google Chrome, offer alternatives to Internet Explorer.\n\n27. E-mail Another area of the Internet on which companies focused their attention was e-mail. Because sending and receiving e-mail is a popular use of the Internet, major Web corporations such as Yahoo!, AOL, Google, and Microsoft (Hotmail) offer free Web-based e-mail accounts to draw users to their sites, and each has millions of users. All of the e-mail services also include advertisements in their users’ e-mail messages, one of the costs of the “free” e-mail accounts. Google’s Gmail goes one step further by scanning messages to dynamically match a relevant ad to the text each time an e-mail message is opened. Such tar- geted advertising has become a hallmark feature of the Internet. Directories and Search Engines As the number of Web sites on the Internet quickly expanded, companies seized the opportunity to provide ways to navigate (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 CHAPTER 2 ○ INTERNET���45\n\n28. this vast amount of information by providing directories and search engines. Directories rely on people to review and catalogue Web sites, creating categories with hierarchical topic structures that can be browsed. Yahoo! was the first company to provide such a service. Yahoo! started as a hobby to keep track of all the information on the Web. In 1994, Stanford University graduate stu- dents Jerry Yang and David Filo created a Web page—“Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web”—to organize their favorite Web sites, first into categories, then into more and more subcat- egories as the Web grew. At that point, the entire World Wide Web was almost manageable, with only about twenty-two thousand Web sites. (By 2008, Google announced it had indexed more than one trillion Web pages, up from one billion in 2000). The guide made a lot of sense to other people, and soon enough Yang and Filo renamed it the more memorable “Yahoo!” and started what would become a very profitable corporation and an important player in the Web’s continu- ing development. Search engines, meanwhile, offer a different route to finding\n\n29. content by allowing users to enter key words or queries to locate related Web pages. Some of the first search engines were Yahoo!, which searched information in its own directory catalogues, and Alta Vista and Inktomi, which were the first algorithmic search engines (searching the entire Web and looking for the number of times a key word shows up on a page). Soon search results were corrupted by Web sites that tried to trick search engines in order to get ranked higher on the results list. One com- mon trick was to embed a popular search term in the page, often typed over and over again in the tiniest font possible and in the same color as the site’s background. Although users didn’t see the word, the search engines did, and they ranked the page higher even if the page had little to do with the search term. Google, released in 1998, became a major success because it introduced a new algorithm that mathematically ranked a page’s “popularity” on the basis of how many other pages linked to it. Users immediately recognized Google’s algorithm as an improvement, and it became the\n\n30. favorite search engine almost overnight. Even other Web companies chose to use Google’s search engine on their sites. By 2010, Google’s market share accounted for about 71 percent of searches in the United States, while Yahoo!’s share was about 15 percent and Microsoft’s Bing was about 9.5 percent.4 Web 2.0 The innovation of digital communication—central to the development of the first comput- ers in the 1940s—enables all media content to be created in the same basic way, which makes media convergence possible. In digital technology, an image, text, or sound is converted into electronic signals represented as a series of binary numbers— ones and zeros—which are then reassembled as a precise reproduction of an image, text, or sound. Digital signals operate as pieces, or bits (from BInary digiTS), of information representing two values, such as yes/no, on/ off, or 0/1. For example, a typical compact disc track uses a binary code system in which zeros are microscopic pits in the surface of the disc and ones are represented on the unpitted surface.\n\n31. Used in various combinations, these digital codes can duplicate, store, and play back the most complex kinds of media content. Aided by faster microprocessors, high-speed broadband networks, and a proliferation of digital content, the Internet has become more than just an information source in its second decade as a mass medium. The second generation of the Internet, known as Web 2.0, is a much more rapid and robust environment. It has moved toward being a fully interactive and collab- orative medium with instant messaging, social networking, interactive games, and user-created content like blogs, Tumblrs, YouTube videos, Flickr photostreams, and PhotoBucket albums. It’s the users who ultimately rule in Web 2.0, sharing the words, sounds, images, and creatively edited mash-up videos that make these Web communities worth visiting. “When search first started, if you searched for something and you found it, it was a miracle. Now, if you\n\n32. don’t get exactly what you want in the first three results, something is wrong.” UDI MANBER, GOOGLE ENGINEER, 2007 (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 46���MASS MEDIA AND THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE THE INTERNET, DIGITAL MEDIA, AND MEDIA CONVERGENCE Instant Messaging Instant messaging, or IM, enables users to send and receive real-time computer messages. Although instant messaging can be used to facilitate conversations among coworkers or family members, its most popular use has been as an extended social scene among students, who log on after school and chat for hours with their friends. As such, instant messaging foreshadowed the development of social networking sites, another important development in Web 2.0.\n\n33. Major IM services—many of which now have voice and video chat capabilities—include AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Microsoft’s MSN Messenger Service, Yahoo!’s Messenger, Apple’s iChat, Skype (owned by eBay), Gmail’s Chat, MySpaceIM, and Facebook Chat. IM users fill out detailed profiles when signing up for the service, providing advertisers with multiple ways to target them as they chat with their friends. More recently, text messaging via cell phones has surpassed IM as the most popular way to communicate with friends. According to a 2010 study, about 75 percent of twelve- to seventeen-year-olds have a mobile phone, and 54 percent of teens send text messages to friends daily. By contrast, only 24 percent of teens contact friends by IM daily, and just 11 percent e-mail friends daily.5 Blogs Blogs, popularized with the release of Blogger in 1999, are sites that contain articles or posts in chronological, journal-like form, often with reader comments and\n\n34. links to other sites. Ideally, blogs are updated fre- quently, often with daily posts that keep readers com- ing back to them. Blogs can be personal or corporate multimedia sites, sometimes with photos, graphics, podcasts, and video. By 2010, there were nearly 127 million blogs, the most popular topics being personal accounts, movies/TV, sports, and politics. Some of the leading blogs include the Huffington Post, TechCrunch, Mashable!, Gawker, Engadget, the Cor- ner on National Review Online, Think Progress, and the local news/culture “ist” blogs such as gothamist (New York City), chicagoist, laist, and bostonist. Blogs have become part of the information and opinion culture of the Web, giving regular people and citizen reporters a forum for their ideas and views, and providing a place for even professional journalists to informally share ideas before a more formal news story gets published (e.g., the New York Times hosts more than seventy blogs). Specialized\n\n35. search engines for blogs, such as Technorati, BlogPulse, and Google Blogs, help to make sense of the blogosphere, where more than one million blog posts are uploaded each day.6 Wiki Web Sites Another Internet development involves wiki (which means “quick” in Hawaiian) technology. Wiki Web sites enable anyone to edit and contribute to them. There are several large wikis, such as Wikitravel (a global travel guide), WikiMapia (combining Google Maps with wiki com- ments), Wikileaks (an organization publishing leaked sensitive documents by anonymous whistleblowers), and FluWiki (a clearinghouse for influenza pandemic preparation); but the “Twenty-four percent of IM users say they have IM-ed a person who was in the same location as they were—such as their home, an office, or a classroom.” PEW INTERNET & AMERICAN LIFE PROJECT, 2004\n\n36. HUFFINGTON POST, one of the top blogs today, aggregates the latest news in a wide variety of areas ranging from politics and the environment to style and entertainment. Recently, the site launched Twitter editions, gathering the most relevant and interesting Twitter feeds in one place for each of the site’s nineteen sections.

All previous page versions of the Wikipedia are stored, allowing users to see how each individual topic develops. The English version of Wikipedia is the largest, containing more than three million articles, but Wikipedias are also being developed in more than 270 different languages.\n\n37. Although Wikipedia has become one of the most popular resources on the Web, there have been some criticisms of its open editing model. In 2009, a Wikipedia contributor with the gobble- dygook user name “Gfdjklsdgiojksdkf ” listed Senator Ted Kennedy as having died immediately after his well-publicized seizure (the same user also put obscenities on soccer star Mia Hamm’s Wikipedia listing). The misinformation was corrected by Wikipedia’s staff of volunteer editors within five minutes. “Gfdjklsdgiojksdkf ” was quickly banned from editing Wikipedia pages, but some Wikipedia vandalism may take longer to detect and many in the mainstream media contin- ue to criticize Wikipedia’s open architecture as an invitation to inaccuracies and disinformation.7 However, a study by Nature magazine found that Wikipedia’s articles were sometimes poorly written but only slightly less accurate than the traditionally edited Encyclopaedia Britan- nica.8 Moreover, while Wikipedia is never a good primary source for research, it is often useful as an overview of the many angles of a debate, particularly for complex or controversial issues. Wikipedia’s entry on global warming, for example, details the\n\n38. scientific reasons behind the changing world climate, but it also presents the viewpoint that the oil industry manufactured the “debate” about global warming in order to maintain market share. Because all Wikipedia pages are saved as history and because discussion boards can accompany any topic, it can also be a place for people to air their grievances. Social Media Sites The do-it-yourself content of the Internet doesn’t end with blogs and wikis. A whole host of social media sites like MySpace, Facebook, LiveJournal, Hi5, Bebo, Orkut, and LinkedIn are available, and have helped make social networking the most popular activity on the Internet. “In less than three years, the Inter- net’s World Wide Web has spawned some 10 million electronic docu- ments at a quarter million Web sites. By contrast, the Library of Congress has taken 195 years to collect 14 million books.”\n\n39. TIM MILLER, NEW MEDIA RESOURCES, 1995 FACEBOOK cofounder Mark Zuckerberg demonstrates how the social networking site can become the hub where all Internet activity connects. You can post news stories and YouTube videos on your Facebook page, and Web sites like Pandora and Yelp have even integrated with Facebook to automatically share your online radio stations and location reviews with your friends.

In addition to personal profiles, MySpace was known for its music listings, with millions of unsigned, independent,\n\n40. and mainstream artists alike setting up profiles to promote their music, launch new albums, and allow users to buy songs. Its popularity with teens made it a major site for online advertis- ing. That popularity attracted the attention of media conglomerate News Corp., which bought MySpace in 2005. But with competition from Facebook, by 2009 interest in MySpace was waning, and the company laid off about 30 percent of its U.S. staff. Facebook is now the most popular social media site and one of the fastest-growing sites on the Internet. Started at Harvard in 2004 as an online substitute to the printed facebooks the school created for incoming freshmen, Facebook was instantly a hit. The site enables users to construct personal profiles, upload photos, create lists of favorite things, and post messages to connect with old friends and to meet new ones. Originally, access was restricted to college students, but in 2006 the site expanded to include anyone. Soon after, Facebook grew at a rate of more than two million global users a month, and by 2010 more than 500 million active users\n\n41. were posting more than sixty million status updates each day. Another social networking tool—the microblogging service Twitter—has become a quick, flexible counterpart to Facebook that can be accessed via texting, instant messaging, and the Web. Each message (or “tweet”) is limited to 140 characters and generally offers a quick update about what the sender is doing or thinking; a reply isn’t necessarily expected. Twitter users fol- low the feeds of friends or celebrities—like Lady Gaga (the most followed Twitterer in 2010)—or even businesses like CNN or Whole Foods. Ning (for specialized social networks), Google’s Knol (a social knowledge network), and Google Buzz (integrating Google services and Twitter into computer and mobile phone formats) have emerged as the latest social media sites.9 The hallmark of the Internet today is media convergence, the technological merging of content in different mass media. In recent years, the Internet has really become the hub for convergence, a place where music, television shows, radio stations, newspapers, magazines, books, and movies\n\n42. are created, distributed, and presented. Media Convergence First there was the telephone, invented in the 1870s. Then came radio in the 1920s, TV in the 1950s, and eventually the personal computer in the 1970s. Each device had its own unique and distinct function. Aside from a few exceptions, like the clock- radio (popular since the 1950s), that was how electronic devices worked. The advent of the Internet as a mass medium in the 1990s began to change that idea. Computers connected to the Internet allowed an array of digi- tal media—text, photos, audio, and video—to converge in one space and be easily shared. Other devices, like iPods, quickly capitalized on the Internet’s ability to distribute such content. Soon, wireless networks meant that it was possible to access the Internet, and therefore a variety of media, almost anywhere. By the early 2000s, telephones and computers began to encroach on each other’s turf: cell phones had enough computing power, applications, and hard drive space to rival a computer;\n\n43. computers had the ability to make telephone calls, voice-only or with video. Today, computers The Internet Today: From Media Convergence to Web 3.0 “The increasingly common habit of sharing what you’re thinking (Twitter), what you’re reading (StumbleUpon), your finances (Wesabe), your everything (the Web) is becoming a foundation of our culture.” WIRED, 2009 (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 CHAPTER 2 ○ INTERNET���49 (whether desktops, laptops, netbooks, or tablets) and cell phones are the most popular digital devices for online convergence, capable of storing or streaming books, movies, music, video games, and any other form of digital media.\n\n44. Media Converges on Our PCs The rise of the personal computer industry in the mid-1970s first opened the possibility for un- precedented media convergence. A New York Times article on the new “home computers” in 1978 noted that “the long-predicted convergence of such consumer electronic products as television sets, videotape recorders, video games, stereo sound systems and the coming video-disk machines into a computer-based home information-entertainment center is getting closer.”10 However, PC- based convergence didn’t really materialize until a few decades later when broadband Internet connections improved the multimedia capabilities of computers. Finally, by the early 2000s, the computer screen had become a “home-information entertainment center.” Now, a user can access television shows (Hulu and Fancast), movies (Netflix), music (iTunes and Pandora), books (Ama- zon, Google), newspapers, magazines, and lots of other Web content on a computer. And with Skype, iChat, and other live voice and video software, PCs are starting to replace telephones. Media is also converging on our television sets, as the\n\n45. electronics industry begins to manu- facture Internet-ready TVs. Video consoles like the Xbox, Wii, and PS3, and as set-top boxes like Apple TV, Google TV, Roku, and Boxee also offer additional entertainment content access via their Internet connections. In the early years of the Web, it seemed that people would choose only one gateway to the Internet and media content. However, with increasing media convergence and the recent technological developments in various media devices, consumers now regularly use more than one avenue to access all types of content. Smartphones and Touchscreen Technology Mobile telephones have been around for decades (like the giant “brick” mobile phones of the 1970s and 1980s), but the mobile phones of the twenty- first century are substan- tially different creatures—smartphones can be used for activities beyond voice calls, like sending text messages, listening to music, watching movies, and connecting to the Internet. The Blackberry was the first popular Internet-capable\n\n46. smartphone in the United States, introduced in 2002. Users’ ability to check their e-mail messages at any time created addictive e-mail behavior and earned the phones their “Crackberry” nick- name. Convergence on mobile phones took another big leap in 2007 with Apple’s introduction of the iPhone, which combined qualities of its iPod digital music player and telephone and Internet service, all accessed though a sleek touch screen. The next year, Apple opened its App Store, featuring free and low-cost software applications for the iPhone (and iPod Touch and, later, the iPad) created by third-party develop- ers, vastly increasing the utility of the iPhone. By 2010, there were more than 150,000 applications (apps) available to do thousands of things—from playing interactive games and watching movies to finding locations with a GPS or using the iPhone like a carpenter’s level. Indeed, iPhones now compete in a busy smartphone market that includes the Blackberry, Google’s Android operating system phones (e.g., Droid\n\n47. Incredible, Bravo), HP’s Palm Pre, and the Windows Phone 7. In 2010, Apple introduced the iPad, a tablet computer that functions like a larger iPod Touch, making it more suitable for reading magazines, newspapers, and books; watching video; and using visual applications. The company sold over four million iPads in its first four months. Interestingly, the greatest criticisms of the first-generation iPad centered on its limitations for convergence: no camera, no multitasking, no wide-screen for video. However, improvements to GOOGLE’S ANDROID PHONES are proving to be stiff competition for Apple’s ubiquitous iPhone. Americans are now buying more Android phones than iPhones, which could diminish the iPhone’s dominance in the smartphone market.

THE INTERNET, DIGITAL MEDIA, AND MEDIA CONVERGENCE allow for more media convergence in future generations of the iPad is likely, given the competi- tion: In the same year, HP and Samsung readied major introductions of tablets, and Amazon launched a few game apps, including Scrabble, for its established Kindle book reader. A big question confronting many users is which size portable digital device and how many they really need—a laptop computer, a mobile phone, a tablet, two of the devices, or all three? Web 3.0 Many Internet visionaries talk about Web 3.0 as the Semantic Web, a term that gained promi- nence after hypertext inventor Tim Berners-Lee and two coauthors published an influential article in a 2001 issue of Scientific American.11 If “semantics” is the study of meanings, then the Semantic Web is about creating a more meaningful—or more organized—Web. To do that, Web 3.0 promises a layered, connected database of information that software agents will sift through and process automatically for us. Whereas the search engines of\n\n49. Web 2.0 generate relevant Web pages for us to read, the software of Web 3.0 will make our lives even easier as it places the basic information of the Web into meaningful categories— family, friends, calendars, mutual interests, location—and makes significant connections for us. One Web site that already uses some of the principles of Web 3.0 is Freebase.com, a Semantic Web version of Wikipedia. Whereas Wikipedia presents an article for each topic, plus relevant links, Freebase presents a smaller introduction to the topic that is then accompanied by database fields that point a user in relevant directions and to increasingly relevant connec- tions. A Freebase user might read an article about a film, then be connected to an article about that film’s director, then to a list of all the films the director made, then to links to the director’s parents and their associations, and so on. In Web 3.0, a computer—not a human—generates these logical connections. The travel utility of the Bing search engine, which searches a number of airlines and then estimates when prices will rise or fall, hints at Web 3.0 possibilities, as does\n\n50. Wolfram Alpha, a computational search engine that draws on relevant databases for each query. The Next Era: Faster and Wider Access There is debate about what the next era of the Web will be like. Certainly, it will involve even greater bandwidth for faster, more graphically rich 3-D applications. In fact, speed and avail- ability will be critical issues in the Web’s future; applications will require even faster broadband connections, and users will expect wireless connectivity available wherever they go. Higher- speed fiber-optic systems like Verizon’s FiOS and AT&T’s U- verse and upgraded cable technol- ogy by companies like Comcast, Cox, and Cablevision have increased Internet speeds in many U.S. markets, but with prices tiered so that higher speeds cost more. The National Broadband Plan (www.broadband.gov) sent to Congress in 2010 calls for at least 100 million U.S. homes to have affordable access to download speeds of at least 100 megabits per sec- ond (mbps) in the next decade (this would be about twenty-five times the typical broadband down- load speeds of today, and it would greatly improve streaming\n\n51. and downloads of data-rich content like video). The plan also asks for an expansion of spectrum space to allow for greater access to wireless broadband so people can have easier access to the Internet outside of their homes or offices. Google gave its support to the national plan but used its leading position to go one step further, vowing to build experimental all-fiber-optic systems that were even faster than the National Broadband Plan model in several communities to demonstrate that it can be done. The response to Google’s plan was overwhelming, with Google reporting that “hundreds of communities and hundreds of thousands of individuals” expressed interest in the project. “If one message has come through loud and clear,” Google responded, “it’s this: people across the country are hungry for better and faster Internet access.”12 (For more on network access, see “Case Study: Net Neutrality” on page 51.) “You can never be too rich, too thin, or have too much bandwidth.”\n\n52. WALL STREET JOURNAL HEADLINE, 2000 (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 CHAPTER 4 ○ RADIO���51 F or every mass medium, there comes a pivotal time when society must decide whether it will be a democratic medium or not. Now is that time for the Internet. The issue is called net neutrality, and it refers to the principle that every Web site and user—including a multinational corporation or you—has the right to the same Internet network speed and access. The idea of an open and neutral network has existed since the origins of the Internet, but it has never been written into law. Major telephone companies and cable companies, which control 98 percent of broadband access in the United States (through DSL and cable mo- dem service), would like to dismiss net neutrality and give faster connections and greater priority to clients willing to pay higher rates. These companies claim that the money they could make with multitier Internet access will give them the incentive they need to build\n\n53. expensive new networks. Ironically, the telephone and cable companies seem to have had plenty of incentive in the past—they’ve built profitable and neutral networks for more than a decade. Their current drive to dispose of net neutrality appears to be simply a scheme to make more money by mak- ing Internet access less equal. One of the main groups in favor of preserving net neutrality is SavetheInternet.com, a nonprofit coali- tion of more than one million people, Net Neutrality mostly bloggers, video gamers, educa- tors, religious groups, unions, and small businesses. Many large Internet corpo- rations like Yahoo!, Amazon.com, eBay, Skype, and Facebook also support net neutrality because their businesses depend on their millions of custom- ers having equal access to the Web. SavetheInternet.com outlined some of the threats posed by an Internet with- out network neutrality rules: • Small businesses—The little guy will be left in the “slow lane” with inferior Internet service, unable to compete. • Innovators with the next big idea— Start-ups and entrepreneurs will be muscled out of the marketplace by big corporations that pay Internet\n\n54. providers for the top spots on the Web. • iPod listeners—A company like Com- cast could slow access to iTunes, steering you to a higher-priced music service it owns. • Political groups—Political organiz- ing could be slowed by a handful of dominant Internet providers who ask advocacy groups to pay “protection money” for their Web sites and online features to work correctly. • Nonprofits—A charity’s Web site could open at snail-like speeds, and online contributions could grind to a halt if nonprofits don’t pay Internet providers for access to “the fast lane.” The debate over net neutrality contin- ues. In a 2010 case between Comcast and the Federal Communications CASE STUDY Commission (FCC), a federal appeals court ruled in favor of Comcast, which wanted to slow its customers’ access to the file-sharing site BitTorrent. The FCC wanted to stop Comcast from doing so, but the court argued that it did not have the power to regulate Internet Service Providers under cur-\n\n55. rent law.1 In response, Julius Gena- chowski, the chairman of the FCC’ proposed reclassifying the Internet as an essential telecommunication service and reinstating FCC regulatory authority over ISPs to ensure an open, nondiscriminatory broadband network. However, many are frustrated at Gena- chowski’s lack of response to another challenge to net neutrality in 2010— Google and Verizon’s joint proposal that supports regulations for wired Internet connections (e.g., not allowing ISPs to offer a higher cost “fast lane”). But their plan exempts wireless and mobile Internet connections, and future new services, from those rules, which still creates an Internet for the haves, and an Internet for the have-nots, going against the principles of net neu- trality. Congress members, journalists, technology experts, and the public are calling on the FCC to denounce Google and Verizon’s plan and make good on their statements about keeping the Internet free and open. In addition, the SavetheInternet.com Coalition is still petitioning Congress to make a free and open Internet perma- nent with the Net Neutrality Act.

Today, most video games have more complex storylines based in fully fleshed-out worlds. Video games have their origins in electronic arcade amusements like the pinball machines first popularized in the 1930s. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, large video games like Asteroids, Pac Man, and Donkey Kong filled arcades and bars, competing side-by-side with the traditional pinball machines. The story of video games might have ended there had they not transitioned to three other formats: television, computers, and handheld devices. The first video games were developed as novelties by com-\n\n57. puter science students and electronics engineers in the 1950s and 1960s. Since computers were massive mainframes at that time, the distribution of games was limited. German immigrant and television engineer Ralph Baer developed the first home televi- sion video game, called Odyssey. Released by Magnavox in 1972, and sold for $100, Odyssey was based on analog technology and used colored plastic overlays for the television screen and player controllers to move light dots on the screen to play games like tennis, basketball, skiing, and Simon Says. In the same year, a young American computer engineer, Nolan Bushnell, formed a company with a friend to develop video games. They selected a Japanese game term for the com- pany name: Atari. Bushnell’s company created Pong, a simple two- dimensional tennis-style game with two vertical paddles bouncing a white dot back and forth. The game kept score on the screen, and unlike Odyssey, Pong was the first game to have sound, making blip noises when the ball hits the paddles or\n\n58. bounces off the side of the court. Pong quickly became the first big arcade video game. By 1975, Atari began successfully market- ing a home version of Pong through an exclusive deal with Sears, and the new home videogame business was secured. A few years later, Bushnell started the Chuck E. Cheese’s pizza-arcade restaurant chain, and he sold Atari to Warner Communications (now Time Warner). Although Atari folded in 1984, plenty of companies like Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft followed its early lead and transformed the computer and videogame business into an industry that now annually generates more than $20 billion in the United States and $45 billion worldwide.13 In their most basic form, video games involve users in an interactive computer or online environment playing toward a desired outcome. But these days, most video games go beyond a simple competition like Pong: They can contain sweeping narratives with multiple outcomes, imaginative and exciting adventures, and sophisticated problem solving. And when video games\n\n59. crossed the threshold into having multiple players join in via the Internet, they became a form of mass media. Online Gaming With the introduction of the Sega Dreamcast in 1999, the first console to feature a built-in mo- dem, game-playing emerged as an online, multiplayer social activity. The Dreamcast didn’t last, but online connections are now a normal part of console video games, with Internet-connected Video Games and Interactive Environments (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 CHAPTER 2 ○ INTERNET���53 players opposing one another in combat, working together against a common enemy, or team- ing up to achieve a common goal (like sustain a medieval community). Some of the biggest titles have been first-person shooter games like Counter-Strike, an online spin-off of the popular Half- Life console game. Each player views the game from the first- person perspective but also plays\n\n60. in a team as terrorists or counterterrorists. The Internet has also diversified existing games. Football and music enthusiasts playing popular video games like Madden NFL and Rock Band can now engage with others in live online multiplayer play, while young and old alike compete interactively against teams in other loca- tions in Internet-based bowling tournaments using the Wii. The social nature of video games also made them a natural fit for social networking sites. The most famous such game is Lexulous, an online crossword- style game that enables far-flung friends to play against one another. The game, created by two students in India, was originally titled Scrabulous, as it was inspired by the classic board game Scrabble. However, a copyright infringement lawsuit from Scrabble’s owners briefly forced Scrabulous offline; but it returned with its new name in 2008 and is one of the most popular games on Facebook. MMORPGs and Virtual Worlds The Internet also enables a fairly recent form of gaming: the massively multiplayer online\n\n61. role-playing games (MMORPGs). These role-playing games are set in virtual worlds and re- quire users to play through an avatar, their online identity. For example, in the fantasy adven- ture game World of Warcraft, the most popular MMORPG with over eleven million players, users can select from ten different types of avatars, including dwarves, gnomes, night elves, orcs, trolls, and humans. In Second Life, a 3-D game set in real time, players build human avatars, selecting from an array of physical characteristics and clothing, and then use real money to buy virtual land and trade in virtual goods and services. One of the biggest areas in virtual world games is the children’s market. Club Penguin, a moderated virtual world purchased by Disney, allows children to play games and chat as col- orful penguins. The toy maker Ganz developed the online Webkinz game to revive its stuffed ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR MMORPGs, World of Warcraft was first introduced in 2004. Today, it has eleven million subscribers worldwide and is played in eight languages.\n\n62. (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 54���MASS MEDIA AND THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE THE INTERNET, DIGITAL MEDIA, AND MEDIA CONVERGENCE animal sales. Each Webkinz stuffed animal comes with a code for accessing the online game, where players can care for the virtual version of their plush pets. These games not only are fun to play but can be revenue sources for media companies that charge users to play. And in a world where people expect everything online to be free, this is a noted exception. World of Warcraft costs at least $12.99 a month to play, while some like Club Penguin and Dungeons & Dragons Online: Eberron Unlimited are free but charge extra for advanced play or special avatar attributes. Online role-playing games have helped to cement the idea of the Internet as a place of convergence—World of Warcraft, for example, is now a comic book series, a quarterly maga-\n\n63. zine, and a Sam Raimi–directed movie. The “massively multiplayer” aspect of MMORPGs also indicates that video games—once designed for solo or small- group play—have expanded to reach large groups at once, similar to traditional mass media. Consoles, Handheld Devices, and Convergence Through decades of ups and downs in the videogame industry (Atari closed down, Sega no longer makes video consoles), three major console makers emerged (two of which, Microsoft and Sony, were already major media conglomerates and thus well positioned to support and promote their interests in the videogame market). Microsoft’s first foray into videogame con- soles was the Xbox, released in 2001 and linked to the Xbox Live online service in 2002. Xbox Live lets its twenty million subscribers play online and enables users to download new content directly to the console (the Xbox 360, which in 2010 was the third most popular console). Veteran electronics manufacturer Sony has the second most popular console with its PlaySta- tion series, introduced in 1994. Its current console, the PlayStation 3 (PS3), has more than forty\n\n64. million users on its online PlayStation Network. Nintendo’s Wii, released in 2006, supports traditional video games like the New Super Ma- rio Bros., but its unique wireless motion-sensing controller takes the often-sedentary nature out of playing video games. Games like Wii Sports require the user to mimic the full-body motion of bowling or playing tennis, while Wii Fit uses a wireless balance board for interactive yoga, strength, aerobic, and balance games. Although the Wii has lagged behind Xbox and PlaySta- tion in establishing an online community, it is now the best selling of the three major console systems. Videogame consoles, now in their seventh generation, work as part computer, part cable box and are powerful media and entertainment centers. For example, Xbox 360 and PS3 can function as DVD players and digital video recorders (with hard drives of up to 250 GB) and offer access to Twitter, Facebook, blogs, and video chat. All three console systems offer connections to stream Netflix movies, too.\n\n65. Portable players like the top-selling Nintendo DS, released in 2004, and PlayStation Por- table (PSP), released in 2005, are also converged gaming devices. Both are Wi-Fi-capable, so players can interface with other DS or PSP users to play games or even browse the Internet. However, while portable players remain immensely popular (Nintendo DS sold more than 130 million units through 2010), smartphones and touchscreen devices like iPads are catching up.14 After years of relative disinterest in video games, Apple in 2010 introduced Game Center, a social gaming network that allows users to invite friends or find others for multiplayer gam- ing, track their scores, and view high scores on a leader board— things that the DS and PSP do. With more than 86 million iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad devices in circulation, plus more than 50,000 games (like Bejeweled and Angry Birds) available in their App Store, Apple has the elements to make a big impact in the portable videogame business.15 Gaming on smartphones will continue to become more prevalent, especially with Xbox Live access on Microsoft’s\n\n66. Windows Phone 7. “Originally, we weren’t sure how to market the [iPod] Touch. . . . What customers told us was they started to see it as a game machine. We started to market it that way and it just took off.” STEVE JOBS, SEPTEMBER 2009 (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 CHAPTER 2 ○ INTERNET���55 The Economics and Effects of Gaming By 2010, about 60 percent of U.S. households owned a videogame console.16 Although a higher percentage of households have computers, console games (which play on the usually larger screens of a television) and portable handheld games constitute 95 percent of the $10.5 billion videogame market, while computer games are just about 5\n\n67. percent of the market. The entire videogame market, including portable and console hardware and accessories, adds up to $20.2 billion a year.17 These days, the audience for video games defies the stereotype that gam- ers are only young boys. According to the video and computer game industry’s main trade group, the Entertainment Software Association, the average game player is thirty-five years old and has been playing games for twelve years. Women constitute 40 percent of game players, and 25 percent of Americans over fifty play video games. Almost 70 percent of American house- holds play computer or video games.18 Beyond the immediate industry, video games have had a pronounced effect on media culture. Games have inspired movies, such as Super Mario Bros. (1993), Lara Craft: Tomb Raider (2001), and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010). A movie inspired by video games, Tron (1982), spurred an entire franchise of books, comic books, and arcade and console video games in the 1980s; and it was revived a generation later with an Xbox Live game in 2008, a movie sequel\n\n68. (Tron: Legacy) in 2010, and a Disney television series. For many Hollywood blockbusters today, a videogame spin-off is a must-have item. Recent box office hits like Avatar (2009), Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Up (2009), Shrek: Forever After (2010), and Inception (2010) all have companion video games for consoles and portable players. Japanese manga and animé (comic books and animation) have also inspired video games, such as Akira, Astro Boy, and Naruto. Media culture, particularly the commercial nature of it, has had an effect on video games as well. Like television’s infomercials, advergames are video games created for purely promotional purposes. In 1992, Chester Cheetah, the official mascot for Cheetos snacks, starred in two video games for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo systems— Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool and Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild Quest. In late 2006, Burger King sold three Burger King advergame titles for Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles for $3.99 each with value meal purchases. One title, Sneak King, required the player to have\n\n69. the Burger King mascot deliver food to other characters before they faint from hunger. While the commercial objectives of the Burger King games are clear, in-game advertising is often more subtle. In-game advertisements are ads for companies and products that appear as billboards or logos on products in the game environ- ment, or as screen-blocking pop-up ads. In-game ad specialist agency IGA claims to put “hundreds of millions of impressions per week” in video games played on PS3, Wii, and Xbox 306 for clients like McDonald’s, T-Mobile, Geico, AT&T, and Red Bull.19 One major concern about video games is their addictive- ness. An infamous South Park episode from 2006 (“Make Love, Not Warcraft”) satirized the issue of obsessive, addictive behav- ior of videogame playing. Real-life stories, such as that of the South Korean couple whose three-month-old daughter died of malnutrition while the negligent parents spent ten-hour over- night sessions in an Internet café raising a virtual daughter, bring\n\n70. up serious questions about video games and addiction.20 In fact, South Korea, one of the world’s most Internet-connected coun- tries, is already sponsoring efforts to battle Internet addiction.21 SOUTH KOREA, one of the world’s most wired societies, is home to nearly thirty thousand PC bangs, or Internet gaming cafés. Most of them are open twenty- four hours a day and serve food, giving their customers no reason to leave. It is estimated that these cafés generate close to $6 billion a year in revenue.

The Future of Gaming Technology Gaming technology of the future promises both a more immersive experience and a more porta- ble experience. The Wii system has been successful in harnessing more interactive technology to attract nongamers with motion-controlled games. More motion- controlled gaming is expected, with wireless controls to detect more of players’ body movements and even facial expressions. One such system is Microsoft’s Kinect system, which uses a sensor camera to capture full-body player motion. “You are the controller,” Microsoft’s slogan says, in advance of a late 2010 sched- uled release date. The Kinect will also recognize players’ voices and faces, making on-screen avatars more accurate likenesses of the players themselves. With Xbox Live, players will also be able to interact in full video or avatar form with friends online.22 In light of Hollywood’s great success with 3-D movies, television set production and video games have moved toward 3-D experiences, with PlayStation rolling out 3-D games in the summer of 2010.\n\n72. Nintendo also plans on a 3-D version of its handheld Nintendo DS that doesn’t require special glasses. Video games in the future will also continue to move beyond just entertainment. Games already are used in workforce training, for social causes, in classrooms, and as part of multime- dia journalism. For example, to accompany related news stories, the New York Times developed an interactive game, Gauging Your Distraction, to demonstrate the consequences of distractions like cell phones on driving ability.23 All these developments continue to make games a larger part of our media experiences. One of the unique things about the Internet is that no one owns it. But that hasn’t stopped some corporations from trying to control it. Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which overhauled the nation’s communication regulations, most regional and long- distance phone companies and cable operators have competed against one another in the Internet access business. However, there is more to controlling the Internet than being the service provider for it. Companies have realized the potential of\n\n73. dominating the Internet business through search engines, software, social networking, and perhaps most impor- tant, advertising. Ownership and control of the Internet is connected to three Internet issues that command much public attention: the security of personal and private information, the appropriateness of online materials, and the accessibility of the Internet. Important questions have been raised: Should personal or sensitive government information be private, or should the Internet be an enormous public record? Should the Internet be a completely open forum, or should certain types of communications be limited or prohibited? Should all people have equal access to the Internet, or should it be available only to those who can afford it? With each of these issues there have been heated debates, but no easy resolutions. Ownership: Dividing Up the Web By the end of the 1990s and Web 1.0, four companies—Yahoo!, Microsoft, AOL, and Google— had emerged as the leading forces on the Internet, each with a different business angle. AOL\n\n74. The Economics and Issues of the Internet “One of the more remarkable features of the computer network on which much of the world has come to rely is that nobody owns it. That does not mean, however, that no one controls it.” AMY HARMON, NEW YORK TIMES, 1998 (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 CHAPTER 2 ○ INTERNET���57 attempted to dominate the Internet as the top ISP, connecting millions of home users to its proprietary Web system through dial-up access. Yahoo!’s method has been to make itself an all-purpose entry point—or portal—to the Internet. Computer software behemoth Micro-\n\n75. soft’s approach began by integrating its Windows software with its Internet Explorer Web browser, drawing users to its MSN.com site and other Microsoft applications. Finally, Google made its play to seize the Internet with a more elegant, robust search engine to help users find Web sites. Three of the four major Web 1.0 Internet companies transformed themselves in the rapidly changing era of Web 2.0 by buying promising Internet start-ups and constantly up- dating their product. One of the companies from the Web 1.0 era, AOL, never recovered in the shift from dial-up to broadband connections. AOL’s early success led to the huge AOL–Time Warner corporate merger of 2001, but its technological shortcomings in broad- band contributed to its devaluation and eventual spin-off from Time Warner in 2009. In- stead, social networking giant Facebook emerged as one of the new top Internet companies of Web 2.0 (see Table 2.1). Google\n\n76. Google, established in 1998, had instant success with its algorithmic search engine, which now controls over 70 percent of the search market and generates billions of dollars of revenue yearly through the pay-per-click advertisements that accompany key- word searches. Google also has branched out into a number of other Internet offerings, including shopping (Froogle), mapping (Google Maps), e-mail (Gmail), blogging (Blogger), browsing (Chrome), books (Google Book Search), video (YouTube), and mobile phones (Android operating system). Google has also challenged Microsoft’s Office programs with Google Apps, an online bundle of “cloud” word processing, spreadsheet, calendar, IM, and e-mail software. Google’s most significant recent investments have been its purchase of DoubleClick, one of the Internet’s leading advertising placement companies, and AdMob, a mobile phone ad placement company. (See “What Google Owns” on page 59.) Microsoft Microsoft built a nearly monopolistic dominance of the Internet through\n\n77. the merger of its Windows operating systems and its Internet Explorer TABLE 2.1 TOP 10 WEB PARENT COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES, 2010 Source: Nielsen NetView, June 2010 1 Google 158,496,000 1:57:35 2 Microsoft 135,305,000 1:54:57 3 Yahoo! 129,783,000 2:24:15 4 Facebook 122,337,000 6:43:22 5 AOL 80,065,000 2:03:56 6 News Corp.

Because of this, the U.S. Department of Justice brought an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft in 1997, arguing that it used its computer op- erating system dominance to sabotage competing browsers. However, Microsoft prevailed in 2001 when the Department of Justice dropped its efforts to break Microsoft into two independent companies. European Union regulators were much\n\n79. more aggressive in their antitrust actions against Microsoft, ruling against the company in 2004 and levying a total of about $2.5 billion in fines against Microsoft through 2008 after it found the company proceeded too slowly in sharing interoperability information with other software makers. Today, Microsoft’s presence remains considerable: The company continues to operate the most popular Web browser (Internet Explorer) and also owns one of the leading free Web e-mail services (Hotmail), a top Internet service provider (MSN), a popular instant messag- ing service (MSN Messenger), a search engine (Bing), and an Internet-connected videogame console (Xbox). Yahoo! After it was established in 1994, Yahoo! quickly grew into a major Internet property by dominat- ing the Web directory portion of the market and, initially, the search engine portion as well. Although its directory and search engine were eclipsed by Google’s, Yahoo! ranks as the third most popular search site. After acquiring the key algorithmic\n\n80. search indexes Overture and Inktomi in 2003, Yahoo! began to compete directly with Google and to aggressively market to users by including sponsored links with search results. Collectively, Yahoo! sites—which include Yahoo! Travel, Flickr, Rivals, Yahoo! Kids, and HotJobs—are the third most visited group of Inter- net sites. Yahoo! also offers popular e-mail, instant messaging, and shopping services. In 2010, Yahoo! bought Associated Content, a Web-content provider of text, audio, video, and images, to increase its online offerings. Facebook Of all the leading Internet sites, Facebook is the “stickiest,” with users staying on the social networking site an average of 6 hours and 43 minutes each day. Facebook’s large audience (more than 500 million active users around the globe) for mainly a single service puts it in a similar position to Google’s: It can leverage users by selling contextual advertis- ing. Because Facebook users reveal so much about themselves in their profiles and posted messages, Facebook is able to connect users’ social actions to\n\n81. advertisers in order to increase ad relevance. For example, users discussing an upcoming wedding may see ads for wedding- related services alongside their posts. In 2010, Facebook was still owned by relatively few shareholders and small stakes held by Microsoft and Digital Sky Technologies, and it gener- ated up to $2 billion in profits. As the Wall Street Journal noted, when Facebook decides to finally sell stock to the general public, founder Mark Zuckerberg could become “the world’s GOOGLE makes advertisers’ jobs easier by scanning e-mail and matching up relevant ads with key words in user’s messages. For example, a hotel confirmation e-mail for your stay in Chicago might be accompanied by ads for air travel deals to Chicago on the side. “Despite Yahoo’s huge audience of more than 600 million worldwide users a month . . . Google and Facebook have all the momentum.”\n\n82. NEW YORK TIMES, 2010 (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 richest twenty-something.”24 Still, as a young company, Facebook has suffered growing pains as it tries to balance its corporate interests (capitalizing on its millions of users) and its users’ interest in controlling the privacy of their own information at the same time. Targeted Advertising and Data Mining In the early years of the Web, advertising took the form of traditional display ads placed on pages. The display ads were no more effective than newspaper or magazine advertisements (despite the fact that they would sometimes blink), and because they reached small, general audiences they weren’t very profitable. But in the late 1990s, Web advertising began to shift to search engines. Paid links appeared as “sponsored links” at the top, bottom, and side of a search engine result list and even, depending on the search engine, within the “objective” result\n\n83. list itself. Every time a user clicks on a sponsored link, the advertiser pays the search engine for the click-through. For online shopping, having paid placement in searches can be a good thing. But search engines doubling as ad brokers may undermine the utility of search engines as neutral locators of Web sites (see “Media Literacy and the Critical Process: Search Engines and Their Commercial Bias” on page 61). Advertising has since spread to other parts of the Internet, including social networking sites, e-mail, and IM—all activities in which computer users reveal something about themselves and their interests. For advertisers—who for years struggled with how to measure people’s at- tention to ads—these activities make advertising easy to track, effective in reaching the desired niche audience, and relatively inexpensive because ads get wasted less often on the disinter- ested. For example, Yahoo! gleans information from search terms, Google scans the contents of Gmail messages, and Facebook uses profile information (age, gender, location, interests, etc.)\n\n84. to deliver individualized ads to users’ screens. Similarly, a mobile social networking application for smartphones, Foursquare, encourages users to earn points and “badges” by checking in at business locations, such as museums, restaurants, and airports (or other user-added locations), and to share that information via Twitter, Facebook, and text messages. Foursquare promises to “unlock your world and find happiness just around the corner.”25 But by gathering users’ location and purchasing habits, Foursquare also operates as a consumer surveillance and data- collecting database. A related Internet security issue is the unethical gathering of data, or data mining. Mil- lions of people, despite knowing that transmitting personal information online can make them vulnerable to online fraud, have embraced the ease of e- commerce: the buying and selling of products and services on the Internet, which took off in 1995 with the launch of Amazon.com. What many people don’t know is that their personal information may be used without their knowledge for commercial purposes, such as targeted\n\n85. advertising. In 2007, tens of thousands of Facebook users protested when the site began tracking what members bought at affiliated sites (like Travelocity.com) and then alerted their friends about those purchases. Facebook relented and said it wouldn’t release online shopping information anymore without a member’s approval. One common method that commercial interests use to track the browsing habits of computer users is cookies, or information profiles that are automatically collected and transferred between computer servers whenever users access Web sites. The legitimate purpose of a cookie is to verify that a user has been cleared for access to a particular Web site, such as a library database that is open only to university faculty and students. How- ever, cookies can also be used to create marketing profiles of Web users to target them for advertising. Many Web sites require the user to accept cookies in order to gain access to the site.\n\n86. WHAT GOOGLE OWNS Consider how Google connects to your life; then turn the page for the bigger picture.

Spyware can be used to send pop-up ads to users’ computer screens, to enable unauthorized parties to collect personal or account informa- tion of users, or even to plant a malicious click-fraud program on a computer, which generates phony clicks on Web ads that force an advertiser to pay for each click. In 1998, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) developed fair information practice principles for online privacy to address the unauthorized collection of personal data. These principles require Web sites to (1) disclose their data-collection practices, (2) give consumers the option to choose whether or not their data may be collected and provide information on how that data is collected, (3) permit individuals access to their records to ensure data accuracy, and (4) secure personal data from unauthorized use. Unfortunately, the FTC has\n\n89. no power to enforce these principles, and most Web sites either do not self-enforce them or deceptively appear to enforce them when they in fact don’t.26 As a result, consumer and privacy advocates are calling for stronger regulations, such as requiring Web sites to adopt opt-in or opt-out policies. Opt-in policies, favored by consumer and privacy advocates, require Web sites to obtain explicit permission from consumers before the sites can collect browsing history data. Opt-out policies, favored by data-mining corporations, allow for the automatic collection of browsing history data unless the consumer requests to “opt out” of the practice. Security: The Challenge to Keep Personal Information Private When you watch television, listen to the radio, read a book, or go to a film, you do not need to provide personal information to others. However, when you use the Internet, whether you are signing up for an e-mail account, shopping online, or even just surfing the Web, you give away personal information—voluntarily or not. As a result,\n\n90. government surveillance, online fraud, and unethical data-gathering methods have become common, making the Internet a potentially treacherous place. Government Surveillance Since the inception of the Internet, government agencies worldwide have obtained communica- tion logs, Web browser histories, and the online records of individual users who thought their online activities were private. In the United States, for example, the USA PATRIOT Act (which be- came law about a month after the September 11 attacks in 2001 and was renewed in 2006) grants sweeping powers to law enforcement agencies to intercept individuals’ online communications, including e-mail messages and browsing records. Intended to allow the government to more easily uncover and track potential terrorists and terrorist organizations, many now argue that the PATRIOT Act is too vaguely worded, allowing the government to unconstitutionally probe the personal records of citizens without probable cause and for reasons other than preventing terrorism. Moreover, searches of the Internet permit law\n\n91. enforcement agencies to gather huge amounts of data, including the communications of people who are not the targets of an investi- gation. For example, a traditional telephone wiretap would intercept only communication on a single telephone line. Internet surveillance involves tracking all of the communications over an ISP, which raises concerns about the privacy of thousands of other users. (To learn more about international government surveillance, see “Global Village: China’s Great Firewall” on page 62.) Online Fraud In addition to being an avenue for surveillance, the Internet is increasingly a conduit for online robbery and identity theft, the illegal obtaining of personal credit and identity information WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? Every Google product is designed to keep you on the Web. The longer you browse, the more money Google makes. • Cost. It cost $1.84 billion to run Google from January to March 2010.\n\n92. • Revenue. Google’s revenues continue to rise ($23.6 billion in 2009), allowing Google to invest heavily in technological innovation.1 • Operating System. Google created Chrome OS to compete head-to-head with Microsoft Windows. It also keeps users constantly online, making them available for data collection and targeted advertising.2 • Advertising. Advertising provides 97 percent of Google’s revenue.3 Nearly every Web site holds a Google ad slot, so every second users spend on the Web is revenue for Google. • Market Value. In August 2004, Google shares were first traded at an initial price of $85 a share.4 In 2010, one share of Google stock cost around $500, more than six times the initial price. • Datacenters. Google’s searches are run by massive datacenters. It is estimated that Google\n\n93. operates about nineteen datacenters in the United States, twelve in Europe, one in Russia, one in South America, and three in Asia.5 • Employees. Google had 20,621 employees in 2010, almost 800 more than in 2009.6 Google also rents goats to clear brush in the fields around its Mountain View, California, headquarters.7 (c) Bedford/St. Martin's bedfordstmartins.com 1-457-62096-0 / 978-1-457-62096-6 CHAPTER 2 ○ INTERNET���61 in order to fraudulently spend other peoples’ money. Computer hackers have the ability to infiltrate Internet databases (from banks to hospitals to even the Pentagon) to obtain personal information and to steal credit card numbers from online retailers. Identity theft victimizes hundreds of thousands of people a year, and clearing one’s name can take a very long time and cost a lot of money. More than $12 billion worldwide is lost to online fraud artists every year.\n\n94. One particularly costly form of Internet identity theft is known as phishing. This scam involves phony e-mail messages that appear to be from official Web sites—such as eBay, PayPal, or the user’s university or bank—asking customers to update their credit card numbers, account pass- words, and other personal information. Search Engines and Their Commercial Bias How valuable are search engines for doing research? Are they the best resources for academic information? To test this premise, we’re going to do a search for the topic “obesity,” which is prevalent in the news and a highly contro- versial topic.1 DESCRIPTION. Here’s what we find in the first thirty results from Google: numerous sites for obesity research organizations (e.g., Obesity Society, MedicineNet, WebMD) and many government-funded sites like the CDC and NIH. Here’s what we find in the top-rated results from Bing: numerous sponsored sites (e.g., the Scooter Store, Gastric Banding) and the same obesity\n\n95. research organizations. 2 ANALYSIS. A closer look at these results reveals a subtle but interesting pattern: All the sites listed in the top ten results (of both search engine result lists, and with the important exception of Wikipedia) offer loads of advice to help an individual lose weight (e.g., change eating habits, exercise, undergo surgery, take drugs). These “professional-looking” sites all frame obesity as a disease, a genetic disorder, or the result of personal inactivity. In other words, they put the blame squarely on the individual. But where is all the other research that links high obesity rates to social factors (e.g., constant streams of advertising for junk food, government subsidies of the giant corn syrup food sweetener industry, deceptive labeling\n\n96. practices)? These society-level views are not apparent in our Web searches. Media Literacy and the Critical Process 3 INTERPRETATION. What does it mean that our searches are so biased? Consider this series of connec- tions: Obesity research organizations manufacture drugs and promote surgery treatments to “cure” obese individuals. They seem to offer legitimate informa- tion about the “obesity disease,” but they are backed by big business, which is interested in selling more junk food (not taking social responsibility) and then promoting drugs to treat people’s obesity problems. These wealthy sites can pay for placement through Search Engine Optimizer firms (which work re-\n\n97. lentlessly to outsmart Google’s page rank algorithm) and by promoting themselves through various marketing channels to ensure their popularity—Google ranks pages by popularity). With the exception of Wikipedia, which is so interlinked it usually ranks high in search engines, search results today are skewed toward big business. Money speaks. 4 EVALUATION. Commercial search engines have evolved to be much like the commercial mass media: They tend to reflect the corporate perspective that finances them. This does not bode well for the researcher, who is interested in many angles of a single issue. Controversy is at the heart of every important research question. 5 ENGAGEMENT. What to do? Start by including the word controversy next to the search term, as\n\n98. in “obesity and controversy.” Or learn about where alternative information sources exist on the Web. A search for “obesity” on the independent media publications AlterNet, MediaChannel, Common Dreams, and Salon, for ex- ample, and nonprofit digital archives like ibiblio and INFOMINE, will offer count- less other perspectives to the obesity epidemic. Let’s also not dismiss Wiki- pedia, a collaboratively built nonprofit encyclopedia that often lays out the con- troversies within a given research topic and can be a helpful launching pad for scholarly research. Good research does not mean clicking on the first link on a search engine list; it involves knowing that every topic has political, economic,\n\n99. and ideological biases, and looking for valuable and diverse perspectives.

Media theorist Marshall McLuhan wrote in 1972 that “the wired planet has no boundaries and no monopolies of knowledge.”1 In 2000, Microsoft leader Bill Gates said, “The Internet is a constantly changing global network that knows no borders.”2 But as the Internet has matured and global communications have grown more widespread, the real, political borders of nations are making them- selves known. This trend became most evident with the operation of the Internet in China. Over 384 million Chinese are online—less than a third of the country’s population of 1.34 billion, but constituting enough In- ternet users to be the world’s largest online population. However, in rapidly modernizing China, where for decades the Communist Party has tightly\n\n100. controlled mass communication, the openness of the Internet has led to a clash of cultures. As more and more Chinese citizens take to the Internet, an estimated thirty thousand government censors monitor or even block their use of Web pages, blogs, chat rooms, and e-mails. This surveillance constitutes what some now call the “Great Firewall of China.” Many Chinese Internet service providers and Webmasters learn to self-censor to avoid attracting atten- tion. For those who persist in practic- ing “subversive” free speech, there can be severe penalties: Paris-based Reporters without Borders (www.rsf .org) reports that thirty journalists and seventy-two netizens are in Chinese prisons for writing articles and blogs that criticized the government. China’s Great Firewall Reporters without Borders also states that the promises for a more open Internet made by the Chinese regime at the time of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing have not come to pass. Instead, govern- ment surveillance and crackdowns re- main commonplace. For example, in 2009 China blocked Internet news about the twentieth anniver- sary of the govern- ment’s violent\n\n101. suppression of student protest- ers at Tiananmen Square. “A dozen websites such as Twitter, YouTube, Bing, Flickr, Opera, Live, WordPress, and Blogger were blocked,” Reporters without Borders notes. “The information blackout has been so well enforced for the last 20 years that the vast majority of young Chi- nese citizens are not even aware that the events of June 1989 ever happened.”3 U.S. Internet corporations like Yahoo!, Google, and Microsoft were eager to establish a foothold in the massive Chi- nese market and promote the liberating possibilities of the Internet. Yet in much- criticized decisions, all three companies censored information to appease Chi- nese authorities. For example, in 2006 Google created a new search engine for China, Google.cn, that filtered out offending sites, including many relating to Tibetan independence, the Tianan- men Square massacre, the Falun Gong religion, and even BBC News. Moreover, the Google.cn site stripped away e-mail and blog features because they might be used for political protest. In January 2010, Google announced it would stop censoring searches on its\n\n102. GLOBAL VILLAGE Google China (www.google.cn) Web site, even if doing so jeopardized its business there. Google also reported that it and more than twenty other companies from the United States had been victims of Internet surveillance from China, and that one goal of the attackers was to infiltrate the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights advocates. Google automatically redi- rected its Chinese search service to its uncensored service in Hong Kong (www .google.com.hk), while mainland China continued to block us- ers from several Google services. However, in July 2010, China renewed Google’s license to operate after Google appeased the Chinese authori- ties by abandoning the auto-direct and placing an image of their search box on Google.cn, which when clicked on, takes"
