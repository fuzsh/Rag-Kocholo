        "text": "Comments: For Nicole.\n\nThis is supposed to become a totally Bohemian movie review. Moulin Rouge by Baz Luhrmann (20th Century Fox, 2001) has been the only movie in the last 20 or so years that I went 6 times to the cinema for. During all those years I didn't watch any other movie more than once, be it Ghost or Bodyguard or Titanic or any other. However, when I saw Moulin Rouge for the first time, at the beginning of December 2001, 5 minutes into it, I asked my wife \"let's go home\". This was when Christian starts to sing \"Sound of Music\". What, I thought, has a song of the 50s to do with a story set in 1899 Paris? My wife said, that she's gonna see this movie. OK. I closed my eyes and tried to sleep. I couldn't. When the moon sings over Christian and Satine to \"Your song\", I still thought, \"we're being treated to some kitsch here\". After a short while, when my wife bent over and whispered \"OK, let's go home\" (she told me later, that this wasn't because she disliked the movie - she also watched it 6 times - but in order not to torture me any further), I just mumbled something of me now seeing this movie, without taking my eyes off the screen. Just put your old European expectations of how a movie set in 1899 Paris has to look aside for a moment and be open for something new, I told myself. - To tell the truth, however, in the meantime Satine had appeared alone in her room at night, looking like, what I imagine, the ancient Greek goddesses of youth, beauty and love put together into one person must have looked like. - I had gotten some affection for Satine. This went so far - believe this - that, when in December 2001 the radio reported, that bush fires had encircled Sydney, Australia, my heart stopped for three seconds, and I thought, \"Is she OK?\" Of course, I immediately scolded myself \"Satine and Nicole Kidman are two quite different persons, Thomas.\" Nevertheless every time the following days, when I heard about those nasty bush fires, it bothered me. Really. (To be sure, Thomas is the name of the author of this little essay.)\n\nWell, back to the Moulin Rouge. What was it that had touched me so deeply, that I went six times to see it? By the way, I also became the proud owner of the soundtrack CD, the picture catalog (in Japanese, which I can barely read) and the Moulin Rouge mouse pad. (\"Never knew I could feel like this.\")\n\nIt might have been, because I could personally relate to the story. Many years ago, there was me, in the role of the boy, and then there was she. We fell in love. Next the girl was almost gonna \"end up on the street\", literally. She was an expat student and had to move out of the cheap dormitory, without the means to get into another flat while continuing college. I was the young, penniless student, whose graduation and money making was still a few years in the future. Then a he turned up, who she had at least known for years already, as she proved to me with photographs. He had just graduated and was about to get a job. She invited me to his graduation party. I invited her to my birthday party, where she showed up together with him. After some time, he had gotten the point, and invited her to move together with him to that new, large flat with enough separate room for the both, as she told me. But even after they had finally moved, I refused to get the point. We continued to call and see each other. So, once she invited me to their new place and showed me around, including their common bedroom. At that moment, I felt like poor Christian, when Satine was in the gothic tower (\"I don't want you to sleep with him\" - Ewan McGregor, I felt exactly like Christian.). Yeah, like several megatons of explosives going off inside my body. Went over my budget to drive back to the dorm by taxi, sitting there all the time with the hands pressed against my face, inside of me the vast ground zero. What might the driver have thought? We continued to call each other. One day, she called me and invited me for a cup of tea to their place on this afternoon. I went there. After an hour, he came back from work. On this day, a large spaceship had exploded 73 seconds after takeoff. The three of us speechlessly watched a TV screen showing a seemingly flawless takeoff into a blue, bright sky, then suddenly a huge cloud of fire and smoke, and then debris raining down into the sea. I walked back to the dorm, 2 hours through an icy January night. Hope, that she's happy now and if she finds this on the Net, can have a big laugh. She's always liked big laughs. I had my laugh, too.\n\nIt might have been the music, what drew me to this movie. Tunes that I knew and loved, some since my teen days, like \"Your song\" and \"Lady Marmalade\" and \"Up where we belong\" and most of the others. My mother tongue not being English, I had only known and loved the tunes, however in this movie, for the first time, the pronunciation being so clear, I understood the words and found it to be such beautiful poetry.\n\nWell, was it Satine? Satine, the gorgeous cabaret performer, Satine, the hungry can-can dancer trying to get a duke interested in her, Satine, the mind-blowing \"smoldering temptress\" in the elephant, Satine, the wonderful team player in the presentation of the show to the duke, Satine in the scene on top of the elephant, where she's not a cold, cynical courtesan, but a soft and sweet young woman, trying in vain to hide her feelings, with a wonderful soprano voice (\"You'd think, that people would've had enough of silly love songs\"), Satine, the young girl having fun being in love (in the scene when Zidler detects her kissing in the gallery), Satine, the caring older sister, trying to explain to Christian, that they've got to end it, after he had gotten mad at her for her the night before failing to hike over to his damp, dirty room to spend the night with him, Satine, the grand dame in the gothic tower (\"I indulge in his fantasies, because he's talented\"), Satine, the loving woman driven to the edge, after Christian has let her down so badly (proposing a mere \"let's run away\" and sending her back to the Moulin Rouge \"to collect her belongings, nobody must see her, you understand\", when she cries in his arms, and not even getting the point when she cues him a second time the other morning \"the duke has promised me everything\", then he a hollow \"there must be something else\". Well, there is. Look for it inside of yourself, Christian.). For the rest of my life, when I hear the tune \"Rhythm of the night\", I'll see Satine on the dance floor of the Moulin Rouge in a dream of pink feathers. Nicole Kidman, I was impressed, as I never was before in my life.\n\nWas it the plot? Toulouse's (John Leguizamo) plot, so simple, brutal and effective as usually only real-life plots are. Use Satine to make both the duke and the writer hot, and play them against each other, to get the best out of both for the show. Towards the end, when Toulouse once again turns the heat up on Christian (\"I know it with every fiber of my being, she loves you, she loves you\"), does he know, that the duke has threatened to kill Christian? It appears, that Toulouse hasn't heard yet of that threat, which the duke had already made, however having seen the duke's moves up to that point, it probably wasn't too difficult for Toulouse - capable of getting such a plot off the ground - to figure out, what his next move would be. What Toulouse does know at this point is, that Christian isn't a Bohemian, but rather a bourgeois, one of the shabby sort.\n\nWas it the exposure of human weakness? The weakness of us mortals to understand fast enough, what the next move of the other person must be, to see the potential of the current situation to be turned for the good. I came to this when thinking about, who the bad guy and the hero of the story are. The bad guy is Christian. Christian, the inexperienced boy. By the way, I found it refreshing to see a Christian in this movie, among all those live-savvy Daves, Sams and Bens, who crowd the silver screen in so many other movies. Christian sets off with \"my gift is my song\" and \"all you need is love\" and \"I don't have much money\" and \"I'd buy you a big house\". Well, that's fine for a start. He then gladly takes Satine's love for a couple of days or weeks, yet when a problem occurs - Satine telling him, that they've got to end it &#8211; he proposes just, that he won't get jealous if she sleeps with the duke, and to make another love song for her. Wasn't this the moment to come forward with a realistic proposal for their common future? In the afternoon of the same day, when the duke demands a new ending to the show - a tall order one day before the debut - he just stands there and watches his Satine walk towards the duke, very, very slowly. Wasn't this the moment for him to shout \"OK, I'll write a new ending, I'll do it in one hour!\" To run past Satine, to prostrate himself in front of the duke and beg him, beg him. The duke probably would have yielded. The show crew and the entire movie audience would have rejoiced, he would have been a hero. Just a few seconds ago, his new love song went like \"there's no mountain too high, no river too wide, sing out this song and I'll be there by your side\". Satine is walking towards the duke now, without you, Christian. Just 10 meters between you and her. What are you waiting for? Her call? See, Christian, this is one of those moments in life, when you alone have to figure out who you are, where you stand, what you can do, and yes, how to show, whether you deserve it, that this woman, this jewel, this treasure, lets you merge your genes with hers, and spend time and energy for your kids. (The latter the core of Christian's jealousy. Also one major objective that \"we are living for\". Otherwise the show wouldn't go on.) The mountain too high, Christian, may be, that you don't distinguish between life on stage and off stage. Letting the Indian courtesan choose the Maharaja on stage might well have left the possibility open for Satine to choose you off stage. The river too wide may be your memory of your dad shouting at you \"you&#8217;re gonna end up wasting your life with a can-can ...\". Boy, if you see her this way, boy, then. Don't call it love. Don't place orders. Run, boy, run. - Satine doesn't cue him now. Maybe she's become a bit cautious after her experience in the morning. So, after half a minute of almost unbearable silence, Satine reaches in front of the duke, and proposes a dinner for the both of them, the ending of the show to be decided between her and him after dinner. And Christian's got a few hours of bad suffering. Satine, too. In the same night, Satine comes to his room, and cries in his arms. She'd had a horrible experience with the duke. Wasn't this the moment for Christian to say \"Have a seat, Satine, we'll work that out. I can give you a home. I can write songs, I can write show scripts, I can sing. I can work in a factory. I can sell hot-dogs in the street. We'll gonna make it, what do you think?\" And they could have lived a Bohemian life happily ever after (even back in the 19th century, when intellectual property was still an alien concept in Europe, and artwork just worth the meals of the creator during writing). But what does he? Sends her back to the brothel to pack her things - \"Let's run away. I'll wait for you here.\" And there, she of course gets picked up by her manager. Who tells her in no uncertain terms, what he thinks is gonna happen next. The other morning Satine gives Christian one more chance, begging him \"the duke has promised me everything\" - and draws another blank. So, some more even worse suffering for Christian, and also for Satine. What Christian next does to Satine, after she&#8217;s tried to get rid of him with a cold \"you shouldn&#8217;t be here, Christian\", in front of the entire show crew and the debut audience, is so mean, so horrendous, that even a hard-driving nightclub manager like Harold Zidler freezes up for a couple of seconds. Wasn't this the moment for the duke to get up from his warm, comfortable front-row seat, step onto the stage, take Satine in his arms, declare, that he's the real Maharaja, and that he's gonna marry her now, right on the spot. Probably to the roaring applause of the full audience. But no, it doesn't happen. Although he appeared to have had some affection for her. Or, if not the duke: Wasn't this the moment for Harold Zidler, playing the Maharaja, to lift Satine up from the floor, comfort her, and speak his wedding vows? But what does he? The first thing he does is collect the money strewn in front of her, next tell her, that \"the show must go on\" and then demand wedding vows from her. Satine finally gets up on her own, and starts to sing \"The lover's secret song\". No, no wedding vows from her. Christian, already on his way out, returns to her and comforts her in the final minute of her life. She dies on stage, from \"consumption\". The Japanese subtitles translate back as \"tuberculosis\", however isn't it rather, that she's been consumed by Harold Zidler, by the duke and by Christian? Consumed by trying to fill too many orders, by not being tough enough? Nobody could have prevented Satine from dying, however Christian could have made her remaining days happy ones. So she dies in the arms of a fool, her only hope being, that he at least tells her story truthfully, so that her suffering might not have been entirely in vain. Christian doesn't deserve to hold her in this moment; his tears are lies. Christian, the young, talented writer with the great voice, who got so much credit at the beginning (\"he&#8217;s a genius\", \"he's got a gift with the women\"), is at this point of the movie a big disappointment, a narrow-minded egoist, a mean liar. Satine is a hero, she's fought bravely for Christian's love, until the very end. She doesn't get rewarded. Hard to swallow for the onlooker.\n\nWas it, that Christian seems - during the entire story - not to understand what he&#8217;s talking about when he says, \"all you need is love\", \"love overcoming all obstacles\". For him, love seems to mean mutual, or even one-way, affection, desire and, well, that chemistry of the bodies, which must match. However is that \"all you need\" &#8211; down here, where we \"material girls\" (and boys) need to tend to our worldly bodies every day, for an uncertain span of time? Aren&#8217;t there three more components to love to make that statement \"all you need is love\" true, to make it reality? One to be an expressed, realistic, long-term commitment to do a task together. Romeo in Shakespeare&#8217;s Romeo and Juliet knows this. Christian promises only \"I won't get jealous if you sleep with the duke\". The other one will and discipline to overcome the obstacles, to keep \"the show going on\". Christian breaks his tiny promise on the day he&#8217;s made it. Romeo fails here, too, but in a different, more indirect way. The third one to see in the loved one a person, an individual, like oneself, whose way of thinking, whose aspirations, whose opinions, whose situation have to be understood and respected. Christian seems to think, that after he&#8217;s sung for his Satine a couple of love songs, she&#8217;s a piece of property, which jumps to short, sharp commands (\"Where were you last night?\", \"I don't want you to sleep with him.\")\n\nWas it the tough manager Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent)? A - unsung - hero in the story, who's still the fastest when it comes to turn an edgy situation to the good? With that dark, warm voice. When Satine falls during her performance and can't get back to the stage. When she coughs out her lungs on the evening the duke is waiting for her in the gothic tower. When, what had been a magnificent debut performance of \"Spectacular Spectacular\", some unforeseen events suddenly almost turn it into a complete disaster.\n\nWas it the duke, the well-mannered gentleman (Richard Roxburgh)? Who knows his strengths and his weaknesses, therefore does his very best to win Satine's heart, even after he's practically bought her from Zidler. Until he looses composure completely in that fateful night in the gothic tower, when only an angel prevents him from committing a crime. Satine in the belief, that it had been her decision to sacrifice this night for the entire crew and for her Christian, the duke in the belief, that she knows Zidler sold her to him, in return for his part of the deal, which he had fulfilled.\n\nWas it the message, that, if we tell the truth to each other (the other major objective that \"we are living for\". Without that, the show wouldn't go on, either.), our world will inch towards getting a better place, with less suffering? See, here is Christian telling the story of Satine and himself. How he failed and caused suffering. (It required Satine to cue her boy to do the telling. Her last wish.) Without pretense, without hiding, just what he saw, how he felt and what he thought. So that we can have a deep sigh of relief and a big laugh when it's over and done with, and can maneuver better, causing less suffering, through a similar situation, should it happen to us. Because we slow-thinking mortals had some time to figure out, what could have been done. By telling us the truth, Christian suddenly turns into a hero, in the last second of the movie. No scene showing how he gets rewarded for it. Not a hero, who kills all his competitors or robs all their property, shining after such a victory, no. A civilized hero, who had the courage and made the effort to tell the truth, so that society, civilization can move an inch or two forward.\n\nWas it the message, that preventing somebody from telling the truth always has a counterproductive side to it? I came to this when thinking about the meaning of the handgun flying out of the window of the Moulin Rouge, hitting the Eiffel Tower before dropping into the river Seine. If the duke had killed Christian, Christian wouldn&#8217;t have been able to cause more suffering. Christian also wouldn&#8217;t have been able to tell us the truth. It&#8217;s up to Harold Zidler to make the judgement, to give Christian another chance.\n\nWas it the screenplay? The magnificent composition of acting, of colors, of light, of blackness, of music and dance, of costumes and make-up, of zoom-ins and zoom-outs, of camera movements, of slow motion and fast motion, of taking into focus and out of focus, of poetry and brief dialogs, which hit the point with the force and precision of laser beams, to form one piece with all the parts fitting so exactly to each other, consistent in itself and gorgeous, almost overwhelming, like a classical symphony or a French palace of the 17th century. This screenplay combined with a story, which is hard to come to terms with, flavored with lovely comedy, leaves one after 135 minutes totally satisfied and unfulfilled at the same time. Be this by Baz Luhrmann's intuition or calculation, either way this movie is a very distinguished piece of art.\n\nWas it the touching symbol of Satine being protected by a dark, good angel (Deobia Oparei), who catches her, when she falls during her performance, who punches a rapist off her, and who stabs Christian with such an utterly contemptuous glance when being asked to take Satine back to the Moulin Rouge?\n\nWas it the symbols, whose meaning I didn't get even on the sixth attempt? The pigeons showing up here and there, especially those stoned ones, which are completely unimpressed by the mayhem going on in front of them when the duke chases Harold Zidler performing \"Like a virgin\".\n\nWas it the outstanding performance of the entire crew of actresses and actors, who appear not to act, rather to live this story?\n\nWas it Baz Luhrmann's extraordinary ability to create moods, atmospheres? The orgy-like exuberance of an evening at the Moulin Rouge; the embarrassment and unease, when Christian attempts to break Satine out of the team rehearsing with her \"The lover's secret song\"; the tension, when the debut performance of \"Spectacular Spectacular\" suddenly almost falls apart. This list is incomplete.\n\nWas it the indirect, implicit way of how the story is told, which is so different from the direct, explicit way of other movies? This is what had almost made me walk out on it at first. I had expected a movie trying to recreate 1899 Moulin Rouge \"how it really looked\". Baz Luhrmann didn't do this. He used all the means of modern movie making, including computer imaging technology, to different purposes. No lengthy trading of small talk, complaints, accusations or insults, no explicit sex, no physical violence. The action happens between the minds, between the unexpressed thoughts and unspoken feelings of the characters. Fascinating.\n\nWas it the intensity and wholeheartedness, with which the story is told? In this respect it reminded me of the play \"Faust Part 1\" of the German 18th century playwright Johann W. von Goethe, which I know from my high school days. The similarities between Goethe and Baz Luhrmann might not end here. Goethe's work forms a milestone in German literature. Baz Luhrmann's work might well turn out to be a milestone in movie making - for the entire globe, that is. Still being remembered, studied and performed a hundred or two hundred years from now. Courtesy of digital storage. I certainly believe so. By the way: In weight and depth of the story, Baz Luhrmann&#8217;s \"Moulin Rouge\" outdoes Goethe&#8217;s \"Faust Part 1\".\n\nAll right now. Hope I didn&#8217;t go too far. Still awake? Let's try to figure out whether this is really a Bohemian movie review. Freedom? Well, I took the freedom to write it and to send it out. Truth? I gave it my best shot. Beauty? I'm writing about Satine. Who in the world could be more beautiful than Satine? Love? Where's the love part? All you need is love da da da da dah, Love lifts us up where we belong, Love is a many splendid thing, Love is like oxygen, I was made for lovin' you, baby -Thomas, c&#8217;mon. Stay on the carpet. (\"These silly writers are letting their imagination run away with them.\") &#8211; Thomas, you're a little bit - blushing, aren't you?\n\nJanuary 20 thru 26, 2002\n\nThomas Irmler (author, all rights reserved)"
