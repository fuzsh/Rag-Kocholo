        "text": "Netscape’s What’s Related Service\n\nOne possibly underused facility in the Netscape browser is its What’s Related feature. When viewing a Web page, clicking on the What’s Related button in the Netscape toolbar (shown in Figure 1) will display related information about the page being viewing.\n\nThe information displayed by use of the What’s Related service is illustrated in Figure 2. As can be seen a number of related Web sites will be displayed. In addition information about the Web site will be displayed, including its popularity, the number of pages on the Web site and the number of links to the Web site.\n\nAbout The What’s Related Service\n\nWhat’s Related is a feature of Netscape Communicator that is designed to “help you figure out where to go next when you’re surfing the web or drilling for information”. By clicking on the icon ion the toolbar you can see sites that provides information or offers products and services that are similar or connected to those offered by the site that you’re currently viewing. You can go directly to a related site by selecting one of the links in the drop-down menu, or select the Detailed List to see a web page with a list of related sites.\n\nFigure 1: Netscape’s What’s Related Service\n\nThe What’s Related data is created by Alexa Internet. Alexa uses crawls the Web to create and categorise related Web sites for millions of web URLs. Alexa uses links on the crawled pages to find related sites. The day-to-day use of What’s Related also helps build and refine the data. As the service is used the requested URLs are logged. By looking at high-level trends, Netscape and Alexa can deduce relationships between Web sites. For example, if thousands of users go directly from site A to site B, the two sites are likely to be related.\n\nOnce all the relationships have been established and the links have been checked, the top ten related sites for each URL are chosen by looking at the strength of the relationship between the sites.\n\nEach month, Alexa recrawls the web and rebuilds the data to pull in new sites and to refine the relationships between the existing sites. New sites with strong relationships to a site will automatically appear in the What’s Related list for that site by displacing any sites with weaker relationships.\n\nFigure 2: Netscape’s What’s Related Service\n\nNote that since the relationships between sites are based on strength, What’s Related lists are not necessarily balanced. Site A may appear in the list for Site B, but Site B may not be in the list for Site A. Generally this happens when the number of sites with strong relationships is greater than ten or when sites do not have similar enough content.\n\nAs an example of this difference in content, consider the relationship between several major Internet sites: Netscape is a browser and server software company as well as an Internet portal, so the What’s Related list will contain a mix of these types of companies. When visiting a “pure” Internet portal, you might see Netscape Netcenter in the list; however, when you visit Netcenter, you might not see that “pure” portal in the Netcenter What’s Related list because several other browser and server software companies are included along with the related Internet portals.\n\nFurther information about Netscape’s What’s Related service is available on the Netscape Web site [1]. A What’s Related FAQ is also available [2], from which the above description was taken.\n\nIt should be noted that Netscape’s What’s Related service was an early example of an RDF application. Brief information about the implementation in Mozilla is available at the Mozilla Web site [3].\n\nSurvey\n\nOn 21st and 23rd October 2000 the What’s Related service was used to obtain information for the main server hosted by UK Higher Educational Institutions, based on the HESA list [4].\n\nInformation on the popularity of the Web server, the number of pages on the Web sites and the number of links to the Web site were recorded. Links to the What’s Related service for each institution are provided in the survey data, allowing the current information to be obtained.\n\nFindings\n\nA summary of the popularity data, numbers of pages on Web site and numbers of links to Web server is given below.\n\nPopularity\n\nThe five most popular Web servers, based on the information provided by Netscape’s What’s Related Service, is given in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Most Popular InstitutionsInstitutionPosition In Popularity TableCurrent DetailsOpen University7,221Try itSheffield7,238Try itSouthampton8,259Try itNottingham12,766Try itCambridge16,911Try it\n\nNumbers of Pages Indexed\n\nThe five Web servers with the most pages, based on the information provided by Netscape’s What’s Related Service, is given in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Most Number of PagesInstitutionNumber of PagesCurrent DetailsSheffield26,865Try itAberystwyth14,990Try itLeeds14,675Try itBath14,471Try itSouthampton12,842Try it\n\nNumbers of Links\n\nThe five Web servers with the highest number of links, based on the information provided by Netscape’s What’s Related Service, is given in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Most Number of LinksInstitutionNumber of PagesCurrent DetailsImperial College25,817Try itLeeds19,920Try itReading18,365Try itExeter18,242Try itCardiff18,007Try it\n\nNote that it would be interesting to compare the information on the number of links to the main institutional Web servers with the survey carried out in March 2000 using ALtaVista which was published in Ariadne issue 23 [5].\n\nRelated Pages\n\nAs might be expected the related pages for University Web sites were often other University Web sites (especially other Universities within the region or Universities beginning with the same letter) as can be seen from Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: What’s Related For The University Of Bath\n\nIt was interesting to note that many Universities were seen to be related to the Graduatebase.com Web site [6].\n\nA number of other interesting relationships were observed, some of which are summarised below.\n\nTable 4: Examples of Related SitesInstitutionRelated SiteCheckBradfordRelated to a Greek Web siteTry itOxfordRelated to Yale and HarvardTry itCambridgeRelated to Dalhousie University, Halifax, NovaTry itRoyal Veterinary CollegeRelated to The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh and the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of LiverpoolTry it\n\nIt should be noted that the relationships are provided for the Web site and not for individual Web pages. So, for example, if you are viewing a page on nuclear physics which is hosted on the institutional Web server, the What’s Related information will provide links to Web sites which are related to the institutional Web server, and not to the pages on nuclear physics.\n\nThis provides an argument for hosting departmental and project pages on their own domain rather than on the institutional Web server. As can be seen from Figure 5, which shows the What’s Related links for the DESIRE project [7], more relevant links can be provided in such cases.\n\nFigure 5: What’s Related For The DESIRE Project\n\nThis argument for hosting departmental and project pages on their own domain does not, of course, address the maintenance and support issues.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe success of the Google search engine [8] has demonstrated the effectiveness of citation analysis for finding relevant resources - a resource is given a high rating if there are many Web sites which link to the resource. Although Netscape’s What’s Related Service does not seem to be widely used (possibly due to Netscape’s uncertain future following the AOL / Time Warner takeover deals) it may be useful to monitor developments in services which use citation information.\n\nThe What’s Related Service is interesting since it not only uses the link information provided by Alexa [9] (which in turn uses the Internet Archive service [10]) but, since it is integrated within a Web browser, it can also make use of end user browser patterns (resource A is related to resource B not only becuase there are hyperlinks between A and B, but also because many users follow the link).\n\nThe figures on the popularity of Web sites, the numbers of pages on the Web site and the numbers of links to the Web site are, of course, open to various interpretions. Further work remains to be done.\n\nReferences\n\nAbout What’s Related, Netscape\n\nhttp://home.netscape.com/escapes/related/\n\nWhat’s Related FAQ, Netscape\n\nhttp://home.netscape.com/escapes/related/faq.html\n\nRDF: Related Links and other such fun stuff, Mozilla\n\nhttp://www.mozilla.org/rdf/doc/SmartBrowsing.html\n\nHigher Education Universities and Colleges, HESA\n\nhttp://www.hesa.ac.uk/links/he_inst.htm\n\nA Survey Of Links to UK University Web Sites, Ariadne, issue 23,\n\nhttp://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue23/web-watch/\n\nGraduatebase,\n\nhttp://www.graduatebase.com/\n\nDESIRE,\n\nhttp://www.desire.org/\n\nGoogle,\n\nhttp://www.google.com/\n\nAlexa Internet,\n\nhttp://www.alexa.com/\n\nThe Internet Archive,\n\nhttp://www.archive.org/\n\nAppendix 1: Survey Results\n\nThe Netscape What’s Related service was used to analyse institutional Web servers in UK Universities.
