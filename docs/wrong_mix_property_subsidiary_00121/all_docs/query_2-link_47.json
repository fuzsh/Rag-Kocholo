        "text": "Congrats!\n\nI've been using Firefox since version 1.0, the main reason being the way tabs were implemented. But then I also enjoyed the search-bar, which later became part of the address-bar and the extensibility of the browser with add-ons and themes. The bookmark/history experience is also great nowadays with the side-bars, even if the latter can be improved to make even easier the search of the visited pages.\n\nLater on, the Quantum release dramatically changed the responsiveness of the browser and made it more performant for the new intensive tasks required by the web such as video streaming, real time calls, etc. The phishing and privacy protections of the latest releases made Firefox a must for me.\n\nThe open-source nature of the project is also a plus, last but not least, Firefox uses the only popular-non-chromium based web-engine available: something that should be preserved, continuously improved/upgraded, and ALWAYS kept under the open-source license.\n\nAOL destroyed Netscape. Mozilla rebuilt-it from scratch. Quicker. faster, modern.\n\nSome of us may disagree because of some unpopular choice of the Mozilla Foundation, especially when it comes to privacy and advertising, but at the end of it all, the Mozilla Foundation has always been transparent and all the choices were put upfront so the users could choose.\n\n100 more years for Mozilla and Firefox (but also Thunderbird and Rust and all amazing projects!)\n\nI switched from Chrome to Firefox in Autumn 2019 cause I was fed up with Google's News Feed and how they constantly kept tabs on my activity across multiple platforms (not just the internet browser). Earliest I tried Firefox before that was at a Library in 2012, and when I decided to leave Internet Explorer shortly after I chose Chrome because I trusted Google at the time.\n\nIn retrospect, I feel like I could've chosen Firefox and saved myself a lot of trouble.\n\nFirefox respects the user. It respects the user's privacy, the user's autonomy, the user's intelligence, and the user's freedom. It offers so many excellent features, and the few that it doesn't can be recreated with extensions. The fact it can do this, with it's own independent browser engine no less, while providing a solid and stable \"default\" state for those unwilling or afraid to customize, it all demonstrates what a true gem Firefox is in a world slowly being taken over by Chromium.\n\nIt's not been an easy road getting here, I couldn't imagine life on the internet without Firefox, and I will advocate for Firefox as the most stable, fast, user-friendly, and generally satisfactory browser I could recommend to anyone.\n\nHere's to tomorrow. 🙂\n\nHi Jon, my team and I use firefox for our work. We are in and out of Firefox all day long. This is mostly a trust issue for us given the conflicts of interest at Google, suspicion of Edge, and Oh my Gosh Opera potentially allows spying on webcams. However, it is quite jarring to have firefox update in the middle of the day and then display a message we have to click through. Please keep it light like Google does, where a landing page or graphic or info bar appears where you can click if you are interested, otherwise, we should be able to carry on as normal. However, when we are with a customer or on phone it creates a gap in our flow where we have to think less about our interraction with our very important customer and more about what is this message and why is it sidelining our work. Kindly think about this before giving us non-critical notifications we have to click through before firefox will work. Congratulations on reaching this coding milestone. We were glad you fixed the performance issues way back in the day. We will gladly raise a nice cold glass when you reach 20 years since the first release, but please, think of our flow and let us know gently. Please keep up the good work, stay true and trustworthy.\n\nThanks\n\nDanny\n\nHonestly i don't know why i am still using this browser back then when FF was in version 3.0 and i started using it, it was quick and innovative, now i feel like from some time this browser is staying in one spot. And that you have no direction, all my friends moved to edge or others. Only thing which keeping me here is the attention to privacy. But there were several moments when i wanted to change the browser. Lockwise sucks on android it doesn't properly handle password prompts.. so i need a 3rd party password manager... and other small things started to be exhausting...\n\nYou may have finally made Firefox so completely unusable that droves of users will be forced to leave the platform. I had become accustomed to a plethora of banks prohibiting login with Firefox due to outdated security protocols and simply used other browsers to pay those bills, etc. After updating to v99 (and now v100 - Windows 7 x64) though, things have become catastrophic. I can no longer open the bookmarks in the file menu as they just auto-scroll very rapidly. It works fine in the sidebar. This makes managing bookmarks a problem since I can't even access that option. With v99, I also started having trouble with certain websites. Realtor.com wouldn't allow me to view more than the cover photo and now with v100, the website doesn't work at all (client-side error). Walmart.com stopped working with v99 and continues to not work w/ v100. Similar results with a number of other major websites. Why do I continue to use FF? I really don't know anymore.\n\nI've been using Firefox since about 2011, when I first started using a computer, I tried using other browsers, but I liked Firefox the most and I became attached to it.\n\nWhat I've always appreciated about Firefox is that the browser is built on its own re-created engine from Netscape's code.\n\nI really liked the fox itself which represents the browser, and I definitely enjoyed the different drawings made for Firefox OS, it's just adding some personality to the fox which is really cool and I would love to see more of that in the future.\n\nObviously the browser privacy itself is great, the only downside you can give is that the browser doesn't have a built-in ad-block, but there are a lot of addons to fix this problem, so it's not a big deal.\n\nAll the best to Mozilla and the entire Firefox team who work hard every day to improve the browser ❤️"
