        "text": "Yesterday, a tireless worker and entertainer who's touched most of our lives turned 20 years old, but nobody threw a party.\n\nIt's the graphical user interface to the World Wide Web — better known as the Web browser.\n\nThe lack of celebration is rather odd when you think about it, especially considering how much time we spend looking at the world through our browsers.\n\nJust think what our world would be like today without Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and other web browsers.\n\nSure, we would probably be aware that Angie Miller moved into the Top 4 on \"American Idol\" after singing The Pretenders' \"I'll Stand by You\" and Beyonce's \"Halo\" last Wednesday, dedicating the first song to Boston and those wounded in the marathon bombings, because we either saw her do that or somebody told us about it.\n\nThat's all well and good, but thanks to our browsers (and the coverage from this newspaper, all tidily arranged on the Cape Cod Times' website), we also know that Miller attended Heritage Christian Academy in East Falmouth and that she joins Siobhan Magnus as a contestant with Cape Cod ties.\n\nThe web browser whose birthday we celebrated yesterday is the National Center for Supercomputing Applications' \"Mosaic\" — multifaceted software named for its ability to handle a wide range of file and information delivery protocols.\n\nIts built-in ability to serve up Web pages that included in-line images was one of the core elements that set Mosaic apart from the other two popular browsers available at the time.\n\nBoth had the ability to view images and play video and sound files, but unlike Mosaic, they required the user to click on a link to load a separate page with those elements, which is why some 'Net historians refer to Mosaic as the first WYSIWYG Web browser.\n\nMosaic's graphics capabilities — and the choice by the center to create a version for Windows as well as Unix — also explains how the browser crushed its only real competition online, text-focused distributed information services called Archie, Veronica, Jughead, Gopher, and WAIS. And it made Mosaic the first \"killer application\" to arrive online.\n\nWhile Mosaic is largely considered to have been the first graphical web browser intended to be used by the general public (as opposed to more specialized browsing and searching tools for academia and research), the second major web browser for public use has a more familiar name: Netscape Navigator.\n\nNetscape would eventually end up being purchased by AOL, but its code became the foundation for the Mozilla Project and browser, which has evolved into one of the most popular (and safest) browsers today, Firefox.\n\nA software engineer named Marc Andreessen played a significant role in the creation of Mosaic before he went on to found Netscape with colleague Jim Clark.\n\nAndreessen and Clark went on to transform Netscape into a publicly traded company with established value before selling almost the entire show to AOL for a tasty $4.2 billion. And then, with AOL at the helm, it inexplicably lost the infamous Browser War with Microsoft.\n\nAfter Netscape's ignominious defeat at the hands of Internet Explorer, the folks over at Microsoft never actually had a chance to catch their breath or revel in their victory. As they quickly found out, when you're on top, there's an army of other guys looking to knock you down.\n\nInternet Explorer rapidly found itself in pitched conflict with an assortment of other browsers, and many of those were based on competing code from projects including Mosaic.\n\nSome — InterAp, Internet Works, the Quarterdeck Browster and WinTapestry — are historical footnotes today, vanquished and largely forgotten.\n\nBut the winners that emerged include Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera.\n\nIn the 20 years that have passed, a number of Web standards have come and gone, and the meaning of the label \"Web browser\" has expanded to include technology that nobody even imagined when the original browsers were being created.\n\nToday, this includes devices like Internet-connected phones and smartphones, game consoles, streaming media devices, and even the television set itself.\n\nAlong with Mosaic's debut in 1993, that's also the year that the .org and .gov top-level domains were created. The actual commercialization of the Internet was not scheduled to happen for an additional two years, and the first webmail service (Hotmail) wasn't due to arrive for another year after that.\n\nWould you believe that, when 1993 began, there were only 130 websites available online?\n\nBy the end of that year, due in part to the popularity of Mosaic, that number had grown to 623, according to a study by MIT researcher Matthew Gray, author of MIT's Web Growth Summary Reports.\n\nMost of those 623 web destinations had very little in the way of eye appeal for casual surfers. But there were a few standout examples of cool websites, even back then. David Farley's \"Doctor Fun\" site was one of the first regularly published web comics, and was a site that the NCSA hailed as \"a major breakthrough for the Web.\"\n\nIf you had your fill of chuckles and were in the mood for a good cry, you could surf over to a site called \"Heaven's Gate\" — a spinoff of an online bulletin board of the same name that served as a pet memorial website.\n\nIf you liked movies, you were in luck. The Internet Movie Database already existed online. It was founded in 1989 on a Usenet newsgroup, where it took the form of a really big text file, then launched on the Web, hosted by the Computer Science Department of Cardiff University in Wales.\n\nA quick list of other 1993 destinations includes the Internet Underground Music Archive; MIT's campus newspaper, The Tech; and the website created by VJ Adam Curry at MTV.com. That was pretty much it.\n\nThis is definitely a case to say, \"you're not getting older — you're getting better.\" Happy birthday, Web browser!\n\nC.M.
