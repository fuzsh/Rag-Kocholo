        "text": "Seeking the manuscript of a presidential speech, a Navigator 4.0 user might type \"whitehouse\" into the browser's address bar, relying on the software to complete the address. But that user might be surprised to reach a much saucier site than President Clinton's, replete with a \"First Ladies\" photo spread.\n\nThe unexpected result occurs simply because the latter site owns the www.whitehouse.com domain. When the browser automatically filled in \"http://www.\" and \".com\" around \"whitehouse,\" up comes the sultry spread.\n\nIf the user performs the same action in the new preview version of Navigator 4.5, the official White House domain -- located at www.whitehouse.gov -- is returned.\n\nPretty tricky, huh? Tricky and sure to change everything when it comes to Internet handles.\n\nThe difference in Navigator 4.0 and 4.5's addressing is due to the browser's new Internet Keyword feature. Internet Keyword takes the word or phrase entered in the address bar and drills down through a series of databases to make an educated guess about the site the user may be seeking.\n\n\"The intent of the system is to enhance the user's experience in finding resources they're looking for,\" said Julie Herendeen, Netscape's (NSCP) director of client marketing.\n\nThe Internet Keyword feature is not necessarily unique, but it does get complicated -- even political -- when certain keywords bounce back their results, said Lori Fena, chairwoman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n\"Netscape is not the only company to have done this,\" she said. \"But it's taking over the users' computer preferences without spelling out to them just what's occurred.\"\n\nIt happened to Dave Winer, owner of the scripting.com domain, when he typed in \"scripting\" to pull up his site, which covers computer scripting news for developers. Instead of going to his site, he was shanghaied to a page on one of Netscape's own sites for developers to discuss the scripting topic.\n\nWiner, who acknowledged that he had very personal business interests at heart, immediately contacted Netscape and spoke to marketing representatives about what had happened.\n\n\"The question is, do they have the right to do this, and who will be affected by it? I've done a tremendous amount of work in building up that brand,\" Winer said of his domain. scripting.com domain.\n\nNetscape is quick to point out that the redirect was to be expected on Day One of the first public beta testing of its software. It is the kind of problem the company expects to work out before the final version of the new software is shipped in the fall.\n\n\"It's part of our intent during the beta period to find out what works and what doesn't,\" said Netscape's Ken Hickman, program manager for Netcenter. And in the case of scripting.com, the pointer to the Netscape page was due to the hierarchical order of the database that fields the incoming keywords.\n\nNetscape says that more than 10 databases catch the keywords to see if they are trademarked, registered as Internet domains, have a directory area in the Excite-Netscape Web index at Netcape's Netcenter portal, and so forth.\n\nThis is done in a certain priority. If no single site match for the keyword is made by the trademark database, for example, it passes it on to the domain-name database (holder of all Internic-registered Internet domains) and tries it there. If neither of these find a match, the page returned is likely to be a topical section of the Netcenter directory.\n\nRight now, the company is tweaking the order in which the databases field the words. Winer's discovery prompted the company to change the order.\n\n\"It's really a fluid system here, our data sources are changing rapidly,\" said Hickman. Because scripting is a generic term, it is more appropriate that it return a listing of several sites in a Netcenter directory, he said. Now, after a re-ordering of the database hierarchy, that is just what happens.\n\nThe scripting.com problem is the very reason a competing company decided to leave generic keywords out of its databases altogether.\n\n\"We don't accept that generic terms should be in the namespace,\" said Keith Teare, CEO of Centraal. The company offers its own Internet keyword database system, Real Name, which it is licensing to search engines like AltaVista for use alongside Internet searches.\n\n\"It is bad enough that 'scripting' goes to scripting.com,\" Teare said. \"Scripting is a generic term. It shouldn't be the property of anybody. It should return a series of topics that are appropriate to the term -- one of which is scripting.com.\" This is what is returned by the Real Name system and, after its fix, by the latest version of Navigator.\n\nMicrosoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, also has the automatic fill-in feature that Navigator has had for its last two versions. By typing a question mark in the address bar, IE will return a Yahoo-style directory page, explained Rob Bennett, IE product manager.\n\n\"We looked at and so far have rejected any ideas that map URLs one-to-one to keywords,\" Bennett said. \"I don't think you can do it in a way that benefits users and is fair to content providers.\" Therefore there are no plans, Bennett said, to include the feature in future versions of Internet Explorer.\n\nNet watchers seem to lean toward Microsoft's side on the issue, though some point out that Redmond has done plenty else in the software arena to use defaults in favor of the company's own software.\n\n\"There's this battle where people take over your desktop, set the defaults, and know the direction you go according to what they feel rather than what you would like to control,\" said the EFF's Fena. She expects an increase in these attempts as the marketplace becomes more competitive.\n\nShe compared the Winer incident to slamming, where consumers' long-distance service is changed without their consent. It's not directly analogous, she said, but redirecting a Web address without the user's permission, \"is something that's at the least not user friendly and at the worst could end up creating bad law,\" something Fena said she would hate to see.\n\nWiner, who admits he was thrilled with the keyword feature when he first heard about it, has since come to see the enormity of its implications. He's not sure that even Netscape is aware of it.\n\n\"Really what they're doing is they're going into competition with Internic,\" he said, referring to the domain name system controlled by Network Solutions.\n\nUnwittingly, Netscape may be subordinating the battle over that system to the emerging issue of keyword control. Who cares about controlling the rights to cocacola.com when keywords make typing in just plain \"Coke\" locate the site?\n\nAs the EFF's Fena notes, \"Life is full of a lot of little product feature decisions that dramatically shape what happens to the user's experience.\" This is something companies like Netscape, she said, are obligated to keep in mind."
