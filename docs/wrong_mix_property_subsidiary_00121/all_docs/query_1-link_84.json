        "text": "Netscape Navigator. My very first web browser. I never forget my feeling when I was first talked through it. I did a year IT course at college in '95 but the internet was never even discussed. I didn’t even know what it was. I started my first job in '96 and the guy I was shadowing dialled the PC up to the internet and then said, there you go, you’re on the internet. I just looked at him and said ‘What do I do with that?’. Strange thinking back.\n\nMozilla was the first web browser I ever used. Netscape was the second.\n\nBoth these were available for Unix (Solaris or BSDi/OS) and Windows (NT). IE, being only on Windows, has never been my primary browser. I fall back to that.\n\nArchie and gopher were the first browsing-the-Internet interfaces I used.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, there was a Sun Workstation on my desk at work and a PC at home running Unix. I also had a PC at work to run Word or Excel. I held out against Outlook until 2001 when a job transfer took away the Solaris machine and a PC took its place. Managers were so happy because now they find my calendar and schedule meetings.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2004 that I saw IE on the Mac OS X. By that time, Microsoft and Apple had gone their separate ways for browers."
