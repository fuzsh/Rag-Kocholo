        "text": "[20 Years Ago, Part 15. Other options: prior post or start at the beginning.]\n\nSomehow, against the odds, it all came together. WebFORCE went from funded project to new product line, ready for launch in just 76 days. Twenty years ago today, January 26, 1995, the two hottest companies in Silicon Valley at the time, Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Netscape, came together to launch the first turnkey solution for web authoring and web serving — the very first products with “web” in their name.\n\nMy instincts on timing proved correct. By launching in January, we caught all of our competitors totally off guard. In fact, it would turn out to be many months before Sun Microsystems, Apple, and Microsoft would begin to address the hot growth market of the World Wide Web. That secured a significant first-mover advantage for us, and made SGI the second hottest product brand in all of the web (behind our white hot new partner, Netscape).\n\nAnd we didn’t just win from great timing. We hit the market “guns a blazing” with the unbeatable combination of killer product, a high-profile press event, an historic demo, a big budget ad campaign, and awesome collateral.\n\nKiller Product (Even Microsoft Agreed!)\n\nThe WebMagic team burned the midnight oil and somehow managed to pull off the miracle of creating the first WYSIWYG HTML editor in under eight weeks. And under the technical leadership of David “Ciemo” Ciemiewicz and the product management leadership of Rob Lewis (one of my first hires), the WebFORCE software bundle expanded to include not just WebMagic and the Netscape server software, but many other essential tools for creating “media-rich web content”. Among those were a video tool called MovieMaker (with support for MPEG-1, QuickTime, and Cinepack) and an audio tool called SoundEditor (with support for AIFF, Sun/NeXT, and MS RIFF WAVE).\n\nIn terms of feature set, WebFORCE absolutely set the standard. Even five months later, it was referenced in a Microsoft internal exec team memo from Paul Maritz to Bill Gates, available online now because it was evidence in the U.S. Government’s anti-trust case against the company. In it, Maritz explains the gap between Unix and PCs in the web authoring space — and how it can’t be closed “until a suite similar to SGI’s WebFORCE is available on PC’s”:\n\nHigh-Profile Press Event\n\nSGI’s PR team, one of the best in the industry, pulled out all the stops. This news was clearly big enough that there was no need for pre-briefing. Instead, we would host an invite-only press event on our campus in Mountain View. In addition to the newsworthiness of an SGI product launch, we also had the big draw of the announcement of a partnership with Netscape, with Marc Andreessen agreeing to speak and do interviews.\n\nI think we drew well over a dozen technology and business reporters. Alas, very little of the coverage we got is findable today online. Carl Furry, who was the lead from the PR team for this launch, did find this scanned piece with ComputerWorld’s coverage of the news while we compared our memories in recent days.\n\nHistoric Demo\n\nOf course, no SGI press event would be complete without a 3D demo. Fortunately, weeks earlier, Rikk Carey, a charismatic director of engineering from the Visual Magic Division, had reached out to get me excited about a futuristic project his team had just gotten involved with, something called Virtual Reality Modeling Language (“VRML” for short). Though it was a very early-stage, grass-roots, open standard effort, I immediately saw it as an important missing piece of the WebFORCE puzzle. With the promise of bringing 3D to the web, VRML was a natural technology for SGI, the pioneer and leader in 3D computing, to embrace.\n\nThe WebFORCE launch was the first day that VRML was demoed to the press. I’m not sure what we actually demoed, but it would have been using our Open Inventor toolkit. And even though neither Marc Andreessen nor I now remember it, the ComputerWorld article linked to above says that in addition to our demo, Marc announced that Netscape Navigator 1.1 would “support transmission of three-dimensional graphics”.\n\nHard to believe now, but that demo and the mutual endorsement of SGI and Netscape for VRML would kickoff an industry-wide, multi-year wrestling match for control of 3D on the web. The battle would feature intense competition, awkward alliances, and multiple acquisitions. Along with SGI and Netscape, tech stalwarts Microsoft, Apple, Sun, and Sony would all become swept up in the mania. (Much more on that in future posts!)\n\nBig Budget Ad Campaign\n\nThe team at Poppe Tyson, SGI’s ad agency of record, who had already blown me away by creating a killer logo for WebFORCE, did it again with what may be the very first print ads for any web product. The flagship ad, that ran for many months in publications like Wired, ComputerWorld, and since forgotten places like Interactive Age and Interactive Week, still looks great to me:\n\nTwo elements that I really love about “One Stop Web Shop” are that the primary visual is content framed within a web browser, and that the team really made this an SGI-quality ad, with multiple nods to 3D.\n\nThe secondary launch ad (shown at the top of this post) is in some ways even more remarkable. Using the web to actual sell stuff was unheard of at this point, with Amazon’s launch six months away. So for us to introduce WebFORCE as “the biggest revolution in commerce since the 800 number” was a pretty prescient claim! Readers of the Wall Street Journal got to see a full-page (but black & white) version of the ad within days of the announcement.\n\nOver the first six months of 1995, we invested nearly $1 million to place these ads in the leading technology, business, and creative arts/new media publications. That, together with an amped up “Powered by Silicon Graphics” effort, made SGI appear to have already won the market, even before our first $10 million in sales.\n\nAwesome Collateral\n\nAmongst the earliest of hires to the WebFORCE team was Kris Hagerman, who like so many from the team would go on to found and lead other startups, including BigBook, the web’s first Yellow Pages, and Affinia, a Sequoia-backed e-commerce and digital advertising pioneer. If I were the “CEO” of WebFORCE (in practice, not actual title), Kris was my “COO”.\n\nThe very first thing Kris did after coming on board was take a project that was just a notion in my head, flesh it out, and see it to completion. The challenge was to create a brochure for the product line that looked and felt more like Wired magazine and less like a corporate data sheet. Here are some scans of this really beautiful “tri-fold”:\n\nAnd a Cringe-Worthy (But Highly Effective) Sales Tool\n\nMany of you may have seen those digitized VHS tapes from the early days of the web. Well, here’s one more!\n\nIn early 1995, SGI had a 1,000-person global direct sales force. They were really awesome at selling high-performance workstations, and were becoming more comfortable selling high-performance servers and super-computers. But they did not have any experience selling software or turnkey hardware/software bundles. And, like all salespeople everywhere, they had no experience selling web authoring and serving solutions.\n\nSo, to jump start sales, we created a 10 minute sales training tape, starring me, Rob Lewis and Ciemo, along with Steffen Low, product manager for the WebFORCE servers, and Gene Trent, applied engineering for the server side of the line. In it, we explained why the web was a hot new opportunity perfectly suited to SGI (in other words, why a sales person should focus on it, or in other, other words: $). We showcased key features and key differentiators, and, given the audience, we opened and closed the narrative with references to 3D.\n\nLike any tape from the mid-’90’s, there’s a lot to cringe at here, whether it’s the less-than-professional readings from teleprompter or the cheesy music throughout. That said, this tape was instrumental in selling tens of millions of dollars worth of workstations and servers. It turns out that though this was clearly made with the sales team as the intended audience, many sales offices would actually show this directly to prospects. But with each successive viewing, the sellers got more and more comfortable with how to pitch the WebFORCE line.\n\nWithout further ado, here for the first time on the web is “WebFORCE: To Author and To Serve”:\n\nAnd that is how we launched WebFORCE!\n\nTo be continued…\n\nWhat a week for OpenID and the opening up of the Social Web! Following Monday’s big announcement of Microsoft about to become an OpenID provider, today Google announced that it has actually become one (for real), with several sites are already live, accepting Google account credentials for signup and sign in, including Plaxo and Zoho. Google’s rollout is a very big deal for OpenID. Why?\n\nLike many promising technologies, OpenID has long suffered from the “chicken and egg” problem. Why should any site wrestle with the complexities of becoming a “relying party” (a site that accepts OpenID) if very few mainstream users have an OpenID and know how to use it? And, conversely, if there are very few relying parties out there, why should a mainstream Internet player, such as Google or Microsoft, rush to become a Provider?\n\nThe lineup of current (or soon to launch) OpenID Providers now includes, Google, Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft, and MySpace. And we should be able to demonstrate in the coming weeks that second-generation implementations, like what Google is launching with today (and extending soon with Portable Contacts), actually reduce the friction for onboarding new users. The result should be a massive adoption wave for OpenID all over the web. If your competitor’s OpenID-based onboarding of new users has a much smaller dropoff rate than yours, you will find yourself wanting to come up to speed quickly on how to become a relying party, too.\n\nOne of the coolest things in the official blogpost for the announcement is what is coming down the pike:\n\nGoogle is also working with the open source community on ways to combine the OAuth and OpenID protocol so a website can not only request the user’s identity and e-mail address, but can at the same time request access to information available via OAuth-enabled APIs such as Google Data APIs as well as standard data formats such as Portable Contacts and OpenSocial REST APIs. In the future, this should allow a website to immediately provide a much more streamlined, personalized and socially relevant experience for users when they log in to trusted websites.\n\nThis combined “Open Stack” approach will fix so much of what is currently broken.\n\nToday, every time you go to use a new website, you have to give the site your email address and choose a password; you have to upload a photo and fill out the same profile info you’ve done dozens of times before; and, you’ll probably be encouraged to import your address book and invite your friends. The new Open Stack approach can take almost all of the friction out of that process. OpenID lets you signup with existing credentials. XRDS-simple lets the site discover where you keep your data. OAuth allows you to grant restricted access to just that data (without handing over the full keys to your account). And Portable Contacts standardizes how the site can pull in the people data that you want to share, including data from your profile, your friends list, and your address book. And that can all be done in a couple of clicks, with you in control.\n\nThese are exciting times, indeed. Congrats to the Google team!\n\nAs has become the standard for just about any “open” launch, Plaxo is among the first live, with Joseph Smarr coding away feverishly in the night. Here’s his post on the launch at the official Plaxo blog. Joseph is also quoted in the Google blogpost:\n\nJoseph Smarr, Chief Platform Architect at Plaxo says, “It’s great to see Google become an Open ID provider in addition to supporting OAuth, which we already use. We are thrilled to be among the first sites to allow users to login with their Google Accounts. This is going to be great for users, Plaxo and the web.”\n\nCaption: Joseph Smarr and Pete Cashmore “Partying Like it’s 1999”\n\nI’m back in the office after two action-packed days and evenings in San Francisco for the annual Web 2.0 Expo. It was a huge gathering at an historic point. Are we on the cusp of the open Social Web or the brink of a “nuclear winter” — or both?\n\nI loved this quip in a piece by CNET’s Caroline McCarthy regarding a pre-launch startup, Chi.mp, co-hosting an open bar party with Mashable:\n\n“Amid the drunken revelry and pulsing electronic music, one prominent tech-industry veteran at the party was asked exactly what Chi.mp is. ‘I’ll tell you what Chi.mp is. It’s venture money getting set on fire,’ the jaded observer replied. Surveying the buoyant crowd, he added, ‘This feels a little like 1999.'”\n\nBut over-the-top partying aside, the vibe for me was tectonic. I could feel the strain of enormous tension built up along the traditional intersections of the industry’s continents. Microsoft introduces and demonstrated their bold “Mesh” initiative, which pits their cloud computing against Google’s. Yahoo! announced a sweeping makeover as on open platform, but is fighting for its independence from an unsolicited takeover bid by Microsoft. Will Yahoo! have the time to see its open efforts blossom. And if they become a part of Microsoft, how will such efforts “mesh”?\n\nTim O’Reilly reminded us all that there is something really big going on, and that we should not get distracted by the business headlines. I found his talk inspirational, and I agree with his thesis that the Web, especially the Social Web, is a driver of change in human capability that will have as dramatic an impact as the development of writing or the creation of cities. “Are we done yet?” he asked the crowd, with the fervor of a preacher or Presidential candidate. “No!” came the response.\n\nAnd in what was one of the most well-received talks of the Expo, here Joseph Smarr of Plaxo articulates with great clarity one area in which we clearly are not “done yet,” deploying a new service layer that will remove the friction of the Social Web:\n\nHere’s one of the key slides from Joseph’s talk that shows the Social Web services layer that we believe is about to emerge:\n\nI also had the privilege of having meetings with most of the big companies, and I heard things that would have seemed impossible even a year ago. The commitment to opening up, to open standards, like OpenID, and to interoperability, is really quite amazing. 2008 is going to be an historic year, for sure."
