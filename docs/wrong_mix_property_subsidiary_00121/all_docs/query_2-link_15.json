        "text": "Hello readers. As the title above might indicate, this article is the third part of a trilogy detailing the great Browser Wars, beginning in the early 1990s and having significant implications in present day. Unless you like coming in at the end of things, I’d suggest going back to the first installment of the series and reading from there. If you’re an avid reader, all 3 articles put together should take you about 20–30 minutes. If you find yourself with a bit less time than that but still want a reasonable grasp on the story, then I suggest you at least check out Part II of the series, as it includes a decent recap of Part I, and doesn’t take too much extra time. If you’re really in a rush and can only spare time for this article, then I’ll do my best to provide a summary here:\n\nIn 1993, a company called Mosaic Communications Corporation released a browser known as Mosaic, and in 1994 put out a second browser known as Netscape Navigator, shortly following a re-brand to Netscape Communications Corporation. The then revolutionary “point-and-click” technology offered by Mosaic, and the shockingly interactive capabilities offered by Netscape Navigator, including its groundbreaking implementation of the browser language JavaScript, made quite the splash. The two new browsers captured the hearts and minds of the technology community, and more importantly, those of average consumers. To those who remember, Netscape Navigator can be a recalled as a household name, with “Netscaping” being interchangeable with the term “using the internet”.\n\nNetscape’s time in the limelight was brilliant but brief; then software gargantuan Microsoft felt existentially threatened by the new revolutionary technology, and immediately set the wheels in motion to put this annoyance to rest. Upon rejections from Netscape to license the new technology to their more daunting adversary, Microsoft resolved to smother their rival in the crib rather than face it in the battlefield. In 1995, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 1.0, pilfering many of the same technologies that went into developing Netscape Navigator. Additionally, Microsoft leveraged its contracts with hardware companies to ensure the spread of Microsoft Explorer and prevent the proliferation of Netscape. Microsoft also provided Internet Explorer as “freeware” to bring the conflict into an arena in which smaller Netscape couldn’t compete. By late 1997, this first “Browser War” was considered as good as over on both sides, with Microsoft being the perceived winner. By 1999, Netscape had open-sourced their assets and been purchased by AOL (now owned by Verizon). By 2001, Microsoft’s latest release, Internet Explorer 6.0, sat at about 95% of browser market share.\n\nWhile this dominance by Microsoft was unquestionable, it did have some understandable side effects. Complacency on the part of Microsoft set in, especially in the form of research and development, and frequent, “agile” releases on their newest browsers slowed to synchronize with their much more infrequent desktop software updates. There was only one major software update offered by Microsoft between 2001 and its release of Internet Explorer 7 in 2006. In the same manner that a monarch might capture a throne but then struggle to defend it, it seems that Microsoft may had bitten off more than they could chew in its domination of the browser market. At a time in American and global consumerism that commerce was shifting to a digital marketplace, Microsoft hadn’t taken the proper steps to prime their browser to handle security threats, nor the challenges that a growing demand for bandwidth would present. The stereotypes of the slow, pop-up-ridden, virus-plagued browser experience had its origins in the update-neglected Internet Explorer product offered by Microsoft in the early 2000s. This stereotype created lasting damage to the brand that lives on even today. In this period and since, other competitors have stepped up to fill in the glaring holes left by the tech giant. The open-sourced Netscape ended up re-releasing as Mozilla Firefox browser in 2004, and chipped away at as much as 30% market share at its peak in 2010. Technology company Apple, who between 1997 and 2002 had a contract with Microsoft to have Internet Explorer as the primary browser on their desktop computers (a fact which still causes my head to spin), released its own browser Safari in 2003. From this point on Apple stopped using Internet Explorer on its own Macintosh operating system, and even released a few versions of Safari to run on Microsoft Windows.\n\nAmong this collection of technology companies looking to throw their hat in the ring emerged another contender: one that to this point probably seemed conspicuously absent. To the vast majority of readers of this article, this company is likely the elephant in the room, with its minimal mentioning in this series possibly warranting concern. Let me put these concerns to rest. This company, of course, is Google, and their horse in this race is the Chrome browser. There’s a decent chance you’re reading this article on the Chrome browser right now. In fact, according to StatCounter statistics provided as recently as May 2019, that chance is 62.7%, as that was Chrome’s market share at the time. More specifically, for mobile devices, they’ve captured 59.4% of global browser share, whereas for desktop they’ve captured a whopping 69.1%.\n\nAs you can imagine, this Google victory did have a drain on Microsoft, though more than you might realize. While at the end of the last article things weren’t looking up for Microsoft, they still sat at over 65% market share at the beginning of 2009, just after Chrome was officially released. Today, with both of their major browsers put together, they sit at just shy of 9.5% for desktop, and just over 4.5% of market share across all platforms. It might seem logical to ask at this point: “What happened?” For a while, executives at Microsoft were likely asking themselves the same thing. As the precursor to this article might suggest, there’s no one reason that Microsoft fell from grace. In contrast to the first installment of this series, the second article consists of many moving parts, demonstrating there were many companies during that time each looking to expand their influence, and no single event that set off the decline of Microsoft. With that being said, there are general patterns that can be recognized, and that held fairly consistent during the transition away from Microsoft’s hegemony in the browser game. One of the strongest was Microsoft’s complacency with the product they had already released to consumers, and their slowness to react to the messages that the market was sending them.\n\nAs was addressed in the previous article, Microsoft failed to make any considerable updates between their release of Internet Explorer 6.0 in 2001 and Internet Explorer 7 in 2006 (with only a minor update in 2003). While the release of Internet Explorer 7 in 2006 was noted by the tech community, and it did address a few commonly known issues, such as security problems and the browser’s rendering engine, it was seen by many as too little, too late. Meant to be the end of a controversy for Microsoft, the browser ended up compounding the negative views many already held of the tech company, with uncaught security issues being pointed out with the browser as late as 2008. While IE 7 performed better than previous Microsoft browsers, it failed to turn the tides of the momentum shift against the company in recent years, which represented lower and lower market share as time passed.\n\nIn focusing back on Google and their Chrome browser, it can be said that Microsoft’s failure provided them a golden opportunity to buck the browser pecking order that had manifested over the better part of the last decade. Something to note is that browser domination wasn’t always one of Google’s goals. In truth, Google didn’t even envision themselves as being a considerable player in the browser game at first. Before the idea of Chrome was conceived, Google seemed more than happy to watch the Browser Wars unfold from the sidelines. Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google during this time, had made public statements in the early 2000s that he had no interest in getting involved in the nasty Browser Wars affair, and understandably so. The treachery surrounding Microsoft in the 1990s had certainly come across as bloodthirsty to other tech companies, and the drama from this affair had bled into the tech psyche of the 2000s. Google was among the list of many small tech companies that didn’t want to be added to the bodycount left by a behemoth like Microsoft.\n\nThis all changed in 2004. This is the year when Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, along with hired Mozilla developers, presented a prototype of a Google browser to Eric Schmidt that was “so good it caused him to change his mind”. This inspiration came on the heels of the launch of Mozilla Firefox 1.0, which sought to resolve many of the security concerns that were left gaping and unaddressed by Microsoft. The actual release of Google’s browser was a long time in the making: while rumors started to spread about a Google browser in 2004, the actual announcement for the browser didn’t come until September 2008. The name “Chrome” was selected to denote the speed of the browser performance (which did not disappoint), but was also meant to tackle the concept of “feature creep”. Both Internet Explorer, and to an extent, Firefox, had been known for their abundance of add-ons to their browser experience, which had a tendency to weigh down user activity and sometimes slow down browser speeds. As an alternative, Google released its Chrome browser with a pared-down, minimalist aesthetic that was meant to give the user the experience of “running lean”. This re-vamped browser look ended up being tremendously popular, and is more-or-less still the look of the Chrome browser today.\n\nSo, with the backing of a tech company with a popular search engine to its name, 4 years of anticipation, a vetted performance portfolio, and a sleek new look, Google Chrome must have come out of the gate of its late 2008 release looking strong, right? Wrong. While the fact that its release was limited to Windows XP likely didn’t help, Chrome had an underwhelming debut. The new browser hit the market with a 1% usage share in September 2008, and then dipped to just shy of 0.7% in the coming months, before rebounding to its original 1% on its stable release that December. Still, Chrome couldn’t be kept a secret from the world forever. While its growth wasn’t on the level of Internet Explorer’s near-instantaneous ubiquity in the mid 1990s, Chrome’s expansion in the following years was still very impressive considering the amount of competition the late 2000s offered.\n\nBy the end of 2009 Chrome had almost 5.4% market share, and had quietly and calmly overtaken both Apple’s Safari and Opera. Opera browser, originally released by Norwegian tech company Opera Software AS in 1995, had generally received a positive critical reception to this point, and boasted a loyal, albeit small group of dedicated users. That being said, Opera never managed to break (nor meet) the 5% market share analytic for desktop nor across platforms. While Opera continues to live on today with roughly the 2.5% market share it had back in 2009, it failed to have any stronger interactions with Google or Microsoft, nor in the broader Browser Wars. Apple’s Safari had a somewhat more involved story. With the iPhone currently having an over 54% mobile device and iOS having over 28% operating system market share in the U.S., Apple can certainly be considered a household name in tech today. Just as Microsoft used their Windows operating system as a springboard for their Internet Explorer in its earlier years, Apple did and still does use its Macintosh hardware and software to promote its Safari browser. The iPhone, a revolutionary piece of hardware that revamped the way communication, entertainment and mobile consumerism were viewed, was released by Apple in 2007. This piece of technology came natively with the Safari browser, and did a lot to promote the Apple brand, which lives on strongly today. While the iPhone did give Apple an ostensible perch for being at the forefront of the mobile internet revolution, however, this was an incredibly slow build from the perspective of browser usage. By January 2011 (more than 3 years after the iPhone’s release), only 4.3% of the world’s browser usage was mobile. One year later this number had near doubled to 8.5%, but desktop browser usage still made up the other 91.5%. The point in all this is that in the years after the release of the iPhone and the spark of the “smartphone” revolution, Apple’s Safari would still have to make its case on the desktop browser to achieve widespread influence. After the release of the Safari browser in 2003, Apple did develop a few versions to run on non-Apple operating systems, including Windows, and in terms of pure quality, these versions actually performed relatively well. With that being said, their quantity lacked; Safari never achieved any kind of significant usage outside of the Apple software environment, mobile nor otherwise. Upon looking at the data it is also readily apparent that Safari’s legacy is primarily a North American one. In terms of global desktop usage, as of May 2019, Safari sits at about 7.25% market share, and across all platforms (mobile included), it hovers somewhere between 15%-16%. In North America it does a bit better on desktop (9.4%), and considerably better across all platforms (28.5%), however it has been bested in both of these areas considerably by Chrome for years. Safari does still beat Chrome by a hair on mobile browsers in North America (Safari has 46.4% compared to Chrome’s 45.1%), however these numbers have been inversely proportional for years, and it wouldn’t be unexpected for Chrome to overtake this number at any time. In short, while Apple continues to have a vibrant legacy in the tech world, the Safari browser has yielded in its Browser Wars battle against Chrome, especially on the broader world stage, both during Chrome’s rise and today.\n\nApple’s Safari had been subdued on Chrome’s ascent, however the browser still had formidable foes ahead. 2010 was an exciting year for the browser, with reports that its market share had more than doubled to 14.2%, but 2011 carried with it another Browser Wars milestone. Though Internet Explorer had been declining steadily for years, it still lay well ahead of the nearest competition, who to this point had been Mozilla Firefox. Between its inception in 2004 and 2011, Firefox had been on a good streak. It had risen to a very solid number 2 browser behind Internet Explorer and enjoyed that position for about 5 years, even reaching a peak of about 30% market share in 2010. On a particularly happy patch for Mozilla organization, during the last month of 2009 and first month of 2010, Firefox 3.5 was actually listed as the most popular browser when counting solo browser versions, laying just ahead of both Internet Explorer 7 and 8. Of course, when combining all Internet Explorer browser versions, the Microsoft giant landed far ahead of any competition, but this blip could still be seen as a victory for Firefox considering the antagonistic history the two organizations had shared. Mozilla had also been inspired by the rapid release schedule of Google’s Chrome, and in June 2011 released Firefox 5.0, the first rapid release, followed by 4 more releases that year, including Firefox 9.0 that December.\n\nDespite all of this progress, however, Firefox’s clash with Chrome wasn’t avoided. In November 2011 Chrome eclipsed Firefox, and at the end of the year Chrome reported 25.1% market share compared with Firefox’s 23.3%. As the first two articles in this trilogy detail, the feud between Microsoft and Mozilla had been long and contentious (especially when Mozilla was represented by Netscape), but Mozilla could no longer afford see the browser dispute through a purely binary lens. More than just wanting to see Microsoft crumble, Mozilla had to consider the survival of its products and the usage of its Firefox browser. Unfortunately, it became another piece of fodder fed to the Chrome machine, and to this point it has still not rebounded. While Mozilla continued to fight fiercely on behalf of their browser, they were never effectively able to recoup the user base lost to Chrome. In addition, neither Firefox nor the broader Mozilla organization were ever able to establish themselves in the mobile browser market, which has become increasingly important in recent years. As of May 2019, Firefox sits at just above 5% market share across all platforms. Chrome, on the other hand, was still on the up-and-up, peering into 2012 in second place on the world stage, and with less than a 10% gap to close with Internet Explorer.\n\nBefore I move on to the final chapter of the long and eventful tale, I wanted to first acknowledge the significance of another battlefield on which these Browser Wars are being fought: the mobile device. As this concept inevitably weaves in and out of the larger story, it already has some mentions, but I wanted to give it a dedicated section in the story so it wouldn’t be glossed over. While mobile devices have been around for decades, and many have had internet capabilities, this section will only really concern itself with the last 10 years (2009 — present), as that makes up the primary purview of this article, and before 2009, mobile browser usage share sat at less than 1% anyway. In terms of why mobile browsers are important, one interesting fact can demonstrate this: in November 2016 mobile browser usage reached equality with desktop usage. The numbers for each came in at about 48.5%, with tablets picking up the rest. Since then both have had their ups and downs, and both still sit at about the same 48.5% value. While the future is hard to predict, these trends suggest that the desktop browser isn’t going anywhere immediately, but also that mobile browser usage seems to have a permanent part in the conversation."
