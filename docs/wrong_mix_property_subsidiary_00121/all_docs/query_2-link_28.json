This groundbreaking device and the production-engineered version Magnavox Odyssey game system (1972) spawned the commercialization of interactive console video games, which became a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\nDIALOG Online Search System, 1966\n\nMountain View, CA, Dedicated 23 May 2019 - IEEE Santa Clara Valley Section\n\nDIALOG was the first interactive, online search system addressing large databases while allowing iterative refinement of results. DIALOG was developed at Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory in 1966, extended through contracts with NASA, and offered commercially in 1972. Its speed, ease of use, and wide range of data content attracted professional users worldwide including scientists, attorneys, educators and librarians. DIALOG preceded major Internet search tools by more than two decades.\n\nFirst Radio Astronomical Observations Using Very Long Baseline Interferometry, 1967\n\nKaleden, British Columbia, Canada, Dedicated 25 September 2010 - IEEE Vancouver Section\n\nOn the morning of 17 April 1967, radio astronomers used this radiotelescope at DRAO and a second one at the Algonquin Radio Observatory located 3074 km away to make the first successful radio astronomical observations using Very Long Baseline Interferometry. Today, VLBI networks span the globe, extend into space and continue to make significant contributions to both radio astronomy and geodesy.\n\nCERN Experimental Instrumentation, 1968\n\nGeneva, Switzerland, Dedicated 26 September 2005 - IEEE France Section\n\nAt CERN laboratories the invention of multiple-wire proportional chambers and drift chambers revolutionized the domain of electronic particle detectors, leading to new research on the constitution of matter. The development of unique electrical and electronic devices made possible the major high-energy physics experiments which have been recognized worldwide.\n\nLiquid Crystal Display, 1968\n\nPrinceton, NJ, U.S.A., Dedicated 30 September 2006 - IEEE Princeton/Central Jersey Section\n\nBetween 1964 and 1968, at the RCA David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, New Jersey, a team of engineers and scientists led by George H. Heilmeier with Louis A. Zanoni and Lucian A. Barton, devised a method for electronic control of light reflected from liquid crystals and demonstrated the first liquid crystal display. Their work launched a global industry that now produces millions of LCDs annually for watches, calculators, flat-panel displays in televisions, computers and instruments.\n\nPublic Demonstration of Online Systems and Personal Computing, 1968\n\nMenlo Park, CA, Dedicated 19 March 2017 - IEEE Santa Clara Valley Section\n\nCommonly termed the \"Mother of All Demos,\" Douglas Engelbart and his team demonstrated their oNLine System (NLS) at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on 9 December 1968. Connected via microwave link to the host computer and other remote users at SRI in Menlo Park, the demonstration showcased many fundamental technologies that would become ubiquitous, including collaborative online editing, hypertext, video conferencing, word processing, spell checking, revision control, and the mouse.\n\nElectronic Quartz Wristwatch, 1969\n\nTokyo, Japan, Dedicated 25 November 2004 - IEEE Tokyo Section\n\nAfter ten years of research and development at Suwa Seikosha, a manufacturing company of Seiko Group, a team of engineers headed by Tsuneya Nakamura produced the first quartz wristwatch to be sold to the public. The Seiko Quartz-Astron 35SQ was introduced in Tokyo on December 25, 1969. Crucial elements included a quartz crystal oscillator, a hybrid integrated circuit, and a miniature stepping motor to turn the hands. It was accurate to within five seconds per month.\n\nBirthplace of the Internet, 1969\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles, California, U.S.A., Dedicated 29 October 2009 - IEEE Coastal Los Angeles Section\n\nAt 10:30 p.m., 29 October 1969, the first ARPANET message was sent from this UCLA site to the Stanford Research Institute. Based on packet switching and dynamic resource allocation, the sharing of information digitally from this first node of ARPANET launched the Internet revolution.\n\nInception of the ARPANET, 1969\n\nMenlo Park, California, U.S.A., Dedicated 16 September 2009 - IEEE Santa Clara Valley Section\n\nSRI was one of the first two nodes, with the University of California at Los Angeles, on the ARPANET, the first digital global network based on packet switching and demand access. The first documented ARPANET connection was from UCLA to SRI on 29 October 1969 at 10:30 p.m. The ARPANET’s technology and deployment laid the foundation for the development of the Internet.\n\nInvention of Public-key Cryptography, 1969 - 1975\n\nCheltenham, England, Dedicated 5 October 2010 - IEEE United Kingdom and Ireland Section\n\nAt Great Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), by 1975 James Ellis had proved that a symmetric secret-key system is unnecessary and Clifford Cocks with Malcolm Williamson showed how such 'public-key cryptography' could be achieved. Until then it was believed that secure communication was impossible without exchange of a secret key, with key distribution a major impediment. With these discoveries the essential principles were known but were kept secret until 1997.\n\nApollo 11 Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (LURE), 1969\n\nLick Observatory, San Jose, CA, Dedicated 1 August 2019 - IEEE Santa Clara Valley Section\n\nOn 1 August 1969, Lick Observatory made the first Earth-to-Moon distance measurement with centimeter accuracy. The researchers fired a gigawatt ruby laser at a retro-reflector array placed on the Moon by Apollo 11 astronauts, and measured the time delay in detecting the reflected pulse. This was the first experiment using a hand-placed extraterrestrial instrument.\n\nParkes Radiotelescope, 1969\n\nParkes, Australia,"
