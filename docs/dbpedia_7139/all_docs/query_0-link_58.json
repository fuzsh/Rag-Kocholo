        "text": "From Finland I got my very first grindcore review on my hands and it’s a rather juicy one at that. Last Days of Capitalism is Tolerance first full-length album but the band have been going for a long time so this isn’t really a new kid on the block. So what does Tolerance give us with their full-length debut?\n\nA big mix of crushing tracks that will blow your brains out, relentless non-stop action that’s what! One thing that makes this stand out from the little grindcore I listen to is there is a groove element to this release, which to me makes this more memorable and easier to access. Add the sci-fi elements, a drum machine going bonkers and you got a recipe for a good grindcore album. Noisecore, grindcore, goregrind, cybercrust, synth and groove (hell you name the bizarre genre and it’s in here!) mashed into a pot of craziness that I think you either dig the hell out of or will go what the fuck is this shit? Which is just the way grindcore should be in my opinion, a hate or love relationship. If you’re even a remote fan of grindcore this will be your jam right here. Me as some sort of a newbie who only dabble in it from time to time can get some joy out of this release but I’m sure pure fans of the genre would of given this a higher score even.\n\nAs far as the genre goes Last Days of Capitalism does work out and I’ve found myself giving this quite a few listen as something draws me back at time. Might be the utter chaos that’s going on that speaks to me, I don’t know. All I know is I want more of Tolerance with their mutant apocalyptic world that spews absolute filth.\n\nArtist: Tolerance\n\nLabel: Bringer of Gore\n\nRelease date: October 3rd, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Obscured Horror\n\nFor fans of: Last Days of Humanity & Cock and Ball Torture\n\nScore: 3/5 Good\n\nTolerance\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/whatsyourtolerance\n\nhttps://whatsyourtolerance.bandcamp.com/\n\nBringer of Gore\n\nhttps://bogrecords.webs.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Bringer-Of-Gore-records-107665070675145/\n\nWith a name like Repuked the first thing that comes to my mind “is this grindcore”? What is mostly at play here is filthy death metal though in the veins of legendary Autopsy. This is the first time I hear the band but they’ve been going since 2007, so veterans of the scene for sure. With two full-length albums, one EP, two splits and two demo releases together with very few line-up changes during the years I expect Dawn of Reintoxication being Repuked at the top of their game. It would turn out I was almost right.\n\nRepuked has a very varied offering here where they change the tempo seamlessly and utilize their strengths well. Honestly really surprised by Dawn of Reintoxication, I came into this album thinking it would at the very best be an decent effort but here I am spinning this album on a daily basis for a week and loving it. “Kick Fuck” has those grindcore elements a la Birdflesh I thought the album would be full of which just fits perfectly into the Autopsy style they got going in general. Having a bit of slower paces death doom scenarios could of been a very misplaced decision but instead that is a great change of pace that gives the listener room to breathe. With songs like “Repulsive Erected and Anally Infected”, “Vodka Til the Grave”, “Shitfister” and “Fucking Your Fucking Corpse” you know from the song-titles along you’re in for a fucked up party. The title track “Dawn of Reconfiguration” even gives you an instrumental sci-fi horror type of tune which instantly made me think of The Thing or Colour Out of Space. Big surprise and I would not think this was from Sweden if I didn’t read it in the promo several times myself haha.\n\nThe only thing here is that the red line might be missing a bit, as the album can be a bit all over the place and maybe too varied actually for some listeners. A hard thing to master really as the most memorable albums that last for years are varied but still have the thin led line it dances on that makes you want to get back to it time and time again. Repuked aren’t quite there but they did blow me away with Dawn of Reintoxication either way with this more than solid nasty death metal offering, one of the better albums I’ve heard these past months (was debating on a 4 for a long time) and it can definitely sneak into my top 50 list by the end of the year.\n\nArtist: Repuked\n\nLabel: Soulseller Records\n\nRelease date: October 9th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: Repulsive Erected and Anally Infected\n\nFor fans of: Autopsy & Cryptic Brood\n\nScore: 3.5/5 Very good\n\nRepuked\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Repuked\n\nhttps://repuked.bandcamp.com/\n\nSoulseller Records\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SOULSELLERRECORDS/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/soulsellerrecords/\n\nhttp://www.soulsellerrecords.com/\n\nhttps://soulsellerrecords.bandcamp.com/\n\nFor those unfamiliar the band Grimentitiy is a new challenger that’s arrived from Belarus and with the short EP titled To Perfection (also called Promo 2020) have released their first physical album. The band is a trio which features a known name in Pavel Lapkouski on guitars and vocals, you might now him as the bass player in Relics of Humanity or from his past band Stickoxydal. Stickoxydal actually plays a similar style as Grimentitiy (where Pavel did guitars and vocals too) so it’s safe to say that’s something Pavel has built on when founding the band along with Roman Drobishevski (drums) and Nikita Metelskiy (vocals, bass).\n\nInstantly the album begins with some intense instrumental works, soon followed by Pavel’s and Nikita’s vocals which are a great combo. Mixing the brutal death metal and grindcore feeling just perfectly where you can’t help but to think about Dying Fetus. “The Power of Broken” then comes on and what a track! While I thought the opener was a nice introduction where I got to know Grimentitiy they just blow me away with the next one, literally skipping a few bases going straight to the finish line. Ending To Perfection they did a Lock Up cover on the song “Dead Sea Scroll Deception”. Truth be told I think this is better than the original version, it has more power to it and I simply just love the vocals of Grimentitiy.\n\nThere isn’t really anything to complain about on To Perfection, only that it’s too short! Less than nine minutes long it still managed to get my blood pumping and I can’t wait to here more from Grimentitiy. They do grindcore just the way I want to to be, with a touch of brutal death in the mix. It’s well executed, done by a trio that knows their shit, well mixed and pays homage to some of the best death/grindcore music you’ve heard. Done by fans of the genre and I’m sure will be loved by fans of the genre!\n\nArtist: Grimentitiy\n\nLabel: Independent\n\nRelease date: February 10th, 2020\n\nFavorite track: The Power of Broken\n\nFor fans of: Dying Fetus and Lock Up\n\nScore: 4/5 Excellent\n\nGrimentity\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/grimentityband/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/grimentity/\n\nhttps://grimentity.bandcamp.com/\n\nWhen writing this April is soon coming to an end but life has been in the way to get this out, I will try to be better for the April edition! March was yet another great month with a varied mix of metal offerings. The death metal releases really stood out for me this month and there was a lot of wicked music to be heard once again with Sutrah, Vredehammer, Earth Rot, Temple of Void and Afterbirth leading the charge in March.\n\nAlbum of the month:\n\nTemple of Void is one of the best, if not the best, death/doom metal bands going. The World That Was is yet another amazing album by the Americans who can rumble with even the best Finnish bands in the same genre.\n\nTemple of Void – The World That Was was released March 27th via Shadow Kingdom Records.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nOne of Norway’s best bands these past years have been Vredehammer in my book. Back in 2016 they blew me away with Violater and now they follow it up perfectly with Viperous. Don’t miss out on this one!\n\nVredehammer – Viperous was released March 6th via Indie Recordings.\n\nAfterbirth is one of those brutal death metal bands which you can basically from the very first note tell it’s them. They got their own thing going and they do it with style. While I personally liked their debut from 2017 The Time Traveler’s Dilemma more this is some of the most innovating music you will hear in the genre this year.\n\nAfterbirth – Four Dimensional Flesh was released March 13th via Unique Leader Records.\n\nWhat started of with me almost giving this album a miss after its first spin eventually turned into one of my favorite albums this month. What a grower! It just keeps on giving and I like it more with each spin. Big surprise to me and Sutrah has become one of my latest bands to follow closely. You can read my review of Aletheia here.\n\nSutrah – Aletheia was released March 13th via The Artisan Era.\n\nEarth Rot’s death and black metal mix has been something that’s been a homerun in my book since the debut album Follow the Black Smoke from 2014. With their latest offering Black Tides of Obscurity the band showcase themselves at their best and the band seems to only go from strength to strength.\n\nEarth Rot – Black Tides of Obscurity was released March 6th via Season of Mist.\n\nMore great albums of March:\n\nViolet Cold – Noir Kid\n\nDeadspace – A Portrait of Sacrificial Scars\n\nDisembowel – Echoes of Terror\n\nMy Dying Bride – The Ghost of Orion\n\nMedium – Medium\n\nSvengahli – Nightmares of Our Own Design\n\nRotting Kingdom – A Deeper Shade of Sorrow\n\nPutrid – Antichrist Above\n\nAronious – Perspicacity\n\nKlysma – Mental\n\nWardaemonic – Acts of Repentance\n\nGraceless – Where Vultures Know Your Name\n\nAngerot – The Divine Apostate\n\nTribe of Pazuzu – King of All Demons\n\nHeaven Shall Burn – Of Truth and Sacrifice\n\nWombbath – Choirs of the Fallen\n\nÆra – The Source of Ruin\n\nUnholy Desecration – Unholy Horde\n\nDeranged – Deeds of Ruthless Violence\n\nRaider – Guardian of the Fire\n\nErgodic – Ergodic\n\nNox Formulae – Drakon – Darshan – Satan\n\nAodon – 11069\n\nTethra – Empire Of The Void\n\nTorn in Half – Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\n\nHangatyr – Kalt\n\nChronicle – Demonology\n\nMolested Divinity – Unearthing the Void\n\nVulcano – Eye in Hell\n\nBrain Stem – Symptoms of Annihilation – Stage 2\n\nHemotoxin – Restructure the Molded Mind\n\nNexorum – Death Unchained\n\nHyperconvolutor – Hyper Convolution\n\nHere and Beyond – Eternal Recurrence\n\nHyborian – Volume II\n\nBorgne – Y\n\nAeternam – Al Qassam\n\nSvartkonst – Black Waves\n\nThe Metal Gamer songs of the month Spotify playlist\n\nIt’s funny what a band with members scattered all around the metal sub-genres can do when coming together. You got members currently active in Blurring (goregrind), Abdicate (brutal death metal), The Crimson Edge (melodic black/death metal) while having a past from bands such as Goemagot (slam), Infernal Thorn (black/thrash) and Kalibas (black/death/grindcore). That’s a lot of experience, within a wide range of genres and it’s definitely heard in the new band Waldhexen.\n\nIt’s rather low-fi production brings the thoughts back to old school black metal and it works in Waldhexen’s favor and their black/death sound. It’s a flurry of riffs and where the drumming stands out to me with it’s fast, aggressive playstyle that sets the tone nicely. The vocals are also something that stands out as the different styles used aren’t something I usually hear in a, mainly, black death metal album. You can hear a variation of vocal sounds often heard within the scenes of punk, black, death and slam/brutal, all in one short three songs EP. Quite awesome really and at first I thought it might be a bit all over the place, lacking focus and maybe not knowing exactly where they want to go with this album. But those thought quickly diminished as when I write this haven’t been able to let the album go and am well into my 6th playthrough.\n\nThis might not be a record for everyone, but it is create thinking coming to life which is not something you hear too often and for that I applaud Waldhexen. Personally I had an sweet time with Ego Canus Lunam Cano and can’t wait to hear what the band comes up with next time around. Because this is simply a taste of what’s to come I’m sure.\n\nWritten by J.B.\n\nArtist: Waldhexen\n\nLabel: Independent\n\nFor fans of: The Crimson Edge & Cursus Bellum\n\nRelease date: January 12th, 2020\n\nFavorite song: The Oblation of One for Many\n\nScore: 3.5/5 Very good\n\nAnother big month has ended with some surprises and wicked full-length debut albums from bands such as Creeping Death, Creeping Flesh and Arctos. As we are closing in on the final months of the year the album of the year list is getting more and more ready, question is if these last three months can make any big changes or not with bands like Ragnarok, Insomnium, The Great Old Ones, In Mourning and 1349 still got something to say about that. Don’t forget to check out all the bands and labels, give them a like and check out The Metal Gamer Spotify list (give it a follow to if you fancy it) for a full recap on the best songs from each album mentioned here.\n\nAlbum of the month:\n\nI have a rule to only review albums I receive a promo of and I’ve stuck by it for at least a year now. Sometimes though there drops an album that’s so mighty, a perfect 5/5 even after weeks of going through it, that even if you got the chance to review it you wouldn’t know what to write because it’s too damn good and you’re lost for words. The latest Mgła album Age of Excuse is one of those albums for me. A real album of the year contender you shouldn’t miss.\n\nMgła – Age of Excuse was released September 2nd via No Solace.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nI’ve always had a soft sport for Ereb Altor and still though. While some say they might lose their touch a bit I think Järtecken is just as good as their past work, which means it’s superb!\n\nEreb Altor – Järtecken was released September 23rd via Hammerheart Records.\n\nOne of the most underrated bands in my opinion has done it again! Into the Vast Uncharted is almost a completely different beast than their last album and a small change in direction but they pull it off with ease adding a new wicked album to their great discography. You can read the review here.\n\nNetherbird – Into the Vast Uncharted was released September 27th via Eisenwald.\n\nWhile the debut back in 2014 was one of the best I’d heard in quite some time I didn’t know what to expect from the follow-up album. Would it be in a slump or not? Fact is they blow it out of the park and the five years in the making has only made it even more rotten and deadly. You can read the review here.\n\nSempiternal Dusk – Cenotaph of Defectuous Creation was released September 27th via Dark Descent Records.\n\nThe Norwegian powerhouse of death metal has never released a bad album. They took a step back with Fit to Kill, going back to their roots, and it was a good decision leading to one of their strongest albums yet. You can read the review here.\n\nBlood Red Throne – Fit to Kill was released September 13th via Mighty Music.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nThe Ritual Aura – Velothi\n\nEngulf – Transcend\n\nIATT – Nomenclature\n\nHorrific Demise – Excruciating Extermination\n\nOmophagia – 646965\n\nCognizance – Malignant Dominion\n\nInfant Annihilator – The Battle of Yaldabaoth\n\nVisceral Disgorge – Slithering Evisceration\n\nEndseeker – The Harvest\n\nMurder Made God – Endless Return\n\nVitrol – To Bathe From the Throat of Cowardice\n\nCreeping Death – Wretched Illusions\n\nCreeping Flesh – Into the Meat Grinder\n\nCoffins – Beyond the Circular Demise\n\nChase the Dead – Desolate Absolution\n\nArctos – Beyond the Grasp of Mortal Hands\n\nAnd Hell Followed With – Chimercial Reality\n\nBlut Aus Nord – Hallucinogen\n\nUrn – Iron Will of Power\n\nAs I Lay Dying – Shaped by Fire\n\nAsagraum – Dawn of Infinite Fire\n\nTakafumi Matsubara – Strange, Beautiful and Fast\n\nBorknagar – True North\n\nOpeth – In Cauda Venenum\n\nWreck-Defy – Remnants of Pain\n\nVorna – Sateet Palata Saavat\n\nTales of the Tomb – Volume Two: Mendacium\n\nIn Thousand Lakes – Evolution\n\nMizmor – Cairn\n\nMortem – Ravnsvart\n\nExhorder – Mourn the Southern Skies\n\nGarden of Eyes – Arcane Haze\n\nDowncross – What Light Covers Not\n\nBones – Diseased\n\nAbythic – Conjuring the Obscure\n\nCult of Luna – A Dawn to Fear\n\nFetid Zombie – Death Covenant\n\nCrypt Sermon – The Ruins of Fading Light\n\nHorror God – Cursed Seeds\n\nNekrosity – Void Gazer\n\nNordkväde – Visdom & Makt\n\nAnifernyen – Augur\n\nThe Metal Gamer songs of the month playlist\n\nFrom Finland we got this death metal act which formed in 2008 named Refusal. After a bunch of demo recordings with compilations to match they released their debut album in 2016 We Rot Within. The album was a solid one, the foundation was set for the band to stand on for further releases. Now with their follow-up album Epitome of Void in my hand it’s time to see if this will make them take another step in the right direction or not.\n\nThe first word that comes to my mind when I hear what Refusal offers is “consistency”. Sometimes consistency can be a bad thing, when an albums runtime is long it might mean it can become boring and the replay value of a “one-trick pony” in this case I mean the word in all its positive meaning. A big part of that is that the runtime of 32 minutes is just about hitting the sweet spot, while their take on death metal with hints of grind on the rotten cherry on the top hasn’t changed and it is a formula they are very happy driving forward with. I for one think this is a good move because as it gives them an edge for people who are tired of the same kind of old school death sound. I mean after a while your favorite pasta might get a bit boring you know? That’s where these guys comes in for me, they spice the pasta up a bit and hey now it’s almost like a brand new dish for me to devour.\n\nThe almost feral guitar riffs takes me back to the Entombed days on the opening track “Suffocate” (sometimes the album got a death n roll flair to it too, see “Disregard”), while on “Hectic” they showcase a bit more of that grindcore edge a la Napalm Death. If I had to pick the bands that’s closest to Refusal’s death metal it’s bands like Mörbid Vomit, Sadistik Forest (who dropped one of my favorite albums in 2018), Revolting, Galvanizer and even Skulmagot that comes closest to mind. This is the sound you’re going to hear during Epitome of Void, so if you don’t get hooked on it from the first few tracks then I don’t know what to do. As I mentioned before though this is their forte, consistency with their style that’s maybe not unique but it’s not done 100 times by new bands each year so it still feels fresh. That’s also the reason why I had a hard time picking my favorite song. Doesn’t matter if I pick “Suffocate, “Disregard”, “Slaves” or any other track because they are all great and got their own riff here or drum part going for them that I like. Production wise I think Epitome of Void does exactly what it’s intended to, it feels raw, got a lot of energy and the instruments and vocals are well mixed.\n\nEpitome of Void has been an album I’ve gone back to quite a few times since it’s release in January, that in itself is proof that the album has a lot to offer. It’s one of the best death metal albums released in 2019 so far and a perfect example how you can do the old school sound justice while mixing it up a notch.\n\nWritten by J.B.\n\nLabel: Great Dane Records\n\nFor fans of: Mörbid Vomit and Galvanizer\n\nRelease date: January 11th, 2019\n\nFavorite song: Disregard\n\nScore: 4/5 Incredible\n\nClose to Christmas I got one last album to review. What better genre to review before going on a break than the one I love the most, death metal! Of Hatred Spawn were formed in 2017 by the two brothers Remy and JJ Tartaglia who later on added ex-Annihilator bass-player Oscar Rangel and Matt Collacott on vocals. Hailing from Toronto, Canada they are said to play old-school death metal in the vein of Decapitated, Suffocation and Dying Fetus. So far so good right?\n\nThe first thing that catches my eye is the cover art, a great looking fantasy painting that captures the lyrical themes of slavery, darkness and the balance of evil well. What awaits in the musical section is modern extreme metal meets the ways of old. The razer edge guitar plays fused with groove and blast beats along with the superb vocals from Collacott is nothing short but great music to my ears. As soon as the opener Global Dehumanization hits me with it’s fast paced aggression I am hooked but the 28 minute span the album offers is over too quick, I want more. I do hear a lot of grindcore death a la Dying Fetus, Aborted and Benighted influences when I listen to Of Hatred Spawn, mainly due to the way Collacott sings, which is like a blend between Frank Mullen of Suffocation, Sven “Svencho” de Caluwé of Aborted and Julien Truchan of Benighted. There is also a lot of technical death metal aspects as the drumming and riffs leans more towards newer Suffocation, Misery Index or even Hour of Penance at times than for example Obituary or Entombed.\n\nThere is really nothing negative to say about this album, it was solid throughout albeit a bit short for a full-length. Sure it isn’t anything groundbreaking that re-invents the wheel but the skill involved in this group is more than enough to win me over. Death metal fans should definitely check this out as here is something for everyone.\n\nLabel: Boonsdale Records\n\nFor fans of: Suffocation and Aborted\n\nRelease date: December 21st, 2018\n\nFavorite song: Nocturnal Swarm\n\nScore: 3.5/5 Very good\n\nAlright first of all I need to start with saying sorry for my absence, I was meant to review this album and one more last week but I simply didn’t have much spare time so I am a bit behind on things here now. I will do my best to catch up and give you the content you metal gamers deserve! I do have a real treat for you guys though. Infuriate consist of veterans within the Texas grindcore and brutal death metal scene who joined forces to create some old school brutal death metal in the veins of Deeds of Flesh, Disavowed and Severe Torture. One of the bands the members have, or are, a part of is Whore of Bethlehem. I actually got the 2017 release Extinguish the Light in a The Metalhead Box last year and it was a good album so that in itself made me a bit interested what this debut had in store for me.\n\nWhile I know this was advertised as Deeds of Flesh, Disavowed and Severe Torture kind of music I would personally say Monstrosity mixed in with Deeds of Flesh is closer to the truth. It’s a bludgeoning riff-fest that leaves no head without the banging. It’s hard to not get caught in the flurry of riffs, relentless drumming or Jason Garza’s great vocal performance. The best part about the album though is that Infuriate does a great work changing the pace and what flow they want on the different tracks, making the almost 30 minutes a joy and easy to get back to. Be it the bas that is prominent in some tracks with a sweet groove solo or the hard hitting drums Infuriate got a knack for creating music that leaves the listener wanting more. In all honesty I hoped there was more too, 30 minutes is fine for this type of music as it does leave your brain in a mush but hell this is awesome stuff so this once I could want another song or two. One thing that sometimes can be a bit disappointing in this genre when listening to an album fully and not just a track here and there is it can feel monotone, Infuriate does not fall into that trap and that’s exactly what makes them stand out for me. They have that red thin line to follow throughout but also goes outside it from time to time to add a breakdown here, some slam there and extra heavy bas to top it off. Be it classic American crushing death metal “Mori Terrae”, the slamming “Surrogate” or groovy “Engastration” Infuriate does a superb job and has released one of the most memorable brutal death metal albums of the year.\n\nLabel: Everlasting Spew Records\n\nFor fans of: Monstrosity and Deeds of Flesh\n\nRelease date: August 31st, 2018\n\nFavorite song: Mori Terrae\n\nScore: 4/5\n\nWhen I saw Inhuman Remnants got the vocalist from Somnium Nox (fantastic atmospheric black metal) on bass I got interested straight away. Besides that horror themed death metal is always something I can get behind and when it’s well executed it makes me get goosebumps. While Inhuman Remains EP is a short one that offers basically a nine and a half minute long track (I count it like that since it’s an intro, a song then and outro on the three tracks) it’s atmospheric and does give some chills down my spine at times. I can imagine a full-length album on this sort of music will do really well and once the EP (I am tempted to call it a single to be honest) is over I do want more of the same formula. One does wonder how many times the quote “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds” can be used in metal though. Oh well it fits and isn’t just put in there for the sake of it so why not right?\n\nThe slow starts and mid-paced heavy music gives me some Black Tongue or Falsifier vibes and Inhuman Remnants usually keeps on the mid-paced range but have some spikes here and there where they go off to eventually get into a wicked breakdown almost newer Ingested slam style. It fits the theme they got going on and along with the sick vocals that’s around the deathcore area Solipsis became a short but sweet experience. Bring me a full-length album!\n\nLabel: Eschatonic Records\n\nFor fans of: Ingested and Falsifier\n\nRelease date: June 1st, 2018\n\nFavorite song: II. Solipsis\n\nScore: 3.5/5"
