        "text": "1.\n\nViolation 00:38\n\nGo ahead; serve the violation Take a part, of the exploitation It feels so good, to profit from death It feels so good, their skin and flesh Blood flow, cash flow Welcome to a rotten show - Experience the brutality Violate, vile hate Your actions are hard to contemplate - Breeding the mortality Violate, the innocent Money earned, lives are spent\n\n2.\n\nScoop 02:21\n\nA new beginning, a fresh clean path Yet slightly curved and striving to come back The one you thought you were is gone A loss of faith, all bridges burned A strong commitment to return and find the place where it all began to... burn! A failure, a disgrace You'll get yourself erased An old replacement will not do Only fresh young meat will satisfy you The purist in you tells you to stay clean Your conscience now removed with haste The stench of death reveals the taste So precisely portrayed within frames - then replaced... ...the stench of death reveals the taste... ...an empty shell is all that remains... ...slow death...\n\n3.\n\nI decline your words of wisdom Stop spitting your views in my face A cancer eating freedom All values lost without a trace Close, so close but yet so far away - You breed on hate and prejudice Entangled in your web of lies - Malevolent scum! So close, so close but stay out of my way! - Your breed of hate I will dismiss Disgusted my anger will rise I object to your senseless oppression Shocked by the deeds you do You're enslaved to a mental regression In fear that they're equal with you Close, so close but yet so far away - You breed on hate and prejudice Entangled in your web of lies - Malevolent scum! So close, so close but stay out of my way! - Your breed of hate I will dismiss Disgusted my anger will rise You're red and white - you think you're strong You're only white - right is wrong Wake up and smell the cancer You reek of shit! Always there with no good answer Now here's my spit\n\n4.\n\nStormshield 02:23\n\nStanding so close to the edge pumping more until they burst The only thing not being done is getting these bridges burned Still sowing seeds of hate growing nicely in the weak While preparing for the terror that is yet to be unleashed With your gums oiled and greased and your biggest smile in place Your role is that one of a priest to convert them all with haste Still sowing seeds of hate growing nicely in the weak While preparing for the terror that is yet to be unleashed Another lie to calm things down Storming - the winds of hate Hating - all that you create\n\n5.\n\nTime To Discharge 01:20\n\nThe naked truth, slapped in your face Pick up the remains, clean this fucking place The brutal truth, sticks like glue Depravity remains, dividing me from you Challenge the passion Climb the mountain of faith The stale stink of ignorance A perverted passivity not to care Shedding skin, a hollow inside Barred to stand, preparing for the ride Brand new skin, batteries recharged Ready to take a stand, time to discharge Challenge the passion Climb the mountain of faith The stale stink of ignorance A perverted passivity not to care Along the way, you left your old self there to die Just a wreck, scraps of what you used to be Along the way, you found the strength to take a stand Brand new skin, now get ready to discharge\n\n6.\n\nBullshit 00:45\n\nYou claim you're being civilized A barbarian tribe forcing it's views upon a world you hardly recognize Securing your wealth with brutal force You call it \"defence\" When will you wake up and realize There will come a time when enough is enough The ones you shit on, on your way up Will surely shit on you on your way down Defence? Bullshit! Defence? Bullshit!\n\n7.\n\nRelics 02:34\n\nTake aim at your promised land Where would you be without it? Destroy your legacy so grand No \"peace\" will halt your vengeance ...and so again... What makes you settle so convinced? A relic that leaves no room for peace? So fragile it has always been Outside main focus Your focus should be suffering Or have their cries made you go numb? Can't you see the enemy within? Blind with hate you desecrate what brought you here ...but then again... It makes you settle so convinced A relic that leaves no room for peace So fragile it has always been Outside your focus Extinction - your final goal Now you're the relic ...and so again... You stand here settled, so convinced Blindfolded, hatefilled, without regrets The centre of attention Doomed, you stand and fight the flames... ...lit by your own hand You can't float upon the river of flame\n\n8.\n\nWe Curse You All 01:03\n\nHere's one for all the scum The objects of our furious rage The ones that we can live without Those who drive us fucking insane The Nazi scum - we curse you all! The sexist pigs - we curse you all! The upper class - we curse you all! Neo-liberal fucks - we curse you all! Those were really obvious You all hate them, at least you should Ironically there's plenty left There are scum in a closer range Bullshitting 'friends' - we curse you all! Cheating motherfuckers - we curse you all! Greedy rip-offs - we curse you all! The hardcore elite - we curse you all!\n\n9.\n\nDoombringer 02:00\n\nNo need for apologies we all played fair No reason to forgive nor to forget 4 years of highlife and then you die Beaten by the clock yet you try to stay alive Doom - the end is closing in Just before it all begins The end is closing in Destined to lead yet you're always last Strictly narrow-minded don't give a shit about the past Yet the future is dimmed in a cloud of gasoline In blood red darkening you try to float upstream Doom - the end is closing in Just before it all begins The end is closing in Doombringer Doombringer Disappointed by the truth Misery shines through you Endless pain is all you give Wade through emptiness for eternity\n\n10.\n\nJust Another Hog 02:18\n\nFrom the highest tower You pull the puppet's strings While you command your slaves Someone is watching you You're enslaved, you're their slave They dominate your fate When all is said, you're a living dead They dominate your fate All that massive power You're just another hog Sucking up to the master While feeding from the trough You're enslaved, you're their slave They dominate your fate When all is said, you're a living dead They dominate your fate Your stink suffocates me! Your stink suffocates me! Suffocates me! They dominate your fate! They dominate your fate! They dominate your fate! They dominate your fate!\n\n11.\n\nDrop Dead 00:45\n\nA putrid stench of ignorance spreads around you Walking in the wrong direction it seems you have no clue Your stupid remarks pollute the air I breathe You're a walking talking parasite on decency you feed Your neo-Nazi \"intelligence\" Seems to me like very poor defence What do I have to do to get through to you? Why don't you just drop dead!\n\n12.\n\nI Hate People 01:36\n\nWhen you try too hard to find meaning in what you see You forget the origin of the landscape so carefully laid out at your feet Is it hard for you to understand? Does it bother you that I don't fucking care? I'm not here for you to read me like an open book, so don't fucking ask I'm just thinking, thinking loud bringing words to tongue and moving fast All this shit you take for granted leads to nothing, makes no sense Instead of waiting for being told maybe you should tell yourself? You're a slow learner, you'll never last In a world so cold you're supposed to make it fast! Disappointed - yes, but this is hardly news You're disadvantaged from the start There's no denying it and you are through... I hate people telling me what to do - fuck you!\n\n13.\n\nGo! 01:26\n\nTired of all negativity You're bored and uninspired The time is here, the time is now So very tired of all this rotten shit Grasp the vision in your dreams Turn the page, free your mind Of the shit that have held you back too long On you go, to find yourself No looking back Walk on by against the grain Feel proud and well inspired You have the will, you have the power Set the focus and stand up straight Take the first step of your quest Step by step into the unknown Commence the quest of your own future now Never give in, never give up You have to stand strong If there's a will, there is a way Just fucking carry on Turn the page, free your mind Of the shit that have held you back too long On you go, to find yourself No looking back\n\n14.\n\nThe Final Sleep 01:41\n\nExercise of futility To the point of no return Until we breathe the darkness And welcome the final sleep A journey through forgotten realms Unspoken words now sung so clear The force of being right With all your doubts now gone Exercise of futility To the point of no return Until we breed the darkness And welcome the final sleep\n\n15.\n\nSlaves To The Grind 01:11\n\nPulling the weight On our shoulders Finding the strength The lost will-power Turning the wheel Panting for new air Accepting the deal Staying strong for the slaves Slaves to the grind! Pushing forward inch by inch A slow and painful process Harder and harder, even faster A great and wonderful progress We're pulling the weight We're turning the wheel - We're slaves to the grind We're finding the strength We're accepting the deal - We're slaves to the grind\n\n16.\n\nBreach Of Integrity 02:13\n\nDo this Be that Say this Scream that I'd rather watch from the shadows And be my own Don't give me your contempt I already gave you mine I won't be needing your dogma I am Me I am Me, it's working fine I see through you Your morals have the flaws I don't need your scenester laws Judge me - I'll judge you too I see through you Your morals have the flaws I don't need your scenester laws Judge me - I'll piss on you! What a hypocrite! The only 'alternative' you'll ever be Go ahead and be a clone Just a thorn in our collective side Just a duplicate! I don't care what you call 'true' I'll do it my way, and you should too! I'd rather watch from the shadows And be my own\n\n17.\n\nThe Everlasting Shame 01:25\n\nIt's so sad, so sad to see This farce we call equality The gap between the sexes is still so fucking vast The failure of generations who tried to beat the last In the society of Men There's not much a woman can do It's so sad, so sad to see Another destroyed sexuality Beaten, even raped, laying naked on the floor It's her fault, she's was drunk and dressed up, she's a whore! The everlasting shame Stuck like an ugly tattoo History repeats itself This has gone too far How much can we take? Let's make it to the history books\n\n18.\n\nYour Words Alone 00:51\n\nHow thoughtful, how nice A world of shit, what a nice surprise! It really makes us wonder How the fuck you've come this far A heart of stone And no brains to cover for your loss Your words alone Leave us wondering how the fuck you have... ...survived?! You're as dead as dead can be Without any conscience you harvest souls The innocent, the guilty and the free... A heart of stone And no brains to cover for your loss Your words alone Are blinding us with your stupidity A cold shower is what you really are A wake up call and none of us will ever sleep no more Shock treatment of the masses\n\n19.\n\nPreview Of Hell 01:49\n\nThe worlds collide and crash outside I feel the cold winds passing by I'm armed and ready, so ready for more This is my last note from the war We never knew We never knew what was waiting I'm riding next to the very black death Getting high on his stinking breath I'm armed and ready for more of this war I guess that's what I am here for We never knew We never knew what was waiting Some they scream and cry out when they fall Some say nothing at all You wouldn't never believe where I've been Or the sights that I have seen There was blood, red and black, everywhere There was blood, there was blood, everywhere There was blood, red and black, everywhere There was blood, everywhere, there was blood\n\n20.\n\nIllogic 01:27\n\nA new wave of slander, hid as logic Washed upon our shores Reason be ignored It seems shame relives and breathes again I defy you - the old beast awakened again Despise you - the old beast awakened again Cultural diversity Was always a good thing to me Don't give me that excuse You fascist fucking fool I'll call to arms Unto the enemy within A farce turned into darkness I won't be your goddamn tool I thought we were done with this Your right-winged folly upon us again Let face be face, skin be skin It's you who's the enemy within! I defy you - the old beast awakened again Despise you - the old beast awakened again I defy you Despise you Deride you I won't have it again\n\n21.\n\nWhip 01:34\n\nThe concept of 'labour' is a new thing for man How did it all begin? How did we die so fast? 8 hours a day Hasn't always been like this We used to be free We could roam the lands as we wished How did it all begin? How did we die so fast? An upper-class invention To put us all in chains Enslavement, obliteration And now we're dead Industrialized society A gaping sore in history One whip to rule them all In the name of 'progress'\n\n22.\n\nWorst Case Scenario 01:59"
