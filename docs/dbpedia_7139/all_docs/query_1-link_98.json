        "text": "After last week’s 25 Honorable Mentions (in haiku!), Spinal Tapdance will now begin counting down the Top 30 Metal Albums of 2010 in three cheeky installments.\n\n30. Immolation, Majesty & Decay\n\nA pitch-perfect production job (after two great albums somewhat marred by odd, muddy sound) casts the perfect spotlight on some of the sturdiest, most sideways riffs these New York death dealers have spewed forth in their entire career. Further proof, perhaps, that the greatest heavy metal often comes from the sincerity and hardworking ethos of blue collar, down-to-earth dudes getting together and howling (or grunting, as appropriate) at the moon. This is truly the sound of giants among us, and if you haven’t hopped on the Immolation train at this point, I’m not sure there’s much else we can say to each other. Immolation’s craft is patient and deliberate, but will crush you beneath slabs of sparkling granite just the same.\n\n29. Shining, Blackjazz\n\nBlackjazz was by far one of the gnarliest records of 2010, coming across like nothing less than an invasion by a hostile race of noise-mongering aliens. 2010 may have been a great year for saxophone in metal (Yakuza, Ihsahn, In Lingua Mortua – the latter two acts featuring guest turns by Shining’s own Jørgen Munkeby), but nowhere did that instrument come across as foreign and antisocial as on this album. It’s not often that extreme metal finds areas of tonality and experimentalism previously unexplored, but Blackjazz may just be that year zero of a brand-new sound. Open your mind to the cacophony, and bow down to your new woodwind overlords.\n\n28. Woe, Quietly, Undramatically\n\nIt took me a good while to come around to this album, but when it finally clicked – holy shit. Melodically inventive, excellently structured black metal that frees itself from the generic strictures of its Scandinavian heritage, without needing to wander off into all sorts of widdly faux-avant-garde-isms. Tack on to these superbly classy songs the satisfying tormented screams of frontman Chris Grigg, and you’ve got yourself a recipe for real excellence and innovation in American black metal. “A Treatise On Control” is without question one of best songs to claw its way into the world of metal this year.\n\n27. Melechesh, The Epigenesis\n\nI keep reading and hearing about how people are all sorts of disappointed with The Epigenesis, in response to which I can only assume that said grumblers have somehow misplaced their ears up their asses. The masters of Eastern-influence thrashing black madness have queued up another disc full of caustic, biting riffage and esoteric tales of magick and doom. The way that Melechesh grafts some of the traditionalism of black/thrash onto the less common rhythmic patterns of Turkish music is brilliant, and I am absolutely unashamed to report that I have found myself simultaneously belly-dancing and headbanging to this album. If I hear you complain that it’s too slow, I will slap you in your ridiculous face with a sack of cantaloupes, and then turn up the record and play it over and over until you are forced to agree that the album is not about pure, unadulterated aggression, but about finding that perfect hypnotic groove, that devilish trancing sweet-spot. You think, once they get you there, they’ll just let go? Fuck off.\n\n26. Fukpig, Belief is the Death of Intelligence\n\nIf I were trying to be a pithy little asshole about it, I’d just call this Fukpig record Extreme Noise Nathrakh, and call it a day. Thing is, that description’s not wrong, but if you’ve missed out on this severely pissed-off album of short, sharp blasts of nihilistic fury, then maybe I deserve to be a pithy little asshole at you. Whatever – these filthy Britons take the grinding black melodicism of Anaal Nathrakh (with whom members are shared) and marry it to crusty, bulldozing grind in the tradition of Extreme Noise Terror, Napalm Death, old Bolt Thrower, and anything else you like. Song titles like “Britain’s Got Fucking AIDS,” “Sadism in the Name of God,” and the classic “All of You are Cunts and I Hope You Die” should steer you in the right direction, which is, to whichever bastard record store would dare carry this.\n\n25. Ihsahn, After\n\nBoth of Ihsahn’s previous solo outings were excellent in their own terms, though each came off a bit hesitant. And with good reason: sloughing off the tremendous mantle of “ex-Emperor” was assuredly no small task (perhaps complicated by Emperor’s reforming to do the festival circuit). From the first melancholy note of “From Barren Lands,” though, After is all self-confidence, all the time, striking a riveting balance between the unshakable traces of black metal (understandable, as the dude’s got one of the most distinctive voices in extreme metal) and clear progressive intentions. The guest spots by metal-saxophonist supreme Jørgen Munkeby are probably the easiest aspect to focus on, but the entire album flows smoothly from one triumphant riff to another. As such, this is the first of Ihsahn’s solo albums to seem ballasted only by itself, freed of that imperial weight.\n\n24. Darkthrone, Circle the Wagons\n\nModern-day Darkthrone records are a treasure and a gift to heavy metal at large, and the frequency and tossed-off nature of these recordings should not for one minute lead us to take Mssrs Culto and Fenriz for granted. Metal gods of single-minded regression, they are, and with Circle The Wagons they’ve delivered up another collection of furiously catchy black/punk gems, this time borrowing even more heavily (or paying more reverent homage to, depending on one’s perspective) from traditional heavy metal. “Those Treasures Will Never Befall You” and the title track are unparalleled sing-a-long nuggets, while “I Am The Graves of the 80s” will surely serve as a rallying cry to all denim-and-leather diehards who refuse to admit anything has happened since 1987. And fucking good on ’em.\n\n23. Sabbath Assembly, Restored To One\n\nThe most brilliant thing about this Sabbath Assembly record is that one needn’t even know a thing about the bizarre cult-ish back story to get seriously creeped out and enthralled by the occult rock on display. Jex Thoth’s vocals are mellow and just a little rough in all the right spots, with the band eventually sounding like we’ve taken some contemporary orthodox black metal fans and set them down in 1967 San Francisco to play praise songs. This is one of those “This shouldn’t work but hot jumping shit does it ever!” kind of albums, and one that sounds like total rubbish when described, but is pure dark rock magic when heard. “Hymn of Consecration” gives me goosebumps every single time.\n\n22. Black Breath, Heavy Breathing\n\n2010 was a great year for all manner of that volatile cocktail of death metal, grindcore, crust, d-beat, and all other types of general nastiness. Witness phenomenal albums from Early Graves, The Secret, Nails, and the like – still, none of them cut this particular listener quite as sharply as the debut full-length from Black Breath. By far the most Stockholm sounding of the lot, the songwriting nevertheless remains a dangerously careening blend of teeth-gnashing d-beat and grind fury, yet with a sense of melody seen in all the best of black and death metal’s first waves. Sort of like if Disfear and Entombed circa Clandestine had a kid, and fed that kid nothing but Murder City Devils and Doomriders. I don’t know, fuck you – it doesn’t sound like any of that; instead, it sounds like it wants to hunt you down and drink your blood. So let it, yeah?\n\n21. Krieg, The Isolationist\n\nIn which one of U.S. black metal’s long-running concerns returned after a lackluster (and supposedly final) album – Blue Miasma – only to dive headlong into even deeper waters of nihilistic howling and claustrophobic, psychedelic black metal droning. This is a seriously impressive album, with perhaps no factor more welcome than Imperial’s devastatingly intense, gut-destroying vocals. Leviathan’s Wrest sits in to provide some gloriously thick bass, and Woe’s Chris Grigg provides the drumming, so it’s really a family affair. The Isolationist is both straight-forward and unconventional, with just enough flourishes of oppressive noise and ambient flirtations to keep the listener disoriented and humbled before the almighty hammer of an American band at the absolute top of its game.\n\n———————————–\n\nThat’s it for the bottom third of Spinal Tapdance’s Top 30 of the year. Be sure to stay tuned for the rest of the best, and be well, friends.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nResistant Culture, Welcome To Reality (2005) & All One Struggle (2008)\n\nThe ever-charming folks on the Texas Board of Education have recently reared their curmudgeonly heads once more, introducing a resolution which would, according to the New York Times, send a blunt message to textbook publishers: “Do not present a pro-Islamic, anti-Christian version of history if you want to sell books in one of the nation’s largest markets” (New York Times, 9/22/10).\n\nWhat any of this may have to do with tribal crust death/grinders Resistant Culture may be a little oblique, sure, but the point is this: historical revisionism is alive and well in our fair land. The same sort of revisionism, say, that gives us a first Thanksgiving in which the pilgrims just came ‘round to offer the indigenous peoples of the New World a nice cup of tea, or through which our collective relief at the peaceable collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War allows for the gradual erasure of the myriad tyrannies and imperial ventures underwritten in the name of freedom.\n\nRighteous indignation at the brutal treatment and oppression of indigenous peoples throughout the Western Hemisphere is, in fact, the spark which lights the raging fire of Resistant Culture’s seriously pissed-off grind attack. While much bandied-about in discussions of Resistant Culture, the influence of indigenous folk music instrumentation and chants is relatively subdued. The band’s two full-length albums are being reissued and repressed in advance of their upcoming American tour, providing a choice opportunity for having one’s head amply knocked around by the sort of politically-inclined metal that seems, sadly, to be in shorter supply these days.\n\n2005’s Welcome To Reality and 2008’s All One Struggle both provide ample evidence of the band’s tight grasp on the classic everything-in-the-pot style of the early development of grindcore and death metal, when neither had exactly coalesced into ruthlessly ghettoized genres stuffed full of stock ideas and tired riffs. Resistant Culture straddles perfectly these lines between grind and death in the same fashion as genre progenitors Napalm Death, Terrorizer, Bolt Thrower, and all the other usual suspects. In Resistant Culture’s case, rather than tilt wildly from grind to death in separate songs, the overall approach seems to show songwriting chops and an instrumental attack that is rooted in classic grindcore, but with a guitar tone and riff construction that leans more toward the fetid tonalities of death metal.\n\nVocalist and long-time band mastermind Anthony Rezhawk (he, also, of vocal duty on Terrorizer’s long-delayed sophomore album, Darker Days Ahead – hence the participation of the late Jesse Pintado on 2005’s Welcome To Reality) demonstrates a much more varied vocal approach than many other acts in this style. Rezhawk’s most frequent style is a low-pitched yet strikingly understandable grind/punk bellow, yet he also occasionally pushes into higher-pitched rasping, and every now and again breaks out a deep, almost gothic style of clean incantation.\n\n——————————————–\n\nOf the two albums up for review here, it’s 2005’s Welcome To Reality that really grits its teeth and gets right down to the serious business of wrecking your ears. The guitar tone is thick, but its attack is clean and clinical, whether trading in three-chord punk blasts, nimble grind explosions, or stolid, occasionally tremolo-ed death metal stomping. The bass tone oozes through in a delectably thick outpouring, like molten lava forcing its way through cracked tectonic plates. See “It’s Not Too Late,” especially, or the opening passage of “The Gathering” for some real floor-rattling bass thunder. The drums roll and clatter along with the requisite punk fury, slipping into blastbeat passages here, or verging on the classic Discharge d-beat there.\n\n“Forced Conformity” locks into a wonderfully gritty, grooving pace with some sweet guitar noodling. If only more followers of Sepultura circa Chaos A.D. or Roots would have taken the their Brazilian lessons in this direction rather than resorting to the widespread pilfering of the knuckle-draggingly unattractive components of the tribal thrashers’ sound, maybe we wouldn’t now look to Sepultura’s mid-90s experimentation as pivotal in having incited the life-sapping abominations of nu-metal.\n\nIt’s not until the track “Elder Wisdom” that the much-touted indigenous folk music influence is on display in a way other than brief sections of native chanting. The acoustic guitar and flute interlude is a nice breather between the no-nonsense brain-stomping of the rest of the album. The rest of the album keeps things classy and well-apportioned, in equal measure causing the listener to pump her fist furiously to punk shout-alongs (“Victims of a bloody system!!” is just insanely fun to bellow alongside Rezhawk) and headbang recklessly to thrashing death metal riff-splosions. Hell, on “Civilized Aggression,” Rezhawk even sounds vaguely like Abbath gone crust, while on “The Gathering,” we get that deep, gothic delivery in the vocals to match the Eastern-scaled doom/death march.\n\nIn grindcore’s great tradition, the album makes effective use of sampled dialogue and other found sounds, without ever quite lapsing into overreliance. The sound here is much thicker than most crust metal, although the ethics and aesthetics underwriting the music have a much clearer kinship to crust and punk than to the varied lineages of death metal. After thrashing through a grin-inducing cover of Discharge’s “Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing” and one of the album’s highlights in “The Gathering,” it’s finally on album closer “Land Keeper” that the indigenous folk is blended organically with the heavy metal, where on most of the rest of the album, the folk influences were generally sequestered into interludes.\n\nSeventeen tracks in thirty-four minutes is just about perfect for this sort of classic grinding attack, and leaves the listener winded and shell-shocked\n\nOverall rating, Welcome To Reality: 80%. Not reinventing the wheel, but careful saying that ‘round them, as you may find said wheel quickly and unceremoniously shoved down your throat.\n\n————————————————–\n\nThe follow-up to Welcome To Reality came three years later, with 2008’s All One Struggle. In comparison to the incendiary 2005 album, this one comes off slightly the worse, but for somewhat paradoxical reasons. See, All One Struggle actually features a fair portion more of straight-ahead blasting than did Welcome To Reality – album opener “Beneath the Concrete” does nothing to announce its presence before barreling into being, which ought to mark it out as ferocious and unexpected. Instead, it seems predictable.\n\nThe biggest problem, really, is that the album takes far too much time to gain any real, sustained momentum. An interesting riff pops up here and there, and the drums frequently lock into a furious blasting groove, but there is little use of the tension and contrast between the songs that made Welcome To Reality’s similarly straight-forward metal approach add up to a greater whole.\n\nStill, by the time “Mending the Hoop” and “Natural Law” swing around, it’s time for some clenched-jaw mayhem. “Generations” is another brutal grinder, but it’s actually not until the pairing of “Stagnation” and “Rise Above Despair” that the tenor of the album finally switches the unrelenting pace I’ve been craving all along. And for those of you keeping score at home, that pairing doesn’t pop up until tracks 13 and 14 out of 17; too long to keep the expectant grind freak in ‘standby’ mode.\n\nNone of this is to suggest, however, that the album is some sort of unmitigated disaster (the “St. Anger Singularity,” we might say). “Contamination” whips up my appreciative ire with sections of tremolo-picked harmonies that flirt with the darkness and flair of black metal, capped with an ambient outro that leads quite nicely into the folk-tinged “New Sun.”\n\nThe overall sound of Resistant Culture remains essentially unchanged here from the previous album. If you imagine combining the thick, ritualistic tom abuse of Neurosis with the early thrashing fits of death/grind in the 1989 mold: Terrorizer’s World Downfall, Bolt Thrower’s Realm Of Chaos, and even whatever you’d care to call the midpoint between Napalm Death’s From Enslavement to Obliteration and Harmony Corruption (which, out in ’88 and ’90, respectively, give us an average of 1989, natch). I still feel a bit iffy about using the term “tribal” to describe the band’s drumming and use of indigenous folk musics, but the band itself embraces such language in its own press materials, so I shan’t protest.\n\nWhere Welcome To Reality was masterfully sequenced and paced, this album takes far too long to get into gear for my taste; when it finally does hit that sweet spot towards the end of the album, though, it throws another batch of classically-structured and well-hybridized grind/metal/punk right in my scoffing, skeptical face. Serves me right.\n\nOn a rather odd note, the final track of the album is most strikingly reminiscent not of anything on Earache’s roster from two decades ago, but rather of Sweden’s own completely unfuckwithable malcontent, Bathory. For starters, the track is called “The Return,” which obviously makes me want to climb a great craggy mountain and proclaim “It’s the RETURN of the darkness and evil!!!” Apart from the nomenclature, though, take a second to just let the Resistant Culture track sink in. It’s a fully ambient track, featuring a bed of flute, wind sound effects, along with sparse chanting and tribal percussion. In the back, though, is a muted yet insistent bass drum beat. Got it in your head? Okay, now run and grab your Bathory records. Take a spin through that outro track on nearly all of them (it’s on the debut through Twilight of the Gods, and again on Blood On Ice and Nordland II). Of course it’s not exactly the same thing, but the Bathory outros all feature a single ambient tone, while in the distance, a single bass drum tolls out a slow recitation of doom. I can’t help but think of this as an homage, even if it was unintentionally done.\n\nAfter all, everyone needs more Bathory in her life.\n\nOverall rating, All One Struggle: 65%. If you dig the former, you’ll still dig this latter platter, though I find the former warmer.\n\n———————————————-\n\nResistant Culture is currently gearing up for what they are calling the Sacred Fire Tour throughout these United States. The tour coincides with reissues on Seventh Generation Records: All One Struggle on vinyl, and a third pressing of Welcome To Reality on CD.\n\nThe Sacred Fire Tour kicks off next week, with dates as follows. If you happen to live in the Chicago area, you would be especially well-advised to check out Resistant Culture’s date here on October 9th, as they are participating in the fourth iteration of the Apocalyptic Crust Fest. Resistant Culture will be playing the third and final day of the festival, alongside Phobia and Dropdead.

This history of ruthless political exploitation and callous disregard is clearly a topic ripe for the politicized fury of punk and grindcore, but it also seems that the musical and cultural influence of these diverse communities has much to offer to heavy metal by way of artistic and aesthetic exploration. There are only a few contemporary albums that bring to mind these influences, most notably Tomahawk’s Anonymous, and Nechochwen’s brilliant 2010 album, Azimuths to the Otherworld. Resistant Culture is absolutely dissimilar in musical approach to either of those acts, of course, but I suspect this is fertile ground for a shared ethical and aesthetic approach.\n\nThe challenge, of course, is to pay tribute to this history and to the heritage of these indigenous peoples without coopting or tokenizing them. Heavy metal may not be particularly well sensitized for such a task, but the political and artistic potential is tremendous. Historical revisionism, after all, can only succeed when a complacent mainstream culture grows tired of calling ‘bullshit’ on the lies and omissions of officialdom.\n\nThe New York Times ran another story, just the other day, on what seems essentially like racial segregation and the production of guilt-allaying ‘native’ pageantry at the Pendleton Round-Up rodeo event in Pendleton, Oregon. The author of the story writes, “A century later [from the beginnings of this event], the mill still provides blankets, and families are still paid to appear, $5 per person each day at the arena. Beef and vegetables are provided, as are tokens for other food. The winner of the ‘Best Dressed Indian Award’ at the parade gets 50 silver dollars” (New York Times, 9/23/10).\n\nBlankets. Think about that.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nShocking, I know, but heavy metal is not my only love. In fact, I love many other things – unicorns, rainbows, all the usual suspects. Also: mixing up cocktails. Not, of course, in the sense of actually being PAID for the work; this is purely a non-remunerative hobby. Still, it got me thinking.\n\nIn the canon of heavy metal substance abuse references, cocktails are assuredly a dismally distant last. We’re all used to the bulletbelts and beer mentality, and sure, there’s a fair bit of banging on about whiskey, and yeah, seems to me like My Dying Bride has probably penned a song or two along the lines of “Woe is me and pestilence on the earth / My red wine is spilt, and my black cat fled to Perth” or some such thing. Y’all ain’t never heard Abbath start off a song by dedicating it to Blashyrkh’s Mighty Dirty Martini, is my basic point.\n\nFor your consideration, then, I offer the following Heavy Metal Cocktails. Most of these are slight variations on classic cocktail recipes, with obvious name changes and ingredient additions here and there. I have tried to list one for each of several of heavy metal’s primary subgenres. So, the next time you’re all lagered out, and can’t tell your ass from your ales from your ankles, why not try banging your head whilst imbibing a slightly classier product?\n\n———————————\n\nClassic Heavy Metal: “The True Old School Old Fashioned”\n\n– The Old Fashioned is basically like the crusty old guy in the tattered “Number of the Beast” t-shirt who watches the entire show with one foot on the bar rail, and can be heard to vaguely mutter the word “whippersnappers” every now and again. A truly classic cocktail, this would make the perfect accompaniment to your daily rite of Angel Witch and “Lightning to the Nations”, or even a trawl back to Thin Lizzy’s “Jailbreak.”\n\nIngredients:\n\n– 1 1/2 oz. rye whiskey (Most types of whiskey will really suffice for a good Old Fashioned, but rye is the true old schooler’s choice. Go with bourbon if no rye’s on hand, but for sure stay away from Scotch for this one.)\n\n– Some smallish amount of sugar\n\n– Angostura bitters\n\n– Orange slice\n\n– Maraschino cherries (probably no more than two)\n\n– Club soda\n\nDirections:\n\nThey don’t call ’em Old Fashioned glasses for nothing, though you may also know them as lowballs (har har – fuck off). Put the sugar in the bottom of a dry Old Fashioned glass, and shake a few dashes of Angostura bitters on it. Add in the orange slice and cherries, and muddle them with the sugar and bitters to taste. Muddle the fruit more for a sweeter drink, though the classic preparation probably only bruises the fruit, releasing mostly oils rather than actual juice. Fill the glass to the top with ice, and pour the whiskey over it. I prefer to give the drink a brisk stir at this point, and then to top with just a splash of club soda. Now, listen: They’re playing your Manilla Road request.\n\nDeath Metal: “Tequila Smashed Face”\n\n– This is basically just a classic margarita recipe that’s been fucked with. It’ll still taste mostly like a margarita, too, until you get down to the bloody dregs. I couldn’t think of a spirit that screamed DEATH FUCKING METAL at me, so I just decided to take a classic recipe, put it in the wrong glass, and add a few visual cues that ought to remind you of the blood and guts so favored by the genre’s miscreant progenitors.\n\nIngredients:\n\n– 1 1/2 oz. tequila (probably of the more aged variety – a reposado or añejo – to give you a bit richer flavor against the tartness of the other ingredients)\n\n– 3/4 oz. Cointreau (any other sort of triple sec will do in a pinch, but Cointreau is the smoothest, far and away best option)\n\n– Juice of half a lime (do up a full lime if you like, but you’d probably want to toss in a bit of sugar or simple syrup if you go that route)\n\n– Fresh blueberries (5-10, depending on size; enough to cover the bottom layer of a highball glass)\n\n– Dash of grenadine\n\nDirections:\n\nDrop the fresh blueberries into the bottom of a dry highball glass. Muddle them gently; enough so the skins split anda bit of juice extrudes, but not so much that they completely lose definition. Combine the tequila, Cointreau, and lime juice in a cocktail shaker filled 2/3 full with ice. Fill the highball glass to the brim with fresh ice, then strain the cocktail shaker over it. Pour in a small dash of grenadine over the top, which should quickly filter through and mix with the muddled blueberries to give the drink the appearance of gruesome viscera. Well, gruesome and delicious viscera, that is. Careful not to spill your drink as you holler along to Morbid Angel.\n\nBlack Metal: “The Ragnarok Gimlet”\n\n– The gimlet is another classic drink, and probably a somewhat odd choice to represent black metal. All I’m really doing here, though, is playing on our popular representation of black metal as obsessed with the freezing cold of Scandinavian winters and sounding like the fuzzed-out maelstrom of a bestial blizzard. The key to really feeling the icy creep of evil in this drink is taking it VERY easy on the lime, and shaking the holy living fuck out of it to ensure MAXIMUM CHILL (which sounds like a long lost Steven Seagal flick, now that I think of it).\n\nIngredients:\n\n– 1 1/2 oz. gin (make it 2 oz. if you want to really taste the grimness)\n\n– A very sparing dash of Rose’s Sweetened Lime Juice\n\nDirections:\n\nClassically, the gimlet is served shaken and straight-up, but here I’m having you shake it but then serve it in an ice-filled lowball, so as best to simulate an icicle of black dread. Fill a cocktail shaker 1/2 full with ice, then pour in the gin and splash of sweetened lime. Then shake it like a soul possessed with the raw fury of Bathory, trapped in the midst of The Howling Wind’s Into the Cryosphere (or, better yet, Sleep Research Facility’s Deep Frieze). Shake it until your arm is just about to bust out of its socket. Then, strain it over a lowball filled with fresh ice. Consume quickly. And seriously. Please do not smile.\n\nGrindcore: “Multinational Corporations Brought You This Swedish Mule”\n\n– This one is just a Moscow Mule, adapted by adding a Swedish liqueur so as to pay homage to Nasum and all the other greats of Swedish grindcore. Made with the right kind of ingredients, this little fucker packs quite a kick, and when you add in one of the apocryphal stories about this drink’s genesis as a way for organized crime to sneakily serve alcohol during Prohibition in the States, this should at least hint at some of the political furor that so animates grindcore’s most hallowed practitioners.\n\nIngredients:\n\n– 1 oz. vodka (though an extra tip of the bottle won’t hurt any)\n\n– 1/2 oz. Rose’s Sweetened Lime Juice (you can use fresh-squeezed lime instead, but I prefer Rose’s, so long as you don’t use too much)\n\n– 6-8 oz. ginger beer (NOTE: It is absolutely crucial for the success of this drink that you are using a ginger beer rather than a ginger ale. Or, if you’re using something called ginger ale, be sure that it’s brewed in the older fashion, where it actually has the bite and spice of real ginger. That Canada Dry bullshit ain’t going to cut it here.)\n\n– Splash (or up to 1/2 oz.) Cherry Heering (Cherry Heering is a Swedish liqueur, or really more like a cherry brandy. Go with Heering, though, rather than some cheaper knock-off cherry brandy, which will more likely than not remind you of childhood cough syrups.)\n\nDirections:\n\nFill a highball glass with ice. Pour the vodka and lime juice over the ice, and fill the glass almost the rest of the way full with the ginger beer. Give things a little stir, and then pour a small bit of the Cherry Heering over the top. The cherry flavor should be subtle enough so as not to overpower the fierce kick of ginger (redolent of Napalm Death and Terrorizer’s pioneering use of the blastbeat, say), but should give the drink that nice sheen of blood-soaked lore, just like the daily work of government and corporations is to wring out their dollars to squeeze out the blood of the poor and innocent. Et cetera.\n\nDoom: “Summer In Siberia”\n\n– I wanted to keep things fairly simple for this. Doom has its roots in the UK (as does all heavy metal, obviously), so another option for a doom metal drink is a Black Velvet (half Guinness Draught, half champagne). Still, some of the gloomiest, most stretched-out dooooooom has lately come from Scandinavia, and Finland in particular, the landscape of which, in my mind at least, is of a piece with the vast snow-sodden expanses of Russia, with its stoic tundra pockmarked with rusted machinery and towering industrial factories. Realities so blunt require a drink unvarnished with niceties and distractions. The lemon is there as merely a gesture; a poor substitute for the blighted sun, perhaps never to return.\n\nIngredients:\n\n– Vodka. In some amount. More than 2 oz. might be pushing it, but hell, this is DOOOOOOM.\n\n– A squeeze of fresh lemon\n\nDirections:\n\nThis is another one that I think ought to be as cold as possible. If you’re averse to having the cloudy appearance that shards of cracked ice will give to the drink as I’m presenting it here, then feel free to stir the drink in the cocktail shaker rather than shake it. If you stir it, though, stir it many times, and quickly. Otherwise: Fill a cocktail shaker 1/2 full of ice. Pour in the vodka, and shake the shit out of it. Strain the chilled vodka into a lowball glass filled with fresh ice. Give a freshly cut lemon a little squeeze over the top of the glass, and give it a stir. Now, sit and wait for the slow, inevitable crush of the tectonic plates. Mother Russia demands solicitude and obedience.\n\nSludge: “The Bayou Filth Hound”\n\n– The American South is known for its whiskeys, whether it be Tennessee’s Jack Daniels or the fuck tons of bourbons from Kentucky. That same climate has, as you know, produced a bearded slew of sludging bruisers in recent years; look to the Savannah, Georgia scene if you require proof (mildly-veiled Deathspell Omega reference, hey-o). This concoction is one of my very favorite variations on the classic Old Fashioned recipe (obviously with many liberties taken), and adds the mint in homage to the signature drink of the Kentucky Derby, the mint julep. Plus, this preparation of the drink produces a viscous, swampy-looking thing that sits in your glass, daring you to drink its poison promise down. Muddy like the backwaters of Louisiana, this one.\n\nIngredients:\n\n– 1 1/2 or 2 oz. of good Kentucky bourbon (Maker’s Mark tends to be my go-to because of its wide availability, but any fine bourbon, especially of the spicier variety, will do quite nicely)\n\n– Brown sugar (anywhere from a pinch to a few spoonfuls, depending on your preference)\n\n– Angostura bitters (anywhere from one dash to half a dozen)\n\n– Half a lime\n\n– Two Maraschino cherries\n\n– Four or five fresh mint leaves\n\n– Club soda\n\nDirections:\n\nJust like the Old Fashioned above, you’ll be building this drink in a lowball glass. Put the brown sugar in the bottom of the empty glass (hella existential). Personally, I like a bit more brown sugar than you might imagine. At least a good spoonful, I’d say. Then, to counteract the potential over-sweetness, I like to give several hefty dashes of Angostura bitters over the sugar. Cut the lime half into quarters, and muddle them with the Maraschino cherries in the sugar and bitters. Feel free to muddle with vigor here, as we’re trying to go for the opaque, swampy look with this drink. After you’ve released most of the juices from the fruit, toss in the mint leaves, and muddle just a little more, but now more gently, so that you keep the leaves intact, but bruised. Now fill the glass with ice and pour in the bourbon. At this point, give the drink a good stirring, and then top it off with a bit of club soda. Finally, hold the glass up to your eyes and gaze into its murky depths. Un-receded flood waters. Alligators glide with stealth through the swamp. A man plucks a banjo on a wooden porch, but cannot be heard over the noise of your favorite Eyehategod record. Pull this drink in between your teeth. Feel the thickness, and taste, in its chill, the oppressive heat of America. Your America. My America. Our sadness.\n\n———————————\n\nCheers!\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nNails, Unsilent Death (2010)\n\nOkay, sure, so Nails may be one of the more hyped bands of 2010. Thing is, I was pretty much oblivious to all that hype, and just stumbled across this album at the record store a few weeks back. I had just read the news item that Nails had just signed to Southern Lord and were going to be reissuing this album, so I figured, why not pick up a copy of the Six Feet Under CD issue?\n\nHoly shit, does this record smoke. I suppose the complaints about calling a 13+ minute release a ‘full-length’ are valid, but they sort of miss the point. And in fact, when these dudes get around to putting out another release, I think that will be the real test of their skills, because while this release is nearly perfectly crafted for its running time, it remains to be seen how this sort of material will be handled over a longer expanse.\n\nStylistically speaking, this record takes a little bit of everything nasty and grimy, throws it in a concrete blender, and lobs noise grenades unmercifully in your general direction. Sure, it’s a bit grindcore, but more like old Napalm Death grind (circa From Enslavement to Obliteration, say) than any of the more modern crop of death/grinders (Pig Destroyer, newer Brutal Truth, Disfear, maybe even fellow Southern Lords Black Breath, and so forth). It’s also a little bit crust, more than a little bit hardcore (this is Todd Jones, ex- of Terror, after all), with a bit of bruising sludge tossed in the slower parts of the two lengthier tracks on display.\n\nListening to the album, though, doesn’t make it sound quite as much like a convoluted mash-up as I’ve just described it. One of the greatest things this album has going for it is its sense of fluid motion. The three-piece careens from one song to another with great finesse, while keeping the whole affair swathed in a gooey, rattling production, rather like fighting with a badger inside of a dumpster. They also use guitar feedback quite effectively, either in tight, staccato bursts, or as a way to transition between songs.\n\nAlso impressive is their ability to write actual songs, even crammed into 30 or 60 second bursts. “Scum Will Rise” is one of the most effective tunes on here, blasting through an identifiable verse-chorus structure before locking into a pummeling breakdown for its final ten seconds. It’s precisely the sort of breakdown that metallers lacking in self-confidence might look askance at, but it’s still far from hardcore thuggishness, so breathe easy, friends. No one will look down on you for stomping around like a maniac.\n\nThe guitar tone verges on the classic Swedish death metal sound, but it twins very nicely with the thick, dirty bass tone. In terms of composition, the bass typically follows or doubles the guitar, meaning the songs aren’t generally very intricate, but exceedingly powerful and driven. The title track is a nice example of this, with its sullen, stomping death march feel.\n\nI do hesitate to describe this as grindcore too much, but “Scapegoat” definitely shows Nails at their most Nasum-esque, while a song like “No Servant” is a bit more straight-ahead hardcore/metal with a slightly Slayer-ish guitar solo. Closing track “Depths” might just be the best one here, with its doomed-out opening riff playing like their own filthy version of Black Sabbath’s classic tritone. The tune later breaks into some classic d-beat drum patterns, and eventually sludges its way to an equally doomed-out close after wrecking nearly everything in its path.\n\nThe album has a very nice sense of symmetry in its ‘sides’, with each batch of five songs blasting through four short, fast crust/hardcore/grind/death/whatever tunes before closing out with a longer, sludged-up capstone. I’m a sucker for this sort of thing, as it gives the album a sense of thoughtful unity, rather than just a bunch of pissed-off tunes slapped together.\n\nAll in all, this is some fierce, filthy noise, and Nails are definitely a band to watch. As I said above, I’ll need to see what they can do on a 25 to 35-minute release before I’m thoroughly convinced, but Unsilent Death is ample cause to be excited for whatever it is that Nails do next.\n\nOverall rating: 78%. Nothing much new, really, but sure as hell kicking the shit out of the old like it’s going out of style.\n\nRead Full Post »"
