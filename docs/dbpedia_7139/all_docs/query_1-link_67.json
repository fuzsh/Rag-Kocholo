        "text": "KARL SANDERS:\n\nSaurian Meditation (2004) As advertised, Nile band leader Karl Sanders performs a full cd of semi traditional egyptian influenced music, similar to the intros found on any Nile album (sans the crazy death metal part that usually follows). Originally I wasn't going to pick this up since one of the cool bits about Nile is the contrast between the intros and the crazy metal, without the crazy metal, would the album just be boring? Well, more ambient, certainly, the pace of this album could not be described as fast by any means, but then again, the album is called \"Saurian Meditations\", so brutal speed isn't necessarily conducive to meditating. Anyways, after dismissing the album, I then figured later on that some spooky egyptian style music may be the perfect thing to listen to at 3 in the morning after a hard night of craziness, and in that respect this album delivers. Expect lots of repeating droning passages, acoustic guitar, traditional/tribal drumming, choral chanting, and with just the hint of distorted guitar now and again. The album is 10 long tracks, and I pretty much enjoyed all the songs except for track 2, 'Ishtar', which is 10 minutes of a very repetitive riff, and these clean melodic vocals that I quite frankly find annoying, you may wish to press skip once after the first song. Like Apocalyptica, if you can enjoy something heavy and spooky performed with traditional instruments rather than the usual wall of distortion, I can certainly recommend picking this up.\n\nSaurian Exorcisms (2009) Very much in the same vein as Karl's first solo album. Thankfully this one goes 100% sans clean vocals (with the exception of the use of chanting and wailing, of course). The music is haunting, atmospheric, and has some really nice percussion. You even get to listen to Karl shred on the acoustic guitar (or whatever equivalent traditional instrument he's playing) on the track 'Contemplate this On the Tree of Woe'. You have to be in the right mood for this sorta thing, but if that mood strikes, this album is spectacular, well orchestrated, thickly layered, and highly recommended.\n\nSaurian Apocalypse (2022) Again, if you liked the first two, this third will not disappoint. A few highlight, I love the second track 'The Disembodied Yet Slither Among Us' which has this really odd riff where the guitars hit the note slightly offbeat every time the section repeats, gives this nice unsettling feeling. Track 3 'The Evil Inherent in us All' has a number of faster elements, it's almost like Karl took a death metal song and played it acoustically underneath the traditional instruments. Later in the album there's even some tastefully done modern drum work, but personally I prefer when he sticks with the traditional ancient sounding instruments and percussion. Vocalwise, the usual wailing, and some unfathomable words that I suspect in ancient times were meant to release demons from bondage. Not sure if this is the end of a trilogy or there's more to come, but another great album in the set, and a fantastic counterpoint / accompaniment to the utter brutality of Nile.\n\nSANZU:\n\nPainless (2015, EP) This band plays mid-paced old school death metal, heavy as fuck. The best comparison I can draw is with Gojira, although a little less experimental (maybe a touch of Vile as well). They have the pummeling sound, the driving midpaced double kicks, and the pick scrapes. The riffs are excellent, very memorable material. And the production quality is fantastic, a really huge sound thanks to plenty of guitar overdubbing, detuning and a nice scooped mix. Vocals are midranged raspy growls all the way through (somewhat Carcass-esque). Very impressive 5 song EP, can't wait for a full length.\n\nHeavy Over The Home (2015) I have no idea what the title of this album means, but I am glad it has the word \"Heavy\" in it, because that is the best way to describe this material. A steamroller crushing you into the pavement heavy. Really there's no much more I can say about this album that wasn't said in my review of their EP, the songs are crushing, the chord progressions have enough oddity to them to keep them interesting. Its Gojira without the lighter bits, which in a way may be a disadvantage, because other than the acoustic finale song, everything on this album is so heavy that the songs tend to blend a bit. So maybe if I could offer one bit of advice, maybe a few more moments of calm, but otherwise, great album, a must buy.\n\nSAPROGENIC:\n\nDemo 2001 (2001)\n\nWet Sound Of Flesh On Concrete (2003) While still a little rough around the edges, this gargly death metal band shows a lot of promise. Most of the issues in fact are with the production, otherwise, this is some killer material in the vein of Malignancy, Disgorge or Disavowed. Songwriting, as usual, is the key, and Saprogenic writes damn good songs. Ok, now to the rough parts, the guitar sound is not very good at all, it's very, very muffled. Like, take your favorite album, turn bass up to 10, and turn mids and high to 0. Not just like 3 or 4, I mean 0. The drums thankfully don't suffer this same problem, however, the treble of the drums along with no treble in the guitars leads to a very uneven mix. But I do recommend taking the time to just accept the fact that the recording isn't perfect, since the riffs are well worth it. One tiny tiny issue as well is while the drummer is obviously very skilled and quick, the double bass work could be slightly more even and precise. However, looking at the band photo, these guys seem pretty young, so they have plenty of time to work on these issues. Well worth a listen and I can't wait to hear their second album.\n\nIchneumonid (2006) Wow, the band went from way too much bass to perhaps not enough. Amazing how these things flip flop. But honestly, this is a far better mix for the group, while a little extra bass would have been nice, this is far more even handed than their debut. Otherwise, what you'd expect, garbage compactor vocals, lots of blasting, fast double bass, style wise these guys would probably fall more into the Deranged or Severe Torture category with this new release. This is high quality death metal, nothing too new or innovative, but decent riffs, good performance, and plenty of anger.\n\nExpanding Toward Collapsed Lungs (2013) After a long hiatus, the band is back. And this is probably their best album so far. First the mix is better than either of their previous efforts, maybe a tiny touch too little treble, but overall the bass and highend are mixed a lot better. Songwise the band hasn't changed much, the riffs do tend to blend together somewhat, but they're all high quality. Plenty of riffs that involve inhumanly fast double bass while the rest of the band plays slow, those riffs always make me smile. The vocals are a little more Chris Barnes this time, low but a little more understandable in spots. If you dig old school death metal and haven't given the band a try, check em out, they may be your thing.\n\nSARKASM:\n\nIncubated Mind (1991, Demo)\n\nInner Flame (1992, Demo)\n\nAdvanced Tape (1992, Demo)\n\nSATARIEL:\n\nThy Heavens Fall (1994, Demo)\n\nHellfuck (1995, Demo)\n\nDemo '96 (1996, Demo)\n\nLady Lust Lilith (1998) This band never seems to quite figure out what they are. Touches of symphonic, black and death metal. Black metal screamed vocals mixed with singing. Jackhammer blast beats and then mid-tempo rock drumming. But after considering the constant shifting of styles from one moment to the next, I have to admit it works more often than not. These guys are definitely angry, and they can write a good song as well as a good riff. The guitar tone is huge (sounds like old Entombed), and the production is good, but a bit noisy at times (but that's a prerequisite for black metal). If you like black metal, but also enjoy some good technical death metal type riffs, check out this band, they might have just what you need.\n\nPromo 2K (2000, Promo)\n\nPhobos And Deimos (2001) Improving on the formula from the last album, this cd is tighter, a little more symphonic in parts, and overall more polished. In a style where I'd say Arch Enemy is the current king, this band gives them a good run for their money with some pretty spectacular song writing. Also, there's some decent variety here without sounding all-over-the-map as in their previous album. For example, vocal wise, you find a mixture of gargled vocals, high pitched screams, group shouting, and some more operatic singing parts like any of Yngwie's singers (which are a bit cheesy, but not so much so to detract from the overall goodness). Drum wise, instead of a constant barrage of speed, this guy holds back until the perfect moment to hit you with a double bass passage or a blast beat, which makes them that much more effective. Guitar tone is thick, wall of sound kinda thing. Arch Enemy fans owe it to themselves to check these guys out.\n\nHydra (2005) What the hell happened? I mean, Satariel has always had melodic elements to their music, but this is way out of wack. Guitarwise just about every riff is a held chord, like held for a bar, then a new note held for another bar. Drumwise everything is mid-tempo, 4x4 time. No blast beats. Barely any double kicks. Certainly nothing complex beyond keeping time. I doubt the drummer even worked up a sweat. And while there are still a few raspy black metalish vocals, most are the sung stuff. I mean, it's not like most of the album is like this, the entire album is like this (with the possible exception of 'Nihil Juggernaut', but that's only one song of ten). Where's the anger? The intensity? The energy? I can totally imagine the band performing this will simultaneously sipping tea and sitting on couches. A huge disappointment, avoid at all costs.\n\nWhite Ink: Chapter One (2014, EP) After a 9 year wait, we finally see the light of day on \"White Ink\". Or at least part of it (3 songs), I guess the band has decided to release the album as a set of 3 EPs. The results are way better than their last album \"Hydra\", the EP still has sung vocals, but overall has more growling and some of the heaviness has returned. So not as heavy as their earlier 2 albums, but more in that direction. Overall the 3 songs are good, the first is generally midpaced and heavy, the second song is a little slower, then back to midpaced for the last song. A blast beat here of there would have helped, but this is certainly enough to get me interested in hearing the other 2 EPs, and then how all the songs hold together as a whole.\n\nSCAR CULTURE:\n\nInscribe (2001) Combining many of the best elements from death metal and hardcore, there's no rapping to be heard here, but a strong groove mixed with double kicks and tremolo picking. Vocals are mid and high pitched screams. It's hard to pin any sort of label on these guys, they have the rushed pace of Deranged, mixed with some groovier parts, and some screaming reminiscent of Nasum. Production wise, everything is clear, the sound is a little loose, but it gives it that live unpolished feel that probably works with their style. The band managed to mix a lot of influences into a coherent sound that's pretty damn vicious.\n\nSCARVE:\n\nTranslucence (2000) While it has some Scarve like elements, this album is definitely the first infant steps for the band. First off, the vocals on this album are very different from their later releases, far more power metal than the death metal growls of later albums (think any of Yngwie's vocalists). Second, the riffs are generally more straight forward. But the spacy atmosphere is the same, and there are some good songs here. I especially dig many of the atmospheric breaks. Not as unique or strong as their 2nd and 3rd albums, but still some good songs worth checking out.\n\nLuminiferous (2002) While similar to their \"Irradiant\" album, various elements have been accentuated or played down. For example, the Meshuggah like clean guitar stuff is not as evident on this cd. There are still clean breaks, they're just even more spacy with extra keyboards, wailing guitars and thickly distorted held chords as their primary ingredients. And the sung vocals are even more prevalent here (although they do still have plenty of standard death metal growling too, just not as often). Thankfully, due to the very odd nature of the chord progressions, the clean vocals still manage to remain spooky and disturbing. Otherwise, the same sort of material, a huge, huge production with tons of layered instruments (the mix is only slightly inferior to their later album). The main two things I love is how dense this music is, and how odd the chord changes are, it makes it interesting to listen to while simultaneously brutal on the eardrums due to so much going on. Highly recommended for any fans of sci-fi / techno metal.\n\nIrradiant (2004) Sort of a cross between Meshuggah and Strapping Young Lad. Now hold on a second, I know what you're gonna say, \"Not another meshuggah clone!!\", but no, these guys aren't really clones. Generally a Meshuggah clone copies Meshuggah's complex stop-start rhythms and strange time signatures. Scarve on the other hand does stuff similar to Meshuggah's clean breaks, the spacy acoustic parts with melodic distorted guitar solos overtop (in fact, Fred Thordendal makes a guest appearance for a guitar solo). The more aggressive rhythm parts tend to be more like a standard death metal band. Speaking of rhythm, the guitar sound is huge on this album, tons of overdubs, they manage to use reverb without making the sound muddy or too echoey (just like Strapping Young Lad's \"City\" cd, which happens to use the same producer used here, Daniel Bergstrand). Also, the band uses two vocalists, one death metal growler, and one who does sung vocals that sound somewhat similar to the guy from Slapdash, ie, it's sung, but it's not \"beautiful\" singing, it's more raw and fits in with the overall vibe to the music. Basically, if you want something that's got the big sound of SYL, the spacy guitars of Meshuggah, and just some damn good and memorable songs, check this band out. A digipak version has 2 lives tracks as well.\n\nThe Undercurrent (2007) Quite similar to their previous release, with a few extra twists. Scarve still have plenty of super thick distorted guitars, clean and screamed vocals, blasts and double bass. The thing that's a bit different here is the song structure. On previous releases, the band was a bit more song oriented. It was easier to tell specific songs apart, there were some really strong standout riffs, and the structure of the songs were a little more straight forward. These songs are less distinct, they tend to blend together as though the whole album were one long complex song. At first listen, I wasn't super impressed, but something kept me coming back, and after multiple listens I have to say I'm digging this album more. It's not conveniently packaged for your consumption, it's not easy to process. With all its winding melodies, intricate drumwork and almost overly distorted guitarwork that creates a dizzying wall of sound, \"The Undercurrent\" is just that, the sound grabs you like a riptide and pulls you out to sea. Like a nightmare or a fever dream, this album is complex, dense, and not to be understood as much as it's there to be experienced. I think overall I prefered their other two albums, but this CD is something I can see getting better with age.\n\nSCATTERED REMNANTS:\n\nProcreating Mass Carnage (1994, Demo) Similar to their 'Perversion' demo. Good riffs, great production, low guitar, bass and vocals. Good quality, but not very original.\n\nInherent Perversion (1995, Demo) The production on this CD is surprising good considering this is just a demo band. They obviously sunk a lot of money into this album, and in the end it was probably worth it. The band won't win anything for originality, but they do provide lots of brutality and several cool riffs in a traditional grind/death style. The guitars are low and the bass is huge, and as I mentioned, the production is excellent. Now they just need to work on setting themselves apart from the other bands in the genre.\n\nDestined To Fail (1998) Nothing new here, just powerful, angry death metal. The production is very powerful, possibly a bit muddy, but you won't notice because you'll be too busy picking your teeth off the floor after the sound slams you in the face. Some nice riffs, hooks and catchy phrases (catchy in the sense they stick in your head and won't go away easily), the band can be really tight at times without losing a certain live and spontaneous quality to the sound. The songs shift from fast pace blastathons to slower, more epic sludge fests. Some nice serene intros with good use of keyboards and acoustic guitars. Not the best death metal CD of all time or anything, but definitely up there on the list for stuff I've heard in the recent past.\n\nIndulgence In Masochism (2002, comp) Their first album and two demos compilated into a single CD on their new label.\n\nSEANCE:\n\nLevitised Spirit (1991, Demo)\n\nFornever Laid To Rest (1992) Relatively unmemorable death metal. Good songs, good drums, good vocals, but nothing spectacular. The production isn't bad.\n\nSaltrubbed Eyes (1993) This album is a real departure from the first, mainly due to an incredibly distorted bass, which is very prominent in the mix, giving them a very distinctive sound (although it also makes the mix a bit muddy). The guitar and drums are also great, these guys just hammer away at every song as though their life depended on it.\n\nAwakening Of The Gods (2009) After a 16 year hiatus, the band returns with a brand new album. The results are sadly a little disappointing. First off, this isn't as much death metal anymore as it is thrash with death metal vocals. Imagine Slayer with the heavier vocals and you get the general idea. Soundwise, the super distorted bass of their previous album is way toned down, which takes away some of their unique sound. The riffs are far more generic, you get that feeling that you've heard the song before, even though you haven't. And a few of the songs are basically rock songs, like later Entombed. The album isn't horrible, it's obvious the band is putting energy into the music, but overall I feel the songs are a little flat and the sound isn't nearly as brutal. If you're a fan of thrash, it's worth checking out, but I think it's far more likely that I'll reach for my copy of \"Saltrubbed Eyes\" instead of this.\n\nSENSORY AMUSIA:\n\nDisrepair (2013) I've had a bit of a tough time reviewing this CD, mostly because it's difficult to find a good comparison with which to explain the band's style. Most of the bands that do sound anything like Sensory Amusia are bands so obscure they really don't make for good comparisons (like Canada's short lived Subversion). I'll see if I can deconstruct their style: It's modern brutal death metal for sure, it's somewhat technical but not overly so, it's mostly mid paced but still has blasts and double bass, it's a little groovy but not super so, it's very detuned, just a touch of djent riffing. Vocals are mid-range growls. A few disharmonic bits. Really nice thick production quality. Again, tough to pin this band down, and that's a good thing, they manage to have a unique sound while at the same time feel very comforting, like a good book we've read before. Def worth checking out, I dig what they're doing, a really impressive debut.\n\nIn Extremis (2019, EP) Not a lot has changed in 6 years. This 5 song ep (4+bonus track of different style) reminds us \"Oh ya, that band, glad they're still around\". Same brutal melange of styles. Even thicker heavier production than the last one. Good blasts, good screams, good detuned parts. Welcome back to the band, hope to see a new full length soon.\n\nBereavement (2020, EP) Guess rather than full length they decided to do a new EP (between this and the last one, they probably could have just released a full new album). Same general style as the previous one, lots of super speed, brutal thick sound, some groovier bits to keep the songs unique. Really strong song writing and memorable riffs overall. If you haven't checked out this band, do it now, they're releasing some great stuff!\n\nBreed Death (2022) Much in the same vein as their last two EP, this 2nd full length from the band is so brutal it can peel paint off walls. While I am a big fan of technical death metal with its clear precision, the thing I love about this group is how raw their music sounds. It might not be as tight as other bands, but the sound creates this intensity that's tough to argue with. Crazy blasting and double bass, HUGE wall of sound on the guitars, no frequency is left unfilled with this mix. If you want something that's a little less sleek, but more of a wounded animal that will claw and scratch your eyes out, this is for you/\n\nSEPTYCAL GORGE:\n\nGrowing Seeds of Decay (2006)\n\nErase the Insignificant (2009) Similar to their \"Scourge\" album, with two notable differences. First, I feel the hooks aren't quite as memorable, the band certainly refined their song writing for their 3rd album, for comparison, this album is a little more Disgorge and a little less Deeds Of Flesh. But there's still plenty of fun riffs here to keep things interesting, and I have the feeling they're likely to grown on me. And 2, the production quality is far better on this album, the sock is gone, and you have a really nice mix of deep bass and high end guitar tremolo picking. While their 3rd album is better, this one still has plenty of good moments and is well worth picking up.\n\nScourge of the Formless Breed (2014) A combination of early Hate Eternal, Exmortem, and modern Deeds of Flesh. So fast technical death metal with lots of time changes, but with an extra focus on memorable songs and riffs. This album is pretty insane from a speed perspective, lots of fast alternate picking and then slower breakdowns, and the drumming from monster drummer Davide Billia drives the riffs over the top in insanity. As well as classics like the breakneck speed of 'Coil Of Nothingness', the band also hits us hard with a slow dirge called 'Deeds Of Eternity', which helps show off their versatility. The only downside is I'm not a big fan of the production quality, its clear and tight, but the mix is missing something, almost like my speaker has a sock over it or something that's dulling the sound. Otherwise though, excellent release!\n\nSEPULTURA:\n\nBestial Devastation (1985, EP)\n\nMorbid Visions (1986, EP)\n\nSchizophrenia (1987)\n\nBeneath The Remains (1989)\n\nArise (1991) It's fast and furious, lots of strong riffs, quickly and accurately performed. It's tame by today's standards, but a revolutionary album when it first came out. The production also needs more bass.\n\nThird World Posse (1992, EP)\n\nChaos A.D. (1993) Powerful production, the thing that really sets this album apart from others is the tribal influences. While staying true to the Sepultura style, they've added lots of tribal drumming (thank to Igor) and haunting acoustic breaks. It's metal music from the Amazon, raw and unpolished. Excellent song writing helps keep it all together.\n\nRoots (1996) A little more tribal, a little less metal, great song writing, and some of the strangest noises to come out of a guitar ever. The tone is muddier and noisier, but the sound will smash you around like a sledge hammer.\n\nBlood-Rooted (1997, Rare) An album that includes bonus tracks from the Chaos A.D. and Roots sessions, some demos, and 7 live songs (mainly songs from Chaos A.D.) There's nothing mind blowing here, just good songs, and lots of what makes Sepultura such a classic band. Live or studio, the production is great, and the vibe is even better.\n\nAgainst (1998) Sort of \"Roots\", but the singer doesn't have an accent anymore. After all the turmoil when Max Cavalera left the group, the question was, would the rest of the band stick together? The answer, yes, replacing the brazilian vocalist with newcomer Derrick Green. Does he do a good job? Yes, because he doesn't try and replace Max. He does his best to add his own variety of angry shouting (and the odd spoken word segment) to the mix, and it works in general. As for the rest of the band, it's still Sepultura, that mix of thrash and tribal beats, with acoustic songs and speedy punkish riffs. Nothing terribly revolutionary here, some weak songs, some strong songs, generally the performance is good. Anyone who liked \"Roots\" and the direction the band went with that CD should like this album.\n\nNations (2001) Well, it sounds like Sepultura, but there's just no intensity to this album. Where before they'd mix more quiet parts with angry parts to provide mood and variety, the \"angry\" parts to this CD just lack any true anger, there's no heart to this stuff anymore. Just when a song might be getting heavy they quickly switch to a more atmospheric riff that just ruins the pacing of the songs. No originality, no intensity, I didn't like 99% of the riffs on the album, the production isn't all that good. Sorry, I'll have to qualify this as a must miss.\n\nChaos DVD (2002, DVD) Three of the band's old videos all on DVD now. It all starts with \"Under Siege: Live in Barcelona\", which is a full live concert from the \"Arise\" period. While the music is well produced and performed, it seems like 0% of the time was spent matching the sound with the visuals, Max is screaming when he's obviously nowhere near a mike, toms are pounded while igor is on the ride, it's a pretty big mess. It might capture some of the \"abstract\" feeling of being at a sepultura concert, but for me capturing a concert should be a more faithful representation of the music. Maybe close your eyes and just enjoy the music. Next comes the \"Third World Chaos\" video, originally released after \"Chaos AD\", which has very little live music, but a lot of music videos. While as a general rule I don't like music videos, I'll admit Sepultura do a good job of them, videos for 'Arise', 'Territory' and 'Refuse / Resist' are all nice visual collages with some killer music mixed in. Finally, a short 20 min video called \"We Are What We Are\", which shows 3 videos from the \"Roots\" session. Each video has a 3-4 min interview with band members discussing the making of the video and the ideas behind the songs, which is pretty cool. Anyways, while I wouldn't necessarily label this DVD a \"must have\", any sepultura fan will probably find enough goodness in here to keep them happy, or if you already own the 3 videos, here's a nice way to get them all together on one disc.\n\nUnder A Pale Grey Sky (2002, Live) The last concert with former vocalist Max Cavalera, recorded in Brixton England, 96. You get 2 CD, 28 songs, 2 hours of Sepultura at the peak of their game. The set list is fantastic with plenty of older and newer material, just about every song that made them great is here, recorded and mixed to perfection, and played with conviction. If I had any critique it's I got tired of Max introducing just about every song with either the name of the songs or a memorable line from the lyrics. All fans of the band must get this CD.\n\nRoorback (2003) After a short intro, track 1 \"Come Back Alive\" hits you with a ton of bricks. Wow, is this a missing bonus track from Chaos A.D.? Well, no, since this isn't Max singing, but it bodes quite well for the rest of the album. By track 5, I'm still waiting for the album to fall on it's face, but thankfully it never does. Overall, a lot of good songs, a little filler here and there, but lightyears ahead of \"Nations\". It's the lowness and experimental nature of \"Roots\" with the guitar tone of \"Chaos A.D.\" Perhaps the best explanation would be this, \"Chaos A.D.\" / \"Roots\" is the pinnacle of the band, \"Against\" is somewhere on the slope down, \"Nations\" is the lowest valley. \"Roorback\" is now on the slope upwards again, they're not at the top of their game again yet, but definitely headed in the right direction, so I'm excited about the future. The band has managed to prove that they are not irrelevant in today's music scene, they still do have something to offer, and, well, that's just a comforting thought, Sepultura is back.\n\nDante XXI (2006) I went into this cd with pretty low expectations. Yes, their last album kicked some serious ass, but I'd heard a preview song or two off this cd and they were ok but not great. I wasn't not interested in the cd, lets just say when the album arrived in the mail, opening and playing it wasn't the first thing on my list. But maybe the low expectations helped, because once I did put this cd on and it was actually decent, talk about a big surprise! The first thing that struck me is how energetic the music feels again. The first 4 tracks or so are just speedy, Igor is doing fast stuff on the drums again, and the frantic pace really grabs you and pulls you into the album. By track 5 or so, things slow down for the middle of the cd, but they keep things interesting with a few out-of-the-ordinary riffs whose originality sticks with you, and makes you want to listen to them again (like the first riff in 'Fighting On'). Things speed up again a bit toward the end with 'Crown And Miter', and then closes with 'Still Flame' which is again slow, mostly traditional instruments and a nice spooky song, but would have probably been better as an intro to a big powerful closing number instead of being the closing number. Song writing wise, better than their last, still no \"Chaos AD\" or \"Roots\", but a worthy CD from the band, and a few really memorable songs which could go down as Sepultura classics. Don't delay like I did, this cd is worth your immediate attention.\n\nA-Lex (2009) After such a fantastic last album, the band decided to once again write a concept album based on a book, this time they chose 'A Clockwork Orange'. An odd choice since the book was written by an English author, and this is a brazilian band, but hey, I'm willing to give it a shot. The result is another super solid album. So many awesome riffs in here, like the odd time signature of the main riff in 'Filthy Rot' (and perfectly placed tribal vocals overtop). The odd rhythm also gives new drummer Jean Dolabella a chance to show off his stuff, and he delivers some spectacular tribal rhythms. Igor may have been the pioneer in the style, but this guy does a great job continuing the tradition. The album is also split up into several parts using short instrumental songs, which breaks up the brutal bits, giving the album a lot of variety as well as giving the band a chance to use lots of odd instruments such as keyboards and a full orchestra for one song. This isn't all experimentation though, several really fast and thrashy songs pummel the listener, including the album closer, it's nice to see the album ended strong. The heavy use of detuned guitar and super tribal drumming really reminds me of \"Roots\". If you enjoyed \"Roots\", \"Chaos AD\" or their last one, I think you'll really dig this album too.\n\nKairos (2011) Stripped down is my first reaction here. First off the production quality sounds very much like early Sepultura, ie, \"Beneath The Remains\" or \"Arise\", so clear but not as powerful as what we can get with modern production. The songs are also looser, not sloppy or anything, it just seems like they're a little less frenetic. I suppose after the last two albums, which were more structured due to them being based thematically on two books, the band just wanted to relax a bit on this album. Overall the result is a good album, but not as good IMO as their last two. There are some excellent riffs on here, and some great songs, but there's also some filler, like a cover of Ministry's \"One More Fix\" right in the middle of the album, which really doesn't add anything new, it's just a pretty much verbatim copy of the song. My two favorite tracks are probably the two openers, 'Spectrum' and 'Kairos', they're not fast songs but they are catchy. I'd also say I miss having a few more fast songs, there are a couple, but would love to hear something more vicious like 'Moloko Mesto' off of \"A-Lex\". I think people will like this one, but I think their previous two will get more airplay as the years go on.\n\nThe Mediator Between The Head And Hands Must Be The Heart (2013) I guess Sepultura has gone all Nile with the length of their titles for this one. With an album title referring to the \"Heart\", you might expect a slower, gentler Sepultura, but the first song on the album 'Trauma of War' proves that completely false, as it's probably one of the most frantic brutal Sepultura tracks I've heard in awhile. The rest of the album is a good mix of slow stuff, groovy stuff and fast stuff. I especially like the middle of 'Tsunami' that has a riff reminiscent of Marty Friedman's \"Dragon Kiss\" solo album. Another solid release from the band, if you dug their last 3 albums, this is pretty much more of the same, but the band still writes a catchy riff, does a good job of keeping things varied, and injects a few extra fast songs which I appreciate.\n\nMachine Messiah (2017) A bit of a departure for the band. While there's still plenty of fast songs and heavy stuff, \"Machine Messiah\" shows the band getting a little more experimental, mostly in the form of orchestral elements. We start with a very slow dirge that includes soft clean singing, and has a very dramatic theatrical tone to it. Then track 2 is back to what we'd normally expect from a Sepultura song (although the blast beats in this song are poorly performed). Then comes 'Phantom Self', which is heavy and has a good hook, and includes a fiddle section in the middle that has a strong middle eastern or gyspie-esque vibe to it. Then 'Iceberg Dances' is a heavy instrumental track, I believe a first for the band, which is sort of a cross between oldschool \"Roots\" style Sepultura and Dream Theater. Then more orchestra at the beginning of 'Sworn Oath'. Then 'Vandals Nest' starts with really fast and pumping double bass, probably one of my favorite songs, except the middle has some clean vocals that I really do not dig. You get the idea, a lot of variety here. I applaud the band for trying something a little different, trying to push themselves into some new territory, I can't say it always works, but it does more often than not, so I'm still giving this a thumbs up. Not a classic, but worth taking a good listen.\n\nQuadra (2020) Probably the best Sepultura album in recent memory. They had a great run with their 2 concept albums many years back (\"Dante XXI\" and \"A-Lex\"), then did 3 decent albums, but this one just has the right energy and sound, a nice mix between \"Arise\" and \"Chaos AD\". The album opener 'Isolation' is just pure high speed thrash, they even get a nice blast beat in there. It's an excellent opener, it just screams to the listener \"Ya, we're old, but we can still play really fast\". Then track 2 'Means To An End' has a great 'Territory' vibe to the drums and riffing it without in any way being a copy. Also love the instrumental 'The Pentagram', which gives the band a chance to show off their stuff without the vocal focus. This album also brings back in a little more of the traditional Brazilian music vibe which has been a bit de-emphasized in the last few albums. It's not really as big as say \"Roots\", but still more prominent. Some of the choir vocals appear again, but feel more integrated into the music. Lots of intros to give signposts throughout the album. It loses a bit of steam by the end, but overall, great riffs, lots of energy and groove, if you've been so-so on the band for the last decade, it may be time to give them another listen.\n\nSERPENTINE DOMINION:\n\nSerpentine Dominion (2016) Supergroup with George \"Corpsegrinder\" Fisher from Cannibal Corpse on vocals, Shannon Lucas from Black Dahlia Murder on drums and Adam Dutkiewicz from Killswitch Engage on guitar/bass. The result is the best Cannibal Corpse record in a long time :) It's not just that George is singing, a lot of the riffs on this album are very Cannibal Corpse like in nature, most from the \"Kill\" era. But there are a few differences. Drumwise, imagine a more triggered and faster Paul, the drumwork on this album really is blazing fast in spots, and pounding everywhere else. And second, there are tiny bits that involve clean singing and melodic riffs. I don't mean a few verses of clean singing, nothing sucky like that, more like the odd line here or there. The melodic bits are like spice in a very fast and heavy soup, they add flavor but don't interfere with the core taste of the band which is absolutely brutal death metal. The album starts and closes with melodic songs that remind me of intros to old Metallica albums, but everything in between in really heavy. Impressive collaboration, this is the must buy for the month.\n\n7TH CHILD:\n\nButchery Of The Innocent (1998, Demo) More grindcore/death with all the usual elements (low vocals, blasting, double kicks). The production is fuzzy (it's tough to tell what notes the guitar hits frequently, and sometimes the drums congeal into a giant mass), but I have to admit, the recording level is really high which adds to the ferocity of the band. These guys certainly know how to play their instruments, maybe just a little more time to work on better riffs, tightness and production is needed to catch my attention. To contact 7th Child write to 7th Child, Flat 4, 6 Summerhill Road, Dartford, Kent, DA1 2LP, United Kingdom.\n\nBled To Death (2000, EP) Well, I said in my last review that they needed to spend more time on tightness and good song structures (and catchy riffs), and apparently they did. This short but intense 4 song EP is a good slab of low guttural death. Super low gargly vocals, some memorable riffs, they manage to groove a bit more without sounding wimpy, the mix is good too. Fast drumming, and while the guitars are still a tiny bit messy here and there, you can definitely hear what they're playing now. The band keeps that slightly out-of-control feel, as opposed to razor sharp precision, which works for this kind of music. If you're into the likes of Cannibal Corpse, Gorguts or Iniquity, you'll certainly like this as well. Will be interested in seeing how they hold up when they finally release their first full length album.\n\n7TH NEMESIS:\n\nPromotional CD (2002) 3 song promo. Highly blasting death metal, but still musical enough to have songs you can follow (vs the random riff syndrome of say someone like Disgorge or Decrepit Birth). If I had to draw comparisons, I'd probably say something like Soulreaper, Brutus, or the more intense parts of Nile without the egyptian influence. Vocalwise, a mix of styles from lower gargles to higher pitched stuff that sound a bit like Carcass. Lots and lots of impressive riffs, this is probably one of the best promos I've ever heard, it goes for the throat and stops just a moment before you choke. This whole Promo is available for download in mp3 form from the band's site, so go to it.\n\nChronicles of a Sickness (2003, Split) 4 tracks from the band. This time, just about all the vocals sound like Carcass, but thankfully the rest of the band sounds more like Divine Empire, Dying Fetus or Malevolent Creation. This mixture allows the band to escape from the Carcass clone band competition dominated by Impaled, Exhumed, etc. The first 3 songs are intense blast fests with a number of really good stand out riffs. Track 4 is far more sonically complex, it starts with a spooky acoustic vibe, goes into a sort of flamingo thing (while evil vocals are whispered overtop) and switches over at about the 3 minute mark into something highly distorted and angry. I miss the variety to the vocals, but we'll see where the band decides to go when they get their chance to record their first full length album.\n\nViolentia Imperatrix Mundi (2006) Debut for the french thrash / death metal band. Sometimes when you have several prominent demos, a band's debut can be a little anti-climatic. Afterall, you've already heard a lot of the material, and you already have a few releases to compare it to. While the songs on \"Violentia Imperatrix Mundi\" don't suffer from this comparison, the production unfortunately does. Their original Promo CD just had more body to the sound. A great example is the song 'Omega Dei'. On the promo the trill part at the beginning sounds like an army of buzzing bees. On their debut there's just too much treble, not enough bass, and very few overdubs, making the trill sound somewhat weak. Thankfully when the guitars get down to the low palm muted stuff there's still some thickness there (like at the end of the song with the riff that progressively slows slows down), but I wish they would have recaptured that promo sound as opposed to what they have here. Songwise, some great material, and only a few duplicates from their earlier releases. As well as good songs, there's some neat keyboard / samples which lets the material stand out a bit from the crowd. The vocals also have some of that variety back. In general, weaker production, but certainly still decent enough to enjoy, some great songs. Well worth grabbing, but I hope with their follow-up they've worked out a few of the kinks.\n\nArchetype Of Natural Violence (2008) So this album is their debut album \"Violentia Imperatrix Mundi\" completely rerecorded from scratch. So it's the same songs, although there are plenty of tweaks like new intros, different bridges, different effects. The production on the album is louder and more in your face, but with a slight loss to the lower end and reverb the band had going on in the original recording. I can't really say which is \"better\", they're both great, just different from each other. If you can't find the original recording, get this one instead, this is a great album. If you have access to both, take a listen to the difference on their myspace page and see which sounds better to you.\n\nDeterministic Nonperiodic Flow (2012) New album after a a long hiatus. The band's usual combination of thrash and early death metal continues on this one. I'm not a big fan of the album opener (a 10 minute track that doesn't feel all that original), but then track 2 kicks in with a super fast hammer-on riff that's really great. And track 3 starts with a nice fast palm muted chunky riff. Really I think track 1 is the only track I'm not into, otherwise, there's some great music on here. Production wise, I still prefer the sound to \"Chronicles of Sickness\", but this album overall has a good mix as well, just different. If you love early 90s death metal, then I'd recommend picking this up.\n\nSEVERED REMAINS:\n\nA Display Of Those Defiled (2003, EP) Quite a surprise actually, I look at the back of the cd and see a group of what look like 15 years olds. Maybe 17, tops. And yet, the band seems to have skills beyond their years, both on their instruments and with some kickass memorable songs. How did kids this young learn how to write such good riffs? And why are they so angry? Oh wait, they live in Ohio. Ok, that explains it, seems like Ohio must be a sucky place to live considering how many furious death metal bands come from the area. Glad I've never lived there. Anywho, this band smashes you over the head with some serious firepower, imagine Suffocation on speed. In fact, that's just what happens on track 5 of this EP, their cover of Liege Of Inveracity is very good, slightly faster than the original, and this band really makes the song their own as opposed to trying to do the song the way Suffocation already did it. The first 4 tracks are original material and very good, lots of tremolo picking followed by slow sludgy riffs, and some serious good squawks. Imagine something like early Skinless or Malignancy, but with the speed of something like Deranged. Production is quite nice, there's some serious overdubs going on here to achieve that big ballsy wall of sound, perhaps slightly messy, but it doesn't bug me, it sounds like their style vs it being the fact they can't play cleanly. Vocals are super low, toilet bowl sort of stuff. These songs are pretty long too, like 7-8 min long. The album ends with 2 demo tracks, both of which have pretty bad production (the guitar is clear but the rest of the band is nonexistent in the mix). Anyways, an impressive first release, I can't wait for whatever comes next.\n\nSEVERED SAVIOR:\n\nServile Insurrection (2008) Technical death metal in the same general vein as Decrepit Birth, Spawn Of Possession and Suffocation. The thing that really separates these guys from being just another wanna-be is the excellent song writing. These songs are actually pretty catchy, so despite the complexity, there are several riffs per song that will stick in your head. And the production quality is excellent, really professional mix (better than the last 2 Suffocation records). Is this band doing something totally original? Not even close. But they bring some excellent songs to the table, and for that this CD is worth checking out.\n\nSEVERE TORTURE:\n\nBaptized... (1998, Demo)\n\nPray For Nothing (2000, EP)\n\nFeasting On Blood (2000) Similar to Cannibal Corpse's \"Tombs Of The Mutilated\", although possibly more energized, propelled forward by some very fast blasts and double bass. Again, while taking no points for originality, the songs here are memorable, and the music is solid and well played. For fans of the genre, this is definitely worth owning.\n\nLambs Of a God (2001, EP)\n\nButchery Of The Soul (2002, EP) A 6 song EP, the first track is from their \"Feasting on Blood\" album, then tracks 2 and 3 are the entire \"Pray For Nothing\" EP, 4 and 5 are the entire \"Lambs Of God\" EP, and the last track is a cover of a Cannibal Corpse song. There's also a video track. Overall the music is all good, varying production levels but all of them are clear. And this is a nice way to collect two hard to get EPs, so I'd say it's worth the cash.\n\nMisanthropic Carnage (2002) For people familiar with Iniquity's \"The Hidden Lore\" album, this cd has a lot in common, the low trills and tapping riffs, the squawks, the solid solid riffs that stick in your brain. Since I've compared Iniquity to Cannibal Corpse, one could also draw that parallel here (not to mention the censored album cover art brings to mind the \"Butchered at Birth\" artwork), although this album has a lot more fast blasting to it. Vocals are low (although not ungodly low) and gargled, with very little variation from phrase to phrase, much in the same style as Disavowed. The band may have trouble differentiating themselves from many of the other bands out there doing similar stuff, but overall I really like the songs, and think connoisseur's of the style will be pleased, so check it out.\n\nBlood Letting (2005, Live/Demo) This live / rare tracks album is divided into 3 parts, first is 9 live tracks from a show they did in 2004, then a Pestilence cover song, then the album finishes with a remaster of their \"Baptized...\" demo. First, the live material, pros: the songs are well performed, and the recording quality for such a small band is excellent, with a seriously good mix (obviously a soundboard recording). Cons: the crowd is pretty non-existent, and the songs are pretty much identical to the songs off the albums. But still, I was impressed with how professional sounding the recording was, and the songs are great, so it's still plenty of fun. The Pestilence cover is good. The demo is also good sounding for a demo, although it still certainly falls into the demo category. If you haven't been introduced to this band, I'd go for one of their albums over this recording, but if you're a fan of the band, I can see you enjoying this cd.\n\nFall of the Despised (2005) No real surprises here, another impressive set of songs from an impressive group. First off the production has the same general feel as \"Misanthropic\" but it sounds like a sock has been taken off the microphone revealing the real tone of the instruments, a definite step up. But to me the nicest thing on this cd are the riffs, they use some rather neat sounding chord progressions, but they're injected into a reasonably straight forward song framework, so it's not progressive enough to lose the people who just want to hear music in straight 4/4 time, but different sounding enough to avoid becoming run of the mill material. This album also has a few more slow songs (or slow parts to the songs), which work really well as contrast to the faster blasting stuff. Throw in a few odd sounding slow tunes like Morbid Angel, a few low trills like Cannibal Corpse, and you get a very satisfying death metal experience. Recommended!\n\nSworn Vengeance (2007) If you liked their last CD, you'll like this one as well. Same general feel, fast stuff, slow stuff, interesting riffs that aren't too complex, great production. Lots of great head banging material. A little too short if you ask me, with many of the songs under 3 minutes. A special edition of the CD comes with a Cro-Mags cover and an Entombed cover ('Eyemaster' off their \"Wolverine Blues\" album.) Overall I think I preferred the riffs off of \"Fall Of The Despised\", but this is a close second. Definitely enjoyable.\n\nSlaughtered (2010) Decent album, but not great. Overall, there's way more slower material on this than on one of their normal albums. I think they were trying to spice things up by going a little more melodic. But the riffs just aren't there. Most of the slower stuff sounds very much like material I've heard before, the band doesn't have the songwriting chops of say Morbid Angel or Immolation, who know how to make a slower song interesting by writing odd chord progressions, or just pummel you in the head with a thick chunky riff. There are a few decent song, including some fast material, but overall I have to give the album a very average score.\n\nFisting The Sockets (2022, EP) After a 12 year break, the band is back with a short 3 song EP. But damn is there a lot of intensity in these 3 songs! As well as faster brutal blasting and a powerful mix (probably the best sound the band has ever had), the riffs are all top notch, right up there with the band's best material. An awesome reintroduction to the band, may this be the beginning of an awesome comeback!\n\nTorn From The Jaws Of Death (2024) If you liked their EP from a few years ago, you're gonna love this new release. Almost identical production, and fantastic songs. A great mix or fast stuff and slower stuff. It's got technicality without being overly technical. Really tight performance. This is right up there with the best work the band has ever offered.\n\nSHADOWS FALL:\n\nThe Art Of Balance (2002) Old school thrash in the style of early Anthrax or Invocator with just a touch of Arch Enemy / In Flames. Vocal wise, the singer has three modes, death metal low growl (which he used infrequently), hardcore screams (half the time), and then sung vocals which sound almost identical to Belladonna from Anthrax (especially when he does the multiple voice singing). Guitar wise, it's riffs upon riffs upon riffs, I mean, that's what thrash is all about right? And the riffs are good, plenty of memorable songs here, especially 'Thoughts Without Words' and 'Destroyer Of Senses'. Again, think anthrax for the general style of the chunky stuff, and then they use the two-guitars harmonizing fills that folk like Arch Enemy are known for. Productionwise, everything is clear, although the guitars are ever so slightly muffled. Overall, a kick ass album if you're getting a little burned out on death metal and want a good injection of catchy thrash guitar.\n\nThe War Within (2004) Similar to their last album, although the guitars have a little more thickness to them this time (more overdubs maybe?) They're still a little muffled, and the extra power does add a little more noisiness to the songs overall, but not in a bad way really, it gives everything a more intense vibe. As for last album's comparison to Anthrax, whereas the vocalist still sounds like Belladonna, the guitarwork is much closer to early In Flames this time (the heavy In Flames, not the newer slightly lighter stuff). While there are a few acoustic guitar breaks on this album, the heavy riffs are definitely the focus, and provides plenty of opportunities to mosh. Basically a slightly louder, more produced version of the \"Art Of Balance\" with again, some good memorable songs. A Digipak version contains a bonus DVD with 2 bootleg live performances (both horribly recorded), 1 more official live recording (contains footage from many shows and extra stuff, so it's more like a music video really), 2 guitar lessons and a drum lesson, all of which are really good if you're a musician, since they play the songs at speed and then slowed down so you can really see what they're playing. Highly Recommended.\n\nFallout From The War (2006, Rare) First off, I really hate how this CD is being marketed. It's been hailed as the \"New Shadows Fall\" CD, but it's really not. It's 6 songs made from riffs that were never completed during the \"The War Within\" album, 2 re-recorded old Shadows Fall songs and 3 cover songs. Now I know the band is leaving Century Media and so I can see the label now: \"Oh shit, the band is leaving, lets say that this is a new cd so that we can generate more interest before they go\". But I'm gonna review it for what it is, basically a b-sides album, and in that respect it's excellent. The first six songs are good, although you can definitely hear where some of the new songs came from. Like a riff in the middle of the song 'In Effigy' is almost identical to a riff from 'The Light That Blinds', or the bridges from 'This Is My Own' and 'Act Of Contrition' are almost the same, that sort of stuff. But with that caveat, these songs are strong, just missing that final level of song writing polish. Tons of great doublebass work from Jason, and some nice guitar riffs. The old songs are good as well (never heard the originals, but these are apparently slightly reworked). I've also never heard the 3 songs they cover before, so I can't compare them to the originals, but it's neat to see some more obscure songs covered, and they're fun to listen to. This cd is worth buying but just don't judge it as a new album.\n\nThreads of Life (2007) I was a little worried about this album after I heard the new single 'Redemption'. The songs is once of the most derivative song I have ever heard. The opening riff, the verse riff, the chorus, every single riff, chord progression and vocal harmony was identical to songs off the band's other albums. It was like listening to a medley. But I've seen that pattern before, one badly picked single can ruin an otherwise decent album. Unfortunately, in this case, the single WAS a good indication of the rest of the album. \"Threads Of Life\" just misses that umph, the songs are all sort of hohum, nothing too fast, too heavy, too angry. It just lacks energy. There are a few decent songs, I sort of like the light songs like 'Another Hero Lost' and 'The Great Collapse', I just wish they were being offset by some super heavy material. There are a few good riffs, and fans of the band will probably enjoy this CD, but there's just nothing here to get me excited, no moment of incredible brutality, no super complex drum riff, no super moshable guitar riff. Average album, I like \"War Within\" and \"Art Of Balance\" way more.\n\nRetribution (2009) After a very ho-hum last album, their new one was going to be a try before I buy. Thankfully the band put the entire album streaming on their myspace, so I got a chance to listen before putting down any hard earned cash. The result is a much better album. Maybe not quite 'Art Of Balance' Or 'War Within', but in the same general space. A much better mix of fast songs, chugging songs, a few more melodic songs, but those are offset nicely with the thrashier stuff. Some great guitar solos, great drumming, lots of moshable bits, and the songs don't sound as derivative (although they certainly don't sway far from the band's trademark sound). If their last major label album was 10 steps back, this is about 7 or 8 steps forward again. Glad the band is off the major label, they don't need it, they just need to keep writing good songs like these.\n\nFire From The Sky (2012) The band continues its climb out of the hole they dug themselves into 2 albums ago. \"Fire From The Sky\" has the energy, the anger, and the speed to put it firmly back into the thrash category. Yes, there are still sung parts, but they somehow seem more appropriate to the songs, as opposed to being forced in to give the band some sort of generic appeal to a mass audience. Even a few death metal vocals, like in the title track. Lots of guitar shredding on this album, from the solos to the dual guitar harmony bits. The songs retain the Shadows Fall sound, but go in just enough of a new direction to avoid the sameness that has plagued their last few albums. Mix wise, this one is a little less bottom heavy with a little more guitar highend, but not in a bad way. Still not as good as their first 2 albums, but their best since.\n\nSHAPE OF DESPAIR:\n\nAngels Of Distress(2002) You're feelin blue, no light at the end of the tunnel. Yes, it's time for some doom! Track 1 is a 6 minute dirge that has the usual goodness, symphonic keyboards, slow 20 bpm drums, multilayered guitars holding single notes for abnormally long times, and highly distorted vocals add a nice touch. Track 2 is more symphonic in nature, a little too melodic for my liking, tracks 3 and 4 seem to have the same theme, and track 5 is mostly keyboards. I definitely like track 1 a lot, but the other stuff is more ambient and didn't hold my interest too well. Perhaps slightly too keyboard dependent, if the band placed a little more emphasis on the guitars in the later tracks of the cd, I'd have to give it a higher score.\n\nSHATTERED SKIES:\n\nThe World We Used to Know (2015) Awesome debut album from the band. Same general style as before, a somewhat heavier Dream Theater / Darkwater. The thing I love is how catchy and fresh the songs are. The group knows how to take odd chord progressions and adapt them to the prog / rock format. Like their song 'Elegance & Grace' uses this very rare chord progression I've only heard twice before, once in Steve Vai's 'Boston Rain Melody' and once in Joe Satriani's 'Time', but then uses it in a power ballad context. Or the chorus in 'Flipside' that has a certain *Frost flare to it. Lots and lots of great riffs, too many to mention. The bottom line is if you like progressive metal, this is top notch material, and a must buy.\n\nAuxilium // Vol I (2017, EP) The first 5 song EP of what I assume will be several parts. Generally the same style as their last album, very catchy / poppy songs with distorted guitars and djent style riffing. Its tough to tell, but I feel they may have a new vocalist. He sounds very similar to the last guy, so it's possible its the same guy just recorded differently, but this guy sounds more like he's in your room than with a lot of reverb and echo. In fact, it may be the same guy, because production wise everything sounds a tad thinner, so maybe its just a different recording style on the vocals as well. In general, their last album just sounded bigger, had more muscle. Song wise, the tunes on this one don't grab me as well as they did on their debut, they're good, but more strong b-side material I feel. The best song is probably 'The Reprisal', which is also the fastest song, which may have something to do with it (although it does sound very similar to a Megadeth song). Anyways, its a decent release, but not as good as \"World\", we'll see how the songs on Part 2 stack up.\n\nMuted Neon (2018) Second full length from the group. After their EP last year, the band said they felt that the set of EPs weren't really going in the direction they wanted, and so decided to scrap the idea and release a new full length instead. And the results are closer to their debut album, with a little extra heaviness compared to the EP, a little extra speed, but still plenty of catchy tunes. A few of the songs sound a little too similar to other songs on the album, so I still think their debut album is the better of the two, but there's still some high points like the instrumental 'Limbus' that leads into the big finishing song 'The First Circle'. A good solid release.\n\nSICKBOX:\n\nSickbox (2003) If you've heard some of Chimaira's demos, you'll know what to expect from this self produced / released album. The first riff is a perfect example of their style, thick detuned chugging guitars mixed with squawks, and midrange screamed vocals. Productionwise, this has plenty of bass, and a good crunchy sound, it's not 100%, but this is well done for a self financed album with only maybe 5% extra polish needed to be considered a totally professional release. The main standout thing on this album are the riffs, which are awesome, very angry with some odd time signatures and a whole ton of groove. The songs aren't quite as tightly written as they could be, and so it takes an extra few listens before this collection of awesome riffs really starts to gel into songs, and not just one long full album song. But that's the kind of thing that gets cleaned up as a band's songwriting matures over several albums. As a start for the band, this is a strong foundation to grow from. With the band's website apparently gone, I do hope the band hasn't broken up. This cd is very difficult to find, but if you're a Chimaira fan or just love groovy angry metal I'd highly recommend doing whatever's necessary to find a copy of this album for your collection.\n\nSIJJEEL:\n\nCyclopean Megaliths (2020, EP)\n\nSalvation Within Insanity (2022) High quality old-school 90s style death metal. Think early Gorguts or Deeds Of Flesh. So very riff based, with lots of fast picking, time signature changes, chromatic riffs and and a few dissonant / atonal riffs. The sound quality is slightly muffled, but really thick. Vocals are midrange growls. Drumming is fast and furious but adds some jazzy elements now and again to keep things interesting. If you enjoyed the first few Deeds Of Flesh albums a lot, I think you'll find plenty to love here. Overall a nice solid release.\n\nThe Concurrent Cycle (2023, EP) 2 Song EP, about 12 min of music in total. The same general style of their full length album, with riffs that sway a tiny bit more into the Immolation direction. The songs are a little slower, a little more atonal, and a little more chaotic, but still pack a pretty big punch. If you liked their debut, you'll dig these 2 songs.\n\nSINATE:\n\nBeyond Human (2005) Old school thrash in the vein of early Testament with death metal vocals. It's all very well done, but I'm sorry to say it doesn't really do it for me. The band is very proficient, and they do have a few of standout riffs, like the break-down in 'One Step Closer' that's both fresh sounding and highly moshable, but a lot of the material is pretty generic sounding thrash without anything to make it stand out from the stuff we've all heard before. Not much else to say, I'm sure this cd will find an audience, as I said, these guys are good musicians and obviously have a lot of intensity, but without a new twist on the old standards, it's just not going to grab me the same way in 2005 that it would have it it had been released in 1985.\n\nSINISTER:\n\nCross The Styx (1992) Pretty similar to their later albums, in all respects (that's good, they're consistent as well as a great overall band), although the production is ever so slightly noisier and not as skillfully EQed, but still professionally done.\n\nDiabolical Summoning (1993) Another great album. The production is quite clear, and has plenty of treble and low end. Lots of blast beats, double kicks, alternate picking, tremolo picking, and growling. Great song writing with lots of memorable riffs. Nothing super original, however, it has just the right combination of elements to make this album a fine example of death metal done exactly the way it should be.\n\nHate (1995) A little touch of black metal mixed with death metal. Nothing terribly new or inventive, but it's well worth a listen. Very technical stuff, and performed with a lot of finesse (well, a death metal type of finesse anyway). Excellent musicianship, lots of aggression.\n\nBastard Saints (1996, EP) Five tracks in a similar vein to their last CD. Still brutal, but the tracks are a little too similar to various songs on \"Hate\". Still worth buying, the cover art alone is probably worth the price.\n\nAggressive Measures (1998) As the title states. Another excellent album from the masters of precision and aggression. The riffs are razor sharp, distorted, yet crystal clear, you can hear every note perfectly, it's almost inhuman the precise picking these guys have. Some of the best production I've ever heard, they really spent that extra time getting the perfect sound from all their instruments. The riffs are well thought out, and song writing is excellent. Great blastbeats and double kicks, the vocals are lower than before, but it works with the songs. It's short (about 30 minutes), but there's no fat here, everything is good, there are no bad songs or mediocre riffs. Very impressive, I really can't think of anything they could do to this album to make it better.\n\nCreative Killings (2001) Not quite as classic as their last album, but still a great addition to the sinister collection. All the usual elements are here, precise picking, clear blasts, great production. A lot of classic sinister riffs that stick in your head. Unfortunately, there are also a few filler songs that I just couldn't get into. But I wouldn't say they detract from the good songs, they just mean you're not going to have another perfect album like their last release. And my only other critique is the vocals, their new vocalist does a fine job with a mid-range growl, but her performance seems to be too hoarse and monotone, not enough contrast. There needs to be more highs, more lows, more variety of some kind, hopefully something that can be worked on for their next release. A few points off for the shortcomings, but still worth owning.\n\nSavage or Grace (2003) The first thing that hit me after putting this album on is \"what happened to the sound??\" What with such a razor sharp guitar tone on the band's previous albums, I was shocked when I heard this muffled guitar tone. Upon further investigation, looks like Bart the guitar player is gone, Aad is now the only remaining original member to the band. While that's not necessarily the reason the album is muffled, it does sound like probable cause. Now with Rachel's muffled vocals, and the muffled guitar tone, it just detracts so much from the performance that I have trouble deciding whether these songs are any good. Ya, I guess some of the songs are decent (although they have some pretty pointless guitar solos over them), but the sound is just so undefined and messy that I just don't want to listen to them. Sorry, I just can't get into this album, while I certainly won't write off the band, there's better spots to put your money right now.\n\nAfterburner (2006) A strong beginning, but runs out of steam a little too quickly. The album opens with a swift kick to the nuts, super fast guitars and blasting, and the old Sinister seems to be back. Not only is this closer to the band's older material in terms of the vocals (thanks to former Sinister drummer Aad, who sounds a lot like the band's pre-female vocalists), but also the guitartone is all crunchy again, think \"Aggressive Measures\" style. But the album falters a bit, especially in the middle, where they go for a slightly more melodic approach. Basically, when they pump out super fast and tight rhythms, they're great, but when they try and add guitar harmony and melody, it just sounds uninspired and out of place. Better than their last 2 albums, but still not nearly as consistent as their \"Hate\" or \"Aggressive Measures\" cds. Still worth checking out though, a few of these songs are great.\n\nProphecies Denied (2007, DVD) Live DVD with a 60 min performance from the band in 2006. First off, the lighting and camera work are top notch, absolutely professional, from the visual quality of the video down to the pacing of the camera switching. The sound is also excellent, with maybe just a bit too much reverb on the guitar, but it's very slight. My main issue with this DVD is the lack of old songs. Most of the songs are from their last few albums, which haven't been as strong in my opinion. When the band does do an old tune, like 'Enslave The Weak' or 'Cross The Styx', it's awesome. Especially when they end with 'To Mega Therion', talk about intense, if that track was an indication of all the songs in the concert, this would be one of the greatest death metal DVDs ever. But most of the DVD is the newer material, so it just doesn't strike me in the same way their older stuff does. Also, the band needs a bit more stage presence. It may just be that the stage was too big, but I wish the band would thrash around a bit more. Maybe it's just that two of the main guys are bald, so there isn't as much hair flying around :) The DVD also includes a 20min interview with the band, which is very detailed, and includes stories about pretty much every album they've done. And the band is brutally honest, admitting that some of their albums were a little weak, which is really difficult to admit, and I commend them for their honesty. They also have a dozen bootleg live tracks whose quality is generally good, again though, song choice, all the songs are the same songs that are part of the 60 min main show. If you're a fan of the band's earlier material, this may not be the best DVD for you, but if you like their newer material, then there's plenty to love here, it's a well produced well executed show.\n\nThe Silent Howling (2008)\n\nLegacy of Ashes (2010)\n\nThe Carnage Ending (2012)\n\nThe Post-Apocalyptic Servant (2014) I sort of lost track of the band a few years ago, too many lineup changes, too many stylistic changes, I just sorta got tired of it all. Then heard a track off their new album on the radio and decided to give the modern Sinister a listen. The result is something very un-Sinister like (the only remaining member of the original band is now the vocalist, who was the drummer is former versions of the group), gone are the super crunchy sharp guitars, the wildly blasting beats, the complex time signatures. What's replaced them is a larger, thicker, smoother sounding Sinister, a strong throw back to early 90s death metal. Good riffs, good hooks, overall a really strong album that I've enjoyed a lot. But I really can't say any of this sounds like the Sinister of \"Hate\" / \"Aggressive Measures\" era. That band was about razor sharp brutality. And this band, while still fast, just seems to have more finesse. Worth a buy, but they probably should have just reformed under a new name.\n\nSIX FEET UNDER:\n\nGraveyard Classics (2000) Tribute albums are certainly not a new thing, Slayer's done them, Napalm Death has two, but the thing I really like about this album is they pick some very unusual songs. Yes, they have the Venom cover, Exodus and Accept. But then they do a cover of ACDC's 'TNT' (they even have the mandatory aussie shouts in the background), 'Smoke On The Water', and the Hendrix classic 'Purple Haze'. There's just something both funny and brutal about hearing Chris Barnes in his usual monotone death metal growl shouting \"scuse me while I kiss the sky\"! It's nice to see a band give tribute to some of the \"lighter\" influences, remember, Hendrix was considered really heavy for his time. But his music was never as heavy as this! I went into this album expecting to be laughing the whole way through, and yes, there's that element of humor, but beyond that, this album is pretty decent just from an album perspective, a band taking the classics and successfully warping them into a different genre very successfully. It certainly brought a smile to my face.\n\nCommandment (2007) I have to admit I never really got into Six Feet Under. It wasn't that I didn't like them, I just never heard anything of theirs that got me excited enough to purchase one of their CDs. Well, a few tracks from this album crossed my desk and I decided to give \"Commandment\" a spin. The music is simple structurally, but very enjoyable. The band's got a more Obituary / Bloodbath vibe going on, songs that aren't too fast, but are heavy on groove. Also, the production is really nice, big and thick on the guitars and everything else nice and clean. And Chris Barnes on vocals is always fun, he has a good variety of odd and gargly sounding voices. This may not be much of a review since I don't know anything about what the band has done before this cd, so those of you who are diehard Six Feet Under fans are in a better position than me to judge. But I can certainly recommend picking this cd up if you always thought of giving the band a try, especially if you're a Obituary fan. It's nothing spectacular or revolutionary, but a good collection of heavy tunes.\n\nUndead (2012) New album from the band, very much in the group's standard style, slowish but highly groovy death metal. Plenty of excellent songs and riffs, I love the slow tapped riff in '18 Days', reminds me very much of early Cannibal Corpse. The album includes music by Chimaira guitarists Rob Arnold and Matt DeVries (the two later left the band), and you can certainly tell the influence in a few of the riffs. I've been critial of recent Chimaira albums, but it seems like the two kept their best riffs for this album. Fantastic cover artwork rounds out the package, highly recommended!\n\nSKELETAL REMAINS:\n\nBeyond The Flesh (2012)\n\nCondemned To Misery (2015)\n\nDevouring Mortality (2018)\n\nThe Entombment of Chaos (2020) So if you took the Morbid Angel album \"Convenant\" and the Cannibal Corpse album \"Vile\", mix em up, you'd have this album. So in broader terms, classic death metal with a great wall of guitar sound and intense performance. Plenty to like here, the riffs are strong and the band is tight. But as you can imagine from the very specific influences I mentioned earlier, the album comes off as a little derivative. Also, the songs do end up sound a little same as. Almost every song is in 6/8, and at about the same pace, so imagine a slightly slower version of Morbid Angel's song 'Rapture' again and again. It doesn't help the vocalist sounds a lot like a younger David Vincent. I do give them bonus points for doing a cover of Disincarnate's 'Stench of Paradise Burning', that was a great band and nice to see a more obscure cover. Generally, very enjoyable album, but wish they brought a little more variety to the table.\n\nFragments Of The Ageless (2024) A step up for the band. While the core of the album is still Morbid Angel and Cannibal Corpse, the riffs are more varied this time, more hooks that feel inventive, lots of great moshable bits. So many good songs. 'To Conquer The Devout' has a nice Aeon vibe to it, 'Relentless Appetite' has some great opening punches before spiraling into a nice fast pace double bass riff. And they even have an instrumental '...Evolution (The Rebirth)'. Gotta say ever since early Metallica I've loved ending or almost ending an album with a good heavy instrumental, and Skeletal provides a great entry into the genre that invokes visions of sand dunes and epic armies slaughtering each other. In general, their last album was good, but this one is great, well worth picking up.\n\nSKINLAB:\n\nBound, Gagged and Blindfolded (1997) Mixing shades of Machine Head, newer Testament, Tool and Alice In Chains, Skinlab is a step back towards a more classic metal style, and yet it still manages to be modern and brutal in it's approach. Fans of slow, plodding groove based metal will find lots to like, a few faster parts too, but that's not really the focus. Production is great, lots of bass, lots of clarity, guitar tones shift from heavily distorted to clean interludes. Vocals are usually yelled. The style does tend to get a little formulaic once in awhile, but overall, a good solid album.\n\nEyesore (1999, EP) See Nerve Damage Review.\n\nDisembody: The New Flesh (1999) Very similar to their 1st album, except the songs are possibly even more formulaic, very structured verse, chorus, verse chorus type stuff. They are also now sounding even more like Machine Head, but considering Machine Head's last album wasn't all that good, I've decided I won't complain. This band is doing what Machine Head should be doing, the softer more melodic parts of this album are NOT interfering with the songs keeping a high level of intensity all the way through. And again, some really nice riffs here that'll stick in your head. I said it last album, and I'll say it again, a good solid piece of metal.\n\nRevolting Room (2002) Again, running through my head again and again, this is the album that Machine Head should have released but didn't. Ok, I promise, no more Machine Head analogies in Skinlab reviews. As an album this thing kicks some serious ass, picking up where the last left off. After a great start with 'Slave The Way', probably the best song on the album, tracks 4 and 5 aren't very good, so I got worried, but then in track 6 the band strikes back with a killer clean piece (with a heavier chorus), and then back to speed for track 7. The rest of the album remains reasonable slow and plodding, it might have been a good idea to add a few more faster songs towards the end of the album, but it's just a small nit. So other than a slightly blip in the middle of the album, everything else is great, same style you've come to expect, simple song structures, but plenty of power, screaming, and riffs that will stick with you. The usual big, chunky bassy but clear production. Plenty to like if you're a fan of the band.\n\nNerve Damage (2004, Rare) 2 discs of rarities from the band. Disc 1 starts off with two new tracks, track 1 'Losing All' is ok but lacks intensity and is a little derivative of songs I've heard before. Track 2 is much much better, 'Beneath The Surface', which has an interesting main verse riff and some anger to it. Then there's a number of demos and alternate mixes from the band, all of which are pretty similar to the album versions, and as such really isn't all that exciting. There's one techno-remix of 'Slave The Way' which starts cool, but instead of going super heavy like some of the Fear Factory remixes, it gets sorta heavy, you figure it's about to get super heavy, and then all of a sudden ends unexpectedly. Then there's the \"Eyesore EP\" which is a few alternate versions of songs, a live track, and a cover of Brujeria's 'Pito Wilson'. Even though I prefer the Brujeria version, this version is good too, and is sung in english, so it's good if you ever wanted to know what they were really singing about (unless of course Skinlab changed the words). Disc 2 starts with some more demos, none of which are too noteworthy. Then 7 live tracks from San Francisco, which have decent production, but not great, the guitars and bass feel sort of far way. And there's very little crowd noise. In conclusion, I just don't know, maybe it's because I've been reviewing a lot of \"rare and live\" albums recently, but it seems like anybody these days can get a group of demos or different mixes and a few live tracks together and release an album without really considering whether this rare material is worth releasing. I know, no one is forcing me to buy this, but honestly, as far as my recommendations go, there's really not much on this cd that will persuade me to put it into my cd player again, so I'd have to say this is only for the superfans.\n\nSkinnedalive! (2008, Live) Decent live album, but overall I'd give it a miss. The song choices are good, the production quality is excellent. The main issue is that all the songs on this live album are identical or slightly worse than the stuff on their studio albums, and really doesn't give much in the way of something new. The format of the songs are the same as the album versions, the sound is almost identical, the only differences are errors like the flubbed double bass part in 'So Far From The Truth' or the missing background vocals from 'Slave The Way'. You get a little bit of banter from main man Steev, but that's not worth the cash. Hardcore fans will probably like this, but I'd wait for their new full length CD coming out later this year or buy their older studio albums if you're missing any of them.\n\nThe Scars Between Us (2009) First studio album from the band in almost 7 years, it's good, but not spectacular. It's got all the things you'd expect, slow sludgy songs, haunting vocals followed by angry snarls, a heavy thick guitar tone. And the songs are all good, I don't think there's a single bad song on the album. But there's also no spectacular songs on the album, at least nothing to stand up there with 'Slave The Way', 'So Far From The Truth' or 'When Pain Comes To Surface'. So overall, if you're a fan of the band, I think you'll enjoy this, but it's not as classic as their older albums.\n\nVenomous (2019) After another long hiatus, Skinlab returns to release a decent album, but it fails again to reach the heights of their earlier material. The biggest letdown is the riffs, they aren't terribly memorable, and they repeat a lot. The music is performed with strength and intensity, but the song writing just doesn't do it for me. I miss those old riffs like the intense double kick parts towards the end of 'So Far From The Truth' or the breakdown from 'Slave The Way'. The closest we get is the song 'Far From Grace', but it's not quite there. Worth checking out, but the album is just not grabbing my ear.\n\nSKINLESS:\n\nDemo 1994 (1994, Demo)\n\nProgression Towards Evil (1998) I had actually not given buying this album much thought since I had assumed it wouldn't be as good as \"Foreshadowing\". You know how it is, second album is really great, first album is good but not quite there yet. Well, I'm glad buying that band's DVD made me curious, because this album kicks some serious ass. It's actually very similar to \"Foreshadowing\" in style and production, and hell, you gotta love any band that uses soundclips from the farting preacher. But when it comes down to the actual songs and riffs, these guys aren't gimmicky, just really good material. And it was nice to hear Bob Beaulac on drums again, since I feel his drumming style is much more appropriate for the band than John Longstreth's was (don't get me wrong, John is a drum god, but their 3rd and most recent album is probably their weakest next to these two). Highly recommended.\n\nForeshadowing Our Demise (2000) Pretty standard death metal, with sickeningly heavy slow parts, some faster parts here and there, and a touch of groove to keep things interesting. Low gargly vocals, big thick guitar tone, this stuff sorta reminds me of Iniquity in style, maybe a touch of old Broken Hope, or Deranged from their \"High On Blood\" album. Not much else to say, the production is good (although ever so slightly bottom heavy), the songs are catchy, not much originality, but a good solid piece of cake.\n\nFrom Sacrifice To Survival (2003) While I'd never heard of the band before, one sure-fire way to get on my radar is get a shit hot drummer in for your album, John Longstreth from Origin sure as hell fits that bill. So I pick up their previous album \"Foreshadowing Our Demise\", and the new album comes a few days later. The first thing I was struck with in comparison with their previous album is how the production has flipped, being possibly a little top heavy this time (even though there's still some decent low end in there, so don't worry). Style wise, while their faster stuff is certainly a bunch faster (which was sort of assumed considering their new drummer), it's not all that different than before. Hence, this album has the same advantages and disadvantages as their last album, you have some good music, but nothing specifically to throw it into the must buy category. Fans of the band will enjoy this album certainly.\n\nSkinflick (2004, DVD) About 105 minutes of concert footage, interviews and behind the scenes stuff. The format of the DVD actually works pretty well, they show a live song, then go back for 2-4 minutes talking with the band, or showing them in the studio, or showing them doing weird shit. The behind the scenes snippets are short enough to not become boring while adding some spice to the concert footage. The first concert they show clips from was from their \"Foreshadowing Our Demise\" tour, and has excellent sound quality, everything is clear and powerful. I like the video quality they have too, the show comes off very professional (lots of cameras, good cutting) but has a little bit of a dirty feel to the picture which works well with the music. The second concert they pull footage from is from their \"From Sacrifice To Survival\" tour, and that quality isn't as good, the bass is way too loud, the guitar and vocals are soft, and the drumming is almost non existent in the mix, which really sucks. The rest of the DVD is a bunch of random live shows, one song each, some good sounding like Japan, some bad sounding like a few California shows. Plenty of strange humorous bits, like moshing with a tree or the \"suck the dildo for a free tshirt\" competition. And hell, you gotta love random groups of Japanese youth showing up in weird places singing Skinless tunes. I didn't hold much hope for this DVD when I bought it, but it actually ended up being really enjoyable, both from a music perspective to just pure entertainment. Definitely recommended.\n\nTrample the Weak, Hurdle the Dead (2006) Something old, something new. First the old. Their old drummer, Bob Beaulac is back. But damn did he speed up! I mean, on the upper part of the kit he's grooving along like he normally does, but his double kicks have gotten twice as fast! Did he just practice a whole lot in order to keep pace with John Longstreth? (who performed on their previous cd) Is it studio enhancement? Is he now cybernetic? No idea what the story is, but his doublebass is suddenly ridiculously fast, and somewhat mechanical sounding. In all honesty, for the songs, I feel he could have stayed his usual pace and everything would have been fine (yes, I am in fact admitting that a little less speed would be ok). But as it stands, he certainly gives the band an excellent foundation to stand on. Also new is vocalist Jason Keyser (brother of bassplayer Joe Keyser), although he sounds very similar to their previous vocalist, so from a vocal perspective nothing too new to report. Other than those changes, this is far closer to the style they set on \"Foreshadowing Our Demise\", which is fine by me (especially with the bass heavy production again). Some really nice songs, decent groove, plenty of anger, excellent production. All around a really kick ass album, a step up from their last album I'd say. I expect a lot of repeat listening on this one.\n\nOnly The Ruthless Remain (2015) After almost a decade, the band is back with a new offering. The result is good, but a little less catchy than their previous albums. For example, their last album had some great memorable riffs, and while all the material on this one is strong, it lacks the standout riffs that make any song instantly memorable (the best song on the album is problem the song 'Skinless', which has the most slamming parts of the album). The sound is nice and low and thick like their earliest albums. Of note, the bassdrum on this album is a little slower and has way less definition than on 'Trample\", so you get that low thud with almost no high end, causing it to sound a little mushy. They have the right attitude and a good sound on this one, hopefully this is just the beginning of some new albums and they ratchet up the song writing a tiny bit more on the next one.\n\nSavagery (2018) Kind of a big step back for the band. First, the songs are way simpler than before, with only a few riffs per song repeated frequently. Then the recording quality is pretty muffled, like an early 90s demo. Then, most of the songs are midpaced, there isn't nearly the speed that happened in previous albums. The result is something that's ok, but not really awe inspiring. Not sure what happened here, but not digging the way this is going. Hopefully they capture some of the intensity of previous albums in the future, but I find this one to be kind of \"meh\".\n\nSLAPDASH:\n\n240.25 \"Actual Reality\" (1996) Sort of a cross between COC and Meshuggah, these guys have some really great riffs, super powered chunky guitar sound, good song writing, strange time signatures, they have some serious groove going here. Actually, they sound a bit too much like Meshuggah and COC to be considered terribly original, but still a great album.\n\nSLAUGHTER TO PREVAIL:\n\nKostolom (2021) A solid mix of Slipknot, Rammstein and deathcore, the result is highly pleasing. Love the more industrial aspects to their music, really helps set them apart. Who needs an exact Slipknot clone? As well as some of the dissonant guitar aspects, the vocals are the most prominent example of the Slipknot influences, with spoken word bits, screams, shouts, a few sung bits, but mostly low growling. A couple deathcore breakdowns, but thankfully only a few. Vocals are in English and Russian, which helps sell the Rammstein vibe. Again, the more industrial songs are my favorite like the opener 'Bonebreaker' or 'Bratva'. Huge crushing guitar sound. A really successful blend, well worth a try.\n\nSLAYER:\n\nIf you don't know who these guys are, you must be very new to metal. Although I never really liked Slayer's sound, it's indisputable their impact on the thrash / speed metal genre, as well as the fact that they have written some of the most classic metal songs of all time.\n\nShow No Mercy (1983) This is where it all began. Even though Tom's high pitched shrieks and the bands clothing and eye makeup will scream glam, but there's something more here. An anger that metal of the day just didn't understand. Combining elements of punk and metal, Slayer started a revolution by being faster and more violent than any other band on the circuit, and this is the first bomb hit. Great songs, ok production (hey, it as '83, give them a break'), can you say classic? I knew you could.\n\nLive Undead (1983, EP) A nice little live EP with songs from their first two albums. The live sound is quite good, although I do own the remastered version, so that might explain the good production. The crowd sounds don't mix with the music very well though, as in it sounds like the crowd was recorded separately in another room and then mixed in with the music (sounds like a small crowd too, but the band wasn't as popular back then as they are now). Anyways, another good CD, if you own all the other Slayer albums, you might as well get this too.\n\nHaunting The Chapel (1984, EP) Nice little short EP, 'Chemical Warfare' and 'Captor Of Sin'. Fifteen minutes of blinding speed and pure aggression.\n\nHell Awaits (1985) While many of the songs on this album are unmemorable (remember, a bad song from Slayer is still pretty damn good compared to others), it starts off with 'Hell Awaits', and that alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nReign In Blood (1986) Any album that starts with 'Angel of Death' and ends with 'Raining Blood' by definition has to be good. The entire album is just unbridled speed, 30 minutes of non-stop go-for-the-throat playing. Who cares if there's no bottom end to their sound. A must have album.\n\nSouth Of Heaven (1988) More high quality metal. Great songs, great production, no surprises here just Slayer doing what Slayer does, and doing it well as usual.\n\nSeasons In The Abyss (1990) Probably the best Slayer album of all time. The production is very soft with little or no bass at all, but it's clear, and has some of the best Slayer songs ever. I mean, the album opens with 'War Ensemble'. Need a I say more?\n\nDecade Of Aggression (1993, Live) This album is probably a good introduction to the band, they play all their classic songs, and the recording quality for a live show is pretty clear. Slayer overdose!\n\nDivine Intervention (1994) The closest they've come to replicating Reign In Blood. This album is short, with lots of mids, fast double kicks, and lots of great riffs. There really is no innovation on this album, just good, solid, Slayer doing what they do best.\n\nUndisputed Attitude (1996) Various punk cover songs.\n\nDiabolus In Musica (1998) We were all afraid that the kings of metal had mellowed, but now that the album is finally out, I see my worries were totally unfounded. Has the band changed their style? Slightly, but there's no question that this is still Slayer, all the elements are there like fast double kicks, Tom's voice, and their trademark tremolo picking and harmonized riffs. The riffs still sound like Slayer, but everything got heavier and more powerful. And every once in awhile they pull off these really unslayer-like but heavy riffs that just make you turn you head and go \"wow!\". Who says old dogs can't learn new tricks. All around a great album which Slayer fans should love, and maybe some people who never cared for the band will find something to like as well. Listen carefully and listen often, it gets better each time I hear it.\n\nGod Hates Us All (2001) Well, the old Slayer is back. Although this new release does include some of the nu-metal influences that made the previous release a bit uneven in terms of song structure, this album streamlines, takes the best of older slayer and the new heavier riffs and combines them into a singular force. And fuck that force is pissed off. While the previous release was a lot heavier than normal slayer, this album is just more vicious. The screams are angrier (that's one of the first things I noticed, Tom just gives it all he's got on these vocals), and in general the songs are a lot faster. A few riffs here and there have complex doublekicks and chunkier-sounding guitars, but they flow with the usual tremolo picked hooks (the staple of Slayer's original style) much more smoothly. The faster stuff on the album reminds me a lot of \"Divine Intervention\" for some reason. In general, this is old slayer mixed with today's great production values mixed with 5% more groovier riffs mixed with angrier but classic style Araya vocals. The results are well worth the wait.\n\nWar At The Warfield (2003, DVD) Recorded in 2001, this is from the Band's God Hates Us All Tour. While there are many songs from that particular album on this DVD, I'm impressed with the variety we get, in the end, I don't think there's many classic Slayer songs missing from this show. First off, music wise, the sound quality is great. Only complaint would be they may have wished to mix the crowd in a little louder. Instead, during cuts we get complete silence, which is great for a studio recording, but not necessarily ideal for a live CD/DVD. Performance wise everything is very tight, Jeff and Kerry are just monsters, down-picking at the speed of light with both their heads banging like madmen. Tom's vocals are great, although he does avoid the high notes on a few songs, most notably 'War Ensemble' at the beginning, which got me worried, but then he screams just fine in 'New Faith', so I figured maybe he just needed to get warmed up, but then he avoided the high notes again on 'Seasons In The Abyss' later in the show. Ah well, other than those two songs, the vocals on every other songs are fantastic. This is one of Paul Bostoph's last live performances with the band on drums, and he does a good job with all the songs. Video production wise, the director does a good job jumping from camera to camera at exactly the right pace, a few clips are a little jittery, like they reduced the framerate from 30 fps to 10 (I always felt a director might be doing this effect specifically to mask the fact that the video doesn't synch with the music properly), but that effect either doesn't happen as often after the first few songs, or I got used to it, and it no longer bugged me. 19 songs, 90 minutes, no real extras, just simple and to the point, it's all about the music. It's nice to finally have a Slayer show on DVD, and it was worth the wait.\n\nThe Soundtrack To The Apocalypse (2003, Boxset) 5 Disc set covering best-of and rarities of the band. Disc 1 is all best-of, if you already have the albums (which you do, don't you?), you won't need this. Same for the first half of disc 2. The last 8 songs are rare stuff, such as Slayer's cover of 'In-a-godda-da-vida'. Also several soundtrack songs and unreleased bonus tracks from the japanese versions of \"Diabolus\" and \"God Hates Us All\". A lot of cool songs in here that could easily have been on the albums, probably the best material on this boxset. Disc 3 is a lot of early demos, recorded for example in Tom Araya's garage, live tracks that are slightly different from their studio counterpart, and just plain old live tracks of classic slayer tunes from various places and at various times. Sound quality is all over the map, from good quality to not so good. Next comes disc 4, the dvd, filled with live material. Unfortunately, just about all the live material is recorded pretty horribly. I know, a lot of it was from '83 long before the band had any money to record things properly, but regardless, I found myself skipping through a lot of the songs because they're badly videotaped and sound thin, far away or muffled. Just about the only decently recorded thing on the DVD is \"Bloodline\" live on ESPN with Dave Lombardo. Also a short interview with the band about \"Diabolus In Musica\". A special disc 5 (which is only available in the uber boxset, not the regular one) is a live show from California in 2002. The recording quality on this show is very good, not only is the band clear and well mixed with plenty of low and high end, but you can still hear a bit of the crowd during the show, which I'm always a fan of (it is a live show afterall, removing the crowd removes some of the excitement.) Definitely a good set with most of my favorite tunes like \"War Ensemble\", \"Raining Blood\" and \"Angel Of Death\", and a new song or two like \"God Hates Us All\". Only critic of the live show is if you have their \"Decade Of Aggression\" live album, you already have many of these songs live. Anyways, to sum up, if they released the 5th live cd and the 8 rare tracks off disc 2 as a separate deal, I'd say this is a must buy, but considering the price of this boxset, and the quality of a lot of the material (and the inclusion of a lot of stuff you should already own), I'm not sure, I'd probably only recommend this for the diehard fan.\n\nReign in Blood Live: Still Reigning (2004, DVD) Coming only a year after the band's official live DVD, I kind of questioned the idea of releasing another live Slayer concert, even with a concert as cool as this one where the band pulls a Dream Theater and plays one of their classic albums from start to finish, in this case, probably their most classic album, \"Reign In Blood\". In the end though, I'd actually recommend picking this DVD up, and waiting awhile on \"War At The Warfield\" if you haven't already gotten it, since I think this DVD is far superior. First off, Dave's back on drums, which is always cool. Next, the main concert is only 30 minutes, which is perfect since it's fast, to the point, and intense. The DVD also contains another 30 minutes of other songs, for those of you that feel that \"Reign In Blood\" simply isn't enough. And a 15 minute documentary, w"
