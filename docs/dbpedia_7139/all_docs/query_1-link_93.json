        "text": "Portland trio, Coffin Apartment, released one of the best debut albums of the last few years in 2020 but might also be one of the strangest propositions in the extreme metal underground. Imagine hardcore legends, Deadguy, jamming with Voivod and Nasum in an audition for a support slot with Converge. The music is loud and heavy and coated in psychopathic aggression, yet the band furnish their art with progressive elements and unpredictable tempo resets that veer into the psychedelic.\n\nIn our original review, we praised Full Torso Apparition as ‘a fascinating listen that redefines the congruity of what is possible in extreme music. This is a blistering debut from a band that thrives on miscegenating the harshest sounds of metal and hardcore.’ Indeed, the variety of influences on this record reads like an amalgamation of the best bands on the Terrorizer Top 100 Most Important Albums of the 90s list at the turn of the century.\n\nAs a cult band of which we know very little, it made sense for Scream Blast Repeat to speak to guitarist and screamer, Johnny Brooke, to find out more about the bizarre world of Coffin Apartment.\n\nThe underground metal scene knows the music of Coffin Apartment but nothing about the people behind it. You have no social media engagement and do not give your names anywhere. Can you tell us more about each member of the band?\n\nWe’re on Instagram! We’re trying! My name is Johnny, I play guitar and scream. I enjoy coffee and hate the tambourine. Justin, who plays the drums, is the guttural growler. He once karaoke’d Napalm Death’s ‘You Suffer’ eight times in a night. Brody plays bass and has the actual voice. He’s the one who deserves better than this.\n\nHow long were you jamming together as a three-piece before you started demoing the material for your debut self-titled EP in February 2019?\n\nI met Justin in the fall of 2017; he’d just moved down here from Seattle. He used to be in a two-piece band that I loved called Same-Sex Dictator, and he was looking for someone in Portland to play music with. My two-piece band, A Volcano, had also broken up, so I was stoked to get back to writing. Brody was the bassist in Toim and played guitar in Polst, and I knew he was a killer musician. By the time all three of us were playing regularly it was early 2018. So, we were playing for about a year before the first tape came out.\n\nScream Blast Repeat chose Full Torso Apparition as one of the top seven debut records of 2020. What has the reaction been like in wider hardcore and metal circles?\n\nYou’re making me blush! Such an honour! I’m personally overwhelmed by the amount of positive feedback. I’m surprised we’ve sold as many records as we have, especially around America and internationally. Our music isn’t easily describable, which makes it hard to market. We’ve gotten nothing but love from Portland, which doesn’t surprise me. Portland has always been a rad scene. I’m super happy with the feedback from everyone, and the support has been unreal.\n\nWhich artists and albums were you listening to when writing your latest record?\n\nI was listening to a lot of Discordance Axis’ The Inalienable Dreamless, Zeni Geva’s Desire for Agony, Cynic’s Focus and Immortal Bird’s Thrive on Neglect. Death, Voivod and Bolt Thrower were on heavy rotation as well. I listen to a laundry list of genres, but I think as far as influences on my actual guitar playing, these were the heavy hitters.\n\nWe must talk about the track, ‘Transient Exuberance’. In our review we said ‘This sounds like hardcore legends, Deadguy, jamming with Voivod… Yet nothing will prepare you for the weird tempo change and psychedelic haze of guitar effects imitating a pan flute.’ Can you give us more details about the instrumentation used at this point in the song?\n\nDeadguy and Voivod, haha, perfect! Well, I’ve always been in two-piece bands. As a guitarist in a two-piece, it’s important to fill out the low end, and in my case, I’ve always played a baritone guitar out of a Peavy bass amp with an octave pedal. All of those things transitioned over to this band. With a bassist behind me, I get to use that octave pedal in ways I couldn’t before, thus the flute-like effect. It’s a very recognisable break.\n\nThe listener will ask if this is hardcore, metal, prog or experimental. Avoiding the easy answer of saying all four, how would you describe Coffin Apartment’s music?\n\nLoud.\n\nIn our opinion, Coffin Apartment are ready made for Relapse Records. Which record label do you think would be the best fit for your art?\n\nHow flattering! Relapse has put out some of my favourite albums, so that would be a dream. I think Sentient Ruin is doing some cool stuff, we’d fit on their weirdo roster. I, Voidhanger is a cool label. 20 Buck Spin is a little more directive, but I have a lot of their catalogue as well. Profound Lore, also – I love what they’re doing.\n\nThe level of rage on Full Torso Apparition is psychopathic. What are you screaming about underneath the audio onslaught?\n\nAll of our lyrics are written separately before we combine them, so when you hear one of our voices it’s that person’s words. I tend to write in vague terms, inspired often by books, relationships, sometimes even conversations I hear others having. The ocean fascinates me, so I tend to use a lot of imagery. The idea of thirst is a theme. Justin’s lyrics are more pointed. They tend to be about the polarisation of mankind, socially and politically. Brody is our best lyricist by far. We should probably just have him write all the lyrics. One of my verses was actually something I wanted to say to a manager at a job I briefly had. I’m glad it got on the record instead.\n\nYou appear to drop the death metal and grindcore elements in the second half of your latest album in favour of a more Fugazi-type post-hardcore sound. You might disagree, but what are your thoughts on this observation?\n\nI think the b-side is heavy as shit! But you aren’t wrong in the Fugazi comparison – we are all fans. Brody sings on ‘Hyperphagic Blues’, and his voice is reminiscent of that style. We are all admirers of Slint and Rodan, and I’m personally a big fan of American Football-type emo, so sometimes it shines through.\n\nThe era when you could form a band with no back-up instruments is a thing of the past. How expensive is it to start a band these days in terms of buying and upgrading your instruments, investing in stage gear, purchasing recording equipment to demo your material, etc?\n\nThat’s an interesting question, and I think one that’s not really talked about enough. I’m going to preface this answer with the fact that I love playing music with my friends and I’ve gotten way more out of it than I could’ve imagined when I started. I’m not bitter, I promise! But it’s honestly insane that anyone would start playing music or continue to engage in stage performance in America knowing how much time and money it costs. I mean, the rehearsal space, the scheduling, the transportation, the equipment, not to mention recording, mixing, mastering, and physical copies of your music. Then there’s shipping costs, merch, gas, time off tour; the list could go on. That’s why I maintain the attitude that it is a complete and utter miracle when people get together and make music. It goes against every financial suggestion I’ve ever gotten. And to make music like ours!? Music that is difficult to sell and not easily accessible? A fucking miracle. I think it’s a testament to how much we love doing it, and how awesome the community in Portland is. But it’s also a big reason bands break up; it’s exhausting and expensive. People have kids and jobs, and they move on. And it’s not like the promise of making any real money is there. I think it you’re lucky, a label picks you up and you get the chance to play some cool shows in some cool places. But even then, people have to go back to their shitty jobs once a tour is over. And touring is ruthless! Physically and mentally draining. You’re crammed in a car with people who you may get along with in short bursts, but who knows what week two in the van will look like? Coffin Apartment practices in a room with six different drum sets, and I don’t even know how many bands are in there, but we make it work. There’s a Google calendar and everything.\n\nWhat is the best thing to emerge from the Covid-19 lockdown from your band’s perspective?\n\nPeople are buying more records!\n\nWhat plans do you have to take your next record even further into prog metal territory?\n\nThe new stuff we are writing has some of those elements. I’ve been recently influenced by Scandinavian bands like Virus, Ved Buens Ende and Demilich. There’s a Swedish band called Craft that has an album titled Fuck the Universe that has also had quite an impact on our new material. Shit, we have a song with an intro that sounds like Goblin (an Italian instrumental band that made horror movie soundtracks in the 70s). It’s all over the place.\n\nFinal question: Why do the members of Coffin Apartment prefer to be the hermits of underground metal rather than the ambitious face of its future?\n\nI’m not sure if we prefer it that way, but I do think there is something attractive in mystery. Gone are the days when the music can just speak for itself, and part of me is bummed about that. People wanna know everything. All the info is right at your fingertips. Gimme, gimme, gimme! That’s why I hope the physical format of music won’t ever go away. When you buy a record, you get a lyric sheet. See who recorded it, read the credits. It’s very personal, rather than the impersonal format of streaming. But regardless of our internet presence, all the members of Coffin Apartment have been embedded in local music communities for over a decade, some of us even longer. Supporting those communities and being at shows, keeping the scene alive, that’s where my heart has always been. The internet has a lot of facets, and some of them I would prefer not to engage in. If it means you might not know everything about us, so be it. I mean, if you google our band name at this point, we’re not a total mystery. But I would like to keep some of the allure alive.\n\n*** Coffin Apartment self-released Full Torso Apparition on 20 November 2020. You can read the original SBR review here."
