All the album art is cut under spoiler tags because some are not appropriate for the work place, so discression is advisable Most of it is just a list of what i feel are important grindcore albums spanning the genre and giving a vague insight of its history and its importance on the influence of modern extreme music (both punk and metal), so, enjoy:\n\nMega-Armageddon Death – A History of Grindcore and the Extreme\n\nA Music History lesson by destroy_musick​\n\nFor the past few years I have seen many people discuss “extreme music”. This is largely followed by the name of a death or black metal band. This saddens me as an entire genre of music has gone unnoticed and people take little notice. Most people who have listened to grindcore will be quick to dismiss it as noise or a waste of music, but the simple-minded (and the more willing as well) fail to recognise its valued importance for underground music. The purpose of this essay is to inform, educate and possibly spark a little interest in what has been one of the most extreme forms of music ever conceived by working class musicians. I will highlight, in my opinion, the genres key albums and its founding fathers. Please enjoy.\n\nPre-Grind Era: The Rise of D-Beat and Crust\n\nWhy? by Discharge (1981)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nBefore the famed rise of Scum by Napalm Death, the landmark release that made grindcore an underground phenomena, many punk bands had dabbled with the idea of making their music faster and, for a better word, indecipherable. One such band that pioneered this band with the help of the D-Beat (a special type of drum pattern) was Discharge. In 1981, the UK based quartet released their first 12” after a series of short-comings. The release (entitled Why?) has been considered by many crust-punk fans as a masterstroke and the source of their inspiration. Though arguably not as good as their first LP (Hear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing) its bleak nihilistic blasts of emotion was enough to rile up an entire movement of people. By 1981, punk in England was in its prime, but many punks were beginning to get fed up with acts like The Sex Pistols and The Clash being their voice of revolution and youth. Instead, many youths turned to Discharge as their voice, concerned with the dangers of nuclear war (a prime theme in the crust punk movement that followed)\n\nNo Sanctuary by Amebix (1983)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nFollowing the underground success of the d-beat/crust band Discharge, Amebix were quick to follow in their wake. Recordings of full early crust albums are rare (mainly because the average crust punk band had very little in the way of money to fund their music) and thus, most music was released as compilations by grindcore labels like Earache and Nuclear Blast many years after the bands themselves had departed. However, the odd gem can still be found, much like Amebix’s “No Sanctuary” ep. Notable for setting the trend of scratchy, distorted band logos, No Sanctuary, the mostly overlooked ep, had helped define crust-punk has a now solid movement. Its short blasts much in the vein of Discharge’s Why? were beginning to show grindcore’s early roots of short songs with definitive points and messages. In the coming years the punk movement would be introduced to a wave of crust/stenchcore acts which would shape the world of underground music to its roots.\n\nThe Only Good Punk…Is a Dead One by The Electro Hippies (1987)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nBefore Carcass there were The Electro Hippies. Though short-lived and not as popular or well received as Carcass, The Electro Hippies short tenure saw the release of a record that seemingly sealed up an entire movement’s history and lifestyle in one simple LP. Famous for being Jeff Walker’s first act, they were so much more and sadly vastly overlooked by grindcore fans. The crustpunk act were good, very good, so much they garnered the attention of grindcore enthusiast and musical DJ John Peel. This release (as with The Electro Hippies other release of Play Fast or Die!) helped start the trend of “micro-songs” which was adopted by grindcore’s early records. (The song Mega-Armageddon Death clocks in at 0.43seconds according to some listeners, actually beating Scum by Napalm Death)\n\nA Holocaust In Your Head! By Extreme Noise Terror (1988)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nWith crust punk beginning to take root in the UK, the US counterpart was beginning to take full hold with bands like Siege taking full hold and beginning to shape grindcore’s early roots, but before they would a new UK crust-punk act hit the scene that are regarded as one of the most important grindcore acts of all time. Extreme Noise Terror shaped the early-grindcore sound we know today with the help of The Electro Hippies. But unlike The Electro Hippies, Extreme Noise Terror endured and evolved, but before they joined the wave of grindcore acts they helped create came A Holocaust In Your Head. Considered the most important crust-punk record of all time, it helped be the staple of what would soon become grindcore. The LP labelled Extreme Noise Terror as one of grindcore’s most important founding fathers even when acts like Siege and Napalm Death were taking centre stage of the movement.\n\nEarly Grindcore: An Extreme History of Brutality and Noise\n\nDrop Dead by Siege (2006 compilation)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nCrust punk was now beginning to evolve into something a lot faster and even more indecipherable. But before it exploded onto the world in its full force came the band Siege. Known for their ferocity and influence in the world of grindcore (more significantly in its hardcore crossover variation of power-violence) Siege were a band to be reckoned with. Known for their violent shows and not conforming to the local straight edge movement, they became prolific as a hardcore act as well as a grindcore act, often performing with both.\n\nDisgrace to the Corpse of Sid by Sore Throat (1988)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nWith grindcore acts beginning to form slowly around the US and UK, one band appeared from within the UK scene that proved to be slightly ahead of their time. As well as helping form grindcore and establish its roots, Sore Throat also helped what would later be coined as noisecore (a blend of noise music and grindcore) which would later be pioneered by acts as Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Anal Cunt and (mixing it with other genres) Melt-Banana.\n\nScum by Napalm Death (1987)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nAfter a hearty amount of demos and EP’s as a not-so-well-known crust punk act, Birmingham’s Napalm Death were soon to put themselves firmly on the map of both of the punk world and metal world. By combining heavy metal with crust-punk, bands like Sore Throat and Siege helped spread the carnage of grindcore far, though regrettably not getting very far and suffering for it with short-lived tenures. However, it wasn’t until 1987’s mammoth release by Napalm Death did grindcore get attention. Made up of a series of recordings (and line-up changes), Scum marked a destructive and violent part of grindcore’s early days. The record, though hard to listen to even by some grindcore fans standards, is visceral, hard hitting and legendary. On a technical stand-point, many grindcore albums have been made that have improved on the style, but none have touched the cultural impact that Scum did.\n\nTheatric Symbolisation of Life by Agathocles (1992)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nWith grindcore now established as a movement in its own right and respected music journalists noting it as a serious musical movement, more and more grindcore acts have (and continue) to rise from the fray. Most notable for their scathing political views and visceral delivery in the form of short bursts of music a band known as Agathocles arose from its dust. Hard hitting and pounding, Theatric Symbolisation of Life is a masterstroke of grindcore at its finest and, in my opinion, one of the most overlooked grindcore albums of all time.\n\nHorror of the Zombies by Impetigo (1992)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nWith the fusion of heavy metal in grindcore, some bands chose to accentuate this connection. One such band was Impetigo. Being one of the first notable leaps towards the deathgrind sub-genre that would see acts like Suffocation emerge, Impetigo should be noted for helping its movement with this early record. Their second outing as an act, Horror of the Zombies is carnage filled fest much like other grindcore acts, though with ascension of heavy metal riffs was becoming apparent and this record would, as well as the band as a whole would later influence a gore filled sub-genre of grindcore that most associate it with.\n\nGoregrind: Grindcore’s Vile and Disgusting Cousin\n\nNecroticism: Descanting the Insalubrious by Carcass (1991)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nFrom the ashes of The Electro Hippies came Carcass. Possibly one of the most well-known goregrind acts to exist. Necroticism isn’t strictly a goregrind album in itself, but rather it was a blend of both gore and death, but the balance is so perfect that it deserves its place in this list. Necroticism is, in my opinion, Carcass’ greatest work and this album is home to my favourite gore/death song of all time, Corporal Jigsore Quandary. In understanding the world of goregrind, it is imperative you listen to this album because it only gets more depraved here on out.\n\nEffortless Regurgitation of Bright Red Blood by Regurgitate (1993)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nSweden’s Regurgitate has for a long time been overlooked by the average grind fan, though reasons for this escape me because they are by far one of the most talented goregrind acts to have graced the genre. Effortless Regurgitation… is a prime example of the “gorecover” that is often associated with goregrind (as well as its cousin, brutal death). Using the old “micro-song” formula, Regurgitate reached new heights of depravity to be sung in music that began to show signs of new form of music following in its wake. Taking command of this form of music would be Germany’s GUT.\n\nA Chapter of Accidents by Dead Infection (1995)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nThe recent(ish) reformed Dead Infection had, back in 1995 showed that could take the title “Gods of Gore” from Carcass single handily with this album, A Chapter of Accidents. The thing which may strike many odd with this album is that, even though lyrics were printed with the album artwork, no actual lyrics are grunted/sung. Everything is grunted and gargled randomly, with no real words uttered. This only went on to prove that goregrind was a genre not to be taken all too seriously. This aspect is lost on many onlookers who believe goregrind fans take everything their favourite bands say as gospel. Goregrind was, and always will be music to shock people.\n\nNoisecore: A Minimal Approach\n\nEveryone Should Be Killed by Anal Cunt (1994)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nKnown for their outrageous lyrics and over the top offensive humour, Anal Cunt (or simply AxCx) are quickly dismissed as a novelty act. The truth though is that AxCx opened the way to a new form of grindcore, now aptly named noisecore. As the name suggests, noisecore is noisey, vastly incoherent and every song is usually a “microsong”. In AxCx’s case, most of their songs are simply the song title screamed over a bit of feedback with a guitar playing one riff. It was a D.I.Y. punk ethic taken into overdrive. Everyone Should Be Killed was one of Seth Putnams better records, before the jokes became stale and the offence just became repetitive.\n\nNoise-a-Go-Go!! By Gore Beyond Necropsy (1998)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nJapan’s Gore Beyond Necropsy are famous for being one of the many bands that just don’t stop recording, and it’s a good thing they don’t because as noisecore goes, these guys are good. Having done split albums with Merzbrow, GUT and Disgorge to name a few, Gore Beyond Necropsy have always remained favourites at festivals for their eccentric stage shows and “fun time” atmosphere’s much like Birdflesh. Noise-A-Go-Go!! Is a compilation of their first recordings and is some fine noisecore at its very best, a key-album to say the very least.\n\nAltered States of America by Agoraphobic Nosebleed (2003)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nFormed with some members from AxCx, Agoraphobic Nosebleed were quick to establish themselves as a back to basics noisecore group, pushing its sound and speed to insane new lengths. They had employed the help of a drum machine to push the drumming to inhuman levels. Most songs on Altered States of America rarely reach beyond the minute mark, again marking a sign of microsongs in noisecore. The use of drum machines can be seen predominantly in a recent new form of grindcore known as cybergrind.\n\nDeathgrind: Death Metal but minus the solos\n\nNeed To Control by Brutal Truth (1994)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nNot to be confused with brutal-death, deathgrind is the fusion of death metal and grindcore in that it’s as fast as grindcore, but as technical as death metal. Brutal Truth are one of the key deathgrind bands to come out of this still fledgling style. Though Brutal Truth has since split up, Need to Control is a solid and shining offering of deathgrind. Not falling into the repetitive trap of gore-induced art work as is evident in now later grindcore acts, this album shines high. It’s sharp, fast and sounds brilliant to the ears and will always stand as one of the best albums the style has to offer.\n\nHuman Jerky by Cattle Decapitation (1999)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nAlthough Cattle Decapitation’s offerings have in my opinion been lacking, Human Jerky remains strong as one of deathgrinds finest moments. Sticking to their guns with the micro-song ethic that defined grindcore, Human Jerky is an oral massacre that sticks it’s attention to you hard and fast. As with Need To Control, it is one of the best deathgrind has to offer.\n\nPower Violence: Taking grind back to its roots\n\nComplete Discocrappy by Charles Bronson (2000)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nWith grindcore now firmly showing metal influences, many bands took grindcore back to its punk roots, specifically its hardcore punk side. One of these acts was the forever great Charles Bronson. Helping establish power-violence as the more “punk side” to grindcore, many purists refer to power-violence as “the true grind”, with many uptight crust punks only choosing to listen to power-violence acts. Regardless, Complete Discocrappy stands as an important album to have in understanding power-violence. It is a compilation of EVERYTHING Charles Bronson recorded and from beginning to end gives you an insight on power-violence fiery history.\n\nCrush Kill Destroy by Spazz (2000)\n\nSpoiler:\n\n​\n\nA collection of some of Spazz’s greater moments, Crush Kill Destroy, much like Complete Discocrappy serves as a catalogue for understanding power-violence. As power-violence was very strong to its punk roots, it’s very hard to find any professional recording from within the genre, with most compilations coming out after a bands demise. The same was true Spazz who weaved and waned in and out the highs and lows of power-violence before ultimately splitting up. Though Crush Kill Destroy stands as a testament to their energy (and subsequently, the energy of the power-violence movement)"
