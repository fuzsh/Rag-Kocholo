        "text": "Grindcore\n\nGrindcore, often shortened to grind, is a gathering of extremes: it draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive popular music genres availableâ€”noise, death metal, early industrial music and the faster varieties of punk rock (D-beat, crust, thrashcore). Though an unwelcoming style of music to most, grindcore's influence spread across the music world, most notably on power violence, avant-garde jazz, and the commercially successful industrial and nu metal genres.[citation needed] Grindcore is characterized by heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, extreme tempos, frequently accompanied by blast beats, songs often lasting no more than two minutes (some are seconds long), and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched screams, similar to those found in crust punk. Lyrical themes range from social and political issues (Napalm Death) to gore (Carcass) and humor (Anal Cunt)."
