        "text": "And did this happen to come in a head only version? If so, my Ampeg may have just become obsolete.\n\nEdit: found it, don't need it for that price\n\nYeah I just spotted one on reverb for about $550. They came a rack mount version or with a rat fur enclosure. Same for the Sunn 1200s (again, same amp as the 1200w class D hybrid) but these were apparently really prone to failure. Here lately I've been seeing fender versions go for anywhere from $450-550 depending on condition. There's a few people trying to sell them for more than that, but they aren't getting it.\n\nonly for cleans I'm pretty sure, Ron Varod says they used a Sunn Model T, a Hiwatt 100 and a Plexi for the dirt on Hubardo. I assume the other albums are similar\n\nThose were borrowed for the overdubs. Live, it's just twins. Coffins and PHOBOS are just the twin. This is a technicality though because those aren't their most metal albums\n\nIf you go that far then you could include every metal band that's ever used a Sunn reissue. The Model T reissue is basically the same circuit as the Pro Tube Evil Twin that came after it, so not even that much of a stretch. 300T went into the Bassman 300 too.\n\nFender amps are pretty universally thought of as a clean canvas to paint your tone with pedals.\n\nPick any distortion pedal that isn't the Metal Zone and you're probably good to go.\n\nI don't play much Metal these days but I love the sounds I'm getting from my Twin Reverb sim. Add some OD and it gets you a kind of SRV or early Punk Rock distortion (depending how hot the gain is). And if I need a little extra sustain, I'll switch to the Bassman sim.\n\nI use a Fender Twin for half of my rig and it sounds incredible. The open back adds a lot of space to your sound when paired with a closed back 4x12.\n\nTotally, open back cabs are super underrated IMO, especially as a compliment to a 4x12. I have a Mesa 3/4 back 2x12 cab which I think achieves a similar effect. Lets the cab breathe a little more and sounds a bit bigger in the room while still being punchy. Not *quite* as punchy as a fully closed back cab, but seems more balanced overall. I have been on the lookout for a Road King 3/4 back 4x12 too, but they can be hard to find. .-.\n\nThe Tweed Bassmans are what Marshall was trying to clone (with the valves he had available in the UK). Therefore, we all use Fender circuits, but the circuit is now in a different cabinet.\n\nEhhh kind of a slippery slope. Next you'll be saying that all electric instruments are theremins or Western Europeans all speak Latin\n\nEhhh kind of a slippery slope. Next you'll be saying that all electric instruments are theremins or Western Europeans all speak Latin\n\nNot really. The cranked Fender Bassman sound is the sound of rock. Marshall made it louder. Brian Setzer is a good example of what a cranked Bassman sounds like and it certainly has nothing to do with the latter Blackface models. Tweed amps (and their circuits) are the sound.\n\nNot really.

Aren't you surprised you could read it so easily?\"\n\nAnd in my high school Latin text, about halfway through they insert section that is written in Spanish without telling you it's not Latin (I think they also removed accent marks) and then on the next page is like \"Actually that was Spanish, not Latin!

Jim Marshall took Leo Fender's schematic and changed the tubes.\n\nI'll try to make this as easy as I can for you, because you insist on a weak analogy. Language took thousands of years to develop.
