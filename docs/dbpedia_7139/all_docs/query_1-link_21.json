In this lineup they recorded the first full lenght album “Pobjeda jenasa”, and the songs for split LP with Sod’n’dan.

Often regarded (and even dismissed) as a Discordance Axis worship, the influences behind Syntax’ sound were common to those of DA: video games, anime, and blast beats. More importantly, there was a thirst for something new, challenging, and expansive. After debuting with their 2009 demo, the band shifted gears with their 2012 demo and “Corridos Grind”(split 7’’ with Netherlands’ MATKA TERESA) towards a path distinctly their own.

Totally embittered but too stupid to bail out of grindcore for good, Christoph, Lachie and Zev dragged Fil from Rort into the mix, then burped out a demo tape before Fil had time to learn the songs properly.6 months and a bunch of shows later, Zev pulled another dick move and went AWOL.
