        "text": "“Quality will always trump originality, and bands like TrenchRot and Crypt Sermon embody that truism; the former released the great âletâs play Asphyx and Bolt Throwerâ-core monstrosity Necronomic Warfare last year, and the latter recently released an old-school doom album that met with high praises from Steel Druhm. What does this have to do with Unrest? Well, members of TrenchRot and Crypt Sermon (along with USBM band Woe) have decided to grace us with an album of Nasum worship.” Philadelphia may be in the midst of a multi-genre metal renaissance. Sound the Rocky theme and prepare for step running!\n\n“Last year, two EPs caught me totally off-guard. For a long time I just couldnât get on with any form of punk â despite my penchant for good grind â though in recent years my tastes have developed and Iâve been increasingly delving into the âcore end of things. But I was totally unprepared for how much I would enjoy Tide of Ironâs split with Grace (The Hard Work EP), and even more so Enablerâs Flies.” When we at AMG get surprised, we make sure you hear about it toot sweet."
