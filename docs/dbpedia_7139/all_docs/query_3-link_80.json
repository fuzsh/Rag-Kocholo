        "text": "Converge, Wear Your Wounds, etc. frontman Jacob Bannon checked in recently with ‘Mosh Talks With Beez‘ for Knotfest.com. In addition to discussing Umbra Vitae, the ‘Blood Moon‘ studio project and more, he also unveiled the existence of his new supergroup.\n\nIf you’re not familiar, ‘Blood Moon‘ originally came to be as a part of a series of live shows several years ago. Those performances saw Converge sonically expand their arsenal with the addition of Stephen Brodsky of Cave In, Mutoid Man, etc. fame along with Chelsea Wolfe and her guitarist Ben Chisholm. Speaking of their progress with the ‘Blood Moon‘ album, Bannon offered:\n\n“All I can really say is that we’re making some really powerful sounds together and we’re doing stuff that I don’t think that any of us independently have ever really done before. So what Blood Moon is evolving into with the seven of us is, I don’t know, something very powerful. It’s something really special. Right now all of us are working on it.\n\nWe were supposed to be working on it a little bit more and all be in the same place around this time but obviously the pandemic situation derailed those plans. So we’re all working on it to the best of our abilities now.”\n\nAs for the new supergroup, he worked with Shane Embury of Napalm Death, Dirk Verbeuren of Megadeth and Jesper Liveröd of Nasum fame. He commented of that:\n\n“Aside from the Umbra [Vitae] record I actually finished another album before the pandemic situation hit here in the States. We didn’t totally put that on ice, but it definitely delayed getting that out to the world…”\n\n“It’s something totally new for me, where Umbra is a band—a proper band—and Converge and Wear Your Wounds are proper bands, this is more of a project that might have some live elements at some point. But I wrote a album with Shane Embury from Napalm Death, Dirk from Megadeth who also used to play drums in Soilwork and Jesper from Nasum.\n\nAnd we recorded a 12-song album and we’re really excited about it. And we’re gonna get that out to the world, I don’t know, hopefully in the next few months, we’ll see what happens…”"
