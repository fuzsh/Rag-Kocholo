        "text": "AND HELL FOLLOWED WITH - Proprioception (www.earache.com)\n\nMindblowing, and not in a good way either. It remains mindblowing to me that people are still fooled by faux brutality. Take a 7 sting guitar, detune it as low as it can go before all sense of note definition is lost, alternate between tired tremolo and breakdown riffs, gurgle as low as you can, have an inconsequential bassline strictly out of necessity, conjure up the most fake drum tone imaginable (pick your poison: triggers, electric pads, or sample replacement), cut and paste ad nauseum in ProTools, slap on an “evil” looking cover, and sell to idiot kids looking to “fuck shit up” in the pit. Do I have that, right? Deathcore is indeed an abomination to extreme metal, and AND HELL FOLLOWED WITH are absolutely no exception. There is not one redeeming quality about this album. Everything about this record is simply tiring and painful to listen to. It is absolutely infuriating to me that someone might confuse this tripe with actual death metal. Real death metal is played with passion, intensity, power, and skill-all of which this band is 100% lacking in. This is an egregious cash grab, nothing more, nothing less. The promo sheet that accompanied my copy of this record has the audacity to use the word “progressive” when describing this band’s “music” (“angelic progressiveness” is the exact quote). Are. You. Fucking. Kidding. Me? This is the most idiotic, mindless, regressive bullshit I’ve ever had the pure misfortune of hearing! You could not pay me any amount of money to steal this awful garbage off of the shelf! It is an absolute travesty that this band will sell a shitload of records and get a ton of recognition, while bands like INCANTATION, THE CHASM (as an aside, there is an underlying irony in my mentioning THE CHASM that I should not have to explain), or hundreds of others-real, pure death metal bands playing real, pure death metal-will largely be ignored. If you truly love metal, then please do all that is possible to pretend that this record does not exist; eventually all the scene kids will move on from their brutality phase and onto the next hip thing, and real death metal will continue to thrive in the underground.\n\nANNIHILATOR- Annihilator (www.earache.com)\n\nAs long as I’ve been into metal, ANNHILATOR is a band that I’ve simply never got into, for whatever reason. I’ve heard their music described as anything from power metal, thrash metal, groove metal, and any other sort of “traditional” type of non-extreme metal. I am also somewhat aware of the band’s storied history, where guitarist/mainman Jeff Waters is the only constant member of a largely rotating lineup. I only bring this up because I am listening to this record with no real prior context of this legendary band. First off, let me just say “holy shit”! Jeff Waters is an undeniable madman on the guitar-both his leads are crisp and piercing and his rhythms are amongst the tightest, most controlled and focused in all of metal. The opening minute or so of “Coward” had me pumping my fist and air guitar-ing like I never had before. Listening to this record, I do not really hear much of a groove metal sound (thankfully), and the influence of power metal is minimal at best. This is just straight up thrash metal with some choice traditional heavy metal sections blended in. As each song passes, I am more and more astounded by Waters’ guitar prowess-but a guitar wank record this is not. Each riff, lead, and passage is purposeful in making each song the best it could possibly be. There’s a harmonized tapping lead guitar section 2:24 into “25 Seconds” that is just jaw dropping. The only thing that’s kind of holding this record back is Dave Padden’s vocal performance. True, the lyrics themselves are somewhat cheesy, I can deal with that, but his delivery comes across to me as a straight up Devin Townsend impression. I mean, from his cleans all the way down to his screaming, Padden truly does sound as if he’s channeling HevyDevy himself. A bit of a gripe, but not enough to denounce this record (the lame VAN HALEN comes closer), as the riffing and leads more than make up for it. I’m actually surprised by how much I dig this; makes me wonder what I’ve been missing out on. If you dig thrash or traditional metal played the right way, then by all means check this out.\n\nBONDED BY BLOOD - Exiled To Earth (www.earache.com)\n\nDespite their awful name (“dude! Let’s name our band Master Of Puppets, lolololololol!”), BONDED BY BLOOD’s brand of retro thrash doesn’t totally suck. It’s not exactly amazing either; it’s competent, but mediocre. As always with these retro thrash acts, the best aspect is the guitars-Alex Lee and Juan Juarez’s playing is what truly caries this band. And it’s not even their solos, as the solos tend to be very atypical thrash solos-lots of whammy, tapping, fast picking-it’s the strength of their riffs that truly propel this band. There’s a ton of choice riffing on this record (check out “Prototype: Death Machine” and “Genetic Encryption”). What absolutely kills this record for me is Jose “Aladdin” Barrales’ (seriously dude, Aladdin?) truly forced and contrived vocals. Again, going by the name, this band obviously carries a huge EXODUS influence, but Barrales’ laughable attempt of recapturing Paul Baloff’s raw, untrained, unhinged hellish throat is actually sad to listen to. It’s bad enough that these retro thrash bands are blatant in their ripping off of an established sound, but this is a whole new level-at least try to find your own voice. That, and the concept behind the lyrics to this record-a very archetypical us vs. them story about thwarting an alien race from world domination 600 years in the future (it sounds even more absurd when I type it out)-had me shaking my head in disbelief. I’ve always been lukewarm to the retro thrash movement, and BONDED BY BLOOD do absolutely nothing to persuade me to think otherwise. There are other bands doing this whole retro thrash thing much better (see EVILIE), but really, if I want Bonded By Blood, I’ll reach for the EXODUS classic before the namesake band.\n\nDECEPTION OF A GHOST - Speak Up, You’re Not Alone (www.bullettooth.com)\n\nWow, metalcore’s not dead yet? Could’ve fooled me. Anyways, what we have here is yet another very typical commercial metalcore band. Within two and a half minutes of opener “In Case You Forgot”, DECEPTION OF A GHOST burns through all of their tricks; lame pseudo-melodic death metal riffs, breakdowns, “brootal” death grunts, gang vocals, and a cleanly sung chorus sweeter than high fructose corn syrup. Now what do they do for the next 36 or so minutes? Repeat that two and half minute formula 15 and a half times and you end up with this 38 and a half minute record. Ooh, “I Once Knew A Man” has glockenspiel on it; big fucking deal. RUSH had glockenspiel on their records 20 or so years ago, and even then, they were not likely the first to do it. I simply do not know what to say about DECEPTION OF A GHOST that I haven’t said countless times before when talking about these stunted metalcore/deathcore bands; learn about metal’s history, cash grab, decent lead guitar playing, derivative songwriting, made solely for Hot Topic kids, etc, etc, etc. Take your pick; there is truly nothing new under the sun here. DECEPTION OF A GHOST is simply yet another in a long line of bands that are aping an extremely commercial scene in a soulless and passionless attempt to earn a living. Which, at base level, is fine-everyone’s got a right to earn a living. But please spare me of the attempts to legitimize what you’re doing and stop trying to pass yourselves off as artists with integrity. Just don’t do it. I’ve truly had it with these bands; I’m not even going to bother to try and point out any good aspects or name check any comparable bands (or any better bands to check out). It’s pointless; the fans of this type of feces seem to be content to wallow in it (until they latch onto something new and equally terrible to wallow in), and real metalheads will always shun this as an affront to the artform they love so very much. Such is life.\n\nENFORCER - Diamonds (www.earache.com)\n\nLook, I know what to expect with this record-straight up, old school 80’s styled heavy metal, almost to the point of parody. Equal parts NWOBHM (despite ENFORCER hailing from Sweden), Mercyful Fate (without the Satanic theme), and Judas Priest, Diamonds is a truly unoriginal and derivative record. But goddamnit, it’s a fun one when you suspend disbelief. There’s more than a good amount of excellent riffs, awesome twin leads, thunderous drumming, and catchy, anthemic choruses (courtesy of vocalist Olof “Enforcer” Wikstrand, who at one point was the band’s sole member). Hell, it even sounds like it was recorded in the 80’s. The first two tracks, “Midnight Vice” and “Roll The Dice” fly by with aggressive potency and “Katana” brings the MAIDEN worship (complete with Steve Harrris-esque basslines from Tobias Lindqvist; his bass playing throughout the record is a definite highlight). Instrumental title track “Diamonds” is another standout, as there are great riffs and bass playing aplenty. “Live For The Night” is a nice little thrasher with a short, but sweet solo trade off section. Sure, the lyrics and image are beyond cheesy. But try as I might, I cannot hate this-this is what those asshats in WHITE WIZZARD can only hope to aspire to be. Everyone who reads this column knows how I feel about retro movements. But this one is just too fun and authentic to bash. Again, don’t come here looking for innovation, come here looking for a slightly sleazy, headbanging good time.\n\nLAMB OF GOD - Hourglass (www.epicrecords.com)\n\nIt’s hard to believe that the band that was practically booed off the stage at the old Birch Hill when opening for THE HAUNTED, DIMMU BORGIR, and CANNIBAL CORPSE circa 2000 is one of the biggest names in metal ten years later. A little simplistic buffoonery and shallow heaviness goes a long way, huh? If you haven’t figured out by now, I’m no LAMB OF GOD fan. Never have been, never will be. These guys are right up there with PANTERA; the ultimate starter metal bands. But in 2000 I was well beyond my metal starter phase, and I’m certainly not regressing in 2010. Give the devil his due, Chris Adler is mindblowing on the kit and Mark Morton and Willie Adler on guitar are nothing to sneeze at either. But good musicians (and an absolutely terrible vocalist in Randy Blythe) don’t always make good music (and the inverse holds true more often than not). At any rate, Hourglass is a 15 year anniversary release, available in no less than 7 different configurations- 2 single CD versions (one early best of and one Epic records best of), 3 CD anthology (which includes both best of’s and a third disc of rarities), vinyl/USB box sets (including all of their studio albums including Burn The Priest, but curiously not the rarities disc), a deluxe set (including all mentioned plus a book) and a “super deluxe” set (which includes the deluxe set and, of all things, a Mark Morton signature series Jackson guitar in a custom Coffin Case-all yours for $1,000!). Normally I’d be screaming cash grab, but I do think these types of sets are awesome for hardcore fans. If I were a LAMB OF GOD fan with $1,000 to burn, I’d be all over that super deluxe set. Hell, if I were a LAMB OF GOD fan with $30 or so to burn I’d be all over that 3 CD set with the rarities disc (of which, Epic records has kindly provided me a copy to review). It’s that third disc, subtitled “The Vault”, which will have hardcore fans on a budget seeking this set out. 18 rare tracks spanning the entire length of LAMB OF GOD’s career including early demos, recent demos, as well as Japanese pressing bonus tracks, it’s this collection that will ultimately make this set worthwhile to LAMB OF GOD fans. The rest of the goodies are gravy, I suppose. Look, I’m not gonna trash LAMB OF GOD’s music (as much as I so desperately want to) as these sets are obviously made for LAMB OF GOD’s hardcore fan base and not to draw in more jaded metalheads such as myself (except for maybe the single disc best of compilations, which are likely geared toward more casual listeners). So if you partake in the “wall of death” every time LAMB OF GOD passes through your town, then you owe it to yourself to at the very least check out the 3CD set simply for the rare tracks disc. And if you’ve got money to burn, indulge in one of the swankier limited edition packages. As for me, I’m gonna put on the TRIPTYKON record and continue to live blissfully unaware of LAMB OF GOD’s existence.\n\nORDER OF ENNEAD - An Examination Of Being (www.earache.com)\n\nSo, here we have the second record from the once-side project of DEICIDE’S Steve Asheim alongside new DEICIDE guitarist Kevin Quirion (and also including members of COUNCIL OF THE FALEN). ORDER OF ENNEAD’s mildly technical, black metal tinged, old school death metal is a brutal breath of fresh air. Comparisons to DEICIDE are unquestionably inevitable; so let me get mine out of the way. Asheim’s “day job” is bordering on self-parody at this point (To Hell With God? Seriously?), and in listening to this record, one can really tell where Asheim’s passions lie as his drumming on this record in fiery, powerful, and invigorated, especially when compared to the by the numbers performance (by everyone involved) on Till Death Do Us Part. But this isn’t the Steve Asheim show, as ORDER OF ENNEAD has far more redeeming traits in addition to excellent drumming. John Li on lead guitar is simply beastly, as the neoclassical influenced soloing kicks the overall quality of this record up quite a few notches. Check out the solo roughly 1:20 into “…In The Mirror”-pure fretboard wizardry backed up by Asheim, Quirion, and bassist Scott Patrick trashing out on a beautifully old school riff. Quirion’s vocals are simply frothing over with venom, sporting a mostly higher ranged, black metal influenced rasp, with occasional touches of classic, lower pitched death growls. I’m glad I had a chance to hear this record, as I’ve always blown ORDER OF ENNEAD off as just another side project. I highly recommend this to any extreme metal fan, as this hangs with and occasionally surpasses (especially in the lead guitar department) the likes of BEHEMOTH, ANGELCORPSE and similar blackened death metal bands, all while carving out a distinct niche for themselves. Good stuff.\n\nDANZIG - Deth Red Sabaoth (www.theendrecords.com)\n\nWell, this caught me off guard. I was never the biggest DANZIG fan (preferring his work with THE MISFITS), and I very casually followed Glenn’s eponymous band up until Blackacidevil-the flirtations with industrial on that record was off putting to me at the time, and from there I kind of lost interest in this band. I was unaware DANZIG had retuned to a more traditional, dark, bluesy metal sound. The first thing that really struck me about this record is how damn good it sounds. Much was made in the bio accompanying the CD that this record was recorded in analog, and man, it shows. This record sounds like humans playing instruments, with a very warm and dark tone providing the right vibe and atmosphere. In particular, Johnny Kelly’s drums sound like they’re right there in the room with you; just a very natural, live tone. Now, there are a lot of records that are sonically amazing, but are creatively lacking - how does this record stack up against DANZIG’s previous works? This record is like a heavier, darker version of the first four records, and it feels like a logical successor to 1994’s 4p. Lead single “On A Wicked Night” is quintessential DANZIG; a sludgy, thick as molasses dirge with Glenn’s unmistakable, infectious howls hovering over. “Deth Red Moon” is yet another excellent and catchy tune, probably the closest thing to an upbeat rocker and should be the logical choice for the second single. Tommy Victor kind of shocked me here, as I’m used to his cold, calculated work in PRONG. Here, he lets loose with the proper bluesy swagger, perfectly in line with DANZIG’s back catalog. Ultimately, what we have here is DANZIG doing what DANZIG does best, and he/they sound amazing doing it. If you’re a fan of DANZIG’s early works, then you have no excuse to not pick this up, as it is as good as anything he’s/they’ve done in the past. Highly recommended. –Dan Siano\n\nGRAVE - Burial Ground (www.regainrecords.com)\n\nHoly shit. What the hell happened to GRAVE? Maybe it’s me; maybe I’ve been out of the loop. My last encounter with GRAVE was in 1996 and their album Hating Life. I actually hated that album with a passion at the time, as it was another case of a classic Swedish death metal band gone groove/death n’ roll (see ENTOMBED, DESULTORY, and even DISMEMBER albums from in and around the same time). I totally wrote GRAVE off then, and this is my first encounter with this band since then (despite being aware that they had become a reactivated band around 2002). I am totally blown away by the unbridled savagery on display here! Opener “Liberation” simply blasts through my speakers, grabbing my by the throat and caving my face in with repeated blows. This album is nothing more, absolutely nothing less than the finest in old school Swedish death metal (and I don’t mean that pussified Gothenburg melodeath nonsense that helped spawn metalcore), right up there with the recent DISMEMBER albums. This album totally sounds like it was recorded in 1992, even down to that legendary signature crushing as fuck guitar tone; everything about this record just screams “old school”. There’s really not much more that needs to be said here; this is old school death metal played the way it’s supposed to be played, made simply for old school metalheads. “Sexual Mutilation” is without a doubt an instant classic, and if this song doesn’t get you headbanging, then I call into question your metal credentials. If you’ve never dug old school Swedish death metal, chances are you aren’t gonna dig this. Either that or you’re one of these idiotically misguided kids who only care about “da breakdownz, dood!!!”, in which case, steer the fuck clear of this monstrosity of a record, cause it’s far too heavy for your feeble mind to comprehend. –Dan Siano\n\nGLOOMINOUS DOOM - The Feature (www.drprecords.com)\n\nThe first 30 seconds of this record is this reggae sort of vibe, and from there GLOOMINOUS DOOM busts out the thrash. That sentence alone should give you a clear indication that this is not your usual metal record. And that seems to be GLOOMINOUS DOOM’s m.o. - the juxtaposition of thrash with ska, reggae, prog, and whatever else they can muster up. Even then, that’s kind of selling short some of the more unique aspects of this record. The metal element (which is predominant) is firmly rooted in thrash, with plenty of unusual, progressive metal segments to keep things interesting (when they’re not busting out reggae or ska). Ironically, there’s really no doom to speak of (aside from “Lager Jam 87”, which is reminiscent of mid-period CATHEDRAL), but I digress. GLOOMINOUS DOOM is an unapologetically experimental and creative unit, and they don’t seem to be afraid to stick their necks out there to try something new. Witness “The Feature” which in the blink of an eye bounces between country, ska, and blasting death metal quite seamlessly before launching a full on thrash assault. Or check out “White Worms From Hell”, which GLOOMINOUS DOOM “kitchen sinks” it; psychedelic blues, ska, thrash, death metal, whistling-you name it, it’s likely here. Finally, here’s a band who’s not content to simply copy the templates laid out before them; the only drawback to this approach is that it’ll likely take a few listens for everything to fully sink in. This is a very bizarre and challenging record, but is extremely rewarding when it clicks with you. The only thing I personally didn’t care for is the humor element of some of the song titles (and assuming by extension, the lyrics, which I was not provided a lyric sheet). Having song titles such as “Portal Potty”, “Urine Trouble” and “Thrashphault” could make it somewhat difficult for casual listeners to take this record seriously. It’s really difficult for me to name drop bands to compare this to, cause I could easily recommend this to fans of ATHEIST or CYNIC, but that would not be accurate at all. GLOOMINOUS DOOM has carved out a niche for themselves that should have mass appeal to all open minded, forward thinking metalheads. If you don’t like to be challenged by your music, then avoid this like the plague. But if you have an appreciation for truly progressive metal, and not just wank for wank’s sake, I urge you to give this record a chance. –Dan Siano\n\nSETHERIAL-Ekpryosis (www.regainrecords.com)\n\nWow. This is not what I expected at all. SETHERIAL is a name I was familiar with, but their music always flew under my radar. I had a pre-conceived notion in my head of second-rate DARK FUNERAL worship, and had always written SETHERIAL off because of that. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The first few seconds of “A World In Hell” struck me with it’s unusual, somewhat progressive riffing. Then, I caught onto the production-an absolutely grimy, suffocating affair, perfectly capturing the intended vibe and atmosphere. SETHERIAL is firmly rooted in raw second wave black metal, yet they keep it interesting with segments of unusual, progressive riffing and drumming, as well as some subtle synth passages. I know when one thinks of synths in black metal, DIMMU BORGIR styled symphonic cheese is the first thing that usually comes to mind. There are some vague elements of that, but what I’m picking up on are the synths buried in the mix in “The Devouring Eye”, which are akin to a more prog rock type tone. But make no mistake; the bulk of this record is guitar driven, ugly as fuck black metal. 13 minute “The Mournful Sunset Of The Forsaken” might be the most epic song I’ve heard all year; just riff after riff of melodic, yet grim excellence. SETHERIAL isn’t out to reinvent the wheel; they hold true to the roots of the genre with brutal, yet melodic and atmospheric riffing, violent drumming, and the sickening vocals of Infaustus, while carefully and subtly experimenting with the aforementioned synths and somewhat prog-ish riffing. I was pleasantly surprised by this record after having the lowest of expectations, and this record easily gives something like the somewhat over-hyped (yet damn good) new WATAIN record a run for its money. If you dig traditional raw Scandinavian black metal, you cannot possibly go wrong with this record. –Dan Siano\n\nTRIUMFALL - Antithesis Of All Flesh (www.regainrecords.com)\n\nHere we have Serbian symphonic black metallers TRIUMFALL’s debut album, Antithesis Of All Flesh, released by Infernus’ Forces Of Satan Records, distributed worldwide by Regain. I point this out because without any prior knowledge of this band, one would assume they are something special if such a legendary black metal figure would sign them to his label for their debut album. Unfortunately, while solid, this record is nothing to necessarily write home about. TRIUMFALL almost lost me with “Atrium Mortis”, a 5-minute intro. Few bands can pull this type of thing off, and TRIUMFALL is sadly not one of those bands. When the first proper song, “One With The Darkside Eternal”, kicks in, I am bombarded with a bunch of good ideas, but no cohesive, memorable song. And that is the underlying issue with this record as a whole; there’s a ton of great playing and some excellent individual riffs (in an early DISSECTION or fittingly, GORGOROTH vein), but nothing comes together long enough to form truly great songs. What saves this record is the instrumental interplay-in particular, the guitar tandem of Vorzloth and Usud really is the high point and most interesting aspect of this record. These guys crank out some excellent riffage (in particular, check out the beginning of “Rise Of Pantheon”-the first three riffs are pretty choice). Again, it’s too bad the song structuring is lacking. Additionally, the production is a bit too clean for this genre, robbing the music of its much-needed atmosphere. The guitars in particular, are lacking bite and aggression, instead opting for a somewhat mellow tone, leaving the keys of Phantom to try and carry the bulk of the atmosphere. Bad move, as the keys are the least interesting aspect of this record, relying on the been there done that, cheesy as all hell string/choir/piano sounds. Vocalist Atterigner has a powerful and venomous rasp, but I have to knock off points for those embarrassingly bad clean vocals in “Within Their Midnight”. Ultimately, this record is merely mediocre, when there’s enough good playing and riffs for it to have been a standout. To their credit, TRIUMFALL has high potential to make something great, and I do expect them to make a better second record. I cautiously recommend this record to those who dig symphonic black metal, as this record will go down as the underwhelming debut of a potentially soon to be great band. –Dan Siano\n\nWORMROT - Abuse (www.earache.com)\n\nTotal awesomeness. Singaporean grind fiends WORMOT throw down in the most vicious, violent way imaginable. This is no-bones, no-frills, 80’s grind worship and the intensity does not let up for one second of the 23 song, 22 minute run time. Bolstered by a thick as fuck, yet perfectly crusty production, this record is crushing in every possible way. The only truly questionable moment is the pseudo-rapped vocals in the beginning of “Good Times”, and even still, it seems to be more of a mockery than anything else. Oh, and they tear through a barely recognizable grind version of the Yeah Yeah Yeah’s “Rich”. That’s right, a grind version of a YYY’s tune. As a YYY’s fan, I got a chuckle out of it, but not much else aside from the absurd novelty. Regardless, the original tunes more than make up for it, and I would highly, highly recommend this excellent record to any fan of NASUM, NAPALM DEATH, INSECT WARFARE, and the like. There’s a 2-disc version that comes with 34 bonus tracks witch I’m going to immediately seek out; I’d suggest you’d do the same. –Dan Siano\n\nEVILE - Infected Nations (www.earache.com)\n\nAnybody who knows me, or even reads this column, knows that I’m not big on “fad” metal genres. Metalcore, deathcore, nu metal, and lately, retro-thrash - they’re all kind of bullshit cash-in genres as far as I’m concerned. What does this gave to do with EVILE? Some can successfully accuse EVILE of riding the retro-thrash bandwagon. But fuck that, this record is simply too damn good to dismiss. Instead of merely aping every thrash cliché and rehashing them without shame, ELIVE takes the templates laid out before them and moulds them into their own. This is not a highly original record, but a great one nonetheless. The songs actually go somewhere, and have lots of interesting twists, turns, and nuances. Every single song is an epic, with all but one approaching six minutes (including the absolutely mammoth 11 minute instrumental closer “Hundred Wrathful Deities”). Sure guitarist/vocalist Matt Drake is channeling Hetfield, both guitar and vocal wise, but even Hetfield may stand to learn something by checking EVILE out. And the riffs; holy shit this record is absolutely riff-tastic. Seriously, “Infected Nation”, “Devoid Of Thought”, and “Nosophoros” have some of the finest riffs I’ve ever heard, giving a guy like Patrik Jensen (riff master for WITCHERY and THE HAUNTED for those who don’t know) a run for his money. In fact all of these guys-Drake, lead guitarist Ol Drake, drummer Ben Carter, and bassist Mike Alexander (who sadly passed away 15 days after this album’s release)-are beyond capable players, who flaunt the song-smithing techniques and instrumental chops of far more seasoned veterans. This is simply an excellent metal record made by a hungry young band that knows and respects their roots, and are not trying to reinvent the wheel. Check it out.\n\nMUNICIPAL WASTE - Massive Aggressive (www.earache.com)\n\nMUNICIPAL WASTE drummer Dave Witte is a phenomenal drummer. Too bad this album will get al the attention, while his best work from last year was on BURNT BY THE SUN’s criminally overlooked Heart Of Darkness. MUNICIPAL WATSE is kind of a joke to me, kind of like the antithesis of EVILE (see above). Whereas EVILE is actually creative with their retro-thrash sound, MUNICIPAL WASTE is kind of just there, offering nothing really interesting outside of hype and aggression. This isn’t necessarily a bad record, and the other musicians in the band are no slouches either, but it is a highly unoriginal and derivative retro-thrash record. The best aspect of this record-aside from the tremendous drumming-is its breakneck pace. In the time it took me to type this, 5 songs have flown by. You get 13 songs in 28 minutes, with the longest one being closer “Acid Sentence” at 3:02. So these guys aren’t fucking around with clean intros, mid paced sections, and technical wankery-just thrash, thrash, thrash. But that same advantage is also MUNICIPAL WATSE’S downfall, as the songs just kind of blend together and I’m convinced it’d be impossible to tell one song from another if this album was played on shuffle. If you’re a thrash enthusiast, check this out, otherwise there’s much better metal out there. Not bad, but rather meh.\n\nWHITE WIZZARD - High Speed GTO and Over The Top (www.earache.com)\n\nMan, I just don’t get this whole retro fad, especially when it comes to trad metal. It’s all well and good for what it is I suppose, but it doesn’t do a single damn thing for me. Yes, these guys are good players (look no further than “Into The Night” or “Over The Top” for proof); yes their production values are clean and slick (a.k.a “professional”). What kills this for me is the total ridiculousness of the lyrics. I don’t dig cheesy, “oh baby” kind of stuff, and this EP and album is chock full of it. I mean, seriously, “Oh baby lookin' mighty fine/What I gotta do to make you mine?/I gotta tell ya somethin' on my mind” (poetry from “Celestina”)? Give. Me. A. Break. That is some utterly ridiculous glam shit right there. And what the hell is up with those falsettos in “Megalodon”? King Diamond you are not. “Red Desert Skies”? You mean “Blood Red Skies”? Or maybe “Desert Plains”? Fucking spare me. I can’t fathom that there is someone in one of Earache’s two international offices who thinks this is marketable. Look, there is only one PREIST and only one MAIDEN. Why bother trying to ape such legendary and identifiable sounds? At least try, try and do something of your own, whether it’s a new take of an established sound or something original. But put some fucking effort into it. I’m gonna put Stained Class on and forget the last hour and 15 minutes. “40 Deuces”? How appropriate.\n\nYOUR DEMISE - Ignorance Never Dies (www.earache.com)\n\n“Fad” metal, or heavy music in this particular case, seems to be a running theme in this installment. After 4 retro-trash/metal records, now we get some metalcore. Awesome. YOUR DEMISE is actually pretty intense, but intensity is all this band seems to have going on for them. Musicianship, songwriting, and originality are lacking. So what if these guys can two-step? Who if this band does breakdowns? YOUR DEMISE’s approach is heavy on the hardcore, lean on the metal, which is actually somewhat refreshing (compared to most metalcore bands), and there’s nary a clean vocal passage to be heard anywhere on this disc. So these guys come to just bludgeon you, and they effectively do just that-there’s no complicated playing, no syrup-y choruses, no shredding (I think there was one guitar solo, in “The Clocks Aren’t Ticking Backwards”), just brutal, metal influenced hardcore. Unfortunately, this type of monotonous, mindless brutality-geared more for kids in the pit-does nothing for me. I was all about ready to write this band off until I got to “Unknown Dub”; a dark trip-hop/industrial instrumental. This is easily the best five minutes on this record. Couple that with “Great Shape”, which is like dark techno, and “Hypochondriac” (industrial noise), you have 10 solid minutes of dark electronic music. If this band abandoned metalcore and went with this type of stuff, then I’d be way more inclined to listen to them. Either way, this record’s totally forgettable-three songs can’t save it. I’d reckon this band goes down like a storm at a hardcore show, but that type of shallow aggression doesn’t translate well to record in this case. I’ll recommend this to hardcore and metalcore kids, but no one else really. Mediocre.\n\nGRIND MADNESS AT THE BBC (www.earache.com)\n\nWow, this is mammoth. A 3 disc, 8 band, 118 song, compilation of essential grind recorded live at the BBC. Well, at least 6 out of 8 bands are definitive grind and one, CARCASS, is on the fence; GODFLESH and BOLT THROWER were never legit grindcore. What I’m gonna do is break it down band by band. One caveat: I’m reviewing this from a digital promo-I have no liner notes. I can’t verify any claim, or lack there of, by Earache regarding completeness and exclusivity (1990 being the cutoff year and sessions recorded by John Peel seem to be the inclusion criteria). Diving head first, here we go.\n\nNapalm Death-34 tracks. Many, many classic tracks from 1987-1990 are included. Two of Napalm’s pivotal lineups are represented. The first 26 songs are from two sessions featuring the lineup of Embury/Mick Harris/Steer/Dorrian, and the remaining 8 tracks from are one session featuring Mick Harris/Mitch Harris/Embury/Pintado/Greenway. None of these tracks are unreleased, as they’ve been complied many times over, most recently by Strange Fruit as The Complete Radio One Sessions in 2000. If that compilation still is in print, and you are only interested in Napalm’s material, seek it out because it is superior to this compilation’s contribution in its completeness. This compilation is unfortunately missing a session from 1996 with four songs from the most enduring Napalm lineup-Embury/Mitch Harris/Pintado/Greenway/Herrera. Otherwise, what’s to say about this material that hasn’t already been said? This is classic in every possible sense of the word, so many timeless songs are included, and Napalm’s unhinged energy remains unmatched to this day (where Napalm is fusing it’s classic grind sound with some SWANS like dissonant noise). If you get this compilation only for Napalm Death’s historical contribution, then you’ve made a wise purchase.\n\nExtreme Noise Terror-22 tracks. Almost just as intense as Napalm Death, Extreme Noise Terror retains a sloppier punk edge. This is a band I shamefully admit I’m not familiar with, despite knowing their historical significance and integral role in the development of grind as a cohesive genre. These tracks are complied from 3 sessions, and all tracks have previously been released, most recently by Discipline Records in 1998 (although it wouldn’t surprise me if that comp is out of print, hereby making this the only officially available version of this collection of songs). Man, listening to this stuff is like a fist repeatedly to the face and I’m loving it when every blow lands. As I understand it, nowadays Extreme Noise Terror is a hybrid of grind, death metal, and crust punk, which to me sounds fucking amazing and is a testament to Extreme Noise Terror’s longstanding contribution to grindcore-they never forsook their punk roots. Essential stuff.\n\nCarcass-8 tracks. Carcass was known for bringing the “gore” angle to grind over blunt politics (even though they were initially subliminally political-the early lyrics were indeed gory, but coming from a vegan/animal lib angle as opposed to outright sadism or misogyny). These tracks were pulled from two sessions and were previously released by Earache on the Choice Cuts compilation. These songs are from Carcass’ early era, before they went full on technical melodic death metal (even though Carcass was one of the early bands considered grind that was always more death metal oriented and had a less overall punk influence). Personally, I prefer a more developed, death metal Carcass, as the stuff on Necroticism and Heartwork is superior to the early records. But even then, their early records were far more technically developed than what their peers were doing at the time. Carcass’ contribution to this comp is essential for those reasons alone-the gore theme and higher caliber musicianship- even though they would go on to make better music. Sadly, Carcass never recorded another session with the BBC to showcase said improved music.\n\nBolt Thrower-12 tracks. Bolt Thrower is a band that I’ve never personally seen as grind, being pretty much death metal from the start with a smidge of grind influence. Their lyrical themes of war and epic, metal as fuck musical approach were and remain alien to grindcore. These tracks are taken from 3 sessions, and were previously released by Strange Fruit in 1991 but, like Extreme Noise Terror, I would not be surprised if that comp is out of print and this is the only way you can get your hands on these recordings. The first session is interesting because it’s the only widespread release-aside from some early demos-with original vocalist Alan West. Solid stuff here.\n\nGodflesh-4 tracks. This is the real gem for me on a personal level, as Godflesh is a recent obsession of mine. Not grind at all, Godflesh’s mechanical industrial metal is harsh, dissonant, martial, repetitive, yet extreme in a way that no one has accurately done since. This lone session is being released in its entirety for the first time on this compilation (2 songs, “Tiny Tears” and “Pulp” were previously released on the In All Languages compilation). Godflesh is a totally different kind of heavy. Never approaching anything that resembles an extreme tempo, Broadrick and Green pummel you with harsh guitar noise and sterile, monotonous beats. The only thing grind about Godflesh’s music is the fact that their music vaguely resembles the metallic harshness of machine parts grinding together. The versions of “Pulp” and “Like Rats” included here are simply devastating. The inclusion of the unreleased material makes the acquisition of this comp worthwhile. Excellent, excellent, excellent.\n\nUnseen Terror-8 tracks. Unseen Terror is a one-time side project of Shane Embury of Napalm Death and this one session features Mick Harris from Napalm on vocals. This session was previously released by Strange Fruit in 1989 and, again, this comp is most likely the only way you can get these recordings. Sloppy, punk-ish grind with some vaguely thrash-influenced breaks is Unseen Terror’s M.O. Quite possibly the least interesting material on this comp, the music is merely OK and the vocals are quite redundant. Decent stuff, but on the merits of the material alone, it’s not worth seeking out this comp just for these recordings. The likely rarity of this material may be a selling point for grind and/or Napalm Death collectors.\n\nHeresy-19 tracks. Very interesting stuff here. Heresy’s version of grind is likely the truest to the genre’s roots on this collection. This is basically extreme punk rock-a precursor to crust punk. There’s nary a metal influenced riff to be found here, and the vocals are mostly cleanly sung (some grunting/screaming pops up here and there). The only thing that ties this to metal influenced grind is the use of blast beats. These tracks are pulled from 3 sessions, and as far as I can ascertain, all 19 tracks are previously unreleased, making Heresy’s contribution to this comp quite valuable. This is some raw, high-energy stuff. To reiterate, this is (seemingly) the first official release of these recordings, which makes the acquisition of this compilation that much more worthwhile.\n\nIntense Degree-11 tracks. Like Heresy, Intense Degree falls more on the punk side of grind. These recordings are from one session, and were previously released by Strange Fruit in 1988. And like Extreme Noise Terror, Bolt Thrower, and Unseen Terror, this is probably the only official version of this session currently in print. This material is; again, quite similar to Heresy, as it is mostly punk riffing over blast beats with cleanly sung vocals. The slight differentiating factor between the two bands is that Intense Degree dials in a slight thrash influence. Solid and full throttle way to close out the comp.\n\nTo sum it up, this compilation is an absolutely mandatory purchase for all those into early extreme music. This is the very definition of (mostly) grindcore, recorded in its element-live and raw. The unreleased material by HERESY and especially GODFLESH, and the likely rarity of all the other material, solidifies this comp as an essential historical document. Don’t wait-snatch this up immediately, and thank me later.\n\nTHE OFFICIAL HEAVY METAL BOOK OF LISTS by Eric Danville (Backbeat Press)\n\nNow, I’m all for legitimate metal based literature, but this is only “literature” in the sense that it’s pages bound by glue. Right off the bat, let’s look the cover, as it is telltale of how misinformed the content of this book actually is. Fourteen caricatures of well-known musicians grace the cover and only 5 of them could be considered legit metal musicians-Zakk Wylde (not a fan, but I can’t deny the legitimacy), Lars Ulrich, Ozzy (same boat as Zakk Wylde), King Diamond, and Kerry King. 35.74% of caricatures on the cover of a heavy metal based book actually play heavy metal. Who else is represented, you may ask? Ted Nugent, Slash, Alice Cooper, Angus Young, Tommy Lee, Jimmy Page, Gene Simmons, Eddie Van Halen, and Lemmy (not metal by his own admission). So without even opening the book, we are heading down the wrong path. Artists referenced and/or contributing within the book don’t fare much better as the likes of Creed, Bon Jovi, Korn, Babes In Toyland, Jimi Hendrix, Kittie, Eve 6, Limp Bizkit, Orgy, Insane Clown Posse, Evanescence, and Hooobastank among so, so many others, all get a nod. I must point out that I dig a bit of the non-metal bands referenced in this book (none listed above, however). There are indeed plenty of legit bands/artists culled from a wide variety of metal subgenres name dropped-Possessed, Bathory, Mayhem, St. Vitus, Gorgoroth, Angelcorpse, and Deathspell Omega are just a few. My point? Real metalheads need to approach this with a grain of salt, and take this at face value- a campy, corny, cheesy telling of metal/hard rock mythology. You will not find a serious dissertation on metal history and/or culture here.\n\nIt shouldn’t need to be said that this book is extremely light on serious content. It is what the title says it is - a book of lists. There’s nary a lengthy paragraph to be found anywhere on these 226 pages. It’s broken down into 7 loose conceptual chapters with two chapters overlapping-Drugs/Alcohol, Occult, Violence, Sex/Obscenity, Noise (freeform lists), On the Road (touring lifestyle), and Whole Lotta Lists (more freeform lists). There is roughly 140 some odd lists herein and I’ll just give you a sample of the topics without spoiling the content of the lists: 50 Heavy Metal Drinking Songs, Kittie’s Top 6 “Get Drunk For Under $30” Wines, 8 Heavy Metal Bands Who Got Their Name From Horror Movies, Pure Fucking Armageddon: The Norwegian Black Metal Body Count, 51 Awesomely Violent Band Names, 9 Metal Suicides, 52 Band Names About…Pussy!, Director Matt Zane Of Society 1 Remembers 25 Metalheads Who Appeared In His Porn Movies, 21 All Chick Metal Cover Bands, 12 Gibson Flying V Guitars, 6 Songs About Roadies, 17 Metalhead’s Stage Names And How The Got Them, 32 Great Moments In Kiss Merchandising, and 21 Hair Metal Video Fashion Tips. If this sort of largely inoffensive, inane content is your sort of thing, then I’m sure you’ll get a few chuckles out of this. It’s as well researched as it needs to be-the band name lists (which there are a few of) seem to be lacking a bit in effort, as if the author went to Metal Archives or some similar site and did a quick search for gory/sexual band names. The only thing I truly find objectionable about this book is in Chapter 3, Violence, there’s a list called 8 Heavy Metal Songs The Government Has Used To Torture Prisoners At Abu Ghraib And Guantanamo Bay. I absolutely find it sickening and appalling to make light of the injustice against human rights in the name of “freedom” committed by the leaders of our nation (and only 2 on the list of 8 are actual metal songs). This section should’ve absolutely been cut form the final print-there’s no excuse for this level of tastelessness.\n\nAll in all, this book is simply a “for fun” affair. An easy read (the fonts are humungous-I wonder if that’s a subliminal knock on the perceived intelligence level of the average metalhead) with shallow content, don’t come to this looking for seriousness and you won’t be disappointed.\n\nHATEBREED-Hatebreed (www.e1entertainment.com)\n\nI’m not gonna lie, I procrastinated reviewing this until the last possible minute because, simply put, HATEBREED bores the ever living shit out of me. One song in, and this album is no different. At least Satisfaction Is The Death Of Desire was an energetic hardcore record. Everything after that kind of weans the punk energy out and supplants it with plodding, midpaced metal. HATEBREED is one of the bands responsible for a great crime against metal: popularizing the breakdown. While already popular in hardcore punk, where HATEBREED is rooted, this idiom was unknown to metal largely until HATEBREED (among a few others) came along, and in turn it inspired lesser bands to fuse this with lame AT THE GATES ripoff riffs to birth the abomination known as metalcore. For this HATEBREED cannot be forgiven. Nowadays, HATEBREED doesn’t “two step”-they “thrash”. “Between Hell And A Heartbeat”, and “Hands Of A Dying Man” are some of the most laughable attempts at thrash since SLAYER’S last couple of records. I give HATEBREED a sliver of credit for trying to add touches of melody to break up the otherwise monotonous assault. “Not My Master” adds some melodic lead guitar to their usual recipe, “Every Lasting Scar” has a hook based around clean vocals, and “No Halos Of The Heartless” opens up with some MISFITS styled “whoas”. But overall, what’s old is new again for HATEBREED, and this is simply more of the same form this band since they added metal to their palette. Power chord chugging, lame and typical syncopated double bass drumming, nothing interesting bass-wise, gang vocals, and Jamey Jasta’s monotone tough guy bark. HATEBREED’s “classic” overcompensating machismo is, of course, in full effect here. “Everyone fuckin’ bleeds now!” Jasta shouts at us in the cleverly titled “Everyone Bleeds Now”. Poetic. They’re trying real hard to make every song anthemic, and while a catchy gang vocal is usually all it takes, HATEBREED has used this trick so many times and it was old in 2002. How do you think it holds up in 2010? Fucking hell, was that supposed to be a blast beat in “Through The Thorns”? Holy shit, I’ve seen it all now-HATEBREED is blast beating. And a melancholic piano in the fucking instrumental (!) “Undiminished”! I think I shit my pants! Just when I thought the shock of how bad this actually is subsided, HATEBREED whips out another zinger-a cover of METALLICA’s “Escape”. Believe me, the irony of HATEBREED doing a by the numbers cover of what’s widely regarded as METALLICA’s absolute worst pre-Black Album, classic era song is not at all lost on me. If you’re interested, there’s a Best Buy exclusive version of this record (how’s that for crass commercialism?) with 2 live bonus tracks and an hour plus long DVD with 13 live performances, music videos, and in the studio footage. But I’d sooner say skip this, unless you’re fucking 12 and need an outlet for your preteen angst.\n\nSTRIKE ANYWHERE-Iron Front (www.bridge9.com)\n\nThis was a surprise; I guess it boils down to me not being familiar with STRIKE ANYWHERE beforehand. What we have here is super melodic hardcore/punk rock-but pop punk this ain’t. High energy, politically charged, hook laden punk rock somewhat reminiscent of the classic California sound (think NOFX, BAD RELIGION) with some D.C. scene tendencies (MINOR THREAT, GOOD CLEAN FUN, etc.). STRIKE ANYWHERE hits the perfect balance of melody and aggression, and the hooks, energy, and thought provoking lyrics keep you fully engaged for the all too brief 13 song, 29:59 run time. Get the record, learn the lyrics, go to the show, and shout all the gang vocal parts from the pit. Highly, highly recommended if you dig melodic hardcore/punk-this is top shelf stuff.\n\nDEAD SWANS - Sleepwalkers (www.bridge9.com)\n\nBare bones, modern hardcore. Imagine AGNOSTIC FRONT in a Brooklyn street fight with the CRO-MAGS (DEAD SWANS though, hail from the U.K.), and that’ll paint an accurate picture of what to expect here. While some touches spice things up - some post punk like dissonances scattered throughout and “Ivy Archway”, a melancholic clean guitar interlude - the vast bulk of this record is formulaic and uninteresting. Two-step, two-step, two-step, breakdown, breakdown, breakdown, repeat ad nauseum. Despite being energetic by nature, this music bores me to tears. “Winter Overture” is by far and away the best tune on this record, and can be best described as a slightly melodic midpaced instrumental with some choice textural guitar work. Thankfully, Nick Worthington’s monotonous and one dimensional vocal approach does not soil this tune in the same way it does the other tracks. Mercifully, this record is a brief 29 minutes. I don’t expect every band to break the mold, but it doesn’t even sound like DEAD SWANS are trying-they’d rather exploit the templates laid out before them. If you dig modern hardcore, then you should stick to the genre innovators-and you shouldn’t need me to tell you who they are-and skip this second rate band entirely. –Dan Siano\n\nDETHKLOK - Dethalbum II (www.adultswim.com)\n\nI really, really, really, really, really struggle to give this “band” any credence whatsoever. I watched one episode of the shitty TV show, and failed to see the humor in the exploitation of the worst stereotypes of metal culture. And the “music” contained herein continues on said path of exploitation of metal musical stereotypes for financial gain. Brendon Small, the alleged “mastermind” behind this project, can claim his love for metal and that this is done in the spirit of tribute all he wants, but I’LL NEVER BELIVE IT FOR ONE FUCKING SECOND. I’m equally saddened by Gene Hoglan’s involvement with this entity as well, but with his recent joining up with “FEAR FACTORY”, I suppose it’s anything for a buck, right Gene? Look, there’s no doubt that Small is a skilled musician-just listening to this record proves that. And Hoglan’s skills behind the kit are legendary (and the ONLY redeemable factor on this abomination of a record); I shouldn’t even have to state it. My beef with this is that every single fucking musical motif on display here is merely a parody of a wide variety of metal genre archetypes. Blast beats, slow/midpaced heavy beats, double bass, palm muted open low string chugging, melodic riffs/leads, tremolo picking, shredding solos, sweep arpeggios, harmonized lead guitar lines, unison rhythms, odd time signatures, epic keys, death metal riffs, melodeath riffs, thrashy riffs and beats, industrial touches, the whole fucking kitchen sink is on here! For fuck’s sake, you’d think this was the most innovative, original metal band on the face of the whole fucking earth! I’d probably dig this, if there wasn’t a mean-spirited attitude behind it. Small must have done a lot of research to get this mockery as accurate as it is. The worst offense is the vocals, which are reminiscent of every punk asshole kid’s mocking impression of “kill your mother, rape your dog” death metal vocals. Weak and whispery, and absolutely lacking balls, Small must have used a shit-ton of studio plugins to make these vocals happen. This joke’s gone on far too long. Some people don’t see metal as a joke. Some people see it as a way of life. Some people see it as high art. Brendon Small is NOT one of those people. Brendon Small sees metal as exploitable for profit and ripe for mockery by all the scumbag hipsters that watch Adult Swim. Fuck you, Brendon Small, and fuck your shitty “band”. An absolute affront to metal and the people who live for it. –Dan Siano\n\nKITTIE - In The Black (www.e1ent.com)\n\nDo people actually still give a shit about this gimmicky band? Man, this is laughable. Oh, so nu-metal is dead now? No problem-there’s always the metalcore bandwagon to jump on. Cause KITTIE’s only made their heaviest and hardest record yet, right? Give me a break. This sounds like KILLSWITCH ENGAGE done by chicks (which, to some degree, that’s exactly what it is). The Lander sisters, and whoever happens to be playing with them at any given moment, are up to their old tricks again (and to the naïve or uninitiated, said tricks are doing whatever’s popular to stay popular), this time going the route of heavy verses and melodic choruses. Sound familiar? It should. Mercedes Lander still only knows one double bass pattern (for the benefit of the musically inclined that’s 1e+a 2 3e+a 4), and the riffs are stale as 2 week old white bread. Morgan Lander’s clean vocals are the highlight of the record, as they are excellently performed and quite catchy, but her growling is forced beyond belief. Tara McLeod is also quite the guitarist; there’s a ton of choice soloing and melodic lead lines. But flashy guitar licks and decent crooning can’t possibly cover up this band’s poor songwriting chops. I mean, “Die My Darling”? Come on. What’s going to be next? “Blood Raining Down”? “The Sandman Will Enter”? Have an original thought for once. Check out “Sleepwalking” and “Whiskey Love Song”. The exact same intro, only differentiated by meter! Yeah, KITTIE’s transitioned from nu-metal to metalcore. So what? That’s supposed to make them good, or legit even? Spare me. This band will always be gimmick heavy, with a smidgen of decent chops. Pass. –Dan Siano\n\nMUCKY PUP - A Boy In A Man’s World/Now (Reissues) (www.iscreamrecords.com)\n\nSo, here we have 2 out of print “classic” early works by seminal NJ hardcore band MUCKY PUP, now conveniently packaged on one CD. Is this hardcore? Cause this is awfully light in the pants. This could never qualify as metal by any stretch of the imagination. I mean “Landscrapers” is vaguely reminiscent of ANTHRAX or SUICIDAL TENDENCIES, but if that’s really as hard as it gets, then that’s fucking sad. Where’s the ferocity and aggression characteristic of classic hardcore? I know this band is revered, but I don’t see the appeal. And man, the lyrics for the A Boy In A Man’s Word segment are terrible. Is this some kind of joke? “Batman the buttripper, use your butt like a can opener”. I could not make that up if I dug to the deepest corners of my sordid imagination. Maybe these lyrics are supposed to have some kind of deeper metaphorical meaning, but I somehow doubt it. In fact, one line of these cheesy lyrics sums up this band as a whole quite well: “Just another noise song, to fill up space. Cause we’re not creative enough to write real songs”. I realize that this was probably directed at other bands in the scene at the time, but it is fittingly appropriate to describe the works of this band. The lyrics to the Now segment are slightly more serious, and therefore a bit more digestible. I find myself unsurprisingly bored as I listen to this compilation, mainly because in addition to the asinine lyrics, I can’t grasp this “classic” band’s lack of musical focus. Compare “Batman” (complete with a Batman TV there reference) to “Little Pigs” (a telling of the three little pigs fairytale predating GREEN JELLO by 7 years) to the aforementioned “Landscrapers” to “All’s Cool” to “Jam It” (80’s styled new wave?) to…you catch my drift. Totally all over the place. Maybe it’s something I don’t get, but this band is horrible and is only afforded “classic” status due to when they were making music as opposed to the music that they were making. As for hardcore? I’ll stick to MINOR THREAT, thank you very much. –Dan Siano\n\nDIRGE WITHIN-Force Fed Lies (www.e1music.us)\n\nIt’s a tale as old as time - a metalcore band with thrash and melodic death metal influences, a decent rhythm section, a guitar shredder, and an angsty vocalist who alternates from shouts to clean singing. This was somewhat of an original sound circa 2000-when bands like SHADOWS FALL and GOD FORBID were just getting noticed. But almost a decade later, this formula is about as stale as 3 day old Krispy Kreme’s. Sugary, but disgusting. And now we have DIRGE WITHIN. Bringing absolutely nothing new to the table, this band-which formed roughly two years ago-seems to exist solely for profit. And I say that with good reason-this is guitarist Shaun Glass’ second attempt at commercial music glory. You see Mr. Glass first well-known band was BROKEN HOPE, an excellent brutal death metal band (with such charmers as “Erotic Zoophilism”, “Penis Envy”, and “Hobo Stew”). Brutal, gore soaked death metal is hardly profitable business-CANIBAL CORPSE being the notable exception. So when that didn’t bring him to great fortune, he sold his soul to CREED-esque rockers SOIL. Now, when that didn’t pan out as hoped, he jumped on the metalcore bandwagon and rode it. Hard. Anyways, DIRGE WITHTIN is an entirely forgettable band, and its only redeeming factor is the choice lead guitar work (promotional materials provided leave it ambiguous as to whether Glass or fellow axe slinger Matthew Szlachta is responsible). But even then, how many commercialized metalcore bands have excellent lead guitarists? Quite a few. It’s simply not enough to save this wholly terrible band. There is not one memorable moment on this record. I shudder to think that some impressionable kid is going to stumble upon DIRGE WITHTIN and proclaim it to be the most elite underground metal band. As for me? I’m gonna go induce vomiting to hopefully quell the nauseating feeling I got while listening to this.\n\nTHE PERENNIAL-Dissension (www.theperennial.net)\n\nModern hardcore. Yeah this stuff is intense, but it’s also quite banal. THE PERNNIAL throw down in “classic” HATEBREED fashion, but comparatively add a touch of guitar melody and keep the tempos quick, and not reliant on the ol’ breakdown. But that’s all they really have going for them; a slight edge from the pack. Otherwise, this is as formulaic as it gets. As usual, the vocals are the weakest link, being nothing more than a monotone bark. Not much more to say really, as this EP is over in the blink of an eye (3 songs in roughly 9 minutes). Recommended to those who dig HATEBREED, early POISION THE WELL, early CONVERGE, and the like. You can snag a free download from the band’s website, provided above.\n\nMEMPHIS MAY FIRE-Sleepwalking (www.trustkill.com)\n\nAn intriguing and energetic, but ultimately unrewarding experience; MEMPHIS MAY FIRE play a blend of metalcore, post-hardcore, and southern rock. A weird combo, right? It doesn’t work though, as the post-hardcore (read: modern emo) influences dominate everything. The only metal element, borrowed from metalcore, is clichéd and tired breakdowns. I will say that the guitar work of Killen McGregor and Ryan Bentley is pretty damn scorching when it wants to be. When not in full-on breakdown or emo chorus mode, these guys do a ton of bluesy, legato riffs, licks, and solos. Mostly excellent work from these guys. However, Matt Mullins on vocals kills this band for me. I am just not into this type of high-pitched emo singing at all. I don’t mind the screaming, but those whiny clean vocals-which are all the rage these days-are plain fucking annoying. All in all, this is a short, high-octane record, that is merely inoffensive and nothing special. Imagine ESCAPE THE FATE, or a jacked-up THE USED drinking a shit-ton of whiskey and busting out their dad’s old SKYNYRD records. Not my thing at all, and not metal at all, but I’d reckon the kids who are into this type of stuff will gobble it up and beg for more.\n\nVICIOUS CYCLE - Pale Blue Dot (www.derangedrecords.com)\n\nBlistering and slightly melodic hardcore punk (in the original sense) is on VICIOUS CYCLE’s menu. Whilst it’s nothing groundbreaking, this record is totally fun and packed with adrenaline. And these guys are no slouches instrumentally either; there’s plenty of REFUSED-like dissonances, “The Waiting” has got some pretty cool odd time signatures, and “Death”, “For Carl”, and “Rebirth” are trippy soundscapes. Vocally, Nico Taus is channeling Earth A.D. era Danzig; deep howls and some deep bluesy clean singing (used very sporadically). The production quality is raw, dirty, and smacks of analog-it’s very “demo” like if you catch my drift. I have to imagine this record was made to be heard on vinyl. I’d also guess that VICIOUS CYCLE is a very intense and formidable live band. With 13 songs in 28 minutes, you know what you’re getting-an absolutely no frills, old-school punk record. Check it out.\n\nSHADOWS FALL-Retribution (www.everblackindustries.com)\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I’m a hypocrite cause I decry metalcore but dig SHADOWS FALL. Fucking sue me. I’ve been following these guys since 2000 (I must have seen them at least 7-8 times that year alone-they were practically on every tour package that year). They had somewhat of a unique sound back then, and everybody’s aped it and commercialized it since. I was looking forward to this record-after the drama surrounding their time with Atlantic Records for the disappointing Threads Of Life (supposed forced commercial leanings), and hearing how this record was going to be handled independently (with the assist from Ferret Records solely for distribution), I had expectations of an absolute thrashtastic barnburner. SHADOWS FALL were free to do as they please. After the obligatory acoustic intro, “The Path To Imminent Ruin”, “My Demise” kicks in with a neck breaking thrash intro. I was faked out soon thereafter, as this tune has many twists and turns. Mostly midpaced for the verses and choruses, it soon heads for an epic clean bridge, and a blistering neoclassical section-reminiscent of Yngwie Malmsteen-immediatley afterwards. I was kind of disappointed at first, coming from the thrashy intro to mostly midpaced metal, but then I realized it takes some balls to open your record with a seven-minute epic. And after one tune, I can say with certainty that Jon Donais is still one of the finest lead guitarists in metal; an absolute fucking beast. Some of the stuff he pulls off on this record is just mindblowing. And the rhythm section of guitarist Matt Bachand, drummer Jason Bittner, and bassist Paul Romanko is as tight as ever. I caught SHADOWS FALL on Jimmy Fallon performing “Still I Rise”; a decent tune, but nothing special, there to serve the function of the requisite “single” (along the lines of “Destroyer Of Senses” and “Inspiration On Demand”). The three-pronged vocal attack (Donais, Bachand, and lead throat Brian Fair) is as sharp as ever and used to great effect. The only drawback-and this is somewhat minor-is that the choruses are predominately cleanly sung and saccharine as all fuck. The hooks on this record scream “radio”. In fact, these choruses are the most accessible in their entire catalog; even more so than on Threads Of Life (you know, with the forced major label commercialism and all). I find it kind of weird that the band had total control over the content of this record, and chose to add such blatant radio hooks. Anyways, “War” satisfied my craving for thrash, as this one’s absolutely lethal. Diversity has always been SHADOWS FALL’s ultimate strength, and they play this aspect up more so than ever. There’s really something for every metalhead, from epic (“My Demise”), to midpaced (“King Of Nothing” and “The Taste Of Fear”), to melodic (“Still I Rise”), to extreme (“War”). This album is ace and completely pisses all over Threads Of Life and Somber Eyes To The Sky, and is on par with The Art Of Balance and The War Within. They still haven’t topped Of One Blood yet, though.\n\nBLACK ARROWS OF FILTH AND IMPURITY-1984 (Eternal) (www.gileadmedia.net)\n\nWhat an intense mix BLACK ARROWS is brewing here. Imagine NAPALM DEATH, THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN, and GODFLESH engaging in a knife fight and you’ll be close to approaching BLACK ARROWS’ modus operandi. From the moment “Pearl Harbor Necklace” kicks in, the intensity does not let up, save for some industrial noise breaks scattered throughout. Guitar work is noisy and dissonant, drums blast and pound away mercilessly, and the vocals are pure venom. This is as brutal as using a hammer and a screwdriver to perform facial reconstruction surgery. This band’s name very accurately describes their sound; dirty, nasty, and lethal. Strongly recommended to those who dig experimental, dissonant, mildly technical grind.\n\nCHIMAIRA-The Infection (www.ferretstyle.com)\n\nOh boy, a new CHIMAIRA record. This band has zero credit with me (and most legit metalheads)-starting off as pure KORN inspired nu-metal and jumping on the metalcore bandwagon as soon as they could, this band is a lot like former label mates MACHINE HEAD: constantly changing their sound to suit whatever the “popular” genre of heavy music is in at the moment. I’m certain once metalcore dies it’s deserved death, CHIMAIRA will just hop onto the next trend. Regarding The Infection, this “music” is as boring as watching shit decompose. What makes it even worse this time around is the pacing of this record-everything is so slow. The overall tempo is plodding and it just feels like breakdown after breakdown after breakdown for an hour. The uptempo sections are so very scarce-the most notable one is in “The Disappearing Sun”, complete with a foray into blast beats and tremolo riffs. But it’s such a brief segment, and they default right back to their ridiculous breakdowns. Credit where it’s due, drummer Andols Herrick has got some tight and quick feet (his hands, however, are a whole different story), and his performance is the most interesting aspect of this record. Rob Arnold on lead guitar tries hard to break the monotony with some scattered leads and “atmospheric” arpeggios over the breakdown sections, but it’s not enough to be truly engaging. Vocalist Mark Hunter though, is by far the weakest and most uninteresting aspect on display here. The vocal performance on this record is so pitifully phoned in and one dimensional; just a plain bark throughout with some very, very sparse touches of death growls, shrieks, and clean vocals. And seriously, why this band has a keyboardist is beyond me-if I had to guess, I’d say keys and samples make up maybe between 5-10% of this record. It’s not surprising, but nonetheless sad, that this band is so popular. The scene kids need something easy to mosh it up to. This was painful to sit through in its entirety. Wise metalheads don’t need me to tell them to skip this one.\n\nCYCLE OF PAIN-Cycle Of Pain (www.reformrecords.com)\n\nCYCLE OF PAIN’s self-titled debut offers up a diverse, yet ultimately lackluster helping of pseudo-stoner rock/metal. Headed up by John “J.D.” DeServio, who’s done time with Zakk Wylde in BLACK LABEL SOCIETY among others, and featuring a plethora of guest musicians, this album is chock full of riffs, solos, and grooves. The first thing to catch my ear was the production-it’s raw as fuck and very bass heavy, highlighting DeServio’s powerful, yet trebly bass tone-most apparent on “Down Witcha Pain”, the slap & pop licks on opener “5”, and the fretless slithering of piano and string ballad “I See Heaven”. There’s a loose, jammy vibe across all the tracks, with extended solos by band lead guitarist Joe T. and guest Zakk Wylde. Main vocalist Gregg Locascio is channeling early Ozzy, with a strong, bluesy wail. Halfway through the record things do take a turn for the weird-“M”, “Pungle”, and “Cycle Of Pain” are heavily industrial influenced (the latter featuring Burton C. Bell of FEAR FACTORY, Hugo Fereira of TANTRIC, and Russell Allen of SYMPHONY X), “Babe” and “Do My Work High” are heavy on the funk with “Do My Work High” showcasing rapped (?) vocals by Locascio and Sen. Dog of CYPRESS HILL, and “Egypt” invokes just that in it’s middle eastern influenced grooves. My only real criticism of this record is that nothing is groundbreaking or inherently original-nothing at all new about bluesy guitar based hard rock, rapped vocals over rock music, or industrial influenced rock. The production varying between tracks is a touch annoying, but it’s no major gripe. Despite all that, this record is played with passion, heart, and skill. Which, really, is all you can ask for. I do have a bone to pick, though, and it’s something i noticed in the press bio included with my promo CD. Apparently DeServio sees this project as a direct descendant of BLACK SABBATH, seeing as how he played with Zakk Wylde in BLS, and Wylde has played in Ozzy’s solo band. Now, I’m no SABBATH aficionado, but it comes across to me as kind of a cheap ploy for press. Anyhow, I’m advising those who dig well executed, non-pretentious, uncomplicated heavy rock to check this out.\n\nDARKEST HOUR-The Eternal Return (www.victoryrecords.com)\n\nDARKEST HOUR is not fucking around on their new record, The Eternal Return. For starters, this album is lean and mean, being DARKEST HOUR’s shortest record at just under 35 minutes and every song just rips. Gone are the overlong melodic sections, extended guitar solos, and clean vocals that permeated the Devin Townsend produced Undoing Ruin and Deliver Us. This record throws back to Hidden Hands Of A Sadist Nation and the classic So Sedated, So Secure era of the band. Filled to the brim with Swedish styled uber-melodic death metal riffs, relentless thrashing beats, and John Henry’s seething and venomous bark, this collection of songs sees this road worn band play with a renewed fire, as if they were a super hungry garage band just starting out. New axeman Mike Carrigan has the daunting task of following up insane shredder Kris Norris, and while he’s not quite on that level, he does an excellent job of integrating himself and making his presence known. The guitar solos on this record are fantastic. This is by far DARKEST HOUR’s best record in 6 years, and the third overall best record in their discography. Authenticity is not a question, and no one would dare call this band “metalcore” if they were not American. Tremendous, tremendous record, and easily one of the best of 2009 thus far. Get this. –Dan Siano\n\nGALLOWS-Grey Britain (Reprise)\n\nNo, not happening. Are the bigwigs in major label land seriously trying to pass GALLOWS off as hardcore punk (not to be confused with “hardcore”-you know the 90’s bastardization of punk and metal, ala HATEBREED, which ultimately gave way to the current metalcore fad)? Shouting over something slightly harder than SUM 41 does not a hardcore band make. Anyways, this is quite terrible. For one, this is a long fucking album, with 13 songs at 52 minutes. Punk albums should never approach that length, unless it’s a classic band’s complete discography or something like Zen Arcade. Aside from that, the music is quite stale; every song rolls about at practically the same tempo (occasionally, GALLOWS attempts something resembling two-step or d-beat, with mediocre results), with the same metal influenced guitar approach, and with the same gang vocals. Ooh, there’s piano and strings at the end of “Death Voices” and acoustic guitar in “The Vulture (Acts 1 & 2)”-big fucking deal. Lead vocals? A monotone shout with brief explorations in pitch singing, nothing more, nothing less. The sing-along break in “Death Voices” is laughable. For shame; you dare call yourself “hardcore punk”? This is a disgrace to BLACK FLAG, MINOR THREAT, REAGAN YOUTH, and countless, countless others. This record is a simply a boring, unexciting, and tedious listen. Nothing to see here folks-move along. –Dan Siano\n\nBLOOD RED THRONE - Souls Of Damnation (www.earache.com)\n\nBlasting out of the gate with “The Light, The Hate”, BLOOD RED THRONE wastes no time acclimating you to their brand of mildly technical brutal death metal. I say “mildly technical”, but don’t let that fool you-the instrumental performance here cuts like a freshly sharpened blade. The riffs of Dod and Tchort are tasteful and restrained, blending an old school (think MORBID ANGEL) approach with some more modern touches (ala early DEEDS OF FLESH) and played with a razor sharp tone. They take your head off with some heavy, powerful and slightly melodic playing without being needlessly flashy like BRAIN DRILL or NECROPHAGIST. Bassist Erlend Caspersen interjects the most interesting playing here as he drops in some understated fills and contrapuntal lines; but it’s never overdone and never detracts from the overall vibe of the tune (see “Throne Of Damnation” and “Your Cold Flesh” for the most obvious examples). Drummer Anders Haave puts down a competent mix of blasts, double bass, and thrash beats, solidly holding down the backbone of the material and throwing in some tasty cymbal work for added flair. Thankfully, vocalist Vlad spares us from incoherent, inhumanly guttural vocals, instead opting for a deep, throaty roar that’s not unlike Craig Pillard-era INCANTATION. Each song is packed with structural twists and turns, which keeps things from getting predictable. No single song is a full speed blast fest, nor are they entirely slow and/or mid-paced-care was taken in making sure this collection of songs was not derivative or boring. While there is far better death metal out there, there is far, far worse as well. Solid above average death metal aimed to please the most discerning extreme metal head. Good stuff.\n\nEPHEL DUATH - Through My Dog’s Eyes (Elitist/Earache)\n\nI came across an interesting description of the concept behind this bizarre album while doing some background research. According to the entry for this record at the Metal Archives, this is “a concept album based on the life of a stray dog and the world seen through its eyes”. Man, that is an odd premise for a metal album, even one of a more progressive nature. While the playing here is technically top notch, I find myself not enjoying this record very much. This is a very loosely structured, meandering, jazz/blues/prog metal album. Mastermind Davide Tiso drives this record with his totally unique approach to the guitar, and he is anchored by the always-impressive Marco Minnemann on drums. Luciano George Lorusso provides vocals on this release, and his performance here can only really be described as “melodic harshness”. I mean, there is some clean pitch singing, and some growls and screaming, but for the most part is and exactly halfway blend of both styles. If that sounds weird to you, well, it was weird to me too. Maybe it’s a way to simulate a dog’s bark, to tie into the concept. I don’t know. Ben Weinman of THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN guests on closing track “Bark Loud”, providing some interesting cut up drum programming. No one song stands out as I get the impression that this is meant to be taken as a whole (even though there are clear breaks between the tracks)-riffs and passages are rarely repeated. I actually don’t hate this record, as there is plenty of stellar musicianship on display here (and this is pretty much the album’s saving grace). I’m more confused by it than anything else. I find it very interesting that this band allegedly has roots in black metal, of all things. This is a very, very challenging listen, and thankfully very short (barely over a half-hour). Most prog metal albums take full advantage of the 80 minute CD capacity, and 80 minutes of this would’ve been unbearable. This is recommended to the most die-hard prog rock/metal fans and fans of musician’s music only.\n\nIGNOMINIOUS INCARCERATION - Of Winter Born (www.earache.com)\n\nThe UK’s IGNOMINIOUS INCARCETATION (a candidate for one of the worst band names ever) unleashes their pummeling, yet undeniably generic debut album, Of Winter Born. This band’s core sound is a pastiche of modern brutal death metal, older styled melodic death metal, and metalcore. HATE ETERNAL meets earliest AT THE GATES meets DEAD TO FALL. Slightly more brutal, yet wholly unoriginal deathcore. It’s the same old story; a -core band that has great players that can’t write a decent and captivating song, opting for mindless flashy trick playing and thoughtless brutality instead. Steve Brown shreds his guitar and Sam Balley pounds his drums into submission with finesse (bassist Chris Ball does little of note). Andy Wardle is the weakest link here, as he phones in a very monotonous performance on vocals-low growling and high screaming with little variation. Mercifully, he spares us of any clean singing that is oh so typical of these –core genres. Song structures are nothing new; blast, breakdown, flashy guitar section, and repeat ad nauseum for 36 minutes. Every song sound like the last, and it doesn’t sound like any significant effort was put into the composition of this record (and is there was, then I feel sorry for these guys). I tire of this type of this stuff so quickly. I suppose there is worse out there, but I can’t strongly recommend this to anyone. At it’s absolute best-“In The Face Of Absolution”, which comes far too late into the album for any kind of redemption-this record is merely listenable and inoffensive. It’s just simply there. –Dan Siano\n\nOCEANO - Depths (www.earache.com)\n\nWow. I think I actually felt my IQ lower by a few points after listening to this. While IGNOMINIOUS INCARCERATION was simply mediocre, this represents the absolute worst deathcore, or any –core genre, has to offer. The periodic beeps used as a means of leakage/theft deterrence on the promo copy I obtained do nothing to distract of take away from the experience of this album. Seriously. I put that in bold to highlight the absurdity, yet accuracy of that statement. I don’t think I’ve heard a lazier band in my life. Every single song has one or more (if not all) of the following gimmicks-inhuman low gurgling trying to pass off as “death metal vocals” (infused with high pitched screaming, of course), multiple breakdown sections in which the lowest note on the guitars (ridiculously low tuned, by the way) is the only note played, playing breakdown styled riffs over blast/two-step beats (I refuse to call any of this thrash), cut and paste technical sections, heavily reverberated guitar arpeggios no doubt intended to give off a “oceanic” atmosphere, and this unnecessary “dive bomb” effect (where the pitch of everything is quickly lowered leading to a silent break and is subsequently restored in time for the next section). Is the six and a half minute instrumental title track supposed to be their take on ISIS-styled post metal? Are OCEANO trying to be epic? I’ve never before heard a band fail so hard at a more blatant rip-off; they ruined it with their cheesy breakdown styled chugging throughout. 13 songs at 44 minutes of this nonsense is far too much for anyone to take. By far and away, the worst thing I’ve heard in 2009 so far, and I don’t anticipate anything being worse. This is only metal by default and is the furthest thing from legitimate. This is nothing more than cash grab, flavor of the moment scene “music” made by scene kids, for scene kids. If you dare call yourself a metalhead, it is your absolute duty to shun this.\n\nHEAVY METAL KILLERS (www.earache.com)\n\nOverall summary: A fun, but ultimately pointless compilation (only one band, CAULDRON, is actually on Earache) of 10 bands riding the old-school heavy metal/retro-thrash bandwagon. For a more accurate picture on what each band brings to the table, I’ll briefly go though ‘em one by one.\n\nPowervice - “Behold The Hand Of Glory”. Fun, uptempo Di’Anno-era MAIDEN worship from the Netherlands. Lots of sweet guitar harmonies and a ripping guitar solo over an aggressive, punkish rhythm section. Title track from their 2005 demo.\n\nRAM - “Sudden Impact”. A blend of fast traditional metal and mid-tempo thrash from this Swedish band. Features a killer and aggressive main riff, melodic vocals, and an abundance of shredding guitar solos. From their 2005 album Forced Entry.\n\nCauldron - “Chained Up In Chains”. A track from the Canadian band’s 2009 album Chained To The Nite, which I’ve previously reviewed in full. To reiterate, this is old-era solo OZZY worship, decently done instrumentally, but severely lacking vocally and topped off with a cheesy lyrical tale of a femme fatale.\n\nEnforcer - “Mistress Of Hell”. ENFORCER from Sweden contribute a blazing speed metal tune reminiscent of early PRIEST. Unabashedly metal and featuring some great bass playing as well as some tasty leads and riffs. From their 2008 album Into The Night.\n\nH.O.D. - “Kicked To The Kerb”. The UK’s H.O.D. (HOSPITAL OF DEATH) offer this nondescript midpaced thrasher from their 2008 album Beer, Bitches, & Blood. Some decent riffs, but not much else. Truly horrible lyrics here.\n\nPortrait - “A Thousand Nightmares”. Pulled from their 2008 self titled album, this Swedish band tries to channel a poor man’s version of a speed metal MERCYFUL FATE, especially vocally. A commendable attempt, but falls short of the mark. The highlight of the song is the extended trade off solo section over multiple riffs-something more bands should be doing these days.\n\nCrowning Glory - “Sea Of Dead Dreams”. Early Dickinson-era MAIDEN inspired tune from this British band, very reminiscent of “2 Minutes To Midnight”. Instrumentally very solid with a plethora of good riffs, but lacking power vocally. From their 2006 EP Path To Glory.\n\nCeltic Legacy - “Live By The Sword”. More Dickinson-era MAIDEN worship, more in the midpaced style. The best vocal performance on this compilation by far with a huge, catchy chorus. Some excellent guitar work as well. Taken from the Irish band’s 2003 album Resurrection.\n\nVoltax - “Steel Maker”. Mexico’s VOLTAX contribute this short anthem about longing for the times of old a.k.a. the 80’s. Nothing about this track stands out, and is merely average overall. From their 2007 self titled album.\n\nIn Solitude - “Witches Sabbath”. A decent early KING DIAMOND approximation. Not nearly as vocally powerful as the King himself, and the riffs are a little lacking, but a worthy attempt at recreating a Fatal Portrait type atmosphere. A little derivative overall. From their 2008 self titled album.\n\nAll in all, if you are seeking something new and/or groundbreaking, then it’s best to skip this comp. But, if you’re looking for a fun, nostalgic listen with a handful of decent to great bands, then by all means grab this. My personal recommendation is to seek out the standalone releases of POWERVICE, RAM, ENFORCER, and CELTIC LEGACY.\n\nCAULDRON - Chained To The Nite (www.earache.com)\n\nWhat the hell? A band that formed in 2006 playing straight up, old school heavy metal-complete with a lurid album cover? Sadly, this retro stuff seems to be a big fad lately, whether it’s thrash (TOXIC HOLOCAUST, GAMA BOMB, among many, many others…) or just plain old heavy metal (BLACK TIDE, etc.). My main issue with this whole movement is a lack of originality for the sake of nostalgia. No doubt CAULDRON are expert players-especially guitarist Ian Chains-and these tunes aren’t bad per se, just highly unoriginal. Take “Chained Up In Chains” as an example. Horrible, horrible song title aside, the riffing seems like it was pretty much lifted form an early OZZY OSBOURNE album. Lyrically and vocally is where this record troubles me and is indicative of what I feel is a serious problem with these retro movements. Aside from resting on the laurels of others and using templates guaranteed to work, it feels like this is teetering on parody. The vocals on this record, performed by bassist Jason Decay, are painfully weak. I mean, there is no projection, no balls behind the performance. It’s just very thin and whispery. When I hear the vocals here, I think of when emo hipsters hear PREIST or MAIDEN for the first time and proceed to mercilessly mock said bands and the genre as a whole by doing half-assed, breathy, over-exaggerated impressions (see SUM 41’s “Pain For Pleasure”). And I guess if you’re musically stuck in the 80’s, then you might as well be lyrically stuck there as well. “Conjure The Mass”, as one example, is an unabashedly wanton narrative. The overall vibe I get from this listening experience is one of playful mockery, a “hey, look how cheesy we can be” feel. Maybe I’m wrong. I suppose what matters in the end is that, while unoriginal, and if taken at face value, this can be a fun little record. A good time headbanger you can put on in the background while you have friends over. Just don’t look for CAULDRON to advance the art of metal.\n\nTHE HAUNTED - Warning Shots (www.earache.com)\n\nIn the grand Earache tradition of NAPLAM DEATH’s Noise For Music’s Sake, CATHEDRAL’s The Serpents Gold and GODFLESH’s In All Languages (and these are only the ones I own), what you get here is a two disc retrospective of a band that has moved on from their roster. One “best of” disc and one “rare tracks” disc. Nothing much to say about disc one, the “best of”. Prime cuts from their first three albums-“Hate Song”, “Undead”, “Bury Your Dead”, “Hollow Ground”, “D.O.A.”, “Shithead”-they’re all there. All that really needs to be said is that this reinforces the fact that THE HAUNTED was a superior band on these albums and their most recent three records are nothing short of garbage (Funny how in the interview included in the booklet, bassist Jonas Bjorler tries to downplay these early releases). Disc two is what may be of interest to THE HAUNTED’s fans-the “rare tracks”. But compared to the aforementioned collections, this one is a touch light on truly rare tracks. The live tracks are simply pulled from their Live Rounds In Tokyo live album that, I believe, is not that rare. “Ritual”, “Creed”, and “Eclipse” are good tunes, but were bonus tracks on re-releases of albums that aren’t even out of print. The true rare gems here are the band’s interesting take on CANDLEMASS’ “Well Of Souls” (complete with a corny “Angel Of Death” reference) and the five demo/rehearsal tracks. Of those five tracks, the three rehearsal tracks-“Undead”, “Now You Know”, and “Blood Rust”-are of the most intriguing. Instrumental, far slower than their studio counterparts, and raw as fuck, they provide a glimpse into the infancy of this once great band. The two demo tracks-“Undead” (the third version on this compilation) and “Shattered” are rawer than the album versions, but are seething with hungry energy.\n\nI can only really recommend this to hardcore THE HAUNTED completionists, and maybe someone who’s never hear of THE HAUNTED. But I would sooner say to that person, “skip this, buy the first three records, and skip the last three”. This kind of reeks of cash grab.\n\nINSECT WARFARE-World Extermination (www.earache.com)\n\nHoly shit, this is fucking lethal. What we have here is Earache’s reissue of INSECT WARFARE’s one true full-length album (amid 2 EP’s, 2 demos, a handful of splits, and a limited one sided LP) and this kills. Not breaking the traditional grindcore mould for one second, INSECT WARFARE blasts, thrashes, and d-beats away like nobody’s business. The guitars are crusty, the bass is fuzzed out, and the vocals grunt, gurgle, and shriek-this is the way grind is supposed to be played! As always, short songs are the order of the day here with the longest one, “Manipulator”, clocking in at a mere, but potent 1:49 (the whole 20 song effort clocks in at 22:28, to put it in perspective). But this all should’ve been obvious when I said “traditional grindcore”. Look, you don’t buy a grind record for super proficient guitar scales, complex counterpoint, and mathematical polyrhythm-and that’s not to say that these guys are slouches. But you buy a grind record for unbridled, chaotic, punkish energy, and this is exactly what World Extermination brings to the table. This is no frills, pure grind. Not too much more needs to be said, other than this band would have been my pick to fill the void when NASUM split up (due to Mieszko Talarczyk’s untimely death), but it appears that INSECT WARFARE is also no longer active. A damn shame, if you ask me. NAPALM DEATH, NASUM, and PIG DESTROYER fans need to get their hands on this ASAP. Good stuff.\n\nMASTODON-Crack The Skye (repriserecords.com)\n\nMASTODON’s always been an enigmatic band, a smorgasbord of a wide variety of influences. Their progression from humble beginnings as a crushing technical/sludge/metalcore hybrid to their current prog-metal state has been interesting to observe and enjoyable to experience. Leviathan and Blood Mountain took me many repeated listens to fully grasp, but once it clicked, it was plain to see that MASTODON were innovators. Crack The Skye on the other hand, is MASTODON’s most accessible album, but is simultaneously their most ambitious and complex-a rare feat, especially from a major label band.\n\nThe vocal interplay of guitarist Brent Hinds and bassist Troy Sanders-and now incorporating drummer Brann Dailor-is the most impressive area of improvement here. These guys are now singing their asses off, with every word being heartfelt and intense. The only screamed vocals provided here are by perennial guest vocalist Scott Kelly (of NEUROSIS) on “Crack The Skye”. The lyrics tell an interesting and deep tale of astral projection. All this is a welcome surprise, as I’ve always thought of MASTODON primarily as an instrumental band with vocal sections. For the most part I still think that, but it seems on this outing that a lot more care was put into the vocal aspect. But that doesn’t mean one bit that they’ve slacked off instrumentally. The playing on Crack The Skye is absolutely on fire. Now, you might think that a prog-metal band “on fire” might mean notes flying all over that place in nonsensical fashion, but absolutely nothing could be further from the truth. There is no shortage of technical and complex riffing, but it never once enters “wank” territory-each note serves it’s purpose and is tastefully and carefully played. 10+ minute epic “The Czar” is by far the highlight of the album with it’s middle two sections of heavy, insane riffing sandwiched between two very ethereal, ambient, and organ heavy sections. The only time they go balls out crazy and unhinged is a 30 second section roughly six minutes into 13-minute monster “The Last Baron”. Guitar wise Hinds and Bill Kelliher play up their very unique and distinct style-heavy riffs, high legato licks, bluesy solos, and unusual chords. These guys are making a mark for themselves with each passing album, and should be recognized alongside some of the greatest guitar tandems in metal history. Sanders’ bass is a subtle, yet key ingredient to the mix-never overplayed but never understated. Dailor’s drumming style on this record caught me off guard-his trademark fast and fluid fill approach is surprisingly subdued here and his performance is overall quite restrained. He unleashes some of his signature fills, but only at the right time as opposed to all the time.\n\nExpertly produced by Brendan O’Brien, I cannot recommend this album enough. This is a dense and powerful listen, and as much as I’ve touched upon here, there’s still so much more to be explored. MASTODON has blown me away from my first encounter with them (live at the Relapse Records Contamination Festival in 2003), and they continue to impress. This is the best record of 2009 so far, and looks like a strong contender to close out the year with such honors. Seek out the special edition with the bonus DVD, which has two featurettes-one on the making of the album and one of track-by-track commentary by the band. These two pieces provide invaluable insight into Crack The Skye as well as MASTODON itself. What are you waiting for? Get your hands on this now.\n\nTHE BOY WILL DROWN-Fetish (www.earache.com)\n\nNeedlessly technical deathcore. Yay. These guys have all the chops in the world and yet they waste it on this fashion genre. I mean opener ‘Deep Throat” is just sweep arpeggio after sweep arpeggio, blast beats, jazzy contrapuntal basslines, breakdowns, and a indie rock-ish section all in a compact 2:36 linear song structure. “Dead Girls”, four songs later, is the exact same song with different sweep arpeggios, basslines, breakdowns and indie rock parts. These guys are expert musicians, but have no clue on how to put a song together. I had no idea I was three songs in until I glanced at my stereo. Everything just blends together-there’s no way to tell when one song ends and another begins without keeping your eyes fixated on your CD/MP3 player. THE BOY WILL DROWN tries too hard to do too many things at once and succeed at practically nothing. See the country-esque outro to “Josef Fritzl” as one example. I’m just astounded that a 29-minute album crammed with ideas can only have one that’s interesting. 31 second “Dance Like An Epileptic” has some cool, dissonant glissando riffs, and because it’s so short, it doesn’t wear out its welcome. Earache Records needs to do two things as restitution for this abomination against music. Firstly, delete this record from your catalog and pretend like it never even happened. And secondly, either drop this band or lock these kids down in a room with some recent CANNIBAL CORPSE, some old CRYPTOPSY, some GORGUTS, some DEATH from Human and beyond, some KRISIUN, MORBID ANGEL, and NILE, and don’t let them emerge until they know how to write a technical death metal song proper. Avoid this at all costs.\n\nLIVE REVIEW:\n\nESCAPE THE FATE/\n\nBLACK TIDE/WILLIAM CONTROL/ATTACK ATTACK! The Fillmore At Irving Plaza 2/21/2009\n\nMan, what a bizarre and disappointing show. To put it into perspective for you, I went to this show - which was one metalcore band, one commercial metal band with tons of potential, and two bands that cannot be called metal by any stretch of the imagination - to be surrounded by emo kids all night. And when I say emo kids, I really mean kids; at 29, I was probably one of the oldest people in the building who wasn’t a parent or venue staff. Yes, you read that right, there were parents taking their kids to this show.\n\nAs I approached the venue, I was simply astounded by the sheer amount of emo kids that wrapped around from the Irving Plaza’s entrance on 15th & Irving al the way to 16th & Union Sq. E. It was a long fucking line. What’s even more trippy is when these kids popped (“pop” in this context is pro wrestling jargon for an extremely positive crowd reaction) for a 90’s TV theme compilation played between BLACK TIDE’S and ESCAPE THE FATE’S sets. I don’t know, maybe it’s me, but I just have a problem with these misguided emo kids showing up at a show like this and thinking they’re real deal metalheads when they’ve probably never heard PANTERA (the ultimate starter metal band), let alone something more extreme, underground, and legitimate.\n\nOnto the music: I’m going to touch briefly on the two bands mentioned above as not metal: WILLIAM CONTROL and ESCAPE THE FATE. WILLIAM CONTROL went on second and I have to say, I was totally flabbergasted. Brace yourselves: A two-piece punk/new wave/goth/industrial/dance act. One lead singer, one bassist/backing vocalist, and a whole fuckton of prerecorded backing tracks. Drums, keys, guitars, backing vocals, all on tape. Personally, I don’t see the need for the bassist to be on stage,; if you’re going to have all that instrumentation on tape, why have the bass be live? Wouldn’t it make more sense aesthetically to have a lead guitarist on stage? Anyhow, I was not too impressed by the tunes, as it came across to me as a second rate ORGY. But the kids ate it up; especially the girls. I have never been to a show where girls are screaming their lungs out. It was extremely surreal, especially taking into account the audience’s average age.\n\nESCAPE THE FATE closed the night out, and if you’ve read my previous review of their This War Is Ours album., then you already know this band does not impress me. Their live show, while adequate and tight, did nothing to change my opinion. These guys had all the “right moves”, and while they looked like MOTEY CRUE (complete with Robert Ortiz’s Tommy lee-esque huge double bass drum kit), they sounded like THE USED. Not a good combination. I ended up staying for about 5 of their songs, and I just wasn’t feeling it at all. I opted to leave and beat the post-show rush out of the building and headed home.\n\nATTACK ATTACK! opened the show, and due to a bit of confusion on my part outside the venue (apparently, there is a separate line for the guest list, as opposed to general ticket holders), I only caught the second half of their set. I certainly did not feel like I missed anything, though. Run of the mill metalcore at it’s most banal, ATTACK ATTACK! utilized all of the gimmicky tricks generic metalcore bands use, and added zero innovation. Should I start with the monotone lead screaming vocals? How about the “classic” melodeath verse, punk chorus, and breakdown song structure? Maybe it’s the lack of guitar solos (or lead guitars in general) or the useless keys (used mostly for intros and outros and adding no substance to the bulk of the songs)? Either way, this band embodies mediocre. Even worse was the treated clean vocals. I can’t decipher by ear weather it was a vocoder or an auto tuner, but these vocals were definitely effected, every single second of their presence. They looked totally ridiculous on stage too, with both guitarists and the bassist doing an obviously rehearsed run-in-place maneuver. You can really tell they spent hours practicing this routine. I shook my head in shame that someone somewhere considers this legitimate metal. To my astonishment, the crowd was chanting “one more song” after their set. Maybe it’s me.\n\nBLACK TIDE was up third, and despite not being blown away on record, I walked away from this show with a decent amount of respect for this band. I know people think of this band as the beacons of a new generation championing a traditional, old school Metal sound, and they are on the right track to getting there, but they still have a lot of work to do. The material presented that night was a more rock /commercialized interpretation of traditional Metal, but there were plenty of riffs and passages with a strong NWOBHM and thrash influence. I attribute this to being young - the average age of its members is somewhere around 17. For dudes their age, they certainly have a handle on their instruments, as the overall level of musicianship was very high. Their stage presence echoes the days of old, opting to headbang as opposed to throwing themselves and jumping around like idiots. I chuckled when they went for the easy pop with a cover of METALLICA’S “Hit The Lights”, but they played it pretty well overall. The only point in their set which left a bad taste in my mouth was bassist Zachary Sandler’s constant pissing and moaning about the monitor mix, going so far as to kick a wedge during a hissy fit. I will not chalk this up to their age, as I’ve witnessed plenty of older, more established bands throw fits over the very same issue. I just personally feel that any musicians calling themselves “pro” should be able to adapt to any adverse situation without making the crowd aware of the problem. Roll with it man. I overall ended up thin"
