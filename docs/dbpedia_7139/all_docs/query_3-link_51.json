        "text": "Nasum (pronounced / ɴa: zum /) is a Swedish grindcore band from Örebro. The group has four albums> and separates after the death of the singer and guitarist Mieszko Talarczyk, victim of the tsunami of December 26, 2004 in Thailand. The name of the group is inspired by the horror film Flesh for Frankenstein (in French: De la viande pour Frankenstein). Nasum's texts deal mainly with social and political issues (anti-racism, anti-conformism, fight against misinformation, etc.).\n\nNasum was formed in 1992 in Örebro. The band's name is inspired by a replica from Paul Morrissey's film Flesh for Frankenstein. We can also hear this replica at the beginning of the title Blind World (present on the split of the same name and Grind Finale). They publish an EP, Industrislaven, produced by Dan Swanö>. In 1997, Nasum signed with Relapse Records and released his first studio album, Inhale / Exhale. They will then turn to the United States.\n\nTheir third album, Helvete, featuring Napalm Death's Shane Embury, was released in 2003, and welcomed by the trade press, and allowed them to become popular in the European circuit.\n\nThe members of the group separate after the death of the singer and guitarist Mieszko Talarczyk, victim of the tsunami of December 26, 2004 in Thailand. His death is confirmed only on February 17, 2005. A compilation, Grind Finale, is published in 2006 and a live album including their performance in Osaka, titled Doombringer, is released in early 2008. The group undertakes a series of festival concerts, followed by a headlining tour in 2012 to celebrate Nasum's 20th anniversary, pay tribute to Mieszko Talarczyk, and bid farewell to fans. On this occasion, the singer position is taken over by Keijo Niinimaa from Rotten Sound."
