        "text": "Escabroso, another recently formed and exciting mincecore/noisegrind band from Vermelho de Viamão, Brazil, present their second EP released on July 26th. Fittingly titled for the subject matter of the songs, Violência Revolucionária is released through DIY label Pinico Records, which has been putting out some other excellent stuff lately.\n\nWe’ve talked extensively here about the militant and harsh nature of Brazilian grindcore, and how this sonic angst is truly driven by the country’s long colonial history of brutal racism and subjugation, which destroyed and nearly eradicated many of the region’s indigenous cultures. And the post-colonial struggles that Brazil and other Latin American countries still face today are very much on display here, even more so than usual, with the band presenting a modern insurrectionist approach applicable to the current socio-political climate of the Global South as a whole.\n\nEven before you hear the songs and read their names and lyrics, you see the militant artwork, which depicts what appears to be a revolutionary fighter posing with a weapon while unsuspecting bystanders look on in amazement and probably fear. This in itself is a strong statement and goes further in the direction of similar bands from the country like Subcut, Social Chaos or veterans ROT—approaching new ways of fighting the all-encompassing and fluid post-industrial capitalist system. In this case, through decentralized and militant terror against the state and the owners of capital, of course, while still maintaining an intersectional perspective and having songs about LGBTQIA+ rights and defending all kinds of marginalized people who suffer from this system of greed. It’s all very well written lyrically and they seem to know their theory, which is not surprising.\n\nThe sound continues and expands the direction they took on their self-titled debut EP, and it is tight yet very aggressive and raw, often bordering on classic noisecore tropes. This ultra chaotic musical rage, especially for a second release, is actually recorded, mixed and played very well by DIY standards and not only. The vocals offer a variety of different growls and screams, the drums are almost impeccably timed and the constant onslaught of grind punk riffs leaves you wanting more—with a feeling of anticipation because you’ve just listened to a band at the beginning of their creative journey that already sounds so compact and good. And so you know that greater things are to come from Escabroso in the near future.\n\nIf you’re a noisecore/mince enthusiast with a passion for militant leftist lyrics and imagery, and want to quench your vampiric thirst for well-done grind, you’ve come to the right place and would definitely feel a breath of fresh air. Amidst all the mediocre, apolitical grindcore bands flooding the scene right now, especially in the Global North—with all the boring Nasum/Rotten Sound clones—Escabroso come to save us from dumbed-down copy bands with identical lyrics and sound."
