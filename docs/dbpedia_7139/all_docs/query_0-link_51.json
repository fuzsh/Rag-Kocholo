Within 5 minutes, guys will explain everything you need to know about noise/grind and violence! This is fucking pure aggression! Reeking Cross is a great example of how noisecore could sound If you use your brain a bit. This material is far from messy and shitty noisecores around, this duo has a ton of improvisations, but they know how to play it right. This fury stuff is truly gorgeous, with pissed-off screams, the bass is heavy as fuck (these vibrations are dreadful), the same with blastbeats (just … Continue reading Reeking Cross / Sangre De Idiotas\n\nDysmorfic / Glauco\n\nWould you believe me if I said Italy has a light jazz aftertaste? No? Only grindcore, powerviolence, and metal? But what if I prove to you that you’re wrong? And I will make it easy, with just 1 small split CD! Mastodonts of the Italian scene Dysmorfic are back to the listeners with a brand new noise. I found the definition “drum ‘n’ bass avangard grind jazz” on the internet, and I pretty much agree with it. This odd form of grinding mess is bringing joy, especially after hours of listening to death metal. Dysmorfic will smash your brain with … Continue reading Dysmorfic / Glauco\n\nButcher ABC – Maggots In Your Brain\n\nButcher ABC are back with a brand new single “Maggots In Your Brain”! This is a small but lovely tape… a pretty DIY release, simple, but with a nice design. Especially I love these rubber maggots, ahaha! The guys also made a small joke 1 side is for Butcher ABC and the B side is ABC Butcher… So we have here 2 versions of 1 song (Maggots In Your Brain)… This slab is loaded with meaty rhythms and grinding tremolo-picked riffs. The guitar sound is damn good, and the same with the bass, guys are making really old-fashioned noise. But … Continue reading Butcher ABC – Maggots In Your Brain\n\nDurian / Kandarivas\n\nShit, here we go again! A super blasting US/Japanese grind collision in one small bag! Durian proved that “it’s not always sunny in Philadelphia”, sometimes there is precipitation in the form of blastbeats. This short recording is a straight punch in the face. Wonderful meal with a grindcore flavor that mixes in powerviolence (garnish) groove, power, and buzzsaw riffing. Except for barbarian anger, some songs have nice punk vibes. This work has also a nice old-fashioned drum sound, and all of that with harsh vocals is delivering a real grind insanity to the listeners! Kandarivas are here with 5 ferocious … Continue reading Durian / Kandarivas\n\nSkullhog / Violation Wound\n\nOur regular section “old but gold”. Finally, 8 years after CD release this split has got another run! FatAss rec released this material again but in a one-sided Picture Disc (nice looking stuff btw)! Almost 20 minutes together included 2 ”Bloodsoaked Zombie Torment” & ”Gateways Of Eibon” songs from Skullhog and 5 tracks from Chris Reifer’s Death / Punk Violation Wound band! And yes, the music is 100% matching this barbarian bloody red cover art! Almost 10 minutes of deep and thunderous sound and vibrations. From start to finish this bloody mess is leaking into my ears. For someone, this … Continue reading Skullhog / Violation Wound\n\nControlled Existence – Out Of Control\n\nFrom Prague with grind! Today I want to talk and share my opinion about the first full-length of Controlled Existence. This is my not-first exposure to the band, I know these guys well (I made a couple of reviews of their old material in the past)… but I`m freaking happy that guys finally managed to put their stuff and time together and record a damn album, haha! Must admit, that the boys gave everything to this work… this is not only pleasant noise for your ears, but also eye candy. Freaking badass cover art with a number of elements, colors, … Continue reading Controlled Existence – Out Of Control\n\nAgathocles – The Conquest Of Patagocles\n\nHhmmm, this is interesting, and pretty unique stuff from AG. Here is some info to help you get into this record. All basic instruments were recorded on 9th February 2019 in Puerto Natales, Patagonia, Chile (by AG trio, of course). This recording gathered dust in the archives and waited for its time, and that finally happened with the help of Archagathus. The second guitars and extra bass were recorded sometime in 2020 by Joe. Lead vocals and final mixing and mastering by Dan… Everything was ready at the end of 2022. Personally, I call this sick collaboration Archatocles, hahaha! And … Continue reading Agathocles – The Conquest Of Patagocles\n\nKandarivas – Grind Surgical Shrine\n\nKandarivas are celebrating the 5th anniversary of the 1st EP “Grind Surgical Shrine”! Of course, all this time this band has evolved, but the debut stuff still sounds badass. It’s worth considering that we are talking about a fairly old record, so… First thing first, the visual side of this CD looks freaking smashing… the artist gave everything to this art. As for the physical release, must admit that Obliteration Records did a good job, and this release came up truly well. Talking about Kandarivas, these guys started almost 10 years ago, and they are alive proof that you can … Continue reading Kandarivas – Grind Surgical Shrine\n\nDysmorfic – To Defy The Laws Of Grindcore\n\nItalian jazz weirdos are back! This CD was released just a few days ago, so it is still hot. So what do we have here this time? Hmmm, this is a short EP (8 minutes isn’t enough for the min-album, right?), which was recorded in cooperation with C. Roversi. And yeah, this shit is mindblowing! I will agree, this CD has a minimalistic design, but darn bright noise inside, and now let’s crack a cold one and put this stuff into our old and rotten player! With years of rehearsing, and playing live, wild experiments, and many other things, the … Continue reading Dysmorfic – To Defy The Laws Of Grindcore\n\nLast Bong of Humanity – Hymns Of Indigestible Munchies\n\nThis one will be short, so here is a debut EP of blasting goregrind one-man band from Kaiserslautern, Germany. Obviously, this project was made for fun, and it doesn’t claim the title of the most philosophical release of the year, (last bong, lol, what a name :). This is a damn short EP, but it has a few nice tunes. After a nice intro, the music hits hard. An absolutely annoying drum machine is taking almost everything (like in most of the gorenoise projects, for example), but I still can catch some primitive and nasty riffs, which is nice. The … Continue reading Last Bong of Humanity – Hymns Of Indigestible Munchies\n\nTrip to OEF and back! 25th anniversary festival report!\n\nThe Obscene Extreme festival 2024 delivered a powerhouse lineup that catered to lovers of extreme music. On day one, Trucido, Devourment, and Dropdead set a high standard with their intense performances, showcasing raw energy and brutal sounds that left the audience in awe. Day two only intensified the experience, particularly with French grind outfit Whoresnation delivering a riveting and memorable set, while Walking Corpses paid a tribute to Brutal Truth with a full first album performance! Siege, accompanied by special guest Mark “Barney” Greenway, brought a solid performance, and Napalm Death closed the day for me with their signature loud … Continue reading Trip to OEF and back! 25th anniversary festival report!\n\nHaveri – The End\n\nDespite them having been around for over a decade, this marks my first exposure to Haveri. So we have here a great album of raw and caveman d-beat music. Let’s say that dispunk phenomenon hit hard Swedish land. You won’t find anything modern or fancy here… Guys did their best to make music with old-school vibe. The layout is all in black and white and there’s not much to it. A few band photos on the back, short general info etc, the lyrics are included (it’s in English so there is no need to struggle with translation). “The End” is … Continue reading Haveri – The End\n\nMeat Spreader – Mental Disease Transmitted By Radioactive Fear\n\nThe spring of 2024 was hot… there were so many good albums and splits, actually, we ever got a few very expected releases. And a second full-length of Meat Spreader among them. This masterpiece consists of 15 disgusting songs, all with monstrously heavy sounds. “Mental Disease Transmitted By Radioactive Fear” is a cursed hell train that is going to take your soul. All of that is wrapped in a nice cover with characters that easily could be seen in Lucio Fulci movies. This album was released in Poland (by Behind the Mountain, and Lifestage Production) and Japan (by Obliteration Records), … Continue reading Meat Spreader – Mental Disease Transmitted By Radioactive Fear\n\nAbortion / Sedem Minút Strachu\n\nLook what we have here, a Slovakian double trouble is lying on our turntable right now. I believe that was just a matter of time, this split must happen. For those who see this split for the first time, Abortion are grindcore veterans. Sedem Minút Strachu are younger, but they already become a solid noisegrind brick in the Slovakian underground scene… and now this 20-minute journey is beginning! I am familiar with almost all discography of Abortion… without a doubt, these guys are European legends! This recording session has a strong tracklist, 14 songs of aggressive old-school material. As you’d … Continue reading Abortion / Sedem Minút Strachu\n\nSeptic Nausea – Abrupt Disfigurement\n\nMexica and gore genre is like an inseparable concept. Just a short time ago my mailman gave me a new pack from Surrogate rec, and I found this EP there. Must admit, today we have absolutely disgusting noise violence, but that is the main point and appointment of gorenoise! Behind this photo of the disfigured head remains is hiding something horrible. I think I can single out 3 main components of this vulgar mess. This is a pitch-shifted vocal with a nice vomit style, annoying drums, and pulsating noise in the background… All together those still will torture your ears … Continue reading Septic Nausea – Abrupt Disfigurement\n\nExecrable – From Cave To Slave\n\nLast fall, a young band from New Yourk state release a very interesting tape. Yeah, I’m talking about Execrable. With this release this duo put a serious pressure on the listener. But the noise is not the main point of this small cassette, just look at this design! Freaking A! Interesgting gloomy art, not standard cardboard box, and a small poster. This is an eye candy for all collectors! But does the sound match the visuals? 26 tracks are clocking in at just 16 minutes… Guys serve the listeners with chunky deathgrind with heavy riffing and rotten blastbeats. Beyond that, … Continue reading Execrable – From Cave To Slave\n\nCimiterium / Slavery\n\nTo be sort, today’s split is a relentless attack of massive Australian and Czech stench/crust invasion with a solid portion of metal tossed into the mix! The first EP of Melbourne band Cimiterium was damn good, but now the guys are back with a new split! Looking at the front, I must say, that guys didn’t disappoint me, this stuff is bloody good! The guitar tone is fucking huge, the drums are resonant, the bass thuds away in the center, and the vocals sound great as well. It’s just a thick, fucking destructive recording… As for the song (Monetized Outrage), … Continue reading Cimiterium / Slavery\n\nGodstomper / Mormon Mincers\n\nIf I can say much about Godstomper, unfortunately, I can’t do the same with Mormon Mincers. This band is new to me. But believe me, there’s a lot of furious intensity going on with both band’s songs! Mormon Mincers is a two-head mincing grindcore formation from SF Bay Area, California. Guys are making hyperactive grindcore with a nice mince touch! I love the buzzing sound of the guitar, that’s a pleasant point. The drums also sound quite good too, with a more or less old-fashioned sound. The whole production is not brilliant, but it is good enough to enjoy the … Continue reading Godstomper / Mormon Mincers\n\nRudeThing / Sutge\n\nOne of our functions is to highlight not famous releases, made by small bands. We believe that stuff like that deserves more attention. For today’s write-up, we prepared a split tape with two nice bands of hot and beautiful Spain! Right from Palma, a wicked grinding hardcore – RudeThing! Hmm, his material is for those who love uncommon style, not cloned music, if you know what I mean. It’s hard to describe this rude mess. All songs are crafted well, with a drop of rawness in the sound. Riffs are fast enough, and drums mostly have a middle tempo, and … Continue reading RudeThing / Sutge\n\nOppenheimer Terror – Sempre Guerra\n\nBarcelona what a magnificent town! With great architecture, history, and music scene. Last year Oppenheimer Terror released their debut EP, and today we’ll talk about it. As you may know, the Spanish crust scene differs in its rough sound and energy… But that’s why I like it, and now let’s analyze the consequences of this nuclear-sound disaster. “Sempre Guerra” could be described as a caveman crust for tough punks, ha! The energy of this small tape is damn pleasant… chainsaw tone of the guitar feels like a cold beer after a long and hard day. Simple but infectious distorted riffs … Continue reading Oppenheimer Terror – Sempre Guerra\n\nTrachoma / Yakisoba: Born Headless\n\nThe corpse of this split has some time to decompose… but like with wine, a good goregrind only improves with time. Today everything is simple… One solid representative of Brazilian seen and one of Italian. Two nice bands with ambitions and good prospects. And I’ll start with Trachoma and their latest session. This sick material has a titanic power! Everything is right on point here. The drums, the guitars, and the vocals all work together to create songs supercharged with primal, visceral energy. This is not a super-blasting kind of gore, but I can assure you that Trachoma found a … Continue reading Trachoma / Yakisoba: Born Headless\n\nCancrum Oris – Lymphadenitis Organopexic Vulnus Edema\n\nCancrum Oris is a gore project from Indonesia… to be honest I lost track of this band, but remember their first promo. Now guys are back with a brand new piece “Lymphadenitis Organopexic Vulnus Edema”. This slab of rot has 50 (holy shit!) songs of nasty and noisy goregrind. But this release has not only a music side, let’s look at the cover art. Actually, I loved that guys didn’t use a classical collage, or just a single photo of the dead body… this driving is made by the hand of an artist, without any AI bullshit. I think it’s … Continue reading Cancrum Oris – Lymphadenitis Organopexic Vulnus Edema\n\nBurning Flag – Matador\n\nI’ll be honest with you, this is my first time listening to Burning Flag (on the other hand, it will make this review completely unbiased). So it’s UK-based d-beat/hardcore and that provides an interesting noise. This material has a monstrous old-school vibe… But that is obvious because the UK is the motherland of many extreme genres (especially punk and hardcore). So let’s put this wax on my old turntable and see if Burning Flag could surprise me, hehe! Let’s start with the sound… it’s thick and heavy with a nice punch, but it’s also easy on the ears. This is … Continue reading Burning Flag – Matador\n\nImund​í​cie – Kolaps Civilizace\n\nToday’s band is from Brazil… Imund​í​cie are making nihilistic and primitive goregrind with noisecore touches. This squad consists of the former members of bands such as Vômito, Traqueomalacia, and Neoplasm Disseminator. After some EPs, guys finally put their guts together and recorded a first full-length. And today we’re going to cut this album into tiny bloody pieces! “Kolaps Civilizace” is a really barbaric album, haha! The guys managed to create 100% primitive brutality… I know that Brazilian grinders love dirty sound, but I guess they overdone here. The whole sound image turns into a rotten mess, not sure if Imund​í​cie … Continue reading Imund​í​cie – Kolaps Civilizace\n\nSkiplife / Fuck On The Beach\n\nIt’s been a while since we got a powerviolence release on our menu. Without any additional words, a super powerful split with Czech amigos Skiplife, and Japanese monsters Fuck On The Beach! Believe me, the songs from both bands are unique to this release, and they put fast brutality on a new level! Skiplife jumped up 4 years ago, I know that guys are always working hard, and that has its results. Songs of this band come with a great production and dose of anger. All songs are made in the same style but still differ… The buzzing madness of … Continue reading Skiplife / Fuck On The Beach\n\nFeind – Moloch\n\nI freaking love our small underground… grindheads can find like-minded people even in small towns. Such people gather together, 1 or 3 beers and we have a new band! Today I want to share with you that case, a band from Bochum (population of 372,348. Feind released this debut LP last fall, don’t know how long they were finding the label, but I am glad that they have had success! Halenoise Records released this noise as a one-sided record… and on the flip side they made a print. This stuff looks so badass, damn! Ah yes, pay attention to the … Continue reading Feind – Moloch\n\nCurse Crøss – Imminent Death\n\nWhile listening to the subject of today’s write-up, I’ve made up my mind, that I caught something familiar, a tiny trace of style… and I was right because behind this unit there are people who have been in the scene for decades, and made a lot for Singaporean grind scene. “Imminent Death” is damn short, but this surely expresses everything that the band what to show the listener. Every track shows that Curse Crøss are skillful musicians, hands down! These guys are mixing raw energy with solid and wicked riffs! The songs are a frenetic explosion of chainsaw guitar tone … Continue reading Curse Crøss – Imminent Death\n\nSickrecy / Barren\n\nI would say that the grindcore genre is mostly separated into two paths… one people are still playing old-school grindcore, with roots from the late 80th and gold 90th, but the second half is more open for experiments, you can call that modern grind. Today we have an interesting split with two absolutely different squads. So let’s begin! Swedish Sickrecy masterfully conveys the old-school spirit of the genre into their sound, injected with small shots of crust, and death metal. These dudes are very experienced, so they gathered all the ideas and slammed them together, heating and melting them into … Continue reading Sickrecy / Barren\n\nPainful Defloration – The Typewriters\n\nThat is damn unexpected, but the Ukrainian grind brigade Painful Defloration jumper out with a brand new album… actually I thought that this band was done many years ago, but I was wrong. So the concept of the band has changed in a better way, as I see everything was crafted and recorded by Alex (so you can call PxDx a one-man band). The style of the cover art reminds me previous album, nothing fancy but not bad work. This CD looks pretty standard, but flip it and you will see a badass pit-art, which is rare nowadays! As I … Continue reading Painful Defloration – The Typewriters\n\nAnatomia / Kandarivas – Omatsuri Jigoku\n\nWhat could be better than two nice bands in one release? Well, just two rough bands from Japan in one tape split! These guys present two sides of extreme music genres… Anatomia will show you how to make a slathering death metal and Kandarivas will finish you with solid experimental grindcore. And that madness is wrapped with a wonderful paper cover, Noxious Ruin rec knows how to make top-notch designs! So let’s begin this deal! Oh boy, Anatomia’s song simply nailed me, haha! Guys created an abnormiouse, dark, and super evil song… this 12-minute trip will take you into the … Continue reading Anatomia / Kandarivas – Omatsuri Jigoku\n\nPsycho / Holy Cost\n\nWhat in the name of Satan could hide behind such wicked cover art? Let’s find out! The first band is damn huge… These guys are titans in the underground. Boston legends perform with only two songs, but that is enough to annihilate you! Grinding punk at its best, that’s how 40 years of experience sounds like! Brutal, nasty, and aggressive… that’s what Psycho is! Primitive riffs like a good sweet vine, rhythm section here is damn good. Must admit, this trio knows how to evoke the right emotions in you and force you to bang your head off, haha! Can’t … Continue reading Psycho / Holy Cost\n\nSocial Chaos / Bestial Vomit\n\nToday I have a messy and noisy split for you, boys and girls. If the Social Chaos is quite famous (and is currently preparing for their Japanese tour), the guys from Bestial Vomit, have always been in the shadows. SC is well known crust-grind amigos, BV is a project with members worldwide, so their noise differs according to line-up changes. Interesting fact, there is no order in the song section. The tracks of both bands are mixed… hmm, interesting decision. So Social Chaos sounds rough, with heavy energy and a damn good death metal touch. This a literally sound road … Continue reading Social Chaos / Bestial Vomit\n\nBarren / VomitSpell\n\nDue to some circumstances, I got this release with a big delay. The label managed to create a true eye candy, I bet that all fans of physical release drooling on it. This split is the first in the Noxious Ruin rec “Grindbox” series. “Every tape comes inside of a beautifully laser-etched tin box, perfectly sized for all kinds of delinquent goods that grinders enjoy. It also includes a fully screenprinted maltese foldout cover, a double-sided 8×10 insert on an opaque clear cassette shell”. Cool isn’t it? I love it when people make not just regular stuff, this is more … Continue reading Barren / VomitSpell\n\nFuxache / Agathocles\n\nFunny fact, it’s been a while since we reviewed something with Agathocles (actually it’s been a year, wow). So let’s fix that shit… for this review, I picked up a nice piece. AG is not needed in the introduction but Fuxache is… So this is a band from Australia (Darvin city), they jumped into our grind community 5 years ago, and since then they released a few 7″. An interesting fact is that they have and ex-member of Egrogsid in their pack. I remember their previous split, but this stuff is something different. Guys still playing grind punk, but this … Continue reading Fuxache / Agathocles\n\nNyctophagia – The War Against Music Continues!\n\nMust admit, Nyctophagia is a damn productive project, and here we go again, a new EP. But this time it’s not a typical grind/gore mass… this time Dylan put on his old punk shirt and recorded some interesting material. But we will analyze everything in detail later. This 3″CD (damn, fucking love this format) has a nice cover with a crust rat that is ripping apart Magrudergrinds record, haha! That is a nice beginning, I like it when people use some humor in their work… So, as I told you before this session has a good old punk spirit, but … Continue reading Nyctophagia – The War Against Music Continues!\n\nMutated Sex Organ – Abyss of Flesh\n\nOhio’s MSO ripped apart the listeners with their debut work… I remember that album, that was like “holy shit, wtf was that?!”. But the boys didn’t think to stop, and here we go again, the second album of this wicked duo is out. Grand Vomit rec kindly allowed us to make an autopsy of this nice CD. So this time we have 26 dead bodies (aka songs), that are served under disgusting rotten souse. This smelly burrito is wrapped up with a well-crafted gory cover-up, I must say this time guys jumped above their own heads… this shit looks so … Continue reading Mutated Sex Organ – Abyss of Flesh\n\nMindcollapse / Archagathus\n\nAfter a few years of waiting and here is it! 7″that full of nice raw and buzzing tunes… from one side Spanish grinders Mindcollapse, from the other well-known Canadian mince maniacs Archagathus! In my opinion, this is a great example of how extreme music should sound. And I hope that more of you will dig this release, so let’s start in order, first on the line is Mindcollapse! Harsh, primitive and wicked, that’s how I can describe this stuff. Great grindcore with crust notes, that have an honest shaggy sound. Short songs, fast riffs, and pumping energy, that how it … Continue reading Mindcollapse / Archagathus\n\nPosthumous Regurgitation – The Coroner’s Guide to Cadaveric Cuisine\n\nGuess who is back on track? This spring US brigade Posthumous Regurgitation released their brand new album! The guys were silent for some time, and I’m really happy to hear their new stuff! And like the first material, we have here a nasty splattering material. Nine pieces of mutilated pathological goregrind and a General Surgery cover to finish this story! Btw this dreadful cover artwork is made by Albert Che, that guy caught everything right! This record will drag you down to the abyss of the filthy riffs and putrid sound. The first cut on this corpse is “Surgeon’s Remorse”, … Continue reading Posthumous Regurgitation – The Coroner’s Guide to Cadaveric Cuisine\n\nSonic Poison – Grinded Leftovers\n\nAfter a solid and loud album, our Finnish friends Sonic Poison are back with a new EP! So for this deal guys recorded 8 new songs of good buzzing stuff! Like this band’s previous releases, “Grinded Leftovers” has great old roots… All fans of moldy deathgrind will be pleased, I assure you! Right for this moment we have only a tape release (that was released on two continents), but I heard that guys are looking for a label to release this material as 7″ (I hope they will succeed). And now let’s roll these gears of violence! I won’t say … Continue reading Sonic Poison – Grinded Leftovers\n\nGrist – Garden Of Aeolvs\n\nFrance has an interesting underground… half of the bands play dark kind of metal hardcore/crust, and half are traditional orienteering bone-crushing grindcore. I think that Grist is somewhere between these. This is not a young band, guys have been making noise for 10 years (or so?), but they only have one 7″ in the discography. Unfortunately, there is not much info about this squad from Paris. So let’s focus on the album. I know that guys worked hard and painstakingly on this album. LP, CD and tapes Guys got a deal with Source Atone Records and Dies Irae Productions to … Continue reading Grist – Garden Of Aeolvs\n\nŁeb Prosiaka – Pigstrek\n\nPolish space cowboys, Łeb Prosiaka strikes back! Pigstrek is their 3 album, and I must admit this album pleasantly surprised me. We got 16 songs and 30 minutes of wonderful and cheerful music for grind perverts! These guys have more than 20 years of experience, so they know how to grind. But before we start, I would love to highlight the cover art of this record… this funny tribute to Star Track looks ridiculously good, haha! That is a nice joke that will trigger all S.T. fans. From the very first riffs, I recognize a brand sound of that nation. … Continue reading Łeb Prosiaka – Pigstrek\n\nUrbicyd – S/T\n\nWe got a new band in our small family! Urbicyd is a fresh project from Wroclaw, but the people behind it have a lot of experience, they played in Infekcja, Gilotyna, Zatrata, Skorupa. We have here a nice example of the crust genre. The boys followed the classic path… simple riffs, highly social lyrics, d-beat, more d-beat, and pretty actual cover art (the religion bullshit is a big pain in the ass in Poland). And now let’s listen to the subject of today’s write-up. This EP is pretty ambitious. Drums hit hard, frenetic guitars and bass shred through your mind … Continue reading Urbicyd – S/T\n\nHarmony Fault – Gore Beyond Blood\n\n“Gore Beyond Blood” is definitely the sound of Harmony Fault progressing and maturing as a band. This is their 3d studio album in 22 years (yep these guys are old). I want to highlight the final production of this work. Generally, the sound became more dense and low, and riffs have more variety… but, this band still has its primitive brutality charm, haha! This album is definitely for those who love groovy music. You know what you’re going to get going into this album: a mixture of sick, old-fashioned gore riffs up against mid-paced groovy rhythms, more heavily dependent on … Continue reading Harmony Fault – Gore Beyond Blood\n\nAdrestia / Collapsed\n\nThis split LP is definitely the sound of the genre that I needed today… From the cold shores of Sweden – Adrestia. From the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, specifically from Canada – Collapsed. These bands will show you different sides of one genre. Both have unique sound and materials. But that info won’t tell you anything, we need to dive deep into both bands and get into all dark corners, so let’s begin! Band #1 – Adrestia. This Swedish trio surprised me a lot. The opening song is “The Ghosts Of Mariupol”, it means to me a lot … Continue reading Adrestia / Collapsed\n\nFuxache / KLF\n\nWhat do you associate with this cover art? Disgusting music? Raw sound? You’re very close! Recently I got a parcel from far away land, from Australian shores… And the first 7″ that picked up from it is a split with Aussie Fuxache an Indonesian KLF, both bands are playing different types of noise, and now it’s time to inspect this small release! I think I can say that the music of Fuxache is based on regular standards. But guys making the focus on emotions, not on the tech side of play, and I fucking love it. Maybe this production is … Continue reading Fuxache / KLF\n\nMorgue Tar – Diegested\n\nBassNgore duo Morgue Tar is back with a brand new album! Unlike previous work “Diegested” sounds more familiar, it’s like “back to the roots” stuff. But I want you, you need to be prepared for these 11, because that dose of noise can leave you deff, haha! Guys were really prepared for this album, they even asked Pierre (Brain Dead zine) to make them a cover art. And when you see art from that guy, be sure, you will hear tough shit! This nice-looking bloody mess totally represents the whole album, from A to Z… First of all, this music … Continue reading Morgue Tar – Diegested\n\nMordloch -S/​T\n\nLet’s take out a cat from the bag, today I have something really heavy for you all. Let’s talk about Mordloch and its debut album. This band is located in Kolin, a small town near Prague… I find it very cool, that not only big cities can produce new bands. I think this band deserves better attention, and here is why… Well, apart from the punchy first riffs, the first thing you hear is well-played fast drumming and good riffing. The tracks are damn tight and fast and the time changes are spot on. The vocals are the perfect blend … Continue reading Mordloch -S/​T\n\nSpewtum – Obsessive Repulsive\n\nLet’s talk about disgusting tunes… only today, for your attention I present you the latest album of Spewtum! This is a project of one guy from Vermont, he was also in charge of the Fentanyl Surprise band (remember that one?). So I briefly went through the discography and must say that this album is one of my favorites. Of course, we have here a disgusting cover art, disgusting noise, and so on, but this is truly nice and cheerful material, that will make you happy, haha! I think the formula of “Obsessive Repulsive” is very simple, Steve just put together … Continue reading Spewtum – Obsessive Repulsive\n\nFlesh Prison – Who Benefits?\n\nShame on me but I discovered Flesh Prison just last year. These guys are from Western Australia and guess what? Yes, they play a grindcore, ha! After the demo, the guys worked hard on new stuff, and I must say, the result is fabulous. “Who Benefits?” has only 13 songs, but believe me, that is more than enough to annihilate your mind, I will return to this in a bit. After a close look, I found that this record is made in maxi-single format (which is good for the sound). Also, this LP has a pretty simple design, but don’t … Continue reading Flesh Prison – Who Benefits?\n\nJetsam / Gummo\n\nFor today’s review, we have an elegant split with Canadian Jetsam and French Gummo. Both bands are a bit complicated with their genres, but both well extreme and loud… Let’s dig deeper into the noise, I bet we’ll find something interesting! The first on the line are Jetsam (which are new for me). The first thing you hear is a well-played and strangely distorted guitar sound, nice simple riffing, and a sweet heavy crunchy sound (it really has a bass guitar sound). I think this noise fits more into powerviolence subgenre… Can’t say that guys used a lot of a … Continue reading Jetsam / Gummo"
