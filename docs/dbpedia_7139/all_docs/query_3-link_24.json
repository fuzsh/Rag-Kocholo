Hear the screams from the dying race.. The flames feed the holocaust as radiation burns The wind of devastation turns the world into ashes Hell is awaiting us as we realize Earth is no paradise, no paradise for the damned Death. Hear the screams from the dying race..\n\n5.\n\nWrath 02:14 video\n\nUnder submission for a long time For a thousand years My soul is starting to rot My work is done here I've shed my share of blood, sweat and tears I'm leaving this melting pot You come to stop me To convince me that I can't escape I'm tired of being your rat Armored with reasons, threats and lies But It's much too late I'm about to unleash my wrath I won't accept this life A victim of your oppression To be enslaved and sell my soul to the other side Never be your fucking puppet I've tasted your fist And felt your whip burning on my skin I have dealt with the pain The more you hit the more you fuel The anger is boiling within Your failure I will sustain I've been your workhorse And now it's time for this horse to kick your head I'm pounding my way out So step aside, get out of my way If not you'll end up dead Or at least know what true pain is about I won't accept this life A victim of your oppression To be enslaved and sell my soul to the other side Never be you puppet on a string I won't accept this life And fall into a dark depression To be a slave, cast in chains, always forced to hide Buried under bricks of guilt I have tasted your fist I have dealt with the pain Rip my back with your whip The pain is my gain I won't accept this life A victim of your oppression To be enslaved and sell my soul to the other side Never be your puppet on a string I won't accept this life And fall into a dark depression To be a slave, cast in chains, always forced to hide Buried under bricks of guilt\n\n6.\n\nFear Is Your Weapon 00:43\n\nVoice of hate spreads its wings Moves quickly through the air Fueled by greed it sows its seed In weakness and despair Bit by bit, makes you scared shit Of life in \"poverty\" Just like acid it consumes All morale and dignity Fear is your weapon, it's the key Without it your rule's dead Hate's the glue to seal it all Your defense's now complete To strike first and to strike hard It is your recipe Your voice of hate starts trembling Your doom soon you will meet\n\n7.\n\nThe Deepest Hole 01:47\n\nDo what you want but don't come near You don't want to see what it's like in here The deepest hole you'll ever see Right in front of you - Inside of me Keeping my cool but there's a war inside my head All living things around me seem to be dead Looking forward to a day that's coming sooner than you know When my ego takes over and lets all my blood flow Follow me down and you will see That self destruction sets me free The longer the way, the harder the fall And down on the bottom you will see me crawl Keeping my cool but there's a war inside my head All living things around me seem to be dead Looking forward to a day that's coming sooner than you know When my ego takes over and lets all my blood flow\n\n8.\n\nHigh On Hate 00:40\n\nYour pack of wolves is out for blood and looking for an easy pray To fight and slay the innocent, agenda of today So you hate, hate, hate, hate and then you hate some more And then you kick him in the head So you're getting high on hate and violence Looking for a quick fix to get off Never looking back just fall into the ignorance And devote yourself to terror Concrete jungle emperor, you rule your pack with ball and chain You will never stay to rest until some punks are slain So you hit, hit, hit, hit and then you hit some more Until the poor fucker's dead\n\n9.\n\nPathetic 01:22\n\nBorn into this nothingness With the sole goal - to succeed Life hangs by a single thread As we are trying not to feel But to gather all we can Out of proportion to our need To hide within our deepest nests And to never ever give Dead faces Breathing through it's meaningless Aggravated existence From dusk to dawn you spin in shit Your only skill's persistence So you gather all you can Out of proportion to our need To hide within our deepest nests And to never ever give We're robbing We're rotting We're hurting We're feeling At last we feel\n\n10.\n\nCircle of Defeat 01:10\n\nA race of rapists, seeing to its needs Gathering with no control Community on speed - Circle of defeat Overpopulated by the human breed On the verge of collapse Too many mouths to feed - Circle of defeat Preparing for the last dance One thousand points to prove - With hate..

Scorched by flames, from the burning cold Mental ice-age, reality postponed When all is said and done, what will be left of you? All signs point toward regression None show the width of their obsession ...the undeniable truth... So weak, so forgotten and so forfeit Without conscience and without faith No beliefs to call your own, their origin remains unknown No equality in present day There's been no progress made You're still here to produce and to consume No equality in present state There's been no progress made And we're all still their slaves Shocking truth, deliverer of pain Better start to move, don't just sit down and drown in shame ...of not doing anything... When the seas calm down But only then will our fury finally sleep Until then this whip will deal out its lashes constantly No equality in present state There's been no progress made And we're all still their slaves And we're all still their slaves\n\n20.\n\nFight Terror With Terror 02:26\n\nIt looks so hard To lie straight into their eyes Just like a robot Only colder, your circuits have been burned I see you walk through fake fires For those you say you love Their hopes built upon a pile of lies Craving justice be done All praise to our mighty leader Self-proclaimed servant of truth The bearer of this holy sword Decapitating the youth I see you walk through fake fires For those you say you love Their hopes built upon a pile of lies Craving justice be done Fight terror with terror...\n\n21.\n\nEtt Inflammerat SÃ¥r 00:58\n\nVÃ¤gen som du valt Ã¤r krokig, skev och sÃ¤mst Ett steg framÃ¥t, tvÃ¥ steg bakÃ¥t, sen faller du ihop Alla bara garvar och du stÃ¥r dÃ¤r och skÃ¤ms Kan inte vara lÃ¤tt att vara vÃ¤rldens idiot Ett inflammerat sÃ¥r Din jÃ¤vla politik stinker ett ruttet lik Ett inflammerat sÃ¥r Vi lÃ¤ngtar efter dagen dÃ¥ du ruttnar i graven\n\n22.\n\nDeleted Scenes 02:34\n\nSurprise, surprise Now you see through all the lies It is there before your eyes The degradation of human lives Is truth on display In papers and on the news today?
