        "text": "This is the third album from Finnish death metallers Concrete Winds.\n\nConcrete Winds is a 25-minute monstrosity that bleeds violence from every infected pore. It’s abrasive and hateful, yet carries with it more depth and substance than you’d probably expect; Concrete Winds seem to know what they’re doing. Continue reading “Concrete Winds – Concrete Winds (Review)”\n\nCloset Witch are a grindcore band from the US and this is their second album.\n\nSometimes, you just need to GRIIIIIINNNND. But not just any kind of grind; no, sometimes you need to grind and burn with the sort of visceral, idiosyncratic grind that leaves scars. For times like that, you have a band like Closet Witch. Continue reading “Closet Witch – Chiaroscuro (Review)”\n\nThis is the second album from US grindcore band Organ Dealer.\n\nIt’s been a very long time since Organ Dealer’s 2015 debut album Visceral Infection, but the quality of that release has stuck with me. So, when The Weight of Being appeared, I was ready for it. Continue reading “Organ Dealer – The Weight of Being (Review)”\n\nThis is the debut album from US grindcore band Slugcrust.\n\nContaining two members of WVRM, Ecocide contains 22 minutes of mayhem and carnage, the way they used to make it, but rarely do anymore. Well, Slugcrust do, and they do it very well. Continue reading “Slugcrust – Ecocide (Review)”\n\nThis is the third album from UK grindcore band Human Cull.\n\nSomehow I missed this when it came out in January, so the fact that it’s now had a vinyl release seems the perfect opportunity to see what Human Cull’s third album has to offer. If you’re unfamiliar with the band, make sure you check out 2014’s Stillborn Nation and 2018’s Revenant for some great grinding fun. Continue reading “Human Cull – To Weep for Unconquered Worlds (Review)”\n\nThis is the eighth album from Polish grindcore band Antigama.\n\nI always enjoy hearing Antigama, as no matter what they’re doing you know you’re going to at least get a good base level of quality (see Meteor, The Insolent, and Depressant as good examples). Continue reading “Antigama – Whiteout (Review)”\n\nThis is the latest EP from To Dust, a deathgrind band from the US.\n\nIt’s been four long year’s since To Dust’s debut split with Bent Sea, so Nightmare Cycles is one I’ve been anticipating. With only an 11-minute duration in some ways it’s merely a taster to get the appetite whetted, but hopefully we won’t have to wait another 4 years for more material from the band. Continue reading “To Dust – Nightmare Cycles (Review)”\n\nThis is the debut album from Swedish grindcore band Grid.\n\nI do like me some Swedish grind. Grid play merciless grindcore, with fiery blasts, punishing d-beats, and melodic crust all included in their aggressive formula. I very much liked 2017’s Human Collapse Syndrome, so I had high hopes for Livsleda, and it has not disappointed. Continue reading “Grid – Livsleda (Review)”\n\nAxis of Despair are a Swedish grindcore band and this is their debut album.\n\nContempt for Man is the follow up to 2016’s Mankind Crawls, which was ferociously enjoyable and showed much promise for the band’s future endeavours. Well, they’ve now made good on that promise with a beefy 20 tracks of serrated grindcore; 33 minutes of new material. Continue reading “Axis of Despair – Contempt for Man (Review)”\n\nGut Drill is a one man grindcore band from the UK and this is his latest EP.\n\nHere we have 8 minutes of brutal deathgrind, and what’s not to like? It’s well-delivered, and utterly uncompromising. Continue reading “Gut Drill – Shit for Brains (Review)”"
