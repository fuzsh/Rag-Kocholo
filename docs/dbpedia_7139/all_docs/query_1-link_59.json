        "text": "Below is my annual list of top 10 albums of the year once again. Usually I end up picking up more albums in the current year than I have the previous years but this time I wasn’t able to beat the previous year’s 91 new releases. I only got 86 new releases in 2021 (it would have been 87 but one hasn’t shown up in the mail yet). I mainly listen to music in my car or on my stereos so I rarely ever listen to music online other than to sample if a band is something I’d wanna pick up or not. So unless I got a physical copy of something I probably didn’t hear it and there’s likely some albums out there I have yet to listen to that would probably make this list and maybe I’ll realize later I fucked up but here are the 10 best out of everything I obtained from 2021:\n\n10) Melting Rot – Blood Delusions (Headsplit Records)\n\nIt was a really hard decision on if I should make this release or Ruin’s “Spread Plague Death” my number 10. The Ruin full-length is over 40 minutes and I did enjoy it a lot while this Melting Rot cd is just a 16 minute EP and I tend to usually favor longer albums over short EPs but I found myself coming back to this one a lot more. This band plays grindcore with deep guttural brutal death metal vocals which is my favorite type of grind. The intro is very Carcass influenced and sort of throws you off on what to expect as this band is in no way a Carcass clone. As soon as that Carcassy intro is over though they quickly switch to punishing blast beats and some of the sickest gutturals you’ll hear. Raspy high vocals could have worked as well with this style of music but the deep growls make the contrast that much better. They sort of remind me of Insect Warfare with a bit beefier tone and deeper vocals. There are also a few songs that throw in that slow Cock and Ball Torture style skank beat that makes the album that much sicker. There are no lyrics printed the cd insert so who knows if they’re saying actual words or just vomiting nonsense into the mic, but on many of the songs the vocal pattern almost sounds like he is singing the Oscar Mayer theme “My bologna has a first names it’s O-S-C-A-R…” (see the song “Thrown to the Shredder” at the 1:26 mark for a clear example of what I’m talking about). I’m probably wrong and if I am I don’t want to be corrected because I enjoy mentally singing along with those words. I also really like that this cd had a red disc tray. If this cd was about 10 minutes longer or so it probably would have been in my top 5 albums of the year but the short length hinders it a bit. But overall this EP is incredibly sick and I highly recommend it if you like grind or brutal shit.\n\n9) Impaled Nazarene – Eight Headed Serpent (Osmose)\n\nI didn’t expect Impaled Nazarene 30 years into their career to make an album that would make it into my top 10 releases of the year but this is the best album they have made in nearly 2 decades. Their last few albums were alright but nothing too memorable so for that reason I didn’t think this new one would be anything special either but I figured I can at least expect some filthy punk influenced black metal worth a few listens. But those expectations were greatly exceeded. It was indeed filthy punkish black metal like their other albums but they made these songs a lot more memorable and dare I say, fun. So this album stuck with me right away and hasn’t left my steady rotation since I got it. I can’t exactly put my finger on what they did differently this time to make this album better than their last several but I think it’s maybe that they embraced catchy hooks in the music on a lot more of these songs versus constant blast beats and aggression. I’m glad to know a band 3 decades into their life can still put out something that is refreshing while not deviating at all from their trademark sound. I must also add that the album cover is awesome as well and one of their best covers. I don’t see how a triple gas mask drawing equals an eight headed serpent though, but regardless the cover is sick. If you haven’t been into most modern ImpNaz I recommend checking this one out at least. It’s no “Tol Cormpt…” or “Ugra-Karma” but it is still an excellent release you won’t get bored by.\n\n8) Demiser – Through the Gate Eternal (Boris Records)\n\nDemiser is a newer US black/thrash band from the Carolinas featuring members of Primitive Warfare. Their debut album here reminds me of Destroyer 666 or Witches Hammer with ripping guitars and solos and lots of memorable hooks. Great songs and musicianship aside though, one of the things I really like about this band is their attitude and that they don’t take themselves too seriously. If you follow any of them online you’ll see they’re extremely tight friends who are always partying together every weekend and having fun which I think influences the music somewhat. Like how they wrote two songs about members of the band, “Raw Fucking Vomit” the drummer (he now goes by Infestor but he was previously known as Raw Fucking Vomit and we all know that song is about him) and also a song about the vocalist Demiser the Demiser called “Demiser the Demiser”. That’s the kind of shit I have done with some of my bands before, putting inside jokes about members or people we know in songs that nobody besides close friends will get and disguising it as general Satanic debauchery. I appreciate those kinds of nuances greatly! These guys don’t let their constant partying and drinking hold them back and affect their momentum either as they just completed a successful tour and have signed to Metal Blade Records which is a well deserved feat. I think this debut album “Through the Gate Eternal” is sold out everywhere but if you happen to come across it somewhere don’t pass it up if you like drunken evil riffs. I look forward to their future Metal Blade debut which will hopefully have the songs “Phalomancer” and “Gravepisser” on it.\n\n7) Archgoat – Worship the Eternal Darkness (Debemur Morti)\n\nIf Archgoat has a new album out then you know it’s going to end up on my year end list somewhere. “Luciferian Crown” was my 3rd best album of 2018, “Apocalyptic Triumphator” was album of the year in 2015 and “Light-Devouring Darkness” was my 2nd best album of 2009 (right behind “Quantos…” by Gorgoroth but if I could go back and redo it I would probably swap those two). Archgoat peaked with “Apocalyptic Triumphator” and they could have easily broken up (again) at that point and cemented their legacy as the greatest bestial/black death metal band but they still have more to (un)bless the world with. There were a few releases that came out this year influenced by Archgoat that I enjoyed even more which I will get to in a bit, but that doesn’t take away the fact that Archgoat are the G.O.A.T. of this style. This new album follows the same formula of their last album with a demonic intro straight into brutal blasting blasphemy. Lord Angelslayer’s vocals are still as guttural and unique as ever even into his late 40’s. And like the last album they also delve a little into the upbeat black/punk territory with the song “Rats Pray God”. The standout track is “Blessed in the Light of Lucifer” I think, which has some fast headbanging drumming and faint synth driving the rhythm of the song and then slows down into an evil interlude with that semi-clear demonic back-up voice they sometimes do. The closing track “Burial of Creation”, which is the longest song on the album, is another stand out with a slow almost doomy buildup into some killer chorus hooks that are trademark Archgoat. So even though this isn’t among Archgoat’s best albums it still is one of the best things to come out this year. It’s impossible to top “Apocalyptic Triumphator” or “Light-Devouring Darkness” but they still continue to consistently put out some of the best black/death metal and I look forward to everything they put out. Archgoat’s inspiration will live for eternity and even though many bands try to play their style they are the masters and impossible to replicate.\n\n6) Savage Necromancy – Feathers Fall to Flames (Unpure Records)\n\nSavage Necromancy is a fairly new black/death band from Arizona. I have their self-titled debut EP from a few years ago which was excellent and so I was stoked when I found out they dropped their first full-length out of nowhere this past August. They are clearly and unapologetically influenced by Archgoat and even though Archgoat are the gods of this style, I happened to enjoy this album just a little bit more than Archgoat’s new one. It has been said (which I agree with) that war metal is more similar to grindcore than it is to black metal and several of the members of this band are also in grind bands so it would make sense that these musicians can pull off excellent black/death war metal such as this. The album starts off with some Satanic Spanish chants followed by a heavy ass Archgoat style intro complete with church bells and then from there it goes harder and more unrelenting for almost the whole album. There are some slow downs to let you breathe here and there but overall it is just punishing blasting filth that throttles you for nearly a half hour. And complimenting the brutal evil music are excellent song titles like “Baptized in the Cum of the Goat”, “Genocidal Frostfukk Terrorstorm”, and my personal favorite, “Disgorging Christ’s Kingdom” (I love when the verb “disgorge” gets used and seeing a black metal band do it makes this album that much more awesome). This band really lives up to their name with how savage the music is while still maintaining that aura of each song being an unholy necromancy ritual. This is still available on cd from their bandcamp or the Unpure records bandcamp if you’re in Europe and I believe it’s getting a vinyl release next year too so picking up a version of this album is mandatory if you missed out!\n\n5) Odockh – Signs of Decomposition – The Dawn of New Life (Peachskin Records)\n\nI do not know much about this mysterious Russian band but this tape of theirs impressed me immensely. It is also black/death metal but not as much Archgoat worship as the Savage Necromancy album was as Odockh seems to take influences from lots of bands of the style and even some brutal death metal. No intros on this, as soon as you hit play a dark low tuned riff starts and seconds later you are introduced to some inhuman beastly growls that make the music that much more powerful. But as good as that opener is, I wasn’t ready for what was next with track 2. As soon as the first song fades out you are immediately walloped by a boneheaded Von style riff and drumbeat in the 2nd song “The Great Celebration – Funeral Train”. Von is a band you don’t hear many bands take influence from nowadays so it was a welcome breath of fresh air hearing a band with some of that sound. And that type of playing paired with these extra sick vocals really made this band stand out to me. Not all the songs are like that though, the rest of the album continues with brutal songs full of non-stop blast beats that are mostly under 2 minutes. Even though the songs are short it isn’t really a grindcore influence there as more just brutal bursts of death metal (but still clearly rooted in black metal). There is some really creative riffing in nearly every song too, it’s not your standard caveman black/death chugs. There are some dissonant Deathspell Omega style chords in there but downtuned, lots of intricate black metal tremolo picking with little accents and variations too that sound extra sick in low tuning and even some brutal death punches (almost like slams I want to say but just shy hitting that type of territory). Clearly the guitarist is really good and I wouldn’t be surprised if he plays tech death on the side but was able to dumb things down to make it more evil and interesting for this band. This band is criminally underrated and hopefully they get more attention in the future because this is top notch stuff not many people know about. This tape is still available from their bandcamp (as of this writing) and even though it’s from Russia, the shipping to the US is pretty reasonable so definitely pick this up and keep a lookout for whatever this band is up to in the future.\n\n4) Ungfell – Es Grauet (Eisenwald)\n\nI knew this would be good when it was announced as I loved their first 2 albums. Their debut “Tôtbringære” was my 2nd best album of 2017 and their follow up “Mythen, Mären, Pestilenz” was my 9th best album of 2018. And so when I heard that new preview track they premiered called “Tyfels Antlitz” with a cow mooing in it I was immediately sold on this release before it even came out. And the rest of the album didn’t disappoint either when it was finally released. Ungfell’s first two albums were heavily compared to Peste Noire with the avantgarde, raw and folkish style black metal they played and the color coded album covers but they seemingly have branched away from that now and helped define a sound more their own with this much more well produced and varied recording. This album is extremely well written with lots of unique instruments/sounds being featured including an even better use of the mouth harp “boing” sound than before going really well with the rhythm. And the layout is amazing as well. The cover is some cool style art of cows watching a church burn giving off bubble shaped smoke while some creatures lurk underground. I am probably over simplifying it but I have no idea what this album or these songs are actually about as they aren’t in English. And then the booklet has even better looking drawings of what I presume is a scene for each song, including an up-close better quality sketch of a cow watching the church be destroyed. In case you can’t tell, I really like the usage of cows on this album. “Glorious Swiss cows” to be exact, as they refer to them in the liner notes. The music is great on it’s own and I would rank this album just as high even without the cow guest vocals and art but the band definitely deserves extra praise for including that. I look forward to Ungfell pushing things further forging their own sound and aesthetic as they progress into becoming future legends in the black metal underground.\n\n3) Ferriterium – Calvaire (Epictural Production)\n\nThis is the third album from melodic French black metal band Ferriterium and I am ashamed to admit I actually never heard of these guys until this year. “Calvaire” was one of the first new releases of the year, it came out mid-January and it has held up strong over almost everything to come out the following 11 months. I didn’t actually hear this album until a few months into the year though but once I heard a few of these riffs I immediately had to order a copy and I ended up being just in time as I bought the last remaining cd on their bandcamp. I would almost say the fast melodic black metal these guys play borders on brutal territory with the crisp production and constant usage of blast beats but it doesn’t seem right to label music such as this as brutal even if it can be very punishing but hopefully you know what I mean. This band sort of reminds me early Watain but with more powerful drums and better more tortured sounding vocals (say what you will about Watain’s fans and gimmick, but their early stuff brought the riffs) or maybe Nightbringer but louder and with more blasts. This album only has 4 songs and is over 40 minutes which can turn some people off knowing they’ll have to sit through a bunch of long songs. Even I sometimes will see an album that is long with not many tracks and worry it’s going to bore me with lots of filler but these 4 long songs go by like nothing. They pack in countless quality riffs and structure everything perfectly so there is no downtime. So despite how long these songs are the album is over before you know it and you’ll be wanting to play it all over again after it finishes. I wish I would have known about this band sooner but at least I know there are 2 previous albums out there I need to hunt down since this album just made me want more and I will definitely be looking forward to whatever they put out next.\n\n2) Spectral Wound – A Diabolic Thirst (Profound Lore)\n\nThis album was on nearly everyone’s year end list and if you’ve heard it then it is probably no surprise to see it here on mine as well. This young Canadian band takes a lot of influence from Finnish black metal and you can hear some of the best elements of bands like Sargeist and Satanic Warmaster in their music and I even hear some hints of Swedish gods Dissection in there as well but with Spectral Wound’s own uniqueness permeating throughout. The riffs on the whole album are melodic and haunting but have a dark, piercing, evil tone that sticks with you after the album is over. Even after my first listen I already had several of the riffs stuck in my head so I knew this album was likely going to remain as one of my favorites of the year. That dark evil tone they have actually reminds me of Intestine Baalism’s “An Anatomy of the Beast” which is one of my favorite albums ever so that might explain why it stuck with me so much. And the drums have some excellent nuances that I really dug as well that helped take the songs to the next level for me. When a song calls for the same drum beat to be repeated several times the drummer often will keep the beat the same but change other things like switch to double bass or switch from a hi-hat to a back and forth beats on the crash cymbals instead that make the riffs that much more impactful during their 2nd half of the repetitions. There are lots of black metal albums I have where I am hearing a song for the first time and think to myself the drums should add this or that to the 2nd half and the riff would be that much sicker but then the drums end up staying the same throughout. With Spectral Wound’s drums however it’s like he read my mind and just about every drum part was satisfying with the change ups. And the cold evil vocals are a perfect fit as well for these killer riffs and drums. This band’s previous material was already excellent and so the expectations for this 3rd album of theirs were already high but they managed to exceed them and “A Diabolic Thirst” ended up being one of the best black metal albums of the year. But most of you already know this.\n\n1) Antichrist Siege Machine – Purifying Blade (Profound Lore)\n\nProfound Lore is killing it this year putting out both the 1st and 2nd best albums of 2021. Antichrist Siege Machine’s last album “Schism Perpetration” was my 7th favorite album of 2019 so it is no surprise this one made it to my list this year as well. As soon as I got my copy of this in late September and gave it my first listen I pretty much knew that was it, this was going to be album of the year and no way anyone will be able to top it. I did want to give Archgoat a fair chance though before I solidified my decision since they had that album that was coming in late November but now that the dust has settled my decision still remains that “Purifying Blade” is still the best album I’ve heard this year. As I have said in the past, bestial black/death war metal is my absolute favorite style of music as it combines the best elements of evil black metal, filthy death metal and chaotic grind and ASM is the epitome of that as they are black/death metal band played by grind fans (they had a Repulsion cover hidden on their last album after all). This album is unrelenting in every way, it has all the fast blasting black/grind elements they’re known for but also lots of ignorant heavy death metal parts as well. Songs like “Unleashed Hostility”, “Victorious Legions of Satan” and “Defiled in Iniquity” are extremely boneheaded and go harder than a lot of brutal death metal bands. And their self-titled track “Antichrist Siege Machine” is the sickest song they’ve ever written that is not only dumb heavy but it also incorporates some sexy goregrind style grooves in it that you could play at a strip club and have dancers shake their asses to. I had a chance to play a show with these guys in 2020 but unfortunately Covid canceled that opportunity and I haven’t been able to catch them live since but based on footage I have seen it looks like they are just as brutal live as on record, even as a two piece, so I hope to get to see them one day. Being on a label like Profound Lore has brought this band to many more people’s attention and it is good to finally see them get the recognition they deserve as they are one of the best bands in the black/death war metal scene.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nHere were some other good 2021 releases I picked up. If I did a top 30 instead of a top 10 these would probably be in it. In no particular order:\n\nRuin – Spread Plague Death\n\nLast Days of Humanity – Horrific Compositions of Decomposition\n\n.50Cal Facial Fracture – Primitive Encephalectomy\n\nFossilization – He Whose Name Was Long Forgotten\n\nSaprogenous – Festering in Putrid Spoilage\n\nInfested – Grotesque Remains\n\nSarkrista – Sworn to Profound Heresy\n\nCodex Nero – The Great Harvest of Death\n\nValac – Burning Dawn of Vengeance\n\nFluids – Not Dark Yet\n\nFilth Chasm – Demo ’21\n\nAbominable Putridity – Parasitic Metamorphosis Manifestation\n\nGravesend – Methods of Human Disposal\n\nInvultation – Unconquerable Death\n\nWülfskol – Satanik Death Militia\n\nDisimperium – Malefic Obliteration\n\nFrozen Soul – Crypt of Ice\n\nLymphatic Phlegm – Roughly Excised – Putrefindings, Morbidescriptions and Necrognoses\n\nMalignant Altar – Realms of Exquisite Morbidity\n\nStress Angel – Bursting Church\n\nHere are my top 10 albums of 2020 along with some thoughts/ramblings on each one. Every year I always end up getting more albums than the year prior and this year is no different. I picked up 91 new releases this year (it would even more but some stuff still hasn’t arrived in the mail yet) so it was pretty hard to narrow down to my 10 favorites but after multiple listens here is what I enjoyed the most from 2020:\n\n10. Witches Hammer – Damnation Is My Salvation (Nuclear War Now!)\n\nI’m surprised I haven’t seen this album talked about more as these guys are old school Ross Bay Cult legends and this album was over 30 years in the making. I don’t know why it took so long to release a debut album but they certainly delivered. They refer to their music as Canadian Speed Metal which isn’t wrong, but I hear some hints of blackened elements in it too not unlike Destroyer666 so I would consider them more black/thrash but I guess speed metal is all encompassing and maybe they don’t want to be pigeonholed. Even though Witches Hammer are long time Ross Bay Cult mainstays since the 80’s I’ll admit I haven’t owned any of their stuff until this new debut full-length. I certainly knew about them and knew it was Marco the buff guy from Tyrants Blood/ex-Blasphemy (and we’re talking reeaallllly buff here, like Vince McMahon should give this guy a million dollar WWE contract buff) but I never got my hands on any of their physical prior releases. So I’m glad this debut album got a proper widely distributed release from NWN. It would be a shame if this album got buried in obscurity. This album is full of cold memorable riffs and vocals and overtime is surely going to be a highly revered Ross Bay classic viewed in the same light as Fallen Angel of Doom and War Cult Supremacy even if it is not getting enough praise as I feel it deserves right now as a new release.\n\n9. Fluids – Ignorance Exalted (Maggot Stomp)\n\nThis album is just pure dumb heaviness. Some people even say this band “does Mortician better than Mortician”. While I may not go that far, they certainly have at least done a better job at doing Mortician than Mortician has these past 2 years since Fluids started in 2018 and Mortician hasn’t released an album since 2004. But while similar, the bands don’t sound exactly the same anyways and have some noticeable differences. There definitely is a huge Mortician influence there but Fluids has some unique elements all their own that you can recognize right away. For one, their sound clips are real death and crime clips and they also add some synth/ambient sounds to their clips as well which Mortician never did so you can usually tell it is a Fluids song right away. And also Mortician had some slight campiness to them with the horror movie tribute gimmick but Fluids is just downright frightening with some of these clips they use and the sounds they put behind them. Regardless of comparisons though of who they do or don’t sound like, there is no denying Fluids plays absolutely ugly, punishing death metal. Monstrous low vocals, brutal drum machine blasting, and riffs that (probably) don’t go past the 5th fret. Well except for that lead at the end, which is actually a nice touch and great contrast to the excessive brutality that precedes it. And the title is excellent too. I love using the “ignorant” descriptor for devastatingly heavy music like this. Some bands don’t really embrace the “ignorant” label but Fluids clearly does enough to name their album that (technically it’s an EP but whatever) which I appreciate a lot. Easily one of the heaviest releases I’ve picked up this year and heaviest Maggot Stomp release of the year as well. I also picked up their “Little Village” compilation as well which is a bunch of demo/ep/split material from 2018-2020 on one disc (tape version is called “Fluids of Death”) so Fluids actually released double the ignorance this year.\n\n8. Esoctrilihum – Eternity of Shaog (I, Voidhanger)\n\nI’m really glad this isn’t a video review because there is no way I could figure out how to say this band’s name. I can’t even remember their name either, if I’m ever doing a search for them I gotta type it the best I can remember and hope google knows what I’m talking about (don’t worry, I checked the spelling of the name for this review so it’s correct). This is actually Esoctrilihum’s 5th album but this is the first time I’ve heard about them and I’m glad I randomly picked this up. They, or he rather since I think it’s just a one-man band, play some epic black metal with lots of different instrumentation going on. This album is an hour long and I usually have a hard time getting into albums that long. When I first popped in the cd and noticed that run time I dreaded it was gonna be a lot of filler and ambience but this guy packs in the riffs and it goes by in no time. From the triumphant opening riff in the album I was hooked. The band reminds me a lot of Ceremonial Castings. Although CC was a more synth heavy band, Esoctrilihum uses all kinds of instruments to accent the black metal guitar playing. Admittedly I have no idea what many of the background instruments even are, maybe a lot of it might just be clean guitar with effects, I dunno. But I certainly can appreciate this guy’s talent and his well thought out choices of other sounds to throw in there. So despite the minor differences between Ceremonial Castings and Esoctrilihum, I still get the overall same feel from both bands which is well written dark epic music that goes somewhat into the avant-garde but still being unmistakably black metal.\n\n7. Macabre – Carnival of Killers (Nuclear Blast)\n\nHonestly it might be cheating a little putting this in my top 10 because what I mainly enjoyed most about Macabre’s new one was the catchy nursery rhyme parodies which they technically didn’t write. But I did enjoy this album a lot so even if some of the catchiest parts came from other writers from a long time ago I still gotta rank it appropriately based on how much I liked it. Macabre is one of the most consistent bands around. They are the only band I know of who still have the original line-up for over 30 years and their albums always deliver with exactly what you’d expect: catchy metal with nursery rhyme hooks with the lyrics changed to be about serial killers. Aka Murder Metal! Several of these songs got stuck in my head immediately after the first listen so I kept this album in rotation for quite a while when I got it. This might be one of their weaker albums though because some of the songs where they don’t use nursery rhyme choruses are sort of forgettable and not that heavy. There are even some parts where his clean singing sounds like Jerry Only from Misfits which is never good. But those are minor complaints though and overall this album still delivered big time and has stuck with me to be in my top 10 despite its flaws.\n\n6. Perdition Temple – Sacraments of Descension (Hells Headbangers)\n\nThis is their 3rd album but this is actually the only album of theirs I have (as of this writing). I never really paid too much attention to them before which I now regret. I saw them at Hells Headbash in 2015 and I just thought it was some random new band Impurath was doing vocals on. I saw their set but didn’t remember much about it except that they had to stop in the middle of their first song then start over. Other than that I thought they sounded fine but it wasn’t anything that stuck with me (getting this album changed all that for me though). I didn’t realize ’til much later it was Gene Palubicki’s post-Angelcorpse band so no wonder it is packed with so many good riffs. As soon as you hit play it comes right at you with some lightning fast riffing and blast beats then after a few riffs the 2nd guitar in the background starts doing some heavy chugs behind the fast Angelcorpsesque riffing which sound absolutely sick paired together. And then the rest of the tracks keep hitting you after that with more fast brutality and hooks and after multiple listens I went from simply thinking “these guys are pretty good, I shouldn’t have slept on them” to “this is one of the best cds I’ve picked up this year!”. And I guess Impurath isn’t even in the band anymore, Gene is the vocalist too on this one. I didn’t even know he could do vocals but he sounds killer and does kind of similar rasps to Helmcamp on the Angelcorpse albums. You can tell Gene really is pouring his everything into this band and it shines with the memorable song writing. I will definitely be getting their past albums soon to make up for what I’ve been missing.\n\n5. Mass Extinction – Never-Ending Holocaust (Self-released/Rat Mix Records)\n\nMass Extinction is a new animal liberation grind band from New York started by Tom Maher who some of you may know as Skullbastard who runs Mortician Memes Facebook page. They sound very similar to Nasum with a heavy hm-2 (I think that’s what it’s called) guitar sound. You could even mistake this for a lost Nasum EP if you didn’t know any better. Lyrically and concept wise it is about highlighting the cruelty humans do to animals in the meat, dairy and egg industries and uses sound clips from animal rights activists like Gary Yourofsky and also utilizes horrifying sounds from slaughterhouse footage and is largely inspired by the book “Eternal Treblinka” in highlighting man’s cruelty towards animals. This release is very special to me because unbeknownst to the band members this is the exact same concept I have been trying to start out here on the west coast with other vegans. I too was inspired by the Eternal Treblinka book and Gary Yourosky to write about these very topics. It never really worked out for me though because for this type of project I need to work with like minded vegans which either don’t play instruments or they do and live too far away. I’m thinking that is the case for these guys too since it is just 2 brothers and a drum machine. I am really glad a concept like this exists in extreme metal though (there’s a small handful of other bands touching on these topics in this kind of music too, but most bands that do are usally punk or hardcore) because getting the message out is what is most important since the animals don’t have a voice to speak up and rescue themselves. I would join this band in a heartbeat if they lived closer and if I could keep up with that drum machine but they do just fine with their drum programming and got it to sound closer to real drums than I have ever heard any drum machine band. I don’t rank albums on my list based on lyrics though since most the bands I listen to I can’t even understand what they’re saying or I don’t really care about reading what nonsense they are writing but this Mass Extinction debut is simply one of the best sounding releases I heard all year and it is just a bonus that is resonates with me so well lyrically also. This probably would be higher on my list if it wasn’t so short. It is hard for me to rank EPs against full-lengths since full-lengths have more music to enjoy but these 21 minutes are some top notch grindcore! And I highly encourage people to read the lyrics on this one and consider their message of going vegan to help phase out the animal torment businesses.\n\n4. Internal Rot – Grieving Birth (Blastasfuk Grindcore)\n\nAnother killer grindcore release that blew me away. Unlike Mass Extinction though, I don’t know much about this band or what their lyrics are about or why the cover is just a picture of actress Rebecca Hall. But I couldn’t deny how much I enjoyed this album. It’s 22 fast blasting pissed off grind songs with memorable riffs that get stuck in your head. This album is a few minutes longer than Mass Extictnion’s EP and I like the guitar tone better so for those reasons I put this Internal Rot cd a bit higher on my list. This album has gotten lots of praise everywhere though so you probably don’t need me to tell you how good it is. It has a similar feel as Insect Warfare’s “World Extermination” and I can honestly see it being regarded as this decade’s “World Extermination” and will probably end up having a similar impact on the grindcore world as it ages. It would be cool if these guys go on to put out a sick slower death metal band on Maggot Stomp too 12 years down the line like Insect Warfare guys did. Or they can just never slow down and keep putting out angry brutal grind records with fuzzy obscure photos of women on the cover. Either way, I’ll buy.\n\n3. Dearth – To Crown All Befoulment (Sentient Ruin)\n\nThe guitarist and bassist of this band have been playing black metal in the bay area since they were young. One started off in Torture Chamber and the other in Xenotaph nearly a decade ago but in 2017 they joined together to put their main focus on this new black/death juggernaut called Dearth and now 3 years after their first demo they have released this absolute monster of a debut full-length. Right when you hit play on this album there is a snare count then you are bombarded with non-stop heavy riffs, blasts and atmosphere for 33 minutes without any time to breathe. Black/death metal or war metal is my absolute favorite style of music and Dearth takes it to a whole new level by adding some bleak death/doom elements and lots of dissonant Deathspell Omega style chords over a brutal war metal blueprint. It is a shame this album came out during the Covid pandemic shut-down because these guys have been working hard all these years playing quality black metal and this album is the apex of what they have done and should have gotten them the recognition and opportunities they deserve outside of the bay area but now things are in a halt for everyone. At least this album is out there though to still listen to all over the world so I highly recommend checking these guys out if you never heard of them as they play one of the best blends of black metal and death metal you will ever hear and once shows come back be sure to go see them live because you won’t be disappointed.\n\n2. Vassafor – To the Death (Iron Bonehead)\n\nI will admit I wasn’t that big on this album at first but it slowly grew on me throughout the last several months of the year. I listened to the cd multiple times when I first got it and even though it sounded good and was unmistakably the Vassafor sound of murky ugly black metal/death metal, I kept finding myself just floating through it on autopilot with my listens not retaining much of it. However during those first several listens it was like they planted some sort of rotten fungus in my brain that slowly spread and weeks later a bunch of random riffs kept popping up in my head and I had to try to figure out what they were from. I was pulling up several new albums I listened to recently to figure out where those eerie riffs in my head were from but everything I popped in left me disappointed in my search. Then I tried Vassafor’s “To the Death” again and sure enough there they were. I was being hit with riff after haunting riff and I couldn’t believe I didn’t notice it all before. I guess they were buried in all the ugliness going on in the album and they didn’t jump out at me like some other bands on my list have. Any time I would put the album away to try and move on to other new releases I’ve ordered the riffs on this album kept festering in my head and seducing me back. The epic song “Singularity” at the end of the album in particular is loaded with those riffs, but they can be found all over the album. So all the way until now, the end of the year, I find myself pulling out this album still when I know I have just over an hour to kill and let it take me to the putrid sonic abyss Vassafor creates. There is no denying at this point this is one of the best albums that has come out in 2020. There are still some parts of the album though that drag and don’t really stick with me much what with the album being over an hour long so that is probably why it just missed the mark of being my album of the year, but the many parts that do stick with me are embedded in my mind forever and will keep me coming back to this album as a necessary go-to for the rest of my life. It’s no wonder VK is such a highly respected legend in the underground and gets invited to join countless bands with output of this quality.\n\n1. Gut – Disciples of Smut (Splatter Zombie Records)\n\nI never would have thought this would be my album of the year when it was announced. I thought I was just gonna be in for some decent grind with toilet vocals and toilet humor but they totally reinvented themselves and caught me off guard with this album. It’s like a total rebirth for Gut. The perverse humor is still there a bit but overall this album has more of a dark and somewhat black metal aesthetic. One of the members in the band photo is even wearing a Profanatica shirt which was surely a good sign. And once you start really getting into the album you can clearly hear the Profanatica influence. I wouldn’t say this album sounds black metal but it has a lot of the bass and drumming style Profanatica does, just with some pitchshifted toilet vocals instead of Paul Ledney style rasps. Really it is more of a death/doom album if anything in my opinion. It even got them accepted into Metal Archives finally after years of being rejected as too grind. This new goregrind death/doom hybrid they are doing is something different I don’t think I’ve heard before and I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would. Every single song on the cd is memorable and around 2-5 minutes each, there aren’t any few seconds long throw away tracks or songs that are more sound clip than music. The few sound clips they do use are pretty dark or Satanic and are blended in well with the songs. These guys really stepped it up musically for this new one. The last song on the album even has that Sanguisugabogg riff you all love (you know which one I’m talking about). It makes me wonder who wrote the riff first. That Sanguisugabogg demo came out before this album but Gut has been working on this album for 14 years so who knows. Regardless, it doesn’t really matter though, both bands are sick. And I think if you like Sanguisugabogg, Profanatica or death/doom in general and can handle goregrind vocals then you will enjoy this album. There are a lot of great albums I heard in 2020 and it was hard to narrow it down to my favorite one but bottom line is the riffs and rhythms on every song on this album hit me immediately and stuck more so than any other album I have bought this year and that is why Gut’s “Disciples of Smut” is my pick as album of the year.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nHere are some other killer 2020 releases I got that I feel deserve mentioning. If I did a top 25 or top 30 these would probably be on it.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\nYouna – Zornvlouch\n\nKhthoniik Cerviiks – Æquiizoiikum\n\nIncantation – Sect of Vile Divinities\n\nBlasphamagoatachrist – Bastardizing the Purity\n\nOf Feather and Bone – Sulfuric Disintegration\n\nPrimitive Warfare/Complot! split\n\nPneuma Hagion – Voidgazer\n\nWalpurgia – Altar of the Goatbaphomet\n\nRevenge – Strike.Smother.Dehumanize\n\nAltar of Gore – Obscure & Obscene Gods\n\nRawhead/Raw Addict/Blue Holocaust/Active Stenosis 4-way split\n\nSanctifying Ritual – s/t\n\nAntichrist Siege Machine – Filth of the World\n\nSargeist – Death Veneration (this technically came out at the end of 2019 but would be 2020 by the time it arrived in anybody’s mailbox)\n\nYxxan – Satanic Fortification Overbalance\n\nBuried Alive – Death Will Find You\n\nCeremonial Bloodbath – The Tides of Blood"
