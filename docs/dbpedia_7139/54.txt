If you were to ask any grindcore aficionado for their top five list of all time grindcore bands, it’s a pretty safe bet that Sweden’s Nasum would be one of the few bands to appear on virtually every list. During the late ’90s and into the early parts of the 20th century, the Orebro-based band both revolutionized grindcore while simultaneously becoming the standard-bearers of the continental European sound: brutal, precise, metallic and groovy.

Tragically, Nasum’s lead singer and guitarist Mieszko Talarczyk lost his life in the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami/Earthquake. Eight years later the surviving members of Nasum reunited with Rotten Sound vocalist Keijo Niinimaa for a special one-off tour to celebrate the band’s 20th anniversary. The final show of that tour was held on the band’s home turf, the now-closed Debaser Medis venue in Stockholm, a performance which was captured for Nasum: Blasting Shit to Bits – The Final Show, released on Selfmadegod on December 18.

Combining backstage interviews with pummeling live footage, Blasting Shit to Bits – The Final Show serves as both a fitting tribute to the late Talarcyzk and also a visceral portrait of a modern grindcore performance at its most visceral. The upcoming DVD serves as a profound meditation on grief, loss and triumph through the power off unbelievably brutal music.
