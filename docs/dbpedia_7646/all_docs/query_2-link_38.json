Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn in 1936 in Milan\n\nBerlusconi enjoyed a relatively humble upbringing, firmly entrenched within the religiousness of the mid-century Italian bourgeoisie.\n\nSource: Silvio Berlusconi: Television, Power and Patrimony by Paul Ginsborg\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis first job was as a singer on a cruise ship\n\nHumble beginnings, but one that helped him learn how to work a crowd. By 25, he was beginning to get into property development, having convinced the boss of his father's bank to lend him the money.\n\nSource: Telegraph\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe went on to become one of the wealthiest men in the world.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi clocks in at #118 in Forbes list of billionaires. His wealth is estimated at $7.8 billion.\n\nIncredibly, he's a self-made billionaire -- he made his fortune through his media empire and not through inherited companies or property.\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe soon entered the media business and now owns much of Italy's media.\n\nMediaset, one of Berlusconi's TV companies, is the largest commercial broadcaster in Italy. Berlusconi's domination of the Italian media means that press freedom organizations have criticized Italy as being only \"partly free,\" because the lack of a media plurality.\n\nThe Economist estimates Berlusconi controls 90% of Italian television.\n\n(Of course, Mediaset has been having some problems today).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe created his own political party and first rose to power in 1994.\n\nBerlusconi became Prime Minister for the first time in 1994 after founding his own party, \"Forza Italy,\" which in English means Go Italy. It's also a chant for AC Milan, the football club he owns. His government collapsed seven months later, but Berlusconi rose to power again in 2001.\n\nBerlusconi's success comes in part from the collapse of traditional left and right wing parties in Italy in the early 1990s. Untainted by the collapse, and with huge reserves of money, Berlusconi was quickly able to establish himself.\n\nSource: BBC News\n\nSoon, his love of women made him notorious\n\nBerlusconi's love of the fairer sex made him a hit with the tabloids internationally. However, the flood of attractive woman into parliament led some to question his style of governing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe became well known for his expensive gifts.\n\nBerlusconi allegedly gives out expensive party favors. Pier Corso told a court in Milan that Berlusconi gave women gifts, saying:\n\n\"There are those who were given a Land Rover, those who got a Smart car, those who received an apartment in the city center and those who were elected to a regional assembly...to be elected in this way is not a crime.\"\n\nRecords show that in one 18 month period he gave over $4 million in gifts to various women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost notorious, however, were his famous \"bunga bunga\" parties\n\nIn 2009 photos of semi-naked young women partying outside Berlusconi's Sardinian villa made their way into Spain's El Pais newspaper.\n\nThe person who took the pictures told the newspaper that \"virtually every weekend\" Italian air force flights brought Berlusconi's friends, dancers and television hostesses to the villa.\n\nThe parties became known as \"bunga bunga\" — though no one knows exactly why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncidentally, in his extravagant house in Sardinia he has a remote-controlled volcano.\n\nBoom.\n\nSource: The New Yorker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis antics eventually led his estranged wife published a scornful letter to him in a national newspaper.\n\nVeronica Lario, Berlusconi's wife at the time, wrote an editorial against Berlusconi in the La Repubblica newspaper (not Berlusconi owned or affiliated) alleging that the Prime Minister offended her dignity by constantly flirting with women on national TV and appointing showgirls to European Parliament positions.\n\nBerlusconi and Lario later divorced.\n\nSource: Washington Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternationally, he became a joke, even losing a feud with The Economist\n\nThe Economist has ran several cover stories on Berlusconi, with titles like \"The man who screwed an entire country\" and \"Why Silvio Berlusconi is unfit to run Italy\".\n\nBerlusconi struck back, taking the British publication to court for libel and claiming that their stories were an \"insult to truth and intelligence.\" Berlusconi lost the libel case, and had to pay The Economist's court expenses.\n\nSource: The Economist (pdf)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe spent more than $300 million on legal bills.\n\nBerlusconi has told the press that the courts were out to get him, and that he has spent more than $300 million on legal fees and has been a part of at least 109 trials. Berlusconi claims that back when French President Nicholas Sarkozy was a lawyer, Berlusconi employed him to take care of his legal troubles in France.\n\nSome of his legal woes include being charged multiple times with bribery, paying an underage girl for sex, tax fraud, false account, and on one notable event, being sued on behalf of all women for insulting their dignity.\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, in the end it wasn't his corruption, foul mouth or libido that destroyed him\n\nWhen Berlusconi was finally forced to announce his resignation this week, it wasn't because he had called Angela Merkel an \"unf***able lardarse\", it wasn't because he was accused of sleeping with an underage prostitute, and it wasn't because he was almost constantly being investigated for corruption.\n\nNo, Berlusconi was eventually forced out because of market forces. Whether down to him or not, he's presided over a period of time that saw Berlusconi's economy went to to the dumpster.\n\nAnd for that, even Italy couldn't forgive him.\n\nNow check out who could replace him...\n\nGOODBYE BERLUSCONI: Meet The People Who Want To Take His Place >\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
