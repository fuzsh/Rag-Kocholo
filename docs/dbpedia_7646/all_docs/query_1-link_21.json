        "text": "The \"Silvio Berlusconi Trophy\" returns with a match between AC Milan and AC Monza, the two Clubs cherished by President Silvio Berlusconi. This year's edition is scheduled for the first time at the San Siro Stadium on Tuesday, 13 August, with kick-off at 21:00 CEST, and will be broadcast live on Canale 5.\n\nEstablished last year by AC Milan and AC Monza, this initiative honours the memory of President Silvio Berlusconi, who left an indelible mark on Italian and international football through his leadership of the two Clubs. Berlusconi, the most successful President in AC Milan's 125-year history, won 29 trophies in 31 years, elevating the Rossoneri to global prominence. After acquiring AC Monza in 2018, he led the Biancorossi back to Serie B after 19 years and then to a historic first promotion to Serie A in May 2022. Monza is now set to compete in the top division for the third consecutive season, having secured their place well ahead of time in the previous two seasons.\n\nFor Paulo Fonseca, the new Rossoneri coach, this match will mark his first appearance at San Siro Stadium on the AC Milan bench. He will face Alessandro Nesta, the new AC Monza coach, who, after wearing the Rossoneri shirt for ten years, will now face AC Milan for the first time as a coach."
