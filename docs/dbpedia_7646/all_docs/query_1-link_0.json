        "text": "\"I'm descending into the field.\" Silvio Berlusconi, who died on June 12, 2023, was leaving nothing to chance when he announced his entry into politics in January 1994. By choosing a sports metaphor, the then president of AC Milan wanted to convey that the winning strategies he had applied in the sporting world could also be applied to politics. After all, he had taken the football club to the very top: That year, the Rossoneri – the team's nickname – were about to win their fifth Champions League, the third of the Berlusconi era. What better metaphor to say he could do the same for the country and give it a place at the table of great nations? Moreover, by naming his party Forza Italia, using the phrase commonly used to encourage Italy's national team, Berlusconi was anticipating future efforts to build a nation of followers. His political legacy would be much more polarizing than his football one.\n\nAs early as 1995, Manuel Vazquez Montalban, a Catalan author and expert in football and politics, posed the question in Le Monde diplomatique: \"Would Silvio Berlusconi have succeeded in presiding over Italy's government without the help of AC Milan football club and its legendary players, Van Basten, Gullit, Rijkaard? (...) When they voted for Berlusconi, young people were mostly choosing the 'winner' in business and the strategist of AC Milan's glorious victories.\"\n\nBy the time he came to power, Berlusconi – a native of Milan – was known as a media figure and entrepreneur, but Italians identified him chiefly as the man responsible for Italian football's glamour abroad. He became president of AC Milan in 1986, taking over when the Lombardy outfit was on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nIn his mind, playing second fiddle was out of the question. Granted, AC Milan already had a long history behind it when he took over the reins. But that didn't stop the 50-year-old television and real estate magnate from making his mark by forcing the club to modernize, thereby radically changing it. He invested billions of lire in infrastructure – Milanello, the training center, became a marvel of modernity – and recruitment.\n\nHe made Franco Baresi the backbone of the team and made a flurry of new signings. Even before the 1995 Bosman ruling, which banned restrictions on player transfers throughout Europe, Berlusconi and his Milan brought in the Dutch players Ruud Gullit, Marco Van Basten and Frank Rijkaard. Other figures also emerged at that time: Paolo Maldini, Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto Donadoni, Alessandro Costacurta and Demetrio Albertini."
