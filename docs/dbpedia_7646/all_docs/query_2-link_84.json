        "text": "MILAN (BBC): AC Milan have paid tribute to “unforgettable” former owner Silvio Berlusconi following his death at the age of 86 on Monday. Berlusconi bought his hometown club in 1986 and turned the struggling side into one of football’s most successful clubs. Under his leadership, Milan won five European Cups, as well as eight Italian league titles.\n\nIn 2017, he sold the club to Chinese investors for 740m euros (£628m). Fifa president Gianni Infantino described Berlusconi as a “visionary”. Milan tweeted: “Deeply saddened, AC Milan grieves the passing of the unforgettable Silvio Berlusconi and wishes to reach out to the family, associates, and most cherished friends to share our sympathies.” The former Italian prime minister returned to football less than 18 months after selling Milan when his holding company, Fininvest, bought 100% of shares in third-division side Monza in 2018."
