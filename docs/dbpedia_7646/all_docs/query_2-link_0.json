        "text": "Silvio Berlusconi’s death at the age of 86 this week marked the end of an era for Italian football.\n\nFew figures in the recent history of the Italian game have shaped and influenced it more than Berlusconi. Bar a short, one-year spell in between selling Milan and buying Monza from 2017 to 2018, Berlusconi had been involved in calcio since 1986, when he bought what was then a struggling Milan team languishing in mid-table mediocrity.\n\nFor better or worse, he’d been a constant presence, never far away from a snappy quote or producing a punchy headline. Yet there’s no denying his fingerprints are all over the European and Italian game.\n\nSince his death on Monday, obituaries and opinion pieces have been written, mostly chastising his political career and his perpetual ability to make eye-rolling remarks in the public domain.\n\nYet on a football level, Berlusconi was a visionary. He, before anyone else, noticed just how under-utilised football was by television in the mid-80s. It was Berlusconi who had the grand idea of coupling football and television and transforming the sport into a spectacle, borrowing elements from America’s treatment of the NFL.\n\nBerlusconi’s TV company, Fininvest, became the first private television company in Italy to broadcast a game live, when Juventus’ European Cup clash against Celtic in 1980 was beamed out to the country. It was Berlusconi who envisioned a European Cup restructuring in the late 1980s, aghast at seeing Diego Maradona’s Napoli drawn against Real Madrid in the first round of the 1987-88 season. Berlusconi felt it was simply too early for the champions of Italy to meet the champions of Spain, while the likes of Bordeaux, Rangers, PSV Eindhoven and Anderlecht would all make it as far as the quarter final in that season’s competition.\n\nIn many respects, it was a simpler time in the sport, but Berlusconi felt there was money to be mined, and lots of it. He was one of the main players in the repackaging of the European Cup as the Champions League in 1992, and the game has never really been the same since. In Italy, Serie A club’s reliance (and an over reliance, most would argue) on TV rights money from the ‘90s to the current day originates from Berlusconi’s vision.\n\nOn a domestic level, the greatest ‘what if’ is what if Berlusconi had never bought Milan in the first place? The Rossoneri had been twice relegated at the start of the 1980s, one for their involvement in the Totonero betting scandal, and the other because they just weren’t any good.\n\nIn the seasons before Berlusconi effectively saved the club in 1986, Milan had finished 8th and 5th. The season that Berlusconi bought Milan, halfway through 1985-86, Milan were in mid-table and eventually finished 7th. In a 16-team Serie A, they were closer to another jaunt in Serie B than champions Juventus.\n\nHow different is the modern game if Berlusconi hadn’t plucked Arrigo Sacchi out of obscurity to manage Milan in 1987? Sacchi was coach of Parma, who weren’t the Parma of the 1990s and yet to be owned by Parmalat. Sacchi masterminded a victory against Milan in the Coppa Italia that convinced Berlusconi that the former shoe salesman had a future in the game, bringing him to San Siro.\n\nWhen Sacchi’s pressing methods – revolutionary in Italian circles - weren’t winning favour with his Italian-majority squad in the early part of 1987-88, Berlusconi backed his coach rather than offloading him. Eventually, Sacchi was proved right, and Milan won the title against Maradona’s Napoli after an epic 3-2 encounter in Naples in May.\n\nSacchi’s Milan went on to conquer the European game twice - including a watershed 5-0 demolition of Real Madrid in the 1988-89 semi final second leg at San Siro – and that side subsequently influenced many of today’s modern thinkers like Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and Carlo Ancelotti. Until Guardiola’s Barcelona, Sacchi’s Milan were generally regarded to be the greatest club side of all-time.\n\nHow different is the sport in 2023 had Berlusconi listened to those Milan players in the autumn of 1987 and sacked Sacchi for a coach with more conservative tactics? Many an owner would’ve buckled under the pressure, but Berlusconi could never be accused of lacking conviction in his own ideas.\n\nSimilarly, he entrusted an unproven Fabio Capello in succeeding Sacchi once Sacchi alienated enough of his star players and left to take over the Italian national team role in 1991.\n\nCapello had little-to-no experience at the top level as a coach, let alone managing talents like Marco Van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Paolo Maldini. If Sacchi’s Milan were spectacular, Capello’s Milan were frighteningly consistent; an impregnable force that won three titles on the bounce in the most competitive league the game has ever seen, including being the real ‘invincibles’ in 1991-92, winning the league unbeaten.\n\nTame by the standards of today, Berlusconi was lavish in his first few seasons as Milan owner: a net loss of €43m ($46m) was made between 1986 and 1987, yet he broke even in six from the next seven seasons, despite breaking the world transfer record three times in signing Gullit, Jean-Pierre Papin and Gianluigi Lentini. His spending upped the ante for every team in Serie A in the late ‘80s and the 1990s in an effort to keep up with Milan’s domestic and European dominance. He set the template and Roman Abramovich followed it when buying Chelsea in the summer of 2003.\n\nEven as he became prime minister of Italy in the ‘90s and 2000s and his presence in football took a back seat, Berlusconi still made his voice heard. Ancelotti tells the story of Berlusconi telling him it was an ‘obligation’ to play with two strikers at Milan after Ancelotti had adapted a ‘Christmas tree’ formation featuring just Pippo Inzaghi in the earliest part of the 2002/03 season.\n\nMilan won the Champions League that season, with two strikers.\n\nVery few players ever said no to Berlusconi in the early days and Milan was home to seven Ballon d’Or winners during his reign. Only Maradona was unattainable and Berlusconi often wondered how Maradona’s life trajectory would’ve altered had he joined Milan in the late ‘80s. “He was a fragile person, perhaps the discipline and attention to individuals that existed in my Milan would have helped him avoid some mistakes,” lamented Berlusconi. “But, from talking to him, I realised one thing: Maradona was Naples, he was the symbol of the greatest Napoli team in history. And icons like him cannot be bought and cannot be moved.”\n\nWhen asked on the player he enjoyed watching the most from the ones he did manage to sign, Berlusconi had no doubts. “ If I really have to name [my favourite], I choose Van Basten, a symbol of the beauty of football as I understand it,” he said.\n\nIn all, Berlusconi spent close to €1bn during his presidency but, by the end, football had simply become too expensive a toy even for a man of his wealth. Italy’s stagnation in keeping up with the times meant Berlusconi pumping in more money to cover club debt, let alone signing marquee names. In the last five years of his reign, Milan ironically ended up where he found them: languishing in mid-table with a side that was a million miles away from the glory days.\n\n“Berlusconi was a genius,” remarked Capello this week. “He had a vision that he was years ahead of. In many fields he has done incredible things such as in football and in the business world.” Despite what he morphed into, with the perma-tan, the perma-hair dye and make-up so caked on that when he smiled he often resembled Jack Nicholson’s Joker, Capello hasn’t been the first to label Berlusconi a genius or visionary.\n\nIn football, Berlusconi changed the game, and did so having never been a player or coach. That’s his ultimate legacy."
