        "text": "Silvio Berlusconi is an Italian political titan, known not only for his energetic leadership and scandalous reputation, but also for his rich business empire. With a thriving career in media, construction, and soccer, Berlusconi has repeatedly used his unique talent for manipulation to gain political influence in Italy.\n\nChanges and consistency, successes and scandals – these are the contrasts of his life, making his figure so attractive for study.\n\nBiography of Silvio Berlusconi\n\nSilvio Berlusconi was born on September 29, 1936, in Milan. His family was not wealthy, but the future Prime Minister received a good education. He was one of the best students at a Catholic high school, and subsequently graduated with honors from the Law Faculty of the University of Milan.\n\nSilvio’s Early Successes in Business\n\nSilvio Berlusconi’s career history is impressive. He was always drawn to success and prosperity, so he began working even while studying. He was not averse to any kind of work, be it trading household goods or performing in a nightclub.\n\nBerlusconi played the double bass and sang well, often performing on cruise liners. However, he gained real experience in the company Immobiliare costruzioni, which was involved in construction. The construction business became his main occupation and source of income for the next 20 years.\n\nIn 1968, Berlusconi created the construction company “Edilnord”. He bought cheap land around Milan and built two elite neighborhoods there – Milan-2 and Milan-3.\n\nThe flight path for Linate Airport passed over the first of these, but the businessman was able to negotiate a change in the route of the planes.\n\nAfter that, the famous “Sunflower” (Girasole) – the first Italian hypermarket – was built. In 1977, he was honored with the title of “Knight of Labor” (Cavaliere del Lavoro), and this award subsequently earned him the nickname “Cavaliere”.\n\nMedia Mogul\n\nHaving conquered the world of the construction business, Berlusconi turned his attention to the media.\n\nHe was most interested in commercial television. His first step in this direction was the purchase of shares in the popular weekly Il Giornale. Then, quite quickly, the famous Mediaset was formed, which included three television channels (among them the well-known Canale 5) and became part of the Fininvest holding. Later, Silvio Berlusconi added some French, German, and Spanish channels to his holding.\n\nThe areas of the holding’s activities were diverse – a network of supermarkets, insurance companies, and much more, but television’s share in the company’s capital was 85%.\n\nThanks to his passion for commercial television, Silvio Berlusconi occupied a place among the ten richest Italians and the 118th line of the Forbes ranking.\n\nAC Milan\n\nThe football club “AC Milan” was bought by Silvio Berlusconi in 1984.\n\nBack then, it was a modest Serie B club. For the tycoon, bringing his club to a high level became a matter of honor. He succeeded. Milan won the Italian championship 8 times (in 1988, 1992 – 1994, 1996, 1999, 2004, 2011) and the Champions League 5 times (in 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003, 2007). Cavaliere’s popularity reached unprecedented heights, and the club’s fans became loyal supporters of Berlusconi.\n\nPolitical career\n\nThe rise of his political career began thanks to football victories; the club owner became a real hero of the republic. In 1994, Berlusconi founded the “Forza Italia” party and was elected Prime Minister of Italy.\n\nThe victory was brilliant and unexpected, but the newly minted Prime Minister did not have time to reap its benefits – the government resigned without even serving a year.\n\nHe returned to the Prime Minister’s chair three more times – in 2001, 2005, and 2008.\n\nHis public service is evaluated ambiguously, often being blamed for economic downturns (his last premiership fell during a crisis). His foreign policy also raised many questions – European colleagues did not approve of his friendship with Russia and agreements with Libya.\n\n“Friend Vladimir”\n\nAmong the leaders of other countries, Russian President Vladimir Putin is recognized as Silvio Berlusconi’s best friend. Their meetings were always warm in nature, and the Italian Prime Minister even sang for the Russian leader, reminiscent of his youth. In 2013, Putin paid a private visit to his Italian friend, who at that time was retired and under a court sentence.\n\nCavaliere and his women\n\nThe topic of “Silvio Berlusconi and his women” is of lively interest not only to Italy but to the whole world. Berlusconi was known for his uncommon amorousness from a young age, and age and career successes amplified this quality many times over. The Prime Minister’s biography resembles a long novel with many characters.\n\nTwo wives – Carla Dall’Oglio and Veronica Lario – do not count, the public was more interested in extramarital affairs.\n\nNews was filled with messages about Silvio Berlusconi’s love affairs. The tycoon had something to please his beauties – some received a place on television, and the luckiest ones – in the cabinet of ministers.\n\nPhotomodel Mara Carfagna became the Minister of Equal Opportunities in his government, and dentist Nicole Minetti – a deputy of the Lombard Parliament.\n\nThe Italian Prime Minister showed generosity of an Eastern ruler to his beloved ones. Diamond jewelry and checks for five-digit sums were the usual reward for participating in fun gatherings at his villa. Ladies often repaid with black ingratitude. Patrizia D’Addario wrote a scandalous book “At your service, Mr. Prime Minister”, and Montenegrin model Katarina Knezevic blackmailed him with videos from parties at the Certosa villa.\n\nRuby Heartbreaker\n\nBut the most trouble for the politician was caused by Moroccan native Karima El Mahroug, nicknamed Ruby Heartbreaker.\n\nUnfortunately, the girl turned out to be underage. According to most, Berlusconi did not know her exact age, but a reason to accuse him was found. Ruby was in Italy illegally, which complicated the situation. Cavaliere was threatened with a seven-year prison sentence, he was acquitted only after an appeal. Ruby was an escort employee, and it is assumed that she provided corresponding services to Berlusconi’s guests.\n\nRelationship with Russian model Raisa Skorkina\n\nThe most faithful of the charming Italian’s girlfriends was Voronezh model Raisa Skorkina. She sincerely considered “dear Silvio” a generous and attractive man, telling that he often called her and sang wonderfully on the phone.\n\nRaisa said that the Prime Minister’s girls, including Ruby, incredibly boldly took advantage of his kindness, arranging their lives only thanks to a temporary relationship with him. Raisa Skorkina, commenting on the scandal with Ruby for the press, claimed that Berlusconi was not to blame, as he himself was misled about her age, since the dissolute Moroccan looked over 18 years old. Ruby’s biography was filled with relationships with rich men before, but the Italian Prime Minister was especially unlucky with her.\n\nThe last (hopefully) love of Silvio Berlusconi is Neapolitan Francesca Pascale, a friend of his daughter Marina, in love with him since childhood. According to Cavaliere, Francesca gave him “faith in selfless female love”.\n\nBerlusconi’s death – funeral in Milan Cathedral\n\nSilvio Berlusconi, the titan of Italian politics and media, passed away on June 12, 2023, at 86. His vibrant persona and groundbreaking policies left an indelible mark on Italy, carving out a unique path that was as polarizing as it was influential. Berlusconi’s friendships extended beyond the country’s borders to powerful figures, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin. His colorful personal life, punctuated by notorious “bunga bunga” parties, kept him a constant fixture in global headlines.\n\nBesieged by health challenges, including leukemia and a lung infection, he spent his final moments at Milan’s San Raffaele hospital, embraced by his loving partner, children, and younger brother Paolo Berlusconi.\n\nIn tribute to his monumental influence, the Italian government marked June 14, 2023, as a day of national mourning. This solemn occasion concluded with a state funeral at Milan Cathedral, a fitting farewell to a man whose life and legacy were as grand as the edifice itself. As the country grieved, flags flew at half-mast, symbolizing a nation in mourning for a distinctive and impactful leader.\n\nInteresting facts, jokes, scandals\n\nBerlusconi was elected Prime Minister four times, the first time his party received 43% of the votes. This is an absolute record for Italy. Only Benito Mussolini and Giovanni Giolitti stayed in power longer.\n\nHe faced charges in various cases more than 50 times – also a record for a political figure. Among the criminal exploits of the most charismatic Prime Minister are bribery, large-scale fraud, sexual relations with minors, and tax evasion. He was convicted on the last charge to a year of community service in an old people’s home. He claimed that he enjoyed serving his sentence.\n\nHe is known for his directness and risky sense of humor – a joke about Obama’s “tan” and horns over the head of the Spanish Prime Minister in a group photo is proof of that.\n\nHe is known for his tender attitude towards his appearance. A small height (165 cm) is compensated by a good physical shape, he has undergone several plastic surgeries. Raisa Skorkina considered her high-ranking lover “beautiful and pumped up”.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi happened to be the victim of a psychopath’s attack. Milan resident Massimo Tartaglia threw a souvenir copy of the Duomo di Milano cathedral in his face, breaking his nose and cracking his teeth.\n\nNews about parties at the Certosa villa caused unprecedented hype. Berlusconi hosted friends and leaders of other states there, providing intimate services was part of his hospitality. Once, the paparazzi got lucky – the hero of a secretly taken photo was the naked Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Mirek Topolanek.\n\nFAQ about Silvio Berlusconi"
