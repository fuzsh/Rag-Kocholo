        "text": "AC Milan take on AC Monza in the Silvio Berlusconi trophy at the U-Power Stadium in Monza. The game will be played in memory of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi who passed away this year. The Italian politician was the owner of AC Milan between 1986 and 2017 before purchasing AC Monza in 2018 which he run until his passing in 2023.\n\nThe stadium is expected to be sold out with over 15,000 in attendance.\n\nThis will be the first edition of the ‘Silvio Berlusconi Trophy’ which will be different from the ‘Luigi Berlusconi Trophy’ that Milan have played in since the 1990s as a pre-season tournament that Silvio set up to honour his father.\n\nMilan and Monza will wear special patches on their shirts to honour Berlusconi and the shirts will be auctioned off in support of Fondazione Milan. Milan will likely wear their away shirt as Monza wear the red kit at home.\n\nMilan and Monza face off at 21:00 CEST, the game will be available on Canale 5 in Italy and on Mediaset Italia abroad."
