        "text": "Silvio Berlusconi has left a huge legacy on the world of ‘calcio’ and specifically with AC Milan. As president of the Serie A giants he was a character loved and hated in equal parts. He took over as president of the the Rossonero team from 1986 to 2017 and in that time secured five Champions League wins. He took a Milan side in crisis -and after a spell in Serie B- and made him one of the best in the world promoting a team famous for “attaccare!” stating, “I wanted a Milan that was always offensive and spectacular”.\n\nHe is the longest-serving president in the club’s history after he stood aside in 2004 he after the approval of a law that regulates conflicts of interest. He returned later for a further two year spell (2006-2008) and after after becoming Italian prime minister, he was made honorary Milan president from 2012 to 2017. In July 2017, after 31 years of linked with the Serie A side, he sold the club to Chinese-led consortium Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux after protracted negotiations.\n\nBerlusconi oversaw the most successful spell in the club’s history winning 26 (29 if one considers the period in which he was no longer president but retained ownership of the club.)\n\nGoodbye to Milan\n\nOn April 13, 2017, the Berlusconi era officially came to an end at Milan. The statement from Fininvest and Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux, a Luxembourg registered company created by Chinese investor Li Yonghong, confirmed the transfer of 99.93% of the club’s share capital."
