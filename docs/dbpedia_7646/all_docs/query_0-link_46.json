        "text": "AC Milan will play AC Monza in the newly formed Silvio Berlusconi Trophy at the U-Power Stadium in Monza tonight. The game will be played in honour of the former Italian Prime Minister who owned both clubs during his lifetime.\n\nMonza are coming off their first ever season in Serie A where they exceeded expectations finishing in 11th place comfortably above the relegation zone with a 21 point cushion in their debut season in the top flight. Led by Matteo Pessina, the biancorossi played an mercurial style with big wins and big losses which evened out and put them firmly in the midtable.\n\nMilan beat them 4-1 at home and 1-0 on the road. Monza were the giant killers of the league though beating Napoli, Inter Milan and Juventus twice in their inaugural season.\n\nTheir big transfer news has been the departure of Nicolo Rovella and Stefano Sensi after their loans expired sending them back to Juventus and Inter respectively. The side have tried to strengthen up by snapping up two free transfers from Inter in Danilo D’Ambrosio and Roberto Gagliardini.\n\nThe game is a good litmus test for Stefano Pioli’s new system and his new signings. All eight are available but it is unlikely for Samuel Chukwueze, Yunus Musah nor Noah Okafor to start or even play given their limited training time with the rest of the squad."
