        "text": "Many people remember the mid-1980s for razzmatazz, excess and colour. Miami Vice and their flamboyant outfits, rockers Queen's universally adored kind of magic and thrill-a-second films like Rocky IV and Back to the Future.\n\nFans of Associazione Calcio Milan don't share such fond memories. The grand club had dreadful debts and a steady but dull squad. They had suffered two recent relegations and their European Cup victories of 1963 and 1969 were gathering dust in the archives.\n\nNot merely a sleeping giant, but a titan on hard times. Turgid football, grim future. Thankfully for the club, one fan with deep pockets and huge dreams, intervened.\n\nMedia magnate Silvio Berlusconi, who sold AC Milan to Chinese group Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux for around £630m on Thursday, first took control of his boyhood team in 1986.\n\nOne of Italy's most ambitious, wealthiest men even back then, he was determined to restore Milan to the heights of world football. And the 50-year-old yearned to do it with a panache and sophistication hitherto unseen in calcio.\n\n'We want to create a team which will last through the ages, with class, heart and style. Courageous at home and abroad. Spectacular and capable of winning international trophies. Remember, he who believes, wins,' said the charismatic new chief.\n\nBerlusconi bought the club from beleaguered president Giuseppe Farina in February 1986, but in true showman tradition, had a bigger inauguration in the pipeline. Later that summer came the official, extravagant opening of his presidency.\n\nOn 18th July 1986 Berlusconi and his newly acquired team arrived at the Arena Civica (one of Milan's greatest monuments) in three helicopters. On the ground, speakers blasted Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, aka the music from Apocalypse Now, just in case the spectacle didn't get the blood pumping enough.\n\nSix thousand fans welcomed their saviour in an event more like the arrival of the Pope or a rock group than a change in ownership of a struggling sports club. Outside their fanbase, the permanently grinning president and team were mocked.\n\nTo some it was tasteless and embarrassing. Legend has it, Walter Zenga, goalkeeper of city rivals Internazionale, later told reporters 'they can use those choppers to fly the causalities out.'\n\nLike most supremely-successful people, Berlusconi didn't pay attention to the naysayers, and made key moves quickly. The first was one of the best signings of his 31 year reign.\n\nBerlusconi personally chose Atalanta No10 Roberto Donadoni to start his revolution. The transfer was a coup because Juventus, a far superior side, were also interested. Few players embody the first half of the Berlusconi era better than Donadoni, who operated on either wing and occasionally behind the forwards, winning six league titles and three European Cups/Champions Leagues between 1986 and 1999.\n\nBut the most inspirational appointment came a year later in summer 1987. A quiet, bald chap with big sunglasses and bigger ideas. Second division Parma defeated Milan twice in the Coppa Italia in 1986/87. They were coached by the unassuming Arrigo Sacchi. Berlusconi was intrigued and invited the little-known tactician to transform AC Milan.\n\nOver the next four years Sacchi created a muscular, compact and pro-active team which won two European Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and a Scudetto. The ex-Parma boss hated the defensive mentality and trying to catch opponents on the break. Berlusconi lapped up his coach's advanced modern methodology.\n\nSacchi's Milan were always on the front foot and pressed mercilessly. Italian football had never seen anything like it. 'It was brave of the club to appoint me. Milan's masterstroke was giving me autonomy right from the start,' said Sacchi.\n\nThat team, also starring dynamic Dutch trio Marco van Basten, Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit, plus Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini, are still the last to lift consecutive European Cups. Their aggressive, cavalier approach earned the club millions of new fans around the planet and increased Serie A's profile.\n\nTheir first European Cup win under Berlusconi in 1989, featured two games which entered history instantly. Van Basten and Co humiliated Real Madrid 5-0 in the semi-final, and then crushed Romanian champions Steaua Bucharest 4-0 in the final at Camp Nou.\n\nA demanding man, Sacchi inevitably fell out with his players and left in 1991 to coach Italy. Berlusconi's replacement was another inspired choice, Fabio Capello. A tidy midfielder for the red and blacks in the 1970s, Capello solidified the team to devastating effect.\n\nDon Fabio led the Rossoneri to three consecutive Champions League finals between 1993 and 1995. They won only once, but it was certainly special- an unforgettable 4-0 dismantling of Johan Cruyff's Barcelona Dream Team. Marcel Desailly, Dejan Savicevic and Zvonimir Boban were the gifted new kids on the block.\n\nDespite domestic successes, the club suffered a dip from the mid-1990s onwards. When his side stopped qualifying for the Champions League, Berlusconi began pushing for an expansion to the tournament. But he also recognised the need for the right coach and new blood for the squad.\n\nThe last great cycle of the Berlusconi age began in 2001. Carlo Ancelotti was the driving force in the dugout. The former midfielder turned low key, flexible coach, took over after a difficult spell in charge of Juventus.\n\nA winner but never a boaster, 'Carletto' led the Rossoneri for eight years, reaching three Champions League finals between 2003 and 2007, winning two.\n\nAncelotti's football philosophy was similar to his president's. His teams were jam-packed with attacking players. The avuncular coach regularly found a way to accommodate Andrea Pirlo, Kaka, Clarence Seedorf, Andriy Shevchenko, Cafu and Pippo Inzaghi in the same XI.\n\nHe delivered the last two Champions Leagues of the Berlusconi regime, and holds a unique position as the only man of the era to become a European champion as a Rossoneri player and coach.\n\nShortly after beating Liverpool in Athens in the 2007 Champions League final, captain Maldini retired and Ancelotti went to manage Chelsea. The heroes of the glittering 2000s were ageing, the president and his right hand man Adriano Galliani found it tough to bring in new faces of the desired calibre.\n\nThere were a few more shrewd acquisitions. Athletic, ice cool centre-back Thiago Silva was a hit. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, unwanted by Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, joined and fired the club to the Scudetto in 2010/11.\n\nThe confident Swede's bombastic persona was manna from heaven for the San Siro. But the Champions League, which Berlusconi once called 'our cup' was a stretch too far for the squad.\n\nSince that last title in 2011 under Massimiliano Allegri, the decline has been marked. Fans used to the brilliance of the first 25 years of Berlusconi's rule grew frustrated. When his holding company Fininvest suffered losses, savage cost-cutting was urgent. Mega-earning idols, most notably Andrea Pirlo, Thiago Silva and Ibrahimovic, left.\n\nOthers retired, like Alessandro Nesta, Gennaro Gattuso and Filippo Inzaghi. They were never replaced. The three campaigns between 2013 and 2016 were some of the greyest and leanest in recent memory. Coaching gambles on Seedorf, Inzaghi and Sinisa Mihajlovic failed, bargain basement players didn't sway a crowd accustomed to the best of the best.\n\nThis season has been one of the most optimistic of the last few years. The energy and blossoming talents of goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, defender Alessio Romagnoli and midfielder Manuel Locatelli have produced some golden moments, including the 1-0 league triumph over champions Juventus in October.\n\nAnother victory over Juve, in December's Supercup (Italy's Community Shield) also gave a tantalising glimpse of a bright future. Now supporters are excited by the millions of euros new owners Rossoneri Sport Investment promise.\n\nThe 80-year-old bows out with 8 league championships and five European Cups/Champions Leagues, and said the sale was 'painful and emotional.' Website Calcioefinanza.it calculated that in his three decades he invested at least £735m.\n\nBerlusconi's place in AC Milan hearts is guaranteed. That's what happens when you arrive by helicopter and win 29 trophies over 31 years.\n\nThe smooth patron was never afraid to barge into victorious team photos, particularly when they had just won the European Cup and were celebrating with the famous trophy. Likewise he enjoyed fuelling amusing rumours that the most ingenious, effective tactics were often devised by him and graciously passed on to his coaches over grandiose dinners.\n\n'Milan is a romantic adventure for me,' the impresario told writer Arianna Forni in her book Leggenda Milan. Now his sweetheart is in someone else's arms."
