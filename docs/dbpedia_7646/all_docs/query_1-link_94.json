        "text": "Silvio Berlusconi has been discharged from hospital in Milan, declaring “the nightmare” is over, more than six weeks after the former Italian prime minister was admitted with leukaemia and a lung infection.\n\n“Today, after 45 long days, I finally returned home,” the 86-year-old billionaire media mogul said in a statement after leaving the San Raffaele Hospital on Friday.\n\nHe described it as “an incredible emotion, a great relief”, adding: “It was a distressing and difficult period, but after the darkness, I won again.”\n\nIn a typically impassioned statement, Berlusconi thanked God and all those who had supported him. “I never felt alone,” he said, adding: “The nightmare is over ... Long live life, always!”\n\nThe senator, who has been plagued by health issues in recent years, was admitted to the San Raffaele on 5 April and spent the first week and a half in intensive care.\n\nDoctors said he had been admitted for treatment for a lung infection, before revealing for the first time that he had leukaemia.\n\nThe Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, whose governing coalition includes Berlusconi’s rightwing Forza Italia party, led the congratulations for his return home.\n\n“Go Silvio!” she tweeted, adding: “We are waiting for you in the field, to fight many battles together.”\n\nBerlusconi led Italy three times between 1994 and 2011 but has dominated public life for far longer, as a businessman and media magnate and through his ownership of the AC Milan football club.\n\nHis career has also been dogged by scandal and legal woes, which for the past decade were focused on proceedings relating to his notorious “Bunga Bunga” sex parties.\n\nMeloni had visited Berlusconi in hospital on Sunday, saying afterwards that he had been “in an excellent mood” and was still working “tirelessly”.\n\nThe former premier also received visits from his Forza Italia deputy, foreign minister Antonio Tajani, and coalition ally Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigration League party.\n\n“Welcome home, Great Silvio,” Salvini tweeted, while Tajani added: “We’re all happy you’ve returned home.”\n\nBerlusconi had hoped to be discharged from hospital earlier this month in time for a Forza Italia convention in Milan but ended up addressing delegates in a pre-recorded video address filmed in his hospital room.\n\nDespite remaining president of Forza Italia, Berlusconi is rarely seen in public these days, and his health has long been a concern.\n\nHe was in hospital for 11 days for Covid-related pneumonia in September 2020, after contracting the virus while on holiday in Sardinia.\n\nAfter being admitted again last month, doctors revealed he had “chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia”, a rare type of blood cancer.\n\nThe disease, which affects mainly the elderly, starts in blood-forming cells of the bone marrow and goes on to invade the blood.\n\nBerlusconi’s cancer was in a “persistent chronic phase” and had not yet turned into “acute leukaemia”, the doctors said.\n\nIn March, Berlusconi was admitted to the same Milan hospital, where he spent four days."
