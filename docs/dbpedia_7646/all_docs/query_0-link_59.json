        "text": "AC Milan will once again play for the Silvio Berlusconi Trophy against AC Monza, and the date and time of the game have now been confirmed.\n\nAs confirmed by the club’s official website, this year’s edition is scheduled for the first time at the San Siro Stadium on Tuesday 13 August having been at the U-Power Stadium last year. Kick-off will be at 21:00 CEST, and will be broadcast live on Canale 5.\n\nThe game of course honours president Silvio Berlusconi, who was the most successful President in Milan’s 125-year history, with 29 trophies win in 31 years. After acquiring AC Monza in 2018, he led the Biancorossi back to Serie B after 19 years and then to a historic first promotion to Serie A in May 2022.\n\nMilan won the inaugural trophy last year on penalties, and this time around it will be a first appearance at San Siro for Paulo Fonseca. Not only that but he will face a Rossoneri icon in Alessandro Nesta, the new Monza coach.\n\nThe match is part of the celebrations for the 125th Anniversary of the club’s founding. The shirts worn by the players of both teams will be auctioned with part of the proceeds supporting a social project by Fondazione Milan, in collaboration with both clubs, aimed at helping young people in need."
