        "text": "The exact circumstances of his death were not immediately clear. The Associated Press reported that Berlusconi had been admitted to the hospital on Friday for checks related to chronic leukemia.\n\nHe had only recently been discharged from a 45-day stay over his leukemia as well as a serious lung infection.\n\nA onetime cruise ship crooner, Berlusconi used his television networks and immense wealth to launch his political career, inspiring both loyalty and loathing.\n\nFor many years he was Italy's richest man, with his sprawling media empire and luxury real estate making him a billionaire several times over.\n\nHe was also a dominant figure in Italian politics, serving three terms as its national leader.\n\nBut Berlusconi was also dogged by scandal around his personal life, particularly around what became widely known as \"bunga bunga\" sex parties, which ended up with him being taken to court.\n\nHe was still being tried over the parties as recently as February 2023, when he was acquitted of witness tampering. A 2013 trial saw him convicted of soliciting a prostitute, but that was overturned on appeal a year later.\n\nRelated stories\n\nPer an AP report on the February acquittal:\n\n\"Berlusconi's defense described the dinner parties, dating from 2010, as elegant soirees; prosecutors said they were sex-fueled gatherings that women were paid to attend and where witnesses described showgirls stripping provocatively for the then-Italian leader.\"\n\nDespite all of the scandals, Berlusconi only had one conviction that stuck — in a tax-fraud case stemming from a sale of movie rights in his business empire.\n\nBerlusconi's impact on Italian politics was far-reaching. As a businessman who knew the power of images, Berlusconi introduced US-style political campaigns — with big party conventions and slick advertising — that broke with the gray world of Italian politics, in which voters essentially chose parties and not candidates.\n\nAnother former Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, recalled Berlusconi's divisive legacy in a message on Twitter. \"Silvio Berlusconi made history in this country. Many loved him, many hated him. All must recognize that his impact on political life, but also economic, sport and television, has been without precedence.\""
