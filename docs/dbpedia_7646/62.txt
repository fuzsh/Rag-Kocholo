Silvio Berlusconi, the highly convtroversial former prime minister of Italy who also owned Serie A powerhouse A.C. Milan, died on Monday.

He was 86.

Berlusconi, who owned the soccer team from 1986 to 2017, had been hospitalized with leukemia recently. He was admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan on Friday, his second hospitalization in months. Berlusconi also suffered over the years from heart ailments, prostate cancer and was hospitalized for COVID-19 in 2020.

He had owned Monza of Italy’s Serie A after selling the iconic Milan franchise in 2017.

During Berlusconi’s tenure, A.C. Milan secured 29 trophhies in 31 years, which included eight Serie A crowns, five UEFA Champions League titles, one Coppa Italia, five Supercoppa Italiana, three FIFA Club World Cups and five UEFA Super Cups.

“Thank you, Mr President. Always with us,” A.C. Milan said in a statement, adding it was “grieving the passing of the unforgettable Silvio Berlusconi.”

“Tomorrow, we will dream of new ambitions, create new challenges, and seek new victories. Which will represent the good, the strong, and the true that lies inside us, in all of us who shared this adventure of binding our lives to a dream called Milan.”

A billionaire, Berlusconi was Italy’s longest-serving premier despite scandals over his sex-fueled parties and allegations of corruption.

Born in Milan on Sept. 29, 1936, Berlusconi was a banker’s son who earned a law degree. He sang in nightclubs and on cruise ships, before starting a construction company and built apartments for middle-class families. Berlusconi’s wealth came from his media holdings.
