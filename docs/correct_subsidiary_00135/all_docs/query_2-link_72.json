Banks Pick Up Pace Of rr Outsourcing Financial services firms seek savings through pay-as-v'ou-go computing deals BV LUCAS MEARIAN A COMBINATION of in¬ tense competition, the sluggish econo¬ my and the lure of pay-as-you-go IT services is prompting a growing number of banks and brokerages to outsource back-office systems and business processes. Several high-profile finan¬ cial services firms have signed outsourcing deals since early last month, handing off con¬ trol of data and systems in or¬ der to save money and focus on core business operations. For example. |.P. Morgan Chase fit Co. last week an¬ nounced a seven-year, $5 bil¬ lion agreement under which IBM will take over its data processing infrastructure. The contract, which had been in final negotiations since mid-November (Quick- Link 34352], includes a planned transfer of about 4.000 J.P. Morgan IT workers and contractors to IBM during the first half of the year. Utility Model Key The deal also provides for New York-based J.P. Morgan to buy computing resources and other IT services from IBM under a utility model, meaning the bank will pay only for what it uses. That factor was key in the bank’s decision to outsource, said Michael Sztejnberg, man¬ aging director of the Enter¬ prise Technology Services Group at J.P. Morgan Chase. In the current economic cli¬ mate, Sztejnberg added, “it is more attractive for us to be on a more variable, pay-as-you- use structure instead of in¬ vesting a significant amount of capita] in bricks and mortar and hardware and software.’' IJ*. Morgan’s outsourcing move came just two weeks af¬ ter IBM announced a similar on-demand computing deal with Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG. That agreement is valued at S2.S billion over 10 years and includes the consoli¬ dation of data centers and smaller server sites across Europe to a new IBM facility in Frankfurt. Also last month. Electronic Data Systems Corp. said that it had signed a 10-year, $4.5 bil¬ lion contract to manage Char¬ lotte, N.C.-based Bank of America Corp.’s domestic voice and data networks. In addition, Plano, Texas- based EDS inked a five-year outsourcing deal valued at Si.3 billion with Amsterdam-based ABN Amro Bank NY’s whole¬ sale banking business unit. The recent agreements are indicative of a larger trend during the past 12 months in which more than a dozen fi¬ nancial services firms have It is more attractive for us to be on a more variable, pay-as-you use stmcture. MICHAEL SnEJNBERO. MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE ENTERPRISE TECH¬ NOLOGY SERVICES GROUP. J.P MORGAN CHASE turned to outsourcing vendors. Twenty-one of 39 Fortune 500 banks, brokerages and in¬ surance companies surveyed by Gartner inc. in November said their top reason for out¬ sourcing IT was to focus on core businesses. Other factors that were cited included in¬ creasing shareholder value, improving corporate efficien¬ cy and reducing operational risk management. Many banks had been reluc¬ tant to outsource control of their data, said Gartner analyst Avivab Litan. “Now all of a sudden they’re doing it.\" she said, noting that outsourcing can provide a fast boost to corporate balance sheets. But maintaining the security of sensitive financial data in outsourced IT envirorunents “is a concern,\" Litan added. She said that she expects some banks to eventually “bring that data back in-house.\" Klaus Thoma, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said the bank expects to save $1 billion over the next decade through its outsourcing deal with IBM. Deutsche Bank is transferring 900 of its IT employees to IBM this quarter as part of the agreement. Key to the deal was IBM’s ability to update Deutsche Bank to state-of-the-art tech¬ nology while offering it a utili¬ ty model for purchasing IT re¬ sources, Thoma said. “This is being driven by our strategy to get rid of fixed costs (and] ar¬ eas that we feel are not our core competencies,” he said. Deutsche Bank felt comfort¬ able outsourcing its data proc¬ essing operations because IBM and other IT services vendors have proven that they can provide sufficient uptime and security, said Thoma. i OUTSOURCHNIIIFO For more stones and mtormation resources related to IT outsourcino. visit our Management Knowledoe Cenler- OQuidiLMia2290 www.oofflputwwor1d.com NEWS iitm American Airlines Secures Wireless LANs in Denver But airport wireless networks still pose securiU' dangers to corporate data BV 0AM VERTOH American Airlines Inc. has taken significant steps to se¬ cure wireless bag-matching and curbside check-in opera¬ tions at Denver International Airport (DIA) that a year ago were found to be highly vul¬ nerable to hackers. But a test conduct¬ ed Dec. 20 at the air¬ port by White Hat Technologies Inc., a Westmin¬ ster. Colo. -based security firm, found that corporate data is still vulnerable throughout airport waiting areas and air¬ line lounges Last January. Computer- world reported on a similar test conducted by White Hat that discovered American had been operating wireless LANs without any encryption in its section of the DLA terminal and had even pasted the IP ad¬ dresses of curbside terminals on the monitors [QuickUnk 26374]. A Positive Sign In what appears to be a posi¬ tive sign that airlines are be¬ ginning to look more closely at the security ramifications of operating wireless systems, l^t month's test was unable to detect a single airline wireless network operating without en¬ cryption protection, said Thubten Comerford, CEO of White Hal. In addition. American had not only removed the IP ad¬ dresses from its OneStop self- service kiosks, but it had also added Cisco Systems Inc.’s l ightweight Extensible Au¬ thentication Protocol (LEAP) authentication technology on top of the standard 4(>-bit Wired Equivalent Privacy rWEP) encryptioa. LEAP is an authentication algorithm that leverages the 802.lx framewoik and pro¬ vides dynamic, per-user WEP keys to protect data in transit. Sucey Frantz, a spokes¬ woman for American, said the changes are the result of a re¬ cent re-evaluation of security for all of the airline's wireless curbside check-in and roving- agent systems- Frantz confirmed that the security fixes are being made at air¬ ports nationwide. However, she lAas unable to elaborate on the status of those fixes at in¬ dividual airports. Ongoing Concerns On the downside. Comerford said White Hat’s test of the DIA facility still managed to pick up a suspected rogue ac¬ cess point CAP), as well as a significant number of vulnera¬ ble wireless transmissions em¬ anating from public traveler lounges and frequent-flier clubs throughout the airport. The public areas and most of the airport lounges use the public wireless network operated on behalf of the DIA by AT&T Wireless Services Inc. The American Airlines Admiral's Club lounge uses T-MobUe USA lnc,'s HotSpot public wireless network.

AT&T Wireless' ser¬ vice includes 54 APs spread throughout the DIA terminal and three concourses. Ritch Blast, a spokesman for Redmond, Waslt-based AT&T Wireless, acknowl¬ edged that the suspected rogue AP found by White Hat didn't belong to AT&Ts net¬ work. He also said AT&T en¬ crypts all persona] user infor¬ mation entered into the sys¬ tem during registration and log-on. including pa>'ment in¬ formation. Any other security precautions are up to the indi¬ vidual user, he said. Frank Ramirez, director of business products at Bellevue. Wash.-based T-MobUe. said his company is in the process of updating security for 2.000 sites across the country, in¬ cluding American’s Admiral's Club at DIA. In addition to allowing corporate users to take advan¬ tage of their own investments in virtual private network technologies while using the T-Mobile network, the compa¬ ny has implemented blocking technology at the AP level Ramirez said. He explained that users register on the net¬ work and get a Medium Ac¬ cess Control address. T-M(7 bile can block any system that's not recognized. “We’ve also implemented netwoik address tran^tion technology to shield the IP ad¬ dresses of the machines on the network from potential in¬ truders,\" Ramirez added MrnMIaMaadprt- lyNTT DoColla kic.BM«SrtllMwlM|iln- In <■( - li oMIta mM I* Hnfmip—nonDnc. awnni— IndwItHMh ¥kaMiaMdHnOnC>- tUmkuKiCtKaiK nnHHBlmt—ZW OmininialMci.hnM- tanOkhv: SBliandn SinunfliaiKlMn. /QirVMiBianiMlatacad tamrMgDtaidNnOgCr MMtllMiaiiitetoW’ CaWiniln iiaWKiiBM aiUWcriaaktafai diabf tin indnt 2004.

But a test conduct¬ ed Dec. 20 at the air¬ port by White Hat Technologies Inc., a Westmin¬ ster. Colo. -based security firm, found that coiporate data is still vulnerable throughout airport waiting areas and air¬ line lounges Last January. Computer- world reported on a similar test conducted by White Hat that discovered American had been operating wireless LANs without any encryption in its section of the DIA terminal and had even pasted the IP ad¬ dresses of curbside terminals on the monitors IQuickLink 263741. A Positive Sign In what appears to be a ptisi- tive sign that airlines are be¬ ginning to look more closely at the security ramifications of operating wireless systems, last month's test was unable to detect a single airline wireless network operating without en¬ cryption protection, said Thubicn Comerford, CEO of White Hat. In addition. American had not only removed the IP ad¬ dresses from Its OncStop self- service kiosks, but it had also added Cisco Systems Inc.’s Lightweight Extensible Au¬ thentication Protocol ILEAP) authentication technology on top of the sundard 40-bit Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption. LEAP is an authentication algorithm that leverages the 802.1X framework and pnv vides dynamic, per-uscr WEP keys to protect data in transit. Stacey Frantz, a spokes¬ woman for American, said the changes are the result of a re¬ cent re-evaluation of securit>' for all of the airline’s wireless curbside check-in and roving- agent systems. Frantz confirmed that the security fixes are being made at air¬ ports nationwide. However, she u-as unable to elaborate on the status of tht>se fixes at in¬ dividual airports. Ongoing Concerns On the downside, Comerford said White Hat's test of the DIA facility still managed to pick up a suspected rogue ac¬ cess point (AP). as w’ell as a significant number of vulnera¬ ble wireless transmissions em¬ anating from public traveler lounges and frequent-flier clubs throughout the airport. The public areas and most of the airport lounges use the public wireless network operated on behalf of the DIA by AT&T Wireless Services Inc. The American Airlines Admiral’s Club lounge uses T'Mobilc USA Inc.'s HotSpot public wireless network. What Corporate Users Can Do RESEARCH AIRUNES AND AIRPORTS thil olhr wvdess LANs tel avpvt standanl VPNsollwara. CONSIDER CORPORATE POUCCS m wlwn. where and how mabia uBsre can access pubic wirelaas networks. RESEARCH OPTIONS FOR CENTRAUZEO COMPUTING, such as X lanninib tet store seraKiwe data on corporate datebases and not on laptops. “The biggest danger at DIA is the sniffing of sensitive in¬ formation being transmitted by travelers.\" said Comerford. \"Few. if any. airports have ad¬ dressed this security vulnera¬ bility. { and 1 few airports or airlines warn travelers of the danger of using the wireless networks.\" In July, the cit\\- of Denver and DIA outsourced the air¬ port’s public wireless network, known as GoPort. to AT&T Wireless. AT&T Wireless' ser¬ vice includes 54 APs spread throughout the DIA terminal and three concourses. Ritch Blasi. a spokesman for Redmond. Wash.-based AT&T Wireless, acknowl¬ edged that the suspected rogue AP found by While Hat didn’t belong to AT&T’s net¬ work. He also said AT&T en- all personal u.ser infor¬ mation entered into the sys¬ tem during registration and ti^-on. including payment in¬ formation. Any other security precautions are up to the indi¬ vidual user, he said. Frank Ramirez, director of business products at Bellevue. Wash.-based T-Mobile. said his company is in the proce.s.s of updating security for 2.000 sites across the country, in¬ cluding American’s Admiral’s Club at DIA. In addition to allowing corporate users to take advan¬ tage of their own investments in virtual private network technologies while using the T-Mobilc network, the compa¬ ny has implemented blocking technology at the AP level. Ramirez said. He explained that users register on the net¬ work and get a Medium Ac¬ cess Control address. T-Mi> bile can block any system that's not recognized. “We've also implemented network address translation technology to shield the IP ad¬ dresses of the machines on the network from potential in¬ truders.*’ Ramirez added.

Cyberthreats Not to Be Eternised, W&ms Qaite Says Noilnerabilities still underappreciated’ as threat to nation’s critical infrastructure BV DAN venrOM The U.S. has ignored warning signs be¬ fore: two attempts by al-Qaeda in 1994 to use airplanes as weapons, as well as public statements in 2000 about terrorists being trained as pilots. Now Richard Clarke, chair¬ man of the President’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, is trying to prevent new warning signs from being ig¬ nored — signs that al*Qaeda's brand of terrorism has a grow¬ ing cyber clement and that the nation's economy is at risk. Before taking up his current post in October 2001, Claikc advised two presidents on cy- bersecurity and served as the country's first counterterror¬ ism coordinator. Most of his time now is spent raising awareness of the changing na¬ ture of terrorism and the in¬ creasing relevance of cyber¬ terrorism to the stated goals of groups such as al-Qaeda. “Cyberspace still is under- appreciated as a threat, and tito solutions aren't as obvious as they are with physical secu¬ rity.\" said Clarke during an ex¬ clusive interview with Com- puterworld Dec. 20. 'TVe have no clue as a country how to protect our cyberspace. It is a totally different kind of issue.” Unknown Security Holes Clarice said vulnerabilities in the nation's critical infrastruc¬ ture stem mainly fiom un¬ known security boles in wide¬ ly deployed software and from the constant influx of new technologies that often have unintended consequences for security. One of his biggest concerns is the growing use of wireless technologies, be said. There have already been cases in Spain and Japan in which PC- based worms have infected hundreds of next-generation cell phones, tricking them into dialing local 9U emergency systems, Clarice added. ‘Now. if you're a terrorist, the first thing you might want to do before an attack is take down the 9U system.\" he said. According to Clarice, the Sept. U terrorist attacks were a turning point for the national effort to protect cyberspace. \"Before Sept U. [al-Qaeda] was interested in kilting as many people as possible,\" he said. \"After Sept. U. (Osama bin Laden] starts talking about destroying the American economy. And he starts to talk about going after the econom¬ ic infrastructure of the United States. You could drive around a lot of truck bombs and really not do a lot of damage to the economic infrastructure be¬ cause it’s so diverse and dis¬ persed. But if you do it in cy¬ berspace, you might have the ability to hit the entire finan¬ cial services network simulta¬ neously.\" H We have no clue as a country how to pro¬ tect our cybersp^.

Clarke said he's aware that many people doubt the will- ingness and ability of terrorist organizations to carry out strategic cyberattacks against the U.S. But he said it’s his job to think differently about the future — and to do what some officials foiled to do in the months leading up to Sept U. A lot of Threats \"There are a lot of different people who can conduct cyberwarfore,\" Clarke said. \"There are countries that are creatii^ cyberwarfare units.

Portions of the 5-CHz band have already been assigned for unlicensed WLAN use in the Europe and |apaa But in a draft position paper submit¬ ted to d>e International Tele¬ communication Union (ITU), the U.S. government said it wants the 5-<>Hz band protect¬ ed for radar systems that can pick ’’smaller and less reflec¬ tive targets out of background clutter.” That phrase refers to small boats or planes that terrorists could use to attack U.S. forces, said John Pike, a defense ana¬ lyst at GlobalSecurity.oig in Washington. He added that the Defense Department is also concerned about its abili¬ ty to detect stealth aircraft that can hide foom most con¬ ventional radar systems. HWi Stakes Badri Younes, director of spectrum management at the Pent^on, aclmowledged that the war on terrorism has raised the stakes for radar operations. Attackers “could be coming from anywhere,\" Younes said, adding that the military has to be able to en¬ sure that its radar systems can work without interference from WLANs. Hie government’s position paper was prepared for a meeting of the ITU in Geneva on Nov. IL The ITU, the Unit¬ ed Nations body that oversees spectrum allocations world¬ wide, plans to decide on the 5-GHz matter and other issues at its quadrennial World Radio Conference (WRC) in <^eva in June. In the draft proposal, a copy of which was obtained by Computerworld, the U,S. said it wants to restrict the use of Wi-Fi WLAN technology be¬ tween 5.150 and 5350 GHz. The government called for radar systems operating in that band to be protected by a technique known as dynamic frequency selection (DFS). which wotild shut down WLAN transmissions if a radar signal was detected. Bill Calder, a spokesman for Intel Corp., declined to specify the DFS restrictions being sought by the Pentagon. But he said t^t IT vendors view them as too conservative and are trying to reach a compro¬ mise with the government be¬ fore the WRC meeting “We do not want to see that low band unduly restricted,” Calder said. Yotmes said Pentagon offi¬ cials are willing to woik with companies to devise a propos¬ al that supports national secu¬ rity interests and the needs of WLAN vendors and users. But Rich Redelfo. president and CEO of Atheros Commu¬ nications Inc... a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based maker of chip sets for 5-GHz WLANs, described the attempt to limit use of the technology as “trying to put the genie back in the bottle.\" Clyde Fnsslm, a spokesman for the National Telecommu¬ nications and Information Administratimi, a division of the U3. Department of Com¬ merce, said the draft proposal represents the views of all fed¬ eral agencies, including the Federal Communicatioos Commission. The radar section pertains to both military and commer¬ cial radars, including ad¬ vanced systems that commer¬ cial pilots could use to detect «small planes. Ensslin said.

There’s precious little money for IT investments this year, but the cash Premier 100 leaders do have to spend will go toward projects with mini¬ mal risk and surefire payoff. By Steve UHelder The YEAR IS BRAND NEW. but the budget chal¬ lenges are old news: very little money to spend and plenty of protects competing. Among this year’s Premier 100 IT Leaders, spendmg plans vary widely. As expect¬ ed, some IT shops face budget cuts driven by lower-than-anticipated rev¬ enue. Even many CIOs in h^thy in¬ dustries will rein in spending vohmtar- ily as a preemptive defense against a possible slowdown. Still others are already accustomed to spending less than 1% of revenue on IT — a tight budget to begin with. Peihaps most surprisingly, at least one past Premier 100 IT Lea^r is mcreasii^ his IT spending by 25%. In other words, technology spending in 2003 will depend heavily on indus¬ try and business needs. Some of the Premier UX) leaders will invest to meet federal regulations; others will double their IT training budgets because they have recently rolled out several appli¬ cations. Many enterprises, having spent years tryii^ to increase revenue through customer-facing techntriogy initiatives, will turn their focus inward, where returns are more assured. There’s a commcm thread among this year’s IT leaders, however. In for¬ ward-thinking enterprises, technology spending is now clearly and closely tied to corporate strat^. It’s a perennial challei^: In a recent Gartner Inc. survey of 1.S0O CIOs, \"strategizing for IT/business linkage” was listed as the Na 1 IT management priority, and it has topped other sur¬ veys for a decade or more. In leading organizations, IT is no longer viewed as a wild card or black box; its budget is scrutinized by an executive commit¬ tee. Proiects that get the green li^t are expected to produce results. Taking a Deep Breath Daniel W. Garrow, senior vice presi¬ dent of information systems and CIO at Mobegan Sun Casiro in Uncasville, Conn., has spent the past two and a half years presiding over a $1 billion property expansion and simultaneous infrastructure upgrade. He plans to focus on fine-tunii^ a host new sys¬ tems and applications. ’’We compl^ly redid our networic,” he says, which in¬ cluded bringing broadband Internet connecticMis to a new 1,200-room hotel for the $787 million casino operation. \"A lot of the infrastructure expenses are behiiKl us,” Garrow says. “In 2003, our focus is on cleaning up what we call logical construction debris. There are loose ends to tie up, interfaces that need to be tweaked. . . . We're taking this year to settle into our new systems.\" Among those loose ends is Mohegan Sun’s first suite of hotel management software from Lawrenceville. Ga.- based Inter-American Data. The hotel has Inter-American’s Lodging Manage¬ ment System LS up and running, but Garrow is still nne-tuning the system and integrating it with a proprietary Mobegan Sun loyalty-card program that lets guests earn points when they gamble and then redeem them any¬ where cm casino property. Even busmesses with improving market shares, outstandii^ brand recognition and sound business plans have been affected by the slow econ¬ omy, and Premier 100 leaders are ad¬ justing accordingly.

Watson will spend heavi¬ ly this year on a program that rational¬ izes Bacardi's supply chain software. The company long ago standardized on tools from Denver-based }J>. Ed¬ wards & COn but its four implementa¬ tions — one in Jacksonville, Fla., two in Puerto Rico and one in Miami — \"grew up separately” and use different data models that make information-sharing difficult, Watson says. Driven by busi¬ ness pressures, his IT team will create a single data model this year aimed at \"complete data transparency” that spans the company’s supply chain across geographic regions, he says. Like Watson, Premier 100 IT Leader Linda Roubinek is focused on helping her company achieve its strategic goals. As systems officer at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., Roubinek was instrumental in realignii^ the Colum¬ bus, Ohio-based company’s IT spend¬ ing model Last year. Nationwide launched a group of cross-functional strategy and technology councils that are in charge of setting the company's IT agenda and making sure all major projects contribute to that agenda. As a result of council decisions, Roubinek will focus this year on creat¬ ing Web-enabled tools for Nation¬ wide’s agents. “We’ve invested in CRM in the past,” she says, “but we’re dou- blii^ ^t investment in 2003.” The goal is to speed time to market for new rates and regulatory changes. That’s a stiff challenge, in part because Nation¬ wide does business in 46 states, each of which has its own insurance com¬ mission that roust approve proposed offerings.

But that’s a k»%- term trend; in the near future, many CIOs and business executives, having been burned by expensive enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) im- plementatioos that delivered desultory returns, are focusing on internal up¬ grades with relatively certain payoff.

In July 2002. the companies expanded and ex¬ tended their existing relationship into a comprehensive seven-year. $229 mil¬ lion services agreement. Previously. Perot Systems handled application development and network operations, while mainframe operations were out¬ sourced to IBM. “We just gave Perot the whole pie.** Guzman says, because projections for return on investment showed a savings of 35% over the ses'en-year contract. What Guzman likes most about the Perot Systems deal is the agility it affords Owens & Minor. When opera¬ tions are well in hand. Perot shifts its personnel to development tasks. Howard Rubin, an analyst at Stamford. Corm.-based Meta Group Inc., says such agility is a growing need for cor¬ porate IT “Right now. even IT depart¬ ments that have cut their budgets are too inflexible.” he says, calling heavy upfront expenditures for infrastruc¬ ture “the equivalent of buying an in¬ vestment that you can't cash in for 20 years.\" Rubin says turning fixed costs into variable costs will be a major trend among IT leaders this year. Tetecom Jitters Anoibet health care firm. TriWesi Healthcare Alliance, is also planning internally focused projects for 2003. Premier 100 IT Leader lames D. Gib¬ son. director of IT at the Phoenix- based company, which offers health care for Department of Defense em¬ ployees. says TriWest will upgrade its 800 desktops from Windows NT to Windows 2000 this year. In addition. TriWest is studying re¬ quests for proposals for voice over IP (VOIP) telephone service. \"We've not yet made the final decision to go ahead with that.” Gibson says, “but we’ve done a cost-benefit analysis, and we think it’ll pay for itself in two years.” TriWest is understandably nervous about the health of its telecommunica¬ tions suppliers: Its local service is pro¬ vided by Qwest Communications In¬ ternational Inc. and its long distance by WorldtOm Inc. Gibson says the uncertainty surrounding these compa¬ nies played a factor in his decision to invest in VOIP this year. Getting Out Front Leaders must anticipate change, and some Premier 100 IT Leaders are doing just that by adjusting their IT spetnling — before anybody tells them to. Emcor Group Inc., a global $3.7 billion con¬ struction firm in Norwalk. Conn., has enjoyed robust fiscal health throughout the economic downturn. But because construction lags the general economy, group CIO Joseph A. Puglisi is tighten¬ ing his organization’s belt in the budget proposal he’s now developing. \"We may have to control spending over the next 12 to 18 months, and Pm prepping my budget accordingly.” PugUsi has told IT managers to present their budget needs in three columrts: committed costs, money needed to sustain the level of services Emcor's IT provided in 2002 and mon¬ ey the company would need to spend in order to improve services. Puglisi says “high&lutin wanru-haves” are unlikely to make the cut in 2003. Improved security is a must-have, though, and it's an area Emcor will stress in 2003. Puglisi says he’s particu¬ larly concerned about the company’s Lotus Notes system. Emcor has 67 far- flung operatiftg units and ofien grows through acquisition (it bought 16 com¬ panies in 2002 alone). Often, an employee of one Emcor unit is asked to perform duties for oth¬ er units in his geographic r^on. This causes secure-access problems. “Notes has very good security mechanisms, but they’re rigidly defined,\" Puglisi says. \"If you tell Notes, The data with¬ in an app is unique to a company.' then a worker for Company A can only see Company A data. That's a good thing, generally — but we need to let him see data for Companies B and C.” Naturally, though, any access must be secure. So in 2003. Emcor is “un¬ derwriting a significant investment in strong walls with good tunnels,” Puglisi says. Upping the Ante Given the generally tight budgets this year, one of 2002*s Premier 100 leaders may be the envy of the class of 2003. Steve Matheys, CIO at Schiteider Na¬ tional Inc., will see his budget grow 20% to 25% this year. The $2.4 billion shipping and logistics company in Green Bay. Wis.. “spent the last couple of years putting our business in order.” Matheys says. Schneider's eight-member IT steer¬ ing committee sifts expenditures into three categories — run the business, grow the business and transform the business — and tries to spend 75% of all discretionary dollars on the third cate¬ gory. The company believes it can use technology to squeeze more expenses out of its supply chain, and much of the increas^ 2003 budget will go to¬ ward this goal. Matheys’ team wants to integrate two homegrown applica¬ tions that have heretofore stood alone: a proprietary decision-support system that weighs thousands of factors be¬ fore recommending a shipping method and the CRM-type program that cus¬ tomer service representatives use when quoting rates over the phone. Foflow the Leaders Although IT leaders' spending plans for this year depend heavily on industry demands and company needs, there's one important constant: In leadii^ en- teqjrises, IT budgets are driven by busi¬ ness strategy. This seemingly straight¬ forward linkage has eluded CIOs ever since the data processing department became the MIS department Difficult fiscal times, return on in¬ vestment disappointments following the tech spending spree of 1995-2000 and the maturation of the CIO's role have prompted businesses to allocate their IT budgets just as they do in other departments.

TKW^ is studying re¬ quests for proposals for voice over IP (VOIP) tel^hone service. \"We’ve not yet made the final decision to go ahead with that,\" Gibson says, \"but we’ve done a cost-benefit analysts, and we think it’ll pay for itself in two years.\" TriWest is understandably nervous about the health of its telecommunica¬ tions suppliers: Its local service is pro¬ vided by (^est Communications In¬ ternational Inc. and its long distance by WorldCom Inc Gibson says the uncertainty surroundii^ these compa¬ nies played a factor in his decision to invest in VOIP this year. Getting Out Front Leaders must anticipate change, and some Premier 100 IT Leaders are doing just that by adjusting their IT spending — befcue anybody tells them ta Emcor Group InCo a global S37 billion con¬ struction firm in Norwalk. ConxL. has enjoyed robust fiscal health throughout the economic downturn. But because construction lags the general economy, group CIO Joseph A. PugUsi is t^frten- ing his organization’s belt in the budget proposal he’s now developing. “We may have to control spending over the next 12 to 18 months, and I’m prepping my budget accordingly.\" PugUsi has told IT managers to present their budget needs in three columns: committed costs, money needed to sustain the level of services Efficor’s IT provided in 2002 and mon¬ ey the company would need to spend in order to improve services. PugUsi says “highf^utin wanna-haves\" are unlikely to make the cut in 2003. Improved security is a must-have, thou^ and it’s an area Emcor will stress in 2003. Puglisi says he's particu¬ larly concerned about the company’s Lotus Notes system. Emcor has 67 far- flung opieratii^ units and often grows through acquisition (it bought 16 com¬ panies in 2002 alone). Often, an employee of one Emcor unit is asked to perform duties for oth¬ er units in his geographic region. This causes secure-access problems. \"Notes has very good security mechanisms, but they’re rigidly defined,\" Puglisi says. \"If you tell Notes, *1116 data with¬ in an app is unique to a company.’ then a worker for Company A can only see Company A data. ’That’s a good thif^ gene^y — but we need to let him see data for Companies B and C\" Naturally, though, any access must be secure. So in 2003, Emcor is \"un¬ derwriting a significant investment in strong walls with good tunnels.\" Puglisi says. Upping the Ante Given the generally li^t budgets this year, one of 2002’s Premier 100 leaders may be the envy of the class of 2003. Steve Matheys, CIO at Schneider Na¬ tional Inc., will see his budget grow 20% to 25% this year. The S2.4 billion shipping and logistics company in Green Bay. Wis.. \"spent the last couple of years putting our business in order.\" Matheys says. Schneider^s eight-member IT steer¬ ing committee sifts expenditures into three categories — run the business, grow the business and transform the business — and tries to spend 7^ of ail discretionary dollars cm the third cate¬ gory. The company believes it can use technology to squeeze more expenses out of its supply chain, and much of the increased 2003 budget will go to¬ ward this goal Matheys' team wants to integrate two homegrown applica¬ tions that have heretofore stood alone: a proprietary decision-support system that weighs thousands of factors be¬ fore recommending a shipping method and the CRM-type program that cus¬ tomer service representatives use when quoting rates over the phone. FoHow the Leaders Although IT leaders’ spending plans for this year depend heavily on industry demands and company needs, there's one important constant: In leading en¬ terprises, IT budgets are driven by busi¬ ness strategy. This seemingly strai^t- forward linkage has eluded CK^s ever since the data processir^ department became the MIS department. Difticult fiscal times, return on in¬ vestment disappointments following the tech spending spree of 1995-2000 and the maturation of the CIO's role have prompted businesses to allocate their IT budgets just as they do in other departments. The Premier 100 class of 2003 welcomes this shift — and as a result are helping their enterprises succeed. I UlJeUer is a .^leelance writer in South- boro. Moss. Concoct him at sulfelder^ yahoacom.

Richard Gtus, senior vice president of IT. is on the cofxq>any's capital review and operat¬ ing committees, where IT projects are approved and funded. “That way, there are no surprises.\" be says.
