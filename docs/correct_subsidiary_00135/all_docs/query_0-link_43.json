        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Revionics, Inc., the leading provider of End-to-End Merchandise Optimization solutions, announced today the relocation of its headquarters to Austin, Texas, which will allow the company to more rapidly expand its marketing, sales, training and development organizations. To accommodate this growth, Revionics is quadrupling its Austin office space and has already started to aggressively recruit and place talent in the Austin market. The company will continue to maintain an office in Roseville, California, as well as its other locations including Scottsdale, Arizona, and London, England. Revionics’ new Austin office address is: 5000 Plaza on the Lake, Austin, Texas, 78746.\n\n“As we enter into our second decade of strong growth, relocating to Austin helps position us for more rapid expansion in the retail technology industry and offers our employees the benefits of a culturally rich city with a relatively low cost of living,” said Marc Hafner, Revionics’ President and CEO. “We are excited to become part of the ‘Silicon Hills’ community, which currently includes leading technology innovators such as IBM, Dell, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Google, Facebook, Oracle Corporation and more. With our global expansion, we also envision establishing offices in other regions of the world as our tremendous growth continues.”\n\nAustin is known as a breeding ground for high-growth Software as a Service (SaaS) and retail companies that are on the cutting edge of innovation like Revionics is. For example, 360Commerce, which was acquired by Oracle Corporation and is a leading provider of open store and multi-channel solutions software, and Homeaway (NASDAQ: AWAY), the world’s leading online marketplace for the vacation rental industry, both successfully grew their business while headquartered in Austin. Revionics also cited the incredible amount of top talent found in the Austin area, the favorable cost of living and the strong culture and energy of the city that the company’s employees will benefit from.\n\n“The Austin Chamber through Opportunity Austin is delighted that Revionics has chosen to relocate the company’s headquarters to Central Texas,” said Dave Porter, Senior Vice President of Economic Development, Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce. “Revionics’ innovative software solutions diversifies the technology industry in the Austin area while reinforcing the attractiveness of the region to out-of-market companies from states such as California.”\n\nTo view current job openings at Revionics please visit: http://www.revionics.com/careers.aspx\n\nAbout Revionics, Inc."
