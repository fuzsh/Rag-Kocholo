O v e r v i e w 1- 1 C H A P T E R 1 OVERVIEW This chapter contains introductory information for users of the Point-of-Sale application and encompasses an “Application Overview,” “Getting Started” in Point-of-Sale and the “User Interface”. Application Overview Point-of-Sale is a next-generation point-of-service application designed to enable customer-centric retailers to carry out day-to-day transactions. It includes industry-leading capabilities like fulfilling and returning web-generated orders and purchases, accessing cross-store inventory to save the sale, and saving the customer if the store is out of stock. The Point-of-Sale application is comprised of eight major component areas: • Daily Operations • Point-of-Sale • Administration • Clock In/Out • Service Alert • Back Office • Training On • Re-entry On All of these eight components are available on the Main Menu when Point-of-Sale is launched. Note: The Back Office button is active and provides direct access to the application if the 360Store Back Office application was purchased and has been implemented. See the Back Office User Guide for more information. Note: You can use Point-of-Sale wirelessly through the optional Unleashed POS module. See the Unleashed POS User Guide for more information.\n\n14. 1-2 P o i n t - o f - S a l e U s e r G u i d e Getting Started This section provides instructions on starting and logging in and out of the various components of Point- of-Sale. Starting the Application The Point-of-Sale installation is loaded automatically when the register is turned on. The application is running all the time as long as the register is on. You do not start or stop the Point-of-Sale application. To exit Point-of-Sale, turn the register off. Logging In and Out The Main Options screen is displayed when Point-of-Sale is launched. If any of the components on the Main Options screen requires you to logon, the application prompts you for a user ID and password. The logon may be completed manually by typing the user ID and pressing Enter/Next, then typing the password and pressing Enter/Next. The logon may also be completed by swiping a bar code or scanning a magnetic stripe card. In this case, you may or may not be prompted to enter the password. To logoff, you press Escape/Undo from the global navigation bar on the Sell Item screen. The Main Options screen is displayed. The Main Options screen is secure from unauthorized access since a User ID and password is required to access each of the components from this screen. User Interface This section provides information regarding the standard screen regions, navigation in Point-of-Sale, and the Main Options screen. Note: The Point-of-Sale application may have been customized for your organization. Because of this, the application may look or behave differently than described in this manual. The differences may include user interface, parameters, roles, and code.\n\n15. O v e r v i e w 1- 3 Screen Regions The screens are divided into regions and are named for ease of description. Becoming familiar with these regions helps you to better utilize this manual when asked to reference specific areas of the screen. Figure 1-1 Screen Regions and their Names The following table provides the screen regions along with their description. Table 1-1 Screen Region Descriptions Screen Region Description Prompt Each screen contains instructions in the prompt region. Instructions direct you to either input data or to press a button from the local or global navigation bar. You do not interact with the prompt region. Response The response area is used when one piece of data is required. You input data in the response region. Input for the response region could be obtained manually as well as through external devices such as a magnetic stripe reader or a bar code scanner. If the field has a default value, it is displayed in the response region. Prompt Region Response Region Local Navigation Bar Work Area Status Region Global Navigation Bar\n\n16. 1-4 P o i n t - o f - S a l e U s e r G u i d e The Navigation Bars Navigation is divided into three sections: global navigation, local navigation, and other navigation keys. The global navigation bar provides access to functions that are constant throughout the application. The local navigation bar gives access to functions specific to the Point-of-Sale application, such as Item Modification, Transaction Modification, or Tender. To indicate that a function is disabled, the navigation or global button is grayed-out. Status The Status region is comprised of several fields: • Register ID - Displays the register ID which is a unique identifier for the register. • Current Business Date - Displays the current business date that is set during the Start of Day process. • Cashier Name - Displays the ID of the cashier working on the register. • Current Time - Displays the current time. • Sales Associate Name - Displays the name of the sales associate that is linked to the current transaction. • Screen Name - Displays the name of the current application screen. • Customer - Displays the name of the customer for the current transaction, if applicable. • Communications Status - Displays the communications status, which is determined from the last attempt by the application to communicate with the server or device. Possible values for this field are Online, Offline, and Training Mode. Local Navigation Bar The local navigation bar contains eight buttons that are used to select application functionality. Each button has a label and an associated function key on the keyboard that can be used to achieve the same result as clicking the button. For example, you can click the F4/Item button or press the F4 function key. Inactive or disabled buttons are grayed-out. Global Navigation Bar The global navigation bar contains five buttons that are used to select application functionality. The behavior of the buttons is repeated on all screens, where possible, to facilitate consistency and ease-of-use. Each button has a label and an associated function key on the keyboard that can be used to achieve the same result as clicking the button. Inactive or disabled buttons are grayed-out. Work Area The work area is the region of the screen where data for viewing or selection is presented. In some instances, this area is used to display or collect information from you and other times it is blank. Dialog Boxes Dialog boxes are used to present messages or to request verification of a requested action. When these boxes appear, you must provide the requested information and/ or interact with the application by pressing keys or clicking buttons. These boxes have only an “on/off” state such as Enter, Yes, No, Cancel, Retry, Continue, and do not allow for data entry. All local and global navigation is disabled when a dialog is displayed. Table 1-1 Screen Region Descriptions Screen Region Description\n\n17. O v e r v i e w 1- 5 Global Navigation Bar The global navigation bar provides access to global functions that are available on all screens. When a button is grayed-out, this indicates that its functionality is unavailable. A brief description of the functionality of these keys follows. Figure 1-2 Global Navigation Bar Table 1-2 Global Navigation Key Descriptions Key Description F1/Help The F1/Help key enables you to access help for the current screen. When you press F1/Help, the help screen is displayed. You may need to choose Page Up or Page Down to find help for the specific topic required. Press F1/Done to close the help screen. F11/Delete On most screens, the F11/Delete key is used to clear any information that has been typed or scanned in the current field. When you press F11/Delete, the field is cleared and ready for you to re-enter new information in the same field. For example, on the Sell Item screen, you can delete (or remove) an item from the transaction. To delete an item, select/highlight the item and press F11/ Delete. The item is removed from the transaction. Note: If more than one item is to be removed, use the arrow keys to select the first item and press the space bar. Then use the arrow keys to move to the next item and press the space bar again.When all desired items are selected, press F11/Delete. F12/Cancel On most screens, the F12/Cancel key is used to cancel the current transaction or specific function. When you press the F12/Cancel key, you are prompted to verify whether you wish to cancel the current operation. If Yes is chosen, the transaction is cancelled or the specified function is cancelled and you are returned to the Sell Item screen. Esc/Undo The Esc/Undo key is used on most screens to back out of the current operation and return to the previous screen. Unlike the F12/Cancel key, the Esc/Undo key does not cancel the current transaction or specific function. When Esc/Undo is pressed, you lose all of the information that has been entered on that screen. Enter/Next The Enter/Next key is used to complete the current operation. For example, if you enter an item number and press Enter/Next, the item number and its defaults (description, price, default quantity of 1, extended price, and tax code) are entered into the transaction and are displayed on the Sell Item screen. When a key is pressed on the next function, the required fields are validated for minimum/maximum characters and acceptable value ranges. If any of the data is invalid, an error message is displayed. Throughout this document, you are directed to “scan the item or enter the item number and press Enter/Next.” You only need to press Enter/Next if you have manually entered the number. If you scan the item, the operation is completed automatically (an implied Enter).\n\n18. 1-6 P o i n t - o f - S a l e U s e r G u i d e Local Navigation Bar The function keys on the local navigation bar change as you navigate through the various components in Point-of-Sale. The functions of the local navigation bars are described under their specific component. For example, the function keys shown below are the keys that are available on the Sell Item screen. Typically, when you select another screen, a different set of options is displayed. Buttons that are grayed- out have been designated disabled and are currently unavailable. If there are more options available than buttons that fit on the screen, the last button is the More option. Press More to view the additional options. Press More again to return to the original set of options. Figure 1-3 Local Navigation Bar Other Navigation Keys Some key actions permit you to navigate the screen to scroll lists, move from field to field, or manipulate data in a data entry field. Other key actions result in changes in application flow that are specific to the context of the screen. Still others may have globally-defined behavior. Table 1-3 Other Navigation Key Descriptions Key Descriptions Up/DownArrows The up and down arrow keys can be used when a screen has more than one entry in a list or more than one field in a form. The up arrow moves to the entry or field above the current entry or field. The down arrow moves to the entry or field below the current entry or field. Page Up/Down The Page Up and Page Down keys are enabled for lists that exceed the viewable area of the screen. Press Page Up or Page Down to navigate these lists.\n\n19. O v e r v i e w 1- 7 The Main Options Screen When the Point-of-Sale application is launched, the Main Menu is displayed. This screen is called the Main Options screen. The Main Options screen is comprised of the eight Point-of-Sale components. These components are arranged vertically on the right-hand side of the Main Options screen. Figure 1-4 Main Options Screen Tab/Shift-Tab The Tab and Shift-Tab keys are enabled on screens with more than one field. The Tab key moves you to the next field on the screen (left to right, top to bottom, bottom to top). The Shift-Tab key moves you to the previous field on the screen (right to left, bottom to top, top to bottom). Backspace While entering information into a field, if the Backspace key is chosen, the character preceding the cursor is deleted and the characters following the cursor (if any) are backed-up to close the resulting gap. Delete While entering information into a field, if characters are highlighted and the Delete key is pressed, the highlighted characters are deleted. If no characters are highlighted when the Delete key is pressed, the character following the cursor is deleted and the characters following the deleted character (if any) are backed-up to close the resulting gap. Spacebar Some screens display a list of items from which you can select multiple items that receive the same action. For example, in a Return transaction if more than one item is to be returned, you can select multiple items by using the arrow keys to highlight the first item and pressing the space bar once. To choose additional items, use the arrow keys to move to the next item and press the space bar again. Repeat for each additional item to be chosen. To deselect an item, choose the item and press the space bar once. Table 1-3 Other Navigation Key Descriptions Key Descriptions\n\n20. 1-8 P o i n t - o f - S a l e U s e r G u i d e You utilize these components to perform various tasks in Point-of Sale.

D a i l y O p e r a t i o n s a n d T i m e T r a c k i n g 2- 1 C H A P T E R 2 DAILY OPERATIONS AND TIME TRACKING This chapter contains information about the “Daily Operations” and the “Clocking In and Out” components in the Main Options screen. Daily Operations The Daily Operations component is accessed from the Main Options screen. This component enables you to start and end a day (the same as opening and closing a store), open and close registers, and open and close tills. To access the Daily Operations function, press F2/Daily Ops from the Main Options screen. Enter logon information and press Enter/Next. The Daily Ops Screen is displayed. Several tasks are initiated from this screen: • “Opening the Store” • “Suspending and Resuming Tills” • “Closing the Store”\n\n22. 2-2 P o i n t - o f - S a l e U s e r G u i d e Figure 2-1 Daily Operations Screen Opening the Store The store must be opened every day because when the store is opened, the financials and totals are started for the day. There are two ways to open the store. The first is through the Daily Operations screen and the second is through the Daily Operations Wizard. When the store is opened through the F2/Daily Ops component in Point-of-Sale, the Start of Day function is completed from one register, the register is opened, and the till is opened. Each of these tasks are described below. Start of Day Function The Start of Day function includes defining the business day and the amount of money in the store safe. This function must be completed before any registers can be opened. To complete Start of Day: 1. From the Daily Ops screen, press F2/Start of Day. The Enter Business Date screen is displayed. 2. Enter the business date if the default date is not correct, and press Enter/Next. If the date entered is not what Point-of-Sale expected, the Later Date Confirmation screen is displayed. • If the business date entered is correct, press No. • To re-enter the business date, press Yes. The Summary Count screen is displayed.\n\n23. D a i l y O p e r a t i o n s a n d T i m e T r a c k i n g 2- 3 3. Enter the total amount in the store safe and press Enter/Next. If the amount entered is not what Point-of-Sale expected, the Reconciliation Confirmation Notice is displayed. • If the amount entered is correct, press Yes. • To re-enter the correct amount, press No. The Store Open screen is displayed, notifying you that the store has been opened successfully.

You are still prompted to enter the date of birth even if customer information, including the date of birth, has already been linked to the transaction. Point-of-Sale calculates the customer’s age and determines if the item can be sold to the customer. Age verification is done for an item when it is added to a sale, layaway, or special order transaction. You can bypass the age verification if this is allowed by the configuration of the Allow Date of Birth Skip parameter.\n\n36. 3-6 P o i n t - o f - S a l e U s e r G u i d e If multiple items in a transaction require age verification, you are prompted to enter the customer’s date of birth only for the first item that has an age restriction. If the first age verification was skipped and an item with a more restrictive age requirement is then added, you are again prompted to enter a date of birth. If an item has an age restriction, the Date of Birth screen is displayed. To handle the age restriction: • Enter the date of birth and press Enter/Next. If the age of the customer meets or exceeds the required age, the item is allowed in the transaction. If the item cannot be purchased because of the customer’s age, the item is removed from the transaction. • To bypass the age verification, press F2/Skip. F2/Skip is only available if skipping the age verification is allowed by the configuration of the Allow Date of Birth Prompt Skip parameter. Handling Related Items A related items situation occurs when an item, known as the primary item, has a set of other items or fees associated with it. When the primary item is added to a transaction, any related items can be automatically added or the customer can be given the opportunity to purchase items from a list of related items. For example, when a customer purchases a car battery, a mandatory environmental disposal fee is automatically added to the transaction and the customer is given the option to select a 12, 24, or 36 month warranty. A primary item can have multiple groups of related items defined for it. The following table explains the different groups of related items. If a related item is flagged as non-saleable, it can only be added to a transaction when the primary item has already been added. If the primary item is deleted from the transaction, any of its related items are also deleted. If a related item has an age restriction, the customer’s age is verified. If the customer is not allowed to purchase the related item, the primary item remains in the transaction but the related item is not added. For more information on age restrictions, see “Handling Age Restricted Sales” on page 3-5.
