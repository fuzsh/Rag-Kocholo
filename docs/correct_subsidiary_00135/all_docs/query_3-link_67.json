It plans to launch a standard addition to its existing retail software product portfolio to bolster its revenues.\n\nHYDERABAD: IT major Oracle is betting big on the growing retail business in the country.

The company is looking at adopting an India-based pricing strategy for the new product. It is also in talks with retailers in the country to sell its software solutions.\n\nElevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses\n\nOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIIT DelhiCertificate Programme in Data Science & Machine LearningVisitIndian School of BusinessProfessional Certificate in Product ManagementVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Product ManagementVisit\n\n“We are planning to release the standard addition early next year. Besides giving a choice to the small retailers , the product will not require any complex implementation procedures,” said Jay Bhow, senior director & centre head, Oracle retail centre of excellence at a press conference here on Tuesday.\n\nOracle has a global retail business suite comprising of about 18 products. Its software solutions for retailers include store solution, merchandising, supply chain, profit optimisation, human capital management , enterprise application and transportation.\n\n“Our solutions will help them enhance profitability . Globally, of the top 20 retailers, 17 use our software solutions. Considering that Indian retailers may not require all the modules and applications of our business suite, we are looking at a different option here,” he said.\n\nThe retail sector in the country is estimated to be about $350 billion, of which organised segment is around 3%. “The organised segment is recording annual growth rate of about 30%,” Mr Bhow said. The company’s retail customers in the country include LifeKen, Home Care Retail and Landmark Group (Lifestyle).\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\nIn terms of revenues, India is the company’s fourth largest market in the Asia-Pacific region after China, South Korea and Australia. “We expect it to become the third largest market in the region in future in terms of licensed revenues from our product and technologies. Retail will be one of the focus areas to drive this growth,” said Oracle e-business suite development group vice-president Murali Subramanian.\n\nThe $18 billion company is also planning to adopt a hybrid model, which include hosted services (Oracle on demand) and a rapidly enabling solution along with its hardware partners. “Indian retailers wanted to scale up operations and wanted to become a big players in the market. So we are looking at partnering with our hardware vendors to deploy smooth easily manageable solutions. Besides, retailers are very particular about their data and they may not prefer an on-demand model to manage their data,” said Subramanian.\n\nThe company is also looking at adopting the hydrid model approach in China as well. Oracle has made a number of strategic acquisitions including Retek, 360Commerce and ProfitLogic for offering a broad set of retail-specific solutions globally and in India.\n\nIt has also set up the retail centre of excellence (CoE) in Bangalore two years ago and currently employs over 250 people. The CoE will be leveraging on the company’s development centres in the country to offer local support to retailers in India.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nIncome Tax Expectations from Union Budget 2024\n\nIt took 42 years of grit and finesse to turn a 2-minute promise into an INR9,000 crore brand whose taste unites India\n\nWhat this Sebi proposal for discerning investors means for MFs and PMS\n\nEconomic Survey’s plan to drop food from inflation targeting is a bad idea\n\nDollar bear cycle may fuel emerging markets rally till 2029: Rohit Srivastava of Indiacharts\n\nLessons for Indian cybersecurity from Google’s biggest acquisition ever\n\nRBI sets stage for the first shift in monetary policy stance since April 2022\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
