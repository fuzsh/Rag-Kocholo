        "text": "(This article originally appeared in the Mercury News on June 11, 2006.)\n\nOracle has spent $20 billion in the past few years gobbling up more than 20 software companies as it seeks to grow in the maturing business software industry.\n\nChief Executive Larry Ellison’s grand vision for the software giant is to be a “consolidator.” So he has snapped up a slew of companies providing the large software applications that keep corporate America’s finances and operations humming. By bulking up in applications, the Redwood City software giant has been locking up new sources of growth.\n\nBut so far, Ellison’s acquisitive streak hasn’t paid off — at least not for Oracle investors. The company’s stock market value has barely budged in the past three years, although Oracle’s annual sales have increased more than 50 percent in that time.\n\nToday, Oracle is fighting toe-to-toe with archrival SAP to retain customers picked up through its acquisitions. And Oracle’s shopping spree has done little to solve the company’s fundamental problem: sluggishness in its flagship database business.\n\n“The stock has really done nothing for two years,” said Bob Stimson, an analyst with WR Hambrecht, who has a hold on Oracle shares. “What valuation do you put on a stock that is basically generating growth through acquisitions vs. true organic growth? Investors are telling you this isn’t working.”\n\nWhen the Redwood City company started its acquisition spree June 6, 2003, with a hostile bid for Pleasanton-based PeopleSoft, its stock was worth $13.09 a share, with a market value of about $70 billion. On Friday, its stock closed at $13.47 a share, and its market value was essentially unchanged.\n\nSeeing a payoff\n\nSince summer 2003, Oracle has grown from a company with $9.47 billion in revenues to one with an estimated $14 billion in sales for the year ending May 2006.\n\nOracle President Charles Phillips said in an interview that the company is seeing a payoff from its acquisitions, and that someday its applications business could be bigger than its database business. Oracle’s series of acquisitions, he said, is bringing it into new markets serving specific industries, such as banking or retailing. These markets have huge growth potential, he added.\n\nPhillips pointed to higher profits and a 22 percent rise in revenue for the quarter that ended in February, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. Analysts expect strong results when the company releases quarterly earnings June 22.\n\nBut analysts note most of Oracle’s growth is coming from its big purchases — PeopleSoft for $11.1 billion, Siebel Systems for $6.1 billion and Retek for $701 million.\n\nStripping out the big acquisitions, Oracle’s underlying business, including database sales, grew only 5.6 percent in the past year, according to Stimson.\n\n“Oracle’s core database growth is just not that exciting,” wrote Rick Sherlund, a Goldman Sachs analyst, in a note to clients in March.\n\nWall Street gives kudos to Oracle for its ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and make merger-related cost cuts.\n\n“We have said immediate clarity is the best for everybody,” Phillips said. “We make those decisions literally in the first 10 days,” he said, referring to decisions about who reports to whom, what products will be kept or cut, and what jobs will be cut following a merger. “Now having done this about 23 times, we kind of know the routine.”\n\nPhillips said Oracle has “swat teams” that come together overnight to make decisions quickly. “It’s like the green berets come out, boom, let’s go take care of another mission.”\n\nOracle completed its purchase of Siebel Systems, a maker of customer-management software, on January 31. Ten days later, it announced 2,200 job cuts from both the Siebel and Oracle sides.\n\nBusinesses use applications software like PeopleSoft’s and Siebel’s to manage finance, human resources and planning. These applications sit on top of Oracle’s database software, which stores much of a company’s data in searchable fields and tables.\n\nOracle’s database business still makes up the bulk of its revenues. But its annual growth is only in the single digits, while Oracle faces stepped-up competition from Microsoft and IBM.\n\nSlow to innovate?\n\nDatabase competitors say Oracle is taking its eye off the ball as it develops a bigger applications business, even as open source database programs, including MySQL and Ingres, loom as a future threat.\n\n“They really haven’t been innovating as much as they could,” said Paul Rivot, a director of information management in IBM’s database business. “We are doing very much the opposite.”\n\nMicrosoft, which makes the SQL Server database, saw its share of the $13.8 billion worldwide database market jump to 15 percent in 2005 from 13.9 percent the year before, according to Gartner.\n\nOracle and IBM, the No. 1 and No. 2 database developers, with 48.6 and 22 percent market share respectively, both suffered small losses in share.\n\n“Oracle is absolutely the leading tech visionary company in terms of database,” said Colleen Graham, a Gartner analyst. But with Oracle, long dominant in databases, moving so aggressively into applications, she said some customers have become nervous about relying on one company for all its software needs. “That makes people very nervous. They’re afraid of vendor lock-in.”\n\nOracle’s big push in applications is also fraught with risk. Customers spend millions on these complex products, which take years to develop and sometimes months to install and implement.\n\nOracle hopes to eventually move its new customers into a new applications suite called Fusion, which will weave together the best features of many of its acquired product lines and Oracle’s existing applications.\n\nCustomers are supposed to get the first iteration of Fusion in 2008, a deadline analysts and competitors believe will be hard to meet.\n\nBruce Richardson, an analyst with AMR Research in Boston, compared the task of developing Fusion to climbing Mount Everest. “You can climb halfway up and still be at base camp. We are talking about a huge journey.”\n\nAll this sows uncertainty among customers about whether to keep using software from, say Siebel or PeopleSoft, or upgrade to Oracle’s Fusion — or move to a new software supplier entirely.\n\nRival SAP, the applications leader, is going after Oracle business with its own suite of applications software and a discount program for Oracle customers called “Safe Passage.”\n\nBill McDermott, president and chief executive of SAP North America, said the German software giant had 240 new customers “rip out and replace” Oracle systems in favor of SAP, including Amgen, Samsonite, Whirlpool, Waste Management, Jones Apparel and Swiss Army.\n\n“Oracle’s strategy has put them in a very difficult position,” McDermott said. “It’s distracted them from their core business.”\n\nBut Oracle has its own “Off SAP” program, enticing 500 new customers in the past 10 months with license credits, Phillips said.\n\nOne customer that dumped Oracle was Swiss Army Brands, which had an old system from JD Edwards, which was acquired by PeopleSoft, then in turn bought by Oracle.\n\n“We didn’t understand the Oracle strategy,” said Tom Hennigan, vice president of operations at Swiss Army Brands in Shelton, Conn. “We needed to do a conversion now and we didn’t want to be faced with another one down the line. The new product might be fantastic, but we didn’t have the appetite to do another conversion three years after the fact.”\n\n‘They infused life’\n\nOne JD Edwards customer who decided to stay with Oracle said he was encouraged by its recent pledge to support older software for years to come.\n\n“I think Oracle’s acquisition of PeopleSoft was very good for JD Edwards,” said John Matelski, chief security officer and deputy chief information officer for the City of Orlando. “It allowed us to prolong the life of our current product line. They infused life into all the products that JD Edwards developed.”\n\nMatelski, who also heads an independent Oracle users group, said customers are concerned the company may be taking on too much by maintaining and supporting older software at the same time it’s developing a whole new suite. “They have assured me and others they have the resources to do it,” Matelski said.\n\nBut Phillips cautioned that there are misconceptions about Oracle’s development of Fusion.\n\n“We are not starting with a clean sheet of paper,” he said. “We are not taking all these applications and mashing them together. People think there is some science project going on. A new version is something we do all the time. . . . We are always taking code out and rewriting it.”"
