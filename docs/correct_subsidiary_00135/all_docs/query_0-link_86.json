        "text": "COMPANY BUSINESS\n\nRetail Pro Moves Closer to SAP\n\nRetail Pro (Folsom, CA), one of the leaders in store management software, particularly within the specialty sector, has joined the SAP Partner Edge Program. With this, Retail Pro's software suite runs on SAP Business One. Over 130 brands already operate on combinations of Retail Pro/SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)--including Oakley, Under Armour, Samsonite, Ibiza, Samsung, Sportline America, Sparta, and Maui and Sons--according to the two parties. Now Retail Pro and SAP will go to market in concert.\n\n\"Many of the retailers we support use Retail Pro and SAP Business One to increase efficiency and productivity,\" indicated Hector Vera, CEO of BES Consulting, business partner and distributor of Retail Pro, based in South America. Described as an integrated platform by the two parties, this solution addresses management of the entire retail process--from manufacturing to point-of-sale (and encompassing inventory, customer relationship management, e-commerce, and financial reporting). \"A greater resource to help retailers achieve the impossible,\" in the colorful words of Vera. Along the way, it makes data accessible across corporate, subsidiary, and supplier locations.\n\n\"Having already achieved record earnings to date in 2016, we look forward to a strong partnership that will arm both companies with greater leverage to empower retail and further penetrate global markets,\" declared Kerry Lemos, CEO of Retail Pro International. Another driver, of course, may be the growing success in retail of expansive firms such as Infor and NetSuite. A sizeable installed base of SAP Business One offers opportunities for Retail Pro, don't forget.\n\nRetail Pro Runs on SAP Business One\n\nToshiba TABS Taps B-FP3\n\nToshiba America Business Solutions (Irvine, CA) has shipped its newest portable thermal barcode printer, the 3\" B-FP3. With receipt and receipt/label models, the B-FP3 has print speed of 6 in./152 mm per second at 203 dpi and media capacity of 560 labels or 180 ft./55 m of receipts. In weight of 1.5 lbs. (with 2500-mAh Li-Ion battery), it measures 4 in. (W) x 3 in. (H) x 4.9 in. (D) and holds an IP-54 rating for water and dust and 5-ft./1.6-m drop resistance (with case).\n\nAs further benefits, the B-FP3 Series furnishes clam shell design, color LCD, flat-edge printhead, 16-MB RAM, and 64-MB Flash. As communications, there's USB 2.0, Bluetooth, and 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi. With emulations for ESC/POS, Zebra ZPL, CPCL, and Toshiba TPCL, the B-FP3 has software development kits (SDKs) for iOS, Android, and Windows CE and Windows Mobile. Media sensors include reflective (black mark) and transmissive (gap).\n\n\"We have incorporated an extensive feature set into a small ruggedized footprint that will enable organizations to operate more efficiently and effectively,\" exclaimed Bill Melo, Chief Marketing Executive, Toshiba America Business Solutions. \"The B-FP3 Series meets the wide range of labeling, ticket, and receipt needs of our diverse customer base, rounding out our barcode printer line.\" It's immediately available for the company's dealers.\n\n3\" Portable B-FP3 Thermal Printer by Toshiba\n\nALL IN THE FAMILY\n\nStar Expands With TSP650IIWLAN\n\nStar Micronics America (Somerset, NJ) has unveiled its newest thermal receipt printer, the TSP650IIWLAN. It joins previous models in the TSP650II Series with Serial, Parallel, USB, Ethernet, and Bluetooth. As WLAN, it offers dual-band frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. (As many readers know, 5 GHz provides faster data rates at shorter distances, while 2.4 GHz spans greater distances.) In addition, the TSP650IIWLAN comes with next-generation 802.11ac, three times faster than wireless \"n\" speeds.\n\nWeighing 3.8 lbs., and measuring 5.6 in. (W) x 5.2 in. (H) x 7.9 in. (D), the TSP650IIWLAN features \"drop-in & print\" paper loading, guillotine auto-cutter, gray or white case, and print speed of 11.8 in./300 mm per second at 203 dpi. Wireless connectivity is provided through an external Wi-Fi adapter (deemed simpler than the Star Wi-Fi power pack). This adapter also includes USB extension cable. As another benefit, the TSP650IIWLAN is fully compatible with Star Cloud Services, its digital receipt and customer engagement platform. Whichever point-of-sale software employed, retailers and restaurateurs may offer their customers the option of using digital receipts through the Star AllReceipts App.\n\nIn other news, Star Micronics America supplied its mPOP (for\"Mobile Point-of-Purchase\") in support of eMobilePOS from e-Nabler Corp. (San Juan, Puerto Rico) for the World Salsa Championships in Atlanta in December. An integrated subsystem for tablets, in this case the Samsung Galaxy, mPOP combines 2\" thermal receipt printer, 12 in. x 12 in. cash drawer, and locking tablet mount. \"By partnering with Star, we were able to offer the World Salsa Championships a complete POS solution that works really well in venue-based environments and has the ability to handle tickets, merchandise, and food sales,\" enthused Joel Vazquez, President and CEO at e-Nabler Corp. More collaborations are planned for 2017.\n\n802.11ac Wi-Fi in Star Micronics TSP650IIWLAN\n\nJanam Flexes Its XG3\n\nJanam Technologies (Woodbury, NY) has added Android to its popular mobile computer, the XG3. Launched in 2015 with Windows Embedded Handheld 6.5, the XG3 weighs under 22 oz., measures 3.1 in. (W) x 8.3 in. (L) x 7.4 in. (H), in gun format. In keeping with one of the company's doctrines, it stresses worker comfort and productivity, with better device balance (e.g., battery in the handle), high-resolution resistive touchscreen (3.5\" and 480x640), and long-lasting battery life (5200-mAh hot-swappable Li-Ion). A choice of keypads includes 34-key numeric and 57-key alphanumeric.\n\nIn technology, the XG3 features ARM Cortex A8 CPU at 1 GHz, 512-MB RAM, 1-GB ROM, and Micro-SD. A choice between Honeywell's Adaptus N5600 two-dimensional imager and Zebra/Motorola's SE965 one-dimensional scanner has been offered. An optional near/far imager, the EX25 by Honeywell/Intermec, enables the XG3-ER to read from 6 inches to 50 feet. It also has 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and support for Voice-over-IP (VoIP). Finally, the XG3 holds an IP-65 standard for water and dust and withstands multiple 6-ft./1.8-m drops to concrete.\n\n\"The demand for Android in the enterprise continues to escalate rapidly,\" observed Harry Lerner, CEO at Janam Technologies. \"We are thrilled to add the Android-powered XG3 rugged mobile computer to our portfolio, not only because it speeds productivity for our customers, but because it defies the industry norm with leading-edge technology and all-day battery life at a surprisingly affordable price.\" Earlier this month, Janam supplied its XG3, in conjunction with inventory management software by Straight-Line Solutions (Sacramento, CA), for Draeger's Supermarkets in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nJanam's XG3 Mobile Computer Adds Android\n\nALLIANCES\n\nStay Linked, CipherLab\n\nCipherLab USA (Plano, TX) has embraced terminal emulation from StayLinked Corporation (Tustin, CA) for its RS30 mobile computers. Unveiling host-based, thin-client emulation in 2002, StayLinked has developed centralized session configuration, control, and management of wireless emulation sessions (Telnet/SSH); terminal emulation application modernization (SmartTE); and terminal-emulation-related business intelligence (StayLinked iQ). It supports DOS, Windows CE, and Windows Mobile, as well as iOS and Android. Earlier this year, StayLinked hired Kevin Hoostal, formerly of Psion-Teklogix (now part of Zebra) and LXE (now part of Honeywell), as its Channel Development Director.\n\n\"Because of what it offers our customers, we are enthusiastic about StayLinked SmartTE on the RS30 Series,\" shared Hector Chavez, Director of Channel Sales, West Coast and Canadian Territories, for CipherLab USA. \"Our RS30 Series will now enable customers to breathe new life into their terminal emulations applications by enabling them to leverage their touchscreen. And with the embedded analytics offered with StayLinked iQ, warehouses utilizing the RS30 Series will have insights into their business processes they've never had before.\"\n\nIntroduced in 2015, CipherLab's RS30 runs Android 4.4 (KitKat), with Cortex Quad-Core CPU at 1.3 GHz, 1-GB RAM, 8-GB Flash, and Micro SD. With 4.7\" capacitive touchscreen protected by Gorilla Glass 3, it features an extra-rugged boot. A full suite of communications--including 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS--ensures location roaming, with data collection via one- and two-dimensional scanning, eight-megapixel camera, and NFC/RFID. With 8-to-10 hour, 2500-mAh Lithium-Ion battery, the RS30 weighs 9.2 oz.\n\nCipherLab's RS30 Mobile Computer With StayLinked Terminal Emulation\n\nStay Healthy, MagTek\n\nA different kind of ISV, addressing healthcare and financial services, has drawn upon payment technology by MagTek, Inc. (Seal Beach, CA). A leader in its segment, with over 2,000 customers, RevSpring (Wixom, MI) has adopted MagTek's DynaPro and DynaPad PIN/EMV Keypads as well as Magensa's Secure Transaction Services. It entitles its patient-engagement platform as \"Emerge - Intelligent Workflow Solutions,\" and claims to be the first company in the healthcare industry to receive PCI certification as point-to-point encryption (P2PE).\n\n\"As the healthcare industry experienced growing damages from data breaches, we had to offer better, more comprehensive payment data security measures,\" related Mike Alley, VP of Product and Business Development for RevSpring. \"This is why we are delighted to integrate MagTek's DynaPro and DynaPad and Magensa's Secure Transaction Services.\" As described by John Arato, VP and GM for Retail Products at MagTek, \"it delivers the highest levels of data security in the industry, as well as simplified and expedited payment processes.\" [Editor's Note: Magensa is subsidiary of MagTek.]\n\nA longtime supplier to our channel, MagTek rolled out its new Vendor Integration Partner Program, aimed at VARs and ISVs, at the Retail Solutions Providers Association (RSPA) Show in Grapevine, TX, in July. A dedicated Account Manager at MagTek supports development efforts, coordinates technical support, and assists with sales and marketing strategies for such \"VIPs.\" Additional benefits include free software development kits (SDKs), demo programs, and testing environment. In making his announcement, Arato, not surprisingly, cited the complexity of EMV and Mobile POS. As distribution, MagTek has BlueStar, Ingram Micro, Metropolitan Sales, and ScanSource POS & Barcode.\n\nDynaPro EMV and PIN Terminal by MagTek\n\nCERTIFICATION\n\nA MobileByte Out of Epson\n\nAn endorsement for the TM-m30 thermal receipt printer by Epson America (Long Beach, CA), this time from hospitality ISV, MobileBytes (Phoenix, AZ). In releasing its newest software, MobileBytes has added the TM-m30 to its cloud- and iPad-based package. With this bundle, customers may scan the barcode on their printed receipts for loyalty purposes. MobileBytes sells through VARs; it was founded in 2012.\n\nIntroduced in 2015, the 3\" TM-m30 features symmetrical, cubist dimensions of 5 in. x 5 in. x 5 in. and modular case, which enables either top load or front load configuration. Offered in black or white, it has print speed of 7.9 in./200 mm per second at 203 dpi. It has the company's \"ePOS\" technology for easy set-up with iOS, Android, and Windows. As choices in connectivity, there's combinations of USB, Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Epson also offers its 2\" TM-m10.\n\n\"MobileBytes provides a powerful and simple restaurant solution with robust POS functionality,\" relayed Tom Kettell, Director of Commercial Channel Sales at Epson America. \"Wait staff must be able to quickly navigate complex menus while providing top tier service. Together, we offer a comprehensive POS solution with the features needed for merchants to best service guests, increase sales and profitability, and run their businesses efficiently.\" MobileBytes previously certified Epson America's thermal receipt TM-T88V and impact receipt/kitchen TM-U220.\n\nEpson America's TM-m30 POS Printer\n\nPerforming Splits at TouchBistro\n\nTouchBistro (New York, NY) has been awarded patent status for its feature that enables restaurants to more easily and quickly split bills between customers. U.S. Patent #9514427, subtitled \"Graphical Interface and Input Method for Allocating an Invoice Amongst a Plurality of Accounts,\" was issued on December 9. This function leverages the tablet's touch and swipe capabilities to designate which diner pays for items ordered, or how individuals are to be grouped on the bill. All related texts and tips are calculated.\n\n\"This patent, along with our recent New York Design Award, demonstrates that we are design and thought leaders in our space,\" suggested Alex Barrotti, CEO and Founder of TouchBistro. \"Unlike generic register apps, TouchBistro has been designed specifically for restaurants, enabling them to automate or simplify processes that ultimately increase revenue and improve the user and customer experience. We are committed to continually investing in technology development to address the unique challenges restaurants face.\"\n\nAlso in this quarter, TouchBistro received $17 million in Series B funding, bringing its total funding to $30 million. To date, it has deployed approximately 19,000 terminals across 7,000 restaurants globally, processing gross merchandise volumes in excess of $4 billion annually. It recently launched in Spanish and French, and integrated with Square and QuickBooks. It offers 30-day free trial and no-contract subscription.\n\nSplit Bill Function Receives U.S. Patent\n\nINSTALLATIONS\n\nSkillNet Suits Brooks Brothers\n\nA contract for support and enhancement of store management software by Brooks Brothers has been awarded to SkillNet Solutions (Sunnyvale, CA). It focuses on Oracle Retail Xstore POS and Oracle Retail Customer Engagement. Started in 1996, SkillNet Solutions was one of the first resellers of Retek and Oracle 360 Commerce. Affiliated with the Oracle Partner Network since 2005, and winner of the Oracle Fusion Middleware Challenge in 2007 for \"StoreHub,\" SkillNet Solutions holds Platinum Partner Status.\n\n\"After an intensive review of the Oracle partners in the field, we selected SkillNet's Professional Services and Expert Services teams to support and enhance our store systems,\" reported Sahal Laher, EVP and CIO of Brooks Brothers. \"SkillNet has been a true partner, listening to our business requirements and adapting their offerings to a model that not only aligns with, but also complements, our operational structure, showing great capability and flexibility. We were impressed with their depth of knowledge on current store technologies and clearly defined approach to communication and transparency with our team.\"\n\n\"We are exhilarated that Brooks Brothers has selected us to support and continue development of their store systems and omnichannel roadmap,\" contributed Anurag Mehta, COO for SkillNet Solutions. \"It's an absolute privilege to be able to support one of America's oldest and highly regarded fashion retailers, and we look forward to helping their IT team maintain its high standards of quality and excellence for the customers of Brooks Brothers.\" It covers 250 stores in North America.\n\nSkillNet Supports Oracle Retail for Clothier\n\nIngenico Hits the Roof\n\nIngenico (Atlanta, GA) will supply its iSC Touch 480 payment terminals for the Red Roof Inn. Approximately 900 terminals will be deployed across 470 properties in the U.S. \"With our smart terminals, we are able to significantly enhance the checkout experience for Red Roof's customers by providing an interactive solution for POS,\" relayed Scott Tubbs, Chief Revenue Officer at the Ingenico Group.\n\nIn addition to its color touchscreen capability (7\" capacitive, 16:9 WVGA), the iSC Touch 480 supports the range of payment technologies--magnetic-stripe readers (MSR), signature capture, EMV (Chip & PIN and Chip & Sign), and contactless NFC (Apple Pay and Android Pay). In addressing security, it carries point-to-point encryption (P2PE) and PCI PTS 3.x/4.x and runs Telium 2 O/S. [Editor's Note: In making the announcement, Ingenico emphasized that chargebacks in the hotel industry are typically much higher than other segments.]\n\n\"At Red Roof, we pride ourselves on providing a superior customer experience,\" expressed Jeff Linden, CIO at Red Roof Inn. \"With a seamless payment experience provided by Ingenico Group, we are able to exceed our guests' expectations by delivering a multimedia solution, which enhances interactivity and engagement at the point-of-sale during check-in and check-out.\" In conjunction with the upgrade from older terminals by Ingenico, Red Roof Inn is rolling out its new marketing effort, \"Red Roof+\"; its loyalty program is called \"RediCard.\"\n\nRed Roof Inn Adopts Ingenico's iSC Touch 480\n\nChannel Factoid\n\nForget the Baby Boomers (52 to 70), move over Generation X (35 to 52) and Millennials (18 to 35). Generation Z (10 to 18) wants to be heard. So what do they think? Some answers from recent research in the U.S. and Canada by HRC Retail Advisory. As starter, while more than 60% of consumers visit the mall or shopping center at least once per month, it's 72% for Generation Z. They spend more time (90 minutes) and visit more stores (four or five). Among consumers in general, 62% would prefer gift cards; this jumps to 69% of Generation Z. (Talk about lazy: for Millennials with children, earning more than $150K, 96% plan to include gift cards in their holiday shopping.) Somewhat surprisingly, Generation Z shoppers tend not to be strongly influenced by celebrity endorsements from athletes, actors, and musicians. In contrast, 61% of their purchase decisions are strongly influenced by friends, with 13% being influenced by bloggers. As one would predict, social media weighs heavily: about 50% of Millennial and Generation Z access social media while they shop. Of this time, most is on Facebook (61%), followed by YouTube (38%), and Instagram (24%). Along the same lines, amazon.com leads the way in online shopping, with fully 79% of consumers of any age making such purchases. (Here, 66% of Millennials place an online order once per month.) \"In order for retailers to remain competitive, they must begin to develop a balanced approach to serving Baby Boomers and Generation X--who still have the great majority of the spending budget--while positioning themselves to best serve the emerging and future consumer segments for longer term success,\" counseled Farla Efros, President of HRC Retail Advisory.\n\nHELLO GOODBYE\n\nOh, O.B.!\n\niPayment Inc. (New York, New York) has elevated O.B. Rawls IV to CEO and President. A 30-year veteran of the payments industry, Rawls joined iPayment in April as Co-President.
