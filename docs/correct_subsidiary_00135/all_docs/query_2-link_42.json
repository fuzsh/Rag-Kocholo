        "text": "Introduction\n\nSalesforce, the world's best customer success management platform, is a platform where many processes such as sales, service, market analysis and customer connections can be carried out. It has gathered the unique CRM (customer relationship management) solutions it offers under a unique integrated platform. With the point of view it offers in order to prevent differences of opinion between departments, customer requests can be followed under a common perspective. Today, it offers customized solutions for everyone with its customer network of 150,000 distinguished companies and plays the role of the biggest supporter in the development processes of businesses.\n\nWhat is Salesforce?\n\nSalesforce is a cloud computing service (SaaS) company that has been around since 1999.\n\nThe Salesforce CRM product is Customer 360, an integrated platform with multiple modules for sales, service, marketing, commerce, interaction, analytics, communities, productivity, and more. In other words, it is a platform that offers a 360-degree customer view.\n\nCustomer 360 not only offers a customer view, but also lets you use third-party apps or create your own apps to extend its functionality. It also includes the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform to connect any app, data or device you use.\n\nClient 360 also offers industry-specific solutions for financial services, healthcare, and philanthropy. Companies use Salesforce for everything from tracking customer information to analyzing customer data for marketing and sales opportunities.\n\nThe Salesforce Customer Platform covers sales force automation, customer service and support applications, marketing automation, partner management, business intelligence, application development, Internet of Things (IoT), integration and cloud services.\n\nSalesforce CRM is not a single product; It is a seamless integrated solution that manages interactions between customers, partners and employees to help companies grow and succeed.\n\nSalesforce tools make developing on the Salesforce Customer 360 Platform simple. You get integrated, end-to-end lifecycle management designed for high-performance agile development. You can develop in single-use scratch orgs, work with code in a version-control system directly from the command line, and implement continuous integration to streamline your development process.\n\nThe Customer 360 Platform is built with the Lightning Component framework, which allows developers to build on skills they already have to create apps, user interfaces, and reusable custom components in Salesforce. The Lightning Component framework makes it easy to work with the latest web standards while providing specialized features to work with Salesforce data and metadata.\n\nOur developer experience is flexible, which means that your team can build together, using tools they already know and love.\n\nSalesforce organizes your data into objects and records. You can think of objects like a tab on a spreadsheet, and a record like a single row of data. You can access objects from the navigation bar. Select any record to drill into a specific account, contact, opportunity, or any other record in Salesforce. So what exactly are objects and records?\n\nexplanatıon RecordAn item you are tracking in your database; if your data is like a spreadsheet, then a record is a row on the spreadsheet.FieldA place where you store a value, like a name or address; using our spreadsheet example, a field would be a column on the spreadsheet.ObjectA table in the database; in that spreadsheet example, an object is a tab on the spreadsheet.OrgShort for “organization,” the place where all your data, configuration, and customization lives. You and your users log in to access it. You might also hear this called “your instance of Salesforce”.AppA set of fields, objects, permissions, and functionality to support a business process.\n\nSo, that’s objects, records, and more, and now you have some insight into how your data is organized in Salesforce using our spreadsheet example. But unlike an actual spreadsheet, your Salesforce data is stored in our trusted, secure cloud and has an easy-to-use interface, which you can access both from the desktop and your mobile device. And using point-and-click tools, you can easily import your data into Salesforce. Salesforce comes with a set of standard objects already set up and ready for use.\n\nLightning Experience is a modern, productive user experience designed to help your sales team close more deals and sell faster and smarter. When we’re talking about Lightning Experience, we’re talking about pages in Salesforce optimized for sales use. We’re talking about new features that help your sales reps focus on the right deals and the right activities, every time they log into Salesforce. We’re talking flexible, interactive tools that the sales rep can use to visualize data on the fly and work deals in flight.\n\nWhat is CRM?\n\nCRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. This technology allows you to manage relationships with your customers and prospects and track data related to all of your interactions. It also helps teams collaborate, both internally and externally, gather insights from social media, track important metrics, and communicate via email, phone, social, and other channels.\n\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) is a complete software system that manages customer relationships, but it is not a single solution. A comprehensive suite of cloud solutions that support every point of customer interaction is needed to effectively manage, analyze and improve your customer relationships. Therefore, the CRM solution must include a sales cloud, service cloud, commerce cloud, and marketing cloud, as well as a customer data platform (CDP) that can combine online, offline, and third-party data sources to get an always up-to-date and comprehensive customer view.\n\nThe CRM system collects, connects, and analyzes all customer-related data, including customer information, interactions with company representatives, purchases, service requests, assets, and offers. The system then allows users to access this data and understands what is happening at each touchpoint. With this understanding, a complete customer profile is developed and a strong relationship is established with the customer.\n\nFor more information about CRM, What is CRM? You can check our article.\n\nWhich Companies Use Salesforce?\n\nSalesforce CRM solutions are used by more than 150,000 companies worldwide. Among these companies, there are companies on the Fortune 500 list such as Coca Cola, Philips, GE, and there are also small and medium-sized companies. You can review the success stories of these companies on the Salesforce website.\n\nWhat Are Salesforce Modules?\n\nHow to Use Salesforce?\n\nYou can access Salesforce without any installation on your computer, using only the internet and a web browser, or you can follow your processes anywhere you want via Salesforce's mobile application.\n\nWhat are Salesforce usage areas?\n\nWe’re living in a time of great change, when technology is evolving so quickly that it can be hard to keep pace.\n\nThroughout human history, there have been three main industrial revolutions: (1) steam, (2) electricity, and (3) computing, with the latter powered largely by the rise of the Internet. But now we’re in the middle of a fourth industrial revolution defined by all kinds of new and emerging tech that is providing continuous experiences and connecting people in entirely new ways.\n\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution has introduced a host of new technologies, including:\n\nRobotics\n\n3D printing\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) and connected devices\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning\n\nVirtual and augmented reality\n\nSince the founding of Salesforce, many businesses around the world have experienced dramatic increases in growth and sales. When you use the Salesforce CRM Platform, you will experience the increase in customer volume that is inherent in adopting the Salesforce CRM Platform.\n\nMany small businesses use Salesforce CRM to get the most out of their assets; These include their customers, people and technologies. Salesforce has long been the go-to solution for many industries because of built-in features that help move forward. Industries that use the Salesforce platform the most include insurance, chemistry, FMCG, and textiles.\n\nWhat Languages Does Salesforce Cover?\n\nFully supported languages, end-user languages, and platform-only languages are the three categories of language support that Salesforce offers. Salesforce features and user interface (UI) text are displayed in the selected language for languages that are fully supported. Individual users are given the option to change the company's default language for end-user-facing UI through end-user languages. Use platform-only languages to localize apps and customized functionality that you create on the Salesforce Platform when Salesforce doesn't offer default translations.\n\nEach language is identified by a two-character language code, such as en. For languages that vary based on location, a five-character locale code is utilized. for instance, en AU\n\nFully Supported Languages\n\nFrom the Setup page, you can select one of the following fully supported languages as the language for all features, including Help. In the Quick Find box, type \"company information,\" click \"company information,\" and then click \"edit.\" Choose the language you want to use in the Default language section, then click Save.\n\nChinese (Simplified): zh_CN\n\nChinese (Traditional): zh_TW\n\nDanish: da\n\nDutch: nl_NL\n\nEnglish: en_US\n\nFinnish: fi\n\nFrench: fr\n\nGerman: de\n\nItalian: it\n\nJapanese: ja\n\nKorean: ko\n\nNorwegian: no\n\nPortuguese (Brazil): pt_BR\n\nRussian: ru\n\nSpanish: es\n\nSpanish (Mexico): es_MX Spanish (Mexico) defaults to Spanish for customer-defined translations.\n\nSwedish: sv\n\nThai: th The Salesforce user interface is fully translated to Thai, but Help is in English.\n\nEnd-User Languages\n\nEnd-user languages are useful if you have a multilingual organization or partners who speak languages other than your company’s default language. For end-user languages, Salesforce provides translated labels for standard objects and pages, except admin pages, Setup, and Help. Some clouds and features support a subset of these languages in the UI. Don’t use end-user languages as corporate languages. Salesforce doesn’t provide customer support in end-user languages.\n\nArabic: ar\n\nBulgarian: bg\n\nCroatian: hr\n\nCzech: cs\n\nEnglish (UK): en_GB\n\nGreek: el\n\nHebrew: iw\n\nHungarian: hu\n\nIndonesian: in\n\nPolish: pl\n\nPortuguese (European): pt_PT\n\nRomanian: ro\n\nSlovak: sk\n\nSlovenian: sl\n\nTurkish: tr\n\nUkrainian: uk\n\nVietnamese: vi\n\nPlatform-Only Languages\n\nIn situations where Salesforce doesn’t provide default translations, use platform-only languages to localize apps and custom functionality that you build on the Salesforce Platform. You can translate items such as custom labels, custom objects, and field names. You can also rename most standard objects, labels, and fields. Informational text and non-field label text aren’t translatable.\n\nPlatform-only languages are available in all places where you can select a language in the application. However, when you select a platform-only language, all standard Salesforce labels default to English or, in select cases, to an end-user or fully supported language.\n\nWhen you specify a platform-only language, labels for standard objects and fields default to English, except:\n\nDutch (Belgium) defaults to Dutch\n\nEnglish (Australia), English (India), English (Malaysia), and English (Philippines) default to English (UK)\n\nFrench (Belgium), French (Canada), French (Luxembourg), and French (Switzerland) default to French\n\nGerman (Austria), German (Belgium), German (Luxembourg), and German (Switzerland) default to German\n\nItalian (Switzerland) defaults to Italian\n\nMalay defaults to Indonesian\n\nMontenegrin defaults to Serbian (Latin)\n\nRomanian (Moldova) defaults to Romanian\n\nThe following platform-only languages are supported.\n\nAlbanian: sq\n\nAfrikaans: af\n\nAmharic: am\n\nArabic (Algeria): ar_DZ\n\nArabic (Bahrain): ar_BH\n\nArabic (Egypt): ar_EG\n\nArabic (Iraq): ar_IQ\n\nArabic (Jordan): ar_JO\n\nArabic (Kuwait): ar_KW\n\nArabic (Lebanon): ar_LB\n\nArabic (Libya): ar_LY\n\nArabic (Morocco): ar_MA\n\nArabic (Oman): ar_OM\n\nArabic (Qatar): ar_QA\n\nArabic (Saudi Arabia): ar_SA\n\nArabic (Sudan): ar_SD\n\nArabic (Syria): ar_SY\n\nArabic (Tunisia): ar_TN\n\nArabic (United Arab Emirates): ar_AE\n\nArabic (Yemen): ar_YE\n\nArmenian: hy\n\nBasque: eu\n\nBosnian: bs\n\nBengali: bn\n\nBurmese: my\n\nCatalan: ca\n\nChinese (Hong Kong): zh_HK\n\nChinese (Singapore): zh_SG\n\nChinese (Malaysia): zh_MY\n\nDutch (Belgium): nl_BE\n\nEnglish (Australia): en_AU\n\nEnglish (Belgium): en_BE\n\nEnglish (Canada): en_CA\n\nEnglish (Cyprus): en_CY\n\nEnglish (Germany): en_DE\n\nEnglish (Hong Kong): en_HK\n\nEnglish (India): en_IN\n\nEnglish (Ireland): en_IE\n\nEnglish (Israel): en_IL\n\nEnglish (Malaysia): en_MY\n\nEnglish (Malta): en_MT\n\nEnglish (Netherlands): en_NL\n\nEnglish (New Zealand): en_NZ\n\nEnglish (Philippines): en_PH\n\nEnglish (Singapore): en_SG\n\nEnglish (South Africa): en_ZA\n\nEnglish (United Arab Emirates): en_AE\n\nEstonian: et\n\nFarsi: fa\n\nFrench (Belgium): fr_BE\n\nFrench (Canada): fr_CA\n\nFrench (Luxembourg): fr_LU\n\nFrench (Morocco): fr_MA\n\nFrench (Switzerland): fr_CH\n\nGeorgian: ka\n\nGerman (Austria): de_AT\n\nGerman (Belgium): de_BE\n\nGerman (Luxembourg): de_LU\n\nGerman (Switzerland): de_CH\n\nGreek (Cyprus): el_CY\n\nGreenlandic: kl\n\nGujarati: gu\n\nHawaiian: haw\n\nHaitian Creole: ht\n\nHindi: hi\n\nHmong: hmn\n\nIcelandic: is\n\nIrish: ga\n\nItalian (Switzerland): it_CH\n\nKannada: kn\n\nKazakh: kk\n\nKhmer: km\n\nLatvian: lv\n\nLithuanian: lt\n\nLuxembourgish: lb\n\nMacedonian: mk\n\nMalay: ms\n\nMalayalam: ml\n\nMaltese: mt\n\nMarathi: mr\n\nMontenegrin: sh_ME\n\nPunjabi: pa\n\nRomanian (Moldova): ro_MD\n\nRomansh: rm\n\nRussian (Armenia): ru_AM\n\nRussian (Belarus): ru_BY\n\nRussian (Kazakhstan): ru_KZ\n\nRussian (Kyrgyzstan): ru_KG\n\nRussian (Lithuania): ru_LT\n\nRussian (Moldova): ru_MD\n\nRussian (Poland): ru_PL\n\nRussian (Ukraine): ru_UA\n\nSamoan: sm\n\nSerbian (Cyrillic): sr\n\nSerbian (Latin): sh\n\nSpanish (Argentina): es_AR\n\nSpanish (Bolivia): es_BO\n\nSpanish (Chile): es_CL\n\nSpanish (Colombia): es_CO\n\nSpanish (Costa Rica): es_CR\n\nSpanish (Dominican Republic): es_DO\n\nSpanish (Ecuador): es_EC\n\nSpanish (El Salvador): es_SV\n\nSpanish (Guatemala): es_GT\n\nSpanish (Honduras): es_HN\n\nSpanish (Nicaragua): es_NI\n\nSpanish (Panama): es_PA\n\nSpanish (Paraguay): es_PY\n\nSpanish (Peru): es_PE\n\nSpanish (Puerto Rico): es_PR\n\nSpanish (United States): es_US\n\nSpanish (Uruguay): es_UY\n\nSpanish (Venezuela): es_VE\n\nSwahili: sw\n\nTagalog: tl\n\nTamil: ta\n\nTe reo: mi\n\nTelugu: te\n\nUrdu: ur\n\nWelsh: cy\n\nXhosa: xh\n\nYiddish: ji\n\nZulu: zu\n\nWhy Salesforce?\n\nIt's actually quite simple that Salesforce has been a huge success worldwide! Despite its older and more established competitors in the market, being the third in the world among companies in innovation reinforces this position. One of the most important factors in Salesforce being the pioneer of the market is that it is a cloud computing-based platform. As stated in the SalesforceSalesforce white papers:\n\n“No matter the size of your business, you get access to the same computing power, data storage, and core features.”\n\nFor Salesforce, trust has always been a top priority. It has become aware of not only hosting the values data of its users, but also that companies use the customer success platform in line with their needs. In this situation, Salesforce assumed the responsibility of the highest level of seriousness and stated that they protect customer data in the most transparent way. The trust.salesforce.com site they have established is proof of this and is an important resource for users. Each user can visit this site and have more detailed information on how their data is protected.\n\nSalesforce has five core values:\n\nTrust: Trust is our number one value. Nothing is more important than the trust of our customers and all our stakeholders. We offer reliable infrastructure and open communication.\n\nCustomer Success: We know we succeed when our customers succeed, so from day one we've built a company around ensuring customer success.\n\nInnovation: We empower Pioneers with technology to help them succeed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and incorporate the latest innovations into our products three times a year so our customers can stay one step ahead of their industry.\n\nEquality: We believe that equality and diversity make us a better company and community. We respect and value employees of all backgrounds.\n\nSustainability: We boldly lead the way to address the climate emergency by bringing the full power of Salesforce to accelerate the world's journey to net zero.\n\nWhat are the Features that Set Salesforce apart from Other Platforms?\n\nQuick Installation and Adaptation: In traditional CRM software, it can take months or even years as the process of installation and use, but with Salesforce, this can be reduced to months or even weeks.\n\nEasy to Use: This area, where Salesforce is the most dominant compared to its competitors, provides the user with many advantages in the system. Instead of learning the program, the user can devote more time to their own development in the system, and can easily use third-party applications within the Salesforce application in an integrated manner.\n\nEffective Results: With its easy use and high customization possibilities, businesses can be adapted to their own business models as soon as possible and get effective results from this system.\n\nAccessibility: Salesforce is an easily accessible platform that is preferred by small and medium-sized businesses with its affordable price.\n\nCompliance: The change process that the user and their company are in is not an issue for Salesforce. This system, which is easy to adapt to, can be easily adapted to new scenarios and business models.\n\nReliability: Salesforce has taken the responsibility of data security with the utmost seriousness and has protected customer data in the most transparent way.\n\nCloud Based Platform: In Salesforce, there is a cloud storage system where valuable data (data) is stored.\n\nUser Interface: With the updates made by Salesforce on the interface, you can easily and quickly access the data you want, or upload it to the system and track it.\n\nMobile Application: With Salesforce's Android and IOS supported application, you can log in to your Salesforce account and track data wherever you are.\n\nSalesforce is the most popular CRM across industries and incredibly common among midsize companies, including the business services, software, and manufacturing industries. Midsize companies using Salesforce have annual revenues of between $1 and $50 million, and more than 63 percent of these companies are in the software, manufacturing industries, and business services. While that information was validated, there were findings showing that companies using Salesforce CRM place a high emphasis on marketing and sales and are more than four times likely to have marketing and sales teams. Also, these companies have strong customer service teams. As it's often said, \"there's a reason 68% of top-performing small businesses use marketing automation\".\n\nConclusion\n\nAs of 2018, Salesforce, which has more than 150,000 customers worldwide, is also known as the world's number one CRM platform in the market. With 19.7% of the market, Salesforce's closest competitors were SAP (8.3%), Oracle (5.5%), Adobe (5.1%) and Microsoft (2.7%). With a high rate of difference, Salesforce has maintained its leadership among its competitors for many years. The reason behind this success is that Salesforce AppExchange hosts more than 2700 applications and has over 3 million downloads.\n\nToday, many companies produce Salesforce applications or migrate their existing systems to the Salesforce platform. As a result, the demand for Salesforce development has increased significantly. The fact that Salesforce is the third most innovative company in the world today is an indicator of this development."
