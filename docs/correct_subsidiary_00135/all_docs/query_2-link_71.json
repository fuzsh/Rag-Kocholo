Hirth establishes that humans adapted to their environments, not as individuals but in the social groups where they lived and worked out the details of their livelihoods. He explores the variation in economic organization used by simple and com plex societies to procure, produce, and distribute resources required by both individual households and the social and political institutions that they supported. Drawing on a wealth of archaeological, historic, and ethno graphic information, he develops and applies an analytical framework for studying ancient societies that range from the hunting and gathering groups of native North America to the large state societies of both the New and Old Worlds. Hirth demonstrates that despite differences in transportation and communication technologies, the economic organizations of ancient and modern societies are not as different as we sometimes think. Kenneth Hirth is Professor of Anthropology at Pennsylvania State University. An economic anthropologist who has conducted archaeological research in Mexico, Honduras, Peru, and Turkey that has spanned 12,000 years of human development, he has authored, edited, and coauthored nineteen books on different aspects of Mesoamerican society and economy. Hirth is currently a Senior Fellow at Dumbarton Oaks Library and Research Collections in Washington, DC. He has received the National Geographic Society's Career Achievement Award in Archaeology (2000) and the Excellence in Lithic Studies Award from the Society of American Archaeology (1998).\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE KENNETH HIRTH Pennsylvania State University\n\nUniversity Printing House, Cambridge cb2 8bs, United Kingdom One Liberty Plaza, 20th Floor, New York, ny 10006, usa 477 Williamstown Road, Port Melbourne, vic 3207, Australia 314 321, 3rd Floor, Plot 3, Splendor Forum, Jasola District Centre, New Delhi 110025, India 79 Anson Road, #06-04/06, Singapore 079906 Cambridge University Press is part of the University of Cambridge.

It can chronicle the life and times of notable individuals, tell a spellbinding tale, or follow a personal quest of the author. This book ﬁts in the latter of these three categories. I was fortunate to be raised on my family’s 1850s homestead farm in southern Wisconsin. Nothing was ever thrown away in my German–American family. The farm was overﬂowing with wooden tools (mallets, ﬂails, pitchforks, pulleys), farm implements (sickles, ropes, draw knives, adzes), crocks and caskets, harnesses and the equipment to go with our two working horses, and an endless supply of 19th and early 20th century items squirreled away in corners of the barn, outbuildings, and the attic and cellar of our stone house. The abundance of old items sparked my curiosity in what they were and how they were used. Fortunately, my grandfather and grandmother still had one foot planted in the late 19th century and could explain how all the old technology was used to plant, harvest, butcher, preserve, and manage a farm household before the advent of hybrid seed, store bought food, and electrical appliances. With the vantage of hindsight I realized that they also imparted an understanding of how a self sufﬁcient family farm needed to operate in order to survive. This was my introduction to history and the beginning of an academic career as an archaeologist and anthropologist that sought to under stand how ancient societies were organized to get work done. This book was written with two audiences in mind. The ﬁrst is that group of general readers who are interested in how ancient societies developed and produced the food and other resources needed to support themselves, build civilizations, and engage in long distance trade using simple preindustrial technologies. Although not written for the classroom, these topics can be of interest to eclectic students and lifelong learners interested in the broad sweep of economic history. We have all have grown up with a basic understanding of 20th and/or 21st century capitalistic society. But does that understanding overlay neatly onto the past? This volume explores how ancient and premo dern societies were similar or different from the modern one in which we live. The second audience is comprised of my archaeological colleagues who are interested in the economy and comparative analysis but have to put the majority of their efforts into developing an up to date mastery of the culture xv\n\nxvi\n\nPREFACE\n\nareas where they conduct their research. Developing a detailed understanding of a single past society is a full time job for scholars pursuing serious research. This book uses a comparative approach to summarize alternative forms of economic organization found in both large and small scale societies. All ancient and premodern societies were economically plastic with different forms of organization coexisting and operating simultaneously in different contexts and levels of society. The comparative approach reminds us to beware of monolithic models that propose an ideal form of economic organization without taking into consideration the heterogeneity inherent in both the domestic and institutional economies. The examples provided are intended to help researchers think broadly about the economy of the societies that they study. All authors have their biases. My family heritage together with professional training in business administration, anthropology, and archaeology have shaped the presentation and rationale of this book in several ways. My upbringing along with later experience in sales and marketing had taught me the importance of organization in shaping the cost and operation of economic enterprises. Anthropology and archaeology have provided insight into the structure of small scale societies and illustrated how simpler forms of organization continued unchanged over long spans of time enabling households to adapt to changing cultural and environmental conditions. The anthropologist in me believes in the inherent value of the cross cultural approach for understanding the diversity of ways that human societies developed over time. In this sense it runs contrary to historical particularism that views all societies as intrinsically unique and unable to be compared with one another in structural terms. The format of the volume follows anthropological conventions. In text citations are used for bibliographic references, and endnotes provide supple mentary information not included in the text. One of the distracting aspects of a cross cultural and comparative approach is keeping track of the many different societies where parallel and divergent cultural practices are found. There is no easy solution to this, and I do not assume that readers have a global knowledge of all the place names, provinces, and ethnic groups that existed in the ancient and premodern past. As a partial remedy to this issue, four maps are located at the end of this Preface that provide general locations for the more than 250 archaeological sites, regions, and ethnic groups mentioned through out this volume. Finally, I feel that the examples used in the comparative discussions are one of the most valuable aspects of this volume. They naturally reﬂect my research interests, which are centered on state and chiefdom level societies more than on foraging or pastoral groups. Nevertheless, research suggests that there are similarities in organization across both small and large scale societies that ﬁt within the analytical framework for studying the economy proposed here.\n\nPREFACE\n\nAlbert Einstein believed that time was an illusion. Calculating time in a uniform way is a problem that archaeologists are intimately familiar with despite the many ways we have for counting it. Time can be calculated in tree ring growth, radiocarbon years, geological eras, and atomic clocks using uranium isotope decay, potassium–argon ratios, paleo magnetic measure ments, and thermo luminescence differences. Once calculated, time can be expressed in different calendar series including BP (before present), BC/AD (Julian calendar), BCE/CE (modiﬁed Julian calendar), and calibrated or unca librated radiocarbon years. Preference for one calendar scale over another depends on the age of the material studied and the regional or academic traditions of the investigators that use them. I have chosen to express time in Julian calendar dates (BC/AD) because they are well established in the arch aeological and historic literature in both the New and Old Worlds. Rather than tracking time with chronological charts for each area discussed, dates and time spans are identiﬁed within the discussion by the century or millennium BC or AD. When a speciﬁc archaeological period or phase is used (e.g., Ur III or third dynasty), the time span is provided in parentheses (e.g., 2112–2004 BC) to contextualize the discussion. Finally and most importantly I want to thank my family and colleagues for the advice and assistance they have provided over more than a decade of reading and research that led to this volume. First in line is my wife Susan, who fueled this research with gifts of books during holidays and other family celebrations, which dealt with merchants, trade commodities, and general economic history. Her encouragement and interest in my work have endured despite being subjected to reading drafts on all manner of tedious economic topics ranging from lithic technology, craft production, and market develop ment to the present volume. A shout also goes out to all of my archaeological colleagues in Mesoamerica with whom I have conducted research and exchanged ideas over the years, including Ann Cyphers, Jorge Angulo, Raul Arana, Frances Berdan, David Carballo, Susan Evans, Norberto Gonzalez, David Grove, George Hasemann, Gloria Lara, William Sanders, and David Webster. Economic anthropology provides the theoretical foundation of this volume, and I thank Timothy Earle, Thomas Hakannson, Paul Durrenberger, Donald Kurtz, and Della McMillan for our many stimulating discussions about the economic organization of ethnographic societies. Finally, I want to thank Mark Munn and Gonzalo Rubio for their comments on Classical Mediterranean society, and my son Colin Hirth for many insightful and invigorating discussions on medieval Icelandic and European society and economy. I thank them for their contributions and recognize any errors in describing the ancient economy are my own creation.\n\nxvii\n\n1 Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East\n\n1 (cont.)\n\n2 India, Asia, and the Paciﬁc\n\n2 (cont.)\n\n3 The Americas\n\n4 Africa\n\nONE\n\nTHE STRUCTURE OF ANCIENT ECONOMY\n\nAncient economic history is still in its infancy, both because few economists have learned much about the ancient world and because ancient historians have typically not incorporated economics into their analysis. (Temin 2006:133)\n\nThe economy is the foundation of society today, just as it was in the ancient past. It is the source of material support for all of society’s households as well as its social, political, and religious institutions. While our modern economy is often described as a result of the industrial revolution, this is not really the case. Today’s economy is actually the collective byproduct of more than 10,000 years of economic development. It is a composite of formal and informal forms of production and distribution that have evolved over time. Ancient, premodern, and modern economies all developed in the same way, by adding new types of production and distribution to existing forms of work to meet speciﬁc needs. This book is about the organization of ancient and premodern economies. It starts from the premise that just like today, the scale, complexity, and organiza tion of the economy was a primary factor in determining the direction and development of ancient societies. The preceding epigraph suggests that the study of ancient economy is still in its infancy. If this is true, then the pages that follow will only attempt a few cautious steps to advance what can be said about how economies operated in the past. The lack of progress in the ﬁeld is primarily one of omission rather than commission. Researchers have often 1\n\n2\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\nexamined how aspects of the economy reinforce social and political relations rather than focusing speciﬁcally on the economy as its own speciﬁc domain of investigation.1 While Temin chooses to criticize the lack of discourse between economists and economic historians as the reason for this, the blame is not theirs alone. Anthropologists and archaeologists likewise have not focused enough on the premodern economy despite having the tools to do so. At least three obstacles have stood in the way of the concerted study of past economic systems. The ﬁrst obstacle is empirical and methodological, and reﬂects the difﬁculty of reconstructing ancient economic activity from a single disciplinary perspec tive. Historians make excellent use of textual records for the periods for which there are documents. Unfortunately, that eliminates all preliterate societies from the discussion, and the records available from historic periods rarely include detailed information about the life of commoners within society. Archaeologists can reach back into the prehistoric past and examine economic behavior using material remains from production, distribution, and consump tion activities. The limitation for archaeologists is that they rarely have large enough samples of material remains to reconstruct economic systems, or the inclination to view them in a holistic and systematic way. To write an economic history of even one society is an enormous and complex task. It requires the use of multiple data sets that include textual sources, art historical depictions, archaeological remains, and comparison with ethnographic cases to develop a synergistic understanding of past economic patterns. The second problem is one of competing research paradigms. The strong evolutionary focus in anthropology of the 1960s and 1970s affected the way that social researchers viewed the economy. The holistic approach of anthro pology together with the inﬂuential work of Karl Polanyi argued that the economy could not be examined as a separate sphere of activity because it was deeply embedded in other aspects of society. The result was that the economy came to be viewed largely as subordinate to larger social and political processes. At the same time, the strong evolutionary current within archaeology focused on identifying cause and effect relationships to explain major cultural changes such as population growth, warfare, agricultural intensiﬁcation, and state development. Obscured in the process was a concern for basic economic structures that were the mainstay of traditional Marxist analysis. While social anthropology constructed detailed analytical frameworks2 for studying kinship, jural relations, political organization, marriage, religion, forms of exchange, and production technologies, archaeologists struggled to develop the means to apply them to the past. The result was a lack of attention to identifying organization and change in the economic structures that deﬁne the economy. The third and ﬁnal obstacle to studying the ancient economy is the most challenging. The view adopted here is that the study of the ancient economy is\n\nTHE STRUCTURE OF ANCIENT ECONOMY\n\nmost productive if it is undertaken from a comparative perspective.3 Solutions to similar economic problems at different points in time can take similar forms. Nevertheless, the amount of time needed to develop an in depth understand ing of an ancient society can lead investigators to see them as unique and overlook the structural dimensions of the economy that they share with other societies unless they have a direct historical connection. Comparative eco nomic research needs to look beyond the particularism that deﬁnes regions, cultures, and individual societies. This is a daunting proposition given the enormous variation that existed in the past and the limited or incomplete information available to researchers to explore it. Nowhere is this more evident than in the economy, which can be organized in similar and different ways in societies at different levels of organizational complexity. This study examines the ancient economy from a comparative perspective. It does not attempt to develop a single synthetic view of what ancient and premodern economies were, how they were organized, or how they developed. That would be impractical given the enormous variation in the scale, structure, and integration of past economies. In fact, it does the opposite. It attempts to identify a broad range of different organizational structures found in, and shared by, societies at different levels of complexity at different points in time. The emphasis is on modes of organization and how they operated. Humans are problem solvers and it should be no surprise to ﬁnd similar forms of economic organization in different societies to meet similar needs and get work done. Identifying this variation provides the foundation for a compara tive analysis of past economic structures, and supplies the basis for exploring the evolutionary forces behind their development. WH AT IS TH E ECO NOMY?\n\nDeﬁnitions have value because they both clarify a domain of meaning and identify the speciﬁc variables or attributes that concepts encompass.4 Nowhere is this more true than when investigators attempt to deﬁne the economy. Karl Polanyi (1957) argued that there were two ways to deﬁne the economy: a formal or neoclassical way and a substantive way. The neoclassical approach views the economy as a domain of human behavior concerned with material provisioning that can be studied separately from the rest of society. Material provisioning is based on rational choice theory where individuals make con scious choices about how to meet their needs or desires (Samuelson 1967:5). Lionel Robbins deﬁnes economics from this perspective as “the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses” (Robbins 1935:16). The substantive view of the economy is different. It holds that processes of material provisioning cannot be understood apart from the broader social\n\n3\n\n4\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\nstructures in which they are found (Dalton 1961; Polanyi 1944). For those favoring the substantive view, the economy is embedded in the social systems where provisioning takes place. As a result, behaviors such as maximization, utility, and rational choice cannot be understood in the universal terms used by neoclassical economics because they are culture speciﬁc. The literature on these differences is vast and deﬁnes what have been called the Formalist– Substantive and the Modernist–Primitivist debates in anthropology and archaeology (Dalton 1961; Kaplan 1968; Plattner 1989b: Polanyi 1957; Polanyi et al. 1957; Schneider 1974). The important question is, What view of the economy provides the best approach to studying and understanding the ancient economy? The economy is deﬁned here as a socially mediated form of material provisioning and interaction involving the production and allocation of resources among alternative ends. Several things are implied by deﬁning the economy in this way. First, it focuses on the behaviors and interactions associated with the material provi sioning of everyday life. Interaction at this level involves the interplay of individuals with the resources in their natural environment and the groups who use or control them. Second, the economy is a socially mediated realm of behavior. This recognizes that the values and behaviors that shape provisioning decisions are learned and acquired in the societies in which individuals live. It also recognizes that material provisioning was often embedded in other social, religious, and political activities. Third, the production and allocation of resources refers to the decision making processes that individuals and groups go through with regard to the production, distribution, and consumption of resources. It is here that altruistic or self motivated choice confronts the cultural norms that shape them. Judging the rationality or irrationality of those choices depends on the cultural and ethnocentric vantage point from which individuals observe them. The perspective adopted here contains elements of both formalist and substantive views of the economy. The formal view of the economy derives from Adam Smith (1827), who argued that economic provisioning was the result of rational decision making by individuals who allocate their time and resources to different ends. It is based on the empirical fact that humans are problem solvers who make choices that determine their physical and social well being. They have to eat to survive, select mates to reproduce, and raise offspring that represent the next generation. To this end people are decision makers who mediate these and other issues through their own calculations and/or the advice and counsel of others. People are rational within the cultural universes where they operate, but they are not the emotionless, fully informed, rational Homo economicus at the core of neoclassical economics. Instead, they are bounded by their beliefs, rationality, and cultural experiences, which bias their selection choices in different ways (Sandstrom 2008; Thaler 2015).\n\nTHE STRUCTURE OF ANCIENT ECONOMY\n\nThe substantive perspective is valuable because it emphasizes the variation in how each society deﬁnes the scope of its economic interaction. Societies set the parameters of the economic base. They establish the speciﬁcs of economic interaction (value, exchange equivalencies, the expectations of reciprocity), deﬁne the norms of material and social well being, and set standards of expected economic involvement in preserving social and community values (Dalton 1961; Gudeman 2001). Nevertheless, while society deﬁnes the ideol ogy of economic interaction, people operate creatively within it. They make individual decisions set within the culturally mediated range of acceptable and nonacceptable options open to them. This dimension of individual economic action blends the formal and sub stantive views of the economy together. Every ancient household was respon sible for its own livelihood. Households understood the economic risk of resource shortfall and worked both individually and collectively to ensure that they had sufﬁcient resources to survive. The result was that households formed collective action groups that worked at improving their economic well being through their individual effort and participation in broader, community based social interaction. The strategies that households adopted were a multifaceted mix of intensiﬁed and diversiﬁed production activities that, together with mutual aid networks at the community level, helped meet their everyday material and social needs (Netting 1981, 1993; Sahlins 1972). The formalist and substantive perspectives are alternative but compatible theoretical positions about how the economy was structured. The debate between these two views is no longer foremost in the minds of anthropologists and economic historians. Nevertheless, the legacy of the substantivist perspec tive continues to frame how researchers view the organization of, and sources of change in ancient economies. Polanyi argued that the economy did not grow organically through individual decision making or maximization strat egies, but was created and operated through society’s social, political, and religious institutions. The reason was that he saw barter and other forms of commercial negotiation as dangerous and disruptive forces if they were left unchecked to operate freely within society. Researchers who argue for strongly centralized economies and elite centered explanations for culture change carry with them Polanyi’s top down view of cultural organization and change (Carrasco 1978; Finley 1985; Murra 1980). On the other hand, researchers who focus on individual decision making see economic development from a different perspective. They often favor a bottom up view of economic development with considerable latitude for technological innovation and organizational change emanating from house holds on all levels of society (e.g., Reina 1963). A number of scholars have argued that Polanyi’s denial of individual decision making has impeded our understanding of everything from household level economic structure to the\n\n5\n\n6\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\ndevelopment of markets, merchants, and commerce in ancient societies (Blanton and Fargher 2010; Feinman 2013a; Hirth 2016; Silver 1995). Individual incentive and the rational economic choices that people make are compatible with a recognition of the embedded nature of the economy. After all, it was Adam Smith who said that “economic actors tend to make strenuous efforts to re entangle economic relations in a nexus of social relations for the stability and predictability of the markets” (cited in Oka and Kusimba 2008:365). COMPAR ING ANCIENT, MODERN, AND PREMODERN ECONOMIES\n\nThe 21st century has a rapidly changing and growing world economy. Technological advances in computers and telecommunications have led to signiﬁcant restructuring in manufacturing, distribution, and consumerism at the global level. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Common Market, and Wall Street are some of the large scale trade and ﬁnancial institutions that help make the global economy work. The result is that the modern economy is often perceived as being very different from economies of the ancient past. But is it? From the perspective of economic anthropology, the similarities between modern and premodern economies are closer than one might think. Take our ﬁnancial institutions, for example. A drive down any major street in America will reveal more banks than grocery stores. The scale of our ﬁnancial institutions would lead us to think that the implementation of economic change in the modern world occurs at a scale much larger than it did several hundred years ago when Thomas Jefferson argued strenuously against the need for a strong central bank. But if we adopted the top down view of economic development, it would contradict recent Chinese experi ence. The current business revolution in China occurred largely through informal lending relationships and mobilizing capital along kinship lines that have dominated ancient and premodern societies for thousands of years. While formal banks and banking institutions exist, they have not provided the capital to fund the many recent small business ventures in both China (Ayyagaria et al. 2011; Dong et al. 2012; Turvey and Kong 2010) and India (Kumar 2009; Ravi 2003). Another example is the replacement of general purpose money with formal currencies, which are argued to represent an important evolutionary advance in the development of commercial economies (Dalton 1965; Polanyi 1957; Schneider 1974; Weatherford 1997). Be that as it may, special purpose monies are still with us and even growing in importance. Community currencies such as Ithaca HOURS and other local exchange trading systems (LETS)5 have developed in a number of places as ways to procure and trade services against\n\nTHE STRUCTURE OF ANCIENT ECONOMY\n\none another instead of buying them with dollars (Jacob et al. 2004). Bitcoin and the Facebook Libra are more recent examples of nonregulated virtual currencies, which operate in the restricted world of cyber exchange (Segendorf 2014). Add to this the way that Internet business has facilitated the emergence of independent contracting in the form of Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb as replace ments to formal taxicab companies and hotels makes for an increasingly decentralized and informal business environment.6 Many of the same structures found in ancient and premodern societies continue to operate today. Livelihoods continue to be organized around work in domestic settings. Social and religious institutions continue to be funded and operate through voluntary contributions and tithes as they have for centuries. Political institutions still rely on taxation, tolls, ﬁnes, and tariffs to fund their administrations. Societies in the ancient world built and supported urban centers and engaged in long distance trade. Commerce and the production of goods for sale was carried out at all levels of cultural complexity, from tribal societies to states. Marketplaces developed and operated alongside private enterprise in virtually all large state societies, although not in the same way that capitalistic markets operate today. Ancient and modern societies are similar to one another in two ways that make comparisons between them possible. First, they are both economically plastic. Economic plasticity refers to the principle that as economic systems grow in size, new forms of economic organization appear alongside preexisting ones without replacing them (Hirth and Pillsbury 2013). New forms of economic organization usually appear as solutions to special problems or circumstances. They normally are not initiated as rapid, broad scale changes in the organiza tion of work. They occur, instead, as small, new ways of doing things in the existing economy. New introductions can become important over time as they demonstrate their efﬁciency and supplant existing forms of production, resource mobilization, or product distribution. Economic innovation is largely an egalitarian process. New technology and forms of work will be added to the economy in proportion to their ability to increase productivity, reduce effort, and agree with existing ideological norms.7 But that does not mean that older forms of economic organization will disappear. Second, both ancient and modern societies are heterogenous. Economic heterogeneity is a function of the natural conservativeness of economic systems. It refers to the diversity of organizational structures created over time as new forms of economic organization are added to economic systems (i.e., plasticity) without discarding existing forms. Preexisting economic arrangements may continue to be practiced even in the face of new, more productive or efﬁcient ones depending on a variety of circumstances. The perpetuation of older technologies and economic practices can be the result of their being appropri ate solutions for small scale economic activities. Domestic economies are\n\n7\n\n8\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\n1.1 20th century dhoukani threshing sled with close up of its stone chert blades. (Photographs by Nicholas Kardulias. Photography on top modiﬁed by author with permission of Nicholas Kardulias)\n\ngenerally conservative because of limited labor and/or capital resources. Older practices and technologies will continue in use as long as they get the job done (Langlands 2017). This explains why rural farmers in Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey still used animal and human drawn sledges (dhoukani) edged with sharp chert ﬂakes and blades (Figure 1.1) to thresh grain well into the middle of the 20th century (Anderson et al. 2004:ﬁgure 5; Kardulias and Yerkes 1996; Pearlman 1984). The result is a heterogenous economy where old technologies and traditional practices such as mobilizing resources through gifts or along kinship lines continue to be important even in today’s modern capitalistic world. RECONSTRUCTING ANCIENT AND PREMODERN ECONOMIES\n\nHow can a comparative understanding of past economies be developed given the diversity, plasticity, and heterogeneity of their economic practices? The place to begin is to recognize that no single discipline can do it alone. Temin is correct in the epigraph that few economists have displayed an interest in past economic systems, but this should not be a surprise. The ﬁeld of contemporary economics is concerned with explaining the operation of capitalistic markets, not ancient or premarket economies.8 Economists rarely examine historic\n\nTHE STRUCTURE OF ANCIENT ECONOMY\n\ntrends in the economy unless they have the measurable data to do so. The recent study by Thomas Piketty (2014; Piketty and Zucman 2013) on the distribution of income and wealth is important in this regard as it examines trends over a 300 year time period, brief from our perspective, but valuable in what it demonstrates in terms of the nature of capital accumulation and long term historic analysis. Economic historians have been called on to provide the ﬁeld with longer term analyses (North 1978; North and Thomas 1973). The requirements of good scholarship for the economic historian follows that of all historians: reliance on good textual records. When records exist, economic history can provide detailed insights into past economic behavior. But historians face two signiﬁcant shortcomings. The most obvious is that many societies either lacked writing or existed before writing was introduced.9 Second, when textual documents are preserved, they usually record a speciﬁc or narrow dimension of economic life such as palace economy (Heltzer 1982; Lipinski 1979; McGeough 2007), merchant activity (e.g., Casson 1989; Gotein 1967, 1973), estate operation (Rathbone 1991), or political activity such as conquest levies or taxation (Berdan and Anawalt 1992; Lee fang Chien 2004). The result is often an in depth discussion of one particular facet of society, rather than a holistic and integrated view of the entire economy. Aspects of the domestic economy, for example, can be particularly difﬁcult to reconstruct. Archaeology provides another entrée into the study of the ancient past. Archaeologists reconstruct history from durable material remains (e.g., Harris 1993). The advantage of archaeological research is twofold. It can examine all levels of the society from commoners to kings, and it is not time bound or restricted to periods of written history. Careful analyses of material remains make it possible to reconstruct an array of economic topics ranging from agriculture (Barker and Gilbertson 2003; Harrison and Turner 1978) and craft production (Costin 1991; Hirth 2006b) to trade (Lobell 2009), type of storage (Christakis 1999; LeVine 1992; Rickman 1971), and the presence of complex economic institutions such as a marketplace (Camp 1986; Hirth 1998; Stark and Ossa 2010). The strength of archaeology is that the materials recovered from domestic contexts reﬂect consumption at the family and household level, information frequently missing from other sources. The disadvantage of archaeology is the issue of equiﬁnality, namely that distributions of material remains could have been produced by several alternative social processes. Nevertheless, careful modeling and problem oriented research make it pos sible for archaeologists to reconstruct different forms of both production and distribution (Costin 2001a; Earle and Smith 2011; Hirth 1998, 2008, 2010; Hirth and Cyphers 2020). Finally, there is the voluminous work of countless economic anthropologists and ethnographers who have compiled detailed accounts of indigenous\n\n9\n\n10\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\npremodern and semi modern economies in different cultures around the world. These studies provide actual descriptions of economic behavior that can be used as testable models for past economic systems. They encompass a wide range of economic diversity from foraging and tribal groups (Evans Pritchard 1940; Strathern 2007; Wiessner 1982) to chiefdom societies (Codere 1966; Malinowski 1922) and states (Halperin 2013; Netting 1981). They touch on a wide array of topics from the domestic economy (Wilk 1989b) and agriculture (Chibnik 1994; Netting 1989, 1993; Stone 1986) to merchants (Harding 1967), markets (Beals 1975), and market systems (Smith 1976a, 1976b). Many of these scholars follow the ethnographic tradition of providing a holistic description of society. In addition to materialist discussions many ethnographers probe the ritual (Monaghan 1995) and emic meaning of eco nomic activity (Drucker and Heizer 1967; Gudeman 2001). The utility of ethnographic studies is that they provide models for how different economic activities (e.g., foraging, pastoralism, agriculture) were perceived and structured in societies of different size and complexity that lived in different types of environments. While they are not perfect analogues for ancient societies that have long since disappeared, they provide useful points of comparison with which to examine them. A COMPARATIVE FRAMEW ORK: DOMESTIC AND INSTITUTIONAL OR GANI ZATION\n\nA goal of this study is to develop a comparative perspective of the economic structures found in ancient and premodern (traditional) economies. It seeks to develop an organizational framework that is applicable for cross cultural analy sis in which different economic practices and activities can be analyzed and compared. The discussion draws heavily on economic anthropology to frame this understanding. Anthropology contains detailed ethnographic descriptions of different forms of production, communal labor, feasting, elite sponsorship, self sufﬁcient householding, usufruct property, traditional systems of land tenure, and an array of gift exchanges like those mentioned in many ancient and historic accounts. No assumption is made that any of these forms of organization are perfect analogies for past societies. But it does assume that there are commonalities and continuities in human behavior and ways of doing things that can be identiﬁed and proﬁtably compared across a broad range of time. While cross cultural comparisons are an anathema for many historians, they provide a landscape of possibilities against which the key organizational features of the domestic and institutional economy can be examined. Moreover, it is the economic plasticity and heterogeneity of human soci eties that makes cross cultural comparisons of economic systems possible.\n\nTHE STRUCTURE OF ANCIENT ECONOMY\n\nThe principle of economic plasticity recognizes that older (simpler) and newer (more complex) forms of economic organization are compatible with one another to the extent that they can carry out the same type of work at different levels of production efﬁciency. Older forms of economic organiza tion can be retained or shifted to those sectors of the economy where the opportunity costs of change are high. The result is that even industrial societies can retain preindustrial forms of work. Identifying this principle provides a framework for studying how, where, and under what conditions older, less efﬁcient forms of economic organization can survive and even thrive. All economic activities within ancient and premodern societies can be grouped for purposes of comparative analysis into one of three broad organiza tional sectors: (1) the domestic economy of individual families and households, (2) the informal institutions that households use to support each other, and (3) the formal institutions that embrace society as a whole. How these three dimensions of society differed from one another in terms of form, scale, complexity, and integration is essential for understanding economic plasticity and heterogeneity. This study presents examples that illustrate the diversity of economic structures found in premodern societies while at the same time evaluating their ﬁt into the threefold analytical framework. Rather than a speciﬁc region or set of regions, examples are selected from a diverse array of different societies. This was intentional since the goal of this volume is to explore the applicability of the analytical framework used to examine eco nomic organization. The only stipulation was that the economies of the different case studies used were well documented through historic and/or archaeological research. Two caveats are important to this discussion. The ﬁrst is that the focus of the discussion is on forms of organization and their utility for describing past societies. The economic models proposed are empirical constructs that can be reworked when new data become available. They are ﬁrst iteration models of economic organization, and, while not complete, they serve as useful points of departure for exploring the economic structures on which ancient societies depended. To the extent possible, these models assist in our understanding how economic systems developed over time. But they are organizational rather than developmental models. Nevertheless, they provide insight into how economies may have changed by adding new forms of organization to existing ones without replacement. Recognizing different forms of organiza tion provides the building blocks for identifying how complex economic organizations were shaped. The goal is to advance the discussion of compara tive economic analysis, achieve a more meaningful understanding of past economic structures, and broaden our understanding of the forces of change shaping past economic systems.\n\n11\n\n12\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\nThe second caveat is that the comparative perspective adopted here uses a synthetic rather than a single theoretical perspective to evaluate the empirical information drawn from different disciplines. Theory is indispensable in scientiﬁc inquiry because it helps make sense of disparate fact (Flannery and Marcus 2012:xiii). But the important question is, What brand of theory should investigators adopt? Behavioral economic research has demonstrated that individuals in nonmarket societies make rational economic choices within the scope of their own experience (Sandstrom 2008; Thaler 2015). Adam Smith would have approved of that. However, it is also clear that the economic choices that people make are socially conditioned. The substanti vists argued that more than ﬁfty years ago. Furthermore, agency theory (Eisenhardt 1989) is pertinent to any discussion where wealthy elites insti tuted new administration practices, where religious specialists modiﬁed belief or ritual practices, or where enterprising merchants engaged in new commercial ventures or organized long distance trade missions. And what about Marxist perspectives? Anytime the forms of production are discussed, the Marxist framework is useful for conceptualizing the structure of eco nomic activities. In more general terms, a “modes of organization” approach can be used to model a wide range of economic activities, from forms of distribution and sharing to resource control within the institutional econ omy. Additionally, world systems theory is useful for examining long distance interactions. Is the use of a collective theoretical approach just weak theory? Perhaps for some. I, however, view theoretical eclecticism as a strength and adopt it here since it enables researchers to incorporate the strongest aspects of different theoretical approaches into their interpretations of disparate facts. It facilitates a more middle range economic analysis that connects different types of eco nomic interactions and organizations to the theoretical perspectives that best explain them. While the dogmatic adherence to single theoretical approaches demonstrates strong philosophical convictions on the part of the researcher, the one hammer approach does not fulﬁll all the needs of a carpenter. Neither does it describe all aspects of how an economy works unless one is satisﬁed with focusing on a narrow range of data or adopts a single analytical perspec tive. While that may be done for the sake of parsimony, it is not a good application of the comparative method. THE FRAMEWOR K O F DISCUSSIO N\n\nArchaeologists often discuss the economy in terms of production, distribution, and consumption activities. This functional approach is useful because it ﬁts the type of data available for discussion and allows investigators to focus on particular domains of economic activity in considerable detail. The analytical\n\nTHE STRUCTURE OF ANCIENT ECONOMY\n\n13\n\nframework used here is different. Instead of activities, it focuses on the three levels of economic organization mentioned above: the domestic economy and the informal and formal institutions that regulate broader social and economic interactions. The relationship between domestic and institutional realms of eco nomic activity is represented in Figure 1.2. It illustrates that while formal institutions are designed to embrace all households in society, informal institu tions operate on an interhousehold basis and form networks that vary in size and permanence based on the initiatives of 1.2 The organizational relationship between the domestic economy and formal and informal institutions. the households involved. (modiﬁed from Hirth 2016: Figure 2.1) The domestic economy is the foundation of all human societies both past and pre sent. It is organized to support individual families and includes all of the ways that households access or produce the resources needed to meet their biological and social needs. While not particularly glamorous in terms of the types of activities that households engaged in, the domestic economy was the most durable and largest economic component of ancient societies. It was organized to obtain the food, clothing, housing, knowledge, and technology necessary for life and repro duction (Johnson and Earle 1987:11). Today as in the past, the domestic economy supports the greatest number of people, accounts for the greatest volume of goods produced and consumed, and is the foundation on which all other economic activity is based. As a framework of analysis, it applies equally well to commoner and high status households in both sedentary and mobile societies. The important and dynamic nature of the domestic economy is discussed in Chapter 2. It explores some of the organizational principles of the domestic economy and the variety of ways that households dealt with subsistence risk. Households were small but ﬂexible adaptive units that were linked by networks of interhousehold interaction. Their overarching goal was feeding, raising, and socializing the next generation, and they operated as entrepreneurs taking advantage of subsistence opportunities when they presented themselves. This included becoming involved in local and extra regional trade networks to exchange the goods they produced for those that they could not. The chapter examines two household examples to illustrate these points: the way 16th century households in Central Mexico diversi ﬁed their economic activities to meet subsistence needs, and how the domestic production of hand crafted cotton textiles fueled the trans Asian\n\n14\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\nglobal economy and textile trade during the 13th through 18th centuries (Abu Lughod 1989). While the domestic economy is easily equated with the operation of the household, Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the issue of deﬁning what constitutes the institutional economy. Institutions represent the regularized and agreed on structures of socioeconomic interaction within society.10 They carry with them norms and values11 of how interaction should be deﬁned and conducted within society. Institutions from the perspective used here consist of both the rules that govern socioeconomic interaction and the forms of organization created to carry them out.12 Institutions in this sense range along a continuum from informal and spontaneous to formal and inviolate. Chapter 3 explores the nature of informal institutions within society. Informal economic institutions include all of the structures, principles, and customs that households employed on a voluntary and ad hoc basis to mobilize labor, access resources, minimize risk, and provide other forms of interhousehold support needed for their maintenance and social reproduction. Examples of these practices are drawn from past and premodern societies in Africa, North America, ancient Israel, and medieval Iceland. Formal institutions are the focus of Chapter 4. Formal institutions are special purpose organizational structures that operate at the level of the whole society. They developed alongside informal institutions and increased in scale, com plexity, and permanency as societies grew in size. From a historic and archaeo logical perspective, they represent many of the stand alone organizations identiﬁed as temples, libraries, marketplaces, and the varied installations associ ated with political governance, including palaces, courts, and assembly halls. Four important forces for social integration are examined along with the role that leaders and their households have in shaping institutional development: the need for mutual protection, the formation of land holding and resource pooling associations, the intensiﬁcation of resource production, and the need to mediate relationships with neighboring groups. It also explores how the household served as a template for some of the earliest forms of institutional organization. Formal institutions in early state level societies required resources to sponsor celebrations, construct special purpose facilities, and support administrative personnel that oversaw their activities. These resources were obtained in a combination of ways that included producing them directly within institu tional contexts or mobilizing resources from the population that the insti tutions served. Chapter 5 explores the ﬁrst of these options and how resources needed for institutional support were produced by the institutions that used them. Examples of direct production systems are discussed for Sumeria, China, the Aztec, and Inka, along with decentralized production and peripatetic consumption across the Middle East and medieval Europe.\n\nTHE STRUCTURE OF ANCIENT ECONOMY\n\nBenjamin Franklin is credited with the saying that “in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” Taxation is another way to obtain resources for institutional support by mobilizing resources from the households of its constituents. Chapter 6 explores this second dimension of institutional ﬁnancing. Resource mobilization and taxation are complex topics, and the discussion begins by examining the difference between com pulsory institutional donations and the voluntary euergetism characteristic of the Greco Roman world. Two forms of taxation are discussed: tolls and duties levied on imported goods and taxing agricultural production; the difference between land tax, rents, and leases in agrarian states is also clariﬁed. Finally, the role of conquest taxation is examined along with systems of tax collection including tax farming. Merchants were economic agents that shaped the ancient economy in important ways. They traveled long distances, sought out products for sale, and faced the dangers of the road. Whether they worked as independent operators, agents for institutions, or members of family ﬁrms and diaspora communities, they made commercial decisions to buy and sell goods on the basis of incomplete information. Chapter 7 examines who merchants were and how they operated to move goods over space under conditions of high transportation costs. Merchants self organized to conduct business and over came what has been called the merchant’s dilemma. The forms of organization discussed include commenda partnerships, family ﬁrms, merchant guilds, temple collaborations, and the phenomenon of merchant diaspora. The examples discussed include the Banjaras pastoral merchants of India, the Old Assyrian merchants of the Middle Bronze age, and the Aztec pochteca of pre Hispanic Mexico. Craft production was an important component in the economies of both state and pre state societies. Chapter 8 explores the nature of noninstitutional craft production carried out in domestic and commercial settings. It examines the origins of craft production, the associated risks involved, and the strategies that artisans employed to mediate the obstacles to full time specialization referred to as the craftsperson’s dilemma. The discussion examines differences in production scale found within ancient societies together with how guilds and the putting out system shaped manufacturing strategies and harnessed labor for commercial production in late medieval and early modern Europe. The marketplace was a prominent economic institution in societies with high population densities for mobilizing and assembling resources in a central locale for consumer access. Chapter 9 examines the role of the marketplace, market exchange, and the variety of conditions under which markets could develop in ancient societies. The variation in the scale and structure of market places is examined using the examples of native North American rendezvous; the retail markets of Greece, Rome, and Aztec Mexico; and wholesale\n\n15\n\n16\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\nentrepots in Greece and medieval France. The chapter concludes with an evaluation of the marketplace as a formal institution where both commercial and noncommercial interests intersected. The volume concludes with observations about the ancient economy and how the comparative approach contributes to its study. The value of the domestic and institutional framework is its ability to separate, compare, and contrast economic activities in different settings. General observations are presented on the evolution of institutional economy along with the need for more research on identifying and understanding the forms of economic organization as a basis for understanding how economic systems changed over time. A ﬁnal word is warranted regarding terminology. Both in this chapter and throughout the volume, I use the phrase “ancient and premodern societies” to bracket the breadth of societies that I describe and compare in economic terms. Although the societies discussed were separated by thousands of years of development and differed greatly in scale, they all were organized to operate in a preindustrial economic landscape. Most of the food consumed was produced locally, transportation and communication were slow and costly, and formal ﬁnancial institutions as we know them today did not exist or play a major role in economic development. They were traditional societies in the sense that labor and organization rather than technology and capital investment were determining factors affecting the scale of production. Similarly, they are preindustrial in the sense that they did not make extensive use of energy from fossil fuels. While entrepreneurial behavior and proﬁt motivations could be found in these societies, production regimes did not respond, or responded slowly, to anything resembling the type of market competition and contem porary price setting mechanisms found in modern industrial societies. Within this shared economic landscape, similarities in forms of economic organization can be found in both ancient and premodern societies.\n\nTWO\n\nTHE DOMESTIC ECONOMY\n\nThe subsistence economy is the family economy. It is organized at the household level to meet basic needs including food, clothing, housing, and procurement technology. The simplest form of the subsistence economy is the “domestic mode of production.” Each household is ideally self sufﬁcient, producing all that it needs. ( Johnson and Earle 1987:11–12)\n\nThe domestic economy refers to the full array of provisioning activities carried out by the co resident household or family unit for its social and biological maintenance. Without question, households are the most important economic and social units in human society. Households are where a society’s members are born, nurtured, and often educated. They are interactive social units whose primary concern is the day to day well being of their members. Households reproduce themselves both biologically and socially. In addition to basic staples, households provide their members with the social, psychological, and economic resources needed to live their lives. They vary tremendously in size, composition, and rank, but despite this variation, households have always been the primary social settings in which families reinforced their shared cultural values through a combination of work, play, and domestic ritual. The domestic economy represents the largest sector of every ancient and premodern society. Households, however they were composed, produced and consumed the majority of all the food and ﬁber resources in society. Survival and reproduction were their business, and the productivity of their economic 17\n\n18\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\npursuits determined the success, survival, and well being of their members. Households provided the vehicle through which resources were pooled, stored, and distributed both to their members and to other sectors of the economy. They contained most of the labor available for work, military service, and religious activity. The domestic economy was always the back bone of ancient society, and the development of political complexity is largely a history of how labor and resources in the domestic sector were mobilized by emerging elites and the institutions that they supported (Johnson and Earle 1987). Given these factors, it is amazing that the importance and organization of the domestic economy is often overlooked in discussions of past economies. This chapter explores three topics. It begins by examining what the household represents and why it can be difﬁcult to deﬁne in absolute terms. This is followed by a general discussion of the domestic economy and why it is the basic organizational unit of society. As the quotation at the beginning of this chapter states, households have to meet the family’s subsistence requirements, and the constraints and strategies to do this are discussed. Households often diversify their production strategies to reduce risk and to expand net return. An example from 16th century Central Mexico is presented to illustrate how individual households utilized different economic activities to broaden and diversify their subsistence base. A second example of household textile production is presented for the Indian subcontinent to illustrate how household production could be expanded to the point that it underwrote the development of the trans Asian global economy. Finally, the role of the household as an organizational template is discussed, and the house model of society is presented as an example of how the household served as a conceptual framework for early institutional development. THE CONCEPT OF HOU SEHOLD\n\nWhile the household’s importance is easy to understand, it has not always been considered an important analytical unit within anthropology. This is because the compositional elements of the household are difﬁcult to deﬁne and distinguish from those of the family (Yanagisako 1979). Bender (1967) observed that the family and the household have been treated as separate analytical units. The family was deﬁned in terms of kinship relationships regardless of where individ uals resided or whether they cooperated in mutually beneﬁcial economic activities. In contrast, the household was viewed as a task oriented residential unit that could contain both kinsmen and nonkinsmen who were expected to cooperate in a range of social, economic, and ideological activities. The view adopted here is that most ancient households were co resident groups that shared householding tasks and decision making (Blanton 1994:5; Netting et al. 1984:xxvi). Households are useful units of analysis that are readily identiﬁable in archaeological contexts from the dwellings that members\n\nTHE DOMESTIC ECONOMY\n\noccupied, and the activities carried out at them. They are dynamic action groups, and no attempt is made here to deﬁne family separately from the household. Individuals who resided together tended to coordinate their activ ities with one another whether they were directly related by kinship or not (Douglass 2002). The household as an analytical unit can be found in all human societies irrespective of size or cultural complexity. In mobile societies they represent the nuclear food sharing unit in both foraging and pastoral groups. In seden tary societies household composition ranges from simple, two generational nuclear residential groupings to larger complex households composed of multiple generations that can incorporate a range of married offspring, wards, and other attached individuals. Archaeology is the primary way that households in the distant past are studied. Historic documentation of households is rare and, where it occurs, often is conﬁned to wealthy, high ranking, and literate families. Domestic structures, architectural constructions, and associated artifacts can be used to reconstruct household size and activities. The degree of transhumance in society directly affects the type of these remains, with sedentary groups producing more robust archaeological records than mobile ones. The reality of the situation is that the domestic remains that archaeologists encounter often reﬂect time series accumulations of household debris. When households reside in the same place for long periods, the physical remains recovered may span several generations (Binford 1981, 1982; Kent 1987). The result is that the physical remains associated with a single dwelling can represent the accumula tion of multiple rather than single households (Hirth 1993; M. Smith 1992:12). Comparative analysis has identiﬁed tremendous variation in how house holds were organized and perceived by the individuals who occupied them. Social scientists have deﬁned household composition using different criteria including co residency, food sharing, resource pooling, post marital residence, kinship, and the product of work groups (Wilk and Netting 1984). But problems always arise in identifying household boundaries. How, for example, is the household deﬁned in diaspora settings where a family member has emigrated to a new setting but regularly sends resources back to his natal household, as Bronze Age merchants in Kanesh did to their families living in Ashur? (See Chapter 7.) The variation in household composition can frustrate social scientists who want to develop precise deﬁnitions of what they represent, but it underscores their fundamental strength as highly dynamic adaptive units. Small size allows households to respond quickly to problems or new economic opportunities. Ethnographic research has documented that households are ﬂexible and innovative social units that can intensify production on their own initiative when economic conditions require them to do so (Netting 1990, 1993; Stone\n\n19\n\n20\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\n1986; Sundström 1974). They can change their composition quickly by adding or hiving off members and changing their work regimes. The rapidity with which these changes can occur makes them difﬁcult to study in the historic perspective1 (M. Smith 1992). HO USEHOLDS AND THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY: SEVEN DYNAMIC FEATURES\n\nThe best way to understand the structure of the domestic economy is to examine what households actually do. Households did not become an important focus of study in anthropology until the 1980s (Arcury 1984; Bossen 1981; Netting et al. 1984; Wilk 1989b, 1991). This was because early ethnographers felt that larger kin groups such as lineages, clans, and phratries were the basis for social organization in early societies (cf. Engels 1978; Morgan 1877; J. Smith et al. 1984). Households were viewed as secondary social units. Rather than seeing the diversity in household structure as a key to their adaptive success, variation in form was equated with a breakdown of earlier forms of kinship organization.2 To understand how the domestic economy operates requires recognizing their seven core economic features and strategies. First and foremost, all households are the basic units of demographic reproduction within society (Wilk and Netting 1984; Wilk and Rathje 1982). Survival and reproduction are their only business. Households utilize the resources around them to ensure their success, and they thoughtfully deploy household labor to produce or procure the resources needed. Their primary goal is to enhance their economic well being, and it is within this framework that work is planned, organized, and implemented in premodern societies. Increased economic well being enhances their survivability and results in larger and healthier households with more labor to reinvest in production activities (Wood 1998). Labor availability is a key constraint on resource production needed for household growth, which is expanded through natural reproduction, recruitment, and the formation of reciprocal labor networks between households (Chapter 3). Second, households are not passive in their subsistence pursuits. The delayed interest in households until the 1980s resulted in a lack of information on how they operated and adapted to outside opportunities (Wilk 1989a, 1991). This created the false impression that households were passive or, at best, had a limited capacity to address all their resource needs. Nothing could be further from the truth. Instead, households actively search for ways to meet their resource needs because failure to do so threatens their survival. They were highly motivated because there were few social safety nets in ancient and premodern societies.\n\nTHE DOMESTIC ECONOMY\n\nWhile the ideal situation would be for all households to meet their resource needs, there are always cases of free riders in societies who consume more resources than they produce. Sahlins (1972) identiﬁed this problem and felt that some households intentionally produced below their recognized subsist ence needs. Reaching subsistence goals is more difﬁcult than estimating them. Annual ﬂuctuations in rainfall or temperature can lead to decreased availability of resources. The common response by households is to set production goals at levels to meet their needs during years of below normal yields (Halstead and O'Shea 1989). The result in normal and good years is the production of a food surplus that is available for normal consumption, intracommunity sharing, and intergroup feasting (Allan 1965:38; Halstead 1989). The problem for house holds is they generally lack the ability to plan for and manage extreme resource shortfalls. When these occur, households can be in serious trouble if higher level social institutions cannot supply aid (see Chapter 3) (O’Shea 1989). Third, household self sufﬁciency is the primary goal of the domestic econ omy (Gudeman 2001:43). Commoner households in antiquity regularly con sumed the food that they produced and did not rely on other households or the market for the majority of the food they needed to survive. For most households, anything else would have been a high risk economic strategy. That said, it would be incorrect to assume that ancient households existed as isolated, autonomous units and consumed only the goods that they produced themselves. Self sufﬁciency does not mean premodern households limited their production goals to auto consumption only. This view of household self sufﬁciency is derived from the Marxian contrast of production for use in traditional society with production for exchange in capitalist economies (Sahlins 1972:83–85). Self sufﬁciency as a household objective also involved production for exchange. Trade was an important component of the domestic economy even if it involved the movement of small quantities of goods. Archaeological research has established that completely self sufﬁcient households were rare. Instead, past households regularly interacted with neighbors both inside and outside their communities to obtain goods and to enhance their overall economic well being. There are two reasons for this. First, households in antiquity lacked the time and labor to produce all the resources and items that they desired. Strict adherence to the principle of self sufﬁciency would have deprived households of many different items. Second, as will be explored more fully below, complete self sufﬁciency would have lowered their overall sur vivability. Research has shown that household survival is enhanced by the development of multiple resource strategies and cross cutting exchange net works with other households. Interhousehold exchange networks provided a network through which households could mobilize resources during times of shortage (O’Shea 1989).\n\n21\n\n22\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\nThe fourth characteristic of the domestic economy is the ability of house holds to intensify production and increase their ability to produce or acquire food. Resource shortfalls were always a concern for households, especially in large, sedentary societies.3 One way to offset this problem was to intensify the use or production of the most productive resources (Hayden 1990; B. Smith 2001). The best example of this is the cultivation of high yield grains in agricultural societies (Aldrete and Mattingly 1999; Bar Yosef and Meadow 1995; Flannery 1973) and the practice of animal pastoralism (Zeder 1988). The view that premodern households lacked the ability to intensify pro duction has been shaped by three factors. The ﬁrst was the development of neo evolutionary theory that advocated the role of centralized political authority as the engine behind culture change (Carneiro 1970, 1974; Wittfogel 1957). From this perspective households were too small to intensify their production systems and required institutional assistance to do so. The second contributing factor was the assumption that households could not produce a surplus, consumed all the resources they produced, and the only way a surplus could be extracted was through forms of taxation (Harris 1959). That households consumed a large percentage of what they produce is con gruent with their overall production strategy. But that does not imply that they could not intensify production. Although production levels could vary, many households regularly produced surpluses above their biological or subsistence requirements to meet social and ritual obligations, to satisfy special needs, and to protect themselves from subsistence risk (Allan 1965; Hayden 2001b; O’Shea 1989). Third, small household size was also seen as restricting the ability to intensify production. It is true that households have a limited labor supply, but that does not mean they could not intensify production with the available labor. Ethnographic research has demonstrated that households have intensiﬁed agricultural production by building terrace and irrigation systems in different places around the world.4 Agricultural intensiﬁcation is only one facet of diversiﬁed subsistence strategies employed by small households.5 Sustainable intensiﬁcation is the essence of the smallholder adaptation and would be expected in the past under conditions of limited or restricted access to agricul tural land (Netting 1990, 1993; Stone 1986). Research by Alexander Chayanov (1966) established that agricultural house holds faced internal stresses that were part of the normal household life cycle that encouraged the intensiﬁcation of production. He showed that newly formed households with young children were under more resource stress than older households with adolescents or unmarried adults. The reason was that young children consumed more resources than they contributed to the house hold resource pool. Adults, therefore, had to work harder than if they were just producing for themselves (Durrenberger 1984), resulting in a small degree of intensiﬁcation. An alternative response to reduce stress was to reside in\n\nTHE DOMESTIC ECONOMY\n\nlarger, multigenerational households that had a higher ratio of working adults to young dependents. Large families can lower the consumer to producer ratio, but that does not mean that members would work less. In fact, the efﬁciency of work in large households could increase since they can effectively handle the multiple simultaneous (inelastic) labor demands that occur within the annual work cycle (Wilk 1991:182–183). For example, the ability to share child care releases women to expand their scope of work by engaging in subsistence production, trade, craft activity, and/or alternative forms of service labor (Clark 1989). A great deal of variation in household size can be found in every society. Nevertheless, large households always had an advantage over small house holds in the amount of labor they could mobilize for production or invest in agricultural improvements such as terrace building, fencing, or manuring (Bernbeck 1995; Hajnal 1982). Household members often seek to optimize the returns to their labor the best that they can (Mayer 2002). The higher marginal productivity of large households helped buffer them against food shortages, and their labor advantage explains why many households in agricultural societies were organized as multigenerational domestic units (Hajnal 1982). A ﬁfth feature of households is that they systematically sought to minimize subsistence risk by adopting a resource diversiﬁcation strategy.6 Diversiﬁcation involved exploiting multiple resource groups and broadening the scope of food resources consumed or exploited to ensure household survivability7 (O’Shea 1989). A diversiﬁed production strategy helped to offset cyclical and seasonal resource shortfalls throughout the year (Arnold 1988; Davies 1996; Halstead and O’Shea 1989; Messer 1989). While diversiﬁcation strategies potentially involve more work than specialized production (Winterhalder 1981), they provided households with predictable food stocks. According to O’Shea (1989), the need to minimize risk was the most important variable in determining the structure of domestic production systems. The reason is that it provided a safer and more predictable strategy for households than the more productive but riskier strategy of production specialization (Cashdan 1990; Winterhalder et al. 1999). Scott (1976) has argued that households consciously opt for a safety ﬁrst subsistence strategy. But that does not mean that they do not take risks in order to increase production returns. Agricultural households will gamble on riskier, higher production activities when they know that their subsistence needs are met, that their members are secure, and that success in a risky activity could measurably increase their economic well being (Popkin 1979:21). Risk mini mization and maximization strategies are not incompatible activities but involve conscious decision making to balance risk versus potential beneﬁts. Gallant (1991:38–42) makes the case that rural agricultural households in\n\n23\n\n24\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\nancient Greece used a variety of agricultural strategies including intercropping, crop diversiﬁcation, and small ﬁeld dispersal as ways to maximize agricultural yields while minimizing risk. A sixth characteristic of the domestic economy was the use of interhouse hold exchange as another strategy to minimize subsistence risk. That does not mean that the quantity of goods exchanged had to be large to be important. The establishment and maintenance of alternative networks of resource access can be vital for household survival. Polly Wiessner has shown that !Kung San foragers spent a signiﬁcant amount of time manufacturing small gifts to exchange with individuals in different bands to establish mutual support networks that stretched across different resource areas (Lee 1993; Scott 2003; Wiessner 1977, 1982, 2002). As societies grew in size, production for exchange increased in importance as rural households produced food, ﬁber, or craft goods consumed by centralized elite institutions, urban settlements, or grow ing interregional commercial networks (D’Altroy and Earle 1985; Earle 1994; Fall et al. 2002; Finley 1985). Interhousehold food sharing networks were important for family survival in premodern societies even when it involved the exchange of similar commod ities that were available in abundant supply (Bliege Bird and Smith 2005; Bliege Bird et al. 2002; Gregory 1981). The value of food sharing networks was that they were maintained and could be activated when they were needed. Sen’s theory of exchange entitlement looks at how the construction of exchange and social network relationships helped to buffer families and house holds against resource shortfalls in difﬁcult times. He feels that many famines are just as much a result of faulty systems of food distribution as they are shortfalls in resource production (Sen 1981). Households that develop better ways to access food resources through trade, production, labor access, and charitable networks have a better chance of surviving famine and other forms of social stress. But interhousehold exchanges involved more than just food; they also involved the exchange of ﬁnished goods. Archaeological research has proposed that ad hoc, special purpose crafting appeared early in human societies to fulﬁll both ritual and personal needs (White 1993, 2007). Examples of early special ized craft production date to as early as the Upper Paleolithic period (40,000–9000 BC), which included the production of both ceramic ﬁgurines8 and chert blades for ritual and utilitarian purposes.9 Items of personal adorn ment traded over distances of 100–800 kilometers included beads and pendants manufactured from ivory, amber, soapstone, and marine shell (R. White 2003: ﬁgure 9; 2007). Obsidian for sharp cutting tools likewise moved over 200–600 kilometers by land and 600–1000 kilometers over water (Grebennikov et al. 2010; Izuho and Hirose 2010; Kuzmin 2010:149; Tsutsumi 2010). Of course, these are the materials that have been preserved. One can only imagine the\n\nTHE DOMESTIC ECONOMY\n\nquantity of perishable materials including food and hides that also moved through interhousehold exchanges. Interhousehold exchange networks became more important for resource provisioning as societies became less mobile and individual households had less direct access to different resource zones with increased sedentism. The items often produced for exchange among agriculturalists include cooking pots, baskets, special apparel, cloth or hides, items of personal adornment, wooden implements, and cutting tools, as well as ﬁgurines and other items used in social, ritual, and mortuary activities (Clark and Blake 1994; Harding 1967; Helms 1993; Hughes 1973, 1977). In sedentary societies, craft production became an important component of the domestic economy for some house holds (Hirth 2009b). The production of goods for exchange increased in importance within the domestic economy when craft goods began to move in reciprocal exchanges for food.10 That was the point when craft production was incorporated into household subsistence strategies. It enabled households to utilize labor available during slack periods of the annual work cycle and to produce items without disrupting other subsistence activities (Hagstrum 1999, 2001). The practice of small scale intermittent craft production is common in societies where seasonal agriculture is the primary subsistence activity.11 It allows households to micro manage their labor, moving easily from one activity to another on a daily or even hourly basis12 (Hagstrum 2001:49). Craft production is an additional diversiﬁcation strategy that enables households to expand their subsistence base through exchange if other households chose to participate. A seventh and ﬁnal feature of the domestic economy is that households are social organisms that need to reproduce socially as well as biologically. Household social reproduction involves engaging in intracommunity activities that often require material accumulations or expenditures to achieve the social statuses desired for household members and their offspring (Blanton 1994:19). Children change their status as they grow and mature into adulthood. These changes frequently are marked by feasts and celebrations that require special durable goods that often have to be obtained outside the immediate house hold. Material expenditures accompany the socialization and education of offspring. The most economically demanding change in social status of household members occurs at marriage. First and foremost, a spouse must be obtained from outside the family, which often involved considerable planning, economic accumulation, and the expenditure of effort to mediate the transition. Economic transactions associated with obtaining a spouse included bridewealth, brideprice, dowry, arranged marriage, marriage payments, groomprice, and bride service (S. Anderson 2007; Dalton 1966; Goody and Tambiah 1973; Kaplan 1985; F. Pryor 1977). A fundamental economic feature of these different\n\n25\n\n26\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\nspousal arrangements was whether the goods or services required were provided by the family of the bride (dowry, groomprice) or the groom (brideprice, bride service). These payments varied from society to society, but they all entailed the movement of economic goods or services before, during, and/or after the marriage ceremony. On the whole marriage was an expensive undertaking. Assembling the array of staple and durable goods for a new household took a long period of time. Finding a hardworking and compatible spouse for raising offspring was essen tial for the success of the household. In the premodern era this often involved long and careful negotiations between family groups through preexisting social connections. These interactions often involved establishing interhousehold gift relations as an important preamble to these negotiations.13 The combination of these seven factors led to the creation of mixed household economies that went beyond production of subsistence goods. The diversity of intersecting and divergent goals found in each household shaped the domestic economy in different ways. Households allocated labor to different tasks as their goals and opportunities permitted. The result was that households engaged in a mix of production strategies to produce goods for their internal consumption and for exchange. It is this combination of different production activities for both use and exchange that deﬁnes a mixed house hold economy. It can combine different food production strategies such as agriculture, pastoralism, foraging, and hunting (Bates 2001), with different forms of nonfood production including crafting, commercial trade, wage or service labor, and cash cropping as means to meet household needs. Rather than specializing in a single pursuit, households commonly diversiﬁed their economic activities by engaging in a mix of both subsistence and commercial activities (Castanzo 2009; Netting 1990, 1993; Sundström 1974). This could result in a remarkable diversity of microeconomic activities within households as they followed their strategic self interest. The practice of diversifying household production strategies was common in early state societies where commercial opportunities allowed agricultural households to use their inter mittently available labor surpluses in creative ways. HO USEHOLD SUBSISTENCE DIVERSIFICATION IN 16TH CENTURY CENTRAL MEXICO\n\nThe Aztecs of Central Mexico were conquered by the Spanish and Hernán Cortes in AD 1521. With conquest, the indigenous society underwent signiﬁ cant population reductions caused by the introduction of new, infectious diseases from Europe (Cook and Simpson 1948). Nevertheless, except for increasingly high labor demands imposed by the Spanish, the economic activities of most indigenous households continued much as they had prior\n\nTHE DOMESTIC ECONOMY\n\nto conquest. Many Central Mexican households practiced a mixed household economy, engaging in a wide array of production and service activities. They demonstrate how indigenous households used the marketplace to diversify their subsistence activities and improve their economic well being by provid ing services or becoming involved in production for commercial exchange. The term “Aztec” is used in a generic sense to refer to the general way of life found across Central Mexico during the 15th and early 16th centuries AD. The society was agrarian. Commoners were farmers, elites were sup ported by their agricultural estates, and even merchants and artisans had small agricultural plots that provided food to support their households. Land was not held privately; elites had hereditary and prebendal estates and controlled the assignment of state and communal lands.14 Commoners accessed land through communal land holding bodies known as calpultin, or directly from elites by entering into special service relationships with them. All households had access to land, including those located in urban centers, even if they were small house plots.15 Farming, therefore, was the foundational subsistence base that all households engaged in. Each commoner household farmed the land assigned to them, and corvée labor was used to work the estate lands of the elite. Slave labor was not employed in agriculture except in restricted and unusual circumstances16 (Hirth 2016). The centerpiece of the Aztec economy, as in other groups across Mesoamerica, was the presence of marketplaces in many large and medium sized communities (Chapter 9). Marketplaces were important for the domestic economy for two reasons. First, the marketplace was organized for household provisioning. Marketplaces were spaced closely to one another and were held on a rotating schedule, so most households had access to a market within a single day’s walk from home. Surplus goods were sold there, and households could purchase anything they needed either through barter or by using one of the native currencies, particularly cacao beans or woven cotton textiles (Berdan 1975, 2014; Rojas 1995; M. Smith 2012). Second, the marketplace was open to all members of society and provided commercial opportunities for any household with goods for sale. Most crafting was carried out in individual homes, and ﬁnished goods were brought for sale in the marketplace. There were no restrictions on the number of craftspersons who could produce goods in society, and most crafting was carried out by intermittent and part time craft producers rather than full time artisans. Fresh vegetables were available in the marketplaces of the Aztec capital throughout the entire year, which suggests that some farmers raised crops for commercial sale.17 Women vendors prepared food in their homes which they brought to sell in the marketplace. This often was a part time activity because most markets, including those in large cities, met on a rotating 5 day schedule. The\n\n27\n\n28\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES\n\nmarketplace provided every household with the opportunity to diversify their internal production regimens, make use of intermittent labor surpluses, and offer goods for sale even in small quantities. Women were active in the marketplace as vendors even during the agricultural cycle when men worked in the ﬁelds. The few existing Aztec period land registers suggest that some households were land poor in relation to others (Williams and Harvey 1997; Williams and Hicks 2011), and the importance of market commerce for the household subsistence was inversely proportional to the amount of land available for household cultivation. But the question of interest here is, How diversiﬁed were households in the production of secondary food products, craft goods, or the practice of service activities to augment the agricultural activities that every household engaged in? A document entitled the Matricula de Huexotzinco compiled in AD 1560 contains a rich array of information that addresses this issue.18 The document is a census of twenty two indigenous rural communities in the Huexotzinco province of Puebla Tlaxcala, Mexico (Brito Guaddarrama 2011; Prem 1974; Warren 1971). The Matricula was prepared by pre Columbian scribes as a pictorial document (Figure 2.1), listing each com moner household, whether t"
