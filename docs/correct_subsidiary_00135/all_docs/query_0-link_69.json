        "text": "Our greatest hope back then was to find a partner who truly believed in us as founders and respected what we had already accomplished.\n\nWe’ve never forgotten how we wanted to be treated, how hard we wanted our VC firm to work for us, and how much success meant. We assume you feel the same, so that’s our modus operandi.\n\nCode Cubitt is a Managing Director at Mistral, based in Ottawa. He has over 25 years of experience as a founder, executive and investor and has worked with over 50 early-stage startups. Code was previously the COO at Zephyr Technology- a VC-backed startup that was acquired by Medtronic.\n\nBernie Zeisig is a Managing Partner at Mistral and brings over 25 years of venture investing experience and 35 years of company building experience in both the United States and Canada. He has participated in over 70 rounds of financing and has built a proven, trusted network for deal flow, deal management and realization.\n\nRaif, a startup CTO turned VC, has founded multiple VC-backed companies in the Bay Area and Toronto, two of which were acquired, and two reached millions of users. Most recently, at Nuula, a fintech that's raised $120M, he was the founding VP Eng at Loblaw Digital, building a team of 150 through revenue growth of zero to over $100M (today at $3B)."
