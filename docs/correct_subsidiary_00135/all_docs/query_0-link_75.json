        "text": "When I was building my first company, I got in front of a former CEO of Burger King. I remember that conversation to this day. He talked about how, even though he was the CEO of Burger King — this big public company — he felt like he was a fraud. I had instant empathy because that's how I felt then — we both had the same feelings in different places. It's natural for everyone to have that imposter complex where you feel like you don't deserve it, or you feel insecure. I learned that if someone with that pedigree had it, everyone has it — it's just something you have to deal with, and that's ok.\n\nYou gain confidence in life by taking initiative. It's how you become 'good' at anything. Get out of your comfort zone. Once you take initiative and experience a bit of success, it gets easier. Go out and start talking to people.\n\nThe reality is people want to help you as an entrepreneur. Through talking to people you're going to learn so much. Prospective customers, people you admire who are where you want to be are both great places to start. The feedback you get will help you build confidence in what you're doing — and sometimes it’ll invalidate your idea, which is equally as important.\n\nFounders should always do their homework on a potential investor, just like the investor is doing on you. One of the best things you can do is talk to other founders they've worked with, and ask the tough questions. Get a sense of how they handle good times, and how they react during challenging times, how engaged they are, etc. This is really important to understand upfront because you want to find a VC who will be a true partner for the long haul, truly accelerating your success.\n\nTypically when we invest, it's pretty early on for the company. We're looking for founders working on exciting things, with a vision and values we support. However, we're also looking at the team they've built. One of the most important aspects of being a valuable partner is our ability to be an impartial guide and help the founders understand team dynamics and challenges.\n\nOne of the things that I do operate on and believe more than most is that people create their own reality. An entrepreneur is a great example of that. They have a vision, and it's something that doesn't exist today. You're making that reality happen, and you do it consciously. There's so much power in that.\n\nThere's a pragmatic approach in the middle of the country where you take the money that you need, prove the next steps, and build more value. Founders usually should want to raise the minimum amount that they need for the next step because that’s always in everyone's interest.\n\nOver time, we help our founders put the structure in place — KPI reporting, team, all those things that help you optimize time and money. Then we help them think on the other side of it — challenging them to think bigger and strategize how to achieve their vision faster.\n\nWhen I talk with entrepreneurs about what they are going through, and how we'll add value as a partner, I often think about it in terms of obstacles. As a founder, you have no idea what you're going to face. When an obstacle arises, I'm hopeful that either I've experienced those challenges firsthand, or someone from our team or board has. Either way, we'll be able to provide guidance — but some of those challenges will be new for everyone. We'll figure it out together.\n\nAt the end of the day, that's why entrepreneurs do this. It's fun to try to achieve something big."
