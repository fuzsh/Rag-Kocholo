        "meta_description": "The beautiful church of St Georgeâ€™s is a famous attraction of Poynton. Located in the middle of the Poynton town, this Cheshire church is a site of English heritage. This Anglican Church was built in the 19th century though historical facts suggest the presence of another church on the site dating back to 14th century. Built in the Gothic style of architecture, the church has a beautiful spire which is around 133 feet 10 inches (40.8 meters) tall. This yellow rubble stone building is made with locally quarried stone. The slate roofs add to the mystic appeal of the church. The elaborate churchyard houses graves of war veterans. Check website for information on timings and services.",
