        "text": "Affordable invisible braces for straightening teeth at home\n\nAt mydentist, Park Avenue, Poynton we can help you achieve straighter teeth safely and conveniently under the care of the UK’s largest group of qualified dentists. We are dedicated to helping people discover their smiles. As we’re UK based and owned, you can be assured that we are on hand every step of the way should you have any questions.\n\nOur registered dentists use the latest digital technology to create a treatment plan just for you that will give you straighter teeth safely and conveniently.\n\nUsing clear braces, which are almost invisible, your teeth will be gently and slowly moved into position over the course of several months. We’ll keep a check on your progress and you can contact us anytime should you have any questions.\n\nWe only work with dental clinicians\n\nAs well as our network of dentists we also have a UK-wide network of qualified orthodontists, should you need more complex treatment. While all of the dentists you will see are trained to provide teeth straightening with clear aligners, some patients might need to see a specialist orthodontist if their teeth are very crowded. Whatever your needs you can relax in the knowledge that we can help.\n\nClinically safe\n\nAll mydentist patients have their treatment overseen by a UK registered dentist. We will make sure that your teeth and overall oral health are in good shape before we start teeth straightening and check in with you regularly to make sure that the treatment is progressing as planned. That means you can rest assured that at the end of treatment your teeth will look and feel great. All of our practices are regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the UK’s healthcare governing body, and are subject to the strictest clinical protocols."
