        "text": "When visited:\n\n8th January 2005, 10am\n\nLocation:\n\nAt the junction in the middle of Poynton\n\nWelcome:\n\nPeople at the door shaking hands. I wasn't on my own, but no-one really spoke to me before the service. Several people did afterwards - there was a long queue to get out and to the church hall for coffee, and people chatted a lot in the queue.\n\nType of Service:\n\nModern language communion liturgy, some bits of which were missed out. Robes and choir procession. A few bits were sung, but the music was printed in the service book, which is nice to see.\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nAbout 200 people there, very good mix of ages. The administration was excellently done from a logistical point of view, though there were people (older members of the congregation) at the back chatting all through the administration, which I found very distracting.\n\nMusic:\n\nOrgan and music group. Good mix of older and newer stuff, singing wasn't especially good.\n\nSermon:\n\nThe vicar apologised that there wasn't Bible teaching. Instead he said a bit about a trip he was planning to do to India. To my mind, skipping the sermon is not on.\n\nAs you can see from the comments, I'm assured that usually there's good teaching, and that this was the exception. I'm happy to believe that - shame I hit the exception...\n\nWebsite:\n\nyes, though it appears to be somewhat oddly maintained. Some information on there is for last month, some for next month, very little for this month.\n\nOverall:\n\nGives the impression of being a growing church, but the lack of a sermon would give me second thoughts before coming back."
