        "text": "I think we all know what sort of a year 2020 has been, so when Sarah & Ed told me that they were going ahead with their December wedding I was absolutely delighted. They made some changes to their day, naturally. Same church, but a venue switch that would be more suited to the kind of reception they wanted to have (only 15 allowed remember!) and it was perfection. Intimate, emotional, fun, a genuinely lovely group of people and I had an absolute blast!\n\nI started off in the morning meeting Sarah and her bridesmaids at her Mumâ€™s house in Bramhall and it was so much fun! Laughter, a few tears thanks to Sarahâ€™s sister, Emma, surprising her with a video of messages from friends and family who were unable to join them on their special day and mountains of scrambled eggs (with the controversial addition of tomato ketchup for one diner who will remain nameless!)\n\nFrom there, it was over to St Georgeâ€™s Church in Poynton (my old stomping ground!) for the wedding itself which was just magical. Sarahâ€™s Mum and Dad were married in that very church and so we recreated some of their wedding photos as a nod to their special day, which was a lovely touch. After confetti, we headed over to Poynton Pool for some photos of just the two of them before we met up with their guests at The Stanneylands Hotel in Styal for their reception.\n\nGreat food, fine wine and brilliant speeches followed and before I left them to a wonderful evening with their friends and family, more drinks and promises from bridesmaids that they were â€˜only having a coupleâ€™ (Leanne! ?) we shot some of my signature night time photographs for a little added drama!\n\nIt was a truly wonderful day from start to finish and a pleasure to spend the day not just with Sarah & Ed, but with their lovely friends and family too ?\n\nEnjoy this little sneak peek at their big dayâ€¦.\n\nThank you again Sarah & Ed for having me along to your stunning intimate Cheshire wedding, I loved every second!\n\nSupplier shout out to the wonderful team at The Stanneylands Hotel for looking after me and lovely working with my friends, Myke Caulton Floral Couture and Agape Bridal Boutique ðŸ™‚\n\nJD xxx"
