        "text": "An audience of nearly 300 people were there at The Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester for St George’s Singers triumphant return to the concert platform on Saturday with J. S. Bach’s St John Passion, a great work full of drama and beautiful tunes. The six professional soloists were stunning, the orchestra, Baroque In The North, were superb and the choir gave a thrilling performance despite their numbers being cut back by Covid.\n\nThe concert was dedicated to the people of Ukraine and opened with a Ukranian hymn. A collection for the Disasters Emergency fund was made at the end and the audience donated a very generous £475."
