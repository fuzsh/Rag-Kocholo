        "text": "Lent 2014 - Uncover\n\nDuring Lent we will âuncoverâ the real Jesus in Lukeâs gospel.\n\nOn six Sundays we will be looking at six readings from Lukeâs gospel and this will be complemented by using the Uncover Seeker Bible Study Guide in our homegroups. This is a series of six evangelistic Bible studies in Lukeâs Gospel. Written by international evangelist Becky Manley Pippert, this self-contained, ready-to-go, bible study guide does not require expert knowledge to use. Using experts from Lukeâs Gospel, the Uncover Seeker Bible Study Guide is ideal for reading with friends in a one-to-one or small group setting.\n\nThe Uncov er Gospel may be used with the Uncover Seeker Bible Study Guide, although this is not essential. It provides an opportunity to examine the evidence by exploring the source text and features an array of interactive and online options.\n\nThe Uncover Bible Study Guide and the Uncover Gospel may be obtained from homegroup leaders or for more information please phone the Church office."
