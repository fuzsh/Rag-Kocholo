        "text": "Music for Passiontide\n\nSt George’s Church, Poynton\n\nSaturday 17 March, 7.30pm\n\nSt George’s Singers are looking forward to performing their next concert on Saturday 17th March in their “home” church of St George’s Poynton where the choir was first formed in 1957. In that year the new choir sang The Crucifixion composed in 1887 by John Stainer and the same work forms the centrepiece of their Music for Passiontide on March 17th. The piece was written to be sung by Victorian church choirs and congregations as a more accessible alternative to Bach’s Passions and includes the beautiful chorus God so loved the world. This was the time when Gilbert and Sullivan were at their peak of popularity and it is easy to imagine the same singers enjoying a performance of a G&S opera on Saturday and lustily singing Crucifixion choruses on Sunday. It is not so often heard today, though some of Stainer’s other music is still sung regularly in church services (he composed the hymns Love divine all loves excelling and Good Christian men rejoice).\n\nThe concert also includes beautiful Passiontide music spanning six centuries from Thomas Tallis, Orlando Gibbons, and Henry Purcell through to contemporary composers Bob Chilcott and Ola Gjeilo."
