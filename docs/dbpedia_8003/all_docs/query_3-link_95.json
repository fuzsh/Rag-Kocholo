        "text": "LAYING THE FOUNDATION STONE OF A NEW CHURCH AT POYNTON – The foundation stone of a new church was laid at Poynton on Wednesday by the Hon Augustus Henry Vernon, eldest son of the Right Hon Lord Vernon, who is patron of the church. The site is that of the old chapel, at the point where the main road is intersected by the highway from Worth to Woodford, but which building was condemned as unsafe about twelve months ago, and pulled down. So far back as 546 years ago, an ancient stone church, dedicated to St Mary, stood near “The Towers,” the residence of the agent of Lord Vernon; but owing to some dispute under the ecclesiastical aw with Sir George Warren, knight, the then possessor of the Poynton estate, that edifice was taken down, and a chapel of brick, called St George’s erected on the site now in question. However, owing to the rapid increase in population, and the want of corresponding accommodation, an addition was made in 1839. In a few years, the timbers put into the additions made in 1839, gradually gave way; this was succeeded by a sinking of the whole fabric; and the building was held to be decidedly unsafe. The ratepayers determined twelve months ago, to have a new structure, at a cost of nearly £3,000, from plans designed by Mr Crowther, architect, Manchester. The style is to be of the of the Gothic or early ecclesiastical, with pointed roof; with chancel, nave, south porch, vestry, communion table etc. There will be no galleries, and the pews will be open; accommodation being provided for 600 sittings – all of which will be free. [Manchester Guardian 12 April 1858 page 2]\n\nPOYNTON - Workmen have been engaged in taking down the old Episcopal Chapel at Poynton, which was in a very dilapidated and dangerous state. The debris having been removed, arrangements, we believe, have been made for laying the foundation-stone of a new church. The style of the building, to be erected on the old site, will be similar to that of the new church at Alderley; and the design and plans have been furnished by Mr. Crowther, of Manchester, architect. [Builder 24 April 1858 page 280]"
