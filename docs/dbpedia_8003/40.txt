Centenary Video

Derek Jones writes: “September 2023 was a very significant milestone in the life of the church at St. Martin’s. 100 years ago, 2nd September 1923, a place of worship in Higher Poynton was established by the PCC of St. George’s Church Poynton, with the blessing of the then Bishop of Chester, The Rt Rev’d Henry Paget.

The occasion was marked at St. George’s by an exhibition on it’s Heritage Open Day on 16th September 2023, and was also marked by a Centenary Luncheon in St. Martin’s splendid church hall in which a documentary video was enjoyed by over 40 ‘Friends of St. Martin’s’.

For the vision of the PCC, Bishop Paget and all those earlier saints at St. Martin’s we say, as always,

‘Praise God from Whom all blessings flow . . ‘.”
