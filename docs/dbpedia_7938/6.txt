Statehood: When did your State Join the Union - Find a directory of dates that states were admitted into the union. Or read about the US Territories

This is a list of US states by date of statehood, that is, the date when each US state joined the Union. Although the first 13 states can be considered to have been members of the United States from the date of the Declaration of Independence - Thursday, July 4, 1776 - they are presented here as being "admitted" on the date each ratified the present United States Constitution; most other such lists, including the 50 State Quarters program, do the same. The admission dates for later states were set by either the act of admission or a later resolution issued under that act, except for Ohio, whose date of admission was determined by act of Congress in 1953
