        "text": "As family historians, almost all of us have used census population schedules but many are unaware that state censuses even exist. Each time the federal census was taken (every 10 years starting in 1790), new questions were posed that aligned with the times. Residents’ ages, birth places, nationalities and even marriage date, illness and military affiliation were sometimes noted. You can see our complete guide to the federal censuses here.\n\nBut the U.S. government was not the only one taking censuses. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, many states conducted their own censuses as well. These schedules were taken in the space between the decades, making them particularly valuable, and are packed with information. We discussed these records in an earlier article on Family History Daily.\n\nIn this guide you will find details about what these important records may contain, as well as a full list of every single state census and where you can search them for yourself. We have included free options, as well as links to these records on the top subscription sites, for every available location.\n\nPlease note that we have only included information for state censuses taken once a location achieved statehood – and only the main population schedules for that state (those that typically contain heads of household or family groups).\n\nThis guide does not include territorial censuses taken before statehood unless they are part of a larger collection, or special schedules (such as mortality, veterans or business). Many states do have these additional records, however, and they can be very helpful.\n\nIf you find that your state offers census records, consider also visiting the FamilySearch Wikis to see what other schedules might be available. Go to this page and search for your state and the word “census” to do so.\n\nFamily History Daily also offers a guide to free, online state archives and these databases may contain additional census, territorial or related records. See the U.S. state by state research guide here.\n\nWhat Information Can Be Found on a State Census Record?\n\nThe state census identified heads-of-households and family groups, and focused on questions of birthplace, age, and occupation. Many were just as complex as their federal counterparts, while some came from a more limited angle.\n\nIn some cases, state census records can even provide greater specificity than its federal counterpart. For instance, you might find mention of a stepchild, son-in-law or even an apprentice in the 1855 state census for New York (above) – whereas the federal census did not start recording such relationships to the head of household until 1880.\n\nAs was common in the federal census records of the time, some state’s also highlighted education and health factors, as in the 1885 Nebraska state census below.\n\nOthers, including New York’s 1915 state census, asked questions pertaining to citizenship as well as institutional confinement.\n\nState censuses are an amazing resource that may close gaps in your research, especially when federal schedules are lost. If you have New York ancestors, the famous loss of the 1890 U.S. census can almost be remedied by researching New York State’s 1892 census.\n\nSeveral states, including Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota and Wisconsin ran a state census in 1895 as well, making them especially useful for filling in that gap at the end of the 19th century.\n\nAt a time in history when other records may lack information, state censuses sometimes offer great detail that may not exist elsewhere and help you identify names and details about family members who died or married between the decades. They often pinpoint locality with a higher degree of accuracy as well. Don’t miss these valuable documents.\n\nHere’s How to Access State Census Records for Family History Research\n\nThe following list attempts to include only state-issued censuses taken after each state entered the union. To ensure that your research has identified all possible state censuses, it is always wise to contact the archives for each state.\n\nFor each state we have listed the years where a census is available, as well as the locations online where you can find those records. We have attempted to find these censuses on FamilySearch, an always free option. Popular subscription sites($) that contain these records are listed for your convenience.\n\nBecause we have teamed up with many subscription sites to bring you deals and information about their services, we may earn a commission if you take advantage of the records on these sites. This is how we support the work done on Family History Daily at no additional cost to you.\n\nAlabama\n\nEntered the union on 14 December 1819.\n\n1820\n\n1850\n\n1855\n\n1866\n\nEach of the censuses listed above can be found at Ancestry ($).
