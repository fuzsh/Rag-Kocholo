        "text": "Up to 45 semester hours of credit can be awarded by taking AICE, AP, IB, or CLEP tests and achieving appropriate scores.* To receive credit, official test scores must be sent directly to the Office of Admissions. Credit will be awarded only once for the same subject, whether from credit by examination, dual enrollment, transfer credit, or FSU course credit. Credit awarded for dual enrollment or transfer courses takes precedence over credit by examination.\n\nStudents enrolled in college coursework prior to graduation from high school (dual enrollment) may be awarded college credit. An official college transcript will be required for the posting of credit. We will not post college credit from a high school transcript.\n\nCollege Credit for Courses Taken Through Dual-Enrollment\n\nCollege courses taken through dual enrollment will permanently be a part of your college transcript(s) regardless of the grade earned. An official college transcript must be sent to the Office of Admissions before you enroll. Students who receive any grades below C are subject to the offer of admission being rescinded. Transfer credit will be awarded for academic (non-technical/non-vocational/non-remedial) courses. If a student attempts a college course and also earns test credit through AP, AICE, CLEP, or IB, the test credit will not be added to the student's academic record. The Office of Undergraduate Studies will evaluate transfer credit to determine how it may fulfill CoreFSU requirements. Students may visit the CoreFSU website to learn more about these CoreFSU requirements and search the CoreFSU course database. Earning an Associate in Arts (AA) degree from a Florida public college or university will automatically satisfy the CoreFSU requirements.\n\nMilitary Experience Course Credit\n\nStudents who are eligible members of the United States Armed Forces may earn college credit based upon their military experiences, training, and coursework acquired while in the military. Credit earned for military experiences, training, and coursework will be applied to a student's academic program in the same manner as any other form of transfer credit:\n\nApplied as a major/minor requirement replacing the equivalent required or optional course taught by the University;\n\nApplied as a CoreFSU requirement replacing the equivalent required or optional course taught by the University; or\n\nApplied as a general elective. In accordance with Florida Board of Governors Regulation 6.013, which governs the uniform award of postsecondary credit or clock hours to certain service members and veterans of the United States Armed Forces, the list of specific FSU course and credit hour equivalencies for military training, courses, and occupations can be accessed on our military credit page.\n\nCredit earned will only be evaluated after an applicant has been granted admission to the university. Upon admission to FSU, students must provide the Registrar with the official military transcripts, which may be ordered through the American Council on Education (ACE) website, along with a copy of your DD214 (military discharge document). While credits earned for military-related training do not factor into the admissions application review process, the FSU Student Veterans Center will partner with the academic dean in your major program to evaluate any military training that does not have a statewide equivalency guarantee to determine if additional credit can be awarded.\n\nScores and University Course Equivalents\n\nAICE\n\nAP\n\nIB\n\nCLEP\n\nMilitary Credit\n\nA complete list of our undergraduate majors, along with program descriptions, academic maps, and contact information can be found in the Academic Program Guide.\n\n* Subject to change. Legislation calls for an annual review to determine the appropriate examination scores and courses for which credit is to be granted."
