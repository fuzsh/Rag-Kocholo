Note that jurisdictions that adopt the UBE may be indicated as such with incomplete information until rule amendments are finalized.\n\nThe Uniform Bar Examination (UBE) is coordinated by NCBE and is composed of the following components:\n\nthe Multistate Essay Examination (MEE),\n\ntwo Multistate Performance Test (MPT) tasks\n\nthe Multistate Bar Examination (MBE).\n\nIt is uniformly administered, graded, and scored and results in a portable score that can be transferred to other UBE jurisdictions.\n\nApplicants register for the UBE by applying to a user jurisdiction for the bar exam. Applicants who have taken the UBE may transfer their UBE scores to seek admission in other UBE jurisdictions.\n\nNCBE scores the MBE component of the UBE. Jurisdictions grade the MEE and MPT components. The MEE and MPT scores are scaled to the MBE and UBE total scores are calculated by NCBE. The MBE is weighted 50%, the MEE 30%, and the MPT 20%. UBE total scores are reported on a 400-point scale."
