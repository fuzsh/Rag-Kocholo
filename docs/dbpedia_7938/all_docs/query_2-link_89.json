        "text": "Understanding your bill\n\nThe Office of Financial Aid at Central State University recently received questions regarding billing and the application of scholarship monies to a student's costs for college.\n\nAll students receive a bill if they have a balance due at the time of bill processing. The first financial aid disbursement for the fall 2024 semester is Sept. 4, and this may have occurred after you received your bill, so the financial aid had not yet been applied.\n\nTo ensure you understand your financial obligations, please check the financial aid tab in your student portal to compare aid vs. charges; log into your student account center where any memo aid is also reflected next to your current term charges; or click the button in the eBill to view your statement in its entirety.\n\nBy taking these steps, you will see any aid awarded before it is posted to your account. Once aid has been disbursed for the term, any future bills will display payments made to your account from scholarships, federal aid, and loans. Central State requires attendance before aid is disbursed. If you have any questions, please contact the Office of Financial Aid.\n\nUpdate: Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 disbursement dates\n\nFinancial aid disbursement occurs when your student account is credited with financial aid funds and the funds from your financial aid package move to your student account to pay for your charges. Refunds will follow approximately 14 days after the disbursement.\n\nFall 2024\n\n— Sept. 4\n\n— Sept. 18 (financial aid disbursement for first-time borrowers)\n\n— Oct. 2\n\n— Oct. 16\n\n— Nov. 6\n\n— Dec. 4\n\n— Jan. 15\n\nSpring 2025\n\n— Feb. 5\n\n— Feb. 19 (financial aid disbursement for first-time borrowers)\n\n— March 5\n\n— March 19\n\n— April 2 (halfway point for first-time borrowers and/or spring-only borrowers)\n\n— April 16\n\n— April 30\n\nImage\n\nFirst thing's first\n\nAt Central State University, we strive to be a guiding light for students who may not have had the chance to shine in higher education. We support their learning journey inside and outside the classroom through scholarships, guidance on financing their education, and career services in partnership with leading corporations.\n\nAt Central State University, we believe every student deserves the opportunity to achieve their academic goals without worrying about financial burdens. That's why we offer affordable tuition and financial assistance to support your success. Let us help you unlock your potential and reach new heights in your academic journey.\n\nBelow is an overview of scholarships and other types of aid available to Marauders."
