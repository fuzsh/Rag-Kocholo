        "text": "Nearly 2.6 million people, nearly the population of Chicago, legally immigrated to the US in 2022. This exceeded the number of new entries in any year from 2018 to 2021, but just below the recent high of 2.7 million in 2016.\n\nIn FY 2022, Mexicans were the largest share of immigrants coming for work (39%), while Indians were the largest share coming to be with family (24%). India were also the highest percentage of people coming for school (18%).\n\nThe government spent $22.4 billion (about 0.4% of all its spending) on immigration and border security last year. After adjusting for inflation, this was the third-highest spending level since at least 1980.\n\nMore than 2 million immigrants were apprehended illegally entering the US. The remaining 1.1 million were turned away at legal ports of entry by of the Office of Field Operations — more than double the number in FY 2022.\n\nAbout 58% of FY 2022 removals were for criminal offenses, the top three offenses being for immigration, drug, or assault offenses.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has not published new data on unauthorized immigrants since providing these estimates in January 2021.\n\nThe foreign-born share of the population rose from a low of 4.7% in 1970, and although the upward trend is slowing, it is higher than any point since the early 1900s.\n\nAlso, a higher share of immigrants are between 25 and 54 — the ages when people are most likely to be employed. Fifty-five percent of immigrants are in this age group, compared with 36% of native-born people."
