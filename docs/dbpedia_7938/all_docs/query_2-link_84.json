Oregon Territory was organized from the acquired area on August 14, 1848, and included all of present-day Oregon, Idaho, and Washington and part of western Montana and Wyoming. The territory was reduced in 1853 when Washington Territory was organized. In 1859, additional territory was transferred to Washington Territory, leaving Oregon with generally the same boundary as the present state.\n\nCensus data for Oregon are available beginning with the 1850 Census. The 1850 population is for the area in present-day Oregon; it does not include the entire territory as legally established. The population of Oregon Territory as legally constituted in 1850 was 13,294.\n\nData for the legally established state of Oregon are available beginning with the 1860 Census."
