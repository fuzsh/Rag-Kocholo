The Commonwealth is bordered by Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east, while the Appalachian Mountains run through its middle.\n\nPennsylvania is the 33rd-largest state by area, and the 5th-most populous state according to the most recent official U.S. Census count in 2010. It is the 9th-most densely populated of the 50 states. Pennsylvania's two most populous cities are Philadelphia (1,580,863), and Pittsburgh (302,407). The state capital and its 13th-largest city is Harrisburg. Pennsylvania has 140 miles (225 km) of waterfront along Lake Erie and the Delaware River.[7]\n\nThe state is one of the 13 original founding states of the United States; it came into being in 1681 as a result of a royal land grant to William Penn, the son of the state's namesake. Part of Pennsylvania (along the Delaware River), together with the present State of Delaware, had earlier been organized as the Colony of New Sweden. It was the second state to ratify the United States Constitution, on December 12, 1787. Independence Hall, where the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution were drafted, is located in Philadelphia, the state's largest city. During the American Civil War, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in the south central region of the state. Valley Forge near Philadelphia was General Washington's headquarters during the bitter winter of 1777–78.\n\nGeography[]\n\nFurther information: Geography of Pennsylvania and List of counties in Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania is 170 miles (274 km) north to south and 283 miles (455 km) east to west.[8] Of a total 46,055 square miles (119,282 km2), 44,817 square miles (116,075 km2) are land, 490 square miles (1,269 km2) are inland waters, and 749 square miles (1,940 km2) are waters in Lake Erie.[9] It is the 33rd-largest state in the United States.[10] Pennsylvania has 51 miles (82 km)[11] of coastline along Lake Erie and 57 miles (92 km)[7] of shoreline along the Delaware Estuary. Of the original Thirteen Colonies, Pennsylvania is the only state that does not border the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe boundaries of the state are the Mason–Dixon line (39°43' N) to the south, the Twelve-Mile Circle on the Pennsylvania-Delaware border, the Delaware River to the east, 80°31' W to the west and the 42° N to the north, except for a short segment on the western end, where a triangle extends north to Lake Erie.\n\nCities include Philadelphia, Reading, Lebanon and Lancaster in the southeast, Pittsburgh in the southwest, the tri-cities of Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton in the central east (known as the Lehigh Valley). The northeast includes the former anthracite coal mining cities of Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, Nanticoke, and Hazleton. Erie is located in the northwest. State College serves the central region while Williamsport serves the commonwealth's north-central region as does Chambersburg the south-central region, with York, Carlisle, and the state capital Harrisburg on the Susquehanna River in the east-central region of the Commonwealth and Altoona and Johnstown in the west-central region.\n\nThe state has five geographical regions, namely the Allegheny Plateau, Ridge and Valley, Atlantic Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and the Erie Plain.\n\nAdjacent states and province[]\n\nOntario (Province of Canada) (Northwest)\n\nNew York (North and Northeast)\n\nNew Jersey (East and Southeast)\n\nDelaware (Extreme Southeast)\n\nMaryland (South)\n\nWest Virginia (Southwest)\n\nOhio (West)\n\nClimate[]\n\nMain article: Climate of Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania's diverse topography also produces a variety of climates, though the entire state experiences cold winters and humid summers. Straddling two major zones, the majority of the state, except for the southeastern corner, has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa). The southern portion of the state has a humid subtropical climate. The largest city, Philadelphia, has some characteristics of the humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) that covers much of Delaware and Maryland to the south.\n\nSummers are generally hot and humid. Moving toward the mountainous interior of the state, the winter climate becomes colder, the number of cloudy days increases, and snowfall amounts are greater. Western areas of the state, particularly locations near Lake Erie, can receive over 100 inches (250 cm) of snowfall annually, and the entire state receives plentiful precipitation throughout the year. The state may be subject to severe weather from spring through summer into autumn. Tornadoes occur annually in the state, sometimes in large numbers, such as 30 recorded tornadoes in 2011; generally speaking, these tornadoes do not cause significant damage.[12]\n\nMonthly Average High and Low Temperatures For Various Pennsylvania Cities (in °F) City Jan.

New Sweden claimed and, for the most part, controlled the lower Delaware River region (parts of present-day Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) but settled few colonists there.[30][31]\n\nOn March 12, 1664, King Charles II of England gave James, Duke of York a grant that incorporated all lands included in the original Virginia Company of Plymouth Grant plus other lands. This grant was in conflict with the Dutch claim for New Netherland, which included parts of today's Pennsylvania.[32]\n\nOn June 24, 1664, the Duke of York sold the portion of his large grant that included present-day New Jersey to John Berkeley and George Carteret for a proprietary colony. The land was not yet in British possession, but the sale boxed in the portion of New Netherland on the West side of the Delaware River. The British conquest of New Netherland began on August 29, 1664, when New Amsterdam was coerced to surrender while facing cannons on British ships in New York Harbor.[33][34] This conquest continued, and was completed in October 1664, when the British captured Fort Casimir in what today is New Castle, Delaware.\n\nThe Peace of Breda between England, France and the Netherlands confirmed the English conquest on July 21, 1667,[35][36] although there were temporary reversions.\n\nOn September 12, 1672, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch re-conquered New York Colony/New Amsterdam, establishing three County Courts, which went on to become original Counties in present-day Delaware and Pennsylvania. The one that later transferred to Pennsylvania was Upland.[37] This was partially reversed on February 9, 1674, when the Treaty of Westminster ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and reverted all political situations to the status quo ante bellum. The British retained the Dutch Counties with their Dutch names.[38] By June 11, 1674, New York reasserted control over the outlying colonies, including Upland, but the names started to be changed to British names by November 11, 1674.[39] Upland was partitioned on November 12, 1674, producing the general outline of the current border between Pennsylvania and Delaware.[40]\n\nOn February 28, 1681, Charles II granted a land charter[41] to William Penn to repay a debt of £16,000[42] (around £2,100,000 in 2008, adjusting for retail inflation)[43] owed to William's father, Admiral William Penn. This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history.[44] The King named it Pennsylvania (literally \"Penn's Woods\") in honor of Admiral Penn; the Admiral's son who proposed that the land be called New Wales and then, after objections, Sylvania (from the Latin silva: \"forest, woods\"), was embarrassed at the change from the latter proposed form, fearing that people would think he had named it after himself, but King Charles would not rename the grant.[45] Penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the New World: the county commission and freedom of religious conviction.[44]\n\nWhat had been Upland on what became the Pennsylvania side of the Pennsylvania-Delaware Border was renamed as Chester County when Pennsylvania instituted their colonial governments on March 4, 1681.[46][47] The Quaker leader William Penn had signed a peace treaty with Tammany, leader of the Delaware tribe, beginning a long period of friendly relations between the Quakers and the Indians.[48] Additional treaties between Quakers and other tribes followed. The treaty of William Penn was never violated.[49][50][51]\n\n18th century[]\n\nMain articles: French and Indian War, Treaty of Paris (1763), Indian Reserve (1763), Pennsylvania in the American Revolution, First Continental Congress, American Revolutionary War, Second Continental Congress, Lee Resolution, United States Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia campaign, Articles of Confederation § Ratification, Treaty of Paris (1783), Constitutional Convention (United States), Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union\n\nBetween 1730 and when it was shut down by Parliament with the Currency Act of 1764, the Pennsylvania Colony made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and silver. The paper money was called Colonial Scrip. The Colony issued \"bills of credit\", which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status. Since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution, it was an interest-free proposition, largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people. It also promoted general employment and prosperity, since the Government used discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency. Benjamin Franklin had a hand in creating this currency, of which he said its utility was never to be disputed, and it also met with the \"cautious approval\" of Adam Smith.[52]\n\nJames Smith wrote that in 1763, \"the Indians again commenced hostilities, and were busily engaged in killing and scalping the frontier inhabitants in various parts of Pennsylvania.\" Further, \"This state was then a Quaker government, and at the first of this war the frontiers received no assistance from the state.\"[53] The ensuing hostilities became known as Pontiac's War.\n\nAfter the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, Delegate John Dickinson of Philadelphia wrote the Declaration of Rights and Grievances. The Congress was the first meeting of the Thirteen Colonies, called at the request of the Massachusetts Assembly, but only nine colonies sent delegates.[54] Dickinson then wrote Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, To the Inhabitants of the British Colonies, which were published in the Pennsylvania Chronicle between December 2, 1767, and February 15, 1768.[55]\n\nWhen the Founding Fathers of the United States convened in Philadelphia in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress.[56] The Second Continental Congress, which also met in Philadelphia (in May 1775), drew up and signed the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia,[57] but when that city was captured by the British, the Continental Congress escaped westward, meeting at the Lancaster courthouse on Saturday, September 27, 1777, and then to York. There they and its primary author, John Dickinson, drew up the Articles of Confederation that formed 13 independent States[58] into a new union. Later, the Constitution was written, and Philadelphia was once again chosen to be cradle to the new American Union.[59] The Constitution was drafted and signed at the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, and the same building where the Declaration of Independence was signed.[60]\n\nPennsylvania became the first large state, and the second state to ratify the U.S. Constitution on December 12, 1787,[61] five days after Delaware became the first. At the time it was the most ethnically and religiously diverse of the thirteen States. Because one-third of Pennsylvania's population spoke German, the Constitution was presented in German to include those citizens in the discussion. Reverend Frederick Muhlenberg acted as the chairman of the state's ratifying convention.[62]\n\nDickinson College of Carlisle was the first college founded after the States united. Established in 1773, the college was ratified five days after the Treaty of Paris on September 9, 1783. The school was founded by Benjamin Rush and named after John Dickinson.\n\nFor half a century, the Commonwealth's General Assembly (legislature) met at various places in the general Philadelphia area before starting to meet regularly in Independence Hall in Philadelphia for 63 years.[63] But it needed a more central location, as for example the Paxton Boys massacres of 1763 had made the legislature aware. So, in 1799 the General Assembly moved to the Lancaster Courthouse,[63] and finally in 1812 to Harrisburg.[63]\n\n19th century[]\n\nThe General Assembly met in the old Dauphin County Court House until December 1821,[63] when the Federal-style \"Hills Capitol\" (named for its builder, Stephen Hills, a Lancaster architect) was constructed on a hilltop land grant of four acres set aside for a seat of state government by the prescient, entrepreneurial son and namesake of John Harris, Sr., a Yorkshire native who had founded a trading post in 1705 and ferry (1733) on the east shore of the Susquehanna River.[64] The Hills Capitol burned down on February 2, 1897, during a heavy snowstorm, presumably because of a faulty flue.[63]\n\nThe General Assembly met at Grace Methodist Church on State Street (still standing) until a new capitol could be built. Following an architectural selection contest that many alleged had been \"rigged\", Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb was charged with designing and building a replacement building; however, the legislature had little money to allocate to the project, and a roughly finished, somewhat industrial building (the Cobb Capitol) was completed. The General Assembly refused to occupy the building. Political and popular indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted to Pennsylvania architects, and Joseph Miller Huston of Philadelphia was chosen to design the present Pennsylvania State Capitol that incorporated Cobb's building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 1907.[63]\n\nThe new state Capitol drew rave reviews.[63] Its dome was inspired by the domes of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the United States Capitol.[63] President Theodore Roosevelt called it \"the most beautiful state Capital in the nation\" and said, \"It's the handsomest building I ever saw\" at the dedication. In 1989, The New York Times praised it as \"grand, even awesome at moments, but it is also a working building, accessible to citizens ... a building that connects with the reality of daily life\".[63]\n\nJames Buchanan, of Franklin County, the only bachelor president of the United States (1857–1861),[65] was the only one to be born in Pennsylvania. The Battle of Gettysburg—the major turning point of the Civil War—took place near Gettysburg.[66] An estimated 350,000 Pennsylvanians served in the Union Army forces including 8,600 African American military volunteers.\n\nPennsylvania was also the home of the first commercially drilled oil well. In 1859, near Titusville, Pennsylvania, Edwin Drake successfully drilled the well, which led to the first major oil boom in United States history.\n\n20th century[]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Pennsylvania's economy centered on steel production, logging, coal mining, textile production and other forms of industrial manufacturing. A surge in immigration to the U.S. during the late 19th and early 20th centuries provided a steady flow of cheap labor for these industries, which often employed children and people who could not speak English.\n\nIn 1923, President Calvin Coolidge established the Allegheny National Forest under the authority of the Weeks Act of 1911.[67] The forest is located in the northwest part of the state in Elk, Forest, McKean, and Warren Counties for the purposes of timber production and watershed protection in the Allegheny River basin. The Allegheny is the state's only national forest.[68]\n\nThe Three Mile Island accident was the most significant nuclear accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history.[69][70]\n\n21st century[]\n\nUnited Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field near Shanksville during the September 11th attacks, killing 44.\n\nWithin the first half of 2003, the annual Tekko commences in Pittsburgh.[71]\n\nIn October 2018, the Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha Congregation experienced the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.[72]\n\nDemographics[]\n\nFurther information: List of people from Pennsylvania\n\nAs of 2019, Pennsylvania has an estimated population of 12,801,989, which is a decrease of 5,071 from the previous year and an increase of 99,610 since the year 2010. Net migration to other states resulted in a decrease of 27,718, and immigration from other countries resulted in an increase of 127,007. Net migration to the Commonwealth was 98,289. Migration of native Pennsylvanians resulted in a decrease of 100,000 people. From 2008 to 2012, 5.8% of the population was foreign-born.[73]\n\nPlace of origin[]\n\nOf the people residing in Pennsylvania, 74.5% were born in Pennsylvania, 18.4% were born in a different U.S. state, 1.5% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 5.6% were foreign born.[78] Foreign-born Pennsylvanians are largely from Asia (36.0%), Europe (35.9%), and Latin America (30.6%), with the remainder from Africa (5%), North America (3.1%), and Oceania (0.4%).\n\nThe largest ancestry groups are listed below, expressed as a percentage of total people who responded with a particular ancestry for the 2010 census:[79][80]\n\nGerman 28.5%\n\nIrish 18.2%\n\nItalian 12.8%\n\nAfrican American 9.6%\n\nEnglish 8.5%\n\nPolish 7.2%\n\nFrench American 4.2%\n\nRacial breakdown[]\n\nPennsylvania Racial Breakdown of Population Racial composition 1990[81] 2000[82] 2010[83] White 88.5% 85.4% 81.9% Black 9.2% 10.0% 10.9% Asian 1.2% 1.8% 2.8% Native 0.1% 0.1% 0.2% Native Hawaiian and\n\nother Pacific Islander – – – Other race 1.0% 1.5% 2.4% Two or more races – 1.2% 1.9%\n\nAs of 2011, 32.1% of Pennsylvania's population younger than age 1 were minorities.[84]\n\nPennsylvania's Hispanic population grew by 82.6% between 2000 and 2010, making it one of the largest increases in a state's Hispanic population. The significant growth of the Hispanic population is due to immigration to the state mainly from Puerto Rico, which is a US territory, but to a lesser extent from countries such as the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and various Central and South American nations, as well as from the wave of Hispanics leaving New York and New Jersey for safer and more affordable living. The Asian population swelled by almost 60%, which was fueled by Indian, Vietnamese, and Chinese immigration, as well the many Asian transplants moving to Philadelphia from New York. The rapid growth of this community has given Pennsylvania one of the largest Asian populations in the nation by numerical values. The Black and African American population grew by 13%, which was the largest increase in that population amongst the state's peers (New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan). Twelve other states saw decreases in their White populations.[85] The state has a high in-migration of black and Hispanic people from other nearby states, with eastern and south-central portions of the state seeing the bulk of the increases.[86][87]\n\nThe majority of Hispanics in Pennsylvania are of Puerto Rican descent, having one of the largest and fastest-growing Puerto Rican populations in the country.[88][89] Most of the remaining Hispanic population is made up of Mexicans and Dominicans. Most Hispanics are concentrated in Philadelphia, Lehigh Valley and South Central Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's reported population of Hispanics, especially among the Black race, has markedly increased in recent years.[90] The Hispanic population is greatest in Bethlehem, Allentown, Reading, Lancaster, York, and around Philadelphia. It is not clear how much of this change reflects a changing population and how much reflects increased willingness to self-identify minority status. As of 2010, it is estimated that about 85% of all Hispanics in Pennsylvania live within a 150-mile (240 km) radius of Philadelphia, with about 20% living within the city itself.\n\nOf the black population, the vast majority in the state are African American, being descendants of African slaves brought to the US south during the colonial era. There are also a growing number of blacks of West Indian, recent African, and Hispanic origins.[91] Most blacks live in the Philadelphia area, Pittsburgh, and South Central Pennsylvania. Whites make up the majority of Pennsylvania; they are mostly descended from German, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Italian, and English immigrants. Rural portions of South Central Pennsylvania are famous nationwide for their notable Amish communities. The Wyoming Valley, consisting of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, has the highest percentage of white residents of any metropolitan area (with a population of 500,000 or above) in the U.S., with 96.2% of its population claiming to be white with no Hispanic background.\n\nThe center of population of Pennsylvania is located in Perry County, in the borough of Duncannon.[92]\n\nAge and poverty[]\n\nThe state had the fourth-highest proportion of elderly (65+) citizens in 2010—15.4%, as compared to 13.0% nationwide.[93] According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, the state's poverty rate was 12.5% in 2017, compared to 13.4% for the United States as a whole.[94]\n\nHistorical populations Census Pop. %± 1790434,373—1800602,365 38.7%1810810,091 34.5%18201,049,458 29.5%18301,348,233 28.5%18401,724,033 27.9%18502,311,786 34.1%18602,906,215 25.7%18703,521,951 21.2%18804,282,891 21.6%18905,258,113 22.8%19006,302,115 19.9%19107,665,111 21.6%19208,720,017 13.8%19309,631,350 10.5%19409,900,180 2.8%195010,498,012 6.0%196011,319,366 7.8%197011,793,909 4.2%198011,863,895 0.6%199011,881,643 0.1%200012,281,054 3.4%201012,702,379 3.4%Est. 201912,801,989 0.8%Source:\n\n1910–2010[95]\n\n2019 Estimate[96]\n\nPopulation Aged 65 and Older: Top 10 States[93] State % of population Florida 17.3 West Virginia 16.0 Maine 15.9 Pennsylvania 15.4 Iowa 14.9 Montana 14.8 Vermont 14.6 North Dakota 14.5 Rhode Island 14.4 Arkansas 14.4\n\nBirth data[]\n\nNote: Births in table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\n\nLive Births by Single Race/Ethnicity of Mother Race 2013[97] 2014[98] 2015[99] 2016[100] 2017[101] 2018[102] White 109,007 (77.3%) 110,809 (77.9%) 109,595 (77.7%) ... ... ... > Non-Hispanic White 98,751 (70.0%) 99,306 (69.8%) 97,845 (69.4%) 94,520 (67.8%) 92,297 (67.0%) 90,862 (67.0%) Black 24,770 (17.6%) 24,024 (16.9%) 24,100 (17.1%) 18,338 (13.1%) 18,400 (13.4%) 17,779 (13.1%) Asian 6,721 (4.7%) 7,067 (5.0%) 6,961 (4.9%) 6,466 (4.6%) 6,401 (4.6%) 6,207 (4.6%) American Indian 423 (0.3%) 368 (0.3%) 390 (0.3%) 86 (0.1%) 135 (0.1%) 128 (0.1%) Hispanic (of any race) 14,163 (10.1%) 14,496 (10.2%) 14,950 (10.6%) 15,348 (11.0%) 15,840 (11.5%) 15,826 (11.7%) Total Pennsylvania 140,921 (100%) 142,268 (100%) 141,047 (100%) 139,409 (100%) 137,745 (100%) 135,673 (100%)\n\nSince 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin have not been collected, but included in one Hispanic group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\n\nLanguages[]\n\nTop 10 Non-English Languages Spoken in Pennsylvania Language Percentage of population\n\n(as of 2010)[103] Spanish 4.1% German (including Pennsylvania German) 0.9% Chinese (including Mandarin) 0.5% Italian 0.4% French 0.3% Russian 0.3% Vietnamese 0.3% Korean 0.3% Polish 0.2% Arabic 0.2% Hindi 0.2%\n\nAs of 2010, 90.2% (10,710,239) of Pennsylvania residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 4.1% (486,058) spoke Spanish, 0.8% (103,502) German (which includes Pennsylvania Dutch) and 0.5% (56,052) Chinese (which includes Mandarin) of the population over the age of five. In total, 9.9% (1,170,628) of Pennsylvania's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[103]\n\nPennsylvania German language[]\n\nMain article: Pennsylvania German language\n\nPennsylvania German is often—even though misleadingly—called \"Pennsylvania Dutch\". The term Dutch used to mean \"German\"[104] (including the Netherlands), before the Latin name for them replaced it (but stuck with the Netherlands). When referring to the language spoken by the Pennsylvania Dutch people (Pennsylvania German) it means \"German\" or \"Teutonic\" rather than \"Netherlander\". Germans, in their own language, call themselves \"Deutsch\", (Pennsylvania German: \"Deitsch\"). The Pennsylvania German language is a descendant of German, in the West Central German dialect family. It is closest to Palatine German. Pennsylvania German is still very vigorous as a first language among Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites (principally in the Lancaster County area), whereas it is almost extinct as an everyday language outside the plain communities, though a few words have passed into English usage.\n\nReligion[]\n\nOf all the colonies, only Rhode Island had religious freedom as secure as in Pennsylvania.[106] Voltaire, writing of William Penn in 1733, observed: \"The new sovereign also enacted several wise and wholesome laws for his colony, which have remained invariably the same to this day. The chief is, to ill-treat no person on account of religion, and to consider as brethren all those who believe in one God.\"[107] One result of this uncommon freedom was a wide religious diversity, which continues to the present.\n\nPennsylvania's population in 2010 was 12,702,379. Of these, 6,838,440 (53.8%) were estimated to belong to some sort of organized religion. According to the Association of religion data archives (ARDA) at Pennsylvania State University, the largest religions in Pennsylvania by adherents are the Roman Catholic Church with 3,503,028 adherents, the United Methodist Church with 591,734 members, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 501,974 members.\n\nPennsylvania, especially in the west and in the Pittsburgh area, has one of the largest communities of Presbyterians in the nation, being the third highest by percentage of population and the largest outright in membership.[108] The Presbyterian Church (USA), with about 250,000 members and 1,011 congregations, is the largest church, while the Presbyterian Church in America is also significant, with 112 congregations and 23,000 adherents; the EPC has around 50 congregations, as well as the ECO. The fourth-largest Protestant denomination, the United Church of Christ, has 180,000 members and 627 congregations. American Baptist Churches USA (Northern Baptist Convention) is based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\n\nPennsylvania was the center state of the German Reformed denomination from the 1700s.[109] Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is one of the headquarters of the Moravian Church in America. Pennsylvania also has a very large Amish population, second only to Ohio among the states.[110] In the year 2000 there was a total Amish population of 47,860 in Pennsylvania and a further 146,416 Mennonites and 91,200 Brethren. The total Anabapist population including Bruderhof[111] was 232,631, about two percent of the population.[112] While Pennsylvania owes its existence to Quakers, and much of the historic character of the Commonwealth is ideologically rooted in the teachings of the Religious Society of Friends (as they are officially known), practicing Quakers are a small minority of about 10,000 adherents in 2010.[113]\n\nAs of 2014 , the religious affiliations of the people of Pennsylvania are:[105]\n\nChristian 73%\n\nProtestant 47%\n\nMainline Protestant 23%\n\nEvangelical Protestant 19%\n\nBlack Protestant 5%\n\nRoman Catholic 24%\n\nJehovah's Witnesses 1%\n\nOrthodox Christian <1%\n\nNon-religious/Unaffiliated 21%\n\nJudaism 1%\n\nIslam 1%\n\nHinduism 1%\n\nOther 2%\n\nDon't know/Refused to say 1%\n\nAccording to a 2016 Gallup poll, 38% of Pennsylvanians are very religious, 29% are moderately religious, and 34% are non-religious.[114]\n\nEconomy[]\n\nTemplate:Split section\n\nSee also: List of Pennsylvania counties by per capita income and List of Pennsylvania locations by per capita income\n\nPennsylvania's 2018 total gross state product (GSP) of $803 billion ranks the state 6th in the nation.[115] If Pennsylvania were an independent country, its economy would rank as the 19th-largest in the world.[116] On a per-capita basis, Pennsylvania's 2016 per-capita GSP of $50,665 (in chained 2009 dollars) ranks 22nd among the fifty states.[115]\n\nTotal employment 2016\n\n5,354,964\n\nTotal employer establishments\n\n301,484[117]\n\nPhiladelphia in the southeast corner, Pittsburgh in the southwest corner, Erie in the northwest corner, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre in the northeast corner, and Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton in the east central region are urban manufacturing centers. Much of the Commonwealth is rural; this dichotomy affects state politics as well as the state economy.[118] Philadelphia is home to six Fortune 500 companies,[119] with more located in suburbs like King of Prussia; it is a leader in the financial[120] and insurance industry.\n\nPittsburgh is home to eight Fortune 500 companies, including U.S. Steel, PPG Industries, and H.J. Heinz.[119] In all, Pennsylvania is home to fifty Fortune 500 companies.[119] Hershey is home to The Hershey Company, one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world. Erie is also home to GE Transportation, which is the largest producer of train locomotives in the United States.\n\nAs in the US as a whole and in most states, the largest private employer in the Commonwealth is Walmart, followed by the University of Pennsylvania.[121][122] Pennsylvania is also home to the oldest investor-owned utility company in the US, The York Water Company.\n\nAs of May 2020, the state's unemployment rate is 13.1%.[123]\n\nYear 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 GDP in mil.

After a series of mergers, the Bank of North America is part of Wells Fargo, which uses national charter 1.\n\nPennsylvania is also the home to the first nationally chartered bank under the 1863 National Banking Act. That year, the Pittsburgh Savings & Trust Company received a national charter and renamed itself the First National Bank of Pittsburgh as part of the National Banking Act. That bank is still in existence today as PNC Financial Services and remains based in Pittsburgh. PNC is the state's largest bank and the sixth-largest in the United States.\n\nAgriculture[]\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania ranks 19th overall in agricultural production.[127]\n\nThe 1st is mushroom production,\n\nThe 2nd is apples,\n\nThe 3rd is Christmas trees and layer chickens,\n\nThe 4th is nursery and sod, milk, corn for silage, grapes grown (including juice grapes), and horses production.\n\nIt also ranks 8th in the nation in winemaking.[128]\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture worked with private companies to establish \"PA Preferred\" as a way to brand agricultural products grown or made in the state to support and promote Pennsylvania products and locally grown food.[129]\n\nThe financial impact of agriculture in Pennsylvania[130] includes employment of more than 66,800 people employed by the food manufacturing industry; and over $1.7 billion in food product export (in 2011).\n\nGambling[]\n\nMain article: Gambling in Pennsylvania\n\nCasino gambling was legalized in Pennsylvania in 2004. Currently, there are nine casinos across the state with three under construction or in planning. Only horse racing, slot machines and electronic table games were legal in Pennsylvania, although a bill to legalize table games was being negotiated in the fall of 2009.[131] Table games such as poker, roulette, blackjack, and craps were finally approved by the state legislature in January 2010, being signed into law by the Governor on January 7.\n\nFormer Governor Ed Rendell had considered legalizing video poker machines in bars and private clubs in 2009 since an estimated 17,000 operate illegally across the state.[132] Under this plan, any establishment with a liquor license would be allowed up to five machines. All machines would be connected to the state's computer system, like commercial casinos. The state would impose a 50% tax on net gambling revenues, after winning players have been paid, with the remaining 50% going to the establishment owners.\n\nFilm[]\n\nThe Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit began in 2004 and stimulated the development of a film industry in the state.[133]\n\nGovernance[]\n\nPage Template:Multiple image/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nMain article: Government of Pennsylvania\n\nSee also: Commonwealth (U.S. state)\n\nPennsylvania has had five constitutions during its statehood:[134] 1776, 1790, 1838, 1874, and 1968. Before that the province of Pennsylvania was governed for a century by a Frame of Government, of which there were four versions: 1682, 1683, 1696, and 1701.[134] The capital of Pennsylvania is Harrisburg. The legislature meets in the State Capitol there.\n\nExecutive[]\n\nMain article: List of Governors of Pennsylvania\n\nThe current Governor is Tom Wolf. The other elected officials composing the executive branch are the Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, Attorney General Joshua Shapiro, Auditor General Timothy DeFoor, and Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor run as a ticket in the general election and are up for re-election every four years during the midterm elections. The elections for Attorney General, Auditor General, and Treasurer are held every four years coinciding with a Presidential election.[135]\n\nSee also: List of Pennsylvania state agencies\n\nLegislative[]\n\nMain article: Pennsylvania General Assembly\n\nPennsylvania has a bicameral legislature set up by Commonwealth's constitution in 1790. The original Frame of Government of William Penn had a unicameral legislature.[136] The General Assembly includes 50 Senators and 203 Representatives. Joe Scarnati is currently President Pro Tempore of the State Senate, Jake Corman the Majority Leader, and Jay Costa the Minority Leader.[137] Bryan Cutler is Speaker of the House of Representatives, with Kerry A. Benninghoff as Majority Leader and Frank Dermody as Minority Leader.[138] As of the 2018 elections, the Republicans hold the majority in the State House and Senate.\n\nJudiciary[]\n\nMain article: Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania is divided into 60 judicial districts,[139] most of which (except Philadelphia) have magisterial district judges (formerly called district justices and justices of the peace), who preside mainly over preliminary hearings in felony and misdemeanor offenses, all minor (summary) criminal offenses, and small civil claims.[139] Most criminal and civil cases originate in the Courts of Common Pleas, which also serve as appellate courts to the district judges and for local agency decisions.[139] The Superior Court hears all appeals from the Courts of Common Pleas not expressly designated to the Commonwealth Court or Supreme Court. It also has original jurisdiction to review warrants for wiretap surveillance.[139] The Commonwealth Court is limited to appeals from final orders of certain state agencies and certain designated cases from the Courts of Common Pleas.[139] The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is the final appellate court. All judges in Pennsylvania are elected; the chief justice is determined by seniority.[139]\n\nState law enforcement[]\n\nThe Pennsylvania State Police is the chief law enforcement agency in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\nMunicipalities[]\n\nSee also: List of counties in Pennsylvania, List of cities in Pennsylvania, List of towns and boroughs in Pennsylvania, List of townships in Pennsylvania, List of county seats in Pennsylvania (by population), List of census-designated places in Pennsylvania, and List of populated places in Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania is divided into 67 counties.[140] Counties are further subdivided into municipalities that are either incorporated as cities, boroughs, or townships.[141] One county, Philadelphia County, is coterminous with the city of Philadelphia after it was consolidated in 1854. The most populous county in Pennsylvania is Philadelphia, while the least populous is Cameron (5,085).[86]\n\nThere are a total of 56 cities in Pennsylvania, which are classified, by population, as either first-, second-, or third-class cities.[140][142] Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city, has a population of 1,526,006 and is the state's only first-class city.[141] Pittsburgh (305,704) and Scranton (76,089) are second-class and second-class 'A' cities, respectively.[141]\n\nThe rest of the cities, like the third and fourth-largest—Allentown (120,443) and Erie (98,593)—to the smallest—Parker with a population of only 820—are third-class cities.[143] First- and second-class cities are governed by a \"strong mayor\" form of mayor–council government, whereas third-class cities are governed by either a \"weak mayor\" form of government or a council–manager government.[141]\n\nBoroughs are generally smaller than cities, with most Pennsylvania cities having been incorporated as a borough before being incorporated as a city.[141] There are 958 boroughs in Pennsylvania, all of which are governed by the \"weak mayor\" form of mayor-council government.[140][141] The largest borough in Pennsylvania is State College (41,992) and the smallest is Centralia.\n\nTownships are the third type of municipality in Pennsylvania and are classified as either first-class or second-class townships. There are 1,454 second-class townships and 93 first-class townships.[144] Second-class townships can become first-class townships if they have a population density greater than 300 inhabitants per square mile (120/km2) and a referendum is passed supporting the change.[144] Pennsylvania's largest township is Upper Darby Township (82,629), and the smallest is East Keating Township.\n\nThere is one exception to the types of municipalities in Pennsylvania: Bloomsburg was incorporated as a town in 1870 and is, officially, the only town in the state.[145] In 1975, McCandless Township adopted a home-rule charter under the name of \"Town of McCandless\", but is, legally, still a first-class township.[146]\n\nThe total of 56 cities, 958 boroughs, 93 first-class townships, 1,454 second-class townships, and one town (Bloomsburg) is 2,562 municipalities.\n\nSee also: List of municipalities in Pennsylvania\n\nPage Template:Hlist/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").Page Module:Navbar/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"CSS\").\n\nLargest cities or towns in Pennsylvania\n\nSource:[147]\n\nRank County Pop.

It supported the losing candidate in a presidential election only twice from 1932 to 1988, (Herbert Hoover in 1932 and Hubert Humphrey in 1968). Since 1992, Pennsylvania has been trending Democratic in Presidential elections, voting for Bill Clinton twice by large margins, and slightly closer in 2000 for Al Gore. In the 2004 Presidential Election, Senator John F. Kerry beat President George W. Bush in Pennsylvania 2,938,095 (50.92%) to 2,793,847 (48.42%). In the 2008 Presidential Election, Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Pennsylvania, 3,184,778 (54%) to 2,584,088 (44%). Most recently, in the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump became the first Republican candidate to win the state since 1988, winning the state 48.6% to 47.8%.[148] The state, however, returned to the Democratic column in 2020 by narrowly voting for Joe Biden, the winner, over Trump. The state holds 20 electoral votes.[149]\n\nIn recent national elections since 1992, Pennsylvania had leaned for the Democratic Party. The state voted for the Democratic ticket for president in every election between 1992 and 2012. During the 2008 election campaign, a recruitment drive saw registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 1.2 million. However, Pennsylvania has a history of electing Republican senators. From 2009 to 2011, the state was represented by two Democratic senators for the first time since 1947. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a U.S. Senate seat as well as a majority of the state's congressional seats, control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion. Democrats won back the governor's mansion four years later in the 2014 election. It was the first time since a governor became eligible to succeed himself that an incumbent governor had been defeated for reelection.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Political party/D' not found.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Political party/R' not found.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Political party/O' not found.\n\nVoter Registration Totals as of November 5, 2019[150] Party Number of Voters Percentage Democratic 4,059,864 (-51,461) 47.59% Republican 3,245,979 (-24,903) 38.05% Minor parties /\n\nUnaffiliated 1,225,140 (-2,533) 14.36% Total 8,530,983 (-78,897) 100% *Lost between November 6, 2018, and November 5, 2019.\n\nHistorically, Democratic strength was concentrated in Philadelphia in the southeast, the Pittsburgh and Johnstown areas in the southwest, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in the northeast. Republican strength was concentrated in the Philadelphia suburbs, as well as the more rural areas in the central, northeastern, and western portions. The latter counties have long been among the most conservative areas in the nation. Since 1992, however, the Philadelphia suburbs have swung Democratic; the brand of Republicanism there was traditionally a moderate one. The Pittsburgh suburbs, historically a Democratic stronghold, have swung more Republican since the turn of the millennium.\n\nDemocratic political consultant James Carville once pejoratively described Pennsylvania as \"Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west and Alabama in the middle\". Political analysts and editorials refer to central Pennsylvania as the \"T\" in statewide elections. The Three Valleys (Delaware, Lehigh, and Wyoming) and greater Pittsburgh generally vote for Democratic candidates, while the majority of the counties in the central part of the state vote Republican. As a result, maps showing the results of statewide elections invariably form a \"T\" shape.\n\nTaxation[]\n\nPennsylvania had the 15th-highest state and local tax burden in the United States in 2012, according to the Tax Foundation.[151] Residents paid a total of $83.7 billion in state and local taxes with a per capita average of $4,589 annually. Residents share 76% of the total tax burden. Many state politicians have tried to increase the share of taxes paid by out of state sources. Suggested revenue sources include taxing natural gas drilling as Pennsylvania is the only state without such a tax on gas drilling.[152] Additional revenue prospects include trying to place tolls on interstate highways; specifically Interstate 80, which is used heavily by out of state commuters with high maintenance costs.[153]\n\nSales taxes provide 39% of the Commonwealth's revenue; personal income taxes 34%; motor vehicle taxes about 12%, and taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages 5%.[154] The personal income tax is a flat 3.07%. An individual's taxable income is based on the following eight types of income: compensation (salary); interest; dividends; net profits from the operation of a business, profession or farm; net gains or income from the dispositions of property; net gains or income from rents, royalties, patents and copyrights; income derived through estates or trusts; and gambling and lottery winnings (other than Pennsylvania Lottery winnings).[155]\n\nCounties, municipalities, and school districts levy taxes on real estate. In addition, some local bodies assess a wage tax on personal income. Generally, the total wage tax rate is capped at 1% of income but some municipalities with home rule charters may charge more than 1%. Thirty-two of the Commonwealth's sixty-seven counties levy a personal property tax on stocks, bonds, and similar holdings.\n\nWith the exception of the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, municipalities and school districts are allowed to enact a local earned income tax within the purview of Act 32. Residents of these municipalities and school districts are required to file a local income tax return in addition to federal and state returns. This local return is filed with the local income tax collector, a private collection agency (e.g. Berkheimer, Keystone Collections, and Jordan Tax Service) appointed by a particular county to collect the local earned income and local services tax (the latter a flat fee deducted from salaried employees working within a particular municipality or school district).[156][157][158][159]\n\nThe City of Philadelphia has its own local income taxation system. Philadelphia-based employers are required to withhold the Philadelphia wage tax from the salaries of their employees. Residents of Philadelphia working for an employer are not required to file a local return as long as their Philadelphia wage tax is fully withheld by their employer. If their employer does not withhold the Philadelphia wage tax, residents are required to register with the Revenue Department and file an Earnings Tax return. Residents of Philadelphia with self-employment income are required to file a Net Profits Tax (NPT) return, while those with business income from Philadelphia sources are required to obtain a Commercial Activity License (CAL) and pay the Business Income and Receipts Tax (BIRT) and the NPT. Residents with unearned income (except for interest from checking and savings accounts) are required to file and pay the School Income-tax (SIT).[160]\n\nThe complexity of Pennsylvania's local tax filing system has been criticized by experts, who note that the outsourcing of collections to private entities is akin to tax farming and that many new residents are caught off guard and end up facing \"failure to file\" penalties even if they did not owe any tax. Attempts to transfer local income tax collections to the state level (i.e. by having a separate local section on the state income tax return, currently the method used to collect local income taxes in New York, Maryland, Indiana, and Iowa) have been unsuccessful.[161]\n\nFederal representation[]\n\nMain article: Pennsylvania's congressional districts\n\nPennsylvania's two U.S. Senators are Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. and Republican Pat Toomey.\n\nPennsylvania has 18 seats in the United States House of Representatives, as of the 2010 Census.[162]\n\nHealth[]\n\nPennsylvania has a mixed health record, and is ranked as the 29th-overall-healthiest state according to the 2013 United Health Foundation's Health Rankings.[163]\n\nEducation[]\n\nMain article: Education in Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania has 500 public school districts, thousands of private schools, publicly funded colleges and universities, and over 100 private institutions of higher education.\n\nPrimary and secondary education[]\n\nIn general, under state law, school attendance in Pennsylvania is mandatory for a child from the age of 8 until the age of 17, or until graduation from an accredited high school, whichever is earlier.[164] As of 2005, 83.8% of Pennsylvania residents age 18 to 24 have completed high school. Among residents age 25 and over, 86.7% have graduated from high school.\n\nThe following are the four-year graduation rates for students completing high school in 2016:[165]\n\nCohort All Students Male Female White Hispanic Black Asian Special Education % graduating 86.09 84.14 88.13 90.48 72.83 73.22 91.21 74.06\n\nAdditionally, 27.5% have gone on to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher.[166] State students consistently do well in standardized testing. In 2007, Pennsylvania ranked 14th in mathematics, 12th in reading, and 10th in writing for 8th grade students.[167]\n\nIn 1988, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act 169, which allows parents or guardians to homeschool their children as an option for compulsory school attendance. This law specifies the requirements and responsibilities of the parents and the school district where the family lives.[168]\n\nHigher education[]\n\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Pennsylvania\n\nThe Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) is the public university system of the Commonwealth, with 14 state-owned schools. West Chester University has by far the largest student body of the 14 universities. The Commonwealth System of Higher Education is an organizing body of the four state-related schools in Pennsylvania; these schools (Pennsylvania State University, Lincoln University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Temple University) are independent institutions that receive some state funding. There are also 15 publicly funded two-year community colleges and technical schools that are separate from the PASSHE system. Additionally, there are many private two- and four-year technical schools, colleges, and universities.\n\nCarnegie Mellon University, The Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Pittsburgh are members of the Association of American Universities, an invitation-only organization of leading research universities. Lehigh University is a private research university located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania State University is the Commonwealth's land-grant university, Sea Grant College and, Space Grant College. The University of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia, is considered the first university in the United States and established the country's first medical school. The University of Pennsylvania is also the Commonwealth's only, and geographically most southern, Ivy League school. The Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) is a private graduate school of medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy with a main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania, and a branch campus located in Greensburg, Pennsylvania (with two other campuses outside of Pennsylvania). With over 2,200 enrolled medical students, the College of Osteopathic Medicine at LECOM is the largest medical school in the United States.[169][170][171][172] The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts is the first and oldest art school in the United States.[173] Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, now a part of University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, was the first pharmacy school in the United States.[174]\n\nRecreation[]\n\nPennsylvania is home to the nation's first zoo, the Philadelphia Zoo.[175] Other long-accredited AZA zoos include the Erie Zoo and the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium. The Lehigh Valley Zoo and ZOOAMERICA are other notable zoos. The Commonwealth boasts some of the finest museums in the country, including the Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and several others. One unique museum is the Houdini Museum in Scranton, the only building in the world devoted to the legendary magician.[176] Pennsylvania is also home to the National Aviary, located in Pittsburgh.\n\nAll 121 state parks in Pennsylvania feature free admission.\n\nPennsylvania offers a number of notable amusement parks, including Camel Beach, Conneaut Lake Park, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, Dutch Wonderland, DelGrosso's Amusement Park, Hersheypark, Idlewild Park, Kennywood, Knoebels, Lakemont Park, Sandcastle Waterpark, Sesame Place, Great Wolf Lodge and Waldameer Park.

These include Musikfest and NEARfest in Bethlehem, the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Creation Festival, the Great Allentown Fair, and Purple Door.\n\nThere are nearly one million licensed hunters in Pennsylvania. Whitetail deer, black bear, cottontail rabbits, squirrel, turkey, and grouse are common game species. Pennsylvania is considered one of the finest wild turkey hunting states in the Union, alongside Texas and Alabama. Sport hunting in Pennsylvania provides a massive boost for the Commonwealth's economy. A report from The Center for Rural Pennsylvania (a Legislative Agency of the Pennsylvania General Assembly) reported that hunting, fishing, and furtaking generated a total of $9.6 billion statewide.\n\nThe Boone and Crockett Club shows that five of the ten largest (skull size) black bear entries came from the state.[177] The state also has a tied record for the largest hunter shot black bear in the Boone & Crockett books at 733 lb (332 kg) and a skull of 23 3/16 tied with a bear shot in California in 1993.[177] The largest bear ever found dead was in Utah in 1975, and the second-largest was shot by a poacher in the state in 1987.[177] Pennsylvania holds the second-highest number of Boone & Crockett-recorded record black bears at 183, second only to Wisconsin's 299.[177]\n\nTransportation[]\n\nSee also: List of airports in Pennsylvania, List of public transit authorities in Pennsylvania, and List of Pennsylvania railroads\n\nRoad[]\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, abbreviated as PennDOT, owns 39,861 miles (64,150 km) of the 121,770 miles (195,970 km) of roadway in the state, making it the fifth-largest state highway system in the United States.[178] The Pennsylvania Turnpike system is 535 miles (861 km) long, with the mainline portion stretching from Ohio to Philadelphia and New Jersey.[178] It is overseen by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. Another major east–west route is Interstate 80, which runs primarily in the northern tier of the state from Ohio to New Jersey at the Delaware Water Gap. Interstate 90 travels the relatively short distance between Ohio and New York through Erie County, in the extreme northwestern part of the state.\n\nPrimary north–south highways are Interstate 79 from its terminus in Erie through Pittsburgh to West Virginia, Interstate 81 from New York through Scranton, Lackawanna County and Harrisburg to Maryland and Interstate 476, which begins 7 miles (11 km) north of the Delaware border, in Chester, Delaware County and travels 132 miles (212 km) to Clarks Summit, Lackawanna County, where it joins I-81. All but 20 miles (32 km) of I-476 is the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, while the highway south of the mainline of the Pennsylvania Turnpike is officially called the \"Veterans Memorial Highway\", but is commonly referred to by locals as the \"Blue Route\".\n\nRail[]\n\nThe Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) is the sixth-largest transit agency in the United States and operates the commuter, heavy and light rail transit, and transit bus service in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. The Port Authority of Allegheny County is the 25th-largest transit agency and provides transit bus and light rail service in and around Pittsburgh.[179]\n\nIntercity passenger rail transit is provided by Amtrak, with the majority of traffic occurring on the Keystone Service in the high-speed Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station before heading north to New York City, as well as the Northeast Regional providing frequent high-speed service up and down the Northeast Corridor. The Pennsylvanian follows the same route from New York City to Harrisburg, but extends out to Pittsburgh. The Capitol Limited also passes through Pittsburgh, as well as Connellsville, on its way from Chicago to Washington, D.C.[180] Traveling between Chicago and New York City, the Lake Shore Limited passes through Erie once in each direction.[180] There are 67 short-line, freight railroads operating in Pennsylvania, the highest number in any U.S. state.[180]\n\nBus and coach[]\n\nIntercity bus service is provided between cities in Pennsylvania and other major points in the Northeast by Bolt Bus, Fullington Trailways, Greyhound Lines, Martz Trailways, Megabus, OurBus, Trans-Bridge Lines, as well as various Chinatown bus companies.

With the addition of the Philadelphia Union in the MLS, the state now boasts three teams that are eligible to compete for the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup annually. The other two teams are Philadelphia Union II and the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. However, Penn FC (formally Harrisburg City Islanders) used to be one of these teams before they announced they'd be on hiatus in 2019; although they would be returning for the 2020 season.[184] Both of the United Soccer League (USL). Within the American Soccer Pyramid, the MLS takes the first tier, while the USL-2 claims the third tier.\n\nArnold Palmer, one of the 20th century's most notable pro golfers, comes from Latrobe, while Jim Furyk, a current PGA member, grew up near in Lancaster.

The Sturgis Pretzel House introduced the pretzel to America, and companies like Anderson Bakery Company, Intercourse Pretzel Factory, and Snyder's of Hanover are leading manufacturers in the Commonwealth. Two of the three companies that define the U.S. potato chip industry are based in Pennsylvania: Utz Quality Foods, which started making chips in Hanover, Pennsylvania, in 1921, Wise Foods, which started making chips in Berwick in 1921, the third, Frito-Lay (part of PepsiCo, based in Plano, Texas). Other companies such as Herr's Snacks, Martin's Potato Chips, Snyder's of Berlin (not associated with Snyder's of Hanover) and Troyer Farms Potato Products are popular chip manufacturers.\n\nThe U.S. chocolate industry is centered in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with Mars, Godiva, and Wilbur Chocolate Company nearby, and smaller manufacturers such as Asher's[191] in Souderton,[192] and Gertrude Hawk Chocolates of Dunmore. Other notable companies include Just Born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, makers of Hot Tamales, Mike and Ikes, the Easter favorite marshmallow Peeps, and Boyer Brothers of Altoona, Pennsylvania, which is well known for its Mallo Cups. Auntie Anne's Pretzels began as a market-stand in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, and now has corporate headquarters in Lancaster City.[193] Traditional Pennsylvania Dutch foods include chicken potpie, ham potpie, schnitz un knepp (dried apples, ham, and dumplings), fasnachts (raised doughnuts), scrapple, pretzels, bologna, chow-chow, and Shoofly pie.

In Pittsburgh, tomato ketchup was improved by Henry John Heinz from 1876 to the early 20th century. Famous to a lesser extent than Heinz ketchup is the Pittsburgh's Primanti Brothers Restaurant sandwiches, pierogies, and city chicken. Outside of Scranton, in Old Forge there are dozens of Italian restaurants specializing in pizza made unique by thick, light crust and American cheese. Erie also has its share of unique foods, including Greek sauce and sponge candy. Sauerkraut along with pork and mashed potatoes is a common meal on New Year's Day in Pennsylvania.\n\nState symbols[]\n\nMain article: List of Pennsylvania state symbols\n\nMotto: \"Virtue, liberty, and independence\"\n\nTree: Eastern hemlock[194]\n\nState bird: Ruffed grouse[195]\n\nFlower: Mountain laurel[195]\n\nInsect: Pennsylvania firefly[195]\n\nAnimal: White-tailed deer[195]\n\nAmphibian: Eastern Hellbender[196]\n\nDog: Great Dane[195]\n\nFish: Brook trout[195]\n\nFossil: Phacops rana[194]\n\nBeverage: Milk[194]\n\nSong: \"Pennsylvania\"[197]\n\nShip: US Brig Niagara[194]\n\nElectric locomotive: GG1 4859[194]\n\nSteam locomotive: K4s 1361 and K4s 3750[194]\n\nBeautification and conservation plant: Penngift crown vetch[194]\n\nNicknames[]\n\nPennsylvania has been known as the Keystone State since 1802,[198] based in part upon its central location among the original Thirteen Colonies forming the United States, and also in part because of the number of important American documents signed in the state (such as the Declaration of Independence). It was also a keystone state economically, having both the industry common to the North (making such wares as Conestoga wagons and rifles)[199][200] and the agriculture common to the South (producing feed, fiber, food, and tobacco).[201]\n\nAnother one of Pennsylvania's nicknames is the Quaker State; in colonial times, it was known officially as the Quaker Province,[202] in recognition of Quaker[203] William Penn's First Frame of Government[204] constitution for Pennsylvania that guaranteed liberty of conscience. He knew of the hostility[205] Quakers faced when they opposed religious ritual, taking oaths, violence, war and military service, and what they viewed as ostentatious frippery.[206]\n\n\"The Coal State\", \"The Oil State\", \"The Chocolate State\", and \"The Steel State\" were adopted when those were the state's greatest industries.[207]\n\n\"The State of Independence\" currently appears on many road signs entering the state.\n\nNotable people[]\n\nMain article: List of people from Pennsylvania\n\nSister regions[]\n\nMatanzas Province, Cuba[208]\n\nRhône-Alpes, France[209]\n\nSee also[]\n\nPage Module:Portal/styles.css has no content.\n\nOutline of Pennsylvania\n\nIndex of Pennsylvania-related articles\n\nReferences[]\n\nCitations[]\n\nSources[]\n\nWeb sources[]\n\nPage Template:Refbegin/styles.css has no content.\n\nBooks[]\n\nPage Template:Refbegin/styles.css has no content.\n\n[]\n\nLua error in Module:Sister_project_links at line 367: attempt to index field 'wikibase' (a nil value).\n\nPennsylvania at Curlie\n\nGov.
