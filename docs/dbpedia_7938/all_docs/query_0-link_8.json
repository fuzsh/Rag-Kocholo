        "text": "The first (and last) U.S. states\n\nThe original 13 colonies were a group of British territories in North America. Among the Thirteen colonies, Virginia was the first to be settled by English people. Depending on how we define \"states\" in this instance, the first state to create its own constitution was Connecticut. The first state to be settled by Europeans at all would be Florida; St. Augustine, Florida is the oldest continuous European settlement in the U.S.\n\nHowever, the states of today are legally distinct from the colonies. The first state in the sense of \"one of the current 50 states of America\" would be the first one to enter into the Union by adopting the U.S. Constitution.\n\nReplacing the Articles of Confederation\n\nMany people mistakenly believe that the United States Constitution was created after the Revolution. But, the country was first governed under the Articles of Confederation, drafted in 1781 (the same year as Yorktown). The Articles proved insufficient to meet the challenges the country faced. Legislators met to discuss revisions to the Articles, but the representatives decided that it would be better to replace them entirely with a new document. That document became the Constitution, the details of which were hammered out at the Constitutional Convention.\n\nTo adopt the Constitution as the new law of the land, it had to be ratified by 2/3 of the states in the Confederation (as per its own Article VII). Ratification required that each state elect representatives to a ratification convention within the state\n\nThe American states assumed their present forms in 1788, when the ninth and final necessary state ratified the United States Constitution. The date each state joined the Union is shown in the table below (usually coinciding with a territory being granted statehood). Five states were added during the 20th century. Alaska and Hawaii were the last states to join the Union -- both in 1959.\n\nJoining the Union\n\nArticle 4, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution lays out how a new state can join the Union:\n\nNew States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.\n\nState Entered Union Year Settled Delaware Dec. 7, 1787 1638 Pennsylvania Dec. 12, 1787 1682 New Jersey Dec. 18, 1787 1660 Georgia Jan. 2, 1788 1733 Connecticut Jan. 9, 1788 1634 Massachusetts Feb. 6, 1788 1620 Maryland Apr. 28, 1788 1634 South Carolina May 23, 1788 1670 New Hampshire June 21, 1788 1623 Virginia June 25, 1788 1607 New York July 26, 1788 1614 North Carolina Nov. 21, 1789 1660 Rhode Island May 29, 1790 1636 Vermont Mar. 4, 1791 1724 Kentucky June 1, 1792 1774 Tennessee June 1, 1796 1769 Ohio Mar. 1, 1803 1788 Louisiana Apr. 30, 1812 1699 Indiana Dec. 11, 1816 1733 Mississippi Dec. 10, 1817 1699 Illinois Dec. 3, 1818 1720 Alabama Dec. 14, 1819 1702 Maine Mar. 15, 1820 1624 Missouri Aug. 10, 1821 1735 Arkansas June 15, 1836 1686 Michigan Jan. 26, 1837 1668 Florida Mar. 3, 1845 1565 Texas Dec. 29, 1845 1682 Iowa Dec. 28, 1846 1788 Wisconsin May 29, 1848 1766 California Sept. 9, 1850 1769 Minnesota May 11, 1858 1805 Oregon Feb. 14, 1859 1811 Kansas Jan. 29, 1861 1727 West Virginia June 20, 1863 1727 Nevada Oct. 31, 1864 1849 Nebraska Mar. 1, 1867 1823 Colorado Aug. 1, 1876 1858 North Dakota Nov. 2, 1889 1812 South Dakota Nov. 2, 1889 1859 Montana Nov. 8, 1889 1809 Washington Nov. 11, 1889 1811 Idaho July 3, 1890 1842 Wyoming July 10, 1890 1834 Utah Jan. 4, 1896 1847 Oklahoma Nov. 16, 1907 1889 New Mexico Jan. 6, 1912 1610 Arizona Feb. 14, 1912 1776 Alaska Jan. 3, 1959 1784 Hawaii Aug. 21, 1959 1820\n\nYou May Also Be Searching For\n\nLargest States in the U.S. by Area\n\nState Capitals and Largest Cities\n\nU.S. History Timeline\n\nPresidents of the Continental Congresses History of the American Flag"
