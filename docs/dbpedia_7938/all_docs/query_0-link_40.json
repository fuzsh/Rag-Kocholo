        "text": "The Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States, on November 15, 1777, but the states did not ratify them until March 1, 1781. The Articles created a loose confederation of sovereign states and a weak central government, leaving most of the power with the state governments. Once peace removed the rationale of wartime necessity the weaknesses of the 1777 Articles of Confederation became increasingly apparent. Divisions among the states and even local rebellions threatened to destroy the fruits of the Revolution. Nationalists, led by James Madison, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Wilson, almost immediately began working toward strengthening the federal government. They turned a series of regional commercial conferences into a national constitutional convention at Philadelphia in 1787.\n\n“An opinion begins to prevail that a general convention for revising the articles of Confederation would be expedient.”\n\nJohn Jay to George Washington, March 16, 1786\n\nBenjamin Franklinâs Proposed Plan of Confederation, 1775\n\nShortly after the revolutionary war began at Concord and Lexington, Benjamin Franklin submitted this plan for a united colonial confederation or American republic to the Continental Congress on July 21, 1775.\n\nThomas Jefferson, a fellow delegate, annotated his copy of Franklinâs plan, which began a national debate on the creation of an American Republic.\n\nBenjamin Franklin.

Nearly four years would pass before all thirteen states had ratified the document—Maryland being the last to ratify on March 1, 1781—and it was put into action. The Articles provided for a one-house legislature, a weak executive, no national power of taxation, a lack of standard currency, and voting by state—flaws that would eventually lead to its failure.\n\nUnited States Continental Congress.

Samuel Johnston had declined the presidency when elected. When the first Confederation Congress met on November 5, 1781, it elected John Hanson (1715–1783), delegate from Maryland, as its president. In this letter, Charles Thomson (1729–1824), secretary of Congress, informs George Washington of Hansonâs election. According to the Articles, the president of the Congress presided only over Congress; George Washington, chosen after the ratification of the Federal Constitution, was the first president of the United States.\n\nLetter from Charles Thomson to George Washington, November 5, 1781.

A minimum of five territories or states were to be created. Each was to have a republican government with an executive, legislative council (upper house), assembly, and judiciary. Not only was the territory north and west of the Ohio River to be settled by Americans and admitted into full statehood in the union, but the Ordinance stipulated that those territories would be free from slavery or involuntary servitude and have a bill of rights.\n\nUnited States Continental Congress.

Madison wondered if Washington should hold off on his appearance until some progress had been made, suggesting that Benjamin Franklin might provide “sufficient dignity into the Chair” of the convention until the proper time. Washington had left Virginia by the time Edmund Randolph received this letter and arrived in Philadelphia in time to help Madison and other members of the Virginia delegation to draft a proposed plan of government, known as the “Virginia Plan.”\n\nLetter from James Madison to Edmund Randolph, April 15, 1787.

These notes, called “Continentals,” had no backing in gold or silver, but were instead backed by the “anticipation” of tax revenues. Easily counterfeited and without solid backing, the notes quickly lost their value, so that the term “not worth a Continental” became common slang. After the war Congress and the state governments continued to produce money contributing to what Madison referred to as the “mortal diseases” of the government under the Articles of Confederation and resulting in calls for a new federal constitution to strengthen the national government.\n\n1 of 6\n\nUnited States Continental Congress.

In his letter to Nathan Dane (1752–1835), a Massachusetts delegate to the Confederation Congress and architect of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, King correctly predicted that any new government would be less republican and that the larger states would want more control of the new government. The Massachusetts delegates refused to submit the request to Congress or to the other states.\n\nLetter from Rufus King to Nathan Dane, September 17, 1785. Manuscript.
