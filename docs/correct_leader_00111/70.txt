[N1] Bruno served in the Belgium.army. He was also a carpenter.

[N2] In Belgium, Achille was a carpenter. He built Windmills and Houses. Achille came to America in 1907 at the age of 23 years to work in East Moline, Illinois. Achille came to America in 1907 to work in East Moline, Illinois. He came to New York on 13 April 1907 on board the ship SS Zeeland arriving from Antwerp. During this time, he was joined his brother, Romain DeClerck, who was living at 107 - 5th Avenue, Moline, Illinois, and had come to America earlier. It was Romain who encouraged Achille to come to America, the land of opportunity. He has listed as 23 years of age from Klerken, Belgium, in the New York Passenger Record.

In Sepember 1907, Achille was joined by his sister Zuma DeClerck and her husband Achil DeCoene. Sometime in the 1907 - 1908 time period Achille DeClerck and Achil DeCoene jointly built the house at 1428 - 15th Avenue in East Moline. It was a four square two story type house similar to houses that can ge seen today along the Belgium - French Normandy coast. Both Achille and Achil were carpenters and built many four square "Nomandy" house in and around East Moline and Watertown (as it was known in those days). From about 1908 to 1911, Achille was living with his sister and his brother-in-law.

He most likely was working for the Union Malleable Company in Moline as Molder duiring the time period of 1907 to about 1910.

Achille later found a better paying job at the Marseilles Company, a company that Deere and Comapany had acquired in 1910. The company manufactured shellers and grain elevators. When work at the Marseilles Company slowed down in 1910-1911, Achille returned to Klerken, Belgium, to find a wife.

After his arrival in Belgium in February 1911, he met Emericus Alfons Robaeys who was a Leather Crafter and whose wife, Maria, managed a small cafe in the town of Zarren. Palmyra was working at the cafe. Emericus introduced her to Achille and he began to court her, mainly by showing off. Once he grabbed the end of a wind mill and went completely around full circle to impress her. She thought that he was very foolish. Nevertheless, she married him on March 15, 1911, at Klerken, West Flanders, Belgium.

On July 29, 1911, they left the Belgium port of Antwerp on the Red Star Line Ship, SS Lapland, bound for America. They arrived in New York battery area on August 7, 1911. Palmyra ate her first banna here and could barely finish it. They avoided the Ellis Island Inspection procedure because they travelled first class. The next day they took a train to East Moline, arriving there about August 9th.

The couple stayed with Zulma and Achil DeCoene. They lived on the first floor of the home.

He returned to his old job at the Marseilles Company in 1911. He worked there for 8 or 9 years. The Tax Law of 1919 which would have resulted in double taxes on Deere and Company forced the company to reorganize its operations. It was probably because of this that Achille was transferred to the John Deere Plow Works in Moline, Illinois, in 1919. At the Plow Works, he was a molder and poured iron for the casting of parts. Achille became instrumental in helping Deere develop parts of steel (or nodular iron) before Engineering as we know it became a profession in the farm implement business. His 'black art" knowledge helped Deere develope their casting technology.

In 1919, the DeCoene's sold their house to Achille and Palymra because they wanted to farm in the Jessup, Iowa area. Later, in the 1920's, the DeCoene family retuned to Belgium and suffered later during World War II.

Achille bought a new Dodge on credit in 1929, just before te start of the Great Depression. Achille wanted to learn how to drive, but it was Omer that actually did the driving. Work at the Plow Works slowed down starting in 1930 and Achille was laide off and recalled a number of times up to the 1937 time period. During this time he worked as a carpenter if work was availble.

During 1930-1934 time period, the family bought their groceries from "Dekeere's Grocery Store located on the corner of 17th Avenue and 14th Street. The owner was a happy small bald headed man with a reddish face. He was also a butcher. But during the early years of the depression, Achille family was forced to buy food on credit and was in debt for $800. Gus was forced to sue the family for their home. However, Omer was able to get the government to stop the law suit and in turn the government required that Achille paid Gus of $11 per month. Omer became the "bread winner" during these difficult times. He found a job at Vic Vanwinterham Dairy Farm. By using the Dodge to drive out to the farm, he was able to bring home money for the family. With Omer's income, they were are to pay off the debt to Gus. Gus and the DeClerck family remined friends inspite of the Depression problems. Gus often said that the DeClerlk's were his best customers and his best friends. In 1950, Gus met Gene DeClerck while he was serving in Germany. He took Gene and they toured around Germany at Gus' expense. When Darrel Hagberg was a little boy in the early 1950's, his mother would send him to Dekeere's corner grocercy store to pick up lunch meat, milk, bread, and eggs. He was always warmly greeted by Gus, the jolly old man. Darrel remembers that Gus had a lot ajoining the grocery store where Gus had chickens and fresh eggs for his customers.

Achille DeClerck turned the organ to play the dance music of the Dance Hall above the old Majestic Theater, in East Moline, from 1915 to 1925. He also raced pigons as a hobby and had a pigon coup at his home at 1428-15th Avenue, East Moline, IL., from 1915 to the early 1950's. He also enjoyed Rolle Bolle but only during the early years after his arrival in America

He retired from John Deere Plow Works in 1948 at the age of 65 years.

He died at his home on 07 June 1955 of stomach cancer after a one year illness. He was 5 foot - 4 inhes in height and had blue eyes and black hair. He wore eye glasses all of his life and had a "Harry Truman" look.

It should be noted that Achille's family lived at many different locations in East Moline, Illinois, from 1911 to1919:

1911-1915: They lived at 1428-15th Avenue with the Zuma ans Achil DeCoene. Omer and Laura were born in this house.

1915-1917 : They lived in a home on the south side (hill side) of 17th Avenue between 9th and 10th Street. Helen and Angela were born at this location.

1917-1918: They lived in a Union Malleable Iron Works single story house on the east side of 13th Street, the second house from the north RR tracks, In 1918, Laura was run over by Poolvelde (a butcher who was intoxicated while delivering meat) in front of the Union Malleable while calling for Omer. A man by the name of Dobblaere picked her up and gave her to her mother, Palmyra. She was 4 years old, but survived. The car jumped the curb and struck her. She was laid up for 4 months with a broken hip and arm.

1918-1919: Because their family was growing, they moved into a Union Malleable Iron Works two story house on the east side of 13th Street, about one block south from the intersection with19th Street in Watertown. It was here that Frank was born.

1919-1980: They purchased the DeCoene house at 1428-15th Avenue in 1919 and lived there until Angela died there in 1980. Donald and Eugene were born here. Palmyra moved in with Helen from 1980 until her death in 1982.

Both Achille De Clerck and Palmyra Robaeys names are shown on the Wall Of Honor at Ellis Island, Panel Number 594 (see the internet: http://wwww.wallofhonor.com/family/).

[N4] Zulma DeClerck and her husband Achil DeCoene immigrated to America in 1907. They left Antwerp on September 14, 1907, on the SS Vaderland, and arriving in New York on September 24, 1907.

When Archil and Zulma first arrived in Illinois in 1907, they had a small room in a boarding house located at Bluff Road and 10th Street in Moline.

Achil DeCoene had a job working for John Deere at the Union Malleable Foundry Works in East Moline, Illinois. They built a new home at 1428-15th Avenue, East Moline, Illinois, with the help of Zulma's brother in 1908, Archille DeClerck The home was located 2 blocks from the foundry. In 1910-11, Zulma's brother, Achille DeClerck, stayed with them while he worked at John Deere. In 1911, Achille DeClerck returned to Belgium and married Palmyra Robaeys. They immigrated to America in 1912, and lived with the DeCoene's for awhile.

Before 1914, the DeCoene's sold their house to Achille and Palmyra DeClerck and they moved to a farm near Barstow, Illinois. In 1916, Zulma's sister Eliza died and they raised her daughter, Gabriella Houvenaghel, who was 6 years old at the time. Prior to 1917 Achil and Zulma DeCoene moved to another farm near Jessup, Iowa. About 1919, the family was farming near Independence, Iowa. Achil DeCoene was homesick for Belgium and the family returned there in1924. Gabriella Houvenaghel stayed behind in America.

Here is the Families Travel Schedule (according to Mary DeCoene's Notes):

31 Dec 1923 - 1 Jan 1924 They left their old farm in Iowa for Illinois.

1 Jan 1924 - 14 Jan 1924 Stayed in Illinois, then travelled to New York City (Probably stayed with brother Achille DeClerck for a few days).

14 Jan 1924 - 16 Jan 1924 Stayed in New York Hotel

16 Jan 1924 Departed New York Harbor

27 Jan 1924 Arrived Antwerp, Belgium

Return voyage: New York, Plymouth, Cherbourg, Antwerp.

Zulma's Godfather was her uncle, Henricus DeClerck. She lived to be to 99 years old. Darrel, Betty, & Darla Hagberg met Zulma in July 1983.

[N5] About 1907, Eliza emigrated to the United States with her husband. They traveled on the Red Star Line. She died young in 1915 and is buried in St. Mary's Cemetary in East Moline, Illinois. Her sister raise her daughter, Gabriella from the age of 6 to the age of 13 after that she stayed with her father.

Eliza died of alcoholism.

[N6] Palmyra was born 11 May 1893, in Paachendale, West Flanders, Belgium. Paachendale was the seen of very fierce fighting in World War I (called Passion-dale by the many British troops who fought there). The town was completely destroyed during 4 years on fighting and today it is surrounded by many cemeteries for the war dead. There are several spelling variations of Passendale. They are; Paaschendaele, Paachendale, Paasendale, and Passendale

The family later lived in Zarren where her father and mother, Ermeric and Maria, ran a small cafe. Palmyra and her sisters worked for her parents in the cafe at the time Achille's return visit to Belgium from his job in America.

Emericus introduced Palymra to Achille and he began to court her, mainly by showing off. Once he grabbed the end of a wind mill and went completely around full circle to impress her. She thought that he was very foolish. Nevertheless, she married him on March 15, 1911, at Klerken, West Flanders, Belgium, Achille's home in Belgium

On July 29, 1911, they left the Belgium port of Antwerp on the Red Star Line Ship, SS Lapland, bound for America. They travelled in first class unlike many of the other immigrants travelling to America. Palmyra remember the crossing. She said the food was great and they dined with many weathly people. In the evenings, she enjoying dancing, and was often invited to dance by many of the the other male first class passengers. During the last part of the crossing, the S.S. Lapland ran into a very bad storm and the passengers were requested to stay in their rooms, She became very sea sick and frightened.

She remembered that there were many poor Polish immigrants that traveled in third class. They looked very poor and sad. Conditions in Third Class were very much difference the in First Class in these and she thought it must have been a difficult passage for them.

They arrived in New York battery area on August 7, 1911. Palmyra ate her first banana here and could barely finish it. They were immediately taken to Ellis Island for inspection. After passing inspection, they took a train to East Moline, the next day, arriving there about August 9 th.

They stayed with the DeCoene's and Achille returned to his job at John Deere. Later, they purchased this home from them and lived there all of their lives.

Palmyra was a house wife all of her life. She liked dancing and plays card games with her sisters. When Television came to her town in the early 1950's, she enjoyed watching the Arthur Goffery Show. She suffered in the 1920's from depression brought on in part by the lost of her father, Emeric. She always felt partly responsible for his death, because she had encouraged her father to rescue her mother and siblinmgs from the war in Europe. She travelled to Rock Island by Electric Trolley from her home in East Moline, then by ferry boat to Davenport, Iowa, where she received help for her depression. Laura DeClerck, her eldest daughter, related this story to Darrel Hagberg in 2010: "My mother suffered for many years with depression afhter the death of her father Emeric. One morning in 1926, I found my mother hanging from a ceiling lamp cord in her bedroom. Even though I was 12 at the time, I managed to cut her down using a knife. I laid her on the bed and she was still breathing. I called the factory where my father was working. He called the doctorr and he found that my mother would be OK."

The Great Depression of the 1930's made a lasting negative impression on her because of the many difficulties that her family endured during this time period. She spoke of it almost daily through the 1940's up through the 1960's. According to Darrrel Hagberg, as a small child, he would listened to her many sad depression stories which often ended with tears in her eyes.

She mainly spoke the Old Flemish much of her life, but was also able to speak broken English up to her death. She alway read the newspaper in English.

Omer and Leona enjoyed dances at the Belgium-American Brotherhood Club in Rock Island, Illinois, and it was there that the two first met. They began dating, and by the time they were both in their late twenties, they decided to marry. Although Alois and Leontina held no personal animosity toward Omer and believed he was a good person, they were very upset to learn of the coupleâs marriage plans and expressed their disapproval. They had assumed that since Leona was already age 29, she would remain single and continue to live with them. Troubled by her parents reaction, Leona sought the counsel of her Pastor. He reasoned that one day her parents would be dead, and asked her what she would do with her life then. He encouraged Leona to accept Omerâs marriage proposal and begin a life and family with him. And so, on February 11, 1939, Omer and Leona were married in the side chapel at Davenport Cathedral with only their witnesses present.

The first year of their marriage, the couple rented a room in a house not far from Leonaâs parents, so that she could continue to care for her mother. At one point, Omer and Leona asked her parents to consider purchasing a side-by-side duplex with them. With her parents living next door, it would be much easier for Leona and Omer to provide care and assistance for Leontina. It seemed like a very logical and practical solution, however, they rejected the idea. Leona continued to provide care for her mother until the birth of her first child a year later. When the couple moved to East Moline, Leonaâs parents hired someone from their neighborhood to assume the caretaker role for Leontina. Eventually, the disappointment and hurt feelings between the parents and daughter were resolved, and their love and family bond remained strong throughout their lives.

Omer and Leona moved into their Deere-built Malleable duplex at 1356 13th Street, East Moline, shortly before World War II. These rental units were built to provide John Deere employees with a decent place to live, at a reasonable, low monthly rent. The company maintained the homes well, and every few years, they would paint or wallpaper the rooms as per the tenants preference. Each duplex had its own small backyard, and located behind these yards was a large area of land subdivided into smaller plots where the tenants could plant their own vegetable garden.

These homes were located in a two block area across from the John Deere Malleable Works on 13th Street, East Moline. They were built by the company to provide their employees with a decent place to live at a low, reasonable rent. Each side of the 3-room duplex had a livingroom, single bedroom, kitchen, base-ment with toilet and shower, and front and back porches. Most of the small backyards were fenced off, and some tenants, like our family, had garages. The area across the alley from the backyards were divided into individual plots so the tenants could plant vegetable gardens.

Omerâs hobby was raising and racing homing pigeons, so he built a coup above his garage, as did a few other Belgian men in the neighborhood. The neighbors were from various ethnic backgrounds, but many were Belgian. It was not unusual to hear them converse back and forth between the Flemish and English languages. They believed in learning English, but if they didnât want their children to know what they were saying, they would switch back to their native tongue!

Omer, Leona and their three daughters lived in their duplex until Deere decided to dispose of the homes and clear the area for their distribution building in 1956.

In 1956, after what seemed like an endless search, Omer and Leona purchased their first home located at 118 - 5th Street, in Silvis. The house was a âfixer upper,â but with Omerâs hard work and Leonaâs decorating touch, they turned their modest abode into an attractive, comfortable home for their family. This was a 2-bedroom house that also included a livingroom, kitchen, and enclosed back porch on the main level. A staircase led up to an unfinished walk-in attic. The unfinished basement was divided into three separate rooms; a main room, a laundry/ bath area, and a pantry/storage room. Originally, the backyard was a jungle of grape vines, which Omer tore out. It took between 10-12 truckloads of dirt to fill in the backyard and make it level. At this time, Omer owned a Hudson âWaspâ with stick shift. After getting her learners permit, Omer would take Jeanne out in this car to practice her driving.

Omer and Leonaâs next door neighbors at 116 - 5th Street, were Julian and Mary Tuytten. They were an older, childless, Belgian couple, and the neighbors quickly became friends. Over the years, the DeClerck family came to think of the Tuyttens as an extension of their family. When Julian suffered a stroke that left him unable to walk, Omer and Leona helped Mary in caring for her husband until his death. In the early 70's Mary died, and the DeClercks were surprised to learn that she had left her house to them. Julia Staut, Leonaâs sister, rented that home for awhile, but when the upkeep of both homes became too much for them, Omer and Leona sold their house and moved in with Julia. Julia died in 1983 and Leona in 1991. One year after Leonaâs death, Omer sold his house and moved to Moline to live with his widowed sister Helen. He lived there for 4 years.

Jeannie DeClerk letter to Darrel Hagberg, dated 6 January 2008:

My father's main hobby was his racing pigeons. I think he did sometimes play rolle boley, but don't remember seeing a bowling disc (if that's what you call it) that he owned laying about the house. I'm not sure what became of his pigeon clock. He may have given it to one of his racing friends after he gave up the sport. That would have been neat to have as a souvenier! As for my mother, she was always so busy with household chores and cooking that I really don't recall any hobbies per se. When we still lived on 13th Street, E.M., I remember her having a sewing machine and making some of our clothes. Mostly, I remember her getting frustrated because the thread would keep breaking and she'd have a heck of a time trying to re-thread the needle or bobbin. Eventually, she gave that up!

She enjoyed decorating and trying out new trends. I think she was one of the first in the Malleable houses to stencil a border on the walls of a room. I think we also had a pink kitchen at one time!!!! She loved music and was a faithful listener of "The Buddies Of The Airlane's Show," which was broadcast locally each day from a radio station in Rock Island.

The band consisted of three guys, who sang western music. I believe their names were Curly, Speed, and Patrick. One time she took Mary Ann & me for a visit to the station and we got an autographed photo of them. I also remember listening to Don McNeil's Breakfast Club, which was broadcast from The Tip Top Room of the Allerton Hotel in downtown Chicago. At some point Don would have everyone dance around the breakfast table, and I remember dancing around our kitchen table. She also listened to some of those old radio shows (usually while ironing or cooking) like Fibber Mcgee & Molly, Father Knows Best, etc. After Julie was born we got a TV, and I Love Lucy, Ed Sullivan Show, and Your Hit Parade were all favorites of hers. I was interested in drawing as a child, and I remember my mom showing me how to draw a person's eyes. My parents both loved to dance and they would take us with them to the dances at the East End Club. Their favorite dance was the waltz, and their favorite song was The Blue Skirt Waltz. I loved watching them out on the dance floor! Oh, my dad loved to read books, especially westerns (Louie La'Mour (sp ?) & Zane Grey). Aunts Laura & Helen said that even as a young boy, my dad would be tucked in a corner reading. That is about all I can recall about my parents interests.

[N8] Laura was born at her parent's home at 1428-15th Avenue, East Moline, Illinois USA.

Laura worked for John Deere Malleable Works, East Moline, Il.

She was preceded in death by her parents, husband, stepson, Richard Lee Waem; sisters, Helena Vermuelen, and Angela Hagberg; brothers, Omer, Frank, Donald, and Eugene DeClerck.

[N9] In 1934, Angela nearly died when her appendix burst. She was 17 years old and was given the "Last Rites" of the Catholic Church. Her stomach was left open for several days to allow the infection to drain. She survived.

Angela attended St. Mary's Grade School, East Moline, IL, and graduated from the 8th grade in 1931. She never attended high school.

She married Charles DePaepe on April 30, 1938, in East Moline. They lived in an upstairs appartment at her father and mother's home at 1428-15th Avenue, East Moline, IL

In 1940 after Charles died, she worked at John Deere Malleable Works, East Moline, IL, as a casting sorter.

In 1942, she met Raymond Hagberg at a Dance at the East End Club in Moline, IL. She left her job at the Malleable Works in 1942 before her marriage to Raymond in December. Again they lived in the upstairs appartment at her father and mother's home at 1428-15th Avenue, East Moline, IL.

At the time of his marriage to Angela, Raymond was working with his Mother at the Eagle Lunch Restaurant in Moline, IL. After the war broke out on December 7, 1941, Raymond tried to join the Army, but was declared a 4-F because of his poor eye-sight and flat feet and was not eligble for military service. Early in 1942, He went to work for the War effort at John Deere Harvester Works in East Moline, IL. The factory had re-tooled to manufacture tail assemblies for Army Scout Planes.

Raymond worked at John Deere Harvester Works until 1947 after which time he returned to re-join his mother in the restaurant business in Moline at the Eagle Lunch.

In 1955, the family moved to their new home at 1912-30th Street in Moline.

In the early 1950's, the family never went on long vacation but did go for short trips to Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri and the Wisconsin Dells. Most vacation time was spent at home. Small day trips to the Amana Colonies in Iowa or to Raymond boyhood home in Owen, Wisconsin were taken. Raymond liked fishing and would take his boys to Alexander, Minneasota, for 5-6 day trip. They visited cousins Lossie and Carrie Rose and stayed at their cabin on Lake Alexander.

Angela and Raymond managed the Eagle Lunch restaurant, Moline, IL, from 1954-1957. In 1958, Angela and Raymond separated. She and the childern moved back to live with her mother in East Moline. They were divorved in 1962.

Because Angela had contacted Rhumatic Fever in her childhood, developed heart valve problems in 1953 at the age of 36. She was one of the first persons in the world to have a heart valve replacement and later heart pacemaker, all of which was experimental at the time. She had numerous experimental heart surgeries and valve replacements at the University of Illinois Medical hospital in Chicago, IL, over many years. Doctor Levine at the University called her the "Iron Lady" and said that her sacrifices over many years help pave the way for modern open heart surgery techiques. She was an inspiration to all those who knew her for her courage inspite of her suffering over many years.

History of the 30th infantry division of 9th Army (called Old Hickory) in World War II

After training in the United States for just over two years, the 30th Infantry Division, under the command of Major General Leland Hobbs, arrived in England, 22 February 1944, and trained for the Allied invasion of Normandy until June.[5]

It landed at Omaha Beach, Normandy, on 11 June 1944, five days after the initial D-Day landings of 6 June 1944, secured the Vire-et-Taute Canal, crossed the Vire River on 7 July.[6] Beginning on 25 July, the 30th Division spearheaded the Saint-LÃ´ break-through of Operation Cobra, which was intended to break out of the Normandy beachhead, thus ending the stalemate that had occurred.

During the battle of Mortain, Typhoons devastated German tank and mechanized columns attempting to reach the French coast, 7 August 1944.

During the operation, on both 24 and 25 July, the 30th Division encountered a devastating friendly fire incident. As part of the effort to break out of the Normandy hedgerows, US Army Air Force (USAAF) bombers from England were sent to carpet bomb a one-by-three mile corridor of the German defenses opposite the American line. However, USAAF planners, in complete disregard or lack of understanding of their role in supporting the ground attack, loaded the heavy B-24 Liberator and B-17 Flying Fortress bombers with 500-pound bombs, destroying roads and bridges and complicating movement through the corridor, instead of lighter 100-pound bombs intended as antipersonnel devices against German defenders. Air planners switched the approach of attack by 90 degrees without informing ground commanders, thus a landmark road to guide the bombers to the bombing zone was miscommunicated as the point to begin the bombing run. Start point confusion was further compounded by red smoke signals that suddenly blew in the wrong direction, and bombs began falling on the heads of the American soldiers. There were over 100 friendly fire casualties over the two days, including Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces.

The division relieved the veteran 1st Infantry Division near Mortain on 6 August.[7] The German drive to Avranches began shortly after. The 30th Division clashed with the elite 1st SS Panzer Division, and fierce fighting in place with all available personnel broke out. The division frustrated enemy plans and broke the spearhead of the enemy assault in a violent struggle from 7-12 August. After the liberation of Paris, the division drove east through Belgium, crossing the Meuse River at VisÃ© and LiÃ¨ge on 10 September. Elements of the division entered the Netherlands on 12 September, and Maastricht fell the next day. Moving into Germany and taking up positions along the Wurm River, the 30th Division launched its attack on the heavily defended city of Aachen on 2 October 1944, and succeeded in contacting the 1st Division on 16 October, resulting in the encirclement and takeover of Aachen.

Men of the 117th Infantry Regiment, part of the 30th Infantry Division, move past a destroyed American M5 "Stuart" tank on their march to capture the town of St. Vith at the close of the Battle of the Bulge, January 1945.

After a rest period, the 30th Division eliminated an enemy salient northeast of Aachen on 16 November, pushed through Alsdorf to the Inde River on 28 November, and then moved to rest areas. On 17 December the division rushed south to the Malmedy-Stavelot area to help block the powerful enemy drive in the Battle of the Bulge-the Germans's last attempt to win a decisive victory over the Western Allies. Again the division met the 1st SS Division, and again broke the spearhead of their assault. The 30th Division launched a counterattack on 13 January 1945 and reached a point 2 miles south of St. Vith, Belgium on 26 January, before leaving the battle and moving to an assembly area near Lierneux on 27 January, and to another near Aachen to prepare for attack deeper into the western edge of Germany at the Roer River. The Roer was crossed on 23 February 1945, near JÃ¼lich.

The 30th moved back for training and rehabilitation on 3 March, and on 24 March made its assault crossing of the Rhine. It pursued the enemy across Germany, mopping up enemy pockets of resistance, took Hamelin on 7 April, Braunschweig on 12 April, and helped to reduce Magdeburg on 17 April. The Russians were contacted at Grunewald on the Elbe River. The end of World War II in Europe came soon afterwards and, after a short occupation period, the 30th Division began its return to the United States, arriving on 19 August 1945. The surrender of Japan followed soon, which brought the war to an end.

[N11] Donald was a supervisor at Deere and Company, Moline, IL.

Don joined the Navy in World War II after high school in 1943. He served on board the USS Tennessee. Off Okanawa, during an attack, He went to his battle station in his shoes and underwear. While feeding ammunition to an anti-aircraft gun, he was wounded in the head and leg when a Japanese kamakaze crashed into the ship. His friend, the gunner from Philadelphiia, was killed in the action when the plane hit the the AA gun. To escape the flames he ran through the Mess Deck and hit his head on the Door Hatch cutting it open. He saw many dead in the Mess Deck. He was 17 years old at the time.

[N18] Darrel was born at Moline Public Hospital, Moline, Illinois.

Darrel lived at 1428 15th Avenue, East Moline, Illinois, and attended grade school at St. Maryâs Catholic School. In the summer of 1956, the family moved to 1912 30th Street, Moline, Illinois. While living in Moline, Darrel attended Calvin Coolidge Junior High School and Moline Senior High School. In the summer of 1960, Darrel's parents were divorced. Darrel moved back to the same address in East Moline with his mother.

As a boy, Darrel held several jobs. He passed newspapers for the Moline Daily Dispatch, the Des Moines Sunday Register, and the East Moline Herald while living in East Moline. After moving to Moline in 1956, Darrel worked at his father's restaurant, the Eagle Lunch Restaurant in Moline which was located on the NE corner of 6th Avenue and 14th Street. From 1961 to 1962, Darrel worked for his aunt, Laura DeHaven, at the Eagle Dinner Restaurant which was located on the East side of 16th Street between 5th Avenue and 6th Avenue in Moline.

In 1962, he worked at the Buddy L Company and the John Deere Malleable Works in East Moline to earn money to go to college. Later, in 1962, he took employment with Montgomery Elevator Company (now Koen) in Moline, Illinois. While there, he started as a layout draftsman. He also worked in the estimating department and research and development department. Before leaving the company in 1966, he was assistant project engineer for their new elevator test tower. He worked elevator designs for the Seattle World's Fair, the Apollo 11 Moon Mission, and the St. Louis Gateway Arch.

Betty was working for her Masters degree at Illinois State University in Bloomington. In July 1967, they were engaged to be married. The marriage date was originally set for February 1968 but was moved ahead to November 25, 1967, because Darrel received a military draft notification for December 1967. They were married at Wesley Methodist Church, Moline, Illinois. During the period from June 1967 to February 1968, Darrel had accepted an Engineering position at ALCOA (Aluminum Company of America), Davenport Works, located Bettendorf, Iowa. This factory is the world's largest Aircraft Aluminum Plant. In addition to Aircraft metal, the plant produced many other products. Betty taught Geography in the Fall at Rock Island High School.

Moline loses 'an original baseball guy' in DeClerck

Updated Oct 16, 2016

MOLINE -- To get the varsity program where he wanted it to go, former Moline baseball coach Derek Lindauer understood it would take "some type of unification" within the youth organization.

Greg DeClerck helped provide some.

Two years into Lindauer's longtime coaching tenure, DeClerck was part of a group that created the Moline Blackhawks baseball program in 1995. The youth team, originally for 13- and 14-year-old players, served as a feeder unit and also bridged the gap between Little League and high-school baseball.

Not long after the Blackhawks started, the Maroons turned into a consistent winner.

"He was a thinker who tried to get all the kids to play together," Lindauer said of DeClerck, 60, who succumbed to cancer on Sept. 30. "It was quite an undertaking."

The first year featured teams playing on a patch of land off John Deere Road. Twenty-one years later, the program consists of five age groups.

Countless players who helped Moline win 12 Western Big 6 Conference championships, 14 regional plaques, six sectionals and two state trophies since 1995 got their start with the Blackhawks. Alumni include Matt Brill and Dakota Bacus, who both were selected in the Major League Baseball Draft.

Their first exposure to travel baseball and high-profile tournaments came with the Blackhawks.

"It was a foundation of teamwork," said Brill, a 2013 Moline graduate who now is an Appalachian State redshirt junior. "There were a lot of great things I took away from the Blackhawks."

DeClerck helped start the program a year before his only son, Derek, was old enough to play in it. The goals were creating Moline's first baseball feeder program and getting youth players more exposure by playing under one banner.

One of the rules was no parent being the head coach if their son was on the team. Brill said it was "politics-free baseball" for kids who wanted to one day play for Moline.

As soon as the Blackhawks started, a blueprint for the varsity baseball program was set.

"The foundation of any program is the youth level," current Moline baseball coach Craig Schimmel said. "The more kids you get playing, the better chance you have to get good players."

The program cultivated quite a few good ones.

"That's the thing that probably got the (Moline) baseball program in the right direction," Lindauer said. "There was a need for a uniform program. It sure did help.

"Back when it was as strong as it could be, there wasn't anything better. Moline had such a jump on people because they had things organized down below."

No other Big 6 baseball program has more league titles, regional championships and sectional crowns since the Blackhawks started than Moline. In the last 21 years, the Maroons have eight more conference championships than any other league rival.

Players who wore the uniform also helped Moline Post 246 twice reach the American Legion World Series since 2010 and were part of its Junior Legion state championship team this summer.

"Greg's only goal from the time I met him was the success of others," Post 246 coach and Moline assistant Jim Zacharewicz said. "Greg always seemed to be efforting in a way to help others be the best they could be regardless of circumstances. That not only came from a leadership perspective, but on a personal level as well."

Credit that success to a youth program started by a person who wanted to see Moline baseball thrive. Rarely does Moline not have a championship-caliber team at any level.

"In the beginning, he was instrumental on what took place," Lindauer said. "Greg was an original baseball guy. There aren't too many of them left."

The program tragically lost a baseball advocate to a five-month stomach cancer battle. DeClerck's lasting legacy is being a founding father of a baseball program that will continue making an impact on local diamonds.

"If you want to be successful, you need people like him," Schimmel said. "He had a true passion for the program. Those are the type of people who make the program the way it is."

Moline baseball is thankful for that.
