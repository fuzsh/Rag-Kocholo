The photos above are taken from the Belgian Official First Day Covers.\n\nAuguste Marie Fran√ßois Beernaert (1829-1912) received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1909. He was a Lawyer, but he became a politician early on and was Prime Minister and Minister of Finance 1884-1894. He was also a member of the International Court of Justice in the Hague.\n\nHenri La Fontaine (1854-1943) received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1913. He had also been a lawyer before he became a politician, and he was professor of international law in Brussels for a time. From 1907 until his death he was President of the International Peace Bureau. During 1920-1921 La Fontaine was the Belgian representative in the League of Nations.\n\nOfficial Belgian First Day Covers, cancelled 30th September 1999, at Bruphila'99 in Brussels, at the same time commemorating the 150th anniversary of Belgian Postage Stamps.\n\nThere exists a number of other items about this issue, for instance a Belgian First Day Sheet, showing both of the Belgian stamps. The most interesting item, however, seems to be a Joint Issue First Day Sheet, carrying both stamps from both countries. The sheet is shown below. The original sheet is in A5-format.\n\nFront and back of the First Day Sheet, showing both the Belgian and Swedish stamps. The back shows the skyline of Stockholm, and the Tower of the City Hall, and mentions further that two laureates received their prizes in 1909 and 1913, respectively. The text on the backside is written in Flemish and French.\n\nAbove are shown a print of the similar Swedish stamps (1999) together with a copy of the Swedish FDC. The cancellation shows a portrait of Alfred Nobel.\n\nNavigation (in separate window) Homepage Cz.Slania's Engravings Search Google"
