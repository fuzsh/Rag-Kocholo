        "text": "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2019 in recognition of his efforts to end his country's long-running border conflict with Eritrea.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Institute on Friday also praised the \"important reforms\" that Abiy, Ethiopia's leader since April 2018, has launched at home.\n\nChairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said some people may consider it too early to give him the prize, but \"it is now that Abiy Ahmed's efforts need recognition and deserve encouragement.\"\n\nAbiy, 43, took office after widespread protests pressured the longtime ruling coalition and hurt one of the world's fastest growing economies. Africa's youngest leader quickly announced dramatic reforms and \"Abiymania\" began.\n\nIn a move that caused surprise in the long-turbulent Horn of Africa region, he said Ethiopia would accept a peace agreement with Eritrea, ending one of Africa's longest-running conflicts.\n\nWithin weeks, Eritrea's longtime leader, visibly moved, visited Addis Ababa and communications and transport links were restored. For the first time in two decades people could, long-divided families made tearful reunions.\n\nThe improving relations led to the lifting of United Nations sanctions on Eritrea, one of the world's most reclusive nations. But Ethiopia's reforms appear not to have inspired any in Eritrea, which has since closed border posts with its neighbor.\n\nAt home, Abiy offered one political surprise after another. He released tens of thousands of prisoners, welcomed home once-banned opposition groups and acknowledged past abuses. People expressed themselves freely on social media, and he announced that Ethiopia would hold free and fair elections in 2020. The country has one of the world's few \"gender-balanced\" Cabinets and a female president, a rarity in Africa.\n\nAnd for the first time Ethiopia had no journalists in prison, media groups noted last year.\n\nThe new prime minister also announced the opening-up of Ethiopia's tightly controlled economy, saying private investment would be welcome in major state-owned sectors â€” a process that continues slowly.\n\nBut while Abiy became a global darling, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, troubles arose at home.\n\nA grenade was thrown at him during an appearance in the capital. A large group of soldiers confronted him in his office in what he called an attempt to derail his reforms. In a display of the brio that has won Abiy widespread admiration, the former military officer defused the situation by dropping to the floor and joining the troops in push-ups.\n\nMore troubling these days are Ethiopia's rising ethnic tensions, as people once stifled by repression now act on long-held grievances. Some 1,200 people have been killed and some 1.2 million displaced in the greatest challenge yet to Abiy's rule. Some observers warn that the unrest will grow ahead of next year's election.\n\nAbiy had been among the favorites for this year's prize in the run-up to Friday's announcement, though winners are notoriously hard to predict. The Nobel committee doesn't reveal the names of candidates or nominations for 50 years.\n\nThe following is a list of Nobel Peace Prize laureates since the prize was first awarded in 1901.\n\n2019 - Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali\n\n2018 - Congolese physician Denis Mukwege and Yezidi activist Nadia Murad\n\n2017 - International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons\n\n2016 - Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos\n\n2015 - The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet\n\n2014 - Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi\n\n2013 - Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\n\n2012 - European Union\n\n2011 - Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkul Karman\n\n2010 - Liu Xiaobo\n\n2009 - Barack Obama\n\n2008 - Martti Ahtisaari\n\n2007 - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore\n\n2006 - Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank\n\n2005 - International Atomic Energy Agency and Mohamed ElBaradei\n\n2004 - Wangari Maathai\n\n2003 - Shirin Ebadi\n\n2002 - Jimmy Carter\n\n2001 - United Nations and Kofi Annan\n\n2000 - Kim Dae Jung\n\n1999 - Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)\n\n1998 - John Hume and David Trimble\n\n1997 - International Campaign to Ban Landmines and Jody Williams\n\n1996 - Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta\n\n1995 - Joseph Rotblat and Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs\n\n1994 - Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin\n\n1993 - Nelson Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk\n\n1992 - Rigoberta Menchu\n\n1991 - Aung San Suu Kyi\n\n1990 - Mikhail Gorbachev\n\n1989 - Dalai Lama\n\n1988 - U.N. peacekeeping forces\n\n1987 - Oscar Arias Sanchez\n\n1986 - Elie Wiesel\n\n1985 - International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War\n\n1984 - Desmond Tutu\n\n1983 - Lech Walesa\n\n1982 - Alva Myrdal and Alfonso Garcia Robles\n\n1981 - Office of the U.N.
