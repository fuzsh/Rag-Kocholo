        "text": "Rulers\n\nIndex Bb-Bh\n\nBbumba, Syda (Namirembe) (b. Jan. 7, 1953), finance minister of Uganda (2009-11). She was also minister of economic monitoring (1996-99), energy and mineral development (1999-2006), and gender, labour, and social development (2006-09, 2011-12).\n\nBeaconsfield\n\nBeaconsfield, Benjamin Disraeli, (1st) Earl of, Viscount Hughenden of Hughenden, byname Dizzy (b. Dec. 21, 1804, London, England - d. April 19, 1881, London), British prime minister (1868, 1874-80). He was born into a Jewish family but was baptized at age 12 when his father left Judaism. In 1837, he entered Parliament as a Conservative. His maiden speech in the House of Commons was a failure, but before long, he became a speaker who commanded attention. The Conservative leader, Sir Robert Peel, encouraged Disraeli, but when in 1841 the Conservatives won the election and Peel became prime minister, Disraeli was not given office in the cabinet. His attitude toward Peel and his brand of Conservatism became increasingly critical. Disraeli consolidated the opposition to Peel in a series of brilliant speeches. Peel was forced to resign in 1846. When the Whig government fell in 1852 and the Earl of Derby, leader of the Conservative Party, formed a short-lived minority government, Disraeli was chancellor of the exchequer. In 1865 Derby formed his third minority government with Disraeli again as chancellor of the exchequer. In 1868 when Derby retired from politics, Disraeli became prime minister. The government was only a caretaker one, for the general election awaited only the completion of a new electoral register, and later in 1868 the Liberals won. The Conservatives won a resounding victory in 1874 and he became prime minister again. By 1876 his poor health had made leading the Commons onerous, so he accepted a peerage, taking the title Earl of Beaconsfield, and became leader in the House of Lords. He was also lord privy seal (1876-78). In 1878 Queen Victoria offered him a dukedom, which he refused, and the Order of the Garter, which he accepted. The Conservatives were heavily defeated in the general election of 1880.\n\nBeadon, Sir Cecil (b. Dec. 22, 1816 - d. July 18, 1880, Latton, Wiltshire, England), lieutenant governor of Bengal (1862-67); knighted 1866.\n\nBeadon, Henry Cecil (b. Nov. 28, 1869, India - d. July 4, 1959), chief commissioner of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (1920-23).\n\nBeahan, Michael (Eamon) (b. Jan. 21, 1937, London, England - d. Jan. 30, 2022, Melbourne, Vic.), Australian politician. He was president of the Senate (1994-96).\n\nBeal Benedico, Josep Maria (b. June 9, 1942, Barcelona, Spain - d. Nov. 23, 2019, Escaldes-Engordany, Andorra), first syndic of Andorra (1990-91). He was also mayor of Escaldes-Engordany (1984-90).\n\nBeale, Edward Fitzgerald, byname Ned Beale (b. Feb. 4, 1822, Washington, D.C. - d. April 22, 1893, Washington), U.S. diplomat. He was minister to Austria-Hungary (1876-77).\n\nBeale, John Joseph (b. March 28, 1934), administrator of Ascension (1989-91).\n\nBeale, Truxtun (b. March 6, 1856, San Francisco, Calif. - d. June 2, 1936, Annapolis, Md.), U.S. diplomat; son of Edward Fitzgerald Beale; son-in-law of James G. Blaine. He was minister resident to Persia (1891-92) and Greece (1892-93).\n\nBeame\n\nBeame, Abraham D(avid), original surname Birnbaum (b. March 20, 1906, London, England - d. Feb. 10, 2001, New York City), mayor of New York City (1974-78). He came to the United States in 1907. He held many posts in city government, including assistant budget director under Mayor William O'Dwyer, budget director under Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri, and city comptroller in 1962. After an unsuccessful mayoral bid in 1965, he ran successfully for comptroller in 1969. He ran again for mayor in 1973, winning by almost 700,000 votes. He became the city's first Jewish mayor. He served through the darkest days of the city's 1975 fiscal crisis. It began when banks refused to buy city notes because the city could not provide enough information about uncollected real estate taxes. Before it was over, municipal job rolls, salaries, and services were cut and a mountain of debt was made manageable by a complex partnership of union pension funds, banks, and the state and federal governments. His administration will always be remembered as the time the bill came due for decades of profligate government. He spent his last years defending his reputation from those who said he was a bean-counter who couldn't count - a man who, as city budget director, comptroller, and finally as mayor, failed to prevent a fiscal catastrophe. In his own defense, he said he had warned for years against accounting gimmicks that hid the city's true financial condition and against using capital funds for day-to-day expenses. He said he cut 60,000 city jobs. At crunch time in 1975, he raised the transit fare from 35 to 50 cents, closed firehouses, and imposed tuition on what had been a free City University. Beame's hopes of a second term were dashed by his third-place finish, behind Ed Koch and Mario Cuomo, in a 6-candidate Democratic primary.\n\nBeardsley, William S(hane) (b. May 17, 1901, Beacon, Iowa - d. [automobile accident] Nov. 21, 1954, north of Des Moines, Iowa), governor of Iowa (1949-54).\n\nD.M. Beasley\n\nBeasley, David M(uldrow) (b. Feb. 26, 1957, Lamar, S.C.), governor of South Carolina (1995-99). A Democrat turned Republican, Beasley was elected to the state House in 1978 at age 20 and served 14 years, rising to majority leader and becoming chairman of the Education and Public Works Committee. In 1992, he resigned to run for governor, with covert support (dictated by party decorum) from Gov. Carroll Campbell and open support from the Christian right. In the Republican primary, Beasley faced flamboyant Charleston Congressman Arthur Ravenel and former Congressman Tommy Hartnett. Beasley made no secret that he had a born-again religious experience in 1984, and got attention when a Democrat joked that he had two skills needed by a Republican, how to handle snakes and speak in tongues. But this was an asset in a state where 55% of Beasley's voters identified themselves as supporting his religious views. In a Republican primary, Beasley won 47% to 32% for Ravenel and 21% for Hartnett; among Democrats, Nick A. Theodore had 49.6% to 38% for Charleston Mayor Joe Riley, Jr. Beasley won his runoff 58%-42%, while Theodore finished only microscopically ahead of Riley in the Democratic runoff. The general election in November 1994 was a battle between the affable, mature Theodore and the fervent, young Beasley. Beasley won by a 50%-48% margin. Theodore carried 92% of blacks, Beasley 80% of the white religious right. In office, Beasley called for state term limits and unfunded mandate laws, property tax cuts, efforts to encourage small business job creation and encouragement of exports, a work requirement and two-year limit for welfare, and tougher prison sentences. In 1998 he was defeated for reelection by Democrat Jim Hodges. In 2017 he became executive director of the World Food Programme.\n\nBeasley, Jere (Locke) (b. Dec. 12, 1935, Tyler, Texas), acting governor of Alabama (1972).\n\nBeasley, John Albert (b. Nov. 9, 1895, Werribee, Vic. - d. Sept. 2, 1949, Sydney, N.S.W.), defence minister of Australia (1945-46). He was also minister of supply and development (1941-42) and supply and shipping (1942-45) and high commissioner to the United Kingdom (1946-49).\n\nBeassoumal, Nadjita (Yonhombel), defense minister of Chad (1991-92). He was also minister of information (1990-91), posts (1992-93), and justice (1997-98).\n\nBeath, Lance (Alexander) (d. Aug. 1, 2021), New Zealand representative in the Cook Islands (1985-87).\n\nBeatrix\n\nBeatrix (Wilhelmina Armgard) (b. Jan. 31, 1938, Soestdijk palace, Baarn, Utrecht province, Netherlands), queen of the Netherlands (1980-2013). She was the eldest of four daughters born to Princess (later Queen) Juliana and Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. When the Germans overran the Netherlands in World War II, the royal family in May 1940 took refuge in England. Princess Juliana and her daughters Beatrix and Irene then went to Ottawa. After the German surrender the family returned to the Netherlands in August 1945. When Juliana ascended the throne in 1948, Princess Beatrix received the title of heiress presumptive. From 1956 to 1961 she attended the State University of Leiden, studying mainly social sciences, law, and history. On June 28, 1965, Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard announced the engagement of Beatrix to a West German diplomat, Claus George Willem Otto Frederik Geert von Amsberg (b. Sept. 6, 1926, Dotzingen, northern Germany - d. Oct. 6, 2002, Amsterdam), causing a national furor because of his past membership in the Hitler Youth and the German army, even though he had been cleared by an Allied court. On March 10, 1966, they were married, and the hostility apparently dimmed with the births of Willem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand (April 27, 1967, Utrecht), Johan Friso Bernhard Christiaan David (Sept. 25, 1968, Utrecht), and Constantijn Christof Frederik Aschwin (Oct. 11, 1969, Utrecht), the first male heirs in the House of Orange since 1890. (Johan Friso was excluded from the succession due to a controversial marriage announced in 2003.) Beatrix ascended the throne in 1980 when Queen Juliana abdicated. She was particularly interested in sculpture, painting, ballet, and music and regularly visited exhibitions and attended performances. She abdicated after exactly 33 years on the throne.\n\nBeattie, Alexander Elder (b. Jan. 25, 1888, Stirling, Scotland - d. April 14, 1951, Gibraltar), administrator of Saint Vincent (1941-44).\n\nBeattie, Sir David Stuart (b. Feb. 29, 1924, Sydney, N.S.W. - d. Feb. 4, 2001, Wellington, N.Z.), governor-general of New Zealand (1980-85); knighted 1980.\n\nP. Beattie\n\nBeattie, Peter (Douglas) (b. Nov. 18, 1952, Sydney, N.S.W.), premier of Queensland (1998-2007).\n\nBeatty\n\nBeatty, (Henry) Perrin (b. June 1, 1950, Toronto, Ont.), Canadian solicitor general (1985-86, 1988-89) and minister of national revenue (1984-85), defense (1986-89), national health and welfare (1989-91), communications (1991-93), and external affairs and Francophonie (1993).\n\nBeau, (Jean Baptiste) Paul (b. Jan. 25, 1857, Bordeaux, France - d. Feb. 14, 1927, Paris, France), governor-general of French Indochina (1902-08).

He held the seat of Swan in every subsequent election up to and including 1993, moving to the seat of Brand in 1996. His ministerial career began on March 11, 1983, in the first Bob Hawke government, when he became minister for aviation and minister assisting the minister for defence. He was the youngest member of the ministry at the time of his appointments. On Dec. 13, 1984, Beazley became the youngest ever Australian defence minister. He also served as special minister of state from July 14, 1983, to Jan. 21, 1984.

Aug. 13, 1913, Passugg, Graubünden, Switzerland), German politician. He joined the Leipzig Workers' Educational Association in 1861 and became its chairman in 1865. Wilhelm Liebknecht became in many respects Bebel's mentor. In 1867 Bebel entered the constituent Reichstag of the North German Confederation as a member for the Sächsische Volkspartei (Saxon People's Party). This and other like-minded parties united in 1869 in the Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei (Social Democratic Labour Party) of Germany. Already in 1867, Bebel had protested against the Bismarckian \"greater Prussia,\" believing that it meant \"turning Germany into one great barracks.\" In parliament he continued this protest both before and after the founding of the German Empire. He and Liebknecht were the only voices to speak against the war loan voted in the Reichstag on July 21, 1870; as a result, they were brought to trial on a charge of high treason at Leipzig in March 1872. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment; beginning with an earlier sentence in 1869, Bebel spent a total of nearly five years in prison within less than 20 years, though he never faced any graver charge than that of \"spreading doctrines dangerous to the state,\" \"lèse-majesté,\" \"libel of Bismarck,\" or \"libel of the Bundesrat.\" His book Die Frau und der Sozialismus (1883; Woman and Socialism, 1904), was the most powerful piece of Social Democratic propaganda for decades. Bebel, a member of the Reichstag from 1867 almost continuously until his death, was able to keep the Social Democratic Party united at nearly all times and saw its representation increase to over 100 deputies.\n\nBebic, Luka (b.

Oct. 4, 1894, Warsaw, Poland, Russian Empire - d. June 6, 1944, Stanesti, Romania), foreign minister of Poland (1932-39). He joined Józef Pilsudski's legion in the Austrian service in World War I and fought for the Central Powers against tsarist Russia. When Pilsudski disbanded his legion in anger over the abuse of Polish territory by the Austrian and German authorities, he joined the POW, a secret group. After the Russian Revolution this society organized the Poles against Prussia and Austria. In 1918 he was sent to Russia, where, using an assumed name, he posed as a captured Austrian officer and was placed in charge of a Red Army regiment containing many Poles. During his short tenure he issued many passes enabling the Poles to escape and was himself on the way back to Poland when the secret police unmasked his activities. He reached Poland safely and Pilsudski, hearing of his exploits, named him his personal aide. In 1922 he became military attaché to the Polish legation in Paris, but within a year he was obliged to return to Poland by the advent to power of an anti-Pilsudski government. He returned to power in 1926 when he became Pilsudski's chef de cabinet in the Ministry of War. He was elevated to vice premier in 1930 and became foreign minister on Nov. 2, 1932. He attempted to maintain a non-threatening attitude toward both the Soviet Union and Germany while strengthening alliances of Poland with France and with Romania. After the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Beck gained the disputed Teschen area for his country and on April 6 signed the alliance with Great Britain that was to bring Britain into World War II after the Germans invaded Poland in September of that same year.

He was ambassador to the United States (1961-66) and Canada (1963-66), economy and finance minister (1966-77), and president of the National Assembly (1980-93) and by virtue of the latter position succeeded Pres. Félix Houphouët-Boigny after his death. He is from the Baoule ethnic group to which Houphouët-Boigny belonged and which had dominated Ivory Coast's politics since independence from France in 1960. He continued the successful economic policies of his predecessor, but took a hardline approach towards an increasingly restive opposition. On the eve of the 1995 elections, he ordered riot police to suppress all protesters. He further strengthened his political dominance by having the National Assembly pass strict residency laws stipulating that presidential candidates must have two parents who are citizens of Côte d'Ivoire. His leading rival, Alassane Ouattara, was thus rendered ineligible. In light of these machinations, the opposition largely boycotted the elections, which Bédié won resoundingly. In 1998 he had the assembly pass a law extending his term in office from five to seven years and also allowing him to postpone future elections if political instability threatened. Deposed in a 1999 coup, he fled to Togo on December 26 and then to France on Jan. 3, 2000. He briefly came back on Oct. 15, 2001, to take part in a national reconciliation forum but left after its end. He returned from his exile on Sept. 11, 2005, to organize his presidential campaign.

He was again a candidate in 2020 but received only 2% of the vote after joining an opposition boycott of the election.\n\nBédier (de Prairie), (Philippe Marie) Achille (b.

He was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Deputies in 1873 and became minister of public works in Jules Malou's conservative Catholic cabinet. In the next five years he proved to be an able and energetic administrator. He improved the country's rail, canal, and road systems, established new port facilities at Ostend and Antwerp, and beautified the capital, but he failed in his attempt to end child labour in the mines. In June 1874 he lost a contest for a seat in the Senate but three months later won an election in the West Flanders town of Thielt, a constituency which reelected him until his death. When the Catholic Party, defeated in 1878, was returned to power in 1884, Beernaert was named minister of agriculture, industry, and public works in the new cabinet. Four months later, after some resignations from the cabinet, King Leopold II entrusted Beernaert with the direction of the government.

Begin\n\nBegin, Benny, byname of Ze'ev Binyamin Begin (b. March 1, 1943, Jerusalem), Israeli politician; son of Menachem Begin. He became the champion of Israel's ultranationalist right wing. He believed no peace with Palestinian president Yasir Arafat was possible and that Arafat's real intention was to destroy the Jewish state. Viewed as the Likud party's chief ideologue, he spoke in the courtly cadences of his father. In 1996-97 he was science minister. He broke away from Likud to mount his own challenge to Benjamin Netanyahu in 1999. He headed a bloc of hawks sworn to stop territorial concessions to the Palestinians. Begin saw few differences between Netanyahu and his centre-left rivals, saying all are willing to surrender land while pledging peace with security. While he knew he would most likely be knocked out of the race for prime minister (and he withdrew before the first round), he expected his rightist faction winning upwards of 10 seats in the 120-member parliament; when it only won 3, he said he would quit politics. Begin was regarded by friend and foe as courteous and as principled as he is ideologically rigid. Returning to Likud in 2008, he became a minister without portfolio (2009-13, 2015). He joined the New Hope party in 2021, but left politics again in 2022.\n\nBegin, Charles Auguste Frédéric (b. July 2, 1835, Marie-Galante island, Guadeloupe - d.

Aug. 16, 1913, Brest-Litovsk, Russia [now Brest, Belarus] - d. March 9, 1992, Tel Aviv, Israel), prime minister of Israel (1977-83). He was active in the Zionist movement throughout the 1930s and in 1938 became the leader of the Polish branch of the Betar youth movement, dedicated to the establishment of a Jewish state on both sides of the Jordan River. When the Germans invaded Warsaw in 1939, he escaped to Vilnius. The Soviet authorities deported Begin to Siberia in 1940, but in 1941 he was released and joined the Polish army in exile, with which he went to Palestine in 1942. He joined the militant Irgun Zvai Leumi and was its commander in 1943-48, directing among other things the bombing of the King David Hotel in 1946, which killed 91 people. After Israel's independence in 1948 the Irgun formed the Herut (\"Freedom\") Party with Begin as its head and opposition leader in the Knesset until 1967. Begin joined the National Unity government (1967-70) as a minister without portfolio and in 1970 became joint chairman of the Likud (\"Unity\") coalition. On May 17, 1977, the Likud Party won elections and on June 21 Begin formed a government. Prodded by U.S. president Jimmy Carter, Begin negotiated with Pres. Anwar as-Sadat of Egypt for peace in the Middle East, and a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt was signed on March 26, 1979. Begin and Sadat were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978. In the early 1980s, his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state remained resolute. His party failed to win a clear majority in a general election in 1981, but he was able to form a coalition. Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, causing well-publicized civilian casualties, turned world opinion against Israel. Begin resigned in 1983.\n\nBeglaryan, Artak (Artemovich) (b.

Since Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of the Majlis, was effectively the number two man in the IRP, Beheshti had no serious difficulty defeating his rivals. Reputed to be a cunning manipulator behind the scenes, he was a good public speaker and behaved in a magisterial manner when dealing with both equals and subordinates. He played a leading part in the U.S. hostage crisis and was instrumental in the dismissal in June 1981 of Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, first president of the Islamic Republic.

June 4, 2002, Lima), president of Peru (1963-68, 1980-85); son of Rafael Belaúnde Diez Canseco; nephew of Víctor Andrés Belaúnde. He helped to found the National Democratic Front in 1943 and was its representative in the Chamber of Deputies in 1945-48. In 1956, he ran for president for the newly formed Democratic Youth Front; he was defeated but made a surprisingly strong showing. Shortly thereafter this party was renamed Popular Action. He was a fierce defender of his beliefs, to the point of fighting a sabre duel in 1957 with a political rival who had insulted him. The two nicked each other slightly, drawing blood, before referees called the duel over. First elected president in June 1963, he set about forming a reformist coalition. His program of land reform and road building to open the Amazon valley to settlement progressed, but he was frustrated in much of his domestic policy by an opposition-controlled Congress. Public outcry over an agreement with a U.S. corporation, the International Petroleum Company, on the development of oil fields in northern Peru led to his deposal by a military junta in October 1968. He fled to the U.S., returned to Peru in December 1970, and was again exiled from January 1971 to January 1976. In the presidential elections of May 1980 he was returned by a massive majority. He restored freedom of the press to Peru, but was baffled by high inflation, a huge foreign debt, and violent attacks by the Shining Path guerrilla. Resentment over his austerity measures and his inability to control the military in its fight against terrorists led to his crushing electoral defeat in May 1985.\n\nBelaúnde Terry, Francisco (b.

He broke with Pres. Andrew Jackson in 1834 in the fight over the Bank of the United States. In 1836 he supported Hugh Lawson White for president. After White's defeat Bell became a Whig and, in March 1841, as a reward for party services, was made secretary of war in Pres. William Henry Harrison's cabinet. A few months later, after the death of President Harrison, he resigned in opposition to Pres. John Tyler's break with the Whigs. After six years' retirement from political life, Bell was elected as a U.S. senator for Tennessee in 1847, serving until 1859. Although a large slaveholder, Bell opposed efforts to expand slavery to the U.S. territories. He vigorously opposed Pres. James K. Polk's Mexican War policy and voted against the Compromise of 1850, the Kansas-Nebraska bill (1854), and the attempt to admit Kansas as a slave state. Bell's temperate support of slavery combined with his vigorous defense of the Union brought him the presidential nomination of the moderate Constitutional Union party in 1860, but he carried only Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. He initially opposed secession, but following Pres. Abraham Lincoln's call for troops, he advocated resistance and henceforth classed himself a rebel, though he took no active part in the Civil War.\n\nBell, John C(romwell), Jr. (b.

Bell served as commissioner of education under presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan before he was appointed as education secretary. He originally was appointed as secretary to phase out the Education Department, which was created by Pres. Jimmy Carter. Bell's leadership at the education department led to the \"A Nation At Risk\" report, which prompted a school reform movement to make education consistent with the demands of a modern-day market. The 1983 report found serious flaws in the nation's education system and concluded that schools were drowning in mediocrity.\n\nBell, William Moody (b. March 27, 1879 - d.

Sept. 3, 1921, Tonkawa, Okla. - d. Sept. 29, 2009, Enid, Okla.), governor of Oklahoma (1963-67, 1987-91). He began his political career at age 25, when he was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. The state's first Republican governor, he was credited with making the party a viable force in state politics. In 1967, he served as national chairman of the Nixon for President campaign. He then went on to win election to the U.S. Senate in 1968 and again in 1974. During his first term as a U.S. senator, he supported a federal court order that called for crosstown busing to achieve racial balance in Oklahoma City public schools. Many state newspapers criticized him for his stance. After concluding his second term in the U.S. Senate, Gov. George Nigh, a Democrat, called upon Bellmon to be interim director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, which was undergoing restructuring. In 1985, he was selected as receiver of the financially troubled National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage in Oklahoma City. The following year, he decided to run for governor again at a time when the state was reeling from the effects of a major downturn in the petroleum industry and problems in the agricultural sector. With two of the state's largest industries in trouble, tax revenues declined and the state government faced painful layoffs and budget cuts. He proposed increasing various state taxes and fees, which put him at odds with fellow Oklahoma Republicans. At the end of his second term as governor, he saw passage of the Education Reform and Funding Act of 1990. The legislation called for an increase in funding for public schools by 27%, as well as smaller class sizes, compulsory kindergarten, and teacher incentive pay.\n\nBello, Alhaji Sir Ahmadu (b.

In 1956, during the regime of Pres. Manuel Odría, Beltrán was jailed for one month on the island prison of El Frontón for advocating a relaxation of Odría's repressive rule. In 1959 he became prime minister and minister of finance when the Peruvian economy was edging toward disaster. With the country's inflation rate at 11%, Beltrán was appointed by Pres. Manuel Prado in a desperate move to rebuild the economy. During his two years as prime minister, Beltrán repaid Peru's debt of $14.5 million to the International Monetary Fund, cut inflation to 3%, and instituted a \"free-exchange basis,\" which strengthened the country's foreign reserves and its balance of trade. In 1961 he made a bid for the presidency, but dropped plans to run in the 1962 election after his initial campaign rally attracted only a handful of supporters.

In 1855 he resigned and went to live abroad. He tried to seize the presidency again in 1865, winning popular acclaim in La Paz during an absence of Pres. Mariano Melgarejo, but when Melgarejo returned Belzu was killed, after seemingly having won the battle; according to one version, Melgarejo himself fearlessly went towards Belzu and shot him, then asked the terrified crowds: \"Belzu is dead, who lives now [quién vive ahora]?\" - prompting shouts of \"Viva Melgarejo.\" Belzu was married to noted writer Juana Manuela Gorriti.\n\nBém\n\nBém, Pavel (b.

He returned to become director of national security under the Hédi Nouira government, and in April 1980 he became Tunisian ambassador in Warsaw. Returning to Tunis in October 1984, he was appointed state secretary for national security and, a year later, a cabinet minister. He earned a reputation as a hardliner capable of establishing law and order; he demonstrated this ability while serving national security during the January 1978 riots and later after the 1984 bread riots. In April 1986 he became interior minister. Widespread support for him derived from his active role in rooting out the violent fundamentalist Islamic Tendency Movement, which in August 1987 planted bombs in tourist resorts. He was regarded as Pres. Habib Bourguiba's most suitable successor for some time, a view shared by Bourguiba himself, who appointed Ben Ali as prime minister in early October 1987. On Nov. 7, 1987, in a remarkably peaceful coup, engineered to make it constitutional, Ben Ali took over the presidency from Bourguiba, who was declared medically unfit to rule. Although Ben Ali and Bourguiba both strongly opposed the religious extremists, Ben Ali believed in a more moderate approach, and it was Bourguiba's decision to reopen the recently ended trial of 90 Islamic fundamentalists that prompted the coup. Ben Ali promised to permit an active role for most opposition parties in state affairs but the country remained under a de facto one-party system. He received more than 99% of the vote in elections in 1989, 1994, and 1999. He was OAU chairman in 1994-95. After a controversial constitutional referendum in 2002 allowing him to remain in office until 2014, he was reelected again in 2004 and 2009. In January 2011 he was forced by a popular uprising to flee the country, finding refuge in Saudi Arabia. In June 2011 he was sentenced in absentia to 35 years in prison for embezzlement, in July to another 15 years for illegal possession of arms, drugs, and archaeological artifacts, plus 16 years for real-estate corruption, and in June 2012 to 20 years for inciting \"murder and looting\" during a police attempt to smuggle his nephew out of the country in the 2011 revolt.\n\nBen Amar, Ahmed (b. 1926, Aleg, Mauritania), interior minister of Mauritania (1971-73).

January 1920, Rabat, Morocco - d. Oct. 31?, 1965, Fontenay-le-Vicomte?, Seine-et-Oise [now in Essonne], France), Moroccan politician. An early nationalist, he joined the Comité d'Action Marocaine and later was one of the founding members of the Istiqlal party and political director of its weekly publication. He signed the Istiqlal manifesto on Jan. 11, 1944, demanding an end to the French protectorate, an act for which he was gaoled. Upon release in October 1954, he was responsible for building his party into a mass movement. He was exiled to southern Morocco in March 1951 when the party's activities were suspended and Sultan Muhammad V sent to Madagascar. After the sultan's return, Ben Barka was appointed president of the National Consultative Assembly in 1956. After independence, Ben Barka clashed with the conservative elements of the Istiqlal party and left to found the Union Nationale des Forces Populaires in 1959. He continued to criticize the government and successfully contested National Assembly elections in 1962. Soon after, he was forced to leave Morocco when a plot to assassinate King Hassan II was discovered. He was sentenced to death in absentia. In exile, he travelled widely, representing his party until his mysterious disappearance on Oct. 29, 1965. Stopped on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris by two French policemen, he was shown their police cards and asked to follow them. He was taken in a police car to Fontenay-le-Vicomte (south of Paris) and never seen again in public. He is presumed to have been killed, though the circumstances are still unclear today. It is supposed that his abduction was masterminded by members of the Moroccan police and the then Moroccan interior minister Gen. Muhammad Oufkir.\n\nBen Bella\n\nBen Bella, (Mohammed) Ahmed (Arabic Muhammad Ahmad Bin Balla), also known as Hemmimed, Abdelkader Mebtouche, or Messaoud Mezziani (b. Dec. 25, 19181, Maghnia [Marnia], Algeria - d. April 11, 2012, Algiers, Algeria), prime minister (1962-63) and president (1963-65) of Algeria. He joined Messali Hadj's underground movement, and after Gov. Marcel Edmond Naegelen rigged elections in 1948 he became one of those Algerians who considered illusory any hope of achieving independence democratically. With his friends in Messali Hadj's party, he founded the Organisation Spéciale (OS), whose aim was to take up arms as quickly as possible. After robbing the post office at Oran (1950) to obtain funds for the nationalist movement, he was sentenced to prison, but he managed to esc"
