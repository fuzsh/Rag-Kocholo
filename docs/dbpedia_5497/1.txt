No maroon Jaguars in Augusta.

That unlikely combination is forbidden in an agreement signed last week settling a lawsuit between the Georgia Board of Regents and Regent University in Virginia.

Two of the main stipulations in the agreement say GRU must refrain from using a color similar to the Virginia school's maroon and must not establish a school of theology in Augusta, said Burns Newsome, the University System of Georgia's vice chancellor for legal affairs.

That means divinty degrees also are off the table, Newsome said.

Luckliy, GRU officials said they won't have to scrap current plans to comply with those terms.

"Our colors are blue and silver and we do not have any plans to create a theology school," said GRU spokeswoman Christen Carter.

The settlement was drafted June 12 and signed Wednesday by Regent University President Carlos Campo.

The Virginia school's lawsuit, which sought damages and to bar the Georgia system from using the name Georgia Regents, was filed in September after the new name for the merged Georgia Health Sciences and Augusta State universities was announced. Regent University claimed the Georgia school's name constituted trademark infringement and unfair competition.

The settlement states Regent University will dismiss the lawsuit within five days of the agreement's execution. Newsome said the agreement confirms the two schools can continue using their respective names without restriction.

"We don't want there to be confusion between our two universities any more than they do," he said.
