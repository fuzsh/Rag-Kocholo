Your family and friends are invited; no tickets needed. Doors will open at 11:30 p.m. for open seating.\n\ncommissioning CEREMONY procedure\n\nOn Friday, May 3, 2024, arrive in the lobby of Shaw Chapel by 11:15 a.m. for check-in. Wear your regalia and bring your hood. NO CAPS are needed for the Commissioning ceremony. Do not bring your cap. Programs will be available for distribution. The procedure is as follows:\n\n1. Check in at the table in the lobby of Shaw Chapel.\n\n2. You will be given an index card on which you will write your name how you want it read and phonetically if necessary. (Sharpie provided!)\n\n3. Graduates will be lined up in alphabetical order with hoods draped over the left forearm.\n\n4. The processional will begin promptly at 12:00 p.m.\n\n5. Graduates will be seated in the front right section of Shaw Chapel.\n\n6. For the hooding portion of the ceremony, graduates will be directed, row by row, to the stage from the right side through the Groom’s Room. A name reader will be at the podium/microphone. Hand your name card to the reader, and she will announce your name.\n\n7. When your name is called, proceed toward Dean Bachmann and Dr. Cook who will be center stage. Dr. Cook will take your hood, you will turn to face the audience, and Dr. Cook will place the hood over your head. Dean Bachmann and Dr. Cook will congratulate you and pose for a photograph.\n\n8. Following the photograph, proceed across the stage and exit via the Choir Room.\n\n9. Grad Images will be in the Choir Room to take an individual photo of each graduate in front of a professional background.\n\n10. Exiting the Choir Room, walk down the side aisle, across the back of the Chapel, and up the other side aisle to your original row. You will not return to your original seat. Note: Circling the Chapel in this manner will eliminate traffic in the center aisle and obstruction of other graduates on stage.\n\n11. During the Prayer portion of the ceremony, faculty will line up across the front of the steps. Graduates will be directed to a faculty member for prayer and then you will proceed around the Chapel the same manner as for hooding.\n\n12. For awards, those who receive an award will walk up the front steps of the stage to center stage when their name is called and pose for a photo with the faculty member.\n\n13. Honor Society Inductees will come forward to the front steps of the stage as they are recognized and pose for a group photo once all names are called.\n\n14. Following the benediction and announcements, Dean Bachmann will lead the recessional, followed by the faculty, and the graduates. All faculty and graduates will proceed directly outside to the front steps of the Shaw Chapel for a group photo.\n\n15. Guests are asked to wait in the Shaw Chapel lobby until the group photo is complete."
