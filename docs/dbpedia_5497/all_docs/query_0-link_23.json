        "text": "Since every dorm room has a kitchen, Regent doesn't have a traditional campus dining hall, but it does have the Ordinary (smaller cafeteria, not open on weekends). The Ordinary is a bit price-y (for example, fruit cup is about $2 something), but I've been satisfied with most of my meals I've brought from the Ordinary. To save some money, you could bring a water bottle since there are water fountains. An economically responsible and satisfying meal I get often is a grilled cheese sandwich with fries which is around $3-4. They have a daily menu (cheeseburger, grilled chicken, etc.), and a menu that changes each day (but is the same bi-weekly). The Ordinary has a soda fountain (Coke products I think), a fridge with juices and such, limited Starbucks coffee, and water. They also have season treats like gingerbread cookies, a drink of the month, and this Around-the-World themed featured cultural dish entree. I have a small obsessions with their Smithfield burgers, and their personal pan pizzas are great (cheese pizza is only about $2). Their taco salads are also good, but I wouldn't suggest having them every Thursday). Their fries can get addicting and I heard high reviews for the sweet potato fries (I personally don't like sweet potatoes). The Ordinary's breakfast menu isn't huge (they do offer omelets!) and I personally don't like their hash browns. Their soups are good on most days and I still need to try their pastas. Snacks and drinks are also available at the School Store and vending machines. There are also dining options available down the street (very short car ride, long-ish bike ride), across the street (7-11, Waffle House..), and at the Founder's Inn (I think it's price-y though) which is practically on-campus."
