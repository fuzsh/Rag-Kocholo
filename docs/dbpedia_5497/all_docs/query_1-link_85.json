        "text": "Robert Francis McDonnell (born June 15, 1954) is an American politician and lawyer who served as the 71st Governor of Virginia, from 2010 to 2014. A member of the Republican Party, McDonnell also served on the executive committee of the Republican Governors Association. McDonnell was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Reserve. He served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992 to 2006, and was Attorney General of Virginia from 2006 to 2009. McDonnell was elected Governor of Virginia after using the campaign slogan \"Bob's for Jobs.\" He defeated Democratic state Senator Creigh Deeds by a 17-point margin in the 2009 general election, which was marked by the severe recession of the late 2000s. McDonnell succeeded Democrat Tim Kaine who was term-limited by Virginia law.After taking office as governor, McDonnell advocated privatization and promoted offshore drilling for Virginia. He moved to extend a contract to outsource the state's computer operations and sought to fund transportation improvements from asset sales, including a proposal to auction off liquor stores operated by the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The state's unemployment rate declined from 7.4% in January 2010, when McDonnell took office, to 5.2% in December 2013, comparable to the decline in the national unemployment rate from 9.8% to 6.7% during the same period. McDonnell's governorship ended with a 55% to 32% approval to disapproval rating among registered voters.On January 21, 2014, McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were indicted on federal corruption charges for receiving improper gifts and loans from a Virginia businessman. They were convicted on most counts by a federal jury on September 4, 2014. McDonnell, the first Virginia governor to be indicted or convicted of a felony, was sentenced on January 6, 2015, to two years in prison, followed by two years of supervised release. However, he was free on bond during the subsequent appeals process.On June 27, 2016, the United States Supreme Court unanimously overturned McDonnell's conviction and remanded the case back to a lower court. Less than three months later, the Justice Department announced that they would not prosecute the case again, and moved to dismiss the charges against the former governor and his wife. The case racked up over $27 million in legal bills, and McDonnell has taken four jobs to pay them off.McDonnell currently serves as a professor at Regent University and runs The McDonnell Group, a real estate consulting firm, with his sister.\n\nCorey J. Hodges (born December 14, 1970 in St. Petersburg, Florida) is an African-American preacher and the chaplain for the NBA Utah Jazz professional basketball team. He was a columnist for The Salt Lake Tribune faith section for five years. He was also a regular host of the television program This week in the Word which aired weekly on Utah's KTMW. Hodges is currently the pastor of The Point Church, a Multicultural Christian Community in Salt Lake City, Utah that has membership from over 40 different nations and holds weekly services in both English and Spanish. His church is affiliated with both the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. and the Southern Baptist Convention. Hodges is the Vice-President of the Utah Idaho Southern Baptist Convention, and he served six years as the president of the Intermountain General Baptist Convention Inc., which covers three states: Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Hodges is a member of the Utah State Ethics Commission, appointed by Utah Governor Gary Herbert (the Commission investigates ethics allegations against officials in any political subdivision in the state). In 2006, Hodges was appointed to serve on the Initiative on Utah Children in Foster Care (IOU) board by Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Christine M. Durham. He previously served on the Governor’s Olene Walker Board of Economic Development. Hodges is a 2006 recipient of the Community of Peace Award given to outstanding citizens who model peace and make a personal commitment towards making Salt Lake County a community of peace. In 2009, he received the City of Taylorsville, Utah citizen’s award and in 2010, Utah Governor Gary Herbert presented him with an award for his outstanding service to the Utah community. Pastor Hodges is also the 2010 recipient of the NAACP Salt Lake Branch Albert B. Fritz Civil Rights/Humanitarian Worker of the Year Award. He is the founder of the New Pilgrim School of Fine Arts. On July 14, 2007 Hodges wrote a column for The Salt Lake Tribune titled, \"Women face many difficulties leaving abusive spouses,\" in which he stated that Fox News Channel commentator Bill O'Reilly blamed Nancy Benoit and Jessie Davis for their deaths. O'Reilly retorted by calling Hodges' claim an \"outrageous lie\" on the July 16 O'Reilly Factor \"Most Ridiculous Item of the Day.\" Hodges responded with another column in the Salt Lake Tribune on July 21 titled, \"Perhaps I misunderstood O'Reilly's comments about murders,\" in which he argued that his statements were \"probably more accurately characterized as a misinterpretation rather than a lie.\" On his July 23 show, O'Reilly again said that Hodges statements were a \"flat out lie.\" Hodges holds an associates and bachelor's degree in Business Administration and Marketing and a Masters of Arts in Divinity from Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia."
