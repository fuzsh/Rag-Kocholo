To request use of the seal, contact the Office of University Relations.\n\nUniversity Brand\n\nDriven to Discover is the official brand of the University. All University Units should use Driven to Discover and brand elements available on the Our Brand site.\n\nUse of University Trademarks and Logos\n\nBy University Colleges, Schools, Departments, Campus Life Programs and Other Units\n\nUnits are required to use the wordmark and may use the Block M, in connection with official University business. System campuses must use the appropriate wordmark and Block M combination for their campus in connection with official University business and in their official web headers. University units may also use the mascot marks as appropriate in less formal circumstances.\n\nEach of the University's units has unique attributes that enrich the University brand. When developing individual marketing programs to highlight their unique attributes, units are encouraged to work with the Office of University Relations to assure the successful integration of such programs with the University brand.\n\nBy Student Organizations\n\nRegistered Student Organizations (RSO) on the Twin Cities campus are allowed the use of the Registered Student Organization Block M mark or Registered Student Organization Goldy mark. The RSO Block M mark, and RSO Goldy mark may not be altered or combined with other elements or graphics.

Potential confusion should be dispelled by adding a disclaimer stating that the University is not involved in the subject of the statement. This is also addressed in Board of Regents Policies: Academic Freedom and Responsibility and Outside Consulting and Other Commitments.\n\nAthletics Department staff may conduct summer camps and clinics as such activities are commonly understood.The use of the name of the University or any title which would imply University endorsement or sponsorship (e.g., \"Gopher\" or \"Bulldogs\") is specifically prohibited unless the camp or clinic is developed and operated as a University-sponsored program or the camp or clinic is held in a campus facility and the athletics director gives written permission for the use of specific identifying terms.

Use of University trademarks are not allowed in third-party communications including vendor websites or other communications aimed at marketing their products or services.\n\nGeneral Prohibition.\n\nNeither the name of the University nor any University trademark may be used in any manner that could adversely affect the University’s image or standing or would for any other reason be inappropriate for a public research university.

With respect to all violations of this policy, the University reserves its right to seek appropriate remedies under applicable federal or state law.\n\nExceptions\n\nUnits may submit a request for a special exception to University Relations for consideration."
