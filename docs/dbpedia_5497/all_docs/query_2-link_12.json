However, due to the uniqueness of some programs and the fact that there is only one commencement yearly, Regent provides the opportunity for students who have not completed all requirements to participate in commencement, if they meet the following criteria:\n\nUndergraduate students who have no more than three courses remaining for graduation. Students must be registered for these courses in the summer session. The coursework may include an internship or practicum experience, which can also be completed during the summer.\n\nGraduate students who have no more than two courses remaining for graduation. Students must be registered for these courses in the summer session. The coursework may include an internship or practicum experience, which can also be completed during the summer.\n\nTheses, dissertations, and portfolios must have been successfully defended or approved before the spring cut-off date (varies by school), with only final edits remaining.\n\nStudents approved to participate in commencement will be notified via email no later than March 15th, 2024.\n\nAttorney General Jason Miyares to Deliver Regent’s 2024 Commencement Address\n\nAttorney General Miyares, the 49th Attorney General of Virginia, got his relentless drive to succeed from his mother, Miriam Miyares, who fled communist Cuba and immigrated to Virginia to raise her son to appreciate freedom, fairness, and justice for all. Jason Miyares is now the first Hispanic American to be elected to a statewide office in Virginia and the first child of an immigrant to be attorney general.\n\nSince his inauguration in 2022, Miyares has focused on fighting violent crime, improving public safety, strengthening economic growth, and combating the deadly impact of opioids and fentanyl. AG Miyares secured over a billion dollars in opioid settlements for drug addiction and recovery from pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors. He led an investigation that discovered that the 2020 Virginia Parole Board broke the law and endangered Virginians by releasing violent, repeat offenders early with life sentences. AG Miyares also launched Operation Ceasefire, a multifaceted intervention in communities and aggressive prosecution of violent gun crimes.\n\nFor students with disability related needs, accommodations will be offered for all commissioning and commencement services. Students requesting disability related accommodations should fill out the Graduation Accommodations Request form below no later than April 1st, 2024.

Through the online session, you will learn your loan repayment schedule, payment plans available to you, and relief options that exist should you need them.\n\nLoan Exit Counseling is a very important requirement that will help you prepare to enter repayment with confidence. The session is self-paced, and most students report that it takes them approximately 30 minutes to complete.\n\nVisit the studentaid.gov website and select the option to Complete Loan Exit Counseling when you are ready to get started.\n\nRegent University is proud to recognize the service and sacrifice of veterans and those currently serving in the U.S. military. One way we do this is by offering honor cords that may be worn at school commissioning ceremonies and commencement, free of charge. If you are a graduating student and U.S. military active-duty service member, veteran, reservist, National Guardsman, or ROTC cadet or midshipmen, simply verify your current military status in Genisys through my.regent.edu to ensure you receive a cord. You may pick up your honor cord in the Welcome Center between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays or on commencement day starting at 6:30 a.m. If you are unable to attend commissioning and commencement, you may request that an honor cord be mailed to your home by sending an email with your first and last name, student ID, and complete mailing address to military@regent.edu.\n\nIf you are both a military dependent AND a military veteran or service member, you must note your eligibility status so that you are flagged for inclusion (A dependent-only status would not qualify for the cord.). We salute you for your service!\n\nAny questions? Email the Military Resource Center at military@regent.edu."
