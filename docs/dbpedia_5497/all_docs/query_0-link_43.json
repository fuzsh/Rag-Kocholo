He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor (Luke 4:18-19).\n\nHe confidently rolled the scroll and returned it to its rightful place before turning to the multitude and declaring that the words were fulfilled in Him.\n\nAs His Regents, leaders standing in place of our Lord until He returns, we take the responsibility of loving and serving others as He would, proclaiming the good news of liberty in our broken world. Regent’s RESCUE Initiative recognizes the specific heart-breaking oppression known as human trafficking that is so often overlooked domestically.\n\nThe Problem\n\nIn 2019, the Polaris Project identified 189 victims in the state of Virginia alone, many of which were reported in VA Beach and surrounding areas. This number does little to portray the desperate need for a solution as the issue is under-reported and under-researched with several hundred thousand victims across the United States. Moreover, more than half of survivors report that they attended school while being trafficked. This is not an overseas problem, but one taking place daily in our own backyard, if not on our campus.\n\nOur Solution\n\nWho We Are. The Regent RESCUE Initiative is the founding chapter of a student organization that aims to increase trafficking awareness and ultimately victim identification through a tri-fold approach of educating, resourcing, and supporting local, regional, national, and global organizations in this pursuit. Regent’s chapter of the RESCUE Initiative will rescue human dignity through:\n\nR esource Provision\n\nE ducation of the Community\n\nS tudent Service\n\nC ultivation of Christian Identity\n\nU nification of the Chapter\n\nE mpowerment of Others\n\nWhat We Do. The RESCUE Initiative is organized into four distinct committees to best meet the needs of the campus and local communities. These include Campus Outreach, Community Outreach, Spiritual Life, and Media and Marketing. Each of these will be led by coordinators that make up the executive board under the supervision of a president and faculty advisor and meet individually with their committees as necessary.\n\nCampus Outreach is the heart of the student organization, planning and executing Regent University sanctioned events that promote the student organization and improve awareness in the campus community. The campus outreach coordinator facilitates event planning for the Regent community and works closely with the marketing coordinator to educate the campus on the anti-trafficking climate.\n\nCommunity Outreach, on the other hand, identifies community partners, churches and nonprofits, to foster productive relationships that provide resources to both the organization and anti-trafficking efforts. The Community Outreach Coordinator communicates with active and prospective partners to convey who we are, what we do, and how the RESCUE Initiative can contribute to the community. As such, they will also facilitate community events such as fundraisers with church partners and student service projects.\n\nThe Media and Marketing Committee is responsible for broadcasting campus and community events through the various mediums of print advertisements, social media sites, and Regent sponsored productions. They plan to work closely with campus outreach to use these means for education and resource provision to the campus and community. The Marketing Director oversees social media accounts and communicates effectively with each committee to ensure events are well-advertised and the public is actively engaged.\n\nFinally, Spiritual Life serves as an internal means to ensure the personal growth and mutual edification of RESCUE Initiative members. As committee membership remains by application only, members are dedicated to the pursuit of anti-trafficking and united by their identity and mission in Christ. The Spiritual Life Director guides the vision of the student organization by encouraging members in a unified mission through the coordination of devotional resources and providing biblical insight into trafficking issues.\n\nAs Regent University grows, the RESCUE Initiative is overjoyed to have this opportunity to conform to the mind of Christ by resourcing anti-trafficking efforts with the help of students, faculty, and community partners. As we proclaim liberty to the captives, may we embrace our freedom in Christ to love and serve as His anointed.\n\nEligibility: Currently enrolled undergraduate students.\n\nRU Ballroom Dancing\n\nRU Ballroom Dancing is just that!
