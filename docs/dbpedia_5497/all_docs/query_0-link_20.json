If using the courtesy title esquire after the last name, abbreviate (Esq.) and place a comma after the last name: Mike Brown, Esq.\n\nMonths are generally not abbreviated, but if space is an issue, you can abbreviate these months when used with the day of the month: Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.\n\nNo. should be used as the abbreviation for number in conjunction with a figure to indicate position or rank: No. 1 bestselling book.\n\nA.D. & B.C. – Because the full phrase should read in the year of our Lord 1996, the abbreviation goes before the figure for the year: A.D. 1996. Because the full phrase should read in the year 500 before Christ, the abbreviation goes after the figure for the year: 500 B.C.\n\nA.M. & P.M. – Use lowercase letters with periods and no space in standard copy. If the preceding copy is presented in all caps, use A.M. and P.M: JOIN US FRIDAY AT 3 P.M.\n\nEST (Eastern Standard Time) / EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) are the acronyms we use for Regent’s time zone; usage depends on DST (Daylight Saving Time). If an event series or program is year-round or is held during a timeframe when there is a falling back or springing forward of the clock, Eastern time can be used: Tune in every Wednesday at 12 p.m. (Eastern time).\n\nUnited States can be abbreviated to U.S. in the body copy of stories, however, if abbreviating United States in a headline, no periods between (US).\n\nState names are not abbreviated in the body copy of stories or headlines. However, when referencing the District of Columbia, abbreviate to D.C. When referencing party affiliation (R-Okla., D-N.Y.) or in lists, tabular material, condensed agate type and credit lines, state names can be abbreviated: Ala., Ariz., Ark., Calif., Colo., Conn., Del., Fla., Ga., Ill., Ind., Kan., Ky., La., Md., Mass., Mich., Miss., Mo., Mont., Neb., Nev., N.H., N.J., N.M., N.Y., N.C., N.D., Okla., Ore., Pa., R.I., S.C., S.D., Tenn., Vt., Va., Wash., W.VA., Wis., Wyo. Never abbreviate Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Ohio, Texas and Utah unless referencing a postal code.\n\nPostal codes require the state name to be abbreviated and D.C. is presented without periods: AK, AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, VA VT, WA, WI, WV, WY.\n\nFor numbered street addresses, you can abbreviate Avenue (Ave.), Boulevard (Blvd.) and Street (St.): She’s located at 120 Main St. However, if no street number is noted, do not abbreviate: She’s located off of Main Street.\n\nAccreditation\n\nWhen referring to the overall accreditation of Regent University by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), the following statement was formulated by SACSCOC and MUST BE USED IN ITS ENTIRETY and without changes:\n\nRegent University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associates, baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees. Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-4097 or call 404.679.4500 for questions about the accreditation of Regent University.\n\nFor a complete listing of Regent’s accreditations and licenses, visit regent.edu/accreditation.\n\nAcronyms\n\nBefore using an acronym or other abbreviation, spell out the entire phrase with the abbreviation following in parentheses. Subsequent references may be made using only the acronym. However, if the acronym is at a beginning at a sentence, it should be spelled out.\n\nExamples:\n\nShe took the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) as scheduled. The GRE was challenging.\n\nGraduate Record Exams scores are to be sent to Regent University.\n\nA way to avoid having to spell out the acronym is to rework the sentence.\n\nExample:\n\nSend GRE scores to Regent University.\n\nActing Dean\n\nWhen referring to the position of acting dean, capitalization is not necessary unless immediately preceding the name of the individual, in which case only the word Dean is capitalized.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe announcement was made by acting Dean Jane Briley.\n\nThe announcement was made by Jane Briley, acting dean.\n\nActive duty\n\nHyphenate when used as a compound modifier. When used as a noun, active duty is two words.\n\nExamples:\n\nSpouses of active-duty service members can recieve a tuition discount.\n\nShe is able to pursue her degree while being on active duty.\n\nA.D., B.C.\n\nThe rules for using A.D. (anno Domini, year of our Lord) and B.C. (before Christ) are not the same.\n\nThe rule for A.D.\n\nBecause the full phrase should read in the year of our Lord 1996, the abbreviation goes before the figure for the year: A.D. 1996.\n\nThe rule for B.C.\n\nBecause the full phrase should read in the year 500 before Christ, the abbreviation goes after the figure for the year: 500 B.C.\n\nAges\n\nUse figures at all times to describe a person’s age, even if the age is a single digit. Ages expressed as adjectives before a noun or as substitutes for a noun use hyphens.\n\nExamples:\n\nTodd is 3 years old.\n\nI met 3-year-old Todd.\n\nDavid is in his 30s. (no apostrophe)\n\nAlumni\n\nUse the word alumni when referring to a group of men and women who have attended the school. Use the word alumnus (alumni in the plural) when referring to a man (or men) who attended the school. Use alumna (alumnae in the plural) for similar references to a woman.\n\na.m., p.m.\n\nAlways use lowercase letters with periods and no space.\n\nAmpersands (&)\n\nWhen referring to university courses, programs and schools, use an ampersand (&) rather than and.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe School of Divinity is offering a new course called Life Principles & Values.\n\nThe School of Psychology & Counseling offers the Doctoral Program in Counselor Education & Supervision.\n\nApostrophes\n\nAn apostrophe is used to show possession and also to indicate missing letters or numerals.\n\nExamples:\n\nRegent’s faculty is among the nation’s finest.\n\nThe ’90s will be a decade of change and challenge.\n\nAn apostrophe is not used to make a year plural.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe 1990s will be a decade of promise.\n\nAn apostrophe should be used to make single letters plural.\n\nExamples:\n\nShe expected to receive A’s and B’s.\n\nOne does not use an apostrophe for plurals of multiple-letter combinations or numerals. Use an apostrophe in plural versions of degrees (M.A.s, MBAs, Ph.D.s).\n\nExamples:\n\nThe young students practiced their ABCs.\n\nThousands of TVs were tuned in to the program.\n\nHe would have two MBAs if he could.\n\nWhen using an apostrophe to replace the first two numerals in a year, the apostrophe goes before and faces away from the remaining numerals.\n\nExamples:\n\nHe called the ’60s his decade.\n\nUse an apostrophe in the names of these academic degrees: bachelor’s degree, master’s degree. However, not with associate degree. (Regent offers top-quality associate, bachelor’s and master’s degrees.)\n\nAsterisks\n\nWhen asterisks are used for notation, the following placement should be used:\n\nExample:\n\nThe College of Communication & the Arts also offers the Master of Arts (M.A.) in Journalism* and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.).\n\n*Some tracks available online.\n\nPlease note that the asterisk comes after the punctuation mark, if one is used.\n\nExample:\n\nThe College of Arts & Sciences offers the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Organizational Leadership & Management,* and is scheduled to begin in the spring semester of next year.**\n\n*Offered on campus only.\n\n**Pending SACSCOC accreditation.\n\nAttorney-in-residence\n\nHyphens should be used when referring to attorney-in-residence.\n\nThis is in line with AP Stylebook: Compound nouns – Hyphenate compounds when needed to avoid confusion: merry-go-round, sister-in-law, hand-me-downs, so-and-so.\n\nCampus Titles\n\n(See also Titles)\n\nWhen referring to the Regent University campus, use the phrase Regent University campus in Virginia Beach, Virginia, or just Regent University campus.\n\nDo not use the following: Virginia Beach Campus or main campus. Neither of these phrases are applicable as the university no longer has an official secondary campus.\n\nCapitalization\n\nFor general rules of capitalization, see the Associated Press (AP) Stylebook. In this manual, also see guidelines for capitalization under specific entries, such as TITLES, BOARD OF TRUSTEES, OFFICES OF THE UNIVERSITY, PROGRAM NAMES, AND UNIVERSITY.\n\nCapitalize all nouns and pronouns that directly refer to the Deity.\n\nExamples:\n\nGod sent His Son as a sacrifice for man.\n\nHis name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the Prince of Peace.\n\nWe are regents of the King, Jesus Christ.\n\n(See also Bible, biblical and Scripture, scriptural)\n\nCentury\n\nAlways lowercase the word century as in 21st century. Spell out the years for the first through ninth centuries, and use figures thereafter.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe 21st century begins in 2001, not 2000, which is the final year of the 20th century.\n\nWhat happened in the first century?\n\nChrist-first\n\nCapitalize the word First when referring to Regent University’s core values within a stand-alone phrase, headline, or tagline. However, lowercase first when it is used in a complete sentence.\n\nExamples:\n\nTagline: Promoting Christ-First Excellence & Integrity\n\nRegent University honors your commitment to Christ-first excellence and integrity.\n\nChurch\n\nCapitalize the word Church when it refers to the body of Christians who comprise Christ’s Church and when it is part of the proper name of a church. Do not capitalize it in general references to a place of worship.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Church is challenged by an increase in humanism.\n\nDoes she have a local church?\n\nChristian Leadership to Change the World\n\n(See also Mission statement)\n\nCapitalize Regent’s mission statement as shown when the statement is standing alone. When the mission statement is used in the body copy of a sentence or article, italicize the statement.\n\nExample:\n\nAfter visiting the campus, he understood the importance of Christian Leadership to Change the World.\n\nCommas\n\nIn a Series\n\nIn a list of items, make sure there is no comma between the last two items (i.e., books, papers and bag). However, if there is an and within any of the listed items, then make sure to include a comma between the last two items to clarify them (i.e., divinity, psychology and counseling, and education). If there are commas within the listed items, then use semicolons to set the listed items apart.\n\nThere are two exceptions to the comma-in-a-series rule. The first is when listing programs or majors. In order to provide clarity in this instance, commas may be used to separate each listed item. The second is when writing or editing for the School of Law. For this specific school, all items in a list are separated by commas (i.e., books, papers, and bag).\n\nExample: Qualities that describe Regent include integrity, excellence and innovation.\n\nSuch leaders must cast compelling vision, mobilize and manage volunteers and staff, balance faith perspectives with bottom-line financial decisions, and solve daily interpersonal and organizational problems.\n\nAfter a Last Name (Sr., Jr., III, etc.)\n\nNo commas are necessary after a person’s last name/before Jr., Sr., III, etc.\n\nExamples: John Smith Jr., John Smith Sr., John Smith IV\n\nBefore Inc., LLC or Ltd.\n\nNo commas are necessary before Inc., LLC and Ltd.\n\nExamples: Long Company Name Inc., a major retailer, has just …\n\nNo comma, no periods: East Coast Railway LLC (same for PLLC)\n\nCommunication & the Arts, School of\n\nNote: There is no s at the end of Communication in the phrase School of Communication & the Arts.\n\nComposition titles\n\n(punctuation)\n\nUnlike Modern Language Association (MLA) and American Psychological Association (APA) styles, the Regent style (following Gregg as well as AP guidelines) employs italics when referring to book titles, movie titles, play titles, song titles, television program titles (this does not include television stations), and works of art. Articles, speech titles, sermon titles and lecture titles should be put in quotation marks.\n\nExamples:\n\nI just read Of Mice and Men.\n\nHe chose to watch CBS Evening News.\n\nJohn’s seminar was titled “How Children See God.”\n\nSoltor’s sculpture Relentless is on display.\n\nEvans’ article, “Go in Peace or in Pieces,” was published in The Herald.\n\nCountries\n\nIn a sentence, if a city precedes the name of a country, then the country must be set off by commas.\n\nExample:\n\nEach summer, the School of Law hosts a program in Strasbourg, France, which focuses on international law and human rights.\n\nCourses\n\nCourse names are capitalized, they are not italicized, bolded and/or underlined. The word and should be changed to an ampersand (&) for space purposes.\n\nExample:\n\nLeader’s Life & Values\n\nCoursework\n\nIn academia, this is being used as one word.\n\nCurriculum, curricula\n\nUse curriculum when referring to a single educational program. Curricula is the plural form. The same rule applies to other Latin nouns of this type: datum, data, etc.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nWrite cybersecurity as one word.\n\nDecision-maker\n\nHyphenate in all uses.\n\nExamples:\n\nRegent will position you as a principled decision-maker.\n\nXYZ is a decision-maker tool.\n\nDecision-making\n\nHyphenate in all uses.\n\nExamples:\n\nDecision-making is a key component in business leadership.\n\nThis program will develop your decision-making skills.\n\nDegrees\n\nSee also university degrees and programs.\n\nApostrophes and degrees: Use an apostrophe in bachelor’s degree and master’s degree. No apostrophe in associate degree. Doctoral degree or doctorate is preferable to doctor’s degree to avoid confusion regarding medical degrees, which are commonly called doctor’s degrees.\n\nCapitalization and degrees: If the abbreviation of the degree (i.e. Ph.D. or MFA or M.A.) or the spelled out version of the degree type (master of arts) is followed by the subject of the degree (i.e. Ph.D. in Intercultural Leadership), then the spelled out version of the degree type and the subject of the degree are capitalized.\n\nNote: However, if one simply says, Her degree in intercultural leadership …, then the name of the degree subject is not capitalized. If one says, She has a master’s from Duke University …, then the word master’s is lowercased. The same is true for the words associate’s, bachelor’s, doctorate and doctoral.\n\nExamples:\n\nWe confer the Master of Arts in Communication.\n\nThink about getting a master’s degree.\n\nShe earned her M.A. in Public Policy.\n\nPeriods: Use periods after the initials in an abbreviated degree with only two capitalized letters, such as B.A., M.A., M.Div., Ph.D. If, however, the degree has three capitalized initials, then do not use periods (i.e., MFA, DSL, MPA, MTS)\n\nCommas: After a name, an academic abbreviation is set off by commas.\n\nExample:\n\nEarl Jones, Ph.D., spoke.\n\nDo not use the courtesy title Dr. for the academic degree and then follow it with the abbreviation for the degree in the same reference.\n\nIncorrect Example:\n\nDr. Lucille Jones, Ph.D.\n\nCorrect Examples:\n\nLucille Jones, Ph.D.\n\nDr. Lucille Jones, a psychologist.\n\nDirections/Regions\n\nLowercase the points of a compass when they are used alone. Capitalize regions known specifically by direction, such as the West, the South, the Middle East, the East, the Northeast, the Southwest.\n\nLowercase general directions when part of a proper name, such as southern Texas, unless the section is well known as a region, such as Southern California.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, D.C.\n\nWhen referring to Washington, D.C., a comma must follow D.C., unless it is at the end of the sentence.\n\nDivine, divinity\n\nCapitalize Divine only when used in direct reference to God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit, or when used as part of a proper noun.\n\nExamples:\n\nThere is a Divine mandate to repent and be baptized.\n\nThe chocolate cake was divine.\n\nThe Divinity of Christ was not in question.\n\nThe School of Divinity is growing.\n\nThe divinity school is growing.\n\nDoctor\n\nUse Dr. in first reference as a formal title before the name of an individual who holds a doctor of medicine degree. Do not continue to use Dr. in subsequent references; use only the last name.\n\nExample:\n\nDr. Jonas Salk was present. Salk developed a vaccine.\n\nDr. also may be used on first reference before the names of individuals who hold other types of doctoral degrees. However, because the public frequently identifies Dr. with physicians, care should be taken to state the individual’s specialty in the first or second reference. The only exception would be a story in which the context leaves no doubt that the person is a psychologist, minister, college professor, etc.\n\nDo not use Dr. before the names of individuals who hold honorary doctorates only."
