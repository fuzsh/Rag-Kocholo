        "text": "As higher education becomes increasingly competitive, colleges and universities must work harder to attract and retain the right students. One important way of reaching and connecting with potential students, your website, must be competitively designed and accurately portray your institution’s unique brand values and mission.\n\nA university’s website is often the first point of contact for prospective students, parents, faculty members, and donors. It can make or break a visitor’s impression of the institution… whether it’s seen as modern or outdated; prestigious or mediocre.\n\nIn this article, we’ll look at 16 amazing and inspiring examples of the best university website designs we’ve seen so far in 2024.\n\nThese examples represent a variety of institutions: from large public research universities to smaller private liberal arts colleges. We’ll discuss key features of each website such as navigation, content, and design elements that make them effective and engaging for visitors, as judged by our own UI/UX designers, marketing directors and consultants, and by technical development engineering staff.\n\nRead on to learn more about the best university web designs of this year and get inspired for your own college or university’s website redesign project.\n\n16 Amazing & Inspiring Examples of University UI & UX Design\n\nOur big list of the best and award winning college, university, and higher education website designs of 2023 and early 2024:\n\nThe University Of Texas At Austin\n\nStanford University\n\nPrinceton University\n\nUniversity of California San Francisco\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nNew York University\n\nWake Forest University\n\nBerklee College of Music\n\nSanta Clara University\n\nOhio State University\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nSavannah College of Art and Design\n\nRegent College\n\nThe University of Oxford\n\nMorehouse College\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThese design examples are presented in no particular order, and each school’s website brings unique attributes that make it noteworthy for consideration in your UI and design research.\n\nImportant considerations when designing a Higher Education Institution website\n\nBefore diving into specific examples, though, let’s go over some important considerations for designers tasked with designing an effective higher education institution website.\n\nIn 2023, there are a few key themes appearing again and again, and a few basics that just seem to always be important:\n\nClear main navigation\n\nA clear main navigation will help visitors navigate your site with ease. We see numerous universities redesigning their primary navigation to be simpler. Mega menus are still in, but we’re definitely see less of them.\n\nResponsive Design\n\nThe majority of users will be browsing on mobile devices so it’s important that your site works well no matter how it’s viewed. All of the university websites we’ve worked on this year are highly responsive. We see many universities following a mobile-first approach.\n\nQuick access to key information\n\nProspective students want quick access to admissions requirements while current students may need access to course catalogs & schedules. Getting to the basic info has clearly taken the forefront over esthetics and conceptual designs.\n\nIntegrated social media\n\nIncorporating social media content, from Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, or any other platform, into your institution’s website is a great way to create even more compelling digital experiences. Social posting can help your institution build relationships with potential and current students, while at the same time showcasing student life in real-time. For many, this serves also as a means of recycling existing content and repurposing current opportunities.\n\nAccommodating diverse users\n\nUniversities should ensure that their websites are accessible for all people, including those living with disabilities or using assistive technology.\n\nVideos & other media\n\nVideo has become a popular way for universities to show off their schools and campus life. We’ve seen many universities use video in their navigation as homepages, section front pages, and within content.\n\nCalls-to-action\n\nCalls-to-action (or as we call them: CTAs) are essential for guiding users to the information they need and areas of the website that you want them to explore. CTAs should be obvious, but not overwhelming.\n\nSearch & filter capabilities\n\nPotential students spend a significant amount of time researching schools before applying, so having a modern functional search is essential. Universities are coming up with creative ways to help students quickly find relevant information like nearby campus housing, student life opportunities, and course catalogs.\n\nBig photos and unique imagery\n\nPhotography is key for painting a picture of the university environment. In addition to showcasing school buildings, universities should feature unique aspects of their campus, such as student life or activities, in an effort to capture a visitor’s attention and draw them deeper into the website.\n\nDesign inspirations from Higher Education Institutions across America\n\nThe University Of Texas At Austin\n\nThe University Of Texas At Austin (UTexas.edu), one of the country’s largest public research universities, is located in the heart of the Texas capital.
