        "text": "GOING WAY BACK: BLACK HISTORY DIDN’T BEGAN WITH SLAVERY We know that Black history didn’t begin or end with slavery. Yet, the way we’re taught about history in U.S. classrooms, the arrival of the first Africans in the colonies is the first most students learn of Black history. The African continent has been represented as a source of wealth for the rest of the world since the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade, and as a hotbed for conflict and famine when it ended. Rarely do textbooks delve into Black history before the slave trade, nor do they assess how that institution affected the entire continent. Educators should explain to students that Africa is a vast, diverse continent with long, complex histories and today comprises 55 recognized countries. Students should learn as much about the Mali and Benin empires as they do the British and Roman empires. Would they be surprised to know that the Mali Empire, once a large region in West Africa, was one of the world’s most powerful in the 14th century? That its ruler, Mansa Musa, is said to be the richest person in history? They might want to know that Timbuktu, an ancient Mali city, was a cultural, academic and economic hub for centuries. The Kingdom of Aksum, located in what is now Ethiopia and Eritrea, is considered one of the most powerful—a rival to the Greek and Roman empires. It was known for its language (establishing one of the first written scripts in Africa), architecture, trade with Europe and the Far East, and status as one of the first empires to adopt Christianity. In addition to the trade of valuable resources, a number of African empires gave the world unique art, mathematical and technological innovation, and appreciation for academic scholarship. An impressive review of African history can be seen in the PBS docuseries Africa’s Greatest Civilizations, hosted by scholar Henry Louis Gates.

Equally significant, what a time to be a candidate for New York’s 22nd Congressional District. I am teaching three courses this term: “Intro to the African Diasporic Experience;” “Methods and Key Themes in African American History Since Reconstruction;” and “Race and Racism in Public Health and Medicine.” All three courses respond directly to the hyper-politicization of Africana Studies and Crtical Race Theory. All three respond directly to questions that probe the absurd proclamation that Africans and people of African descent benefited from the Trans-Atlantic Slave System and plantation slavery in the Americas. History may be the study of the past but it rarely has anything to do with the past. The production and study of history almost always has an argument, or point of view. It almost always has to do with the present, and by extension-the future. History provides a narrative basis upon which contested claims for access to power, resources, citizenship, and recognition are made and often legitimized culturally, politically, and legally. Equally important, every person and every group has an origin story. We should embrace the study of human diversity-not criminalize it. #Onward towards ending MAGA extremism and hate in our democracy. Onward towards turning NY 22 blue.
