        "text": "The Marketing department uses two main typefaces in marketing materials: Akzidenz-Grotesk and Bebas Neue. Bebas Neue is reserved for headlines and subheadings, while Akzidenz-Grotesk (regular weight) is used for copy and bodies of text.\n\nAcceptable fonts\n\nBecause not every department on campus has access to Bebas Neue or Akzidenz-Grotesk, the following options for fonts are acceptable.\n\nOur primary colors are Purple (Pantone 2104) and White. However, we also have an extended palette of secondary colors to use throughout our Rock Solid marketing campaign. When printing materials, please use the CMYK color codes. RGB and Web color codes may be used for online and electronic materials. In order to build a consistent brand presence for the University, it is imperative that only approved colors are used whenever presenting the Rockford University logo; the logo may only be used in Purple (Pantone 266 or CMYK 79, 90, 0, 0), White, or Black.\n\nPantone 2104\n\nCMYK\n\n85, 100, 0, 0\n\nRGB\n\n82, 46, 145\n\nWeb\n\n522e91 CMYK\n\n0, 19, 79, 0\n\nRGB\n\n255, 206, 81\n\nWeb\n\nffce51 CMYK\n\n62, 16, 11, 0\n\nRGB\n\n90, 173, 206\n\nWeb\n\n5aadce CMYK\n\n0, 53, 100, 0\n\nRGB\n\n247, 142, 30\n\nWeb\n\nf78e1e CMYK\n\n58, 0, 100, 0\n\nRGB\n\n120, 192, 67\n\nWeb\n\n78c043\n\nOne of our most powerful tools to communicate our brand is our use of images. We strive to create compelling, emotional, and authentic images for all of our marketing pieces. Our use of imagery is strategic and connects our advertising collateral to each other. Throughout the academic year, the Marketing department will schedule photo shoots of students, employees, and alumni.\n\nIn addition, we will also utilize photos taken by departments and other individuals from our campus community. A photo and video release form is located on the Marketing page of the Rockford University Portal site. Please use it to obtain permission from people, both on campus and off campus, who are subjects of any pictures you or your department take. Once the form is signed, please send it to the Marketing department, so we can archive it in our files.\n\nWe have a gallery of general campus photos for our campus partners."
