        "text": "“A kind heart is a fountain of gladness, making everything in its vicinity freshen into smiles.” — Washington Irving During my days on campus this past month, there were some long hot lunchtime walks between the communications building (where I had classes) and the library. Fortunately the campus is gorgeous and well shaded with countless trees, …\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“I work hard in the orchard, not for the money anymore, but for something I can’t explain. Something worth more than money.”― Steven Herrick I have only faint childhood memories of occasionally picking fruit. I recall muscadines and plums, and the blackberries that grew in the wild bushes surrounding the pond behind our home. One year …\n\nContinue reading →\n\n…what though we suffer? Sun and skies And green trees’ beauty make our cares seem small; Boon that no Esau sells, or Crœsus buys, The golden summer-time, is over all. — Percy Reeve It has been a tough summer already, but not without happiness. There’s a joy in the season that can’t be totally quenched even …\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“Find a place where there is joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.” — Joseph Campbell What brings you joy?

Noll Sometimes, action is urgently needed and haste is imperative.
