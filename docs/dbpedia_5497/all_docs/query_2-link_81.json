        "text": "CAHS offers a flexible academic program with various college preparatory, advanced placement, and elective courses. Current advanced placement (AP) studio courses include World History, US History, Government, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Statistics, Language and Composition, Language and Literature, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Environmental Science, Psychology, Drawing, 2D/3D Art and Design, and Spanish. (Additional AP courses are offered through UC Scout.) Elective courses include sports medicine, anatomy and physiology, creative writing, art, graphic design, photography, video production, yearbook, journalism, drama, band, choir, play production, dance, engineering, leadership, woodshop, life skills, and others. Students also have the opportunity to take courses at a local community college for dual credit.\n\nCAHS Studio courses follow the quarter system. This allows students to focus on 3-4 courses at one time. Most courses are âaccelerated,â covering a yearâs worth of content in 18 weeks. Yearlong courses include all levels of math, advanced placement courses, physical education courses, and electives.\n\nVision\n\nWe believe learning best occurs when:\n\nClassical Academy partners with parents to prepare students to be Thinkers, Communicators, and Achievers. Students have the flexibility to choose an educational program that best fits their learning style. CAHS offers four educational programs across two campuses with all core CAHS curriculum meeting UC/CSU A-G guidelines. Students enrolled on either campus are eligible to participate in CAHS combined athletic and/or performance teams. Each campus offers its own student-led and initiated activities such as clubs, dances and other social events.Â\n\nClassical Academy High School - Studio Campus\n\n(207 E Pennsylvania Ave)\n\nStudio Program - 4 days on campus\n\nThe Studio Program is designed to serve students who would like to attend class in a traditional classroom setting four days per week (Tuesday - Friday) in an accelerated classroom environment. Studio teachers use lectures, small group interactions, labs, field trips, and projects to deliver an engaging and rigorous curriculum. Students in this program agree to exhibit respectful conduct and academic responsibility, including the timely completion of quality work and daily attendance. All core classes except for math and Advanced Placement (AP) are taught in an accelerated format of 18 weeks.Â\n\nClassical Academy High School - Personalized Learning Campus\n\n(130 Woodward Ave)\n\n3-Day WorkshopsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Full VirtualÂ Â Â Â Â Â Full Independent Study\n\nStudents at the Personalized Learning Campus have the most flexibility in blending classroom and independent study options with college prep coursework while maintaining respectful conduct, academic integrity, and the timely completion of quality work. Students who choose this campus prefer the smaller, more personal environment and the yearlong classes which utilize project-based and student-driven learning strategies in a customized learning platform. Students enrolled in any of the programs offered at the Personalized Learning Campus are able to participate in CAHS athletics and/or performance teams.Â\n\nThree Day Workshop Program\n\nThis program allows students who appreciate more structure and in-person instruction to attend a typical high school setting on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday with virtual office hours offered on Friday morning. Our award-winning and student-centered curriculum is provided via a customized learning platform through partnership with Gradient Learning and offers rigorous college preparatory course work. Each student will be assigned to meet with their mentor for a 15-minute check-in every week.Â\n\nFive-Day Independent Study Program - 2 Options\n\nFull Virtual Program\n\nThe Full Virtual Program uses E-Learning to offer online curriculum and virtual instruction with our credentialed teachers providing oversight and grading. Our college preparatory curriculum is offered to students via an engaging digital learning environment, which is available to students 24/7 for flexibility in scheduling. The student will work under the guidance of credentialed subject-area teachers and follow a rigorous curriculum that meets UC and CSU A-G guidelines. Course teachers will be available to the student via messaging Monday through Friday, and during Virtual Office Hours Fridays from 9:00 am to noon where students can check in with their teachers for direct assistance. Additionally, each student will meet with their Cohort Teacher for a 15-minute check-in every week.\n\nFull Independent Study\n\nOur Full Independent Study program is where the parent is the primary educator.Â An Educational Specialist will assist the parent with choosing curriculum.Â The parent, as the primary educator, will teach the curriculum, grade all student work, and provide documentation to the Education Specialist to support the student's progress.Â If the student meets all the independent study requirements, a CAHS transcript will be issued for completed coursework. While courses in the homeschool program are not considered A-G approved, many of these students are college bound and apply to community, private, and out of state colleges.Â Students who do not meet the UC/CSU a-g requirements may still apply through âAdmission by Exception.â\n\nCAHS Robotics Team (a.k.a. âTeam 3021: The Agencyâ):\n\nThe CAHS Robotics Team consists of students dedicated to establishing and enhancing their skill sets and knowledge base in relation to industry-standard robots. An Advisor and several mentors work side-by-side with the students to guide their efforts to complete real-world projects that apply robotics to actual problems and issues that cobots (collaborative robots) can address. The CAHS Robotics Team is open to any CAHS students interested in participating and willing to contribute their time and effort. Skills acquired during the year include computer-aided design (CAD), programming/coding, wireless networking, 3D printing, machining and utilization of tools (under supervision), electrical wiring, grant writing, and team logistics. Currently, the CAHS Robotics Team meets on campus on Monday late afternoons/evenings during the school year (subject to change). For more information, contact the current CAHS Robotics Advisor.\n\nEngineering Courses (Introductory and Advanced):\n\nIn addition to our after-school Robotics program, CAHS offers introductory Engineering (CAD/Fusion) and Advanced Engineering (Coding/Python) electives courses on campus. These two courses are open to all students, with no prerequisites or prior knowledge. For more details on these courses, please consult the CAHS Course Description Catalog and peruse the courses under Engineering.\n\nClassical Academy High School offers the following band and music programs.\n\nBand/Advanced Band\n\nThe Caiman Corps is a fully-featured instrumental music program that performs at pep rallies, home football games, and local and state competitions. The Caiman Corps has competed at the California State Band Championships and was a 2021 State Finalist taking 11th place. In the Winter and Spring, the program shifts to a combination of Jazz Band and Symphonic Orchestra programming. The band is offered as a performing arts class during the school day. Members are encouraged to explore a variety of instruments and are welcome to participate without previous experience.\n\nDrumlineÂ Â\n\nClassical Academy High Schoolâs Drumline is a competitive ensemble of marching drums, mallet keyboards, synthesizers, and guitars. The drumline competes in tournaments through the American Drum Line Association. This program is open to any student from any Classical or Coastal Academy campus through workshops and auditions each December.\n\nChoir\n\nThe Caiman Choir Singers learn music reading, vocal techniques, and performance concepts and participate in performances and concerts and festivals throughout the year. This program is open to students from both CAHS campuses."
