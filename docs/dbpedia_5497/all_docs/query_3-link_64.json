        "text": "Are you a creative type but want to avoid going the “starving artist” route? The answer to your dilemma may be found in an undergraduate art program. Associate’s degrees in art do exist and can be an option for some students. However, most serious art students eventually decide to pursue a bachelor’s degree program in the discipline. These four-year degree programs are often available through designated art schools or liberal arts universities. Students considering an undergraduate art degree can expect to study on campus for the most part. Though online and hybrid art programs are available, they represent the exception rather than the rule. Since hands-on learning makes up the core of these programs, they are hard to replicate in a virtual environment.\n\nIn this ranking, we explore the 100 best colleges for art majors at the undergraduate level.\n\nRating and Ranking Methodology\n\nTuition\n\nNet Price Below $5,000: 5 points\n\nNet Price Below $10,000: 4 points\n\nNet Price Below $15,000: 3 points\n\nNet Price Below $20,500: 2 points\n\nNet Price Below $25,000: 1 point\n\nStudent to Faculty Ratio\n\nLess than 20:1: 1 point\n\nLess than 15: 1: 2 points\n\nLess than 10: 1: 3 points\n\nGraduate Degree Opportunities in Art\n\nPresence of Master’s Degree Program – 1 point\n\nPresence of Doctoral Degree Program – 1 point\n\n20-Year Net ROI\n\nAbove $600,000 – 5 points\n\nAbove $500,000 – 4 points\n\nAbove $400,000 –3 points\n\nAbove $300,000 – 2 points\n\nAbove $200,000 –1 point\n\nAccreditation (School-Wide and Program-Specific) – 1 point per item\n\nStudent Support Services for Art Students—1 point each\n\nWow Factor: awarded for each unique feature or program that “wowed” us – 1 point\n\nRanking the Top Colleges for Bachelor’s Degrees in Art\n\nTo create this ranking of the 100 top schools for art, our editors gathered an initial list of 115 colleges offering undergraduate art degrees for less than $25,000 per year in tuition costs. We then applied a return-on-investment filter, eliminating schools with ROIs of less than $100,000. Finally, we applied the rating and ranking methodology above. In the case of a tie, we awarded the more affordable school the higher ranking.\n\n#100—Clarion University of Pennsylvania\n\nClarion, Pennsylvania\n\nWebsite\n\nStudent to Faculty Ratio: 16:1\n\nPoints: 7\n\nClarion University of Pennsylvania’s top college for art emphasizes real-world experience in the art industry.
