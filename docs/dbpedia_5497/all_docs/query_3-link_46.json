        "text": "Chesapeake based artist Eafrica Johnson has been painting since 2015. This self-taught artist finds interest in household objects, fruit and other common things. While painting from life with a limited color palette in oil or acrylic, she emphasizes light and shadow through simple compositions.\n\nEafrica is an award-winning artist, and has shown works all over Hampton Roads in places such as Thomas Nelson Community College, Suffolk Art Gallery, Virginia Beach Convention Center, D’Art Center and Hilton Norfolk the Main. She also participates in community art shows during the Summer.\n\nEafrica has been teaching Art since 2017 and is a graduate from Regent University with a Master’s degree in Education. She also received a teaching certificate from Old Dominion University and currently teaches Elementary Art for Portsmouth Public Schools.\n\nThoughts on the Art World: What is the best art advice you have been given?\n\n\"The best art advice I received was from the artist, Duane Keiser. Last year I attended his Premier Coup workshop in Wilmington, NC. His teaching style and painting techniques have given me so much liberation. He was the first artist to sincerely show and tell me that its ok to “wipe away” mistakes. These words are currently a natural part of my painting practices. Anytime I encounter difficulty with decision making, I move forward in confidence knowing that its ok to erase and start again.\"\n\nPictured: \"Downgrade\" (right) and \"Reflections\" (left)"
