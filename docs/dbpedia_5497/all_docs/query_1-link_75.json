Except Hitler was at least moderately successful as a politician, whereas Pat Robertson is a miserable failure.\n\nI would not go. I would pick another career before going to Regent. Even if that career was McManager. I probably would not hire anyone coming from Regent, but we're at least a decade away from me having any say in a hiring process that would affect you anyways. I'm sure I'm not the only one.\n\nIf you could live with the above, that's okay, to each their own. Do realize that I'm far from the only person that feels this way though. Doesn't mean you wouldn't get a job you love and be happy. Choose carefully is all I can say.\n\nKillerDiller - don't worry about deleting your post. I'll be inflammatory and inappropriate enough for the both of us (plus several more people if anyone else wants to jump on board).\n\nI try to stay quite professional on these boards, but this is one topic I have no problems cutting loose on.\n\nI can't say how people would actually discriminate when hiring, but I imagine this school should be a last resort.\n\nWe'll put it this way, if a school was founded by Hitler, and allowed someone to teach there whose \"research specialization\" was how to \"Normalize Jewish people and bring them into the proper non-Jewish way of living\" would you go there, even if it was a good school otherwise?

Except Hitler was at least moderately successful as a politician, whereas Pat Robertson is a miserable failure.\n\nCome on Ollie, Regent is APA approved and is therefore on par with other APA approved programs. The APA says so. You must accept this.\n\nI'm personally tired of everything under the sun being compared to Nazism and Hitler when people find it abhorrent but I understand the point you are trying to make in an educational sense. This after reading an article today on Nazi War camp brothel's.\n\nAs I said before, there are other religiously based programs (more so in a traditional sense than in training) that have great reputations. If you are going to spend that kind of money you might as well get a respected degree. If the best you can do is an online PhD from Regent start looking into different career options.\n\n*bites lip*\n\nSorry T4C, I will try to control myself.\n\nDave, I realize Pat R. isn't teaching psych classes. The point is that he started a university with a specific philosophy in mind for it, a philosophy that based on everything I've read about the school is still VERY much a part of the education there. And yes, I have been reading up about it while posting (we have slow days at work to thank for that), so for once I'm not talking out of my ass I happen to not just disagree with this philosophy, but feel it is unethical and a detriment to the field as a whole. That is of course my personal opinion, and one others are free to disagree with.\n\nSo I'm sorry if I offended, but I stand by everything I have said in this thread. I do believe someone graduating from Regent will have a \"tainted\" degree. Like it or not, the program seems more concerned with pushing a political agenda than it does with producing productive psychologists. I admit I am not religious in ANY way, but there are a number of religious institutions I wouldn't have any problem hiring a graduate of. This is not one of them.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of people are more concerned with trashing a program they don't like because one guy started it. But let's try to remember some things:\n\nThe university was only started by Pat R. While he may still have association with it, I highly doubt he teaches any of the Psych. program classes.\n\nThe school is APA accredited; granted, it is the Master's and PsyD program, not the PhD program, but it is APA accredited nontheless. That says something about the program.\n\nI have yet to hear anything from anyone who actually attended the University (aside form my prof., who is actually really bright, he may have just exagerated a bit with the initial numbers). Otherwise, some of your comments seem a little harsh.\n\nPoint taken, but on the topic of the APA accreditation, I happen to think that the APA sets a very low bar by accrediting some highly suspect programs. I'm not just speaking about Regent here. There are other schools and programs that are accredited that make me raise an eyebrow. Although you will run into roadblocks if the program you choose is not accredited, simply going to an APA approved school doesn't guarantee as much as it maybe should. (Side note, the APA does not accredit Masters programs, only doctoral programs).\n\nSecondly, it's true that nobody who commented on this thread went to Regent. However, if you were to graduate with a degree from there and seek employment elsewhere, you would be relying on the school's reputation among people who didn't go there. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nLastly, I'm sure Pat Robertson does not literally teach a class in the psychology program. Nevertheless, the school's foundation may very well impact the curriculum, especially considering that Regent is not a very old school. At the very least, the fundamentalist philosophies will speak to the undergraduate population there, and that will affect your teaching experience as a graduate student.\n\nPoint taken, but on the topic of the APA accreditation, I happen to think that the APA sets a very low bar by accrediting some highly suspect programs.

I can see your point about the influence from Pat on every aspect of the university, regardless of whether or not he is directly involved.\n\nDo you think that the fact it is fundamental has so much to do with the \"problems\" that exist there? What about other fundamental religious schools? What are some thoughts on that matter in general? If we were to get on the subject matter of Pat Robertson himself, what are some thoughts (beside the fact that many have likened him to Hitler)?\n\nAs an individual who knows quite a few people that have graduated through the program and am looking at it myself, this year out of the 25 people in their class, 24 got matched with their top 3 APA accredited competitive 5th year internships and the last one had turned a site down due to their non-apa accreditation that later became so.\n\nPat Robertson sure has founded the University -- but in no way, shape, or form does his speakings have anything to do with the School of Psychology and Counseling. All the professors foster a \"christian\" emphasis in treating each person with respect and dignity and in no way do they push religion on anyone. The most religious aspect of their classes is a non-biased, and \"christian\" reflection on various Psychological topics based off of your own feelings and thoughts and limits you may uncover in your clinical practice.\n\nThe APA actually loves Regent for all of their research -- even though some of the research is controversial (and Im not saying I agree with all of it), but the APA applauds their efforts to go beyond what other Universities wouldn't even look at. Most of the people that backlash the program take into account their own personal biases and feelings about the certain topics.\n\nThe program is a great learning environment, and I honestly have never heard of the distance program. They have a great on-site program, and the campus is beautiful. Also, when I visited, I met students of all religious backgrounds who stated that they never have felt any pressure to become christian -- heck their were two that don't believe in anything!\n\nLike I said, I've spoken with numerous students directly and they've said nothing but praise and excitment for their program -- being EXCITED about being there, which is more than I can say about a lot of programs I've visited -- most of the students I've met at other Universities complain and can't wait till it's over. I think the education is one of the most important parts.\n\nSo I understand some of your biases about Pat Robertson, and just because he started the University dosen't mean the program pushes anything he has to say .... it's APA accredited for a reason. The science def. comes first, then the inner-reflection later\n\nDon't bash things before you know them, it's ignorance.\n\nYou may notice I said I know very little about the program itself and was only commenting on its reputation. Reading their website, they do NOT come across as putting the science first. I mean, just reading their mission statement on the website it comes across about as far in the opposite direction as you can go.\n\nThat's the image they have decided to put forth. They have to lie in the mess they have made. If they had purposely distanced themselves from Robertson it would be another matter, but as I said above, there are TONS of references to him on the website and they seem proud of their affiliation with him. This may not say much about their program, but it DOES mean the word \"Regent\" primes the word \"Sexist\".\n\nDon't expect \"But its APA accredited!\" to carry much weight here. Many of us are convinced APA has completely lost sight of what is important for the field and no longer reflects our best interests. While student happiness is important, it takes much more than that to make a good school\n\nAs an individual who knows quite a few people that have graduated through the program and am looking at it myself, this year out of the 25 people in their class, 24 got matched with their top 3 APA accredited competitive 5th year internships and the last one had turned a site down due to their non-apa accreditation that later became so.\n\nPat Robertson sure has founded the University -- but in no way, shape, or form does his speakings have anything to do with the School of Psychology and Counseling.

The science def. comes first, then the inner-reflection later\n\nDon't bash things before you know them, it's ignorance.\n\nTheir application requires that you get a letter from a clergy member and the recommender form specifically asks, \"To your knowledge, has this person made a meaningful, personal commitment to Jesus Christ.\" The application also has a section that applicants need to review and sign stating their philosophy of education (specifying that it is a \"Christ-centered institution\") and a Standard of Personal Conduct that asks that you abstain from alcohol, illicit drugs, and tobacco.\n\nThey also have a Non-Discriminatory Policy that claims that their admission policies \"relate to [their] mission statement but are not applied to preclude a diverse student body in terms of race, color, religion, national origin or gender,\" so I guess it'spossible to attend if you aren't Christian, but why would you want to?\n\nAnd I have to agree with Ollie on this one. I would not attend a school where someone was studying how to \"convert\" black people into white people, and I find \"conversion therapy\" for homosexuals to be equally repellent. If you attend a university that supports that type of research, you are condoning it, and you will, deservedly, be judged for it.\n\nI have done a lot of researching into this program, and have talked to many of the students...\n\nI know a lot of the things they do are controversial, and I have had my doubts and asked MANY questions, but really and honestly, a lot of the students that go there aren't christian, and the program really does not bias people based off of their beliefs. The only \"christian\" type teaching like I said, they have reflections, a lot of which include how you would react to different situations, or what you feel about a certain topic.\n\nThe post before about being afraid if it's not scientific, every student requires a full-research based dissertation that they all work very hard on and most present at the APA. The program itself offers a lot of opportunities for growth, including a 2nd year program within the school of actually \"seeing\" clients (they have a full office space area just for this purpose with two way mirrors, cameras, and complete privacy for the clients) and you counseling those from the community that need someone to talk to, and a professor then meets with them as well, and you get feedback on how you are doing. Not a lot of programs I've visited offer this type of intense experience, most just have a 2nd year internship that they hardly gain actual experience into the clinical psych field,....\n\nPlus, as you gain experience, you also get experience doing testing on people within the community as well, and this ultimatley is the best type of experience bc it teaches you full standerdization and complete practice with giving free or very cheap tests to individuals who may not have a lot of money to afford them if they went elsewhere\n\nAnd I have spoken with plenty of students and they kind of laugh at Pat Robertson, he founded the school sure, and of course they all have to go with the christian foundings, (all of the professors ARE people of christ), but in no way do they push their beliefs on anyone, the program itself being Christian is more of \"fostering a good experience\" where everyone is valued!\n\nAnd Im telling you, honestly, and I really have had MANY questions about the school, and my future if I had went there, and Im still asking myself those, but the students that I have talked to, all are in amazing clinical settings for their 5th year internship, which you REALLY have to take into account, many at MAJOR university hospitals where they could only take 2 people out of hundreds that applied\n\nI just think other things need to be taken into account besides Pat Robertson when looking at the PsyD program, maybe even going there for yourself.\n\n\"The program itself offers a lot of opportunities for growth, including a 2nd year program within the school of actually \"seeing\" clients (they have a full office space area just for this purpose with two way mirrors, cameras, and complete privacy for the clients) and you counseling those from the community that need someone to talk to, and a professor then meets with them as well, and you get feedback on how you are doing. Not a lot of programs I've visited offer this type of intense experience, most just have a 2nd year internship that they hardly gain actual experience into the clinical psych field,....\n\nI have to agree with Ollie here. What programs were you looking at?! This is standard practice, this isn't an unusual specialized \"program.\" Myself and every person I know in clinical programs throughout the county (including \"big ten\" research schools like Georgia and Michigan) are videotaped and supervised closely by faculty when we start seeing clients (almost always at the university walk-in clinic/counseling center). Although research is stressed over a clinical work at these programs, all of them do outside externships at local hospitals and clinics during their training. This is standard practice, even for heavily research oriented Ph.D programs. Who gave you the idea that these things were unusual?\n\n\"Plus, as you gain experience, you also get experience doing testing on people within the community as well, and this ultimatley is the best type of experience bc it teaches you full standerdization and complete practice with giving free or very cheap tests to individuals who may not have a lot of money to afford them if they went elsewhere\"\n\nI really do not understand this paragraph, especially the \"full standardization\" part. Again, externships at outside agencies are common practice during 3rd and/or 4th years in all Ph.D/Psy.D programs. And yes, they are important for breadth of experience in both therapy and assessment/diagnostics. As far as giving \"cheap tests to individuals who may not be able to afford it\", I suppose you would get that if you worked a local community mental health center, (where service are provided on a \"sliding scale\") although the variety of disorders one would see in this setting would be very limited. Generally speaking, a quality externship is one that is either highly specialized (neuropsych clinic, PTSD clinic, etc.) or one that allows for seeing a variety of patient populations.\n\n\"The post before about being afraid if it's not scientific, every student requires a full-research based dissertation that they all work very hard on and most present at the APA.\"\n\nAgain, anyone can pump out meaningless empirical crap. There is enough of that in psychology already. Any school can \"do\" research, doesn't mean that its any good, right? What a good applicant should ask is, \"what is the nature and quality of the work that is getting done.\" Is it methodologically sound and furthering our science? From what Ive seen of the faculty and their short pub lists, nothing too impressive there. Second, dissertation is supposed to be high quality and research based, there is no other way to do it! Dissertations should be of sufficient quality for publication as well, presenting at APA is not very impressive honestly.Third, although some may have obtained internships at good academic hospitals, are they apa approved, and what is the overall match rate? (i.e., what are the chances of \"you\" getting one of those nice internships?) Being the good statistician, you have to take into account the base rates of the occurrence getting one of these good internships at this program. If the overall match rate is 50-60%, it can be done, but the reality is that, it's not very likely."
