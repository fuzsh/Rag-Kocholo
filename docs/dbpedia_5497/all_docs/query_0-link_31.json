        "text": "SUPPORT\n\nAt Regent, students, professors and staff come alongside each other to form a spiritual family. A diverse community of people from many denominations, cultures, backgrounds and callings comprise this family, all with an intentional focus on our shared Christ-centered values. Regent provides a number of opportunities for spiritual growth as well as well-being.\n\nChapel\n\nStudents, faculty and staff meet in the Shaw Chapel for a time of fellowship, worship and God’s Word at noon every Wednesday. Chapel features multi-denominational worship for students and faculty; allowing for many Christian faith traditions to be represented through creed, music and guest speakers. University Chapels can be watched live!\n\nUnchapel\n\nThe student body meets for UnChapel in the Shaw Chapel, creating a vibrant community of faith, hope and love for all Regent students — both undergraduate and graduate. UnChapel is a unifying worship experience with modern worship music, relevant teaching and an opportunity for prayer ministry at the end of each service. It is a Christian college experience that you will not want to miss! Regent students, faculty and staff are invited to watch some of our past chapels.\n\nConnect Groups\n\nLife is better together!\n\nIf accountability, discipleship and Christian leadership are important to you, Connect Groups will encourage your spiritual vitality. Our leaders undergo extensive training and receive ongoing support through Campus Ministries. Connect Groups are available to residential and commuter students.

Regent’s certified coaches help them to explore the change God has initiated, identify and overcome challenges, and put a plan into action. We want our students to be everything God created them to be.\n\nCounseling\n\nRegent Counseling Services provides free professional counseling to Regent students at the Virginia Beach campus. Services include individual counseling, group counseling, pre-marital/marriage counseling, assessments, and psychoeducational workshops.\n\nRegent University has contracted with BNC Services (formerly MBS Direct) to provide an online bookstore.

The online bookstore offers competitive pricing, upfront guaranteed buyback offers, rental options, financial aid credit, 24/7 customer support, and free ground shipping at the start of each term. *If you chose to use a refund credit, you are authorizing Title IV funds to pay for your books.\n\nLooking for a gift shop?

It can take 1-2 weeks for shipments to arrive.\n\nHow Do I Use Financial Aid?\n\nIf you have an anticipated financial aid refund, you will receive an email from Regent letting you know how much of your anticipated refund you can use as a credit/voucher in the online store. You will also receive an email from the online bookstore containing a voucher code that you must have in order to access the funds for your online purchase. Please note that financial aid credits will not be available more than 28 days in advance of a semester or session. The schedule of earliest dates of availability is on the financial aid website. Actual dates of availability depend on the particular session and the timing of a student’s financial aid application being finalized.\n\nCan I Still Use Military Aid (Vocational Rehabilitation, Virginia Army National Guard, Undergraduate Military Book Credit) To Purchase My Books?\n\nYes! For complete details on how to use your military-related benefits, please visit the VA Education Benefits website.\n\nHow Do I Get Customer Support Assistance?\n\nBNC Services online bookstore offers 24/7 customer support! You can contact them at 1.800.325.3252 or vb@mbsbooks.com.\n\nMy Employer Pays For My Textbooks. (Or, A Disability Agency Pays For My Textbooks.)

Give this to your employer and they can place a credit card order through www.regent.edu/regentbookstore, or submit the order with a check by mail to BNC Services, 2805 Falling Leaf Lane, Columbia, MO 65201.\n\nAre you a multi-talented student who’s looking to make the most of your college education and student life experience?
