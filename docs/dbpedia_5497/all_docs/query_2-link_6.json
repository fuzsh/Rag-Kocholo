        "text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, VA (April 30, 2021) – Regent University is pleased to announce the launch of renewed brand identity guidelines to refresh Regent’s corporate fonts, colors, logos, messaging, and positioning.\n\n“With an unwavering commitment to the mission of Regent and a renewed emphasis on its founding principles, we have updated Regent’s brand identity guidelines to ensure accuracy and consistency across the institution,” said Claire Foster, vice president for University Marketing & Public Relations. “We have rejuvenated Regent’s brand elements to reinforce continuity across a diverse array of digital and traditional media.”\n\nThe updated brand identity guidelines will be used to develop print and digital materials – including marketing collateral, advertisements, flyers, brochures, websites, social media, and other communications – for both internal and external audiences.\n\nRegent’s creative director, Glenn Geisendorfer, led the initiative to refresh Regent’s brand identity. “By focusing our branding, we aim to strengthen integration at scale and better reflect the vibrancy of our world-class university through its rapid growth,” he said.\n\nA printed copy of the renewed brand identity guidelines will be delivered to on-campus faculty and staff. A digital version of the brand identity guidelines – including logos, stationery, email signatures, and other materials – is also available for download at www.regent.edu/marketing.\n\n###\n\nAbout Regent University"
