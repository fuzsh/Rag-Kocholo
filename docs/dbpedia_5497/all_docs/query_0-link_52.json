        "text": "For the fifth consecutive year we had the pleasure and honor of welcoming and hosting the PG finance students from Universidad de Cantabria led by our colleagues Belén Díaz Díaz and Mariola Marco Wegner during their final academic trip. The group attended two training workshops: Financial Trading and Personal Branding co-delivered with Prof. Jonathan A.J. Wilson PhD DLitt . The delivery pedagogy was based on the Tech Simulation use, combining Art and Science to better meet the employment and professional world dynamic requirements. Quote of the day \"Learn how Make Money, Save Money and be liked like Honey!!!\" Prof the students seem right .... Spain are on the right track to go very in the EURO 2024 ⚽ Regent's University London\n\nWelcome to the lagre group year 1 Business students from our partner Paris School of Business from the visting Regent's University London and discovering the magic of #LONDON. In three hours I had the privilege to enjoy an imersive and intensive session of Creating Wealth and Value in Financial Markets. Students discovered the concepts; fundamtals and some theories of Finance. They read the news and analysed data. They used a simulator to work in collaboration and take relevant investment decision. Finally we all refelected in the exercise and we all agreed that tomorrow will be very different form today. Let's get ready then..... Thank PSB students you have been great and keep working hard in following your dreams....Yes studying business will help you to become wealthy but you need to be able to apply what you have learnt...that will make the difference .....!!! Enjoy your week\n\nToday at Regent's University London, The Regent's Difference Open Day was held. Prof (Dr) Zubin Sethna and I enjoyed the pleasure of meeting and welcoming the Business and Management 2024-25 candidates and some of their family members....It was all about how we are distinctice in our HE value proposition. It was about joining a family...The Regent's family where you can cultivate a possibilty. Many thanks to Abe Zakhem Xanthe Horsbrugh Kate Pringle and entire Recuitment and Admission teams and our Regent's Events.\n\nNot a better time as #COP28 week to host, welcome and learn from a Global Leader and a Change Maker in the world of Sustainable Finance Desiree Fixler. Desiree enlightened audience minds with a rich and an intense talk. Desiree developed an analysis that recommends the favours Critical Thinking rather than the Promotional Thinking. ESG spending vs Social Economic Impact. $30 Trillions spent vs 1 Trillion imoact !!! Phase Out or Phase Down? The shift from policy text writting to strategy and action. The importance of the conceptual framework ane established economic doctrine. What is the share and equity of each and finally the possible ESG bubble.... Desiree had also no hesitation in answering over the many questions prepared by our finance students who acted as a panel for this event. A massive thank you to Desiree for this second great contribution at Regent's University London that many us will surely remember. #sustainbility #esginvesting\n\nKadia your post and the satisfaction of your fellow peers are the reason of our actions. What you have written is one of our core objectives as a Higher Education Provider of specialist knowledge and relevant skills. At Regent's University London we collectively and inclusively aim to Cultivate Possibility, your possibility. We believe that cognitive knowledge to be applied would require a combination use of several disciplines, in order to critically test theory in practice and also observe what is being practiced (in market, business, economy,....etc) and try to find a rationale doctrine to understand. The two days Corporate Finance BootCamp with AmplifyME is just an example of that, where Financial, Numerical, Technology, Communication, Analytical, Personal and Psychological skills were all used and tested in a small practical experience. However, all that would not work if we did not the group of learners as our PG and UG Finance students like yourself that keen to learn and eager to be developed with a unique positivity....We are lucky to have you!"
