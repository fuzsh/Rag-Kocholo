        "text": "For Ellis Marsalis’ 79th birthday, I’m posting a feature piece that I wrote about him for Jazziz circa 2002, the interviews that I conducted for that piece, and a pair of WKCR interviews from the ’90s, on one of which he joined me at the studio with Jason Marsalis.\n\n* * *\n\nBy Ted Panken:\n\n“Jazz is about the art of discovery. Not discovery in terms of guesswork. You give a person a certain amount of information, and make sure that information is communicated. From that point, they begin to make decisions about that information. All you really need is the spirit of adventure, applied to the music that is being presented to you.”\n\n— Ellis Marsalis, June 2002.\n\nWidely known as the paterfamilias of a musical dynasty, Ellis Louis Marsalis, Jr. retired in August 2001 after a phenomenally productive 37-year teaching career on the high school and university levels. Ironically, the 67-year-old pianist, a professional improviser for half-a-century, never intended to make education his life’s work. Early tangents began to surface while the New Orleans native attended Dillard University between 1951 and 1955, moonlighting as a journeyman tenor saxophonist on local gigs with blues singers like Big Joe Turner and playing piano behind Big Maybelle and other singers at an Uptown boite called the Dew Drop Inn. Other possibilities arose during these years as he worked on and recorded original music with a peer group that included drummer Edward Blackwell and clarinetist Alvin Batiste, and later with saxophonist Nat Perrillat and drummer-composer James Black.\n\nAfter earning his Music Education degree from Dillard, Marsalis enlisted in the Marine Corps (stationed in Southern California, he spent off-hours in 1956 woodshedding with Blackwell and Ornette Coleman), was discharged, and returned to New Orleans where, in quick succession, he married Dolores Ferdinand, and fathered his famous sons Branford, in 1960, and Wynton, in 1961. With a young family to support, Marsalis today recalls that “the gig situation in New Orleans, which was never great anyway, had changed tremendously, with virtually no jazz — as we consider it — to speak of. I figured I might as well try to use my degree.”\n\nFrom 1964 until his retirement, Marsalis dual-tracked as a performer-educator. He took a position as band director at a high school in a small Louisiana town, serving until 1966. From 1974 to 1986 he taught and designed a curriculum at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), a multi-disciplinary arts magnet high school that students attended on elective from their home school. Marsalis’ pupils included his four sons — saxophonist Branford, trumpeter Wynton, trombonist Delfeayo, and drummer Jason – as well as Terence Blanchard, Donald Harrison, Kent Jordan, Reginald Veal and Harry Connick, Jr. In 1986 he left New Orleans to head the jazz program at Virginia Commonwealth University. He returned in 1989 to create the jazz program at the University of New Orleans, remaining there until his retirement.\n\nThe beginning of Marsalis’ teaching career coincided with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which abolished Jim Crow laws that had stood for decades. Living under statutory segregation, he had accumulated and processed the vocabulary of jazz “in a sort of shotgun approach — a piece here, a little there,” and could draw upon no codified pedagogy to teach it. At Dillard, he recalls, “We got the basis of European music, taught in a slapdash way, depending on who was teaching. The rules of the music department were modeled to be a kind of mini-conservatory, focusing on the things band directors are expected to do, with an abundance of courses in theory and almost no practical. So there was virtually no sound, formal training ground that emanated from a specific black tradition where you could learn to play jazz on the instrument. You learned just about everything on the job, because there wasn’t any place else for you to get it. Jazz was always second-class.”\n\nJazz continues to be but a blip on the collective consciousness of popular culture, but the idiom’s stature has evolved tremendously since Ellis Marsalis was a young man. Under the artistic directorship of Wynton Marsalis at Jazz at Lincoln Center, jazz enjoys equal institutional pride of place with classical music and opera at America’s equivalent of the French Ministry of Culture. Furthermore, dozens of universities offer degrees in jazz performance. Marsalis is one of a national cohort of pioneer improviser-educators (others include Donald Byrd, Jimmy Heath, William Fielder, and New Orleans colleagues Alvin Batiste and Kidd Jordan) who revolutionized the way jazz is taught, and his curricular first principles are seminal in the recent intellectual history of jazz education.\n\nAt NOCCA, Marsalis relied on those first principles while cobbling together a pragmatic, homegrown pedagogy designed to teach the building blocks of jazz and improvisation so that, as Wynton Marsalis puts it, “people can go out and get a gig, whatever kind of gig they can play.” “Whatever it is that I managed to do didn’t really come by way of a philosophy,” the elder Marsalis notes. “Mostly it happened by reaction. I heard a story about Thomas Edison. His assistant said they had done 150 experiments. None of the lightbulbs worked. He said, ‘Man, we ought to give up on this, because we’re making no progress at all.’ Edison supposedly responded, ‘On the contrary, we know 150 ways that do not work.’ We don’t always think about going to the things that don’t work as a path to finding what does.”\n\nLike a painter in medieval Europe who required apprentices to mix paints and prepare canvases before allowing them to wield a brush, or a master bata drummer breaking down the beats for an initiate, Marsalis taught with artisanal focus, forcing students to learn the skills of their trade before they can think about expressing their personalities through the medium. “You can get into a lot of trouble trying to figure out at what point it becomes art,” he reflects. “That becomes more philosophical than realistic. I’m concerned about whether these guys can put one foot in front of the other.”\n\nAsked how he would synopsize his method to a grant-bearing arts administrator, Marsalis responds: “Basically, it’s important to learn the three elements of music — rhythm, harmony, and melody, not necessarily in that order. We didn’t distinguish between European music and jazz. All the students at NOCCA had private instruction. New students learn two songs a semester. You apply those component parts to each piece, drilling on intervals, on individual notes, on the correct scales. Then, if your personality is suited to it, you work on the concept of improvisation.”\n\nMarsalis began his work at NOCCA by focusing on the blues. “Learning how to play blues is like mastering the fundamentals of arithmetic before moving to algebra, trigonometry, and calculus,” he says. “It’s the simplest approach to learning improvisation. I would write out 12 measures of chords that, when played, turned out to be a blues. They got the sound of the notes in their ear, and got their fingers used to the positions. They got a tangible manifestation of the form of blues in one chorus. The chord symbols represented vertically sounds they would deal with in a linear manner. And they’d be sensitized to the rhythmic flow, to deal with music in motion.”\n\nEar training is crucial. Marsalis insists students internalize the fundamental building blocks so that transcription and memorization of classic repertoire will become a more organic process. “Without the oral component of music, you take away its natural ingredients,” he says, lifting an analogy from his bottomless well of metaphors. “It’s like the difference between preserves and fresh fruit. Preserves tend to taste the same; you can get them whenever you want. But the apple on the tree will be there only so long. In the same way, a solo only exists in the moment. The students who really pursue this have to learn that the concept of a solo is not unlike a novel or short story, with a beginning, a developmental section, a peak, and ultimately a climax or ending. The more references you can draw on, the more possibilities you have.\n\n“Too much academic description can make a student lose the ability to hear certain subtleties. Someone might analyze a solo by discussing its technical components, for instance, that so-and-so used this scale and that scale and another scale – but the person who did the solo wasn’t thinking about that at all! It’s bad enough you’re listening to a recording, which can remove the essence of what was actually going on. There’s a story that somebody was talking to Earl ‘Fatha’ Hines about the recordings of Art Tatum, and Fatha Hines said, ‘Man, forget the recordings; you got to have been there!’ It makes you realize that whatever analysis you apply to this music is inadequate in terms of what was actually going down.”\n\nBREAK\n\nWith his utilitarian bent, Marsalis is a lineal descendent of such mid-century African-American teacher-autocrats as Walter Dyett from DuSable High School in Chicago and Samuel Browne from Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, whose programs produced dozens of outstanding jazz musicians from Marsalis’ generation. Eschewing the authoritarian methods by which they kept students in line (Dyett was legendary for the accuracy with which he hurled his conductor’s baton at erring students), Marsalis won hearts and minds by treating his charges as young adults with minds of their own, as individuals accountable for their actions and decisions.\n\n“Ellis encourages and motivates his students, but he’s also direct and won’t pamper you,” says Victor Goines, Director of Jazz Studies at Juilliard School of Music. A 41-year-old New Orleans native, Goines studied privately with Marsalis in the ’70s, apprenticed with his combo in the ’80s, and has played saxophone and clarinet in the Wynton Marsalis Septet and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra from 1989 until the present. “With me, he could be painfully truthful, but also compassionate to my needs as a young man. If it sounded bad, he didn’t pull punches. He was for real.”\n\nGoines borrowed a number of Marsalis’ dicta in creating the jazz program at Juilliard, beginning with the notion that working musicians are the most effective teachers. “Ellis brought to the classroom experiences from the oral tradition he’d learned as a performer, as opposed to learning the theory of education in the classroom and trying to go out and play after the fact,” Goines says. “He believes that working with small ensembles is important because of the freedom for improvisation. Students need to have perspective on the music’s history. They need to be able to function in different idioms, and to always realize that you’re not preparing for the gig you’re doing now, but the unknown gig to come. Ellis puts you in situations that you have to work your way out of. He always told me that to try to get to something great, you have to be willing to take chances, to make a fool of yourself. He said that you shouldn’t get on a bandstand with someone you wouldn’t get in a foxhole with; if everyone isn’t working toward a common goal, it’s a waste of time. He even teaches you to take care of the business aspects. He covered all the aspects of what it takes to be a professional musician.”\n\n“I was shocked as a kid the first time I went to his school, and heard his students call him ‘Ellis,'” says Branford Marsalis. “That just didn’t happen in the South in the ’60s and ’70s. Later I understood how hip that was. My pops was just having a dialogue with the students, to the degree of almost demystifying education. He points the finger and forces you to think for yourself. He twists standard American colloquialisms so that they make more sense to him. He’d always say, ‘You know, son, you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him thirsty.’ That’s brilliant! Once he told a student to listen to a piece of music. The student said, ‘I don’t want to.’ ‘Why not?’ ‘Man, I know what I like.’ My father said, ‘No, son, you don’t know what you like; you like what you know.’ I thought about it, and realized that in order to say that you know what you like, you have to know a helluva lot. What he was getting at is that you should study the music for your own sake, not just because he tells you to. If you don’t, you’re putting yourself behind the 8-ball.”\n\n“My father’s first principle is, ‘You don’t know unless you know,'” says Wynton Marsalis. “Don’t assume anything without first-hand experience. Don’t get chord changes out of the book; get them off the record. He always gets you to question what you know. He stresses that there’s no right or wrong way to hear. He’d guide you in a direction, but he wouldn’t tell you what to do. He gave you the opportunity to figure out your own thing.”\n\nFor a teacher to give students that much rope demands not only self-confidence, but tremendous faith in human nature. An unflinchingly realistic man devoid of illusions, Marsalis is explicitly not religious. To trace the source of such fundamental trust is therefore an intriguing endeavor.\n\n“My father believes in jazz — real jazz,” Wynton Marsalis declares. “He never believed that jazz was White or Black. He believes it’s a universal expression, a thing that brings whoever addresses it into contact with their greater self. He doesn’t suffer from cultural intimidation. He’s very clear and uncompromising that you have to face jazz — or J.S. Bach — on its own terms, not change the music or put it on a lower level so you can feel comfortable in your relationship to it. If you practice and learn what you have to — and have the ability — you can play it. If you don’t, you can’t.\n\n“The foundation of how I teach — what I think and know — comes from watching him. Long before we even had Jazz at Lincoln Center, when I was 19 and 20, I did workshops and went in the schools, because I saw my father doing it. The way to conduct a workshop, to present material, to pick tunes to play, to use analogies to make something clear, the importance of teaching form, the central position of the rhythm section in the band — all these concepts come from him.”\n\nFor all the inherent optimism implied by his lifelong struggle to communicate jazz values, Ellis Marsalis is not exactly sanguine about the present state of things. “The schools are teaching jazz with a conservatory approach, nice clubs are cropping up, and jazz is now a respectable area to function in,” he says. “But mainstreaming it removed a lot of individuality. Listen to the saxophone players in the conservatories that have good jazz departments. All of them can play! But when they solo, you can’t tell them apart.”\n\nWhat case, then, would Marsalis make for talented musicians to study jazz in school?\n\n“I don’t necessarily think they should,” he responds. “Jazz is a highly individualistic art. You’ll do better with a good private instructor and being around people who are well versed in the style of music you’re trying to play. Actually, there’s no real reason why anybody should continue to play jazz at all, aside from the music speaking to you. But more and more, I think that the study of jazz, across the board, can help a musician or lay person better understand America, because the music reflects the whole of the citizenry so completely. In some ways, jazz is a form of glue that keeps American culture centered. We live in a world where people do not necessarily even have to have a skill to become rich and famous as a pop artist. So a disciplined approach to anything is something this country very much needs.\n\n“I often think of America as a 10-year-old kid whose folks died and left him a candy store, with nobody to guide him. He goes into this candy store and proceeds to be a 10-year-old kid. If he’s not unfortunate enough to get diabetes and die, he’ll ultimately learn, after he gets a bellyache, that there’s something to know when you got this place. It’s not just, ‘Oh, great, this is mine.'”\n\nNo longer teaching in any capacity, Marsalis is focusing on his retirement, making decisions about his future involvement in education. He works most Fridays at the prestigious Snug Harbor club in a trio with youngest son, drummer Jason, and leaves town for occasional jobs. In the autumn he’ll release a self-produced trio CD on ELM, his own label, and will go in the studio to record several CDs worth of material. In his manner, he’ll continue to do what he can to help that 10-year-old grow up.\n\n“My father never preached,” says Branford Marsalis. “And he never wasted any time trumpeting his strengths. He was always interested in addressing and eradicating his weaknesses. That’s something I believe in. The great thing he passed on to us was to always go for something you like, because it’s about expanding, not finding your little place in the box and staying there.”\n\n[—30—]\n\nINTERVIEWS:\n\nEllis Marsalis (6-24-02):\n\nTP: Some nuts and bolts questions. Are you still teaching, or are you now retired from any institutional affiliation?\n\nMARSALIS: No, I retired August 10th, 2001 from the University of New Orleans.\n\nTP: So you’re retired for a year. Are you still teaching in any capacity?\n\nMARSALIS: No.\n\nTP: So your artistic focus is on being a piano player.\n\nMARSALIS: I’m focusing on my retirement.\n\nTP: How are you spending it?\n\nMARSALIS: Well, first getting used to it. I started putting some unfinished portions of things into my computer, which is something that I’ve been slowly learning about doing. Because the program can be very difficult. But I’ve got some gigs. I usually play every Friday night at a local club called Snug Harbor.\n\nTP: That’s the top club in New Orleans, isn’t it?\n\nMARSALIS: Right. And I go out occasionally. This summer we have a couple of grandchildren who are staying with us, going to some summer camps. So I’ll be here doing that; my wife and I will be taking care of that.\n\nTP: When did you begin to teach? How long have you been teaching? What were the circumstances? Was it the NOCCA experience in the mid-’70s?\n\nMARSALIS: Well, not really. When I graduated from Dillard University.\n\nTP: So way before the 1970s, then.\n\nMARSALIS: Yes. I didn’t really want to teach, but eventually I went into the military and got out, and got married, and the gig situation in New Orleans, which was never that great anyway, changed tremendously, and as a result, I figured I might as well try to use the degree I’ve got. So I started to teach in 1963.\n\nTP: In what situation?\n\nMARSALIS: It’s hard to really describe. Because I went in to be like a music teacher, and they never had a band in there at the school. What happened, I ended up with two or three science classes and some general music classes, with one period to develop a band. So I stayed there for a year, and I said, “Well, I know I need the money, but I’m not going to cripple people because I need the money.” And I didn’t know nothin’ about no science! So I left there, and I started teaching in a small Louisiana town, Browbridge. I was band director there for a couple of years.\n\nTP: Is that when you started to develop a pedagogy?\n\nMARSALIS: Yes, I would say. Definitely.\n\nTP: By 1964, you’re an established musician in New Orleans, such as the scene was, and you’d been playing professionally for a little less than 15 years.\n\nMARSALIS: Wait. When are you talking about?\n\nTP: Let me see if my chronology for you is correct. You’re born in ’34. You go to Dillard when, about ’51 to ’55. You go in the Army in either late ’55 or early ’56?\n\nMARSALIS: No, I was in the Marine Corps in ’56.\n\nTP: You spend a lot of that time in California, and it seems that your military service wasn’t so arduous as to prevent you from playing music.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, basically, that became my job.\n\nTP: So you’re another one of the people who got to play music as part of their Service duties.\n\nMARSALIS: Right.\n\nTP: And you get back to New Orleans around ’58 or ’59, and you start to have your children, and because the economic situation in New Orleans was what it is, you start to teach. And in the mid-’60s, you’re teaching in that high school in Browbridge.\n\nMARSALIS: Right. ’64 to ’66.\n\nTP: In one of my earlier conversations with you, you spoke about how you learned, about your formative process, that you started playing clarinet when you were 11, started playing tenor saxophone in high school, did a lot of rhythm-and-blues gigs, and you were studying the piano, and that when you got out of high school you decided to be a music major, that Dizzy Gillespie turned you on, a bunch of things turned you on. You said: “I had been studying with a really great piano teacher. Of course, studying piano at that time either meant that you were learning from a mentor in the church that you went to, or you were learning from someone who was either in your family or was a friend of the family that would teach you the tradition of the music according to earlier styles, or you studied with a piano teacher who basically was teaching formal approaches to European music.” You said that you weren’t playing in the church, which was to your regret, and you didn’t know anyone who was really playing piano from a traditional jazz point of view, and you gravitated to the two areas that were closest to you, being Rhythm-and-Blues and Jazz, and I guess some European tradition — which you’re not saying here — with that piano teacher.\n\nMARSALIS: I didn’t really study with her long enough to develop a repertoire. I studied with her maybe about a year or so, and then I started at the university. And I couldn’t put it together to continue studying with her. Her name was Jean Coston Maloney. You see, I couldn’t put that together, because if I had thought about it and had figured it out, I could have continued studying with her. But I said, “Well, I can’t study with her and be a music major over here at the same time.” I said, “When I graduate, I’m going to go back and start studying with her.” Of course, by that time she had left town.\n\nTP: Would you say you had a good music curriculum at the high school that you attended?\n\nMARSALIS: No. There was no music curriculum. There was none at all. There was the marching band and the concert band.\n\nTP: What was the level of instruction that you received in that band? How was learning done?\n\nMARSALIS: Well, that school was in transition at the time, and in fact, it closed my sophomore year. And the band director, who had really been great, left the year before I got there, and went off to Southern University to direct bands there. So what we did was sort of limp along. The last part of the year, we didn’t have a band teacher at all. We just did it ourselves. So I didn’t learn much about music at all in high school.\n\nTP: I see. Because I’ve talked to a few of your contemporaries from New Orleans, like Clyde Kerr, and I gather his house was a focal point for a lot of like-minded musicians.\n\nMARSALIS: Yes. That was true with Clyde. Clyde, Sr., was a music teacher also.\n\nTP: Were there any teachers in New Orleans who were equivalent to the great black high school teachers of segregation days — such as Walter Dyett or Samuel Browne or the woman at Cass Tech in Detroit — in inspiring musicians of your generation?\n\nMARSALIS: If I had to pick somebody, it would be Yvonne Bush. There’s a book coming out which is going to be very interesting, and she’s featured in that book. In fact, the guy who wrote the book, Al Kennedy, had in his first printing of it a chronology of all of the people that she influenced. It was one of those pullouts. Now, I don’t know if Scarecrow is going to keep that. I mean, it may make it and it may not. But Yvonne Bush is one of the people that I would tend to think was close to what you’re talking about. She was a trombone player, and I think she had spent some time playing with the Sweethearts of Rhythm during their later days.\n\nAnyway, Clyde Kerr… There was also a younger guy named Alvin Thomas who helped a couple of guys. But he died young. He was younger than me. He was still in high school when I was doing my (?). He was also one of the students of Yvonne Bush.\n\nTP: But in the process of learning the vocabulary of jazz and the tools that you would need to be effective, how did it operate before you went to college? Was it totally informal, like you and Alvin Batiste would get together and take down solos from records? I know a lot of people from your generation were very homegrown, but then, other people had substantial formal instruction. And given the subject of this article, I’m interested in how you accumulated and processed vocabulary.\n\nMARSALIS: In a kind of shotgun approach. Some here, a piece over there, a little bit here, a little bit there. Because once I decided that I was going to be a piano player, one of the things that I didn’t know was the dimensions involved. That is, if you are a tenor saxophone player, you play the tenor saxophone, but you may have studied the chronology of saxophone players who played your instrument, so you get a pretty good understanding of who came before you. But when you’re a piano player, the significance of being a piano player is that you wear several different hats. There’s solo piano, which Art Tatum scared everybody to death with that. Then there’s the trio piano playing, the stuff that Oscar did and various other people who played. Then there’s playing piano in a rhythm section, which is one of the things that you end up learning to do because of working conditions. Usually, all of the piano players at some point end up playing in a rhythm section. And the accompaniment role, in some cases, if you happen to be in a group with a singer. And it’s all different. And there was nobody there to tell me that, so I just learned it as well as I could.\n\nTP: You made a comment in my second radio session with you that accompaniment is the most difficult thing to teach.\n\nMARSALIS: It really is. It shouldn’t be. But the reason why it’s so difficult to teach is because music programs are not structured in a way that the vocalist and the other instrumentalists are taught in a complementary manner. By “complementary” I mean this. If a person says, “Well, I’m interested in playing jazz piano,” unless you have a singer who is interested in singing jazz in accordance with the tradition in the same sense that that piano player understands their role, you don’t have a thing! You see?\n\nMost of the metaphors that I used when I was teaching was through athletics. I would tell the students various things, especially when Jordan was still playing. I would try to get them to focus on learning melodies to a song, make sure you know what that melody is. If there are words to that song, at least learn the first verse to it, so that you see how those words connect with that melody. The harmony is a part of that. Learn that harmony the way that the guy wrote it, so when you hear the alterations from other people, you have a reference point. Know the rhythm so that you understand what category the piece falls in. It may be a Rhumba or a Congo or a Bossa-Nova, or it may be a ballad, or it may be up-tempo. I used to use Michael Jordan. I said, “When you look at him, what you see is somebody who has developed every facet of the game, whether it’s his defensive play, or his ability to shoot around the perimeter, or it’s the various ways in which people develop moving the ball around, the free-throw shooting…” Like, all of the aspects that go into the whole of the person.\n\nMusic teachers rarely teach like that. The reason that music teachers rarely teach like that is because you have too many people involved, and they only hired one music teacher, and that music teacher is expected to teach a band well enough to go out on a halftime football show. So it can become very difficult to try to deal with subtleties when it’s just you and 100-and-some students.\n\nTP: How did you deal with that when you were at Browbridge?\n\nMARSALIS: I didn’t deal with that. I had a concert band which I dealt with, and then the football season. I had somebody who could do the little halftime steps and all that, and teach the band that, and go out and do the halftime football show. Basically, that’s it.\n\nTP: At Browbridge.\n\nMARSALIS: Right.\n\nTP: And at that point, would you say that by the age 30, you had developed pretty much the pedagogy — given, of course, the various refinements and elaborations over time — that you continued to teach? Or did it springboard you into developing that pedagogy?\n\nMARSALIS: See, it’s hard to answer that, because I didn’t pursue teaching sort of like in a straight line. Like someone who wants to be a doctor. You may end up being a surgeon or internal medicine or a podiatrist. But you still go in a straight line. But see, I wasn’t really that interested in teaching, and when I left Browbridge, I came back and started playing in the Playboy Club, and I stayed there until such time as… I mean, the job in and of itself was not really going anywhere. It was a good job, playing six nights a week. But I wasn’t satisfied with it.\n\nTP: Not artistically satisfied.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, not really, man. It was a jazz gig. It wasn’t like you had to play something other than that. But even if you’re playing jazz, if what you are playing isn’t really saying anything… And then, it really wasn’t my group, so to speak. So even though I was playing every night, there was little or no chance to do anything with them or with anybody else. Because the city at that time had just moved away from legal segregation — maybe two years earlier, in 1966. So it was a city in transition, and there were still a lot of older clubs and older musicians playing, and a lot of younger guys coming in who were bringing a different brand of funk to what they were doing. There was virtually no jazz — as we consider it — to speak of. And there wouldn’t really be any straight-ahead stuff until, oh, much later.\n\nTP: Let me step back to Dillard and address the way the curriculum you received there affected the musician you became.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, what about it?\n\nTP: Let me put the question to you this way. Do you feel you received a solid music education at Dillard?\n\nMARSALIS: Not really. It was a small school, a private school, and the emphasis was on the nursing school, which had a very good reputation, and also on education. Because heretofore, teaching and education degrees were areas that college-minded Black students could go into and get a job as a schoolteacher. So the idea of performance was ludicrous. At the time, I didn’t really know that was the way people were thinking who were administering the school! So what we got was really the basis of European music, and in some cases, taught by people in a kind of slapdash way. Not everybody. It just depended on who you got. It was modeled, so to speak, kind of after a poor man’s conservatory — which most of them are.\n\nTP: You mean most of the black colleges during segregation?\n\nMARSALIS: Well, most of them were anyway, even the ones that weren’t Black. The thing is, your primary customer… For example, even at the University of New Orleans today, the primary customer is one who is going to be in music education. So consequently, what you get is all of the rules that are set up in such a way that resemble a mini-conservatory. So many hours on your major instrument, so many hours on the minor instruments, all those kinds of things that they expect band directors to do. And for the most part, courses in theory. In a lot of cases, you have an abundance of theory classes and almost no practical.\n\nTP: Whereas people like Yvonne Busch and Walter Dyett and Samuel Browne were extremely practically-oriented and performance-oriented.\n\nMARSALIS: I imagine so. But it’s kind of hard to tell. I used to talk with Eddie Harris about Walter Dyett, because Eddie studied under him. And I talked a little bit with Joe Williams about the Colonel, from Wendell Phillips High School in Chicago. He went under a guy who had been a Colonel, I think, in the Army.\n\nTP: The guy at Wendell Phillips was Major Clark N. Smith, then Dyett succeeded him, then Dyett went to DuSable when the school was founded in 1935.\n\nMARSALIS: Yes, it must have been the Major.\n\nTP: He had the Chicago Defender Boys Band, which Lionel Hampton came out of. I think he was a no-nonsense Marine, like you!\n\nMARSALIS: Also the school in Detroit, Cass Tech, where Donald Byrd… A lot of those cats went to Cass Tech. See, we didn’t really have schools like that.\n\nTP: Oh, I’d been under the impression that one of the black high schools in New Orleans had a good music program. I guess I was under the wrong impression.\n\nMARSALIS: How long ago?\n\nTP: I was thinking the late ’40s and ’50s, but my memory may be incorrect.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, when people say that so-and-so had a good music program, you don’t ever know what that means! I had a guy that told me he was going into the studio down here, and he was trying to get some musicians, and he heard that St. Augustine High School had these great musicians and this great music program, and he got some of them kids in the studio. I knew what he was trying to do, and I didn’t call him on it, but he was trying to get over cheap. But anyway, he got those kids in there, and they didn’t know jack! They’re not being taught any of that. They’re a marching band, and their reputation is that. But a lot of times, people don’t really know. They look at these situations, and they’re not involved in music, and go, “Oh, this is a great program.”\n\nTP: One thing that occurs to me is that in thinking of people like Dyett and Samuel Browne and these high school music programs through which talented young black musicians emerged and were prepared to become skilled jazz musicians in the period when segregation was operative, there was a certain type of pedagogy and a certain type of attitude and a certain type of world view that was conveyed that helped these musicians function. Looking at you from the outside, I see your work as very much in a continuum of that, granted, of course, that you were doing it in a different time. So I’m fishing here to see if this sort of attitude stuck to you and informed your perspective on your own teaching.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, by the time that I started to teach music in high school at the New Orleans Center of Creative Arts, which was a different school… There was no marching band. There was no band. There was no core curriculum of math or science or any of that. This was an arts high school that students went to, using their elective from the home school. You could not graduate from the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts with a diploma that was recognized as anything. In other words, you had to go to the regular certified high school that taught math and science and English and history, and then half-a-day, you would study your discipline. Now, a discipline at NOCCA could be dance, theater, music, visual arts, or creative writing. And we had a faculty of artists. So the curriculum was designed by the artists for young people who would anticipate becoming professional musicians, dancers, singers, whatever. That was the greatest faculty that I was ever on. There was only three of us. That faculty was fantastic. I learned as much as the students did.\n\nTP: Was that you, Alvin Batiste and Kidd Jordan?\n\nMARSALIS: No-no, not at all. Alvin was teaching at Southern.\n\nTP: He wasn’t teaching there at all.\n\nMARSALIS: No. Alvin was the artist-in-residence, I think, for the Orleans Parish School system. So when that school opened, Alvin called me, and told me that they were opening up the school, and that it would probably be good for me. By that time, I had already gone and started taking courses at Loyola Graduate School, and wasn’t interested even in interviewing for the job. Because I had developed a plan, a modus operandi, which took me to graduate school, and I wasn’t sure I wanted to veer away from that plan. But I did go and interview, and eventually they hired me.\n\nSo I was able to function on a great faculty. It was Bert Braud, who was also an instrumental music teacher, and also a vocal teacher, Lorraine Alfaro. One of the things that we didn’t really do was to emphasize or make a distinction between European music and jazz. All the students had to study. All the students had private instruction.\n\nTP: I gather you had a grant, and members of the Symphony were teaching for the amount of the grant.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, not always. They would take the grant, and sometimes the students would have to supplement the grant. But it wasn’t a lot of money for the level of instruction. The grant was about 8 bucks, and the symphony people at that time were teaching for $12 for the students. But it was a marvelous opportunity for them.\n\nTP: Would you say, then, that your pedagogy developed through the imperatives of setting up a curriculum for NOCCA?\n\nMARSALIS: That’s right.\n\nTP: So you get your first class or your early classes, and what do you present them with?\n\nMARSALIS: When I first started there, I hadn’t a clue as to how I was going to approach this. But invariably, I just started with teaching students a lot of blues. Then I’m trying to pick standards that I knew related to a particular instrument. For example, I knew that just about all of the trumpet players should be expected to play “I Can’t Get Started With You” and tenor saxophone players would be expected to play “Body and Soul.”\n\nTP: You broke down those tunes and they had to show…\n\nMARSALIS: They had to play them.\n\nTP: Did you give them recordings to listen to, or first principles that they should follow?\n\nMARSALIS: If I had them. Yeah, I would do that if I had them. We eventually hustled up some money and bought some recordings. Also, we bought some old Collins speaker. They might still be in use, man! Clyde Kerr was using the same speakers, and doing…kind of piecemealing what we could do. But I was very big on the practical side of playing.\n\nTP: How do you mean the practical side?\n\nMARSALIS: That’s it. Play.\n\nTP: When did you ascertain that a student was moving in the right direction? Was that through your knowledge as a working jazz musician? I’m thinking about criteria, the right thing and the wrong thing.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, the right thing and the wrong thing is easy. Because one of the things they had to do was be able to play scales. Either you understood and played the right ones, or you didn’t. And if you did, I’d work on the concept of improvisation, which is not something that’s suitable for everybody’s personality. But there are ways in which you can get people to improvise if they are susceptible to that process. When I say susceptible, what I mean is that some people are just not comfortable with the process of improvisation. If it’s not written on a page or instructions that come from on high or whatever, they are just not comfortable improvising.\n\nTP: So when you found someone who you determined had talent… I assume that given the type of students who were coming in, you were able to take very individual approaches with each of them.\n\nMARSALIS: Yeah, but not because of who was coming in. Mostly because of the way it was structured. Because we just got public school students, period. Whoever came to audition. We didn’t know who was talented and who wasn’t.\n\nTP: I did a piece earlier this year on Harry Connick that was a cover story in “Jazziz,” and I talked to Branford about him. He said this: [ETC.] “…if you walk in the room, my father says, ‘okay, why are you here?’ Virtually every other teacher would say, ‘Turn to page 13. Okay, that’s great. Come back next week and give me another $100.’ My father is like, ‘Why are you here?’ ‘I’m here for you to teach me.’ ‘What do you want to learn? I don’t know.’ ‘Come back when you’ve figured it out.’\n\nMARSALIS: [LAUGHS]\n\nTP: I said, “What do you think Harry wanted to learn?” He said, “I don’t think Harry knew, and that’s what my father wanted to get to — what is it you want to learn?” He says he doesn’t know what you taught him, he and Wynton would rough him up and go outside, but he assumes you would do studies on the blues because that’s what you made piano players deal with first, blues and rhythm.\n\nIt seems that so many people who have studied with you are able to access the maximum of potential from themselves, and I’m interested in your philosophy of dealing with people, particularly at that very sensitive time in their lives, when things can go in so many different directions.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, I don’t know that I had even developed a philosophy. See, the thing that I remembered, that I fell back on, is that when I was in elementary school, in the early elementary school, first through sixth grade, that [things were done by drill] ….[END OF SIDE]…. We had English classes, we had math class, and in all of those classes, one of the key components was drill. So when I started teaching at NOCCA, I began to use that aspect. Because it stuck with me. You just drill on something and you drill on it until they get it. And it wouldn’t matter…\n\nSee, this is another thing. It wasn’t so much about whether somebody was into jazz or classical. The drilling aspect had to do with whatever the subject matter was at the point that you were teaching. Because I was also responsible for teaching Classical students, not just what we call jazz students, and I had to develop a sight-singing class which everybody had to take. The biggest part of that that I used was drill — drilling on intervals, drilling on individual notes, drilling in all of that. Basically, you concern yourself a lot with whether or not somebody wants to be a certain thing. Like, I would ask students, “Give me an example of a model or somebody that if you could be like that, if you could sing like that or play like that…who would it be like?” And you would use that sort of as a guide of trying to figure out how they were thinking.\n\nBut I think what Branford was talking about was usually private teaching. Because you can’t do that in a school! Now, one of the things that we used to do also was make students responsible. You see, one of the major problems with public school education today is that, from what I can see, students are never responsible for anything. You don’t have to be responsible. I just read in the paper the other day where this woman in a town, she and 12 other people just resigned, plus the principal, because they wanted her to change the grade. The parents were calling up all hours of the night… What it was is that she gave an assignment, and 23 of the students cut-and-pasted their way over the end of that, and turned the papers in, and she could see what they had done. So she gave them all zero, and got in a lot of trouble because of that. Because nobody wants the students to be responsible.\n\nBut that was one of the things we had that was in our favor. We had a principal at NOCCA whose discipline was theater. His name was Dr. Tom Tews. The only thing he asked us to do was, “Just tell me what you’re doing,” because he didn’t want to be blind-sided by somebody coming up to him saying that the faculty is doing something he didn’t know nothing about! But we had unlimited opportunities to restructure what we were doing curriculum-wise, and change it around to meet the needs of the students that we had — just to do a lot of things that were flexible. But we would make students responsible, even when the parents would come in hollering and screaming. And I think that’s basically what the problem is right now. They’re not allowed to be responsible. Then they get out in the world, and there it is! But that’s a whole other story.\n\nTP: It would seem that a magnet arts school, where you have motivated students, would be well suited…\n\nMARSALIS: Well, that’s a myth, see. The whole idea of having very motivated students comes either after they get there and discover that there’s something they can develop if the platform is suitable for their individuality. Otherwise, the motivated students usually get turned-off at school. Because schools do not emphasize individuality. And when people become motivated, they become motivated as an individual.\n\nTP: Do you emphasize individuality?\n\nMARSALIS: Oh, we had to. That’s the only way an arts school can work. You cannot herd an art school and have it really work effectively.\n\nTP: Donald Harrison told me that Kidd Jordan would call him at 8 in the morning to make sure he’d done what he was supposed to, that he’d take extra time and so on. Did you take a role with students outside of the school?\n\nMARSALIS: Not a lot. Well, I had a lot of other responsibilities. If it was something that I could help them with and it took some extra time, I’d find that.\n\nTP: Let’s get through NOCCA, and start talking about… You started teaching at the University of New Orleans when?\n\nMARSALIS: 1989.\n\nTP: So the timeline is, you’re at NOCCA from 1974 to what year?\n\nMARSALIS: ’86.\n\nTP: Then you go to Virginia Commonwealth.\n\nMARSALIS: Right.\n\nTP: That’s where Victor Goines and Clarence Penn and various others come under you, then you get a faculty position at the University of New Orleans.\n\nMARSALIS: Yes, but that’s not really so much true for Victor Goines. See, Victor was a kid that I knew along with my kids when he was still in high school. He didn’t go to NOCCA. For a while, he was at Loyola. Before he graduated from Loyola University, he started to study privately with me. And eventually, I just put him in my band. Because I had a quartet. The band went on a Southeast Asian tour in the month June of 1986, before I left to go to Virginia Commonwealth. Because see, Victor was teaching math at St. Augustine High School. After I left, he decided that he wanted to come up and go to graduate school! That’s what he did. But to tell you the truth, while I was at Virginia Commonwealth, I never had any classes that Victor was in.\n\nTP: So there are three different categories. There’s the New Orleans public schools, the Catholic schools, and there’s private tutelage. So musicians in New Orleans coming up would go through any combination of these routes.\n\nMARSALIS: Yes. There was also the total practicum, like the kids who went to the junior high school and learned some basics, and then put a band together and went out on the street, and opened up their cases, and started playing for the tourists.\n\nTP: Which is something that’s distinct to New Orleans.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, a lot of places, they’ll put you in jail if you play on the street. You can’t just play on the street. But in New Orleans, that’s a different town. They may have some restrictions by now. But man, a lot of people were playing on the street, some who now have careers!\n\nTP: Kidd Jordan disapproved of the effects of that. He said it sort of stifled the urge to learn or expand or explore. In a broader sense, how do you see the impact of the vernacular aspect New Orleans music and the Caribbean tinge of New Orleans culture on the way musicians develop and evolve and think?\n\nMARSALIS: Well, for the most part, I think it’s all economic-driven. I mean, those people who call themselves music teachers in public schools… It’s economically driven. If there were no jobs out there, they would not subject themselves to four and five years of college training to get a degree not to work. And these kids get an early start, especially from some of these junior high schools with these brass bands. Now, I don’t think that it’s anathema to learning at all. I think kids get turned off by adults very early in life. It’s not the music that’s causing them to do that. It’s the mere fact that there’s nothing going on in the schools. If there was something going on in the school, they wouldn’t quit. Or if there was something happening musically, they wouldn’t want to… For example, Terence Blanchard was going to John F. Kennedy High School. A marvelous band instructor over there. I mean, this guy was great — the concert band. Well, he played in that concert band while he was a student at NOCCA, because there was something going on over there.\n\nBranford went to de la Salle, and the music program over there was okay. But Branford was talking at one point about going and being a lawyer or something. Which was all right with me. I didn’t care. But it didn’t appear to me that he was doing what he needed to do to be at the school. So we came to the mutual agreement that he ought to leave that school and go to the one of the public schools, and then just attend NOCCA and study the music for the remainder of his high school time.\n\nTP: So to you, the cultural thing in New Orleans where the younger musicians play and the oral tradition aspect is a very positive thing.\n\nMARSALIS: Of course.\n\nTP: Could you elaborate a little on why it’s a positive thing?\n\nMARSALIS: Well, mostly it’s positive because, first of all, it’s economically driven, and the kids who do it generally need whatever monies they can come up with. It also promotes a certain amount of teamwork, because it means that these kids have to organize themselves into a functioning unit with virtually no adult supervision at all. That’s another thing. And that skill is a very useful skill for anybody or any group of people to learn early enough in life. The next thing is, they begin to understand a friendly relationship with the general public. When you go out there on the street and open up your case, there are things that you can get to learn. You learn what people will put money in the case to hear you play, and probably they don’t want to particularly put their money in… In other words, if you’re out there and you have a group, and your group was playing some Bach chorales with a brass ensemble, the amount of money that you get is going to determine whether you keep playing that. Now, if you keep playing “When The Saints Go Marching In” and people start putting money in the box… I mean, it don’t take a rocket scientist to figure this out! So these kids go out there immediately playing “When The Saints Go Marching In” or some other piece like that. Now, it’s anybody’s guess to assume that at some point they will have wanted to play some chorales of J.S. Bach. We don’t really know. And a lot of people say, “well, if they wouldn’t have been doing that, then they would be learning this over here.” We don’t really know that.\n\nThere have been numerous times… There was a wonderful band teacher who passed on, named Donald Richardson. Donald Richardson had a junior high school, and he was totally devoted to his kids, and when they would graduate from that junior high school, if they went to a high school and that high school didn’t have a challenging band, the horns were in the case, the case went under the bed, and they went and did something else. So we can’t make the assumption that kids have this undying need to learn certain kinds of music.\n\nTP: What kinds of music?\n\nMARSALIS: Any kind. Anything that would be considered by the people who make those statements as challenging.\n\nTP: There’s a quote in an article I saw on the Web from Jason Marsalis that instead of telling a musician everything, you tell them just enough so they’ll discover certain things on their own.\n\nMARSALIS: Yes, I think jazz is really about the art of discovery. And I don’t mean discovery in terms of guesswork. What I mean is that give a person a certain amount of information, and you have to make sure that that information is communicated. Then from that point, they have to begin to make decisions about that information. And like I said earlier, not everybody has the personality to improvise.\n\nTP: What sort of personality do you need to improvise?\n\nMARSALIS: All you really need is the spirit of adventure, and it’s applied to what your understanding is of the music that is being presented to you. Because it’s very easy, man. I did a workshop, and I can’t remember where it was, but it was a guy who had a band; there was a whole room-full of students in there, and it was just me and this little raggedy piano. And I developed a way where I could give a kid maybe five notes, and play some little things on piano. If you just play those five notes any way you want to play them, you can’t go wrong — except if you don’t play at all. This one kid was playing vibraphone, and I said, “I want you to try it.” Oh, no. He was real shy. And his fellow students started to encourage him. So finally, he decided that he’d try it, that he’d play, and I backed him up as he played. And about ten minutes, man, we couldn’t shut him up! He wanted to play the rest of the workshop! Now, I don’t know that he had an opportunity to do that before. He didn’t act like he did. But he didn’t even want to try. So you don’t really know.\n\nTP: So half the battle is breaking down the resistance to trying.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, if it’s in the personality. There was a young man who was a trumpet player, and he came into the class. And I could not communicate with him what it took for him to experiment in improvisation. It didn’t appear to be in his personality to want to do that. I mean, he tried and he wanted to do it. He went on eventually, man, to become a principal trumpeter in the symphony orchestra. So the musicality was already there.\n\nTP: Let me get back to what Branford said you do with piano players, and what you said you did initially in NOCCA, which was deal with the blues. Now, there’s no established pedagogy for the blues, certainly not when you were beginning 27 years ago. How did you organize your principles of teaching the blues?\n\nMARSALIS: See, what I had to do… It reminds me of dealing with a kid with Play-Dough. What you do is, you give him the play-dough, and you say, “Here, take this and make something out of it.” I would write out some notes which, when played, would be 12 measures of the blues. So they could do two things. One, get the sound of the notes in their ear; the other is to reposition their fingers in such a way that they would play when they would practice. Their fingers would get used to those positions. I have one exercise where it was just the left hand, another exercise where it was both hands, another exercise where it was the left hand with some different chords. But it was all based on the blues. And there again, it’s just a matter of drill.\n\nTP: A matter of drill and then their personality accepts it or it doesn’t.\n\nMARSALIS: Yeah. Well, with the piano players it could be a little different. Because with the piano players you’ve given them notes which basically outline a whole form. It’s a different thing with a piano player. The piano player still has to do the same thing from an improvisatory standpoint. But what you do is, you give them all of the notes in the beginning.\n\nTP: Would you say that your experience as an improviser informs your teaching and the way you relate to students?\n\nMARSALIS: Yeah, definitely. First of all, it helps me to understand a lot better what it is that I’m trying to get them to do. Because if I can’t improvise myself, there’s no way that I’m going to be able to teach them. But see, what causes one to be able to teach, and somebody else to be a great improviser and maybe not be able to teach, is that they don’t necessarily do respective thinking about what they are doing so that they can convert it and create a language to communicate that. Because all of teaching centers around a language. How could you teach Medicine if you don’t have a name for the principles. It’s the same thing.\n\nAnd a lot of times, the problem… Well, I don’t know if it’s the problem or not. There is not a codified language for jazz. There are some things, the blues… But “blues” is a general term. It’s not by any means as specific as, say, the heart would be if a doctor studies medicine. That’s very specific! But what I’m saying is that we have to have enough terminology so it can communicate what the essence is in terms of studying jazz improvisation.\n\nTP: In one of these things I saw on the Web, the writer describes you asking a trumpeter if he knows “Caravan,” the student replies that he has the sheet music, and you say that “the sheet is always secondary — always.” Does jazz continue to be an oral music in any manner? And how do you deal with that quality within the prerequisites of teaching within an institution and a curriculum?\n\nMARSALIS: Well, the thing about jazz being an oral music is that if you don’t have the oral component of the music, what you will have done is taken away the natural ingredients of it. It’s sort of like the difference between preserves and fresh fruit. See? Like, if you could walk up to a tree and there are some apples on that tree, you can pick an apple, and you can eat that apple. Now, there are people who learn how to make preserves, and in most cases, they always taste the same. And you can get it whenever you need it. But the apple on the tree is only going to be there for so long. Like the solo. I mean, if somebody plays a great solo, if you’re not there when they do it, then you won’t hear it. If it’s a recording, you hear sort of a replication of it. Which would be like the preserves. Which is why the term “preservation” comes into play.\n\nTP: That’s a very interesting metaphor.\n\nMARSALIS: But that’s basically what it is. And any student has to develop an understanding of what a solo really is. Solos are not unlike a novel — or a short story. You have a beginning, you have a developmental section; you have a point or a peak; and then ultimately you have a climax or an ending. Solos are like that.\n\nTP: To what extent do you give students vocabulary from other players as part of their repertoire? A process a lot of people do, maybe you did this yourself with Oscar Peterson or Bud Powell, is the imitation of solos and an understanding of how master artists organized vocabulary in different periods. Is that important to your curriculum and pedagogy?\n\nMARSALIS: Yes, but I don’t like to academize it. See, students spend so much time with academic descriptions of things, until they begin to try to put everything in that category, and they begin to lose the ability to hear certain subtleties. I mean, it’s bad enough you’re listening to a recording, which can sometimes take the essence away from what was going on. It reminds of something I read that Earl “Fatha” Hines said. Somebody was talking about the recordings of Art Tatum, and Fatha Hines said, “Man, forget the recordings thing; you’ve got to have been there!” That’s a whole other level of experience in that music. Students have to learn, the ones who are really going to pursue it, that the concept of a solo is in the development of it, and the more references that you have to draw from, the better possibilities you have of a solo.\n\nTP: To extrapolate on that Fatha Hines quote, “You have to have been there,” it’s becoming increasingly hard for younger musicians to be there in terms of at least of expressing the older vocabulary as expressed by the people who created that vocabulary. Is there any contradiction in there?\n\nMARSALIS: How could it be a contradiction?\n\nTP: It could be a contradiction, because if someone is dealing with getting the sound of Jelly Roll Morton together, such as Eric Reed, who dealt with it functionally in the LCJO, he wasn’t there to witness it, but he dealt with it in a real-time situation. One thing that’s often noted by younger musicians is at once the increasing options of vocabulary available to them and the increasing distance from the people who created that vocabulary.\n\nMARSALIS: I know what you’re saying. Well, the point is this. There again, I use metaphors in athletics. The same could be said of Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson. Those who were there when Magic was doing what he was doing, got the experience that those who were not there didn’t get. Now, it doesn’t mean that those who were watching Kobe Bryant cannot appreciate the game, the style of play, which essentially was a part of the same thing that Magic was doing. But I think what happens with music is that it becomes so academic. When I say “academic,” it becomes like the analyzation of a solo in which somebody starts talking about the technical parts of it, and the scale, and how he used this scale and that scale and another scale — and that’s not what the person who was doing the solo was thinking about at all. I’ve also used as a metaphor that it would be like if somebody asked a student to do a book report, and when they got ready to do the book report, they’d stand up and say, “Well, the person who wrote the book led off with two prepositions, three nouns, two adjectives, followed by a period,” and go through that whole thing. Now, if you want to analyze the sentence structure, that may be true. But I doubt very seriously if that’s what the person who wrote the story was thinking about. And it’s a similar kind of thing with music.\n\nSo when Fatha Hines said that you had to have been there, I mean, that’s one of those things that sort of vibrated sympathy. Obviously, he couldn’t have been where Tatum was, but it expressed something that makes you realize that whatever analysis you apply to this music is inadequate in terms of what actually was going down.\n\nTP: How important is it for students to know about the milieu in which the music was going down?\n\nMARSALIS: It’s important totally. There again, it’s the same thing with athletics. I mean, the average kid, when he comes into the NBA today, he knows about the City Game! They know about the City Game. Kareem knew about the city game. All of them!\n\nTP: Well, Kareem was part of the City Game!\n\nMARSALIS: So what I’m saying essentially is that what a lot of students don’t get, in some cases, is the academic complement. I think if you can get an academic complement, so that the experience becomes total…\n\nTP: But the way I mean the question is: Is it important for a kid who is marching in brass bands and is then going on to further musical education to understand, let’s say, the historical origins of brass bands, how marching bands might relate even to customs in Africa, as you once described on a radio show we did. Is that sort of well-rounded knowledge essential to a contemporary aspiring jazz musician?\n\nMARSALIS: Yeah. I was listening to one of those guys in a brass band doing an interview. And one of the first things he said when a young guy came into the band… He said, “The first thing you’ve got to understand is that this is part of a tradition, but when you come here, you don’t come here with no strange attitude.” And he wasn’t talking about music to him. What he was talking about are those things that are peripheral, those things that put some meaning into that.\n\nI remember Wynton made a statement to me one time, and he was waiting for me to rebut him. He started talking about bebop. He said, “man, bebop brought a negative element into the music.” And I said, “Yeah, you’re right. It did.” And that’s a generation that I was a part of. And the reason why that occurred had as much to do with the recording industry as it did with anything else. Because in the recording industry, technology advanced to a point where people could begin to play longer and longer and longer. When you go back and listen to Charlie Parker…\n\nTP: Three minutes.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, maybe five.\n\nTP: He has the famous quote, “If you can’t say all you have to say in two choruses, you’re practicing.”\n\nMARSALIS: That’s right. So essentially, what happened is that another negative element… Well, actually, I don’t necessarily consider that a negative element. When they started to emphasize the whole drug scene. Well, that has to do with something else. I mean, whoever controls the press decides what’s going to get in it. And if anybody was paying attention, the amount of jazz musicians interested in drugs wouldn’t even register 0.000-whatever. So that element I didn’t consider.\n\nTP: I think in bebop it was a pretty consequential element. I’ve been doing articles on people like Jimmy Heath, who had that experience. I spoke to Frank Wess on Friday for a piece, and he said one reason music today is better than it was then is that the musicians then dissipated themselves in an almost commonplace manner, and today that isn’t the case. I think that’s a fact about at least a lot of the musicians of the time, for better or for worse.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, it’s not so much that that’s not a true statement. But I don’t know that that could be proven. I’ll tell you the reason why I say that. First of all, there are peripheral factors involved. When I say “peripheral,” let’s take, for example, the first fifty years, from 1900 to about 1950-ish. The total economy of the jazz musician was gangsters. There was no other economy. Now, that managed to produce a lot of fantastic players in spite of the fact that that was the situation.\n\nNow, as great as some of the young players are today, the democratic process that goes on with the schools teaching jazz and some clubs coming along, and… Like where I work. It’s a nice club! The situation is conducive now to make jazz a respectable area to function in. In reality, it has lost a lot of its individuality as a result of that. Because when you mainstream something… Everything has a good and bad side.\n\nTP: It’s a dialectic.\n\nMARSALIS: Right. But when you go back and you start listening to all them tenor players, man, from Chu Berry on, and people who were lesser lights, like Eddie Lockjaw Davis, and…\n\nTP: To some, he is not a lesser light.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, when I say “lesser light”…\n\nTP: I know what you mean.\n\nMARSALIS: Believe me, man, Jaws was a personal friend of mine. I loved Jaws and I worked with Jaws. I listened to Jaws play some introductions, man, on his own… [LAUGHS]\n\nTP: I’ve heard people from every sphere of music talk of him, like how did he get those sounds with the fingerings he used?\n\nMARSALIS: The only reason why I said “lesser light” is because Lockjaw Davis never forgot that he was in show business. He could never have been a John Coltrane attitude-wise. He was never that. So that level of dedication was not going to be there. And it was the same thing like a Charlie Parker, who spent an enormous amount of time practicing, trying to figure all of this stuff out. Jaws was a product of the times! He was going to be representative among the players who was there. He was the straw boss of Basie until he couldn’t… He and Basie philosophically fell out. But what I’m saying was by no means saying a lesser light…\n\nBut when it comes down to it, when you listen to these kids, you hear them and you say, “Oh, man…” My youngest son, Jason, is very responsible for some of these younger kids, and he’s almost like a senior to some of them. The reason why is because Jason has learned the importance of researching the older guys, so he can tell a young drummer about Dodds! About Baby Dodds! See, he’s already researched that. He can also tell them about, “Look, when you’re getting ready to present a solo, this is what you do.” He did a session just recently with Curtis Fuller, who was in New Orleans during Jazzfest. When Curtis got ready to play a ballad, the producer was saying, “Look, this is just with piano, bass and trombone.” And Jason immediately knew what the problem was. He didn’t say nothing. So when they started playing, Jason got behind the drums and started sweeping. So this guy said, “Yeah, man, that’s hip. Not too many young guys can even play brushes at all.” But see, he knows that. And he knows about people not knowing the technique of playing brushes. And he also understands when it started, and the whole ball of wax.\n\nSo I’m saying all of that to say that it is necessary that young kids understand and learn all of these things, because otherwise it becomes kind of like a guitar player, a kid who came to NOCCA when I was teaching there. He was a senior, and usually we didn’t take seniors, because it was too late. I said, “Look I’ll take you, and whatever I can do for you in a year, I’ll do. Play the electric guitar.” I put some records on to let him hear that. I put George Benson on, and the recording George Benson made of “Paraphernalia” with Miles. When the record was over, I said, “Well, what did you think?” He looked real bewildered. He said, “I don’t know, man. All I ever thought there was to Benson was ‘Breezing.'” So consequently, what you get is a bunch of kids who just don’t know! Because there’s been nobody there to say, “Hey, man, if you’re playing tenor saxophone…”\n\n[END OF SIDE 2]\n\nTP: …among black musicians was the notion of having your own sound, above and beyond just about anything else, in many ways.\n\nMARSALIS: Essentially, that was one of the things that contributed to the fact of whether you were going to work or not.\n\nTP: So again, it’s economic.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, that was one of the factors. It wasn’t just the only one. But the thing is, there was no uniformity. You go up to Eastman. They’ve got a great music department at the Eastman Conservatory. Look at the cats in that band. I mean, there’s a conservatory approach to jazz. All the saxophone players got the same sound. And they can all play! And you listen to these guys playing a solo, and you can’t tell which one is what! There is no individuality, man.\n\nAnd having your own sound has as much to do with… I remember Jug told me, Gene Ammons told me… See, Gene Ammons went to school under Walter Dyett. Gene Ammons said, man, “When I went to study in the band, the first thing the dude did was gave me the mouthpiece, and I had to play that for a month. Then I got to the neck, and I had to play that for another month or so. Then finally, I got the horn.”\n\nTP: Von Freeman told me the same thing.\n\nMARSALIS: Yeah! He said by that time, what you do is develop a sound. In some cases, it’s not so much my sound as much as it is a sound. Because when you start to play jazz especially, you hear differently than what happens when you study classical music. And even with Classical music, there are people who have individual sounds with that, even though you’d have to be really attuned to hear them.\n\nTP: Well, connoisseurs can tell Michelangelo Benedetti from Pollini, or Dinu Lupatti from…\n\nMARSALIS: Michelangelo Benedetti was one of my favorites, especially for French music.\n\nBut for the most part, I think that’s one of the things that sometimes people misconstrue when they say “my sound.” Everybody’s got a sound. Because once you learn how to play that instrument, whatever comes out of it is going to be your sound anyway.\n\nTP: I’m trying to circle around to an ending. How, within your pedagogy, did you give students that imperative of developing your own sound? Is that just implicit within what you give them?\n\nMARSALIS: Essentially it is. Because I never had them for that long. That’s the one thing you’ve got to realize about teaching in a high school.\n\nTP: But now I’m talking about college, too.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, college is totally different. See, the thing about college and universities, you get students in clumps. If you’re teaching an improvisation class, you get all of the students that’s taking that at that time. Now, they’re studying their instrument with somebody else. You see? And if you happen to have a combo that you’re teaching, there are some things you can pass on to them in that context. That’s teaching a combo. But that individual approach is not there nearly as much. Because by the time you get to the university, you have to spend a lot of time, hopefully, in dealing with refining what’s there.\n\nTP: But do you use the same principles in dealing with your university students as you did with your students at NOCCA? Is what you did at NOCCA the building block for the Ellis Marsalis way of teaching?\n\nMARSALIS: Yes, definitely.\n\nTP: Let’s say I’m some administrator giving you a grant. How would you boil down your principles for me? The one or two minute synopsis.\n\nMARSALIS: Basically, it’s important to learn the three elements of music — rhythm, harmony and melody, not necessarily in that order. And you apply that to each piece that you play.\n\nTP: Since you only took ten seconds to answer: How are you going to go about giving it to them? Through drill?\n\nMARSALIS: Yes.\n\nTP: It’s all drill.\n\nMARSALIS: Yes. You can really study two songs a semester, and teach everything that you need to teach in that given semester.\n\nTP: What two songs would those be?\n\nMARSALIS: Any two songs that have to do with the form. Like a 32-measure form, AABA… It doesn’t matter. Because all of them are going to have rhythm, harmony and melody. It’s a busy-word(?) concept to give somebody 25 songs to learn. I was telling my colleague that. He said, “Man, they ought to learn 25 songs at a minimum.” I said, “But what are they going to play on those songs?” You take one song and say, “Okay, here is the verse, here is the melody, this is what the harmony is.” Now, the first thing you’ve got to do is learn how to play each of those component parts. And it takes time to do that. Now, you multiply that by ten, and what time do you have? You don’t have no time. You’re scuffling, trying to make some arbitrary deadline.\n\nTP: So you really are like Walter Dyett and Samuel Browne in a lot of ways.\n\nMARSALIS: I hope so. [LAUGHS]\n\nTP: You really are. I’m glad I’m not imposing some rigid thesis on you. One final question. What do you think of the state of things in jazz now? We’re talking about some negatives, like maybe lack of individuality among young musicians, but overall, what’s your sense of the state of things as opposed to 15 years ago, when you started at Virginia Commonwealth, or 28 years ago, when you started at NOCCA?\n\nMARSALIS: Well, those are very short periods of time. I think that jazz ultimately will become a major part of the cornerstone of American music. I just heard a trio… This was a classical group. I think all of them went to Juilliard, and they were playing a piece by one of their contemporaries, who is a violinist, who has been playing with a Rock band, and is now composing music, and has been playing violin with Ornette Coleman. It was piano, cello and either violin or viola. When they started to play his piece, I could hear “Lonely Woman,” man, in the beginning theme of it. That’s the direction that the music is going in. And the people who are going to make the biggest contributions towards it are the same as it was in Europe as composers.\n\nTP: When you say “that’s the direction,” do you mean Ornette Coleman or do you mean the hybrid?\n\nMARSALIS: The hybrid. That’s it. It’s going to be like this violin player, the bluegrass player… He’s written a composition that’s very interesting, too.\n\nTP: A young guy?\n\nMARSALIS: Not too young. He’s younger than me. Top of the list. Top line. The representative of that. Well, anyway, I’ll think of it.\n\nTP: Another aspect of the hybrid is all the musicians internationally who are coming here with substantial idiomatic knowledge of jazz and bringing their own cultural information to the table. I’m thinking particularly of musicians from all over the Caribbean and South America. And it seems to me that the rhythmic template of jazz, things that were maybe esoteric 10-15 years ago, are no longer esoteric. Do you perceive this internationalization of the music, that it’s incorporating more information at this point?\n\nMARSALIS: Of course. That’s the way that is. That’s why we get terms like “globalization.” I don’t think music is the only representation of that. I think whatever you see is happening in terms of economics, in terms of the market, in terms of trade… There was a big thing in the paper here yesterday, they’re trying to make a deal between France and New Orleans to build a super-port. So it’s all-inclusive. That’s what I’m saying. It’s not really a separate thing.\n\nTP: So the world is smaller, people can transcend the particularities of their locale, and you can get anywhere in a day, that sort of thing?\n\nMARSALIS: That’s right.\n\n[-30-]\n\n* * * *\n\nEllis Marsalis (7-01-02):\n\nTP: Virginia Commonwealth was your first university position?\n\nMARSALIS: Correct.\n\nTP: What was the situation when you arrived there, and what did you do?\n\nMARSALIS: There’s different layers to that. First of all, there’s the idea of moving to another state at that time in my life, and a lot of pressures that it brought on my wife. That’s one situation. Then not only was it beginning a job, but a university job in a program that was rather young. They had a jazz program when I got there, but it was not totally defined in any strict way. The band director, Doug Richards, was probably the best jazz band director that I had ever seen; he could really get a tremendous amount out of a jazz band. But there wasn’t anybody there who really wanted to actually head a program. In other words, we had a whole lot of soldiers and no real chiefs. The faculty was a very able faculty across the board. There were 44 people on that faculty, most of whom were in classical music, but it was not an antagonistic situation. So there were things I had to get used to.\n\nBut it’s one of those things that the more I did it, the more I found out that it wasn’t that much different than teaching at NOCCA. The reason for that is that when you teach in a typical high school, there’s an adversarial situation between the administration, the teachers, and the students which is built in. And the laws of any given state do not permit you to treat the students as really the way they are. They’re really like young adults who have intelligent. But the various state laws don’t permit you to function with them like that.\n\nTP: As young adults.\n\nMARSALIS: Right. So teaching in the average high school, they have virtually no real responsibility that’s allowed. All the classes are like herds. you go in one herd to Class A, and then to the math class, and then to the history class, and then at some point you go home.\n\nNow, at the university, there’s a lot less pressure from that end, because the students decide what they take and what they don’t take. So it creates a different kind of pressure, if you will. Because students who go into high school are going mostly because they either need it as a means to get somewhere else or because it’s mandated by the state after a certain age. At the university, when a student chooses to go to a university, they do so because they think that it’s going to affect their lives in some way. So the way that we taught at NOCCA, it was very much like a college, even though it wasn’t a college, because the students that we would retain were students who had shown a determination towards performance at a professional level.\n\nTP: Did they tend to sort themselves out? How did you ascertain that they were ready for that?\n\nMARSALIS: Well, it isn’t a case of them being ready for it at all. It’s a case of them making a decision based upon what was asked of them, whether or not they wanted to pursue that particular discipline as a career. There were five disciplines at this school. Then what they had to do was to look at it and make that decision. And encouragement for professionalism was always there. At the average high school, band directors would never tell students in the band that they could be professionals, unless that person was a pro himself and would sort of pick somebody and put him in a group with them and say, “Look, if you want to, you could probably do this.” Because in most cases, teachers who teach in high schools… I remember something that the chairman of the music department told me at Virginia Commonwealth, which I really thought was tacky. He said, “Most of the people on this faculty are failures.” I said, “What do you mean, they’re failures?” He said, “Well, they really want to do what you do, but they don’t really have it, so they teach instead.” I said, “Damn, man, that’s a little bit jive.”\n\nTP: I’ve heard a lot of musicians say, for instance, who went to Berklee, that they were taught by someone who couldn’t play, etc.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, a lot of times, people are hired on that basis. The reason for the preponderance of an emphasis on certification by way of academic credentials is that it creates the means by which people can hire someone, and as a result, blame it on somebody else if it doesn’t work out. Because if you have a Ph.D and whatever, that’s the justification to pay you X amount of dollars and give you certain… I think my wife was telling me, or somebody, that the corporations are beginning to look differently at MBAs, saying an MBA is nothing, that hiring people on the basis of that is not the thing to do. The school system here just got rid of the second superintendent in a row, and it’s decided that the procedure they’re going to go through is not to go and look for some superstar somewhere, but to actually go within the university community to see if they can get someone to be the superintendent of the public schools in the city that they function.\n\nTP: So someone who knows New Orleans to deal with the New Orleans schools.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, that could be what their mindset is, but believe me, nothing could be further from the truth. Like I said before, man, there’s a lot of things about the law which nobody really deals with, which just doesn’t permit you to do certain things in the schools. And the kids know the law.\n\nTP: I’m getting away from the college, and I want get back to it. But it seems the subtext to what you’re saying about what you were able to accomplish at NOCCA is that you were able to do it precisely because it was a magnet school.\n\nMARSALIS: Precisely. It was a magnet school, and we had a principal who came from the theater as a background [Tom Tews]. Consequently, his philosophy was, it’s much easier to get forgiveness than permission. So we would do a lot of things that were good for the students, and if necessary, tell the school board people later.\n\nTP: I think I’m restating we talked about last week, but you developed a lot of your ideas about what was good for the students through your experience as a working jazz musician and an improviser.\n\nMARSALIS: Precisely.\n\nTP: I had asked you to boil down your educational philosophy as though I were an arts administrator, and you said, “Learn the fundamentals of melody, harmony and rhythm, and do it through drill.” Can you boil down what it was you learned as a professional jazz musician and improviser that gave you the sense of what your students needed to know?\n\nMARSALIS: I think I discovered the relationship between the Blues and the American Canon, the music canon, and how it related to… How can I put this? Learning how to play Blues became like learning arithmetic. Before you can get to algebra, calculus and trigonometry, you must have mastered the fundamentals of arithmetic. The Blues is like arithmetic. It’s the simplest approach to learning improvisation. And that’s one of the things I learned about Blues.\n\nTP: And why is it the simplest approach to learning about improvisation?\n\nMARSALIS: Because you don’t have a lot to deal with. Like, 12 measures is equivalent to one chorus. It’s a repetitive situation, chorus after chorus after chorus. And the students can be given relatively few notes. I would write out 12 measures of chords that would turn out, when played, to be a blues. I was doing two or three different things at the same time. One, I was presenting them with a visible manifestation of the form of blues in one chorus. Two, I was using chord symbols to represent in a vertical manner the sounds that they were going to deal with in a linear manner. See, after a while, this thing gets to be complex. The next thing is getting them to a point where they could deal with music that’s in motion. When you start to play and you count off the Blues, they begin to understand that you have to be at Measure 1-2-3-4, in a certain time frame, so you become sensitized to the flow of the rhythm.\n\nTP: Of the knowledge you had accumulated up to this time, what percentage of it was vernacular and functional, and what percentage of it came from your academic training?\n\nMARSALIS: None of it came from my academic training to speak of. First of all, I did not go to a music school. The university that I went to had an ample music department, which was sort of typical. It was sort of like, “Okay, this is a university, we need to have music, so we’ll just put something there.\n\nTP: Didn’t Dillard have a very good art department in the ’30s and ’40s?\n\nMARSALIS: Well, in the ’30s and the ’40s, there were people there who had the beginnings of what could have evolved into a great music program — or a great anything. See, when you start to talk about the ’30s and the ’40s, you’re talking about a completely different America. What happened after the Second World War had a tremendous amount of effect on shaping what we’re going through right now. I don’t care if you want to talk about Enron and WorldCom and them, or whether you want to talk about those young guys who’s out there playing a million notes a second in the name of Jazz, or the rappers who, when all else fails, curse. It doesn’t matter. What happened at the end of the Second World War set the stage for the American culture that we see today. Now, what was going on before that was the beginning of something that sort of was just left behind.\n\nTP: What sort of things?\n\nMARSALIS: There were things that were common among universities. For example, at one time, university presidents could help shape public policy. Nowadays, university presidents are about fundraising. Then, we’re talking about a predominantly black university, and there were several of those, and they were producing very good students. For example, Tuskegee had George Washington Carver, who was doing miracles with the soil in Alabama and actually created crop rotation. People like Charles (?), who at Howard helped to develop plasma, which saved the lives of a whole lot of guys in the Second World War.\n\nWhat I’m saying is that the seeds that were planted during those days could have evolved in a lot of different directions. Now, it’s for another generation at another time to go back and begin to ford all of that stuff out. It’s sort of like looking at why the Roman Empire collapsed.\n\nAnyway, in reference to what you were talking about as far as college is concerned, one of the first revelations that I had after I got there… I ended up meeting with the Chairman, and the Chairman said, “I was just looking over the applications that came in for the Fall, and I don’t see any jazz students’ names on these applications. So what are you going to do about that?”\n\nWell, that was a shock to me. Because I had never been in a situation where I was under the gun for the RR — Recruitment and Retention. See, that’s one of the things that you have to face when you’re going into a university — Recruitment and Retention. Then I was forced to begin to say, “Now, who actually is the jazz student?” We would take the big band and go straight up I-95 in Virginia, and go to these different towns and these different high schools, and we’d leave there and go up into Maryland, where the high school similar to NOCCA, the arts high school… Antonio Hart came from one of them. Then we’d leave there, and go on up to Philly, and go into that high school where Chris McBride and Joey DeFrancesco, some of them came from.\n\nBut eventually, what I started to realize was that most of the students we ran into, especially the trombone players, the good straight-up musicians, not necessarily people who were well-versed in jazz, but the good musicians — they were all talking engineering. And the ones with the 1400s on the SAT, none of them were talking about going into the music. And it wasn’t that I blamed them! It’s just that I had never really thought about jazz studies. Because in a high school, like at NOCCA, we were there for students to explore the possibilities of a career in one of five disciplines, whereas once you get to college, the students who come to a college are there to make decisions that will affect, if not the rest of their lives, at least a sizable chunk of them. And whether it does or doesn’t, the motivation for going to a university is based on, “Hey, I’m trying to make a decision that’s going to help me to get a job here, doing this or that.” Jazz was not viewed as economically viable in terms of university students, period. Now, there’s always exceptions. But you can’t run a program off of exceptions. That’s one of the things I learned real quick.\n\nTP: Well, Chris McBride and Joey DeFrancesco went right into the fray. They didn’t go to college, or at least not into that sort of program.\n\nMARSALIS: That’s right. Well, those are exceptions. That’s why I said I wasn’t talking about exceptions. There are people who do that now. There are even people, man, who are leaving high school and going into the pros. In fact, they’re not the first ones anyhow. Moses Malone did that. I think essentially, if you can stay, that does… Because even if you go all the way through college, that doesn’t mean you’re going to stay.\n\nTP: That’s right. You can go backwards in college.\n\nMARSALIS: [LAUGHS] Yeah.\n\nTP: So you were faced for the first time with having to recruit a band. It brought your job description to a different plane than it had been before.\n\nMARSALIS: Yeah, I had go to out and try to find some students.\n\nTP: And I guess in competition with other programs, too. You had to be like a coach.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, you’re always in competition with other programs. Everybody is. With the exception of whatever those programs are that just automatically get a huge body of people that they just have to say, “Well, we don’t want any more.” I don’t know if Engineering is like that. It may not be. I was talking to a friend of mine who knows a professor at UCLA who teaches composition. I had one lesson with this guy. I forgot his name, but anyway, he was telling him that at one time, of his composition students at UCLA, he would get maybe 4 or 5 or 6 who were interested in film scoring. See, all of them are now. Every single one of them. And when you think in terms of what has been happening lately, there is much more of a pronounced emphasis on John Williams, on Howard (?), on even one or two of the Newman family, of which there’s been an abundance in the film scoring world! So television and movies play an important role in the decisions that people are making, and I think ultimately, the universities haven’t really figured out some of that. I’m sure some institutions have. But when it comes down to it… I was reading where Harvard University had a course called (?) that they just got rid of, because there wasn’t anybody taking it. One of the things that was an assist when I got to UNO is that there were a lot of courses which had been approved through committee, and there was nobody teaching it. So those numbers were there, and see, a lot of times, man, if you know what they are, you can go and take the number and develop a course without having to go totally through committee. Because going through committee can sometimes be a hassle.\n\nTP: So you’d do an end run.\n\nMARSALIS: It’s kind of like an end run, yeah.\n\nTP: But at VCU, a number of musicians went through who are making an impact now.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, there’s only three that I know. Clarence Penn, Alvester Garnett and Loston Harris.\n\nVictor was teaching math in high school in New Orleans. He’d been in my group. I used to tell him, “Vic, if you really want to teach, I don’t see anything wrong with that, but to me it doesn’t make any sense to be teaching at these schools. You ain’t got no benefits, man. They could fire you tomorrow! And you have no recourse whatsoever. So if you really want to teach, you ought to teach in public school. At least you’ll get some benefits!” And when I left to come to VCU, he told me he’d thought about that, and he said, “Man, look, I don’t want to be sorry one day looking back and saying ‘I should have.'” So he split and came up there to work on his Masters. He really did it in a year, but they wouldn’t let him finish in a year. They made him come back and register for a recital. Eventually, he started to utilize his saxophone skills in different ways. He went up to New York and was doing sub work in some of the Broadway type shows. I think at that time “Ain’t Misbehavin'” was running and a couple of other ones. I remember he told me that when he went up to New York, somebody up there was talking to him at an audition, and the guy said, “Hey, man, do you know how to read?” And he said at first he got insulted! “Man, what is this?” He said after he was around New York for a while, he found out why he was asked that. [LAUGHS] A lot of the musicians up there couldn’t read!\n\nTP: What would you say you brought to the faculty at VCU that hadn’t been there before? Did you bring a new attitude, a new way of teaching?\n\nMARSALIS: I don’t think so. Because I wasn’t there long enough.\n\nTP: Three years, right?\n\nMARSALIS: I was there for three years. And I’m not sure to what extent that would have been a possibility to do. Because I came in without the benefit of the kind of experience… Just to give you an example, there’s a guy at Virginia Commonwealth, a trombone player named Tony Garcia. He edits the “Jazz Educational Journal,” which is the official organ of IAJE. He sent me an email and asked me if I would be able to come up as part of a program that they are doing, and he outlined some of the things that he was able to do. This is over the period of one year. It’s fantastic. Because what this guy was able to do is nothing short of miraculous. Well, for one thing, he was instrumental in getting somebody (I don’t know the guy personally) to give 2 million bucks to the jazz program at VCU. No jazz program has ever gotten that kind of money. Not in a state institution. I was the recipient of a million dollar chair. But when it came down to it, nothing like that. What it takes to be able to do that is the kind of press-the-flesh…\n\nTP: You need to have very solid political skills to pull off something like that.\n\nMARSALIS: That’s right. There’s just an awful lot of things, man, that he was able to hook up.\n\nTP: The question has more to do with philosophy: Looking back, what would you have done that you didn’t?\n\nMARSALIS: One of the first things that I realized about Virginia Commonwealth was that being in Richmond meant… There was no music tradition in Richmond. There was one little small space — I never went to that space — where some of the guys would play. There was another space that was like a restaurant, but it was bigger. And every now and then, they would bring somebody in. But for the most part, the benefits of being in a city that had a history of music, where students who were coming out of high school as well as those who were coming out of the city of Richmond to go to VCU, would have been able either to participate in or just be a spectator of.\n\nWhen I go to work on Friday nights at Snug Harbor, there’s a live band that’s playing right across the street. On the corner from there, there’s a place Cafe Brazil, with live music. Across the street from Cafe Brazil, there’s live music. Now, we’re not even talking about what might be happening on Bourbon Street. Then there’s all of these other different places in the area. On North Rampart Street, there’s three spaces within two blocks of each other, one called Funky Butt, the other one called Donna’s Bar & Grill, which specializes in brass bands, and then a blues joint which the owner of Funky Butt owns.\\\n\nRichmond didn’t have that. So when I looked at that, I started to realize that getting some people to come to Richmond, especially during the ’80s, to study Jazz, was seemingly very difficult. So I decided that if I was going to stay here, I needed to find a niche, something I can, which would really not only justify being here, but make it a positive musical experience for most of the students. So I was thinking of concentrating on developing rhythm sections — the piano, bass and drums. That would mean getting people to come here and trying to specialize in that area.\n\nTP: Thus Clarence Penn and Alvester Garnett.\n\nMARSALIS: Right. Now, Alvester I met while he was still in high school. He came to VCU the following year. So I was there I think a year while he was there.\n\nTP: I want to step back to your comments about what happened after World War II. Is what you’re saying, in one sense, that the focus on core curricular values started to deteriorate at this time and it had a deleterious effect on the culture? You made a very strong statement. The tone of voice is strong. The words are strong. It seems what happened is an important issue to you.\n\nMARSALIS: I need to be more speculative here than direct, because it’s very difficult to be as close to that and be accurate historically. What I’m beginning to realize is that we tend to be judgmental about things which are different from the way we grew up.\n\nAnyway, the thing that happened after World War Two was television, for one thing. And for the first time, here we have an invention which goes right into people’s homes, and within five years, which would put it right around 1950, there were about 10 million sets in the country. Now, what television managed to do was twofold, at least. One was to instantly let you know whatever was going on in almost any other part of the world that the networks chose to broadcast. Unlike, for example, “War Of The Worlds” on the radio with Orson Welles in 1939. I mean, there were people out there in fields in the Midwest with guns waiting to go to war with the Martians. And America, before World War Two, was not that much different, even going back to the past century. I mean, there just was not that much of a difference in terms of the way the country was going on. But as soon as World War Two came in, things like plastics were invented… I wish I knew all of them different inventions. I remember we got our very first refrigerator in 1941. Before that, it was the icebox.\n\nTP: In New Orleans, that was an important thing.\n\nMARSALIS: Well, it was an important thing everywhere. Because what it meant was that you could now keep food one or two days longer than you could otherwise. So many things started to happen.\n\nI think what happened with jazz is that jazz moved closer toward the musical objectives that have been prevalent primarily in European Classical Music. What I mean is this. During the time of Louis Armstrong and King Oliver and Kid Ory, all of these earlier guys, they played music for the sheer entertainment of people. They played dances, and when they played the blues, it was for people to dance to. They had cutting contests, but the cutting contest was music played at the level of the audience themselves. For example, what they would do, they would have these flatbed trucks, and two bands would come. [The ballyhoo.] Whoever won that one, that’s where the people would go to dance. By the time World War Two came (and I’m using World War Two more as a marker than the cause of anything), you had musicians coming out of the Swing Era with the dance bands, like Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, and various people… The top level of people was one thing, but then there were all of the disciples, if you will, like Sonny Stitt and various other people. So the emphasis started to be placed on the soloist. The elements of the music carried over was related directly to the band.\n\nTP: Max Roach used to say t"
