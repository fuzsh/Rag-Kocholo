        "text": "I remember sometime in the 1980s I tried to play a few games with 1960s sets, and found it stultifying. Every time a team crossed midfield and fourth down came up, they might as well try a 50+ yard field goal. (Remember, the goal posts were on the goal line.) Even if you miss it, it’ll likely be a touchback, and even if it comes up short, it’s not much worse than a punt, as the defense has to return it. Your punter (who was often the placekicker, or else played some other position) was there just to get you out of deep holes. He had no strategic function.\n\nOf course the NFL has done some dumb things, rules-wise, but moving the goal posts back and treating the missed FG differently made the game more interesting.\n\nI know that I’d miss the two-point conversion in retrospect. Pretty depressing to find your team trailing by 8, 11 or 15 points as the game winds down and realize that you need an extra field goal in the mix.\n\nMy biggest 'problem' when I break out the 1960 sets (originals) is that APBA, back then, didn't use the P & K columns for kick-off and punt returns. So you might have a guy like Travis Williams of the Packers/Rams who returned kick-offs, punts and was a running back, but his card is simply designated as OA/TA. This means you would use his R column for his runs from scrimmage, his punt returns and KO returns. Under the old APBA game, there was no way to distinguish between his card for run plays from scrimmage and his return abilities. If he happened to have a PRN# 1 on his R column because he had an 85 yard run from scrimmage that year, that card would also be giving him some very long kick returns, even if his longest kick return that year was 25 yards.\n\nOr, the other way around in Mr. William's case...\n\nThis post made me dig out Travis William's original 1967 card when he was a running back and OA with the Packers. His PRNs include two #1's and a #3 (for his 11, 33, 66 dice rolls). Now he DID have an incredible 4 TD's on KO returns in 1967 (which ties him with Cecil Turner and still stands as an NFL record). But his longest run from scrimmage that year was 37 yards. I would get totally frustrated playing a game in with that card because Williams would be breaking away for 85 yard TD runs from scrimmage due to his incredible KO return capabilities. Back then, APBA didn't use the P and K columns to take players like Williams, Gale Sayers, etc. into account which, to me, makes playing with the old card sets frustrating at times.\n\nI agree with your comment. I remember the old APBA brochures from the early 1970s speaking to the issue of intentionally playing the game in a way that produces unrealistic results. APBA always took the position that however one chooses to play its game, is up to the individual who purchased the game. But APBA also inferred that to invest money in a game which is designed to produce realistic results, and then intentionally play the game in such a way that guarantees unrealistic results may be a waste of one's money. I never understood how anyone could take any pride doing what you explained with the Csonka card. I'm assuming he never actually returned a punt in his life.\n\nThe APBA table-game concept (in any of its products) is to remarkably reproduce a player's actual results, provided that player is used in a realistic manner. If one chooses to play the game in such a way that defies anything approaching a realistic use of the players, to me, defeats the inherent beauty of the APBA concept. But...I guess whatever makes someone happy. It's their money.\n\nI remember in the 1970s playing that the old Avalon Hill Bookcase game \"Football Strategy\" game with a friend. He would use totally unorthodox play calls...and he would win every time. He was simply playing to beat the game engine by calling plays over and over that, while totally unrealistic, would produce positive results. It wasn't any fun playing against him because he would just call plays that had the best 'odds' of being successful in that board game, but didn't even resemble the kinds of plays that one would expect in an actual football game situation. There was certainly no 'football strategy' involved in the way he played. Much like using Csonka to return punts, it wasn't fun to play that way.\n\nI'm preaching to the choir here, but I feel the same way about the modern/current game. I wanted to do a 1980 replay, I have the old game cards gathering dust in my closet so why not break them out. But I've run into two problems: The old game just has too many issues compared to the new, which have all been mentioned here. Also, I know there are conversion charts which allow you to play the old cards with the new game, however... I think there are serious issues with the passing conversions. In the modern game, a 1 on a pass is a TD anywhere on the field, in the old game that was not the case at all, not even close on the short pass. However, the conversion charts so don't change the 1 at all. So a 1980 Brian Sipe has two 1's in his P column. He had 30 TD passes in 577 drop backs, 1 TD every 19 dropbacks. But with the modern game, that card becomes super-powered because he has automatic TD's 1/18 of the time + the other TD's he can get on other card numbers. I saw several old comments about these conversion charts that thought the passing was too powerful in the conversion.\n\nIn conclusion, all hail the new game!\n\nAfter reading comments such as your well written post, I concur. The way I look at it, is to go back to when Henry Ford gave us the Model T. At the time, America thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread...maybe better. Over the the past 100+ years, look where we are now compared to the Model T. Model T's are fun to look at in museums, but I wouldn't want to drive one to and from work.\n\nWhen the original APBA football game was released in 1958, it was looked upon as the pinnacle of table top football. There was no comparison. It was unlike anything we'd ever seen before, and none of us concerned ourselves too much by nitpicking the game's faults. In fact, most of us didn't even notice the faults, because we had no frame of reference to judge the game by. We gladly accepted the game, warts and all, and every year sent APBA our money for next years sets. We were thrilled to play the game as it was. Over the years, the game has improved (for the better, I'd argue). I look at the old card sets the way I look at the Model T. In its day, it was the best. But it's day has long since passed. If I didn't know how much more realistic today's APBA football game is, I'd probably still be playing the old APBA football game from the 1960s and having a blast with it. But, the reality is that I do know how much better the new game is, so trying to go back to my old card sets just doesn't cut it for me.\n\nI just thank APBA for re-issuing those old sets which gives the best of both worlds. The old-time nostalgia of NFL from that era, coupled with the modern APBA innovations. Maybe 30 years from now, my grand-kids will look back at today's version of the game we all play today and think its an outdated relic the same way I look at the 1960s-era game. Who knows what future innovations APBA will introduce."
