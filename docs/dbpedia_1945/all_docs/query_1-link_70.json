Initially all Melanie could find was facts, dates, and the times that his name would be projected at the Australian War Memorial.\n\nThrough research, Melanie sought to give Cecil the recognition that he deserves for his courage in the War. Melanie has endeavoured to share Cecil’s tragic story of war so that it is not forgotten."
