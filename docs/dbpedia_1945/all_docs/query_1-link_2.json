        "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court has denied Springfield political figure Cecil Turner’s petition to hear his appeal on a 2006 wire fraud conviction, sending him back to federal prison.\n\nTurner, 62, spent eight months in prison in 2007, but had been free on bond since September 2007 pending the outcome of his appeals.\n\nA federal court jury in Peoria convicted him in September 2006 of participating in a scheme in which three state of Illinois janitors were paid for hours they weren’t on the job.\n\nHe later was sentenced to 30 months in prison, fined $600 and ordered to make $49,500 in restitution.\n\nHowever, U.S. District Judge Joe Billy McDade allowed Turner to be released on a $10,000 personal recognizance bond while his appeal was pending before the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. When that court affirmed Turner’s conviction in December 2008, his attorneys announced their intention to ask the U.S. Supreme Court for relief, and McDade extended Turner’s bond.\n\nThe judge said Turner met the two requirements to remain on bond in that he was not likely to flee or pose a danger to others and that his appeal raised a substantial question likely to result in reversal or a new trial.\n\nThe high court turned down Turner’s petition June 1.\n\nTurner, former vice chairman of the Sangamon County Democratic Party, was convicted of wire fraud and making false statements in connection with a scheme in which three state janitors got paychecks for work they didn’t do. Turner, who oversaw the janitors as director of physical services for the Illinois secretary of state, was accused of covering up the scheme and protecting the janitors, although he received no monetary gain from it.\n\nHis appeal questioned whether a direct deposit of a paycheck meets the requirements for a wire fraud conviction.\n\nTurner wrote McDade after the Supreme Court denied his petition, saying a post-conviction investigation has discovered new evidence that a government witness at his trial had bias and a motive to testify falsely.\n\nMcDade entered an order saying he construed the letters as a request for a new trial, but said he no longer had authority to order a new trial or appoint counsel. He said, however, that Turner could consider filing a claim on other grounds.\n\nChris Dettro can be reached at 788-1510."
