        "text": "The American Craft Council (ACC), an independent arts non-profit, will digitize 275 audio recordings, video recordings, and films related to American craft and craft artists from the audiovisual collection of the American Craft Council Library & Archives, dated between 1959 and 2006. The audiovisual materials in the collection include interviews and panel discussions with major craft artists, craft artist demonstrations, conference and symposia proceedings, and visual recordings produced in conjunction with exhibitions from the Museum of Contemporary Crafts/American Craft Museum. Many of the materials are fragile and susceptible to decay, in formats such as 16mm film and magnetic tape. Additionally, these materials are largely inaccessible to researchers due to the lack of playback equipment in the ACC library for these outdated formats. The ACC requests funding to digitally preserve our audiovisual collection to protect valuable content from being lost, and to enhance access to the content by library users.\n\nThis project will digitize and make available online 197 reels of 16mm and 8mm film that are part of the B’nai B’rith International Archives. Founded in 1843, B’nai B’rith is one of the world’s largest Jewish human rights, philanthropic, and community service organizations. At 345 linear feet, the B’nai B’rith collection is not only one of the largest collections at the AJA, but it is also one of the most accessed by researchers. The films have been largely inaccessible due to their fragility and the difficulty of playing the 16mm films that have separate sound and video reels. This project will involve cleaning and digitizing the reels, editing the sound and video and provide sync dailies—when applicable—together, adding metadata and closed captioning, and finally linking the films to the AJA’s website for public use.\n\nThe Amherst Center for Russian Culture (ACRC) proposes to digitize 168 video tapes and 1,246 audio cassette tapes of interviews, lectures, performances, and rehearsals recorded in the USSR by the American theater scholar Alma Law between 1974 and 1997. This collection offers a unique history of Vsevolod Meyerhold’s innovative theater and its legacy in the late Soviet and post-Soviet eras. Meyerhold was a revolutionary director whose nonrealistic theatrical approach greatly influenced twentieth-century experimental theater both in and out of Russia. After his arrest and secret execution in 1940, it became dangerous to keep his records, or even talk about him. Law’s interviews with Meyerhold’s artistic collaborators thus paint a collective portrait of the understudied and influential director. We propose to digitize the video and audio cassettes, create and publish descriptions, and provide access to this rich collection, making it available to scholars and students for the first time.\n\nAustin Film Festival (AFF) intends to digitize 104 at-risk, Mini-DV tapes of interview and event recordings from 2003-2010 that feature culturally impactful film and television artists. AFF has been an advocate for recording and preserving the conversations between interviewees, panelists, and the audience since its inaugural year in 1994. In 2009, AFF’s co-founder and Executive Director, Barbara Morgan, realized this vast inventory of recordings was in danger of deteriorating, prompting the quest to both preserve and share this material. The organization sought to collaborate with Texas State University and has housed the AFF On Story Archive at the Wittliff Collections of the Alkek Library at the University for 15 years and counting. Materials in the archive include educational interviews, live panels, Q&As, script readings, and other events that offer insight into writers/filmmakers’ craft, personal influences, historical contexts, and bodies of work at large.\n\nThis project will encompass the digitization of 204 reel-to-reel audio tapes and 1,328 cassette tapes of audio recordings of meetings of the Chicago City Council for the years 1970 to 2010. These unique recordings are a matter of public record and will finally be digitally preserved according to the National Digital Stewardship Alliance’s guidelines and made available via the Chicago City Clerk’s web site and the Internet Archive. The tapes span 40 years of Chicago mayoral administrations and contain primary source evidence of major events of Chicago’s history, from Richard J. Daley’s reign as one of the most powerful mayors in American history to Harold Washington’s historic win as Chicago’s first African American mayor in 1983 and the subsequent Council Wars that followed the election. This will be a major resource for the study of four decades of Chicago’s municipal history as well as American history.\n\nThis project will digitize, catalog, and make publicly available approximately 70 hours of Super-8 sound film shot by Chicago photojournalist Bill Stamets between the late 1970s and early 2000s. Chronicling what Stamets describes as “a miscellany of civic occasions where Americans make sense of power,” this footage depicts a variety of important Chicago figures, including the groundbreaking mayorships of Harold Washington and Jane Byrne, as well as numerous heated protests, celebratory parades, and other culturally-revealing public events. This year-long project will result in 271 item-level catalog records and streaming films that will be shared online via Chicago Film Archives’ website.\n\nThe CUNY Dominican Studies Institute Library will work with Media Transfer Service to digitize 162 audio and video recordings from the Dominican bachata music collection donated by scholar Deborah Pacini Hernández. The collection includes first-hand field work interviews with marginalized musicians, unique musical performances that document the rich underground music scene in the Dominican Republic’s urban slums from 1986 to 1994, as well as documents of US-based bachata artists from 2003-2011. The purpose is to digitize, preserve, and make available an essential yet little known early history of the development of bachata before the genre became internationally known. Once digitized, all descriptive metadata will be available online, providing access to the recordings. The digitization of this collection is essential to guarantee preservation and long-term availability.\n\nBuilt in the 1920s, Hammond Castle Museum is the former residence of John Hays Hammond Jr. (1888-1965), a renowned scientist, inventor, and collector who held over 500 patents in multiple fields, including pipe organ technology, sound amplification, and mixing equipment. Hammond commissioned the construction of an 8,400 pipe organ in the castle, and invited organists from around the world to play and have their pieces recorded using his patented recording equipment. As a result of these and other recordings found in the collection, we have 2,000+ vinyl and shellac records that are in critical need of restoration and digitization. Discs include unpublished recordings of famous organists such as Richard Elsasser and Joseph Bonnet as well as the possibility of recordings of John Hammond himself. This project will appeal to a broad and diverse audience–from the museum’s 60,000 visitors per season to classical music, sound technology, and history scholars.\n\nIllinois State Archives, in partnership with Bel Air Sound Studio, will digitize 10 open-reel tapes and 340 cassette tapes from the Legislative Commission to Visit and Examine State Institutions. From 1959 to 1984 the Illinois General Assembly developed three subcommittees from the commission to perform visits and examine various State institutions. Visitations were made at state hospitals, children’s service centers, security hospitals, pediatric institutes, psychiatric institutes, zone or mental health centers, universities, prisons, juvenile correction facilities, the Illinois Soldiers and Sailors Home, the Illinois School for the Deaf, and the Illinois Braille and Sight Saving School. The digitization of these tapes will provide valuable information about the activities of the Commission, tours for the facilities, staffing and treatment of patients, insight on the closing of institutions, and investigations concerning patient treatment at these institutions.\n\nKenneth L. Hale (1934-2001) was a linguist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1967-1999. In addition to being an ardent student of endangered languages, Hale was actively involved in causes promoting the preservation of Indigenous languages and cultures. Hale’s collection at the MIT Libraries’ Department of Distinctive Collections includes 702 open-reel audio tapes, audio cassettes, and VHS tapes of more than 80 distinct languages and dialects from around the world, predominantly Indigenous languages of the Americas and Australian Aboriginal languages. This project seeks to digitize these recordings in order to enhance their description and enable their long-term preservation. Digitization will be conducted by Mass Productions in Tewksbury, MA. As the recordings are digitized, we will work with representatives from the featured language communities and experts in Indigenous collections and cultures to determine levels of description, access, and use for the recordings.\n\nPEM’s Phillips Library requests funding to digitize 196 field recordings made by Martin Brunor between 1950 and 1982 while conducting research on the Austral Islands, the southernmost islands in French Polynesia. Today, the recordings are housed in the Phillips Library, one of the oldest libraries in the U.S., and are part of the Martin A. Brunor Papers. An American ethnologist, Brunor (1901–1983) studied the history, customs, and lives of the Indigenous peoples of the Austral Islands. He recorded research, diary entries, and oral histories with Indigenous peoples of Rurutu and other Austral Islands on magnetic and cassette tapes, and vinyl Audographs. Approximately 50% of the recordings’ contents are unknown; those that are identified document Indigenous knowledge, some now vanished. The collection is highly endangered as magnetic tapes are prone to degradation. This project will migrate and preserve the recordings—making them accessible to Austral Islanders and researchers.\n\nThe Purdue University Archives and Special Collections proposes digitizing 96 moving images and 39 audio recordings documenting the influential work and impact of Frank and Dr. Lillian Gilbreth. The Gilbreths ran an engineering consulting business in the early 20th century and became experts in the field of time and motion study. After Frank’s unexpected death, Lillian continued their research and business and became influential worldwide in the field of industrial engineering and home economics. These recordings contain previously unheard lectures, interviews, and instruction in the field of motion study and its applications in industrial engineering, the home, and the workplace. Scholars worldwide continue to study the Gilbreths pioneering, cross-disciplinary research, work, and impact on modern-day practices and technologies. The materials will be digitized through an external vendor, described online, and recordings will be freely accessible in our reading room and when possible, online.\n\nJun Kaneko is a visual artist known for his large-scale ceramic sculptures. Born 1942 in Japan, Kaneko came to Los Angeles in 1963 and studied under Peter Voulkos, Paul Soldner, and other influential artists of the California Clay Movement. Ree and Jun Kaneko co-founded the internationally renowned artist residency program Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts in Omaha, Nebraska in 1985. This project will digitize 185 recordings from the Kanekos’ archives spanning from the 1950s to the early 2000s. They document Jun’s early life in Japan, exhibitions, special projects, experimental films, lectures, studio practice, and workshops with other artists including Voulkos. Many recordings document the formative years, resident artists, and community outreach activities of the Bemis Center. Due to condition and lack of playback equipment, these materials are not currently available for research. Digitization will allow the Foundation to preserve, identify, and describe these materials and make them available to researchers.\n\nThis digitization project will preserve and extend open access to 89 films produced by Baptista Films in the 1940’s-1950’s. Thirty-four of these films are unique to this collection, with only one additional known copy existing for the remaining 55, which are held at the Billy Graham Center Archive in Chicago. The collection comprises historic examples of early motion pictures produced for religious purposes. Categories include animation, films shot in foreign countries, musical performances by soloists and groups, testimonies by military personnel, scientifically oriented films, and films for children. The recordings will be cleaned, digitized, and prepared for storage following recommended practice and industry standards. Files of the recordings will be made freely accessible on Regent’s Alma Digital platform. A link to each film will also be added to the catalog records. Master digital files will be preserved in the Regent University Information Technology cloud storage.\n\nThe UCLA Library will digitize and preserve 119 1/4 inch audio tapes and 54 videotapes that document the history of the longest running Asian American theater group in the United States, Los Angeles-based East West Players (EWP), from 1965 to 1992. These audiovisual materials will be made accessible to both the community and researchers through free online access and on-site access at the UCLA Library, depending on the variable rights issues associated with the materials. As EWP prepares to celebrate its 60th anniversary in 2025, this project ensures that these heavily degraded tapes, which are the only existing documentation of EWP during this formative time period, are preserved before they are lost forever. Digitizing these materials not only provides reference and research materials to scholars in fields such as Asian American studies and theater, but also preserves the legacy of the founding members of EWP within their community.\n\nThis project aims to digitize 275 films in the Dr. Selma Fraiberg papers at the UCSF Archives and Special Collections (ASC). These films span a 15-year period during Dr. Fraiberg’s studies on the social, emotional, and physical development of sighted and visually impaired children. As a pioneer field of child psychoanalysis, Dr. Fraiberg used film as a key research tool, with these recordings forming the foundation of many of her influential books. Dr. Fraiberg’s work challenged conventional beliefs about disabled children, introduced therapeutic model of intervention for infants-mothers, and also influenced public policy discussions on their rights. However, access to her film collection, crucial to this research, remains limited due to its physical format and privacy concerns. This necessitates its digitization. This project aligns with UCSF’s commitment to preserving historical materials related to women in science and will ensure Dr. Fraiberg’s legacy continues to inspire future generations.\n\nThis project will migrate 705 audio-visual assets of events, programs, and speakers at Spelman College, the oldest existing historically Black college for women. The materials include audio cassettes, reel-to-reel, VHS, and Beta cam tapes of numerous campus events, including recordings of the internationally renowned Glee Club, Commencement, Founders Day activities, and lectures from esteemed campus guests such as Alice Walker, Stokely Carmichael, and Cicely Tyson. The digital files will be made accessible in the Spelman Archives reading room and online through Bynder, the College’s digital asset management system. The Archives staff will also collaborate with campus partners and external stakeholders for public programming and outreach for the collection. The availability of these previously inaccessible audio-visual materials is critical for continued research on Spelman, the overall history of one of the nation’s most revered historically Black collections, and its national and international impact academically, socially, and culturally.\n\nThe State Historical Society of Iowa will digitally preserve, catalog, promote and make publicly available 84 reels of 16mm film recordings that provide a unique snapshot in time into Iowa’s natural resources conservation history from the 1940s-1960s. These films were created for the Iowa Conservation Commission by the official photographer and visual documentarian for the commission, Jim Sherman, and his staff shortly after World War Two. For the next 20 years, the films were shared via over-the-air television broadcasts in Iowa and adjacent states, educating the public as to the operation and public works of the Conservation Commission. The production masters have been lost and these broadcast copies afflicted with severe vinegar syndrome are all that remain of this important historical legacy which we are requesting support to preserve. If not digitally preserved in the near future, the information they contain will be lost to history.\n\nWe will digitize and make publicly available approximately 240 hours of personal interviews with African American educators active in the eras of Jim Crow and desegregation, collected by local resident James Eddie McCoy between 1981 and 2016. McCoy captured a narrative that challenges much of the conventional understanding of school integration in America. Most of his informants have since died. Digitized materials will be deposited at the Thornton Library in Oxford and at the Shepard Library at North Carolina Central University (NCCU). They will be catalogued through the North Carolina Digital Heritage Center (DigitalNC.org) using metadata approved by the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). Hosted on DigitalNC servers, the recordings will become accessible globally through the DPLA catalog. A public program featuring Dr. Leslie Fenwick and Dr. Jarvis Givens will explore the historical importance of these recordings. This otherwise-lost or forgotten history will remain available both globally and locally.With the support of a Recordings at Risk grant, The Strong National Museum of Play will contract with a qualified external service provider to digitize and preserve 146 audio and video cassettes within the museum’s Anne D. Williams Collection—a rich variety of documentation on the history of jigsaw puzzles and the communities created around them in the 20th and 21st centuries. Digitization of these highly at-risk cassettes will preserve a set of unique and irreplaceable source material on the subject of play while serving an audience of scholars, researchers, and students across a variety of academic disciplines.\n\nWe will digitize and make publicly available approximately 240 hours of personal interviews with African American educators active in the eras of Jim Crow and desegregation, collected by local resident James Eddie McCoy between 1981 and 2016.

A public program featuring Dr. Leslie Fenwick and Dr. Jarvis Givens will explore the historical importance of these recordings. This otherwise-lost or forgotten history will remain available both globally and locally.\n\nOur objective is to preserve and provide access to a valuable collection of news reports from WMAR, the first television station in Maryland. The collection is located in the Special Collections and Archives department of the RLB Library at the University of Baltimore (a PBI) and contains unique footage of significant historical events, cultural and racial issues, and political and social changes in the region, particularly Baltimore. These recordings are currently stored on obsolete media, which are at risk of degradation. We will digitize 962 U-matic and VHS tapes from 1984 to 1993 and make them available through the Internet Archive website. This is the second phase of a larger project to digitize the entire collection. By digitizing the tapes, we will help preserve the coverage of historical events for both public and scholarly communities. The first phase successfully digitized 975 U-matic tapes from 1980 to 1985 in Cycle 8.\n\nThe University of Miami Libraries (UML) seeks to preserve 150 VHS, 15 compact cassettes and 160 microcassettes from the Janet Reno Papers. The recordings document trailblazing attorney and public official Reno’s career from the 1980s-2004, with the bulk from her time as U.S. Attorney General (1993-2001) and when she ran for Governor of Florida in 2002. Many of the recordings selected are unlikely to be found elsewhere. Scholars have expressed interest in the collection since its transfer to UML in 2017, but have been unable to access the audiovisual materials due to condition and format. Approximately 65% of these recordings have mold in 2024, an increase from approximately 60% when assessed in 2023. All are on magnetic media, making these recordings doubly at-risk. By digitizing these recordings, we will make them accessible for research and ensure the digital and physical materials are preserved for many years to come.\n\nThe UNMC McGoogan Health Sciences Library seeks $17,561.85 to digitize 65 film items from two collections within its archival holdings. These film reels contain rare footage of clinical practices, therapeutic interventions, and educational content used in mental health settings during the 20th century, giving researchers unparalleled insights into past treatment methodologies, patient experiences, and societal perceptions of mental illness. The proposed funding would support the digitization of these films, which due to their age, format, and condition are currently inaccessible to researchers. This project would also create publicly available, item-level descriptions and finding aids to assist with discovery. We will review each film for ethical content and privacy issues and apply solutions as needed. Snippets of some of these films have been made available by other institutions; however, by digitizing these reels, we can unlock their entire educational and historical significance, ensuring their preservation, wider dissemination, and research use.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh Library System (ULS) proposes to preserve, digitize, and provide free public access to recordings of the WCAE’s “Let’s Tell a Story” radio program (1947-1954), held on 300 aluminum-cored transcription discs. Featuring librarian-storytellers Margaret Hodges, Bessie Hardie, and Kathryn Kohberger, these episodes were recorded in conjunction with Pittsburgh public schools and aired during school hours. The recordings, comprising primarily folk and fairytales, are the only copies known to exist. This material is significant to scholarship on children, media, marketing, education, storytelling, and culture: demonstrating the relationships between libraries, radio, and education in the post-war era; documenting the bridge from radio to television, from regional to syndicated; and capturing storytelling techniques particular to librarians and early radio technology. Through preservation, digitization, and robust metadata, this project will make these at-risk audio resources permanently and openly accessible to scholars, community researchers, students, and the public.\n\nVCU Libraries seek funds for stabilization and digital reformatting of 156 films and 13 audio reels from the Richmond, Virginia Police Department (RPD) Surveillance Records (1961-1973). The films were held by Rick Duling, former RPD officer, to document the Department’s surveillance of what they deemed subversive and counter-cultural groups in the metropolitan Richmond region. The films include footage of Black Panther Party meetings and activities in the 1960s; anti-draft, anti-war, and anti-bussing protests; student protests at local universities; marches including the Poor People’s Campaign, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, and the trial of H. Rap Brown. These films will provide new opportunities to investigate aspects of the civil rights struggle in the South among scholars from a wide variety of disciplines and locations. Through this project, VCU staff will preserve master files as well as clean and prepare original recordings for long-term storage, enabling future accessibility.\n\nThe materials proposed for this project come from our Gaydreams audio recordings collection. Gaydreams was a weekly radio show on WXPN in Philadelphia hosted by Bert Wylen from 1990-1996. During this time period the nation’s LGBT community experienced important and rapid change. The Gaydreams audio recordings (numbering 312 items) are composed of three magnetic media types—cassette tapes, reel tapes, and digital audio tapes—which are imperiled because of their age, format, and historic storage environment. We will partner with George Blood, LP to do this reformatting work. They will be cataloged in-house to provide access to scholars and community members through our Islandora digital collections site.\n\nAppalshop Archive’s audiovisual collections contain over 18,000 primary source film, video and audio items that document life in the region from the 1930s to the present day. The content provides insight to the region’s folk traditions, social and religious practices, and labor history, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural effects of an industrial mono-economy over the course of a century. On July 28, 2022 a catastrophic 1000-year flood, exceeding the area’s worst-recorded flood by 7 feet, breached Appalshop’s building and immersed the organization’s archive in muddy water. We are requesting support to help rescue 75 flood-damaged 16mm film and videotape elements that document history, art, culture and social issues of central Appalachia.\n\nWith modern-day motion-activated cameras and high-powered lenses, capturing unique wildlife interactions has become commonplace. Until recently, the process of capturing nature through film was intensive and time-consuming. Large equipment was carried into remote areas to record just a few minutes of footage. But these films now contain rich scientific and historic assets with biological data and primary source material found nowhere else. The Chicago Academy of Sciences’ audiovisual collection contains hundreds of these films from field trips and expeditions across the world—but only a few have been digitized, leaving these resources essentially hidden from the public. Historic photographs, contextualized with field notes, expedition surveys, and specimens, have proven essential for modern-day conservation and restoration efforts. Films provide further depth to scientific knowledge and cultural heritage, capturing more detail about plant, animal, and human interactions, but also documenting how time and human influence has altered these habitats.\n\nThe Eastern Shoshone Tribal Archives possesses a collection of vital recordings of historic tribal government proceedings, sacred ceremonial songs, music and prayers, and elders speaking in their traditional native dialect. These recordings date back to 1978 and span until 2018, totaling 122 items with 8,938 minutes of run time. Despite being in good condition, these recordings are at-risk and inaccessible. To preserve these rare and unique audio and visual resources, the collection must be digitized. Master Enterprises, Inc. has been provisionally selected for the digitization, quality control, and metadata creation work. Once digitized, the project aims to make the recordings available to the public. However, certain culturally sensitive recordings may be restricted by a group of tribal stakeholders. Digitization will enable tribal members, scholars, and other researchers to engage with these valuable resources, ensuring that they are preserved for future generations.\n\nFSU Libraries and the FSU Research Foundation seek funding to digitize, preserve, and make available audio and sound recordings from the William R. Jones Papers. Funds would be used to partner with a digitization vendor, and to fairly compensate metadata labor at FSU Libraries. Increased availability to these recordings will have global impacts on the fields of African American studies, theology, conflict resolution, and more. Due to the inherent instability and growing technical obsolescence of magnetic tape, it’s imperative that these recordings are migrated to digital formats for further preservation and access through existing FSU Libraries platforms.\n\nAs the oldest continually-performing arts organization in the United States, the Handel and Haydn Society has been a pioneer of music performance since 1815; however, its performance recordings are largely inaccessible due to storage on obsolete formats. H+H will partner with preservation experts from George Blood, LP, to digitize over 700 endangered audio recordings (including open-reel tapes, Betamax tapes, DATs, audio cassettes, and vinyl discs) produced between 1951 and 2007. This project will rescue the only surviving audio record of H+H’s performances, rehearsals, and radio broadcasts of that time. These recordings portray the organization’s seismic shift from an amateur chorus to a sleek and professional arts organization, and its leadership as a historically informed ensemble under several renowned leaders of the twentieth century’s early music revival. With its digital asset management system Preservica, H+H will ensure that the recordings are accessible online to scholars, performers, and music lovers worldwide.\n\nOver a 12-month period, the Indiana Historical Society (IHS) will digitize and catalog 1,500 open-reel audio tapes of the WTLC radio program, Like It Is. WTLC was the first radio station in Indianapolis to provide 24-hour programming for African Americans and was known for their award-winning news programs. Like It Is began in 1976 and aired through 1991. With an emphasis on civil rights, health, social justice, education, and entertainment, the program featured interviews and stories that covered local and national topics. In 1995 and 2001, the audio tapes were donated to the Indiana Historical Society. Due to their format, the tapes are currently not accessible by the public. Despite optimal storage conditions, degradation will become an issue as the tapes near 50 years. Digitization of the tapes will not only provide long-term preservation of the contents but allow for full access to this collection through the IHS Digital Collection.\n\nThe La MaMa Archive will digitize our unique collection of VHS tapes containing performance footage from 1978-2006, during which time La MaMa fostered trailblazing artists such as Elizabeth Swados, Denise Stoklos, Andrei Serban, and George Ferencz. Footage features La MaMa artists on international tours, capturing consequential moments of cultural exchange in Italy, Turkey, Kosovo, India, and South Africa. In many cases, these tapes are the only existing video documentation of these works. Funds from CLIR’s Recordings at Risk program will enable the Archive to digitize the 100 most rare and significant of these tapes to further accessibility and scholarship. The catalog records with description and metadata will be discoverable on La MaMa’s digital collections site, with access copies held in the Archive. Preservation masters will be stored with our partners, Digital Bedrock. The newly digitized footage will provide artists, researchers, and students with invaluable insight into American cultural history.\n\nThe Ocean Exploration Trust oversees an audiovisual catalog of more than 150 deep-sea expeditions led by Dr. Robert Ballard. This collection spans 50 years of exploration and includes seminal, first-look imagery of historic discoveries including deep-sea hydrothermal vents, biological diversity new to science, and shipwrecks important to the marine archaeological record including discovery and exploration of RMS Titanic, battleship Bismarck, and over 60 ancient shipwrecks throughout the Black Sea.Only a small fraction of these dive recordings was made available to science given the limitations of transfer technology at the time. We cataloged available physical recordings at OET offices and prioritized deep-sea footage which contain data important to the marine archaeological record and scientific investigation. Digitization is a critical next-step that will enable integration of this catalog into our existing infrastructure for data archive, backup, review, and accessibility to the broader scientific community to view contemporary deep-sea footage by OET.\n\nThis project will digitize the significant number of recordings taken by the San Diego Natural History Museum throughout its 149-year history. These recordings contain irreplaceable information concerning scientific research and scientific education, including species data, species behaviors, and important context provided by curators and educators. The recordings are particularly important as some of the earliest scientific recordings of flora and fauna in Southern California, Baja California, and related areas. Digitizing these recordings, which are at significant risk of deterioration, will make them available to researchers across the world, and contribute to global efforts to preserve important biodiversity data.\n\nMary Ellen Hillaire was a groundbreaking intellectual and educator with a unique vision for intercultural exchange in education, laying the groundwork for the first Longhouse on a US college campus, academic support for tribal leaders, and a pedagogy centering students’ cultural background and knowledge. Coming from an oral tradition, Hillaire’s legacy includes two thousand audio recordings documenting her philosophy and pedagogy, as well as visits of significant Native American musicians, activists, and educators. This project seeks to digitize these currently inaccessible recordings and make them available to future generations interested in Indigenous higher education and Coast Salish culture.\n\nThe Noguchi Museum seeks to digitize approximately 25,000 feet of 16mm film, along with approximately 25,000 feet of 16mm magnetic audio film, from its archives. These recordings, which date from c.1978-82, constitute the complete raw materials created in the production of “A Sense of Place,” an unfinished full-length documentary on acclaimed artist Isamu Noguchi (1904–1988) by filmmakers Denise Marika and Michael Rich. Focusing on Noguchi’s work on large-scale public works, ranging from playgrounds to gardens to landscape architecture, the materials include rare, never-before-seen footage of Noguchi at work—including during the creation of one of Noguchi’s most renowned projects, “California Scenario”—along with interviews with Noguchi about his philosophy of sculpture and public art. Many of these reels already exhibit signs of red-shifting and/or vinegar syndrome. To preserve their contents, the Museum seeks to stabilize and digitize these rapidly deteriorating materials, and to make them publicly available via its website.\n\nThe George A. Smathers Libraries (Libraries), University of Florida, and Burning Spear Media, LLC, will partner to digitize and make publicly accessible 1495+ audio and video recordings dating back to 1971. These media document the history of the Black Power struggle through activities of the Uhuru Movement. Recordings include conferences, workshops, Freedom Schools, Sunday Meetings, homeless activism, protest marches, speeches, electoral campaign activities, and activists’ personal accounts. Collection content includes 12 sessions of the International Tribunal on Reparations to Black People in the U.S., Huey Newton’s last speeches, and presentations by Omali Yeshitela in London and Africa. Recordings chronicle the survival, continuity and growth of the movement for Black Power and African Internationalism from 1971 to 1999.The Libraries will ingest and preserve these recordings, making them freely available through UF’s Digital Collections, offering rare resources for current and future generations of students, activists, journalists, filmmakers, historians and the general public.\n\nThe main objective of “Doubling Down: Preserving the Stories of the Workers and Dreamers Behind the Las Vegas Casino Industry” is to digitize approximately 800 unique audiovisual items found across a number of UNLV Special Collections & Archives (UNLV SCA) archival collections. Las Vegas is a worldwide leader in the Casino and Hospitality industry welcoming more than 40 million people annually. This material dates from approximately 1960 to 2005 and provides unique insight into the conception, construction, and marketing of casinos. The materials also document the lives of the casino workers, customers, and dreamers who built Las Vegas. Digital files will be made available to researchers in the UNLV SCA reading room. Preservation master files will be uploaded to Fedora/Amazon Web Services for long-term digital preservation and copies will be added to UNLV SCA’s secure servers.\n\nThe goal of this project is to provide access to open reel video tapes produced in South Carolina that document South Carolina’s Lowcountry folk art, crafts, and music during the 1970s. The Charleston Communication Center was part of a National Endowment for the Arts Regional program partnership and includes recordings of South Carolina crafts people and artists living in the Lowcountry. The material filmed by the center from 1970-1976 has enormous value to local and scholarly communities and are a unique and important resource for the public, for teaching, and for research in many disciplines. Because the material is currently inaccessible and endangered, digitization is the only way to ensure access to this important collection of historical material covering life and the arts in South Carolina. The direct scope of the project includes outsourced transfer of all video and audio reels resulting in HD and H.264 digital files.\n\nWashington University Libraries requests $36,275.85 to digitize and reassemble almost 100 interviews conducted with Civil Rights activists from 1978 to 1980. Public television producer Jack Willis and SNCC member Jean Wiley conducted the interviews for their never-completed documentary The Civil Rights Project. While they interviewed major Civil Rights leaders like Rosa Parks and Stokely Carmichael, they spent most of their time talking to local activists in the cities in the South where the movement began.As the film was unfinished, these important interviews have never been accessible by scholars or the general public. This project will digitize 63,650 feet of 16mm film and 195 audio recordings that contain the more than 100 interviews and related on-location footage. The filmed interviews will be reassembled making them viewable for the first time. An Omeka exhibit will contextualize the digitized materials that will eventually be accessible in the Libraries’ in-development Piction-based repository.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1965, WCS’s Department of Tropical Research (DTR) undertook expeditions across tropical terrestrial and marine locales. Conducting what is now regarded as standard ecological research, the DTR were among the first Western scientists to study the interconnectedness of tropical wildlife and their habitats through close, first-hand observations. The DTR were additionally noteworthy in that they were composed of both men and women, hugely influential in their time, and that, beyond scientists, the team included artists, writers, and filmmakers. Their footage, which comprises the DTR Film Collection, not only documents the early history of Western conservation science, but it also includes rare and possibly unique documentation of landscapes, wildlife, and local peoples. The WCS Archives proposes to digitize the DTR Film Collection’s 88 reels and make them publicly available online. Access to these important recordings supports a variety of users, from historians and scientists to artists and the public.\n\nThe Military Women’s Memorial (MWM) collection of over 1,400 oral histories documents women’s service to our nation with narratives representing World War I to the present, from all military branches, as well as ancillary organizations. However, more than half of these stories are inaccessible. Varied legacy format recordings—subject to degradation—limit use at our onsite archives with limited publicly searchable content. As MWM creates new exhibitions, website content, and programming, digitizing the balance of the Collection will ensure these stories are preserved, and will support efforts to engage new and diverse audiences. This project will digitize 1,106 media items, revealing the untold stories of 844 military women, in a format suitable for long-term preservation, as well as MP3 and MP4 web-accessible format to facilitate web access and transcription. Descriptive metadata will enhance discoverability and access to the research community and other audiences through our Preservica Starter oral history digital collections portal.\n\nCecil Taylor (1929-2018) is recognized as an uncompromising visionary in the development of free jazz, and a pioneering composer, multi-instrumentalist, and poet. A classically trained virtuosic pianist, Taylor’s iconoclastic approach to jazz piano challenged prevailing notions of jazz and avant garde music, forming a truly unique oeuvre over his seven-decade career of solo and collaborative improvisations with luminaries including Steve Lacy and John Coltrane. Blank Forms proposes to digitize the most comprehensive archive of the artist’s late work, 1962-2010, and the most extensive collection of his live music, period. These recordings, which have never, or rarely, been made publicly available, significantly augment available resources for studying Taylor’s life, praxes, and sessionography, drawing the interest of filmmakers and scholars across disciplines. The project would digitize these obsolescent and fragile media and steward their long term preservation, making their contents accessible to the broadest possible audience into the future.\n\nThe Boston City Archives seeks funding to digitize and provide public access to community oral history recordings created by the Boston Bicentennial Commission between 1974 and 1976. Between 1974 and 1976, the Boston Bicentennial Commission recorded oral histories with a wide cross section of Boston’s residents, including members of Boston’s black and immigrant communities. Due to their age and over a decade of storage in poor environmental conditions, these tapes are at serious risk of degradation, and currently cannot be accessed. Transcripts and partial transcripts exist for approximately half of the recordings, and show that interview content includes immigration, the African American experience in Boston, Boston’s social movements, urban renewal, and a wide variety of local history topics. This project will preserve the recordings through digital reformatting, produce descriptive metadata for the recordings, and make the recordings available to the public in the Boston City Archives’ digital access portal.\n\nThe Archives will submit one-hundred-forty-three cassette tapes and ninety-five ¼” open-reel recordings for digitization through Mass Productions in an effort to make accessible and celebrate the heritage of the Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Boston (colloquially referred to as “CSJ”). The reels contain audio from Chapter meetings (1967-1969) during which the Sisters addressed the Second Vatican Council, which called for major social reform in the Catholic Church. The cassette tapes contain oral history interviews conducted in the decades following. The recordings are sisters’ reflections on life in the Congregation and reveal the cultural shift in religious life during the late 1960s. Once digitized, these recordings will be publicly accessible on an Omeka website and subsequently used in the Sisters’ sesquicentennial celebration in 2023. Themes reflected in the recordings include the history of women, Catholic education and deaf education, immigrants,1960s social movements, and the American Catholic experience.\n\nThe Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) seeks to preserve and make accessible 233 live concert radio broadcasts of the Boston Pops conducted by John Williams recorded on 256 analog tapes. This unique collection documents Williams’ growing influence as a film composer including first concert performances of many of his scores, and featuring such guest artists as Jessye Norman, Leontyne Price, and George Benson as well as early career appearances by Wynton Marsalis, Bryan Stripling and Yo-Yo Ma. Recorded on ¼ inch reel-to-reel audiotape, these master tapes have become inaccessible due to the medium’s fragility and the obsolescence of playback equipment. Our vendor will create preservation master files and access files for public use, which will be discoverable via an EAD finding aid and the BSO’s online performance history search engine with links from WorldCat. Scholars often seek out this collection, which constitutes an important part of the BSO’s audio archive.\n\nBowling Green State University’s Music Library and Bill Schurk Sound Archives (MLBSSA), partnering with George Blood, L.P., will digitize filk analog audio recordings on unstable formats. As a musical genre, filk usually revolves around sci fi/fantasy topics and was originally performed in a folk-rock style. The term “filk” is used to describe both the musical genre and the active fan community that creates and sustains the music through conventions and gatherings. The project will digitize 201 commercial master recordings of filk music, containing both studio and live recordings, and 75 cassette tapes of interviews and field recordings. The project will allow MLBSSA staff to provide on-campus access, update existing finding aids, and pursue permissions to allow wider access, making the material more accessible for the filk community and providing primary source material for use by scholars and students at BGSU, as well as scholars researching filk and fandom.\n\nThe “Digitizing Catawba Voices” project will digitize video and audio collections of the Catawba Nation Archives which currently only exist on obsolete magnetic media formats. These collections contain unique recordings of Catawba people over a 30-year period, from 1975–2005. As part of the project, a professional third-party digitization partner will be chosen through the Catawba Indian Nation’s procurement process, and the materials will be packaged, insured, and shipped to the selected vendor for digitization. Originals will be shipped back to the Catawba Nation Archives along with the digital copies created. Digital masters will be stored in a RAID server, with copies stored in the cloud, and on portable hard drives. Metadata will be created for the files, and access provided via the Catawba Nation Archives website. This will enable the Catawba community to access these recordings for the first time in decades, thereby preserving and supporting Catawba cultural heritage.\n\nThe project will digitize a significant portion of the Southern Labor Archives (SLA) audio collections. The SLA, est. 1971, is the largest labor collection in the southeast and documents the history of work and workers in the South, with an emphasis on union records, labor leaders and activists, labor organizations, and oral history recordings across all industry and employment sectors. Audio recordings for this project come from a variety of collections: AFL-CIO, IAMAW, State Nursing Associations, NFEE, Textile Workers Unions, and PATCO. These unique recordings contain histories of workings and interconnections between unions that reflect contemporary issues through the lens of the working class via recordings of meetings, conferences, and conventions between 1949-2005. These are not currently accessible, due to fragility, nonfunctioning playback, and lack of metadata. By digitizing these collections, we will not only make these recordings available online, but also provide better descriptive metadata for greater access.\n\nThis project will digitize 211 audio recordings from the 1980s and 1990s of interviews conducted by Mary Richards, a freelance writer for the San Francisco-based LGBTQ newspaper, the Bay Area Reporter. Recordings include interviews with key figures in LGBTQ history, including Tom Waddell, Jose Sarria, Pat Norman, Gilbert Baker, Virginia Apuzzo, and Alan Selby. The recordings document topics such as the National March on Washington, Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and LGBTQ activism. The project will digitize 199 compact audiocassettes, 11 microcassettes, and 1 CD. The recordings will be preserved in our Islandora DAMS, made publicly available on Calisphere and the Digital Public Library of America, and a detailed finding aid and updated catalog record will be made available on the Online Archive of California. This project will serve scholars, students, and the public by making available unique resources that document first-person accounts of transformative moments in LGBTQ history.\n\nThe project’s purpose is to safeguard, preserve, and make available to academics, historians, and the public at large essential yet little known perspectives of one of the most controversial and combative moments of the U.S.’ relations with the territory of Puerto Rico. The archive contains the most unique, ephemeral and irreplaceable video and radio stories documenting struggles by the people of that municipality and its thousands of supporters from across the U.S. and other parts of the world. Albeit not the most glorious moments of this nation’s legacy, it is a history that cannot be overlooked, forgotten or lost. Because of the precarious conditions of those materials, the archive is also the most ephemeral of that time period. The materials to be digitized include approximately 319 items of the Andrés Nieves Collection, which is described in a separate document.\n\nThe Minnesota Historical Society will conduct a yearlong project to digitize, preserve, and make available (on site and remote when possible) open reels and U-matic tape from our Intermedia Arts Minnesota materials. The sole back-ups of these originals exist on VHS formats, which are also in danger of further degradation. Intermedia Arts highlights early documentary/guerilla television in the 1970s and 80s. Scholars can study still-relevant topics including community involvement, race and racism, urban and rural issues, Minneapolis neighborhood issues, agriculture, musical and dance performances, poetry, women’s issues, sports, disabled persons, politics and government, education, energy, drug use and education, labor, housing, civil rights, and journalism.\n\nThe National Geographic Society (“National Geographic”), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, proposes to digitize and catalog the Crittercam Magnetic Tape Collection, which consists of 2,217 tapes, with input from the original scientists involved in the Crittercam deployments. In 1991, support from the Society enabled Greg Marshall to develop the Crittercam, an animal-borne imaging and data-logging system that can be carried by an animal and provide a creature’s-eye view of the world. We have digitized 413 of the Hi-8 tapes but seek assistance in completing the remaining 335 along with 285 selected MiniDV tapes, which are the most at-risk formats in the collection. After digitization, we will make the videos available to the public via our online discovery platform. This content (video plus metadata) can serve as valuable primary resource material for educators and students. These videos can be a source for learning opportunities that can provide new significance to this past work.\n\nNew York University proposes a 12-month project to digitize and make available unique Chinese Cable TV (CCTV) content from the Asian CineVision Records, originally recorded on analog videotapes and produced by and for the Asian American community. Created in the 1970s, CCTV was a community-led program that sought to add a new voice to representation in the media and assume agency in media production and distribution. CCTV was the first Chinese-language news program in the United States, covering a range of local, national, and international subjects and ensuring that Asian and Asian American voices, images, narratives, and interests were represented on the New York City airwaves. This project will preserve the content on 437 videotapes, which will be migrated from the magnetic media masters and preserved to digital file formats. The files and metadata will be uploaded to NYU’s digital repository and made available to patrons on site and remotely.\n\nNorth Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University’s library seeks to preserve 163 at-risk films in our collections documenting the history of this University and African Americans nationwide, before, during, and after the mid-20th century civil rights era. As the nation’s largest HBCU, these film collections are central to the history of Black higher education and offer a rare view of African American student life between the 1930s to 1970s. The proposed collections include documentaries about alumni Reverend Jesse Jackson, African American history, and home movies depicting African American life in post-World War II America. Once digitized, these films will allow scholars and community researchers to watch the impact politics had on fashion, student life, athletics, and community life of African Americans across four decades. The F.D. Bluford Library will partner with AV Geeks to digitize the materials, improve metadata for the collections, and make these films available via Digital Commons.\n\nUpon her death in 1966, Martin Luther King, Jr. called Lillian Smith “one of the brightest stars in the human firmament.” Smith, a white Southern Civil Rights activist, worked tirelessly to combat racism and segregation. From 1925-1948, she ran Laurel Falls Camp for girls in Clayton, GA. There, she talked to campers about race, psychology, sex, and more. At the camp, we discovered boxes of acetate and vinyl records that Smith and her partner Paula Snelling recorded at the camp and during their travels. These records contain everything from campers stating their names to plays that campers wrote to camp banquets to musical performances at HBCUs to stories about the camp’s mythological Buss Eye. This project will restore these records and digitize them for scholars and the public, providing a reservoir of insight into Smith’s impact on countless women and their connections in the fight for social justice.\n\nThe UC Santa Barbara Library is home to the collection of Rudy Vallée, the singer, bandleader, composer, and pioneering host of America’s first big-time radio variety show, The Fleischmann Yeast Hour. Vallée’s archive is part of the American Radio Archives (ARA), a vast collection documenting the early history of radio in America. Vallée was an innovator not only in radio but in the use of recording technology to document the ephemeral broadcast medium. From nearly the beginning of the program’s run, air checks were made on lacquer discs, which Vallée could then audition later. There are 779 lacquer discs documenting broadcasts during the 1930s, the era of the program’s greatest significance and influence. Lacquer discs have a host of conservation problems and their digitization is critical to the content’s survival. With funding from CLIR, the UCSB Library will digitize all 1930s Vallée recordings held by UCSB for online public access.\n\nThe University of Idaho Library, Special Collections and Archives Department proposes to digitize, preserve, and make accessible approximately 201 hours of first-hand oral history interviews that document the experiences of Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Hispanic Americans, Japanese Americans, and rural women living in Idaho in the 20th century. These interviews currently exist on legacy media formats and include 40 audiovisual U-Matic tapes, 4 audiovisual VHS tapes, 64 open-reel audio tapes, and 64 audio cassette tapes. Once digitized, we will hire a student worker to create item-level descriptive metadata, scan print transcripts and corresponding print material, and add the digitized files and metadata to our digital collections. These interviews offer a unique and important perspective on the experiences of minority communities living in a predominantly white and rural state throughout the 20th century. This digitization project will allow these voices to speak to us again.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh Library System (ULS) proposes to preserve and digitize —with free public access— 350 oral history interviews primarily highlighting the experiences of minority communities, their lives, and their voices, in Western Pennsylvania from the 1970s to the early 2000s. This project will digitize a selection of oral history materials related to African American and European immigrant workers in Pittsburgh’s Steel Valley, including six collections. Combined, these materials will create a rich digital collection of primary sources sharing first-person accounts of African American migrants and European immigrant workers in the Pittsburgh area. One which enables researchers to compare experiences of various waves of migration and immigration from other urban centers in the United States. Through preservation, digitization, and robust metadata, this project will make these at-risk audio resources permanently and openly accessible to scholars, community researchers, students, and the public.\n\nThis project will digitize and make available to the public approximately 105 films, 52 reel-to-reel audiotapes, 160 two-sided Audograph discs and 30 Edison Voicewriter discs from Congressional hearings, interviews, speeches and appearances documenting important anti-corruption efforts in the U.S. Congress of the 1950s and 60s. The material, currently housed on fragile media at the University of Tennessee’s Modern Political Archives, contains an audio record of the entirety of the high-profile Army-McCarthy hearings, which pitted the Army against U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy. In addition it documents the contemporaneous career of Senator Estes Kefauver, who spent much of his career actively opposing abusers of postwar power, be they small town gangsters, crooked city politicians, comic book publishers, or giant steel and drug industries. These materials will provide powerful insight into attitudes toward the responsibilities and limits of power in both the mid 20th century and our own time.\n\nThe Battle Creek Community Legacy Project is a collection of some 318 oral histories, most recorded to cassette tape between 2001 and 2004. The narrators chronicle significant chapters in Battle Creek’s history. Among them is the story of “the Bottoms,” a thriving African American neighborhood devastated by floods and eventually eradicated in an “urban renewal” project, scattering what had been a close-knit residential and business community. Other subjects include wartimes, the Great Depression, the U.S. Army’s Percy Jones General Hospital, and handed-down stories about Sojourner Truth, who lived in Battle Creek. Twenty years after their recordings, this collaborative effort of Willard Library, the Historical Society of Battle Creek and the Sojourner Truth Center for Liberation and Justice will finally make these recordings accessible to the community and to researchers.\n\nThe American Baptist Historical Society proposes reformatting approximately 1300 at-risk open-reel audio tapes belonging to the collections of American Baptist Churches, USA (ABCUSA). These recordings chronical the annual meetings of the American Baptist Convention from 1953-1971 as well as various conferences held at the American Baptist Assembly at Green Lake, WI. Both conventions and conferences invited nationally known speakers. The time period documents transitions in the American Baptist Convention (previously the Northern Baptist Convention, now known as ABCUSA) as members grappled with social issues of the mid-20th century, including civil rights, race relations within the church, war, economic disparity, and abortion. These recordings are not available elsewhere and are currently inaccessible due to condition and lack of equipment for playback. Through digitization and ingestion of master and access copies of the files into Preservica, ABHS will preserve and make accessible critical addresses and discussions that are currently inaccessible.\n\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory is partnering with George Blood, L.P. to digitize ~170 hours of video across 486 tapes (47 VHS, 95 Hi-8, 233 Mini-DV, 59 1”, 45 DVD, and 8 DVCAM) containing the oral histories of groundbreaking 20th century biological research and raw Public-Outreach video footage, then preserve and make them openly accessible. These unique first-person accounts from over 360 scientists include key figures in the molecular biology revolution and 20 Nobel laureates. The interviews, discussions, and presentations in our Oral History Collection detail the history of scientific discoveries, often by those who made them, and illuminate the day-to-day progress of modern biological research, and major scientific endeavors such as the Human Genome Project.\n\nOur raw Public-Outreach footage from 1985 documents scientific and personal life at a non-profit research laboratory through interviews, discussions, and observational footage. All collections discussed will be accessible, with metadata discoverable through ArchivesSpace.\n\nThe FIU Libraries in collaboration with University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) will digitize, create metadata, and provide online access to thousands of unique Caribbean music contained in at risk cassettes from The Diaz-Ayala Collection (DAC) that are not available at any other institution. The digitization of this collection is essential to guarantee preservation and long-term availability.\n\nThe DAC comprises more than 3,000 cassettes, with approximately 1000 songs that were recorded originally in 78rpms by Columbia and Victor Records. The music represents a variety of genres and it is a clear example of the life and conditions of minority groups in areas from the Caribbean.\n\nMajor activities in this project include reformatting of the cassettes into digital, create metadata in FIU-digital repository, share files with UCSB to be uploaded at the Discography of American Historical Recording (DAHR), link metadata to the audio file in DAHR, and contribute metadata to DPLA\n\nAfter the 1950’s, the surveillance of Puerto Rico’s residents was intensified to the point that agencies overstepped citizen’s rights established in the Constitution. The Carpeta files are the result of these historical events that took place between 1960 and 1980, framed by the Cold War culture of generalized fear and suspicion. Among the thousands of cubic feet of illegitimate compiled information by the Police Department, 298 ¼” open reel audio tapes (3”, 5”, 7”) related to political organizations were identified. Through this initiative, we will be able to restore, digitize and provide access to recordings in critical conditions that have never been available, withholding invaluable information that continues to be scarce and inaccessible. These files can also help citizens answer multiple queries about the surveillance tasks that were performed, its relation to the Cold War, if these events affected pro-independence movements, and to continue to enhance accountability where is needed.\n\nCompleting a project begun in 2018, we will digitize the filmed dailies, workprints, and audio soundtrack from the Johanna L. Spector Papers and Audio-Visual Materials. The collection documents the nearly extinct musical and communal traditions of several non-Western Jewish cultures in India, Yemen, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Armenia and elsewhere in the Middle East.\n\nRecorded from 1960 to 1989 during the making of Spector’s ethnographic documentaries, the materials are an unused treasure-trove that sheds light on the religious ceremonies and traditions of people before dispersal from their native lands, such as the Cochin Jews of India, Yemenite Jews, and the nearly extinct Samaritans of Israel. From the success of the CLIR grant for Phase I of digitization, we know that the footage will help build understanding of worldwide Jewish traditions and cultures; these have contributed already to new scholarship in ethnography, ethnomusicology, history and anthropology.\n\nThe Maryland Center for History and Culture (MCHC) proposes to digitize and make accessible more than 300 oral histories providing a significant snapshot of Maryland history, from voices documenting the struggle for civil rights to insight into veteran experiences, labor, religion, and the lives of working-class Marylanders in the city of Baltimore and beyond. These are unique primary source materials that offer the possibility of exploration of the past through the experiences and perspectives of the people who lived it. The audio and video cassette tapes for these oral histories have been largely inaccessible and the need for preservation is critical. Now, with a new digital asset management system and forward-facing Digital Collections portal, the MCHC is poised for long-term preservation and increased access to collections in-person and online, inspiring discovery and new scholarship into the diverse landscape of Maryland.\n\nThe Fray Angélico Chávez Library of the New Mexico History Museum (NMHM Chávez Library) requests support to digitize 217 recordings made by award winning photographer and cinematographer John Candelario (1916-1993). Focused on northern New Mexico’s diverse communities— Native, Hispano, and Anglo—his work reveals a unique insider’s perspective during times of significant cultural change. While his photographs and films are widely known and studied, one important area that remains hidden are over 200 audio recordings. Made between 1948 and 1987, these field recordings include songs, dances, interviews and cinematic soundtracks, some made by anonymous individuals and others capturing the voices of more well-known figures. Most recordings are on reel-to-reel tapes with no digital surrogate and remain inaccessible to researchers and others with an interest in New Mexico’s rich history. Their content coupled with their unstable format underscores this request’s urgency.\n\nThis project will digitize and provide access to 400 recordings of San Francisco Bay Area dance, theatre, opera, and musical performances recorded on the rare, obsolete ED-Beta format by videographer Ted Helminski. The performances document the rich performing arts scene in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1988-1998 and include performances by acclaimed companies such as American Conservatory Theater, Magic Theatre, Oakland Ballet, Alonzo King LINES Ballet, Smuin Ballet, San Francisco Taiko Dojo, Pocket Opera, among others. In many cases, MP+D holds the only recording of these unique performances. Once digitized, the recordings will be cataloged, all catalog records will be accessible online via WorldCat and MP+D’s catalog, and the access files made available onsite at MP+D and online, as allowed by the individual companies and artists.\n\nGalter Health Sciences Library requests $21,695.00 to digitize 82 reels of medical education and archival films shot between 1929 and 1959. Depicted in these films are procedures, conditions, and research in the fields of surgery, obstetrics, ophthalmology, pediatrics, and more, created by Northwestern University Medical School faculty.\n\nFilms will be cleaned, stabilized, and digitized and yield preservation, production, and access copies with metadata files. Galter Library’s institutional repository will host the files and records with robust metadata, and library staff will create linked finding aids with item-level description. We will review each film for content, ethical, and privacy issues, and apply solutions when necessary. Visibility will be enhanced through partnership with medical heritage and Chicago-centered organizations.\n\nThis collection will be one of the very few medical motion picture collections available online and will offer scholars a rare look at medical filmmaking, educational film, medical imagery, medical education, and more.\n\nThe Peabody Institute will describe, digitize, preserve, and make available for public streaming 299 analog recordings from composer Jean Eichelberger Ivey and some of her students and colleagues in electronic music. As a student at the University of Toronto in the 1960s, Ivey was often the only woman in her electronic music composition classes. In 1969 she founded the Peabody Conservatory Electronic Music Studio, the first such studio in a conservatory. The recordings in the Ivey collection contain important examples of early electronic music from the 1960s and 1970s, including works by Ivey and her students for tape and live performers. This project will support scholarship, instruction, performance, and music composition involving the work of a pioneer in electronic music. A fully digitized and online collection will expand opportunities for performers to engage with Ivey’s works and support research in emerging fields such as computational musicology.\n\nThe proposed film digitization project includes approximately 20 hours of footage from the Francis Paudras Film Collection, circa 1959 -1983. The project will contribute to the teaching and scholarship of jazz history and make accessible unique primary sources related to the life and career of jazz legend, Bud Powell. The films are at-risk due to their age, format, and previous storage environment and will be digitized by Colorlab in Maryland. The Institute of Jazz Studies will catalog the films, upload all digital files and metadata for public access to Rutgers University’s digital repository (RUcore), create a publicly available finding aid, and a collection-level MARC record in OCLC and Rutgers Libraries online and publicly available catalog.\n\nThe Preserving and Providing Access to Contemporary Alaska Native History: Voices from Southeast Alaska project will allow Sealaska Heritage Institute (SHI) to digitize a collection of recordings produced by the Southeast Native Radio program in the 1980s to early 2000s. This unique collection documents Alaska Native life, culture, and politics of the time. Interviews were conducted with tribal elders, clan leaders, and other Native people. The collection also includes three and a half hours of conversation entirely in the Tlingit language (previously transcribed/translated). “The quality of these recordings is fantastic … they asked hard-hitting questions that brought about the vital issues of the day,” explained SHI’s archivist when the collection was donated to SHI in 2010 at a ceremony attended by volunteers who worked on the program. Digitizing the collection will allow Native people, scholars, and the public to gain access to this rich collection of Voices from Southeast Alaska.\n\nThe first television station in Maryland, WMAR, began broadcasting its news reports in 1947. The Special Collections and Archives department of Robert L. Bogomolny (RLB) Library at the University of Baltimore maintains a rich collection of these reports with unique footage depicting significant historical events, cultural and racial issues, and political and social changes in Baltimore and the surrounding region. This television news footage has been recorded on a variety of media over time, including U-matic videocassettes, well known as an obsolete medium at risk of degradation. This project seeks to digitize 975 U-matic tapes of this collection from 1980 to 1985 and make them available online to both local and scholarly communities through the Internet Archive website. This is the first step in a larger project aiming to ultimately digitize the entire collection and thereby help preserve the coverage of historical events pertaining to this region.\n\nThe University of Connecticut Library seeks funding for a one-year project to digitize, preserve, and improve access to 243 sound recordings created from a groundbreaking course, “Black Experience in the Arts,” between 1970 and 1990. This course brought Black artists, musicians, actors, writers, and others to UConn to discuss and demonstrate their work, and to participate in conversation. Developed by music faculty Edward O’Connor and Hale Smith and the Center for Black Studies, this course sought to draw awareness to the creativity and contributions of Black artists in all art forms and provide students with greater exposure to the racial and social dynamics in American culture. Digitizing these recordings will preserve and make available these artists’ unique, personal insights, providing a vital resource for those seeking to understand how the creative expression of Black artists was impacted by historical, social, cultural, political, and aesthetic contexts.\n\nWashington University Libraries requests $34,520 to digitize over 1400 audio recordings from the University’s Assembly Series, a collection of public lectures featuring the most prominent voices of the late 20th and early 21st century. Access to these historically significant recordings is extremely limited due to the instability and technological obsolescence of magnetic media. Lectures were held from 1949 to 2008 and featured speakers representing diverse backgrounds, expertise, and ideologies. Highlights include literary voices Audre Lorde and Ray Bradbury; activists Muhammad Ali and Phyllis Schlafly; and academics B.F. Skinner and Angela Davis. Given their broad scope, these recordings support scholarship and research across the humanities. This project seeks to digitize over 629 ¼” audio tapes and 798 audio cassettes, creating digital preservation- and access-level files. Digitized lectures will be made freely accessible to patrons, by request, via the Box platform until their migration to a new digital repository currently in development.\n\nThe University of Oklahoma broadcast the School of the Air program through its WNAD radio station, starting in 1946 and continuing through the 1950s. Like other Schools of the Air throughout the nation, OU’s goal was to provide educational radio programming to assist rural school districts. The OU Libraries seeks funding to digitize 138 open-reel audio tapes of recordings of the show’s history segments, “Know Your Oklahoma” and “Oklahoma Portrait.” Beyond the titles of these segments, there are no descriptions of the recordings. To preserve these unique recordings, it is vital to digitize these at-risk tapes. Digitization will enable the creation of robust metadata to make that content discoverable. Once the School of the Air recordings are accessible through OU Libraries’ repository, they will be a resource for U.S. and state history, the history of education, Native American studies, media studies, and for community researchers.\n\nThe Human-Occupied Vehicle (HOV) Alvin submersible is a national asset. Dedicated specifically to science, Alvin is the only publicly available sub capable of carrying humans to the ocean bottom on behalf of the US oceanographic community. It was commissioned in 1964 by the US Navy and has remained state-of-the-art as a result of numerous overhauls and upgrades. Having completed over 5000 dives, Alvin has participated in significant scientific discoveries that have transformed our understanding of life on Earth. In addition, Alvin was used in 1966 to locate a hydrogen bomb lost off the coast of Spain and famously was involved in the exploration of the Titanic. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Data Library and Archives (DLA) will catalog, digitize, preserve and make available at-risk early film and video (1962-80) that documents the building of the submersible, as well as rare, irreplaceable image data collected at the ocean depths.\n\nThe Arhoolie Foundation seeks a CLIR: Recordings at Risk grant to digitally preserve over 400 hours of video recordings made by renowned music producer and documentarian Chris Strachwitz from 1987 to 2016. Shot on Video 8, HI-8, and Mini-DV, these rare videos give us an up-close and behind-the-scenes view of many of our most treasured regional musicians: Flaco Jimenez, Lydia Mendoza, Fats Domino, Johnny Otis, Ry Cooder, Rose Maddox, and many others. The grant’s purpose will be to protect this unique body of historical material from physical deterioration or catastrophic loss, and to make it accessible to scholars, students, teachers, musicians, filmmakers, and others through online exhibits, public presentations, educational materials, and secure onsite viewing at our physical archive in El Cerrito, CA.\n\nThe International Association of Blacks in Dance (IABD) proposes to digitize and make accessible audiovisual recordings of historically significant material dating back to its inception in 1988. IABD is the world’s largest service organization devoted to preserving and promoting Black Dance. Materials include recordings held by IABD and member companies. Recordings include panel discussions, lectures, master classes, demonstrations and performances that showcase the work of regional, national and international companies. The holdings reflect the diversity of Black Dance. IABD will digitally reformat these at-risk audiovisual materials and make them available to the public via Howard University’sMoorland-Spingarn Research Library; an archive site that will be accessible from IABD’s website; and videos posted to its YouTube Channel. The material provides an inclusive depiction of the rich legacy of the Black Dance experience. Digitizing these recordings will enable artists, scholars, students, educators, general public and future generations to access these treasures.\n\nACT will catalog, digitize, preserve, and make publicly available 132 reels of magnetic audio recordings, featuring over 140 composers and performers, created by the MIT Media Lab’s Experimental Music Studio (EMS) from 1973 through 1988. Founded in 1973, EMS was the first facility in the world to dedicate digital computers to the full-time research and composition of computer music. The studio was responsible for developing and improving technologies including real-time digital synthesis, graphical patching languages, and advanced music languages. The collection features some of the earliest recordings of computer music including works by Joan La Barbara, Tod Machover, Mario Davidovsky, and Charles Dodge, along with other composers, programmers, and artists. Due to the delicate nature of magnetic tape, experimental/computer music from this era is rare, making this collection historically significant to researchers from both music and computer programming fields. Once digitized, the recordings will be hosted on a dedicated website.\n\nThe Museum of Flight will conduct a year-long project to digitize home movies found within our collections. Drawing from 18 separate accessions, we have selected 86 films to be digitized by an off-site vendor. We will hire an intern to create item-level descriptive and administrative metadata records for each file and finding aids for the 18 associated accessions. The digitized files and associated metadata will be added to our online digital collections. The films cover a variety of topics, from glimpses of famous pilots to military scenes spanning the Golden Age of aviation in the early 20th century to the space age in the 1970s. As a whole, the selection creates a sampling of moments from throughout the history of aviation.\n\nLarry Ritter wrote The Glory of Their Times from a series of oral histories he collected over five years, driving over 75,000 miles to find men who played professional baseball from the 1880s through the 1950s. When he found them, he set up his tape recorder and interviewed them. While each interviewee discusses their baseball career, they also discuss what life was like, from turn-of-the-century America to the mid-1960s. From details on industrial labor practices to anti-Semitism after World War II, these unedited interviews are a trove of personal reminiscences. The original ¼ inch reel-to-reel tapes, housed in the archives at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, are in immediate need of digitization. They will be delivered to a professional conservator for stabilization and digital transfer. The original tape will then be returned to storage and the digital surrogates will be made publically available.\n\nNYU Special Collections proposes digitizing, preserving, and making accessible (both onsite and remotely) 727 recordings of the weekly radio program “Beyond the Pale” (BtP). From 1995-2014, BtP aired on WBAI, a non-commercial, listener-supported radio station. Varying in programmatic format from interviews to debates, the recordings document the reflections, opinions, and analyses of progressive and leftist Jewish activists, artists, politicians, historians, and writers including: Naomi Klein, Howard Zinn, Eric Foner, Adrienne Rich, Tony Kushner, William Kunstler, and others. The program presented an international perspective in its reporting and addressed such still-critical topics as United States imperialism, the Iraq War, Palestinian sovereignty, Ethopian Jewish identity, Israel, and the Middle East peace process. US-centric reporting unpacked a wide range of subjects such as domestic violence, disability justice, sex work, policing and incarceration, LGBTQIA issues, anarchism, labor, and racial justice and equity.\n\nIn the 1960’s, Ocean Alliance President, Dr. Roger Payne discovered that humpback whales sing songs: one of the most enigmatic behaviors in the natural world. The discovery helped to spark the save the whale movement, shifting the public’s perception of whales to intelligent and sentient animals. It also played a key role in the birth of modern whale biology and remains one of the most studied facets of whale behavior. Ocean Alliance has 331 magnetic audio reels of whale song recordings from the 1950s to the 1990s that are in dire need of digitization and preservation. These recordings contain whale vocalizations from waters of Alaska, Bermuda, Chile, the Galapagos, Sri Lanka, and Africa. The incredible biodiversity makes these archives unmatched in scientific existence. Whale song evolves over time—naturally and in response to human activities—these recordings are essential for understanding how whales contend with a rapidly changing ocean.\n\nNorth Carolina’s Senate Daily Legislative Session Audio Recordings (SR.66.25), 1993-2005, were made on open reel tapes using a Dictaphone Veritrac device, an analog medium nearing obsolescence. This project seeks to convert this Senate audio into digital files to facilitate (1) long-term preservation in our Digital Repository and (2) online access through the North Carolina Digital Collection. Major activities will include sending the tapes out to a vendor for digitization, resulting in preservation masters (WAV) and access copies (MP3); creating preservation and access metadata, uploading the products to our preservation and access platforms, and preparing for their long-term management.\n\nThe Senate audio record series comprises the official audio records of the chamber’s daily floor debates, documenting the activities of North Carolina’s General Assembly. Major points of debate include topics of national importance, major events affecting citizens of North Carolina, and day-to-day government decisions that affect the lives of all North Carolinians.\n\nThe goal of this project is to digitize at-risk films, videos, and recordings that document an important period in the history of science: the early years of studying the global climate through atmospheric and Earth system science research. The materials to be digitized include original observational data films, field experiment documentation, and educational productions that were created as part of the mission of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The materials will be sent to a local, qualified vendor for digital reformatting, preserved as part of the NCAR Archives’ digital preservation program, cataloged, and shared through NCAR’s institutional repository.\n\n155.5 hours of the nearly 950 tapes from the KUAC-FM Audiotapes Collection at UAF, are to be digitized by the Northeast Document Conservation Center. Recordings will be accessible via the internet through the UAF Library Catalog via WorldCat. The collection will be of interest to historians, scientists and researchers around the globe. Over half of the material is from the Chinook subseries and relates to Alaska and circumpolar Indigenous issues, land claims, Athabascan ways of life/religion, Native corporations, alcohol issues, language documentation, Eskimo songs and stories, health issues; and interviews with notable Indigenous Alaskans such as Willie Hensley, Chief Andrew Isaac, Effie Kokrine, Byron Mallot. The other half of the proposed material are from 4 other subseries and topics include interviews with international academics, poets, and authors, with topics such as Alaska Aleut culture, teen pregnancy, infant care, log building, programs on aurora research and prediction, seals and permafrost.\n\nUniversity of Arizona Libraries Special Collections seeks funds for stabilization, digital reformatting, digital preservation storage and public access for ninety films in the Andrew Ellicott Douglass papers (AZ 072). A University of Arizona professor and dendrochronology pioneer, Douglass was an early adopter of amateur moviemaking technology, recording his academic undertakings in astronomy, climate science, and especially the tree-ring record, which illuminated the chronology of ancient human settlement in the Southwestern United States. On 16mm and 35mm film, Douglass produced early film images of ancestral indigenous settlements in the Americas, and documented significant breakthroughs in scientific practices and research from the 1920s through the 1950s as they happened. The films’ significance across scientific disciplines and implications for interdisciplinary study cannot be overstated. The University of Arizona continues to lead in the fields of tree-ring research, climate science, planetary science and astronomy, thus availability of these films for ongoing scholarship is vital.\n\nThe University of Delaware will digitize unique and currently inaccessible audio recordings from four political collections held in Library Special Collections, covering forty years of Delaware politics. The focus of the grant, the William Satterfield collection of Delaware political radio commercials and interviews, documents the political environment in Delaware between 1970 and 1984. The voices of candidates and public officials, ranging from local politicians to the President of the United States, will be available for the first time since these commercials and interviews originally aired, conveying policy stances and the state of political discourse in Delaware during the 1970s and early 1980s. Other notable recordings included in this project are speeches and interviews from United States Senators John J. Williams (R, 1947-1970) and J. Allen Frear, Jr. (D, 1949-1961), who represented Delaware during two historically significant decades in the mid-20th century. The reformatted recordings will be accessible via Artstor Commons.\n\nThe Marr Sound Archives at the University of Missouri-Kansas City holds over 400,000 audiovisual items, with a focus on the American experience as reflected in recorded sound. Included in the collection are 62,000 radio broadcasts, many of which are currently being digitized in-house for preservation. A small portion, however, are lacquer discs that are too severely damaged to be digitized with conventional audio equipment. The non-contact method used by the IRENE audio preservation technology, located at the Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC), is currently the only solution to obtain the content from the damaged discs. The broadcasts were recorded in the 1940s and include world news, news commentary, radio dramas, and performances by the Kansas City Philharmonic. These unique primary resources hold a piece of history and reflect the culture of the period, which will prove fruitful to researchers in the fields of history and media.\n\nThe University of Washington Libraries, Special Collections (UWSC) proposes a 12-month project to digitize, preserve, and make accessible 338 videotapes created by filmmakers and activists during the 1999 protests against the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle, Washington. The videotapes from the Independent Media Center (IMC) collection offer a unique perspective into a historic moment that brought together grassroots activists, labor leaders, environmentalists, farmers, anarchists, and artists who made history and shaped social justice movements around the world.\n\nThe IMC videotapes will be digitized to preservation standards with access copies made publicly available for the first time both on-site and online. Detailed descriptions of the contents of the videotapes will be added to the collection finding aid, as well as, to the files posted online. This rich metadata will provide students, scholars, and researchers access to primary resources with a unique perspective on historic events that captured the world’s attention.\n\nThe Vassar College Archival Recordings collection captures nearly 80 years of collegiate music traditions, oral histories, and intercollegiate and local collaborations between faculty, students, and the surrounding community. These unique recordings help to document changes in higher education, including Vassar’s transition from single sex to a co-educational college, and are valuable to scholars in fields ranging from gender and cultural studies, to musicology and local histories. Much of Vassar’s collection is deteriorating, inadequately cataloged and inaccessible to researchers. Digitization will foster scholarship in this under-researched area by preserving this rich primary source material. In this project, Vassar Libraries will partner with the Northeast Document Conservation Center and George Blood Audio Visual to digitize recordings at greatest risk, provide online access, enhance metadata, ingest master files and metadata into Vassar’s digital repository, and promote this collection.\n\nThe project will digitize a major collection of currently unavailable, historic jazz recordings, and provide descriptive metadata and audio examples online for jazz students and scholars. Attila Zoller was a major post-WWII jazz guitarist, born in Hungary and moving to the United States in 1959. He quickly became an in-demand guitarist at the highest levels of jazz. His personal archival recordings document his work in Europe, Germany, New York City, and his country retreat in Vermont. On these open reel and cassette tapes, Zoller is heard performing with influential jazz musicians such as John Abercrombie, Paul Bley, Al Haig, Jimmy Heath, Lee Konitz, Scott LaFaro, Cecil McBee, and many others. These recordings are currently not available for research due to their fragility; the project will stabilize and digitize them, as well as make them available online. The Zoller collection is a unique and irreplaceable record of important jazz performers.\n\nThe goal of this initiative is to transfer and provide access to 200 currently inaccessible and decaying half inch open reel videotapes produced by a pioneering Rochester, NY media organization who created some of the earliest citizen made documentary television in the United States. The videos on the Portable Channel tapes are a unique and important resource for the public, for teaching, and for research in many disciplines including media studies, visual studies, communications, women’s studies, cultural studies, history and American studies. Because the material is currently inaccessible and endangered, digitization is the only way to ensure access now and over time to this important trove of historical material covering a critical decade in American life. Visual Studies Workshop will contract with Standby to transfer the tapes and will share the videos and metadata created during the project with the public onsite, through VSW’s website, and on VSW’s online collections.\n\nYa-Ka-Ama, which translates to “our land,” aims to digitize the remaining tapes of its media collection in order to provide access to current and future generations seeking knowledge of essential historical and cultural content held on obsolete tape media. The tapes include a chronicling of tribal leadership, practices, events, reënactments, teachings, and celebrations from the late 70s to early 90s featuring Native American tribes from Sonoma, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and Marin Counties in California, as well as those in Hawaii and Alaska.\n\nYa-Ka-Ama recognizes that it is critical to immediately digitize these vulnerable recordings for two reasons: 1) we are located in a fire-endangered region of Northern California and 2) many of the people recorded are no longer living or near the ends of their lives, resulting in it being nearly the last time Ya-Ka-Ama can accurately meta-tag its media with personal verification and historical accuracy.\n\nThe YIVO Institute proposes to digitize recordings of 2,000 Yiddish folksongs and oral histories collected as part of the YIVO Folksong Project directed by Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett from 1973-1975. This collection is a one-of-a-kind, large-scale gathering of oral histories centered around traditional Yiddish music.\n\nEastern European Yiddish folksongs and music are especially valuable for study because the Yiddish-speaking Jewish ethnic minority was distributed over a vast and culturally diverse geographic territory. The songs in this collection show evidence of great interethnic interaction and present rich opportunities for understanding the repercussions of this interaction on the musical system of Eastern European Jews.\n\nBecause of the destruction of Yiddish culture during the Holocaust, these recordings represent the most comprehensive collection of remaining sources of live performances of Yiddish folksongs in the world.\n\nThis project will allow for preservation reformatting and distribution online, thus making them accessible to researchers and the public.\n\nThe Braxton75 Archival Recordings Project seeks CLIR support to digitize, preserve, and make accessible 777 items of high priority audiovisual materials of composer, MacArthur fellow, and 2014 NEA Jazz Master Anthony Braxton. This singular collection by the most significant American experimental music composer of the last 50 years is a treasure trove of Braxton’s work from 1970-2014. These materials have been boxed, barcoded, and inventoried and are currently being held in the Tri-Centric Archive in New Haven. These materials will play a key role in Braxton75, our initiative honoring Braxton’s 75th birthday throughout 2020. Partnering ensembles and educators will animate our collection through study and performance of these new archival recordings. We plan to donate the digital collection to Yale University’s Irving S. Gilmore Music Library, a portion of which will be made discoverable and accessible via Archives at Yale in 2020 with the remainder becoming completely available in 2021.\n\nThis project proposes to digitize 345 magnetic audio and VHS tapes and make them accessible via the Brown Digital Repository (BDR). Colleges and universities provide a unique platform for prominent individuals to expound ideas of great historical significance and offer resonant social commentary. Speeches by leading public figures invited to Brown University between 1950 and 1995 document changing intellectual and social currents taking place across the United States on topics that resonate today such as social justice, politics, education, and the media.\n\nLibrary staff will identify themes documented in the audio-video materials that are especially relevant for current scholarship, with a particular focus on growing the historical record of agents of social change. The University Library will publicize the availability of the digital files through the Library website, blogs, professional and academic listservs, and social media. The Library will produce a publicly available white paper detailing project methods and workflows.\n\nThe Vanderbilt University Libraries requests $46,694.50 to support the preservation and conversion from analog to digital of 1,321 audio cassette tapes, a portion of the Manuel Zapata Olivella Papers, housed in Special Collections. As one of our collections most visited by scholars, it reflects the burgeoning field of Afro-Hispanic research. The tapes include radio programs, conferences, World Congresses of Black Culture, and ethnographic interviews documenting wide-ranging topics (e.g., indigenous and Afro-Colombian religion, traditional medicine, marriage and death rituals, music, dance, food, magic, slave ancestry, handicrafts, street theater, folklore, and social behavior). The materials will be publicly accessible from the Library’s Manuel Zapata Olivella website with links to the interview records and transcripts where available. We received a 2018/19 grant to outsource 426 tapes, as a pilot for design and workflow for this larger proposal. Ultimately, the corresponding photographs will be linked to the interviews creating an audio and visual record.\n\nThrough the Voices of Labor: Preserving the Montanans at Work and New Deal in Montana Oral History Interviews project, the Montana Historical Society proposes to preserve and reformat oral history interviews on analog cassette tapes that document the working lives of Montanans. The interviews capture the stories of Montanans in the mining, agriculture, and forest products industries, as well as Montanans working in Depression-era New Deal programs, especially the construction of the Fort Peck Dam. Created in the 1980s and consisting of 521 interviews on 959 compact cassettes, these interviews represent the recordings in the MHS oral history collection that are most at risk for deterioration and/or those with the most significant content. MHS will work with George Blood, L.P. to create audio master files, technical metadata, and audio access files. Access files for the recordings will be made freely accessible to the public through the Montana Memory Project.\n\nTulane University Special Collections seeks to digitize, preserve, describe, and make accessible 243 cassette tapes from its Hogan Jazz Archive collection. The Laurraine Goreau collection contains 109 cassettes chronicling the legacy of the “Queen of Gospel,” Mahalia Jackson. Interviews with Jackson and her close associates, including American icons like Ralph Abernathy and Ella Fitzgerald, provide an intimate portrait of the singer. They doc"
