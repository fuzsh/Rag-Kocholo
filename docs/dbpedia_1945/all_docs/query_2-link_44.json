        "text": "Convocation: Wednesday, August 28; Superintendent's Conference Day: Thursday, August 29\n\nWelcome back to school MVCSD Faculty and Staff!\n\nI am thrilled to welcome all faculty and staff back for Convocation on Wednesday, August 28, and Superintendent’s Conference Day on August 29! With schools opening soon, I am fully confident in the outstanding team we have in place to start the year. We all work diligently and eagerly to provide a quality education to our scholars, and that commitment means the world to me and our students. This year, just like last year, I know that our students are in the right hands to excel.\n\nYou are essential to our success as a District, and you play such a valuable role in furthering and accomplishing our mission. Our faculty and staff have exceeded my highest expectations during my time as Acting Superintendent, and I am so grateful for each and every one of you.\n\nWith your hard work and support, our schools are becoming beacons of education, and our students are consistently going on to achieve their goals and dreams. Our theme this year is “Back to Basics, Forward to Mastery.” As we continue to advance this District, keep this theme in mind in everything we do. We have brought back the basics, now we can move forward to achieve great outcomes for our students.\n\nFor those of you who are new to the District, we have the utmost confidence in your ability to contribute greatly to our schools on a daily basis. We are working together towards the same goal, and each of you fit perfectly into our team of educators.\n\nMy Cabinet and I will be here to support you, as you work to ensure our students have everything they need. Every day you provide a safe, equitable and supportive environment for our scholars, which I have the utmost appreciation of.\n\nI will be here year-round to assist and encourage you. Whether you need guidance, or a problem arises, I am committed to making this a collaborative work environment. Please don’t hesitate to email, call or sign up for a meeting with me to discuss your roles and how I can assist to make you more successful. Happy New Year!\n\nWarmest Regards,"
