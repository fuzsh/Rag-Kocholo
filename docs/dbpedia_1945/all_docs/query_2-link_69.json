        "text": "George Adams\n\nKnown as Ranji, owing to his complexion and shock of black hair, George Adams was a tough full back who joined the club in 1934 from Knebworth. He made his debut in November of that year and went on to win a Spartan League championship medal at the end of that season. He played over 200 games for the Canaries, including a handful after WW2.\n\nEddie Armitage\n\nDespite his spindly appearance and mature looks, Armitage was a feared centre forward with the remarkable knack of scoring goals. He signed for Hitchin from Luton Amateurs, a few days after scoring a hat-trick against the Canaries in the FA Cup. He made 155 appearances for the club, scoring 195 goals. The 1931-32 season saw him score 82 goals in 44 competitive appearances!\n\nTerry Barrett\n\nHitchin Town’s current Chairman has given over 30 years loyal service to the Club. Terry joined the Club in 1990. In his time with the Club, Terry has spent most of his time serving on the Isthmian League Board and then later, following our transfer in the 2004-05 season, the Southern League Board, where he still holds the position of Honorary Vice-President.\n\nDon Birdsey\n\nDon was one of the most informed of all Hitchin Town officials. He documented the club’s fortunes until the early 1990s and as a local journalist (“Birdseye”), had an encyclopaedic knowledge of players and matches. The son of E.C. Birdsey, who was an official of the club from reformation, Don also had a brief spell as chairman of the club. His family carry on the tradition of watching the club today.\n\nJon Bone\n\nMade over 700 appearances for the club in three spells. A versatile player who could appear in central defence, at full back, or in midfield. An England schoolboy cap. He made his first appearance in 1986 and retired in the 2003-04 season.\n\nClaude Brown\n\nA club stalwart whose involvement lasted from the late 1930s to the 1970s. Claude was an England schoolboy international and made his debut for Hitchin at 17 in 1938-39. His playing days ended in 1953 after sustaining an injury, but he was an integral part of the club for many years after, assisting a host of managers and coaching youngsters. He died in 2010.\n\nCyril Buck\n\nCyril Buck was a name that was well-known throughout non-league football. In his long association with the club, which spanned over 40 years, punctuated only by a spell as manager of Letchworth, he was best known as secretary of Hitchin Town. His son, Chris, was also involved with Hitchin Town.\n\nMark Burke\n\nAnother 700-plus appearance maker. Joined the club in 1985 and retired in 2005. Captain of the club’s FA Cup giant-killing sides of 1994 and 1995, and skippered the Canaries to two promotion campaigns. Continued to serve the Club as First Team Manager for 11 years between 2013-2024. He is still the Club’s Company Secretary.\n\nCecil Cannon\n\nTall goalkeeper who played for the Canaries between 1930-35 and played in the AFA Senior Cup final of 1932 and picked up a Spartan League title winners medal in 1935. A gentlemanly figure, “Tiddler”, as he was affectionately known, was capped 50 times by Hertfordshire and played almost 200 games for the club. In a long and distinguished career, Cannon also played for Cambridge Town and St. Albans City.\n\nDennis Chapman\n\nA club stalwart who was involved – along with his wife Vera – for more than half a century. As a player he was a tough tackling full back who also enjoyed playing up front. Also a more than useful cricketer and was once a local referee.\n\nLes Clarke\n\nA club stalwart who graced Top Field from the mid-1930s to the late 1940s. A member of the Spartan League title side of 1935, his career was interrupted by the second world war, but he remained at the club afterwards and played a part behind the scenes for some years.\n\nSteve Conroy\n\nScorer of the first goal in the historic FA Cup win over Bristol Rovers in 1995 and the only Hitchin Town player ever to be interviewed (by Tony Gubba) on “Match of the Day”. During his playing career, Steve had three separate spells at Hitchin Town between 1988 and 1996, during which time he made 112 appearances and scored 51 goals.\n\nAlan Cosby\n\nIn the generally grim decade that was the 1980s, Alan Cosby was a talented player who captured the hearts of the Hitchin faithful. A skillful and hard-working midfielder, “Cosser” had his fair share of setbacks, notably a terrible double leg-break sustained at the peak of his career. When Hitchin were relegated in 1988, Cosby moved to Barnet, but he returned in 1991-92 after helping Chesham to promotion the previous season.\n\nTerry Craddock\n\nTerry Craddock was one of coach Laurie Scott’s best signings for the Canaries and became one of the great characters on and off the pitch in a golden era for the club, during which he appeared in two FA Amateur Cup semi-finals. He had come to Hitchin’s attention as an inside forward, appearing against the Canaries in August 1957 for Letchworth Town. A much-coveted youngster, Craddock signed for Hitchin in 1959. He made 271 competitive appearances for the club, scoring 58 goals. He later played for Baldock Town.\n\nDonnelly Family\n\nIf any family name was to be seen as synonymous with Hitchin Town FC, it would be the Donnellys. Three generations of the family have given sterling service to the Club over the past 65 years. Jim Donnelly made two first team appearances in 1950 and 1951, and played several times for the Reserve team. Jim’s son Ian made a total of 16 First Team appearances in the 1989-90 season, scoring two goals. At this time, Jim’s son Paul was Reserve team Manager. Ian was also Assistant First Team Manager to Robbie O’Keeffe and then Kerry Dixon between 2002 and 2004.\n\nDennis Gibbs\n\nDennis Gibbs had two spells with the club and was a reliable defender who always gave 100%. He first joined the club in 1955, making his debut against Cambridge City at Christmas of that year. Aside from a short spell with St.Albans, he was a fixture in the side until 1967-68, making a total of 549 appearances for the club. A member of the 1961 FA Amateur Cup semi-final side, Dennis skippered the Canaries on a number of occasions and was always considered a great clubman. After he hung his boots up, Dennis filled a key role at Watford, where his son Nigel played.\n\nMaurice Howkins\n\n508 appearances and 17 goals between 1966 and 1981 in three spells with the Club. Maurice was a member of the highly successful Hitchin Town team which finished as runners-up in the Isthmian League in 1968-69, the Club’s highest ever League placing in their history, and also a member of the legendary London Senior Cup winning team of 1970. Currently the highest appearance maker in Hitchin Town’s history (7th highest of all time) who did not have a place in the Hall of Fame.\n\nTony Huckle\n\nClub President and loyal Club Servant for over thirty years, “H” was unstinting in his support of the Club during some challenging times for the Club. He attended home games and a number of away games to support the team until his passing in November 2020.\n\nRoy Izzard\n\nClub stalwart who has loyally served the Club in many roles since the 1970s – Assistant Treasurer, Fixture Secretary, and he is the Club’s current Football Secretary and Treasurer. Since then you can count the number of Hitchin games he has missed (including training games!) on the fingers of one hand. Simply, `Mr. Hitchin`.\n\nTony Luff\n\nPopular goalkeeper who played for the club from the early 1980s to the 1991-92 season. Signed for the club after Bedford Town folded and his reliability and confidence were key in a difficult period for Hitchin. He left the club following the departure of Steve Norris as manager in October 1991.\n\nShaun Marshall\n\nShaun will always be remembered for his FA Cup exploits in 1994-95, when he scored vital goals at Burton Albion and Hereford and in the replay against the latter. He had two spells with Hitchin – between 1993 and 1995 and then 2000 to 2002. He scored over 100 goals for the club and some of his strikes were quite spectacular. Also played for Stevenage, Enfield and Boreham Wood.\n\nTony Martin\n\nTony made a total of 386 appearances for Hitchin Town in three spells with the Club between 1972 and 1981, scoring 20 goals. An unsung hero whose contribution to Club history could be easily overlooked because he played in a Hitchin team whose success was limited, although he was part of the team who had the most successful FA Cup run in the Club’s history – missing out on the 3rd Round Proper in the 1976-77 season after a narrow 2nd Round Replay defeat at Swindon Town. Currently 11th in the list of all-time appearance makers for Hitchin Town.\n\nAndy Melvin\n\nManaged Hitchin from 1991 to 2001, with a short break in 1996. He led the club to two promotions and was the mastermind of the club’s FA Cup success in 1994 and 1995. Has also been an influential figure behind the scenes at Hitchin since 1991.\n\nHughie Pratt\n\nA very talented and learned player whose career included a stint in the USA. A former Corinthian Casual, Hughie joined the club in September 1968 and involved two spells. He was a vital member of the team that finished runners-up in the Isthmian League in 1969 and won the London Senior Cup in 1970. He also played for Stevenage.\n\nIan Scott\n\nSkilful midfielder who joined Hitchin in the summer of 1992 from St.Albans City after being released by Luton Town. A superb passer of the ball, “Scotty” became a very popular figure at the club and played more than 500 games for the Canaries. He retired at the end of 2004-05 season.\n\nReg Smith\n\nA winger who went on to play for England in the late 1930s after appearing for the Canaries between 1930 and 1935. Signed from Pirton and the became a pivotal member of the club’s Spartan League championship side of 1935. Joined Millwall that season and enjoyed success in management later on in his career.\n\nCarl “Charlie” Williams\n\n484 appearances and 35 goals for the Club in three separate spells between 1997 and 2012. Carl became Assistant Manager to Colin Payne in 2009 and then spent three seasons as Team Manager from 2010 to 2013, during which time he achieved promotion from the Southern League Central Division to the Premier Division.\n\nGary Williams\n\nA trojan of a player, Gary had three spells with the club, initially joining in the summer of 1992 from Baldock Town. He joined as a player who could appear at the back or up front, but it was his role as a marauding centre forward that he made his name. He was a pivotal figure in the club’s promotion in 1993 and then the two FA Cup runs that followed. He left to join Hayes in 1996, but returned in 1997, playing mostly as a centre half. He then joined Bedford in 1998, returning briefly in the 2002-03 season before moving to Australia. A popular figure, whose selfless running and ability to hold the ball up helped make the reputations of others.\n\nVic Wayling\n\nVic, real name Valentine, epitomized the word “stalwart”. He filled many roles in his time with the club, but he will be remembered for his long stint as Hon.Secretary. He masterminded the Hitchin Football Museum, reputedly the first of its kind. He was also well connected, rubbing shoulders with the likes of FA and FIFA officials. He stepped down in 1973, but his son, Ken, carried on the tradition.\n\nFrank Wingate\n\nFrank was one of Hitchin’s first post-war stars. A native of St.Ippolitts, he joined the club in 1945-46 and formed a lethal partnership with Wink Saunders. He netted 40 goals in 1946-47 season and another 25 in 1947-48. He left the club in 1948-49 and later played for Stevenage."
