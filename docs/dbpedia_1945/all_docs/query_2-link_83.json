        "text": "Competing in Paris for his second Olympic Games, Rai Benjamin ran the 400m hurdles in 48.82 seconds and won his heat, securing an automatic qualification to the semifinals on Wednesday, August 7, 2024, at 1:35 p.m. Watch live on NBC and Peacock TV.\n\nRai Benjamin is a 2015 Mount Vernon High School alum, and he received silver in the 400m hurdles in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. He ran the fastest 400m hurdles time in American history during those Olympics at 46.17 seconds. Benjamin also holds three of the top five times in the world for the event.\n\nRai Benjamin, who is competing in the first round of the 400m hurdles at the Paris Olympics Monday, August 5, 2024, began his career as a freshman in Mount Vernon High Schoolâ€™s elite track program during the spring of 2012. Originally a football player, Benjamin quickly found a drive to be the best hurdler during his first year in track as a freshman.\n\nAt approximately 3:15 p.m, a ceiling in one of our classrooms at Graham School collapsed. The room was not being used this summer and all students were outside at the time of the incident. Fortunately, none of our students or staff members were injured.\n\nPlease know that the safety of our students and staff continues to be our highest priority. Students and staff will not be permitted in the area of the building impacted by the collapse until we can determine the cause of the incident and are assured that the entire building is a safe environment for our students and staff members.\n\nWe will continue to update the community regarding the condition of the building and our plans for September to the greatest extent possible in the coming weeks.\n\nMVHS alum Rai Benjamin will compete in his second Olympic Games starting Monday, August 5, 2024. He will run in the first round of 400-meter hurdles on August 5 at 4:05 a.m. EST. Watch live or on demand on Peacock TV and NBC. The repechage, or second chance, race will be on August 6 at 6 a.m. The Semi-Final race will be August 7 at 1:35 p.m., and the Finals will be August 9 at 3:45 p.m.\n\nThe Mount Vernon Board of Education will hold a Special Meeting on Wednesday, August 7, 2024. The video capturing hardware required to stream board meetings for the school district on the Panopto platform is currently being configured and is not yet ready for live streaming, so the August 7 meeting will be streamed on Facebook Live. The first meeting to be aired on Panopto is being planned for Tuesday, August 20."
