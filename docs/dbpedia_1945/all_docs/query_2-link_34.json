        "text": "Devin Hester will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on Saturday. Remarkably, he scored 6 touchdowns on returns in each of his first two seasons (7 on punts, 4 on kickoffs, and 1 on a missed field goal). In the Super Bowl era, no other player has more than one season with at least 3 touchdowns on kick returns. Who was the last player other than Hester to score 3 TDs on kick returns in a season?\n\nThe magazine is exactly the same as last year, which is perfect. Boys, we have a chance to repeat in the 33rd year of the NWFFL. I am counting on you to help pull it off. FI has been a league staple for decades, one of my guys has every edition. A few years ago, we devised a clever way to use one of your lists to draft a team for an absent owner, the sob won it all. We love you guys. Peace!\n\nHi, received my copy over the weekend and I think it's the best work you guys have done (I've been reading your publication since 1988). The writing is terrific and full of good humor, along with more substance than anybody else has.\n\nKeep up the great work!\n\nI'm in 3 leagues. All have different formats. I bought one magazine, the same magazine for 30 years. I keep the Fantasy Football Index handy and refer back to your preseason reports throughout the season to help me evaluate roster moves in every format. This week I'm in two championship games and a semifinal. Did I tell you I'm in three leagues? Three playoff teams! Best fantasy season ever. Thank you.\n\nThank you for all you do and what your team does. Been playing since mid 90s and your mag has been there every year. The mailer I get with the questions on the front is what I consider the beginning of the fantasy football season. Get the updates and listen to the podcast. I write a weekly column for the newspaper I work at and always appreciate the work you put in to produce as much as you do. Just a fan saying thanks and will keep up with you and the site through the season.\n\nA little feedback from a long time customer.\n\nOur fantasy pool is entering its 25th year and I have used multiple books and on-line tools over the years.\n\nI have locked on to Fantasy Index as my go to for the last 5 years and have won the pool 3 of those years and finished no lower than 4th.\n\nInteresting to see how much more accurate you were at the end of the year compared to other books my competitors used.\n\nHaving it in a format that allows me to work the forecasts to match our scoring system and then receive updates as the season approaches is invaluable. Whoever your sources are for the forecasts are the best. Hang on to them. Thanks for the help!!\n\nI did receive the updated draft ranking from you guys in plenty of time for my draft that night. My draft report gave me an A+ and predicted me to go 14-0 and win my league! I just want to say thank you for the excellent customer service that your company provided me. When I first started playing fantasy football more than 15 years ago, I used to buy as many fantasy football magazines as I could find. It wasnʼt long before I only purchased Fantasy Football Index each year. It is by far the most comprehensive, well written fantasy football magazine on the market. Also, I almost always rank in the top three in my fantasy football leagues, and won my league last year. Thank you to you and all of your great team. You have a customer for life!\n\nThank you for all the updates etc. In the last 14 or 15 years, we have placed in the top three 9 times winning it all 4 times. I have been a customer of yours for many years. Our success is partially due to luck, but I think your magazine with all of the good stuff has been a real contributing factor. Keep up the good work. Will be a customer until the time I can't read anymore.\n\nI just wanted to send everyone at Fantasy Football Index an apology. Since 2003 (Ricky Williams cover), I've protected my source of information and have gone out of my way to hide Fantasy Football Index from my leagues prying eyes. I've won championships in leagues and money playing Daily Fantasy and your Training Camp updates are the highlight of my summer and a recurring order for me every single season. I just wanted to Thank You and everyone there (customer service, the writers, janitors, secretaries and assistants) for your hard work and dedication.\n\nYou are appreciated and valued part of my Fantasy Football Operations department even if i never speak your name in fear that others in my league will discover the wondrous bounty of knowledge contained in your pages…\n\nFrom the bottom of a champion's heart,\n\nI wanted to send a quick note and thank you for your great magazine! The information you provide, has allowed me to win my league 3 years in a row!\n\nThe payoff in the league is not bad, six hundred dollars to be exact, but it is those all important bragging rights that really make it fun!\n\nI epically enjoyed this last issue because you included all the covers for the past 30 years, I did not buy 87, and 88, but all the rest I have purchased.\n\nAll I have to do is read and then plug and play, thanks again for doing all the work so I don't have to, except for cash the check of course! Lol.\n\nI will be continue to purchase your magazine, and recommend it to others, although I don't like to give away my secret!\n\nI typically don't write emails to magazines, but after 3 wins in a row, and others which I did not list, I felt like you would like to know.\n\nThanks again to you and your staff,\n\nThis is my ninth year competing with my two very savey adult children and their 11 regulars to make it a 14 team draft with a $200 bid limit. Your SuperFanatic package has put me into the 6 team play- offs 4 out of the 8 years and there is no way I could compete with these guys without my cheat sheets! They still have no idea how I can be so lucky every year :-) Cheaters do prosper!!!!\n\nI wanted to thank you for such an amazing product and your customer service. I ordered the wrong date for my update and called to correct the mistake. Your customer service person was very kind, helpful and took care of the issue immediately.\n\nI have used your product for the past 18 years or so… Every now and then I will be tempted and look at what other magazines have to offer, quickly realizing no one comes close.\n\nIn addition to the magazine, I started buying the weekly updates years ago when my dad taught me a lesson. The draft came and dad was sitting in the 12 hole for his pick. He told me he felt very comfortable about who he was going to select but would not tell me who his prized gem was to be. I was doubtful. The pick? Priest Holmes (his first dynamite year). I remember telling my dad, \"that is a decent pick but they plan to pull him at the goal line.\" Ever the teacher, dad explained he had purchased the Fantasy Football Index update and read Holmes would get the goal line carries. \"Update?\", I asked. That was 2002 and Holmes had 21 rushing TDs and Dad won the title! Lesson learned.\n\nBy the way, I have made the title game for the last 5 years in a row. Thanks for the detailed, hard work and an great product!"
