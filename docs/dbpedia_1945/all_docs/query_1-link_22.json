        "text": "A mainstay of Southern Colorado courtrooms for more than four decades died Saturday.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Cecil Turner died from natural causes, District Attorney Bill Thiebaut said in a news release. He was 69.\n\nTurner graduated from the University of Colorado School of Law and joined Pueblo's legal department as an aide in 1967. Less than a year later, Turner was made deputy district attorney by then-District Attorney Carl Parlipiano.\n\nHe rose through the ranks in the department over the next nine years, earning the positions of chief trial deputy and assistant district attorney under Parlipiano and his successor, Joe Losavio.\n\nIn 1976, Turner entered private practice. He tried cases statewide and in New Mexico, Arizona and Kansas. He also served on the state attorney general's organized-crime task force and lectured at the National College of District Attorneys.\n\nThiebaut brought Turner back to the district attorney's office in 2005.\n\nThiebaut recalled that Turner interviewed him when Thiebaut first applied for a job with the district attorney's office 36 years ago. Over the years, Turner helped guide Thiebaut through the practice of criminal law and the two became friends, Thiebaut said Sunday.\n\n\"I knew a different side of Cecil that he permitted few people to see,\" Thiebaut said. \"Beneath his rough veneer was an amazingly gentle and generous man who always stepped forward to quietly help people in need whenever he happened upon them.\"\n\nThiebaut said Turner refused any notoriety for such acts.\n\n\"He was a loving husband and father and his family loves him thoroughly. I have been proud to call Cecil Turner my confidant, counselor and friend. I will miss him dearly.\"\n\nDefense lawyer Karl Tameler was the chief trial deputy in Pueblo when Tuner returned to the prosecutor's office in 2005.\n\n\"Cecil was a consummate advocate for all of his clients,\" Tameler said Sunday. \"He was well-known as a master of the cross-examination and was able to really effectively get people who were opposing witnesses to trip up on the stand as few people around here have been able to do. He will be missed and was an integral part of the legal community in Pueblo.\"\n\nThiebaut said he's confident his staff, however saddened, will be able to meet the challenges of the unexpected loss.\n\n\"They have proven time and again that they are able to continue providing these services regardless of the daily challenges they have faced during my six years as district attorney,\" Thiebaut said. \"I have no doubt they will be able to do the same in spite of this latest tragedy and our heavy hearts.\n\n\"Cecil wouldn't want it any other way.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending and are being handled by Montgomery & Steward Funeral Directors."
