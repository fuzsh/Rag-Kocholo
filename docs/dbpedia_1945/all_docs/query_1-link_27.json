        "text": "A federal judge has vacated the corruption conviction of a former supervisor for the Illinois secretary of state's office.\n\nCecil Turner was convicted on four counts of wire fraud in 2006 for covering up a scheme in which three janitors were paid for hours they didn't actually work.\n\nTurner did not take any illegal money. He was convicted on the legal theory that he denied taxpayers the honest services they deserved.\n\nSince then, however, the U.S. Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of \"honest services'' violations.\n\nThe State Journal-Register reports that Turner appealed, and Judge Joe Billy McDade agreed to reverse the convictions.\n\nTurner remains guilty of two counts of making false statements to investigators."
