BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nAlso:\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of National Football League career interceptions leaders\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of most consecutive Pro Bowl selections by National Football League players to start a career\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of most consecutive Pro Bowl selections by National Football League players.\n\nBeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nNo comment on the respective lists' notability, but the nominations seem fair when none of them have demonstrated WP:LISTN yet:\n\nOne accepted reason why a list topic is considered notable is if it has been discussed as a group or set by independent reliable sources, per the above guidelines; notable list topics are appropriate for a stand-alone list. The entirety of the list does not need to be documented in sources for notability, only that the grouping or set in general has been.\n\nIt's usually best to add those sources at list creation time. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nHonest question, because I'm mulling over the best way to approach our NFL list articles, what do you think we should do? Should we, for career total pages, link to articles which mention where they finished stat wise for their careers? Should we link to a HoF page that mentions said career total as a point of accomplishment? I've thought about various sources I could add, but I've had concerns that I would be bombarding a table with too many references. One other possibility that I've liked when I've seen it was adding pictures of individuals on the list, a small blurb under said picture, and references in that description that would help to show some coverage and mention of the statistic. I like to work on these list articles and I'm willing to put work in to help ensure they aren't deleted, but I always find I have trouble finding the best place to start and would love some input. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nNot an NFL page. but take a look at List of National Basketball Association franchise career scoring leaders. There's prose based on independent sources that talk about the grouping.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nThat List of National Football League annual pass completion percentage leaders is up for deletion boggles ze mind [Edit: initially surprised me]. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nI could understand how they might assume that the completion percentage page is fluff if they're not familiar with the NFL and their metrics, so I don't fault them. Not everybody is familiar with which stats may be notable and which are not. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nHey man im josh, you're right. I wasn't assuming good faith. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nJim Griffin, a DE who played 3 yrs in the 1960s, doesn't seem to have an article. My newspapers.com subscription is pending renewal, so I can't look into it. Leaving this note here if anyone interested to research and possible create Jim Griffin (American football). —Bagumba (talk)\n\nNow added. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nThanks, now I can check off an item from my enormous list of articles needing to be written :) BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nThanks. I was somehow possessed to create a page for Charlie Joiner's high school, and Griffin came up as an alumni. —Bagumba (talk)\n\n@Harper J. Cole: Just a couple quick comments about the article: Number 1, half sacks are presented as as a decimal not as a fraction, just see any box score or sack stats on NFL.com. 2, The sack stats on pro football reference from before 1982 are unofficial and they acknowledge this on their career sacks page. This because sacks were not an official NFL stat until 1982. Because of that I did go ahead and remove it.--Rockchalk717\n\nIs that a convention? Randomly, I tried Deacon Jones, and his unofficial numbers are in his infobox. Should document this, either way it's decided. —Bagumba (talk)\n\n@Bagumba: Not that I'm aware of, however, I know one of the core fundamentals on Wikipedia is sticking to what is official (like when a transaction occurs, we don't update until it's official) which is what I'm basing this on.--Rockchalk717\n\nThe sack stats for Deacon Jones were added about a month after the PFR link was added by an editor that I've had issues with when it comes to transactions in the past, so it seems like (at least with Deacon Jones in particular) that the editor may be unaware that why try to stay from what isn't official.--Rockchalk717\n\nSimilar to some of the items in Category:WikiProject lists of reliable sources? BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nIt can only be a good thing. People just need to put the time into it, and be willing to discuss the borderline ones. There's an in-progress one for the NBA. My peaves are the bloggy sites like most of SB Nation, SI's Fan Network, much of early years of Bleacher Report (hard to tell even now their full-time vs amateurish writers). If something is important enough to mention, more reliable sites should exist for the same content (esp. for NFL). —Bagumba (talk)\n\nAll,\n\nThe 1996 San Diego Chargers and 1996 Indianapolis Colts articles were recently updated to say that the game the two played against each other is the shortest on record at 2 hours and 29 minutes. While the edits, made by a new editor, didn't carry citations, a search on \"shortest NFL game\" does yield results from both CBS and NBC supporting this.[1][2]\n\nOn the other hand, looking at the game stats, it seems unlikely that a game with 20 penalties, 38 incompletions and 28 possessions could be the shortest.[3] A contemporary newspaper lists the game time as 3 hours 27 minutes.[4]\n\nShould I...\n\nLeave the statements as they are and add the citations?\n\nRemove the statements as probably wrong?\n\nAmend the statements to make it clear that they are claimed by some sources and contradicted by others?\n\nThanks, Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nI must say, even if it was 2 h 29 m I still doubt that would have been the shortest NFL game – back in the early days, there were no commercials and teams almost always ran the ball (I'm talkin' 1920s ball, if any of you remember those days :)), and in a few cases, games were called with as much as an entire quarter remaining. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nAs for what you should do, I'd go for option three – Amend the statements to make it clear that they are claimed by some sources and contradicted by others. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nHonestly, a statement that has contradicting sources should be completely excluded, not even mentioning that there are contradictory sources. I can't find any policies to point in the right direction, just an essay which is more of a recommendation than a policy.--Rockchalk717\n\nI think the key is if its a reasonable contradiction. We shouldn't automatically remove, as some sources just have errors. In the end, its up to common sense and consensus. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nSince IND was 18-44 passing,[5] it seems like the clock would have stopped a lot. If nobody is clamoring for its inclusion, remove it. If we include something that is reasonably disputed (WP:WEIGHT), I'd at least put an explanatory footnote (often its too cluttered to get into the details in the body). Something like \"shortest game\" is insignificant to a season page anyways, esp. if its dubious. Maybe more imporatant to a list of game times.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nPer the official game book (here), the game lasted 3 hours and 27 minutes. I'm not sure why CBS and NBC think it was almost an hour shorter, but this seems pretty conclusive. – PeeJay\n\nCurrently there's about 3,000 articles that say in the lead \"who is currently a free agent\" or \"who is a free agent.\" For all those whose last team was in 2019 or prior, we should be changing it to say \"[Name] is a former American football ...\" rather than \"[Name] is an American football ... who is currently a free agent.\" BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nShould it be 2020 or prior? I thought that, generally, we had concluded that 2 seasons out of the NFL is enough to label someone as \"former\". Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nYou could do that, too. Though, the reason I chose 2019/prior was because I saw a few people recently who had been out of football since 2020 get signed into the XFL. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nAssuming they did not renounce their citizenship, they are not former Americans, but rather American former football players.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nHi, Bagumba! In these cases, I think they mean (former) (American football) players, referring to American Football rather than European. Though I understand the point, anyone reading this could easily think they're \"former Americans,\" since it's quite ambiguous. Is there a solution to maybe remove that confusion altogether? SPF121188 (talk this way) (my edits)\n\n@Spf121188: It should be like GA Peyton Manning: \"American former football...\" Per MOS:TIES, use American English, as it's just called \"football\". All the other non-U.S. soccer players just use \"football\" as per British English. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nLooking at our articles, it seems the vast majority say \"is a former American football\" (over 12,000) compared to \"is an American former football\" (just over 200). BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nI do know of an editor that if it's not at least two years, it'll be reverted. I've been removing 'currently'.\n\nNow if you're really bored .... just add U.S. I'm guessing by 2026 I'll be done with them. I'm believing that BeanieFan11 was correct in his amount of articles out there, lol. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nThere's another 200+ of \"is an American professional football\". AFAIK, most pro sports bios specify \"professional\" in the lead sentence.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nWikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#User:BeanieFan11 and WP:BATTLEGROUND at NFL AFDs. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nLaDainian Tomlinson is currently up for GA review, and the reviewer has questioned whether his pre-draft measurables have reliable citations.\n\nI'm unclear on whether the first two sources, nflcombineresults.com[6] and draftscout.com[7], are reliable. These two sources contradict each other, e.g. on the 40-yard dash times.\n\nBased on their \"About\" page, NFL Combine Results looks more reliable to me, but I'd appreciate any other opinions on this. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nFor NFLCombineResults, I'd say reliable. Their work has been cited by other websites/newspapers multiple times: Bleacher Report; the NFL itself; SB Nation; the NY Jets; Fansided; Syracuse.com; 247Sports; Rivals.com; Mercury News; and others. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nFor DraftScout, I'd also say reliable. Its also been cited by several newspapers/websites: Detroit Free Press; Salt Lake Tribune; Cincinnati Enquirer; Fansided; Sports Illustrated; and WDAY radio. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nAs for which you should follow, I'd go with NFLCombineResults.com, as that seems a bit more \"reliable\" as it seems to be cited in reliable sources more often than draftscout. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nI think it's all WP:FANCRUFT. The related {{NBA predraft}} was unanimously deleted in 2021.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nI see your point; I don't know whether Tomlinson's measurables are good or bad by the standards of running backs, really. There's a lack of context. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nI'd gather that applies to 90% of our readers. And then we make a bulky box out of it, to get out of writing prose (at least it wasn't dumped into the infobox). —Bagumba (talk)\n\nNFLCombineResults.com is not reliable. They are a random standalone website not affiliated with any major website. Their data contains combine results from before combine results were released publicly. They even in their About section of the website openly state \"Accuracy is not guaranteed\".--Rockchalk717\n\nFirst off, no website written by people can be perfectly accurate at all times. Next, their about page says that they get their information by checking major sources such as CBS, NFL.com, and ESPN. And third, several other reliable sources treat this source as a reliable source of information (as shown above). So, I stand by my opinion of reliable. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nWhile that is true, they aren't going to openly admit to not being accurate. CBS, ESPN, and NFL.com might be good for combine results over the last 20/25 years. Just to pick a season at random, I cannot locate any websites besides that one that could pass WP:RS with 1995 combine results, while 2005 NFL combine results are extremely easy to find from reliable sources. Pro Football reference (who was even able to research and get data for sacks before it was officially tracked in 1982) doesn't have combine results from before 2000. NFL.com doesn't show any data from before around 2005 (from what I saw), ESPN doesn't provide combine results from before 2005, and CBS doesn't have a database of combine results, so where did they get their information from? If no other major source has data before 2000, where are they getting their information from? I didn't wanna bring this up, but another reason I question the reliability is I know someone who 100% for sure participated in the combine in the 1990s and I cannot find his combine results on that webpage. Just purely based on cross checking their information versus what other webpages have, it is most certainly not reliable.--Rockchalk717\n\nSee Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Al Young (American football, born 1902). BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nSee Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Johnny Hendren. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nJust wondering what the rationale for listing retirements whilst the YYYY season is on-going in the YYYY+1 season page, and not as I might expect in the YYYY season page? 2A02:C7C:60E0:1100:630B:5EE:BA31:77C7 (talk)\n\nAre these retirements happening after the team has been eliminated? I'd be inclined to think of the Chargers' 2023 offseason as starting the day after they lost to Jacksonville, for example, even though the 2022 NFL season as a whole is still ongoing. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nIt would appear not - for instance in the 2023 season it says <!-- Players who played in 2023 and retired mid-season are to be listed in the 2024 season page, NOT this page --> (and similarly in 2022, 2021). The 2023 page says the season starts in September. 2A02:C7C:60E0:1100:630B:5EE:BA31:77C7 (talk)\n\nI do think mid-season retirements should be listed in that same season. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nI know it has been this way for the last several years and am not sure the reason for this outside of the overplayed “that’s how it’s been for years.” I could go either way as long as it is consistent. But as a comparable, players who are traded during the season (also listed under player movement) are listed during the same season as well. Frank Anchor\n\nTom Brady retired after his team's playing season was completed. The premise is that x players have retired entering the xxxx season, noting who will not be playing in the season that had been considered active in the prior season. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI know I could be bold and just do it, but I figured I'd ask first instead since it would affect every team. I'd like to add a \"See also\" section to the team staff templates which would point to the team roster template. This would be similar to how the roster templates have a see also section pointing to their counterpart. I'd then also include the staff link under the see also section of the roster templates to keep things consistent.\n\nIt's something I've wanted to for a bit for easier navigation and browsing of relevant templates and rosters. Is there opposition to this? Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nDone Added the staff template to the see also section of the roster and vice versa since there were no objections. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nAll,\n\nA number of lists have a color and symbol for members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. I'm wondering how we treat the period between the class being named and formally inducted? E.g. Don Coryell in Los Angeles Chargers Hall of Fame. Should his name be in blue, perhaps with a note that he's scheduled for Pro Football Hall of Fame induction? Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nI see the induction itself as a formality. The voting is over, the results are announced, and at this point the induction is more or less just a formality. They've also already got the inductees' pages up (Don Coryell's page). I believe we should treat them as if they're in the hall. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThere's a user who today has been going around and nominating lots of NFL player articles for deletion. See:\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ja'Quan McMillian\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sam Babcock\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ruel Redinger\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Williams (guard)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Marv Smith\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stan Robb\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/John Comer (American football)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Larry Green\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Willie Flattery\n\nBeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nSome of these are very silly nominations. Someone who played 30 games should not be nominated for deletion. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nAll of them are questionable, but some are downright bad. LEPRICAVARK (talk)\n\nAs a courtesy update, Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Williams (guard) was non-admin closed and sent to deletion review here. Frank Anchor\n\nAnd now the nominator is saying (on their talk) I do not plan on nominating less for AFD in the future if there's no policy against it – and reverting users asking him to stop! There NEEDS to be a rule against mass afd nominations like this. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nPerhaps see the outcomes of this set. If, in fact, someone has a poor history in a particular area, and discussion does not lead to a resolution, a WP:TBAN might be considered. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nThere's no potential for discussion when the editor reverts comments without responding. LEPRICAVARK (talk)\n\nI vacated my close and reopened the AfD in question. LEPRICAVARK (talk)\n\nI am absolutely shocked that people would support deleting players like Williams – ALL-PRO, 30 games (22 as a starter), an important member of one of the greatest football teams ever, and an original NY Giant. This website's notability rules have become a load of garbage since that wrongly-closed discussion from a few months back (although it seems to have started back with Vainowski about a year ago). BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nFor those not already aware, you can add Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/American football to your watchlist to see when relevant American football deletion discussions are started. Just wanted to put that out there since there's only 48 page watchers as of this moment. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nAnd now he's brought me to ANI: Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#User:BeanieFan11 and WP:BATTLEGROUND at NFL AFDs. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nThese AFDs and ANI reports are so upsetting for me to see. At times, I wonder why I even contribute to this website overrun by deletionists. It seems they don't even care all the time I've put into improving articles. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nI can empathize with your frustration. I for one really appreciate the research you do for these AFDs; the sources are always helpful in making a decision and often interesting to read through as well. Although it seems like some of the examples above are going to end up as redirects, I don't think that's intended as a reflection on your work instead of a disagreement about in which form the information should be presented. For some of these lesser-known players, it's definitely feasible to write about what is known about them in a section of a list instead of in a separate article, and even though that's a significant difference from how things used to be, I hope the perspective that it doesn't make much difference for readers is at least understandable. Besides, these decisions can be changed if more sources about the players are discovered, as you've rightfully pointed out is definitely possible. TLDR; don't despair! Hatman31 (talk)\n\nThey're just getting purely nonsensical at this point. Tagging me as an SPA? Really? BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nFor several of these discussions the deletionists were arguing that \"there's not enough coverage to write a biography\" – well look at what I was just able to turn Stan Robb into (and I'd say that was one of the weaker cases in relation to GNG!) BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nOver at List of Canton Bulldogs players, there's a user who's repeatedly removing all redlinks because he's saying that if they don't have a page they can't be listed at all. I've never seen anywhere say that. Does anyone here know if there's a consensus on this issue? BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\n@BeanieFan11 As far as I know he is wrong on that part. Per WP:LISTN If the group or set is notable (i.e. the list in question), the individual items in the list do not need to be independently notable. On a sidenote, I would suggest adding sources and maybe the years the player in question played or the team to make the list more informative. And if the red link is a problem, just remove the link itself. Alvaldi (talk)\n\nAlvaldi makes a great point here. If the issue is just with red links, just take off the links themselves and keep the player name. SPF121188 (talk this way) (my edits)\n\nWhat would be the justification to include non-notable entries on the list? Generally lists on wikipedia don't have those. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\n\"Because the subject of many lists is broad, a person is typically included in a list of people only if both of the following requirements are met: The person meets the Wikipedia notability requirement. The person's membership in the list's group is established by reliable sources.\" WP:LISTPEOPLE There are exceptions made, but none of them apply here. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nExcept that WP:LISTPEOPLE starts by saying \"Because the subject of many lists is broad...\" This particular list is not broad and so does not fall into that category. Rlendog (talk)\n\nDoesn't say it only applies to broad lists. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nNote that all of these problems can be avoided if these aren't structured as lists, if the page is just Canton Bulldogs players then you can have entries (with text and bio) of players who aren't independently notable. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nSee WP:NOTBURO. Rlendog (talk)\n\nWhich part? Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nThe top part that says \"Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy.\" Rlendog (talk)\n\nHow is that section title related to this discussion? Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nEven structured the way you suggest this would inherently be a list of players that played for this team. So if you are just saying that it would be acceptable under LISTPEOPLE if it were renamed to remove the word \"list\" from the title, that is just asking for bureaucracy. Rlendog (talk)\n\nNo a lot of work would have to be done, not just renaming the article. You'd have to add sources for each one and come up with some sort of organization. You understand the technical difference between list form and prose form, correct? Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nSources should be added to each one regardless. I understand the technical difference between lost form and prose form, but inherently this would be a list of players with some information about them. And that information should be added and sourced. But it would still be inherently a list article, even if structured as you suggest and so LISTPEOPLE would not have any more or less applicability. Rlendog (talk)\n\nIf its a stand alone list it shouldn't have sources at all... Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nA stand-alone list shouldn't have sources at all? Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nEvery single person who played for Canton Bulldogs should be listed here. The point of a list such as this one is to present an exhaustive all-time roster for the team. The population for this sort for a list is a discrete set based on inclusion in definitive sources such as NFL.com and pro-football-reference.com. Contrast this with a moral general list like List of 20th-century writers, which could never be practically exhaustive of all sub-notable writers. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nExhaustive lists are for important positions like presidents and governors, why would we have an exhaustive list for a football team? Especially since nobody seems to cares about this list... Outside of the bump from the current discussion it gets maybe 12 visits a month. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nYOU may not care, but I and others do care about these lists. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you or I care about it. We have a content guideline Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists and a policy guideline WP:NOTESAL which both of us have to follow. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nI agree – we have to follow those guidelines. And this article meets those guidelines, so... there's no issue here. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nHow can that be when there are red links all over the page? We're only allowed to do that in special cases. See the content guideline \"In a few cases, such as lists of people holding notable positions, the names of non-notable people may be included in a list that is largely made up of notable people, for the sake of completeness.\" and just to be clear \"Member of the Canton Bulldogs\" is not a notable position, owner or coach might be though. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\n\"Member of the Canton Bulldogs\" is not a notable position – we'll just have to disagree on that. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nWhy? Its not a position of important, power, or significance. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nAs I said, we'll have to disagree here – you may not believe that playing for a National Football League team is important, but I do. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nNo matter what team it is? Whether its a world famous team or a team that nobody knows about? Again we're talking about a list that gets in the low two digits of hits a month in an ordinary month, that means its not important and nobody cares about it. You can't argue with the numbers, your personal opinion is irrelevant. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nView count does not determine if a topic is \"important.\" And you can't say that \"nobody cares about it,\" because right here you have several editors who do, and that automatically makes that statement false. I'm done arguing with you here. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nLow two digits means nobody cares. You know that. If its an important position then prove it. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nFor the last time, that does not mean nobody cares. Even if only one person viewed the page ever, that's still a person who cared and so you can't say \"nobody.\" BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nHow in the world are you getting the impression that by \"nobody\" I mean literally not a single person when I'm talking about low double digit visits in the same sentence? I think you know what I mean and I think you know I'm right. Nobody cares, it isn't an important position. I'm open to changing my mind if you can present sources which treat the position as important. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nThis has gotten to the point that I feel like we're running in circles and getting nowhere. Not that I think support will change HEB's stance, but I will say I agree that the list shouldn't be deleted. Some of us believe the list is notable and worth having on Wikipedia, HEB does not agree, and that's fine, we're allowed to disagree. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nWho said anything about deleting the list? Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nStruck part of my comment, per clarification offered by HEB that they believe the list is notable. They're discussing the best way to present the information, not whether it should exist or not. I apologize for the misunderstanding. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\n@Hey man im josh: you need to strike the inaccurate claim you made about me at the very least. You don't have to respond but you do have to strike the lie. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nYou were saying (repeatedly) that nobody cares about the list (which is, again, false), questioning why such lists exist, and pointing to notability guidelines saying \"we have to follow\" them. That sounds like implying AFD to me. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\n\"there's a user who's repeatedly removing all redlinks because he's saying that if they don't have a page they can't be listed at all\" as you said this is about redlinks, there is no good faith way to say that I proposed deletion or argued for it. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\n@Horse Eye's Back: Perhaps I'm wrong, but I've interpreted your comments on this discussion to mean that you don't think the list should exist on Wikipedia. Was I wrong in my assessment? I have no issue with someone suggesting ways that a page can be improved, and if that's all you're trying to do, then I am sorry for the misinterpretation. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nAt no point has anyone mentioned deleting the list, nothing even close... We're discussing whether non-notable players should be included in it. Strike it. Now. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nThough, what does saying \"nobody cares\" a million times, suggesting we need to follow the notability guidelines, and questioning why such lists exist have to do with redlinks? BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nIn order for something to be a redlink it has to be notable. We're arguing about this [8] vs this[9]. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nBut it does not have to be notable to be on the list... (and you don't know that players are non-notable, either) BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nYes it does... Except for a few exception like important positions (Presidents, CEOs, owners, coaches, etc). Its not up to me to establish that they aren't notable, that burden falls on you. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nAnd playing NFL football is important... BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nSo this is all about redlinks and redlinks are all about notability... Is this where you apologize? Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nThis discussion has been a massive waste of time... I'm out... BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nIf you're out then so are the red links, you need a consensus to keep them on the page. I don't need consensus to remove them. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nHorse Eye's Back, did you really tell Hey man im josh to \"strike his comment, now?\" I read through this and I'm very confused about why you're so passionate about this, but more than anything, I couldn't ignore your tone toward BeanieFan and Hey man im josh. You don't just tell someone to strike a \"lie\" when he clearly understands the situation... it would behoove you to check the arrogance at the door and be civil, or else nothing will get accomplished. SPF121188 (talk this way) (my edits)\n\nWe are required to strike or remove inaccurate assertions we make about other editors, specifically I've asked for \"Some of us believe the list is notable and worth having on Wikipedia, HEB does not agree.\" to be struck. How does he understand the situation? I also believe the list is notable and worth having on Wikipedia, I've literally never said anything to the contrary. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nAll,\n\nThe WP:LISTPEOPLE article gives the following example: On the other hand, a list within an article of past school presidents, headmasters or headmistresses can contain the names of all the people who held this post, not just those who are independently notable. I believe this situation is analogous, so I vote to keep the names in question. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nHow is being a player on a team analogous to being a school president, headmaster or headmistresse? Wouldn't the analogy for the players be the students of the school and the analogy for school presidents, headmasters or headmistresses etc be the head coach, GM, or owner? Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nI'd say it's analogous in that they're both groups of people who meet three criteria:\n\nNotable enough as a group to merit a list on Wikipedia\n\nNon-notable enough that not everyone on the list will merit their own article\n\nA small enough group that the list can feasibly be comprehensive\n\nHarper J. Cole (talk)\n\nSeems a bit loose... Its not analogous in that there is no logical way to order the list. With school presidents etc you go chronologically so that each person who has held that position is accounted for, empty spaces would be awkward and would have to be explained some way anyway. This list is alphabetical and its order conveys no real information to the viewer so it looses nothing from skipping non-notable people. I'd also point out that is much more analogous to the previous line \"For instance, articles about schools often include (or link to) a list of notable alumni/alumnae, but such lists are not intended to contain everyone who verifiably attended the school.\" as players are direct analogues for students/alumni/alumnae. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nI'd say that the key point with alumni is that there would likely be too many of them to include (my third point of comparison above. I'm not sure about the chronological vs. alphabetical distinction. Perhaps asking a question on the Lists talk page is best? I'm part of the NFL project, which may prejudice my perspective. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\n@Horse Eye's Back: Thank you for clearing that up. It helps to know that you believe the list is notable, that was not obvious to me and may not have been obvious to everybody involved. I assumed wrong and that makes me an ass, so for that, I apologize and I will strike that part of my comment. With that said, I do appreciate and agree with SPF121188's comment. There was no lie told, there was a misunderstanding. I think you have a lot to offer and I want to hear you out, but I would appreciate a less combative tone. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\n@Hey man im josh: Fantastic. I must say .... you're a better man than I am. Keep doing what you're doing. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nhello :)\n\nIs StatMuse seen by Wikipedia (or at least the WikiProject for the NFL) as a reliable source to use for NFL statistics? HappyBoi3892 (talk)\n\nStatMuse, an artificial intelligence company, is the leader in conversational search for sports stats and information. - They're a sports database and, in my experience, they've always been correct when compared to other sports databases when the question is phrased properly. I've used them as a reference when other sites don't list particular stat tables. When I do so I do it knowing it's likely not the best source, but it's better than no source and I haven't found it to be incorrect yet.\n\nI used StatMuse recently to improve List of National Football League players with multiple 1,000-yard receiving seasons. My only problem with StatMuse is that it cuts off after 25 players. In the query I made to update that page I found receivers who weren't listed but I also found that some receivers were cut off (Henry Ellard and Lance Alworth).\n\nAs for the phrasing I mentioned earlier... I just realized the query I linked is flawed while typing up this comment. I asked for wide receivers with the most 1000 yard receiving seasons when I should have asked for players. So it's good when used properly and when you don't need more than 25 results. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\n@Hey man im josh and HappyBoi3892: You may be interested in a discussion currently going on on whether to deprecate the source. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nWell that's a case where society, sports, and culture should have been notified instead of Media, the arts, and architecture. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nYou don't think that would be a severe case of CANVASSING? :) BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nTreat them as a WP:PRIMARYSOURCE. If a stat was important enough, then it generally should have been mentioned by WP:SECONDARYSOURCEs. We don't want to provide WP:UNDUE weight to random stats.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nHi all,\n\nFor the regular season standings, the division standings are split so the AFC divisions are on the left and the NFC divisions are on the right. However, for the conference standings, both divisions are on the left, one after the other (Example here). I think it would look cleaner if the conference standings matched the division standings with the AFC on the left and the NFC on the right ( ). My old edit was reverted (rightfully) for consistency with the other seasons. However, I think this would be a positive change for every season visually, but do not want to make that decision unilaterally.~\n\nThanks,\n\nWiki9814 (talk)\n\nNo, the conference standings tables have too many columns to look comfortably on those with 720p-width or smaller monitors and devices. And the recent implementation of the default Vector 2022 skin which has further decreased the width of the available space. Zzyzx11 (talk)\n\nOkay, so the other day the 2023 USFL Draft was held. Players from college were selected, just like in the NFL Draft which takes place in a few months. My question is: if someone was drafted by a USFL team, do we state in the lead that they are a player for the USFL team or what, since they could possibly later on be selected by an NFL team? I'm asking because I was thinking of doing articles for a few of the USFL picks, but am not sure exactly how to do it considering this. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nIt's probably never been an issue for unsigned NFL picks, becuase it's the top league and they presumably will eventually sign. For the USFL, i'd remove it if they are drafted by multiple leagues, but still unsigned. —Bagumba (talk)\n\n@Bagumba: So, for the infobox, have the person listed as playing for the USFL team with a status of \"unsigned draft pick\" (but remove it if they decide to go to the NFL instead)? Also, what about the lead? Do I say, \"Beanie McBeans is an American football quarterback for the Philadelphia Stars of the United States Football League (USFL)\" or not? BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nJust say what the sources say. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nThe sources say that the players were drafted by the team, and that's it. Saying in the lead \"[Player] is an American football [position] who has been drafted by the [Team] of the [League]\" doesn't sound right. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nWhat doesn't sound right about that? Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nI think it's because we typically mention the draft portion in the second or third sentence of a lead on football players. The typical format is roughly: [Player] is an American football [position] for the [team] of the [League] (league abbrev). [Player] played college football at [school] and was drafted by the [team] in the [x] round of the [draft] by the [team]. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThat doesn't seem like the appropriate format to use in this context. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nFor about two years, I've been keeping track of recent NFL players (who have played in a game) who do not currently have articles. Here's the ones still left from my list:\n\n2021\n\nMike Horton (American football) - Panthers ([10]), now XFL, three games\n\nMichael Joseph (American football) - Bears ([11]), currently free agent, one game\n\n2022\n\nMike Brown (defensive back, born 1999) - Browns (now Titans) ([12]), three games (recently deleted due to being created by a sockpuppet)\n\nZack Johnson (American football) - Titans ([13]), one game\n\nVi Jones - Seahawks ([14]), three games (same case as Brown)\n\nManny Jones - Cardinals ([15]), four games (same case)\n\nJa'Quan McMillian - Broncos ([16]), one game (as a starter) (same case)\n\nI'd greatly appreciate if someone could create any of these. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nI'm not much of an article creator, but I've wanted to give it more of a shot. I'm starting to work on Mike Brown (defensive back, born 1999) now. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThanks! :D BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nI gave it a go. I think it's better than some of the player articles out there, but I know it could be better still. I'll revisit later on to try to improve it further. Hopefully some changes will have been made by others that help me learn for the next article I create. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nImpressive! The only issues I found were quite minor (second listing of a team in infobox in playing career should be delinked; for active players, put \"NFL career stats as of 2022\" rather than \"NFL career stats;\" and I re-used a ref; then also, although not required, a section with some info about his early life / college career would be nice). Nice work! BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nThanks for making those changes. I've got a busy day at work at the moment, but if these aren't taken care of before then, I'll try to knock out another one tomorrow. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nKnocked out Ja'Quan McMillian. I'll probably take on Vi Jones next. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nVi Jones completed now too. Taking a break from article creation now for the day. Might try again at some of the remaining ones on Monday. Again, please do critique what I've done so that I can get better. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThanks. I took a look and they seemed mostly fine, the only issue I noticed was at the end (one line above the categories) there should be something that says {{DEFAULTSORT:last name, first name}} tbh I don't know why that's needed, but I've seen in the past people complain about it not being on there and it seems just about all bios have it. Also, sorry I haven't been able to help out with these; I've got this one long draft I've been working on, then I also need to save an article from afd, and my three favorite teams are about to play in the conf. championships, plus I've got other things going on. I should be able to get to some of these by Monday/Tuesday if you need a break from writing. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nNothing to apologize for, you don't need to do it all! I'll add the default sort in moving forward for any new pages I create. Funny enough the Ja'Quan McMillian article has already been nominated for deletion. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nEdit to avoid this section archiving. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nI see there's a few pro football players who died recently missing articles:\n\nDoug Fisher (Steelers 69-70) - February 12 (first reported February 22)\n\nKevin Bell (Jets 78) - February 11\n\nJohn/Johnny Cagle (Patriots 69) - January 18\n\nRoger Bonk (Blue Bombers (CFL) 65) - February 13 (first reported February 23)\n\nI'd appreciate if anybody could write any of these. Fisher and Bonk would be eligible for the recent deaths section of WP:ITN if of sufficient quality. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nHow do you even find all these all the time? I'd be curious to see a list of players that need articles by number of games played. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nHehe... Unfortunately I do not have that. But here's a few of the ways I find missing pro football player articles: for the recent deaths, I use this facebook profile which gets just about all of them (and check if they have a page), for recent debuts, I check every week on the main page of PFR under the section \"recent debuts\" – and if there were more players that made their debut than they list, I check one of their pages which lists all of the debuts from that season (when I see one who doesn't have an article, I add it to a list I have at my home of wiki-stuff to do and at this point I don't even know how many pages long it is) – another way I find players missing articles is to look at Tavix's NFL player lists and check the redlinks (usually looking at PFR and PFA, then looking on Newspapers.com and other sources to confirm notability); I also sometimes look at some of those player lists discussed below, and sometimes look at Wikipedia:WikiProject National Football League/Articles to create. Those are the main ways I find missing players. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nSeveral NFL player articles have been nominated for deletion:\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bill Collins (American football player)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charlie Richardson (American football)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Howie Slater\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cliff Baldwin\n\nBeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nLooks like Cbl62 improved a couple of them significantly, so that's pretty awesome. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nYou may be interested in this village pump discussion on the draftification of nearly a thousand Olympians. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nWhile looking through new pages I came across Patti Hammond, a super fan of the Seahawks. She recently died and various news articles are listing her as a hall of famer that was inducted with other fans in 1999, but I'm unable to verify this as she's not mentioned anywhere on the Pro Football HoF's website. There is a Ford Hall of Fans but it started in 2018 and she's not listed there. Can anybody find anything mentioning her on the hall's website by any chance? Do we even consider super fans to be notable? If she is considered notable, do we assess her as \"top\" importance based on the project's assessment criteria that says to list Hall of Famers as such? Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nHi Josh, Superfans can definitely be notable. See - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sports_spectators. There's many examples such as Clipper Darrell and the Tour de France devil. There's lots of coverage on these people and they are often mentioned or given various awards. The NFL itself listed Patti as a Hall of Famer - https://www.nfl.com/honors/fan-of-the-year/2020/seahawks. It would seriously be the hoax of all hoaxes if somehow the NFL and various news websites could all be fooled. As we've discussed multiple times, direct reports, articles and so forth concerning events are not always easily found, though it certainly does not mean they didn't happen.KatoKungLee (talk)\n\n@KatoKungLee: I'm looking for the hall themselves to recognize and mention it somewhere. Induction as a group does not necessarily mean that an individual of said group is individually notable enough to deserve their own article (think band members being redirected to a band). As far as super fans being notable, this is the first NFL fan article that I've come across, which is why I wanted to ask the group for their take on it. I already know that your stance, as the article's creator, will be that the subject is notable. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nIt seems unlikely that the NFL would be making up or just assuming claims as they are a reputable source. If she was included as a group, other members would likely be listed and the NFL or various articles would have mentioned it as such. I can't find any information on her possibly being included as part of a group. If you find any, please let us know. There are various groups of football fans with articles here including Steeler Nation, Raider Nation, Bills Mafia and so forth. I don't think there would be specific rules to prevent NFL superfans from being including while allowing NBA superfans like Clipper Darrell to be included. That would be unusual, wouldn't it?KatoKungLee (talk)\n\n@ Hey man im josh - License Plate Guy, Barrel Man (Denver Broncos), Fireman Ed, Chief Zee, Crazy Ray are NFL superfans with an articles here. Hope that helps! Please see this category as well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Spectators_of_American_football KatoKungLee (talk)\n\nYou need to work on replying to people with 1 edit instead of 5+, as you so often do. It makes it very difficult to have conversations when your posts are constantly changing and I encounter 3 edit conflicts trying to reply to a subject. I've been trying to mention that exact category and haven't been able to do so because of the constant edit conflicts. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nFound a relevant category at Category:Spectators of American football, though I do still question the notability in this case. Looking forward to hearing other members of the project chime in. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\n@ Hey man im josh - What would make you question the notability exactly? How would you say Patti's case differs from Clipper Darrell, License Plate Guy, Barrel Man (Denver Broncos), Fireman Ed, Chief Zee abd Crazy Ray? Do you have any questions about the notability of those people? We want to avoid Wikipedia:Gaming the system and Wikipedia:Disruptive editing. KatoKungLee (talk)\n\nWe also want to avoid WP:BLUDGEON. I do question the notability of some of these superfans. If you want to accuse me of disruptive editing, please just do so and take it to the appropriate venue. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nSeem like there was some wing in the HOF where she and other fans were recognized.[17][18]—Bagumba (talk)\n\nThank you @Bagumba, that what I was looking for and it clears a lot up. I'm now curious whether the Ford Hall of Fans continues where the Visa Hall of Fans left off. Could be worth an article for somebody ambitious. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI've started a discussion that could use this project's input at the idea lab village pump. Ed [talk] [majestic titan]\n\nThere appeared to be a rough consensus at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject National Football League/Archive 21 § Araiza's college in lead to link a player's college football program in the lead (San Diego State Aztecs football) and not the actual school (San Diego State University). In that thread, Bluerules wrote: I don't have an issue with hyperlinking the football program in the lead and the school in the body...At the very least, there should be a hyperlink to the school, even if it's not in the lead.[19] Matt Araiza's page has been stable, per this agreement.\n\nHowever, Bluerules' recent change to Tom Brady's lead replaced Michigan Wolverines football with University of Michigan, contrary to that past consensus. Also pinging other participants from prior thread: Rockchalk717, Dissident93, Hatman31, GPL93, PeeJay. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI prefer the opposite of the consensus but if the school is still getting linked that's fine.--Rockchalk717\n\nLink to the football program. If they just attended the University we wouldn't mention it in the lead at all most of the time, we're mentioning it in the lead because they played for a football team not because they attended a school. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\n(uninvolved in previous discussion) I support the rough consensus to link to the football program since the players are most closely associated with the university for playing football, and not for another reason (e.g. academics). Frank Anchor\n\nI think either construction is fine or verbiage where both the school and team are each mentioned and linked. The only thing I object to is where the school is mentioned with a link to the team, e.g. \"Univeristy of Michigan\". That's poor style. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nLink to the football team and list their name. (San Diego State Aztecs vs. San Diego State). ~ Dissident93 (talk)\n\nThere was not a consensus reached in the previous discussion. And I made that comment before the Damar Hamlin article received national attention, which made the case for using the proper name of the school in the lead. One of the main arguments against hyperlinking the school was MOS:EGG because school names were commonly shortened in the lead. That's fixed by using the full name, which is the approach I've since taken.\n\nA consensus for hyperlinking the football program in the lead creates unnecessary debate and consistency issues because the school hyperlink is more appropriate for many articles. If the individual is notable outside of football, a school hyperlink is more appropriate. It paints a fuller summary of who they are. If the individual is a multi-sport athlete, a school hyperlink is more appropriate. Linking to various athletic programs would create MOS:OVERLINK and it's simpler to just link to the school.\n\nHyperlinking the school in the lead does not create any substantive issues. We do not have to start taking articles on a case-by-case basis to determine if we need to change the format. Every football player article could have the school hyperlinked in the lead without consistency issues, without limiting the subject's background, without omitting key information, and without creating MOS:OVERLINK. Again, the same cannot be said if the football program takes precedence in the lead.\n\nI am also opposed to using the nicknames of the schools in the lead. These are not formal names and they not commonly used outside of college football. When a player is drafted, the commissioner announces only the name of the school - not the nickname. Bluerules (talk)\n\nPlease link the relevant discussion regarding Hamlin that you mentioned. Thanks. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nIt was a note added to the article that's still there. The note made the point that using the school's full name in the lead is more informative for readers outside of the United States.\n\nIf we're using the full name, then the school needs to be hyperlinked because hyperlinking the football program creates MOS:EGG. Bluerules (talk)\n\nA hidden note is not widespead consensus. Nonetheless, others can continue to chime in.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nMy opinion hasn't really changed; at least for schools that have separate articles for their football teams, I think it's best to write something like \"he played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines\" or \"he played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers\" with a link to the program rather than the school, although I wouldn't object to naming and linking both the school and team as mentioned above. Actually, the latter is done in the example lead at Wikipedia:WikiProject National Football League/Player pages format#Lead; maybe it's best to follow that. Hatman31 (talk)\n\n@Hatman31 That example seems repetitive with \"Arizona State\" twice in the same sentence. I'd prefer to mention the most relevant one, preferably the football program or begrudgingly the college, and leave the other to be mentioned in the body. That's what it seemed like was agreed to at the previous Araiza discussion. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nFair enough, I definitely don't want to be repetitive, redundant, or superfluous! Hatman31 (talk)\n\nBrowns–Lions rivalry – Described as one of the best rivalries of the 1950s, the Browns and Lions played each other in the championship FOUR times over a period of SIX years. Sources for notability: SI; the Pro Football Hall of Fame website; SB Nation (2); The Herald-Sun; Petoskey News-Review; The Daily Oklahoman; Detroit Free Press; The Akron Beacon Journal; Dayton Daily News; Corpus Christi Caller-Times and several books mentioning it (Detroit Lions, On Being Brown, Cleveland Browns A to Z, Motor City Legends: Michigan's Sports Legacy, Browns Scrapbook). BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nHmmm... it seems it was deleted previously at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Browns-Lions rivalry – though, that AFD was from over a decade ago and consensus can change, so I'd still say its notable. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nThe prior AfD related to a stub article that lacked any sourcing to support the claim of a rivalry. And during the AfD, nobody came forward with such sourcing. If the article were developed with stronger sourcing (including some that you have collected above), I suspect it could pass WP:GNG. This reminds me a little bit of the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cowboys–Vikings rivalry. As discussed there, and per WP:NOTTEMPORARY, a historic rivalry does not lose notability even where the rivalry ends. Here, the peak of the rivalry was from 1952-1964 when the teams played seven times, including four times in the NFL Championship Game (1952, 1953, 1954, 1957). Cbl62 (talk)\n\nWith those sources, the article should pass without problems. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nPer consensus out of recent discussion at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject National Football League/Archive 21#\"U.S.\" in infobox, Bringingthewood and Yankees10 have added \"U.S.\" to what appears to be thousands of American football bio articles in recent weeks. However, Nikkimaria continues to buck the overwhelming trend (I estimate a ratio of least 20:1 across all of Wikipedia) by adding \"US\". Nikkimaria, what can we do to get you on board with \"U.S.\" in support of consistency across articles?\n\nAlso, Cbl62 and BeanieFan11, per your recent efforts on the missing college football coach campaign, we should be adding U.S. to place of birth and death in the infobox of these article to sync up with the efforts of the NFL editors.\n\nThanks, Jweiss11 (talk)\n\n@Jweiss11 The infobox tweaks are not going unnoticed. Big thumbs up! Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nThe more I'm seeing, I guess it's good that at least \"US\" is there. Even if editors don't want to add U.S./US to existing pages, maybe when a page is created going forward it could be added at that time.\n\nIt's like a salmon swimming upstream to begin with. If it's a personal thing to leave it off -- it really should be brought up now. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nI know Jweiss11 already brought this up above, to 'sync up'. If a page was created and nobody goes back to do it .... swimming ... swimming ... Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nI've always wondered what the criteria for \"Notable undrafted players\" is on the draft page articles (for example, 2022 NFL Draft#Notable undrafted players). Is it, everyone who's notable in a Wikipedia sense? Everyone who's played in the NFL? Everyone who had some sort of notable accomplishment? In the NFL? BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nWhat do you think it should be @BeanieFan11? To me, a good starting point would probably be the Pro Bowl and/or All-Pro. I understand Pro Bowl is a popularity contest, but if you make it, you're still likely notable. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI've always thought being a consistent starter (i.e. starting more than a few games as an injury replacement) as a good line. I know that is very vague, but maybe make a rule that someone must start at least ten games in a season? Pro Bowl designation is a good objective criteria, but it may be a bit too exclusive. Frank Anchor\n\nFor reference, NBA draft pages list anyone who played a game in the league. But it's more likely that such a player in NBA meets WP:GNG, maybe not so much for an offensive lineman, DB, or special teamer. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nFrom what I've seen, almost everybody in the draft era (1936-present) who's played (besides probably a few '87 replacements, and there might be a few other scattered ones) has enough coverage for notability. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nI don't know, Josh. I've thought of everyone who's played, like Bagumba said for the NBA, but that might make it too long. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nY'all may want to take a look at 1985 Dallas Cowboys season - some of the tables in the \"Game Summaries\" section are right-justified. Dunno if this is the project standard, so I left them alone. 76.14.122.5 (talk)\n\nProject standards aside, the page should at least be itself consistent, but it uses two styles of game summary boxes. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nIn the article about Gil Brandt, the date of birth is March 4, 1932. Is this correct, since in e.g. Wikidata his date of birth is given as March 4, 1933? I don't think so, since two years ago an IP changed the date just like that without a source citation. Can the date be changed again or is there a good source to confirm the change? Maschienenbau (talk)\n\nWow, I thought I responded to this on mobile the day of, but it must not have went through. Based on Gil's page at the Hall of Fame's website, he was born on March 4, 1933. However, based on Gil's own Twitter, he was born in 1932. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\n@Maschienenbau: I reached out to the HoF at the time I saw this and they just got back to me. They've corrected Brandt's birthday on his HOF page. I've also manually updated the information on the Wikidata entry and at the Italian Wikipedia for Brandt. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThere's a lot of work that needs to be done for the lists of players by NFL team. It seems all of them are somewhat incomplete or not updated enough, some don't even exist, and some are massively incomplete. Notes about each below (only discussing current teams):\n\nList of Buffalo Bills players - incomplete\n\nList of Miami Dolphins players - mostly good, but needs updating and may be a bit incomplete\n\nList of New England Patriots players - mostly good, but needs updating and may be a bit incomplete\n\nList of New York Jets players - oddly doesn't list any of the players from 1960-69, incomplete and needs updating\n\nList of Baltimore Ravens players - doesn't exist!\n\nList of Cincinnati Bengals players - doesn't exist!\n\nList of Cleveland Browns players - doesn't exist!\n\nList of Pittsburgh Steelers players - seems mostly good, might potentially need a bit of updating for recent players\n\nList of Houston Texans players - mostly good, but needs some updating for recent year(s)\n\nList of Indianapolis Colts players - doesn't exist!\n\nList of Jacksonville Jaguars players - mostly good, but could use some updating for recent years\n\nList of Tennessee Titans players - mostly good, but needs some updating for recent years\n\nList of Denver Broncos players - doesn't exist!\n\nList of Kansas City Chiefs players - massively incomplete\n\nList of Las Vegas Raiders players - doesn't exist!\n\nList of Los Angeles Chargers players - doesn't exist!\n\nList of Dallas Cowboys players - needs updating, somewhat incomplete\n\nList of New York Giants players - needs updating\n\nList of Philadelphia Eagles players - needs updating\n\nList of Washington Commanders players - needs updating\n\nList of Chicago Bears players - massively incomplete\n\nList of Detroit Lions players - needs updating\n\nList of Green Bay Packers players - might need some updating\n\nList of Minnesota Vikings players - needs updating\n\nList of Atlanta Falcons players - needs updating\n\nList of Carolina Panthers players - very incomplete, oddly only lists those with two or more full seasons played\n\nList of New Orleans Saints players - needs updating\n\nList of Tampa Bay Buccaneers players - needs a bit of updating\n\nList of Arizona Cardinals players - doesn't exist!\n\nList of Los Angeles Rams players - massively incomplete\n\nList of San Francisco 49ers players - needs updating\n\nList of Seattle Seahawks players - doesn't exist (is a redirect to main team page)!\n\nBeanieFan11 (talk)\n\n@BeanieFan11 Hi BF.\n\nI drop in from time to time regarding the Steelers. The tricky part is the top of their page notes that the list is a player who made at least one appearance in a game. Like the movie Rudy, the Steelers had many on the sidelines. I'll check last years players and see who played etc. Most of these team lists might not ever really be correct. Let's say an editor missed the 1998 season, a player played one game and was let go. He's gone and forgotten by now. You can't just add the current roster every year and leave, sorry to say. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nThe formatting is pretty inconsistent across these. There are 23 \"lists\" that exist (not counting the redirect). 12 of those lists have the same level of detail as a category while some go a step further and list a player's position and/or the years that they were on the team. Other pages only list players of notes. The lowest bar for inclusion on any of these lists seems to be that a player must have been on the active roster for a single game. In contrast, the categories for players of each team do not define when someone is considered a \"player\" of a team. From what I've seen, just about every practice squad player or person signed to a team for any length of time is added to the relevant player category.\n\nProbably a radical thought, but would it be crazy to suggest we define a criteria for inclusion in the player categories and focus our efforts there instead of maintaing these lists?— Preceding unsigned comment added by Hey man im josh (talk • contribs)\n\nI agree 100% with Hey man im josh, these lists are far from being consistent.\n\nCan we delete all these and not tell anyone?. (Only kidding ... someone will probably notice)\n\nNot sure why these lists started to begin with. If someone wanted to see if a player played for a team, you just go to that players page and look in the infobox. Looking at the Steelers again just now, I have no idea who some of these players are with the red links or just a last name present. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nThose lists seem highly unnecessary. I think a legitimate case could be made for a deletion of each of them. Because these lists can go one of two ways, either every player that has ever played a single game for these teams could be listed, even ones that wouldn't pass notability, or arbitrary names are listed based on the editors personal preference. For example, as a Chiefs fan, I could add the players I think are notable but another Chiefs fan might have a different view, especially one that is younger than me and may not remember some of the players that I do, especially if they are more of a casual fan than I am..--Rockchalk717\n\nPer WP:CSC, we could either list every WP notable player, or simply list all players:\n\nEvery entry meets the notability criteria for its own article in the English Wikipedia. Red-linked entries are acceptable if the entry is verifiably a member of the listed group and it is reasonable to expect an article could be forthcoming in the near future\n\n...\n\nShort, complete lists of every item that is verifiably a member of the group. These should only be created if a complete list is reasonably short (less than 32K) and could be useful (e.g., for navigation) or interesting to readers\n\n—Bagumba (talk)\n\nI have always hated these lists (and I am pretty sure I created the Packers lists way back in the day). I think these would be better served to consolidate specific player lists: Current Roster, Hall of Famers, Retired Numbers, First-Round Draft Picks, Starting QBs, etc. List of Green Bay Packers players sort of has this layout, but obviously needs to be expanded/improved. The lists of all players strays into \"database\" territory for me, and quite frankly are almost impossible to properly maintain. « Gonzo fan2007 (talk) @\n\nBelow is a list I made of every player currently on an NFL team roster missing an article; I suspect a decent amount would pass WP:GNG (note: these are players who are currently on a roster, not necessarily have played in a game). Listing it here in case anybody wants to work on the notable ones.\n\nBeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nAcrisure Stadium has been nominated for a good article reassessment.

If concerns are not addressed during the review period, the good article status may be removed from the article. Onegreatjoke (talk)\n\nI apologize if this has been discussed in the past but I don't recall seeing a discussion about this. Are these websites considered reliable sources? I only ask because while researching for something I do outside of Wikipedia I noticed with Chiefs punter Tommy Townsend, both claim he has signed his restricted free agent tenure (here and here), however, I cannot find any news articles backing this up and I don't see any websites that list NFL transactions showing this either.--Rockchalk717\n\nThis is a very good question and I hope someone can provide some insight. I've hesitated on using Spotrac as a reliable source for confirming signings because I've never found out how they \"confirm\" things and whether it's official when it's been added to the site. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nQuality assessments by Wikipedia editors rate articles in terms of completeness, organization, prose quality, sourcing, etc. Most wikiprojects follow the general guidelines at Wikipedia:Content assessment, but some have specialized assessment guidelines. A recent Village pump proposal was approved and has been implemented to add a |class= parameter to {{WikiProject banner shell}}, which can display a general quality assessment for an article, and to let project banner templates \"inherit\" this assessment.\n\nNo action is required if your wikiproject follows the standard assessment approach. Over time, quality assessments will be migrated up to {{WikiProject banner shell}}, and your project banner will automatically \"inherit\" any changes to the general assessments for the purpose of assigning categories.\n\nHowever, if your project has decided to \"opt out\" and follow a non-standard quality assessment approach, all you have to do is modify your wikiproject banner template to pass {{WPBannerMeta}} a new |QUALITY_CRITERIA=custom parameter. If this is done, changes to the general quality assessment will be ignored, and your project-level assessment will be displayed and used to create categories, as at present. Aymatth2 (talk)\n\nI am curious of everyone's thoughts on a possible merger. I honestly don't know, so very curious to hear what others think. We have the following 3 articles: Don Hutson Center, Clarke Hinkle Field and Ray Nitschke Field. These three articles cover was is technically one training area. The Don Hutson Center is the inside venue, while the two \"Fields\" border the inside facility. If you are familiar with the area, this whole venue is fenced off together. I'm wondering if this topic would be better served by merging these articles all under one title, either Don Hutson Center with separate sections on the different fields/facilities, or a descriptive name like Green Bay Packers training facilities. Thoughts? « Gonzo fan2007 (talk) @\n\nSounds sensible to me. And a merge is the way to go so as to preserve the contribution history of each of the articles.

BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nCurious as to why The Spring League accolades are not put into players' infoboxes? The Spring League has been recognized by established/credible networks such as ESPN, TSN, NBC Sports, CFL, Fox Sports, Sports Illustrated, and The Sporting News- just to name a few. If these valid and reliable sources are recognizing The Spring League as an official league, and the accolades associated- shouldn't Wikipedia also do the same? These platforms reach people worldwide and validify these accomplishments players have achieved. Would think that the players should have these TSL awards included on their pages/infoboxes on Wikipedia, as they have been highlighted on these dependable networks as confirmed, earned achievements. Again- any reason as to why these TSL accolades should not be included in players' infoboxes? Vitaminwaterzero0 (talk)\n\nI myself am against them being added to infoboxes. I felt as though the level of competition was lower than college and it would unnecessarily crowd the infoboxes. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\n@Hey man im joshIt is not lower than college- as a lot of these players have been in the NFL, CFL, etc. meaning they have already graduated from college play - making it a higher level of competition.\n\nIn addition, these games/league were televised and put on the internet to hit an audience nationally, and even worldwide and in doing so- the accolades associated with this league have been recognized/validified by these credible sources/networks. (Again, i.e. ESPN, TSN, NBC Sports etc.)\n\nI don't understand how someone would not be willing to credit these players for their achievements they have earned? Just to ensure the infobox isn't \"unnecessarily crowded?\" Should we not recognize these achievements and efforts these players have put forth? I just feel that these TSL accolades should be appreciated/accepted by Wikipedia as a whole- not just discredited by a certain person's opinion. Looking at the TSL as it's entirety as a professional league-with a high level of play, these accolades should be recognized by Wikipedia as they have already been accepted by extensive, reliable networks.\n\nI am happy to add articles from each source to validate my point. Vitaminwaterzero0 (talk)\n\nI understand that TSL was not technically lower than college, but the level of play and competition that we saw from the league arguably was. Just because something was televised doesn't mean that it should be included in the infobox. We have a whole list of items that are arguably more notable than TSL awards that we leave out of infoboxes (WP:NFLINFOBOXNOT). If you want to acknowledge the achievements you are more than welcome to include them in the body of the article (every award mentioned in the infobox should actually also be mentioned in the article). Simply put, the infobox is meant to represent the most notable achievements. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nYour entire explanation/argument is based on your own opinion. Not sure how your opinion can discredit awards and accomplishments that have been recognized by credited sources- Again- ESPN, NBC Sports, TSN. I would think these well-established sources should hold higher validity over your or even my opinion- just by the amount of people they reach and expertise? Not necessarily just because they are telivised.\n\nTo further validate my point-\n\nThere are many players who used TSL to get to the NFL. There are also players who came directly from the NFL to play in the TSL. In addition, CFL players decided to play in the TSL when COVID canceled the 2020 season.\n\nSome examples- McLeod Bethel Thompson- started for Toronto Argonauts who lead CFL in passing yards the year before his time in TSL, then opted to play in the TSL directly after that season- so clearly TSL is not less than college. Also, Zach Mettenberger played in the SEC, started multiple NFL games and then came straight to the TSL to further compete. Thirdly, Johnny Manziel, First Round NFL Pick/Heisman Trophy Winner, who also played in the SEC then NFL came to the TSL by choice. Why would these players choose to play in a league that was 'less than college?' Furthermore, neither of these players dominated the The Spring League, but actually got outplayed by other competitors- so does this not argue that the 'level of play and competition that we saw was arguably' better than college' (at the minimum)?\n\nI do not think TSL should crowd an infobox either, but an MVP award or Championship in any league with the caliber of these professional players should definitely be noted...just as CFL, XFL and USFL have done. If you really compare the 'level of play' in each league dependent on players, you will notice that they have all coincided in the same leagues- including the TSL. To your point- we can argue the 'level of play' across these leagues stays the same.\n\nAgain my entire position solely remains in the desire of giving these players credit where it is due. Hope you can understand that. Vitaminwaterzero0 (talk)\n\nMinor league info.-UCO2009bluejay (talk)\n\nYou can and should create achievements sections for the players in question, as what's in the infobox should also be mentioned and referenced in the article. It's just that I believe the accolades to be of lesser value since it's a minor league and accolades of lesser value should not be included in the infobox. Just because it's mentioned in the media does not automatically mean it should be included in the infobox. For instance, per WP:NFLINFOBOXNOT, we don't include divisional championships for players, Pro Bowl MVP, NFL Top 100 placements, or franchise records in the infobox. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be mentioned in the article, but there has been consensus among the project that those do not belong in the infobox. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nNote: has been blocked as a sockpuppet of . Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nI'm currently sorting and referencing unreferenced BLPs, and many of them are NFL players. Living people have a much higher standard for sourcing, and it's important that all of these articles are sourced. I've already sourced dozens of them to Football Reference (not enough to prove notability but enough to prove that they exist and they played). This is the list of living players with no citations at all, and this is the list of living players that have been tagged for insufficient citations. Thebiguglyalien (talk)\n\nThank you for the work you're putting in @Thebiguglyalien, it's very much appreciated! I'm sure that, with this list now handy, myself and others will be putting in work to help you get these articles up to standards. I hope others also chime in to mention that they're making an effort based on these lists. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nAt the bio for Dave Wilcox, it currently shows him with:\n\nLead: 5 All-NFL selections\n\nInfobox:\n\n2× First-team All-Pro (1971, 1972)\n\n2× Second-team All-Pro (1967, 1973)\n\n5× NEA First-team All-Pro (1967, 1970–1973)\n\nNEA Second-team All-Pro (1968)\n\nBody: ...All-NFL (1967, 1971, 1972, 1973) by the AP...; however, the citation to the Pro Football HOF says Five times he was named All-NFL (1967,1970, 1971, 1972, 1973)...[20]\n\nAt WP:NFLINFOBOX, it says When listing All-American and All-Pro selections, there is no need to list the selector. suggesting that we don't limit mention to just AP.\n\nHow should Wilcox's page be resolved?—Bagumba (talk)\n\nThough I personally would prefer to only recognize AP awards, it's worth noting that WP:NFLINFOBOX notes NEA is a valid selector for MVP but there's no mention of who is considered valid for All-Pro. If you consider NEA to be valid, then you would combine the All-Pro selections and, when selected by multiple valid selectors for the same year, note only the higher selection in the infobox for those years. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nPerhaps not a perfect analogy, but AP, UP, International News Service (INS, later merged with UP to form UPI), and Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) were all official selectors for college football All-Americans. All four were significant wire/syndication services at various points in the 20th century. Central Press Association (CP) was also active in picking All-Americans, though I don't think they were considered \"official\" for all years. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nI apologize if this comes over in a sloppy manner, my computer is screwed up. I've corrected pages like this to read: 5× First-team All-Pro ..... 3× Second-team All-Pro. Just combine them and not specify the selector. Or, we can change the WP:NFLINFOBOX to specify AP selector only. I do agree with Josh on that one, but we have to stop the nonsense now. If all these pages have to be looked at again and edited from here on out ... like adding U.S., we'll have them done by the year 2027.\n\nHonestly, it looks like the person who started listing these originally in the infobox didn't read that the selector shouldn't be listed for the All-Pro and All-American teams. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nThere shouldn't be double entries for the same year though; just list the highest honor. Per WP:NFLINFOBOX: If a player is selected to both the first and second team, whether by the same or different selectors, the player is listed as a first-team selection. List it as \"First-team All-XXXX (19XX)\" —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI agree on not having double entries for the same year. I'm glad you pointed towards that quote, as I hadn't looked under miscellaneous notes. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nHonestly, it looks like the person who started listing these originally in the infobox didn't read...: To be fair, the \"best practices\" were written relatively recently, and even edits since then have been inconsistent. I've seen some editors removing non-AP MVPs from the ibx.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nI myself was guilty of this as new editor. I think it stems from AP being the selector that the NFL backs, but I now understand that was not always the case. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nAnd I thought I sugar-coated that one, lol. By no means do I mean to offend the editors who list every selector. I do know that the NFL infobox can be updated at any moment. I remember running across someone when I was duplicating All-Pro. It does happen. Bottom line, I just hope that whatever is decided on will be the best way going forward. I'll edit accordingly. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nStrongly disagree with the suggestion that All-Pro designations in the infobox (or in the article text) should be limited to the AP. I am not particularly knowledgeable about current All-Pro selection processes, but limiting selections to the AP would be incorrect as a historical matter. The AP didn't even start choosing an All-Pro team on a regular basis until the 1940s. For much of the 1930s, there was an \"official\" All-Pro team selected directly by the NFL. In other years, e.g. 1940, the \"official\" All-Pro team was selected by 92 sports writers who were members of the Pro Football Writers Association of American (PFW), though AP, UP, and INS all made their own selections and were considered notable. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nI'm biased about this subject, and I recognize that, which is why I haven't brought it up here before. My thoughts are that each selector has not necessarily been as notable over time but it's not a feasible option to create for instance, a list of the top 3 selectors by year and go off that. AP is now the \"official\" selector, but that's not retroactive. The fact the Pro Football HOF recognizes the awards from other selectors should be enough to stick with what we've got. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI know this is somewhat outside of the scope of this project. However, I will ask here anyway. Do the original USFL teams deserve individual season articles?- UCO2009bluejay (talk)\n\nI'd say yes. It was a very-high level professional league that received enormous amounts of coverage. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nIt's not a matter of \"deserve\"; if they individually meet WP:GNG, then sure.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nI should have used \"merit\" and linked WP:GNG over merit instead. Poor word choice on my part. I have noticed a new enthusiatic editor Americanbagel1 creating some of these seasons for 1983. I noticed a few procedural/stylistic errors on their part.

I've removed a few. I just wanna be able to have something to point to and honestly get some help removing these. In the past, a case could have been made for inclusion because Pro Football Reference was marking career highs in these categories, they have since stopped. Between that and marking a career high for something that has a maximum, I don't see the purpose any more, especially for notorious ironmen who rarely (if ever) miss games for injury like Brett Favre, Tony Gonzalez, Eli Manning, Peyton Manning, and Tom Brady. There is a maximum number of games that can played and that's 18 (player gets traded before one team's bye and after the other team's bye) and a maximum record for quarterbacks of 17–0.\n\nSo point blank, should they be removed and if so is anyone willing to assist in the removal?--Rockchalk717\n\nWe have Mark Murphy (safety, born 1955) and Mark Murphy (safety, born 1958).

When he retires in 2025, he will have served in this role for 18 years, and it only the 10th person to serve in this role over the 100 year history of the Packers. The Mark Murphy born in 1958 played (confusingly) for the Packers for 11 seasons and his playing career is what made him notable.

I would actually support this change now, as his career as Green Bay's CEO is more noteworthy in my opinion. SPF121188 (talk this way) (my edits)\n\nGMs get some press with awards like Sporting News NFL Executive of the Year Award. Not sure if his work as CEO/President is as noteworthy outside of Green Bay. At any rate, a redirect would be suitable tagged as {{R from other disambiguation}}—Bagumba (talk)\n\nSee, I take the other opinion, and think that any such move would be based on WP:RECENTISM. Right now, if you run his name through Google, he's probably most known as the Packers president, but keep in mind that he was a Pro Bowl player, a 1st team All-Pro, and a Super Bowl champion as a player, not to mention being named as one of the 70 Greatest Redskins of all time. IMHO, 100 years from now, that's what he will be primarily remembered for, not for his tenure in an executive role with the Packers. Ejgreen77 (talk)\n\nEjgreen77 I'm not sure recentism is playing much into this. He played in the NFL for 8 seasons, but has been an American football executive for 31 years! Including holding a position that is equivalent to \"Owner\" of an NFL team. « Gonzo fan2007 (talk) @\n\nHey folks. Yesterday, I checked 2023 NFL draft a couple of hours after the draft and saw no redlinks. I remember a few years back when you could see 5th rounder redlinks 24 hours after the draft. How did this happen? How many years has the draft roster been completely linked so near to the end of the draft.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nNote that some of the articles seem to be failing WP:GNG in their current form. I think it would be wise to go over the list and add SIGCOV where needed. Alvaldi (talk)\n\nFrom what I've seen some of the later picks were quickly created without much effort or much care to make sure the article is sufficient by inexperienced editors. The majority of the draft picks should pass WP:GNG, the articles themselves need to reflect that.--Rockchalk717\n\nI estimate there's probably about 30-40 of the late-round picks who were quickly created as stubs; I admit I created a decent chunk of those, but I'm currently in the process of going back and expanding them. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nYou I trust going back and making sure they're sufficient, some of the others that created the late round picks, not so much.--Rockchalk717\n\nNow that the draft has ended, we'll have the time to improve them all before the start of the season. ~ Dissident93 (talk)\n\nFully agree with the sentiment from Tony, good work y'all and good luck with the cleanup. I'll probs add to NO picks as the season progresses since that's the team I follow :P — Ixtal ( T / C ) ⁂ Non nobis solum.\n\nI'm glad that the three editors above (RC, BF, and D93) responded to the statement that articles are failing. Sorry that my computer is bad at responding lately. I believe the articles will be top notch at drafts end. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nUser:BeanieFan11, thanks for your work. It looks like you were deep into the scouting reports 2 days before the draft ticking of likely draftees. Great work.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nI compiled a list of those draft picks who were quickly created when drafted and remain stubs/short articles. Shown below in case anyone wants to work on them (excluding about four by me that I still have to expand):\n\nJake Andrews (American football)\n\nJordan Howden\n\nColby Sorsdal\n\nB. J. Thompson (American football)\n\nEric Scott Jr. (while start-class, most of the content is unreferenced)\n\nJosh Hayes (American football) (SIGCOV added)\n\nZaire Barnes\n\nMalaesala Aumavae–Laulu\n\nScott Matlock\n\nAmari Burney\n\nTre Hawkins III\n\nAmeer Speed\n\nBrad Robbins (American football)\n\nJovaughn Gwyn (SIGCOV added)\n\nIsaiah Bolden\n\nAlex Austin\n\nKendall Williamson\n\nDesjuan Johnson (Mr. Irrelevant)\n\nBeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nWould anyone be willing to expand these? Several have been notability tagged and may be nominated for deletion or moved to draftspace if not improved. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nAdded several significant sources to Jovaughn Gwyn, might take a look at others later. Alvaldi (talk)\n\nAdded SIGCOV to Josh Hayes (American football). Still has empty sections though. Alvaldi (talk)\n\nWhat happened to the Houston Oilers colors? See any of the Houston Oilers season pages before 1980 for reference.- UCO2009bluejay (talk)\n\nFixed. The colors were encoded incorrectly. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nUser:Dicklyon has begun a campaign of downcasing references to \"NFL Draft\", e.g. [21].This is inappropriate given that the articles about the subject are capitalized: National Football League Draft, 1936 NFL Draft, 2023 NFL Draft, etc. I've suggested to Dicklyon that in order to downcase references to \"NFL Draft\" across Wikipedia, we first need a successful move discussion to downcase the subject articles themselves. Thoughts? Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nHere Wikipedia seems to be leading, rather than following, source usage. Let's get this fixed. Dicklyon (talk)\n\nThe \"fix\" should gain consensus in a page name change first. I had reverted a similar edit of yours to link to a redirect of a lowercase \"draft\". I just assumed it was a one-off script error, as you've typically done RMs for page moves first. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI'll launch an RM discussion on this soon then. Dicklyon (talk)\n\nDid that at Talk:2024 NFL Draft. Dicklyon (talk)\n\nDicklyon, c'mon, you knew this would be controversial and yet started to lowercase and move them anyway (hopefully they've all been returned to the standard uppercase). Not cool, and overlays with the concern people have mentioned about your use of the tools. If you want to get to five millions edits by years end you need those, so please use them properly and in good faith, taking into consideration all other Wikipedia editors, thanks. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nWhat moves are you referring to? The ones I did 10 years ago? Or just talking about the few dozen recent edits I did? Dicklyon (talk)\n\nThe recent ones mentioned above, I had no idea if it was one or dozens or thousands. The linked one above still hasn't been changed back to uppercase, maybe you can use your tools to revert your edits, thanks. I think that you had to know that this change would be controversial and that it should be brought to an RM before embarking on lowercasing. Maybe I'm wrong, and you went ahead without that thought crossing your mind. That's certainly possible, but in any case it has come to an RM, in a circular route. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nDoes it say somewhere that I can't do a few edits that might be controversial? Most of these were in contexts where the over-capitalization just looked wrong; I wanted to see if there were objections, and there was Jweiss11, who said do RM first. No moves were involved. Dicklyon (talk)\n\nIn that particular case, I don't find any sources with capitalized Draft in referring to the 1949 NFL draft until 21st century; it was always lowercase before, as were the other old ones, which are the ones I was working on. They're still mostly lowercase, but not by such a huge margin. It's still not a trademark (except for clothing items like tee-shirts and caps) as discussed at the RM. So whether the title is correctly capitalized or not, fixing other uses still makes sense, doesn't it? Dicklyon (talk)\n\nThe articles all start with \"The NNNN National Football League Draft was held ...\", as if that's the proper name of a named event. But if you search books, you find lots of \"National Football League draft was held ...\", which is about doing the process, no proper name needed. The only book with capital D there is the one copied from Wikipedia. We're leading the world to over-capitalize when we should be following the decision obvious in reliable sources that this is not a proper name. But Randy, I do appreciate that at least you're consistent in wanting to capitalize things important to you, across a broad spectrum of things. This is not Wikipedia style, though, as I'm sure you're unhappy to know. Dicklyon (talk)\n\nI'm a supporter of efforts to eliminate overcapitalization, but NFL Properties LLC does own a trademark on the term \"NFL DRAFT\". The registration was filed in 2019 and can be found here. There is a second trademark registration with a stylized version of the words including a shield that extends to education and entertainment services. See here. Why doesn't that support capitalization of \"NFL Draft\"? Cbl62 (talk) .\n\nIt's being discussed at Talk:2024 NFL Draft. Feel free to join there. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nThat supports a full capitalization of DRAFT but it doesn't support capitalizing just the first letter of Draft. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\n...where the answer to Why doesn't that support capitalization of \"NFL Draft\"? is given; those are not relevant trademarks. Dicklyon (talk)\n\nThe RM discussion closed with \"no consensus\". It's sad that source evidence and guidelines don't carry much weight in such discussions. Dicklyon (talk)\n\nI came here to get opinions about a draft I started for a 2012 NFL playoff game - Draft:The 3:16 game. @BeanieFan11: recommended I come here. The title was previously deleted by AfD in 2015, but there have a been a few legacy items (2016, 2017) which may meet help it meet WP:LASTING. I also have no idea what the previous article looked like so {{G4}} probably does not apply, but I messaged the admin who closed the discussion - unfortunately they have not been active for the last five days. Lightburst (talk)\n\nLASTING refers to events that cause change, or have continued analysis. The later sources I see cited in the draft are just trivial mentions of stat lines from the game, which are already at Tim Tebow (if not also other team or playoff pages). The sources also refer to it in conjunction with other 3:16 instances in college for Tebow (also in his bio). Generally, the more recent references are not really about the game, but more Tebow and 3:16. If anything, perhaps there's enough material for an article (or at least a subsection) on 3:16 in pop culture. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nThanks for the message - that is the second time this week I cited the incorrect guideline. WP:SUSTAINED is what I meant, but I understand your points@Bagumba:. Since you were the AfD nominator and I cannot reach the closer of the AfD, can you tell me if the article is much different than the deleted article from 2015? Lightburst (talk)\n\nThe previous version had more content about the game. Still, the main concern is that the topic still has the same issues outstanding from the AfD. The new sources are not significant coverage on the game itself; hence, my suggestion to perhaps expand the scope beyond the game and Tebow, which then might meet WP:GNG.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nDissident93 at 2023 Washington Commanders season doesn't think so, but from what I've seen pretty much all other seasons have them listed (at least for modern times) - bringing it here to see if there's consensus for listing them. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nIs the intention to list all FA signings, or just undrafted FAs?—Bagumba (talk)\n\nEither is fine to me. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\n@Dissident93: you seemed eager to make an argument in the edit summaries and I would love to get your side of this. From what I'm seeing now if there's sufficient sourcing I don't see why this would be a problem, I am however sympathetic to you if in fact its true that it is \"omitting vet free agents.\" Would you be amenable to listing undrafted free agent signings if vet free agents were also listed? Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nWe'd still need some sort of cutoff/notability filter as including every single transaction would be WP:INDISCRIMINATE. And at what point do we stop adding them? After the draft? After OTAs? After the cuts to 53? After their final game? Do we also include trades and suspensions? I've always believed that the best way to avoid having to deal with this mess was to just avoid adding them in the first place. Any notable player transaction could simply belong in prose instead (which 95% of UDFAs aren't). ~ Dissident93 (talk)\n\nThat filter is coverage, if the transaction doesn't receive coverage in independent reliable sources then it most likely shouldn't be included. Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nMost of the time the transactions are covered in independent sources, although there have been a few cases where I've seen the release of a bottom-of-the-roster guy not get reported except by the team. I don't really think though that we should list the signings that have independent coverage and exclude the signings that don't, since they're all signings and it wouldn't really make sense to only include some of them. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nWe don't generally cover company hirings and firings unless they're reported independently, why would NFL teams be any different? Horse Eye's Back (talk)\n\nPlaying devil's advocate: the football players are generally GNG notable, unlike the average company employee. Most companies won't have yearly articles. So while it's insignificant for the top-level article, it's arguable relevant to a low-level season page. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI was thinking more average company senior executive but your point stil"
