William New Kim, the first Chinese immigrant, arrived in Marietta in 1879, and after that a very small community formed. This presentation it will look into the life and death of William New Kim, the first Chinese immigrant in Marietta who met an untimely death by his own hand. Furthermore, it gives insight into what the lives of these immigrants may have been like, and how White Mariettans sought to answer the so-called “Chinese Question.”Aaron Burr and the Southern Conspiracy: An Early Populist CampaignMaria CiproAaron Burr, with the help of his co-conspirators James Wilkinson and Harman Blennerhassett, sought to harness secession plots and push them to his goal of creating a new nation within the Mississippi River Valley. The tactics he used were inherently Populist. Populism requires a politician to analyze a situation or controversy and establish those with wealth, status, or whatever the inferior group lacked. Then they must recognize the power imbalance between the two and make the people feel valued and superior to the other party. Finally, a populist must control the popular opinion and remain in its favor. Burr sought to create a nation built with him as the emperor that served the people and used citizen’s fear against them. It allowed him to garner support for his insurrection. Aaron Burr tried but failed to secede the Mississippi River Valley from the United States to restore his political reputation through a populist campaign of intrigue.\n\nPolitical Science\n\n2:00–\n\n3:00 p.m.\n\nThomas 327\n\nDr. Michael Morgan\n\nThe Impacts of Corruption on Economic ProsperityMichaela DonnellyLess-developed countries (LDCs) have intrigued researchers for years. They want to understand why these countries are how are. There are countless reasons why a country may be poor and unable to climb up the economic ranks. However, this project discusses one of the main factors that impacts LDCs and developed nations alike, corruption. With all of these ideas in mind, this study asks the question “How does corruption impact economic prosperity?” Although scholars have come to differing conclusions on the answer to this question, there is overwhelming support that leads to one clear result.The Relationship Between Regime Characteristics and Foreign Direct InvestmentSarah WallenfelszA crucial factor in the strength of a country’s economy is foreign direct investment which impacts the political, social, and economic actions of a country. Democracies may be more likely to receive foreign direct investment due to numerous qualities. The research focuses on the relationship between regime characteristics and foreign direct investment to determine if democracies receive higher levels of investment by multinational corporations than non-democratic regimes.\n\nPhysics\n\n2:30–\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nSelby 148\n\nDr. Dennis Kuhl\n\nThe Fractional Resistivity Change Of Au(111) Thin Films Dosed With Diethyl DisulfideAaron RohrThe resistance change of 150 nm Au(111) films due to diethyl disulfide dosing was measured using a four-probe, lock-in technique. At a base pressure of 2.5 x 10-10 Torr, samples were Ar+ ion sputter cleaned and annealed to ~500℃. The adsorbate-induced change in resistance determined the fractional change in resistivity. Auger spectroscopy determined surface composition and the effect of cleanliness of the sample on the fractional change in resistivity was studied.Simulations of Interference Effects of Dual Laser Pulse Plasma InteractionsLucas YoungJoseph SmithWe used the open-source simulation code WarpX to simulate dual lasers colliding with a thin plasma target. This simulation is useful for studying intense magnetic fields like those expected for magnetic reconnection in stars. For these simulations, the main independent variable that we change is the separation of the dual pulses. The lower the separation the higher the particle energy generated.PIC Simulations to Investigate the Influence of Initial Target Conditions on Short-Pulse Laser Neutron ProductionNicholas HaughtJoseph SmithNeutrons generated through tabletop laser-driven interactions offer benefits and complement traditional methods, allowing for progress in applications including neutron imaging and next-generation medical treatments. This study utilizes Particle-In-Cell simulations to explore how initial conditions influence neutron generation from interactions between high-intensity, short-pulse lasers and heavy water targets. Several initial conditions were investigated, including the target thickness, target temperature, and chamber background pressure. Findings indicate that these initial conditions play a significant role in neutron yield.Investigating Rowing Blade Geometry and EfficiencyEvan SaribalasThe geometry of a rowing blade affects its efficiency during the rowing stroke. The goal of this project is to understand what geometry makes a rowing blade efficient and why blade design has evolved within the sport. Using a hydraulic flume with a static blade we can measure the force between the blade and the water. How this force depends on the oar’s shape, curvature, and angle of attack is investigated.\n\nBiology\n\nSession A\n\n8:00–\n\n10:00 a.m.\n\nBartlett 162 and 166\n\nDr. Jeremy May\n\nEffects of Blueberry Juice on Lipid Oxidation Using Drosophila melanogasterAuva ZandiOxidative damage to phospholipid membranes can decrease lifespan and antioxidants can help prevent this damage. In this experiment, lipid peroxidation in Drosophila melanogaster was measured in both larvae and adults treated with antioxidants and was compared to control flies that were not given antioxidants. Blueberry juice was the antioxidant incorporated into the fly’s food. While the results were statistically significant, the hypothesis that blueberry juice decreases lipid peroxidation in Drosophila melanogaster was not supported.Investigation of Lecanemab’s Effectiveness and Safety in Reducing the Rate of Cognitive Decline, Reducing Amyloid-β Aggregation, and Increasing Amyloid-β Clearance in People with Early Alzheimer’s DiseaseBraedon AyersAlzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the abnormal buildup of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins. Lecanemab is an anti-Aβ protofibril monoclonal antibody. The research hypothesis was that lecanemab treatment would decrease Aβ aggregation and cognitive decline, increase Aβ clearance, and be safe with extended use. Evidence from articles compiled from various databases supported that lecanemab effectively reduced Aβ aggregation, but questions remain regarding its efficacy in reducing cognitive decline and its long-term safety.A comparative analysis of berberine, luteolin, and resveratrol and their potential efficacy as telomerase-targeted cancer treatmentsLogan AyersTelomeres are protective non-coding DNA sequences that shorten after cell division until eventually triggering apoptosis or, in cells such as cancer cells, are elongated by the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase inhibition through natural compounds is thus a possible cancer therapy. Three naturally-occurring compounds (berberine, luteolin, and resveratrol) were compared and berberine was hypothesized to inhibit telomerase the most in cancer cells. After analysis, the hypothesis was supported, but characteristics of each compound may limit therapeutic potential.Determining if Exercise or Manual Treatment is Best for Knee OsteoarthritisJoshua StoiaOsteoarthritis is predicted to be the eighth leading cause of disability in men and fourth in women causing patients to experience a decrease in joint range of motion and increase in pain level. This literature-based study will also include data from a local outpatient clinic that will investigate whether exercise therapy is more beneficial than traditional manual therapy techniques such as joint mobilizations. The literature shows that exercise therapy is more beneficial in treating osteoarthritis.Flying Squirrels (Glaucomys volans) at the Barbara A. Beiser Field StationBethany HolsteinThe purpose of my capstone was to determine if there are flying squirrels at the Barbara-Feiser field station. I set up 12 nest boxes throughout 3 different elevations at the field station from November to March to determine if there is an elevation they are more likely to be at. Preliminary results indicate no information from the nest boxes, but specific bites in eaten hickory nuts indicate flying squirrel presence.Effects of Three Antibiotics on the Growth and Development of Xenopus laevisStephanie CamdenAs antibiotics become more prevalent, they may begin to negatively affect surface water organisms. Erythromycin, oxytetracycline, and ampicillin were tested on the African Clawed Frog, Xenopus laevis, embryos for 36 hours to determine their lethality and growth inhibition properties. The mortality rate was collected every 12 hours. Length and width measurements were taken on the remaining embryos at the conclusion. High concentration oxytetracycline was the most lethal and low concentration ampicillin seemed to be beneficial.\n\nBiology\n\nSession B\n\n8:00–\n\n10:00 a.m.\n\nBartlett 162 and 166\n\nDr. Dave McShaffrey\n\nPreserving Opuntia: Evaluating the Efficacy of Grafting Techniques in Mitigating Natural Threats to Opuntia microdasys PopulationsFaith MalonePrickly pear cactuses (Opuntia), are prominent in many areas of the world and utilized for medicines and food. Every year, prickly pears are vulnerable to natural disasters and diseases killing mass populations of the plant. This project explores solutions to the problem through simple grafting techniques and analyzing the effects of natural damages to a prickly pear subset Opuntia microdasys. Results show grafting is not a viable solution in preservation of Opuntia.Biological aspects of Aspergillus fungi and its impact on human healthMackenzie GrigsbyAspergillus fungi is just one of many organisms we commonly encounter, and they produce mold that instigates respiratory system irritations and lung infections. The challenge with these fungi is correctly identifying infections and where exposure occurs. A variety of identification methods exist, including DNA analysis, microscopy, culturing, and more. In findings of this fungi both in indoor spaces, like bedrooms, and outdoor environments, like parks, analyzing the genetic material consistently produces the most accurate identifications.Comparison of Holistic and Allopathic Treatments for Irritable Bowel SyndromeJenna WaltersIrritable Bowel Syndrome is a brain gut disorder. Alternative therapies have been recently investigated with IBS. This literature-based study compared aloe and peppermint oil with traditional antihistamine treatments. Results show that IBS-D is most effectively treated with aloe. Antihistamines were shown to treat a wide range of IBS symptoms. While peppermint oil is most effective at treating IBS-C and IBS-SSS global symptoms.The Impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) on Health in AdulthoodRachel KazmirskiHuman health outcomes in Appalachia are lower than the national average. This study examined the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) among Appalachian adults and their relationship to health and health-risk behaviors. Using an online questionnaire about ACEs, positive experiences, adult resiliency, perceived stress, food insecurity, and health behaviors, participants were grouped into four ACE groups and statistical analyses were conducted to determine if there is a correlation between ACE scores and negative health behaviors.Investigation of Confocal Microscopy in the Detection of Skin CancerMorgan BryantEven with current technologies, diagnosis of skin cancer is a challenge. Confocal microscopy is a noninvasive imaging tool that has been suggested to reduce unnecessary biopsies when diagnosing melanomas and other common skin cancers. A thorough review of literature was performed to compare the accuracy and clinical implications of confocal microscopy to noninvasive dermoscopy and optical coherence tomography. Literature suggests best use of this technology as a complementary tool to current methods.Acute infection of SARS-CoV-2 as a trigger for New-Onset DiabetesAshton CarrollThis literature research project examined the mechanisms by which long-covid leads to new-onset type 2 diabetes. Potential mechanisms include direct infection, inflammation, and/or viral persistence in the pancreas. Of these it was expected that chronic inflammation in the pancreas, resulting from a prolonged immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for long-covid triggered diabetes. It was concluded that direct infection and damage of the pancreas via ACE-2 is the most likely cause.\n\nBiology\n\nSession C\n\n3:00–\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nBartlett 162 and 166\n\nDr. Jeremy May\n\nInvestigation of Antibiotic Resistance and Strategies to Combat the Spread of ResistanceHaley BetzingAntibiotic resistance (AR) is a worldwide health problem caused by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. This literature review investigated the hypothesis that decreasing antibiotic use in agriculture is the best method to combat the spread of AR. To determine if this is correct, resistant bacteria in agriculture were compared to resistant bacteria in wastewater treatment plants, and the effectiveness of surveillance on AR spread. Current results have shown that reducing agricultural antibiotic use lowers AR.Is copeptin more effective than current biomarkers in diagnostic and prognostic value associated with cardiovascular health?Alexis SchreckengostCardiovascular disease was the cause of 1 in 5 deaths in 2021 and is expected to increase. Blood biomarkers like copeptin and troponins are used to diagnose and determine prognosis for cardiovascular disease in hopes of improving mortality rates and patient outcomes. Copeptin was compared to current gold standards, and results indicate that copeptin is at least as, if not more, effective than current biomarkers, but some limitations of blood sampling do apply.Learning deficits in Drosophila melanogaster after Bisphenol A exposureMadison CecilBisphenol A (BPA) is a plastic additive that has been shown in studies to cause learning deficits in multiple species. This study utilized Drosophila melanogaster to explore these deficits following developmental exposure to BPA in food. Adult flies were tested for operant conditioning by pairing light, normally attractive, with an aversive stimulus. Courtship behavior in adult males was observed over time to detect learning. Initial data suggests BPA exposure decreases learning ability in both assays.Investigation of diabetes mellitus and its association to chronic renal failureGabrielle TurnerApproximately one in three individuals with diabetes mellitus develops kidney failure. It was hypothesized that renal failure resulted from the poor management of diabetes mellitus and that hyperglycemia was more detrimental toward renal function than hypertension. Current literature demonstrated that the poor management of diabetes mellitus was not the only factor contributing to kidney failure. Genetic factors, especially in certain ethnicities, played a greater role than previously understood.Breastmilk containing nicotine, marijuana, and NSAIDS is still superior to formula for child neurodevelopmentHannah SchillSeventy-five percent of postpartum women breastfeed at some point. In 2019, 20.3 million people in the US used tobacco and marijuana products; another 30 million used NSAIDS. It was hypothesized if levels of nicotine, marijuana, and NSAIDS exceed accepted limits, formula should replace breastmilk to minimize developmental impact. Current research instead suggests that child neurodevelopment is not adversely affected by maternal use of these substances while breastfeeding.Effects of bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) on the development and lifespan of DrosophilaClaire RoccoBisphenol A (BPA) can cause an early onset of puberty in humans, so Bisphenol S (BPS) has been introduced as an alternative. This experiment examines the effects of BPA and BPS, ingested from food, on the rate of pupal development and eclosion (adult emergence) of Drosophila melanogaster and the lifespan of Drosophila hydei. Current results indicate that exposure to BPS increases the rate of development; lifespan results are pending.\n\nBiology\n\nSession D\n\n3:00–\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nBartlett 162 and 166\n\nDr. Dave McShaffrey\n\nAgriculture in SpaceMacKenzie KidwellSpace travel and exploration has challenges including food supply, maintaining a bioregenerative ecosystem to renew resources. This project investigates the possibility of growing edible plants in space conditions with the assistance of environmental and medium manipulation. A literature review of various extraterrestrial growth strategies shows that lettuce grew worst in actual Lunar regolith samples, poorly in simulants, and best in a simulant and manure 70:30 mixture. This supports the possibility of agriculture in space.Intensity of ultraviolet and near-infrared light in Arctic flowering plants throughout the growing season and their potential impacts on pollinator activity.Kyla MorrisThe purpose of this study is to investigate how intensity of ultraviolet light, near-infrared light, and pollinator activity changes as seasonal warming occurs in Arctic flowering plants using UniSpec spectrometry to scan petals. Tentative conclusions indicate that near-infrared intensity decreases while ultraviolet intensity and pollinator activity both increase as seasonal temperatures increase.The Role of Activated Carbon in Suppressing Allelopathy Effects from Ocimum basilicumElizabeth BurdissA common concern for land managers is controlling invasive species. Their allelopathic compounds give them a competitive advantage. This experiment examined the minimum concentration of activated carbon needed to counteract the allelopathic chemicals released by Ocimum basilicum so other plant species can effectively compete with it. Different concentrations of activated carbon were combined with the soil to determine the minimum concentration needed to limit O. basilicum’s competitive advantage at the lowest cost to land managers.PFAS in a 100 mile radius of Washington county Ohio and PFAS in States around Ohio.Kobe NicholsonThe project is looking at PFAS chemicals in a 100-mile radius of Washington County Ohio.

Caspase-3 assay results of normal HaCat human epithelial cells and M624 human melanoma cells after novel paraben treatment will provide support for conclusions. Caspase-3 assays will provide data that shows evidence of the desired form of apoptotic cell death activity and will be used as an indicator to determine cell death concentration at LC50 heptylparaben and methylparaben levels in melanoma and normal skin cells.Synthesis of MononitroparabenDuncan Fraser\n\nParabens are simple ester derivatives of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. These compounds are anti-microbial preservatives found in cosmetics, toiletries, and pharmaceuticals. However, studies have shown that these compounds may be toxic to mammalian cells by acting as hormone agonists or antagonists or cellular enzyme inhibitors. Our undergraduate research group focuses on trying to synthesize novel paraben derivatives in this case by nitrating the p-hydroxybenzoic acid backbone. Previous work in nitration has been somewhat successful, but this project seeks to present a concrete method for synthesis.\n\nMusic\n\n7:00–\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nBand Hall\n\nDr. Nils Lansdberg\n\nSeeking a Compositional Process: Retrospective and PerformanceHaven BloughMusical composition, like many art forms, is often assumed to be a skill inaccessible to the average person.

Their intended use, reportedly, is to provide another alternative method for traditional cigarette smoking, to encourage cessation. It has since then gained tremendous popularity, more specifically, with the adolescent, young adult population.1 There is research even providing evidence that advertisements are deliberately targeting this age group. What sets vaping apart from regular tobacco inhalation is, the device uses a battery to heat a metal coil which vaporizes a liquid mixture, typically containing propylene glycol, glycerol, with or without nicotine, whereas regular tobacco products contain additional toxic chemicals like arsenic, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, tar, lead, acetone, and many others. Extensive research has been performed throughout the years, allowing us to know the harmful effects of traditional tobacco use. That of which includes, but is not limited to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, coronary artery disease, stroke, and cancer. There are an estimated 8 million global deaths annually as a result. However, vaping is also not a benign process, for example medical professionals discovered a rise in vaping induced lung injury around 2019. With the smoking trend shifting from combustible tobacco use, to using devices that produce aerosolized nicotine vapors, especially it more likely to be those who are smoking naïve than for its intended purpose of smoking cessation, it is important to educate consumers on the acute adverse effects and what they could mean in the future as this habit continues. This paper, as well as the accompanying poster presentation will be discussing research conducted thus far on e-cigarettes/vaping’s adverse effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.\n\nSTEM\n\nGeology\n\n2:00–\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nSelby 150\n\nDr. Andrew Beck\n\nTakeaways from the Geologic Society of America (GSA) Connects 2023 Meeting.Adrienne HammontreePresentation about Adrienne’s experience at the Geological Society of America (GSA) Connects 2023 Meeting in Pittsburgh, PA.Facies Analysis of the Point Pleasant FormationTanner HurstThe objective of this study is to document facies succession and cyclicity present in the Ordovician Point Pleasant Formation by analyzing a core drilled in Washington County Ohio.
