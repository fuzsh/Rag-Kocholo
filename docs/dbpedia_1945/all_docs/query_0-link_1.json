        "text": "By Clark Judge\n\nKen Anderson (L) and Ken Riley (R)\n\nScore two for the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nFormer Bengals’ cornerback Ken Riley and quarterback Ken Anderson are two of the 12 senior finalists revealed Wednesday for the Pro Football Hall-of-Fame’s Class of 2023, and, yes, that’s a big deal. The reason: Only one player, former tackle Anthony Munoz, represents the Bengals in Canton.\n\nOne.\n\nNow that number may be doubled. That’s because unlike previous years, the Hall will propose three candidates for induction in each of the next three years. The past two years it was one per annum.\n\nOf the two Bengals, Riley seems the more attractive candidate for two reasons: 1) He was a senior runner-up two years ago when Drew Pearson was elected, and 2) he ranks fifth in all-time interceptions, tying him with Charles Woodson. Woodson was a first-ballot enshrinee in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, of the top seven NFL leaders in career interceptions, only one has not been inducted. Ken Riley, come on down.\n\nOf course, Riley will have competition … and not just from Anderson. Take a look at the 12 senior finalists, and tell me who doesn’t belong:\n\nQB Ken Anderson, (1971-86).\n\nLB Maxie Baughan, (1960-70, 1974).\n\nLB Randy Gradishar, (1974-83).\n\nLB Chuck Howley, (1958-59, 1961-73).\n\nTB/DB/HB, P Cecil Isbell, (1938-42).\n\nDT Joe Klecko, (1977-88).\n\nOL Bob Kuechenberg, (1970-83).\n\nS Eddie Meador (1959-70).\n\nLB Tommy Nobis (1966-76).\n\nCB Ken Riley, (1969-83)\n\nWR Sterling Sharpe, (1988-94).\n\nCB Everson Walls, (1981-93).\n\nNow, a handful of observations:\n\nDEFENSE MATTERS\n\nEight candidates, or three-quarters of the field, come from that side of the ball, with linebacker (four) the most popular position. The competition there will be stiff, with Maxie Baughan, Chuck Howley, Randy Gradishar and Tommy Nobis the choices.\n\nHISTORY DOESN’T\n\nCecil Isbell\n\nOnly one finalist, former Packers’ star Cecil Isbell, played all or most of his career before 1960. Isbell was one of two pre-‘60s’ finalists among the 25 semifinalists named earlier this month. Former Packers’ end Lavvie Dilweg, a first-team All-Pro his first five seasons, was the other. He didn’t make the next cut.\n\nSURPRISE AT WIDE RECIEVER\n\nSterling Sharpe is one of the 12, and while that might not seem like an upset, this marks his first appearance as a Hall finalist. Sharpe has the resume for Canton (five Pro Bowls, three first-team All-Pro designations and 18 TDs in one season), but a short career (seven years) and no championships may have contributed to voters’ previous disinterest. Not anymore. He was the only one of six receiver candidates chosen, outlasting Dilweg, Stanley Morgan, Otis Taylor, Mark Clayton and Billy “White Shoes” Johnson (also a return specialist).\n\nWHERE ARE THE OFEENSIVE LINEMEN?\n\nThere’s one: Miami’s Bob Kuechenberg. So what happened to Joe Jacoby, Mike Kenn, George Kuhn and Chris Hinton? Nothing, that’s what. All didn’t make the cut, yet all are Hall-of-Fame worthy. In fact, Jacoby was a three-time modern-era finalist (2016-18) and a Top 10 finisher in 2016. But he couldn’t crack this group. Kuechenberg did, and hallelujah. The guy was an eight-time modern-era finalist and should’ve been elected to Canton years ago.\n\nNO LOVE FOR CENTENNIAL CLASS FINALISTS\n\nThere were 20 named to the Centennial Class of 2020, with 10 inducted. That meant 10 were not. Of that group, five – or half—aren’t among the Class of 2023 finalists. They are Dilweg, running back Roger Craig, offensive lineman/linebacker Ox Emerson, halfback Verne Lewellen and offensive and defensive lineman Al Wistert. Lewellen, Wistert and Emerson didn’t even make the first cut.\n\nWHAT’S NEXT\n\nThe seniors committee will meet virtually on Aug. 16 to consider all 12 candidates, with three chosen for the Class of 2023. That doesn’t mean they’ve been elected. It simply means they will be presented to the Hall’s 49-member board of selectors when it convenes in early 2023.\n\nLOOKING BACK\n\nBy Chris Willis, NFL Films\n\nGeorge A. Richards, Lions owner, 1934-1940\n\nToday we take a look back at a very unique and important women in NFL history.\n\nOn Wednesday July 13, 2022, Rozene Supple passed away at her home at Smoke Tree Ranch in Palm Springs, California. She was 97 years old.\n\nSupple was the daughter of George A. Richards the original owner of the Detroit Lions.\n\nWhile doing research for my biography on Joe F. Carr, the former NFL President (1921-1939) I was fortunate to interview Supple. On December 4, 2009 I sat down with her at her home in Palm Springs to talk about her famous father and his purchasing the Portsmouth Spartans and moving the franchise to the Motor City.\n\nThe 85-year old Supple spent nearly two hours chatting about her father. I learned more than I ever could about the man who not only owned the Lions but created a legacy that is still felt in Detroit, especially with his creation of the Lions Thanksgiving Day game tradition. During that visit you could feel the pride and love she had for her father.\n\nGeorge Arthur Richards was born on (March 19, 1888) in Crete, Illinois to his parents, James W. and Stella Richards. The son of an insurance agent, young George lost his father at a young age and would be raised by his single mother. She would be a single mom to seven children- Ralph, Helen, Horace, Clarinda, Florence, George, and Stella. Eventually she would work as a trained nurse to help support her family.\n\nRichards began his working career at a very early age, first becoming a shoe salesman working on commission. Then he would bounce around working in Columbus, Ohio and then in Detroit as a special superintendent for a tire manufacturing company.\n\nGeorge Richards, circa 1908\n\nIn 1911 he became a very successful salesman for a tire company, which gradually developed into him running his own automobile dealership. Richards eventually sold his auto franchise to General Motors for a reported $100,000 to go into the emerging radio industry. The flamboyant Richards invested in two 50,000-watts stations in Detroit (WJR radio) and Cleveland (WGAR). In 1937 he would add KMPC of Hollywood, California, and his empire would be called the Richards Stations. “He always loved football,” said Rozene Supple. “I think he really missed never having gone to college because he really got enthusiastic about Michigan and Michigan State. I think his dream was to have a football team. But radio was his real interest. That’s what paid the bills.”\n\nIn 1934 Richards was an established star in the radio industry, and WJR in Detroit was the city’s most popular station, nicknamed “the Good Will Station.” Richards was intrigued by the offer to own a franchise and felt honored that Carr would seek him out to invest. “My father was a rather small, five-feet-eight, but vocal man,” says Supple. “He always enjoyed sports, so it was a perfect fit for him.”\n\nAt the 1934 winter meeting NFL President Joe F. Carr sought out H. G. Salsinger, the esteemed sports editor of the Detroit News, who was covering the meetings. Carr knew that pro football had failed four times in Detroit before. The Heralds (1920); Tigers (1921); Panthers (1925–1926), led by Jimmy Conzelman; and Benny Friedman’s Wolverines (1928) all tried to capture the fancy of the Motor City but couldn’t. Even with that track record, Carr still considered it a prime location for an NFL team. It was the perfect spot for the struggling small-town Portsmouth Spartans.\n\nCarr met with Salsinger, who was well respected in the city when it came to his knowledge of sports. His connections would be vital in finding an investor. Salsinger was receptive to the idea to help the league, so President Carr commissioned him an agent. Salsinger returned to Detroit and started to put together a committee of influential sportsmen, but they were still missing a key investor who would put up the money to buy the Spartans. While having lunch at the Detroit Athletic Club, Salsinger’s group saw Leo Fitzpatrick, an executive at WJR radio in Detroit. The group thought Fitzpatrick’s boss was the perfect man to invest—he had money and was a big football buff. Fitzpatrick listened to the proposition, liked it, and promised to relay the information to his boss - G. A. Richards.\n\nRichards was a fan of the NFL and had the financial means to support a franchise. It was a perfect combination. Carr then arranged for Richards to meet with Spartans executive Harry Snyder in Detroit to discuss the compensation for transfer. “It did not take much persuasion for me to enter the pro game,” Richards said in October of 1934. At this time, Richards was forty-five years old and a millionaire.\n\nGeorge Richards, Lions owner, circa 1936\n\nOn March 23, one day after returning from Detroit, Snyder traveled to Columbus, Ohio, to confer with Carr on the negotiations relative to the transfer of the Spartans to Detroit. In his office Carr heard the terms in detail and announced that the agreement would be completed in ten days, because the Spartans shareholders had to officially sign off on the deal. On April 5 the stockholders met in the Shelby auditorium and agreed to sell. Richards and his syndicate agreed to purchase the Spartans for $15,000, which included the contracts of head coach Potsy Clark and all the players. He also agreed to pay off the remaining $6,500 (Lions media guide says $7,952.08) debt of the Portsmouth owners. Richards not only had an NFL franchise, he had an experienced, well-stocked, well-coached team.\n\nRichards announced that the franchise’s front office would include William Alfs, a local Detroit attorney, as vice president; Cy Huston, who operated billiard halls and bowling centers in Ann Arbor and Detroit, as general manager; and P. M. Thomas, an executive at WJR radio, as secretary-treasurer. He then revealed that the team would play its home games at University of Detroit stadium (capacity 25,000). It was also announced that the new franchise would drop the Spartans nickname. Just like George Halas did in Chicago, Richards honored the city’s baseball team, the Tigers, by choosing the ball team’s more ferocious counterpart and named the squad the Detroit Lions. A team spokesperson would say, “The lion is monarch of the jungle and we hope to be the monarch of the league.”\n\nYoung Rozene grew up going to Lions games. Sometimes she would sit on the bench to watch the action. One photo that made the Detroit newspapers shows her sitting next to the children of coach Potsy Clark wearing a football helmet and sideline jacket. Rozene would witness the Lions early history in Detroit. She saw the rivalry against the Chicago Bears.\n\nRozene Supple, in middle, at Lions game, Potsy Clark's daughters on left and right\n\n“He always admired George Halas, but the Bears were notoriously dirty men,” said Supple. “They didn’t have referees calling everything. They had a tackle named George Musso. Well Musso used to put aluminum bands on his wrists and tape them up. Bang! Teeth all over the place. One time Ace Gutowsky, our fullback, took the ball on a kickoff. I was sitting on the bench. He didn’t’ care where he went except for Musso. He put his head down, they used to call him the human battering ram. He put his head down and hit Musso right in the stomach. Knocked him out. It took about six guys to carry him off.”\n\nIn 1935, their second season in Detroit, the Lions defeated the New York Giants, 26-7, to win the NFL championship. “Oh he was just full of himself. He just thought that was the greatest,” recalled Supple. Because of that championship the city of Detroit was now a football town. The failures of the past were now in the rear view mirror.\n\nSupple cherished her relationship with some of the Lions players. She kept a small blue autograph book with signatures of all the players. Even after seventy years she has kept the autograph book, showing me the signatures. “Oh, I loved them all and some of their wives were neat too,” recalled Supple.\n\nIn 1940 George Richards was forced to sell the team due to health issues. He permanently resided in California, where Rozene would spend the rest of her life.\n\nRozene Supple, high school, circa 1940\n\nOver the past few decades Supple and her husband Ric supported the arts in Palm Springs. They owned several radio stations and became heavily involved in operated the Camelot Theatre – which became the center of the Palm Springs Cultural Center.\n\nDuring my time interviewing Rozene Supple I learned much about her father and the early days of the NFL. It was a trip that I’ll always remember.\n\nRozene Supple with her husband Ric\n\nBy Jeffrey J. Miller\n\nI was eleven years old in 1972, on the very cusp of the age range targeted by a promotional campaign sponsored by the combined forces of the National Football League and Dallas-based Sun Oil Company. And though some readers might have been born too late to take part or remember the campaign, and still others might have been a bit too old to take part, the stamp collecting craze that ensued left an indelible imprint on thousands of football fans of my demographic group.\n\nThat fall, Sun Oil, better known as Sunoco to the average motorist of the day, introduced a promotion that had kids (as well as the occasional grown-up) endeavoring to accumulate the entire collection of 624 NFL player stamps and paste them into one of two collector books.With each fill-up at the neighborhood Sunoco station, customers would receive a sealed pack of nine stamps, though sometimes an attendant could be cajoled into giving more.The kid would hurriedly tear off the ends that sealed the pack to see which nine players he or she had just acquired.Sometimes a pack contained several needed stamps, but as time passed and her or his collector book became more filled, the odds of finding needed stamps grew smaller.\n\nThere were 26 teams in 1972, the third year since the AFL-NFL merger.Each team was represented by 24 stamps, representing a full offensive squad of 12 players and a corresponding number on the defensive side.The photography used was gorgeous, with bright colors and sharp graphics.Most of the stamps depicted players in game action, though a few head shots were used. What made this collection especially appealing was the fact that the team logos were clearly visible on the players’ helmets.This was in stark contrast with the football cards issued by Topps at the time.Since Topps had a licensing agreement was with the Players Association but not the league, the logos were hastily airbrushed from the photos.\n\nThere was a classic commercial which featured Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula, which is interesting in hindsight since the Dolphins’ historic undefeated season was that very same year.\n\nTwo different books were available to collectors. The first was the budget priced 56-page book for 89 cents, which contained a review of the previous year’s Super Bowl and stamp pages for every NFL team. The deluxe version, at $2.49, was a lavish 128 pages with team histories and photos of each team’s notable players. Each book came with six 24-stamp sheets (144 stamps) to get the collector started. The rest of the collection would have to be acquired at the gas station or via trade with the kids’ friends. Though it was important to gather the entire collection, there were many notable Only-Issues, Rookies and Hall of Famers, including Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, O.J. Simpson, Alan Page, Bart Starr, Bob Lilly, Dick Butkus, Herb Adderley, and many more. And where else is one going to find a (Saints CB) D’Artagnan Martin or (Oakland WR) Drew Buie card? This was it!\n\nThere was an 82-piece supplement to the original 624-stamp collection released later that fall. It featured players who had been recently acquired, traded, whatever. It's not exactly clear how these pieces were supposed to fit into the collector books, but they were available in short supply, and are now extremely hard to find.\n\nI still have my original book, along with a couple of others I picked up over the years. They are pretty beat up, and only one is complete. Every once in a while, I will be looking for something in my archive closet and come across them but have not spent much time looking at one in years. That changed recently while I was looking for a book on eBay and a couple of these books came up on my feed. Curiosity got the better of me and I ventured down the rabbit hole. Sealed copies of the books were going for astronomical prices (in my opinion) but after thinking about it, I figured such copies must be extremely rare. After all, where would somebody find them? However, I came across a guy who actually had a few sealed deluxe versions for $35! Not too hefty. I do not know why, but my impulses got the better of me and I ordered one. It arrived a week later. It was sealed and, as a long-time vinyl record collector well aware of how much a sealed item depreciates after removing the shrink wrap, I decided to open it up and bask in its pristine glory. I was glad I did! This book really belongs in my vast football library. What a great time capsule, on par with the “Football Stars of 1969” type books published by Pyramid Books and other houses back when I was a kid. Plus, the photography was outstanding.\n\nTwo of my original stamp books. Yeah, pretty beat up!\n\nI clearly did a pretty poor job of attaching the stamps.\n\nI am now thinking I would like to try to relive a childhood adventure and fill a clean book. I have ordered another copy to keep sealed and will begin the journey of gathering untorn packets of stamps until I have completed the task. This one will be filled neatly—stamps cleanly separated from each other and placed squarely into the book with no yellowing tape or wrinkling glue. I will post updates of my progress.\n\nI am also very interested to hear from others who collected these stamps as a kid. Do you still have your books? How far did you get in collecting the entire lot?"
