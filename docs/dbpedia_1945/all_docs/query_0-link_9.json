A brief burst in the middle of the season (2-1-1) was quickly forgotten as the Packers lost their last five games. The Executive Committee openly second-guessed head coach Gene Ronzani at every opportunity. Certain members of the committee even asked players what they thought the coach was doing wrong. The players backed up their coach, but the turmoil did not help a team that was weak to start with. Finally, with two games left in a dismal campaign, the committee fired Ronzani, issuing a statement that he had resigned. Assistants Chuck Drulis, Hugh Devore and Ray (Scooter) McLean were appointed to take over, but after three days the committee dropped Drulis from the equation. Regardless, the Packers dropped both games under their new co-coaches to end their worst season since 1949 (2-10), and the hope and promise of their .500 record in 1952 was a distant and fading memory.\n\n​\n\nJIM RINGO: THE HALL-OF-FAMER WHO ALMOST WAS NOT\n\nSOURCE: Pro Football Researchers.com - Jim Ringo looked around Green Bay's 1953 training camp and decided he didn't below there. Not only was he a lowly seventh round draft choice from a school that had lost its last football game 61-6, but he was also dreadfully small compared to the other centers in camp. Sticking around was a waste of time. He decided to go home. But back in Easton, PA., both his wife and his father jumped all over him. How could he quit after only two weeks without rally giving himself a chance? Besides, asked his father, where else could he earn $5,250 for four months' work? Ringo returned to the Pack, and the rest, as they say, is history. He not only earned the starting center job but went on to become one of the top pivots in the Game's history -- six times all-NFL, ten pro bowl selections and election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1981. By 1959, Jim was regularly winning individual honors, but the Packers seldom won any games. Then Vince Lombardi arrived to change all that. As one observer put it: \"When Lombardi built the Packers, he started with his only All-Pro, Jim Ringo, and filled in the other All-Stars around him.\" Ringo anchored the offensive line on championship teams in 1961 and 1962. After a near miss in 1963, Lombardi reshuffled the Pack. Jim was traded to Philadelphia where he put in four more all-star years. His final game was his tenth pro bowl. Jim used quickness, desire, and savvy to make up for anything he may have lacked in bulk. He learned fast and he was durable. After injuries knocked him out of the final seven games of his rookie year, he never again failed to answer the starting gun. When he retired, he held the record (since broken) for consecutive games played -- 182.\n\nBorn: Orange, N.J., November 21, 1932 Hgt: 6-1 Wgt: 230 College: Syracuse\n\nPro Teams: Green Bay Packers 1953 - 1963; Philadelphia Eagles 1964 - 1967\n\nAll-Pro: 1957, AP; 1959, AP, UPI; 1960, AP, UPI; 1961, AP, UPI; 1962, AP, UPI; 1963, AP, UPI\n\nPro Bowl: 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967\n\nPro Football Hall of Fame: 1981\n\nNAME NO POS HGT WGT COLLEGE YR PR A G HOW ACQUIRED\n\nDick Afflis 72 G 6- 0 250 Nevada 3 3 24 12 1951 Draft-16th\n\nBen Aldridge 40 DB 6- 1 195 Oklahoma State 1 4 26 8 1953 Trade-SF\n\nByron Bailey 20 HB 5-11 198 Washington St 1 2 22 9 1953 FA-Det (52)\n\nDon Barton 43 HB 5-11 175 Texas 1 1 23 5 1953 FA\n\nJ.R.

Early reports of League Commissioner Bert Bell in Philly indicate that money will be the No. 1 item of business. Others are returning Baltimore to the circuit, drafting 360 simon-pure athletes, and voting on several Bell-made suggestions - all aimed at saving money. Out east, they're referring to the upcoming meeting as the most vital in league history and entertaining the idea\n\nthat the entire structure of the league might be overhauled. Bell has publicly stated that he is plenty worried about the future of professional football in the U.S. and he makes no secret of his concerns. Bell feels that \"something has to be done about a business where you can lose more in one year than the average team can make in three years; we have to get this game down to a sound business basis where the operation is run with the mind and not the heart.\" Only four teams in the NFL made what financially minded people would call \"real money\". One or two teams edged in to the black and the rest wrote in red ink. The commissioner says something has to be done or the four money makers will be playing without the other eight. The commissioner said he will suggest two things that could relieve the dollar pressure: 1 - Cut the player limit from 33 to 30 players. 2 - Urge all clubs to cut their overheard expenses. On the first point the commissioner said that now the teams have a squad list of 33 players plus three on the injured list, which in reality means they're playing 36 players. \"I say 30 players on a club are plenty. They'd have three allowed on the injured list so actually they'd have 33. The thing to do is hire more double duty ball players. We can't afford to pay specialists. Football players should be prepared to play offense and defense. It's okay in the colleges where most kids get a chance to play. But we're not giving out letters nor building character. We're in business. We play cold cash. Let's hire as many player as we actually need.\" On the subject of expenses, Bell also had a definite opinion. \"I feel that clubs spend too much money on hotel and food bills. They don't have to stay at the best hotels in town and eat the most expensive food. They can stay at respectable, clean, good eating places. I wouldn't ask a boy to eat or sleep in any place I wouldn't eat or sleep. But, let's face it, our clubs today have to stay at the best.\" Bell said owners have to learn to judge players with their minds and not their hearts. \"When you're paying big money and a man doesn't produce, either cut his salary or get rid of him. You can't be a philanthropist in pro football and make ends meet.\"...Reportedly, the commissioner is in favor of reducing the guarantee to visiting teams from $20,000 to $15,000. A visiting club receives $20,000 or 40 percent of the gate - whichever is greater...As if the financial structure of the league isn't bad enough, the government's anti-trust suit against the NFL's television policy comes up in federal court in Philadelphia Jan. 26 - the day after the annual meeting ends. The suit means a great deal to NFL clubs, including the Packers, who don't have their home games televised anywhere. If the league loses, salary scales in pro football may take a severe drop. It's this TV money which helps to pay the money day big salaries. Television money doesn't have to split with anybody. It's clear profit...The Packers, like most of the other clubs, likely will be going after big, hard-running halfbacks. Almost all of the clubs likely will be in the market for Billy Vessels, the highly-publicized halfback from Oklahoma. Packer Coach Gene Ronzani is in Mobile, Ala.. today viewing the Senior bowl game. He'll return next week to complete plans for the Packers' select list. The Packers are one of six clubs still in the running for the bonus pick. These clubs will take part in drawing numbers out of a hat, the lucky coach receiving his choice of any player in the country. The regular draft, in which each club selects 30 players, will follow.\n\nPACKERS IN 'MIDDLE' ON COLLEGE STAR DRAFT\n\nJAN 7 (Green Bay) - The NFL's college player draft, which is designed to make the weak strong and the strong weak, will find the Packers practically in the \"middle\" when the twelve clubs gather for their annual picking party in Philadelphia Jan. 22. Which is to say the Packers will draft in the No. 6 position. Ahead of them will be Baltimore (Texans), first; the Chicago Cardinals and Washington, second and third; and the Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh, fourth and fifth. Behind the Packers will be San Francisco, Philadelphia and New York, seventh, eighth and ninth; Cleveland 10th; the Los Angeles Rams 11th; and champion Detroit 12th. The order of the draft is based on the percentages of the previous season, with the bottom club drafting first, etc. In the case of a tie (with the exception of the champion, which automatically drafts last, or 12th, on each round), the coaches of the tying clubs flip a coin to see who will draw ahead of the other on the opening round. On the succeeding rounds, the clubs will alternate. A year ago, for example, the Packers and Cardinals finished in a tie for the second spot behind the New York Yanks. On the flip, the Cards won and they drafted second and the Packers third on the first round. On the next round, the Packers drew second and Cardinals third. Each team will select 30 players - one each in the 30 rounds. Preceding the draft will be the annual bonus pick, in which six \"remaining\" clubs, including the Packers, will draw numbers out of a hat. The winner gets his pick of any player in the country...Packer Coach Gene Ronzani, who will handle the selecting for Green Bay, just missed winning bonus pick in the last two years, the New York Giants landing halfback Kyle Rote in '51 and the Rams grabbing quarterback Bill Wade last January. Ronzani isn't revealing any possible draft names. He's merely hoping for \"some luck\" in the bonus session and, of course, in the entire draft. Ronzani will enter the selection event with lists and cards containing the names of thousands of potential professional players. And by \"luck\", Ronzani says he hopes the draft turns out as well a year ago, when eight out the 30 (a high percentage) made the team, including the top three picks - Babe Parilli, Bill Howton and Bobby Dillon. Ronzani, like other pro coaches, isn't tipping his hand on his top choices, although it seemed apparent last season that the Packers were in need of halfbacks. Gene feels that \"the draft will be a success if we can draft good football players who want to play.\"...The Packers enter the draft with three \"holdovers\" from a year ago - boys who were selected in the 1951 draft for use in 1953. Actually, four \"extras\" were picked last January, but one of them, fullback Bobby Jack Floyd, decided to play pro ball in '52 - and made the team. The threesome already in the safe are tackles Jack Morgan of Michigan State and Charley LaPradd of Florida and halfback Billy Hair of Clemson. Both Morgan and LaPradd are war veterans, which should make them available for '53. Morgan stands 6-2 and packs 235 pounds, while LaPradd, named recently to the AP All-America defensive squad, goes 6-3, 222. Hair, a passer and runner, is slim at six feet, 178 pounds. Ronzani presently is putting the finishing touches on the draft list. Player Scout Jack Vainisi and backfield coach Ray McLean are at the NCAA convention in Washington, conferring with the college coaches on a number of prospects the Packers intend to draft.\n\nBALTIMORE FANS HIT GOAL; SEEK OWNER\n\nJAN 7 (Philadelphia) - A man with the necessary cash and character is all that’s needed today to bring Baltimore back into the NFL family. Pro football fans in Baltimore have signed up for 15,000 season tickets – the goal set by NFL Commissioner Bert Bell before he would grant Baltimore a franchise. Bell said Tuesday night he is ready to live up to his part of the bargain. The next step: To find somebody with about $200,000 to buy the franchise including the players of the defunct Dallas Texans. Baltimore would replace the Texans in the loop. Bell said all money realized from ticket sales in Baltimore – an expected $250,000 – must be used for club operation. There are two leading candidates for ownership: Carroll Rosenbloom, 45-year old wealthy Baltimore clothing manufacturer who played football at the University of Pennsylvania while Bell was coaching there; Bruce Livie, Baltimore owner of the Bluebonnet racing stable and head of the NFL ticket sale drive in Baltimore. Bell says he favors Rosenbloom. He described the Baltimoreans as the sort of civic-minded person the club and league could use. Rosenbloom is willing to purchase the new club, Bell said, except for one thing – he’s not happy about the personal publicity the job may entail. He may withdraw for that reason. Livie said a group of businessmen have asked him to head a syndicate of wealthy purchasers. “All of them are well-to-do and are more interested in keeping a team in Baltimore than merely making money out of the venture,” Livie said. Individual fans bought an estimate 85 percent of the 15,000 seasons tickets already sold. Tuesday night the American Oil company pledged to buy the final 2,000. Bell had set Jan. 22 as a goal for the 15,000 tickets. After the problem of ownership is solved, a coach must be found. For this job, Bell has been plugging Keith Molesworth, backfield coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers last season and former coach at Navy.\n\nAIR POWER? HOWTON AT RH, HIRSCH, BOX AT ENDS IN BOWL TILT\n\nJAN 8 (Los Angeles) - Professional football’s greatest players added another tuneup drill to the schedule today as they prepare for the third annual pro bowl battle in Memorial Coliseum Saturday afternoon. The game, which will be televised – but not locally – by the National Broadcasting company, brings together all-star squads, representing the American and National conferences of the NFL. The rival coaches, Buddy Parker, who steered Detroit to the NFL championship and leads the Nationals, and runner-up Cleveland’s Paul Brown, guiding the Americans, planned a final rough workout today. Los Angeles, home of the Rams, is a National division town and, of course, is pulling for the Parker squad. The Rams are well represented on the all-star team. Included are fullback Dan Towler, end Elroy Hirsch, halfback Tank Younger, quarterback Norm Van Brocklin, linebacker Don Paul and linemen Stan West and Jim Winkler. The Americans will lead off with an offensive backfield that lists quarterback Otto Graham of Cleveland, halfbacks Ray Mathews and Lynn Chandnois of Pittsburgh and fullback Ollie Matson of the Chicago Cards. Parker will shoot first with quarterback Bobby Layne and halfback Bob Hoernschemeyer of the Lions, Towler and, in a switch, Bill Howton, sensational pass catching end for Green Bay, at right half. Parker obviously is air-minded. With Howton, Hirsch and Cloyce Box of Detroit, the latter pair at the ends, he has three of the finest receivers in the business. Alternating with thrower Layne will be Van Brocklin. Other Packers with the Nationals are defensive end Ab Wimberly and Deral Teteak.\n\nFOUR OF SIX BONUS SELECTIONS PLAYING; AP ALL-PROS CHOSEN\n\nJAN 9 (Green Bay) - How would you feel if you won the bonus pick and your selection didn’t make your team? It can happen. Six NFL teams won the right to name their choice in the annual pre-draft, drawing-out-of-a-hat ceremony. Four of the six stars chosen are playing today. One of the two, quarterback Bill Wade of Vanderbilt, never had a chance because Uncle Sam snapped him up before his civilian owners, the Los Angeles Rams, got around to opening the 1952 season. The Chicago Bears, who can get lucky at times, won the first bonus pick in 1947, but their selection, halfback Bob Fennimore of Oklahoma A and M, quit after averaging three yards on 53 carries as a rookie. Of the remaining four choices, only one made an all-pro first team this season – Chuck Bednarik, the elbowing linebacker of the Philadelphia Eagles, who won the honor on the AP squad. The other three players are end Leon Hart of Detroit, halfback Kyle Rote of New York and quarterback Harry Gilmer of Washington. Hart, a 260-pounder, probably is the best of the lot because of his ability to catch a pass, kill somebody when he starts running and play defensive end. Rote was bothered all 1951 with a chronic knee condition but finished seventh among league ground gainers in ’52 with a 4.1 average. Gilmer was moved away from Sammy Baugh’s shadow when Eddie LeBaron arrived and spent most of last fall as a halfback. Gilmer was famous at Alabama for his leaping pass which, of course, is suicide in the pro league. It’s a wonder he never was sliced in two sections, at that. The writers around the league seem to think a quarterback will be the bonus pick this year. Teams competing for the extra star are Green Bay, Cleveland, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Chicago Cardinals and Baltimore. The QB guess is based on the fact that LA’s Bob Waterfield, ‘Frisco’s Frankie Albert and Washington’s Baugh are retiring. LA and Washington can’t bonus anyway, but SF likely will go for the QB. The Cardinals and Baltimore are most hard up for QBs, while the Packers, Cleveland and Pittsburgh are fairly well set, barring a call or two from Uncle Sam. The country isn’t loaded with “name” QBs this year and the report is that the present crop isn’t as skillful as a year ago. The topsters in ’51 were Babe Parilli, the Packer, and LA’s Wade. Maryland’s Jack Scarbath is rated among the best QB bets for the picking party in Philadelphia Jan. 22. Others are Texas’ Tee Jones, Oklahoma’s Eddie Crowder, Charley Maloy of Holy Cross, Ted Marchibroda of Detroit and Dale Samuels of Purdue. Two other QBs who probably would have been high on the list are Tommy O’Connell of Illinois and Harry Agganis of Boston College, but both are unavailable. O’Connell was picked by the Chicago Bears last year after his original class was graduated and Agganis was chosen by the Cleveland Browns. Agganis, however, already has signed for a baseball career with the Boston Red Sox…The AP’s all-pro teams failed to come up with a Packer and only two Bays were given honorable mention – end Bill Howton and quarterback Parilli. Beating out Howton were Cloyce Box of Detroit, who did his damage in the last three games, and Gordon Soltau of San Francisco. We’re wondering if the balloting wasn’t gummed up along the way somewhere because the AP writer in the state cast votes for Packers John Martinkovic and Deral Teteak in addition to Howton and Parilli. Yet, Martinkovic and Teteak failed to get mention. Here are the AP’s two teams (no second teams were picked): Offense – Ends, Box and Soltau; tackles, George Connor, Bears, and Leo Nomellini, Forty Niners; guards, Lou Creekmur, Lions, and Lou Groza, Browns (Groza never played guard in his life); center, Frank Gatzki, Browns; backs, Bobby Layne, Lions, Hugh McElhenny, Forty Niners, Eddie Price, Giants, and Dan Towler, Rams. Defense – Ends, Len Ford, Browns, Pete Pihos, Eagles; tackles, Arnie Weinmeister, Giants, Thurman McGraw, Lions; guards, Stan West, Rams, Bill Willis, Browns; linebackers, Chuck Bednarik, Eagles, Jerry Shipkey, Steelers; halfbacks, Jack Christiansen, Lions, Ollie Matson, Cardinals; safety, Emlen Tunnell, Giants.\n\nHOWTON HELPS NC BEAT AC IN PRO BOWL, 27-7\n\nJAN 12 (Los Angeles) - The Green Bay Packers’ three players in the pro bowl football game made excellent contributions to the National conference’s 27-7 victory here Saturday. And Bill Howton figured as half of the day’s feature attraction. The big play of the game was the 74-yard scoring pass from Norm Van Brocklin of the Los Angeles Rams to the rookie from Rice. It was the first quarter, and the Nationals had scored once. The Americans had been held after the kickoff, and had punted to the Nationals’ 26. Van Brocklin went into the game for the first time. On the first play, he faded back and unlimbered one of the long, soaring tosses which made him the league’s outstanding passer during the 1952 season. Howton was going full speed down the right sideline. Full speed had to be exceptional because the pass was well ahead of him and running hard at his side was one of the best defenders in the league, all-pro Emlen Tunnell of the New York Giants…SEEMED TO STUMBLE: Howton caught the ball on his fingertips and kept right on sprinting. For a second, he seemed to stumble, but even so the speedy Tunnell couldn’t catch him. Cutting sharply out of the latters’ patch, he romped across untouched. As it turned out, it was the score which won the game and it left the crowd of nearly 35,000 gasping. Howton wound up the day with the best reception record on either squad, 81 yards in two catches. He figured in an offensive idea of Nationals’ coach Buddy Parker, which plagued the Americans all day – three top pass-catching ends. Parker used Elroy Hirsch and Cloyce Box on the ends, and worked Howton from the halfback spot. The Americans found the trio most difficult to defend against. Green Bay’s other players, end Abner Wimberly was the fastest down the field getting down under punts, and once drew the crowd’s cheers by driving between two interference runners and spilling Tunnell just when he seemed away after catching a punt…TETEAK ON OFFENSE: Teteak, along with other linemen on both sides, suffered somewhat from an apparent superiority of defense which held ground gains to surprisingly small figures but he was a standout offensively opening holes for the club’s Dan Towler, Joe Perry and Hugh McElhenny, when they needed yardage. The Nationals’ first score came on a 12-yard pass from Towler to McElhenny. Fullback Pat Harder, Detroit, added three extra points and kicked two field goals to help the Nationals along. It wasn’t until the final period that Otto Graham was able to steer his American teammates to a touchdown. The 82-yard drive was the longest of the game. Graham rammed across for the final yard.\n\nPUT CARDINALS IN NC? BATTLE LOOMS OVER BALTIMORE'S SPOT\n\nJAN 13 (Green Bay) - Commissioner Bert Bell’s prediction last night that there’s “going to be a terrific fight in Philadelphia” over the conference in which Baltimore will be placed, brought a flood of comment from our town’s coffee corners. And it all simmered to something like this: Why not put Baltimore in the American conference and place the Chicago Cardinals in the National conference. Since all coffee drinkers here are Packer fans – first and last – it can be assumed that they had method in their madness. Like this, for instance: The two-game league rivalry between the Packers and Cardinals, dead since 1950 when the two clubs were placed in different conferences, could thus be resumed. The Packer-Card rivalry is the Bays’ second oldest, taking back seat only to the famed Packer-Chicago Bear series which is now 68 games deep in the record books. The Packers and Cardinals have engaged in 51 games, 29 decisions going to the Pack, 19 (including the last seven) to the Cards and three ending in knots. With Baltimore in the American conference, the league could resume its Eastern and Western division setups. The only “odd ball” in the American or Eastern arrangement, as it now stands, is the Chicago Cardinal entry. Baltimore, of course, succeeds Dallas which was in the National or Western conference. Present alignment of the two loops has Green Bay, Chicago Bears, Detroit, Los Angeles, Baltimore and San Francisco in the National and New York, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago Cardinals, Philadelphia and Cleveland in the American…ELIMINATE SCHEDULE DIFFICULTY: Return of the Cardinals to the Western division would eliminate some of the schedule difficulty brought about by the “must” two-game city league series between the Bears and Cardinals. Under league rules, teams of opposite loops play each other only once in the same season – with that one (Bear-Cardinal) exception. Teams in the same conference are supposed to play each other twice, although the Packers, for instance, only played the San Francisco Forty Niners once in each of the two seasons. Opposition to switching the Cardinals to the National conference could come from George Halas, owner-coach of the Bears. While such a change would continue the two-game Bear-Cardinal series, it would rule out a league championship playoff between the two clubs. The two teams never battled in a league playoff since the circuit was split into two divisions in 1933. Bell’s battle prediction is based on expected pressure from Washington to place Baltimore in the Eastern sector. The two clubs are only 50 miles apart, and Washington wants that two-games series – permissible if they’re in the same loop…COACHES ARE APPOINTED: The Philadelphia meeting, scheduled to start Jan. 22 with a rules session on Jan. 21, will have to decide on Baltimore’s status. The Baltimore team became more or less “official” yesterday with appointment of two coaches and a president and general manager. Appointed head coach was Keith Molesworth, the former Chicago Bear who served as backfield mentor at Pittsburgh last fall. Named line coach was Ray Richards, who held that post with the Los Angeles Rams. Don Kellett of Philadelphia will preside over the front office as president and general manager. In an opening statement, Molesworth said: “Anybody who wants to play with Baltimore is going to have to put out to the limit; if anybody doesn’t want to play football, we don’t want them. I assure you the boys are going to be in shape.” Molesworth went into coaching after six years as a backfield star with the Bears. He tutored in the Navy backfield for seven years and later coached the Honolulu Warriors in the Pacific Coast league. Molesworth also led the Richmond Rebels to championships in the American Football league in 1949 and 1950. Kellett, who admitted he was giving up a radio-television job for a “hazardous and dangerous” position, added his assurance he wanted a hustling, “hungry team”. Those who will be guiding Baltimore’s football fortunes next fall will be working under a make-or-break proposition…TEXANS WON ONE GAME: The grid game had tough sledding under the old Colts. They went out of business after the 1951 season with a showing of one victory in their last 25 league games in both the NFL and the defunct All-America loop. Over four seasons in both circuits, they mustered only 11 victories while losing 41 and tying another. The Texans, who will make up the nucleus of the new team, don’t look any better on the record. In 12 games the past season, they came out on top once. Bell said the Baltimore operators are going to “pay a player what he’s worth and no more just because he was somebody’s All-America in college.” The city won a franchise in the league by purchasing 15,000 season tickets.\n\nPACKERS CLIMBING BACK?\n\nJAN 13 (Milwaukee) - Are the Green Bay Packers climbing back up the financial ladder? The answer will be available after the club's annual meeting within a few weeks and the chances are it will be reassuring because of one major factor - the Packers have started to draw again on the road. A year ago the club lost $18,672. In six games away from home last fall the club attracted just under 50,000 fans more than the same number of appearances in 1951, and about 35,000 more than in 1950. The totals, if you're interested in figures, were 189,483 last season; 139,973 the year before and 155,569 two years ago. Home attendance was up over a year ago, too, but by the surprisingly small margin of only 1,200 fans. The 1952 home draw was 107,151 compared with 105,591 the previous year. Both totals were well below the 118,621 figure in 1950. As a matter of fact, 64 per cent of the fans who saw the Packers perform in 1952 watched them on foreign fields. That's an increase of seven percent over a year ago and eight percent over 1950. There was a consequent drop in the home gate. The percentage of home against road crowds shows where the Packers are hurting most - right in Milwaukee, their own backyard. Fans attending Packer games here have dropped steadily for three years - from an average of 17,282 in 1950 to 14,858 the next year down to 13,833 last fall. Green Bay, for the same years, averaged 21,014, 19,058 and 21,884. That fact might well be mirrored in next year's schedule, which will be drawn within the next few months following the annual NFL meeting in Philadelphia January 22. It's entirely likely that four home games again will be played at Green Bay and only two here, a return to the 1950-51 system after the three-three split tried last fall. Milwaukee officials, with a new baseball stadium which the Packers will try to use for football, certainly will oppose any such move. But past experience with meager Milwaukee gates could be the influencing factor. Black ink, after all, is comforting on anybody's books.\n\nPACKERS START UPSURGE IN 5TH YEAR, FOLLOWING NORMAL TREND\n\nJAN 14 (Green Bay) - The “new” Green Bay Packers are almost three years of age. It’s about time for a review! Looking back briefly, it can be recalled that (1) E.L. (Curly) Lambeau resigned as head coach and general manager on Feb. 1, 1950, and (2) just six days later Gene Ronzani, former Chicago Bear player and assistant coach, signed a three-year contract as Lambeau’s successor. The early 1950 switch represented one of the most drastic changes in the history of major league sports. There were some who predicted the downfall of the sports wonder of the world, but today the Packers rank as one of the bulwarks of the 33-year old league – one of the three charter members still in operation, to be more specific. Have the Packers progressed during the three years of the new regime? Here’s the playing record of the club:\n\nW L .PCT PS OP\n\n1950 3 9 .250 244 406\n\n1951 3 9 .250 254 375\n\n1952 6 6 .500 295 312\n\nTotals 12 24 .333 794 1094\n\nYou’ll note that after two status-quo, 3-9 years, the Ronzani-coached Packers blossomed forth with a 6-6 season. They have shown improvement in the points scoring and allowed departments, the greatest advances being made in ’51 over 1951. The ’52 club scored 41 points more than the ’51 team and last year’s defense allowed opponents 63 fewer points than the ’51 outfit. The overall average shows the Packers’ scoring 20.4 points per game in three years compared to their opponents’ 30.4. Purely for comparative purposes, here are the standings of the Packers during Lambeau’s last three years:\n\nW L T .PCT PS OP\n\n1947 6 5 1 .545 274 210\n\n1948 3 9 0 .250 154 290\n\n1949 2 10 0 .167 114 329\n\nTotals 11 24 1 .314 542 829\n\nThe Packers of 1947-48-49 averaged 15.1 points per effort and permitted their opponents an average of 23.0. The fall and rise of the Packers in the six seasons is “illustrated” in the standings above. If you’ll recall, 1947 was one of those “toughies” highlighted by the loss of four games by nine points, but still the final record was 6-5-1. The sag started in ’48 and dropped one notch lower in ’49. The big rebuilding job started in ’50 and the result was one more victory than in ’49. Due to military calls and an unfortunate draft, no gain was shown in ’51 with the exception of fatter point columns. The successful draft a year ago set the stage for the upsurge last fall. Professional football experts figure it takes about five years to build a loser – via the draft – into a winner and even longer to reach championship heights. In addition, a certain amount of luck on and off the field is a virtual necessity to assure a .500 or better club. The Packers entered their fifth year since the skid in ’52, following the experts’ pattern. Ronzani set up shop here with a small nucleus from the 1949 team and Lambeau’s last college draft in January of 1950. Of the 30 players Curly selected, five made the ’50 Packers; a sixth, Carleton Elliott, made the grade in ’51; and a seventh player, Gordon Soltau, was traded to Cleveland for tackle Joe Spencer. The remaining five players were Clayton Tonnemaker, Tobin Rote, Larry Coutre, Jack Cloud and Leon Manley. They, together with Billy Grimes, Al Baldwin and Carl Schuette, who were obtained in the pro draft following the merger in ’50, played key roles on Ronzani’s first team. Just when it appeared that the Packers might be building up considerable strength for 1951, the military picture darkened. Tonnemaker, an all-pro as a rookie; Coutre; Len Szafaryn, who had been obtained in a trade for veteran Paul Lipscomb; and veteran Bob Forte were called into service. With the Korean war raging, most of the clubs, including the Packers, drafted married or older players in January of 1951 in the belief that some players would be better than no players. The crop didn’t pan out, however, and only three made the grade – Fred Cone, Dick Afflis and Ray Pelfrey. The No. 1 choice, Bob Gain, decided to play in Canada. Thus, the season of 1951 was all but lost! All of the clubs, again including the Packers, decided to take their chances with the military in the draft a year ago. As a result, the Packers came forth with eight shots in the arm – Babe Parilli, Bill Howton, Bobby Dillon, Dave Hanner, Tom Johnson, Bill Reichardt, Deral Teteak and Bobby Jack Floyd. In addition, the Packers obtained draft choices of three other clubs via trades – Steve Ruzich, Steve Dowden and Dick Logan. Of the 11 players, three or four may be lost to the military. Reichardt, the Iowa fullback, already has gone. But at least two of the ’50 stars are due back next fall – Coutre and Szafaryn – and there is an outside chance Tonnemaker may return for ’53. Coaching changes have been few during the three-year span. Ronzani started in ’40 with a fulltime staff composed of line coach Tarz Taylor, end coach Dick Plasman and backfield coach Ray Nolting. Hired on a temporary basis to help coordinate the T formation in 1950 was Clark Shaughnessy, who worked about a month. The 1951 season saw Ray McLean replace Nolting as backfield mentor and the addition of Chuck Drulis, a Packer in ’50, as line assistant. The same staff operated in ’52, although Joe Stydahar, the former Los Angeles head coach, was named administrative assistant to Ronzani late in the season. The new regime brought two other newcomers to the “team” office – Jug Earp, the former Packer all-time center who serves as public relations director, and Jack Vainisi, the Chicagoan and onetime Notre Dame tackle who works as a player scout and office assistant. The Packers of the last three years have shown up and downs at the gate. Unofficial home attendance for 1950 was 118,621 (six league games), but it dropped to 105,969 in ’51 and gained slightly to 107,151 in ’52. The 1950 road attendance (six league games) was 155,569. It skidded to 140,0332 in ’51, but leaped to an amazing 189,483 in ’52 – an increase of over 49,000. In the old regime’s last year (1949), the Packers drew 104,832 at home and 142,426 on the road. Financially, the Packers are expected to bat around .667. They made around $13,000 in ’50, dropped slightly over $18,000 in ’51, and are expected to show a profit for ’52. In short, they gained in two out of the three seasons. That, in brief, is the story of the new regimes. Chapter II will start immediately after the Jan. 22 draft of college players – the present regime’s third picking party!\n\nPRO GRID SPORT IN CLASS BY ITSELF\n\nJAN 15 (Green Bay) - Professional football sat in a class by itself today, following the killing of the two-platoon system by the colleges. The pro sport remains as the only full-speed-for-60-minutes gridiron nationwide spectacle, barring a chance to the “old days” by the NFL. And this is very unlikely – almost fantastic! Packer coach Gene Ronzani, who played and coaches in both systems as a pro, recalled today that professional football adopted two-platoon (free substitution) football as a means of making the game more spectacular and wide open. “It permits,” Gene said, “professional football players to go at top speed on offense and defense for 60 minutes.” Ronzani, reluctant to opine for or against the colleges’ decision, said he felt that the real purpose behind the move was to curb recruiting of college players. “It will stop the player evils that derived from the two-platoon system,” he said. The Packer coach did point out that the emphasis in college football likely would be on defense. The young athletes, Gene said, will have to learn to pace themselves for each game. The end of the two-platoon system by the colleges probably will be discussed by National league coaches at their annual rules meeting the night before the opening of the league convention in Philadelphia Jan. 22. The pro coaches, like most of the college coaches, undoubtedly are not in favor of returning to the old system. Commissioner Bert Bell recently suggested that pro clubs develop more two-way players in line with his request to reduce rosters from 33 to 30 players. The purpose behind this, of course, was to cut expenses. It is not believed that Bell wants to return to the no-platoon system since it would remove the “spectacular” from the game…While college coaches changed their practice plans for next fall, pro mentors continued plans for the draft in Philadelphia. Ronzani today welcomed Joe Stydahar, his administrative assistant, at the Packer office this morning. Stydahar arrived from his home in Los Angeles last night. Stydahar will assist in the Packers’ college player selections. He will accompany Ronzani, backfield coach Ray McLean and scout Jack Vainisi to Philadelphia. Stydahar joined the Packer staff Nov. 14 for the purpose of preparing the Packers’ draft list in the absence of Vainisi who at the time was recuperating from illness in Chicago…The first rumble was heard today on Commissioner Bell’s prediction that “there’ll be a battle over the conference in which Baltimore is placed.” It came from Pittsburgh where owner Art Rooney of the Steelers said he is considering switching his franchise from the American conference to the National conference. Several owners in both conference already have sounded him out, Rooney said. The question will be decided at the league’s meeting and all 12 clubs must approve the move. Rooney said some owners feel the Baltimore entry is not geographically located to replace the Dallas franchise. Bell awarded the Dallas franchise to Baltimore recently after the Texans folded for lack of money. The most logical team to replace Dallas in the National conference, Rooney said, would be the Chicago Cardinals, but conflicting dates with the Chicago Bears, already members of the National conference, must be considered.\n\nGRID GIANTS TO ADVOCATE 33-MAN LIMIT AT NFL MEET\n\nJAN 17 (New York) - The New York football Giants will advocate a more elastic schedule and a straight 33-man player limit at the NFL meeting, which opens next Thursday in Philadelphia. John V. Mara, Giants’ president, said today he wants a schedule which would bring all 11 other clubs in the NFL into the Polo Grounds over a three-year period. On the agenda for the NFL meeting are proposal to return the schedule making chores to the club owners from Commissioner Bert Bell and to reduce the player limit from 33 to 30. Under the present limit, Mara said, a club may place any number of players on a 30-day injury list. These men are outside the squad limit, so a club may carry 36 or even 40 players for a season. He favors a straight 33-man limit with injured men counted on the injured list at all times.\n\nTAYLOR OUT AS LINE COACH\n\nJAN 18 (Green Bay) - John (Tarzan) Taylor is out as line coach of the Green Bay Packers but reports that he would be replaced by Joe Stydahar, former head coach of the Los Angeles Rams, could not be confirmed Saturday. Coach Gene Ronzani, who has sole power to hire and fire his assistants, was not available for comment. John Torinus, a member of the NFL's club executive board, said Taylor, who three-year contract expired January 1, would not be back. \"But I think they're all wet on Stydahar,\" said Torinus. \"I don't know myself but I don't believe Stydahar will be with the Packers next fall.\" He said Taylor had told several friends that he was going into business and would not return to Green Bay. Stydahar, who resigned his Rams post early last season, later joined Green Bay as an administrative assistant and helped prepare the Packers' plans for the NFL draft.\n\nDICK PLASMAN NOT RETURNING TO PACK IN '53; THREE LEFT!\n\nJAN 19 (Green Bay) - Dick Plasman, the 16-year veteran of professional football as player and coach, said today in a letter to Packer coach Gene Ronzani that he does not plan to return in 1953. Plasman, who came to the Packers as end and defense coach in 1950, said that the press of business in Miami would keep him from rejoining the Packers. Plasman operates two cemeteries in the Florida city and he had planned to open a third. Plasman, who scouted the Orange bowl and a “star” game for the Packers recently, wished Ronzani and the Packers the best of luck in the future and wrote highly of his three years here. Moving his family back and forth and the expansion of his business – plus the fact that he could not give fulltime to his football duties – were reasons given by Plasman for not returning. Plasman joined the Chicago Bears in 1937 after making All-America at Vanderbilt. He played with the Bears through 1941 and gained the ranking as one of the pro game’s top all-around ends. He was called into the Navy late in 1941 and in 1946 he joined the Cardinals as player-coach. He coached under Jimmy Conzelman during the Cards’ championship regime. The Packer staff is now down to three members – Ronzani, backfield coach Ray McLean and line assistant Chuck Drulis. Though no official announcement has been made, line coach Tarz Taylor has told friends that he does not plan to return in ’53. Speculation that Joe Stydahar will take over as line coach has been in the air. Stydahar presently is here assisting scout Jack Vainisi and the coaches with the draft. Joe recently was named administrative assistant to Ronzani.\n\nGENE RONZANI SIGNS 3-YEAR PACKER PACT\n\nJAN 19 (Green Bay) – Head Coach Gene Ronzani has been signed to a new three-year contract with the Green Bay Packers, it was announced this afternoon. No terms were announced. The Packer head man, who came to Green Bay three years ago after Coach Curly Lambeau had resigned to join the Chicago Cardinals, and who has put the Packers on the comeback trail during his three-year regime, was thus given a vote of confidence by Packer officials as he prepared to leave for Philadelphia and the annual NFL meeting.\n\nRONZANI SET FOR THREE YEARS, POINTS TO DRAFT\n\nJAN 20 (Green Bay) - Packer Coach Gene Ronzani, with a new three-year contract safely in the vault, left today for the NFL convention in Philadelphia and his third stab at improving the Packers via the college player draft. Ronzani actually is preparing for his fourth season as head coach, but this third picking parley. Curly Lambeau, who will be selecting for Washington, presided at the Packers’ 1950 draft, but resigned two weeks later (Feb. 1, 1950). Ronzani was signed to his first three-year contract six days later. Accompanying Ronzani by air to the Quaker City are backfield coach Ray McLean, scout Jack Vainisi and administrative assistant Joe Stydahar, the former Los Angeles Ram head coach. Line assistant coach Chuck Drulis may drive over from his home near Philadelphia to furnish assistance, President Emil R. Fischer, who is expected to fly in from Florida where he is vacationing, and board chairman Lee H. Joannes…Before leaving this afternoon, Ronzani said that “my one ambition is to get the Packers up there and to keep them there.” Obviously pleased and relieved over the executive committee’s action, Ronzani admitted that “the strides have been slow in the last three years, but I feel that we’re on the right track. It started to show up last year and with some luck we might have finished higher.” Ronzani’s 1950-51 teams posted 3-9 records, while the 1952 club finished with 6-6. Ronzani expressed satisfaction that “the Packers are sound financially; it means that we (the coaches and officials) will have to work all the harder to remain in that condition. The fans, too, face the same kind of ‘tough job’ in the future to make the Packers champions again.”…And speaking of work, Ronzani pointed out the giant job of classifying the thousands of prospective Packers will continue on the trip to Philadelphia and possibly late into Wednesday night. The draft is scheduled to start about 10 o’clock (Green Bay time) Thursday morning. Draft preparations generally get complicated a day or two before the actual picking starts. “You hear a lot of different rumors, some good and some bad, about some of the boys you plan to draft. Some of the rumors (as to their ability and availability) are true and some are false. All of these angles must be figured into our final selections.”…Ronzani has been mum on his top choices – names and positions – although he feels that the club needed help at the halfback spots last year. This, oddly enough, seems to fit into the general opinion that the No. 1 choice or bonus pick will be halfback Billy Vessels, the Oklahoma star. Teams in need of quarterbacks may pick Jack Scarbath, Maryland’s fine signal caller and passer. The college crop from 1952 is considered “thin” by comparison to 1951, when there were highly publicized and talented boys in each offensive and defensive position. That situation, plus the fact that the Packers drafted early, helped the Packers to their best draft in history. Eight of their selections, headed by quarterback Babe Parilli, made the club. The Packers will draw sixth this year. They alternated between second and third with the Chicago Cardinals last year…Asked about his assistants for 1953, Ronzani said: “At the moment, I’ve got to devote full time to players and the matter of adding a coach will have to be put off until after the draft meeting.” The coaching staff, not counting Stydahar – a former Chicago Bear tackle, presently has three members – Ronzani, McLean and Drulis. Definitely not returning in 1953 are line coach Tarz Taylor and end-defense coach Dick Plasman. Taylor handled the line along with Drulis while Plasman handled the telephones in the pressbox during games in addition to his coaching duties.\n\nPEACEFUL DRAFT TO OPEN HOT NATIONAL GRID MEETING\n\nJAN 21 (Philadelphia) - The lull before the NFL storm is scheduled to start here about 10 o’clock Thursday morning, Green Bay time. The peace and quiet represents the league’s 18th annual draft of college football players – an eight-hour procedure in which the 12 clubs will select a total of 361 players. Other than a few “oh fudges” and “darns” when one of their prospective stars is selected by some other team, the participating coaches will be a picture of bliss personified under the watchful eye of the master himself – Commissioner Bert Bell. Just before the main draft at the Bellevue-Stratford hotel, the Packers will try for their biggest stroke of luck in history – wining the bonus pick. The Packers are one of six clubs still eligible to select numbers out of a hat. The other five are the Chicago Cardinals, San Francisco, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Baltimore. Based on their finish last year, the Packers will draw sixth behind Baltimore, Washington, Pittsburgh and Chicago Bears and Cardinals. The bonus winning coach can take his pick of any collegian in the country, and the experts are certain the young man will be Billy Vessels of Oklahoma – the halfback who sparked Oklahoma’s great machine…While the coaches are stocking up on meal tickets, club officials likely will be sharpening their swords for all sorts of battles, expected to start officially sometime Thursday night. At least five different phases of business will form the basis for heated discussion, and, Mr. Bell hopes, some definite action. They are economy, conference alignment, game schedule, new playing rules and television. For the past six weeks, Commissioner Bell has expressed concern over the fact that only four or five teams make a decent profit and the rest struggle for survival. This has been the rule rather than the exception in the last 10 years. As an economy step, Bell hopes that the clubs will reduce the player limit from 33 to 30, thus cutting the overhead down to the tune of three players’ salaries – a total saving of approximately $14,000. Bell has indicated that he doesn’t favor cutting salaries, but he will ask clubs to level off salaries gradually and pay players what they are worth…The biggest beef on cutting the player limit is expected to come from the coaches who face the prospect of talking economy-minded club officials into keeping those extra three. Officers of most of the Eastern teams, with the exception of Cleveland, appear to be dead set on economizing via the lower limit. Packer head coach Gene Ronzani feels that reducing the limit will “help the Packers considerably from a strengthening standpoint.” In other words, a three-deep powerhouse like Detroit would have to cut three good players loose from its roster, thus making them available to the less fortunate. Most coaches, however, including Ronzani, also like to have 33 on the bench for the purpose of working a more versatile offense and defense. But the consensus here seems to be that playing rosters are almost certain to be cut from 33 to 30, although a stiff battle is expected…The rhubarb over conference alignment will develop when the clubs try to decide the future division home of the new Baltimore franchise, formerly the Dallas Texans of the National conference. George Marshall, owner of Washington, wants Baltimore in the American (Eastern) conference, which would mean moving the Chicago Cardinals, the only western team in the eastern loop, to the National. However, Managing Director Walter Wolfner of the Cards doesn’t want to leave the AC. Pittsburgh owner Art Rooney says he’d like to get into what he calls the “more lucrative” National conference…On the matter of rules, Bell once again will try to get the extra point eliminated and to have all league games played to a “sudden death” in event of a tie. Bell has been trying for years to cut out the extra point and coaches will discuss it at their rules meeting tonight. Bell’s proposal is based on the grounds that sometimes the contesting teams score the same number of touchdowns, which is a team effort, and then one team wins because of an extra point conversion. Bell contends that if they score the same number of touchdowns, they should keep on playing until one of the teams scores again or kicks a field goal. Bell also will recommend that, once an offensive player is tackles by the defense, he cannot get up and run again. He can get up if slips, but not if contact has been made with a defensive man. This is designed to prevent injuries in pileups. A number of coaches, including Ronzani, are in favor of a limited time penalty for disqualified players. Under the present rule, a player can be thrown out at any stage and he’s done for the day. Some of the coaches and owners would like to modify this to resemble the hockey rule which penalizes a player for seven or 10 minutes…The television situation will be discussed in detail since the government’s anti-trust suit against the league opens in U.S. district court Monday. The result could have a drastic effect on the league because TV money helps to pay big salaries. Still another point to be discussed will be a suggestion by Bell that guarantees be reduced from $20,000 to $15,000 in intra-conference games. The commissioner would maintain the $20,000 guarantee for inter-conference games. One owner reportedly wants to raise the guarantees.\n\nHERE'S WHY THE PACKERS NEED SOME HALFBACKS FROM NL DRAFT\n\nJAN 21 (Philadelphia) - Do the Packers need halfbacks? Look! Our HBs of 1952, and bless their blessed courage, picked up a total of 410 yards by rushing last fall. Tony Canadeo gained almost three times that much alone in 1949, so you can see that the 410 is abnormally low. A better comparison can be made by “matching” the Packer halfback total with that of the world champion Detroit Lions. The Detroit HBs gained, and hold your hat, a total of 1,007 – 476 from the left side and 531 from the right. That a total difference of 597 yards. Come to think of it, how did we ever win six games?! The Packers’ left halfbacks averaged an even 3.0 yards per try; the right halfbacks 2.9. Detroit’s lefties averaged 4.5, the righties 4.2. The Lion figures show exactly why there are in the market for a fullback. Their FBs, mostly Pat Harder, gained 270 yards for an average of 3.8. Maybe Mr. Harder is getting near the end of the line. The two clubs, for further backfield comparison, were about even at quarterback rushing. Babe Parilli and Tobin Rote gained 429 yards, an average of 4.7, while Detroit’s Bobby Layne and helper Jim Hardy piled up 422 – an average of 4.4. Thus getting back to the halfback figures, it is logical to assume that Packer coach Gene Ronzani might pick a halfback or 10. The best guess is that he’ll nab Billy Vessels of Oklahoma if he wins the bonus pick. If somebody else gets all the luck, Ronzani will have to wait until six players have been chosen (the bonus and the five clubs preceding the Bays) and Vessels will certainly be on somebody else’s roster by that time. Ronzani is faced with several problems – other than the natural halfback thing. What about Parilli? Is he due to be called before next season? If Ronzani feels that the boy might be lost, he may find it necessary to draft a quarterback early, thus putting off a halfback until the second round. How about a fullback? Fred Cone says he’s retiring and Bill Reichardt is already in service. Ronzani, of course, is armed with all sorts of possibilities. For instance, he may enter his first pick with the leading “name” backs already gone, but at his disposal might be a great linebacker or tackles – such as Donn Moomaw and Dick Modzelewski, respectively. Such stars, even though they don’t represent the top needs, would be welcome additions. Other than halfbacks and possibly a fullback, the Packers’ top need is an offensive center to fill the shoes of Jay Rhodemyre, who probably won’t return in ’53. Ronzani will be looking for a center who can also work as a linebacker, thus permitting him to carry an extra tackle or back. That, incidentally, will be a must if the league cuts the player limit from 33 to 30. After center, Ronzani will be looking for some big guards and defensive halfbacks. He has a nucleus of a sound tackle corps, what with Jack Morgan of Michigan State and Chuck LaPradd of Florida due to report next fall. They were selected for ’53 delivery a year ago. Ronzani’s main hope is to get “good football players who want to play the game – all the way.” If he managed eight out of the 30 he picks tomorrow (not counting the bonus?), he’ll consider himself extremely lucky!\n\nCARMICHAEL, REICH, FORESTER FIRST PACKER DRAFT PICKS\n\nJAN 22 (Green Bay) - Diehard University of Wisconsin followers may regard it as traitorous but the Green Bay Packers today selected Al Carmichael, the man who beat the Badgers in the Rose Bowl game New Year’s day, as their No. 1 choice in the NFL’s 1953 college draft here. Carmichael, six feet and 185 pounds, caught the pass from reserve tailback Rudy Bukich that produced the game’s only touchdown as Southern Cal defeated Wisconsin, 7-0, in the Tournament of Roses classic. Packer Head Coach Gene Ronzani, who indicated before leaving for the NFL meeting that halfbacks would be top priority in his selections, picked another in his second choice. He drafted Gil Reich, the all-around back from the University of Kansas who came to the Jayhawks after being dismissed from West Point during the cribbing scandal there two years ago. Bill Forester, versatile Southern Methodist tackle, was the Packers’ third choice. Forester, who plays both offense and defense with equal facility, stands 6-foot, 1-inch and weighs 230 pounds…Ronzani continued his quest for halfbacks in making his fourth selection. He picked Gib Dawson, mercurial Texas runner who does the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds. Dawson, 5-11 and 175 pounds, led the Southwest conference in scoring last season with 71 points. In addition to running, he passes well and kicks extra points. Roger Zatkoff, topflight Michigan linebacker, was the fifth choice. He stands 6-1, carries 210 pounds. A homegrown Wisconsin product, Bob Kennedy of the Big Ten co-champion Badgers, was No. 6. The stocky guard – he stacks 222 pounds on a 5-11 frame – is a native of Rhinelander. Kennedy played in Green Bay’s first North-South all state high school classic under West High’s Frosty Ferzacca in 1949…San Francisco’s Forty-Niners won the league’s annual guessing game – the bonus pick - but it is not likely to be of immediate help to them. They chose Harry Babcock, an offensive end from the University of Georgia, who reportedly is also highly talented in baseball and probably will turn to that professionally. As expected, Oklahoma’s Billy Vessels was grabbed off in the first round. The spectacular climax runner was picked by the league’s new-old entry, Baltimore. This came as something of a surprise since the Colts, badly in need of quarterbacks, passed up one of the nation’s No. 1 field generals and one who undoubtedly would have helped them at the gate – Maryland’s Jack Scarbath. Scarbath shortly was snapped up, however, by Head Coach E.L. (Curly) Lambeau of the Redskins to help fill the void left by the departure of Slingin’ Sammy Baugh, who retired in December after a 16-year career. Johnny Olszewski, California’s All-America fullback, was tabbed by the Chicago Cardinals, and another Pacific coast standout, linebacker Donn Moomaw of UCLA, went to the Philadelphia Eagles. But he immediately became the property of the Los Angeles Rams, who obtained the rights to the Eagles’ first draft choice via the trade of Bobby Thomason to Philadelphia last year…Carmichael’s service status makes his selection doubly valuable to the Packers. Al, 24, served in the Marine corps during World War II and was named to the all-Marine eleven in 1945. Considered a good running halfback off the T-formation, Carmichael was an All-American junior college selection while at Santa Ana, Calif. Known, inevitably, as Hoagy, Al carried 68 times for 268 yards, an average of nearly four yards per try, as the Trojans drove to nine victories in 10 games last autumn. He is a native of Inglewood, Calif. Reich, 6 feet and 190 pounds, probably was one of the most accomplished backs in the collegiate ranks in 1952. Gil, who understudied Bob Blaik at West Point before the cribbing scandal broke, is an exceptional punter, an outstanding runner and an able long passer in addition to being a skilled defensive halfback. He was a rarity – a 60-minute player – for the Jayhawks…The league’s rules committee Wednesday night rejected all proposed code changes, leaving the NFL mode of play intact. Rejected by the committee were such proposals as: a “sudden death” playoff for any league game ending in a tie, a seven-point after touchdown eliminated, and short-time penalties for players charged with unnecessary roughness instead of banishment from the game. Commissioner Bert Bell gave out figures Wednesday to show that 1952 was the league’s most successful season. Total attendance for 72 regular season games drew 2,052,126 customers and the National conference and league championship playoffs attracted 97,507 more. That was an 8.6 percent jump over 1951. There’s a spot open in the National, or Western, conference, vacated by the defunct Dallas Texans. Big George Marshall, the influential boss of the Washington Redskins, wants Baltimore in the American conference to promote a natural rivalry against his club. And the new Baltimore owners would like to avoid the expensive trips to the West Coast. They already have put out $200,000 of the franchise and their choice of a rather nondescript lot of players on the league reserve list. That would mean shifting the Chicago Cardinals to the West, a move which would meet with resistance. There also is a proposal for an entirely new divisional alignment, dropping the present conference names…In spite of the apparent prosperity, Bell expressed deep concern over the “gamble” taken by the league’s second division clubs. They’re gambling on the weather and breaks to make a few thousand dollars against possible losses of $100,000 or more, Bell argued. “I’m interested in reaching the stage where there aren’t four or five or six clubs that can lose $100,000,” he said, “and to get there it has to be a business operation right down to the ground.” Bell had a sample of what can happen last fall, when the\n\nleague had to take over the operation of the Dallas club in midseason and lost $69,200 operating it to finish. Outside of cutting the player limit from 33 to 30 players per team, which Bell estimates would have each club $20,000 to $25,000, the commissioner’s only suggested economies were riding in day coaches on occasion instead of chartered planes; stopping at less expensive hotels and refraining from paying huge salaries to untried college players.\n\nNFL'S EASTERN CLUBS CASTING FOND GLANCES AT WESTERN HALF\n\nJAN 22 (Philadelphia) - Most of the money in the world is supposed to be located in the east, but you’d never guess it by the talk at the NFL meeting here. It develops that the “big dough” is out west – in the league, you understand. That’s the consensus of such experts as Pete the Bellhop, the eastern writers and, of course, the owners of teams in the east. The Eastern clubs are tossing loving glance at those in the West. They’re interested in those big gates Los Angeles, Detroit, San Francisco and the Bears have been drawing – not to mention the standard guarantee-plus from the Green Bay Packers. They’ve noticed that the West has started to corner championships – Los Angeles and Detroit in the last two years. They’ve noticed that the West has the big color boys, the gate attractions in such as Elroy Hirsch, Bobby Layne, Leon Hart, Bill Howton, Babe Parilli, Hugh McElhenny – to mention a few. They’ve noticed that their trump card, the Cleveland Browns, are starting to get a bit rusty; that the big-city New York Giants are not packing the Polo Grounds; that their all-time, all-timer, Sammy Baugh, no longer will pull customers in (because he’s retired); and that one of their members, the Pittsburgh Steelers, has publicly stated that it wants to play in the same conference with the money bags of the west. Pittsburgh represents the biggest noise in the Eastern loop. The Steelers’ 63 to 7 whacking of the Giants put their club in the high-scoring Western bracket. And just to prove that they can pull in fans, the Steelers played before nearly 70,000 in Los Angeles in their 1952 finale. Art Rooney, owner of the Steelers who knows the value of a dollar, says he almost broke even for the season on that final game along. He’d like more of the same. Thus, he has told the powers that be that he’d like to go West and let Baltimore in the East. It is doubtful, however, if the league would permit the removal of Pittsburgh from the Eastern sector. The Steeler might be just the shot in the arm the East needs since Cleveland and New York have dominated the scene in the last three years. Pitt lost two games to Cleveland by a total of two points last fall, indicating that the young Steelers are on their way up. Regardless of the positions of Baltimore and Pittsburgh, it appears that the Western teams are in for a long reign. Detroit, largely a gang of kids with the exception of fullback Pat Harder and a few linemen, is an automatic favorite to repeat. LA and SF are on the verge of titledom and the Packers are definitely on the way up. The Bears will have tough sledding unless they can find a quarterback. The sixth team? It will be one of these three – Baltimore, Chicago’s Cardinals or Pittsburgh. Coach Paul Brown of Cleveland has stated that he will lead a battle, due tonight or Friday morning, for a realignment of teams. He said recently, “I’ve been in the league for three years and I still don’t know whether I’m in the American conference or the National. Why not call them East or West and arrange for teams that way? You’ll have at least some logical rivalry.”\n\nBLOOD RESIGNS AS ST. JOHN COACH\n\nJAN 22 (Collegeville, MN) – Johnny Blood, onetime Green Bay Packer great and one of the most colorful players in the game in in his 15-year career in the NFL, resigned as head coach of St. John’s college here Tuesday, effective June 1. Blood’s teams won 13 games and lost nine over a three-year span. He said he probably would go into business. The pro gird immortal played with the Packers’ first three world championship teams in 1929-30-31 and was with them when they gained a fourth title in 1936.\n\nPACK EMERGES FROM DRAFT WITH POTENTIAL SUPER POWER AT HALVES\n\nJAN 23 (Philadelphia) - The Green Bay Packers emerged from the first no-glamour draft in the history of the NFL here today with potential super power at halfback – a non-productive position last year – and all-around additional strength from tackle to tackle. Packer head coach Gene Ronzani, determined to toughen all 1952 weak spots, selected 12 halfbacks and 11 combination guards-tackles. The remaining seven players included three centers, three ends and one fullback. Six of the 30 Packer selections were juniors, which means that they may not play pro ball until 1954, as the Packers, like the 11 other clubs, quickly recognized as the 1952 crop as the leanest in years. After Billy Vessels went early, there wasn’t a big-shot glamour All-American the likes of Babe Parilli, Bill Howton or Hugh McElhenny left in the pile…GOES INTO LATE HOURS: Ronzani, fairly well melted down when the picking ended early today, figured that “we strengthened up where we needed it the most – at halfback and in the line.” Chicago Bear coach George Halas remarked that the Packer draft was “the best balance you’ve had in years.” With two exceptions, the Packers stuck to the big schools, the only small college fellers being speed halfback Jim Philbee of Bradley, the 18th choice, and defensive end Bill Murray of American International college. Ronzani didn’t wait to signal his intentions, selecting all-around halfback Al Carmichael of Southern California first and then following with another halfback, Reich of Kansas, in the No. 2 spot. He nabbed Southern Methodist’s George Connor-like Bill Forester No. 3, and then grabbed another halfback, Gib Dawson of Texas…The Packers’ main hope for 1953 rests with the first 10 choices. The next four are highly-prized juniors and won’t be available until 1954. The next 16 represent a “hopeful” cross-section of the Packers’ needs plus “a sleeper or two”, and Ronzani believes that considerable strength can be expected from this group in 1953, although two are juniors. In all, the pre-draft excitement about halfbacks, the valuable position of middle guard to be vacated by 11-year veteran Ray Bray has been overlooked. However, it appears that Ronzani came up with a similar-sized replacement for Bray in Wisconsin’s Bob Kennedy, who measures almost even with Bray at 5-11, 225…COMES FROM RHINELANDER: Kennedy is the Bray-type guard Ronzani has been looking for. The former all-state guard from Rhinelander High is a mean cuss on defense and effective on offense. Badger coach Ivy Williamson says Kennedy has the fastest charge of any guard he ever coached. Other linemen among the first 10 includes a reversible guard-tackle in Vic Rymkus of Holy Cross, who carries 220 – ideal for guard in the pros; 240-pound tackle Floyd Harrawood of Tulsa; Jim Ringo, a 225-pounder from Syracuse; linebacker-tackle Roger Zatkoff of Michigan; and Forester…Forester actually played three positions in college – offensive halfback, defensive tackle and linebacker. Zatkoff made the All-Players No. 2 All-America as a linebacker – the position that seems to best fit his weight, 210 pounds. Ringo, the leading offensive center in the east, is expected to fill the empty shoes of veteran Jay Rhodemyre, who isn’t expected back next fall. Only one of the halfbacks is a light scatster – Dawson, who measures 5-11 and 175 – while the rest of them range from 185 pounds on up. Dawson is the closest thing to Doak Walker turned out in Texas. He does about everything, makes good use of his speed, 9.6 in the century, on both defense and offense and kicks extra points and field goals. He booted 26 out of 28 PATs and three FGs and averaged five yards rushing last fall…BUILT LIKE CANADEO: The one-two boys, Carmichael and Reich, both are constructed along the Canadeo lines – six feet even and close to 190 pounds. Carmichael, 24, is safe from military service, having served and played football with the Marines. Kansas’ Reich, on the other hand, stands a chance of becoming eligible for another season. The Big Seven will rule on the former Army star’s eligibility next month. The fourth halfback among the first 10 selections, Georgia’s Lauren Hargrove, had a terrific year as a junior. The lanky 193-pounder who runs the 100 in 9.8 sprained his ankle early in his senior year and saw little action…The Packers drafted just one fullback – 218-pound John Hlay of Ohio State. Some of the halfbacks are big enough to crash from the FB spot. Hlay also works as a linebacker. Ronzani provided some history by not drafting a quarterback, which, of course, is an indication that he expects both Tobin Rote and Parilli to return to the pitching hill next fall. However, it can be pointed out that Reich played considerable QB under Bob Blaik before the cribbing scandal at Army. He continued to work some at that position at Kansas. While the main strength is based among the first 10 picks, the remaining “availables” for 1953 are all interesting specimens. Philbee is a hurdler and reached the finals of the Olympics tryouts. Bill Turnbeaugh of Auburn, who packs 265 pounds, is the famous near-sighted tackle known was Earthquake Tremble; tackle Jim Haslam was Tennessee’s regular offensive tackle for three straight years and captained the club as a senior; Ike Jones, the Negro offensive end from UCLA, runs the 100 in 9.9; and Zach Taylor, the back from Colorado, led the nation in punting as a sophomore and then ranked second as a junior and senior. Haslam, who packs only 210 pounds, will be shifted to guard…MIDDLE GUARD PROSPECTS: Besides Kennedy as a middle guard prospect, the Packers drafted 240-pund Henry O’Brien of Boston college in the 29th round for that position. He was recommended by BC coach Mike Holovak, the former Bear. Ward Cuff, former Giants, Cardinal and Packers, recommended the Packers’ 30th choice, 222-pound Al Barry, guard from USC. Mike Michalske suggested several Packer picks, including 215-pound center Jim McConaughey of Houtson and Bill Lucky, Baylor tackle. Mike formerly coaches at Baylor, leaving recently. Ronzani and his assistants were extremely careful in getting swift halfbacks with some weight. Dawson likely will be battling with returning Larry Coutre for what may develop into the \"one\" scatback job. While the name of the six juniors were just names at this stage of the game, Ronzani pointed out that \"you can add those three from last year to the possibilities for next year.\" He was referring to tackles Chuck LaPradd of Florida and Jack Morgan of Michigan State and halfback Billy Hair, who were drafted in '51 for '53 use. Thus, with today's tackle-guard crop, the Packers have a total of 14 big boys up front to draw from. All of the juniors picked last night are being groomed for All-America honors. Halfback Joe Johnson of Boston college, picked No. 11, is considered \"out of this world out east.\" Two of them are big tackles - 250-pound Chuck Wrenn of TCU and 230-pound Bill Lucky, who got his early grid schooling under Michalske at Baylor. The others are halfback George Bozanic of Southern Cal, center Bob Orders of West Virginia, a former Army star, and halfback Dick Curran of Arizona State at Tempe. All of the clubs went wild picking juniors and, in some cases, sophomores who were eligible because their classes already had graduated. Something like 80 juniors were picked and 20 sophomores. The unusual picks were mostly the result of athletes entering school for a season and then going in the Army. By the time some of them get out, their classes were about to graduate...The peaceful operation of making a bonus choice and drafting college player out of the way, NFL owners rolled up their sleeves today and prepared for their customary knockdown, dragout fight over organizational problems. When Bert Bell called the annual meeting to order for its second session, four items are certain to be brought front and center: 1. A proposal to lower the player limit from 33 to 30. 2. Placing of Baltimore in one of the league's two divisions. 3. The 1953 schedule. 4. Raising or lowering the guarantees to visiting teams...Each problem has plenty of pros and cons among the owners and squabbles appear inevitable. Only one thing seems certain. It takes 10 votes out of 12 to pass on an issue. The usual procedure in this league is for the owners to spend hours arguing and then give up and ask Commissioner Bell to solve the matter. It wouldn't surprise anyone if Bell had the final say on everything. The proposal to lower the player limit has the support of the commissioner, some of the owners and none of the coaches. The idea is to cut about $15,000 to $20,000 off the salary department. Bell has recommended economy all the way down the line to lessen the risk of big losses for the losing clubs. The job of placing Baltimore in one of the two conferences is sure to provide a floor fight. Bell says Baltimore has replaced Dallas in the National conference, which includes most of the western teams on a geographical basis. Don Kellett, general manager of the new Baltimore team, says he doesn't care where his team operates. Some of the other owners do care...George Marshall of the Washington Redskins wants Baltimore in the American conference, or eastern sector of the league. He wants to play Baltimore twice a season to build up what Marshall claims is a natural rivalry between the two teams which operate 30 miles apart. Marshall would send the Chicago Cardinals from the American to the National conference where he insists they belong. Art Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, says he'll be glad to go into the National conference and let Baltimore have his American spot. You would think that makes everything east with Baltimore not caring where it plays and Pittsburgh quite willing to switch. But enter the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles, while not making any official statement, are reported to oppose the moving of Pittsburgh. The Eagles, it is said, feel that they went along playing the Steelers twice a year when the Pittsburgh entry was in bad shape. Now that the Steelers have a pretty good club, the Eagles can see some pretty good gates for battles with their intrastate rivals. Rooney would solve the whole thing by having the league play a round robin schedule which means that fans in each league city would get to see every team in the NFL over a two-year period. He doubts his round-robin idea will get the first base, though...If a group represented by sports promoter Abe Saperstein makes a deal for the San Francisco 49ers, Nate Dolin of the Cleveland Indians would be willing to take a \"small\" share, the latter said in Cleveland Thursday. Dolin is director of stadium operations and a major shareholder in the Indians. Saperstein, who has the Harlem Globetrotters, makes his headquarters in Chicago. They and Franklin (Whitey) Lewis, sports editor of the Cleveland Press, left San Francisco Wednesday night amid reports they were negotiating to buy the National league professional football club. Dolin related that he met Saperstein in San Francisco on \"personal business\", heard the club was for sale, and suggested a call to Tony Morabito, co-owner. He said he mentioned \"what I though the club was worth\", but that Morabito replied he \"never would sell at that figure.\" Morabito had a heart attack last spring and was advised by doctors to sell the club. He and his brother Victor own it. Tony Morabito's version of the incident was that the three men negotiated for a sale. There were reports the price was around $400,000 to $450,000.\n\nBULLETIN\n\nJAN 23 (Philadelphia) - Baltimore, which has replaced the defunct Dallas Texans, will play in the NFL’s National conference in 1953, a reliable source told the Press-Gazette here at noon today. No vote has been taken but the sentiment has been in favor of such an experiment for one year “rather than making any changes at this time,” the informant explained. It was expected, however, that the plan would meet with considerable opposition at this afternoon’s session.\n\nREICH, PACKER DRAFTEE, IS ONE-MAN BACKFIELD\n\nJAN 23 (Lawrence, KS) - The Green Bay Packers could have picked a football player who can do one or two things better than Kansas university’s multi-faceted Gilbert (Gibby) Reich, but they’d look far and long for a back who can do as many things as well as the 6-0, 190 pound Steelton, Pa., product. The specialty – if he has one – of the No. 2 1952 draft choice for Coach Gene Ronzani’s Pack is defense. But don’t bet he can’t do something until he’s been given a thorough trial. You’ll probably lose your money. Furthermore, the poised, raven-haired, dark-complexioned Steelton Stiletto is interested in pro football. That’s despite the fact the onetime West Pointer is a dandy baseball prospect and currently is a starting guard with the surprising K.U. basketball team. Army’s loss was one of the biggest athletic gains in the history of the Jayhawker institution. Gil, whose impromptu comments make one suspect he’s reading from a prepared script, was one of the cadets who got the ill-aimed boot during the cribbing scandal. As a Point sophomore, he was No. 1 defensive safety for the 1950 Red Blaik eleven that fell only to Navy. Gil came up from the plebe team that season – along with boys like Gene Filipski, J.D. Kimmel and Bill Rowekamp – with a whale of a reputation as an offensive quarterback. But the man-under post was bring handled capably by Blaik’s son, Bobby. Gil, however, was slated to take over after Bob left and played some offense, connecting for touchdowns on the only four passes he threw in competition. Realizing that the boy was too good to be kept on the bench, Coach Blaik utilized his tremendous ability at safety. The Big Seven moguls allowed Reich and other Army men transferring to league schools only one year of eligibility after the customary one-year residence. But although this is Gibby’s first and last year as a Mr. Oread athlete, he’s already stamped himself as one of the school’s all-time greats both in football and basketball. His baseball ability – he’s an outfielder – will be known this spring. Folks at Kansas who’d heard of Gil realized they were getting something dandy when Reich, a close friend of Warren Woody, well-known Chicago insurance man and rabid K.U. alumnus and former athlete, announced he had chosen the Lawrence institution. He enrolled in civil engineering and currently is maintaining a B average in the tough subjects such an interest requires. He’d like to work for a large engineering firm once he gets his degree. There are a couple of question marks overhanging the boy’s availability to the Packers. He has more schooling after this year, although he’s listed as a senior. Most K.U. engineering courses take 4 ½ or five years and he needs another semester next fall. Then, too, Gil is a member of school’s Air Force ROTC unit and upon completion of his studies and the reception of his reserve second lieutenant commission, he owes the Air Force two years of his time. By the way, the boy’s as outstanding military as he is in everything else. Gil was selected the No. 1 cadet during his short tour of active duty training at a big eastern AF base last summer. At home in any crowd, Reich is a favorite wherever he goes. He’s clever but not overbearing, reserved but not shy. He has that rare ability to make acquaintances and teammates listen – and then follow. Those in a position to know term him one of the greatest natural leaders and organizers they’ve ever encountered. But on with Reich, the football player who might come to Green Bay. As we’ve said, Gil’s admitted forte is defense. He was top defensive left half with a Kansas team which, though riddled with injuries, mounted with an impressive 7-3 record. You can name at least three of those seven victories that were salvaged simply because Reich’s sure, dead-aim tackling – the kind with the shoulder in it – saved tying or winning enemy scores. Not a blazing runner, he is far faster than average, has a great change of pace, is a clever mover and hit with the power of a fullback if he happens to be carrying the ball. The “defensive” player went nearly 55 minutes in the season opener against Texas Christian, passing for both touchdowns as the Jayhawks notched an impressive triumph. His defensive pyrotechnics were instrumental in victory which saw the score-happy Horned Frogs blanked for the first time in over 50 games. When the Oklahoma game rolled around and the K.U. fullback corps was repleted by wounds, Coach Jules Sikes moved Reich into the fullback spot with only a week’s work. From that midpoint in the backline of the K.U. T-formation, Gil ran and passed lethally until knocked out and benched in the second half. In the last game of the year against Missouri, the versatile gridder took over the left half spot vacated by the great by injured Charlie Hoag. Again Gil was hurt, suffering a broken finger, and again his team lost – this time 19-20 after his running, passing, blocking and defending were gone. A good idea of Reich’s ability can be gained from a glance at a few statistics. Gil was considered good enough by the Football Writers of America to be placed at a first string halfback post on the Look All-American defensive team. He was a unanimous choice for every all-conference aggregation. Gil completed 19 of 43 passes as a quarterback-fullback-halfback for 238 yards (six of them going for touchdowns) and rushed for over 250 yards and three touchdowns from three spots; did most of the team punting, getting off 29 for 297 aces, an average of 35.6; returned 19 enemy punts for 327 yards, over a 17-yard average; took up extra-point kicking when the team’s regular converter was put out at midseason, averaged a pass interception a game as a defender. Coach Sikes considers Reich one of the best all-around backs he’s ever handled or seen and calls him “a mighty terrific pro prospect” because of his amazing versatility. The NCAA’s change from the platoon style of football wouldn’t have affected Gil a bit. One of the shortest and most emphatic of the many compliments the incredible Steelton boy garnered this year came from T.C.U. boss Dutch Meyer, after Gil has led the Jays to victory over the Frogs. Dutch said: “Reich – Well, just say he’s the heart of a Kansas team – a kid who gives this club poise and purpose, offensively and defensively.” There are those who’ll say all this is a fairy tale, that all this can’t be true of one boy. Our reply: You just haven’t met or watched Gil Reich, Green Bay prospect deluxe.\n\nPACK TO PLAY NON-LOOPER WITH BROWNS IN CLEVELAND, REPORT\n\nJAN 23 (Philadelphia) - The Packers will play the Browns in a non-conference game in Cleveland early in September – probably on a Friday night, it has been reported hereabouts. Thus, the two clubs will exchange history-making non-loopers, having started the series in Green Bay last year. And speaking of non-wheelers, an appearance by Curly Lambeau and his Washington Redskins in Green Bay would provide an interesting contest. Nobody seems to be able to figure out why Baltimore didn’t draft home-state quarterback Jack Scarbath first instead of Billy Vessels – unless Baltimore coach Keith Molesworth is fixin’ to deal with the Browns for George Ratterman, the skilled quarterback who played little last year behind Otto Graham. In first 10 rounds, a total of 14 Big Ten players were selected – four by the Browns. The first to get called was end Bernie Flowers of Purdue, who was picked by Baltimore in the second round. The first player from Wisconsin’s Rose Bowl team chosen was guard Bob Kennedy, who was picked by the Packers in the sixth round. There wasn’t a Notre Dame player selected in the first 15 rounds. As predicted, the first meeting day, confined solely to the draft, was unusually quiet. Nobody even would guess a fight for today. Asked if he expected a big rhubarb over the conference issue, Commissioner Bert Bell just shrugged his shoulder and said “Naw.” Bell had to make one touchy ruling during the draft. The Bears picked halfback Billy Anderson, son of Rochester, the radio comedian, in the first round and the Browns promptly announced that they already had him under contract. Bell said Anderson was not eligible at the time he signed. Redskin mentor Lambeau said John Martinkovic never would have left Washington had he been around when the deal was made two years ago. Big John came to the Packers for the rights to Ted Cook. Lambeau, incidentally, sat near the Packer table in the drafting room. He told the Packer group that “your Carmichael is one of the greatest backs in the country.” The Packers had hoped to draft Dave Suminski, the Wisconsin tackle, on the 15th round, but Washington grabbed him three notches ahead of the Bays. The experts in the halls claim that Packers’ Gil Reich is the equal of Glenn Davis, the Army immortal. Los Angeles, dead set on tightening its defense, for the second successive year gains an All-America linebacker. The took Donn Moomaw of UCLA from the Philadelphia Eagles for the final payment in the Bobby Thomason deal. A year ago, the Rams “bought” Les Richter, the other LBing great, from Dallas for 11 players. Richter won’t be available until 1954. Earl Gillespie, former WJPG sportscaster who handled the Packer broadcasts and the championship playoff last year, visited the meeting Thursday. He’s on the road doing the aircasts of the Milwaukee Hawks’ games; they played Philly here last night. Packer Tobin Rote will show Packer and championship game pictures in Texas this winter in the interests of Miller High Life. The “rich get richer” is the way most people looked on the trade that send reserve quarterback-end Tom Dublinski of Detroit to Baltimore for veteran fullback Dick Hoerner. Dick is just what Detroit’s Pat Harder needs, although Hoerner is 30 years of age. The Packers had seven representatives sitting in on the long draft meeting – President Emil R. Fischer, board chairman Lee Joannes, coaches Gene Ronzani, Ray McLean and Chuck Drulis, administrative aide Joe Stydahar and scout Jack Vainisi. The draft finished up at 1 o’clock this morning.\n\n5 NON-LOOP GAMES APPROVED BY PROS\n\nJAN 24 (Philadelphia) - Can you imagine the Packers and Bears playing a non-conference games - an exhibition! This is possible, and highly probable, under the NFL's new non-league rule adopted unanimously at the circuit's meeting early today. The rule states that each club must play five non-conference games with teams of its opposite conference. Then, if the club so desires, it can play additional game, normally only one, with a team in its own division. The game within the conference may be played first - so long as five across-the-loop tilts are scheduled. Thus, the Packers could battle the Bears or other National conference teams in Milwaukee, for instance, or Minneapolis or anywhere for that matter. What effect a P-B non-looper would have on the Packer-Bear league doubleheader is something else again. Officials here believe that it might require considerable study. The new rule also relieves considerable difficulty in scheduling teams for the Packers' successful big three non-league games in Green Bay, Minneapolis and Milwaukee. The Packers already have one non-wheeler in Cleveland set and arrangements for the big trio are now being made, with the possibility that Curly Lambeau might invade Green Bay with his Washington Redskins - something of a natural to say the least. The non-conference law ended Friday's do-nothing meeting on something of a successful note...Earlier in the evening, the clubs booted by an unknown vote an opportunity to cut rosters and (1) thus save approximately $20,000 per season per club and (2) provide for a well-balanced league. Commissioner Bert Bell, concerned for months over the financial condition of some of the teams, stormed out of the meeting rooms at the Hotel Bellevue-Stratford late last night and frankly admitted to the press that \"they did nothing.\" In short, the league refused to reduce rosters from 33 to 30 players and put out the abused injured-player reserve list - both proposals being made by Mr. Bell. Another plan, presented by the New York Giants, called for 35 players for the league opener, 33 for the remainder and no injured-player list. This, too, was killed. Under the present 33-player and reserve plan, clubs carried - and paid for - as many as 40 players. Bell wanted to cut each club to a flat 30 with no injury tomfoolery. His intention, besides saving each club some money, was to help the weaker clubs in player personnel. At the start of next season - if the 30-player thing has been adopted - a total of 36 players would be released, including at least 15 to 20 top-notchers from the \"rich\" clubs...But the 12 teams decided to go along and let the rich get richer in player talent. Actually, each club can save money by cutting its roster below 33 (the league bottom by law is 25), but an undermanned team isn't going far up in the standings. Bell's plan is to make each team on a par. He and the club officials had a good example in the Western division where four of the five clubs were about on a par for the first nine games. As a result, Bell pointed out, the six clubs in the Western loop drew - and get this - $600,000 more than the six teams in the Eastern circuit last fall. Oddly enough, the weaker clubs weren't all in favor of the 30-player program. Bell put it this way: \"I was astonished to see that all of the weaker teams did not favor the 30 players.\" The commissioner seemed puzzled and furious - all at the same time. But he hadn't lost his wonderful sense of humor. A moment later, the writers, looking for something hot, groaned when Bell announced that the clubs passed a rule requiring an ambulance to be present at all games. A writer yelled, \"Who cares\", and Bell answered: \"I'm darn sure the players care.\"...The Packers, via Emil R. Fischer, board chairman Lee Joannes and Coach Gene Ronzani, were generally in favor of the 30-player limit. Bell's proposal to raise the game guarantee from $20,000 to $25,000 for league games outside a team's conference and reduce it to $15,000 for games within a conference went down the drain. Edwin J. Anderson, president of the Detroit Lions, told a reporter that economy measures such as cutting the squads and guarantees were not the answer to financial problems. \"The only way to operate in professional football is to sell your team to the community. You have to get the big industrial firm in back of your season ticket drive.\" The Detroit president said \"sure, there is risk in pro football. There is in any business. The idea is to circumvent that risk. Cutting squads and guarantees isn't the way to do it. The way to do it is to work hard on that season ticket angle.\" In another action, the league acted to protect a player, salarywise, who is traded from a championship team before the college All-Star game. If he is traded, he will be paid half of his All-Star game salary by his new team. The first case is Tom Dublinski of Detroit (the Lions play in the star game), who was traded to Baltimore. Dick Hoerner of the Los Angeles Rams, who was traded to Dallas a year ago, was the last player to miss out on the extra half pay. The league also decided that any player who reports and plays in Canada during any season must be cleared at a special hearing held by the league before he plays in the National league. And he must report to his NFL team before the first game; otherwise he must wait until the following year. For certain decision today was the problem of the home conference of Baltimore, which is presently in the National division. The Rams and San Francisco may not like the fact that they each must travel across country each year, meaning that a rhubarb may develop before it's settled. Pittsburgh wants to get into the money-minded NC but the other AC clubs are ready to say nix. This morning, the club officials accomplished three strokes of business. They voted to: (1) Limit player salary cuts to 10 percent. (2) Rename the National and American conferences Eastern and Western divisions. (3) Follow the present television policy in 1953. (Home team now have the right to decide whether their games will be televised.)\n\nRONZANI MAY HAVE COMPLETED PROJECT TO TOUGHEN DEFENSE\n\nJAN 24 (Philadelphia) - Packer coach Gene Ronzani's tightening-the-defense project, started a year ago with the drafting and signing of Bobby Dillon, may have been completed here. Six of the dozen \"big, fast\" halfbacks chosen are two-way backs and one in particular - Gil Reich - is a cornerstone in the keep-the-enemy-"
