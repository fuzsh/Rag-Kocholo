NEW YORK -- New York City police say a body has been found in the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir in Central Park.

Police say the decomposed body was found by a maintenance worker Tuesday afternoon on the east side of the lake near 90th Street.

It was not immediately known how long the body had been there and whether any foul play was involved.

Authorities are combing through missing persons reports as they attempt to identify the body, CBS New York reports.

The reservoir is about a half-mile long and up to 40 feet deep. It's surrounded by a running track and a 4-foot-high ornamental fence. According to the park's website, it was built as a temporary water supply for New York City in the 1860s and was decommissioned in 1993.

The city named the reservoir for the former first lady in 1994 after her death. She often strolled through the area, and The New York Times reports that the last time Onassis was seen in public was during a walk in Central Park.
