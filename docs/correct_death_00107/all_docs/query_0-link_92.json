        "text": "Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the former first lady who many considered the closest thing to American royalty, died Thursday night.\n\nMrs. Onassis had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system. She was 64.\n\nHer children, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and John F. Kennedy Jr. were at her bedside when she died at 10:15 p.m. Her long-time companion Maurice Tempelsman, was also there.\n\nAs recently as Sunday, Mrs. Onassis had been photographed strolling in Central Park. She entered New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center on Monday.\n\nShe returned Wednesday to her Fifth Avenue apartment.\n\n\"The disease progressed to a point where there was no more they could do,\" said her longtime friend Nancy Tuckerman. \"They reached a point whereby she could either remain in the hospital or go home.\n\n\"She chose to go home.\"\n\nIt was there that she died. A priest had administered last rites Thursday afternoon.\n\nMrs. Onassis disclosed she was suffering from cancer of the lymph nodes in February. The lymph system is responsible for processing white blood cells, which in turn bolster the body's immune system.\n\nTuckerman said funeral arrangements will be private.\n\nMrs. Onassis had made few public appearances over the last three decades. She lobbied for the preservation of New York City landmarks and promoted books as a Doubleday editor, a job she assumed after Onassis' death.\n\nShe was at Kennedy's side when he was shot to death in Dallas on Nov.\n\n22, 1963. She was the woman in the pink suit and pillbox hat, covered with blood, crawling across the trunk toward a Secret Service agent.\n\nOver the next few days, the nation's horror at the assassination turned to grief, then to admiration, for the widow's brave, lonely resolve.\n\nAsked to name her chief accomplishment, she said, \"I think it is that after going through a rather difficult time, I consider myself comparatively sane. I am proud of that.\""
