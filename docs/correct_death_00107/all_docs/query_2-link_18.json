        "text": "In 1944 Jacqueline Bouvier was sent to Miss Porter's School for Girls, a boarding school in Farmington, CT. She then attended Vassar College, starting in 1947. Jacqueline spent her junior year abroad in Paris, studying at the Sorbonne. When she returned to the United States, she graduated from George Washington University with a BA in French Literature. After college, she started working as the \"inquiring camera girl\" for the Washington-Times Herald newspaper in Washington, DC.\n\nJacqueline Bouvier first met John Kennedy in 1951. They were married on September 12, 1953 in Newport RI. It was a large wedding that was labeled the social event of the year. Well over a thousand people attended the wedding reception.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy became first lady at the age of 31. The largest task she accomplished during her tenure as First Lady was the restoration of the White House. During this time, Jacqueline Kennedy formed the White House Historical Association and the White House Fine Arts Committee, both to assist in the restoration project. Kennedy also created the position of the White House Curator and designed the book, \"The White House: An Historic Guide.\" Within six months of its publication 350,000 copies were sold. The proceeds from the book's sales went to support the White House restoration project, and the White House Historic Society.\n\nAfter President Kennedy's death, Jacqueline Kennedy remarried in 1968 to Aristotle Onassis. Onassis passed away in 1975, and Jacqueline moved back to New York City permanently. In 1975 she started her career in publishing. In 1978 she accepted a position at Doubleday as an editor. She kept this position until her death, in 1994.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis passed away on May 19, 1994 due to non-Hodgkin's lympoma."
