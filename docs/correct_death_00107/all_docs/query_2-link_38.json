        "text": "MY MOTHER NEVER LIKED Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. She thought she was “sly”—a combination, I believe, of “too big for her britches” and “foreign.” My mother loved John Fitzgerald Kennedy, “Jack,” the godlike exemplar of Irish-American, Boston-Catholic inevitability who was, oh my, just perfect. But Jacqueline Bouvier was this Frenchified whisper of a thing who was too delicate and standoffish to campaign with her Erin-go-bragh dream of a husband. Never mind that she was deep into a pregnancy; what Jack needed was a solid potato of a girl who could sprout children like tubers and get out and stump like the Gaelic queen he deserved. It was, of course, a totally unfair assessment, as I’m quite sure my mother was aware, but that was neither here nor there; the woman was sly.\n\nThe postmortem canonization of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis would have sent my now deceased Irish Catholic mother into a tizzy. I mean really—Jack’s widow, who married “that man” after her husband was killed. Then, when “that man” died and left her millions, another “that man” comes along and quintuples them. The second “that man” eventually moves in. Talk about sly!\n\nThe interesting thing to me was that while Kennedy Onassis never uttered a peep about the women’s movement, her post-Greek years were completely, comfortably informed by it. It could be a goofy sitcom premise: attractive, twice-widowed millionairess with two young children joins the work force, meets caring married man whose wife won’t give him a divorce, they move in together, in one episode she saves Grand Central Station, in another she convinces Michael Jackson to pen his memoirs, in a third she persuades her son not to rush into marriage with a movie star. I can see it now: That Widow, with Marlo Thomas. The troubling catch with Kennedy Onassis is that she never really got populist. I rather admire her refurbishing of the White House after it was split-leveled by umpty-ump years of boogie-chintz blitzes. Ditto her availability to architectural preservation and scrumptiously gift-givish coffee-table books and Americanized haute couture. None of it, however, adds up to a ratings sweep because, in an interesting way, Kennedy Onassis (unlike Amy Fisher or Tonya Harding) is resistant to the imposition of a moral. From the tabloid reader’s vantage, all of her losses appear to have been compensated for, and royally at that. Her ability to land recurrently on her Ferragamo-shod feet cut against the American grain.\n\nPersonally, I was never all caught up in the Jackie thing. She lacked the specificity that I seek in an icon, and I mean that as a compliment. (Kim Novak, for example, would have made a horrible first lady.) For three decades, Kennedy Onassis rigorously maintained her public opacity, which I’m sure was what sustained her as big-money paparazzo bounty until she was finally laid to rest. The vagueness of her persona allowed for a multitude of interpretations; whatever you needed her to be, she was. Retrospectively, Onassis’ silky armor was probably what bothered my mother the most. The woman never once showed her vulnerability, never asked the nation to help her out, never did anything except take care of herself and her children. In a country where celebrities routinely spill their guts to the media in order to get that big all-American hug of approval (in return for debasing themselves), Kennedy Onassis kept to herself. She had what my mother valued most: privacy. What rankled was that she had it in public.\n\nWhen Kennedy Onassis died, the press lords had about a millisecond to make up their minds as to who, in the end, they wanted her to be. The New York Times wanted her to be alone—a survivor. Their front-page photo was an AP headshot from 1992 with her wearing a carnation (wrong!) pinned to the neckline of her dress. Characteristically, she’s looking off somewhere to the photographer’s right, in a very eyes-on-the- prize pose. The headline read “Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Dies of Cancer at 64,” but the subhead was more to the point: “Widow of President Spent Final Day at New York Home.” Aha, the agenda was clear: lose the snooty maiden name, keep the Kennedy, acknowledge Onassis. Then neutralize the Onassis problem with the subhead “Widow of President,” as opposed to “Widow of President and Greek Shipping Tycoon.” Finally, claim her as a New Yorker. It’s hard to believe that no one in editorial suggested “Spent Final Day at Home with Family”; obviously, the paper wanted to take demographic possession of the body.\n\nThe Times set a trend in picturing Onassis alone. Oddly, not one magazine cover showed her with any of the three men with whom she lived and, through two of whom, gained her celebrity. New York magazine pictured her in her youth; again, she is looking off-camera to the right. She is holding back her windblown hair (only one bad hairstyle in thirty years, and a short-lived one), and because of the tilt of her head, and the deep shadows on her face, the magnitude of the distance between her eyes isn’t all that obvious. I mention the eye-breadth aspect of her face because it’s what kept her from being conventionally pretty and gave her, instead, a vaguely distracted, totemic dignity. At any rate, the New York cover makes her look mischievous and sexy, which is rare. Inside, the copy is a variation on the memorial norm: breezy, soporific reminiscences à la: “When you talked to Jackie, she was really listening, and it was like there was no one more important than you in the whole world.” Like 90 percent of the recollections, the preceding could have just as easily been applied to the neighbor’s dog. But hey, deadlines are deadlines.\n\nThe New Yorker, shockingly, stuck with a cover illustration of Hillary Clinton, the most image-conflicted first lady since Dolly Madison. As the mourning for Kennedy Onassis was beginning, Rodham Clinton was about to hit the town-meeting circuit, with her health plan as the main agenda. So, oddly, the two first ladies ended up in the same magazine. The difference spoke volumes: Rodham Clinton was the subject of a major investigative report, and was caricatured in illustrations throughout. No secret was left unresearched, no witness unplumbed. Clearly her right to privacy amounted to zilch, for she had been brazenly opaque about her husband’s extramarital affairs and then had attempted to implement across-the-board health-care reform. Not to worry about ambitious women, however, because right up front, “Talk of the Town” was filled with adoring, male-deferential Kennedy Onassis memories by staffers like Brendan Gill and Adam Gopnik, as well as by regulars from the eulogy pool like Oleg Cassini and George Plimpton. The memories are limited, since a number of the rememberers have to preface their insights with disclaimers like “I had a single conversation with her,” or “I took her to lunch once.” One recollector even speculates that their solo meeting “might have been one of her last public outings in New York.” Really now, public outings: what are we talking about anyway?\n\nThe New Yorker’s self-enhancing testimonials were companied by a weird, candid photograph by Slim Aarons. Jackie sits at a deserted dinner table in a strapless gown, looking up and straight into the camera. The single most unflattering portrait to appear in any of the memorial fanzines, it makes one realize that her habitual turn to the right was not only self-protective but an intelligent imaging decision. (She may not have cared to communicate her vulnerability, but she certainly cared about her public persona.) Straight on, her face became ponderously Slavic; angled and away from the lens, it was charmingly Gallic. The July cover of Vanity Fair made the point clear: Kennedy Onassis is again at a dinner table in a strapless gown, but is smiling well away and to the right of the photographer (the infamous Ron Galella). Suddenly, she’s glamorous and self-possessed.\n\nThe deluge of covers continued with Time and Newsweek and People and Town and Country and a treacle flow of anecdotes by Peter Beard, and Dominick Dunne, and Carolina Herrera, and Peggy Noonan, and whoever answered the phone and made some copy available. Down the road, a portion of the material may be a meaningful part of a larger mosaic; some of it may sink to the bottom of the sea of transient opportunity. Out of it all, one quote sticks with me, from an essay by John Russell for Time. “Think of the plots that are being hatched down there, she would say, looking down from the balcony of the Four Seasons Restaurant, with her Schlumberger bracelets dangling over the edge.” How deliciously Proustian the intimation of a slight tinkling noise, and the implied bouquet of expensive aromas. We know from some little moments in New York magazine’s eulogy that Kennedy Onassis could be just a tad catty, so let’s add to the image an imaginary remark about toupees and flambés, or a tiny sonic squeak of impatience when the check mistakenly arrived at the table and Russell made an abortive attempt to pay. I would prefer to believe that Kennedy Onassis had a marker out on the world that could never be repaid. In return, the world could pry and probe all it wanted, but the object of its curiosity was basically a woman who married and had children and made some mistakes and straightened them out to the best of her ability and died earlier than statistics would indicate she should have. If all she left was the echo of Schlumberger bracelets clinking over a crowded dining room, so be it. I suspect that her legacy is a bigger deal—otherwise my mother would never have been so touchy about her—but we’ll never know until the riot of anecdotes has been stilled and the power of her absence can be assessed.\n\nRichard Flood is chief curator at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis."
