        "text": "On this day in history, May 19, 1994, Jackie (Bouvier) Kennedy Onassis passed away at her apartment in New York City after a battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was 64.\n\nThe enigmatic and glamorous first lady — a worldwide style icon — was born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York, to socialite mother Janet Lee and stockbroker father John \"Black Jack\" Bouvier, according to Ancestralfindings.com.\n\nFollowing a privileged childhood spent in New York City as well as in East Hampton, New York; Virginia; and Newport, Rhode Island, Bouvier enrolled in Vassar College in 1947.\n\nShe studied abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris during her junior year, according to History.com.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 18, 1980, MOUNT ST. HELENS ERUPTS, TRIGGERS LARGEST LANDSLIDE IN RECORDED HISTORY\n\nShe excelled as an equestrian at a young age and was also accomplished at ballet dancing. She was fluent in several languages, Ancestralfindings.com also noted.\n\nBouvier graduated from The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., in 1951, according to History.com.\n\nThe summer after graduation, Bouvier was working as a photographer at the Washington Times-Herald when she was introduced to John F. Kennedy at a friend’s party in D.C.\n\nAt the time, Kennedy was a young representative from Massachusetts.\n\n\"They didn’t begin a romantic relationship until almost a year later and were engaged by June 1953,\" History.com indicates.\n\nBy this point, Kennedy had won election to the U.S. Senate.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 17, 1954, SUPREME COURT TROUNCES SEGREGATION IN LANDMARK BROWN V. BOARD CASE\n\nThey couple were married on Sept. 12, 1953, in St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nThen-Sen. Kennedy suffered crippling back pain from football and wartime injuries and began having corrective surgeries, according to the JFK Library and Museum's website.\n\nThe book, \"Profiles in Courage,\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1957.\n\nWhile he recovered from surgery, Mrs. Kennedy encouraged her husband to write a book about U.S. senators who risked their careers to stand up for the issues they supported.\n\nThe book, \"Profiles in Courage,\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1957.\n\nThat same year, the couple's first child, Caroline, was born, the library also notes.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 15, 1800, PRESIDENT ADAMS MOVES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM PHILADELPHIA TO DC\n\nIn January 1960, Sen. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S. presidency. During the campaign, Jackie Kennedy became pregnant with their second child. Doctors advised her to remain at home.\n\nWhile at home, Mrs. Kennedy \"wrote hundreds of campaign letters, taped TV commercials, gave interviews and wrote a weekly newspaper column, ‘Campaign Wife,’ which was distributed across the country,\" according to the library's website.\n\nOn Nov. 8, 1960, Kennedy beat Republican Richard M. Nixon in a tight race to win the presidency.\n\n\"Two and-a-half weeks later, Mrs. Kennedy gave birth to their second child, John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr.,\" the site says.\n\nDuring their tenure at the White House, President Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy \"brought a new, youthful spirit to the White House, which they believed should be a place to celebrate American history, culture and achievement,\" says the library's website.\n\nMrs. Kennedy also accompanied the president on official travel, representing the United States abroad.\n\n\"Once in a great while, an individual will capture the imagination of people all over the world. You have done this.\"\n\nClark Clifford, a respected lawyer and adviser to President Kennedy, was so pleased with Mrs. Kennedy after her trip to Paris, Vienna and Greece that he sent her a note of appreciation, according to the JFK Library.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 13, 1981, POPE JOHN PAUL II SURVIVES ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT\n\nIt read, \"Once in a great while, an individual will capture the imagination of people all over the world. You have done this; and what is more important, through your graciousness and tact, you have transformed this rare accomplishment into an incredibly important asset to this nation.\"\n\nAs first lady, Mrs. Kennedy also traveled to Italy, India and Pakistan.\n\n\"Her interest in other cultures and her ability to speak several foreign languages, including French, Spanish and Italian, brought her good will and admiration around the world,\" said the JFK Library.\n\nOn Aug. 7, 1963, Mrs. Kennedy gave birth to the couple’s third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy. The infant suffered from a lung ailment and was rushed to the Children's Hospital in Boston, where he died two days later.\n\nWhile still recovering from the loss, a second tragedy befell the first lady — and the nation.\n\nThe word \"Camelot\" is a unique part of the Kennedy legacy.\n\nOn Nov. 22, 1963, President and Mrs. Kennedy were in Dallas, Texas, as the president prepared for his next campaign by visiting states important to his reelection.\n\n\"As their car drove slowly past cheering crowds, shots rang out. President Kennedy was killed and Jacqueline Kennedy became a widow at age 34,\" the JFK Library notes.\n\n\"As it was broadcast around the world, millions of people shared her grief and admired her courage and dignity,\" says the same site.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 8, 1945, PRESIDENT TRUMAN ANNOUNCES SURENDER OF NAZI GERMANY FORCES IN WWII\n\nThe word \"Camelot\" is a unique part of the Kennedy legacy.\n\nThe Kennedys \"also created the perception that the Kennedy presidency was like the era of Camelot, a mythical time associated with a sense of unfulfilled promise,\" says the National Parks Service website.\n\nMrs. Kennedy had a deep understanding of both her husband and his ideals, according to the University of Southern California’s Center on Public Diplomacy.\n\nAfter her husband’s death, in an interview with LIFE Magazine given shortly before leaving the White House, Jackie Kennedy said her husband had always looked at history with an idealized view, notes that site.\n\n\"Don’t let it be forgot that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot,\" she said, quoting from her late husband’s favorite musical, \"Camelot,\" said People.com.\n\nShe also said, \"There will be great presidents again, but there will never be another Camelot.\"\n\n\"In the 1970s she played an important role in saving Grand Central Terminal in New York City.\"\n\nFollowing President Kennedy’s death, Mrs. Kennedy started work on the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum as a memorial to her husband, the library notes.\n\nIn 1968, Mrs. Kennedy married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis.\n\nThey were married until his death in 1975, says Brittanica.com.\n\nFollowing her second husband’s death, Jackie Kennedy worked as a consulting editor at Viking Press and later as an associate and senior editor at Doubleday, that site notes.\n\n\"She also maintained her interest in the arts and in landmark preservation and notably, in the 1970s she played an important role in saving Grand Central Terminal in New York City,\" Britannica adds.\n\n\"And now she is in God's hands.\"\n\nJackie Kennedy continued her work in book publishing until her death on May 19, 1994, from cancer.\n\nStanding under the entrance canopy outside her apartment in New York City, her son, John F.
