        "text": "(light tinkling music)\n\n[Narrator] The uptown address offered little refuge.\n\nShe was hounded, assaulted, her privacy invaded.\n\nFinally, after years of abuse, a judge put a stop to it.\n\nRon Galella couldn't come within 150 feet\n\nof 1040 Fifth Avenue,\n\nor its most famous resident, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\n(mysterious suspenseful music)\n\nDesigned in 1930, by Rosario Candela,\n\nwho built some of New York's\n\nmost prestigious luxury buildings,\n\n1040 Fifth Avenue was made for the spotlight.\n\nIt towers 17 stories above Central Park,\n\nyet has only 27 apartments.\n\nIts asymmetrical roof line,\n\nwith its columns and massive picture windows,\n\nis one of the most distinct on Fifth Avenue.\n\nBut, it is as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's home,\n\nfor which 1040 Fifth Avenue is most famous.\n\nJackie Kennedy moved here just one year after her husband,\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy, was assassinated.\n\nShe assumed that New Yorkers,\n\nespecially those on the Upper East Side,\n\nwould let her live in peace.\n\nMost did.\n\nExcept this man.\n\nRon Galella.\n\nGalella was obsessed with Jackie,\n\ntaking thousands upon thousands of pictures\n\nof her and her children.\n\nHe hid in bushes, bribed doormen, even dated her maid,\n\nwho provided him with information\n\non Jackie's comings and goings.\n\nGalella captured his most famous image,\n\nwhat he called his Mona Lisa,\n\nby hiding in a taxi on Fifth Avenue.\n\nHe paid the cabbie two bucks to honk\n\nwhen Jackie O. walked by.\n\n(car honking)\n\nThen, at just the right moment,\n\nhe snapped one of the most iconic images\n\nof the former first lady.\n\nWhy did I have an obsession with Jackie?\n\nGalella wondered years later.\n\nI've analyzed it.\n\nI had no girlfriend.\n\nShe was my girlfriend, in a way.\n\nIt's doubtful that Ms. Onassis\n\nwould've seen it the same way.\n\nAfter years of being pursued by Galella's lens,\n\nshe had enough.\n\nOne afternoon, Jackie ordered the Secret Service\n\nto confiscate Galella's film when he snapped a picture\n\nof her and John Jr. riding in Central Park.\n\nWhen the photographer refused to turn over his camera,\n\nhe was taken to the nearest police precinct\n\nand arrested for harassment.\n\nGalella countered with a lawsuit,\n\nclaiming that Jackie O. was denying him his livelihood.\n\nIt was a bold move that backfired.\n\nThe judge Galella appeared before\n\nhad been appointed by JFK.\n\nAnd the paparazzo was slapped with a restraining order.\n\nHe could not come within 150 feet of 1040 Fifth Avenue,\n\nMs. Onassis, or her children.\n\nOn appeal, the order was reduced to 25 feet.\n\nSomething Galella had quite a bit of fun with\n\nover the years.\n\nWhen Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died in 1994,\n\nthe 15th floor apartment, which she'd bought for $250,000,\n\nwas sold to David Koch, then the world's 33rd richest man,\n\nfor 9.5 million.\n\nFor a while there, we sort of felt her spirit\n\nin the apartment, he noted.\n\nKoch gut renovated the apartment,\n\nat a cost of at least 10 million dollars.\n\nBut in the end, it wasn't enough.\n\nWhen Mr. Koch and his wife had their third child,\n\nthey were forced to move.\n\nJackie O.'s four-bedroom apartment,\n\nwith its two dressing rooms, staff room, library,\n\nliving room, dining room, conservatory, wine room,\n\nthree fireplaces, 5 1/2 bathrooms, and two terraces,\n\nwas simply too small.\n\nThere's just no way we could fit another child\n\nin that apartment, Mr. Koch said at the time.\n\nIt just goes to show, that no matter how rich you are,\n\nin New York, there's never enough space.\n\n(metallic chiming)"
