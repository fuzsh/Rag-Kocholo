        "text": "Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was born on July 28, 1929 in East Hampton, New York. She lived a privileged childhood, growing up in both East Hampton and Manhattan.1 She was educated at Vassar College and George Washington University. During her time at the latter institution, Jacqueline Bouvier began her life in Washington, D.C.2\n\nIn 1952, Jacqueline met and began dating John F. Kennedy, a young politician. By September 1953, the two were married. With the presidential election of 1960, Jacqueline Kennedy became the First Lady of the United States.3 In her position as First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy “built her historic preservation legacy” through her restoration of the White House.4 While managing the restoration of the White House, she educated millions of Americans about historic preservation through an hour-long television program on CBS. This project sparked Jacqueline Kennedy’s interest in historic preservation, which she remained dedicated to for the rest of her life.\n\nFollowing the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, Jacqueline moved to New York City with her children and began a new life. In 1968, she married Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, but continued to live part-time in New York.5\n\nFollowing the death of her second husband in 1975, Jacqueline Onassis lived and worked in New York City. She was a member of the Municipal Art Society’s Board of Directors.6 Grounded by her previous interest and experience with historic preservation, she spent her time in New York fighting for significant landmarks including Grand Central Terminal and St. Bartholomew’s Church.7\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis died in New York City on May 19, 1994 at age 64.8\n\nFollowing the restoration of the White House in 1961, Jacqueline Kennedy turned her attention to the preservation of the surrounding area, Lafayette Square. The area had been slated for demolition to make way for new federal buildings. Jackie Kennedy's fear of losing the historic character of this neighborhood led her to fight for its protection.9\n\nDuring this campaign the First Lady met with David E. Finley, chairman of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, and expressed her desire to preserve the area. For Jacqueline Kennedy, this battle also evidenced the need for legislation regarding historic preservation. She reportedly told Finley she \"would like to have Congress pass a law establishing something on the order of Monuments Historiques in France.\"10 Jacqueline Kennedy's interest in Lafayette Square and her work to preserve it was ultimately successful.11 Her desire to see a historic preservation law also came to fruition with the passing of the Historic Preservation Act in 1966.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's role in the effort to preserve Lafayette Square was not only essential to winning this battle, but also to shaping the future of historic preservation. Upon the passage of the Historic Preservation Act, members of Congress referred to her work as \"a model, not only for preservation in this city, but for large and small communities throughout America.\"12\n\nIn 1975, when Grand Central was threatened with demolition, Jacqueline Onassis lent her support to the preservation cause. She began her involvement with the campaign mildly at first by joining the citizens committee at the Municipal Art Society.13 Soon she became the public face of the campaign. As a well-known figure, she brought great attention to the campaign. A colleague noted:\n\n\"Jackie brought enormous visibility to the campaign...By standing up and speaking out for the terminal, she made it a success. And she made it not just a struggle involving New Yorkers, but people all over the country.\"14\n\nShe helped lead the fight by forming the Committee to Save Grand Central Station.15 With this committee she participated in rallies at the terminal. She and a group of Grand Central supporters also traveled by train (which was called the \"Landmark Express\") to Washington D.C., to bring attention to the Supreme Court hearing.16 Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Landmarks Law and Grand Central Terminal was saved from having a 53-story tower built atop it.17\n\nIn 1984, a new battle arose when St. Bartholomew's Church announced plans to build a new office building on the site of the church's community house. The rationale for the new building was that revenue from the offices would subsidize St. Bart's social programs.18 Immediately, Jacqueline Onassis stepped in to preserve the landmark by suggesting an alternative fundraising drive.19 St. Bart's minister, Reverend Thomas Bowers, rejected this option and found himself and the church in a battle with New York City's toughest preservationists. For this fight, preservationists, including Jackie Onassis, participated in another \"Landmark Express\" similar to the one to Washington for Grand Central. This time they ventured to Albany to fight for their cause.20 On this trip, Jacqueline Onassis testified in favor of St. Bart's landmark status.21\n\nIn 1987, Jacqueline Onassis once again spoke out in favor of preservation. This time the battle centered on a proposed office building to be built in Columbus Circle. With this battle, she played a less public role, but still exerted great influence. The developer attempting to erect the structure, Mortimer Zuckerman, found his opponent formidable, and made adjustments to the original plan.22"
