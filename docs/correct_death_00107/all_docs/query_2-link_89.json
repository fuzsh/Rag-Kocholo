        "text": "For 560,000 euro (approximately $627,505) a week, guests can charter the \"Christina O,\" a yacht once owned by Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nValef Yachts, a charter company based in Greece, also offers it for a daily rate: 90,000 euro (approximately $100,850) per day in July and August. It costs 80,000 euro (about $89,642) per day in other months.\n\nIncluded in the price for a sail on the Christina O? A staff of 38 crew, according to a representative from Valef Yachts.\n\nAristotle Onassis, Jackie Kennedy Onassis' second husband, named the boat \"Christina\" after his daughter, according to the company, and a \"family friend\" renamed the boat \"Christina O\" following Aristotle Onassis' death.\n\nWinston Churchill, John Wayne, Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe are among the famous guests who have been on the yacht, says the Charter Company. Aristotle Onassis \"was friends with many celebrities\" and a \"gracious host,\" Kassandra Lefakinis, Valef managing partner, tells CNBC Make It. He \"used his yacht to welcome many aboard who were visiting Greece.\"\n\nJackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis had a wedding reception on the boat in 1968, according to Lefakinis, and Aristotle Onassis died in 1975, leaving the yacht to his daughter, Christina, who later bequeathed it to the Greek government in 1978, says Lefakinis.\n\nThe yacht is available to rent for cruises in the Mediterranean over summer months and in the Caribbean in the winter months, though the company says it is open to charters in other parts of the world.\n\nThe price only includes the charter and staff. The rates do not include food, beverages or alcohol, which can all be arranged for an extra fee, a representative tells CNBC Make it. \"You can provide a grocery list or the charter company can provide menus to choose from.\"\n\nThe company declined to comment on who currently owns the boat.\n\nJackie Kennedy Onassis' Martha's Vineyard estate, now owned by her daughter Caroline Kennedy, recently went on the market for $65 million.\n\nDon't miss:\n\nJackie Kennedy Onassis' summer home in Martha's Vineyard is for sale for $65 million — take a look\n\nPrince Charles opened a royal bed and breakfast that's just $200 a night — take a look\n\nThe most expensive resort in the world costs $100,000 a night — here's what you get\n\nThis cruise ship has the first at-sea roller coaster—take a look"
