Kennedy, served as president.\n\nShe grew up in spacious New York apartments and several-acre estates, and after her marriage, she spent her summers at the famed Kennedy Compound and winters on the family's estate in Palm Beach. Though out of all the impressive properties she has resided in, she said her family's \"happiest years\" were those spent with her husband in the White House.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nHere are all of the impressive places she lived in and owned in her lifetime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore she was a Kennedy or an Onassis, Jacqueline Lee Bouvier spent her early years in New York City.\n\nIn 1932, the Bouviers moved into an apartment on the sixth and seventh floors of 740 Park Avenue.\n\nThe apartment building was developed by her grandfather, James T. Lee. At least for a period, her father couldn't afford to furnish it so Jackie and her sister could roller skate from room to room.\n\nThe apartment building later became a home for billionaires and was once considered one of the most iconic apartment buildings in the city.\n\nIn 2017, her old apartment sold for $25.25 million.\n\nIn the 1940s, Bouvier's mother remarried, and they left New York.\n\nThey moved into a Georgian-style mansion called \"Merrywood\" in McLean, Virginia, in Washington, DC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mansion, which was built in 1919, sits on the edge of the Potomac River and covers 23,000 square feet.\n\nBouvier's mother had married an oil magnate named Hugh D. Auchincloss, who owned the mansion.\n\nAt the time, it had nine bedrooms and 13 bathrooms, as well as an extensive garden.\n\nBouvier wrote fondly about the house in her diary, saying, \"I always love it so at Merrywood — so peaceful … with the river and those great steep hills.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBouvier spent her summers at her paternal grandfather's East Hampton estate called \"Lasata,\" which means \"place of peace,\" in the native Algonquian language.\n\nThe house, which was 8,500 square feet, was built in 1917 and sat on about seven acres.\n\nEarlier this year, the fashion designer, Tom Ford, bought it for $52 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also spent some of her summers at her maternal grandfather's house in East Hampton called \"Wildmoor.\"\n\nThe 18th-century home, covering about 5,700 square feet, was a shingle-and-clapboard wooden house with a view of fields, a swamp, and the sea, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn 2021, the house was sold for $6.8 million.\n\nHer next notable property was the Kennedy family's summer home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.\n\nJoseph Kennedy Sr., John F. Kennedy's father, bought a white-shingled cottage in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, for $25,000 — about $450,000 today. The coastal Massachusetts cottage became the Kennedy family's home base for years to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore they were married, Bouvier and John F. Kennedy spent some time together there, which later became known as the \"Kennedy Compound.\"\n\nThe Kennedys bought the house in 1928, Town and Country reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1953, Bouvier became a Kennedy when the couple married in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nThey had the wedding reception at her mother's husband's sprawling estate, known as \"Hammersmith Farm,\" anchored by a grand, 28-room Victorian-era mansion.\n\nThe property was last sold in 1999 for just over $8 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe estate became a part-time summer home for the Kennedys, along with the Kennedy Compound.\n\nJackie Kennedy spent summers on the estate during her childhood, and the Kennedys later vacationed there in the summer of 1961.\n\nIn 1953, not long after the Kennedys were married, they rented a four-story, four-bedroom house in Georgetown at 3321 Dent Place.\n\nThe Kennedys lived there for almost two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey enjoyed throwing dinner parties and spending time in its back gardens.\n\nThe house is about 3,000 square feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo years later, in 1955, the Kennedys moved to \"Hickory Hill,\" another Georgian-style house.\n\nThis one was built in 1815 and had a tennis court, a pool, and 12 fireplaces on a 5.6-acre plot in McLean, Virginia.\n\nThey bought it from Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo years later, the Kennedys sold it for $250,000 to John's brother, Robert, who would end up raising his own family there.\n\nJackie didn't want to go back after her daughter was stillborn.\n\nRobert Kennedy was at the house when he heard John had been assassinated, the Baltimore Sun reported. He spent an hour alone, walking around the estate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1956, the Kennedys bought a summer home at 111 Irving Avenue in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, right beside the original Kennedy summer home.\n\nThe 4,484-square-foot clapboarded home sat on less than an acre of land and soon became part of the \"Kennedy Compound.\"\n\nThey spent $45,948 on the house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1957, the Kennedys bought 3307 N Street, an 18th-century brick row house in Georgetown, for $82,000.\n\nJackie spent about $18,000 on remodeling it, and she decorated the house with armchairs and good porcelain.\n\nHer husband campaigned and was elected president during their years here, Architectural Digest reported.\n\nThough not officially a property she owned, Jackie lived in the White House with her family during her husband's presidency from 1961 to the end of 1963.\n\nShe later described this period as her family's \"happiest years,\" The Daily Beast reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the winters, while they were living in the White House, they vacationed at her father-in-law Joseph Kennedy's Palm Beach estate.\n\nThe Palm Beach estate became known as the Kennedys' \"winter White House.\" In 2020, the house sold for $70 million and underwent extensive renovations by the new owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1963, after her husband was assassinated, Jackie and her children left the White House and moved into an 18th-century home at 3017 N Street in Georgetown.\n\nShe paid around $175,000 for the five-bedroom house but only lived there for about a year. It was too public, and she reportedly became overwhelmed with all of the tourists.\n\nIn 2017, it was purchased for $5.25 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackie Kennedy owned the apartment until she died in 1994.\n\nIt was bought from her estate in 1995 for $9.2 million.\n\nThe buyer said she hadn't done much upkeep, and they ended up gutting the whole apartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was alive, she began dividing her time between France, Greece, Martha's Vineyard, and New Jersey.\n\nShe kept New York as a home base.\n\nShe also got married again in 1968 to a Greek shipping magnate named Aristotle Onassis and became Jackie Onassis, or \"Jackie O.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1974, Onassis purchased a country home — a converted barn on almost 10 acres — for $200,000 in Peapack, New Jersey.\n\nShe liked the area for its natural beauty and space for horse riding.\n\nShe knew the area well because she had previously rented a farmhouse described by The Times as a \"badly made-over barn\" in Bernardsville since 1965.\n\nAfter she bought the property, she painted it yellow with white trim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Onassis died, her neighbor and friend, Marjorie McDonnell Walsh, bought the Peapack property for $1.47 million in 1997.\n\nWalsh told The Wall Street Journal they tore the house down.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" she said when declining to share details about the new house. \"The much more important thing is we both love the property. It's a private valley. It's beautiful.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nReal Estate\n\nAdvertisement"
