        "text": "The Washington DC home where Jackie Kennedy and her children took refuge after the assassination of her husband, John F. Kennedy, is now on the market for $10 million, for the first time in nearly 25 years.\n\nAccording to the Library of Congress, soon after President Kennedy was killed in 1963, the former first lady moved into the Georgetown residence, which was provided to them by politician W. Averell Harriman, a former governor of New York, and his third wife, Pamela Churchill Harriman.\n\nThe Harrimans would move out of the home to give Kennedy Onassis and her children, John Jr. and Caroline space after the death of the former president.\n\n“Even without the history, this is a very important Georgetown house,” listing agent Michael Rankin of TTR Sotheby’s International Realty told Mansion Global.\n\nThe Harrimans themselves had their own famous lineage. Pamela’s first husband was the only son of UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Randolph. But after her death in 1997, the family’s brick home was passed down to her son, Winston Spencer Churchill, the agent explained. The current owner purchased the home later that year for $1.7 million.\n\nBuilt in 1805 and known as the Riggs-Riley House, the 9,330-square-foot home is made up of eight bedrooms and six bathrooms. The house has since undertaken an extensive renovation project at the hands of architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen, who worked closely alongside Harriman to further improve upon the already existing architectural details of the residence.\n\nWith several scaled living areas come remarkable moldings and light-colored narrow-board wood flooring. The house is also filled with an abundance of natural light from oversized north-facing windows, further magnified by the nearly 12-foot-high ceilings.\n\nSituated on a .38-acre lot, Rankin explains that this is an “extreme rarity in Georgetown.”\n\nOther features include a series of multiple terraces on the rear grounds, architecturally enhanced with extensive gardens and a pool, with parking for up to five cars."
