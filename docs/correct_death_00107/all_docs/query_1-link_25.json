        "text": "(1929–94). The mystique of the Kennedy family in United States politics was due in great part to Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, the glamorous and attractive wife of John F. Kennedy, 35th president of the United States. She brought grace, style, and a flair for beauty to the White House, quickly becoming a celebrity in her own right. The nation became enchanted with the photogenic young duo—the first presidential couple to be born in the 20th century—and their lively children, but on Nov. 22, 1963, these pleasant images gave way to horrific ones of Kennedy being assassinated while his wife sat next to him in a Dallas, Tex., motorcade.\n\nJacqueline Lee Bouvier, the daughter of a wealthy stockbroker, was born on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, N.Y. As a child, Jackie—as she often was called—developed the interests she would still relish as an adult: horseback riding, reading, writing, and painting. Her parents separated when she was 8, and Jacqueline was 13 when her mother married Hugh D. Auchincloss, Jr., a wealthy lawyer, who had an estate in Virginia and a fashionable summer home in Newport, R.I.\n\nAlthough she received a great deal of attention as a debutante, Jacqueline was equally interested in pursuing an education. She attended several private American schools as well as the Sorbonne in Paris, where she polished her French and solidified her affinity for French culture and style. After graduating from George Washington University in Washington, D.C., in 1951, she entered a writing contest sponsored by Vogue magazine and beat out more than 1,000 other contestants to win the first prize—the opportunity to work for the magazine’s Paris edition—but she decided to turn it down. Instead, she took a job as a reporter-photographer at the Washington Times-Herald.\n\nAt a Washington, D.C., dinner party, some newspaper friends introduced Jacqueline to Kennedy, already a successful Massachusetts politician and one of the country’s most eligible bachelors. Their wedding on Sept. 12, 1953, in St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Church in Newport attracted national attention, and more than 1,000 guests attended the reception.\n\nThe early years of their marriage included considerable disappointment and sadness. Kennedy underwent spinal surgery, and Jacqueline suffered a miscarriage and delivered a stillborn daughter. Their luck appeared to change with the birth of a healthy daughter, Caroline Bouvier Kennedy, on Nov. 27, 1957. Kennedy was elected president in 1960, just weeks before the birth of their son, John F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nThe youngest first lady in nearly 80 years, 31-year-old Jacqueline left a distinct mark on the job. During the 1960 election campaign she hired Letitia Baldrige, who was both politically savvy and astute on matters of etiquette, to assist her as social secretary. Through Baldrige, Jacqueline announced that she intended to make the White House a showcase for the country’s most talented and accomplished individuals, and she invited musicians, actors, and intellectuals to the executive mansion.\n\nThe first lady’s most enduring contribution was her work to restore the White House to its original elegance and to protect its holdings. She established the White House Historical Association, which was charged with educating the public and raising funds, and she wrote the foreword to the association’s first edition of The White House: An Historic Guide (1962). To catalog the mansion’s holdings, Jacqueline hired a curator from the Smithsonian Institution, a job that eventually became permanent. Congress, acting with the first lady’s support, passed a law to encourage donations of valuable art and furniture and made White House furnishings of “artistic or historic importance” the “inalienable property” of the nation, thus prohibiting residents from disposing of them at will. After extensive refurbishing, Jacqueline hosted a tour of the White House that aired nationally on television in February 1962.\n\nJacqueline became one of history’s most popular first ladies. During her travels with the president to Europe (1961) and Central and South America (1962), she won wide praise for her beauty, fashion sense, and facility with languages. Alluding to his wife’s immense popularity during their tour of France in 1961, the president jokingly reintroduced himself to reporters as “the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris.” Parents named their daughters after Jacqueline, and women copied her bouffant hairstyle, pillbox hat, and flat-heeled pumps.\n\nThe Kennedys suffered the death of a premature baby, Patrick Bouvier, in August 1963. In November Jacqueline agreed to make one of her infrequent political appearances and accompanied her husband to Texas as part of his campaign for reelection the following year. As the president’s motorcade moved through Dallas, he was assassinated as she sat unharmed beside him; about two hours later she stood beside Lyndon Johnson in her bloodstained pink suit as he took the presidential oath of office, an unprecedented appearance by a widowed first lady. On her return to the capital, Jacqueline oversaw the planning of her husband’s funeral, using many of the details of Abraham Lincoln’s funeral a century earlier. Her quiet dignity—and the sight of her two young children standing beside her during the ceremony—brought an outpouring of admiration and sympathy from Americans and from all over the world.\n\nJacqueline moved to an apartment in New York City, which remained her principal residence for the rest of her life. In October 1968 she married one of the wealthiest men in the world, Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, but she continued to spend considerable time in New York, where her children attended school. After Onassis died in 1975, the bulk of his estate went to his daughter, but Jacqueline inherited a sum variously estimated at 20 million–26 million dollars.\n\nFrom 1978 until her death, Jacqueline worked as a book editor in New York City. She also maintained her interest in the arts and in landmark preservation. Jacqueline died on May 19, 1994, in her New York City apartment soon after having been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. After a funeral at St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church on Park Avenue, she was buried in Arlington National Cemetery beside her first husband and the two children who had predeceased them. After her one surviving son, John F. Kennedy, Jr., was killed in a plane accident in July 1999, many books and articles assessed the recurring role of tragedy in the Kennedy story."
