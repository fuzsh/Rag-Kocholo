        "text": "A piece of Washington, D.C., history is hitting the market.\n\nThe Georgetown property formed through the combination of three houses — one of which was home to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy — will be listed for $26.5 million, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nJonathan Taylor, of TTR Sotheby’s International Realty, has the listing for a trust of the late David W. Hudgens, who combined the three homes into a 16,300-square-foot, 13-bedroom mansion before his death in November 2022, the outlet said.\n\nThe home formerly owned by Onassis became a tourist attraction, leading the family to move out about nine months after Onassis bought it in December 1963, the Journal reported.\n\nHudgens bought the three homes individually: one for $1.2 million in 1997; another in 2006 for $1.6 million; and the former Onassis home for $5.25 million in 2017, according to the outlet.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nIt took about four years for the homes to be remodeled and connected, according to architect Dale Overmyer, who was commissioned for the project. The homes, though connected, still maintain their own individual characteristics, according to the WSJ.\n\nRead more\n\nResidential\n\nLos Angeles\n\nJ.Lo and Ben Affleck scrap $35M house deal for $64M mansion nearby\n\nResidential\n\nNational\n\nJosh Flagg of “Million Dollar Listing” says “Selling Sunset” agents are actors\n\nResidential\n\nChicago\n\nActors Tracy Letts, Carrie Coon sell Bucktown mansion for $3M\n\nHudgens’ vision was to have a place where “presidents and dignitaries could visit and fundraising events could occur,” Overmyer told the Journal. “He also wanted all three houses to work independently or together.”\n\nThe former Onassis home, built in the late 18th century and also known as the Baker House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some elements of the home remained intact, including the fireplaces, entry hall and first floor living room, the Journal reported. It also includes a library, dining room, new kitchen and gym, as well as an entirely redone second floor.\n\nOne of the other homes has a roof terrace with views of the Washington Monument, the Journal said.\n\n— Ted Glanzer"
