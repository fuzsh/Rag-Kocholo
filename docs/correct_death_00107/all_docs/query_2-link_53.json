        "text": "This collection consists of two letters from Jacqueline Onassis to Douglas Mansell, thanking him for the 4th grade field trip he led at the Bethlehem Steel Corporation's shipyard in Hoboken, New Jersey. In one letter, she enclosed 19 handwritten reflections by the students about the shipyard visit. The field trip was for Onassis's son, John F. Kennedy, Jr., and his class at the Collegiate School for Boys in New York. Five photographs depicting the class and their chaperones at the shipyard, featuring Onassis and her son, accompany the correspondence.\n\nJacqueline \"Jackie\" Kennedy Onassis was born Jacqueline Bouvier in 1929 in Southampton, New York, to stockbroker John Vernou Bouvier III and Janet Lee Bouvier. Jacqueline Bouvier graduated from George Washington University in 1951 and took a job as a reporter for the Washington-Times Herald. She married the then-senator John F. Kennedy in 1953. When Kennedy became president in 1960, Jacqueline became one of the youngest First Ladies of the United States of America. Her time as First Lady was marked by her popularity among Americans and her sense of fashion and style. After her husband's assassination in 1963, she moved to New York where she married Aristotle Onassis and worked as an editor. She died from cancer in her New York apartment in 1994."
