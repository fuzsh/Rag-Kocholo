        "text": "November 26, 1963\n\nDear Mr. President,\n\nThank you for walking yesterday - behind Jack. You did not have to do that - I am sure many people forbid you to take such a risk - but you did it anyway.\n\nThank you for your letters to my children. What those letters will mean to them later - you can imagine. The touching thing is, they have always loved you so much, they were most moved to have a letter from you now.\n\nAnd most of all, Mr. President, thank you for the way you have always treated me - the way you and Lady Bird have always been to me - before, when Jack was alive, and now as President.\n\nI think the relationship of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential families could be a rather strained one. From the history I have been reading ever since I came to the White House, I gather it often was in the past.\n\nBut you were Jack’s right arm - and I always thought the greatest act of a gentleman that I had seen on this earth - was how you - the Majority Leader when he came to the Senate as just another little freshman who looked up to you and took orders from you, could then serve as Vice President to a man who had served under you and been taught by you.\n\nBut more than that we were friends, all four of us. All you did for me as a friend and the happy times we had. I always thought way before the nomination that Lady Bird should be First Lady - but I don’t need to tell you here what I think of her qualities - her extraordinary grace of character - her willingness to assume every burden - she assumed so many for me and I love her very much - and I love your two daughters - Lynda Bird most because I know her the best - and we first met when neither of us could get a seat to hear President Eisenhower’s State of the Union message, and someone found us a place on one of the steps on the aisle where we sat together. If we had known then what our relationship would be now.\n\nIt was so strange - last night I was wandering through this house. There in the Treaty Room is your chandelier, and I had framed - the page we all signed - you - Senator Dirksen and Mike Mansfield - underneath I had written “The day the Vice President brought the East Room chandelier back from the Capitol.”\n\nThen in the library I showed Bobby the Lincoln Record book you gave - you see all you gave - and now you are called on to give so much more.\n\nYour office - you are the first President to sit in it as it looks today. Jack always wanted a red rug - and I had curtains designed for it that I thought were as dignified as they should be for a President’s office.\n\nLate last night a moving man asked me if I wanted Jack’s ship pictures left on the wall for you (They were clearing the office to make room for you) - I said no because I remembered all the fun Jack had those first days hanging pictures of things he loved, setting out his collection of whales teeth etc.\n\nBut of course they are there only waiting for you to ask for them if the walls look too bare. I thought you would want to put things from Texas in it - I pictured some gleaming longhorns - I hope you put them somewhere.\n\nIt mustn’t be very much help to you your first day in office - to hear children on the lawn at recess. It is just one more example of your kindness that you let them stay - I promise - they will soon be gone -\n\nThank you Mr. President.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJackie\n\nSource: LBJ Library\n\nResearch by Steven L. Brawley\n\nNovember 1993\n\nJackie shows no apparent sign of illness as of November, when she has a CAT scan after falling off a horse while riding in Virginia.\n\nDecember 1993\n\nJackie seemed healthy until early December, when she was in Virginia and noticed a swelling in her right groin. A doctor there diagnosed a swollen lymph node, and suspecting an infection, prescribed antibiotics. The swelling diminished but did not completely disappear.\n\nWhile on a boat in the Caribbean over the Christmas holidays, Jackie developed a cough, swollen lymph nodes in her neck and pain in her abdomen.\n\nAfter consulting by telephone with a doctor in New York City, she flies back to Manhattan. The doctor finds enlarged lymph nodes in her neck and in her armpit. A computerized type of X-ray, a CAT scan, showed that there were swollen lymph nodes in her chest and in an area deep in the abdomen, the retroperitoneal area.\n\nA biopsy of one of the neck nodes shows that she had non-Hodgkins lymphoma. A pathologist noted that the cells were anaplastic -- that is, they were undeveloped, what doctors call \"embryonic\" or \"primitive,\" indicating that the disease was highly malignant.\n\nJackie is offered a chance to seek a second opinion elsewhere, but declines to do so. The pathology slides of her lymph nodes are sent to experts at a hospital in another city, and a doctor from that hospital come as a consultant to New York City.\n\nJanuary 1994\n\nIn early January, she begins receiving the first of four standard courses of chemotherapy for the lymphoma. The therapy includes steroid drugs, and the initial treatment led to an apparent remission. She loses her hair and begins to don a wig. She works as often as she can at her job as an editor with Doubleday.\n\nFebruary 1994\n\nJackie signs a living will that clearly expressed her wish not to receive aggressive medical treatment if she developed a grave illness and such measures would be futile.\n\nIn February the intensely private Jackie announces she has been given the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nMarch 1994\n\nBt mid-March, she becomes weaker, became confused and has pains in her legs. A neurological examination indicated that the cerebellum portion of her brain had now been affected.\n\nAnother type of scan, an M.R.I., showed that the lymphoma had disappeared from her neck, chest and abdomen but that it had spread to the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.\n\nAfter the cancer was found in her brain, Jackie receives radiation therapy there and to her lower spinal cord for about a month. The treatment relieves her weakness, but she continues to experience pain in her neck, for which she is given pain medications. During this time she receives her care at home and as a hospital out-patient.\n\nApril 1994\n\nOn April 14, she is was admitted to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center after she developes a perforated ulcer in her stomach, a complication of the steroid therapy. Surgeons sewed up the hole in the stomach that day.\n\nBut the cancer in her spinal cord and brain continues to worsen. Although a tube was placed in her brain to deliver an anti-cancer drug, a sophisticated but now standard form of therapy for this condition, the lymphoma in her brain does not respond to any therapy. During this period, she loses weight, her speech slows, she is less alert and has difficulty walking.\n\nMay 15, 1994\n\nJackie is photographed walking in Central Park on Sunday - unable to walk very far and needing to be supported by her companion, Maurice Tempelsman.\n\nMay 16, 1994\n\nOn Monday, she develops shaking chills and becomes disoriented. Maurice and a nurse take her to New York Hospital, where she is admitted. Doctors diagnose pneumonia and give her antibiotics by injection. The drug and radiation therapy have weakened her immune system, leaving her vulnerable to infection.\n\nMay 17, 1994\n\nShe rallies initially, but on Tuesday her condition takes a turn for the worse.\n\nMay 18, 1994\n\nOn Wednesday, doctors find that the lymphoma had recurred in her liver, where it had been present earlier. They tell her that the cancer was no longer treatable.\n\nJackie returns to her apartment on Wednesday. Aggressive therapy, including antibiotic treatment of pneumonia that she had developed earlier in the week, are halted in keeping with the wishes Jackie has expressed in a living will.\n\nMay 19, 1994\n\nClose family and friends gather at her 1040 Fifth Avenue to say their final goodbyes. Caroline, John, and Maurice are with her when she passes away at the age of 64 in her bedroom at 10:15 pm.\n\nMay 20, 1994\n\nJohn Jr. descends from the 15th floor apartment where he and Caroline had been raised, stood on the sidewalk where hundreds of reporters, cameramen and well-wishers are gathered and issues a brief statement. \"Last night, at around 10:15, my mother passed on,\" John said. \"She was surrounded by her friends and family and her books and the people and the things that she loved. And she did it in her own way, and we all feel lucky for that, and now she's in God's hands.\"\n\nMay 21, 1994\n\nShe is embalmed in her own master bathroom under the direction of the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel.\n\nJackie is placed in the same model casket that was used for JFK. The casket was manufactured by the Marsellus Casket Company of Syracuse (NY), which had acquired the reputation of being the finest manufacturer of hardwood caskets in America. The \"Seven Ten\" design (which was the company's third most expensive) was chosen for the burial of JFK and several other American presidents (Ford, Nixon, and probably also for Hoover) as well, and therefore became something like an unofficial \"presidential casket\" in the US. Although the model 710 is a plain and unpretentious looking design of timeless simplicity, representing the understatement style of the Eastern elite, it is nevertheless an expensive luxury casket made from solid 1-1/4\" and 2-1/2\" planks of African mahogany. The casket has heavily rounded corners and all wooden swing bar handles with bronze tips and lugs.\n\nHer funeral shroud is unknown, but likely an outfit chosen from her vast wardrobe.\n\nMay 22, 1994\n\nJackie's family, friends and close associates pay their respects at an informal wake in her living room - featuring her closed coffin draped with an antique cloth.\n\nMay 23, 1994\n\nJackie's funeral is held at New York's St. Ignatius Loyola, the Roman Catholic church where Jackie was baptized as an infant and confirmed as a 12-year-old.\n\nAt about 12:45 p.m. her body is transported on a chartered 737 Boeing jet from New York City to Washington, where a motorcade of motorcycles, buses and limousines escorts Jackie through the black iron gates of Arlington National Cemetery. There, in front of a private gathering of fewer than 100 people that included the President and Mrs. Clinton, Jackie, in a mahogany casket covered with ferns and a cross of white lilies-of-the-valley, is laid to rest between her husband Jack and her stillborn daughter. Her son Patrick, who died two days after his birth in 1963, lies on the former President's other side. \"God gave her very great gifts and imposed upon her great burdens,\" said the President during the 11-minute ceremony. \"She bore them all with dignity and grace and uncommon common sense.\"\n\nResearch by Steven L.

That year, she was hospitalized with a concussion and a broken shoulder after being found lying in a Boston street near her home. At her request in 2005, her second cousin, financial planner Webster E. Janssen of Connecticut, established a trust controlling her estate in violation of her sons' guardianship.
