        "text": "Thirty years ago, shortly after the death of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on May 19, her son stood outside and shared his gratitude that his mother had had the chance to pass away “surrounded by her family, her friends and her books—the people and things that she loved. She did it in her own way and on her own terms.”\n\nI’ve always been captivated by those words. Their simplicity and integrity echoed words Jackie herself had once said: “Even though people may be well known, they hold in their hearts the emotions of a simple person for the moments that are the most important of those we know on earth: birth, marriage, and death.”\n\nUnexpectedly simple words, perhaps, coming from a woman who spent decades either up on a pedestal or trying to climb off of one—a woman who described herself as “an outsider….a very hard thing to be in American life.”\n\nJackie Kennedy, center, with President Bill Clinton and John F. Kennedy Jr in 1993.\n\nFirst Ladies can find themselves in the spotlight, but there’s a mystique about who they really are. How does a woman live, work, and breathe in that immensely visible but largely undefined role? What precisely is that role? Does it matter? Are we content with the surface, do we care who these women are in their own right?\n\nJackie eschewed the term First Lady: “it sounds like a saddle horse.” She chose to be called Mrs. Kennedy, or just Jackie. She bemoaned wearing dresses that made her look “like a lampshade” and remarked that her own sartorial ambition was to resemble a marble column.\n\nJackie’s care for her children was fundamental to her character, as was her determination to construct, with measured intention, a relatively normal life for John and Caroline, nurturing in them a spirit of inquiry and a sense of responsibility to the larger world. Caroline has often underscored her mother’s driving passion for literature and language, and noted how that gave rise to her own desire to instill a similar love in her children “because the power of ideas, and the ability to express them, is the greatest power we have.”\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Jr., at center, with his mother and sister, at his graduation from New York University Law School.\n\nJFK once joked that when he asked Jackie to do something or appear for something, she might reply, “Oh yes, Jack. Of course.” Then, she’d proceed to do exactly what she wanted to do, and, as essentially, what she believed was right, whether or not that aligned with her husband’s request. Asked to describe his wife in one word, the word he chose, without missing a beat, was “fey.”\n\nIrreverent and artistic, she projected myriad selves but was a deeply private person, with a nuanced, formidable intellect. She kept in shape on a trampoline, painted watercolors, and made pen-and-ink cartoons. She sketched designs for her own clothes. In her adjacent-to-power role, she was a rigorous master of wielding influence behind the scenes.\n\nAccording to Hellenic scholar Nancy Sultan, “It was Jackie who, quietly at first, and then dramatically and at huge expense, directed, orchestrated, and stage-managed JFK’s new program of cultural development…to make Washington the social and intellectual center of the Country.”\n\nA Kennedy family Christmas at the White House in 1962.\n\nFrom the time Jackie was a child, she loved art, horses, dogs, ballet, the sea. She had skinned knees and inhaled poetry, novels, plays. Tolstoy, Tennyson, Millay; then later, James Baldwin, Arthur Miller, Edna O’Brien. She bit her nails, and read Niebuhr for fun. Her wit was legendary. Sometimes she’d read to keep herself grounded, or aloof—apart from the “political gasses.” The consummate observer, she understood that at the right moment, silence can be a form of action. She'd dog-ear pages in books of philosophy, history, biography, copying out lines from Pindar and Homer, to scribble with editorial notes in the margins of Jack’s speeches. She had a remarkable capacity to harness language in ways that were persuasive, leveling, and just so sharp. This was a tremendous source of her power as she worked to forge her legacy, along with that of her husband’s, though she often preferred to erase her own authorship.\n\nFluent in Spanish, French and Italian, she could seem at ease on stage, but perhaps only found her balance with fame later in life once she’d figured out how to put it in its place. In her two-decade career as a book editor, she prized writers of diverse, eclectic backgrounds—Nobel-winning novelist Naguib Mahfouz, for instance, esteemed in his own country but unpublished in the US until Jackie snapped up translation rights. She championed the work of the artist Peter Sís, and authors Dorothy West and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. But she usually refused to have her name in the acknowledgements, a fact that—given all we think we know—feels new, even integral to a holistic understanding of a woman written into American myth. Jackie was neither cardboard, nor caricature, nor royalty. She was clear that the task of the Fine Arts Work Committee she founded was to restore an integrity to the White House that might express the democratic ideals of a nation, not its exact historical past.\n\nPortrayals of Jackie can fail to show all of this. Instead she is often thought of in easy constructs: Camelot; her clothes, her style, her husband. Yet why is her extraordinary life one we may feel some closeness to? Why do we come back to Jackie’s story again, and again?"
