        "text": "Steven Mnuchin lists swank Park Avenue co-op for $33M\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has just listed the Park Avenue duplex that has been in his family since the 1960s for $32.5 million, the New York Post reports. Mnuchin bought the 12-room, 6,500 square-foot Upper East Side duplex from his aunt for $10.5 million in 2000, so even if the co-op in tony 740 Park Avenue doesn't fetch the ask, he'll pocket a tidy profit. The Rosario Candela-designed building is known for its wealthy residents who have included Rockefellers, Kochs and Bronfmans as well as being Mrs. Onassis' childhood home. The former Goldman Sachs investment banker and Hollywood film producer was based in California before accepting a position with the Trump administration and has never claimed the Park Avenue home as his primary residence.\n\nSee more, this way\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis’s childhood home gets a major price cut to $29.5M\n\nBy Emily Nonko\n\nThere have been some big price chops for an apartment at 740 Park Avenue, one of New York's most iconic co-ops, once lived in by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis herself. The former first lady—whose grandfather developed 740 Park in 1929—lived in this apartment between the ages of two to seven. It is now owned by David Ganek, a hedge fund manager, who has used the Rosario Candela-designed co-op as a home for his impressive modern art collection. He first listed it in 2014 for $44 million, and now it's on its third price chop down to $29.5 million.\n\nTake a look\n\nTimeless Trophy: 740 Park Avenue\n\nBy Dana Schulz\n\nNew York City may have an ever-revolving cast of hottest restaurants, hippest clubs, and even most desirable neighborhoods, but some real estate titans never go out of style in this metropolis. Known as the \"Tower of Power,\" 740 Park Avenue is one such mainstay. The Upper East Side 19-story, Art Deco building was completed in 1930 to the designs of Rosario Candela, often considered the finest architect of luxury apartment interiors, as the last of the grand dames erected along Manhattan's Gold Coast. It didn't reach its peak until the real estate boom of the 1980s, but is today one of the most sought-after addresses with 31 apartments, mostly all duplexes, triplexes, and penthouses. The massively scaled residences feature grand living rooms, formal dining rooms, spiral staircases, high ceilings, expansive foyers, and an abundance of windows.\n\nPlenty more on this timeless trophy residence and its long list of well known inhabitants\n\nFor $65M, this limestone Beaux Arts mansion on the UES is a trophy townhouse for the ages\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nOnly a few of Manhattan's opulent Gilded Age mansions remain standing and possessed of their original splendor. Many have been turned into art galleries and cultural destinations–the Frick Collection, the Cooper Hewitt design museum, and the Morgan Library and Museum–come to mind. This limestone Beaux Arts mansion at 15 East 63rd Street is a rare opportunity to own one of these stunning survivors. Located just off Fifth Avenue and Central Park on the Upper East Side, the palatial eight-level townhouse, asking a trophy-tier $65 million, offers 18,000 square feet of interior space, with an elevator to access every floor.\n\nrevisit the gilded age\n\nFirst look inside Thomas Juul-Hansen’s 850-foot-tall condo Sutton Tower\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nSkyline altering condo Sutton Tower is now complete. New images released this week provide a look inside the Thomas Juul-Hansen-designed 850-foot-tall tower, the tallest in the east-side enclave of Sutton Place. The first skyscraper designed by the Danish designer, Sutton Tower features striking Art Deco-inspired architecture and a facade of Bavarian limestone. For the first time, we're seeing inside the residences, with model units curated by three design teams, Vesta, Urban Casa, and Eichholtz, each to reflect the diversity of lifestyles possible at the building.\n\nsee more\n\nPulitzer Mansion penthouse where real-life Indiana Jones lived lists for $7M\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nA penthouse on the Upper East Side owned by the explorer and naturalist who inspired the character \"Indiana Jones\" hit the market this month. Taking up the top two floors of the Pulitzer Mansion, a Venetian palace-inspired home built for Joseph Pulitzer and converted into co-ops in the 1950s, the penthouse was first owned by Roy Chapman Andrews, an explorer and director of the American Museum of Natural History who is said to have been the model for the adventurous film hero. Asking $6,975,000, the unique duplex at 11 East 73rd Street features oversized living spaces, three bedrooms, and a 750-square-foot private terrace.\n\nsee inside\n\nAsking $6.7M, the Gimbel apartment is the picture of classic Upper East Side elegance\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nThis three-bedroom Upper East Side co-op at 66 East 79th Street was the longtime home of the late philanthropists Bruce and Barbara Gimbel. Bruce was chairman and chief executive of Gimbels, the iconic New York City department store founded in 1842 by his great-grandfather. Asking $6,700,000, this nine-room apartment is both a grand Manhattan residence and a cozy, well-appointed home. Pre-war details like high ceilings, tall windows, and polished herringbone floors frame generously proportioned rooms, updated for gracious 21st-century living.\n\nsee more, this way"
