        "text": "She seems as mysterious and mythical as the Mona Lisa now, far away but never faded away, an icon known by one name: “Jackie.”\n\nBut in the spring of 1963, wrapped in the sandy security blanket of Palm Beach, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy was simply Caroline and John-John’s mom.\n\nShe dipped hard-boiled eggs in vinegar and food coloring for Easter and painted pictures with watercolors and insisted that John F. Kennedy pile the kids into his convertible and drive everyone over to Lilly Pulitzer’s place to get new dresses. She called the Paramount theater to arrange a private showing of Alfred Hitchcock’s new thriller “The Birds” for the teens staying over for the weekend, and let them control the jukebox by the pool.\n\nShe swam and laughed and lounged in her bathing suit on the chaise next to her husband, her fingers entwined with his.\n\n“I remember them holding hands, and I thought, ‘Wow.’ That made an impression on me because I grew up with no public display of emotion — of course, this was not public … it was a perfectly natural scene, just a really natural moment,” remembers Kathy Fay, who was 15 when she and her sister, Sally, and her brother, Paul, flew on Air Force One with their parents and the Kennedys and came to Palm Beach for Easter.\n\nKathy, who now lives in Delray Beach, was sheltered and unsophisticated, she says. To this day, she recalls the “penetrating blue eyes” of President Kennedy, and how he talked to her as if she were the most important person in the world.\n\nIt seems thrilling to think about it now, the rarified experience of spending the weekend on the beach with this “incredibly handsome” president and his “educated and artistic” wife. Think about it: Jackie was just 33 that Easter, six months before an assassin’s bullet shattered her world.\n\nThat’s the thing about golden memories — you don’t know how precious they are until they are gone.\n\nThe Easter the Kennedys came to Palm Beach\n\nKathy’s family became an extension of Jackie’s own. Her father, Paul, known as “Red,” was so close to Kennedy, he was an usher at his wedding. JFK had trained Fay to captain a PTO boat during World War II, and they were assigned to the same base in the South Pacific. When JFK became president, he made Fay the undersecretary of the Navy.\n\nJack Kennedy felt comfortable with Red Fay because they were both Irish-Catholics — one from Massachusetts and one from California. And Red could banter and rough-house with the best of them.\n\n“My dad would throw John-John into the pool over and over, because the president had a bad back and couldn’t do it,” Kathy recalls. Red became a father figure to Jackie’s children after JFK’s murder. But the potential of danger seemed unthinkable on that Easter weekend, when Jackie tied her hair back in a scarf, donned a red-and-white gingham Lilly shift and talked to the children in her whispery voice.\n\nSwim, stroll, play, eat, repeat — this was life for the Kennedys in Palm Beach, from the time patriarch Joseph Kennedy bought his compound on the north end of the island for $120,000 in 1933 until the family sold it for $4.9 million in 1995. A real estate listing at the time said the 1923 Mizner-designed house at 1095 N. Ocean Blvd. featured 200 feet of direct oceanfront and 15,347 square feet of living space, enough room for 11 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. It was most recently sold in 2020 for $70 million.\n\nFor the 1,000 days of JFK’s presidency, the compound was the Winter White House.\n\nThe Kennedys Winter White House\n\n“Everyone in Palm Beach knew the Kennedys were there,” recalls Carolyn Stambaugh, who raised her children nearby on Queens Lane. She married fellow Palm Beach High School grad Reggie Stambaugh in 1965, and he became Rose Kennedy’s optometrist. He paid house calls and told his wife the Kennedy estate was far from grand inside. In fact, it was rather worse for the wear of dozens of Kennedy kids.\n\n“This was Rose’s house, not Jackie’s,” Laurence Leamer wrote in his 933-page book, “The Kennedy Women.” “The home had not been redecorated in decades. The windows still had the blackout curtains from World War II, and the whole house looked like time had ended in the ‘40s.”\n\nIt was here where Jackie recuperated from the premature birth of John Jr. in the months between the 1960 presidential election and the inauguration. And here where she stayed when making frequent vigils to Joe Kennedy’s bedside at St. Mary’s Hospital, after he suffered a stroke on Dec. 19, 1961.\n\n“At times, the first lady was a woman of the most willful manipulativeness, selfish and self-absorbed,” Leamer wrote. “There was also a Jackie who was a woman of exquisite sensitivity and concern. It was this woman who knelt on a footstool in front of Joe and whispered, ‘I’m praying for you every day, Grandpa,’ and kissed his crippled hand.”\n\nA Kennedy family history on the island\n\nThere’s a 1950s photo of Jackie walking next to her father-in-law near the old train station in Palm Beach, the station that used to be next to the Royal Poinciana Hotel, now long gone, too. That hotel is where Rose Kennedy stayed with her father, Boston Mayor John F. Fitzgerald — known as “Honey Fitz” — when she first came to the island in 1911.\n\nHoney Fitz cut quite the swath in Palm Beach himself. Sen. Ted Kennedy visited The Palm Beach Post in 1986 and told a group of editors one of his favorite Palm Beach memories: when Teddy was just 10 or so, Honey Fitz would order him to drive him down the ocean road from the house to The Breakers hotel. There, the old man would throw down a few Scotches without the scrutiny of the Kennedy women, and Teddy would drive his tipsy grandpa back home.\n\nThe senator laughed as he told the story, as if he were replaying it all in his head, all those carefree days when nobody raised an eyebrow at the antics of the Kennedys.\n\nThat would change, of course, in 1991. On that Easter weekend, Ted got himself into trouble when he and his son, Patrick, and his nephew, William Kennedy Smith, partied at Au Bar in Palm Beach, then returned to the Kennedy estate. A woman Smith met at the bar accused him of rape — and the subsequent trial was covered by press from around the world. Smith was acquitted, but the glow of Palm Beach had dimmed for the Kennedys.\n\nJackie and her children continued to visit Rose at the big house into the 1970s, although Jackie had married Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis in 1968. They attended Mass at St. Edward’s, hung out at haunts like Hamburger Heaven, now gone, and swam, like old times.\n\nAfter Onassis’ death in 1975, Jackie became a book editor and author, a woman on her own — and a legend in her own time and beyond.\n\n“The sensational pieces will continue to appear as long as there is a market for them,” she wrote to a friend in 1978. “One’s real life is lived on another private level.”\n\nA life remembered both public and private\n\nToday, the market for anything Jackie remains hot. More than three dozen films have referenced her and more than three dozen books have been written about her. A new book, “Jackie: A Novel,” by Dawn Tripp comes out in June. The publisher, Penguin Random House, calls it “an intimate story of love and power, family and tragedy, loss and reinvention.”\n\nKathy Fay saw Jackie by happenstance in the 1970s, when they bumped into each other on New York’s Upper East Side. Kathy was living in the city, working as a merchandising assistant at Glamour magazine.\n\n“She remembered me right away,” Kathy says. “She remembered my name.”\n\nOf course, she did. She was Caroline and John-John’s mom.\n\nJacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis died in her sleep at her Fifth Avenue apartment on May 19, 1994, of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was just 64.\n\n“She had tried to walk in beauty, leaving her touch on the White House, and on the way that her compatriots looked at their own culture,” Leamer wrote. “She had been the soul of whatever was true about Camelot, an elegant missionary of style and substance, who had left her mark on the social fabric of her nation, while remaining, first of all, a mother.”"
