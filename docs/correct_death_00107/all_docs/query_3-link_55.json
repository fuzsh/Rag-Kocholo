We remember her as a First Lady, an American icon, and one of the strongest women in American history. This Large-scale photomosaic portrait mounted on acrylic is titled JFK vs. Jackie, by artist Alex Guofeng Cao, 2010. The portrait is a famous black and white photograph of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy but each small pixel of the portrait consists of a tiny image of President John F. Kennedy. A small number of the tiny images are different, each one numerically representing an important date in Jacqueline Kennedy’s life. Counting from the top left corner, the 1,956th pixel, is a picture of an angel, representing a child lost. The 1,957th pixel, the year her daughter Caroline was born, is a portrait of Caroline. The 1,999th pixel, the year her son John F. Kennedy Jr. died, is a portrait of her son. The artist uses the interplay between the large image and the tiny pixel images to create a dialogue about the person in the portrait and other people in her life, a story within a story. It currently hangs next to it’s mate of President Kennedy at the Sixth Floor Museum. —Alex Cao Collection, donated in honor of Andres Pastrana, former President of Colombia/The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza #jackiekennedy #americanicons #firstladyjackiekennedy #inmemory\".",
