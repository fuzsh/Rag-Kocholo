Then he taught Boula-Boula, turtle soup, using mock turtle soup! (No turtles were eaten!), and moved to her favorite Poulet a l’estragon (Tarragon Chicken), finally a Soufflé Froid du Chocolate, which is so very unlike how it is made today. Like a lot of dishes in the 60s-80s, gelatin was used in the chocolate soufflé. It was interesting. \n\nJoin us for the next First Ladies Man class, on Mamie Eisenhower on Sunday,June 23. \n\n#firstladies\n#firstladiesman\n#jackiekennedy\n#jacquelinekennedyonassis \n#jackieo\".",
