        "text": "Introduction\n\nOnce Japan was one of the major cinema-loving nations in the world, churning out hundreds of films with many hundreds of millions of cinema admissions every year. Now it is a laggard in the world market even though it can boast some of the best cinemas in the world for the in-situ experience.\n\nIts golden age was across the 1950s (reaching a peak at the end of the decade), as Japan rebuilt itself after the destruction of the Pacific War, the nation regained a place on the world stage, and at least some Japanese films were celebrated globally as masterpieces. This pattern of growth was not seen elsewhere: in countries such as the U.S. (in particular), and the UK saw audience declines in this decade.\n\nPre-War Preamble\n\nOne of the larger but typical Tokyo movie theatres was the Hibiya, located in Yuraku-cho, Chiyoda-ku, and opened on 1st February 1934. The architect was Minishi Abe (1883-1965) and it was designed in a classic art deco style with 1375 seats – making it the smallest of the four cinemas on the nicknamed Hibiya Movie Street. The largest was the massive Nihon Gekijo that could hold 4,000 people and showed not only film programmes but stage shows. The Hibiya and two others were all owned by the Tokyo Takarazuka Theater Co. and run by Kobayashi Ichizo who, having made his money if not fortune in real estate, had turned to the entertainment industry.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the Hibiya area became known as Tokyo’s principle centre of entertainment: Hibiya Public Hall was completed in 1929 and was the first and only music hall in Tokyo at that time. In 1934, the Tokyo Takarazuka Theatre and Hibiya Movie Theatre were opened as well as the other movie theatres. The reason it became a centre was simple: here could be found a high concentration of office workers during the week, and it was a district where families would come to at the weekend for their entertainment and to stroll through Hibiya Park. Kobayashi was a shrewd businessman: he knew where to find the audience, and he also charged low prices to draw in the crowds.\n\nWhen the Hibiya opened, the usual practice in Japan was to run two feature length films per programme, often one new release film and one second release. The programme was changed weekly, rarely fortnightly, and hardly at all were films shown for a longer period. The Hibiya became known for showing foreign films. On the double bill when the theatre opened were two British films City of Song and Waltzes From Vienna, and a Mickey Mouse cartoon. (Mickey had been a feature in Japanese cinemas since the late 1920s.) If there was an irony that same year the Japanese government released an animated propaganda anti-American film that also featured Mickey as the evil enemy. (It had the rather long title Omochabako series dai san wa: Ehon senkya-hyakusanja-rokunen.) Already tensions were beginning to run high between Japan and the U.S. but that didn’t stop the Hibiya across that first year showing over 70 foreign films including King Kong, and from studios including UA, MGM, RKO, Paramount and Fox.\n\nIndeed up until the start of the Pacific War it would usually show sometimes twice as many foreign films as Japanese films annually but from 1942 the showing of foreign films was both banned by the Government but also foreign studios did not want their films exported to the enemy. There was one exception: in 1943, the Navy Ministry violated its own directive and showed Walt Disney’s Fantasia (1940) to Mitsuo Seo 瀬尾光, a Japanese artist and animator. The idea was to produce animated films that would appeal to the public and arouse a sense of patriotism. The first was the 74 minute film Momotarō Umi no Shinpei 神 兵太郎海の神兵 (Momotaro God Warriors of the Sea, 1945) which is considered as the first Japanese full length animated feature film, although it fell far short of Disney’s quality.\n\nThe method of admission had been set for many years and would continue post-war and was known as ‘continuous’ where patrons could be admitted during any part of the programme and continue to watch until they reached the point in the programme where they were first admitted. (Or if they wished they could stay all day.) Programmes would start late morning and would finish at ten in the evening in time to catch the subway or a tram home.\n\nWar Time\n\nIn 1939 the Japanese government enacted laws that meant they could control the film industry not least because they needed to control the use of diminishing raw materials – as seen for example in the cancellation of the 1940 Olympic Games because of a shortage of steel. This led to a forced a reorganisation of the film industry leading to closure of many production studios, distributors and theatres. This restructuring would define the industry in the post-war era and it would be characterised by vertical integration with a close link between production, distribution and exhibition with the now reduced number of six main studios each having their own distribution networks and owning their own cinema chains.\n\nDuring the war years internal censorship by the studios was strong. Krusawa Akira was interviewed in 1981 and he said that many of his ideas were rejected and that ‘there was no freedom of expression during the war.’ However, he acknowledged that paradoxically the military did play a role in advancing Japanese films during the war. ‘Before the war the themes and settings of films were very limited. With the advent of the strong army and navy the authorities wanted us to go into new areas – for example they wanted us to make a film in the shipyards, which nobody had done before.’ Films were no longer seen as popular entertainment (minshu goraku) but national entertainment (kokumin goraku) that supported the cause of the military\n\nIn 1942 the number of cinemas had peaked at 2300 (as did attendances at around 500,000) but thereafter many were destroyed by bombing or were closed, matched by a precipitous decline in attendances so that only 1000 cinemas were present at the end of the Pacific War, and attendances were negligible. A massive programme of rebuilding cinemas was put in place by the studios and by the end of the ‘forties cinema attendance was almost twice what it had been before the war.\n\nOccupation\n\nCinemas in the immediate years after the war continued to be organised into three tiers: the newly built first-tier cinemas had the most expensive ticket prices and showed the most recent films; the usually older second- and third-tier cinemas showed equally older films, and were often described as being rowdier, often rather smelly if seated near the toilets, with shabbier surroundings, and using antiquated equipment. In the UK they would have been called the flea-pits. In 1946, with the allied forces in occupation, thirty-nine American films, five foreign films of non-American origin (all imported before the war) and sixty-seven Japanese films were screened in cinemas. Obviously the resurgence in the showing of foreign films also came about to cater for the occupiers and this would remain the case for some years.\n\nThe Americans also appointed their own censor. Kurosawa again described him as ‘very mean spirited and leftist.’ One of his films, The Men Who Tread on the Tiger’s Tail shot in 1945, was banned from public showing because it was considered ‘feudalistic.’ However this first censor was ultimately replaced by one who was more moderate, and finally the film was shown.\n\nWithout Kurosawa’s knowledge Rashomon was entered into the 1951 Venice International Film Festival and created something of a sensation by taking the Grand Prix prize. This along with Himeyuri-no-to (Tower of Lilies) heralded perhaps a new epoch for Japanese moviemakers. Rashomon showed it was possible to get international distribution and became a (short) period when some superb films including Ikiru and Yasujiro Ozu’s Tokyo Story were made. Kurosawa went on to make Ikuru in 1952.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly in the first few years of the 1950s decade, war films (but usually based on somewhat depressing stories) were popular. Tomoyuki Yamashita for example told the story of General Yamashita who was executed as a war criminal. The Allied Occupation Forces (AOF) from 1945-52 vetted script ideas and besides being strict about the nature of war films also discouraged production of jedaigeki (period dramas) which might promote feudal values (as noted above). At the beginning of the Occupation, they had also circulated the Memorandum Concerning Elimination of Japanese Government Control of the Motion Picture Industry indicating that the cinema was seen as a means to ‘educate’ and ‘reorient’ Japanese viewers. The AOF wanted to strengthen a belief in democracy, the rights of everyone and to eliminate any vestige of Emperor worship.\n\nDuring the days of the Occupation, when the audience was not watching feature films they might well be watching one of four hundred short educational films produced by the Civil Information and Education Section (CIE) which had been formed by the U.S. Occupation Forces. The films had a single purpose: to teach the Japanese about the new way of life they could now adopt both individually, as a family and as a county. CIE ordered the Ministry of Education to set up audio-visual libraries in each Prefecture and the films were loaned to schools, companies and various public and private organisations. They were also screened in cinemas before the main bill and it would appear that the films were enjoyed and rarely interpreted as outright propaganda.\n\nMost of the shorts were imported from the U.S. and subtitled but some 50 CIE films were produced in Japan itself dealing with topics such as democratic reforms, the modernisation of everyday life, and Japan’s relationship with the outside world. One of the more famous was For A Bright Home Life/Akurui katei seikatsu (1950) that showed two schoolgirls on a project to modernise their parents’ Japanese home.\n\nAfter the Occupation\n\nHowever after the occupation had ended, war films that portrayed Japan in a more heroic light became well-liked and a commercial success particularly among men who found they could relive their experiences. A broader audience was also attracted to them as they were able to learn for the first time what had happened during the war as government censorship had banned anything but positive news. Most of these films though would features stories about the conflict in the Pacific and not in Manchuria, for perhaps obvious reasons, as the former was heroic, the latter brutal repression.\n\nBoth foreign and Japanese feature films were popular in the early years of the 1950s as Japanese studios still had to crank up production so in 1952, 186 foreign films were exhibited (143 from the U.S., 13 British, 9 French, and the rest from ten other countries), and 261 Japanese films. The relatively large imports of American films over other countries was in part because the American Occupying forces had set import quotas by country, these naturally favoured the U.S., and the quotas remained in place after they left. The American films too were seen as a means to help educate the Japanese into western moral values where good always overcame evil, and where the common man was not shackled by authoritarian governments or institutions.\n\nTwo of the most popular was Cecil B deMille’s The Greatest Show On Earth, and the Marilyn Monroe vehicle Niagra. There was even a short 3-D horror film boom – as there was in the U.S. – but this did not last.\n\nBy 1953, the local film industry was beginning to grow in prosperity and there was a boom in film making and cinema building. Some of this could be attributed to the lack of other low cost entertainment options, with cinema tickets costing usually between Y50 and Y100. ‘A trip to the movies’ would be seen as the de facto entertainment option not least because many of the modern comforts of home living were still missing and a trip to the cinema was a means of spending time in a comfortable environment – in the winter it would be warm and in the summer cool. However not everything was comfortable. There was no limit to the number of people who could be admitted so besides those who had seats, others sat and stood in the aisles. However over time a rather more refined seating reservation system was introduced.\n\nIn 1953 the first CinemaScope film was released in Japan: The Robe opened simultaneously in Tokyo and Osaka and was a major hit despite being a biblical story, historically a type of film that had not done well in the largely non-Christian Japan.\n\nPart of the cinema’s popularity was further fuelled by the number of film magazines that were available. Kinema Junpo (キネマ旬報, Kinema Junpō), commonly called Kinejun (キネ旬), was Japan’s oldest having begun publication in July 1919. Among the others were general interest magazines covering a broad range of topics, fan magazines devoted to stars and studios, film criticism (Eiga Hyoron was the most admired), and trade magazines covering production and box-office trends. Another unique characteristic of the Japanese market was that film scripts were readily available both of Japanese and imported films (the latter in translation.) Whole scripts would usually be published in magazines. TV too had yet to make huge inroads and the film industry was still churning out low budget features of no great merit but which seemed to satisfy the audiences’ demands.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, the number of cinemas had now grown to an around 4,400 but it should be noted that most were found in the larger cities and it was estimated that possibly one-third of the population were not within easy reach of a screen. To overcome this problem a touring movie programme was set up using the 16mm projectors that had been left behind by the U.S. forces and once used to show the CIE films. This meant that features could be shown to the people who were still too far away from a convenient cinema. Demand for films seemed insatiable and cinema owners were now having to put together programmes rotating three or four features. Hence the need to churn out films – at this time over 300 annually – that were mainly low budget schlock. This demand also led to double features in the first run theatres showing two new films rather than the old practice of one new and one second release.\n\nIn addition there was the rise of the Toei Studio who concentrated not just on film production and distribution but were the leaders in creating the celebrity cult of the movie star, and in particular ones that appealed to teenagers. They began to market stars using the same techniques as Hollywood with photographs that enhanced their physical rather than their acting charms – particularly when it came to starlets. Magazines like Kindai Eiga and Eiga Fan featured an often limitless number of personality pieces, behind-the-scenes profiles, and star-packed photo shoots. No different of course to the movie mags in the west. Stars were photographed in a glamorous, modern world of beach parties, beautiful homes, and fast cars beyond the imagination and experience of the vast majority of the population yet at the same time it was always explained that these were people who held traditional values and came from humble backgrounds. Seeing the popularity of Disney they had also set up their own animation studio\n\nAnother mini-boom came from the popularity of films based on successful radio shows, usually sentimental melodramas such as Kimi-no-nawa. Made in 1953, Machiko and Haruki are destined not to meet after an initial encounter in an air raid shelter. When at last they find each other, Haruki has to part for Europe. They would be best described as cheap third-rate productions but they brought in the audience with numbers reaching 4 million admissions by 1954. Kimi-no-nawa itself was so popular that two further sequels were filmed.\n\nThis was also the year that Seven Samurai (1954) came to the market. Shot by Kurasawa of course it had cost Y100 million to make. Compare this though to an average budget of Y15 million, with most films being shot in twenty days and then post-production taking a further 5 days. Most films too were shot in black and white but among film makers there was increasing interest in the Eastman process and Gate of Hell, by Teinosuke Kinugasa, was the first movie that filmed using the process.\n\nNikkatsu, a small studio that had started out as a production studio then for a period of time operated solely as a distributor had now moved back into film production in June 1954, shooting popular movies that would appeal to teenagers and young adults. They became known as Sun Tribe (taiyozoku) films and depicted teenagers who rejected the stuffy morals of the past in favour of women, money and violence, and a louche life-style that centred on the beach. They represented a complete rejection of their parent’s past, the values of the American occupation, and had been first brought into culture through the books of Ishihara Shintaro (later to become a controversial governor of Tokyo). Weekly magazines jumped on the bandwagon of the taiyozoku and published erotically-charged stories of Japan’s angry and highly sexed youth and in fact the term was used before it was applied to the Sun Tribe films.\n\nSeason of the Sun (Taiyo no kistsu) 1956 was about a boxer who gets his girlfriend pregnant, while Punishmemnt Room (Shokei no heya) also 1956 dramatised a college student who drugged a woman with sleeping pills before raping her. Crazed Fruit (Kurutta kajitsu) was possibly the most controversial of the Sun Tribe films with sex scenes between the heroine and two young insolent brothers but importantly cinematically employing such then-startling camera techniques as aerial shots, and backed by a jazz soundtrack partnered with Hawaiian-style music (and gaudy Hawaiian shirts). Not only were the public outraged (the older public that is) but so were the government and they threated to bring in severe censorship restrictions. However the industry promised they would enact their own self-regulating and stricter censorship code and the government backed-off.\n\nCrazed Fruit made a star of Ishihara Yujiro (the brother of the book’s author) who, with his bad-boy demeanour, would become the studio’s hottest property. His success was put down to his depiction of the typical post-war Japanese youth: unreserved, unrestrained, and loved by women. Over the next couple of years he made six films and also won an award as best newcomer. He was later also popular as a singer.\n\nThere was a mini Audrey Hepburn boom among young people with the late release of Roman Holiday. This also tapped into the love of French films among cinema audiences not least because they showed the romantic side of Paris, a destination that they could still not travel to and could only dream of visiting. A year later another Hepburn vehicle Love In The Afternoon (1957) was a big hit. Her popularity was then matched by Bridget Bardot and her film Une Parisienne (1957), although it would never wain.\n\nDisney was now big business in Japan having made solid progress year-on-year after the war. School would take parties of kids to see the films not least because the short films were seen as being highly educational. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had been first shown in 1950 but the downside of their products’ popularity was that their TV shows would also be broadcast later in the decade.\n\nConversely by 1957 Japanese audiences were tiring of American westerns not least because the American film companies had been importing second or even third grade films.\n\nAfter some hesitation about releasing the film in Japan perhaps surprisingly Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) was a huge hit along with its theme tune that could be heard on the street from whistling salarymen. Giant (1956) was also popular not least because of the Japanese teenager’s admiration for James Dean. Ever since East of Eden had been shown Dean-san had been the most widely loved film star among the youth of Japan. Books about him and picture albums sold well. After his death no other foreign actor had achieved the same appeal and even Elvis was less popular even though his films had been shown widely.\n\nAmong the older Western stars James Stewart, William Holden, and Yul Brynner enjoyed widesperead appeal with the latter being particularly popular among middle-aged women. However women were a smaller section of the cinema going audience: The Sunday Audience Survey conducted by the Six Domestic Film Company Production Materials Survey Group (Hōga Rokusha Seisaku Shiryo Chōsa Kai No Nichiyō Kankyaku Chōsa) showed that the total female audience peaked in 1956 with a turnout of 37.4 per cent.\n\nThe biggest Japanese hit in in 1957 was The Emperor Meiji and the Russo-Japanese War. This was the biggest box-office hit in Japan since the war exceeding even Gone With The Wind. The film was colour and in wide-screen and was a spectacle that tugged at the Japanese patriotic hearts and brought excitement through its gory battle scenes. It was also in 1957 that Marlon Brando came to Japan to film Sayonara, spending most of his time in Kyoto.\n\nAt this time local singer-actresses became popular: one of the highest paid singers was the 21 year old Hibari Misora who had started acting and singing as a 10 year-old.\n\nIn 1958 Ko Inagaki won the Grand Prix at the Venice Film festival with his picture Muhomatsu no Issho (Rickshaw Man) which also did well among the home audience.\n\nBy 1958 two theatres in Japan had been converted to the ultra wide screen Cinerama format, one in Tokyo and one in Osaka but the first feature to be shown, Around the World in 80 Days, was a surprising failure. Other films that had been less successful than anticipated were the American films shot in location in Japan such as the John Wayne vehicle The Barbarian and the Geisha, and Escapade in Japan. (The studios had to spend their Yen on something.) This was put down to the quality of the films and the fact that they rarely captured the true essence of Japanese life. One exception was Brando’s Sayonara. Miyoshi Umeki won an Oscar for her performance and she was also a popular ballad singer going under the stage name Nancy Umeki. The aforementioned Yujiro Ishihara had another hit in early 1958 with The Man Who Brings The Storm, an action drama with the touch of the thriller.\n\nJapan had produced 514 films in 1956, 443 in 1957, 504 in 1958 and by the end of the decade film production was nearing 600 annually as studios tried to hold back the march of TV. There were now over 5 million TV sets in the country up from 2 million just eighteen months previously. High-end models even came with hand-held remote controllers but the main reason for TV’s surging popularity was they were broadcasting baseball games and sumo – the two national sports. The studios were worried.\n\nOverall the standard of local films was said by critics at the time to be not high with only 20 at most being deemed good enough to compete on the international film festivals. Unsurprising really as the handful of major studios were having to mass produce two feature films a week. This was exacerbated by changes being made to programming in an attempt to maintain audience numbers: double-features now back as the norm in at least the first run cinemas. Most films were now shot in the wide screen format but colour only accounted for around 30 per cent but this was leading to increased production costs and by 1958 it was costing on average Y29 million to shoot in black and white, and Y35m to shoot in colour. 70mm productions had yet to appear. The number of cinemas had now increased to 7,100 and it was been calculated that the average person in Japan from teenagers upwards was going to the cinema at least once a month.\n\nThe trend to produce films dealing with crime, sex and violence showed no sign of letting up – noting that this was also a trend seen in the rising popularity of cheap novels and trashy magazines. Some blamed the sex scenes prevalent in French films but all films were supposedly adhering to the industry’s code of ethics known as Eirin. In 1959 the cuts recommended by the censors (and they were always carried out by the producers) included 99 bedroom scenes, rape and and other scenes of sex; 83 cuts for the use of obscene words; and 75 showing extreme violence.\n\nThe other trend was films of a historical nature with lots of gory sword flights between samurai. War films were also riding in popularity including one film about the attack on Pearl Harbor, The Storm of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAlthough cinema production was dominated by the big studios there were independent productions often directed by left-wing intellectuals and who were known to produce more noteworthy films such as Kiku an Isamu written by Yoko Mizuki and directed by Tadashi Imai. It was the story that tackled head-on one Japan’s social problems, namely the presence of numerous illegitimate children born to members of the American Occupation Force. Another was Nianchan about four Korean children growing up in the drab poverty in a mining town in Kyushu.\n\nForeign films continued to pull in the audiences, and 200 were shown in theatres as the decade came to a close. While the U.S. still dominated, French films were growing in popularity mirroring an upsurge in interest of French singers, chanson and contemporary songs. Yves Montand and Juliette Gerco were two favourites. Of the U.S. films the most popular had been The Horse Soldiers, South Pacific, Solomon and Sheba, Rio Bravo, The Big Country, and North By Northwest. Popular French films included Les Amants, Faibles Femmes, Les Tricheuses, and Les Etoiles du Midi.\n\nThen finally opening in the last few days of 1959 was Ben Hur which was to enjoy phenomenal success and unusually was expected to be shown for the next twelve months.\n\nBut as noted above 1959-1960 was the peak in terms of both attendances and the number of cinemas and thereafter a steady decline was seen.\n\nSources\n\nA History of Movie Theaters and Audiences in Postwar Kyoto, the Capital of Japanese Cinema.
