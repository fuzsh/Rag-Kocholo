        "text": "Well folks, a day we have been anticipating, is upon us. Late last year the Criterion Collection announced that they would be releasing one of their larger, most comprehensive box sets collecting almost all of Akira Kurosawas film. Almost all? The huge hole in the collection was his 1985 samurai epic, Ran. Previously available as a two disc Criterion edition, the films rights mysteriously went to Lionsgate, under their “StudioCanal Collection.” Lionsgate soon released images of their three initial releases under this new banner: The Ladykillers, Ran, and Jean-Luc Godard’s Contempt (Le Mepris). Contempt was another double disc Criterion release that many hold to be among Godards best.\n\nA few weeks back we learned that Criterion would soon lose the rights to many other their films which were owned by StudioCanal. Included in this announcement was the shocker that they would lose Jean Renoir’s Grand Illusion, Criterion Collection #1.\n\nToday, February 16th, Lionsgate is releasing the first of this StudioCanal Collection Films on Blu-ray. If you are interested in seeing a breakdown of the packaging for the films, check out this previous post."
