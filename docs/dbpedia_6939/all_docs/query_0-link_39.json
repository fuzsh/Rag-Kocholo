Shakespeare's story is built on all the elemental themes which have characteristically interested Kurosawa: greed, betrayal, and disloyalty to codes of personal honor. In Kurosawa's hands these themes become contemporary and expansive despite the fact that the film is set in feudal Japan. Ultimately, Kurosawa achieves this universality because Ran is an almost complete marriage of content and style.\n\nKurosawa turns to many of the stylistic techniques that have come to be associated with his career. Sweeping panoramas, rich and powerful shot composition, and dramatic depth within the frame accomplished by combinations of back and foreground action and layers of synchronously recorded sound are the building blocks out of which Ran grows. For example, Kurosawa creates conflict and dynamism within the frame with contrapuntal movement. When troops are laying siege to the aging warlord's castle, regiments of samurai pass in front of the camera, some running horizontally, others directly away from or directly toward the camera. There is a sense of chaos that is heightened by the red and yellow banners each soldier wears according to his allegiance. Visually the battle is a melee of red and yellow banners blowing freely, falling out of sight as troops fall, and finally the yellow are simply engulfed by the red.\n\nShot composition has also been one of the earmarks of Kurosawa's career. While many modern filmmakers have gone to the moving camera as a staple of their visual style, Kurosawa has remained loyal to the still frame and stationary camera. Ran is little different in this regard, since essentially it is constructed from a series of still frames, each one a painting come to life. During the battle at the warlord's castle, for example, the shots of troops rushing to do battle are juxtaposed with still shots of bodies heaped on top of each other and battlements burning in silent agony. Each of these shots is composed with an eye to detail and maximizing its power while it is on the screen.\n\nThe true technical virtuosity of Ran, though, lies in the post-production stage. The power inherent in the visuals is given depth and dimension when the externals—elements such as sound effects and music—are added. As the captain of the warlord's army dies, for example, he calls out to his master, \"We are truly in hell.\" As he does, the sounds of battle are replaced by a tranquil, orchestral theme which plays point-counterpoint with the ongoing images of death and destruction. It is as if we are truly standing back watching hell rise up until that moment when we are brought back to the film's present by screams from within it.\n\nIt has been said that Akira Kurosawa's work in the work of images, and is therefore concerned not with things but with ideas and metaphors. This being the case, in Ran the still frame is the world that has grown stagnant and is being destroyed from within by the visual turmoil. The film ends with a shot of the warlord's greedy, traitorous daughter-in-law standing on a mountain peak watching the return of troops that have slaughtered her allies. At the moment when the camera holds her in long shot, eclipsing a blood-red sunset, we too are standing on the precipice, a footfall away from falling into the abyss.\n\n—Rob Winning"
