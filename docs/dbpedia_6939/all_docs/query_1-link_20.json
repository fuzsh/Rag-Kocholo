        "text": "After the raid on Pearl Harbor, there were still about 120,000 Japanese-Americans living in the United States. In order to prevent panic and hysteria against Japanese-Americans, President Roosevelt ordered that 110,000 Japanese pack their things and move to internment camps for the nation’s safety. After this, ordinary Americans turned their backs to their Japanese-American friends. There was a sudden prejudice and fear of these people, who in fact posed a minimal threat. According to Holt McDougal’s The Americans, “about two thirds were Nisei, or Japanese people born in this country of parents who emigrated from Japan” (McDougal). Nisei had American nationalities, many had never stepped foot on Japanese soil, but the American people believed that these true Americans were loyal to a nation they had never even laid eyes on, purely because their President had told them\n\nBut the Japanese people know when they are beaten. We are shown this, by how the Japanese surrendered after the bombs dropped. If the fighting had progressed another year. If the war effort was still going on. Only then there would be a possibility that the Japanese would surrender. At this point reconstruction would be much easier because the Japanese gave it their everything and still lost. In this alternative timeline peace would be much easier to achieve once the war was won. This is because the Japanese have respect for their enemies. This is just another Japanese tradition.\n\nFrom the fighting styles of the Japanese and the way American culture differed from the Japanese culture, readers can infer that the two battling countries had many different beliefs and values. These beliefs and values were put on display even before the warriors were flying to Pearl Harbor and ruthlessly fighting battles on the islands in the Pacific. The Japanese were taught as young kids about the weak and inferior westerns, and the militarism of Imperial Japan was introduced into schools with the political views and military lessons implemented into schools teachings for kids and teens. After being taught of these weak westerners who were inferior to them, the males at the age of 17 were drafted to go fight the Americans or Chinese, or some even in Europe. John Bradley shows readers the brutality of the\n\nTo begin, they decided to go to war with two of the most powerful industrial and naval forces, the US and Britain, during Japan’s attempted Occupation of Indochina (now Indonesia) from the 22nd to the 26th of September 1940, even though they knew it was impossible to win. All because it was either that or surrender, and they thought that would make them look weak. That, and during all of their battles, they would fight to the death even though they knew they had no chance of winning. They would much rather commit suicide than surrender, as dictated by the “Bushido” code, or the “Way of the Warrior” or Samurai. According to Bushido, it was “preferable to commit suicide rather than suffer the disgrace of being captured by the enemy.” [3]. Putting pride before ethical, logical and effective decisions by the Imperial Japanese Army caused their own downfall in\n\nHe attempts, and succeeds, in shocking readers into remembering their school experiences in a more negative light, achieved by juxtaposing the strict Prussian military system with our current educational environment. Gatto has no quarrels mentioning the rigid segregation this system is especially tailored to create between the powerful, yet numerically minute, elite and a gargantuan working class forced into general servitude. The sensitivity of such a topic and the long history of social stratification the United States has endured forces readers to understand that, beneath the colorful language and indefatigable tone, this article is a very serious analysis of educational corruption and the abuse of social class as it relates to educational background. A focal point of Gatto’s argument remains the already apparent lack of individuality within school systems. He does not write about how constricting school uniforms can be to an identity or the ability to express oneself being diminished. No, Gatto concerns himself, and his readers, with how students are treated as machines by administrative staff in schools. Students are to be pass produced, manufactured using interchange parts and fixed when something does not fit the mold. He writes about how children are used from the second they enter kindergarten as small cogs in a larger machine of conformity, a machine which exists purely to prevent the elite from being forced of their high horses. Stringing each of the myriad arguments he makes regarding the motive schools hide behind an encouraging positivity together into a magnificent tapestry of dissent, Gatto forces readers to reevaluate their own perspective on one of the most singularly fundamental aspects of their life and\n\nIt would be near insanity to say Letters from Iwo Jima constitutes an everyday war movie. Clint Eastwood not only created a film that sympathizes with the Japanese, but also acknowledges the fact that both the Japanese and Americans were wrong. The Japanese assumed Americans were cowardly fools and the Americans had been taught the Japanese were mindless imperial machines. These stereotypes are quickly cast aside as viewers of this movie acquaint themselves with Saigo and his friends. However, although this movie effectively accomplishes its goals, it still contains many inaccuracies. These errors eventually culminate to the point that the movie may seem sensationalized or even overly dramatized at points. More importantly, the\n\nThere is one scene where the three flag raisers entered a crowded stadium before a football game which typified how an image of war can be so different to the reality of war. The flash photography, the cheering, the roar of the crowd all went to John Bradley’s head and he had flash backs of the fighting on Iwo Jima and the genuine heroes that he had left behind. This scene contrasts what the reality of war, were all the men are dug in and fighting for there life, and the images of war. Ira Hayes says “I know it’s a good thing, raising the money and that, ‘cause we need it. But, I can’t take them calling me a hero. All I did was try not to get shot. Some of the things I saw done, things I did, they weren’t things to be proud of, you know?” Clint Eastwood shows continuously, through his characters physiology shows how one single photo can be so different what really makes up the battle of Iwo Jima. The aim was to get war bonds; the minds of the three main characters through Clint Eastwood’s directing showed a strong insight to how the reality of a war and an image of war can be so contrasting.\n\nMawi’s school in the refugee camp was harsh and abusive. It would be horrifying if a teacher could beat you for no apparent reason. I don’t understand the cruelty those teachers have towards the children, especially since the are already dealing with so much trauma. For example Mawi explains in his writing how a teacher beat him for having more right answers than his son. How could adults be so cold hearted to assault emotionally distraught children? In this century and country physical punishment in school has been outlawed. This circumstance makes me realize how lucky students in America are. We are well educated, technologically advanced, and cared for by our teachers. This chapter has made me realize the blessed I am to live in America where we have exceptional education.\n\nThe propaganda in World War II was used in defense of deference and favoritism for each country. Moreover, defensive side was shown and illustrated in both nationalities. Japan was showing the fight for their land and the United States was more concentrated in the deliberate attack on Pearl Harbor. Racist was legal in the United States at that time and was input in some signboard. Also, the increased comments in different races were shown in the propaganda between Nazi, Japanese’s and Americans. As a matter of fact, the Japanese were more for moral and pure; if they have to die or be killed by the enemy to obtain superiority will be proud. Also said, American was scared to die because they believed dying is definitively the loss of the spirit.\n\nIt was like a competition between the two nations and after they saw how Japanese were so prepare for the total war, Americans needed to be ready and ready to get back on the higher position than Japanese. For this film, the entire sense of emotional responses was mainly to trigger the rage among Americans, as stated in the film, “American had their own stupid way of living” and “your world was more made of believe rather than reality.” There were multiple indications of no matter how Americans destroy Japan, the hearts of Japanese were indestructible. They were neither working by the clock nor earning more money, but only working to win the\n\nMr President, After carefully reviewing all options and research it would not beneficial to implement the purge as a matter to decrease crime. There are fundamental principles that most everyone working or researching within the criminal justice field can agree on. Among those principles is that crime is never going to stop. Allowing a twelve hour period where there are no laws is not going to lower the crime rate to a negligible amount during the other 8,760 hours of the year. While “The Purge” is an interesting movie it has flaws in the foundations of its core benefits.\n\nThis mindset is great if they were actually winning the war, but that’s the issue. They were losing really badly but they had the will to fight to the death. In fact, in that same documentary it talks about how Japanese soldiers were to commit suicide or die in combat before they were to be taken as POW’s. Their government convinced them that it was honorable to die in war and there was no honor to be taken captive by these Americans.\n\nperfect example of the Japanese battle attitude. Japanese pilots would strap themselves into planes loaded with explosives and fly them into American ships. By the war&amp;#8217;s conclusion the Japanese kamikaze attacks had sunk 3 aircraft carriers, damaged 285 craft and sunk a total of 34. The Japanese also did well in increasing support for the war effort. &amp;#8220;Both scientist and publicists were in fact powerful instruments inflaming popular hatred against the democratic countries and in regimenting the people into blindly supporting the war of aggrandizement (Ferrell 16).'; This resolve would only have been strengthened had American and Russian forces tried to invade Japan. This almost suicidal type of fighting would have resulted in a tremendous amount of casualties for both sides. American casualties alone were projected at 500,000. The amount of deaths caused by an invasion would easily dwarfed those of the atomic bombings (Purcell 82)."
