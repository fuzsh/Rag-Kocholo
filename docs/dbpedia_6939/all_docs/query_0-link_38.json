        "text": "The Hurt Locker (2008)\n\nIf you were following every film release in 2008 and somehow missed seeing “The Hurt Locker,” there’s a reason. It premiered in 2008 but never received a wide release until a year later. The movie centers on a bomb squad unit during the Iraq War. The plot is tense and unpredictable, fittingly as if a bomb could literally explode any minute.\n\nIt also presents a slightly troubling truth – that certain people and their personalities thrive on the rush of war. The thrill of conflict attracts many people to enlist and they choose not to consider the horrors of war. Adrenaline and excitement overshadow the realities of long-lasting trauma and terror. “The Hurt Locker” may have gained traction a year after its release but the film got its due and won the 2009 Best Picture at the Oscars.\n\nThe Battle of Algiers (1966)\n\nGillo Pontecorvo’s “The Battle of Algiers” depicts the conflict between Algerian rebels and the French government during the Algerian War. What strikes you immediately about the film is its distinct documentary style and feel. Pontecorvo hired several non-professional actors and shot the film on location.\n\nThe dedication to realism extends to the narrative as well since the film lays bare the often-barbaric acts on both sides of the conflict – tactics including torture and the targeted bombing of civilians. Pontecorvo set out to make a politically neutral film, and while it’s true the film takes no sides, it does play out like a horror film. In keeping the tone objective, the film cannot but help highlight the atrocities of war, whether one likes it or not. Victory for any side always comes at a terrible price.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies (1988)\n\nAnime isn't your conventional medium for a war film but Japan knows what it's doing as per usual! “Grave of the Fireflies” is a poignant story about two children who become orphans by the time WWII ends. It is a heartbreaking tale of them trying to survive and fend for themselves. The war has ended. Japan is on the brink of defeat.\n\nWhat happens to children of war when their families and lives are torn apart? “Grave of the Fireflies” paints a soul-crushing picture of widespread desolation, misery, and despair. Innocence and joy have long abandoned this land and all that remains is a gravesite. The film is easily one of the greatest, most impactful anti-war films of all time. Cinema was elevated. Magic happens when anime — traditionally light and enchanting — meets oppressive subjects like war.\n\nGallipoli (1981)\n\nHistory books have documented numerous geo-political reasons for war. But what does war mean for the young people on the frontlines? Guided by idealism, most of them sign up for a war they don’t quite understand. “Gallipoli” shines a light on this crushing reality. The movie is about two runners – young, hopeful, and looking for an adventure.\n\nThey become best friends and sign up for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps — a promising overseas stint. The reality is anything but. The wide-eyed boys are instead dispatched to the Gallipoli peninsula where the Turkish army already has a distinct advantage. “Gallipoli” shows in heartbreaking detail how war destroys the youth. Many don’t know what they’re signing up for, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nThe Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943)\n\nReleased in the middle of WWII, “The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp” is a sketch of a type of British military man deemed out of date. Cartoonist David Low first created the character of Colonel Blimp back in 1934. Blimp is out of shape and somewhat slow – traits now considered undesirable in the British military. The film details the character’s origin story, but most of all, it is a defense of Colonel Blimps everywhere who deserve a place in Britain’s military history.\n\nThe film stars Roger Livesey as Clive Candy – a seasoned British soldier who finds himself at odds with the younger crop of soldiers. Rules and tradition mean nothing to this lot. How times have changed! Candy’s character embodies what England aspired to in theory – fair play, civility, and dignity in war.\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nAn epic war adventure film, \"Lawrence of Arabia\" had incredible cinematography. This film is directed by David Lean and is based on the life of British archaeologist and army officer, T.E. Lawrence. It follows and documents the officer’s experiences throughout the Ottoman Empire, such as his attacks on Damascus and Aqaba.\n\nAt the 35th Academy Awards show in 1963, the film was nominated for a total of ten Oscars — and won seven of them. The wins include the awards for Best Director and Best Picture. If that wasn't reason enough to watch it, this film also scores 94% on the Tomatometer.\n\nCome and See (1985)\n\n“Come and See” isn’t just the most well-known Russian language film, it’s also one of the most visceral anti-war films in history. We meet a protagonist named Florya — a young boy drawn to the resistance movement against German forces during WWII. He joins the cause and enlists with a group of fighters when things go horribly wrong.\n\nFlorya finds himself at a crossroads, forced into a violent conflict that threatens to destroy his soul. If nightmares were films, “Come and See” is a strong contender. It doesn't contain the most violent scenes visually. What it achieves is an unflinching depiction of the psychological implications of war – harsh, devastating, and beyond repair.\n\n1917 (2019)\n\n“1917” is a stellar war film for several reasons. The filmmakers wanted the film to appear as if it was shot in one long take – nothing but challenging when you have an extensive cast and crew. For perspective, the film had a $100 million budget and 1000 people as extras! However, the single-take approach paid off since it conveyed a sense of urgency in the film.\n\nThe film’s story, after all, is a race against time. Two soldiers sneak into enemy territory to deliver a critical message that could save hundreds of lives. Director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins created a gripping narrative and a one-shot format that would inspire a whole new generation of filmmaking.\n\nSergeant York (1941)\n\n“Sergeant York” is a biopic of Alvin York’s military service. Director Howard Hawk traces York’s final steps towards reckoning — from someone raising hell in the Tennessee forests into a soldier willing to sacrifice everything for the greater good. The journey isn’t easy. He struggles with his religious beliefs which he believes are at odds with fighting. And then, there is his anger – an all-consuming rage that threatens to take over.\n\nThe film is a moving account of a man’s deepest internal struggles and his transformation. But its depiction of the Army is far-fetched, almost delusional. You don’t go to the army to question life’s purpose or whether war is worth it. York miraculously finds this space in the army, which in the film, is an institution that cares for the happiness of its soldiers.\n\nThe Longest Day (1962)\n\n“The Longest Day” is an adaptation of a successful 1959 book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan. The movie rights sold for a staggering $1.75 million in today's money – making it one of the highest figures for any adaptation. The film was an enormous undertaking, an international production depicting D-Day from multiple perspectives that needed five screenwriters and three directors!\n\nAs for the cast, the dizzying lineup included John Wayne, Rod Steiger, Sean Connery, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, and Robert Ryan, among a dozen others! The film also featured 750 soldiers who had fought in WWII. The story is meticulous and unravels in a documentary style. With real-life stories and perspectives informing the narrative, “The Longest Day” is arguably one of the most authentic war films ever made.\n\nOverlord (1975)\n\nFilmmaker Stuart Cooper’s “Overlord” tells the story of a character named Tom (played by Brian Stirner) from the time he enlists right through D-Day. Tom is a sensitive soldier who is bracing himself for the inevitable. He continually imagines death, specifically how he might die in the war.\n\nThe film’s use of narrative with documentary scenes gives it a unique feel. Tom’s story feels like fate because of it, like something already pre-determined and written. “Overlord” is a blend of historical footage and dream sequences. Although the focus is on Tom’s life, the film honors and grieves the loss of thousands of lives in the war.\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives (1946)\n\n“The Best Years of Our Lives” was pathbreaking for its time in boldly exploring the traumas of war, especially pertinent when you consider its 1946 release date. Three World War II veterans return home to sweet and wholesome mid-west America, only to slowly discover that nothing will ever be the same. Their families have been irreparably changed.\n\nAmong the group of three soldiers, two are now deeply traumatized and disabled. The film chronicles the trauma that an entire generation of men would soon undergo after witnessing the horrors of war – PTSD, insecurity, rage, fear, guilt, rampant alcoholism, and an overwhelming sense of feeling unhinged. Few films back then showed what happens after the war, but only when these stories are told can we ensure history never repeats itself.\n\nThe Train (1964)\n\nInspired by true events, “The Train” has Burt Lancaster as Labiche, a French resistance fighter who finds himself (reluctantly) matching wits with Colonel von Waldheim (Paul Scofield) on a train returning to Germany. Waldheim is an art connoisseur, but a murderous one at that. And the train is full of valuable art.\n\nThe tension in the film is palpable, both from the battle of wits and the larger narrative of how the casualties of war extend far beyond the trenches and battlefields. Labiche, while not an art enthusiast, comes to recognize what it means for a country to have its treasures stolen – an entire identity, culture, and stories gone in a flash. For a country struggling to hold ground in the war, stolen art is a struggle for the country’s soul.\n\nSaving Private Ryan (1998)\n\n“Saving Private Ryan” kicks off with a harrowing portrayal of the Normandy landings during WWII. A squad of soldiers is on a mission — to rescue Private Ryan from enemy territory. Director Steven Spielberg walks a fine line with the narrative, grappling with celebrating the soldiers’ bravery while laying bare the horrors of war, especially in a gut-wrenching opening battle sequence.\n\nThe balance between critiquing the larger machinery of war and recognizing human endeavor is never easy. In doing so, sometimes the film contradicts itself but manages to get the point across. Overall, “Saving Private Ryan” is a visceral war film that stays with you. It's what war movies strive to be — raw, unfiltered, and powerful – and why the film still remains a cherished classic.\n\nWife of a Spy (2020)\n\nKiyoshi Kurosawa’s “Wife of a Spy” is an excellent espionage thriller set against the backdrop of WWII. The film depicts Japan’s entry into the war through the eyes of a Japanese family. Kurosawa might be best known for horror films (the likes of “Cure and Pulse”), but the filmmaker does a fine job building a war film tapestry.\n\n“Wife of a Spy” has an impeccable direction with some of the most masterful performances on the silver screen. The story is an intriguing mystery around an espionage plot that will have catastrophic ramifications. The film is brilliant throughout but the ending defines and makes it the incredible film that it is. For fans who can’t get enough of war flicks, this underrated film is a must-watch.\n\nStalag 17 (1953)\n\n“Stalag 17” opens with an escape attempt that goes wrong. What’s more, tensions run high when a group of U.S. prisoners discover a traitor in their midst. All eyes are on a character named Sefton (William Holden), known for his cynical ways and shady black-market deals. Sefton maintains his innocence.\n\nHe's determined to find the real informer and, in the process, ends up turning the tables on the camp’s commander (Otto Preminger.) Filmmaker Billy Wilder brings much-needed dark comedy to a war film. He’s not one to indulge in sentiment or patriotism for the sake of it but he seemingly obliges and offers both in this funny and tense film – all in his signature style, of course.\n\nThe Ascent (1977)\n\n“The Ascent” doesn’t view war from an epic or global scale. Instead, the film zooms in on personal stories against the backdrop of war which makes it all the more effective. The story centers on two soldiers from the Soviet army during WWII who venture into German-occupied territory to salvage supplies. This one isn’t for those who like their war movies action-packed.\n\nThe pace might be slower but the depiction of events is just as bleak. For viewers who enjoy digging deeper and uncovering the emotions of war, “The Ascent” is a brilliant and woefully underrated film. The film's stark and chilling quality keeps you on the edge even without the usual stunts and effects.\n\nPatton (1970)\n\nWhat makes “Patton” a good watch? George C. Scott as the title character, hands down! Some people consider his performance as one of the most impressive in the 1970s. The film showcases the many campaigns and battles General George S. Patton was involved in during WWII.\n\nWatching it can seem tedious, with much of the screen time dedicated to Scott, but the plot and screenplay are stellar nonetheless. “Patton” is the very definition of a classic war epic – action-packed and compelling. You won’t find anything avant-garde here, just a solid old-fashioned war film that makes an excellent weekend viewing.\n\nRun Silent, Run Deep (1958)\n\n“Run Silent, Run Deep,” is an adaptation of a best-selling novel by Captain Edward L. Beach Jr. and directed by Robert Wise. Clark Gable portrays the impervious and mercurial Commander Richardson. Richardson comes on board a submarine after losing his crew and ships a year ago — in large part due to his recklessness. He now has the chance to settle the score.\n\nBut he can do that only by usurping control from a popular commander, Lieutenant Colonel Bledsoe (Burt Lancaster). Richardson’s personal vendetta becomes evident, dividing the crew. The power struggle here is decidedly different, one where an already dangerous job has become hostile much before any semblance of actual combat. Every decision on board could mean life or death for the crew. Choosing sides in a war takes on a whole new meaning.\n\nDas Boot (1981)\n\n“Das Boot” is a rare war film in that most of it takes place inside a WWII German submarine. You don’t get to see wide open spaces and expansive battlefields. The submarine is underwater most of the time. Every story, character arc, and climactic moment takes place below the surface. As a result, each scene is massively effective.\n\nViewers get peeks into a life of combat inside a submarine, the excitement and all the dangers. The atmosphere is always tense. You never know what can happen. But at the same time, boredom, loneliness, and uncertainty are just as pervasive. What’s heartbreaking is that these are folks just following orders, fighting a war nobody but a nebulous, faceless higher-up wants.\n\nThe Big Red One (1980)\n\nIf you thought “Saving Private Ryan” has the finest depiction of the Normandy landing, you might be inclined to change your mind with this war film. “The Big Red One” is director Samuel Fullers’ finest work and deserves to be better known than it presently is. The idea for the film had been brewing ever since he began his filmmaking career in the 1940s.\n\nLee Marvin plays an unrelenting sergeant leading his men through every significant battle. What we get is an unforgettable war odyssey and a plethora of brilliant cinematic moments. In one such scene, a soldier loses his hand during the landing at Omaha Beach. The hand, wristwatch still intact, sticks out in the mud – a still that Fuller cuts back to at different points in the film to show the passage of time.\n\nThe Bridge at Remagen (1969)\n\n“The Bridge at Remagen” is your classic action-packed, sit-on-the-edge war film. It is based on the true story of how the Allies captured Ludendorff Bridge as WWII began waning. The film sticks to several traditional war film tropes – exciting battle sequences, stunts, and sweeping war scenes.\n\nBut unlike other war movies of the time, it delves sharply into the true costs of war and does a stellar job conveying it. This isn’t another movie glorifying war; the point of view is decidedly cynical. The film is also worth watching for the brilliant performances by the inimitable George Segal and Robert Vaughn.\n\nPlatoon (1986)\n\nCharlie Sheen surprised everyone when he played the protagonist in this brilliant war film. He takes on the role of a young soldier, determined and gung-ho to serve in Vietnam. When his friends and fellow soldiers start dying in combat one by one, he slowly but surely becomes disillusioned by war. “Platoon” doesn’t intend to be subtle.\n\nThe scenes are disturbing and sometimes hard to watch, but they're effective in driving the point home. War is destructive, forever altering the body and mind. And young people can often be the greatest casualties. Directed by Oliver Stone, this hard-hitting film won the Oscar for Best Picture that year and deservedly so!\n\nBooby Traps (1944)\n\nDuring WWII, the U.S. War Department commissioned several animated shorts to generate awareness of critical wartime topics. Think of it as the chaos of Looney Tunes meets practical how-to infomercials. One of these shorts was “Booby Traps.” Created and directed by Bob Clampett, “Booby Traps\" used humor (often racy) and gags to educate people on avoiding booby traps when entering a territory surrendered by the enemy.\n\nThe central character created by Frank Capra was “Snafu” – a clumsy, not very bright soldier who makes every mistake so that others never have to. The shorts offer peeks into everyday life for soldiers during WWII – fraught with danger yet still making space for humor wherever possible. Plus, it makes you think of how life was starkly different for the country’s animators and filmmakers back then.\n\nLebanon (2009)\n\nThe film follows a team of Israeli soldiers that tries to survive behind enemy lines in their lone tank during the 1982 Lebanon conflict. What makes the film unique is how most events take place entirely within the tank. Within this confined space, the horrors of battle take on horrifying extremes. Viewers sense the uncertainty and pressure.\n\nEvery decision or disagreement could be the soldiers’ undoing, threatening to implode everyone. The film’s commitment to realism is commendable — from tank operating protocols to the crushing claustrophobia that soldiers experience when inside. What’s more, the film has some of the most brilliantly written and nuanced characters who come alive on screen.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity (1953)\n\nAuthor James Jones created a stir when his 1951 novel “From Here to Eternity” was published. Readers were equal parts impressed and scandalized by his bold, largely unflattering portrayal of military life. Filmmaker Fred Zinnemann’s adaptation, although much more toned down, received a similar reception. Where other war movies veered towards platitudes for the heroics of the American military, this film addressed the many excesses, abuses, and infidelities rampant before WWII.\n\nMontgomery Clift plays a man who is reluctant to join the camp’s boxing team and suffers the consequences. Burt Lancaster is a jaded desk sergeant who has an affair with his commanding officer’s wife (Deborah Kerr). Other members of the star-studded cast include Ernest Borgnine, Frank Sinatra, and Donna Reed. Despite mixed receptions, the film and cast won a string of Oscars, suggesting that audiences loved seeing soldiers depicted as flawed human beings.\n\nHacksaw Ridge (2016)\n\n“Hacksaw Ridge” is credited with single-handedly addressing the topic of conscientious objection – pathbreaking and bold for a war movie. Based on real events, the film tells the story of Army Medic Desmond T. Doss during WWII. Doss was the first conscientious objector to win a Medal of Honor without firing a weapon – a landmark in U.S. military history.\n\n“Hacksaw Ridge” and its unique perspective bring much-needed nuance to the narrative of war and the landscape of Hollywood war movies. Andrew Garfield shines as Doss, his performance earning him a nomination for Best Actor and several others. The film is perfect for anyone looking to uncover history beyond mainstream accounts.\n\nThe Human Condition (1959)\n\nWhat can one say about “The Human Condition,” only one of the greatest Japanese war films ever made? Directed by the legendary Masaki Kobayashi the film is essentially three movies in one and runs for a whopping 10 hours. And yes, they are best viewed together for maximum effect! “The Human Condition” is a powerful view of war and humanity, with all its strengths and flaws.\n\nIts story is centered largely around a good man named Kaji. Kaji moves to Manchuria with the aim of running a POW camp. He genuinely wants to create better labor conditions for Chinese prisoners but he is soon dragged into enlisting for the Japanese Imperial Army, becoming a POW himself in a Soviet camp. The film is a heartbreaking and solemn meditation on what war does to humanity.\n\nRan (1985)\n\nDespite his failing health and financing troubles, Akira Kurosawa put everything into \"Ran.\" The results? An epic film that became the most compelling and expensive Japanese film made during the time. Kurosawa weaves elements of William Shakespeare’s \"King Lear\" into a story based on Mori Motonari, a feudal lord who lived during the 16th century.\n\nTatsuya Nakadai portrays the role of Ichimonji Hidetora, a legendary but now aging daimyo who wants to split his kingdom among his three sons. His sons have other plans. Bloody conflict ensues, largely as retaliation against Hidetora’s oppressive rule. “Ran” is a tale of regret and introspection – how one man cast humanity and virtue for glory, which ultimately means nothing and literally burns to the ground.\n\nA Bridge Too Far (1977)\n\nFor years after its release, Richard Attenborough's “A Bridge Too Far” courted significant controversy. The film describes in astonishing detail the unfolding of Operation Market Garden — a failed Allied attempt during WWII to take several bridges and break through German lines. What became highly contentious was Sir Dirk Bogarde's portrayal of General Browning.\n\nFriends and family of the late general believed that he was made the fall guy for the failure of Operation Market Garden. In recent years, however, critics and viewers have seen the movie in a new positive light, and with good reason. “A Bridge Too Far” has an enticing script from William Goldman and a meticulously detailed account of the operation that war history enthusiasts love.\n\nThe Great Dictator (1940)\n\n“The Great Dictator” is a significant milestone in Charlie Chaplin’s filmography. To start, it was his first non-silent movie. Chaplin had steered clear from non-silent films thus far. Second, audiences got to see him shine in a darker film, a sharp departure from his otherwise light and comedic repertoire. This isn’t your typical war film in any case.\n\nIt has several funny moments and Chaplin is exceptional as Dictator Adenoid Hynkel. Beyond the humor and satire, let’s not forget that the subject of the film is none other than Adolf Hitler on the rise in Germany. Chaplin uses humor to address Hitler’s sinister rhetoric and desire for power. For audiences viewing the film after WWII, Chaplin’s warnings become a prophecy, given how much Hitler managed to decimate the very fabric of humanity until his defeat in 1945.\n\nThe Siege of Firebase Gloria (1989)\n\nThis Australian war movie takes us to the battlefields of Vietnam. Sergeant Major Hafner (played by R. Lee Ermey) leads his squad on patrol through dangerous enemy territory. The soldiers’ objective is clear — to officially capture and defend Firebase Gloria. The result is an epic battle scene, among the finest cinematic moments on the silver screen.\n\nStudio executives ended up butchering the film, with cuts that destroyed most of its insightful commentary on war. Despite the thoughtless editing, “The Siege of Firebase Gloria” is still an underrated film about the Vietnam War and ideas of reconciliation – one that deserves more attention and recognition.\n\nCross of Iron (1977)\n\n“Cross of Iron” does an impeccable job of setting the mood for a war film. What is striking about the film is the instantaneous sense of pervading gloom and misery – truly one of the best atmospheric films out there. The story follows a German platoon on the Eastern Front of WWII. James Coburn portrays the leader of the platoon – a tough but honorable man who butts heads and ideologies with a new commander.\n\nThis superior cares far more for medals than soldiers’ lives. The film is an unapologetic portrayal of both the horrors of war and the hellish personal agendas within it. The only truth is that human lives are dispensable. “Cross of Iron” is among Sam Peckinpah’s finest works, worthy of more attention and discussion in the war film universe.\n\nThe Deer Hunter (1978)\n\nThe title of the movie wouldn't imply that this is one of the most iconic Vietnam War movies of all time, and yet it is. Telling the tale of working-class Americans before they start their service in the Asian country, things really start to pick up when the action starts in Vietnam. Robert De Niro gives us a classic performance in the main role.\n\nAnother fascinating thing about the movie is that the last hour of it just shows the soldier's lives after the war. Other great performances come from the likes of Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale, among others. Michael Cimino's epic movie ended up winning a whopping five awards at the Oscars, including Best Picture.\n\nBlack Hawk Down (2001)\n\n“Black Hawk Down” is an account of a violent, ill-fated raid on Mogadishu in 1993. The encounter left 19 American soldiers dead. The movie found many takers especially after 9/11, with its politics a matter of contention still. Director Ridley Scott masterfully tells a chaotic story with a cast filled to the brim with every rising male actor during the late ‘90s – from Josh Hartnett and Ewan McGregor to Orlando Bloom.\n\nScott manages to capture the intensity of every scene, even though realism has never been his preferred style for the silver screen. The film received criticism back then for glorifying war. Today the narrative has changed and seems more about the misguided belief that America can or should save another country.\n\nKanal (1957)\n\nDirector Andrzej Wajda poured every bit of his experience as a resistance fighter against the Nazis into three cinematic masterpieces in the 1950s. He made three films during this time: “A Generation” (1955), “Ashes and Diamonds” (1958), and “Kanal” (1957.) Of the three, “Kanal” is widely regarded as the best one with a singular focus on war.\n\n“Kanal” is an account of the Polish resistance to Nazism while also dissecting the qualities of communism, both oppressive and freeing. Viewers follow the mind-boggling efforts of the Warsaw Uprising when freedom fighters undertake efforts to win Poland back from the Nazis. Wajda takes the story literally into the sewers of Poland, creating an unforgettable albeit claustrophobic cinematic gem.\n\nThe Steel Helmet (1951)\n\n“The Steel Helmet” is one of the only war movies set against the backdrop of the Korean War. We have movies galore about WWII and the Vietnam War. By contrast, the Korean War fought during the 1950s finds little mention in Hollywood and has been seemingly relegated to obscure annals of history.\n\n“The Steel Helmet” changed all of that, offering crucial insights into a war few in the world knew about at the time. What made it so radical, apart from the subject matter? The film was made in the middle of the Korean War and makes no bones about its message. It is a harrowing account of a battle fought in a Buddhist temple.\n\nThe Great Escape (1963)\n\nIt’s not an overstatement to call John Sturges’s “The Great Escape” one of the finest works of cinema the world has seen. Other WWII films that came after have all had to live up to the exceptional standards set by the film. The story follows a group of Allied prisoners in a German POW camp determined to break out. The cast featurs the likes of James Garner, Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn and Steve McQueen.\n\nEach one contributes to the cause, with special skills that Sturges goes to great lengths to showcase. For a while it seems like we’re watching an almost comedic heist film until violence ensues, jolting us into remembering where we are – in the thick of bleak, devastating conflict during WWII.\n\nThirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944)\n\n“Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo” is a retelling of the first U.S. air raid on Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The scenes are stoic. Men head for battle without a second thought. Women bravely bid them goodbye, while preparing to do their own bit at home for the greater good. Films released during wartime most often veer into propaganda.\n\nBoosting the country’s morale is the primary objective. But director Mervyn LeRoy went beyond. He focused on the details – preparations for the raid, the aftermath, and moments depicting the crew and what they go through. The result on the screen is chilling. Don’t expect introspection or nuance, however. This war movie is unapologetic, even employing commonly-used racial slurs at the time.\n\nBreaker Morant (1980)\n\n“Breaker Morant” reminds the world of lesser-known, often forgotten chapters in war history. This Australian drama takes place during the Second Boer War in South Africa. Viewers meet a group of three Aussies in the British Army, facing trial and prosecution for heinous war crimes. At the film's heart is a debate about ethical philosophy, which works exceptionally well given its many loopholes in historical inaccuracy, but one can probably forgive that.\n\nThe Bruce Beresford-directed film is more of a courtroom drama. Civility in battle (whatever that might mean) is dead. Just like “The Grand Illusion,” this film centers on “wars of gentlemen” — an idea which in itself is highly problematic and morally ambiguous. For those who like breaking their heads around philosophy and ethics (yes, even in war), \"Breaker Morant\" is a must-watch.\n\nForce 10 From Navarone (1978)\n\nMost people know about the 1961 cult film “The Guns of Navarone,” but only the most ardent war film fans remember that the film has a sequel. It’s a shame since “Force 10 From Navarone” is one of the most brilliant and underrated war films to have come out during the 1970s. Unlike its predecessor, the film’s scale is much smaller.\n\nWhat it seemingly lacks in scope it more than makes up for with impeccable performances and exhilarating battle scenes. The story follows an American special unit during WWII that infiltrates enemy lines in pursuit of an escaped Nazi prisoner. Directed by Guy Hamilton, the action progresses rapidly (much like his James Bond films) and features stellar performances by the likes of Harrison Ford, Robert Shaw, and Barbara Bach.\n\nThe Story of G.I. Joe (1945)\n\n“The Story of G.I. Joe” is a tribute to journalist Ernie Pyle who won a Pulitzer Prize for his groundbreaking reporting of WWII from the eyes of an ordinary soldier. This William Wellman film has Burgess Meredith playing Pyle. War takes on nuanced meaning for Pyle when the journalist joins the army and befriends soldiers fighting on the front line.\n\nInstead of inserting an outside point of view, the film honors the men by giving them the chance to speak in their own voices. Their stories are as real as they get — of war, not from the perspective of analysts and decision makers, but from people on the ground. This no-nonsense and excruciatingly real film was released a few months after Pyle tragically died in the Battle of Okinawa.\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)\n\n“The Bridge on the River Kwai” has long been regarded as one of the greatest war films ever made. Based on true events around the infamous Burma Railway, the movie shines a light on how British prisoners of war endured terrible conditions at the hands of the Japanese. The prisoners are tasked with constructing a bridge. In the process, they develop grudging respect (even friendship) with one another.\n\nWhen intelligence officers destroy the bridge, it renders the Japanese war effort into literal dust. Based on the 1952 novel by Pierre Boulle and directed by David Leab, the film bluntly addresses the futility and trauma of war. The movie addresses lesser-known stories about WWII and although memorable, the true events behind the Burma Railway construction were far more horrific.\n\nThree Kings (1999)\n\n“Three Kings” begins on a light enough note. Three soldiers (George Clooney, Ice Cube, and Mark Wahlberg) try and make the most of their days in the Middle East. The Persian Gulf War has ended and the group attempts to make an easy score. Before you can blink, their story takes a darker turn. They become immersed in the plight of the refugees while trying to avoid the attention and wrath of the infamous Iraqi Republican Guard.\n\nThe victory in the Gulf might have been decisive but it’s clear there’s unfinished business still. All the soldiers want is to not get involved, but they find it impossible (and thoughtless) to just get in and out. What a preview of the years to come, where the disconnect and mistrust between the U.S. and the Middle East would only continue to grow.\n\nWar Horse (2011)\n\n“War Horse” is an adaption of a 1982 novel of the same name by Michael Morpurgo. Steven Spielberg gave it a second life on the silver screen. The story follows Albert, a young soldier, and Joey, his horse, on a journey across Europe during WWI. On their way, the two discover not one shred of glory in war, only horror and cruelty.\n\nBut in the middle of absurdity and bloodshed, Albert finds hope thanks to Joey who miraculously survives a casualty. Spielberg’s adaptation does a remarkable job of capturing moments of human frailty. There's also the extraordinary bond between man and animal, which is magnified a hundred times over in times of crisis.\n\nFull Metal Jacket (1987)\n\nDirector Stanley Kubrick is ubiquitous to the war film genre, and “Full Metal Jacket” is among his best works. The film is a tense and nightmarish exploration of the Vietnam War with the first half showing soldiers in boot camp and the second in Vietnam, facing combat.\n\nIt’s a story of how war dehumanizes and how it doesn’t necessarily begin only after being shipped overseas. Both halves of the film are characterized by trauma, showing how the nightmare can take root at home during training. This is as brutal as war films get, with terrors so gripping and real that “Full Metal Jacket” occasionally feels like a horror movie.\n\nRide With the Devil (1999)\n\nDirected by Ang Lee, “Ride with the Devil” takes us into the mayhem of guerrilla fighting during the Civil War. Two members of the Missouri Bushwhackers (Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich) fight the Jayhawkers miles and worlds away from the official front lines. While hiding out and resisting pro-Union forces, the two men meet a former slave called Holt (Jeffrey Wright), which becomes a turning point in their journey.\n\nThe film is an adaptation of the novel “Woe to Live On” by Daniel Woodrell. Lee doesn’t delve too much into the background of the Civil War which confused some viewers and disappointed critics. What the film lacks in context it makes up for with a clear message: people go to war for several convoluted reasons. Yet, the experience of war drags any conceivable reason through the mud. The only endeavor is to leave war behind.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (1930)\n\nThe impact of “All Quiet on the Western Front” is undeniable. Directed by Edward Berger, the film follows the story of men who enlist in the army during WWI, smitten with ideas of glory and valor only for things to rapidly fall apart. Each day is a waking nightmare. And death? Death is always imminent.\n\nWhat makes the film a classic in the war genre is its extraordinary narrative. Most war films tend to rely on action and effects. “All Quiet on the Western Front” gives you substance, content so compelling it is heart-wrenching and brutal. The film won the Oscar for Best Picture and remains one of the most influential anti-war movies the silver screen has yet seen.\n\nPaths of Glory (1957)\n\nA list of war film greats is incomplete without “Paths of Glory.” The film revolves around the story of three men, unfortunate scapegoats for an entire unit that failed a trench offensive. It opens with a disturbing battle sequence that sets the stage for tragedy on the battlefield and the harsh trial to come.\n\nThe commentary is direct — a sharp condemnation of higher-ranking officials who avoid the trenches themselves but have no qualms about sending young officers to die in battle. “Paths of Glory” is among the best movies on WWI in cinematic history. Its nuanced and confident narrative is remarkable, especially when you consider that director Stanley Kubrick was just 29 when the film was released!\n\nWaltz With Bashir (2008)\n\nAri Folman's “Waltz with Bashir” uses animation, poetry, interviews, and brutal documentary images to tell the story of the 1982 Lebanon War. This aesthetically brilliant war movie is partly autobiographical, in that the protagonist is Folman himself. He attempts to reconstruct his own suppressed memories about the Lebanon War and the Sabra and Shatila massacre.\n\nAnd since he can’t remember, Folman begins to collect stories from other characters in the film. “Waltz with Bashir” is a haunting psychological journey as much as it is a political one. The movie doesn't seek to answer the many lingering questions about war. Its focus is on Israeli veterans – their actions and how they grappled with tenuous memory. The final scenes in the film are some of the most hard-hitting in movie history.\n\nDunkirk (2017)\n\n“Dunkirk” marked a change of pace for director Christopher Nolan, otherwise famous for trailblazing action films. And of course, everyone knows him for the Dark Knight trilogy. “Dunkirk” is at once a war movie while feeling like an excellent Nolan thriller. The movie tells the story of the evacuation of allied forces from Dunkirk during WWII.\n\nViewers get multiple perspectives on the event and the days leading up to it – different views that convey the magnitude of the operation. What’s more, Nolan takes a war movie and flips it on its head by traveling back and forth between different time periods at different speeds. It won’t come as a surprise to fans who love the signature mind-bending, time-defying elements in Nolan’s work.\n\nPearl Harbor\n\nGenerally, epic war movies are treated with some regard that puts them safely out of the hands of Golden Raspberry nominations. Not when they are directed by Michael Bay. The LA director may strike gold at the box office, but he is a familiar contender for Golden Raspberries.\n\nThe only thing that saved “Pearl Harbor” from scooping in a handful of awards for the war epic was that there were seriously terrible movies that year including Tom Green’s “Freddy Got Fingered” and Mariah Carey’s one serious attempt at acting in “Glitter.” “Pearl Harbor” was still nominated for six Golden Razzies.\n\nThe Thin Red Line (1998)\n\nOther war films might have heavy artillery and guns blazing in the foreground. Indeed, that seems to be the focus of most films in the genre. “The Thin Red Line” takes a radically different approach to war – deeply philosophical and cerebral. It urges introspection. The story follows a group of U.S. soldiers fighting at the Battle of Guadalcanal.\n\nBy the end of the movie, most of the characters die in combat. What’s most striking about the film is its duality. Blood is shed in the most picturesque natural locations. There’s beauty and bestiality in equal measure, forced to co-exist or fight it out. Filmmaker Terrence Malik made a highly-anticipated comeback with “The Thin Red Line.” It might not be the most well-known war movie but is among the best of the time.\n\nWings (1927)\n\nNow, we travel all the way back to the 1920s with “Wings” – a movie about two pilots during WWI (they called it The Great War then.) Both men are in love with the same woman. “Wings” is a classic war film that combines impressive action scenes and a lot of romance veering on melodrama. The film doesn’t seem dated even when you view it today.\n\nThe film made history. It was the first to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards which had its first awards presentation in 1929. When the Academy first started off, it awarded two trophies that would today equal the Best Picture category. “Wings” was one of the winners. The other was “Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans.”\n\nOperation Finale (2018)\n\n“Operation Finale” is more a cerebral, intelligent film. Viewers looking for exhilarating battle scenes, this one will disappoint. It doesn’t rely on declarations of all-out war. Instead, it uses strategy and elements of espionage to drive the narrative.\n\nSet in a post-war landscape, director Chris Weitz depicts the story of Israeli military operatives on a mission to trace and capture Adolf Eichmann (Ben Kingsley) – a once high-ranking Nazi officer. Eichmann was the architect of the “Final Solution” and among Adolf Hitler’s closest confidantes. The final scenes in the film feature footage from Eichmann’s real-life trial, effectively conveying that justice has been served.\n\nInglourious Basterds (2009)\n\nWhen Quentin Tarantino makes a war film, you best pay attention! As one might expect from the director, the results were unpredictable, bold, and of course, gory beyond belief. “Inglourious Basterds” in 2009 was Tarantino’s answer to what pushing boundaries in film should look like. The mind-bending film follows various characters in Nazi-occupied France – each one quirky, dangerous, and blessed with unique skills to further resistance to the German Army.\n\nThe film doesn’t take historical accuracy too seriously. It veers off gleefully on an ingenious path of its own making — funny, dark, and intensely violent. By suspending the need for historical timelines as they happened, this war movie boldly established alternative realities. Perhaps it might help spur the world into positive action should evil rear its head again.\n\n13 Hours: The Secret of Benghazi (2016)\n\n“13 Hours: The Secret of Benghazi” took Hollywood by storm in 2016. The film follows the real story of the Annex Security Team whose mission was to secure an American diplomatic base during a wave of terrorist attacks in 2012. This low-budget yet impactful film initially shocked the world and with good reason.\n\nWas this really a Michael Bay film? Subtle, minimal, and trimmed down to bare-bones essentials? Fans and critics were impressed by the filmmaker’s use of substance over spectacle. The action sequences deserve a special mention for their essentialism, as is Jon Krasinski’s incredible versatility as an actor.\n\nGlory (1989)\n\nOf all the films about the American Civil War (and there have been many), “Glory” is among the most famous. We’ll go out on a limb and say it might be one of the best in existence. The plot revolves around an all-Black company made up of volunteers who fight for the North. What the film gets right is placing slavery at the center of the narrative.\n\nIt depicts the struggle of Black people and how they were instrumental in shaping the war and its outcomes. The film has however been rightfully criticized for having a white character driving the narrative. Even so, “Glory” compels viewers to be invested in the story. One of the other highlights was the inimitable Denzel Washington who won his first Oscar for his performance in the film.\n\nChe (2008)\n\nPart war movie and part biopic, Steven Soderbergh’s “Che” is a riveting story of Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. The two-part movie details his role in a successful revolution in Cuba as also a failed revolution attempt in Bolivia. What viewers get is a thrilling portrayal of guerrilla warfare, every resounding success and devastating failure.\n\nSoderbergh’s filmmaking enables the rush and tension with scenes of combat in cities. The fight goes literally door to door. The revolutionaries are massively successful in the first half of the film but everything unravels in the second half. Success and failure are both transient. Benicio del Toro as Che Guevara is undeniable. He paints a portrait of a complex man — one who we cannot reduce to T-shirt designs and the purview of armchair revolutionaries.\n\nMerry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983)\n\nFilmmaker Nagisa Oshima has never shied away from controversy, and that’s evident in “Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence.” The film is an unapologetic exploration of homoerotic tension coursing through a Japanese-run prisoner-of-war camp in Indonesia. Viewers meet Lieutenant Colonel John Lawrence (Tom Conti), Sergeant Hara (Takeshi Kitano), and unflappable Major Jack Celliers (David Bowie.)\n\nBefore long, viewers can cut the tension with a knife. The film explores forbidden desires and brutal excesses, daring to address underlying themes left to wither in every other war movie. It also provides commentary on how different cultures express or repress these feelings – usually through denial or violence.\n\nArmy of Shadows (1969)\n\nAs far as French Resistance films go, “Army of Shadows” is the pinnacle of fine cinema. The film had never been distributed in America until 2006, and then topped pretty much every critics’ list on this side of the ocean. All this, over three decades after the film was first released.\n\nDirected by Jean-Pierre Melville, “Army of Shadows” is about the efforts of French Resistance fighters attempting to hide from the Vichy administration while also trying to survive the Nazi occupation of France. The group also discovers that there is a traitor in their midst. Known widely for his thrilling crime films, Melville brings similar intensity and tension while depicting the spirit of the resistance movement.\n\nThe Imitation Game (2014)\n\n“The Imitation Game” is based on the fascinating life of British mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch.) Turing was instrumental in deciphering the puzzle that was the German enigma code – a breakthrough that gave Britain a massive upper hand during the war. But the mathematician’s story takes a tragic and heartbreaking turn.\n\nThe British government negated his accomplishments, choosing instead to focus on his homosexuality. Turing faced unfair prosecution and ultimately, chemical castration as an alternative to prison. Turing died when he was 42. An inquiry deemed that he had taken his own life. Unlike other war films, “The Imitation Game” boldly explores latent homosexuality and not only within the purview of war.\n\nNapoleon (1927)\n\nAlthough the world has plenty of Napoleon Bonaparte films to choose from, none compare to the 1927 film directed by Abel Gance. Gance had grand plans when he set out to make a film on the French commander. The idea was to make a staggering six films covering various parts of Napoleon’s life.\n\nWhile this dream project didn’t see the light of day, just the one film was quite epic in itself. “Napoleon” is a whopping five and a half hours long, and still doesn’t cover many parts of the leader’s eventful life. Gance’s work is widely regarded as the ultimate benchmark — if you’re making a Napoleon Bonaparte film, it’s got to be better or equally as good!\n\nPork Chop Hill (1959)\n\n“Pork Chop Hill” is a cinematic gem based on the true story of an American assault during the Korean War. The mission was to take Pork Chop Hill where a big group of Chinese soldiers had deeply dug in and taken refuge. Director Lewis Milestone infuses the narrative with haunting anti-war themes similar to the ones present in his 1930 adaptation of “All Quiet on the Western Front.”\n\nThis time, however, the focus is on the blasé nature of the leaders and higher-ups in war – hopeless, impotent, and feeble men at the helm of global conflicts. With memorable performances by the one and only Gregory Peck, the film is a powerful indictment of war and the men who seemingly lead it.\n\nDa 5 Bloods (2020)\n\nSpike Lee’s “Da 5 Bloods” is an adventure film that follows a group of veterans as they go back to Vietnam. Their mission, even after having retired from active duty? Find treasure they had been forced to abandon during wartime. The film flashes back to scenes of battle, compelling each one to confront past burdens and where life has led them over the years.\n\nLee’s excellent creative vision blurs the line between Vietnam’s past and the present. Above all, the film is a scathing criticism of America’s rampant cultural imperialism. And unlike many war films, this one delves deep into the lesser-known experiences of Black soldiers during the Vietnam War. Clarke Peters, Delroy Lindo, Norm Lewis, and Isiah Whitlock Jr. give some awesome performances along the way.\n\nTora! Tora! Tora! (1970)\n\nFew films have been as iconic as “Tora! Tora! Tora!” which sparked curiosity and attention for its joint production. The Americans and the Japanese collaborating on a war film was unheard of. Art had truly transcended borders and historical enemy lines! The story follows events leading up to Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n\nWith Pearl Harbor, the United States had no choice but to get involved in WWII. The story unfolds from two opposing viewpoints with glimpses of the lives, motivations, fears, and convictions on each side. Featuring no A-list celebrities (a conscious filmmaking choice) the real star of the film is its narrative.\n\nThe Chimes at Midnight (1965)\n\n“The Chimes at Midnight” is Orson Welles’s adaptation of Shakespearean plays transformed into a brilliant war movie. Welles was constrained by a limited budget but still manages to create sweeping scenes of medieval battles. Most importantly, the movie is about how dated ideas of honor and duty can slowly chip away at the joyful parts of human nature.\n\nWelles plays the impervious John Falstaff. Falstaff is unrepentant but at the same time, a good man as any in every way that matters. At the heart of the story is his strained relationship with Prince Hal (Keith Baxter), the man who would become Henry V. Hal goes on to epitomize a king who inspires loyalty among friends and terror in those who dare to cross him.\n\nThey Were Expendable (1945)\n\n“They Were Expendable” is a grim account of how a pair of Navy men during WWII (John Wayne and Robert Montgomery) attempt to convince superiors that small PT boats must have a place during battles, and not just larger vessels. To understand why the men arrived at this conclusion, some context is in order. The film takes place during America’s early involvement in the war.\n\nEven as the Allies rejoiced, they were suffering one setback after another. Many of the people involved in making the film had also experienced the war, either firsthand or in some other form – which explains the intensity in every scene. The “expendable” in the title is all-encompassing – boats, ships, and human lives. Service meant acknowledging and living with this truth every waking moment.\n\nCasualties of War (1989)\n\nEven decades later, Brian De Palma’s “Casualties of War” is still tough to watch, which is reason enough to go ahead and do it! Back then, De Palma never found takers for his factual and graphic film about the abuse of a Vietnamese woman.\n\nThe story follows a group of American soldiers who engage in barbaric acts sanctioned by a violent yet enigmatic superior (Sean Penn). Michael J. Fox plays the moral center and expectedly pays the price for his honesty. Nobody was ready for the unbearable sadness depicted in the film. Such was its reception that “Casualties of War” reportedly stopped the endless cycle of Vietnam War films in the ’80s.\n\nGrand Illusion (1937)\n\nJean Renoir crafted a masterpiece with “Grand Illusion.” The film follows the story of French prisoners of war and their captors. The film hit a nerve where it mattered the most. The infamous Joseph Goebbels loathed the movie and its critique of the war. Of course, his No. 1 gripe was how the film made Germany look bad. But it wasn’t just Germany that took offense.\n\nWhen the film was re-released in 1946, the French took issue with its dated, “pacifist” message — especially in how the film depicted connections between German and French officers. By then, both countries were in the thick of WWII and its unimaginable atrocities. Still, Renoir’s film offers slivers of hope, suggesting that a shared sense of humanity can trump nationalistic agendas. But without concerted effort, this kind of connection might be lost forever.\n\nThe Odd Angry Shot (1979)\n\nAs the title suggests, “The Odd Angry Shot” is well, a slightly odd war film. And that’s not a bad thing as viewers soon discover. Most war films feature bleak, apocalyptic war scenes, usually culminating in one epic climactic moment in battle. “The Odd Angry Shot” takes a different yet equally relevant view, if not more so.\n\nThe film is set during the Vietnam War and follows a regular day in the life of an Australian platoon. Scenes of lighthearted downtime and beer-swilling co-exist against the backdrop of war and death. The film’s tone is almost aloof, preferring quiet observation to direct commentary. Yet, its objectivity and humor convey everything, even without outright statements about war. The film’s alternative, reflective view of war provokes more thought than most others in the genre.\n\nLetters From Iwo Jima (2006)\n\n“Letters From Iwo Jima” is actually part two of a duology (two movies) made by Clint Eastwood. His ambitious idea was to showcase the Battle of Iwo Jima from different perspectives. The first part was “Flags of Our Fathers,” which represented the American point of view during and after the battle. “Letters from Iwo Jima” tells the story of the Japanese Army.\n\nThe general consensus is that “Letters From Iwo Jima” is the better film out of the two – from the gripping screenplay to the humanized and empathetic depiction of the Japanese forces. You’d be hard-pressed to find that in true-blue American war films any other day. The story is harrowing and intense. Yet, the beautiful way in which events unfold, showing an army coming to terms with imminent defeat, is unmatched.\n\nThe Burmese Harp (1956)\n\nKon Ishikawa’s “The Burmese Harp” is about Japanese soldiers facing reckoning towards the end of WWII. To better understand the film, it is best to first watch “Fires on the Plain” (also by Ishikawa.) The double feature offers a broader context on meaning and certain recurring themes. “Fires on the Plain” has Eiji Funakoshi playing Tamura, a soldier stricken with tuberculosis. He is refused admission into a hospital and resorts to wandering among the dead, starving, and on the brink of death.\n\nDeath seems better than survival. “The Burmese Harp” takes place in a similar hellish landscape but tinged with hope. A Japanese private (Shoji Yasu) disguises himself as a monk – partly to survive and because he feels called to a higher duty. War is still grim but there are glimmers of possibility, of hard-won spiritual redemption and tenuous common ground between wartime enemies.\n\nM*A*S*H (1970)\n\nMost people remember the television series when they hear “M*A*S*H” but very few know that an incredible film preceded the small screen! Directed by Robert Altman, “M*A*S*H” the film follows the story of medical officers stationed in Korea for whom humor isn’t just a coping mechanism, it’s a way of life. American audiences loved the film.\n\nThe war in Vietnam was raging on and the atmosphere was filled with cynicism and anti-war sentiments. “M*A*S*H” and its dark comedy was a breath of fresh air. While we’re big fans of the series and its cast, the film might be even better with masterful performances by Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall, and Sally Kellerman.\n\nCourage Under Fire (1996)\n\n“Courage Under Fire” directed by Edward Zwick was the first Hollywood film about the Gulf War. What’s more, it also pushed buttons by addressing another contentious issue at the time – women in combat. But the essence of the plot is about honor under excruciatingly difficult circumstances, and how tough it can be to stay the course.\n\nAt the center of the story is Denzel Washington (who portrays Lieutenant Colonel Sterling). Sterling must uncover the truth about an incident in the past, one that might lead to deceased Captain Karen Walden (played by Meg Ryan in flashbacks) becoming the first woman to receive a Medal of Honor. As he digs deeper, the case becomes more complex – even as he struggles with a past burden of his own.\n\nHamburger Hill (1987)\n\n“Hamburger Hill” is one of the best movies about the Vietnam War. It’s high time the film got the love it deserves after having flown under the radar for too long. The story follows a small US squadron and their desperate attempts to capture Hamburger Hill. But this isn’t another war film depicting special missions during battle.\n\nIt delves deeper into addressing compelling issues such as racism on the front lines and the sweeping anti-war movement back in America. Featuring an incredible cast and performances from Don Cheadle, Dylan McDermott, and Don James, “Hamburger Hill” is a hard-hitting portrayal of war.\n\nApocalypse Now (1979)\n\nDirected by Francis Ford Coppola, “Apocalypse Now” takes a radically distinct view of the Vietnam War. Instead of relying on familiar war film tropes, the film views war as a surreal and haunting dreamscape. Much like “The Deer Hunter” released just before it, the film’s anti-war statement is clear. It follows an officer tasked with assassinating a renegade officer hiding out in unforgiving jungles.\n\nThis was a real hole-in-one for screenwriter John Milius. Heavily inspired by Joseph Conrad's novel \"Heart of Darkness,\" he took the basic premise while moving the setting from Africa to Vietnam. And it seemed like everything that came after, from the chilling score and the performances to the gritty cinematography, captured the real horrors of war at the time. \"Apocalypse Now\" truly did something new for the war movie genre.\n\nPaisan (1946)\n\nRoberto Rossellini released several movies between 1945 and 1946 portraying different phases of WWII. “Paisan” contains six episodic stories that center on the Italian campaign as it progresses upwards through the Italian peninsula. The film was shot soon after real-life events in the frontlines. Known for his exceptional neo-realism, Rossellini harnesses the power of filming on location. The sheer ugliness of war stares viewers in the face, partly because the devastation on Italy was plain as day.\n\nHe could’ve picked up a camera and began filming without ceremony and the picture would’ve been clear. The film was even more impactful since Rossellini employed both professional actors and ordinary folk to star in the film. A blend of script, narrative, and on-the-spot improvisation gives the film authenticity through lived experience. “Paisan” is a crushing depiction of the perils of war, for both soldiers and everyday people already struggling to get by.\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans (1992)\n\n“The Last of the Mohicans” is Michael Mann’s film adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper’s novel of the same name. The Mohicans have co-existed peacefully alongside the British so far. But when a rogue scout kidnaps the daughters of a British colonel, the last members of this tribe are compelled to a rescue mission.\n\nThe mission lands them in the crossfires of a battle they want nothing to do with – the gruesome French and Indian War. What distinguishes this film from others Mann has directed is the unabashed display of emotion, which is rare for his films. His filmmaking also seems more epic and sweeping in scope.\n\nSchindler's List (1993)\n\nSteven Spielberg has a knack for creating emotionally resonant films; his exceptional filmography over the years is evidence enough. But with \"Schindler's List\" he took it up several notches. \"Schindler's List\" is a cinematic masterpiece set against the backdrop of WWII. The film depicts true historical events with the enigma that is Oskar Schindler at its heart.\n\nSchindler is a wealthy businessman who goes from perpetuating the evil machinery of Nazism to becoming deeply haunted by the Third Reich’s Final Solution. He ends up dedicating his resources to rescuing over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. What war makes people do is never easy to describe. Schindler’s character arc is remarkable and it has rightfully earned this movie a place as one of the greatest war movies of all time."
