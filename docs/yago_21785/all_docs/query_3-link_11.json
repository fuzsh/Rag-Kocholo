        "text": "Marie-Thérèse of Austria (born September 10, 1638, El Escorial, Spain—died July 30, 1683, Versailles, France) was the queen consort of King Louis XIV of France (reigned 1643–1715).\n\nAs the daughter of King Philip IV of Spain and Elizabeth of France, Marie-Thérèse was betrothed to Louis by the Peace of the Pyrenees (1659), which ended a 24-year war between France and Spain. Under the terms of the pact, she agreed to renounce her claim to succession to the Spanish throne in return for a large dowry. The couple was married in June 1660. On the death of Philip IV and the accession of young Charles II to the Spanish throne in 1665, Louis XIV claimed that since Marie-Thérèse’s dowry had never been paid, her renunciation was void. Accordingly, he conquered part of the Spanish Netherlands in his wife’s name (War of Devolution, 1667–68). Meanwhile, Marie-Thérèse had proved unable to hold Louis’s affection. A year after their marriage he took the first of a succession of royal mistresses. The queen suffered his infidelities in silence, and on her death Louis is reported to have said, “This is the only trouble she has ever caused me.” Of Marie-Thérèse’s five children, only one, the dauphin Louis (died 1711), lived to maturity."
