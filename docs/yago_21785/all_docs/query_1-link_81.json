        "text": "King Philip II of France (1165-1223)\n\nKing Philip II of France, also known as Philip Augustus is the most famous and successful king of the Capetian dynasty. He was born at Gonesse, Val-d’Oise, in France on August 21, 1165. He was the son of the previous king, King Louis VII and his third wife. He was crowned king 1179, by his sickening father. They co-ruled France until his Father passed away at September 18, 1180. On April 28, 1180 he was married to Isabelle of Hainaut.\n\nIn the year 1189, King Philip II went on the Third Crusade with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, and King Richard the Lionhearted, of England. At Lyons, King Philip’s army and King Richard’s army split off. The French army traveled by sea, and the English army traveled by land. The two armies met up and spent the winter together in Messina. Then King Philip returned to France, he used King Richard’s absence to take back some of the French land which was under English rule. When King Richard returned to England in 1194, he regained most of the land King Philip had taken. King Richard the Lionhearted died in battle in the year 1199, and was succeeded by his half brother, King John.\n\nKing Philip decided to remarry, so on August 15, 1193, he married Ingeborg of Denmark, who was renamed Isambour. Philip refused to have her crowned queen for an unknown reason, and he put her into a convent. He then asked the pope for an annulment, but Ingeborg insisted that she was the rightful queen of France. Meanwhile, King Philip married again, this time to Princess Agnès of Méranie on May 7, 1196. The Pope, Pope Innocent III, declared this marriage invalid, because Philip II was still married to Isambour and in 1199, placed France under an interdict until September 7, 1200. King Philip finally took Isambour back as his wife in 1213.\n\nIn the year 1202, King John of England declared war on France. Philip used this as an excuse to capture most of the English holdings in France;p uaine, Touraine, Anjou, Brittany, and all of Normandy. King Philip wonp uhe battle of Bouvines, in 1214, against England and their German alli, which established his hold on many of the conquered regions, making him the most powerful monarch in Europe.\n\nKing Philip made a series of government reforms while he was king, which helped to strengthen his authority, and laid the basis for later rule of French monarchs. Philip turned the capitol of France, Paris, into a virtual city of teachers. He accomplished this by paving the main roads and building a central market. He continued to build the Gothic Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, which started construction in 1163, and in 1200, gave the University of Paris a charter. King Philip died at Mantes on July 14, 1223, and was succeeded by his son, Louis VIII.\n\nWritten by MNICY."
