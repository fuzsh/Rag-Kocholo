        "meta_description": "Thelma Faye Holland 1928 - 2022  Thelma Holland left this earthly world on January 4, 2022, to begin celebrating her eternal life with God, her loving husband of 54 years Quintin, as well as her family and friends waiting on her in heaven. Thelma was born in Pocasset, Oklahoma as the youngest of seven children born to Lee and Maud Nigh. She is preceded in death by her parents and her brothers, Benny, James, John, and Robert, as well as her sisters, Bertha Watson and Lorene Hill. She always said growing up with four brothers made her tough. Survived by her daughter Janet Grimes and her husband Richard, her son Mark Holland, and his wife Dana; four grandchildren whom she absolutely adored, Stephen, Patrick and wife, Whitney, Brooke, and Adam and one very special great-grandson Alekzander; as well as many dear friends and neighbors who were very important to her. As the Matriarch of our family, she was as a great example of how to be kind, loving and generous with others. We hope to be more like her every day. Full of energy and optimism, she always looks for the good in any situation and always believed she could accomplish anything she set her mind to. Thelma enjoyed working. Her career spanned 76 years, her time spent helping others through her service as an insurance agent and Real Estate Broker. Successfully running her own company for 46 years, she worked to serve others and always took great pride in helping anyone achieve first time homeownership. Thelma will be greatly missed by her family and friends. She will live in our hearts and memories for all the days to come. In lieu of flowers we asked that you consider a donation on Thelmaâs behalf to either Wings Special Needs Community 13700 Eastern Ave., Oklahoma City, OK 73013 (www.wingsok.org) or Pivot a Turning Point for Youth 201 N.E. 50th St., Oklahoma City, OK 73105 (pivotok.org).
