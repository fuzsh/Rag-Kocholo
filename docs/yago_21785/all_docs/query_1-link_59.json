        "text": "The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are celebrating their platinum wedding anniversary—that's a jaw-dropping 70 years of marriage.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth married naval officer Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten at Westminster Abbey on November 20, 1947, in front of 2,000 guests. The ceremony was broadcast to approximately 200 million radio listeners around the world and despite being the King's daughter, the princess had to use ration coupons to obtain the material needed to make her Norman Hartnell wedding dress.\n\nIn order to mark their anniversary—and in anticipation of the second series of The Crown, which will delve further into their relationship—look back at the key moments of Elizabeth and Philip's many years together.\n\nJuly, 1939\n\nElizabeth's first encounter with the 18-year-old Greek prince came during a trip on the Royal Yacht, Victoria and Albert, which was sailing across the Devon coast off southern England. The young princess, then 13, joined her family on an informal visit to the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, where Philip was a cadet. The couple then started to write to each other.\n\nDecember, 1943\n\nPrince Philip joined the royal family at their Christmas party in Windsor. His visit sparked rumors in the newspaper of a possible romance between him and the Princess, according to\n\n1946\n\nAfter a few years of exchanging letters while Philip was in the navy during World War Two, he regularly visited Buckingham Palace where would \"dine informally\" with Elizabeth and her sister Margaret, according to Bullen.\n\nIn the summer, he stayed at Balmoral for three weeks, it is thought that this is where he proposed to the princess. It's widely believed that King George VI agreed to the marriage but asked them to wait a year for his daughter's 21st birthday before announcing the decision.\n\nJuly, 1947\n\nPrince Philip became a British citizen and renounced his royal title, becoming Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten R.N.\n\nTheir engagement was announced on July 9, by the King and Queen Elizabeth, via the court circular.\n\n\"It is with the greatest of pleasure that the King and Queen announce the betrothal of their dearly beloved daughter, the Princess Elizabeth, to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten. RN, son of the late Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Andrew (Princess Alice of Battenberg) to which union the King has gladly given his consent,\" the statement said.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten at Buckingham Palace on July 10, 1947\n\nThe couple later posed for official engagement photographs outside Buckingham Palace and four months later they were married.\n\nNovember, 1947\n\nThe wedding was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury in front of 2,000 invited guests. The wedding was not particularly ostentatious given the poor economical state of post war-Britain. However, the couple received more than 2,500 gifts from around the world and 10,000 telegrams, according to the BBC.\n\nThe wedding cake was an impressive four tiers and nine feet high, with ingredients donated by the Australian girl guides—as the UK was in the grip of a sugar-rationing program—according to Bullen.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on their wedding day in 1947\n\nThe couple honeymooned on the Balmoral estate in Scotland.\n\nMay, 1948\n\nThe newlyweds undertook their first public visit overseas to Paris, France. According to Bullen, the French people \"fell in love with the charming English royals,\" overnight.\n\nNovember, 1948\n\nTheir first child, Charles Philip Arthur George, was born on November 14 at Buckingham Palace, less than a week before the couple's first wedding anniversary.\n\nJuly, 1949\n\nA few months later, Philip returned to active service with the navy and flew out to Malta. His wife joined him in November to celebrate their second wedding anniversary.\n\nAugust, 1950\n\nThe couple's second child, Princess Anne, was born.\n\nFebruary, 1952\n\nThe couple embarked on an official tour of Australia, New Zealand and Africa at the King's request. While the couple were staying at a royal hunting lodge in Kenya, news broke at home that on February 6, King George VI had died peacefully in his sleep, aged 56.\n\nIt was Prince Philip who reportedly broke the news to the heir of the throne. The Queen returned to London on February 8 and was formally proclaimed Queen and Head of the Commonwealth and Defender of the Faith. The couple soon moved from Clarence House into the royal home of the monarch, Buckingham Palace.\n\nJune, 1953\n\nThe coronation of the new Queen took place in front of more than 8,000 guests at Westminster Abbey in a ceremony watched by around 20 million people across the world.\n\nAccording to Bullen, the Queen and the prince had practiced the coronation, with Philip tying together bed sheets to replicate her train.\n\nThe Queen and Duke of Edinburgh waving at crowds on the day of the Queen’s coronation on June 2nd, 1953\n\nDuring the ceremony, Prince Philip proclaimed, in front of the world, while he knelt: \"I, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, do become your liege man of life and limb and of earthly worship.\"\n\nHe then rose to his feet and kissed her on the cheek.\n\nDecember 1953 - May 1954\n\nThe Queen and Duke left London for a lengthy six-month tour of the Commonwealth including Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Caribbean Islands, various African nations and Malta and Gibraltar in Europe.\n\nNovember, 1956\n\nThe Duke embarked on a solo tour for four months which included a visit to Melbourne, Australia, to open the Olympic Games.\n\nThis was the year he also set up his flagship Duke of Edinburgh award scheme—which still runs in schools throughout the UK today.\n\nFebruary, 1960\n\nThe royal family's name had been confirmed by the Queen in her accession to the throne to be Windsor. However, on February 8, the Queen and Duke decided that they would like their own direct descendants to be distinguished from the rest of the Royal Family—as Windsor was used by all descendants of George V.\n\nIn a declaration, the Queen said to the Privy Council that the Queen's descendants would carry the name of Mountbatten-Windsor, a fusion of both hers and the Duke's name.\n\nThe Queen's children often do not need a surname as they are referred to as their Royal Highness, or Prince or Princess, but in the occasion they would, they would be known as Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nThe couple's third child, Prince Andrew, was born on February 19.\n\nJune, 1961\n\nThe Duke and Queen entertained the couple of the moment, President John Kennedy and First Lady Jackie, at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe Queen and Duke welcoming President John F Kennedy and First Lady Jackie Kennedy to Buckingham Palace on June 15, 1961\n\nMarch, 1964\n\nThe couple's fourth and final child, Prince Edward, was born on March 10 at Buckingham Palace.\n\nNovember, 1972\n\nThe royal couple celebrated 25 years of marriage where they received around 15,000 congratulatory letters and 2,500 telegrams from around the world.\n\nPhotos of the entire family celebrating the occasion at Buckingham Palace were made public and a Thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey was also held.\n\nThe Royal Family celebrating the silver wedding anniversary at Buckingham Palace on November 20, 1972\n\nNovember, 1973\n\nPrincess Anne becomes the first of the couple's children to be married. She married army lieutenant Mark Phillips in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey on a national holiday in front of an estimated 500 million viewers, according to the BBC.\n\nNovember, 1977\n\nThe Queen and Duke's first grandchild, Peter Mark Andrew Phillips, was born to Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips on November 15 at St. Mary's Hospital in London.\n\nThe baby was the first royal baby to be born a commoner, and with no royal title, for more than 500 years as Princess Anne is said to have rejected the Queen's offer to give her children royal titles.\n\nOctober, 1980\n\nThe Queen made history by becoming the first British monarch to make a state visit to the Vatican to meet Pope John Paul II.\n\nThe Duke, Queen and Pope John Paul II at the Vatican\n\nThe Duke accompanied his wife and the visit was seen as a big step in improving relations between the Roman Catholic church and Church of England, reports the BBC.\n\nSeptember, 1981\n\nThe Queen and Duke's eldest child, and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, married Lady Diana Spencer at St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nJuly, 1986\n\nPrince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson at Westminster Abbey, the Queen conferred the title Duke of York—traditionally held by the sovereign's second son, as was the case with her father prior to his coronation—to her third eldest child just 90 minutes before the ceremony, reports the BBC.\n\nNovember, 1992\n\nThe Queen and Duke helped rescue huge numbers of priceless work from Windsor Castle after it caught fire.\n\nPrince Andrew told the BBC his mother was \"devastated\" by the damage to the property which took 250 firefighters 15 hours to hose down.
