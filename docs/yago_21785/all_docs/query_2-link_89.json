She was the oldest of three children born to Willem and Pietronella Dam.\n\nShe came to Canada in 1958, where she soon met the love of her life, Adrian De Vries and they were married on February 5, 1959. They settled in Lethbridge where she resided until her passing.\n\nBertha was a school teacher in The Netherlands for ten years. She continued her career at Gilbert Paterson School, Westminster School and finally, at Immanuel Christian School, where she taught for many years.\n\nBertha loved the Lord. She loved people; family and friends were very important. Their home was always open for a visit or a meal. Through their many travels, they met and kept contact with people from all over the world.\n\nHer passion was teaching. In retirement, she spent a lot of time volunteering at the Mission Thrift Store. She began making cards and sending them to everyone. She loved researching family history and enjoyed learning about her and Adrian’s family.\n\nBesides her loving husband Adrian, Bertha was predeceased by her parents Willem and Pietronella Dam, sister Tini and brother Pieter.\n\nShe is survived by her nephew Wim Dam and other nieces and nephews. Also left to mourn are his special friends, whom she called her family: Lemien Deemter and family, Bill and Laura Hofsink and family, Henk and Rita Vischer as well as Adrian and Bertha’s “adopted” grandchildren: Greta (Adrian) Pau, Alma (Alexander) Grootelaar, Suzanna Visscher and Janice (Lucas) Ninaco and family.\n\nA very special thank you to the staff at Legacy Lodge for their care and friendship to Bertha.\n\nA Funeral Service will be held at WESTMINSTER CHAPEL, 329 – 19 Street North, Lethbridge, AB, on Tuesday, August 9, 2022 at 11:00 A.M. with Pastor Rowan Crown officiating. The Service will be livestreamed and available via Bertha’s obituary on the Cornerstone website.\n\nTo send a condolence, please visit www.cornerstonefuneralhome.com"
