        "text": "In The Crown season five, Prince Philip’s relationship with not one but two women acts as a focal point. The first: Imelda Staunton’s Queen Elizabeth II, his wife—and leader—of almost four decades. The second? Penny Knatchbull, a woman nearly 30 years his junior. (A note to the reader: spoilers to follow.)\n\nPenny (also known as Countess Mountbatten of Burma) is technically Prince Philip’s relative by marriage: In 1979, she wed Norton Knatchbull, grandson of Louis Mountbatten, Philip’s favorite uncle. She and her husband live at Broadlands—the very same 86-acre estate where Philip and Queen Elizabeth spent their honeymoon in 1947.\n\nIn the early 1990s, a friendship blossomed between the prince and Penny. The catalyst was a tragic one: Penny’s five-year-old daughter, Leonora, died of liver cancer. Philip offered solace to the grieving mother and also helped her develop a newfound hobby: carriage driving. The prince thought the sport, which he had taken up at an older age after retiring from polo, might be a distracting outlet. “It was Phillip who encouraged Penny Romsey (now Countess Mountbatten) to take up carriage driving,” Ingrid Seward wrote in her biography of the consort, Prince Philip Revealed. “She expressed an interest in what she called ‘this driving thing” and asked him whether it might be possible to teach her daughter’s pony.”\n\nTheir closeness, as well as their age gap, led to speculation of an affair. (It wasn’t the first time: In the 1950s, Prince Philip also dodged rumors of marital strife.) The Crown walks a careful line in implying what exactly went on between the two: “She’s half your age,” Staunton’s Queen Elizabeth snarls at Philip during a state visit to Russia, where he admits he’s had to seek “companionship” elsewhere. “I don’t want to be asked to give up something when I’ve done nothing wrong,” Pryce’s Philip says back.\n\nThere’s no evidence that the two were anything more than friends—Seward, in her biography, notes that she had seen the two dancing happily and openly at a ball, an act she interpreted as “totally innocent” as it suggested they had nothing to hide. Indeed, Penny was very much embraced publicly by multiple Windsors, not just Prince Philip: In 1991 she stood on the balcony for Trooping the Colour with the entire royal family, and in 2006 she contributed to the documentary Ten Days That Made the Queen. She frequently attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show as a guest of the royals, being photographed by the media in the process. Prince Charles even gave away Penny’s daughter, Alexandra, at her wedding. When Prince Philip died in 2021, she was one of 30 people invited to his funeral; this year she also attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth."
