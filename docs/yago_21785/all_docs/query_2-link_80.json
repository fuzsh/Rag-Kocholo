        "text": "Bertha H. Long OBITUARY\n\nBERTHA H. LONG 1919-2015 Bertha H. Long, a homemaker and longtime resident of Trappe, where she was active in Augustus Lutheran Church and the Collegeville Community Club, died August 17, 2015 at Peter Becker Community in Harleysville after a long illness. She was 96. Bert was born in East Cocalico, PA. She and her future husband, Charles “Dutch” Long, both grew up in Robesonia, PA, attending the same elementary and high schools. Married on Thanksgiving Day, 1941, they celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary in 2014, a few days before he died. Bert and Dutch moved to Trappe in 1959. Both joined Augustus Lutheran Church, where they were enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers. Bert, with a few other church women, produced hundreds of quilts for Lutheran World Relief and knitted numerous Afghans. In the year of Bert’s 90th birthday alone, she and the team sewed more than 100 quilts. Like her mother, Bert was an accomplished seamstress. She won many county and state awards in sewing, quilting, knitting, and recycled crafts through the Community Club, including first place in the state in sewing and tailoring in 1983. After Dutch retired from General Electric in 1981 the couple enjoyed traveling and visiting family. During the last six to eight years of his life, Bert was Dutch’s primary caregiver, as he suffered from dementia. Bert dedicated her life to helping others through the church, the Community Club and informally. When she was 77 and her triplet grandchildren were born, she devoted most of every day to helping care for them and their brother in their first year. Always active, athletic and determined, she won many awards in school, in a bowling league, and later in Montgomery County senior games competitions. It was not unusual to find her shoveling snow from the driveway at age 95. Bert is survived by her daughter, Karen Long of Pleasant Hill, CA, and three sons, Steven Long of San Diego, Tom Long of Graterford and Russell Long of Norristown. Another son, Michael Long, died in 1998. There are five grandchildren, three step-grandchildren and one step-great-grandchild. She is also survived by Andrea Kaum of Phillipsburg, N.J., originally from Germany, whom Dutch and Bert met during a European trip, and who became a close friend of the family. Friends may call from 10 to 10:45 a.m. Saturday, Aug. 22 at Augustus Lutheran Church. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday at the church, with the Rev. Thomas T. Kochenderfer officiating. Burial will be in the church cemetery. Lunch will be served in the social hall. Memorial contributions may be made to the women’s group (WELCA), of Augustus Lutheran Church, 717 W. Main St., Trappe PA 19426, for use in their charitable projects. Arrangements are by Holcombe Funeral Home, Inc., Trappe."
