        "text": "1. Philip was born on 10 June 1921 as Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark\n\n2. He was born on the island of Corfu, at the palatial villa of Mon Repos\n\n3. It was the summer retreat of the Greek Royal Family\n\n4. At the time of his birth, he was sixth in line to the Greek throne\n\n5. His parents were Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg\n\n6. He was the couple’s only son and fifth child, with four older sisters, Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie and Sophie\n\n7. Despite being born in Greece, he doesn’t speak the language, but does understand some of it\n\n8. Instead, he has said he considered himself Danish\n\n9. He was trilingual, speaking English, French and German\n\n10. His family were exiled from Greece when he was a child after his uncle, King Constantine, was forced to abdicate following the Greco-Turkish War. As a general in the army, his own father, Prince Andrew, was accused of treason and exile, forcing the family to flee\n\n11. They first lived in Paris, staying at the home of his very wealthy aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark, who was known for her patronage of Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis\n\n12. Later Philip was sent to live with his relatives in Britain, while his father settled in Monaco and his mother was institutionalised in an asylum in Switzerland\n\n13. He lived with his maternal grandmother, Victoria Mountbatten, Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven, at Kensington Palace and with his uncle, George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire\n\n14. He was first sent to Cheam School, before being sent to a school in Germany owned by the family of his brother-in-law. Its founder, a Jewish educator named Kurt Hahn, left Germany amidst the rise in anti-semitism and Nazism, setting up Gordonstoun in Scotland, where the prince followed him\n\n15. Philip’s teenage years were marred by tragedy. His sister Cecilie was killed along with his nephews in a plane crash, and his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of bone marrow cancer not long afterwards\n\n16. Upon finishing school, he joined the Royal Navy and graduated from Dartmouth as the best cade in his year\n\n17. His sisters had all married German princes - a source of much difficulty as the world went to war with Hitler\n\n18. Philip served with the British forces in WWII - fighting against his brother-in-laws Prince Christoph of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, who served on the German side\n\n19. The Duke's first naval appointment, aged 18, was as a midshipman to HMS RAMILLIES, which escorted the first contingents of the Allied Expeditionary Force from Australia to Egypt\n\n20. He was awarded the Greek War Cross of Valour for his bravery during the War\n\n21. He was present in Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on 2nd September 1945\n\n22. He met the then Princess Elizabeth in 1939, after being asked by his uncle Lord Mountbatten and the Queen Mother to escort Elizabeth and her sister Princess Maragret during a visit to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth\n\n23. Philip and the Queen are third cousins - both descendants of Queen Victoria\n\n24. Elizabeth fell in love with the dashing naval officer with the two beginning to correspond when she was 13\n\n25. He was linked to several women in his youth, before becoming official with Elizabeth\n\n26. The most well-known of these was Olsa Benning a Canadian debutante, who worked at Bletchley Park\n\n27. She was the goddaughter of Lord Mountbatten, Philip’s uncle, but it was his other goddaughter Sarah Baring who played matchmaker\n\n28. Osla’s daughter said of the relationship, ‘I do know that he was her first love. She never told me about him for years. She just said: “I fell in love with a naval officer.”’\n\n29. In 1946, when Elizabeth was 20, Philip wrote to the King to ask for her hand in marriage\n\n30. The engagement was postponed until after her 21st birthday\n\n31. Philip abandoned his Greek and Danish titles in favour of the more Anglicised ‘Mountbatten’\n\n32. Before his wedding day, he became a naturalised British citizen\n\n33. He was considered to be something of a pin-up at the time, with several of the Queen’s Coronation Maids of Honour commenting on how handsome he was in their memories of the event\n\n34. He was married to Princess Elizabeth at Westminster Cathedral on 20 November 1947\n\n35. Their marriage is the longest running royal marriage in history\n\n36. The wedding was broadcast on the radio and listened to by 200 million people\n\n37. His sisters and their husbands were not invited to the wedding due to the ill feeling towards Germans at the time\n\n38. His mother did attend - despite now living as a nun in Greece\n\n39. On his wedding day, he was made High Royal Highness and was given the titles the Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich in the County of London by the King\n\n40. The married couple’s first home was at Clarence House, but they also spent a year living abroad in Malta, renting Villa Guardamangia, while Philip was serving with the navy there\n\n41. Together, he and the Queen have four children: Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward\n\n42. Their first two children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne, were born before Elizabeth became Queen in 1953, while Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were born a decade later during her reign\n\n43. It was Philip who broke the news to Elizabeth that her father had died and she was now the Queen\n\n44. The couple were on a Commonwealth Tour in Kenya at the time\n\n45. Upon the Queen’s ascension to the throne, there were question marks over whether she would remain as the House of Windsor, or possibly change the name due to her marriage. Philip reportedly advocated for House of Edinburgh, after his ducal title, but after further conversations with the likes of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the Queen announced that the House of Windsor would continue\n\n46. The fact that his wife and children were not given his surname was said to have troubled the Duke, who reportedly said, ‘I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children’\n\n47. In 1956, Philip founded the Duke of Edinburgh Award with his old school master, Kurt Hahn to give children, ‘a sense of responsibility to themselves and their communities’\n\n48. He became the first royal to cross the Antarctic Circle in 1957, while touring the globe on the HMY Britannia\n\n49. He was made a Prince in 1957\n\n50. He has been a patron of over 800 organisations, including the World Wildlife Fund, the British Heart Foundation and the International Equestrian Foundation, reflecting his interests in sport and the environment\n\n51. Like his sons and grandsons, Prince Philip was a keen polo player, playing until 1971\n\n52. He was also instrumental in carriage driving becoming a sport, even helping to write the early rule book\n\n53. He’s also known for his love of boats and being a keen yachtsman (no surprise as he was in the Royal Navy), frequently attending Cowes Week with the Queen in the past\n\n54. He is trained to fly numerous aircraft\n\n55. In 1953, he was presented with Royal Air Force wings\n\n56. He gained his helicopter wings in 1956…\n\n57. And his pilot license in 1959\n\n58. By his 70th birthday had clocked up 5,150 flying hours\n\n59. The Duke's final flight was on 11th August 1997 from Carlisle to Islay\n\n60. Aside from sporting pursuits, the Duke also had an arty side and collected numerous artworks - including several contemporary cartoons - which hang at the royal residences including Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and Balmoral\n\n61. He’s also had a go at painting himself and was said to have a bold, colourful style\n\n62. There are several books featuring forewards written by him, mostly on the subject of the Navy and British fauna and flora\n\n63. He had also written several books, mostly about environmental, technological, equestrian and animal subjects\n\n64. He was also reportedly quite the foodie - and had been known to take over dinner preparations\n\n65. Writing in Dinner at Buckingham Palace, former royal footman Charles Oliver revealed: ‘The Prince is also adept at producing quick, light supper snacks, which he and the Queen often enjoy after they have dismissed the servants for the night. Dishes include scrambled eggs and smoked haddock, mushrooms sautéed in butter with bacon, Scotch woodcock (scrambled eggs with anchovies on toast) with mushrooms, and omelette with bacon.’\n\n66. His favourite dishes included spicy food as well as salmon coulibiac\n\n67. In terms of a tipple of choice, he was a plain beer man - none of the fancy stuff\n\n68. He is said to have muttered, ‘Get me a beer. I don't care what kind it is. Just get me a beer!’ when he was offered fine wine by former Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato while dining in Rome\n\n69. There is a religious sect in a jungle village in the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu that worships Prince Philip as a God\n\n70. The origins of the religion appear to be in a myth about the son of a mountain spirit with pale skin venturing across the seas to look for a powerful woman to marry - when they saw pictures of Philip with the Queen, they believed it was him\n\n71. The islanders hold portraits of the Duke and celebrate his birthday every year with feasts\n\n72. He was given various honours and titles throughout his life, including Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps, Colonel-in-Chief of the British Army Cadet Force, and Air Commodore-in-Chief of the Air Training Corps, Admiral of the Fleet, Captain General Royal Marines, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force, Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, Lord High Admiral and finally Knight Grand Cross (GCVO) of the Royal Victorian Order\n\n73. This last means that he was the first British national since his uncle Earl Mountbatten of Burma to be entitled to wear the breast stars of four orders of chivalry in the United Kingdom\n\n74. Throughout his time undertaking engagements for the Queen, he became known for his occasional gaffes, saying things that were deemed politically incorrect\n\n75. He famously said of this tendency in 1960: ‘Dontopedalogy is the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years’\n\n76. He was the first member of the British Royal Family to be interviewed on television in May 1961\n\n77. He was instrumental in the restoration of Windsor Castle after it suffered a fire in 1992, and served as Chairman of the Restoration Committee\n\n78. In 1993 his DNA was used to help identify the remains of the Romanov family - Tsar Nicholas II and his wife and children - who were murdered in 1918\n\n79. He was related to the Romanovs on both his mother and father’s side of the family. He is a direct descendant of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia via his paternal grandmother Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia and his maternal grandmother, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, was a sister of Alexandra Feodorovna, wife of Emperor Nicholas II\n\n80. It has been said that Philip was instrumental in Prince Charles proposing to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, after asking him to make a decision on their relationship once and for all\n\n81. After Diana’s death in 1997, it was Philip who is said to have persuaded her sons Prince William and Prince Harry to walk behind her coffin, saying, ‘If you don't walk, I think you'll regret it later. If I walk, will you walk with me?’\n\n82. He joined Charles, William, Harry and Diana’s brother, Earl Spencer, walking in the procession behind the coffin\n\n83. It has been rumoured that he disliked Sarah, Duchess of York, the ex-wife of his son, Prince Andrew, due to the embarrassment he thought she caused the Royal Family\n\n84. Philip was the oldest ever male member of the British royal family, and the third longest-lived following Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother\n\n85. He was the longest serving Consort\n\n86. He accompanied the Queen on all 251 of her overseas tours\n\n87. During the 2012 Diamond Jubilee, the Queen acknowledged the effect that their relationship had had on her, saying Philip had been her ‘constant strength and guide’\n\n88. He retired from his royal duties on 2nd August 2017 aged 96\n\n89. The last time he appeared in ‘public’ for an official engagement was at Windsor Castle in July 2020 to hand the British Army Rifles Regiment to his daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall\n\n90. During the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, he made a rare public statement thanking key workers\n\n91. He has eight grandchildren - Prince William, Prince Harry, Zara Phillips, Peter Phillips, Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn - who he reportedly dotes on\n\n92. He also has ten great-grandchildren, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, Mia Tindall, Lena Tindall, Lucas Tindall, Savannah Phillips, Isla Phillips and August Brooksbank\n\n93. Philip has been portrayed many times on the big screen, with actors including Matt Smith, Tobias Menzies, Christopher Lee and Stewart Cromwell playing him\n\n94. He was reportedly a fan of The Royle Family - according to one of its stars, Ricky Tomlinson, who was tipped off by the Queen\n\n95. He had an official ‘colour’ - Edinburgh Green - which his staff wear and that lines his private cars\n\n96. He also had his own official standard, which showcases his Danish, Greek and English heritage as well as his Dukedom of Edinburgh\n\n97. It features lions and hearts for Denmark, a white cross on blue for Greece, two black ‘pales’ on white for the Mountbattens and finally the coat of arms of Edinburgh\n\n98. He is a ‘Freeman’ of Acapulco; Belfast; Bridgetown, Barbados; Cardiff; Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania; Edinburgh; Glasgow; Guadalajara; London; Los Angeles; Melbourne; Nairobi\n\n99. There were frequent rumours about his death, which, until 9 April 2021, had proven to be false – when at midday it was officially announced by Her Majesty the Queen in a heartfelt statement"
