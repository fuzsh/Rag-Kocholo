Filha do conde Florent I da Holanda e de Gertrude de Saxe, era neta materna de Bernardo II, duque da Saxónia. Depois da morte do seu pai em 1061, a sua mãe voltou a casar-se com Roberto I, conde da Flandres. Em 1072, este acordou uma aliança política com Filipe I de França, que incluía o seu casamento com o monarca francês.

Berta só gerou um herdeiro nove anos depois. A lenda popular conta que a sua fertilidade só foi restaurada graças às orações de um eremita, Arnaldo, que deu o nome de Luís à criança.

Em 1092 Filipe enamorou-se de com Bertranda de Monforte, condessa de Anjou, e repudiou Berta alegando consanguinidade, uma vez que eram primos afastados. Aprisionada pelo rei francês na fortaleza de Montreuil-sur-Mer, lá morreria a 30 de Julho de 1094.
