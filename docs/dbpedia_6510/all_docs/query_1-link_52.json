Kalash Valley is known for its unique traditions and culture which can not be found anywhere in the world.\n\nTour Highlights\n\nSpectacular mountain vistas throughout the Kalash Valley tour\n\nExplore the beauty of Islamabad and Chitral\n\nMeet the descendent of Alexander The Great & his Troops\n\nDance with the Kalash people and learn their Pagan culture\n\nUNESCO listed Kalash culture as an “Intangible Cultural Heritage”\n\nEnjoy Pakistani cuisine\n\nTour Overview\n\nKalash Valley is located in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Kalash is surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountain range and it’s an hour’s drive from Chitral town. The inhabitants of the Kalash valleys call the Kalash people, who have a unique culture, tradition, and language and follow a form of ancient Hinduism. As such, the Kalash Valleys are a source of attraction for International tourists. Kalash has three main valleys, Bumburet, Rumbur and Birir valley. The largest and most populous valley is Bumburet ( also known as Mumuret), reached by a road from Ayun in the Kunar Valley. Rumbur and Acholgah are side valleys north of Bumburet. The third valley, Biriu (Birir), is a side valley of Kunar Valley, south of Bumburet.\n\nThe population of Kalash is around 5,000 individuals, which makes them a religious and ethnic minority in Pakistan. Their customs and traditions are contradictory to the Islamic and Pakistani cultures. Kalash religion is a polytheist faith and they offer sacrifices to their Gods. The culture of Kalash is interlinked with their religion and based upon several festivals and celebrations. People generally do not intermarry or cohabit regions with local Muslims but neither are they hostile towards them. They are under the legal and constitutional protection of the state of Pakistan as a scheduled tribe.\n\nOur Kalash Valley Tour starts from Islamabad. Your guide will meet and greet you at Islamabad International Airport then transfer you to the hotel for a rest. We will meet again in the afternoon over dinner. Your Guide will give a detailed briefing about the Kalash Valley Tour. Next morning we will drive to the airport to catch the spectacular 1 hour mountain view flight to Chitral. Flights to Chitral are weather-dependent, in case of cancellation we will drive to Chitral. Rest and sightseeing in Chitral for one day then we will take our epic journey to explore the Kalash Valley. We will spend a few days exploring and enjoying the festivals of the PEGANS then follow the same itinerary back to Islamabad.\n\nWe Strongly believe that the Kalash Valley Tour is one of the richest and most eye-opening cultural retreats in the world. Kalash Valley Tour provides an amazing cultural experience in the Hindukusch mountain ranges among the ethnic minority community of Kalash. UNESCO listed Kalash culture as an “Intangible Cultural Heritage” in November 2018. The decision was announced during the 13th session of UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Committee meeting organised in Mauritius. Our tours to Chitral and Kalash valleys are normally referred to as “Kalash valley tours” since Kalash is the major attraction in the valley of Chitral and they have fixed dates for their annual festivals. The tours here are the fixed departures for Kalash Valley and Chitral, we also offer Tailor-made Tours for Kalash Valley throughout the year.\n\nKalash Valley – Home to a Pagan culture in Pakistan\n\nIn the 3rd century BC, on his mission and journeys through the Hindu Kush range, Alexander the Great and his troops left their footprints and descendants in what is today called the Kalash Valley, home to an ethnic community in Pakistan who are blue-eyed and fair-skinned.\n\nYes, that’s right. In one of the remotest parts of Pakistan, there is a tribal group who, after carrying out several DNA tests, have claimed ancestry as descendants of Alexander the Great and his army, meaning that they are direct descendants of the ancient Greek-Macedonian people.\n\nThis is one of the most popular theories but, in fact, over the last decades, the Kalash people have called the attention of numerous anthropologists from all over the world, who conducted several studies, trying to figure out where they come from. However, many of them have shown different results and conclusions, which means that the actual origin of the Kalash tribe remains unknown.\n\nLife today in the Kalash Valley\n\nToday, around 5,000 Kalash people live across 3 different valleys (figures are highly argued). Due to their remoteness, very far away from civilization, today, the Kalash people live a traditional, rural life which remains pretty untouched. Most families rely on the sun to have electricity, don’t have running water, are self-sufficient and live in wooden shacks. To be honest, life is quite hard here as they have very long, freezing winters and, unlike people from other parts of Pakistan, during winter, they don’t move to the cities but they remain in the valley.\n\nKalash festival\n\nWe recommend visiting the Kalash Valley during the Festival period. Festivals are,\n\nChilam Joshi Festival (Kalash Spring Festival) Mon 13 May – Thu 16 May\n\nUchal Festival (Kalash summer festival) Tue 20 Aug – Thu 22 Aug\n\nChoimus Festival (Kalash Winter Festival) Sun 15 Dec – Sun 22 Dec\n\nKalash festivals are an ancient cultural event which takes place every year around the same time. It’s a 4-day festival which happens across the 3 valleys, where people not only drink, dance and have fun in general but they also worship their Gods and spirits, giving offerings and even sacrifices. One of the fascinating traditions of the festival is, that young men and women choose their future husbands and wives in the middle of the dance. Attending the festival will be one of the highlights of the whole journey.\n\nWe are offering Three fixed departure tours for solo travellers in May-August and December for the Kalash Festivals.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ OUR TRIPADVISOR REVIEWS FOR THE KALASH VALLEY TOUR\n\nBrief Tour Itinerary\n\nD-1\n\nARRIVAL DAY IN ISLAMABAD:\n\nD-2\n\nSPECTACULAR FLIGHT TO CHITRAL:\n\nD-3\n\nSIGHTSEEING IN CHITRAL:\n\nD-4\n\nDRIVE TO KALASH VALLEY:\n\nD-5\n\nFESTIVAL DAY IN KALASH:\n\nD-6\n\nDRIVE BACK TO CHITRAL:\n\nD-7\n\nFLIGHT BACK TO ISLAMABAD:\n\nD-8\n\nDEPARTURE DAY-FLIGHT BACK HOME:\n\nAdditional information\n\nGradeEASYAttributesEarly Birds and Group Discounts availaible\n\nKalash Valley Tour Pakistan Dates & Prices 2024-25\n\nPrivate Groups – Chose Your Dates\n\nTour Start and finish in Islamabad-Domestic Flight Inc\n\nSTART DATES END DATES STATUS PRICE DEPOSIT REGISTRATION 11-May 18-May Guaranteed USD 1,200 USD 170 BOOK NOW 19-Aug 26-Aug Guaranteed USD 1,200 USD 170 BOOK NOW 15-Dec 22-Dec Guaranteed USD 1,200 USD 170 BOOK NOW\n\nAbove Kalash Valley Tour dates and prices are for solo travellers to join the fixed Departure Tours only.

(Government requirement)\n\nAirport transfers for Domestic & international flights.\n\nInternal flights and associated airport transfers\n\nAll land transport involved in the itinerary\n\nAccommodation as described\n\nAll meals\n\nAll permit fees.\n\nWHAT’S NOT INCLUDED\n\nTravel Insurance\n\nPakistan Visa Fee\n\nTips for local guides and support staff\n\nGuided Islamabad sightseeing\n\nMiscellaneous expenses\n\nsouvenirs etc.\n\nMEAL PLAN\n\nFully inclusive of all meals throughout, from lunch on Day 1 to breakfast on Day 8.\n\nACCOMMODATION\n\nDuring the Kalash Valley Tour, you will spend all nights in good International tourist standard hotels (3-4 star) in Islamabad and Chitral. Accommodation at each of these hotels is twin-sharing with en-suite facilities. If you are travelling by yourself you will be paired with another single client of the same sex. It is possible to hire a single room for an additional cost. Additional hotel nights in Islamabad are also available. For hotel prices and single supplement costs please refer to the dates and prices page of the trip on our website. Hotels are subject to availability and prices may vary.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHTS\n\nCHITRAL FLIGHT\n\nChitral is a weather-dependent airport. Since the valley is surrounded by high mountains, planes can only land here in good visibility and this means flights to and from Chitral are never guaranteed. The planes do fly more often than not, but cancellations can and do occur and in these circumstances, we will travel by road.\n\nHEALTH & VACCINATION\n\nYou should contact your doctor or travel clinic to check whether you specifically require any vaccinations or other preventive measures. You should be up to date with routine courses and boosters as recommended in the UK e.g. diphtheria-tetanus-polio and measles-mumps-rubella), along with hepatitis A and typhoid. Malarial prophylaxis is discretionary for this trip. Malaria exists in the area around Islamabad. However, incidences of urban transmission of malaria are extremely low. In Chitral, Kalash and the mountains there is no malaria risk. On holidays to more remote areas, you should also have a dentist check-up. A good online resource is Travel Health Pro. Dengue fever is a known risk in places visited. It is a tropical viral disease spread by daytime-biting mosquitoes. There is currently no vaccine or prophylaxis available and therefore the best form of prevention is to avoid being bitten. We recommend you take precautions to avoid mosquito bites\n\nINSURANCE\n\nWe highly recommend you have adequate travel insurance for your Kalash Valley Tour holiday with Trango Adventure Pakistan. We recognise the complexity and variety of choices in the insurance market and know that many of you either have your preferred insurer or have annual multi-trip cover in place already. If this is the case, please ensure that your insurer is aware of your Trango Adventure itinerary and can agree to cover the activities being undertaken.\n\nTrango Adventure does not provide any advice on travel insurance, although it is highly recommended that you have travel insurance which covers the activities which you are likely to be undertaking on your holiday.\n\nTravel Insurance Providers\n\nExpeditions or Treks\n\nHCC Medical Insurance Services LLC Tel: +1-800 605 2282\n\nTravelex Insurance Services Tel: +1-800 228 9792\n\nTrue Traveller Insurance Tel: 0333 999 3140 for treks including over 4500m\n\nAustrian Alpine Club (UK) Tel: +44 (0)1929 556870\n\nSnowcard Tel: +44 (0)1295 660836\n\nThe B.M.C.

This is not something that you should worry about; the human body is quite capable of adapting to a very wide range of altitudes, but we must follow some simple rules to acclimatize successfully. Before coming on this holiday you should get some basic advice on Tours at high altitudes.\n\nCLIMATE\n\nFrom mid-June to August, we can expect to encounter temperatures as high as 35°C in Islamabad and 25°C in the Chitral region. Weather is generally good throughout the summer season, with clear skies and little rain or snow. However, weather in mountainous areas is difficult to predict, and short-lived storms can occur at any time.\n\nBOOKS\n\nTrekking in Pakistan. Isobel Shaw.\n\nKarakoram Highway. King.\n\nIn the Throne Room of the Mountain Gods. Galen Rowell.\n\nK2 Triumph and Tragedy.

Please check the relevant embassy or consulate for other nationalities. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the correct travel documents and visas for your holiday. Visa requirements and charges are subject to change without notice.\n\nPAKISTAN VISA\n\nAll nationalities require a visa to enter Pakistan.
