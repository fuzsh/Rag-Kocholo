        "text": "PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Tourism Authority on Tuesday announced the beginning of a popular cultural festival in Pakistan’s northwestern Chitral region, saying the event had attracted large numbers of foreign and local tourists like in the past.\n\nThe Chilam Joshi festival is celebrated by the Kalash people, who are often described as pagan due to their religious beliefs and practices involving the worship of multiple gods and spirits, to mark the arrival of spring and celebrate the bounty of nature.\n\nKnown for music, dance, and colorful clothes, the festival is also associated with the preparation for new crops, symbolizing hope and prosperity for the community.\n\n“The ancient Kalash festival ‘Chilam Joshi’ has kicked off in full swing,” the KP tourism authority said in a statement. “Young women of Kalash danced to the beat of drums while wearing intricately embroidered garments, enhancing the colors of the festival.”\n\nThe statement added that district administration officials, members of the Kalash Development Authority and a large number of domestic and foreign tourists were also attending the festivity.\n\n“The district administration has arranged foolproof security for the festival,” it added. “Tourism police are also providing services for the guidance of tourists.”\n\nChilam Joshi is said to be the oldest festival of the Kalash tribe. It involves various rituals, the most well-known being the one where people dance with walnut branches in hand.\n\nThe festival will last for three days in the area known for its rugged terrain and scenic beauty. The annual event is considered integral to the identity of the indigenous Kalash community and the continuity of its ancient traditions.\n\nKARACHI: The urine sample of the main suspect in a headline-grabbing hit-and-run accident in Karachi in which two people were killed earlier this month had tested positive for methamphetamine or ‘ice,’ a lab report seen by Arab News on Thursday said.\n\nCCTV footage of the accident widely circulated on social media showed a fast moving Toyota Land Cruiser hitting a motorbike from behind, killing a female student and her father on August 19. Five others were also injured in the incident. The driver of the car, Natasha Iqbal, the wife of well-known businessman Danish Iqbal, was arrested at the spot of the accident.\n\nAs part of the investigation, blood and urine samples were collected on the day of the accident and submitted to a lab on Aug. 21. A report was released to police on Wednesday.\n\n“Methamphetamine (ice) detected in the given sample,” the report, a copy of which is available with Arab News, said of Iqbal’s urine sample.\n\nHer blood sample, however, showed “no narcotic, sedative, psychoactive, toxic or any other foreign compound/element.”\n\nSoon after the accident, Iqbal was admitted to Jinnah Hospital’s psychiatry ward after her family claimed she was suffering from psychiatric issues, and being treated with medication. She was sent on 14-day judicial remand last Wednesday.\n\nThe incident sparked outrage on social media, with many accusing the police of providing preferential treatment to Iqbal since she comes from a rich and influential family.\n\nTwo officials with direct knowledge of the investigation also confirmed the suspect had tested positive for methamphetamine. Arab News reached out to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Investigations Aleena Rajpar who did not comment on the lab report.\n\n“The report confirms that she was under the influence of ice,” a senior police official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media on the subject. “This finding will lead to an additional charge of driving under the influence of drugs.”\n\nAnother top official privy to the details of the case also said methamphetamine had been found in Iqbal’s urine sample.\n\n“It also didn’t find any signs of any medicines which the family claimed she was taking for psychiatric issues.”\n\nThe senior police official said Iqbal would be tried for manslaughter regardless of whether or not it was proven that she was intoxicated at the time of the incident. If a blood money compromise was reached between the two parties, Iqbal would still be tried for driving under the influence, he said.\n\n“The settlement might happen but the crime of drugs itself won’t be settled through compensation,” the official explained. “If the prosecution can prove this in the trial, she will be punished, if not, she will be acquitted.”\n\nProminent lawyer and rights activist Jibran Nasir agreed with the police official, saying if methamphetamine had been detected in Iqbal’s test results, then offenses under the Provincial Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1965 would be applicable in her case.\n\nSection 9 (2) under the Control of Narcotics Substances Act 1997 should also be added to the charges for the use or consumption of the drug, he added.\n\nNasir said Iqbal would be charged with manslaughter and not murder since the drugs were not consumed with the intention to run over someone.\n\n“The use of drugs, however, will prove the element of rash and negligence beyond reasonable doubt.” he added, “and the driver can get the maximum penalty of 10 years jail term.”\n\nISLAMABAD: Arshad Nadeem on Thursday received the Hilal-e-Imtiaz, the second-highest civilian award of Pakistan, for making history at the Paris Olympics by setting a new record for the longest javelin throw and winning a gold medal for his country.\n\nNadeem’s triumph is seen by Pakistanis, struggling with an economic crisis and rising militancy, as all the more impressive since he was born and raised in a mud brick house in an impoverished corner of rural Punjab and as a young man trained in wheat fields with homemade javelins.\n\nNadeem, who compared his Olympic clash with India’a Neeraj Chopra to the two nations’ legendary rivalry in cricket, has previously said it is challenging being a non-cricket athlete in Pakistan, where resources and facilities for his sport are scarce.\n\nBut now his record-breaking 92.97 meter javelin throw in Paris has earned Pakistan its first Olympic medal since the 1992 Barcelona Games and its first gold medal since the 1984 Los Angeles Games.\n\n“President Asif Ali Zardari has conferred Hilal-i-Imtiaz upon Olympic Gold Medalist Arshad Nadeem in recognition of his outstanding achievement in Paris Olympics-2024,” Radio Pakistan reported. “The award was given at a special investiture ceremony in Islamabad today [Thursday].”\n\nNadeem, 27, married with two children, comes from a poor family of eight children in the central Pakistani region of Khanewal, where he first began to dream of Olympic greatness.\n\nHis district barely had reliable water and electricity supplies, let alone proper sports facilities for him to train.\n\n“I am thankful to God almighty. I thank my parents and Pakistani nation,” Nadeem said as he returned home from Paris to a water canon salute and chants from thousands of supporters. “There is lot of hard work by me and my coach Salman Butt behind this.”\n\nISLAMABAD: General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, the Pakistani Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC), is on an official visit to the Sultanate of Oman where he discussed military cooperation with top officials, the army’s media wing said on Thursday.\n\nWhile in Oman, Mirza called on Sayyid Shihab bin Tariq bin Taimur Al-Said, Deputy Prime Minister for Defense Affairs, General Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Namani, the Minister of the Royal Office, Vice Admiral Abdullah bin Khamis Al-Raisi, the Chief of Staff Sultan Armed Forces (COSSAF), services chiefs and chairman of the Strategic and Defense Academy.\n\n“During separately-held meetings, both sides discussed military cooperation including training, security, counter-terrorism, defense industry and regional security environment; and acknowledged the commonality of views to expand military to military relationship and forge deeper strategic ties,” the Pakistan army said.\n\n“The Omani dignitaries acknowledged the sacrifices rendered by people and Armed Forces of Pakistan in the war against terrorism.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Islamabad invited Oman to invest in its agriculture, mineral and IT sectors under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), a civil-military hybrid body set up last year to attract foreign investment in Pakistan, especially from Gulf nations.\n\nAs part of a push to seek foreign investment, Pakistan participated in the eighth session of the Pakistan-Oman Bilateral Political Consultations, held on Tuesday in Muscat, Oman.\n\nThe two sides “comprehensively” reviewed all aspects of bilateral cooperation at the conference, including political relations, trade and investment, security and defense, culture, health and consular matters.\n\n“The Omani side was invited to invest in agriculture, minerals and Information Technology under the Special Investment Facilitation Council,” the Pakistani foreign office said in a statement.\n\n“Noting the importance of Joint Ministerial Commission, the two sides agreed to hold the 8th session at an early date in Islamabad. The two sides also agreed to further elevate bilateral trade volume and to enhance investment cooperation.”\n\nThe Omani side also expressed support for the First Pakistani Business Expo to be held in Muscat on October 13-14 and welcomed Pakistan’s decision to give visas on arrival to Omani nationals, the foreign office said.\n\nBilateral consultations are an important dialogue mechanism between Pakistan and Oman to review bilateral relations and explore new areas of cooperation.\n\nISLAMABAD: A potential cyclone that has developed over the Rann of Kutch in India is likely to emerge along the coast of Pakistan’s southern Sindh province late tonight, Thursday, or Friday morning, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said on Thursday.\n\nAccording to the PMD alert, a deep depression over the Rann of Kutch had very slowly moved west/southwest over the last 12 hours and now lay around 270 kilometers east/southeast of Karachi.\n\n“The system is likely to move west/southwestwards & emerge into northeast Arabian Sea along Sindh coast by late night/ tomorrow morning,” the statement read, adding that due to “favorable environmental conditions,” the system was likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm by tomorrow, Friday, and initially move in the west/southwest direction.\n\nUnder the system’s influence, widespread rain and thunderstorms, along with isolated heavy rainfall, were expected till Aug. 31 with occasional gaps in the Karachi division as well as Tharparkar, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Matiari, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad districts.\n\nSea conditions are likely to remain very rough with squally winds of 50 to 60 km per hour, the PMD alert warned, advising fishermen not to venture into the sea till August 31.\n\n“PMD’s cyclone warning center in Karachi is monitoring the system and will issue the update accordingly,” the statement said. “The concerned authorities are requested to keep them abreast through PMD advisory.”\n\nThe powerful weather system made its presence felt early on Tuesday morning with a windstorm and heavy showers lashing Karachi, disrupting life and damaging civic infrastructure.\n\nRawalpindi: Bangladesh are hoping to secure a first Test-series victory over Pakistan, who have left out star pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi for the second match starting in Rawalpindi on Friday.\n\nThe visitors upset a normally formidable home team with a clinical ten-wicket display in the first Test — Bangladesh’s first win in over 14 encounters against Pakistan.\n\nBut the hosts have been struggling through a lean spell of late, bowing out early in this year’s T20 World Cup. Their last Test series was a whitewash in a three-match tour to Australia.\n\nStar pacer Afridi struggled to find his rhythm through much of the innings, with Pakistan’s head coach Jason Gillespie saying he will be rested to allow him to spend time with his new-born son and family.\n\n“Obviously Shaheen will miss out on this game. We had a good conversation with him and he fully understands and appreciates the thinking behind it. We are just looking at what our best combination is for this game,” Gillespie said.\n\nThe home team have recalled spinner Abrar Ahmed after going with an all-pace attack in the first Test.\n\nFormer Australian pacer Gillespie admitted it will be a challenge to square the series.\n\n“We want to go out there and play positive,” said Gillespie, who is in his first series with Pakistan. “It’s about scoring lots of singles and with our bowling we want to be ruthless and challenging the opposition batters.”\n\nBut he backed under-pressure skipper Shan Masood who failed with the bat with six and 14 in the first match, and has lost all four of his Tests as captain.\n\n“Shan is a very positive captain,” said Gillespie.\n\n“He wants to play and win games .... we showed that with our intent in the first game but it didn’t quite work out and that’s credit to our opposition.\n\n“That game is gone, but what we can do is focus on the game starting tomorrow.\n\nBangladesh head coach Chandika Hathurusinghe was confident his side could recreate their heroics from the first Test.\n\n“The morale of the players is very, very good,” said former Sri Lankan batsmen Hathurusinghe.\n\n“Obviously beating Pakistan in Pakistan is not an easy task.”\n\nPakistan were rattled by the Bangladesh response to their first-innings total of 448-6, crumbling for a paltry 146 in their second outing.\n\nA brilliant 191 by veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim on a flat Rawalpindi pitch helped the visitors rack up their highest-ever total against Pakistan of 565 to take a crucial 117-run first-innings lead.\n\nSpinners Mehidy Hasan Miraz (4-21) and Shakib Al Hasan (3-44) then rocked the hosts and made them rue not playing a frontline spinner.\n\nBut Hathurusinghe said the second game would be a big challenge.\n\n“They are a very strong team and we expect a very good fight in the second Test as well but we will not be different from the first game and know our strength as well as that of Pakistan’s.”\n\nSince gaining Test status in 2000, Bangladesh have only won two of their 32 overseas series with wins in the West Indies (2009) and Zimbabwe (2021), drawing three and losing 27.\n\nBangladesh’s pace attack will be boosted by the return of experienced Taskin Ahmed who recovered from a shoulder injury but will have a tie with Nahid Rana for a place in the eleven.\n\nIntermittent rain and bad weather in Rawalpindi prevented both teams from having a practice session."
