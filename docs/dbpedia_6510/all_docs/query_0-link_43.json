Provided with coreaction coefficient kij, the discrepancies of liquid molar volume data for R22+Rl14 and R22+R142b using PR equation are 7.7% and 8.1% , respectively. When HBT (Hankinson-Brobst-Thomson) equation was joined with PR equation, the deviations are reduced to less than 1.5% for both R22+Rl14 and R22+R142b.\n\nApplications of the Peng-Robinson Equation of State Using MATLAB[R\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNasri, Zakia; Binous, Housam\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA single equation of state (EOS) such as the Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS can accurately describe both the liquid and vapor phase.

In accord with a challenge to correlate the binary and/or ternary interatction parameters as functions of temperature, we have also applied the present modified Peng-Robinson equation of state to the promising alternative HFC refrigerant mixtures, i.e., R-32/125,R-32/134a and R-32/125/134a systems. The developed equation of state improves significantly its effectiveness for practical engineering property calculations at refrigerantion and air-conditioning industries in comparison with conventional Peng-Robinson equation.\n\nTwo-Phase Fluid Simulation Using a Diffuse Interface Model with Peng--Robinson Equation of State\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nQiao, Zhonghua; Sun, Shuyu\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this paper, two-phase fluid systems are simulated using a diffusive interface model with the Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS), a widely used realistic EOS for hydrocarbon fluid in the petroleum industry.

Hussain\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Mixture phase equilibrium and thermodynamic properties have a significant role in industry. Numerical analysis of flash calculation generates an appropriate solution for the problem. In this research, a comparison of Soave Redlich Kwong (SRK and Peng-Robinson (PR equations of state predicting the thermodynamic properties of a mixture of hydrocarbon and related compounds in a critical region at phase equilibrium is performed. By applying mathematical modeling of both equations of states, the behavior of binary gases mixtures is monitored. The numerical analysis of isothermal flash calculations is applied to study the pressure behavior with volume and mole fraction. The approach used in this research shows considerable convergence with experimental results available in the literature.\n\nThermodynamic consistency test procedure using orthogonal collocation and the Peng-Robinson equation of state\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHamm, L.L.; Van Brunt, V.\n\n1982-08-01\n\nThe Christiansen and Fredenslund programs for calculating vapor-liquid equilibria have been modified by replacing the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state with the newly developed Peng-Robinson equation of state. This modification was shown to be a decided improvement for high pressure systems, especially in the critical and upper retrograde regions. Thermodynamic consistency tests were developed and used to evaluate and compare calculated values from both the modified and unmodified programs with reported experimental data for several vapor-liquid systems\n\nA Componentwise Convex Splitting Scheme for Diffuse Interface Models with Van der Waals and Peng--Robinson Equations of State\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nFan, Xiaolin\n\n2017-01-19\n\nThis paper presents a componentwise convex splitting scheme for numerical simulation of multicomponent two-phase fluid mixtures in a closed system at constant temperature, which is modeled by a diffuse interface model equipped with the Van der Waals and the Peng-Robinson equations of state (EoS). The Van der Waals EoS has a rigorous foundation in physics, while the Peng-Robinson EoS is more accurate for hydrocarbon mixtures. First, the phase field theory of thermodynamics and variational calculus are applied to a functional minimization problem of the total Helmholtz free energy. Mass conservation constraints are enforced through Lagrange multipliers. A system of chemical equilibrium equations is obtained which is a set of second-order elliptic equations with extremely strong nonlinear source terms. The steady state equations are transformed into a transient system as a numerical strategy on which the scheme is based. The proposed numerical algorithm avoids the indefiniteness of the Hessian matrix arising from the second-order derivative of homogeneous contribution of total Helmholtz free energy; it is also very efficient. This scheme is unconditionally componentwise energy stable and naturally results in unconditional stability for the Van der Waals model. For the Peng-Robinson EoS, it is unconditionally stable through introducing a physics-preserving correction term, which is analogous to the attractive term in the Van der Waals EoS. An efficient numerical algorithm is provided to compute the coefficient in the correction term. Finally, some numerical examples are illustrated to verify the theoretical results and efficiency of the established algorithms. The numerical results match well with laboratory data.\n\nTwo-Phase Fluid Simulation Using a Diffuse Interface Model with Peng--Robinson Equation of State\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nQiao, Zhonghua\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this paper, two-phase fluid systems are simulated using a diffusive interface model with the Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS), a widely used realistic EOS for hydrocarbon fluid in the petroleum industry. We first utilize the gradient theory of thermodynamics and variational calculus to derive a generalized chemical equilibrium equation, which is mathematically a second-order elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) in molar density with a strongly nonlinear source term. To solve this PDE, we convert it to a time-dependent parabolic PDE with the main interest in its final steady state solution. A Lagrange multiplier is used to enforce mass conservation. The parabolic PDE is then solved by mixed finite element methods with a semi-implicit time marching scheme. Convex splitting of the energy functional is proposed to construct this time marching scheme, where the volume exclusion effect of an EOS is treated implicitly while the pairwise attraction effect of EOS is calculated explicitly. This scheme is proved to be unconditionally energy stable. Our proposed algorithm is able to solve successfully the spatially heterogeneous two-phase systems with the Peng-Robinson EOS in multiple spatial dimensions, the first time in the literature. Numerical examples are provided with realistic hydrocarbon components to illustrate the theory. Furthermore, our computational results are compared with laboratory experimental data and verified with the Young-Laplace equation with good agreement. This work sets the stage for a broad extension of efficient convex-splitting semi-implicit schemes for numerical simulation of phase field models with a realistic EOS in complex geometries of multiple spatial dimensions.\n\nStability and Convergence Analysis of Second-Order Schemes for a Diffuse Interface Model with Peng-Robinson Equation of State\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nPeng, Qiujin; Qiao, Zhonghua; Sun, Shuyu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we present two second-order numerical schemes to solve the fourth order parabolic equation derived from a diffuse interface model with Peng-Robinson Equation of state (EOS) for pure substance.

Peng-Robinson (PR) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) are most successful in the CEOSs which have repeatedly been modified in order to improve their accuracy in wider ranges of temperature and pressure. Unfortunately, most of modifications carried out on these EOSs have no adequate justification for selecting either of these as the basic starting point for the modifications. In this paper, PR and SRK EOSs were critically compared with each other using some new features of their subcritical and supercritical results. For this purpose, the CEOSs were assessed using comprehensive tests of the PVT calculations in the vapor-liquid equilibrium (for pure hydrocarbons over a wide range of acentric factor values: Methane, Ethane Propane, Butane, Heptane and Nonane) and Joule-Thomson Inversion Curves' (JTICs) predictions (for compounds which have reliable JTICs data: Methane, Ethane, Ethylene, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon and Carbon dioxide) in subcritical and supercritical regions, respectively. The results indicated that the PR EOS by using any of realistic Î±-function forms will never be able to accurately predict the JTICs in full span. On the other hand, the subcritical results revealed that the great success of the PR CEOS in predicting liquid phase density is only due to its function in shifting the results of the SRK CEOS to the lower values with the same curve trend. In addition, the Patel and Teja's (PT) EOS, has been reevaluated and the results showed that most of the defects of PR EOS still remain. This article suggests that in order to develop CEOSs, the original SRK EOS is a better candidate than original and alternative forms of PR EOS.\n\nModification of Peng Robinson EOS for modelling (vapour + liquid) equilibria with electrolyte solutions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBaseri, Hadi; Lotfollahi, Mohammad Nader\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHighlights: â Extended PR-EOS was presented for VLE of H 2 O/Salt/CO 2 systems at high pressure. â The proposed EPR-EOS is based upon contributions to the Helmholtz energy. â Born, Margules, and Debye-Huckel or mean spherical approximation terms were used. â Two different mixing rules Panagiotopoulos and Reid and Kwak and Mansoori (KM) were used. â A combination of KM mixing rule with DH term results more accurate VLE results. - Abstract: A modification of the extended Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR-EOS) is presented to describe the (vapour + liquid) equilibria of systems containing water and salts. The modification employs three additional terms including a Born term, a Margules term and two terms separately used for estimation of the long-range electrostatic interactions (the Debye-Huckel (DH) or the mean spherical approximation (MSA) terms). Effects of two mixing rules, first, the Panagiotopoulos and Reid mixing rule (PR) and, second, the Kwak and Mansoori mixing rule (KM), on the final values of VLE calculations are also investigated. The results show that the KM mixing rule is more appropriate than the PR mixing rule. The proposed equation of state is used to calculate the (vapour + liquid) equilibrium (VLE) of the systems containing (water + sodium sulphate + carbon dioxide) and (water + sodium chloride + carbon dioxide) at high pressure. The comparison of calculated results with the experimental data shows that a combination of KM mixing rule with the DH term results a more accurate VLE values.\n\nThermodynamically consistent simulation of nonisothermal diffuse-interface two-phase flow with Peng-Robinson equation of state\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nKou, Jisheng; Sun, Shuyu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we consider a diffuse-interface gas-liquid two-phase flow model with inhomogeneous temperatures, in which we employ the Peng-Robinson equation of state and the temperature-dependent influence parameter instead of the van der Waals equation of state and the constant influence parameter used in the existing models. As a result, our model can characterize accurately the physical behaviors of numerous realistic gas-liquid fluids, especially hydrocarbons. Furthermore, we prove a relation associating the pressure gradient with the gradients of temperature and chemical potential, and thereby derive a new formulation of the momentum balance equation, which shows that gradients of the chemical potential and temperature become the primary driving force of the fluid motion. It is rigorously proved that the new formulations of the model obey the first and second laws of thermodynamics. To design efficient numerical methods, we prove that Helmholtz free energy density is a concave function with respect to the temperature under certain physical conditions. Based on the proposed modeling formulations and the convex-concave splitting of Helmholtz free energy density, we propose a novel thermodynamically stable numerical scheme. We rigorously prove that the proposed method satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Finally, numerical tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed simulation method.\n\nThermodynamically consistent simulation of nonisothermal diffuse-interface two-phase flow with Peng-Robinson equation of state\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nKou, Jisheng\n\n2017-12-06\n\nIn this paper, we consider a diffuse-interface gas-liquid two-phase flow model with inhomogeneous temperatures, in which we employ the Peng-Robinson equation of state and the temperature-dependent influence parameter instead of the van der Waals equation of state and the constant influence parameter used in the existing models.

This model requires good values of the binary interaction parameter kij . In this work, we developed a semi-empirical correlation for kij partly based on the Huron-Vidal mixing rules. We obtained values for the adjustable parameters of the developed formula for over 60 binary systems and over 10 categories of components. The predictions of the new equation system were slightly better than the constant-kij model in most cases, except for 10 systems whose predictions were considerably improved with the new correlation.\n\nUnconditionally stable methods for simulating multi-component two-phase interface models with Peng-Robinson equation of state and various boundary conditions\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nKou, Jisheng\n\n2015-03-01\n\nIn this paper, we consider multi-component dynamic two-phase interface models, which are formulated by the Cahn-Hilliard system with Peng-Robinson equation of state and various boundary conditions. These models can be derived from the minimum problems of Helmholtz free energy or grand potential in the realistic thermodynamic systems. The resulted Cahn-Hilliard systems with various boundary conditions are fully coupled and strongly nonlinear. A linear transformation is introduced to decouple the relations between different components, and as a result, the models are simplified. From this, we further propose a semi-implicit unconditionally stable time discretization scheme, which allows us to solve the Cahn-Hilliard system by a decoupled way, and thus, our method can significantly reduce the computational cost and memory requirements. The mixed finite element methods are employed for the spatial discretization, and the approximate errors are also analyzed for both space and time. Numerical examples are tested to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods.

Application of the ERAS-model and Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera equation of state\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFattahi, M.; Iloukhani, H.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nDensities, viscosities, and refractive indices of the ternary mixture consist of {2-methyl-2-butanol (1) + tetrahydrofuran (THF) (2) + propylamine (3)} at a temperature of 298.15 K and related binary mixtures were measured at temperatures of (288.15, 298.15, and 308.15) K at ambient pressure. Data were used to calculate the excess molar volumes and the deviations of the viscosity and refractive index. The Redlich-Kister and the Cibulka equations were used for correlating binary and ternary properties, respectively. The ERAS-model has been applied for describing the binary and ternary excess molar volumes and also Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera (PRSV) equation of state (EOS) has been used to predict the binary and ternary excess molar volumes and viscosities.\n\nInvestigation on molecular interactions of binary mixtures of isobutanol with 1-alkanols (C1 - C6) at different temperatures. Application of the Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera (PSRV) equation of state (EOS)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKhanlarzadeh, K.; Iloukhani, H.; Soleimani, M.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nDensities were measured for binary mixtures of isobutanol with 1-alkanols, namely: methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol at the temperatures of (288.15, 298.15 and 308.15) K and ambient pressure. Excess molar volumes, VmE , thermal expansion coefficients Î±, excess thermal expansion coefficients Î±E, and isothermal coefficients of pressure excess molar enthalpy, (âHmE / â P) T , x , were derived from the experimental data and the computed results were fitted to the Redlich-Kister equation. The Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera (PRSV) equation of state was applied, in combination with simple mixing rules to predict the excess molar volume. The VmE results were positive for the mixtures of isobutanol with methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, and negative for isobutanol with 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol over the whole composition range. The results showed very small deviations from the behavior of ideal solutions in these mixtures and were analyzed to discuss the nature and strength of intermolecular interactions.\n\nModelling (vapour + liquid) and (vapour + liquid + liquid) equilibria of {water (H2O) + methanol (MeOH) + dimethyl ether (DME) + carbon dioxide (CO2)} quaternary system using the Peng-Robinson EoS with Wong-Sandler mixing rule\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYe Kongmeng; Freund, Hannsjoerg; Sundmacher, Kai\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHighlights: â Phase behaviour modelling of H 2 O-MeOH-DME under pressurized CO 2 (anti-solvent) using PRWS. â PRWS-UNIFAC-PSRK has better performance than PRWS-UNIFAC-Lby in general. â Reliable to extend the VLE and VLLE phase behaviour from binary to multicomponent systems. â Successful prediction of the VLE and VLLE of binary, ternary, and quaternary systems. â Potential to apply the model for designing new DME separation process. - Abstract: The (vapour + liquid) equilibria (VLE) and (vapour + liquid + liquid) equilibria (VLLE) binary data from literature were correlated using the Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state (EoS) with the Wong-Sandler mixing rule (WS). Two group contribution activity models were used in the PRWS: UNIFAC-PSRK and UNIFAC-Lby. The systems were successfully extrapolated from the binary systems to ternary and quaternary systems. Results indicate that the PRWS-UNIFAC-PSRK generally displays a better performance than the PRWS-UNIFAC-Lby.\n\nExergy analysis on throttle reduction efficiency based on real gas equations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLuo, Yuxi; Wang, Xuanyin\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper proposes an approach to calculate the efficiency of throttling in which the exergy (available energy) is used to evaluate the energy conversion processes. In the exergy calculation for real gases, a difficult part of integration can be removed by judiciously advised thermodynamic paths; the compressibility factor is calculated by using Peng-Robinson (P-R) equation. It is found that the largest deviation between the exergies calculated by the real gas equation and ideal gas assumption is about 1%. Because the exergy is a function of the pressure and temperature, the Joule-Thomson coefficients are used to calculate the temperature changes of throttling, based on the compressibility factors of the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (S-R-K) and P-R equations, and the temperature decreases are compared with those calculated by empirical formula. The result shows that the heat exergy contributes very little in throttling. The simple equation of ideal gas is suggested to calculate the efficiency of throttling for air at atmospheric temperatures.\n\nApplications of the Soave-Redlich-Kwong Equations of State Using Mathematic\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSun, Lanyi; Zhai, Cheng; Zhang, Hui\n\nThe application of the Peng-Robinson equations of state (PR EOS) using Matlab and Mathematic has already been demonstrated. In this paper, using Mathematic to solve Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) EOS, as well as the estimation of pure component properties, plotting of vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) diagram and calculation of chemical equilibrium, is presented. First the SRK EOS is used to predict several pure-component properties, such as liquid and gas molar volumes for isobutane. The vapor-liquid isobaric diagram is then plotted for a binary mixture composed of n-pentane and n-hexane under the pressures of 2*10^5 and 8*10^5 Pa respectively.\n\nUncertainty Assessment of Equations of State with Application to an Organic Rankine Cycle\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nFrutiger, Jerome; Bell, Ian; OâConnell, John P.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEvaluations of equations of state (EoS) with application to process systems should include uncertainty analysis.

Uncertainties of the Eo......S input parameters, including their corresponding correlation structure, are quantified from the data using a bootstrap method. A Monte Carlo procedure propagates parameter input uncertainties onto the process output.

C. D. Freitas\n\n2013-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Ionic liquids (IL have been described as novel environmentally benign solvents because of their remarkable characteristics. Numerous applications of these solvents continue to grow at an exponential rate. In this work, high pressure vapor liquid equilibria for 17 different IL + gas binary systems were modeled at different temperatures with Peng-Robinson (PR and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK equations of state, combined with the van der Waals mixing rule with two binary interaction parameters (vdW-2. The experimental data were taken from the literature. The optimum binary interaction parameters were estimated by minimization of an objective function based on the average absolute relative deviation of liquid and vapor phases, using the modified Simplex algorithm. The solubilities of all gases studied in this work decrease as the temperature increases and increase with increasing pressure. The correlated results were highly satisfactory, with average absolute relative deviations of 2.10% and 2.25% for PR-vdW-2 and SRK-vdW-2, respectively.\n\nModeling solubilities of gases in the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate using the Peng-Robinson equation of state\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nAlthuluth, M.A.M.; Berrouk, A.S.; Kroon, M.C.; Peters, C.J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this paper, vaporâliquid equilibrium (VLE) data of binary mixtures containing gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, ethane, propane, or butane in the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate ([emim][FAP]) have been modeled using the PengâRobinson\n\nUSO DA EQUAÃÃO DE ESTADO DE PENG-ROBINSON COM REGRA DE MISTURA DEPENDENTE DA COMPOSIÃÃO NA PREDIÃÃO DO EQUILÃBRIO DE FASES DO SISTEMA TERNÃRIO CO2-LIMONENO-CITRAL\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlessandra Lopes de OLIVEIRA\n\n1997-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Dados de equilÃ­brio de fases a pressÃµes elevadas dos sistemas binÃ¡rios CO2-Limoneno e CO2-Citral e do sistema ternÃ¡rio CO2-Limoneno-Citral foram coletados da literatura e usados na modelagem termodinÃ¢mica que emprega a equaÃ§Ã£o de estado de PENG-ROBINSON [1] com: 1 Regra de mistura clÃ¡ssica; 2 Regra de mistura dependente da composiÃ§Ã£o de STRYJEK & VERA [2].

In the course of determination of these coordinates, the equilibrium mole fractions at these points are also calculated. In this algorithm, the property of the distance from the free energy surfaces to a tangent plane in equilibrium condition is added to saturation calculation as an additional criterion. An equation of state (EoS) was needed to calculate all required properties. Therefore, the algorithm was tested with Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK), Peng-Robinson (PR), and modified Nasrifar-Moshfeghian (MNM) equations of state. For different EoSs, the impact of the binary interaction coefficient ( k ij) was studied. The impact of initial guesses for temperature and pressure was also studied. The convergence speed and the accuracy of the results of this new algorithm were compared with experimental data and the results obtained from other methods and simulation softwares such as Hysys, Aspen Plus, and EzThermo.\n\nExcess molar enthalpies of binary systems containing 2-octanone, hexanoic acid, or octanoic acid at T = 298.15 K\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLiao, Wei-Chen; Lin, Ho-mu; Lee, Ming-Jer\n\n2012-01-01\n\nHighlights: â An isothermal titration calorimeter was used for enthalpy data measurement. â The investigated binary systems contain 2-octanone, hexanoic acid, or octanoic acid. â The excess enthalpies are all positive except for mixtures containing DMSO and DMF. â The Peng-Robinson equation with two parameters yielded the best representation. - Abstract: An isothermal titration calorimeter was used to measure the excess molar enthalpies (H E ) of six binary systems at T = 298.15 K under atmospheric pressure. The systems investigated include (1-hexanol + 2-octanone), (1-octanol + 2-octanone), (1-hexanol + octanoic acid), (1-hexanol + hexanoic acid), {N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) + hexanoic acid}, and {dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) + hexanoic acid}. The values of excess molar enthalpies are all positive except for the DMSO- and the DMF-containing systems. In the 1-hexanol with hexanoic acid or octanoic acid systems, the maximum values of H E are located around the mole fraction of 0.4 of 1-hexanol, but the H E vary nearly symmetrically with composition for other four systems. In addition to the modified Redlich-Kister and the NRTL models, the Peng-Robinson (PR) and the Patel-Teja (PT) equations of state were used to correlate the excess molar enthalpy data. The modified Redlich-Kister equation correlates the H E data to within about experimental uncertainty. The calculated results from the PR and the PT are comparable. It is indicated that the overall average absolute relative deviations (AARD) of the excess enthalpy calculations are reduced from 18.8% and 18.8% to 6.6% and 7.0%, respectively, as the second adjustable binary interaction parameter, k bij , is added in the PR and the PT equations. Also, the NRTL model correlates the H E data to an overall AARD of 10.8% by using two adjustable model parameters.\n\nHigh pressure phase equilibrium of ternary and multicomponent alkane mixtures in the temperature range from (283â473) K\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nRegueira MuÃ±iz, Teresa; Liu, Yiqun; Wibowo, Ahmad A.\n\n2017-01-01\n\n/n-butane/n-octane/n-dodecane/n-hexadecane/n-eicosane as model reservoir fluids and measured their phase equilibrium in the temperature range from (283â473) K by using a variable volume cell with full visibility.

Recently Orlov has claimed to find serious flaws in Robinson's proof of his sum rule. In view of the importance of the subject, I have independently examined the derivation of the Robinson radiation damping sum rule. Orlov's criticisms are without merit: I work through Robinson's derivation and demonstrate that Orlov's criticisms violate well-established mathematical theorems and are hence not valid. I also show that Robinson's derivation, and his damping sum rule, is valid in a larger domain than that treated by Robinson himself: Robinson derived his sum rule under the approximation of a small damping rate, but I show that Robinson's sum rule applies to arbitrary damping rates. I also display more concise derivations of the sum rule using matrix differential equations. I also show that Robinson's sum rule is valid in the vicinity of a parametric resonance.\n\nMulti-scale diffuse interface modeling of multi-component two-phase flow with partial miscibility\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nKou, Jisheng; Sun, Shuyu\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a diffuse interface model to simulate multi-component two-phase flow with partial miscibility based on a realistic equation of state (e.g. Peng-Robinson equation of state).

The Peng-Robinson equation of state has traditionally been used to simulate the above cryogenic process. Multi parameter Helmholtz energy equations are now preferred for determining the properties of natural gas. They have, however, been used only to predict vapour-liquid equilibria, and not vapour-liquid-liquid equilibria that can occur in mixtures used in cryogenic mixed refrigerant processes. In this paper the vapour-liquid equilibrium of binary mixtures of nitrogen-methane, nitrogen-ethane, nitrogen-propane, nitrogen-isobutane and three component mixtures of nitrogen-methane-ethane and nitrogen-methane-propane have been studied with the Peng-Robinson and the Helmholtz energy equations of state of NIST REFPROP and compared with experimental data available in the literature.\n\nApplication of PC-SAFT and cubic equations of state for the correlation of solubility of some pharmaceutical and statin drugs in SC-CO2\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAbdallah El Hadj.

The experimental data for studied compounds were taken from literature at temperature and pressure in ranges (308-348 K and (100-360 bar respectively. The critical properties required for the correlation with PR and SRK were estimated using Gani and Noonalol contribution group methods whereas, PC-SAFT pure-component parameters; segment number (m, segment diameter (Ï and energy parameter (Îµ/k have been estimated by tihicâs group contribution method for nabumetone. For phenylbutazone and salicylamide those parameters were determined using a linear correlation. For statin drugs, PC-SAFT parameters were fitted to solubility data, and binary interaction parameters (kij and lij have been obtained by fitting the experimental data. The result was found to be in good agreement with the experimental data and showed that PC-SAFT approach can be used to model solid-SCF equilibrium with better correlation accuracy than cubic equations of state.\n\nPeng Liyuanâs humanitarianism\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHood, Johanna\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCelebrity in China is booming, yet the patterns, meanings and monitoring of Chinese celebrity and cause adoption both share and differ from western forms, history and phenomenon.

Two such thermodynamic models, the Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS) and a model based on Henry's law constants, are proposed for the ternary mixture N 2 + O 2 + CO 2. Pure substance parameters of the Peng-Robinson EOS are taken from the literature, whereas the binary parameters of the Van der Waals one-fluid mixing rule are adjusted to experimental binary VLE data. The Peng-Robinson EOS describes both binary and ternary experimental data well, except at high pressures approaching the critical region. A molecular model is validated by simulation using binary and ternary experimental VLE data. On the basis of this model, the Henry's law constants of N 2 and O 2 in CO 2 are predicted by molecular simulation. An easy-to-use thermodynamic model, based on those Henry's law constants, is developed to reliably describe the VLE in the CO 2-rich region.\n\nPerformance of predictive models in phase equilibria of complex associating systems: PC-SAFT and CEOS/GE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nN. Bender\n\n2013-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Cubic equations of state combined with excess Gibbs energy predictive models (like UNIFAC and equations of state based on applied statistical mechanics are among the main alternatives for phase equilibria prediction involving polar substances in wide temperature and pressure ranges. In this work, the predictive performances of the PC-SAFT with association contribution and Peng-Robinson (PR combined with UNIFAC (Do through mixing rules are compared. Binary and multi-component systems involving polar and non-polar substances were analyzed. Results were also compared to experimental data available in the literature. Results show a similar predictive performance for PC-SAFT with association and cubic equations combined with UNIFAC (Do through mixing rules. Although PC-SAFT with association requires less parameters, it is more complex and requires more computation time.\n\nChanges of refractive indices in ternary mixtures containing chlorobenzene + n-hexane + (n-heptane or n-octane at 298.15 K\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nM.

The experimental refractive indices and the ternary derived properties are compared with the data obtained using several predictive semi-empirical models.

The PR EoS is based on very simplified physical foundations, it has significant limitations in the accuracy of the predicted thermodynamic properties. On the other hand, the PC-SAFT EoS combines different intermolecular forces, e.g., hydrogen bonding, covalent bonding, Coulombic forces which makes it more accurate in predicting of the physical variables. We continued in our previous works [2,3] by solving the boundary value problem which arose by mathematical solution of the DGT formulation and including the boundary conditions. Achieving the numerical solution was rather tricky; this study describes some of the crucial developments that helped us to overcome the partial problems. The most troublesome were computations for low temperatures where we achieved great improvements compared to [3]. We applied the GT for the n-alkanes: nheptane, n-octane, n-nonane, and n-decane because of the availability of the experimental data. Comparing them with our numerical results, we observed great differences between the theories; the best results gave the combination of the GT and the PC-SAFT. However, a certain temperature drift was observed that is not satisfactorily explained by the present theories.\n\nEquations for calculating hydrogeochemical reactions of minerals and gases such as CO2 at high pressures and temperatures\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAppelo, C. A. J.; Parkhurst, D. L.; Post, V. E. A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCalculating the solubility of gases and minerals at the high pressures of carbon capture and storage in geological reservoirs requires an accurate description of the molar volumes of aqueous species and the fugacity coefficients of gases. Existing methods for calculating the molar volumes of aqueous species are limited to a specific concentration matrix (often seawater), have been fit for a limited temperature (below 60 Â°C) or pressure range, apply only at infinite dilution, or are defined for salts instead of individual ions. A more general and reliable calculation of apparent molar volumes of single ions is presented, based on a modified Redlich-Rosenfeld equation. The modifications consist of (1) using the Born equation to calculate the temperature dependence of the intrinsic volumes, following Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF), but with Bradley and Pitzerâs expression for the dielectric permittivity of water, (2) using the pressure dependence of the extended Debye-HÃ¼ckel equation to constrain the limiting slope of the molar volume with ionic strength, and (3) adopting the convention that the proton has zero volume at all ionic strengths, temperatures and pressures. The modifications substantially reduce the number of fitting parameters, while maintaining or even extending the range of temperature and pressure over which molar volumes can be accurately estimated. The coefficients in the HKF-modified-Redlich-Rosenfeld equation were fitted by least-squares on measured solution densities. The limiting volume and attraction factor in the Van der Waals equation of state can be estimated with the Peng-Robinson approach from the critical temperature, pressure, and acentric factor of a gas. The Van der Waals equation can then be used to determine the fugacity coefficients for pure gases and gases in a mixture, and the solubility of the gas can be calculated from the fugacity, the molar volume in aqueous solution, and the equilibrium constant.

Vapor-liquid equilibrium was modeled with Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong equations, using a methodology proposed in 1979 by Asselineau, Bogdanic and Vidal. Experimental vapor-liquid equilibrium data on binary mixtures formed with carbon dioxide and compounds usually found in orange essential oil were used to test the model. These systems were chosen to demonstrate that the maximum likelihood method produces binary interaction parameters for cubic equations of state capable of satisfactorily describing phase equilibrium, even for a binary such as ethanol/CO2. Results corroborate that the Peng-Robinson, as well as the Soave-Redlich-Kwong, equation can be used to describe phase equilibrium for the following systems: components of essential oil of orange/CO2.Foi empregado o mÃ©todo da mÃ¡xima verossimilhanÃ§a generalizado para determinaÃ§Ã£o de parÃ¢metros de interaÃ§Ã£o binÃ¡ria entre os componentes do Ã³leo essencial de laranja e diÃ³xido de carbono.

The need for better reservoir fluid modeling and characterization is of great importance to petroleum engineers who deal with thermodynamic related properties of petroleum fluids at every stage of the petroleum \"life span\" from its drilling, to production through the wellbore, to transportation, metering and storage. Equations of state methods are far less expensive (in terms of material cost and time) than laboratory or experimental forages and the results are interestingly not too far removed from the limits of acceptable accuracy. In most cases, the degree of accuracy obtained, by using various EOS's, though not appreciable, have been acceptable when considering the gain in time. The possibility of obtaining an equation of state which though simple in form and in use, could have the potential of further narrowing the present existing bias between experimentally determined and popular EOS estimated results spurred the interest that resulted in this study. This research study had as its chief objective, to develop a new equation of state that would more efficiently capture the thermodynamic properties of gas condensate fluids, especially the liquid phase density, which is the major weakness of other established and popular cubic equations of state. The set objective was satisfied by a new semi analytical cubic three parameter equation of state, derived by the modification of the attraction term contribution to pressure of the van der Waal EOS without compromising either structural simplicity or accuracy of estimating other vapor liquid equilibria properties. The application of new EOS to single and multi-component light hydrocarbon fluids recorded far lower error values than does the popular two parameter, Peng-Robinson's (PR) and three parameter Patel-Teja's (PT) equations of state.

Our aim is to compute pressures exerted by the fluid molecules and to investigate how they change due to pore proximity by assuming the pore wall is inert. No additional scaling of model parameters is imposed and original volume and energy parameters are used in the calculations. Our results clearly show the phase changes due to confinement.

Our aim is to compute pressures exerted by the fluid molecules and to investigate how they change due to pore proximity by assuming the pore wall is inert. No additional scaling of model parameters is imposed and original volume and energy parameters are used in the calculations. Our results clearly show the phase changes due to confinement.

An evolution model for describing the dynamics of two-phase fluid system is based on Fickâs law of diffusion for multi-component fluids and the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The mobility is obtained from diffusion coefficients by relating the gradient of chemical potential to the gradient of molar density. The evolution equation for moles of each component is derived using the discretization of diffusion equations, while the volume evolution equation is constructed based on the mechanical mechanism and the Peng-Robinson equation of state. It is proven that the proposed evolution system can well model the VT-flash problem, and moreover, it possesses the property of total energy decay. By using the Euler time scheme to discretize this evolution system, we develop an energy stable algorithm with an adaptive choice strategy of time steps, which allows us to calculate the suitable time step size to guarantee the physical properties of moles and volumes, including positivity, maximum limits, and correct definition of the Helmhotz free energy function. The proposed evolution method is also proven to be energy-stable under the proposed time step choice. Numerical examples are tested to demonstrate efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.\n\nA Finite Difference, Semi-implicit, Equation-of-State Efficient Algorithm for the Compositional Flow Modeling in the Subsurface: Numerical Examples\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nSaavedra, Sebastian\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe mathematical model that has been recognized to have the more accurate approximation to the physical laws govern subsurface hydrocarbon flow in reservoirs is the Compositional Model. The features of this model are adequate to describe not only the performance of a multiphase system but also to represent the transport of chemical species in a porous medium. Its importance relies not only on its current relevance to simulate petroleum extraction processes, such as, Primary, Secondary, and Enhanced Oil Recovery Process (EOR) processes but also, in the recent years, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration. The purpose of this study is to investigate the subsurface compositional flow under isothermal conditions for several oil well cases. While simultaneously addressing computational implementation finesses to contribute to the efficiency of the algorithm. This study provides the theoretical framework and computational implementation subtleties of an IMplicit Pressure Explicit Composition (IMPEC)-Volume-balance (VB), two-phase, equation-of-state, approach to model isothermal compositional flow based on the finite difference scheme. The developed model neglects capillary effects and diffusion. From the phase equilibrium premise, the model accounts for volumetric performances of the phases, compressibility of the phases, and composition-dependent viscosities. The Equation of State (EoS) employed to approximate the hydrocarbons behaviour is the Peng Robinson Equation of State (PR-EOS). Various numerical examples were simulated. The numerical results captured the complex physics involved, i.e., compositional, gravitational, phase-splitting, viscosity and relative permeability effects. Regarding the numerical scheme, a phase-volumetric-flux estimation eases the calculation of phase velocities by naturally fitting to phase-upstream-upwinding. And contributes to a faster computation and an efficient programming development.\n\nExperimental measurement of vapor pressures and (vapor + liquid) equilibrium for {l_brace}1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R134a) + propane (R290){r_brace} by a recirculation apparatus with view windows\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDong Xueqiang [Key Laboratory of Cryogenics, Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O.

The saturated vapor pressures data were correlated by a Wagner type equation and compared with the reference data. The binary VLE data were correlated with the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EoS) incorporating the Huron-Vidal (HV) mixing rule utilizing the nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) activity coefficient model. For mixtures, the maximum average absolute relative deviation of pressure is 0.15%, while the maximum average absolute deviation of vapor phase mole fraction is 0.0045.

The uncertainties for the temperature, pressure, and compositions measurements for the phase equilibria are Â±0.1 K, Â±0.01 kPa and Â±0.0004, respectively. A qualitative analysis of the variation of the properties with changes in solvent and temperature was performed. The Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EoS), coupled with the Wong-Sandler mixing rule (WS), is used to describe the experimental data. To calculate activity coefficients we used three different models: NRTL, UNIQUAC, and COSMO-SAC. Since the predictive liquid activity coefficient model COSMO-SAC is used in the Wong-Sandler mixing rule, the resulting thermodynamic model is a completely predictive one. The prediction results for the density and for the (vapor + liquid) equilibria have a deviation lower than 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively. The (vapor + liquid) equilibria predictions show a good description for the propionaldehyde system and only a qualitative description for the valeraldehyde system.\n\nTravelling wave solutions to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNickel, J.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nCombining the approaches given by Baldwin [Baldwin D et al.

K.\n\n2006-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The capabilities of cubic Equations of State (EoS in the correlation and the prediction of phase equilibria at hyperbaric conditions is examined. PVT data of pure compounds as well as VLE and volumetric data of binary mixtures up to 2000 bar are used. Correlation and prediction results are presented with the translated and modified Peng-Robinson (t - mPR EoS and EoS/GE models. The performance of cubic EoS with a single interaction parameter (kij in describing VLE is remarkable considering the level of pressures involved. The same is valid for the PVT results including the relative liquid volumes of the C1/nC24 system. With typical errors of about 10% deviations in pressure of 100 - 200 bar are, of course, encountered which can be eliminated by the use of second interaction coefficient in the covolume combining rule. Predicted kij values obtained from generalized correlations developed from low pressure VLE data provide reasonable results for systems with hydrocarbons up to nC16 even at high pressures, but fail for higher asymmetric ones. Volume translation is essential for PVT predictions. The temperature independent translation of t - mPR and that of Jhaveri and Yougren give very satisfactory results. LCVM provides the best results of the EoS/GE models studied and gives very good predictions for rather symmetric systems which become poorer with asymmetric ones at very high pressures.

This model is based on Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS) and it considers the binary interaction parameters (Kij(T)) estimated by a contribution group method and dependent of the temperature. The model proposed by Jaubert e Mutelet (2004), named PPR78 (Predictive Peng-Robinson), was implemented in this work by using the Fortran language. An optimization approach based on the stochastic algorithm of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was used in order to calculate the vapor-liquid equilibrium. Simulations were accomplished for several binary systems and the results were concordant with some experimental data of the investigated systems. However, for some systems different from those presented by Jaubert and Mutelet (2004), the model presented low prediction capacity. In spite of the great demand of computational performance, the algorithm PSO demonstrated robustness during the calculation of VLE and it assured convergence in most of the cases.

[Honeywell, Calgary, AB (Canada)\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThis presentation described specialty fluid packages for modeling oil and gas process systems involving sour gases in contact with aqueous phase. UniSim Design is a popular process simulation tool in the oil and gas industry. The sour Peng-Robinson (PR) and sour Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) models are commonly used for handling sour system where hydrogen sulphide (H{sub 2}S), carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}) or ammonia (NH{sub 3}) are in contact with an aqueous phase. These sour options combine the PR/SRK equation of state and Wilson's API-sour model where the equation of state is used to determine the fugacities of the vapor and liquid hydrocarbon phases, plus the enthalpy for all 3 phases. The Wilson's API-sour method is used for the aqueous phase calculations, which accounts for the ionization of H{sub 2}S, CO{sub 2} and NH{sub 3} in the aqueous phase. The efficiency of these 2 thermodynamic property packages were evaluated in this study by comparing industrial and experimental data and the results from other similar models. The purpose of this study was to improve these property packages for more accurate and reliable modeling of sour systems. tabs., figs.\n\nApplication d'une Ã©quation d'Ã©tat Ã la simulation du comportement thermodynamique des fluides dans les gisements et dans les installations de surface Application of an Equation of State to Simulating the Thermodynamic Behaviour of Fluids in Reservoirs and Surface Installations\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJain C.\n\n2006-11-01\n\nFull Text Available La connaissance des propriÃ©tÃ©s thermodynamiques des fluides pÃ©troliers, en particulier des masses volumiques et des coefficients d'Ã©quilibre liquide-vapeur, intervient Ã divers stades de la production : primaire, secondaire par in-jection de gaz (C02 ou hydrocarbures miscibles, vapeur d'eau, sÃ©paration, rÃ©seau de collecte et de transport.

Their massive and illegal use in animal therapy and prophylaxis inevitably causes the presence of traces in foods of animal origin (milk and meat, which creates several problems for human health. With the aim to prevent the negative impact of Î²-lactam and, in particular, PenG residues present in the milk on customer health, many countries have established maximum residue limits (MRLs. To cope with this problem here, we propose an effective alternative, compared to the analytical methods actually employed, to quantify the presence of penicillin G using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR method. In particular, the PenG molecule was conjugated to a protein carrier to immunize a rabbit and produce polyclonal antibodies (anti-PenG. The produced antibodies were used as molecular recognition elements for the design of a competitive immune-assay for the detection of PenG by SPR experiments. The detection limit of the developed assay was found to be 8.0 pM, a value much lower than the MRL of the EU regulation limit that is fixed at 12 nM. Thus, our results clearly show that this system could be successfully suitable for the accurate and easy determination of PenG.\n\nPneumatic Performance Study of a High Pressure Ejection Device Based on Real Specific Energy and Specific Enthalpy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJie Ren\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available In high-pressure dynamic thermodynamic processes, the pressure is much higher than the air critical pressure, and the temperature can deviate significantly from the Boyle temperature. In such situations, the thermo-physical properties and pneumatic performance canât be described accurately by the ideal gas law. This paper proposes an approach to evaluate the pneumatic performance of a high-pressure air catapult launch system, in which esidual functions are used to compensate the thermal physical property uncertainties of caused by real gas effects. Compared with the Nelson-Obert generalized compressibility charts, the precision of the improved virial equation of state is better than Soave-Redlich-Kwong (S-R-K and Peng-Robinson (P-R equations for high pressure air. In this paper, the improved virial equation of state is further used to establish a compressibility factor database which is applied to evaluate real gas effects. The specific residual thermodynamic energy and specific residual enthalpy of the high-pressure air are also derived using the modified corresponding state equation and improved virial equation of state which are truncated to the third virial coefficient. The pneumatic equations are established on the basis of the derived residual functions. The comparison of the numerical results shows that the real gas effects are strong, and the pneumatic performance analysis indicates that the real dynamic thermodynamic process is obviously different from the ideal one.\n\n78 FR 18224 - Airworthiness Directives; Robinson Helicopter Company Helicopters\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-03-26\n\n...

It is determined that the conventional mixing rules together with the modified van der Waals equation, or the four-parameter equation, are suitable for calculating VLE values for the selected systems at cryogenic conditions. The Peng-Robinson and four-parameter equations may yield slightly better results for helium-containing systems\n\nPhase behavior of (CO2 + methanol + lauric acid) system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFerreira, Franciele M.; Ramos, Luiz P.; Ndiaye, Papa M.; Corazza, Marcos L.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHighlights: â We measured SVL, LLE and VLE for the binary system {lauric acid + methanol + CO 2 }. â Bubble point and dew point were measured at high pressures. â The experimental data were modeled using the Peng-Robinson equation of state with the classical van der Waals mixing rule. - Abstract: In this study the phase equilibrium behaviors of the binary system (CO 2 + lauric acid) and the ternary system (CO 2 + methanol + lauric acid) were determined. The static synthetic method, using a variable-volume view cell, was employed to obtain the experimental data in the temperature range of (293 to 343) K and pressures up to 24 MPa. The mole fractions of carbon dioxide were varied according to the systems as follows: (0.7524 to 0.9955) for the binary system (CO 2 + lauric acid); (0.4616 to 0.9895) for the ternary system (CO 2 + methanol + lauric acid) with a methanol to lauric acid molar ratio of (2:1); and (0.3414 to 0.9182) for the system (CO 2 + methanol + lauric acid) with a methanol to lauric acid molar ratio of (6:1). For these systems (vapor + liquid), (liquid + liquid), (vapor + liquid + liquid), and (solid + fluid) transitions were observed. The phase equilibrium data obtained for the systems were modeled using the Peng-Robinson equation of state with the classical van der Waals mixing rule with a satisfactory correlation between experimental and calculated values.\n\nROBINSON, ROUSSEAU, Y RODRIGUEZ: EL NAUFRAGIO DE LA UTOPÃA LATINOAMERICANA EN LA ISLA DE ROBINSON DE ARTURO USLAR PIETRI\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nCalderÃ³n Le Joliff, Tatiana; Fierro Bustos, Juan Manuel\n\n2013-01-01\n\nEl presente artÃ­culo busca estudiar las relaciones, expuestas en la novela histÃ³rica La Isla de Robinson (1981) de Arturo Uslar-Pietri, entre el personaje ficcional y mÃ­tico Robinson Crusoe, el filÃ³sofo Jean-Jacques Rousseau y el educador utopista SimÃ³n RodrÃ­guez.
