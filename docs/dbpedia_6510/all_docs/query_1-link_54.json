        "text": "Introduction\n\nKala-azar / visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important protozoan disease usually caused by Leishmania donovani complex. VL is expanded in the Old and New Worlds and transmitted by sand flies. It is estimated that the annual occurrence of human VL is 500,000 worldwide (1). Mediterranean VL is endemic in some parts of Iran, including Ardabil (Meshkin shahr and Moghan), eastern Azerbaijan (Kalibar and Ahar), Fars (Firouz abad, Jahrom, Noor abad and Darab), Bushehr (Dashti and Dashtestan) and Qom (Khaljestan) districts. In other provinces of Iran the disease has been reported in sporadic form (2–7). Altogether, more than 3000 cases of VL had been diagnosed in 31 Iranian provinces up to 2010. About 40% of VL cases are reported from northwestern Iran. The average annual number of the diagnosed cases of VL in Iran during last decade was 0.449 cases/100,000 inhabitants. The highest incidence rate of VL was 57 cases/100,000 inhabitants from Ardabil Province, northwestern Iran (8).\n\nCanine are the major reservoir hosts of Mediterranean VL. Canine L. infantum infections were determined to be 14.2%, 17.4% and 21.6% in different parts of Iran (9–12). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected dogs are the most important source of infection for human (1, 5, 13). Sand flies are the vectors of parasite and natural leptomonad infections were observed in four species of phlebotomus sand flies in some parts of Iran (14–16).\n\nRecently Keyghobadi et al. reported 8 cases of kala-azar disease in some areas of Kermanshah Province from 2005-2008. These 8 patients were from areas such as Javanroud, Paveh, Sarpol-zahab, Ravansar and Dalahoo (17). From 1990-94, five children and from 2004-2009 nine children, have been diagnosed as kala-azar disease in Kermanshah hospitals. L. infantum has been reported as the causative agent of disease using PCR technique (18).\n\nAn appropriate serological test developed for field use is the direct agglutination test (DAT) as a quantitative test. This test has been extensively validated in most endemic areas (19–22). DAT, was developed and described for serodiagnosis and sero-epidemiological studies of VL (19, 20). DAT was also modified and used as a simple, reliable, cost-effective and suitable tool for the diagnosis and sero-epidemiological surveys of VL in human and canine reservoir hosts of the disease in Iran (9, 23, 24).\n\nBecause there is not any information about seroprevalence of VL in Kermanshah Province, western Iran this study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of VL using DAT in high risk villages of the province.\n\nResults\n\nStudied villages for detection of seroprevalence of human visceral Leishmania infection in Kermanshah Province is shown in . Totally 1800 serum samples collected from 22 villages in five districts.\n\nTable 1\n\nDistrictVillagesNo. of seraDalahooYaran-olia,yaran sofla,Ghelgheleh,Jhalkeh190Paveh & JavanroudKalash luolem,Kalash lameh,Kalash ghoveh,Marzan,galileh,Baneh werah,Sar Koran,Chou zari,Ordougah,Sar yas600RavansarMasour aghaei,Gheshlagh,Tazeh abad640Sarpol-zahabRamaki sofla,Ramaki olia,Jawanmiri,Bani howan,Hasan solaiman370 Total 1800\n\nAge and gender distribution of samples can be seen in . About 53.6% of samples were collected from males and 46.4% from females. The most and the least samples were collected from age groups of 10-14 years old (38.6%) and adults ≥ 15 years old (9.9%) respectively.\n\nTable 2\n\nAge groups (yr)MalesFemalesTotalNo. of sera%No. of sera%No. of sera%0-417855.314444.732217.95-931451.929148.160533.610-1434649.834950.269538.6≥1512771.35128.71789.9Total96553.683546.41800100\n\nFrequency of anti-Leishmania antibody titers with DAT according to the age groups can be seen in .

The most important symptoms in Kala-azar patients were fever, hepato-spleenomegally and anemia. Four of six cases with titers of ≥1:3200 had a history of kala-azar disease in recent years and Leishman bodies had been seen in their bone marrows. But two others (33.3%) did not have any history of disease. Review of hospital records of Kala-azar patients in the province in the past years, revealed that the main symptoms were fever (89%), hepato-splenomegaly (79%) and anemia (75.5%).\n\nDiscussion\n\nDespite the diversity of climate and ecological conditions and the presence of numerous cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Kermanshah Province (27–29), there was not any information about status of visceral leishmaniasis in this province. This is the first study which detects the seroprevalence of VL in Kermanshah Province and gives us some important information about this disease in the province.\n\nAnalysis of data showed that about 0.33% of population were seropositive and had anti-Leishmania antibodies at titers of ≥1:3200. During 2002-2005 the seroprevalence of VL (DAT ≥ 1:3200) in some parts of the country were as follows: Ardabil Province [Germi (2.8%), Meshkinshahr (6.3%), Ardabil, Pars-Abad, and Khalkhal(5.1%)], Chahar Mahal & Bakhtiari province[Koohrang (2.3%)], Fars Province [Mamasani (1.9%)], Lorestan Province [Poshtkuh (1.3%)], Kohgiloyeh & Bouir ahmad Province [Yasuj (1.5%)], Khorasan Province [ Bojnurd and Shirvan, (46/0%)] (23). Hamzavi et al. found 3.4% of seropositivity in Dashti and Dashtestan Districts of Bushehr Province (5). Fakhar et al. found 1.7% of seropositivity in 8 villages of Ghahan from Qom Province that three of seven seropositive cases had a previous history of VL (7). Results showed that the rate of seropositivity in Kermanshah is fewer than these areas.\n\nThe most cases of seropositive cases were seen in Sarpol-zahab (50%). The rate of seropositivity in Paveh and Javanrood was 33.3% and 1.7% respectively. It seems that the importance of VL in these areas is more than other parts of the province. Some cases of VL in the villages of Sarpol-zahab and Javanrood in the past years have been reported (18).\n\nThe most seropositivity rate (0.5%) was seen in the age group of 5-9 years old. Presence of two cases with previous history of VL in this age group may be a reason for elevation of seropositivity in this age group. 66.7% and 83.3% of seropositive cases were in the age groups of 0-9 and 0-12 years old respectively. Prior studies in Iran had shown a seroprevalence rate of about 50% in the age group of 1-2 years old and 96% of sero-positive cases were in children up to 8 years of age (2). In endemic areas of Iran 98% of VL were observed in the children under ten years old and most of them were in rural communities and nomadic tribes (9).\n\n0.31% and 0.36% of seropositive cases was seen in males and females respectively. Therefore, it does not seem that VL affects females more than males, at least in Kermanshah Province. In earlier study in Bushehr Province we found 3.8% and 3.0% of seropositivity in males and females respectively, and no statistically significant difference was observed between them (5). In some rural areas the rate of active kala-azar cases in males may be higher than females but this difference was not statistically significant (22).\n\nIn this study fever, hepato-splenomegaly and anemia were predominant clinical features. The most predominant clinical features of 142 diagnosed kala-azar cases found in the report of Mohebali et al. were fever, weakness, paleness, and hepato-splenomegaly. These signs and symptoms are the same as those found in other clinical studies (22). Kala-azar in Iran has been reported from asymptomatic to severe and fatal cases. In some parts of Iran asymptomatic forms is much more than symptomatic disease (5, 6, 30), and may be more than 32% of seropositive individuals require no treatment (31). Four of the six seropositive cases (66.6%) had a history of kala-azar. The other two cases (33.4%) did not have any signs or symptoms and can be considered as asymptomatic form.\n\nIn Iran, constantly new foci of VL have been identified in the past years. Emerging of VL in different parts of the country needs to rapid diagnosis and treatment of disease, which can reduce the incidence of severe illness and death. Due to the emergence of VL in some parts of the province, it should be necessary that clinicians have more attention to VL in differential diagnosis of diseases. On the other hand it is important to increase the awareness of people, especially in high risk parts of the province to refer to appropriate health and medical centers whenever persistent fever, anemia and a large abdomen developed in their children."
