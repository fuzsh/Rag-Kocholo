        "text": "Dubai: Britain’s Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge were mesmerised to watch the unique culture, tradition and dance in the stunning Kalash Valley in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan.\n\nOn the third day of their visit to Pakistan, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Prince William and Kate visited the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountain range to witness the effects of climate change — one of the key areas of focus of their visit.\n\nDuring their tour of Chitral, they visited the remote Kalash Valley which is known for its unique culture and traditions found nowhere in the world. Resident of Kalash Valley are known as descendants of Alexander the Great.\n\nThey visited one of the villages of Kalash called Bombaret and were accorded warm welcome by the Kalash known for their hospitality.\n\nThe Royal couple toured the village, met locals and also spent time with children. They also enjoyed performances of traditional dances and music by the Kalash people wearing their unique attire. A cap traditionally worn by Kalasha women was also gifted to the Duchess.\n\n“They were very happy, meeting and shaking hands with everyone,” a district administration official said of William and Kate, adding that the couple also took keen interest in the Kalash culture.\n\nWhere is Kalash Valley\n\nSeveral historians have written about the Kalash and most of them have linked them to descendants of the army of Alexander the Great since many of their rituals, customs and traditions are indicative of the way of life of the ancient Greeks. The Kalash with their unique culture, traditions, rituals, values, festivals and attire are not be found anywhere else in the world. The Kalash are considered ‘infidels’ and their habitations are known as ‘Kafirastan’ — the land of infidels — amongst the local Pakistani community. The Kalash valleys are located in Chitral in the northern district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa province bordering Afghanistan.\n\nKalash people lead a centuries-old primitive way of life with a religion, which has no name, no written book or prophets. The three Kalash valleys — Bumburet, Rumber and Birir — are situated to the south west of Chitral town at distances of 40, 43 and 36 kilometres respectively.\n\nChitral Visit\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Royal couple was flown from Islamabad in a Pakistan Army chopper to Chitral, where they were gifted traditional hats and a book of photos commemorating the trip of William’s mother, Diana, who visited the valley in 1991.\n\nThe couple visited Chiatibo Glacier in Hindu Kush mountain range in Chitral to witness effects of climate change and consequences of global warming, said PTI on its official Twitter account.\n\nPrince William and his wife Kate wore traditional Chitrali outfits as they arrived in the formerly princely state Chitral which is considered one of the most scenic places in the world at an elevation of 1,494 metres above the sea level.\n\nWhile Prince William wore the Chitrali hat and a coat, Kate wore the hat and a shawl, which was also worn by Prince William’s mother the late Princes Diana during her visit to the scenic valley in 1991.\n\nDuke and Duchess of Cambridge has arrived in Pakistan on a five-day trip on October 14."
