Kalash shoes are white in color in all of Hawraman; thus, we didn’t have that many customers, so I started mixing colors into it. Our village receives many tourists; I started with one colorful Kalash; the tourists loved it! Back then, Kalash used to be worn only by men, but with this new design, women now wear it even more. At first, only 35 people made Kalash in the village, but now women and girls in every household are occupied with the craft. The village is dubbed Kalash Village in Iran.”"
