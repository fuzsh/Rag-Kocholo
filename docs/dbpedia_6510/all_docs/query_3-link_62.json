including one kolbar, were injured by landmine blasts and another civilian was killed after an unexploded shell went off in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.\n\nDetentions and arrests\n\nThroughout July, Iranian forces detained at least 49 people in Iranian Kurdistan, including four members of the Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan and three children.\n\nAt least four of these people were jailed to serve prison sentences.\n\nPrison sentences\n\nIn July, Iranian courts sentenced three people to prison sentences varying from two years to five years.\n\nWhile two of these people were charged with “acting against national security through membership of the KDPI”, another was charged with “propaganda against the state”.\n\nKillings of civilians\n\nOn 29 July, Iranian police killed a 20 years old
