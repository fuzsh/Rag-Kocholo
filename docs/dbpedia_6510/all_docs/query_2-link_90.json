Kalasha people live in the Kalash Valley of Pakistan. Kalash Valley is surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountain range. Kalash festival takes place three times a year, in spring, summer and in the winter. The spring festival is called Chilam Joshi festival, which starts around the 13 of May. Summer festival called Uchal festival, which begins on 20 August. The winter festival is called Choimus Festival, which starts on 15 December. During the festival, people not only drink, dance and have fun in general, but they also worship their Gods and spirits, giving offerings and even sacrifices. Also, during this festival, young men and women choose their future husbands and wives.\n\nKalash festival dates 2024:\n\nChilam Joshi Festival (Kalash Spring Festival) 13 May – 16 May\n\nUchal Festival (Kalash summer festival) 20 Aug – 22 Aug\n\nChoimus Festival (Kalash winter festival) 15 Dec – 22 Dec.\n\nTrango Adventure has been organizing tours to Kalash Valley to witness the Kalash festival for 40 years. We operate an 8-10 days long private and solo group Tours to Kalash. All our festival tours and other holidays in Pakistan are on a full-board basis. You can follow our standard Kalash festival itinerary, or our travel advisor can customise an itinerary according to your travel needs.\n\nOur Kalash festival Tour starts from Islamabad. Islamabad is the purpose-built capital of Pakistan. Our representative will meet you at the Islamabad International Airport and transfer you to the group hotel. The rest of the day is free to recover from the journey. We will meet again in the afternoon to give you a briefing about the Kalash festival tour. The next morning, you will be transferred to the airport to catch the spectacular 1-hour mountain view flight to Chitral. Flights to Chitral are weather-dependent, in case of cancellation, you will drive to Chitral. Arrive in Chitral, check into your hotel, and the rest of the afternoon is free to explore the town.\n\nThe next day, you will drive to Kalash Valley. You will spend a few days exploring and enjoying the Kalash festivals, meet the PEGANS, and then follow the same itinerary back to Islamabad. Night stay in Islamabad, and the next morning, we will transfer you to Islamabad International Airport for your flight back home.\n\nWe strongly believe that the Kalash festival tour is one of the top cultural retreats in the world. This beautiful valley and the friendly Kalasha people will make your holiday a lifetime journey.\n\nFestivals of Kalash\n\nThe people of Kalash celebrate their festivals three times a year.\n\nSpring festival (Chilam Joshi festival)\n\nSummer Festival (Uchal festival)\n\nWinter Festival (Choimus festival).\n\nSpring festival – (Chilam Joshi festival)\n\nSpring festival is also known as the Chilam Joshi festival. The people of Kalash celebrate four days across all Kalash valleys. Spring festival begins with “Milk Day”. Ten days before the festival, they store milk from their households. The people of Kalash offered their libation during this event. The festival reflects their unique cultural richness, the harmony in their society and the message of peace to the world. They ask for blessings from their God and pray for a prosperous year of agriculture and the health and safety of their herds. During this festival, Kalashi men and women also chose their life patterns. During the Kalash festival, women wear traditional attire with lively colours, and their dresses have patterns of flowers on them. They wear beaded necklaces which complement their dresses and headgear.\n\nMen wear traditional Shalwar Kameez with a waistcoat made of wool. They dance together and sing in valley tribes as it allows them to choose their life partners and announce their names on the last day of the festival.\n\nKalash Summer festival: (Kalash Uchal festival)\n\nThe people of Kalash celebrate the arrival of summer in their way. The summer festival is popular among the Kalasha people. In recent years, this festival has also gained popularity around the world. People from different parts of Pakistan and international tourists attend the summer festival in large numbers. During the festival, Kalasha People pay homage to their God by celebrating the harvest and thanking their God for blessing them with good food and crops. Kalash people take a procession to a high plateau outside the village in Balangkuru and pray to their God, after the prayers, the night-long dance and party begins, which lasts until the early hours of the next morning. The summer festival is celebrated in all the valleys for several days.\n\nKalash Winter festival – ( Kalash Choimus Festival)\n\nKalash Winter Festival is also called “Choimus” in the local language. This annually observed event symbolises and forecasts the prosperity of the village and the villagers for the new year. During the festival, People go out to seek foxes which are considered good omens. Torch-lit processions arrive from nearby villages at the main traditional dancing place called a “Charsue”. The dancing and festivities are held indoors and last into the night as the local wine is handed around the bonfire. The locals perform rituals for purification during the festival at the dawn of the new year. The tribal elders gather at hilltops to watch the rising sun of the new year, followed by goat sacrifices made to the Goddess, “Jastak”, and the blood is sprinkled at the temple Jastarkhan.\n\nWe believe that visiting Kalash Valley and experiencing the “Kalash festival” will create a lifelong memory which will stay with you for a long time.\n\nWatch our TWO videos about this Tour on our YouTube channel. Booth Videos are taken in July-August. The video was filmed by a participant in our Kalash Valley tour.

Accommodation at each of these hotels is twin-sharing with en-suite facilities. If you are travelling by yourself you will be paired with another single client of the same sex. It is possible to hire a single room for an additional cost. Additional hotel nights in Islamabad are also available. For hotel prices and single supplement costs please refer to the dates and prices page of the trip on our website. Hotels are subject to availability and prices may vary.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHTS\n\nCHITRAL FLIGHTS\n\nChitral is a weather-dependent airport. Since the valley is surrounded by high mountains, planes can only land here in good visibility and this means flights to and from Chitral are never guaranteed. The planes do fly more often than not, but cancellations can and do occur, and in these circumstances, we will travel by road.\n\nHEALTH & VACCINATION\n\nYou should contact your doctor or travel clinic to check whether you specifically require any vaccinations or other preventive measures. You should be up to date with routine courses and boosters as recommended in the UK e.g. diphtheria-tetanus-polio and measles-mumps-rubella), along with hepatitis A and typhoid. Malarial prophylaxis is discretionary for this trip. Malaria exists in the area around Islamabad. However, incidences of urban transmission of malaria are extremely low. A good online resource is Travel Health Pro. Dengue fever is a known risk in places visited. It is a tropical viral disease spread by daytime-biting mosquitoes. There is currently no vaccine or prophylaxis available and therefore the best form of prevention is to avoid being bitten. We recommend you take precautions to avoid mosquito bites\n\nINSURANCE\n\nWe highly recommend you have valid travel insurance for your trip with Trango Adventure Pakistan. We recognise the complexity and variety of choices in the insurance market and know that many of you either have your preferred insurer or have annual multi-trip cover in place already. If this is the case, please ensure that your insurer is aware of your Trango Adventure itinerary and can agree to cover the activities being undertaken.\n\nTrango Adventure does not provide any advice on travel insurance, although it is highly recommended that you have travel insurance which covers the activities which you are likely to be undertaking on your Pakistan holiday.\n\nTravel insurance providers.\n\nExpeditions or Treks\n\nHCC Medical Insurance Services LLC Tel: +1-800 605 2282\n\nTravelex Insurance Services Tel: +1-800 228 9792\n\nTrue Traveller Insurance Tel: 0333 999 3140 for treks including over 4500m\n\nAustrian Alpine Club (UK) Tel: +44 (0)1929 556870\n\nSnowcard Tel: +44 (0)1295 660836\n\nThe B.M.C.

During the tour, the group will be accompanied by a full supporting crew.\n\nALTITUDE\n\nKalash festival tour involves going to high altitude places. During your trip, you will be above 1,400 metres for 1-2 days. This is not something that you should not worry about; the human body is quite capable of adapting to a very wide range of altitudes, but we must follow some simple rules to acclimatise successfully. Before coming on this holiday, you should get some basic advice on Tours at high altitudes.\n\nCLIMATE\n\nFrom mid-June to August, we can expect to encounter temperatures as high as 40°C at Islamabad, Chitral and Gilgit, and 25°C in the Kalash Valley. Weather is generally good throughout the summer season, with clear skies and little rain or snow. However, weather in mountainous areas is difficult to predict, and short-lived storms can occur at any time.\n\nBOOKS\n\nTrekking in Pakistan. Isobel Shaw\n\nKarakoram Highway.
