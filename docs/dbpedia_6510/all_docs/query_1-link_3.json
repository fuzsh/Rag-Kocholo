        "text": "87 years ago in a small village outside yazd called Hossein Abad\n\n“Just to tell you a little story, the gentleman in the middle with white beard is my great grandfather who’s holding my mum in his arm.\n\nHis father had seven sons and they were Zoroastrian and one day he told his sons that he has seen a sign that Shah Barham has come and he asked them to investigate and they all did and became Baha’is,”\n\nI came across this on social media and I found it amusing in light of the discussion on the Kalash of Pakistan.\n\nFaith is a funny thing; while I mourn the passing of the Kalash into Islam, I find the conversion of the Zoroastrians into Bahais to be ennobling.\n\nThe Baha’i Faith in its quest for growth has decimated two exotic minorities, Iranian Jews & Zoroastrians (Jews not as much as the Zoroastrians; there would be anywhere from 10-30% more Zoroastrians in the world were it not for the Baha’i Faith).\n\nI’ve repeated this story on a blog but when I was young I asked a particularly fervent Zoroastrian Baha’i (most of them are as a rule) what would happen to their culture after they had all become Baha’i.\n\nThey absent-mindedly replied “we have Naw-Ruiz, we observe Haft-Seen (even though the practise of Haft-Seen has been modified by Islam) and we speak Persian so what?”\n\nAt the time something didn’t make sense to me but now so many years later; the idea that one shouldn’t have to lose their identity simply if they change their religion is now so much more appealing.\n\nI’m probably the first Baha’i to be advocating this but the Faith must expand its tend and adopt a “Hindu” rather than a Muslim approach to the observation of its tenets. Otherwise the wave of cultural destruction that would accompany the growth of the Faith will be incalculable.\n\nThough I imagine if the Kalash do see the light, they can swap the wine for the non-alcoholic version, I can assure them it tastes much better!"
