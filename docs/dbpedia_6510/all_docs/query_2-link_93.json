        "text": "There are three theories about the origin of the Kalash. Some historians believe the Kalash are descendants of the soldiers of Alexander the Great. Other historians say the Kalash are indigenous to Asia and come from what is now the Nuristan area of Afghanistan. Other historians say the Kalash ancestors migrated to Afghanistan from a distant place in South Asia, which the Kalash call “Tsiyam” in their folk songs and epics. However, it is established that the Kalash migrated to Chitral from Afghanistan in the 2nd century B.C. By the 10th century A.D., the Kalash ruled a large part of present-day Chitral. Razhawai, Cheo, Bala Sing and Nagar Chao were famous Kalash rulers in the 12th through 14th centuries A.D. Their fellow tribesmen in Afghanistan were known as Red Kafirs. The thriving Kalash culture began to fall in 1320 A.D. when Shah Nadir Raees subjugated and converted the people to Islam. The villages of Drosh, Sweer, Kalkatak, Beori, Ashurate, Shishi, Jinjirate and adjacent valleys in southern Chitral were last Kalash villages subjected to mass conversion in the 14th century. The Kalash were living in just three Chitral valleys, Bambourate, Rumbur and Birir, by the time Amir of Afghanistan forcefully converted to Islam the Red Kafirs on the other side of the border in 1893. Villages of the converted Red Kafirs in Chitral are known as Sheikhanandeh – the village of converted ones. The Kalash, as well as the Sheikh community, are popular with domestic and foreign tourists because of their unique culture. The Kalash area is a hub of eco- tourism activities. With the opening of the Lawari tunnel on the road to Peshawar and the proposed road to Tajikistan, the Kalash and Chitral will be linked with the cultural centers of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia by all-weather land routes.\n\nThe Kalash language is called Kalasha which is an archaic type of Indo- European language (Dardic subgroup). The language is called Kalasha and it has a rich tradition of folklore, epics, love songs and idioms demonstrating a high standard of indigenous wisdom and human experience. This knowledge is believed to be at the verge of extinction. The new generation of Kalash does not know much about their non-material culture and heritage.The Kalasha follow a Polytheist religion based on ancestor worship, as well as 12 gods and goddesses dominated by the main god, Mahandeo. Traditional female dress which includes a black robe, an embroidered long cap decorated with cowrie shells, ornaments and beads. This style of dress is still popular among local women despite the availability of a variety of modern clothes. The Kalash religion is based on myths and superstitions that relate to the relationship between the human soul and the universe. This relationship, according to Kalash mythology, needs its manifestation in music and dance, which also contribute to the pleasure of gods and goddesses. In their festivals music and dance are performed not as an entertainment item, but as a religious ritual. The Kalash celebrate four major festivals commemorating seasonal change and significant events in agro-pastoral life. These festivals are Joshi or Chilimjusht, Uchal, Phoo and Chowmos. The Kalash celebrate these festivals by offering sacrifices on altars, cooking traditional meals and dancing to traditional music during the week-long events. The Kalash seclude women during monthly periods and pregnancies by confining them to a place called Bashali. Each Kalash village has a Bashali outside the settlement. The women are allowed to work in the fields but are not allowed to go home or inside the village. They are considered untouchable and impure during their time in the Bashali. During the festivals they sacrifice animals at altars to please gods and goddesses. This religious ritual is performed with high regard for the supernatural beings, according to the Kalash mythology. The Betaan or Shaman plays an important role in the Kalash culture. He makes prophecies during religious rituals. The Betaan seeks the help of fairies to make prophecies with regard to the weather, crops, livestock and other agro-pastoral activities, including prospects for the coming year. An important practice in Kalash mythology is the close observation of the Kalash astronomers at the beginning of the new year in December. The Kalash believe that a new sun is born on Dec 21 and that the time and style of the new sun affects the flora and fauna of the land. Kalash houses and monuments show that the community has a rich background of skills in various arts and crafts, especially woodwork and woolen products. Effigies and paintings of human and animal figures in Kalash monuments are a testimony to their skill. The Kalash have unique funeral rituals. According to their beliefs, the departed soul was excited to leave the body and meet other souls after a long separation. The Kalash do not mourn their loved ones when they die. Instead, they celebrate the death by singing and dancing."
