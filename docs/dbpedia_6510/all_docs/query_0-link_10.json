In addition to Mariwan, Kalash shoe weaving is common in other cities of Kurdistan province, including Sanandaj, Divandarre, Sarvabad, Kamyaran, and Saqqez; but Mariwan is considered as the center of production of this shoe due to the high number of producers.\n\nThe presence of 4,355 artists active in the field of Kalash shoe production persuaded the experts of the World Handicrafts Council to register them by traveling to Mariwan city.\n\nKalash shoes are specific to Kordestan Province, which are made of natural fabrics.\n\nThey are used in Iran and are also exported to Iraq, especially the Kurdistan region of this country.\n\n207/216\n\nRead more:\n\nIranian Kurdish artist creativity shines in wood art"
