        "text": "The greener side of Goa.The travails of life. I get more pleasure from eating a well constructed sundae or a meal from a local cook who has a passion for satisfying the palate of customers than eating in a 5star Michelin rated chef restaurant with all their ambience and hype. Discovery of different sides of Goa. Snapping being snapped at culinary destruction.. It helps to have friends who have a taste for buying good villas across the globe and willing to let you enjoy\n\n3 decade flashback. Jim Morrison recollections that lasted 3 decades. Still remember besotted me hunting down your grave in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris in August 1994, After walking for 2 hours in the graveyard & nobody knowing where it was (inspite of me speaking fluent French then),it took wafting marijuana vapors to finally track you down. Crazy memories of the brilliant hour that I spent sharing walkmans & cassettes with the girl in the snap. Thanks for 'Riders on the storm' and 'Light my fire' - my all time favorites. Wonder if the lady is alive and if so, what's been the destiny of her life.\n\nConnecting the dots of life across 3 decades. On Aug 11 1994 , I left Paris soul uplifted post 9 days of walking through the city. I was returning home from New York post a 9 month sabbatical RA stint with Nobel laureate Harry Marcovitz, to chase my fantasies in private equity in India- with full contra-investor butterflies in stomach - all my peers were chasing expat and non Indian passport status. It was the first large European city I backpacked and have vivid 4K memories of my trip. Aug 11 2024, I again leave her soul uplifted post the Olympics. Post a lovely time with Pascale Ract She was a French exchange student to Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad in 1990 and was responsible in creating the passion in me to backpack to all cultures and people by sharing ways and values of her French life, which were little different than 20 year old me from a humble background. So thanks to her, Paris became a must do obsession. The best part is I think I remain the same person in term of human values - however have built many muscles outside the comfort zone to be able to overcome introvert cobwebs in my persona. No better way to end the trip than cheer leading the women marathoners.\n\nOne more bucket list ticked off . Seeing an Olympics medal ceremony. Lovely to see the Chinese and Taiwanese being civil and supporting the spirit of sports and humanity. Wish india and Pakistan learn from it. Hope one gets to see the Indian flag go up on 8th in javelin That will be crowning glory to decades of chasing sports events across the globe. One awesome fact was that the most vocal cheerleaders on both sides were women. A society gets successful when women take lead."
