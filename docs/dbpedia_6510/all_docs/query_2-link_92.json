        "text": "Dizane\n\nDizane is regarded as the Kalasha people's Mother Goddess. Her name is frequently spelled Disani and she is also known as Dezalik, which translates as \"sister of Dezau,\" the name for the creator deity. Dizane is the goddess of childbirth, the hearth, and the vital life energy. She is often worshipped to protect children, women, and crops. They also play a key role in various stories and rituals of the Kalasha people. Dizane was one of the main deities that people prayed to for assistance when the men of a tribe were out raiding and the women gathered in the villages to dance and praise the gods day and night.\n\n​\n\nJestak\n\nJestak is a goddess of marriage, family, and domesticity. She shares a common root with the goddess Dizane.\n\n​\n\nGoddess Riding on a Goat; Krumai\n\nSource: https://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/?p=684\n\nKrumai\n\nThe goddess Krumai, who is linked to the Tirich Mir mountain, assumes the form of a wild goat. She had a shrine at Badáwan where the Afghan Kalasha performed goat sacrifices in her honor in the past. According to one myth, Imra once pursued Krumai because she caused strife among the other deities. She was eventually thrown into a fast-moving river by Imra. But Krumai showed incredible mobility, leaping up the river and using her hooves to scale a rock. The cliff's characteristic shape was created during this ascent. When Krumai reached the top, she revealed her true self and arranged a lavish feast for the other gods. Her presents were accepted, and they graciously welcomed her into their pantheon of gods.\n\n​\n\nNirmali\n\nNirmali is a deity who protects pregnant women and their children.\n\n​\n\nSaranji\n\nSaranji is the tutelary god of the Pontzgrom village. She has a little shrine on top of the village tower, and another at the Pontzgul's entrance.\n\n​\n\nSeven daughters of Imrá\n\nImrá, the creator God, created seven daughters to watch over farms and agriculture. As the time for sowing, goats are sacrificed to them by people to seek their blessings.\n\n​\n\nVetr\n\nVetr are fairies who are worshiped by lighting a fire in the center of a growing crop, and placing juniper-cedar, ghee, and bread on it. The Charmo Vetr, a powerful fairy who dwells high up the Kutaringul stream, used to accept presents of goats and children from the Kam tribe in exchange for assistance against its foes.\n\n​"
