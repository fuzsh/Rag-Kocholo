        "text": "This article examines the comparison constructions in two Northern Talyshi varieties: in Anbarāni, used in the Islamic Republic of Iran; and the Northern Talyshi dialects spoken in the Republic of Azerbaijan. These constructions have been poorly studied in previous research dealing with this North-western Iranian language and this article aims to fill that gap. In contrast with a number of Western Iranian languages, Northern Talyshi (and the Talyshi language in general) does not have special morphological markers for expressing the degrees of comparison. The comparative grades are marked syntactically using various adpositions and function words. Having long been under the influence of neighbouring languages such as Persian and Azerbaijani, both Anbarāni and the Talyshi dialects spoken in the present-day Republic of Azerbaijan have been affected by these languages at some level in the ways to make comparison.\n\n1 In my transcription of Northern Talyshi here, I almost entirely follow the transliteration system used by Wolfgang Schulze in his work Northern Talysh (Schulze, W., Northern Talysh (Muenchen, 2000)Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the symbols a and ā differ in quality rather than in length and denote front and back open vowels, respectively. The NT ə is a mid-high central vowel that should not be confused with the front a in Azerbaijani (and NT texts written in the Latin Azerbaijani alphabet) denoted by the same symbol. The other letters used here have their usual values (č = ç, ğ = ğ, x = x, š = ş, ž = j). The only difference between the system employed here and Schulze's work is that I use j as the Latin Azerbaijani c [dʒ], whereas Schulze represents it as ǯ.\n\n13 The Anbarān region consists of two rural districts (dehestān): the dehestān of Anbarān, which includes the villages of Anbarān-e Olyā, Qeshlāq-e Pelāzir, and Qeshlāq-e Sarābād, and the dehestān of Minābād, consisting of the villages of Jeyd, Kalash, Mirzānaq, and Minābād. The Anbarān region has a town under the same name, which was created in 1998 by uniting the villages of Anbarān-e Soflā and Aminjān (see Bazin, ‘ANBARĀN’). It should be noted that under the term ‘Anbarāni’, the Northern Talyshi dialect spoken throughout the Anbarān region is considered; however, this dialect itself includes a number of subdialects, which have some slight differences in terms of both phonology and grammar. This article is mainly based on the dialect of the former village of Aminjān, but the subdialects of other villages in the region have also been studied.\n\n20 In AnbTal, the postpositions ku and sa are used with personal pronouns and can attach either to the oblique forms (for 1SG and 3SG, e.g. mānəsa ‘on me’, avəku ‘from him/her’) or to direct forms (amaku ‘from us’, avonsa ‘on them’). In AzTal, however, these postpositions do not attach to personal pronouns, but instead attach to possessive pronouns (e.g. čəməku ‘from me’, əštəsa ‘on you’, čavonku ‘from them’, čaysa ‘on him/her’, etc.).\n\n22 B. Miller suggests that the second singular and plural forms of possessive pronouns are also fused forms of čə and personal pronouns (əštə < čə + tə, šəma < čə + šəma). In the case of the second plural, the articulatory proximity of š and č has caused the latter to become inaudible (Miller, Talyšskij jazyk, p. 115).\n\n32 The postposition sa ‘on, on top of’ has a nominal origin; it derives from the noun sa ‘head’ (< OIr. *sarah-). In both AnbTal and AzTal, besides its role as a postposition, it is used as a noun.\n\n33 According to B. Miller, the postposition ku ‘from’ has a nominal origin from the noun ku ‘place’ (Miller, Talyšskij jazyk, p. 78). Daniel Paul states that in AzTal, ku ‘has word-level status as a nominal meaning “place,” in addition to its role as a postposition’ (Paul, ‘Comparative dialectal description’, p. 158), but I have never come across such a usage of this word nor do any of the main dictionaries of Northern Talyshi define ku as ‘place’ (F. Aboszoda, English-Talishi Dictionary (Muenchen, 2012); Pireyko, Talyšsko-russkij slovar’; F. Aboszoda, Russko-talyšskij slovar’ (Muenchen, 2012); B. Miller, Talyšskie teksty (Moscow, 1930)).\n\n34 The preposition čə goes back to OIr. *hačā- ‘from’ (> New Persian az) (V. Rastorgueva and D. Edelman, Ėtimologičeskij slovar’ iranskix jazykov (Moscow, 2007), p. 301). This preposition is frequently used in AzTal, whereas its usage in AnbTal is sporadic. In fact, it is not even mentioned in the works dedicated to Iranian Talyshi, including Anbarāni (Paul, ‘Comparative dialectal description’; R. Amiriān-Budālālu, Guyeš-e Tāleši-ye Anbarān-e Ardabil [Talyshi dialect of Anbarān of Ardabil] (Hashtpar, 2005).\n\n37 In Anbarāni, the Persian comparative suffix -tar is very rarely used as the index of the normal comparative construction, when the standard and the mark are present. In my text corpus, it is found only once in the following sentence:\n\n38 In the Persian language, when two items are being compared, the suffix -tar is affixed to an adjective in the predicate position, and the word az ‘from’ follows the item being compared and precedes the standard of comparison (see Shahrzad Mahootian, Persian (London/New York, 1997), p. 260). Examples (17), (18), and (19) translated into Persian would respectively be:\n\n39 The verb pie ‘to love’ and ‘to want’ holds a special place in the verbal system of Northern Talyshi, showing an ergative pattern throughout its paradigm (see H. Avchyan, ‘A short story of Mullah Nasreddin in the Anbarāni dialect of the Talyshi language: text, translation, glossary and comments’, Bulletin of the Institute of Oriental Studies, 1.2 (2021), pp. 220–21).\n\n40 In fact, this sentence is ambiguous. It can be translated either as ‘I love Maryam more than Žale (loves Maryam)’ or ‘I love Maryam more than (I love) Žale’. In some languages, such ambiguity arises because comparatives allow ellipsis of a repeated element, and it can be eliminated by restoring the missing elements, e.g. in English, the ambiguous sentence ‘I love you more than Ana’ can be paraphrased as ‘I love you more than Ana loves you’ or ‘I love you more than I love Ana’ (see Dixon, Basic Linguistic Theory, p. 368). In Northern Talyshi, paraphrasing this sentence is impossible, thus the meaning of the sentence has to be understood from the context.\n\n48 This sentence literally says ‘Tehran is a big[ger] city than all [cities] of Iran’. In this type of superlative construction, the words indicating a place can either be in the oblique case or marked by the postposition ada/anda ‘in’ (as in example (35)).\n\n52 Miller describes only one way to express the superlative in Northern Talyshi—the intensifier superlative discussed here further: ‘Only the descriptive method is used to express the superlative degree, the highest degree of any feature or quality – that is to put the adverbs ve “very” or xayli “a lot” before the adjective’ (Miller, Talyšskij jazyk, p. 73). He does not, however, provide any examples.\n\n53 Pireyko mentions two ways for expressing the superlatives; the first is the intensifier superlative as described by Miller and the second is the absolute comparison superlative with the pronoun hamma/hammay ‘all, everybody’ (Pireyko, ‘Talyšskij jazyk’, p. 131). Meanwhile, Schulze does not discuss the superlative (Schulze, Northern Talysh, p. 19).\n\n54 In the Persian language, when contrasting more than two different items, or the same item from more than two perspectives, the suffix -tarin is used. Superlative adjectives are attributive and precede the noun (Mahootian, Persian, pp. 260–61). Examples (44) and (45) translated into Persian would respectively be:"
