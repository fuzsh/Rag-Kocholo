        "text": "The Kalash people, also known as Kalasha or Kafir, are an ethnic group made up of about 3,000 people. They live in the Chitral Valleys, in the Hindu Kush mountain range in Pakistan. Most of the Kalash are spread across the Rumbur, Brumbret and Birir Valleys. The Kalash are goat herders and practice subsistence farming.\n\nLocation of the Kalash people in the territory of Pakistan.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the first passable highway was built in the Chitral valleys. This fact allowed the entry of education, the army and tourism; that have caused great socioeconomic changes in the area. The Kalasha, especially those who reside in the most isolated towns, have a strong sense of identity and fervently defend their culture and religion.\n\nKalash shepherd in front of the Hindu Kush mountain range.\n\nKalash people's origin\n\nAccording to legend, the Kalash have Caucasian features, fair complexions, and light eyes because they are descendants of Alexander the Great. Their physical appearance contrasts sharply with that of their Pashtun and Kho neighbors. Nowadays, the origin of the Kalash people remains unknown.\n\nColourful aesthetic\n\nThe Kalash people are noted for their unique culture, animistic rituals, and incredible clothing. Kalash women wear long black robes with colorful embroidery, headdresses and beaded necklaces. Some women still have small tattoos on their cheeks, forehead and chin. In addition, they usually leave their hair very long and collect it with long braids.\n\nWoman from the Kalash people with facial tattoos.\n\nDo you want to meet the Kalash people?\n\nDiscover the Kalash culture on our next trips to Pakistan:\n\n● Trip to Pakistan from 17 to 28 May 2024. See the trip to Pakistan in May 2024\n\n● Trip to Pakistan from 20 to 31 July 2024. See the trip to Pakistan in July 2024\n\nIn addition, we have another scheduled trip to Pakistan from 15 to 29 of November 2024, focused on visiting historical cities, archeology and tribal minorities. See the trip to Pakistan in November 2024.\n\nKalash elder in traditional clothing.\n\nInstead, Kalash men have adopted the 'shalwar kameez', the Pakistani national dress, which they combine with vests over it. They also wear traditional North Pakistani hats.\n\nIn contrast to some neighboring cultures, Kalash men and women live together and are allowed contact in public spaces. However, girls and women are sent to the 'bashaleni' during menstruation, until they \"recover their purity\". The 'bashaleni' is a community building where the women live during the period. They are also forced to give birth there.\n\nMeeting with a Kalasha woman carrying a handmade basket made from vegetable fibers during a trip to Pakistan.\n\nElopement (to run away secretly especially to get married without parental consent) is common in the Kalash Valley, mostly among women who are already married to another man. In these cases, the suitor must not only pay the dowry to the bride's family, but must also return to the husband the dowry that he paid before the wedding.\n\nKalash people's belief system\n\nThe traditional Kalash religion is animistic and polytheistic. It comes from an ancient branch of Hinduism, which was influenced by the beliefs of the neighboring areas of pre-Islamic Nuristan. The Kalash still keep different religious practices and rituals alive. Numerous Kalash gods have shrines and altars scattered throughout the valley, where goat sacrifices are regularly offered. The Kalash have a close relationship with the crows, whom they consider to be their ancestors. That is why they care for them and feed them attentively.\n\nDifferent festivals and traditional rituals of the Kalash people have fire as an element in common.\n\nDeath is perceived positively, since they believe that the soul of the deceased will separate from the body in order to reunite with those of his departed friends and relatives. That is why they leave the coffins in the open air, to facilitate the separation of body and soul. Traditional funerals are large parties in which music and dance abound.\n\nThe Kalasha villages feature beautiful vernacular architecture.\n\nVisit to the Kalash people during a trip to Pakistan."
