        "text": "Organic vegetables play a vital role in reducing exposure to harmful substances in food. This study aimed to assess consumer perceptions and willingness to pay (WTP) for organic vegetables, and identify factors influencing respondents' WTP for such vegetables in Savannakhet province, Lao PDR. A total of 368 respondents participated, with data collected using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, contingent valuation method, and logit models were employed for analysis. Results indicated that 60.30% of tested fresh vegetables were free from chemical contamination and toxins. High and moderate levels of chemical contamination were observed in only 6.25% and 25% of fresh vegetables, respectively. Approximately 35.29% of consumers reported regular weekly purchases of organic vegetables, with an average consumption of 3.78±2.45 kg/week, priced between 0.37 USD and 3.09 USD. Organic vegetables were favored for their perceived health benefits and quality, with 98.53% of consumers expressing future demand. The mean WTP for organic vegetables was found to be 1.14 USD per 1 kg. Bid premiums negatively impacted WTP for lettuce, morning glory, and mint products, while occupation exhibited a negative correlation with WTP for Chinese cabbage and onion.\n\nThe concern about vegetable safety, together with a booming population and the rise of the middle class has made Vietnam become a potential market for organic vegetables. This paper investigates the determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for organic vegetables in Hanoi, Vietnam with a particular attention to regional differences and the effect of risk perception. Using Contingent Valuation Method to analyze the data from a sample of 498 consumers in Hanoi, the paper shows that the perceived use values of organic vegetables, trust in organic labels, and disposable family income increased WTP for organic vegetables in both urban and rural regions. Though risk perception of conventional vegetables was high in both regions, such heightened risk perception just translated into the WTP in the rural region. In addition, the percentage of home-grown vegetables in the total vegetable consumption of the family influenced the WTP in the rural region only. Moreover, being an organic purchaser...\n\nConventional agriculture produces negative impacts on the environment and human health. To reduce such impacts, other forms of agriculture such as organic agriculture have emerged. One way to encourage this type of agriculture is to increase the consumption of organic products. This article presents the perception of consumers of organic and conventional vegetables. In addition, the estimated demand for organic and conventional lettuce in the city of Cali Colombia. The perception was obtained with an interview and focus groups of consumers of said products, and the demand through an econometric study carried out with information from two supermarkets in the city. The results revealed that the demand for organic vegetables is influenced by the little information that exists of this kind of products and also due to the high prices in the market. Consumers of organic vegetables express their preferences for these products based on considerations such as healthcare, sensitivity to the f...\n\nFor a few years, the consumers' concerns about environmental and health issues related to organic food products have risen; consequently, the demand for organically grown products has increased and hence the tendency of paying a surplus amount for those products. Keeping this point in view, a study was undertaken in 2020 to investigate the factors affecting consumers' potential willingness to pay premium prices for organic food products in Nepal. The research applied different research methods, in particular, public opinion analysis based on the conducted surveys and the statistical inference method. The data obtained from the survey were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test which revealed that men were more willing than women to select local organic foods due to their disbelief in conventional foods and their selection was more often than in case of women based on the price of the organic foods. This survey results showed 9.55 percent of respondents would not be willing to pay a premium price, while 91.45 percent would be willing to pay a certain percentage of surplus amounts for organic foods. Results have revealed that factors like personal disposable income, original product price, consumers' lifestyle, self-congruity, Ethics of production, etc. affect the consumer's attitude to paying a premium price. Moreover, health consciousness, environmental protection concerns, and food safety concerns increase the willingness of consumers to purchase organic foods. However, high prices, the paucity of regular supply, insufficient information about the benefits of organic foods, and others have negatively influenced the consumers regarding the purchasing perceptions. In this regard, the research findings can be used to assess the development prospects of the organic foods market, to construct a set of measures increasing the willingness level of the consumers to pay a price premium for local foods, and to take up decisions about the production of organic foods.\n\nPurpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors affecting consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) a premium for organics. Design/methodology/approach – A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data at five retail stores in metropolitan Bangkok. Exploratory factor analysis and the double-bound contingent valuation method were used for analysis. Findings – Results indicate WTP premiums of 88, 51 and 51 per cent for kale, jasmine rice and pork, respectively. Analysis indicates that respondents are willing to pay a premium if they have already purchased organic products, have good health, strong ethical and environmental concerns, think that organic products provide greater quality and health benefits, and reside in the city. Respondents with children, however, are less likely to pay a premium for organic products. Analysis also indicates that the price premium hinders purchase. Practical implications – Efforts should be made by policymakers, together with markete..."
