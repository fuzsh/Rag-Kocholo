        "text": "PESHAWAR: Nestled among the valleys of Pakistan’s mountainous northwest, a tiny religious community that claims descent from Alexander the Great’s army this week celebrated a four-day festival to mark the arrival of spring after eight months of harsh winter.\n\nThe Chilam Joshi fair, which concluded on Friday, attracted more than 500 foreign tourists to the picturesque Birir, Rambur and Bamburet valleys in Chitral to experience the unique non-Muslim culture of the Kalash people who worship a complex pantheon of gods and whose women eschew veils and men make wine.\n\n“Joshi is a religious spring festival in which girls wear traditional, heavily embroidered black cotton clothes of vibrant colors and colorful glass bead necklaces and dance with boys to the tune of traditional music,” Sayeda Gul, a Kalash woman, told Arab news via phone from Chitral.\n\nWinter usually arrives in the Kalash valleys before the end of September, after which heavy snow blocks access to the area for many months before people can finally begin to move in and out once more around May.\n\nWazir Zada, a member of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial assembly who hails from the valleys, told Arab News the Kalash people celebrated the Joshi festival to thank their gods for their bounties.\n\n“It begins on the thirteenth or fourteenth of May in Rambur and moves on to Bamburet before ending in Birir on the fourth day,” Zada said. “The biggest celebrations take place in Bamburet, the largest of the three valleys.”\n\nAnother Kalash resident, Abdul Khaliq, said animals and goats were held sacred status in Kalash culture, and the people also used the festival to pray for the safety of their animals and pastures.\n\n“Goat milk is spread on the gods to get their blessings during Joshi,” Khaliq said. “People distribute goat cheese, milk, and other dairy products among each other and guests before taking their animals to pastures in the higher lands.”\n\nUnmarried Kalash boys and girls also use the festival as an opportunity to meet and pick spouses Khaliq said: “Every year, two or three dozen people announce the names of their life partners on the last day of the festival in the presence of the whole community.”\n\nThe Kalash, who number just about 3,500 in Pakistan’s population of 208 million, have for centuries practiced polytheism and animal sacrifice without interference from members of Pakistan’s Muslim majority.\n\nBut in the last decade or so, the community has been under increasing danger from proselytizing Muslim militants from other parts of Pakistan and just across the border in Afghanistan.\n\n“Conversion to Islam by mostly girls and migration of Kalash people are the two reasons for a recent reduction in the numbers of the Kalash population,” said Syed Harir Shah, a local tour operator. “The government of Pakistan and the UN are making efforts to preserve the culture and minimize this diminishing trend.”\n\nThreats from militants in recent years have also led to a decline in tourism in Chitral, but the security situation has returned to normal in recent years due to military operations in various militant hotbeds in the northwestern regions.\n\n“Foreign tourists were not allowed to move without armed escorts in previous years,” Shah said. “This year, they were allowed free movement and the opportunity to communicate with the locals.”\n\nHowever, he said unprecedented monsoon floods that drenched the Hindu Kush mountain valleys in 2015 had destroyed infrastructure, which had not been rebuilt.\n\nTalking to Arab News, Junaid Khan, the Director General of the Tourism Corporation Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (TCKP), said his department had helped arrange and manage the traditional Joshi festival, assisting the Kalash community in organizing events and managing waste.\n\n“We also ensured smooth traveling and accommodation in the valleys by mobilizing several government departments,” Khan said, adding that the department had ensured that roads and tunnels leading to the valleys remained open and accessible throughout the festival. TCKP also ensured smooth traffic movement to and from Kalash, provided parking bays for the tourists and set up a small camping tent village for tourists, the director general said.\n\nIn the future, Khan said, the provincial government had set aside Rs1 billion for the construction of roads in Chitral, including the road to Ayun valley, the gateway to the Kalash valleys. The federal government has also reserved Rs2 billion rupees for the construction of 44 kilometers of roads in Chitral in the coming fiscal year, he said.\n\nQUETTA: Police in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province have identified five bullet-riddled bodies found hanging from electricity poles on Friday in the remote settlement of Dalbandin, saying they belonged to Afghan nationals.\n\nThe incident jolted residents of the area, located about 340 kilometers from the provincial capital, Quetta, after they spotted the bodies bound to electricity pylons in the middle of the town, which shares borders with Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nHussain Lehri, Senior Superintendent of Police in Dalbandin, said the authorities moved the bodies, found near a government-run college, to the District Headquarters Hospital for autopsy as soon as they were informed.\n\n“During the medico-legal procedure, the bodies were identified, and it emerged that the deceased were residents of Afghanistan’s Lashkar Gah city,” he told Arab News over the phone.\n\n“The bodies have been taken to Quetta, where they will be kept in a morgue until the family members arrive to claim them.”\n\nPakistan shares a 2,600-kilometer border with Afghanistan and a 905-kilometer border with Iran. Dalbandin is situated close to the Afghan province of Helmand and is a frequent border crossing for people illegally entering Pakistan.\n\nBalochistan, arguably the most underdeveloped region of Pakistan, has been the scene of a low-level insurgency by Baloch separatist groups who accuse Islamabad of exploiting its natural resources like copper and gold. The Pakistani state denies the charge, saying it has been undertaking development projects to benefit the residents of the province.\n\nLehri said the five Afghans were killed by unknown assailants outside Dalbandin before their bodies were tied to the poles in the city.\n\n“A video appeared about 20 days ago, in which they were seen in the captivity of the banned Islamist group Jaish-ul-Adl,” he continued. “But we are investigating this further.”\n\nJaish-ul-Adl is a militant group based in southeastern Iran, primarily operating in the Sistan and Balochistan province. The group emerged in 2012 as a successor to Jundallah, a previously active insurgent organization.\n\nJaish-ul-Adl is primarily known for its violent attacks against Iranian security forces and government officials, with Tehran accusing Pakistan of harboring them, though Pakistani authorities have always denied the allegation.\n\nNo group has so far claimed responsibility for the killings of the Afghan nationals.\n\nISLAMABAD: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said on Friday its media manager, Ahmed Waqas Janjua, had returned home following 25 days of incarceration on terrorism and cybercrime charges.\n\nLast month, the PTI announced Janjua’s “abduction” from his residence at night, saying a group of armed men forcefully took him away and seized his laptop, mobile phone and other electronic devices. Janjua was subsequently brought before an anti-terrorism court where the investigation officer said police had recovered explosive material from him during his arrest.\n\nJanjua also faced charges under the country’s cybercrime law and reportedly said during the investigation that the PTI social media team was building an “anti-state narrative” with the help of internal and external forces.\n\nHis party, however, called it a “fake confession,” asserting it was unclear how the statement was extracted and pointing out it would not be admissible in a court of law.\n\n“Ahmed Janjua is back,” the PTI said in a social media post. “PTI’s central media department member & international media coordinator @AhmedWJanjua was abducted & disappeared.”\n\n“After court intervened, he was presented in court & falsely charged with a case of terrorism,” it added. “The court granted bail, but authorities refused to release him. Finally, after remaining illegally incarcerated for 25 days, Ahmed Janjua returns home.”\n\nThe PTI says the government has been making legal cases against its leaders and members as part of a state-backed crackdown, which includes bans on holding rallies and arrests of party leaders and supporters.\n\nHowever, the government denies persecuting opposition parties.\n\nPTI founding leader and ex-PM Khan himself has been in jail for over a year, though all four convictions handed down to him ahead of a parliamentary election in February have either been suspended or overturned but he remains in jail on new charges.\n\nKhan says all legal cases against him are motivated to keep him out of politics and dent the popularity of the PTI.\n\nMULTAN, Pakistan: Most of the suspects in a rampage last year against minority Christians in eastern Pakistan over alleged blasphemy are not in custody and authorities have failed to deliver justice to the victims, a human rights group said Friday.\n\n“More than 90 percent of the suspects of the attack in Jaranwala, in Punjab’s Faisalabad district, are still at large,” Amnesty International said in a statement on the anniversary of one of Pakistan’s worst attacks on Christians, in which churches and homes of Christians were destroyed.\n\nThe violence erupted after Muslims alleged that they saw a local Christian and his friend desecrating pages from a Holy Qur’an. The attack drew nationwide condemnation. No one died, as terrified Christians quickly fled to safer places.\n\nAmnesty International said it obtained its information from police after filing a Right to Information Request. It said of the 5,213 accused, 380 were arrested and 4,833 were still at large. It said of those who were arrested, 228 were released on bail and 77 others had the charges against them dropped.\n\nIt said trials of the suspects have not started and about 40 percent of victims who lost property are still awaiting government compensation.\n\nAbid Khan, the regional police chief, said investigators have referred the cases of suspects linked to the violence to an anti-terrorism court, and their trial was expected to start soon.\n\n“Despite the authorities’ assurances of accountability, the grossly inadequate action has allowed a climate of impunity for the perpetrators of the Jaranwala violence,” Babu Ram Pant, Amnesty International’s deputy regional director for South Asia, said in the statement.\n\nBlasphemy accusations are common in Pakistan. Under its laws, anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or Islamic religious figures can be sentenced to death. While authorities have yet to carry out any death sentences for blasphemy, often just the accusation can spark riots and incite mobs to violence, lynching and killings.\n\nYaqoob Yousaf, a priest in Jaranwala, told The Associated Press on Friday that most of the suspects in the attacks had been freed. He said attacks on Christians on false accusations are continuing and that Christians are “still living in a state of fear” in various parts of the country."
