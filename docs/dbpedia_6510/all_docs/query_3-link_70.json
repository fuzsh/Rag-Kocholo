There are several buses and taxis available from Chitral to Kalash Valley, which is approximately a 1-2 hour drive.or By Road From Islamabad to Via Swat we will reach in hunza 9 to 12 Hours\n\nPeople Of Chitral Kalash Valley:\n\nThe people of Kalash are considered unique among the people of Pakistan. The Kalasha or Kalash, also called Waigali or Wai, are a Dardic Indo-Aryan indigenous people residing in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. They speak the Kalasha language, from the Dardic family of the Indo-Aryan branch. They are considered unique among the people of Pakistan. They are also considered to be Pakistan’s smallest ethno religious, practicing a religion which some authors characterize as a form of animism, while academics classify it as “a form of ancient Hinduism”. The Kalash are considered to be an indigenous people of Asia, with their ancestors migrating to Chitral valley from another location possibly further south, which the Kalash call “Tsiyam” in their folk songs and epics.\n\nLanguages of the Chitral Valley:\n\nLanguage of Kalash people: The Kalasha language, also known as Kalasha-mun, is a member of the Dardic group of the Indo-Aryan languages. Its closest relative is the neighboring Khowar language. Kalasha was formerly spoken over a larger area in south Chitral, but it is now mostly confined to the western side valleys having lost ground to Khowa. However, Urdu and English are also widely understood and spoken.\n\nHistory of the Chitral Valley:\n\nThe grandest of all is that the Kalashas carry a romantic view of being the descendants of Alexander the Great. On the other hand, many historians believe that they are indigenous tribe of the neighboring area of Nuristan, also called Kafiristan (the land of Kafirs). It is believed that in 1895, Amir Abdul Rahman, the king of Afghanistan, conquered the area of Nuristan and forced the inhabitants of the area to convert to Islam. It was during that time that many people fled to Chitral to avoid conversion. The third theory claims that the ancestors of Kalashas migrated from a distant place in South Asia called Tsiam. The Tsiam is considered to be the traditional home of these people. The Kalasha folk songs and fables hint at the existence of Tsiam and that their roots belong in that region.\n\nWeather in Chitral Valley:\n\nThe weather in Chitral Valley is generally mild and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 20-25°C during the day and 5-10°C at night.
