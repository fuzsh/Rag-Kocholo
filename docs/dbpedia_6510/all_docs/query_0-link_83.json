        "text": "HRANA, the news agency of Human Rights Activists – Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old young woman, was arrested by the morality police for the crime of improper hijab. Her arrest and death in detention fueled nationwide protests in Iran. Protesters came to the streets with the central slogan “Women, Life, Freedom” in protest against the performance, laws and structure of the regime. The following 209-page report is dedicated to the statistical review, analysis, and summary of the first twenty days of the ongoing protests (September 17 to October 5, 2022). In this report, in addition to the geographic analysis and the presentation of maps and charts, the identity of 200 deceased, including 18 children and teenagers, an estimated of 5,500 arrested along with the identity of 563 arrested citizens, 123 students and 36 journalists or activists in the field of information is compiled. In addition the report includes a complete collection of 698 verified video reports by date and topic. The report examines protests across 342 documented gatherings in all 31 provinces of the country, including 105 cities and 68 universities.\n\nSummary\n\nMahsa (Zhina) Amini, a 22-year-old young woman from Saqqez, Kurdistan who had traveled to Tehran on Tuesday, September 13, 2022, was taken into custody by several Moral Security Police officers at the Haqqani metro station in Tehran charged with not observing the strict Islamic dress code and was taken to the detention center of this organization known as Vozara.\n\nShortly after her arrest, her partially alive body was transferred to the intensive care unit of Kasra Hospital, she was admitted in a coma with level three consciousness.\n\nGiven the atrocious track record of the police force in mistreating the accused and previous incidents that were similar to this, public opinion reacted acutely to this situation because there was the widespread perception that this young girl was beaten in the Vozara detention center.\n\nThe widespread street protests against this incident were set off from the time Mahsa Amini was announced, in front of Kasra Hospital on Argentina Street in Tehran, and then quickly spread to the streets despite the intimidating presence of Iran’s security apparatus. The protests after Mahsa’s burial in a Saqqez cemetery, intensified whereby after twenty days of nationwide protests, they spread all of Iran’s 31 provinces, 105 cities, and 69 major universities.\n\nThe protests were not limited to Ms. Amini’s death and quickly targeted the Iranian government’s political and ideological foundations. These protests were violently quashed by the anti-riot police and Iran’s militia force (baseej) through the use of teargas, pellets, and live ammunition. This widespread crackdown has led to the death of dozens of people and the wounding of hundreds of protestors.\n\nDespite the severe communication restrictions imposed by the Iranian government, the following report summarizes the twenty days of protests between September 17, to October 5, 2022. The protests that at the time of this report are still going on in various forms. They are not necessarily in the form of street protests, but they manifest themselves in a variety of individual and collective actions.\n\nUnique Features of These Protests\n\nThese protests reviewed in this report have unique characteristics that differentiate them from the protests of the last decade in Iran and are at times unprecedented in the life of the Islamic Republic.\n\n• Contrary to most of the protests in recent years, this recent protest was not based on economic or environmental grievances. Instead, political, and human rights demands were at the center of it.\n\n• These protests were triggered by the death of a young, Kurdish and Sunni woman. Being female, Kurdish and of Sunni faith are all grounds for discrimination in Iran for her being a woman, being a Kurd, and being a Sunni was attributed to oppressed groups and subjected to gender, ethnic, and religious discrimination. Yet, the Iranian public showed a united front and disregarded all these categories that tend to divide people and instead displayed that collectively they can take a positive step forward.\n\n• The Iranian youth, whose average age has now reached 15 years of age, according to law enforcement officials, has played a key role in these protests.\n\n• An unprecedented solidarity has been formed between Iranians inside Iran and those in the diaspora.\n\n• These protests put almost all classes of Iranian society into one unified group of people in support of the protesters. The urban middle class alongside the lower or upper classes in small and large urban areas, different ethnic groups, religious minorities, sexual minorities, and trade groups including teachers, laborers, students, professors, artists, and athletes were integral to this united front. In these protests, we witnessed different businesses showing solidarity with the protesters by going on strikes.\n\n• In terms of continuity, these protests can be considered among the longest continuous protests since the inception of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n• Because of the substantive and progressive demands of these protesters, the international community, especially celebrities in the fields of the arts, culture, and politics, became the voice of the Iranian people in an unprecedented way, and by disseminating information and taking various actions, they have attention to what is going on in Iran.\n\n• The demands of the protesters, which centered on the issue of women’s rights, have indicated that Iran has a progressive and assertive society.\n\n• One of the distinguishing features of these protests from the previous ones was unarmed protesters routinely confronting the security forces. There have been many scenes of protestors showing solidarity as they came together to prevent people from being taken into custody or by standing in front of the police who were equipped with full anti-riot gear. Public anger over the operation of the Moral Security Police and decades of meddling by this force in the most personal areas of women’s lives was also a great motivating factor for the protestors to resist being subjugated by Iran’s security apparatus.\n\n• In addition to the street protests, there was cyber warfare going on between the opponents and supporters of the status quo. Numerous government sites were hacked, and the global solidarity propelled Mahsa Amini’s hashtag, which became the first in the history of Twitter to record more than 300 million tweets.\n\n• The government of Iran this time around gave more latitude to Faraja (Iran’s main law enforcement agency) and their rank and file to spearhead the repression of the street protests. The government also adopted alternative methods regarding the Internet (e.g., reducing its speed rather than cutting it off as we as filtering certain sites). Also, after the death of an army officer, it became clear that the Iranian army also played a role in suppressing protests, which is considered a rare event.\n\n• The media close to Iran’s security apparatus tried to cover the protests in their own way by sending their reporters to the streets to present the news in a slanted way that is favorable to the government. These reporters continuously have provided the latest from street clashes between the protesters and security forces.\n\n• These protests, which have lacked leadership and command-and-control, have shown that Iranian society, especially its younger generation, is determined to attain their basic human rights.\n\nThe Protests\n\nAt the time when Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi spoke about human rights in his annual speech at the UN General Assembly, Iranian protesters took to the streets to speak out against police brutality and discriminatory religious laws against women in Iranian society.\n\nOn September 17, the first sparks of these protests took place in Tehran, Sanandaj and Saqqez. Then the protests quickly reached other cities and different social groups and classes.\n\nThirty-one provinces, in other words, Iran’s all provinces, were the scenes of protests from September 17 to October 5, 2022.\n\nIn the 20 days of protests that are reviewed in this report, a total of 105 cities from Iran’s all 31 provinces became the scene of protests up to 266 times. If there were instances when the protesters could not find their way to the street, that was due to tight security measures in the area.\n\nIn addition to 226 instances of street protests, there were 76 protests on 69 university campuses.\n\nThe cities where protesters appeared in the streets during a week of protest have been verified by HRANA as follows:\n\nProtesters’ Slogans\n\nVarious slogans were chanted in the gatherings. The ones that were repeated most are listed below:\n\n• We are all Mahsa, if you fight, we will fight back\n\n• Cannons, Tanks, Fireworks, the Mullah Should Get Lost\n\n• We don’t want the Islamic Republic, we do not.\n\n• Death to the rule of the Islamic Jurist\n\n• Get lost Baseeji (Islamic militia), get lost Baseeji\n\n• Liberty, liberty, liberty\n\n• Death to Khamenei\n\n• Justice, liberty, optional clothing\n\n• Death to Morality Police and its Patrol\n\n• Our stupid leader is our disgrace\n\n• Death to the Islamic Republic\n\n• Saqqez is not alone, Sanandej has your back.\n\n• Killing women for bad hijab, how long such humiliation?\n\n• Be scared, we are all united\n\n• We will fight, we will die, we will get Iran back\n\n• Women, life, liberty\n\n• From Yazd to Kurdistan, we give our lives for Iran\n\n• Jailed students should be released\n\n• Sharif University students are honorable, the Baseejis are humiliated\n\n• No to headscarves, no to beating women\n\n• Liberty, equality, Justice\n\n• Liberty, optional clothing\n\n• From Kurdistan to Tabriz, it’s all poverty, corruption, and discrimination\n\n• This is not just a protest, it’s the start of a revolution\n\n• We do not want universities under siege, we do not\n\n• If we do get united, they will kill us one by one\n\n• Evin prison has turned into a university, Tehran has become a detention center\n\n• Justice, liberty, optional clothing\n\n• They have killed Sharif students, but they say they didn’t kill Mahsa\n\n• Students would rather die than get humiliated\n\n• Students are in jail; our professors stay silent\n\n• Honorable students, support us, support us\n\n• We will fight, we will die; we will get Iran back\n\n• You killed our students, now ask us to stay silent\n\n• Azerbaijan is awake, it supports Kurdistan\n\n• Liberty is our right, Zhina (Mahsa) is our code word\n\n• Poverty, corruption and injustice; shame on this despotism\n\n• Servitude, unemployment, forced hijab on women\n\nConclusion\n\nThree weeks after Mehsa (Zhina) Amini’s death, Iran’s Medical Forensic Organization, published its pathology tests showing her “death was not caused by blows to the head or any vital organs and parts of the body.”\n\nIn the statement of the coroner’s office, it is stated: “Based on hospital medical documents, the investigation of C. T-scan of the brain and lungs, the results of the physical examination of the body and autopsy, pathology tests, Mahsa’s death was not caused by strikes to the head and the vital organs and other parts of the body.”\n\nThe Iranian coroner’s office added that due to the “underlying illness” of Mahsa Amini, “she did not have the necessary ability to compensate and adapt to the situation, therefore, under the circumstance, she suffered from a heart rhythm disorder and a drop in blood pressure, and subsequently, a decrease in the level of consciousness, which due to the ineffective cardio-respiratory resuscitation in the first critical minutes, she suffered severe hypoxia resulting in brain damage.”\n\nIn its statement, this government body claimed that “despite the return of cardiac function following the resuscitation of the emergency personnel, the respiratory support did not work” and despite being transferred to the hospital “she passes away on September 16 due to multi-organ failure (M.O.F) caused by cerebral hypoxia.”\n\nIn response to this statement, Saleh Nikbakht, the lawyer for the Amini family, told the media that the medical examiner’s claim that Mahsa Amini’s death was caused by a glandular surgery that was performed on her when she was eight is baseless because the same surgeon who performed the surgery has said it cannot be the cause of her death. Other neurologists have refuted this too.\n\nMr. Nikbakht also called Mahsa Amini’s “instant death” and the attempt to link it with “her childhood surgery or taking thyroid pills” nonsense and said how is it possible that Mahsa Amini, who “has not had any physical issues for 15 years, after being taken into custody by the Morality Police and spending an hour and a half at their headquarters, suddenly has a stroke, heart, and kidney failure and loses ninety-eight percent of her vital signs.”\n\nAccording to the lawyer of the Amini family, Mahsa Amini’s case “is in the investigation stage and has not yet been filed with the court.”\n\nThese protests, besides the cost in blood they had for the protesters, have cost the human rights violators dearly as well.\n\nThere have been spontaneous collective actions by the protesters to identify human rights violators and agents of repression. There have been orchestrated attempts such as the Spreading Justice as well, which aims at identifying human rights violators using digital tools and by following up on the information received. Spreading Justice uses the information they receive to incur costs for human rights violators.\n\nA number of Western countries have approved new human rights sanctions against Iran.\n\nIn the latest action, the US Treasury Department sanctioned seven officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran for cutting off the Internet and suppressing protesters during protest rallies.\n\nAhmad Vahidi, Minister of the Interior, Issa Zarepour, Minister of Communications, Hossein Sajdinia, Deputy of Faraja (law enforcement) Operations, Yadullah Javani, Political Deputy of the Revolutionary Guards, Vahid Majid, Chief of Fata (a force that fights cyber-crimes) Police, Hossein Nejat, Commander of Tharullah Camp, and Hossein Rahimi, Chief of Tehran Police, are listed as human rights violators. Sanctions have been imposed.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department had previously slapped sanctions on Iran’s Moral Security Police and a number of human rights violators such as Seyed Ismaeel Khatib, the Minister of Information, Manouchehr Amanollahi, the police commander of Kermanshah province, Salar Abnoush, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards, Kyomars Heydari, the commander of the ground forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Haj Ahmed Mirzaei, the former head of Tehran’s Moral Security Police, Mohammad Rostami Cheshme Gachi, the police chief of Minab city, and Qasem Rezaei.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canada also announced sanctions against the Moral Security Police, the Cyber Defense Command of the Revolutionary Guards, Evin Prison, and a number of Iranian figures known for taking part in widespread human rights violations, namely Mohammad Hassan Bagheri, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic, Hossein Salami, Commander The General of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Ismail Qaani, Commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Mohammad Saleh Hashemi Golpaigani, the Secretary of the Commanding Good and Prohibiting Evil, Ismail Khatib, the Minister of Information, Mohammad Rostami, the Chief of the Moral Security Police.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canada also called the Moral Security Police, the Cyber Defense Command of the Revolutionary Guards, Evin Prison and a number of Iranian figures known for participating in widespread human rights violations, namely Mohammad Hassan Bagheri, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic, Hossein Salami, Commander The General of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Ismail Qaani, Commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Mohammad Saleh Hashemi Golpaigani, the Secretary of the Command for Good and Prohibition of Evil, Ismail Khatib, the Minister of Information, Mohammad Rostami, the Chief of the Moral Security Police, sanctioned.\n\nAlso, in the first days of the protests, six member states of the European Union, including Germany, France, Denmark, Spain, Italy, and the Czech Republic, proposed new sanctions against the Islamic Republic. The proposed sanctions will cover 16 individuals, organizations, and institutions in Iran that have played key roles in suppressing the protesters.\n\nMaps of protests\n\nFor a better understanding of the extent of the protests of Sep-Oct 2022, look at its distribution map in the last twenty days.\n\nFollow the most concentrated protest points on the map below\n\nIn the map below, see the points that witnessed protests, regardless of the number of repetitions\n\nIn the chart below, see the number of urban protests without considering student protests or strikes\n\nDisruption in Internet Access\n\nDisruption in the Internet and mobile communication networks was detected from the first days of the recent protests.\n\nFrom September 20, 2022, Internet disruptions reached its peak, especially in Kurdistan and other protest hotbeds.\n\nThe cities of Saqqez, Sanandaj, Tehran, Mahabad, Ahvaz, Baneh, Bukan, Kermanshah, Qazvin, Arak, Mashhad, Marivan, Paveh, Bijar, Qorveh, Kamiyaran, Dehgolan, Sarovabad, Diwandara, Urmia, Rasht, Shahinshahr, Karaj, Piranshahr, Sardasht, Shiraz, Chabahar, Shahin Dej, Takab, Rabat, Ashnavieh, Langrood and Amlesh experienced the most cases of Internet disruptions until September 30, 2022.\n\nThere are several reports that indicate that in a number of cities in the country, the speed of the Internet diminished from 12 noon to 4p.m., and then from 4p.m. to 12 midnight, the reduction in the speed of home Internet doubled. And mobile Internet was also completely cut off in that period.\n\nIn addition, the review of Internet Outage Detection (IODA) data, which reviews Internet traffic around the world, indicates that the 10 provinces that face the most interruptions and disruptions of the internet are: Hormozgan, Fars, Isfahan, Ilam, Qom, Semnan, Tehran, Qazvin, Mazandaran, and Golestan.\n\nFrom September 29, when the communication disruption took a nationwide form, platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Skype, App Store, Google Play, Clash of Clans, LinkedIn, and Viber were filtered.\n\nIn the wake of Internet disruptions, the amount of Internet usage in Iran diminished by 67 percent and also mobile communication networks, including First Mobile, Irancell, and Rightel, suffered constant disruptions.\n\nAlso, the Axios News site reported a 3,000 percent increase in the demand for and download of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) in the country.\n\nIn the first days of the nationwide protests, Elon Musk, the owner of Starlink, promised satellite Internet for all Iranians. After his comment, the site of Mr. Musk’s company was filtered in Iran.\n\nAlso, the text messages containing Mahsa Amini’s name were filtered and blocked by the Hamrahe Aval Telecommunication Network.\n\nDuring this period, various human rights groups issued statements and expressed their concern about the Internet shutdown in Iran and its repercussions.\n\nOn Monday, September 24, the Tejarat News Web site reported in a news story that after reviewing the economic consequences of the internet outage in Iran it concluded that the livelihoods of about 10 million Iranians are in jeopardy just because of the lack of access to Instagram. However, Issa Zarepour, the Minister of Communications and Information Technology announced the establishment of new filters indefinitely.\n\nAccording to many experts, many online businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy, and eight hours of daily Internet outage has caused a lot of financial hardship to Iranian economy.\n\nHamshahri newspaper reported in a news story that nine million Iranian citizens who have chosen Instagram as their preferred method to do business have faced serious challenges after the regime began filtering Instagram.\n\nActivists in the field of information\n\nJournalists and other members of the media were a group that were arrested by the security institutions for the purpose of preventing the flow of information. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published the following list of individuals who have contributed to the flow of information as official/unofficial journalists or bloggers:\n\n1.

According to news reports, these injuries are caused by beatings with batons, electric shocks, or because of the use of weapons such as pepper spray, tear gas, pellets, or plastic bullets, and in some cases, weapons of war, especially handguns.\n\nAccording to news reports, military forces have used ambulances and city buses to move their forces around in urban areas. Protesters’ defensive actions, as a result, have caused damage to around 60 ambulances in the country. In addition, law enforcement agencies have also used city schools as bases to store their gear and equipment in preparation to confront the protesters. Consequently, these places have sustained damage to their structure during clashes. The mayor of Tehran has also claimed that 43 city buses, 54 bus stations, and 25 fire engines have sustained damage in the city.\n\nMany pictures and videos published on social networks, as well as news reports that have been shared with HRANA, indicate the frequent use of handguns by law enforcement to quell the protests.\n\nA major part of the anti-riot police deployed during the protests is coming from the ranks of the Islamic Republic Police Command (Faraja), of which the special unit (Yegan Vijeh) is the main component.\n\nThe Basij force, along with the police, was one of the main bodies to suppress the protesters during the unrest in this period, and it seems that the most casualties sustained by government law enforcement were also from this group.\n\nThe unregulated use of shotguns with pellets by law enforcement has resulted in the injury of many protesters.\n\nThese forces have tried to use firearms against elderly people, protesting teenagers or even children present during the protests. In some cases, firearms have resulted in serious injury to the eyes of these protesters. Some have lost complete eyesight.\n\nIn addition, according to the reports received by HRANA, during the last few days, hundreds of arrested protestors have been transferred to Qarchak, Varamin, Tehran, Vakil Abad, Ilam, Evin and other prisons in the country.\n\nMedia outlets that are close to the government have claimed, however, that many of the personnel in the Baseej and law enforcement have been injured in the protests. This claim is not, however, consistent with the available evidence. The heavy hand of the forces deployed against the protesters makes this less plausible.\n\nIran’s official media claimed the Iranian economy suffered damages to the tune of 800 or 100 billion tomans (the Iranian currency) due to the recent protests and strikes. Officials have claimed 460 bank branches and ATMs, and 61 ambulances were damaged. That bank shareholders have also lost tens of billions of tomans. In addition, the four-day closure of shops in 80 cities in the country, the destruction of 70 bus stations, 100 buses, 30 fire engines, and 15 police cars have all been damaging to public services.\n\nAs usual, the Iran security apparatus tried to deny responsibility for the violence and damage to property and places and pin the blame on the protesters by publishing reports including coerced confessions from the detainees. However, pictures of security forces destroying houses and the personal property of citizens have been published on social networks.\n\nThe Fatalities in the Protests\n\nHRANA has divided the information about the fatalities in the 20-day protests into three categories.\n\nThe first group is 200 people whose identities have been received by the HRANA News Agency. Verification of this batch is in progress. So far, the verification of the death of 31 people from this list has been directly verified and confirmed by HRANA, and other information is being investigated at the time of publication of this report.\n\nAmong the identities under investigation, 7% are women, and also among the 43 identities whose exact or relative age has been determined, 29% are people who were less than 18 years old.\n\nChild victims\n\nFollowing are the names of some of the victims of younger than 18 years old: Zakaria Khial (16 years old), Amin Maroufi (16 years old), Amirali Fouladi (16 years old), Parsa Rezadoost (17 years old), Siavash Mahmoudi (16 years old), Nika Shakarami (17 years old), Sarina Esmailzadeh (16 years old), Samer Hashemzehi (16 years old), Amirhossein Basati (15 years old), Mohammad Reza Sarvari (14 years old), Ali Mozaffari Salanghouch (17 years old), Sedis Keshani (14 years old), Javad Pousheh (12 years old), Jaber Shirouzi (12 years old), Amir Mahdi Farkhipour (17 years old), Ehsan Alibazi (16 years old), Omid Safarzahi (17 years old), Nima Shafaqdoost (16 years old),\n\nThe second category is remarks or reports made by government officials or government institutions and human rights groups. This category only relies on figures but without mentioning any details and identities. In this category, in two reports from the Fars news agency, as well as a statements from the Friday Prayer Imam of the Sunni community in Zahedan, there are 100 fatalities as the minimum number from reliable statistics.\n\nThe third category is the security forces or plainclothes agents who have been killed during the protests, and their deaths have been confirmed and announced by the media close to the security apparatus.\n\nThe geography of those killed\n\nBefore checking the list of identities of the possible deaths, take a look at the map below to better understand the geographical
