        "text": "Kurdistan is a cold land with warm-hearted people whose hospitality is well-known. The literal meaning of Kurdistan, which was first officially used during the Seljuk period, is the land of the Kurds.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of the land of Kurdistan dates back to the Medes. In 1337, this province was formed in the way we know it today - with the cities of Sanandaj, Ghorveh and Saqqez - and now has ten cities after the last divisions of the country: Baneh, Bijar, Saqqez, Sanandaj, Ghorveh, Marivan, Divandarreh, Kamyaran, Sarvabad, Dehgolan.\n\nGeography\n\nThe green Kurdistan borders the provinces of West Azerbaijan and Zanjan to the north, Hamedan and part of Zanjan to the east, Kermanshah to the south and Iraq to the west. Its people speak Kurdish, and it should be noted that in some parts of this province, people also speak Azerbaijani.\n\nKurdistan has many forests, most of which are scattered around Baneh and Marivan. These forests contain various types of oak and other trees.\n\nClimate\n\nThis mountainous province, which is affected by the Mediterranean climate, has a cool and temperate climate in spring and summer. The spring rainfall and heavy winter snowfall are due to the same warm and humid Mediterranean air masses.\n\nSpring and summer with an average temperature of 22 to 25 degrees Celsius are a good time to travel to the cities of this province. However, nature lovers can always travel to the cities of Kurdistan in winter.\n\nCities of Kurdistan Province\n\nA long history, rich culture, festivals, handicrafts in different cities of the province, untouched nature and beautiful attractions have turned this province into an amazing destination for tourists.
