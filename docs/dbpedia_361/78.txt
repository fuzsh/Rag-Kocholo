The Connection Road DN5 km 60+500 – Belt Road – Friendship Bridge km 61+400 is a 7km bypass road construction project located in Giurgiu City, 64km south of Bucharest, Romania.

Giurgiu City has seen an increase in traffic due to their close vicinity to the border crossing point Giurgiu – Ruse, which has increased congestion within the city due to the international freight and passenger transport that transits through the city.

The aim of the project is to construct a route that reduces the congestion and pollutant emission levels withing the City whilst reducing the transit time for passenger traffic and international freight.
