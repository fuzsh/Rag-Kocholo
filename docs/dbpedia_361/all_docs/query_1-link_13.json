        "text": "The forests around Bucharest are part of a larger ancient forest, which once covered the most part of southern Romania. The remaining forested areas now bear the same name as the localities which they border - Pustnicu Forest, Snagov Forest, Râioasa Forest, Băneasa Forest. The alleys here or the shores of the lakes are perfect for walking or cycling, while a few well-maintained parks are good for relaxing: horseback riding centers or adventure parks add to the list of noteworthy places.\n\nAlthough they no longer have the greatness of yore, the woods are ideal for fun in nature, with friends or family, while also keeping the kids interested and busy."
