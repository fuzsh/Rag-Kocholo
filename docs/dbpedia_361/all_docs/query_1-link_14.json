That is why most Bucharesters choose to go out of the capital during summer holidays, or just for a few days during weekends.\n\nThe seaside and the mountains may be the perfect places to refresh during summer months. However, if you only have a day or two to relax and want to spend less than an hour on the road, we’ve made a list of pools and touristic complexes located near Bucharest.\n\nBlueberry Pool by Ambasad’Or Events is a luxury alternative to the public pool complexes in Bucharest.
