        "text": "The text search facility carries out a text search of the listing entry title, as well as parish or locality names.\n\nText Search Tips\n\nEnter a single word or combination of words to search for all entries containing that word or words. To search for an exact phrase, enclose it in quotes. For example:\n\nvillage searches for all entries containing the word \"village\"\n\nvillage green searches for all entries containing the words \"village\" and \"green\"\n\n\"village green\" searches for all entries containing the phrase \"village green\"\n\n\"village green\" garden searches for all entries containing the phrase \"village green\" and the word \"garden\"\n\nPostcode Search\n\nAlternatively, enter a valid British postcode to look for listed buildings within a five mile radius.\n\nID Search\n\nIf you enter either a current or legacy listing ID, any matching entries will be shown.\n\nAll current IDs, from all sources, are all-numeric, up to six digits long (eg, 123456).\n\nLegacy IDs from Historic England (English Heritage) are also all-numeric, up to five digits long (eg, 12345).\n\nLegacy IDs from Historic Scotland begin with the letters LB and then up to five digits (eg, LB1234)\n\nBecause of the possibility that different sources may use the same ID, ID searches do not necessarily return a unique result. Also, some buildings have subsequently been split into multiple inividual listings, so a legacy ID may return more than one current result.\n\nFull Text Site Search\n\nAlternatively, you can use the full text site search powered by Google."
