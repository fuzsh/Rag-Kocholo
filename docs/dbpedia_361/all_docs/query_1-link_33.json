        "text": "Background and Purpose: Emergency Department (ED) staff are frequently faced with road traffic injury victims and also play role as various road users. This study was conducted to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices of ED staff towards road safety at referral trauma hospitals of Tabriz. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020 in the referral trauma hospitals of Tabriz. Data were collected using a standard questionnaire. Census sampling was used to select the participants. Descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation test and logistic regression model were used for the data analysis using SPSS Software. Results: The mean score of the ED staff in traffic safety knowledge, attitude and practices was 9.73 ± 2.28 out of 15, 95.3±11.4 out of 118, and 61.3±8 out of 76, respectively. The staff’s traffic safety knowledge was associated with their attitude and practices. Moreover, the univariate logistic regression modeling results revealed that participants' traffic safety attitude (OR= 0.96 (95% CI= 0.93-0.99)) and practices (OR= 0.95 (95% CI= 0.91-0.99)) were, independently, correlated with a reduction in road traffic accidents. Conclusions: The ED staff’s attitudes towards traffic safety had a positive correlation with their practices and also accident experience. Nonetheless, after adjusting the data in terms of knowledge and attitude, road traffic safety practice was not associated with participants' accident experience. It is crucial to consider road safety education in colleges to promote safety knowledge of graduate individuals which will have conspicuous results in risk reduction.\n\nRoad traffic crashes cause social, economic, physical and emotional losses. They also reduce operating speed and road capacity and increase delays, unreliability, and productivity losses. Previous crash duration research has concentrated on individual crashes, with the contributing elements extracted directly from the incident description and records. As a result, the explanatory variables were more regional, and the effects of broader macro-level factors were not investigated. This is in contrast to crash frequency studies, which normally collect explanatory factors at a macro-level. This study explores the impact of various factors and the consistency of their effects on vehicle crash duration and frequency at a macro-level. Along with the demographic, vehicle utilisation, environmental, and responder variables, street network features such as connectedness, density, and hierarchy were added as covariates. The dataset contains over 95,000 vehicle crash records over 4.5 years in Greater Sydney, Australia. Following a dimension reduction of independent variables, a hazard-based model was estimated for crash duration, and a Negative Binomial model was estimated for frequency. Unobserved heterogeneity was accounted for by latent class models for both duration and frequency. Income, driver experience and exposure are considered to have both positive and negative impacts on duration. Crash duration is shorter in regions with a dense road network, but crash frequency is higher. Highly connected networks, on the other hand, are associated with longer length but lower frequency.\n\nTransportation problems are caused by many factors. In addition to factors directly related to the transportation itself, such as traffic density, the availability of adequate public transportation, it is also influenced by other factors outside of transportation. The phenomenon of student shuttle activities using motorbikes is one of the causes of transportation problems. This phenomenon appears in almost all of Indonesia, including in Gianyar Regency. The frequency of these activities is influenced, among others, by the time schedule for teaching and learning at school (half day school) and the behavior and habits of the community in traffic. The habit of picking up students by motorcycle is getting stronger along with the low quality of public transportation services. Data collected from 14 junior high schools in Gianyar district showed that almost 48% of students were picked up by their parents using motorbikes. Meanwhile, 17.80% of students ride their own motorbikes for school activities. The consequences of these problems include congestion and the possibility of experiencing traffic accidents, inefficient use of time and costs and air pollution. On the other hand, the Gianyar Regency government has operated free student transportation #AMAN to serve students in 43 junior high schools, although its operations have not covered the entire region. The purpose of this study was to find how do push and pull strategies affect student's shuttle activities using motorbikes? The study was conducted in 14 junior high schools with 400 respondents from parents of students. The analytical method used is SEM-AMOS. The result of this study is that there is a fairly strong influence of the pull strategy on the willingness to move using student transportation. Meanwhile, the pull strategy has a less strong influence on behavioral changes in the use of motorcycle for student's shuttle activities.\n\nSustainable urban mobility and road safety have been both a challenge and a priority at the European level for two decades now. Urban road traffic crashes are some of the most difficult issues to tackle by the local administrative planning and development authorities in Europe. The aim of this study was to enhance the focus on urban road safety by providing an illustrative spatial and temporal overview on the road crashes occurred in the cities and towns of Romania and their effects on the people involved. Data related to urban road crashes for a 12-year reference period from 2008 to 2019 were used. Results showed no significant difference in the number of road traffic crashes in 2019 compared to 2008. However, the impact on the people involved show a decrease in severity, the number of road crashes deaths in 2019 being halved compared to 2008. We note a redistribution in the occurrence of these events at the city level, for the period 2008-2019, whilst the most affected are the cities of rank 1 and 2. All rank 1 cities in Romania were detected as hotspots with a high concentration of road traffic crashes and casualties, designated as low-safety road traffic urban poles. We argued in favour of customized and relevant strategies for sustainable and safe urban transport in accordance with the particular features of the cities and towns in Romania, given the varied severity degree of the phenomenon and the specific features of road infrastructure and road traffic.\n\nBackground Various strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 including lockdown and stay-at-home order are expected to reduce road traffic characteristics and consequently road traffic collisions (RTCs). We aimed to review the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence, patterns, and severity of the injury, management, and outcomes of RTCs and give recommendations on improving road safety during this pandemic. Methods We conducted a narrative review on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on RTCs published in English language using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar with no date restriction. Google search engine and websites were also used to retrieve relevant published literature, including discussion papers, reports, and media news. Papers were critically read and data were summarized and combined. Results Traffic volume dropped sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic which was associated with significant drop in RTCs globally and a reduction of road deaths in 32 out of 36 countries in April 2020 compared with April 2019, with a decrease of 50% or more in 12 countries, 25 to 49% in 14 countries, and by less than 25% in six countries. Similarly, there was a decrease in annual road death in 33 out of 42 countries in 2020 compared with 2019, with a reduction of 25% or more in 5 countries, 15–24% in 13 countries, and by less than 15% in 15 countries. In contrast, the opposite occurred in four and nine countries during the periods, respectively. There was also a drop in the number of admitted patients in trauma centers related to RTCs during both periods. This has been attributed to an increase in speeding, emptier traffic lanes, reduced law enforcement, not wearing seat belts, and alcohol and drug abuse. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has generally reduced the overall absolute numbers of RTCs, and their deaths and injuries despite the relative increase of severity of injury and death. The most important factors that affected the RTCs are decreased mobility with empty lines, reduced crowding, and increased speeding. Our findings serve as a baseline for injury prevention in the current and future pandemics.\n\nTout espace géographique notamment urbain est exposé aux risques majeurs de natures différentes et d’occurrences variées. Si le risque ne peut être évité car ces espaces portent en puissance une certaine vulnérabilité physique et socio-économique, il convient alors de les doter d’une certaine résilience qui leur permet une certaine capacité à rebondir et à assumer un fonctionnement normal après une catastrophe. Pour assurer cette résilience il est indispensable de pouvoir évaluer l’état des zones sources c’est-à-dire les éléments du territoire qui participent par leur nature à la gestion des crises. Parmi celles-ci l’ensemble des entités matérielles et humaines qui assument la fonction sanitaire en particulier médicale implantées dans l’espace géographique urbain considéré en l’occurrence la ville de Batna et sa région. L’approche méthodologique : Le doctorant doit d’abord effectuer un état des lieux sur la fonction sanitaire en identifiant, en classifiant et en spatialisant l’ensemble de ces entités. Dans un deuxième temps ces entités doivent être implémentées dans une base de données SIG avec leurs attributs. Ensuite tout le réseau routier doit être analysé, géospatialisé et implémenté dans la base de données. En troisième lieu l’articulation du réseau routier avec la répartition spatiale des entités sanitaires doit permettre d’opérer une analyse Net Works (Analyse réseau) qui servirait à proposer plusieurs scénarios de risques majeurs dans la ville de Batna et sa région. Ces derniers doivent répondre à une réelle prise en charge des probables situations de crise (Inondations, séismes, risques technologiques…). Le travail doit déboucher sur un diagnostic objectif sur les forces et les faiblesses du système sanitaire en termes de capacités à répondre aux sollicitations d’une crise et proposer des solutions capables de renforcer la résilience de la ville Any geographic area, particularly urban, is exposed to major risks of different kinds and of varying occurrences. If the risk cannot be avoided because these spaces potentially carry a certain physical and socio-economic vulnerability, it is then necessary to endow them with a certain resilience which allows them a certain capacity to rebound and to assume normal functioning after a disaster. . To ensure this resilience, it is essential to be able to assess the state of the source areas, that is to say the elements of the territory which by their nature participate in crisis management. Among these are all the material and human entities which assume the health function, in particular the medical one, located in the urban geographic space considered in this case the city of Batna and its region. The methodological approach: The doctoral student must first carry out an inventory of the health function by identifying, classifying and spatializing all of these entities. Secondly, these entities must be implemented in a GIS database with their attributes. Then the entire road network must be analyzed, geospatialized and implemented in the database. Thirdly, the articulation of the road network with the spatial distribution of health units should make it possible to carry out a Net Works analysis (network analysis) which would serve to propose several major risk scenarios in the city of Batna and its region. These must respond to real management of probable crisis situations (floods, earthquakes, technological risks, etc.). The work should lead to an objective diagnosis of the strengths and weaknesses of the health system in terms of its capacity to respond to the demands of a crisis and to propose solutions capable of strengthening the resilience of the city.\n\nThe paper investigates the accidents and fatalities on the main road network in the North-West Region of Romania over a period of 4 years (2015– 2018). The aim of the paper is to highlight some shortcomings and suggest possible improvements of the road network in order to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities. Detailed analyses, including statistical and spatial statistical analyses, were conducted on the accidents involving goods and public transport vehicles considering the scale of their impact. As a result, black corridors and vulnerable municipalities were identified. They were found to be related to the reduced main road density and high levels of freight traffic transit. In conclusion, with one of the lowest motorization rates in the EU and given the important efforts already made by the police, improving road network in Romania becomes the key for reducing accident and fatality rates in the region. In this regard, it is suggested that motorways and ring roads are needed in order to bypass the vulnerable municipalities. The results of this research may enable planners and administrations to act strategically to improve road safety in the critical areas, to prioritize actions for road network development and to formulate better strategies to ensure road safety.\n\nRoad crashes have become a serious issue, and their negative impact, both socially and economically, has been subject to policies and programmes worldwide as well as a research topic for numerous studies in various fields. The present study aims to identify and demonstrate the persistence of certain features related to the occurrence and location of road crashes in Cluj County, Romania, which is a territory recording a constant high road crash incidence in the last decade. We used descriptive statistics to illustrate the key features of road crashes occurring in urban and rural areas, by road type, within the administrative territory of Cluj County, Romania. The analysis was focused on four main aspects: causes, effects in terms of persons injured and deaths, occurrence by road type, and location within and outside urban areas. The years 2019, 2009, and 2018 were considered as reference moments for the values recorded for all indicators in the analysis. Results showed a general trend of decrease in road crash incidence in 2019 compared to 2009, which was also confirmed by the absolute and relative increase in the period 2018-2019. The most significant decrease was found in the number of deaths, especially in the case of road cras h e soccurring on national roads and urban streets, where the incidence is still quite high. However, when ranked considering the number of crashes caused, we noted the persistence of certain categories of triggering factors for the high incidence of road crashes related to both drivers and pedestrians. Road safety is very much related to the behaviour of all participants in traffic and not so much to the road infrastructure and quality, although road capacity may be a triggering factor for drivers’ behaviour. Further measures are needed to enhance road safety and meet the European target of halving the road crash number and fatalities until 2020 and in the next decade."
