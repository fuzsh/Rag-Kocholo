The contract duration is 42 months, with 12 months for design and 30 months for execution.\n\nThe contract value amounts to 830.68 million lei, excluding VAT, with funding from the Large Infrastructure Operational Program (POIM).\n\nOn the other hand, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu stated on Friday that he promises that this year 147.8 km of the Moldova highway will be opened to traffic.\n\n\"No matter how much you may have developed within the county, if there is no connection with the rest of the country, with Transylvania, if we don't cross the Carpathians Mountains, if we don't have a highway to Bucharest, if we don't have a ring road from Bucharest to Constanta, Oltenia, Craiova, we don't open up the country, forgive me (...) Moldova has no chance,\" said Marcel Ciolacu in Suceava."
