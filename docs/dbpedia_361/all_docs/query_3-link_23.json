Datto has developed Inverse Chain Technology™ that uses the best of both of these backup strategies.\n\nInverse Chain Technology™ ensures reliable backups which fundamentally changes the way backup and recovery is done allowing for every incremental snapshot to be a fully constructed recovery point.\n\nThis increases the backup chain's redundancy and the flexibility in how each point is stored and used to virtualize a system in a disaster recovery scenario.\n\nLearn more about backup technologies"
