Genes involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism were also well represented and included several copies of lipid-transfer proteins, glyoxalase 1, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, (acyl-carrier-protein) S-malonyltransferase, lipophosphoglycan biosynthetic protein, phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, 3- hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and protein phosphatase type 2C proteins. Signal transduction-genes were well represented in the study and include several copies of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases, postsynaptic protein CRIPT, ras-related small GTP-binding protein RAB1c and Rab11, RAN2 small Ras-like GTP-binding nuclear protein, GTP-binding proteins, GTP cyclohydrolases, protein kinases, AMP-binding proteins, and ABC transporter-like proteins. Genes involved in proton pumps and Ca 2+ transport included several copies of potassium transporters, calmodulin 6 and Myo- inositol 1-phosphate synthase-like proteins, as well as endomembrane and integral membrane proteins, a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases, importin beta, and calcium-binding proteins. When comparing the expression of genes between genotypes, it was apparent that genotype specific differential expression patterns could be discerned (supplementary material Table S3). In the susceptible Tugela and the tolerant Tugela- Dn2 , genes related to stress, proton pumps and Ca 2+ transport, protein biosynthesis and modification, cell cycle regulation, and cellular respiration were differentially regulated. Genes significantly up- regulated in the susceptible Tugela but not in Tugela- Dn2 , included senescence associated genes (i.e., a decay protein, an auxin-responsive protein, senescence-specific cysteine protease SAG12, senescence-associated proteins), carboxylesterases involved in ROS production, and a ras-related small GTP- binding protein RAB1c involved in cell signaling. While carbon flux and photosynthesis related genes (i.e., ferredoxin– thioredoxin reductase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, chloroplast 50S ribosomal protein, ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit) were up-regulated only in the tolerant Tugela- Dn2 . Similar general trends in the regulation of genes belonging to specific functional categories were observed in the antibiotic (Tugela- Dn1 ) and antixenotic (Tugela- Dn5 ) genotypes. Transcripts involved in the metabolism of cofactors, vitamins, secondary metabolites, transcription factors (e.g. MADS-box TFs and T48034 bZIP transcription factor-like proteins), defence, as well as ROS and signal transduction were differentially regulated in both genotypes. However, the photosystem II type I chlorophyll a b binding protein and thioredoxin f1 were only significantly up-regulated in the antibiotic Tugela- Dn1 , while the non-green plastid inner envelope, chlorophyll synthetase and photolyase blue-light receptor were only up-regulated in the antixenotic Tugela- Dn5 . Interestingly, genes belonging to secondary metabolism and ROS that were differentially regulated only in the antixenotic Tugela- Dn5 , included glutathione S-transferase (significantly up-regulated) and manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) (significantly down- regulated); cellulose synthase involved in cell wall synthesis and phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase in membrane synthesis (significantly up-regulated); monooxygenase, b -glucosidase and O-methyltransferases involved in the production of VOCs (significantly up-regulated); and a viral resistance protein and Pto kinase interactor (significantly up-regulated). Genes that were differentially regulated in the antibiotic Tugela- Dn1 and tolerant Tugela- Dn2 , but not the antixenotic Tugela- Dn5 included genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis (i.e., 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase), SAR DNA- binding protein-1 and a serine/threonine-specific protein kinases involved in cell signaling. To elucidate the effect of D. noxia feeding on the NILs, levels of ROS enzymes (peroxidase, LOX and GST) and a SAR marker enzyme ( b -1,3-glucanase) were measured in uninfested leaf tissue (Figs 2–5). The activity of peroxidase and GST were significantly higher in the resistant NILs Tugela- Dn1 and Tugela- Dn5 after infestation with D. noxia when compared with susceptible Tugela and the tolerant Tugela- Dn2 (Figs 2 and 3). Even though LOX activity was higher in the resistant NILs when compared with the susceptible Tugela, the activity did not differ significantly ( P # 0.05) (Fig. 4). Glucanase activity increased in the resistant NILs when compared to the susceptible Tugela after D. noxia feeding (Fig. 5). To corroborate the changes in the oxidative burst in the NILs in response to D. noxia biotype SA1 feeding, leaves were collected and stained for H 2 O 2 using 3,3 9 -diaminobenzidine (DAB), which forms reddish-brown polymerized deposits in the presence of peroxidase (Fig. 6). Dark staining was observed in Tugela- Dn1 and Tugela- Dn5 around the feeding sites (Fig. 6B and Fig. 5D), but staining was only visible around the regions where the leaves were cut in Tugela and Tugela- Dn2 (Fig. 6A,C). This indicates that the generation of aphid-induced ROS was active only in the NILs associated with antibiotic and antixenotic resistance responses, but not the susceptible Tugela nor the tolerant Tugela- Dn2 . Effective wheat host defence responses against D. noxia occur via different modes of resistance: antibiosis, antixenosis, tolerance, or a combination of these (Painter, 1951; Painter, 1958). These must be mediated by specific genetic pathways, and signal transduction, ethylene-mediated responses and systemic resistance have been described as possible ways to counteract the attack by D. noxia (Botha et al., 1998; Botha et al., 2005; Botha et al., 2006; Botha et al., 2010; Boyko et al., 2006; Smith and Boyko, 2007; Smith et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2010; Van Eck et al., 2010; Marimuthu and Smith, 2012; Liu et al., 2011). In order for the host to sustain growth and proliferate under attack by phloem feeding insects, it must be able to recognize the invasion and initiate a defensive response. For this, the host must utilize an effective signaling cascade to initiate defensive syndromes to ensure survival (van der Westhuizen et al., 1998a; van der Westhuizen et al., 1998b; Botha et al., 1998; Botha et al., 2005; Botha et al., 2006; Botha et al., 2010; Boyko et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2010; Smith and Boyko, 2007; Van Eck et al., 2010; Marimuthu and Smith, 2012). Failure to do so is associated with elevated stress and early onset of senescence and under severe infestations, even death, as observed in the susceptible Tugela cultivar. Diuraphis noxia feeding elicits salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid/ethylene (JA/Eth) signalling pathways during mobilization of defensive strategies against aphids as shown by the induction of transcripts associated with these plant hormones (Miller et al., 1994; Botha et al., 1998; Moran and Thompson, 2001; Voelckel et al., 2004; De Vos et al., 2005; Divol et al., 2005; Mewis et al., 2005; Zhu-Salzman et al., 2005; Thompson and Goggin, 2006; Couldridge et al., 2007; Ku ́nierczyk et al., 2008; Gutsche et al., 2009; Botha et al., 2010). Measurement of b -1,3- glucanase activity (a SAR associated enzyme) showed significant differences in the activity of this enzyme between the resistant NILs and the susceptible Tugela (van der Westhuizen et al., 1998b), which ensured sustained long-term systemic acquired resistance. In resistant varieties, the early (within the first 5 hpi) up- regulation of transcripts associated with an increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ (Czempinski et al., 1997; Bouch ́ et al., 2005; Ma and Berkowitz, 2007) have been shown to accompany D. noxia feeding (Botha et al., 2010). This process may initiate long- distance calcium-activated protein kinase signalling cascades (Kehr, 2006) transmitting primary recognition responses to multiple downstream effectors, including activation of the oxidative burst (elevated H 2 O 2 ) (Foyer and Noctor, 2005; Foyer and Noctor, 2009) to induce cell death or necrosis (van der Westhuizen et al., 1998a; van der Westhuizen et al., 1998b; Boyko et al., 2006; Botha et al., 2005; Botha et al., 2006; Botha et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2005; Smith and Boyko, 2007) and the hypersensitive response (HR) (Grant et al., 2000; Botha et al., 2005; Botha et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2010) during incompatible interactions. Signalling cascades are well described in the plant pathology literature (Hammond-Kosack and Jones, 1996; Dangl and Jones, 2001; Lam et al., 2001), and these are especially prominent in the antibiotic and antixenotic cultivars. Signalling cascades activate downstream proteins through phosphorylation, propagating a recognition signal that eventually leads to defence responses, most often in the form of a HR. Indeed, D. noxia feeding on antibiotic cultivars, like those containing Dn1 , initiates an HR closely resembling that observed during plant–pathogen interactions. HR is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), like hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and programmed cell death at the site of aphid probing. This is analogous to events at the site of hyphal penetration by pathogenic fungi or during bacterial ingress. ROS also induce the accumulation of salicylic acid, which in turn stimulates the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins like chitinases (Botha et al., 1998), peroxidases (van der Westhuizen et al., 1998b) and b -1,3-glucanases (van der Westhuizen et al., 1998a; van der Westhuizen et al., 2002), which accumulate in the apoplast of resistant plants within 24 hours of infestation (Botha et al., 1998). The exact function of these proteins in aphid defence remains unclear, but it has been suggested that chitinases might ...\n\nContext 2\n\n... via different modes of resistance: antibiosis, antixenosis, tolerance, or a combination of these (Painter, 1951; Painter, 1958).

The exact function of these proteins in aphid defence remains unclear, but it has been suggested that chitinases might generate oligosaccharide elicitors from chitinous compounds released during aphid feeding (van der Westhuizen et al., 1998b). To assess whether the activation of HR-associated ROS differed between the NILs after D. noxia feeding, the activity of ROS enzymes was measured and DAB staining was performed to detect the presence of H 2 O 2 in infested leaves. Staining with DAB revealed more oxidised deposits in the leaf tissue of the antibiotic Tugela- Dn1 and to a lesser extent in the antixenotic Tugela- Dn5 (Fig. 6). In Tugela- Dn1 , thioredoxins are highly up-regulated when compared to the other NILs, these transcripts are known to be key in modulation of oxidative stress response (Vieira Dos Santos and Rey, 2006). However, little evidence of such a response is present in the susceptible Tugela and tolerant Tugela- Dn2 . Higher levels of peroxidase activity were measured in the antibiotic Tugela- Dn1 and antixenotic Tugela- Dn5 , but not in the other NILs in response to feeding by D. noxia biotype SA1 (Fig. 2). Elevated levels of GST activity were also measured in the antibiotic Tugela- Dn1 and antixenotic Tugela- Dn5 , but not in the other NILs after infestation by D. noxia (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the enhanced LOX activity in the resistant plants as previously reported (Fig. 4) (Berner, 2006; Botha et al., 2010) was not observed in the present study. This may be ascribed to the fact that the host plants under study contained different resistant genes and were infested by different D. noxia biotypes. The timely generation of an oxidative burst and expression of ROS enzymes were prominent in Tugela- Dn1 and Tugela- Dn5 (van der Westhuizen et al., 1998a). Delayed (Tugela) or reduced (Tugela- Dn2 , tolerant line) induction seems to be ineffective in initiating this kind of defensive strategy. Feeding by D. noxia characteristically leads to sealing off of transport elements, thereby allowing the aphid direct access to sap elements (Will and van Bel, 2006; Will et al., 2007). This process promotes apoplasmic and symplasmic isolation from the conducting elements, which may be the symptomatic causal effect of leaf rolling and streaking in susceptible varieties (Matsiliza and Botha, 2002; Saheed et al., 2007; Saheed et al., 2009). Even though the dubious resistance background of the antixenotic Dn5 gene (Heyns et al., 2006) impairs accurate assessment of its effects during aphid feeding, differential expression of genes in the Tugela- Dn5 NIL seem to link antixenosis with the fortification of the cell wall elements. Indeed, cell wall fortification and rapid deposition of callose in sieve pores has been viewed as an efficient wound response that seals off the pores in damaged phloem to prevent assimilate loss (Sj ̈lund, 1997). The up-regulation of cellulase synthase (Richmond and Somerville, 2000) and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (Kent, 1997; Jackowski and Fagone, 2005) is thus not unexpected in the antixenotic Tugela- Dn5 . However, antixenosis is mostly associated with the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In the present study, the up- regulation of transcripts such as b -glucosidase (Mattiacci et al., 1995; Morant et al., 2008a; Morant et al., 2008b) and O methyltransferase (Lam et al., 2007), associated with the production of VOCs were only differentially up-regulated in the antixenotic Tugela- Dn5 , when compared with the other NILs. In Pieris brassicae , it was shown that b -glucosidases attractive to parasitic wasps ( Cotesia glomerata ) are produced in response to herbivory as defensive strategy (Mattiacci et al., 1995). O methyltransferases on the other hand, constitute a large family of enzymes that methylate the oxygen atom of a variety of secondary metabolites including phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and alkaloids that result in VOC production (Lam et al., 2007). Further support for VOC production in a Dn5 genetic background, comes from a study by Ni and Quisenberry (Ni and Quisenberry, 2000). In the latter, higher levels of cyclic hydroxamic acids (e.g., 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one [DIBOA] and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one [DIMBOA]) were found in the Betta- Dn5 host plant, when compared with Betta NILs containing other Dn resistance genes (Ni and Quisenberry, 2000). Even though the authors could not conclusively tie the high levels of DIMBOA to the observed D. noxia resistance in the Betta- Dn5 tested, DIMBOA nonetheless was shown in literature to contribute to plant resistance for both insect and pathogen pests in Gramineae (Niemeyer, 1988; Frey et al., 1997). DIMBOA has been reported to increase wheat resistance to pathogenic fungi (Weibull and Niemeyer, 1995) and five species of cereal aphids (Leszczynski et al., 1989; Leszczynski et al., 1995; Leszczynski and Dixon, 1990; Mayoral et al., 1994; Mayoral et al., 1996; Gianoli and Niemeyer, 1997). If the host is not able to activate an active defence syndrome, like in the case with the tolerant Tugela- Dn2 , an alternative defensive strategy must be sourced. Chlorosis due to D. noxia infestation is thought to originate from interference with electron transport (Burd and Elliott, 1996; Haile et al., 1999; Heng-Moss et al., 2003; Botha et al., 2006). Susceptible wheat shows decreased levels of chlorophyll a upon infestation by D. noxia (Burd and Elliott, 1996; Ni et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2004b) which indicates damage to Photosystem I (PSI) (Botha et al., 2006). If this is indeed the case, it has serious ..."
