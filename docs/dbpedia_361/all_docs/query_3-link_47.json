        "text": "High-quality hand therapy is critical to maximising functional capacity and optimising overall outcomes following hand injuries. Therapy delivery requires clear communication between surgeons and occupational therapists. At Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (SHSC), Canada’s largest tertiary care centre, suboptimal communication is a significant barrier to efficient hand therapy delivery in acute multisystem trauma patients. A baseline audit at SHSC found that 41% of hand therapy orders required clarification and 35% of patients waited over 24 hours before their order was fulfilled. In many cases, communication errors created unacceptably long delays that were suspected by surgeon stakeholders to impede patient outcomes. This highlighted an opportunity for investigation and system improvement. Using process mapping methodology, we outlined standard process involved in patient care and identified barriers to successful communication. We collaborated with key stakeholders to codesign a standardised template for care orders. We aimed to improve order clarity and consistency with the goal of reducing the incidence of clarification and delays. Postimplementation, the percentage of hand therapy orders requiring clarification was decreased to 24%. The number of patients waiting over 24 hours for therapy was also reduced; however, further investigation is required to verify this finding. In addition, essential order components were more consistently and comprehensively included. Next steps of this work include expanding the use of the order template outside of the multisystem trauma population and improving the communication of hand therapy at discharge from hospital.\n\nPurpose Lumbosacral plexus injuries usually occur in patients with severe, multiple traumas requiring intensive care, affecting gait function. The purpose of the present study was to identify the initial factors associated with gait outcome in lumbosacral plexus injuries caused by traumas. Methods We retrospectively identified 664 patients with pelvic fractures caused by trauma between 2006 and 2017. The lumbosacral plexus injuries were electrodiagnostically confirmed in 30 patients (4.5%). Demographic, injury-related, fracture-related and electrodiagnostic factors were compared between patients with long-term unassisted gait outcomes to those with assisted gait outcomes, with an average of 27 months elapsing after the trauma. Results Eleven patients (36.7%) remained in the assisted gait group during the follow-up period. Complex pelvic trauma, rather than the severity of trauma to the entire body, was associated with a poor gait outcome. Among the various causes of injury, pedestrians struck by vehicles were associated with assisted gait outcomes. The number of anatomic locations involved in pelvic fractures, pelvic ring instability by Tile classification, and the proportion of unstable sacral fractures were higher in patients with assisted gait outcomes compared with those having unassisted gait outcomes. Weaknesses in the initial hip extensor, knee flexor, ankle dorsiflexor and ankle plantar flexor were observed significantly more often in patients with assisted gait outcomes. The Dumitru and Wilbourn’s scale of the anterior and posterior sacral plexus was significantly higher in the assisted gait group. Conclusions Gait outcome after lumbosacral plexus injury is associated with the range and stability of the pelvic fracture and the severity of the anterior and posterior sacral plexus injury. Poor gait outcome was associated with the severity of the trauma to the pelvis rather than that to the entire body.\n\nObjectives. The paper highlights the importance of the kinetic recovery program used to regain post-arthrodesis hand function in the interphalangeal joint. Also, during the paper we will present both the techniques used and the methods applied in order to reduce pain and recover the remaining functional. Materials and method. During the study, a patient with open intra-articular communicative fractures AIFP D3, 4 in the right hand with bone-operated defect was analyzed. The patient was evaluated functionally postoperatively, during the recovery program and at the end of it. Results. During the recovery program, a progress and a good evolution of the hand functionality could be observed. Thus, the patient observed the kinetic program initially established by the physiotherapist and also it was possible to observe the increase of the mobility of the joints in the vicinity of the joints affected by the immobilization of the hand. During the recovery program, a decrease in edema was observed locally and an increase in the strength of the muscles of the hand. Conclusions. The physiotherapy program used to restore the functionality of the hand following arthrodesis at the level of the interphalangeal joints must be preceded by an appropriate evaluation and must include techniques adapted to the patient's abilities. An essential condition is a good collaboration between patient-physiotherapist-orthopedic surgeon, so that complications and recurrences can be avoided.\n\nThe superficial location of critical structures, including tendons, nerves and vessels, in the volar surface of the wrist makes them vulnerable to penetrating trauma. Extensive injuries to these structures are described as \"spaghetti wrist\". The main objective of this study was to report functional outcome in spaghetti-wrist injuries. The records of patients presenting to our clinic with extensive volar wrist injuries between January 2016 and January 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. Age, gender, comorbidities, date of injury, injury mechanism, affected hand and transected structures were noted. Tendon function, opposition, intrinsic hand function, deformity and sensitivity were evaluated following the Noaman report. The Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHOQ) was used to evaluate hand-specific outcomes. Twenty patients were included. Mean age was 32.7 years (range, 18 to 47 years). Mean follow-up was 21.9 months (range, 12 to 50 months). Mean number of injured structures was 11.9 (range, 10 to 16 structures) per patient. Physiotherapy duration had an effect on postoperative outcome in all six MHOQ domains (r = 0.821, p = 0.00001). However, no significant difference in overall hand function was found according to the number of injured structures (r= -0.105, p = 0.661). Precise initial evaluation, meticulous surgical treatment within 24 hours and early physical therapy are essential after spaghetti-wrist injury. Good functional results are associated with prolonged physical therapy, but not with the number of structures injured.\n\nIntroduction: Contemporary epidemiological data on Bell's palsy are crucial to clarify disease burden and improve management strategies. We aimed to examine the epidemiology of, and factors associated with, Bell's palsy treated with steroids in Korea. Methods: Using the National Health Insurance claims data from 2008 to 2018, we determined the incidence, recurrence rate, and management trends of Bell's palsy treated with steroids. We defined Bell's palsy cases based on diagnostic codes and concurrent treatment with steroids. Results: The incidence of Bell's palsy showed an increasing trend (from 23.0 per 100,000 persons in 2008 to 30.8 per 100,000 persons in 2018). Age (60-69 years), sex (men), and month (January) were risk factors of Bell's palsy. The recurrence rate of Bell's palsy over the 11-year period was 1.5%. Male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.2) and physiotherapy (HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-0.99) were independently associated with the recurrence of Bell's palsy. During the study period, the use of electrodiagnostic testing steadily increased, whereas that of physiotherapy steadily decreased, and antiviral therapy fluctuated,. Discussion: The incidence and recurrence rates presented in this study are comparable with those reported in earlier studies that included patients with Bell's palsy, regardless of the use of steroids, and documented an increase in the burden of Bell's palsy. Further randomized controlled trials are required to ascertain the long-term effects of physiotherapy on recurrent Bell's palsy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
