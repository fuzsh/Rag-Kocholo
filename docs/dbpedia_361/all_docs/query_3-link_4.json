However, some data such as street names and house pricing is based on current postcodes only and so may be missing or incomplete.\n\nBasic Information\n\nArea Type Urban Local Authority Doncaster Ward Town Constituency Doncaster Central * Note that some postcodes straddle constituency boundaries.

They are performed once every 10 years. Our website shows 2021 data for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. For Scotland, 2011 data is shown (update coming soon, the Scottish census was delayed by a year unlike the rest of the UK). Please note: census information may include figures for adjacent streets and postcodes. The figures are therefore representative of the local area, not a specific street address or row of houses. The census collection is designed so that each group of postcodes should contain at least 100 people (50 in Scotland). This is done to preserve the anonymity of the people in that area, as some postcodes cover a very small area, sometimes a single building. You can see the area covered by the census statistics by clicking \"Show Census Area Covered\" below the map above.\n\nUsing this Information Commercially\n\nThe information we provide on the website is done so without charge. However, if you wish to use this data on other websites, or in any other public medium should consult our data sources page for information on how you should correctly attribute the information.\n\nHouse Prices\n\nThere have been no house sales reported to the Land Registry in this postcode since January 1st 1995.\n\nOur data comes directly from the Land Registry, and is updated monthly. It does not include commercial sales, or sales of land without property.\n\nHousing Types Embed This\n\nThe area containing Doncaster consists predominantly of terraced housing, which is common in suburban and inner-city areas. Please note that the figures may include adjacent streets - see the Summary tab for an explanation and map of the area that these figures cover.\n\nHousing Types Detached 5 Semi-Detached 10 Terraced 96 Flat (Purpose-Built) 6 Flat (Converted) 6 Residence in Converted Building inc. former schools, churches, warehouses 6 Residence in Commercial Building 5 Caravan/Park/Temporary 1\n\nTotal 135\n\nAre these numbers higher than you expected? Click here for explanation.\n\nHousing Tenure Embed This Back to Top\n\nThe area containing Doncaster contains a higher-than-average level of rented housing (excluding social housing) - 73% of household spaces. This contrasts with the national average of just over 20%.\n\nHousing Tenure Owned Outright 23 Owned with Mortgage 7 Shared Ownership 1 Rented: From Council 1 Rented: Other Social 5 Rented: Private Landlord inc. letting agents 94 Rented: Other 8 Rent Free 0\n\nTotal 139\n\nHousing Occupancy Embed This Back to Top\n\nThis data lists the total number of residents normally resident within each household. The figures do not record under- or over-occupancy.\n\nHousing Occupancy One Person 77 Two People 30 Three People 19 Four People 5 Five People 6 Six People 0 Seven People 0 8+ People 0\n\nTotal 137\n\nHousehold Composition Embed This Back to Top\n\nThe area containing Doncaster consists predominantly of single-person households, common in inner-city areas.\n\nHousehold Composition 1 Person Household 77 Family Household 52 Other Household 8\n\nTotal 137\n\nHousehold Deprivation Embed This Back to Top\n\nHousehold deprivation was measured against four dimensions for the 2021 census - employment, education, health/disability, and overcrowding.\n\nHousehold Deprivation Not Deprived 51 Deprived In One Dimension 56 Deprived In Two Dimensions 20 Deprived In Three Dimensions 8 Deprived In Four Dimensions 2\n\nTotal 137\n\nGender Embed This\n\nAcross the UK as a whole, the gender split is roughly 49% male, 51% female. The local area around DN5 8AA however is predominantly male (88%). This can be caused by a number of factors, but amongst the most common are: areas associated with nearby higher education, areas that contain large establishments such as boarding schools, and areas with younger populations (females on average live longer than males, so are more likely to be found in retirement areas).\n\nGender Male 930 Female 126\n\nTotal 1,056\n\nAge Groups Embed This Back to Top\n\nAcross the UK as a whole, the median age is 40. In general, inner-city areas show high concentrations of people aged 18-30, suburbs show larger numbers of small children and adults aged 30-50, and rural and small towns are more popular with older workers and retirees. Many poorer areas lack a majority age group, which is due in part to the people in that area being constrained by circumstance rather than being able to choose where to retire, raise a family or grow up.\n\nAge Groups 0-4 20 5-9 6 10-14 10 15-19 72 20-24 142 25-29 167 30-34 178 35-39 137 40-44 97 45-49 61 50-54 38 55-59 41 60-64 29 65-69 29 70-74 13 75-79 9 80-84 6 85+ 2\n\nTotal 1,057\n\nRelationship Status Embed This Back to Top\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of DN5 8AA there is a large concentration of residents that are single - 71% of the resident population. On average, around 38% of census respondents were single. Areas with large single populations are often in built-up areas, with good entertainment facilities. It is also common to see a younger population in these areas.\n\nFigures for relationship status do not include those aged under 16, or those family members aged 16-18 who are in full-time education. Following the Civil Partnership Act that came into force in 2019, census figures for 2021/2022 no longer categorise same sex relationships as a separate category. Civil partnerships are now included within the figures for the other categories (Married, Divorced and so forth).\n\nRelationship Status Single 749 Married 116 Separated 41 Divorced 99 Widowed 15\n\nTotal 1,020\n\nHealth Embed This Back to Top\n\nHealth in the UK is strongly tied to age as you would expect, but the affluence of a neighbourhood also has strong influence, with deprived areas often showing poorer standards of health.\n\nOverall, the UK considers itself to be healthy - 82% of residents rated their health as Very Good or Good. The full breakdown is as follows for the United Kingdom: 48.4% Very Good, 33.5% Good, 12.8% Fair, 4.1% Bad and 1.2% Very Bad.\n\nIt is noteable that the amount of residents reporting Very Good or Good health increased in 2021 compared to the previous census, despite an aging UK population. This may have been influenced by how people perceived their health aginst the backdrop of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, this area of the Town ward shows lower levels of residents that report their health as Good or Very Good (66%) than average, which is usually indicative of areas with older populations or areas of social deprivation.\n\nHealth Very Good 281 Good 417 Fair 251 Bad 79 Very Bad 31\n\nTotal 1,059\n\nEducation & Qualifications Embed This Back to Top\n\nAt the time of the 2021 census, across the UK 18.3% of residents had no qualification, 9.5% had 1-4 GCSEs, 13.4% had 5+ GCSEs and 1-2 A/AS-Levels, 16.9% had 2+ A-Levels, 33.7% had a degree (or similar), and 5.4% had an apprenticeship.\n\nThe qualification levels are based on current qualification names.

Some 9.7% have resided in the UK for 10 years plus, 2.9% for 5-10 years, 2.2% for 2-5 years, and 1.9% for less than two years.\n\nThe length of time a person has been resident in the UK has been calculated from the time a resident most recently arrived in the UK (excluding holidays/short stays outside the UK). However, residents that were born in the UK but emigrated and then later returned will still be counted as \"Born in the United Kingdom\".\n\nLength of Residence Born in The United Kingdom 894 10+ Years 62 5-10 Years 37 2-5 Years 29 Less Than 2 Years 38\n\nTotal 1,060\n\nPassport(s) Held Embed This Back to Top\n\nNote that an individual may hold one or more passports.
