Also, this means that A0 south should be completed, as well as a full motorway from Ruse to Turkish border.\n\nGiurgiu is really a small city to require alone a motorway connection, and it is not a priority for now in terms of traffic. What it is more busy than DN5 is DN6 towards Alexandria, and further to Craiova, which is worse because it is a 1x1 road. That would need an upgrade to at least an expressway, and it has been put on the project list for 2020-2030, and it would be a real mirracle if anything were done there..\n\nChrisZwolle\n\n· Moderator\n\nJoined May 7, 2006\n\n·\n\n62,529 Posts\n\nDN5 from Bucharest to the river is a mere single carriageway with 4 lanes. There is no median. So it doesn't need only some bypasses of the villages it goes through. Bigger upgrade is necessary there to reach the appropriate speed and safety. In addition this is the main connection of Bucharest towards Istanbul. Think about if Bucharest-Ploiesti was realized like that.\n\nAgreed, any motorway upgrade of DN5 would likely require a mostly greenfield alignment that is of a higher design standard and bypasses all towns and villages. But given that 4 lanes - even if undivided - is a luxury many other areas of Romania don't have yet, this'll likely be a lower priority, farther in the future.\n\nMichiH\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Jan 5, 2013\n\n·\n\n8,402 Posts\n\na pure motorway is needed there. The cost/benefit analysis will simply prove that fact.\n\nThere is no doubt that a motorway \"is needed\" but again and again and again. There are many projects with higher \"need\" and therefore likely a better cost/benefit relation. That's why I asked for a list.\n\nroaddor\n\n· Banned\n\nJoined Oct 13, 2015\n\n·\n\n13,680 Posts\n\nBucharest is not 4 million in the metropolitan area for sure. Mostly 2.3-2.4 mln. but that doesn't matter so much. Of course that motorway will not be built because of Giurgiu. I already mentioned what is its meaning. And definitely when the motorway approaches the river, a new bridge will be constructed to join the two banks. The old one will remain for local usage between Ruse and Giurgiu.\n\nBulgaria will start with the construction of the motorway from Ruse to V.Tarnovo next year. Then it will cross the Balkan Mountains as a second stage and finally it will reach the existing A4 near Dimitrovgrad from where it goes already to Turkey. So the motorway to the Turkish border already exists.\n\nThere is no precondition that Bulgaria makes the whole motorway from Ruse to A4 in order for Romania to start with its part towards Giurgiu. Speaking about Alexandria, you could even begin that construction first and from a certain point where the motorway crosses DN5B to continue towards Giurgiu. In other words to reuse some section for both motorways.\n\nroaddor\n\n· Banned\n\nJoined Oct 13, 2015\n\n·\n\n13,680 Posts\n\nThere is no doubt that a motorway \"is needed\" but again and again and again.

This means that different parts of different motorways will be built simultaneously. Bucharest-Giurgiu is actually a very short and easy for construction motorway. It is also at the front of the priority list so there is not such a big reason to postpone it.\n\nIf you take the German requirements for motorways existence in terms of AADT, you know very well that there will be very few motorways in Romania and the other countries in the region.\n\nMichiH\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Jan 5, 2013\n\n·\n\n8,402 Posts\n\nIf you take the German requirements for motorways existence in terms of AADT\n\nI don't!

Sometimes the road is so wide going through small towns with no alignment, people randomly crossing everywhere as traffic ignores the speed limit going 80 km/h instead of 50. Last time I also saw people trading chickens in cages alongside the road in one of the towns on the way. It was so dangerous as traffic rushed by at 80 km/h+.\n\nLe Clerk\n\n· AUTOBANN.ED\n\nJoined Oct 22, 2007\n\n·\n\n82,422 Posts\n\nIn terms of capacity, speed, safety it is far from being good enough. 2x2 means there is a physical separation between the opposite roadways.

I just wrote that I'd like to see benefit/cost figures although I know that politicians do not strictly set priorities by these.\n\nIn terms of cost-benefit, definitely completion of A1, DX12, A3 and A0 are most important, and these remain key priorities,and they are in implementation now (either U/C, or contracted or in process of tender).\n\nThen comes A7, most\n\ncriminal route in Romania(most deaths on roads), which has traffic for a proper motorway and has immense economic benefits for the east part of the country, which will start being tendered this year.\n\nThen come the others, and it is not clear how they will be prioritised. Probably the connections to the Braila bridge will be a priority.\n\nThen it will be interesting what will be the next projects to be implemented. The continuation of A4 to south towards border with Bulgaria is very important because it is very very busy that section during the summer. That project is currently in preparation.\n\nOf course, A8 remains a key political and strategic priority and it needs to be started ASAP for all the reasons. There chances that the FS for the mountain section is ready next year, and so could be tendered, but it has some huge environmental issues, at least in what concerns the only wild bison reservation in Europe, which has been started successfully by Romania about a decade ago and now they are thriving and multiplying in the wild.\n\nroaddor\n\n· Banned\n\nJoined Oct 13, 2015\n\n·\n\n13,680 Posts\n\nDN5 has quite a good traffic by Romanian standards. Both local from Bucharest and international which is aggregated there from all directions north of the capital. I believe there are stretches of other roads with bigger traffic elsewhere in Romania but I am not sure the situation is far worse. For example DN2, which is supposed to be replaced by future A7, is not a 1+1 road nowadays. I mean E85 from Bucharest to the crossroad for Iasi and E58 to Iasi itself are almost all the way 4-lane single carriageway roads. Indeed the outer lanes are more like emergency ones i.e. their width is shorter but these are still 4-lane roads. The death toll is more related to the driving habits, not to the road itself. By the way Romania also has other roads in this format so DN2 is not an exception.\n\nbogdymol\n\n· Moderator\n\nJoined Feb 4, 2010\n\n·\n\n15,519 Posts\n\nI mean E85 from Bucharest to the crossroad for Iasi and E58 to Iasi itself are almost all the way 4-lane single carriageway roads.

When overtaking, you need to cross with one wheel onto the opposite direction. Sometimes cars from both directions want to overtake at the same time. That's when nasty accidents happen.\n\nRegarding the motorway to Giurgiu: it is indeed needed. However, with some minor adjustments (like installing a physical barrier between the 2 directions of traffic), traffic can be sustained for many years to come on that section.\n\nThere are other much more needed motorway sections in Romania where traffic is bumper to bumper, accidents are at a really high level, driving times much longer than they should, not being able to overtake as only 1+1 road etc. The only wise choice is to build proper infrastructure in those areas as soon as possible, and when most of such areas are completed, then to invest money into doubling an existing 2+2 road that has no congestion on it with a full motorway.\n\nLe Clerk\n\n· AUTOBANN.ED\n\nJoined Oct 22, 2007\n\n·\n\n82,422 Posts\n\nDN2 is devious. Conceived as a 1x1 road, but leaving the feeling of a 2x2, that is why people think they have 2 full lanes and are pushed into full front collissions. It needs to be fixed into a full 2x2, and Jersey separators, maybe by building some by-passes around all cities and towns, but that after they build A7 maybe. Or in parallel, as it happens with DN7 near Talmaciu, which has been widened in parallel to A1 building.\n\nDN1 modernisation (and DN7 on some sections) may be an example for both DN2 and DN5 (and DN6).\n\nChrisZwolle\n\n· Moderator\n\nJoined May 7, 2006\n\n·\n\n62,529 Posts\n\nThese wide roads encourage dangerous passing and often have a high crash rate.\n\nThe problem is a combination of functions: it carries long-distance truck traffic, commuters, local traffic, agricultural traffic and slow traffic due to a lack of service roads. You don't want tractors or even carts holding up traffic, so you need wide shoulders to pass them. But then this leads to dangerous passing where 4 vehicles don't safely fit on the roadway at high speed. But you can't turn it into 2+1 with alternating passing lanes due to the slow traffic and local / driveway access.\n\nA road with this function needs to be replaced by a motorway.\n\nroaddor\n\n· Banned\n\nJoined Oct 13, 2015\n\n·\n\n13,680 Posts\n\nThat's why I mentioned driving habits were the key factor. Lessons are not learned. Given the terrain and at least 2700km left, I think Romania should change the way it builds motorways. Otherwise some roads will wait very long time to be completed.\n\nThis is what DN2 looks like north of Urziceni. Overtaking is not that difficult provided the slower vehicle moves to the right. Even if it is a truck. The marking shows that it is completely legal to drive on the right. Sure A7 will solve the existing problems but Bucharest-Iasi is currently not a simple 1+1 road.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nFind local businesses, view maps and get driving directions in Google Maps.\n\nLe Clerk\n\n· AUTOBANN.ED\n\nJoined Oct 22, 2007\n\n·\n\n82,422 Posts\n\nYeah, but it is not 2x2 either. It is more like 2x1.5. This is why it does not allow even the minimum safety measures such as Jersey barriers on the median, because it would only leave a proper 1x1 road, which is more dangerous and prone to accidents, due to the very high traffic.\n\nThey are planning to turn it into a 2+1 alternative lanes*, but that solution is simply too little for the traffic on that road which is now proper for a full motorway.\n\n*That would be APIs proposal if I am not wrong.\n\nroaddor\n\n· Banned\n\nJoined Oct 13, 2015\n\n·\n\n13,680 Posts\n\nSiret/Ungheni-Giurgiu motorway will do good.
