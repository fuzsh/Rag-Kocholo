        "text": "Planning Authority: Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council\n\nPlanning Reference: 14/01076/FUL and 22/00238/COND\n\nSynopsis:\n\nAs part of the planning process it has to be demonstrated that a site is suitable for its proposed use taking account of ground conditions and any risks arising from land instability and contamination as well as after remediation, as a minimum, land should not be capable of being determined as contaminated land under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.\n\nWhilst the internal consultations did not identify and potential sources of contamination, given the sensitivity of the proposed development a contaminated land planning condition was attached to the decision notice.\n\nThe first stage in discharging the contaminated land planning condition was to prepare a Phase I desk study report and have the recommendations accepted by the local authority.\n\nThe history of the site and surrounds were researched using a combination of Ordnance Survey (O.S.) maps, street level imagery and aerial plates. The review indicated the site was undeveloped until the late 1920’s, subsequent maps identified the building as ‘Hill Crest’.\n\nAerial plates indicated the site had been cleared between 2013 and 2018, street level imagery narrowed the time to between 2015 and 2017.\n\nThe geological maps for the site revealed that drift deposits were not expected to be present on the site and the limestone bedrock would be present at the surface.\n\nConsultations with British Geological Survey and Public Health England indicated the site was in an area where basic radon measures were required.\n\nData provided by regulatory bodies identified ground workings 135m north east of the site, the O.S. maps indicate the area was a change in level associated with the school next to the ‘workings’ and did not pose a risk to the proposed development.\n\nOn completion of the desk based research a site reconnaissance visit was undertaken, this revealed the site had been cleared, a number of trial pits that had been used for infiltration tests were present on the site, these provided further information on the ground conditions and confirmed the absence of deposits of made ground.\n\nOn completion of the walkover survey a qualitative risk assessment was undertaken on the potential sources of contamination identified in the desk study report in order to determine if any warranted further investigation, this concluded that the potential for the site to be affected by radon required further assessment and it was concluded that the incorporation of basic radon measures would be sufficient to break the pollution linkages associated with radon.\n\nIn order to discharge the contaminated land planning condition the Phase I report was submitted under reference 22/00238/COND\n\nThe report was accepted and the condition discharged."
