        "text": "About the service\n\nPositive Step, is an adult social care assessment unit, which is registered to accommodate up to 35 people. The service takes referrals from an integrated discharge team at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. The service offers short term accommodation for people who require a comprehensive assessment and works towards building people’s confidence and skills to enable them to return home, or to a more suitable placement. They contribute to the discharge pathway to reduce hospital stays and prevent delayed discharge from acute hospital beds. Their purpose is to reduce or delay admissions to long term care, and to prevent re-admissions to hospital by facilitating a safe discharge with the appropriate support within the individual’s home and community.\n\nThe single storey purpose built home is split into three smaller areas, known as Hatfield, Cadeby and Hickleton units, each of which has separate adapted facilities. Access into and around the home is level providing equal access for people who mobilise using wheelchairs or other mobility aids.\n\nPeople’s experience of using this service and what we found\n\nPeople told us they were happy with the service provided at Positive Step. The resources available were focussed on assessment and re-enablement, to help people to achieve as much independence as possible. We received some very positive feedback from people, who told us they would recommend the service to others who found themselves in the same position.\n\nThere was a very strong focus on promoting people’s independence, choice and control, People's care and support very clearly focused on them having as many opportunities as possible for them to regain skills and maintain independence.\n\nThere was a person centred, caring and responsive ethos. People told us how they were treated with kindness and respect. We saw there was a positive atmosphere and engaging interaction during our visit.\n\nPeople were safeguarded from the risks of abuse. Risks associated with people’s care were assessed and monitored and people and relatives told us people were safe while staying at the home. People’s medicines were safely managed.\n\nPeople were supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff supported them in the least restrictive way possible, and in their best interests. The policies and systems in the service supported this practice.\n\nThere were enough staff to meet the needs of each person. Recruitment continued to be undertaken in a safe way. Staff were skilled, motivated and knowledgeable. They had received appropriate training and support and were encouraged to develop their individual skills. People received a balanced diet which met their individual needs and took into consideration their preferences.\n\nStaff told us they felt supported and they could raise any concerns with the registered manager and felt they were listened to. People told us they were aware of how to complain if needed. Staff knew people’s needs and were passionate about promoting people’s independence. People were respected and valued as individuals; and empowered as partners in their care.\n\nSystems of governance were in place to continually monitor the quality of the service. Feedback about the leadership and management was very positive and staff felt very well supported. Staff were professional and motivated to achieve the best outcomes for people. People were fully involved in their care and had opportunities to give feedback, which was used to further improve the service.\n\nRating at last inspection:\n\nThe service was rated good at the last inspection (published January 2017).\n\nWhy we inspected\n\nThis was a planned inspection based on the previous rating.\n\nFollow up\n\nWe will continue to monitor information we receive about the service until we return to visit as per our re-inspection programme. If we receive any concerning information we may inspect sooner.\n\nFor more details, please see the full report which is on the CQC website at www.cqc.org.uk\n\nThe inspection took place on 11 January 2017 and was unannounced. At the last rated inspection in October 2015 the service was rated as requires improvement with a breach in Regulation 12 Safe care and treatment.\n\nPositive Step, is an Adult Social Care Assessment unit, which is registered to accommodate up to 35 people.

Their purpose is to reduce/delay the admission to long term care and prevent re-admissions to hospital by facilitating a safe discharge with the appropriate support within the individual’s home and community.\n\nThe service had a registered manager. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are ‘registered persons’. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act and associated Regulations about how the service is run.\n\nAt the previous inspection we found medicines that were prescribed ‘as and when required’ [PRN] for example pain relief lacked information to guide staff how to safely administer them. People were not protected against the risks associated with medicines because the provider did not have appropriate arrangements in place to record and store medicines.\n\nAt this inspection we found improvements had been made. The registered manager had introduced robust medication policies, audits and PRN protocols. These helped to direct staff when ‘as required’ medication was to be given.\n\nWe received some very good feedback from people we spoke with. People told us staff were kind and courteous. They said they would recommend the service to anyone who found themselves in the same position on discharge from hospital.\n\nThe requirements of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 were in place to protect people who may not have the capacity to make decisions for themselves. The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) sets out what must be done to make sure that the human rights of people who may lack mental capacity to make decisions are protected, including balancing autonomy and protection in relation to consent or refusal of care or treatment.\n\nPeople’s physical health was monitored as required. This included the monitoring of people’s health conditions and symptoms so appropriate referrals to health professionals could be made. The deputy manager told us that a GP holds a weekly surgery at the service and staff could also easily access the occupational therapist as there were two full time staff based at the home. An advanced nurse practitioner is available at the service five days a week and the service also access community nurses. A physiotherapist was also available at the service to give guidance to staff.\n\nThere was sufficient staff with the right skills and competencies employed to meet the assessed needs of people staying in the home. The recruitment process was robust and helped the employer make safer recruitment decisions when employing new staff. Staff were aware of people’s nutritional needs and made sure they supported people to have a healthy diet, with choices of a good variety of food and drink. People we spoke with told us they enjoyed the meals and there was always something on the menu they liked.\n\nPeople we spoke with told us they felt safe while staying at the home. One person said, “I feel very safe here, staff are wonderful.” Staff had a clear understanding of potential abuse which helped them recognise abuse and how they would deal with situations if they arose.\n\nWe found the home had a friendly relaxed atmosphere which felt homely. Staff approached people in a kind and caring way which encouraged people to express how and when they needed support.\n\nStaff told us they felt supported and they could raise any concerns with the registered manager and felt that they were listened to. People told us they were aware of the complaints procedure and said staff would assist them if they needed to use it.\n\nThere were effective systems in place to monitor and improve the quality of the service provided. We saw copies of reports produced by the registered manager and the provider. The reports included any actions required and these were checked each month to determine progress.\n\nThe inspection took place on 5 and 6 October 2015 and was unannounced on the first day.

However, we found some of the systems to record and store medication was not sufficiently robust.\n\nSome people we spoke with told us the service did not meet their expectations as they thought they would be involved in more rehabilitation to enable them to return home. Some people told us they were bored and would do more for themselves if they were at home.\n\nPeople we spoke with told us they felt safe while staying at the unit.
