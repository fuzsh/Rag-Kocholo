        "text": "Our property valuation model calculates the latest property prices using data from trusted external sources in combination with available user-submitted information - this includes HM Land Registry which is the UK's official register for ownership of land and property in England and Wales.\n\nThe model takes into account what has sold, when and how prices have changed over time. It also brings in multiple datasources to cross reference accuracy with the latest sales data and cost per square foot benchmarks.\n\nIn addtion to this, we filter out bad data where we are able to identify it so we can improve accuracy.\n\nIf home improvements have been made or the property has been extended after it was last purchased, these improvements won't be taken into account if we don't know about them. For properties that have had home improvements made, you can get an updated valuation here.\n\n* Excluding properties that we've been unable to calculate a valuation for.\n\n** Excludes property transactions that occurred before 1995.\n\n^ The most recent sale where we have price per square foot data.\n\nWhilst all reasonable effort is made to ensure the information in this website is current, The Move Market does not warrant the accuracy or completeness and accepts no liability for any loss or damage or costs.\n\nContains HM Land Registry data © Crown copyright and database right 2023.
