        "text": "Hello everyone! We want to express our sincerest gratitude to the Association of Peruvians in Australia for their recent visit and our productive meeting. It was a pleasure to share our business plan with you and explore the exciting commercial opportunities between Peru and Australia. We are excited about the potential for collaboration in several key areas: 1. Chancay to Shanghai Port: A new route that will reduce shipping times from 25 days to just 10 days, facilitating #trade and improving logistical efficiency. 2. Airport Infrastructure Improvement: The modernization of Lima Airport Partners and Northern Airports will open up new possibilities for both tourism and cargo transport. 3. Peru Mining: Peru has vast mineral reserves and a competitive exportable offer that represents solid investment opportunities and a robust portfolio of Public-Private Partnership projects. We appreciate your commitment and are confident that, by working together, we can build a prosperous future for both countries. We look forward to continuing our close collaboration and achieving great success!

Over to #America! Let's visit #Mexico! Mexico is a federal republic in #CentralAmerica framed by the #Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the #Caribbean Sea. The capital of the country is Mexico City. Neighboring countries are the #US to the north and #Guatemala and #Belize to the southeast. Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world and has about 129 million inhabitants. The country is highly #biodiverse, encompasses diverse climatic conditions, and is home to a variety of animals and plants. It has a long history dating back to the #Aztec Empire, of which World Heritage sites such as Chichén Itzá can still be admired. The country is nevertheless also #industrial and many people are employed in the automotive industry or its supplier industries. Mexico's #road #network is approximately 377,000 kilometers long. In terms of traffic safety, it ranks in the middle of the world. #forgivingmobilityasmartandsecurefuture #tönnjesinternationalgroup #rainrfid\n\n#Uzbekistan is actively promoting tourism and foreign investment. Last year, Samarkand's airport underwent a complete reconstruction, and there are now plans to establish direct flights to Europe (currently, passengers need to make a stopover in places like Istanbul). The economic expansion project of this country has also led to the construction of a modern district in the eastern part of Samarkand, where several luxury hotels, business centers, conference halls, and a shopping center (in the video) have been built, all designed to emulate the architectural style of the country's historic buildings. This district primarily hosts tourists, business travelers, and visiting delegations. The hotels in the background are among the few skyscrapers in the city: in Samarkand, it's possible to construct buildings with a maximum of 9-10 floors only in the newer part of the city, as the city is under the protection of #UNESCO. It has been very interesting to observe Uzbekistan's development. In fact, Uzbekistan is the second-largest economy in the region, with a continuously growing GDP since 1996 (over 79 billion dollars in 2022, an increase of approximately 10 billion from 2021). Now, the economic and commercial interests of many countries that closed their doors to #Russia after the invasion of Ukraine are shifting towards Central Asia. And Uzbekistan is on the front row for doing business. #ICTWeek #Uzbekistan #business\n\n#Position Paper:* *Title:* Supporting the Development of the Ras Hanzir New Cargo Facility *Introduction:* As a leading construction company, ESC (Efficient Solutions in Construction) strongly supports the development of the Ras Hanzir New Cargo Facility in the Grand Harbour, Port of Valletta, Malta.
