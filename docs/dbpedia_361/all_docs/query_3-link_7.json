They are performed once every 10 years. Our website shows 2021 data for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. For Scotland, 2011 data is shown (update coming soon, the Scottish census was delayed by a year unlike the rest of the UK). Please note: census information may include figures for adjacent streets and postcodes. The figures are therefore representative of the local area, not a specific street address or row of houses. The census collection is designed so that each group of postcodes should contain at least 100 people (50 in Scotland). This is done to preserve the anonymity of the people in that area, as some postcodes cover a very small area, sometimes a single building. You can see the area covered by the census statistics by clicking \"Show Census Area Covered\" below the map above.\n\nUsing this Information Commercially\n\nThe information we provide on the website is done so without charge. However, if you wish to use this data on other websites, or in any other public medium should consult our data sources page for information on how you should correctly attribute the information.\n\nHouse Prices\n\nWe have found 4 property sales in Town End since the beginning of 1995.\n\nOur data comes directly from the Land Registry, and is updated monthly.
