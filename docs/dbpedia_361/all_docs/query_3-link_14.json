Hope this information will help #Seafarers #Owners #operators #Managers #CrewingCompanies who are planning to bring foreign flag vessels to #IndianCostaltrade under #Cabotagerule. As per #Section6(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (‚ÄòITA‚Äô or ‚ÄòAct‚Äô), an individual shall be treated as resident: a. If he/ she is in India for a period of 182 days or more during the previous year or b. If he/ she is in India for a period of 365 days within 4 years immediately preceding previous years and 60 days or more during the previous year. In other words, a person being an individual is treated as resident in India, if any of conditions i.e., (a) or (b) above is satisfied, otherwise such person is treated as non-resident. #CrewMember of a #Ship: Further, Explanation 1 to Section 6(1) states that in the case of an Individual being a citizen of India who leaves India in any previous year as a member of crew member of an Indian ship, the period of stay for that year specified above as 60 days is to be replaced with 182 days. Further, Explanation 2 to Section 6(1) read with Rule 126 states that to compute number of days stay in India, in respect of citizen of India who is a crew member of a #foreignboundship, the period starting from date entered into the continuous discharge certificate (‚ÄòCDC‚Äô) in respect of joining the ship for ‚Äòeligible voyage‚Äô to date entered into the CDC in respect of signing off by that individual from the ship in respect such voyage will not be included. ‚Äò#Eligiblevoyage‚Äô has been defined to mean a voyage entered by the ship in carriage of passengers or freight in international traffic, for the voyage having originated from any port in India and has a destination any port outside India and vice versa. On reading of Explanation 1, it can be understood that Explanation 1 i.e., enhanced period is applicable only in the case of Indian ships thereby for other ships, 60 days period of stay must be applied. Explanation 2 does not contain any reference to Indian ships thereby such explanation may be applicable for every foreign bound ship. Further, Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 are applicable only if such person being an individual, is a citizen of India. Particulars Indian Ship 182 days and explanation2. Other than Indian Ship ( Foreign Ship) 60 days and explanation 2. #Disclaimer: This is for the benifit and awareness of the Seafarers and Shipping communities only. Prepared this post based on the queries I have been receiving in last few days.

Philippines Moves to Protect Seafarers: New Restrictions on Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Transit The Philippines is taking steps to bar its seafarers from working on vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden near Yemen, due to escalating threats from Houthi militants in the region. The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) is implementing the following measures: - Banning Filipino seafarers from working on ships owned or managed by companies whose vessels have been previously attacked by Houthis, such as Evalend Shipping, Ray Car Carriers, and Zodiac Maritime. - Requiring ship owners to submit affirmation letters guaranteeing they will not employ Filipino seafarers on vessels transiting the Red Sea or Gulf of Aden. - Giving Filipino seafarers the option to refuse service on vessels planning to transit the high-risk areas and requiring adequate notice from ship owners. - Considering further expanding the ban to cover more shipping companies with vessels targeted by Houthi attacks. The Philippines is taking these actions in response to recent incidents, including the seizure of the car carrier Galaxy Leader, the sinking of the bulk carrier Tutor, and the attack on the Transworld Navigator, all of which involved Filipino crew members. The DMW emphasizes this is not an \"absolute prohibition,\" as Filipino seafarers can still work on ships from these companies that are not entering the high-risk zones. However, the department is planning to further strengthen the safety protocols for its seafarers.

During a press briefing on Tuesday in Manila, the Secretary of Department of Migrant Workers Hans Cacdac announced that as a first step they would be targeting the three shipping companies that owned or managed the vessels Galaxy Leader, Tutor and True Confidence. Filipinos will be barred from sailing on any of these companies' ships that are transiting in or near the Red Sea. The Department will look to widen the ban and Cacdac said they would be reviewing the records of other ships that have been targeted by the Houthi. He expects the list of ships involved in the ban could increase. They are also looking to require shipowners to submit affirmation letters that they will not employ Filipino seafarers to the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden. The Department has taken two prior actions including in March 2024 recommending that ships divert from Red Sea routes. The following month they specifically banned the employment of Filipinos on passenger or cruise ships transiting the Red Sea. Cacdac reports so far 78 Filipino seafarers have refused to sail due to planned transits in the high-risk zone. He also warned that they have received reports that some seafarers were not given an adequate amount of time to exercise the right to refuse to sail. He said shipowners must improve the time element of the notification and said they would consider actions against ships that failed to provide adequate notice. The Department emphasizes that it is not an ‚Äúabsolute prohibition‚Äù as Filipino seafarers can sail on other ships from these companies that are not entering the high-risk zones. They however are planning to further amend existing rules to provide better protection for Filipino seafarers.\n\nIndia fails on MLC 2006 when it comes to SHORE Leave for Indian Seafarers. Here's ground report: Last week Indian Master lodges official complaint at one Indian port as Shore leave given to only 5 ship staff per day ( that too Master needs to declare), no shore leave for family onboard and Immigration officers arrogance touches all time high. Finally matter was put in cold storage with sensible intervention by Port Authorities. Embarrassing situation leaves Seafarers high and dry. Because of NO SHORE LEAVE , Frustration looms large on the face of Indian Seafarers when ships calling Indian Ports. Last 120 days , Indian Seafarers have taken upon themselves to do something about it as Indian Seafarers Unions and Many Other Shipping Associations failed to yield any positive results. in June 2023, many Seafarers had planned to go on token strike but timely intervention by DG Shipping helped to contain the anger. Indian Ministry of Shipping has written letter to Indian Ministry of Home Affairs. Two government depts and Ministries are playing ping pong game. Net result, NO SHORE LEAVE at more than 200 Indian Ports. Only 7 Indian Ports are rated as Good for SHORE Leave for Indian Seafarers. 1. *Major ports:* Security managed by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) under Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India., Immigration and shore leave matters by Bureau of Immigration (BoI) under Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. 2. *Non-Major ports (Private Ports):* Security managed by Private security guards or Home guards depending upon respective State Governments, Immigration and shore leave matters by Bureau of Immigration (BoI) under Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Even if Yes written in attached sheet for Shore Leave doesn't mean 24 hrs free flow. It means, no fixed rules and Immigration officers will decide. example Gangavaram, Kakinada, Sikka .....all depends upon settings with agents. Settings in Indian Terms of Business means goodwill relationship ü§û"
