It will enable schools and the department to identify more quickly and accurately individuals who are involved in governance, and who govern in more than one context.\n\nThe information requested says nothing in itself about a person's suitability to govern. However, it is essential information for the department to be able to uniquely identify an individual and in a small number of cases conduct checks to confirm their suitability for this important and influential role.\n\nYou should provide all of the information requested insofar as it is available to you. A minimum set of information needs to be provided before a record can be saved."
