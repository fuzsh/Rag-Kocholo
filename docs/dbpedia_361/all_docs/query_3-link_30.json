We are a group of four doctors in partnership, and together with the rest of our fantastic practice team we aim to provide high quality care to all of our patients.\n\nWe are a training practice and are proud to support the training of a wide number health professionals including Foundation Doctors, GP Registrars, Student Nurses, Advanced Nurse practioners and Clinical Pharmacists.\n\nOur service is planned to meet the needs of the community, but we welcome any suggestions which may improve the service.\n\nIf you require a blood test and this has already been requested by one of our clinicians or a consultant at the hospital, you can attend our open blood clinic.\n\nThis runs Monday - Friday, between 8am - 10am with no appointment needed.\n\nAlternatively, if you cannot attend within these times, you can book an appointment to suit you."
