Monday will see the opening of circulation on another 13 km of the A0 South, the motorway built with EU funds around Bucharest.

„Circulation on another 13 km of the A0 South, between DN5 and DN4, will open on Monday, April 15, at 14:00.

The completion of works on another segment of lot 1 (Glina – Vidra) of the Southern sector of the Capital’s Ring Road makes it possible to circulate on the 6 km out of the 16.3 km of lot 2 (Vidra – Bragadiru), completed at the end of last year.

Starting Monday, circulation will practically be possible on approximately half (23.3 km) of the 52 km of the southern A0 semi-ring (between DN6 and DN4)", announced the manager of the National Company for Road Infrastructure Administration (CNAIR), Cristian Pistol, on Facebook.

The contractor for Lot 1 Glina - Vidra (16.93 km) is Alsim Alarko Sanayi Tesisleri Ve Ticaret AS from Turkey. The contract duration is 42 months, with 12 months for design and 30 months for execution.

The contract value amounts to 830.68 million lei, excluding VAT, with funding from the Large Infrastructure Operational Program (POIM).

On the other hand, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu stated on Friday that he promises that this year 147.8 km of the Moldova highway will be opened to traffic.

"No matter how much you may have developed within the county, if there is no connection with the rest of the country, with Transylvania, if we don't cross the Carpathians Mountains, if we don't have a highway to Bucharest, if we don't have a ring road from Bucharest to Constanta, Oltenia, Craiova, we don't open up the country, forgive me (...) Moldova has no chance," said Marcel Ciolacu in Suceava.
