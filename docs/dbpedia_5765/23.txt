The 24-year-old artist, whose promising career has been derailed by drug and legal problems, was honored for the autobiographical hit song "Rehab," in which she recounts her reluctance to seek help for excessive drinking.

She accepted the award from a London venue where she had just performed both "Rehab" and the equally personal tune "You Know I'm No Good." She was unable to attend the Los Angeles event because she is undergoing treatment for her addictions.

Winehouse thanked "my Blake incarcerated," referring to her husband Blake Fielder-Civil, who is in a London prison facing serious charges in connection with a pub brawl.

She also dedicated the award to her London hometown, "'cos Camden town is burning down."

Camden market, one of the British capital's most popular tourist districts, was devastated by a huge fire on Saturday. The area has long been one of Winehouse's favorite haunts.

The other nominees were Beyonce's "Irreplaceable;" the Foo Fighters' "The Pretender;" Rihanna Featuring Jay-Z's "Umbrella;" and Justin Timberlake's "What Goes Around ... Comes Around."
