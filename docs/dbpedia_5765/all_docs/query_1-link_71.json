        "text": "Amy Winehouse is born in Southgate, London, England. Her 2006 album Back To Black is hailed as a masterwork and makes her quite famous, but all the attention exacerbates her drug and alcohol addictions, and she dies of alcohol poisoning in 2011.\n\nAmy Winehouse's second album, Back to Black, is released in the US. It enters the Billboard chart the following week at #7, and surges to its chart peak of #2 after Winehouse wins five Grammy awards for the album the following year, including Record of the year and Song of the Year for \"Rehab.\"\n\nAmy Winehouse marries Blake Fielder at a secret ceremony in Miami. Their tumultuous relationship inspired many of the songs on her seminal album Back To Black.\n\nAmy Winehouse checks into rehab for the first time, entering the Causeway Retreat in Osea Island, England with her husband, Blake Fielder. They both start using again as soon as they get out.\n\nAmy Winehouse overdoses on a mixture of alcohol, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine after a London pub crawl. Her hospitalization causes the cancellation of her first US tour. The singer refused her record company's request to enter rehab for alcohol abuse, inspiring her hit record \"Rehab.\" She does eventually end up in a clinic, but never gets sober for good.\n\nThe debut album from Amy Winehouse, Frank, is finally released in the US eight months after her second album, and three years after its British release. Although critically acclaimed and massively influential in her native UK, it fails to set the American charts on fire, reaching its peak of #33 only after the singer's untimely death in 2011.\n\nBritish tabloid The Sun posts video they claim is of Amy Winehouse smoking crack. The 24-year-old singer has been in and out of rehab, and is clearly in ill health. The video was apparently taken by a guest at her home.\n\nAfter stopping off at a local shop in London on her way home from visiting her husband, who remains in prison, Amy Winehouse blows off some steam and attacks a photographer, which leads to the singer being escorted away by the police.\n\nAmy Winehouse is the big winner at the Grammy Awards, taking five trophies, including Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year (both for \"Rehab\").\n\nDuring her performance at Glastonbury Festival, Amy Winehouse punches a fan she mistakenly believes had thrown a hat at her beehive.More\n\nInstead of getting boozed up on the streets like most people on St. Patrick's Day, Amy Winehouse gets sloppy at her court hearing in London to face charges that she attacked a fan at a charity event in 2008."
