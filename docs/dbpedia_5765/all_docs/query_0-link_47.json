        "text": "Six-time GRAMMY Award-winner Amy Winehouse has been widely renowned not just as a British music icon and pop royalty, but as a trendsetting fashion influencer. To celebrate the late singer’s iconic outfits and impact on music, the GRAMMY Museum proudly presents Beyond Black – The Style Of Amy Winehouse.\n\nBeyond Black — The Style Of Amy Winehouse offers a retrospective of Winehouse’s career, her biggest influences, her most iconic fashion moments, and how she — while only living to be 27 and releasing two studio albums — left an indelible mark on music, fashion and pop culture.\n\nItems on display include some of her most cherished and unique outfits – including the halter dress she wore at her final stage performance in Belgrade in 2011 and her 2008 GRAMMY Awards outfit designed by Dolce & Gabbana – and never-before-seen handwritten lyrics, prolific journal entries, and home videos. The exhibit will also touch on how Winehouse’s untimely passing led her family to create the Amy Winehouse Foundation, which works to inspire children and young people to build their self-esteem and resilience so that they can flourish."
