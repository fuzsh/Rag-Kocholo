        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6 — Amy Winehouse, the British soul singer whose continued troubles with substance abuse have turned her into a tabloid regular, drew six Grammy nominations, including nods in the four premier categories, as the contenders for the 50th annual awards ceremony were announced here on Thursday.\n\nMs. Winehouse, who scored a hit with her modern twist on soul music but has suffered repeated setbacks including a drug seizure and cancellations of her tour, received nominations for album of the year, for “Back to Black” as well as for record and song of the year for the self-referential hit single, “Rehab,” about her refusal to enter treatment. This 24-year-old singer, whose well-publicized problems raised questions about how Grammy voters would view her, will also be in contention for best new artist when the awards are handed out Feb. 10 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and broadcast on CBS.\n\nThough Ms. Winehouse was the only performer to appear in all four of the most prestigious categories, she fell short of drawing the most nominations. That distinction went to the rap star Kanye West, who led the field with eight nominations, including his third for album of the year for the latest CD in his college-themed trilogy, “Graduation.” Mr. West’s nominations also included those for best rap album and two of the five slots in the best rap song field, “Good Life” and “Can’t Tell Me Nothing.”\n\nThe biggest surprise may have been the relatively low profile of Bruce Springsteen, whose new album, “Magic,” with the E Street Band, had been praised by critics as a return to his classic rock style. Mr. Springsteen did draw four nominations, but none in the marquee categories. “Magic” had been seen as a favorite for the album of the year category, which Mr. Springsteen has never won.\n\nInstead the album of the year field included surprise entries from recordings far removed from the pop mainstream, including the country singer Vince Gill’s “These Days,” and the jazz composer Herbie Hancock’s “River: the Joni Letters.” In addition to Ms. Winehouse and Mr. West, the competition will include the new album, “Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace,” from a previous Grammy favorite, the Foo Fighters.\n\nNominees for song of the year included “Before He Cheats,” recorded by Carrie Underwood, Ms. Winehouse’s “Rehab,” Rihanna’s hit “Umbrella,” and two unexpected contenders, Corinne Bailey Rae’s “Like a Star” and the hit song “Hey There Delilah” by the Plain White T’s.\n\nThe nominations came as the event’s organizer, the National Academy of Recordings Arts and Sciences, is aiming to add weight to the ceremony, which over the years has come under fire for hewing too closely to the music industry’s commercial priorities. Grammy organizers already have undertaken an effort to create a historic feel for the event, including the broadcast of a two-hour special on CBS last week, “My Night at the Grammys,” spotlighting past performances, and the creation of a seven-CD series collecting Grammy-winning songs from the major genre fields.\n\nThough the academy did not disclose who might be performing on the broadcast, critics expect it to use the 50th anniversary as a rationale to enlist any number of high-wattage past Grammy stars. Such drawing power might be pivotal if the academy hopes to sustain its recent ratings rebound and attract mainstream viewers who might otherwise find some of this year’s top nominees too obscure. After a weak showing two years ago, according to Nielsen Media Research, the Grammy broadcast jumped roughly 18 percent in last year’s ratings, drawing an estimated 20 million people."
