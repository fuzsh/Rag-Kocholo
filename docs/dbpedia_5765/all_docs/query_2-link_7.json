        "text": "It was an iconic Grammy telecast moment when, during the 50th annual event, Tony Bennett announced Amy Winehouse as the winner of Record of the Year for her hit “Rehab.” Her shocked look at achieving the honor, as well as her receiving it from the legendary crooner, made the moment pure Grammy magic. That was a landmark night for Winehouse, who won five out of her six nominations, among them three general field awards (also including Song of the Year for “Rehab” and Best New Artist). So how did the British singer go from a young jazz enthusiast to a five-time Grammy winner in the span of a few short years?\n\nSome may think Winehouse’s international breakthrough “Back to Black” from 2006 was her first album, but it was actually “Frank” in 2003. That record gained Winehouse a lot of hype, earning her a Mercury Prize nomination, a couple of Brit Award nominations and an Ivor Novello Award win — very prestigious honors in the United Kingdom. However, the record didn’t produce any breakout hits, perhaps being a bit too jazzy for the mainstream. Winehouse’s second album, “Back to Black,” would be the one to change that. Its lead single, the aforementioned “Rehab,” was a massive hit worldwide, peaking inside the top 10 on the American and British charts. The song and album stood out due to their soulful sound, which would later distinguish other UK singers like Duffy and Adele. It also stood out from other hits of the moment, which were largely bubblegum pop or urban-leaning.\n\nAs such, it was no surprise that Winehouse got major Grammy noms, but wins were never guaranteed. Rihanna and Jay-Z’s blockbuster single “Umbrella,” 2007’s second biggest hit, could have won, mostly due to its fusion of R&B and pop with hip-hop. Another big contender was Beyoncé’s “Irreplaceable”, the number-one hit of the year. But no one had quite the appeal that Winehouse had: a jazz singer at heart making pop-accessible records and achieving international success in the process.\n\nHowever, the topic of Winehouse’s substance abuse did come up a few times. Slant Magazine correctly predicted her for Record of the Year, but hesitated to call her a shoo-in, stating that “there’s no way of knowing how much [Winehouse’s] attempt to out-train-wreck Britney [Spears] has alienated conservative older voters.” Similarly, Alec Harvey for AL.com stated that “the singer’s personal troubles have gotten in the way of her talent too much of late.” Voters could’ve thought that the artist was too troubled, or that voting for “Rehab” would glorify her drug problem. Or perhaps voters felt the opposite way: that it would give a unique talent even more recognition and hopefully help her out of her struggles. Recording Academy members could also have looked at “Rehab” as a satirical song rather than just a bleak, autobiographical statement of intent.\n\nUltimately, “Rehab” and Winehouse herself had everything Grammy voters love: retro influence, real instrumentation, catchy melodies and lyrical depth, all carried by a unique persona and standing out from the hits of the current zeitgeist. It makes all the sense in the world that she was so embraced by the academy. Little did they know, unfortunately, that it would be one of their only chances to award one of the most revolutionary figures to grace pop music. She died of alcohol poisoning in 2011 when she was just 27. But her legacy is still felt to this day. Long live Amy.\n\nMake your predictions at Gold Derby now.
