        "text": "Summary of Character[]\n\nAmy Jade Winehouse (14 September 1983 – 23 July 2011) was an English singer-songwriter known for her powerful deep contralto vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres including R&B, soul and jazz. Winehouse's 2003 debut album, Frank, was critically successful in the UK and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. Her 2006 follow-up album, Back to Black, led to six Grammy Award nominations and five wins, tying the then record for the most wins by a female artist in a single night, and made Winehouse the first British female to win five Grammys, including three of the \"Big Four\": Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nIn 2007 she won a BRIT Award for Best British Female Artist; she had also been nominated for Best British Album. She won the Ivor Novello Award three times: once in 2004 for Best Contemporary Song (musically and lyrically) for \"Stronger Than Me\", once in 2007 for Best Contemporary Song for \"Rehab\", and once in 2008 for Best Song Musically and Lyrically for \"Love Is a Losing Game\".\n\nWinehouse died of alcohol poisoning on 23 July 2011. Her album Back to Black subsequently became the UK's best selling album so far of the 21st century.\n\nFor more information about here, visit here.\n\nAppearances in MAD[]\n\nSeason 1[]"
