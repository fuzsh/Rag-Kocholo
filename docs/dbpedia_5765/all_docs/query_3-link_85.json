        "text": "On this day in 2007, Amy Winehouse, Madonna, and Arctic Monkeys were among the winners of Ivor Novello Awards. Winehouse won the Best Contemporary Song for her hit “Rehab”. The following year, “Rehab” won Song Of The Year at Grammy Awards.\n\n“Rehab” was released in 2006 as the lead single from Winehouse’s second studiio album, Back to Black.\n\nThe inspiration behind “Rehab” stems from Winehouse’s real-life experiences and struggles with substance abuse. The lyrics reflect her defiant and rebellious attitude towards seeking help for addiction. The song delves into the conflict between Winehouse’s own desire to continue her destructive habits and the pressure she felt from those around her to enter a rehabilitation program.\n\n“Rehab” gained widespread attention and critical acclaim for its catchy melody, soulful vocals, and the raw honesty of Winehouse’s lyrics. The song showcases her unique blend of jazz, soul, and R&B influences, which became signature elements of her musical style.\n\nThe success of “Rehab” propelled Amy Winehouse to international stardom, earning her numerous accolades and awards. However, the song also became somewhat synonymous with her personal struggles and publicised battles with addiction.\n\nA few years later, in 2011, Amy Winehouse’s died from accidental alcohol poisoning when she resumed drinking after a period of abstinence. It is believed that her last words were: “I don’t want to die.”\n\n💧 You might also like ALISON MOYET: SITUATION 61.\n\n⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯"
