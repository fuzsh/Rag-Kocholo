        "text": "Amy Winehouse‘s parents have accepted a BRIT Billion Award on the late singer’s behalf to mark one billion streams in the UK.\n\nAccepting the award, Mitch and Janis said: “We of course wish that Amy was here today accepting this award in person, but it’s amazing that she is still winning awards for her incredible talent and achievements.\n\n“It’s wonderful that her music is being discovered by new audiences of young people who love it just as much as her contemporaries. We are so proud of Amy. Thank you.”\n\nWinehouse follows the likes of ABBA, Queen and The Rolling Stones in being given the award, alongside the likes of RAYE, AJ Tracey, Lewis Capaldi and Billie Eilish.\n\nThe new award comes shortly after the release of Back to Black, the new Amy Winehouse biopic starring Marisa Abela as the singer.\n\nReviewing the film, Rolling Stone UK said: “Back to Black won’t please everybody, but it is a good, well-made film that tells part of Amy’s story with affection, sensitivity and a palpable respect for her talent.”"
