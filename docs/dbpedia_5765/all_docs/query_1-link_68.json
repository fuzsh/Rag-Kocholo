        "text": "Superstars in waiting\n\nMultiplatinum artists, multiple judges on The Voice, indie darlings, a master jazz improvisationalist, and even an EGOT winner all started their careers with one important Grammy win: Best New Artist. No matter the talent, the winners in this category have had wildly different careers. See every Best New Artist winner from 1990 through 2021 and where they are now, ahead.\n\n1990: Milli Vanilli (revoked in 1990)\n\nWho they beat: Neneh Cherry, Indigo Girls, Tone Lōc, and Soul II Soul\n\nTechnically, there was no winner of Best New Artist in 1990 since the Recording Academy, in an unprecedented move, rescinded the award given to Milli Vanilli's Fab Morvan and Rob Piltaus once it was revealed the duo was lip-syncing for their lives.\n\nMorvan and Pilatus tried to rehabilitate their tarnished reputation with a comeback album, but that was derailed when Pilatus died of an accidental drug overdose in 1998. Morvan has kept busy as a session musician and DJ, trying his hand at a solo career.\n\nA biopic about the duo, Girl You Know It's True, is expected to be released in 2023.\n\n1991: Mariah Carey\n\nWho she beat: The Black Crowes, the Kentucky Headhunters, Lisa Stansfield, Wilson Phillips\n\nSince winning Best New Artist, Mariah Carey has gone on to become one of the most consistent and successful hitmakers of her (or any) generation.\n\nIn 2019, the elusive chanteuse garnered her 19th No. 1 hit, the most by a solo artist, and second only to the Beatles. In addition to a slew of other awards and accolades, Carey has five Grammys and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2020. Her enduring holiday song \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" surpassed 1 billion streams on Spotify in 2021.\n\n1992: Marc Cohn\n\nWho he beat: Boyz II Men, C+C Music Factory, Color Me Badd, and Seal\n\nBest known for \"Walking in Memphis,\" Marc Cohn was never able to replicate the success of his breakthrough single and eponymous debut album.\n\nCohn recorded steadily throughout the '90s and the '00s, releasing four more albums. In 2005, he survived an attempted carjacking in which he was shot in the head. Cohn, a Cleveland-born artist, popped up in an SNL musical sketch in 2021 with Pete Davidson and Method Man extolling the virtues of Staten Island.\n\n1993: Arrested Development\n\nWho they beat: Billy Ray Cyrus, Sophie B. Hawkins, Kris Kross, and Jon Secada\n\nThe first hip-hop act to win Best New Artist, Arrested Development's brand of socially conscious rap was a response to the gangsta rap that dominated the 1980s and early-1990s. Their debut album, 3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of… was a critically acclaimed, multiplatinum success, but their 1994 follow-up, while also garnering strong reviews, didn't perform nearly as well, leading the group to break up in 1996.\n\nHowever, though their lineup has changed over the years, AD continues to record and tour with original cofounder Speech still fronting the group.\n\n1994: Toni Braxton\n\nWho she beat: Belly, Blind Melon, Digable Planets, and SWV\n\nFollowing the success of her self-titled debut album, which earned her three Grammys including Best New Artist, Toni Braxton released the even more successful Secrets in 1996, winning another two Grammys in the process.\n\nAfter a much-publicized bankruptcy filing, Braxton came roaring back with The Heat, and another Grammy, in 2001. Braxton filed for bankruptcy again in 2010. But, since then, the songstress has rebounded. She has a total of seven Grammys, has recorded and toured regularly, and even been on Broadway. She also ventured into reality television with her sisters, in addition to competing on Dancing With the Stars and The Masked Singer.\n\n1995: Sheryl Crow\n\nWho she beat: Ace of Base, Counting Crows, Crash Test Dummies, and Green Day\n\nSheryl Crow had sung backup for a number of artists including Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder before hitting it big with her debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club, and her breakout hit \"All I Wanna Do.\"\n\nAfter her initial Grammy success, Crow has gone on to earn a total of 32 nominations so far, winning nine over her lengthy career. In 2019, Crow released what she teased might be her final, full-length album, Threads, a collection of duets, to instead focus on releasing singles and EPs. She was the subject of a 2022 Showtime documentary, Sheryl.\n\n1996: Hootie & the Blowfish\n\nWho they beat: Brandy, Alanis Morissette, Joan Osborne, and Shania Twain\n\nIn a field of women from a myriad of genres, Hootie & the Blowfish took home Best New Artist, despite fellow nominee Alanis Morissette winning Album of the Year. Thus was the power and influence of the Blowfish, whose debut, Cracked Rear View, became one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nThat kind of runaway success is nearly impossible to replicate, as the band found out with their subsequent albums. Hootie himself, Darius Rucker, launched a successful solo country music career, winning a Grammy of his own in 2013 for his single \"Wagon Wheel.\"\n\nRucker reunited with the Blowfish for their sixth album, Imperfect Circle, in 2019.\n\n1997: LeAnn Rimes\n\nWho she beat: Garbage, Jewel, No Doubt, and the Tony Rich Project\n\nAt 14, LeAnn Rimes became the youngest solo Grammy winner ever, as well as the first country musician to win Best New Artist. Despite this impressive feat, Rimes had actually released her debut album three years prior. After her Grammy win in 1997, she experienced pop success with her rendition of \"How Do I Live.\"\n\nOver the years, Rimes would flirt with pop while remaining faithful to her country roots, releasing a stream of albums, including God's Work in 2022. Meanwhile, in 2020, Rimes won the fourth season of The Masked Singer.\n\n1998: Paula Cole\n\nWho she beat: Fiona Apple, Erykah Badu, Hanson, and Puff Daddy\n\nThough fellow nominees Fiona Apple and Erykah Badu have gone on to long, critically-acclaimed careers, Paula Cole's \"I Don't Want to Wait\" has been ingrained in pop culture thanks to its use as millennial touchstone Dawson's Creek's theme song. It was Cole's \"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?,\" however, that earned her three Grammy noms, including Record of the Year.\n\nCole's follow-up album, 1999's Amen, under the moniker \"The Paula Cole Band,\" was too much of a stylistic departure for fans and was met with mixed reviews by critics. Still, Cole has recorded steadily over the years, releasing seven additional albums since Amen, her most recent being 2021's American Quilt.\n\n1999: Lauryn Hill\n\nWho she beat: Backstreet Boys, Andrea Bocelli, the Chicks (previously known as the Dixie Chicks), and Natalie Imbruglia\n\nThe 41st Grammys was really Lauryn Hill's night, not only winning Best New Artist but taking away a then-record five trophies in total, including Album of the Year for her landmark The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, a first for a hip-hop album.\n\nFollowing a court battle and subsequent settlement over that album's credits, however, Ms. Hill shied away from the spotlight, never recording a follow-up to her masterpiece, save for an MTV Unplugged double album and the occasional single. She continues to perform and occasionally reunites with her fellow Fugees, Wyclef Jean and Pras Michel.\n\n2000: Christina Aguilera\n\nWho she beat: Macy Gray, Kid Rock, Britney Spears, and Susan Tedeschi\n\nChristina Aguilera, after famously beating out fellow Mickey Mouse Club castmate Britney Spears for the Grammy, showed a knack for evolution. She would go through a dirty era, a pinup era, and a bionic era before becoming a longtime judge on the reality show competition The Voice.\n\nAfter releasing a new album in 2018, Aguilera had a Las Vegas residency at the Planet Hollywood resort and casino.
