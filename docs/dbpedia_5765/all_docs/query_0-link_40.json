        "text": "Amy Winehouse has posthumously received a BRIT Billion Award celebrating one billion streams in the U.K.\n\nHer parents, Mitch and Janis, accepted the award, saying, “We of course wish that Amy was here today accepting this award in person, but it’s amazing that she is still winning awards for her incredible talent and achievements. It’s wonderful that her music is being discovered by new audiences of young people who love it just as much as her contemporaries. We are so proud of Amy. Thank you.”\n\nThe award was presented following the U.K. release of the biopic Back to Black. Sam Taylor-Johnson directed the film, which stars Marisa Abela as the gifted but troubled singer who died in July 2011 at age 27. The film is due for release in the U.S. on May 17.\n\nReleased in October 2006, “Back to Black” is Winehouse’s most streamed song in the U.K., with more than 150 million streams. It is followed closely by “Valerie,” with more than 135 million streams in the U.K. “Tears Dry on Their Own,” “Rehab,” “You Know I’m No Good” and “Love Is a Losing Game” — all taken from Winehouse’s sophomore album Back to Black — each stand at more than 50 million U.K. streams.\n\nMore than 25 artists have been recognized with a BRIT Billion award since the program launched in 2023, including global icons such as The Rolling Stones, Queen, ABBA and Whitney Houston, pioneering rap and hip-hop artists including AJ Tracey and Headie One and chart-dominating pop artists and singer-songwriters, with the likes of Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Lewis Capaldi and BRIT Award record-breaker Raye all having received the award.\n\nThe BRIT Billion award reflects the extent to which streaming has transformed the music landscape over the past decade. BPI, which administers the BRIT Billion award program, reports that more than 85% of the U.K.’s recorded music consumption now occurs through streaming. In 2023 there were a record 180 billion audio streams in the U.K. In the U.K., more than 2,000 artists now annually amass at least 10 million audio streams of their music, while more than 10,000 artists are streamed more than a million times.\n\nThough Winehouse released just two albums in her lifetime, she made an indelible mark on the global pop scene. She won six Grammy Awards, including best pop vocal album for Back to Black, which reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200. She also won record and song of the year for “Rehab,” which was a No. 9 hit on the Billboard Hot 100."
