        "text": "Amy Winehouse may have been physically absent from the Grammy awards on Sunday, but her presence was strong as the famously troubled singer won several awards early in the ceremony, including song of the year for her autobiographical hit \"Rehab.\"\n\nKanye West, who had a leading eight nominations, also won several awards, including best rap album for \"Graduation,\" best solo performance for \"Stronger,\" best rap song for \"Good Life\" and best rap performance by a duo or group for his collaboration with Common on \"Southside.\"\n\nThe awards presentations continued late Sunday.\n\nWest delivered an electric, glow-in-the-dark rendition of \"Stronger,\" then segued into a stirring tribute to his mother, Donda West, who died unexpectedly last year at age 58.\n\n\"Last night I saw you in my dreams, and now I can't wait to go to sleep,\" sang West, as he started into \"Hey Mama,\" a celebratory tune from his second album that has now turned into a somber ode.\n\nWhen West accepted the best rap album trophy, the orchestra was trying to play him off the stage when he began speaking about his mother.\n\n\"It would be in good taste to stop the music,\" West said -- and the music stopped.\n\n\"I know you're really proud of me right now and I know you want me to be the No. 1 artist in the world, and Mama, all I'm going to do is keep making you proud,\" West said.\n\nThe Grammys, celebrating its 50th year, emphasized its history with its very first performance. Alicia Keys, glammed-up with a '50s style, sat at the piano and sang \"Learnin' the Blues\" along with a black-and-white video performance from the late legend Frank Sinatra.\n\nLater, the cast from Cirque Du Soleil's \"Love\" Beatles' show and the cast of the Beatles-inspired movie \"Across the Universe\" paid tribute to the Fab Four as Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono and George Harrison's widow Olivia Harrison watched from the audience.\n\nTina Turner teamed up with Beyonce on \"Proud Mary.\"\n\nCarrie Underwood was an early performer with her revenge anthem, \"Before He Cheats,\" which earned two Grammys, including for best female country vocal performance.\n\nBruce Springsteen took three pre-show Grammys, including best rock song for \"Radio Nowhere.\"\n\nIn any other year, West would have been the main storyline thanks to his history of awards-show tirades, his huge album \"Graduation\" and the shocking death of his mother.\n\nBut the absent Winehouse, up for six trophies, threatened to upstage West and everyone else.\n\nThe 24-year-old singer-songwriter's personal life has fallen apart over the past year as her career blossomed. As the ceremony approached, suspense built over whether she would appear. She was rejected Thursday for a U.S. work visa, and Grammy producers arranged for her to perform via telecast. Soon afterward, the U.S. government reversed itself and approved Winehouse, but it was too late for her to make the cross-continental trek."
