        "text": "Amy Winehouse has won another posthumous award after the film about her life was given the Grammy for best music film.\n\nThe singer, whose biopic Amy won a Bafta on Sunday for best documentary, was awarded the Grammy in Los Angeles on Monday night.\n\nThe film about the north London musician, who died in 2011 aged 27, has also been nominated for the Academy Award for best documentary feature. The ceremony will take place on February 28 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nThe win is Winehouse's second posthumous Grammy; she shared the award for best pop duo/group performance with Tony Bennett in 2012 for the song Body & Soul.\n\nIn 2008 she won five Grammys: best new artist, song of the year, best female pop vocal performance, best pop vocal album and record of the year.\n\nAmy Winehouse's producer and Jewish DJ Mark Ronson took home two Grammys after his track “Uptown Funk” - sung by US star Bruno Mars - added the record of the year and best group performance trophies to his British single of the year honour at the BRIT Awards.\n\nAmy, which includes never-before-seen footage of the Back To Black singer and interviews with close friends and family, was trongly criticised by Mitch Winehouse , Amy’s father.\n\nHe claimed that director Asif Kapadia misrepresented his relationship with his daughter and picked episodes from her life to suit his own agenda.\n\nThe singer's former manager, Nick Shymansky, rejected Mr Winehouse's criticism. The film was \"a totally accurate representation of what happened,\" he said."
