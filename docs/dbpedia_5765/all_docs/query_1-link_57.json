        "text": "The Grammy nominations are in: Kanye West leads the pack with eight nods, and Amy Winehouse has six; the Foo Fighters, Jay-Z, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and T-Pain are all up for five awards. Among the surprises: Bruce Springsteen scored four nominations, but isn’t up for the major album and song honors, Mark Ronson grabbed a nom for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical (where he’ll face off against Timbaland) and New Orleans-based singer Ledisi — a jazz/R&B vocalist so unknown that announcer Dave Grohl didn’t know how to pronouce her name — will compete in the Best New Artist category.\n\n“I’m honored to have my music recognized with these nominations,” Winehouse tells Usmagazine.com exclusively. “This is a true validation from people I respect and admire.” UGK received a nomination for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group just days after the death of Pimp C; the second half of the duo, Bun B, says, “While this nomination is bittersweet to say the least, I am thankful for the acknowledgment, and as this was a lifelong dream for Chad, it warms my heart to know that he has finally gotten the recognition from the powers that be that his talent, passion and relentless drive for music so rightfully deserved.” (To check out our instant predications for who will — and who should win — the top thirteen categories, click here.)\n\nFergie, Grohl and Taylor Hawkins from Foo Fighters, Akon, Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda, Herbie Hancock, Taylor Swift, George Lopez, Vince Gill and Jimmy Jam announced the major nominations today in Los Angeles; these awards will mark the 50th Annual Grammys, and will take place at Los Angeles’ Staples Center on February 10th and air on CBS.Album of the Year\n\nFoo Fighters, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\n\nVince Gill, These Days\n\nHerbie Hancock, River: The Joni Letters\n\nKanye West, Graduation\n\nAmy Winehouse, Back to Black\n\nRecord of the Year\n\nBeyoncé, “Irreplaceable”\n\nFoo Fighters, “The Pretender”\n\nRihanna feat.
