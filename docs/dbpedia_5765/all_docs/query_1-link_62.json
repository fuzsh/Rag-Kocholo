        "text": "Amy Winehouse was this year's Grammy darling. But the Mormon Tabernacle Choir didn't fare so well.\n\nSinger/songwriter Winehouse was nominated for six Grammy Awards and took home five, including Best New Artist, Song of the Year and Record of the Year during the 50th Grammy Awards Sunday night.\n\nAlthough Winehouse wasn't allowed to leave her native London to attend the event in Los Angeles' Staples Center — due to her visa problems stemming from her struggles with substance abuse — she was able to perform a medley of \"You Know I'm No Good\" and \"Rehab\" during the awards via satellite from London. The ceremony was aired on CBS.\n\nIn a Grammy Award ceremony earlier Sunday that was not aired, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir lost out in both of its nominations of Classical Crossover and Best Engineered Album, Classical.\n\nInstead, The Turtle Island Quartet's \"A Love Supreme: The Legacy of John Coltrane\" took home the classical crossover trophy and engineer John Newton's work on the Phoenix Bach Choir & the Kansas City Chorale release of \"Gerchaninov: Passion Wee\" was favored over Bruce Leek, Fred Volger and Trent Walker's engineering on the MTC's \"Spirit of the Season.\"\n\nIn that earlier ceremony, the Best Classical Album award went to The Nashville Symphony's \"Tower: Made in America,\" Leonard Slatkin, conductor.\n\nDuring the aired segments, Winehouse's streak began when Cyndi Lauper and Miley Cyrus announced Winehouse as Best New Artist during the aired segment Sunday night.\n\nWinehouse's song, ironically titled \"Rehab\" was named Song of the Year and also snagged the Record of the Year title.\n\n\"Rehab\" also won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance earlier in the day and Winehouse's album \"Back to Black\" was named Best Pop Vocal Album.\n\nWinehouse's producer, Mark Ronson, who also produced music by Lily Allen, was named Producer of the Year.\n\nBreaking Winehouse's Grammy streak was Herbie Hancock's win for Album of the Year for \"River: The Joni Letters.\"\n\n\"What a beautiful day this is in Los Angeles,\" said a stunned Hancock. \"It's been 43 years since a jazz artist got the Album of the Year award and I'd like to thank the Academy to courageously break the mold this time. This is a new day that proves the impossible remains possible.\"\n\nThis year's lifetime Achievement Awards went to The Band, Burt Bacharach, Doris Day, jazz pioneer Cab Calloway, bluegrass pioneer Earl Scruggs, violinist Itzahk Perlman and jazz drummer Max Roach.\n\nWhile the awards were the basis of the show, the performances gave the program some life.\n\nOne of the more spirited selections was a gospel music tribute featuring Aretha Franklin, BeBe Winans, Madison Bumblebee, the Clark Sisters and Trinity 5-7.\n\nOther performances included Female R&B Singer winner Alicia Keys performing \"Learning the Blues,\" as a digital duet with the late Frank Sinatra. Keys also sang her solo on her Grammy winning \"No One,\" Carrie Underwood sang the Best Country Song \"Before He Cheats\" and John Fogerty, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis cranked out \"Coming' Down the Road,\" \"Great Balls of Fire\" and \"Good Golly Miss Molly.\"\n\nBeyonce and Tina Turner strutted out \"Proud Mary.\" Dave Koz, Kid Rock and Keely Smith grooved it out with \"That Old Black Magic,\" and Lang Lang and Herbie Hancock took on George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"\n\nThe Recording Academy's Chairman James \"Jimmy Jam\" Harris joined with Morris Day and Terry Lewis for The Time reunion performance of \"Jungle Love,\" which was then segued into an appearance from Rihanna doing \"Umbrella\" and \"Don't Stop the Music.\"\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas' Fergie took on a dynamic version of \"Finally\" accompanied only by piano played by John Legend, before presenting the Grammy for Best Compilation Soundtrack to Sir George Martin and his son, Gilles, and Ringo Starr for their work on \"Love (The Beatles).\"\n\nOne of the more poignant moments of the event came when Kanye West, who won Best Rap Album for \"Graduation,\" took the audience on a black-light hip-hop trip with mix-duo Daft Punk during \"Stronger\" and an emotional \"Hey Mama,\" as a tribute to his mother Dr. Donda West who died earlier this year."
