I didn't even have time to get drunk _ I've only been here about 15 minutes,\" said the 23-year-old singer, who is known for her high-voltage personality and reputation for heavy drinking and smoking.\n\nWinehouse, who recently married boyfriend Blake Fielder-Civil, said it was sudden, \"but that's the way I am.\"\n\n\"I had a lovely dress and he looked very handsome,\" she said. \"We're not planning a honeymoon, every day is a honeymoon _ I've married the best man in the world.\"\n\n\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\" by the Arctic Monkeys was named best album and \"Elusive\" by Scott Matthews won for best song.\n\nOther winners include: \"Sorry,\" by Madonna and Stuart Price, international hit of the year; and \"I Don't Feel Like Dancin',\" by Elton John, Scott Hoffman and Jason Sellards, which was covered recently by the Scissor Sisters, most performed work.\n\nThe Feeling received the songwriter of the year award and Peter Gabriel was honored for lifetime achievement.\n\nThe awards are presented by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters. They are named for early 20th-century musician and songwriter Ivor Novello, who composed hits including \"Keep the Home-Fires Burning\" and \"We'll Gather Lilacs.\"\n\n___\n\nOn the Net:\n\nIvor Novello Awards:"
