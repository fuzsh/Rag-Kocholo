        "text": "LOS ANGELES\n\nTHE biggest question hovering over Sunday’s Grammy Awards was answered yesterday when it was announced that Amy Winehouse, the troubled British pop star and tabloid fixture, would not be able to attend. Ms. Winehouse, who was expected to be the dominant figure at the 50th annual awards ceremony, has been denied a visa to enter the United States.\n\nGrammy producers said, however, that they planned for Ms. Winehouse, who had recently entered a rehabilitation clinic, to appear, probably via satellite, during the program, which will be televised live from the Staples Center here at 8 p.m. Eastern time on CBS.\n\n“You will see Amy Winehouse on the Grammys,” said Ken Ehrlich, the longtime producer of the show. “I’m very happy.”\n\nMs. Winehouse’s music and image are a bridge between 1960s girl-group pop and modern-day hip-hop, and her addition to the show’s lineup would fill a stylistic void as Grammy organizers strain to honor 50 years of musical history while staking a claim to post- MySpace relevance. But there may be some awkward moments if Ms. Winehouse, who has six nominations  for her album “Back to Black” (Universal), her self-referential single “Rehab” and herself, as best new artist  is a big winner. Only Kanye West has more nominations.\n\nIn announcing that Ms. Winehouse’s efforts to obtain a visa had been rejected by the United States Embassy in London, a statement released by her British publicity company, the Outside Organization, said, “Amy has been progressing well since entering a rehabilitation clinic two weeks ago and although disappointed with the decision has accepted the ruling and will be concentrating on her recovery.”\n\nThis is not the first time visa troubles have derailed a planned television appearance by an emerging British star. The pop singer Lily Allen sought entry to the United States last August to perform at the MTV Video Music Awards, but American immigration officials revoked her visa. The official reason was never disclosed, but her manager said it might have been tied to a squabble with photographers in London after which she was detained by the police.\n\nLast-minute Grammy production changes continued even as advance promotion for the event intensified, with the takeoff on Thursday morning of a Grammy-branded 757 jetliner for Los Angeles carrying contest winners who watched John Legend perform an in-flight concert.\n\nThe 50th year represents a considerable milestone for the Grammy Awards, which have survived derision from critics who continue to ridicule the program for favoring best-sellers over trail-blazing works by less mainstream artists. This year’s nominations in the major categories reflected a tilt toward eclecticism  in particular Herbie Hancock and Vince Gill’s unexpected nominations for album of the year  if not innovation. Still, some say Grammy show producers have not done enough to highlight the vast array of genres in which trophies are handed out in the hours before the television broadcast begins.\n\nMr. Ehrlich said he faced an added challenge this year, in that the nominees in the major categories did not necessarily intersect with the roster of the last few decades’ most well-known stars. (Bruce Springsteen’s album “Magic” had been seen as a likely album of the year contender but failed to draw a nomination.)\n\n“Even 5 or 10 years ago there were 15 or 20 names that were universal,” Mr. Ehrlich said. Today, he added, “there are a great number of extremely popular acts, great live acts, but I don’t know that we have that same number of what we used to call one-name acts.”\n\nNonetheless performances already booked offer a sign of the Recording Academy’s aim to span history, while minding the show’s ratings, which surged 18 percent last year. In a late addition to the list, Grammy organizers said that Josh Groban, the pop-opera crooner whose Christmas CD, “Noel,” was last year’s top-selling album, would sing a duet with Andrea Bocelli.\n\nRihanna, the Barbadian pop singer who had one of the year’s biggest hit singles with “Umbrella,” will perform with the reunited 1980s funk act the Time. Beyoncé, whose smash “Irreplaceable” is competing for record of the year, is scheduled to perform with Tina Turner. Another radio mainstay, the Foo Fighters, will perform their recent hit song “The Pretender” in a segment with an orchestra featuring winners of a contest held on YouTube.\n\nBut beyond the expected performances of radio hits from the past year the lineup is thick with tributes to the past. For example there will be an elaborate Beatles-theme segment, with the casts of “Love,” the Cirque du Soleil show, and “Across the Universe,” the film musical.\n\nThe push to build buzz around the ceremony  and underscore the significance of the Grammys  began well before the lineup solidified. Grammy organizers for the first time in years hired an advertising agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day, to develop a campaign for the 50th-anniversary ceremony. The academy has also rolled out an upmarket fashion line, with belts, jackets and other apparel, that will be sold at boutique retail stores.\n\nThe clothing line and other recent promotions reflect “a watershed moment for us,” said Evan Greene, chief marketing officer for the academy. “It’s really a tremendous opportunity for us to sort of direct how our brand is perceived moving forward. Where brands get themselves in trouble, especially brands in a leadership position, is where they start to get comfortable.”"
