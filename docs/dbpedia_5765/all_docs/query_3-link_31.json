        "text": "Amy Winehouse was the star of last night's Grammy Awards ceremony, after picking up five gongs including song of the year for her track Rehab.\n\nThe troubled singer also bagged best new artist, best pop album for Back to Black and best female pop vocal.\n\nHowever, the 24-year-old could not travel to the US to accept her awards in person because her visa application was originally turned down. It was later granted but not in time for her to make the ceremony.\n\nInstead she performed You Know I’m No Good and Rehab at a London studio in front of a small audience and via satellite.\n\nWhen she heard she had won record of the year, she looked stunned and turned around to embrace her band. Her father Mitch, who has supported his daughter throughout her troubles, jumped on stage to join her.\n\nFollowing a standing ovation, Amy, whose healthier appearance will have encouraged fans that she is on the mend after her stay in the Capio Nightingale rehab clinic, gave a short speech.\n\nWith her arm around her mother she said: “To my mum and dad. To my Blake, my Blake incarcerated.”\n\nShe also dedicated her glory to Camden – the scene of a ferocious fire at the weekend - which badly damaged her favourite hangout, The Hawley Arms.\n\nWinehouse said: “And this is for London, this is for London, because Camden Town is burning down.”\n\nThe recognition is a sure sign the jazz singer could crack the US market, providing she can stay out of trouble and beat her demons.\n\nOther winners on the night included Kanye West, who took home four Grammys for best rap album for Graduation, best solo rap performance for Stronger, best rap song for Good Life and best rap performance by a group for the collaboration with Common on Southside.\n\nWest paid a tribute to his mother Donda West, who died last year from complications during plastic surgery.\n\nHe said: “Mama, all I’m going to do is keep making you proud. We run this.”\n\nThe Beatles also received a tribute from Tom Hanks and Cirque du Soleil performed The Beatles Love Show.\n\nRingo Starr, Yoko Ono and George Harrison’s widow, Olivia Harrison, were in the audience.\n\nTina Turner made her first appearance on stage in seven years alongside Beyonce Knowles.\n\nAlicia Keys opened the ceremony with Frank Sinatra’s Learnin’ the Blues, while footage of the late singer played behind her."
