        "text": "You can always count on Amy Winehouse to raise the roof - and that's exactly what she did at last nights MOBO awards in London.\n\nThe 24-year-old - who recently vowed never to go back to rehab - scooped the Best UK Female gong and gave a blinding performance of Tears Dry On Their Own.\n\nBut it was the beehived ones backstage shenanigans that have taken all the headlines - namely, her rider. It included a large bottle of vodka, two bottles of champagne, two bottles of Jack Daniels, two bottles of red wine and two cases of 24 Heineken bottles. Phew!\n\nOn the other side of London, Amy also scooped the Best Live Female trophy at the Vodafone Live Music Awards - but sent the landlord of her local, The Hawley Arms in Camden, along to pick it up for her.\n\nThis was a very noticeable problem last night as barely ANY of the prize winners turned up to pick up their awards... Quite possibly the MOBO'S was a more attractive event?\n\nTune in to T4 this weekend between 1-2pm to catch the embarrassment!\n\n20 SEPTEMBER\n\nWhat do you make of Amy's continued success? Let us know in the gossip forum"
