        "text": "Rehab and a visa denial kept her on British shores this weekend, but Amy Winehouse proved distance is no barrier to success after winning five awards at the 50th annual Grammy awards last night.\n\nThe singer thanked her parents and her \"incarcerated\" husband Blake Fielder-Civil, as well as giving a shout out to the borough of Camden, which suffered a devastating fire at the weekend, as she accepted awards that included Song of the Year and Record of the Year for Rehab.\n\nWinehouse, who was nominated for six Grammy awards in total, did perform for the event, via a satellite link-up from London's Riverside Studios. Looking healthy, happy and lucid, the 24-year-old began with a performance of You Know I'm No Good, from her 2006 album Back to Black. There were knowing smiles from the singer as she blazed through her hit song Rehab, having just left an actual rehab centre to perform for the event.\n\nThe rest of the evening's performances included an enthusiastic duet from Beyonce and Tina Turner, both wearing all-in-one silver outfits, of the latter's 1972 Grammy award-winning hit Proud Mary. The 67-year-old kept to tradition by performing a medley, fusing What's Love Got To Do With It with Better Be Good to Me. Kanye West also impressed with neon performances of his songs Stronger and Hey Mama, proving that wearing a jacket replete with flashing LED lights needn't undermine heartfelt sentiment when he dedicated them both to his late mother Donda.\n\nHerbie Hancock was the surprise victor of the evening, winning the coveted Album of the Year award for his Joni Mitchell tribute River: The Joni Letters. \"It's immeasurable how surprised I am,\" the 67-year-old jazz legend told journalists at the event. \"I didn't even hear my name at first, and I was waiting to hear my name, and they said it, and I didn't hear it. And then I heard the word 'River' ... Is this happening?\""
