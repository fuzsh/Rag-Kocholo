        "text": "Post by S. Carter on\n\nAmy took the music industry by storm in late 2006/2007 with the catchy smash hit \"Rehab\". Her album, Back To Black, was both a critical and commercial smash selling 11 million copies and winning a total of 5 Grammy awards. She paved the way for such female artists like Adele and Duffy to break into the American market. Since then her drug/alcohol abuse, turbulent marriage, and volatile behavior began taking the headlines over her music. There's been many examples in music history where artists have come out with their breakthrough album and what looked to be like a promising career only to underperform on their next release and later fade into oblivion. Will Amy be the latest example? Can she pull it off again?\n\nPost by busyboy on\n\nI think she is. Whether she'll go the Macy Gray route (huge album followed by declining success) or the Lauryn Hill one (erratic behaviour etc.) I don't know, but I don't feel she'll ever be as big as during the BTB era.\n\nPost by vinyl on\n\nShe definitely will never be as big as she was (I mean, how many albums sold nearly 10 million copies in the past few years..?) but I'm sure she can somehow manage a few more million sellers.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI assume you're talking about the US, she's had a string of hits in multiple European countries.\n\nIf you are talking about the US, it doesn't really matter. She's had more cultural impact in one hit single and album than most of the pop chart-topping divas that are worshipped on Pulse could dream of over the course of entire careers. Amy will continue to be a strong album seller for the rest of her life regardless of whether she scores big on the CHR/Pop chart ever again.\n\nPost by Nevermind on\n\nIf she gets her sh it together, no - she could potentially pull in huge opening figures for her next album, and if the music is descent enough will continue to sell across an almost universal demographic. And she doesn't need hits, because even the Back To Black singles never faired that well on the charts: all she needs is a good album, and she certainly won't be a one hit wonder. Whether she can manage to get her act together though...\n\nPost by Nevermind on\n\nAdele was always an under the radar critical success, without the big commercial hits, so the only thing that's changed is that she's working on her new album.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nThat's true. My point was that Matt's analogy didn't make any sense (not that I expect him to ever make any sense). For a start, 19, while a hit, was nowhere near as successful as Back To Black, so to expect Amy's success to mirror Adele's is silly. And, as Nevermind pointed out, Adele hasn't even released a follow up album, so even if they were potentially comparable, there's nothing to actually compare.\n\nPost by carriefan0209 on\n\n@backintime said:\n\nThat's true.

You don't make any sense!\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nWhy even bother bringing Adele up then? Especially as, as has been pointed out, artists tend to 'disappear' when they're writing an album. lol\n\nPost by carriefan0209 on\n\n@backintime said:\n\nWhy even bother bringing Adele up then?

Doesn't seem likely.\n\nPost by Live Your Life on\n\nI don't ever see her scoring another Pop hit again, but she will continue to be a steady album seller.\n\nPost by Crazytowel on\n\nDefinately not! Frank was incredible as well and it didn't perform that bad either after Back to Black made it big. Also, no matter what she releases now, shes gained a LOT of fans and a lot of interest so people will buy her new album just to try it out.\n\nPost by carriefan0209 on\n\n@carriefan0209 said:\n\nUm not really...they can still do the television route, awards shows, radio call-ins, etc...\n\nRandomly call into American radio with no material to promote when she's a British artist?

K., but not sure about another one in the U. S. - but guess you never know\n\nPost by ClevelandRox on\n\nThe only song the general public barely knows of hers is Rehab. But I think she could still come back with a big hit on the next album since everyone knows her name now (just not in a good way).\n\nPost by PDC1987 on\n\n@backintime said:\n\nI assume you're talking about the US, she's had a string of hits in multiple European countries.\n\nIf you are talking about the US, it doesn't really matter.

She already has two.\n\nPost by ClevelandRox on\n\nLOL No one in America knows/cares about her first attempt. That's what pissed me off more than anything when she won Best New Artist at the Grammy's. She was hardly new.\n\nPost by PDC1987 on\n\nLOL No one in America knows/cares about her first attempt.

This is why she won Best New Artist."
