        "text": "http://www.pollmonkey.com/s.asp?c=53719538&u=3007745317 DisplayVote45317();\n\nhttp://www.pollmonkey.com/s.asp?c=53719538&u=4060445318 DisplayVote45318();\n\nIt wasn’t unthinkable, given her recent well-publicized troubles, that Amy Winehouse would simply be shut out this year.\n\nBut it was positively unimaginable that the British soul singer would make a clean sweep of the top categories during the Grammy’s 50th anniversary Sunday night at Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the end, she didn’t. The last award of the night, the coveted Grammy for album of the year, went to Herbie Hancock for his collaborative Joni Mitchell tribute, “River: The Joni Letters” – a somewhat safe but also legend-heavy choice for such a prestigious occasion.\n\nYet Winehouse’s haul, including trophies for record and song of the year (both for her prescient smash “Rehab”) and best new artist, was an unexpected and encouraging show of support for the recovering performer, who watched in astonishment via satellite from a London studio as her name was announced as winner of record of the year.\n\nWhat’s more, her two other prizes – for best female pop vocal performance and best pop vocal album, for “Back to Black” – added her to the list of women who share the record for most wins in a single night by a female artist. Winehouse now keeps company with Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, Norah Jones and, if a trio may be counted, Dixie Chicks.\n\nWinehouse was a winner of few words, however, giving her all instead to a powerful, deliciously kittenish performance of the fitting “You Know I’m No Good” and her Grammy-grabbing hit. She thanked her record company, “my mum and dad … for my (husband) Blake (Fielder-Civil), incarcerated. And for London – this is for London!”\n\nShe wasn’t the only performer to make Grammy history, though. Hancock’s album of the year win marks the first time the award has gone to a jazz performer since Stan Getz & Joao Gilberto’s classic “Getz/Gilberto” took the trophy in 1964.\n\n“I’d like to thank the academy for courageously breaking the mold this time,” he said, his acceptance speech falling out of his jacket, “and in doing so honor the giants upon whose shoulders I stand, some of whom – like Miles Davis, John Coltrane – unquestionably deserved this award in the past. But this is a new day that proves that the impossible can be made possible.\n\n“Yes we can, to coin a phrase!”\n\nThe night’s other big winner, racking up another four statuettes, was Kanye West – who can’t have been pleased that Hancock took the top prize. It’s the third time in a row that Grammy voters have denied the hip-hop star an award in one of the top categories, relegating him to the rap field instead, where his nods included best rap solo performance and best rap song (both for “Stronger”), best rap performance by a duo or group (for “Southside,” with Common).\n\nWest certainly thought it was his year to win, though. When his disc “Graduation” predictably won for best rap album, he was his typical immodest self.\n\n“Definitely feels good to be home, here at the Grammys,” said the dude dressed more than ever like Michael Jackson circa “Thriller.” (His performance of “Stronger,” with a surprise appearance from Daft Punk, was another of many telecast highlights.) “We snuck in about four or five years ago, and now we basically made this our new place of residence.”\n\nThen came the swelling music, a cue to wrap it up.\n\n“Cmon, you gonna play music on me?”\n\nThen a wild boast: “For Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse, if I don’t get to get up here for album of the year, you deserve it as much as me. I deserve it, too.”\n\nFellow nominee Vince Gill had choice words in response to that when he took the stage to accept the award for best country album, for his four-disc set “These Days.” Ringo Starr announced his win.\n\n“I just had an award handed to me by a Beatle,” Gill said. “Have you had that happen yet, Kanye?”\n\nBruce Springsteen, who wasn’t in attendance, took home three Grammys – best solo rock vocal performance and best rock song, both for “Radio Nowhere,” plus best rock instrumental performance, for his remake of Ennio Morricone‘s “Once Upon a Time in the West” theme.\n\nHancock’s “River” also nabbed the prize for best contemporary jazz album, which made him one of a handful of acts to take home a pair of Grammys. Also in that group: Foo Fighters (best hard rock performance and best rock album), Alicia Keys (best R&B song and best female R&B vocal performance), Chaka Khan (best R&B album and best R&B vocal performance by a duo or group, with Mary J. Blige), Justin Timberlake (best pop male vocal performance and best dance recording), the White Stripes (best rock vocal performance by a duo or group and best alternative music album) and the soundtrack to Cirque du Soleil’s “LOVE” (best compilation soundtrack, best surround-sound recording).\n\nOther stars who scored a statuette: Carrie Underwood, Prince, Beastie Boys, the Chemical Brothers, Eric Clapton, Eagles, Maroon 5, Ne-Yo, Robert Plant & Alison Krauss, Keith Urban, Slayer, producer of the year Mark Ronson and, garnering his second Grammy, presidential hopeful Barack Obama, who bested his opponent’s husband Bill Clinton for best spoken-word recording.\n\nLifetime achievement awards were given to master songwriter Burt Bacharach, Americana pioneers the Band, jazz drummer Max Roach, violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman, swing legend Cab Calloway, beloved entertainer Doris Day and banjo innovator Earl Scruggs.\n\nYet, despite the evening’s history-making tallies and wins, Grammy’s golden anniversary will surely be remembered more for its performances, which, for a change, were almost uniformly strong.\n\nThe standard was set high early on, after a virtual duet between Alicia Keys and Frank Sinatra, some hearty belting from Underwood on “Before He Cheats” and a lively pairing of Rihanna and the Time, who served up a medley of “Jungle Love” and “Umbrella.” The first hour alone, during which even Fergie sounded sharp, was enough to make this one of the better Grammy telecasts in many years.\n\nBeyoncé‘s sung introduction of Tina Turner was rather lame, as was the enervated start to the Hall of Famer’s three-song performance. But the duo turned the heat up with “Proud Mary” – and from then on out the star turns were increasingly memorable.\n\nFoo Fighters were stormy as usual, performing outside on Chick Hearn Court, between Staples Center and Nokia Theatre. Feist was simply elegant singing “1234.” And Hancock and classical pianist Lang Lang wowed the crowd with a dueling-pianos rendition of Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue.”"
