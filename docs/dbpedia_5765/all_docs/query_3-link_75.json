        "text": "Couldn’t tell how it played inside Staples Center, but Amy Winehouse may be the first person to steal a Grammy telecast without actually being there. She certainly stole the telecast away from several other strong acts. Her performance from a London studio – first a very fitting “You Know I’m No Good,” then a deliciously kittenish and fired-up “Rehab,” with one lyric changed to “I’d rather be at home with my Blake” – was a marvelous reaffirmation of her talent, and so soon after entering the place she insisted she’d never go.\n\nMaking the moment just perfect: a clearly astonished Winehouse then won the Grammy for record of the year, tying her for the title of most wins by a female performer in one night, an honor also held by Lauryn Hill, Alanis Morissette, Alicia Keys, Norah Jones and, if it’s fair to count a trio, Dixie Chicks. If she steals album of the year from Kanye, she’ll have the record all to herself. In any case, she seems suitably stunned at the outpouring of Grammy love.\n\nPictured: Vocalist Amy Winehouse (pictured above performing at Lollapalooza in August) performed via satellite during the 50th Annual Grammy Awards and won record of the year.
