        "text": "Amy Winehouse and mother Janis were seen on a screen\n\nTroubled singer Amy Winehouse has been showered with glory by the prestigious Grammy Awards, winning five prizes - despite being absent from the ceremony.\n\nHer awards included song of the year and record of the year, both for her single Rehab, and best new artist.\n\nBut she was not at the Los Angeles ceremony to collect them due to visa problems. Instead, she performed and made an acceptance speech by satellite.\n\nKanye West scooped four Grammy Awards, while Bruce Springsteen won three.\n\nThe White Stripes, Justin Timberlake, Carrie Underwood and Mary J Blige were among the acts who picked up two awards.\n\n'My Blake incarcerated'\n\nBut the night belonged to Winehouse, whose stunned reaction to winning record of the year, was beamed into the ceremony from a London studio.\n\nThe 24-year-old singer was seen hugging her mother as the crowd in Los Angeles chanted her name.\n\nShe paid tribute to her husband, \"my Blake incarcerated\", who is in custody awaiting trial on charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice and grievous bodily harm.\n\nShe also dedicated the win to London, \"because Camden Town ain't burning down\", a reference to a huge fire in the capital this weekend.\n\nWinehouse, the first Briton to win the Grammy for best new artist since soul singer Sade in 1986, also performed You Know I'm No Good and Rehab.\n\nIn the song of the year category, Rehab saw off competition from singles by Rihanna, Carrie Underwood, the Plain White Ts and Corinne Bailey Rae.\n\nAlicia Keys opened the show with a \"duet\" with Frank Sinatra\n\nRehab was also named record of the year, beating efforts by Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and the Foo Fighters.\n\nHer other accolades were best pop vocal album for Back To Black and best female pop vocal performance for Rehab.\n\nWinehouse will now return to the Capio Nightingale clinic, where she has been treated for the past two weeks to overcome her high-profile drug problems.\n\nThe US embassy initially refused her a visa, then reversed their decision - but it was too late to allow her to travel to the ceremony.\n\nShe had been nominated for six awards, but lost out on the prize for album of the year.\n\nJazz upset\n\nIn a major upset, that went to jazz legend Herbie Hancock for River: The Joni Letters, his tribute to singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell - only the second time a jazz album has triumphed in the 50-year history of the Grammys.\n\n\"I'd like to thank the academy for courageously breaking the mould this time,\" Hancock said.\n\nKanye West led the nominations with eight, and came away with four trophies - for best rap song, best rap album, best rap solo performance and best rap performance by a duo or group.\n\nThe hip-hop star used his acceptance speech for best rap album to pay tribute to his mother Donda, who died in November.\n\nHerbie Hancock took the record of the year prize\n\nBut when the band struck up to try to cut short his speech, he said: \"It would be in good taste to stop the music,\" and the music stopped.\n\n\"I know you're really proud of me right now and I know you want me to be the number one artist in the world,\" he said. \"And mama, all I'm going to do is keep making you proud. We run this.\"\n\nThe show opened with a duet between Alicia Keys and footage of the late Frank Sinatra singing Learnin' the Blues.\n\nTina Turner returned to the stage for the first time in seven years to perform with Beyonce.\n\nSongwriter Burt Bacharach received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement at a separate ceremony on Saturday."
