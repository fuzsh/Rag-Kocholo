Our darling daughter should be here. These are the cards that we’re dealt.”\n\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T-G7u8PuFs[/youtube]\n\nReferring to the tragic death of Whitney Houston earlier in the day, Mitch added: “Long live Whitney Houston, long live Amy Winehouse, Long live Etta James. There’s a beautiful girl band up in heaven.”\n\nThis was Amy’s sixth Grammy Award; “Back to Black” claimed five at the 2008 ceremony."
