        "text": "Amy Winehouse has been nominated for a Brit Award almost five years after her death.\n\nThe star, who was just 27 when she died in 2011, is up against Adele, Florence Welch, Jess Glynne and Laura Marling in the best British female solo artist category.\n\nShe was eligible for nomination at this year’s ceremony thanks to the release of the soundtrack to Amy, a documentary film about her life.\n\nThe album included several unreleased recordings from the Back To Black singer.\n\nAmy’s father Mitch has been very critical of Asif Kapadia’s documentary, which recently received an Oscar nomination, and made it clear that his feelings haven’t changed despite its success.\n\n‘Just heard Amy nominated for Brit for best British female singer,’ he tweeted after the Brit Award noms were announced.\n\n‘We are so proud of you baby. Still hate the film though!’\n\nAmy won the 2007 Brit Award for Best British Female Artist and was nominated in the same category two years after her death for her first posthumous album Lioness: Hidden Treasures.\n\nFellow nominee Adele, who received the award in 2012, is a huge Amy fan and once said that the singer’s 2003 album Frank inspired her to write songs.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n‘If it wasn’t for Amy and Frank, 100 per cent I wouldn’t have picked up a guitar, I wouldn’t have written Daydreamer or Hometown and I wrote Someone Like You on the guitar too, she told i-D magazine.\n\nThis year’s Brit Awards will be hosted by Ant and Dec at London’s O2 Arena on February 24.\n\nMORE : Brit Awards 2016 nominations: The shocks and surprises"
