        "text": "GRAMMY Week 2020 kicked off with a stylish bang on Monday, Jan. 20 at the GRAMMY Museum's grand opening event for their new Amy Winehouse exhibit, \"Beyond Black — The Style of Amy Winehouse.\" The exhibit pays tribute to the six-time GRAMMY Award-winning artist, whose iconic style is still defining fashion today. The free public event, hosted by music journalist Eve Barlow, was fully booked, and the line of supporters began accumulating more than an hour early.\n\nLongtime roommate and close friend of Amy Winehouse, Catriona Gourlay, and Winehouse’s stylist, Naomi Parry, spoke with the Recording Academy before the event about their favorite dresses at the exhibit, how they came to know Winehouse, and the items on display that trigger the most personal memories.\n\n\"Amy and I met at a bar because my friend fancied her friend. We bonded over how we both backcombed our hair,\" Parry recalled with a smile. It wasn’t until later though, that she came on board as Winehouse's stylist. \"Amy already had the sort of rockabilly style. It started before she and I were working together.\" Though hesitant to take any credit, Gourlay, who met Amy through a mutual school friend, was in fact responsible for the rockabilly component of Winehouse's wardrobe.\n\n\"It was actually because of this vintage shop called Rocket in Camden that Catriona used to work at,\" Parry explains. \"All the girls in there had the curls, tattoos, piercings, and little dresses. Amy was quite heavily influenced by them.\" Parry went on to describe how, when she came on board, she took it upon herself to modernize Winehouse's style without sacrificing anything the singer particularly identified with. Parry was responsible for introducing Winehouse to different brands and labels because she felt that that's what worked best with her music. \"I wanted to make it a little more fashion. I didn't want her to be pigeon-holed in that rockabilly look.\"\n\nAmy Winehouse's stylist Naomi Parry, Winehouse's close friend Catriona Gourlay and music journalist Eve Barlow participate in a panel discussion\n\nPhoto by Amanda Edwards/Getty Images\n\nOne dress that stuck out in both Gourlay's and Parry's minds as synonymous with Winehouse arriving at her true style is The Yellow Preen dress, which she wore at the 2007 Brit awards, and was paired with the red, heart-shaped bag that is also on display.\n\nWhen asked which pieces in the exhibit trigger a particular memory, Gourlay responded first. \"We've got some of her Laura Mercier chocolate body cream and her Givenchy Hot Couture perfume, and the combination of things really hits us still. It’s that thing you can't have anymore. Smelling somebody again.\"\n\nFor Parry, the memory-triggering item is one not yet on display. \"There is a dress which will arrive at the exhibit next week, the first one I did the print design for. It’s a dress that’s got two flamingos on it that are in sort of a heart shape.\" Parry explains how this design came to be while sitting in Winehouse's living room with her sketchbook. Deciding the heart shape may be a bit cheesy, she experimented with other flamingo ideas as Amy sat on the sofa opposite. \"I'd [drawn] one of them with its head in the water. I was about to leave and she came over to see what I’d been doing. She was taken aback \"It's got its head in the water — it looks like a brain!'\" So, she changed it back to the heart-shaped flamingos.\n\nShoes and handbags worn by Amy Winehouse\n\nPhoto by Amanda Edwards/Getty Images\n\nAnd it came as no surprise that Winehouse favored the heart-shaped flamingo design, given that the pages of lyrics and notes on display along the exhibition walls were decorated with heart doodles and illustrations of Winehouse's tattoo art. Winehouse, who liked to draw and write by hand, inspired the GRAMMY Museum to invite artists to give event-goers their own Winehouse doodle souvenirs to take home. Throughout the evening, a line wrapped the second-floor exhibits where guests were having caricature portraits done of themselves with Amy Winehouse.\n\nDuring the pre-event panel, Parry and Gourlay shared additional stories and memories related to Winehouse’s fashion choices. \"She was keen to support emerging young designers,\" Naomi recalls, noting that this often presented a problem on the red carpet. \"I would recite the designers' names with her over and over before her events,\" Parry explained, but Winehouse would draw a blank when she was on the red carpet. \"One poor designer…Tina Kalivas, was introduced as 'Tina the Cleaner,'\" Parry shared with a laugh.\n\nWinehouse, who passed away in 2011 at age 27, had only released two albums during her short life. However, rather than dwelling on the darkness surrounding her passing as many Winehouse tributes have in the past, this exhibit celebrates Winehouse's colorful and unique style as well as her groundbreaking impact on both music and fashion history.\n\n\"It wasn’t about how expensive something was, and she didn't mind wearing the same dress two, three, four times.\" Gourlay said. \"It was about what she liked.\"\n\n\"Beyond Black — The Style of Amy Winehouse.\" opens to the public on Jan. 17 and will run through April 13, 2020. For more information, visit the GRAMMY Museum website.\n\nOn a sweltering Saturday evening in the thick of a Southern California heat wave, a crowd of about 100 gathered under the shade of the GRAMMY Museum's Ray Charles Terrace. This year’s GRAMMY Camp marked 20 years of the music industry program, which has been a significant influence on aspiring teen musicians nationwide.\n\nThe Open House event on July 20 capped off a week-long camp where attendees focused on one of seven music tracks, including business, audio engineering, electronic music production, music & media, and songwriting.\n\nCampers donned aquamarine GRAMMY Camp t-shirts, while parents, guardians, and other family members filled the seats. Julie Mutnansky, Director of Education at GRAMMY Museum, was one of the first to take the stage. “This has been an insane week, so many things have happened in the last seven days. Special shoutout to the Village [Studios] for hosting GRAMMY Camp this year,” Mutnansky said, highlighting that everything about to be presented during the event was created in just the past week.\n\nThe evening's MCs were GRAMMY campers Cora Reardon from New Jersey and Maya Ray from Los Angeles, both participants in the music business track. They shared their experiences of the jam-packed week, emphasizing the intense music immersion, the lifelong friendships formed, and the support from knowledgeable faculty, including Mike Garcia, who is in his 15th and final year of running the GRAMMY Camp business track.\n\nWhile the Open House honored parents, mentors, and other supporters, the spotlight was firmly on the teenage GRAMMY campers, who took charge of the event. The business track campers produced the event, wrote the script, and worked behind the scenes to make sure everything ran smoothly. The production quality, featuring strobe lights and other effects, demonstrated the campers' commitment to excellence, living up to the GRAMMY name. The result was a spectacular show, filled with one awesome musical performance after another — all products of the past seven days, and a testament to the collaborative spirit of GRAMMY Camp.\n\nThe band The Spicy Five kicked off the night with an acoustic rock track that got the crowd going. It quickly became clear that both the GRAMMY campers and many adults in the audience, eat, breathe, and live music. One husband was overheard whispering to his wife about how incredible the guitarists and other band members were too.\n\nRead more: 5 Artists Who Graduated From GRAMMY Camp: Chappell Roan, Maren Morris, Blu DeTiger & More\n\nGuitarist Lauren Hunter from Chicago performed, still buzzing from meeting guest artist panelist and former GRAMMY camper, Blue DeTyger earlier in the week. At the start of the camp, GRAMMY campers also heard from guest panelist Maren Morris, who shared her journey from GRAMMY Camp attendee to GRAMMY winner, offering valuable advice on making the most of the opportunity.\n\nAnother highlight was Brooke Murgitroyd, a singer/songwriter from North Carolina who killed it on stage and also showcased her talent in the community by performing a cover of pop musician Lizzy McAlpine on Santa Monica Pier.\n\nThe event included brief interludes for campers focused on production to present their work from the past week. These campers gave mock pitches, demonstrating their readiness to secure their first industry gigs.\n\nPittsburgh’s Aryana Booker-Gamez, part of the songwriting track, delivered two passionate performances, including “Look at Me Now,” which received a standing ovation. Offstage, Booker-Gamez enthusiastically supported her fellow campers, clapping and dancing along with the same fervor she brought to her performances.\n\nIt was clear that many campers formed lifelong friendships and potential future collaborations at GRAMMY Camp. Reflecting on the whirlwind week, Murgitroyd posted on social media: “Grammy Camp 2024 was such a dream!! To my 82 new friends, you are all so talented and taught me so much!”\n\n\"Everything you like was created by a queer person,\" musician and DJ Aluna proclaimed near the end of \"The Power In Pride: A Conversation Honoring The Resilience Of Black Queer Creatives.\" (A seemingly bold statement — until you do some digging.)\n\nDitto a Black person. As the Recording Academy's VP of DEI, Ryan Butler, pointed out, just about every American music genre flows back to that source. \"There is no pop music in America that is not a derivative of the Negro spiritual,\" he said across from Aluna.\n\n\"The queerness has been the innovation in it, but the Black community has been the foundation of it,\" Butler concluded. \"So, I think when you have the foundation and the innovation together, it's worth celebrating 365 days a year.\"\n\nWhen considering those two truths, two more truths emerge. First, without the contributions of Black and queer people, our world — including our musical landscape — would be unrecognizable. Second, to celebrate only in February, for Black History Month — or June, for Pride Month and Black Music Month — would be a grave disservice to both wellsprings of genius. Honoring Black and queer creators, as Butler pointed out, requires the entire calendar year.\n\nThese themes were paramount at \"The Power of Pride,\" a candid conversation at the Live Nation building in Manhattan, just as summer kicked off. Tiffany Briggs Low, the Director of Corporate and Communications at Live Nation, moderated the discussion between Butler, Aluna, and third panelist Bryant K. Von Woodson II, VIP Relations at Chapter 2 Agency and Head of Communications at Queer Capita. Von Woodson II introduced himself as a \"curator of people\" who connects BIPOC folks with crucial opportunities; Butler, as an \"angelic disruptor\"; Briggs-Low called Aluna \"our sister in green\" and \"the curator of the vibes.\"\n\nBriggs-Low kicked off the conversation with a heavy, dual prompt: \"I would love to hear about why you feel it's important for the world to continue celebrating both Pride and Black Music Month, and what does the intersectionality of Black and queer identities mean to each of you?\"\n\n\"I think that theme months each year do serve as a reset,\" Aluna stated, \"and have you looking internally, and looking at what you've done and haven't done, and how you feel. To me, the queer community and the Black community have given so much,\" she continued, \"and my mission is for us to just turn that around — to be giving it back to ourselves. Because there is an abundance of things that we create — and we never stop creating — but we need to be fed, and the well is running dry. And that upsets me.\"\n\nTo Aluna — who is Black, straight, and an ally of the Black queer community — this nourishment comes from \"creat[ing] space\" within these communities, and fostering \"spirituality and deep, deep connection.\"\n\nTo that question, Von Woodson II — who is Black and queer — paraphrased Maya Angelou: \"Between both communities, I stand as one, but I also really acknowledge the 10,000,\" he said referring to the philosophy from Angelou's work that credits the collective experiences of communities and ancestors who came before.\n\n\"I think that's what this month is about,\" he continued. \"Celebrating the 10,000 that got me to be able to sit on this stage, to have this conversation with you, to sit up here with some beautiful Black people, and really speak about our lives and ourselves.\"\n\nButler, who is also Black and queer, calls that intersection \"a superpower.\" Yet the world doesn't always treat it as such — to put it lightly. As Butler related, just last weekend, he entered a function in Malibu, where the host said, \"I'm going to sit you at the table where all the rappers like to sit.\"\n\n\"I don't really give rapper,\" Butler mused dryly. \"You shouldn't be profiled in that type of way, and I definitely experience it in the corporate environment, still. I don't think that it always feels like a safe space.\n\n\"But that's also a litmus test for me,\" he added. \"I know that there are other [people] who may feel this way, and so it also helps me make sure that I'm constantly applying pressure.\"\n\nVon Woodson II expounded on the importance of being his authentic self, in spaces that might stifle that. \"There is no hiding that I am clearly Black, but also queer,\" he said, before showing off his proudly flamboyant style of walking into a room.\n\n\"As I work with my clients, and I work with new people, I think I show up as authentic as I can,\" he continued. \"And I just lay it on them and say, 'You either take it or you don't.'\"\n\nAluna, for her part, highlighted the unfairness of Black artists being pigeonholed as featured artists.\n\n\"If I need to be an example of what's possible for the next generation, they can't just see me as Disclosure featuring Aluna, DJ Snake featuring Aluna, Avicii featuring Aluna, because that gives the message that that's all we're worth,\" she said. \"You can't get booked as an artist in your own right, because they just don't see you as an artist.\n\n\"Managers across the board, bookers, labels — they're just hankering after your essence, your soul,\" Aluna continued. \"But without your Blackness.\"\n\nIn supporting Black and queer communities — which takes a plethora of forms, for all different kinds of people — Butler warned against performative gestures. Aluna decried \"the colonial separation between Blackness and queerness.\"\n\nAnd Butler left the audience with a truth bomb: \"There are going to be times where you are going to have to shield me with your privilege that I don't have.\"\n\nBut for all these heavier-than-heavy topics of identity, justice and belonging, \"The Power In Pride\" felt celebratory and familial. As the conversation wound down, the beats were turned up, and the audience was geared to get out and uphold Black and queer genius and solidarity — 365 days a year.\n\nThe Recording Academy thanks its partners — Live Nation and Queer Capita — for their efforts to make this event possible."
