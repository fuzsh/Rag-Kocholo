        "text": "Trouble pop star Amy Winehouse has put her problems with drugs to one side and emerged victorious at the MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nShe appeared typically shambolic when receiving the award, mumbling “thanks” and not making an acceptance speech, earning some boos from the crowd.\n\nHowever, the 24-year-old later won them over with her performance of hit song Back To Black.\n\nThe singer was a last-minute addition to the bill and represented a coup for the organisers. In September she cancelled an appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards in Las Vegas while she received treatment for her drug addiction.\n\nThe last few months have seen her in hospital with a seizure, in a rehab clinic and involved in several very public arguments with her husband, including being photographed spattered with blood.\n\nPeter Doherty also managed to ignore his recent drug problems as his band Babyshambles performed their latest song, Delivery.\n\nThere had been rumours that Doherty would duet with Winehouse at the ceremony. However, he told reporters, \"We're not doing anything tonight but we will be doing something in the future.\"\n\nBefore the show, Doherty showed off his anti-heroin implant and claimed that he was now a reformed character. \"I've been trying to stay out of trouble. I'm in hibernation,\" he said.\n\nThe star appeared to be on his best behaviour after a judge handed him a suspended jail sentence on Monday for a string of drug and motoring offences. Organisers had feared the worst but said after his rehearsal: \"He was punctual, behaved professionally and was charming to everyone. We were pleasantly surprised.\"\n\nDoherty's ex, supermodel Kate Moss, is now dating another musician, The Kills' Jamie Hince. Unsurprisingly, Doherty seemed reluctant to discuss it.\n\nBesides Winehouse, the only other British winners were Devon rock band Muse, who were voted Best UK & Ireland Act and Best Headliners.\n\nRapper Snoop Dogg hosted the event wearing a pair of lederhosen in tribute to his German hosts.\n\nPresenters included Joss Stone, tennis ace Boris Becker, Chelsea player Didier Drogba, model Lily Cole and Formula One star Lewis Hamilton.\n\nWINNERS\n\nBest Rock Act - 30 Seconds to Mars\n\nBest Urban Act - Rihanna\n\nBand of 2007 - Linkin Park\n\nMost Addictive Track - Girlfriend, Avril Lavigne\n\nAlbum of the Year - Loose, Nelly Furtado\n\nBest International Act - Tokio Hotel\n\nBest Headliner - Muse\n\nSolo Artist of 2007 - Avril Lavigne\n\nArtists' Choice - Amy Winehouse"
