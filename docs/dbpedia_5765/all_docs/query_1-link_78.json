Britney gives them the 'fallen angel' angle, whereas Amy is just has the 'trailer trash' image.\n\nshe can sing (sometimes) but she is about as significant as Pete D.\n\nnot really if you had seen some of the froums in the US some still thought and saw Britney as a trailer trash girl only without the drugs.\n\nAnd Amy can sure sing better than Britney.\n\n0\n\n\"Rehab\" was only released in the US last May - it was released here in Oct 06, meaning that it was only eligable for the Brits 2007.\n\nSummer 2007 was Amy's prime time in the US, when she released a lot of material, making her eligable for the 2008 Grammy's.\n\nDidn't A.W. win a Brit in 2007?\n\nWhy are you just using 'Rehab' as nomination criteria?\n\nShe has released several singles over the last year:\n\n\"You Know I'm No Good\"\n\n\"Back to Black\"\n\n\"Tears Dry on Their Own\"\n\n\"Valerie\"\n\n\"Love Is a Losing Game\"\n\nDidn't A.W. win a Brit in 2007?\n\nThat doesn't make any difference.\n\nArctic Monkeys did. Muse did. They both got nominated for the same categories this year as they did last year.\n\n0\n\nWhy are you just using 'Rehab' as nomination criteria?\n\nShe has released several singles over the last year:\n\n\"You Know I'm No Good\"\n\n\"Back to Black\"\n\n\"Tears Dry on Their Own\"\n\n\"Valerie\"\n\n\"Love Is a Losing Game\"\n\nThat doesn't make any difference.\n\nArctic Monkeys did. Muse did. They both got nominated for the same categories this year as they did last year.\n\nI agree. Amy Winehouse released several singles last year which charted and her album still remains high in the charts today. I find it really strange that she wasn't at least in the category for Best British Female.\n\n0\n\nShe won last year for Back to Black - in the Best British Female category so why would they nominate her again for the same material?\n\nI don't understand why you all don't understand this\n\n0\n\nShe's spent much of the past year in and out of rehab, so I suppose they can't nominate her for the sake of it.\n\nJust because she's a \"tortured soul\" doesn't instantly make her eligible for all the awards.\n\n0\n\nJust to remind people, she WAS nominated for Best British Single. (It may have officially been Mark Ronson, but I'm sure she'd get just as much credit for it).\n\n0\n\nShe won Best British Female last year, so she couldn't be nominated in that category again this year. I'm pretty sure that rule applies to all the categories.\n\nIt can't, Muse won Best British Live act in 2006 AND 2007 and were up again this year.\n\nShe just hasn't done much of note in the UK this year. A cancelled tour and a single under another guys name. And a 'comeback' where she mis-timed her start, mumbled frequently, was scared as hell and looked like she belongs on an oxfam advert.\n\n0\n\nShe won the Brit for Best Female last year and was nominated for Back To Black as well. Back To Black turned out to be much more successful in 2007 than it had been in 2006, but they weren't to know that at the time were they?\n\nShe was nominated (with Mark Ronson) for Valerie because that song was released in 2007. Apart from that she hasn't done any new material that she hasn't been awarded for/nominated for.\n\nIs this really so hard for people to understand?\n\n0\n\nIt can't, Muse won Best British Live act in 2006 AND 2007 and were up again this year.\n\nI think that category is different. Muse may be touring the same material as last year (I don't know if they are or not). But the fact that they toured in 07 makes them eligable for that award. Wheras Amy Winehouse didnt release a new album in 2007 so she is ineligable for the Best Female, Best Album etc awards.\n\n0\n\nWhere's this rule that you need to release an album to be nominated in the best british female category?\n\nAll the other nominees only released about 2 or 3 singles, Leona Lewis only released one single. Bat For Lashes didn't release an album last year.\n\nSo I don't understand where this rule is that Amy Winehouse isn't eligible if all the others are for Best British Female.\n\n0"
