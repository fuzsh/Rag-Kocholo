        "text": "For many fans, music is personal. We become attached to certain songs because they help us remember specific events, we identify with the lyrics our favorite artists write or sing, we experience concerts as communal gatherings, and we associate certain artists or songs with the best or worst of times.\n\nAccordingly, when movies are made about our favorite performers, we want to see them done well, and for those artists to be represented credibly and respectfully. The more iconic the performer, the greater the risk.\n\nNot surprisingly, the results are usually a mixed bag, especially in recent years. For every Bohemian Rhapsody, in which Rami Malek channeled Freddie Mercury and won an Oscar for it, there’s an I Wanna Dance with Somebody, in which Naomi Ackie barely made an impression as Whitney Houston.\n\nBetter were films like Elvis and Rocketman, in which Austin Butler and Taron Egerton impressively captured the vibes of Elvis Presley and Elton John, respectfully, even if they didn’t exactly look like those legendary artists. They both did some of their own singing, too, in addition to lip-synching to the original tracks. (For the record, Elvis was one of my favorite movies of 2022, and Rocketman was an honorary mention in 2019.)\n\nNow we have Back to Black, in which Marisa Abela (one of the stars of the HBO show Industry) plays one of my all-time favorite artists, Amy Winehouse.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nShare this blog post:\n\nWhen news broke yesterday that Amy Winehouse had died at the age of 27, the news was less shocking than it was just sad.\n\nAfter all, Amy was a singer who burst on the scene in 2007 and created an immediate buzz with “Rehab,” a song that would later go on to win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year (she won four other awards that year).\n\nAnd that song seemed to tell you everything you needed to know about Amy, a troubled singer who had problems with drugs, drinking, and the law: “They tried to make me go to rehab,” she sang, “and I said ‘No, no, no.'”\n\nUltimately, that’s what derailed her career and now seems to have ended her life as well.

I read in the Boston Globe this morning that according to the Web site Outsidein.com, Boston is the bloggiest city in the country, with 89 posts per 100,000 residents recorded in March and April of this year. Good for us. I guess we have a lot to say. But it brings up an interesting question: what was I saying back then? Let’s take a trip in the wayback machine, shall we?\n\nAhh, March and April. Those were the good ole days of Haley Scarnato. When Dice-K was just bad, not quite awful yet. Back then I was listening to Amy Winehouse and making fun of Best Buy (how times have changed). There were good movies and not-so-good ones. Ah yes, March and April. Those were good times. No wonder I was blogging so much. And to think, we only had one more post than the greater Philadelphia area. I wonder if they counted this one or this one. Either way, I say Ha! Take that, Philly! (And yes, that was said with all due sarcasm.)\n\nShare this blog post:\n\nI know writing about it will serve as nothing more than a jinx, but I just had to mention that I’ve developed some really good T karma lately. For the past week, every day, as soon as I’ve gotten to the Boylston T stop to go home (or within a minute of my arrival), the C line has shown up. There’s been no waiting, and I’ve gotten home within about 20 minutes of leaving the office. It’s been almost as if the car was just idling by, waiting for me to get to the bottom of the stairs so it could pull up and let me get on. Did you hear me? This happens every day. That’s unheard of! It’s miraculous! It’s beyond the realm of possibility! It even happened yesterday, a Sunday, when I went to the movies. I thought I was powerful before. Now it seems I can will a T into arriving at my whim. That’s awesome.\n\nBut that’s not all that’s going well lately. We’re now within the last 24 hours of Passover, and I can already taste the hot rolls and pasta dinner that I’ll enjoy at Bertucci’s tomorrow night. The Sox are back at home (and a bonus: Harry Connick Jr. is set to sing the National Anthem before the game on Tuesday). I learned this weekend that Felicity is back (to back) on television, on Fuse. I found MP3s of an awesome live show by Amy Winehouse. And, I’m pretty sure Haley is safe. Now, if only the weather would warm up, then things would be near perfect.\n\nAnd yes, I expect most, if not all of what I’ve written about to cease immediately (sorry, Haley). There’s nothing like talking about good things to make them end.\n\nShare this blog post:\n\nI had a long drive ahead of me today, so put in my new mix of songs from Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen, Mika, and James Morrison’s latest CDs. That’s all the mix was — my favorite five or six tracks from those four albums. And if I can toot my own horn about my mix-making ability, then I have to say this was one damned good mix. But it’s not just my arranging that made this mix so good — it was the music itself. Yes, you’ve heard me mention all those folks before on this blog, but if you’ll allow me to do it one more time, I just wanted to give them another plug. If you don’t already own Winehouse’s Back to Black, Allen’s Alright, Still, Mika’s Life in Cartoon Motion, or Morrison’s Undiscovered, then seriously, do yourself a favor and pick them up. Or download a few tracks on iTunes. You’ll thank me.\n\nShare this blog post:"
