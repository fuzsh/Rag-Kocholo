History Highlight:

In 2008, Amy Winehouse won five prizes at the Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year (both for her single "Rehab"), and Best New Artist. She was not in attendance that night, but she did perform via satellite from London. In her acceptance speech for record of the year, she thanked her record label, her parents and "my Blake, my Blake incarcerated," referring to her husband. Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning in 2011 at age 27. Back to Black posthumously became, for a time, the U.K.'s best-selling album of the 21st century.

1942 - "Chattanooga Choo Choo" by Glenn Miller and his Orchestra became the first recording to be awarded a Gold Record. It was actually just a master copy of the disc sprayed with gold lacquer by RCA as a publicity stunt. The actual award recognized today as a Gold Record would not be initiated for another sixteen years when the Recording Industry Association of America borrowed the idea and trademarked the Gold Record. The first Gold single was awarded to Perry Como in 1958 for "Catch A Falling Star" and the first Gold album was given to Gordon McRae for the soundtrack to "Oklahoma".

1958 - Frank Sinatra started a five-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with Come Fly With Me.

The lead singles from the album, "It's Too Late" and "I Feel the Earth Move", spent five weeks at No. 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts and in 2003, Tapestry was ranked No. 36 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. King wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the album, several of which had already been hits for other artists such as Aretha Franklin's "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" and The Shirelles' "Will You Love Me Tomorrow", and James Taylor, who encouraged King to sing her own songs and who also played on Tapestry, would later have a No. 1 hit with "You've Got a Friend".
