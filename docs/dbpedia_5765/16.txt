Amy Winehouse was the biggest winner at last night's Grammy Awards, collecting five prizes.

The troubled soul singer won three awards for her 'Rehab' single: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Female Pop Vocal Performance.

She also took home the Pop Vocal Album prize for her Back To Black LP and the prestigious Best New Artist gong.

Winehouse was unable to attend the LA event after being denied a US visa, but she performed 'Rehab' and 'You Know I'm No Good' from London via satellite.

She dedicated her awards to Blake Fielder-Civil, her imprisoned husband, and London, after the city witnessed a major fire at the weekend.

Other big winners included Kanye West, who took home four awards, and Bruce Springsteen, who collected three. Justin Timberlake, Mary J Blige and Carrie Underwood won two awards apiece.

Notable British successes came from Mark Ronson, who collected the Producer of the Year prize, and The Chemical Brothers, who won the Electronic/Dance Album gong for We Are The Night.
