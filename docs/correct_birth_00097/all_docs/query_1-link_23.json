        "text": "Cross stitch chart or kit from the Scarlet Quince 20th & 21st Century Fine Art Collection.\n\nGrant DeVolson Wood (February 13, 1891 â€“ February 12, 1942) was an American painter, born in Anamosa, Iowa. He is best known for his paintings depicting the rural American Midwest, particularly the painting American Gothic, an iconic image of the 20th century.\n\nThis piece gives a view of the cottage where Herbert Hoover was born (the leftmost of the three white adjoining buildings in the centre of the painting -- the two-storey house and covered walkway were added by a later owner, and are no longer there). When Hoover became president, it became a popular tourist attraction, and a tour guide stands on the lawn and gestures toward the cottage. Orphaned at 9, Hoover called this place \"physical proof of the unbounded opportunity of American life.\" The hamlet of West Branch is shown from the top of a steep hill on a clear early autumn day. (American Regionalism, 1931)\n\nApprox: 25\" x 19\" or 63 x 47cm - when worked on 18ct or 36ct."
