The park's historic structures, like the Birthplace Cottage, the Blacksmith Shop, the Schoolhouse, and the Friends Meetinghouse, symbolize American ideals as Herbert Hoover saw them and lived them. As additions to the historic landscape of Hoover's early years, the Gravesite, the Statue of Isis, and the Presidential Library and Museum connect his childhood to his later accomplishments."
