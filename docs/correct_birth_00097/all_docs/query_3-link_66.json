        "text": "HERBERT HOOVER\n\nManav Verma\n\nUS 1 Academic\n\nFebruary 10, 2016\n\nKnapp\n\n` Herbert Hoover was born on August 10, 1874, in West Branch, Iowa, and was the first president born west of the Mississippi River. He was academically successful and strived to be the best. He was a great candidate but his presidency was a failed one. The Great Depression is mostly to blame, as Hoover worked hard to get to his position and then watched his hard work leave as he lost the chance to be reelected.\n\nHoover was born in a Quaker community, which he later left at the age of nine since his parents died. His father died first at the age of 34, in 1880, the cause was pneumonia and heart failure. And Hoover’s mother died died in 1884 of typhoid fever …show more content…\n\nPresident Warren G. Harding then asked Hoover to be his secretary of commerce, as did President Calvin Coolidge after him. In this role he was the driving force behind such projects as the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Hoover Dam(Hamilton). When President Coolidge decided not to run for another term, Herbert Hoover was nominated as the Republican candidate in 1928. He ran against New York governor Alfred E. Smith and won the position of president. During Hoover’s campaign, he famously said, “We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land,” but a year later the stock market crash of 1929, also known as the Great Depression struck, and the worst economic depression in American history was Hoover’s administration next problem(Hamilton). Most historians say this was the worst time for a new president to be elected because the Great Depression was too big on an obstacle for Hoover’s administration to get through(Hamilton).\n\nHoover was elected in 1928 at 53 years old, he had won primaries in California,New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Maryland. His administration promised to keep lower taxes and a tax on imports and exports also known as a protective tariff. (Faushold). He also had the votes of most women as in this time it was a new right given to these women(History). But as he came into office Hoover started losing popularity, and that because of five words, \"a final triumph over poverty\"—words"
