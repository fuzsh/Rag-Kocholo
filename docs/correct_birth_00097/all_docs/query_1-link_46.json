        "text": "Curriculum Materials: Art in America\n\nHerbert Hoover\n\nThe stories that grew up around Herbert Hoover, the controversial 31st president of the United States, all began with his birth in 1874 in a small cottage in West Branch, Iowa. After an unsettled childhood, Hoover became a very successful mining engineer, amassing a fortune while operating mines in the United States, England, Australia, and China. During and after the First World War, he ran several relief committees to aid Americans as well as oppressed Europeans. Hoover's dedication to relief efforts made him a hero.\n\nKnowing Americans' love for rags-to-riches stories, Hoover kicked off his presidential campaign with a public rally in his rural hometown. The campaign was successful, and in 1929 Hoover became president of the United States. Tragically, later in 1929 the stock market crashed, bringing about the Great Depression. Unemployment and bankruptcy devastated Americans across the country."
