        "text": "Plan to spend several hours visiting the site to fully enjoy all the features offered, including the Junior Ranger Program. Don’t forget your National Park Passport books to get your stamp.\n\nNote: The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library is actually operated by the National Archives, not the National Park Service, and therefore has a separate entrance fee.\n\nVisitor Center\n\nAs with any good tour, always start at the Visitor Center for maps, location information, original artifacts in the museum, and more. We got a jump start for our visit by watching the short film about Herbert Hoover online. You can find the video link here. This was the perfect complement to our early 20th century American history study.\n\nWe brought along our National Park Passport books to receive our stamps and the kids participated in the Junior Ranger Program. The kids think they are getting a little too old for the program but I love the value that the activity book adds to our visit.\n\nHistorical Site Grounds\n\nThe Herbert Hoover Historical Site has a lot of ground too be covered. We enjoyed completing the scavenger hunt as we walked through the birthplace cottage, schoolhouse, blacksmith shop and Quaker Friends Meeting House.\n\nI didn’t realize how extensive the property is and all the options so unfortunately we didn’t plan enough time to see all the sights. We are definitely planning a return visit.\n\nHistory in Iowa\n\nIowa is full of rich history and many places to explore. For more location ideas check out our list of over 20 Historical Field Trips in Des Moines Iowa, and the Cedar Falls Historical Society.\n\nA second National Park can be found in northeastern Iowa at Effigy Mounds.\n\nDid you know that Iowa has 70 State Parks, 4 major State Forests, 90 State preserves, 6 National Wildlife refuges, and 99 county parks, most with nature centers and educational programs?"
