National parks, delicious food, fascinating shops, green parks, and annual festivals are all here waiting for you.\n\nWest Branch is the birthplace to Herbert Hoover, 31st President of the United States, and home to one of only twenty four Presidential Libraries in the country. The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library Museum is open daily and surrounded by the beautiful grounds of the Herbert Hoover Historic Site.\n\nWhile you’re here, don’t forget to stop in at the local shops and grab a bite to eat. From art and antiques at Main Street Antiques and the West Branch Emporium to the quilting specialty at Cotton Creek Mill, you’ll have to pull yourself away from the shops at the end of the day. Dining includes delicious Mexican fare from Mexico Lindo, home cooked delicacies and coffee from The Serving Cafe, the famous pizza of Herb & Lou’s, a dessert treat from Main Street Sweets and don’t forget to wet your whistle at The Down Under."
