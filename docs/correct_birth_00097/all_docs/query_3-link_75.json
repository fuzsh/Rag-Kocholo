However, he took most of the blame in the minds of the American people.\n\nHe was also viewed as insensitive toward the suffering of millions of U.S. citizens.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHerbert Hoover was born in the small town of West Branch, Iowa in 1874. His father Jessie was a blacksmith who also sold farm equipment. He died of a heart attack when Herbert was six.\n\nThree year’s later, Herbert’s mother Huldah died of pneumonia. Herbert and his siblings, Theodore and Mary, were passed between relatives for several years. They eventually ended up with an uncle in Oregon.\n\nIn school, Herbert earned average or failing grades in all subjects except math. Still, he was determined to attend Stanford University. He studied hard and passed the school’s entrance exam.\n\nHoover graduated from Stanford with a degree in geology and became a mining engineer. He traveled the world finding valuable mines. He soon became a multimillionaire.\n\nFamily Life\n\nIn 1899, Hoover married his college sweetheart, Lou Henry. Lou had been the only female geology major at Stanford during Hoover’s college years.\n\nLou traveled with Herbert everywhere he went and mastered eight languages. The couple had two sons, Herbert and Allan Henry.\n\nHumanitarian Work\n\nWhen World War I broke out, the wealthy Hoover turned to humanitarian work. He helped 120,000 American tourists who were stranded in Europe safely return home.\n\nAfter Belgium was occupied by Germany, he arranged for the delivery of food and supplies to the nation’s citizens.\n\nHis work was so excellent that President Woodrow Wilson took notice.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson appointed Hoover the head of the Food Administration, and later the head of the American Relief Administration.\n\nThrough the organization, he provided “Hoover lunches” to as many as 10.5 million people daily. He received worldwide praise and thousands of thank you letters.\n\nPresident Warren Harding appointed Hoover the secretary of commerce, and he continued to serve in this position under President Calvin Coolidge.\n\nHe helped organize radio broadcasting and the aviation (airplane) industry. He also played a major role in the construction of a dam on the Colorado River, which was named the Hoover Dam in his honor.\n\nIn 1928, many Republicans wanted Calvin Coolidge to run again, but he declined. Herbert Hoover became the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nHe won the election over the democratic candidate Alfred E. Smith, the governor of New York. Hoover won by a record number of electoral votes: 444-87.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Hoover promised to continue the peace and prosperity of the nation.\n\nPresidency\n\nJust seven months after Hoover took office, the stock market crashed. The crash sent the United States into a severe economic downturn known as the Great Depression.\n\nBanks and businesses failed, and unemployment rose. Millions of Americans lost their savings, their jobs, and their homes.\n\nHoover enacted some policies intended to help, such as cutting taxes and increasing public works spending. But he was a believer in a limited role for the federal government.\n\nHe felt that the federal government shouldn’t interfere and that relief efforts should happen at the local level. Hoover vetoed several bills that would have directly helped millions of struggling Americans.\n\nNot surprisingly, this was not a popular decision to the American people. Many of them were standing in bread lines for food and living in shantytowns, which they nicknamed “Hoovervilles.”\n\nThe Great Depression was not Hoover’s fault, but the American people felt that he did not do enough to help. The fact that Hoover was extremely wealthy certainly didn’t help his image.\n\nIn the 1932 presidential election, Hoover was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then the governor of New York.\n\nAfter the Presidency\n\nAfter leaving the White House, Hoover was a vocal critic of Roosevelt’s New Deal policies. He wrote articles and books about the danger of giving the federal government too much power.\n\nHe worked with food relief during World War II and later worked on commissions for Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower to help cut costs in government.\n\nHoover died in New York City in 1964 at the age of 90. By the time of his death, people had grown less critical of Hoover’s presidency, understanding that he was not to blame for the Great Depression.\n\nFun Facts About Herbert Hoover\n\nHerbert Hoover was the first U.S. president born west of the Mississippi River. He was also the nation’s first Quaker president.\n\nWhen Hoover accepted the Republican nomination for president, he ironically declared, “We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land.”\n\nHoover signed a law that made “The Star-Spangled Banner” America’s national anthem.\n\nHe did not accept his presidential salary, instead donating it to charity.\n\nHoover was the first president to have a telephone on his office desk."
