WEST BRANCH, Iowa (KCRG) - Our Town West Branch is the birthplace of the only president from Iowa: Herbert Hoover. It also sits on a national park that also bears his name. Steps away sits the Hoover Presidential Library and Museum. That’s where a new exhibit celebrates the 150th birthdays of the 31st president and first lady Lou Hoover.

Assistant Curator Melanie Wier worked to take visitors from Hoover’s birth in West Branch and his wife’s in Waterloo, through their birthday celebrations in the White House and parties that continued in West Branch after his presidency.

“In 1956 it was decided that this blacksmith shop would be rebuilt to tell Jesse Hoover’s story, Herbert’s father, but also to represent those values of hard work and integrity,” says Chelsea Nelson, a park ranger at the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site.

But the 150th birthday exhibit will be the last in the space until 2026. Most of what visitors have seen inside the museum is changing for the first time in 30 years. A $20 million renovation will update the entire permanent gallery and will support an addition to allow for larger groups to gather.

The nonprofit foundation that supports the Museum is raising the funds to make it possible.

“People support the fact that this is a wonderful travel destination and making sure this is a viable, modern experience that people want to come to is also important,” said Mundi McCarty, President of the Hoover Presidential Foundation.

Even during construction, there will still be a reason to explore the presidential history of Our Town West Branch. The National Park Service’s Hoover Historic Site will be open the entire time - including the blacksmith shop.

“We will be in here, we will be making things, it will be myself and a few other rangers we switch out and we all just get to share the time in here and that’s so fun,” said Nelson.
