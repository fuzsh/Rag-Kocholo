        "text": "After a number of attempts to watch this film previously over the years, I have finally managed to see this film fully, as BBC 2 showed it the other night and its currently on i player too.\n\nI tried a few times before over the years to watch this but I just could not get into it.\n\nI wanted to see it in full still, as this film after its release on vhs in the mid to late 80's was recommended as good by whoever had seen it and it seems to have good online reviews too now.\n\nThere are 2 reasons why I found it hard to get into previously, first, there is no introduction of the main character(s).\n\nIt just shows the main character Will Graham, at the very begining of the film as a former FBI profiler, talking to an old FBI colleague on a beach and he is being asked to reprise his old role in a one off, time limited way, to help work out the identity of a serial killer who is still at large.\n\nThe other reason I found it hard to follow is, that there is loads of mumbling by the actors and the talking is quite fast too.\n\nThis time though I put the subtitles on (!) to catch most of what they say and I think this is a necessity if you want to get into it and catch what they say properly.\n\nI believe this is the first film to feature Hannibal Lecter in it too BUT its not really a spoiler to mention he is not the serial killer at large, he is already locked up but the main character just like Jodie Foster in the Silence Of The Lambs, goes to see him for his take about the serial killer and they have history too!\n\nLecter is not played by Anthony Hopkins in this one but by the very good Scottish actor, Brian Cox and he to me is just as good as Hopkins and I peferred Brian Cox's performance as Lecter to Hopkins portrayal.\n\nIf anything, Hopkins seems a bit too much in comparison where Cox imo, got the balance right, not over acted nor under acted the role but got it pretty much in the middle like and got it right and good imo.\n\nThis film was directed by Michael Mann, a director who imo, on the whole is a very good director but this also explains the mumbling, as in another MM film (Heat 1995), that film had loads of mumbling in it too.\n\nIf you have seen it, what's your take on it?\n\nIf you haven't seen it, I say its worth the watch but again put the subtitles on.\n\nI found the first hour or so to be really good and gripping and then it went a bit off key imo to the end as if they chose to take their foot off the gas re how intense the first 70 minutes or so were.\n\nIts still worth watching though imo.\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/title/tt0091474/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk"
