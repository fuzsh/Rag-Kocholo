        "text": "A murderer who was nicknamed \"Hannibal Lecter\" after killing child molesters in a string of brutal attacks will die underground \"alone\" in a bulletproof glass cage.\n\nRobert Maudsley, now 64, has to remain confined in isolation for 23 hours a day as he is believed to be so dangerous.\n\nThe savage killer has been forced to sleep on a concrete slab inside of his specially made 5.5 metres by 4.5 metre glass box beneath Wakefield Prison.\n\nREAD MORE: Arrest made as woman flees park bench after man tries to kiss her\n\nMaudsley, from Liverpool, killed his first victim at the age of just 21 and has been in prison since 1974, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nHe has already killed three people in prison and there are fears he would continue his murderous spree if he was released into general population.\n\nKeep up with the latest news with our email alerts directly to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nThe fourth out of twelve children, the twisted killer spent his early years in a Catholic orphanage at Nazareth House before his abusive parents reclaimed him at 8 years old.\n\nHe suffered years of violent abuse at the hands of his father when he returned home to his parents and took extra beatings to protect his siblings.\n\nMaudsley even once spent six months locked in a room, his only contact being with his father who'd come to beat him several times a day.\n\nAs a 16-year-old, he fell down the hole of drug addiction and turned to sex work to earn money - it was here he met his first victim in 1974.\n\nMaudsley garroted his client John Farrell to death after the man showed him photos of children he'd abused.\n\nDeclared unfit to stand trial and sent away with the recommendation that he never be released, Maudsley was locked up in Broadmoor Hospital, home to some of Britain's most dangerous criminals.\n\nThree years later, he and fellow prisoner, David Cheeseman, barricaded themselves inside a room with tied up child molester, David Francis.\n\nThe pair tortured Francis to death before dangling his body for prison guards to see.\n\nCharged with manslaughter, Maudsley was moved to the maximum-security Wakefield Prison in Yorkshire where he found his final two victims.\n\nIn a murderous rage on July 29, 1978, Maudsley first strangled and stabbed Salney Darwood, a 46-year-old who was locked up for killing his wife.\n\nAfter hiding Darwood's body under a bed, he then crept into the cell of Bill Roberts, 56, who had sexually abused a seven-year-old girl."
