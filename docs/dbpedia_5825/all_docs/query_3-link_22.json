        "text": "One of the most recognizable and terrifying villains in film history, Hannibal Lecter first appeared in the 1981 novel ‘Red Dragon’ and gained international recognition thanks to Anthony Hopkins’ captivating performance in the 1991 film ‘The Silence of the Lambs.’ Lecter’s twisted personality and obsession with devouring his victims have left a lasting impression on viewers, winning Hopkins an Oscar and cementing the picture’s status as one of the best horror films ever made.\n\nIs Hannibal Lecter based on a real person? is a question that arises from the film’s realism and compelling character. Like many works of fiction, the character itself is fictional, but its creator took inspiration from actual events, particularly from a real-life murderous doctor.\n\nThe numerous film adaptations of Thomas Harris’s books, which starred Hannibal Lecter, serve as a sombre illustration of how art can mimic life. Because of Lecter’s homicidal tendencies and indisputable charm, viewers are drawn to the character and become curious about the real person who served as inspiration for Hannibal Lecter.\n\nThe lambs will not remain silent in the face of this unsettling revelation because of the true terror that lies behind the character.\n\nAuthor Thomas Harris was a journalist when he found himself in Mexico early in the 1960s investigating the case of Dykes Askew Simmons, a killer who had suffered severe injuries. But the inmate who made the biggest impression was another, whom Harris took to be “Dr. Salazar,” a member of the prison staff.\n\nDuring the interviews, Dr Salazar embodied his medical title by asking thoughtful questions and maintaining a composed demeanour. The horrifying yet thought-provoking theories Salazar offered regarding Simmons’ victims pleased Harris.\n\nHarris was taken aback when the warden revealed to him that Salazar was, in fact, Alfredo Ballí Treviño, a former surgeon who identified as gay during a period of intense LGBT discrimination in Mexico. Harris had assumed Salazar was a prison physician.\n\nWhile Lecter and Treviño seem to share the trait of killing and dismembering victims, Harris was inspired by other things as well. Treviño’s impeccable manners and impeccable taste, which were evident even during his incarceration, are another similarity.\n\nThis is very similar to how Lecter is portrayed, who speaks and behaves in a distinctly gentlemanly way. Furthermore, both men had medical training: Lecter was a forensic psychologist with first-hand knowledge of serial killers, and Treviño was a clever surgeon with accuracy and skill.\n\n– Farheen Ali"
