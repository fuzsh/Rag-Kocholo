        "text": "Former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump has addressed his repeated references to the fictional murderer and cannibal Hannibal Lecter, from the book and movie \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"\n\nDuring his Wednesday rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump appeared to explain why he keeps praising the character, saying it was because they are \"real stories.\"\n\n\"They go crazy when I say the late, great Hannibal Lecter. They say, 'Why would he mention Hannibal Lecter? He must be cognitively in trouble.' No. These are real stories. Hannibal Lecter from 'Silence of the Lamb,' is a lovely man. He wants to have you for dinner,\" he said.\n\nTrump has mentioned the character several times before during speeches.\n\nDuring a rally in New Jersey in May, he said, \"'Silence of the Lambs.' Has anyone ever seen 'The Silence of the Lambs'? The late, great Hannibal Lecter is a wonderful man.\"\n\nOn more than one occasion, he appears to pivot from speaking about immigration to talking about Hanibal Lecter, who was held in a psychiatric hospital, leading some critics to suggest he may be conflating asylum seekers with what he's referred to as \"insane asylums.\"\n\n\"They're coming from prisons, they're coming from jails, they're coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. You know the press is always on me cause I say this. Has anyone seen 'Silence of the Lambs'?\" said Trump during his Republican National Committee (RNC speech on July 19.\n\nTrump's critics — including President Biden — have mocked him for speaking about the character as though he were a real person.\n\n\"Donald, Hannibal Lecter is not real,\" Biden wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on July 20 along with a clip of Trump's RNC speech.\n\nThe character of Hannibal Lecter was created by writer Thomas Harris, whose novel about the relationship between psychiatrist Lecter and FBI agent Clarice Starling was published in 1988. The most famous portrayal was delivered by Sir Anthony Hopkins in 1991 movie adaptation.\n\nHopkins reacted to Trump's praising words of Hannibal in an interview with Deadline published July 16, saying he wasn't aware the former president had developed an interest in the character.\n\n\"God, that was over 30 years ago. I'm shocked and appalled what you've told me about Trump,\" said Hopkins.\n\nDespite the criticism, his supporters' positive reaction at events may be a reason for Trump to repeat the reference.\n\n\"Nearly everything Trump does is done for attention. It has driven him his whole career, whether in business or politics. He tests out lines on his crowds. If they get a good response, he keeps them in,\" Dr Andrew Wroe, senior lecturer in American politics at the University of Kent, told Newsweek.\n\nSince President Joe Biden, 81, pulled out of the 2024 race, Trump has faced growing concerns over his age and ability to spend another four years in office. Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has seen a surge of support, both among her party and voters at large, according to recent polls."
