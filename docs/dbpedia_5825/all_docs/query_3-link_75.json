        "text": "Description\n\nThis article is from the Hannibal Lecter FAQ, by Cory Compton Coleman cory@gladstone.uoregon.edu with numerous contributions by others.\n\n01 Is Hannibal Lecter Real?\n\n\"If Mighty Mouse and Hannibal Lecter got in a fight, who do you\n\nthink would win?\"\n\n\"What are you, stupid? Mighty Mouse is a cartoon. Lecter is a\n\nreal guy!\"\n\nOf all the frequently asked questions, this question is the most frequent.\n\nNot a week goes by that I'm not asked about the fictional nature of Lecter.\n\nAnd sadly, it is my duty to say that Hannibal Lecter is only the creation\n\nof Thomas Harris.\n\nThere's hope, though. Although fictional, Lecter does combine qualities\n\nthat have been found in other serial killers. Ted Bundy was a well educated\n\nlaw student serial killer who had a lot of charisma. Cannibalism is\n\nrelatively common among serial killers, and while most cannibals prefer\n\ntheir dinners raw, there have been cases of killers enjoying specially\n\ncooked meals.\n\nWhat Lecter was to serial murderers, the Unabomber was to serial bombers.\n\nIntelligent, insightful, with Lecter's same flair for in-jokes and hidden\n\nmeanings. Of course the Unabomber was more anal than Lecter, but then\n\nbombers are more anal than murderers, so I think it works out.\n\nEvery time I have to break it to someone that Lecter is indeed fictional,\n\nI'm always concerned that they might be embarassed at having believed him\n\nto real. But there really is no reason to feel stupid. It's an easy\n\nmistake, and I know that I, by refering to Lecter as real person through\n\nthe page, only help to confuse people.\n\nBut don't think you're the only one who's been through this. Former Vice\n\nPresident Dan \"Mr. Potato Head\" Quayle never could figure out the\n\ndifference between fact and fiction. After insulting Murphy Brown, he sent\n\nher baby a toy. The studio donated the stuffed animal to Toys for Tots \"so\n\nthat a real child could enjoy it\".\n\n&nbsp\n\nContinue to:\n\nIndex\n\nnext: 02 Is there really an \"Anthrax Island\" ? (Hannibal Lecter)"
