        "text": "Cox recently revealed why he didn't return as Hannibal in his 2021 memoir Putting the Rabbit in the Hat, explaining that new director Jonathan Demme wanted \"to do everything in a fresh and original way\".\n\n\"Why wasn’t I asked back? Well, firstly because Michael had let go of the property and it had all got very complicated, as these things do,\" Cox explained. \"Gene Hackman had been approached to direct it, but he jumped ship. Then Jonathan Demme came on board and of course he wanted to be a new broom. He wanted to do everything in a fresh and original way, and he wasn’t interested in who had played Hannibal first.
