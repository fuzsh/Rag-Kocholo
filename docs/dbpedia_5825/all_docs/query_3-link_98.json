        "text": "The Unseen Intricacies of Hannibal Lecter The reason why I chose to analyze Hannibal Lecter in the NBC revival, was definitely not because I wanted to binge the show. Rather, it was totally because I love to explore gray areas of morality and reexamine supposed truths about our society. Hannibal definitely made uncomfortable and not only because of the explicitly violent murders and mutilations, but also because it led me to think more about how I have been taught to feel about cannibalism and how we view extreme, untreated mental illness. As you will see, Hannibal Lecter may not be a classic psychopath, but he is a classic television villain that is certainly worth analyzing because of how deeply complex he is.\n\nI can name on one hand how …show more content…\n\nThe villain is also typically shown as being less conventionally attractive, while the hero is annoyingly good-looking. However, this is so accepted and taken as just the way things have to be, that it’s easy to forget how this can compare to reality. Conventional beauty being the marker of whether you are a hero or a villain is just not how real life works. Maasik and Solomon say, “real-life villains are simply human beings, and beautiful people can be evil while unattractive ones can be very good” (Maasik and Solomon, 443). This rings very in Hannibal. He is not suspected as being a prolific cannibalistic serial killer because in our minds, villains are often ugly, smelly, rude, etc. This, combined with our easy dismissal of most serial killers as just “crazy” often leads to an easy dismissal of anyone who doesn’t act like how we expect them …show more content…\n\nHannibal Lecter is a cannibalistic serial killer and that is what he is most known for. His justification for cannibalism is that he is eating the rude, ridding world of those who do not show politeness and tact. For him, it makes absolute sense. He is the epitome of charm and civility and views himself as being above many humans and as such, anyone who doesn’t treat him with the same respect is inviting death. He views them no different than pigs and so, he eats them. And this is then very different to how America and many westernized, modern societies view cannibalism. Cannibalism is frowned upon for mainly cultural and religious reasons, and social norms. But why is that? It is general knowledge that many animals and insects eat their own kind, whether it’s out of necessity, to show dominance, for sexual satisfaction, or just the extra nutrition. In the very distant past, cannibalism was slightly more common, just due to the fact that famine and disease was so widespread that there was often not much of a choice if you wanted to survive. In the past century alone, there have been many cases of necessary cannibalism, those being the Siege of Leningrad or during the Southeast Asian wars of the 1960’s and the 1970’s or even during World War II (“Human Cannibalism.”). However, there are also recent documented cases of cannibalism being a ritualistic way to honor someone after their death, or as an"
