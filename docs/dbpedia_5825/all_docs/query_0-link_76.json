        "text": "MIAMI — Thomas Harris, the creator of one of literature’s most terrifying monsters, arguably has one of the darkest imaginations of any writer working today. His infamous serial killer, Hannibal Lecter, devours his victims’ organs after delicately preparing them, and once ate a man alive, serving slices of his brain with truffles and caper berries.\n\nSo it’s somewhat unnerving to hear Harris insist that he doesn’t invent anything.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever made up anything,” he tells me as we drive across Miami’s 79th Street Causeway, which takes us past a small island called Bird Key where a climactic scene in his new novel, “Cari Mora,” takes place. “Everything has happened. Nothing’s made up. You don’t have to make anything up in this world.”\n\nHarris, 78, repeats this idea, or a variation of it, nearly every time I ask him about the origins of a plot point or a character, and it occurs to me that his answer is scarier than anything I could have anticipated. It’s not that Harris has a particularly gruesome imagination, it’s that he’s a keen observer and a chronicler of people and their darkest impulses.\n\nFor nearly 45 years, Harris has terrified audiences with his grisly novels, which have sold more than 50 million copies, and introduced one of the most memorable fictional villains of all time — up there with Darth Vader and Dracula. But relatively little is known about Harris or his creative process. He doesn’t do book signings or author appearances. He hasn’t given a substantive interview since the mid-1970s, because he prefers to let his work speak for itself, he says."
