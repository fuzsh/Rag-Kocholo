        "text": "So much has happened since Dr Hannibal Lecter murmured his farewells to agent Clarice Starling over the phone in 1991. Jeffrey Dahmer, the most prominent of America's un-charming, un-cultured serial killers, has been beaten to death in Portage state prison, Wisconsin, by another inmate, without benefit of chianti or fava beans. British enthusiasm for psychological profiling as the new rock'n'roll came to an embarrassed halt with the collapse of the Colin Stagg prosecution over the Wimbledon Common murder.\n\nAnd by 1993, chilled by the atmosphere following the Jamie Bulger case, Anthony Hopkins was saying: \"We are living in an age of such horrors, and there are such terrifying films coming out, that I think it might be time to say: 'Enough is enough'. I don't think glorifying somebody like Lecter is a very good idea. It was an interesting portrait of the character – but let's not go on.\"\n\nTimes have changed. The moral anxiety of the 1990s has receded, along with our saucer-eyed credulity about the science of forensic psychology. The show goes on; Hannibal goes on. But he has returned as the hero, not of a serious psycho-thriller, but a Guignol horror comedy: sleek, fast-moving, more than a little absurd.\n\nClariiiiiiice is now at the peak of her brilliant career at the Bureau. But a bungled drug raid (not her fault) results in ignominy and leads to Dr Lecter himself getting back in touch. He may be a star of the FBI website (and none of us had heard of websites in 1991) but he chooses the most quaintly old-fashioned means possible: perfumed writing paper. He is in Florence, luxuriating in a Jamesian torpor in that ancient city of violence, cunning and refinement, and from afar he experiences in Clarice's distress a resurgence of his twisted gallantry and appalling appetites.\n\nJulianne Moore takes over from Jodie Foster as Clarice and she does the quasi-military jogging-through-the-woods thing, familiar from the first time around, ploughing along with her Titian hair in a bright ponytail flopping from side to side. For action sequences, she can more or less carry off the combination of T-shirt, combats and handgun. But let's face it, neither Clarice nor Julianne is getting any younger. So Moore seems happier bringing a new, languorous sensuality to Clarice's personality – a sexy woman-of-the-world maturity – most prominently when she reclines on a bed in a sexy gown, drugged up with morphine, while Dr Lecter is downstairs in the kitchen rustling up something unspeakable.\n\nAll that can be said of Anthony Hopkins is that he gives a showstopping turn at the centre of the picture. Ridley Scott does an expert job of – well, not directing him as such, but organising the flash-bang pyrotechnics around his reptilian yet bull-like figure, and just letting Hopkins get on with it.\n\nThen there's that voice . It was always a mixture of Blanche Dubois and Richard III as spoken by Hopkins's first employer, Laurence Olivier. Now Blanche has got the upper hand. It's gamey, stagey, super camp: and distinctly un-American. (Despite being one of Baltimore's most famous products – along with Edgar Allan Poe and John Waters – Dr Lecter teasingly denies being American. In his menacing playfulness Hannibal is quite similar to Hopkins's fondly remembered stage performance as the Murdochesque newspaper proprietor in Howard Brenton and David Hare's Pravda.\n\nHopkins does not really look any older than when we last saw him as Dr Lecter, and he is one of those extraordinary actors whose age is indeterminate – now playing a character hardly different in age to the old war criminal he played in the TV series QB VII in 1974. The disappointment for Hannibal fans is that at no stage does Hopkins do that extraordinary rattlesnake-hiss with his tongue against his top teeth. On the loose, moreover, Hannibal loses some of the awful glamour he had when he was, for the want of a better word, restrained, and he can't do any of the forced encounters with Clarice that made Jonathan Demme's 1991 movie so interesting.\n\nLike a vampire, Dr Lecter is at his best indoors, in darkness, or in the gloom of Florence's cloisters, where he affects sunglasses and a jaunty panama. He lectures on art history; he plays the Goldberg Variations. (In Hannibal 2, I'd like to hear him, in this high culture mode, read aloud from Ash Wednesday: \"Lady, three white leopards sat under a juniper tree/In the cool of the day, having fed to satiety/On my legs my heart my liver and that which had been contained/In the hollow round of my skull.\")\n\nSpeaking of which, we critics are forbidden on pain of being chomped from revealing the grisly finale. But anyone could see that the crooked justice department official Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) is coming to a bad end. Not merely does he come on to Clarice in the most ungentlemanly way possible, but seriously disses Hannibal – calling him gay, of all the slanderous things! Krendler is certainly punished for the offensive assumptions underpinning that remark, and Dr Lecter's culinary predilections are given full and horrible expression. Ridley Scott has made a quite a meal of all this. But in 1991 Demme made it an intricate Le Caprice creation. This one leaves open the possibility of any number of sequels, like a franchise. I'm not sure I want fries with that."
