        "text": "Topline\n\nFormer President Donald Trump described fictional serial killer and cannibal Hannibal Lecter as a “wonderful man” while campaigning Saturday at one of his few mid-hush money trial campaign stops.\n\nKey Facts\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nSaturday wasn’t Trump’s first mention of Hannibal Lecter. Trump compared migrants to Hannibal Lecter as recently as March, when he said people coming into the country were “rough people, in many cases from jails, prisons, from mental institutions, insane asylums, … you know, insane asylums, that’s ‘Silence of the Lambs’ stuff,” he said, according to NBC News. “Hannibal Lecter, anybody know Hannibal Lecter? We don’t want ‘em in this country.”\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump’s Saturday rally was one of few he’s had lately while balancing his campaign schedule with his ongoing hush money trial in New York. He had a rally planned for North Carolina in April—which would have been his first since the trial began—but it was canceled due to severe weather. Since then, he spoke at campaign rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan on one of his days off from court this month, and the Jersey campaign rally was only his third during the trial. CNN reported that Trump has had no public appearances on eight of his 12 days off since proceedings began on April 15. Along with his rant about Hannibal Lecter, Trump hit his other usual talking points at Saturday’s rally, including reiterating his support for Israel—and criticizing Biden’s decision to halt some weapon shipments—targeting Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the hush money charges against Trump, and saying “our country’s in trouble, it’s in big trouble.”\n\nTangent\n\nAt Saturday’s rally, Trump brought out North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who is reportedly on the former president’s short list for vice presidential running mate. Trump told the crowd they wouldn’t “find anybody better than this gentleman in terms of his knowledge,” and said they should “get ready for something … Doug Burgum has been incredible,” CNN reported, potentially hinting at a vice presidential selection.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nRolling StoneTrump Says He'd 'Immediately Deport 'Anti-Americanism' Protesters in Bizarre Rally Speech CNNTrump holds beachfront rally on Jersey Shore amid criminal trial in New York | CNN Politics"
