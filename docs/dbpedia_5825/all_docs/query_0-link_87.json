        "text": "The Silence of the Lambs made Hannibal Lecter a household name. This film came out in 1991âwhich means I have spent nearly a quarter century occasionally wondering if a fictional character would murder me. Not if he could, but if he would. Hereâs how Hannibal became a permanent part of my brain.\n\nThe Lecter Standard\n\nEven the best parents occasionally fall down on the job, and it was one of those slips that led to me seeing The Silence of the Lambs when I was still in elementary school. My parents werenât fans of censoring films, and they were interested in the film themselvesâbut they thought they were seeing a garden variety killer film and hadnât counted on what Jonathan Demme and Thomas Harris were dishing out. The film has every possible kind of age-inappropriate content, from violence to emotional trauma to strong language. Itâs surprising how much kids can pick up from tone of voice. Though Iâd never heard the word before, I knew better than to ask my parents what a âcuntâ was. Same with âfellatio.â\n\nOr maybe I didnât ask because I had so many other things to discuss. I loved the film, and the car ride home was filled with chatter about how smart it was to rip off a police officerâs face in order to escape in an ambulance. The film never gave me a single nightmare. It never made me afraid of the dark. Although I fear some ridiculous things, Iâve never in my life experienced a moment of anxiety about getting kidnapped by a demented serial killer.\n\nBut it would be wrong to say that the film didnât affect me. Even as a child, I easily caught on to Hannibalâs rules. You get rude; you get eaten. Sometimes you get eaten by him alone. Sometimes youâre part of a communal meal. Sometimes he manipulates you into eating yourself (Hi, Miggs!), but if you stray over the line, you are on the menu. From that point on, for my entire life, whenever Iâve been impatient, or inconsiderate, or distracted, or tried to be funny and missed the mark, I canât help wondering, âIf Hannibal Lecter saw me do that, would he murder me for it?â\n\nHannibal Lecter the Nursery Bogie\n\nIn providing a check on my behavior, Hannibal Lecter is joining an ancient order of beasties meant to frighten children. The Dictionary of Fairies calls them âNursery bogies.â They take many forms. Thereâs Jenny Greenteeth, a goblin who lurks near ponds and drags playing children under with her long green teeth. Thereâs Churnmilk Peg, who pinches children plucking unripe nuts from the trees. Thereâs Asin, a cannibal who lures children into the forest. And thereâs Brechta, the Stomach-Slasher, who slashes open the stomach of any child who eats the wrong food on the holy days.\n\nNursery bogies are, clearly, a group of monsters used to frighten children away from water in which they can drown, food that can make them ill, or any place they can get lost. And if there are a few monsters set aside just to make kids hesitant about neglecting their religion or sassing their elders, so much the better.\n\nThese stories arenât meant to engender actual belief in childrenâtheyâre just a vivid way of clarifying the rules of behavior, and making a child think twice about breaking them. This being the standard, Lecter is a fine addition to the group. Really the only problem with him is that heâs a human being, and not a supernatural forceâand the later books and the TV series pretty much took care of that. Thereâs nothing he canât do, and thereâs nothing he doesnât know. So be good, kids.\n\nThe Characters That Stay With Us\n\nI suspect that Iâm not the only one with this particular neurosis. Hannibal Lecter is too well-known for me to be alone. But even if we donât share the same character, we probably share the habit.\n\nWhen people love fiction, there are some characters that become members of our social circle. We consider their reactions as well as we consider the reactions of our friends. Someone out there gets into tough situations, and thinks about what Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica would do. Someone manages to keep their chin up during a tough time, by thinking of Kaylee from Firefly. Someone right now is getting through a wedding by talking to Tyrion Lannister in their head. And someone has decided not to do something mean, because Captain America never would.\n\nPerhaps there are better people to listen to than a psychopath, but thatâs the best part of consulting with fictional characters. You only have to listen to them in some situationsâlike when to have good manners, or what wine pairs well with liver."
