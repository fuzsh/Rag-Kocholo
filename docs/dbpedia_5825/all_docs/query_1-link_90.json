        "text": "Audiences thrilled to Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, but absent that star+character pairing the IP is almost worthless.\n\nWould you believe that there was a time when the third biggest opening weekend of all time belonged to a gruesome and violent R-rated horror movie? Today marks the 20th anniversary of Ridley Scott’s feature-film adaptation of Thomas Harris’ Hannibal. Opening ten years to the weekend after Silence of the Lambs (which turns 30 on Sunday), the film was the very definition of a breakout sequel, opening with $58 million in its debut weekend. That was just below The Phantom Menace ($64 million over a $105 million Wed-Sun debut in 1999) and The Lost World ($74 million over a $92 million Fri-Mon debut in 1997). The film wasn’t quite as leggy as its predecessor but still earned a terrific $165 million domestic and $352 million worldwide on an $87 million budget.\n\nIts legacy is partially in how it kicked off the modern era of the sky-high opening weekend. It began a year that would see three movies (The Mummy Returns, Planet of the Apes and Rush Hour) open with $66-$69 million debuts and come within inches of The Lost World’s domestic debut. The record would be shattered by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone ($90 million) at year’s end. Hannibal was not the first “not a Batman, Star Wars or Jurassic” flick to post a $50 million-plus opening, following The Grinch, X-Men, Mission: Impossible 2 and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. But its powerhouse debut began the normalization of the sky-high opening. Its other legacy is in tricking folks into thinking that it was an endlessly exploitable IP.\n\nThe Steven Zaillian and David Mamet-penned adaptation of Thomas Harris’ blockbuster novel was a case of somewhat missing the point. I don’t think Hannibal is a very good book, but it works then and now as an extended middle finger from Harris to those who watched Silence of the Lambs and thought of Hannibal Lecter as a pop culture anti-hero. It’s especially critical, in a significantly ahead of its time fashion, to those who watched The Silence of the Lambs and wanted to see Hannibal the Cannibal and Clarice Starling in a kind of Beauty and the Beast romance. In a skewed way, it was an attempt to mock or critique pop culture “shipping,” especially those who take an emotional investment (versus mere lustful imagining) in the sexy baddie and the feisty heroine hooking up.\n\nThe book is a little satirical, especially the third act, which essentially gives this demographic what it wants, including a finale where Lecter has to rescue Clarice from certain death and then brainwashes her to fall in love with him. The movie is pretty faithful in terms of moment-to-moment plot. Still, it both takes itself a bit more seriously and is too concerned about retaining the notion of Starling as a good role model/“strong female character” to commit to the bit. I don’t blame Jodie Foster one bit for passing on the movie, and the film tries to have its cake and eat it too in a way that makes it almost an endorsement of the very thing Harris seemed to be mocking. It’s a “prestige” adaptation of an unapologetic schlock novel.\n\nThat said, the film still has a specific power and big-scale appeal as an extravagant, grand-scale horror flick that doesn’t remotely play like a conventional sequel to a serial killer procedural. To the extent that folks might have expected, on the page and/or on the screen, a follow-up to Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs that skewed closer to the “FBI agent uses Lecter to catch a serial killer” formula, this ain’t it. In an early lesson of how regular moviegoers don’t always pay attention to entertainment media, I was shocked at how many folks were surprised by the film’s climax since it had been discussed at length when the book debuted in the summer of 1999. It was fun watching packed audiences react to the “surprise” ending.\n\nNonetheless, opening weekend isn’t about quality, critical acclaim or audience feedback, but rather about pre-release marketing and variables (star power, existing IP, etc.) that earn audience goodwill. Hannibal opened with a sky-high domestic debut specifically because it was a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs and featured Anthony Hopkins returning to the role that turned him into a movie star. That it was so successful sans its predecessor’s top-billed star was, all due respect to substitute Starling Julianne Moore, a troubling sign that original actresses were sometimes disposable even in follow-ups for female-centric hits.\n\nIronically, Bryan Fuller’s acclaimed Hannibal TV show, which ran for three low-rated seasons on NBC, is essentially “What if the Thomas Harris mythology was told in the naval-gazing, grand Guignol, borderline camp style of Hannibal?” That goes to the other significant legacy of Hannibal (the movie). It wrongly convinced Hollywood (or at least Dino de Laurentiis) that Thomas Harris’ novels were viable IP. The Silence of the Lambs was a smash because it was a terrific and impactful movie. Hannibal was a smash because it was a sequel to Silence of the Lambs, and Brett Ratner’s Red Dragon (released in October of 2002) was a minor hit ($208 million on a $93 million budget) because it was a prequel to Lambs. All three featured a specific actor (Hopkins) in a marquee role (Lecter).\n\nMichael Mann’s Manhunter (a before-its-time adaptation of Red Dragon released to decent reviews but low box office in 1986) bombed. Hannibal Rising, based on Harris’ unrequested “origins of Hannibal Lecter” prequel book, opened 14 years ago today to poor reviews and empty theaters ($82 million on a $50 million budget). I adore the Hugh Dancy/ Mads Mikkelsen episodic as much as the next TV nerd, but Hannibal averaged 2.9 million viewers in season one and 1.31 million viewers in season three. NBC letting it run for three seasons was an act of mercy. We’ll see if CBS’s Clarice (starring Rebecca Breeds as Starling in a show set in 1993), which is legally forbidden from even referencing Lecter by name, will buck the trend. Unless Clarice was the marquee character all along, I’m not optimistic.\n\nIt’s yet another reminder that sometimes the success of a given movie or TV show, even when based on source material, is about the specific variables of that given film or show. There’s an entire genre of flailing IP/would-be franchises (Conan, Terminator, Predator, etc.) that is rooted in “people wanted to see Arnold Schwarzenegger in this high concept.” This is for another day, but just because James Cameron turns your first sequel (Aliens, Terminator 2 and even Rambo: First Blood part II, which he co-wrote) into a big-budget action blockbuster doesn’t mean that you have an everlasting IP. Thus far, the success of the Lecter IP has been rooted in Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal “The Cannibal” Lecter and the goodwill stemming from a single excellent serial killer thriller."
