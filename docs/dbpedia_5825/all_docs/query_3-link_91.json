        "text": "Actual transcript from Trump's speech just now:\n\nSilence of the Lambs. Has anyone ever seen The Silence of the Lambs? The late, great Hannibal Lecter is a wonderful man. He oftentimes would have a friend for dinner. Remember the last scene? \"Excuse me. I'm about to have a friend for dinner,\" as this poor doctor walked by. ‘I'm about to have a friend for dinner.’ But Hannibal Lecter. Congratulations. The late, great Hannibal Lecter...\n\nx\n\nx\n\nThe former president spoke in New Jersey over the weekend, where he confused people with his comments about \"O.J.\" and appeared to mistake Beijing for Taiwan.\n\n\"Take a look at Xi, president Xi of China, talking about Beijing. Now they've got ships circling, they have planes, but they never were doing anything,\" Trump said at his Saturday rally. He was likely intending to say \"Taiwan.\"\n\nA Biden-Harris campaign account said a \"confused Trump\" was claiming that \"Chinese president Xi Jinping has 'ships circling' Beijing.\" The account noted that \"Beijing is the landlocked capital of China.\"\n\nwww.rawstory.com/...\n\nx\n\nDonaldTrump loves to brag about the \"huge\" size of his political rallies, but on Saturday a reporter spotted the ex-president's supporters leaving the event while he was still speaking.\n\nTrump spent a good portion of his speech bragging about the size of the crowd, even insisting news cameras turn to face the crowd to show how many people attended the event.\n\nwww.rawstory.com/...\n\nx"
