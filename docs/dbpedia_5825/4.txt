The first of the Hannibal Lecter movies was Manhunter in 1986. Though the film included the “Hannibal the Cannibal” character, he was not played by the man who made this role famous, Anthony Hopkins. In 1991, director Jonathan Demme and Hopkins really brought Hannibal to life in beloved film, The Silence of the Lambs, which also famously featured Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling.

The Silence of the Lambs is the Hannibal film that has the most Oscars, but which do you think is the best? There is also the sequel, Hannibal, which also features Hopkins as the titular character, though this time Starling is played by Julianne Moore. In 2002, Red Dragon, the same book that inspired the film Manhunter, was revisited, this time with Hopkins as Hannibal, and Ed Norton as Agent Will Graham. Hannibal Rising is a bloody prequel, focused on the titular character in his youth.

If TV shows are more your jam, there’s Bryan Fuller’s Hannibal, which has developed a cult following. This iteration of the Thomas Harris story features memorable performances by Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal Lecter and Hugh Dancy as Will Graham. CBS series Clarice ignores the sequels, and picks up after the events of The Silence of the Lambs.
