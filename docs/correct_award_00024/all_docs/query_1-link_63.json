        "text": "Albert Einstein, born in the year 1879, was one of the well-known scientists of that era. He was a German physicist who is widely known for his theory of relativity and several other theories that were postulated by him. He was one of the most influential scientists of this generation. He won a Nobel prize for physics as well in the year 1921. However, Albert Einstein was one of the genius boys from a young age. He published his first paper when he was 16 years old. Moreover, he was also a lecturer who used to teach his students physics and mathematics. He was an inspiration to learn, grow and believe in yourself.\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in the small state of Ulm in Germany on the 14th of March 1879. He belongs to a middle-class Jewish family, and his father, Herman Einstein, was a featherbed dealer in his initial days. However, he moved on to set up an Electrochemical manufacturing base. Apart from his father, his family had Pauline Koch, who was his mother, and Maria Einstein, who was her sister and only sibling. However, his whole family shifted to Italy, where he had to complete his schooling. Later by the year 1896, he got a job at Swiss Federal Polytechnic school, where he taught physics and maths.\n\nAfter moving to Italy, he had to complete his schooling in the Swiss town of Arau, After which he continued his study and received his diploma as well as Ph.D. by the year 1905. Moreover, he also got a job as a technical assistant in the company named Swiss Patent Office. However, the education flow of Albert Einstein was not very smooth due to the downfall of his father’s business. Even though in such a condition, Albert continued his study and maintained the strong grounds to achieve his Ph.D. One of the fine facts is that Albert Einstein met Mileva Maric, who was a physics student who relocated from Serbia along with him, and she became his wife in the future.\n\nAlbert Einstein was one of those boys who used to be involved in their education and steadiest life. However, as a matter of fact, he found his future wife among one of his physics classmates. Mileva Merrick, who was a physics student who relocated from Serbia, came in contact with Albert Einstein, and later on, by the year 1903, they got married to each other. They were a happy couple with two sons and a daughter until the year 1919. In the year 1919, they both got divorced. However, in the same year, Albert married Elson Leventhal, who was his cousin. Whereas by the year 1936, Elsa died due to natural causes, and Albert didn’t marry any other woman after that.\n\nConsidering the fact of the scientific career of Albert Einstein, he had one of the leading and repeated figurines after World War Two under the world government moment. Before joining hands with doctor Jane Weissman at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Albert Einstein was also offered the opportunity of being the president of the state of Israel. Moreover, the paper that Einstein published in 1905 got the attention of one of the influential faces Max Planck. Lastly, Albert Einstein figured out a third of relativity by the end of November 1915. Moreover, he also had the upper hand in the photoelectric effect.\n\nIn the last days of his life, Albert Einstein was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, Due to which type on the 18th of April, 1955. Even after his death, His work is still under-recognized, and there are a number of scientists he’s working with under his thoughts and theories. Moreover, there are a number of Nobel prizes associated with a number of theories that have been postulated by Einstein in his early days. This new generation of scientists using this space ignites to verify as well as identify the cosmology of Albert Einstein.\n\nAdvert Einstein was one of the influential and well-known scientists of this generation. He was born and brought up by a middle-class family in the year 1879 in Germany; however, his family had to relocate to Italy, and he completed his education there. Has been a genius boy since his younger age. He had quite a great interest in studying and researching several aspects of physics. Therefore he came forward with the research paper that caught the eyes of the most influential scientists of that time, so stop, which led to the rise of Albert Einstein and his knowledge."
