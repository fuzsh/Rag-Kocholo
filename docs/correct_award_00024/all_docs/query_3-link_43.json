        "text": "Einstein was not only a visionary physicist but also a pre-eminent scientist whose theories and discoveries profoundly affected the way people viewed the universe. In this episode, Rusted Post Box traces the life journey of Albert Einstein through various philatelic, notaphily and numismatic issues. A global science icon, he brought to the world a fuller understanding of the interaction of space, time and gravity through his visionary papers.<br><br> Rusted Post Box is a series of docudramas that relates various stamps, coins and notes to significant historic events. With the help of the newly established online museum, www.mintageworld.com, this series aims at imparting knowledge and creating interest in the areas of Philately, Numismatics and Notaphily within the general public, collectors, students and scholars alike.<br><br> Promoted by the “Ultra” group, mintageworld.com is the first website of its kind in the world, where all the three fields have been brought under one roof."
