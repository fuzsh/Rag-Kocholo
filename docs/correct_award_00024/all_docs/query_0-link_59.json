        "text": "The fact that Einstein did not receive the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity, which revolutionized theoretical and experimental physics, is perceived by many as the greatest disgrace of the Nobel Prize per se. It is often compared to the way Gandhi did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nNote that Einstein still received the Nobel Prize in 1922, though for an entirely different work. The wording of the Nobel Committee read: “For the discovery of the photoelectric effect and other works in theoretical physics.\n\nThe photoelectric effect discovered by Einstein is considered by many to be the least important of his discoveries. Einstein published his series of revolutionary articles for physics in 1905. Einstein’s articles laid the foundation for three branches of modern physics: general and special relativity, quantum mechanics, and statistical physics.\n\nIt took 17 years for them to be universally recognized. Einstein was nominated for the Nobel Prize for ten consecutive years and only in 1922 did the Nobel Committee consider it possible to give the prize to Einstein."
