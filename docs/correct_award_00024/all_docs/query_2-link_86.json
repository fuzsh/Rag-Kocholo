        "text": "When you hear the name Albert Einstein, you automatically think “Genius”. Albert Einstein was a physicist, philosopher, mathematician, Nobel-prize winner, violinist and a scientist. He is most notably known for his theory of relativity, which has become one of the two pillars of modern physics. Einstein was one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century because he recognized the importance of taking risks and was not afraid to make bold knowledge claims. Even though his left-field ideas were initially met with skepticism, Einstein is now credited to have completely revolutionized our understanding of space and time.\n\nEinstein approached science through an atypical method, often grounding his claims in thought-experiments instead of relying on abstract equations. He understood that imagination and thinking outside of the box were vital ingredients to innovation. The ‘box’ that had come to be accepted by most was Isaac Newton’s theory of classical mechanics, which suggested that matter and energy have definite attributes that do not change, irrespective of speed or location.1 Classical mechanics seemed like a “common-sense” approach to physics, but Einstein showed us that the world as it appears to human beings may not be the world as it functions at all.\n\nOne of Albert Einstein’s most notable contributions to physics was his theory of relativity. The theory of relativity is composed of two sub-theories, one named general relativity and the other special relativity.\n\nEinstein’s theory of relativity changed the way that time, motion and gravity were understood. It is based on two important ideas: the principle of relativity, which states that a body moving at a constant velocity acts according to the same laws as a body at rest, and the principle of the speed of light, which states that the speed of light is the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion to the light.3\n\nBut what do those two principles actually mean? They mean that we can only measure motion relative to a given frame of reference, instead of motion being an absolute, like Isaac Newton had believed.\n\nThe equation for speed is: speed = distance/time\n\nThis means that if speed changes according to one frame of reference, then distance and/or time must also change.\n\nEinstein used a thought-experiment to flesh out his theory of relativity. He described a scenario where one person is moving at a constant speed on a train, and another is standing on the station platform watching the train. Two bolts of lighting strike either end of the train as the midpoint of the train is directly in front of the person on the platform. Since the laws of physics are the same for someone at a constant speed and someone at rest, both observers must agree on the speed of light.4\n\nThe lightning strikes at the front and back of the train are the same distance away from the person on the platform, meaning that each reaches his/her eye at the same time. That person would therefore say that the lightning strikes happened at the same time.4\n\nHowever, because the train is moving, for the person on the train, the light from the strike at the end of the train reaches their eye a bit later. Since the distances that the light strikes travel are different, the time must be as well. For the person on the train, the lightning strikes happened one after the other. So, who is right?\n\nAccording to Einstein, both are right. Einstein called this phenomenon special relativity, which showed that time is relative to each observer at a different reference point.\n\nSince special relativity only described the ways that things in constant motion behaved, Einstein wanted to expand relativity to encompass acceleration and gravity. Einstein concluded that acceleration and gravity were different forms of the same thing, allowing him to come up with what is commonly thought of as the world’s most famous equation:\n\ne= mc2 (energy= mass x speed of light2)\n\nEinstein came to this conclusion with another thought-experiment. Imagine an object is sitting at rest and emits two pulses of light in opposite directions. Since each pulse carries energy, the object itself must lose some energy.4 Einstein then questioned how this scenario would look to a moving observer. The speed of the two beams of light has to look the same, since the speed of light is constant, meaning that the amount of energy each beam carried has to be different. Since e= mc2 , then if energy is different, mass must be a little different too.4\n\nFrom this equation, Einstein concluded gravity had to be determined by more than mass and distance (as Isaac Newton had suggested); it also had to be affected by time. Einstein concluded that space and time were not separate, leading to the concept of spacetime.\n\nEinstein believed his scientific revelations had significance for the way that people think about time in general:\n\n“Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. That’s relativity.”[5]\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany, on March 14th 1879.6 Despite being an icon in the scientific world today, Einstein’s genius was not apparent in all areas of his early education. He thrived in science, mathematics and music, but struggled in the languages and was actually a bit of a rebellious student.7 He even dropped out of high school before returning to education later at the Swiss Polytechnic Institute in Zurich (that doesn’t mean you should drop out! – see the survivorship bias to find out why).8\n\n1905 was an important year for Einstein. He published four papers that came to be known as the annus mirabilis papers, meaning “miracle year” in Latin.8 These papers explained special relativity, the existence of atoms, and the photoelectric effect, and led to Einstein receiving his PhD from the University of Zurich.8\n\nEinstein’s theory on the photoelectric effect was another of his great contributions to science. It was built on an idea put forward by German physicist Max Planck, who believed that light waves were not continuous and instead consisted of bundles of energy called photons.9 From Planck’s initial ideas, Einstein concluded that the frequency of a wave of light hitting a metal was what determined how many electrons were emitted from the metal, where previously, scientists had thought the amplitude of the light was what affected its ability to disrupt electrons in the metal.10 This theory earned Einstein the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.11\n\nUnderstanding the photoelectric effect was the beginning of what is known today as the quantum revolution, allowing us to better understand the behavior of matter and energy on an atomic and subatomic level.12 The entire computer and smartphone industry is built based on the knowledge gained from quantum physics, as are GPS systems and MRI scanners. Einstein’s willingness to step outside the box has led to, and continues to lead to, scientific breakthroughs that have benefited us all.13"
