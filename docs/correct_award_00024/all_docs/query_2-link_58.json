        "text": "The Nobel Prize\n\nEinstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect and for \"Merits in theoretical physics\". The mystery was why it had taken so long for the greatest physics of his generation received this greatest tribute in physics. Einstein was passed in 1920 because of the massive wave of publicity that followed the confirmation of his general theory of relativity. In 1921, the Nobel Committee chose not to award a prize that year. Only in 1922 did the committee see reason to award him the 1921 prize. Einstein's reaction was typical, he went to Japan and did not personally accept the award.\n\nRelativity\n\nEinstein had always expected to win the Nobel Prize someday. He was so convinced that when negotiating the divorce with Mileva in 1918 he offered her the full amount of a future Nobel Prize. The 1921 price was 121,572 Swedish kronor, or $32,250 - nowadays, approximately $400,000. Whether he has ever kept this promise is historically doubted by historians. Evidence found in 2006 shows that Einstein instead invested a large portion of the money and then lost it in the economically noisy period of the Great Depression.\n\nThe 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for the photoelectric effect and the possibly deliberately vague formulation of \"merits in theoretical physics\" was the only Nobel Prize to be awarded. Perhaps one of the greatest injustices in science is that the Nobel Committee has never acknowledged its theory of relativity. Together with quantum theory, it turned out to be one of the two major pillars of 20th-century physics. Einstein has been nominated many times for his special theory of relativity from 1905 between 1910 and 1922. However, he never won, because his theory was so revolutionary that the committee claimed the supporting evidence was too thin. Posthumous nominations are not allowed, so there will be no Nobel Prize for Albert Einstein's greatest spiritual achievement.\n\nOther prices"
