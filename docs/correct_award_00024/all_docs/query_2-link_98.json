        "text": "Albert Einstein (1879-1955) is considered the most creative scientific genius of modern times. He questioned the obvious and marveled at nature's mysteries while changing our understanding of the world. “Imagination is more important than knowledge,” he said. He was a master of both. He forever changed the laws of physics with his formula E=mc2, proving that energy and mass are different forms of the same thing. A kind, gentle, and absent-minded professor who rarely wore socks and seldom combed his hair, he became one of the world’s most visible supporters of peace and human rights. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 and named Person of the Century by Time Magazine in 1999. His name is now another word for “genius.”\n\nLearn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.\n\nThe important thing is to not stop questioning.—Albert Einstein\n\nE=mc²\n\n(By Jonathan Sprout and Dave Kinnoin)\n\nHe was a simple man of curiosity\n\nWho took a second look at what no one else could see.\n\nHe followed logic along imagination’s path.\n\nWith ever-twinkling eyes beneath that crazy hair,\n\nHe saw a universe of questions waiting there\n\nAnd found the answers to nature’s mysteries using math.\n\nA simple desk and chair, an out-the-window stare,\n\nCrumpled papers in the trash,\n\nA brain that could not quit, and scientific grit,\n\nThen in a flash…\n\nRefrain: E=mc².\n\nEven Einstein was not prepared\n\nFor the formula that loudly declared he was a genius!\n\nIt was this dreamer who found the key\n\nTo a secret so we all could see\n\nThe true definition of energy.\n\nE=mc².\n\nHis violin was handy. Sometimes you can’t resist\n\nA bit of fun distraction when you’re a physicist.\n\nThe man knew everything, but kept his brilliance in disguise.\n\nHe said he had no talents, yet he was born to think.\n\nKnew how to fix equations, but not the kitchen sink.\n\nBecame a pacifist and won a Nobel Prize.\n\nA formal dinner tux, applause, and lots of bucks—\n\nEverybody screamed his name.\n\nIt was his work with light that made his day that night.\n\nHear the acclaim!\n\nRefrain\n\nBridge: Six hundred seventy-one million miles per hour squared,\n\nMultiplied by mass. What would that be?\n\nRefrain\n\n©2014 Kanukatunes (ASCAP) and Song Wizard Music (ASCAP)\n\nLead vocal: Jonathan Sprout\n\nDrum programming, string programming, schmaltz violin: Joe Mennonna\n\nBass: Al Renino\n\nGuitar: Jimmy Hammer, Leslie Chew, and Jonathan Sprout\n\nKeyboards: Joe Mennonna and Jimmy Hammer\n\nBackground vocals: Jimmy Hammer and Susie Stevens\n\nKey Words:\n\nPhysics ~ a branch of science that deals with matter (a physical substance that occupies space) and energy (what is required to perform work). Einstein was a physicist. He was an expert in physics.\n\nE=mc2~ an equation where E represents units of energy and m represents units of mass; c2 is the speed of light multiplied by itself. This is the formula that Albert Einstein developed. It shows that a small amount of matter can release a huge amount of energy, and it is called the “Theory of Relativity.”\n\nAbsent-minded professor ~ someone who is often forgetful or inattentive. Einstein was often so engaged in what he was thinking that he did not pay attention to the things going on around him -- and he was constantly thinking! He was filled with curiosity, and he was always asking questions.\n\nNobel Prize ~ an international prize awarded each year in the fields of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, economics, and the promotion of peace. The first Nobel Prize was given in 1901. Einstein’s Nobel Prize was awarded for “his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect,” not for his Theory of Relativity.\n\nGenius ~ a person who is exceptionally intelligent. Einstein was considered a genius. If you say someone is “an Einstein,” you mean he/she is really, really smart!"
