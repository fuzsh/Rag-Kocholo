        "text": "Charles of Bourbon is commonly recognized as the first King of Naples of the Bourbon dynasty and the principal restorer of the Kingdom. However, it should be noted that the first ruler of the dynasty to rule in Southern Italy was his father Philip V, who ascended the throne of Madrid in 1700. During the long War of the Spanish Succession, Philip lost the viceroyalty of Naples and Sicily in 1707 to of the Habsburgs of Austria, despite his victory in the war and his effective control over Spain. The Habsburgs maintained control of Naples and Sicily until 1734, when Charles of Bourbon, son of Philip V and his second wife Elisabetta Farnese, regained the Neapolitan viceroyalty with the diplomatic support of his mother. Charles thus became the effective ruler and assumed the title of Charles King of Naples, restoring the autonomy of the Kingdom of Naples and making it an independent and sovereign nation.\n\nCharles of Bourbon abdicated the Throne of Naples in 1759 to ascend to that of Madrid, separating the two crowns. His son Ferdinand, only eight years old, was named heir to Naples and entrusted to a Council of Regency which continued the reformist policy initiated by Charles of Bourbon in collaboration with Madrid. This period was characterized by the famous Bourbon reformism, which Ferdinand continued until the advent of the revolution. An example of this reformist policy was the Statute of San Leucio, considered the first form of socialism and equality between men and women.\n\nIn 1768 Ferdinand married Maria Carolina of Austria, daughter of Empress Maria Theresa of Habsburg, and with her he had 18 children. His wife exerted a great influence on Ferdinand’s political choices, especially after the birth of their firstborn Francesco. The clash with Tanucci led to his replacement with Prince John Acton, who brought the Kingdom under British influence. Despite the break with Madrid, the reform process continued, influenced by the monarchs’ parents, Charles of Bourbon and Maria Teresa.\n\nDue to the French Revolution, the reform policy in Italy suffered an interruption due to the change in attitude of the Neapolitan rulers towards political innovations. After 1794, Ferdinand and Maria Carolina realized that the Enlightenment intellectuals and Freemasons were plotting against them. Despite some attempts at conciliation with the French Republic, Ferdinand joined the international anti-revolutionary and anti-Napoleonic coalitions, remaining faithful to the alliance with the English.\n\nSince 1796, the young Napoleon Buonaparte gradually invaded and conquered most of the territories of the Italian states, everywhere encountering the spontaneous armed revolt of the Italian populations who rose up in defense of the legitimate secular sovereigns and governments.\n\nIn February 1798 the revolutionary armies invaded the Papal States, causing the flight of Pius VI and establishing the Jacobin Roman Republic. In November, Ferdinand, aware that the Napoleonics were now only missing the Kingdom of Naples to complete the conquest of Italy, decided to wage war on the French.\n\nFerdinand’s proclamation of 8 December 1798 incited his subjects to resist armedly against the French. Thousands of people, men, women and elderly people, followed the proclamation and fought for six months until the Kingdom was reconquered. However, the French conquered Naples on 22 January 1799, massacring 10,000 insurgents (the famous Lazarus). In the meantime, the Court had moved to Palermo and King Ferdinand had left Naples under the control of a council of aristocrats and the Royal Vicar Pignatelli.\n\nIn Naples, the Republic was established by the Jacobins, who attempted to implement republican reforms in the provinces, but with limited results. Popular discontent and loyalty to the dynasty were evident everywhere, manifesting themselves in an increasingly threatening way.\n\nCardinal Fabrizio Ruffo of the Princes of Scylla presented a bold project to the King of Naples to reconquer the Kingdom of Naples with the support of the local populations. Despite initial doubts, the King granted the Cardinal the title of King’s Vicar for the Kingdom of Naples and a single ship with seven men. However, Ruffo managed to mobilize an army of tens of thousands of volunteers from all over the Kingdom, founding the “Christian and Royal Army” in the name of Ferdinand IV. This army triumphed in Naples on 13 June 1799, restoring the Bourbon monarchy.\n\nKing Ferdinand and Queen Maria Carolina returned to the Throne of Naples in triumph, obtaining the full consent of the populations who had fought for them. From 1805 they reigned in peace, but were then hit by the Napoleonic storm.\n\nIn 1806 Napoleon conquered the Kingdom of Naples and placed his brother Giuseppe on the throne. The Royal family moved to Palermo and the Sanfedist guerrilla war began, which lasted until 1810 and in particular in Calabria until the Restoration.\n\nIn 1808, Napoleon issued a decree from Paris ordering Joseph to go to Madrid, while appointing Joachim Murat, his brother-in-law, as ruler of the Kingdom of Naples. Murat remained on the throne until 1815, when the European Restoration occurred. However, in 1815, Murat, desperate for the defeat of the restoration forces, attempted a last desperate action by landing in Calabria and encouraging the peasants to rebel armed against the Bourbons. Unfortunately, he was captured and shot in Pizzo Calabro after being incarcerated in the local castle.\n\nMany intellectuals today describe this Kingdom of the Two Sicilies as the third economic power of Europe, with Naples as the capital of European culture and innovation along with Paris and London. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies were annexed to the Kingdom of the dynasty Savoy after being invaded without any declaration of war. The Savoys, almost went in bankrupt, were supported by English Freemasonry, which provided men, military equipment and money (to be used to bribe the Bourbon generals), that helped them to invade the very rich Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which at the time held 60% of all Italian wealth, and was made of gold and silver coins, not paper banknotes.\n\nThe UK did it because the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, thanks to its central position in the Mediterranean, and its large fleet, it would be greatly benefited from the opening of the new Suez Canal (1869), which allowed direct access to Southeast Asia to no more have to circumnavigate Africa. Naples would become the main commercial hub between Europe and the Indies, an area ruled by UK, and so the UK should have used Naples, a rival State, to go to its Asian areas;\n\nThe Savoys, instead, just done this to take possession of the wealth of the Two Sicilies to avoid bankruptcy, paying off their debts with banks. They were not really interested to Unitification, the Savoy family not even spoke the italian language, but French.\n\nObviously it is a very controversial story, never officially investigated.\n\nBelow you can read a common introduction to the italian unification typical of history school books. In this case there is a description of the general economical conditions of the 1861 pre-unification italian Kingdoms. The first part talks about the northern italy, the highlighted part is the one dedicated to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the remaining talks about the Kingdom of Sardinia. The highlighted part says:\n\n“. . . Especially in Southern Italy the politics of the Bourbon, was expression of interests of the big landowners (so-called barons), and did little or nothing for the modernization of agriculture, and to boost manufacturing activities. Just think that in 1854 only 700. 000 ducats were spent for public works (roads, railways, ports, commercial ports), while military spending exceeded 13 million. “"
