        "text": "Rare signed and partially hand written letter dated Naples 4th October 1802 regarding her debts from Maria Carolina of Austria (13 August 1752 - 8 September 1814). She was Queen of Naples and Sicily as the wife of King Ferdinand IV & III. As de facto ruler of her husband's kingdoms, Maria Carolina oversaw the promulgation of many reforms, including the revocation of the ban on Freemasonry, the enlargement of the navy under her favourite, John Acton, 6th Baronet, and the expulsion of Spanish influence. She was a proponent of enlightened absolutism until the advent of the French Revolution, when, in order to prevent its ideas gaining currency, she made Naples a police state.\n\nBorn an Austrian archduchess, the thirteenth child of Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Francis I, she married Ferdinand as part of an Austrian alliance with Spain, where Ferdinand's father was King. Following the birth of a male heir in 1775, Maria Carolina was admitted to the Privy Council. Thereafter, she dominated it until 1812, when she was sent back to Vienna. Like her mother, Maria Carolina took pains to make politically advantageous marriages for her children. A patron, Maria Carolina promoted Naples as a centre of the arts, patronising painters Jacob Philipp Hackert and Angelica Kauffman and academics Gaetano Filangieri, Domenico Cirillo and Giuseppe Maria Galanti. Maria Carolina, abhorring her sister Marie Antoinette's treatment by the French, allied Naples with Britain and Austria during the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary Wars.\n\nAs a result of a failed Neapolitan invasion of French-occupied Rome, she fled to Sicily with her husband in December 1798. One month later, the Parthenopean Republic was declared, which repudiated Bourbonic rule in Naples for six months. The young republic ended when the Sanfedisti, the army led by Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, attacked and invaded Naples on 21st June 1799. The collapse of the republic was largely due to the English fleet, which had supplied the royal army with weapons. It was Admiral Nelson who successfully defeated the French in the middle of 1799 from Naples and Sicily securing the throne for the Royal couple.\n\nIn June 1800, Maria Carolina traveled with her three unmarried daughters, her younger son Leopoldo, and accompanied by William and Emma Hamilton and Nelson over Livorno, Florence, Trieste and Laibach to Vienna, where she arrived two months later. Maria Carolina stayed two years in her homeland, where she arranged advantageous marriages for her children.After her stay in Vienna, Maria Carolina returned to Naples on 17 August 1802. Her daughter Maria Isabelle died the previous year aged 8 years old.\n\nThis letter in French is written just two months after her return to Naples, subscribed and signed by her with a four line postscript in her own hand. She has also signed \"Charlotte\" as here when writing in French and Carolina when writing in Italian.\n\nShe was deposed for a second time as Queen of Naples by French forces in 1806, Maria Carolina died in Vienna in 1814, a year before her husband's restoration to Naples.\n\n\"My dear Boeham\n\nI will not let the post go without giving you a token of my remembrance & esteem. I am now in a very pitiable condition. It is not enough that the grief which has made me feel the separation from my Daughter, and the cruel anxiety the loss of another dear daughter has opened the wound of my afflicition. You will judge of the Effect this new misfortune has had upon me, and will pity me. I am certain. Recieve my tahnks for both for your attention and for your attachment which I shall never forget & believe me faithfully\n\nYour grateful\n\nCharlotte\n\nYou can judge of my sadness, affliction cannot say Thy will be done and ardently desire it, write me word. How much my debts in money are to you, those of gratitude feel, but pay nothing of it such is my position, and believe me always\"\n\nSize: 23.5 x 19 cm approx"
