        "text": "Ferdinand I of Naples 1751-1825\n\nFerdinand's father Charles III became king of Spain in 1759. This made eight-year-old Ferdinand\n\nKing Ferdinand IV of Naples\n\nand\n\nKing Ferdinand III of Sicily.\n\nIn 1768, Ferdinand married Marie Caroline of Austria (or Maria Carolina,) sister of French Queen Marie Antoinette, who would lose her head in France in 1793. Consequently, Ferdinand and Marie Caroline did all they could to stop French revolutionaries.\n\nThe year 1799 kept Ferdinand on his toes. The French took Naples in January and set up the Parthenopean Republic. Ferdinand and Marie C fled to Sicily. Horatio Nelson helped the couple recapture Naples later in 1799.\n\nAll was well until Napoleon re-re-captured Naples, which meant that Ferdinand and Marie Caroline had to pack their bags yet again. The year? 1806.\n\nFinally in 1815, Ferdinand was king again.\n\nAnd in 1816, he declared himself king of the Two Sicilies, which he remained until his death.\n\nFerdinand's son Francis I became his successor.\n\nWEE FERDINAND READY TO RULE\n\n1760\n\nMore History"
