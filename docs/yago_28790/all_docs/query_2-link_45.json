        "text": "He also commissioned Luigi Vanvitelli to build a lavish palace in Caserta, to compete with Versailles. Charles’ prudent approach to foreign policy, which helped him to stay on the throne during the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years’ War, together with the policy of secularisation implemented in agreement with the other Bourbon monarchies, were a good example of enlightened absolutism and marked an era of undoubted progress for Southern Italy.\n\nCharles reluctantly left Naples after his elder brother, Ferdinand VI of Spain, died with no successor. The king, having promulgated the Pragmatic Sanction of 1759 governing the hereditary relations between the kingdoms of Spain and Naples, was forced to leave for Madrid together with his queen and their first-born, also named Charles. Naples and Sicily were left to the third son Ferdinand, just eight years old.\n\nThe second Sicilian period (1806-1815), caused by another French invasion of Southern Italy, led to the island being given its own constitution in 1812, by Prince Regent Francis. The constitution was the first of its kind to be granted in Italy outside the Napoleonic system.\n\nIn 1815, Ferdinand was able to return to Naples definitively, accompanied by his minister Luigi de’ Medici, who the following year oversaw the merger of two states into one: the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The decision provoked Sicilian resentment, while a number of young officers linked to the Carbonari fomented the rebellion of 1820. Ferdinand managed to resolve the situation thanks to the support of European powers, who gathered at the Congress of Laibach (Ljubljana) and decided to send the Austrian army to the South. Ferdinand died on 4 January 1825 at the age of 73, after a reign lasting more than sixty years.\n\nDuring his short five-year reign, King Francis I continued his father’s policies, under the guidance of the minister Medici. In 1827, he obtained the withdrawal of the Austrian expeditionary forces still stationed in the kingdom. A lover of science and botany, Francis introduced new systems of cultivation, irrigation and breeding, by promoting agriculture, his great passion. Shortly before his death in 1829, he established the Royal Order of Francis I, a precursor of today’s civil orders of merit, which rewarded those who distinguished themselves in culture, science or public service.\n\nAlmost a century later, the realm once again had a twenty-year-old ruler, when Ferdinand II took the throne on 8 November 1830. At a time when England and France had begun their industrialisation, symbolised by the invention of the railway, King Francis was supporting the construction of\n\nItaly’s first railway: the Naples-Portici line, built in 1839. This was followed by a series of firsts in many different fields, including the inauguration of the steelworks in Pietrarsa, the first steamship company in the Mediterranean and the Vesuvius Observatory. During the revolts of 1848, Ferdinand was the first king in Italy to grant a constitution. However, the experiment with Parliament was unsuccessful and within a few months the system had reverted to absolutism, while Sicilian independence was repressed. The king died in the Royal Palace in Caserta on 22 May 1859.\n\nAfter the Act of Cannes in 1900, the rights of succession passed to Alfonso’s son Ranieri, Duke of Castro (1883-1973) and then to the Duke’s descendants: his son Ferdinand (1926-2008) and grandson Carlo (1963), who is now committed to continuing the story and legacy of a kingdom and dynasty, combining tradition and innovation within a modern European monarchy. This is the context for Prince Charles’ historic decision in 2016 to disregard the Salic law and to refer instead to the European law prohibiting discrimination between men and women, by naming his first-born Princess Maria Carolina, Duchess of Calabria, as his legitimate heir."
