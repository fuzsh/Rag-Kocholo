        "text": "I think that that would be entirely possible, given that your Fernandino government generally followed a neutral non-aggression policy. It would be interesting to see if the American Revolution breaks out what Spain would do, since as a result of Ricardo Wall's influence on the Ferdinand VI, Spain was probably more pro-English than it had been since pre-Reformation.\n\nI think Isabel Farnese would then be forced to concede that either her period of influence was over in Madrid, where the one ambassador wrote \"It is Barbara (of Portugal) who succeeds Isabel (Farnese) rather than Fernand who succeeds Felipe\". Or she'll relocate to Naples (if the Spanish still conquer that for OTL Carlos III) or Florence, and continue her plotting and scheming there.\n\nAlso, no Family Compact would drastically change the network of alliances in 18th century Europe. And without Carlos III, and Spain's involvement in the 7YW, Maria Theresia would be unlikely to decide on the Bourbon-Hapsburg alliance as OTL since \"she hates France, and shows it when it would be most to her advantage\" as the Prussian ambassador wrote, and she saw the Bourbons as usurpers in Naples - so why would she feel any differently about the Spanish Ferdinandine branch?\n\nI think that that would be entirely possible, given that your Fernandino government generally followed a neutral non-aggression policy.

I mean continuing the internal reforms of Fernando was smart and necessary but Fernando's foreign policy wasn't gonna be necessarily repeated.\n\nThough I'm not sure about Isabel. She might say stay in Spain or more likely head to Naples.\n\nAs for Maria Theresa, I can't see HOW this would effect any alliance with France. Maria Theresa had no choice but to ally with France after Britain abandoned her for Prussia. The main foreign policy goal of her reign was to regain Silesia, not Naples and Sicily. And thinking that the Neapolitan Bourbon's were usurpers didn't stop her from marrying her daughter to the King of the Two Sicilies, now did it?\n\nIsabel is not necessarily going to relocate. She stayed in Spain during Ferdinand's OTL reign (possibly since she knew when he died, one of her children would succeed). That might change. In fact, much might change, given that after your POD is the Dauphin and Madame Louise-Elisabeth's marriage to Maria Teresa and Infante Felipe.\n\nHence, because of this, there are no grandchildren of Louis XV and Isabel Farnese to marry the children of Maria Theresa. Should have interesting knock-on effects, i.e. will the Dauphin then marry one of Ferdinand VI's daughter instead of his sister, and Madame Henriette (who was originally proposed as a match for the now widowed Ferdinand) might not be offered then.\n\nI agree with you about Isabel. She might decide to stay in Spain, though with little to no chance of one of her sons becoming King of Spain she might decide to head to Naples.\n\nThough I will have to disagree with you about the French-Spanish marriage. WHY would the match not happen? The Infanta was closer to the Dauphins age, and Philip V was still King. So Philip is more likely to marry his daughter to the Dauphin than his young granddaughter.\n\nWhat no one has talked about is what would change with Carlos remaining in Naples? He undertook massive reforms in Spain so what changes could be done in Naples, if he ruled there for nearly 50 years?\n\nI think it could, after all Joseph Bonaparte found it easier to enact reforms in Naples than to enact those same reforms from Madrid. Naples might climb as high as Maria Carolina of Austria schemed with John Acton to - navy, army, world power status etc.\n\nAs to the realtionship between Fernando and Isabel, I think it would've been fine until Barbara got there. After all, Barbara and Isabel were two sides to the same coin, but at the same time, I could see clashes between them much like as between Empresses Elisabeth and Charlotte, of which one contemporary said \"for two suns cannot shine in the same sky\".\n\nIsabel may have been tolerated by a childless Barbara, but throw children into that mix, and it could get ugly. Barbara would be ambitious for her children, not her in-laws, which would set her at odds to Isabel.\n\nAlso, Naples was conquered while Felipe V was still king of Spain (albeit for the second time), so probably no change there. And the stillbirth that Barbara had was a male child, so that is our POD.\n\nAnd any infanta born, is more likely to be Maria Luisa (after Fernando's mother) or Maria Ana (after Barbara's) than Isabel (after the queen [note: none of Isabel's daughters bore the name Isabel among their names, Mariana Vittoria (after Philip's mother), Maria Teresa Rafaela (after his grandmother), and Maria Antonieta Fernanda.]) Maybe a second or third daughter would be Isabel (I'm never to sure with royal naming of the 18th century, so tend to err on the side of caution), or a first born daughter might be Maria Ana Isabel or Maria Luisa Isabel.\n\n\"Just a thought. Who would the children of Fernando VI and Barbara marry? I mean if Spain had a neutrality policy any marriage for their children could be seen as leaning one way or the other. So would the marriages be more likely to be Austrian, Portuguese, French, Neapolitan or perhaps Savoy?\"\n\nWell, they would be rather late to catch the flood of Italian princesses on the marriage market (Savoy and Modena both had predominantly 1720s births for surviving girls), and Portugal, Parma and Naples would all be first cousins (double first cousins in Portugal's case), so that might make it rather difficult genetically further down the line.\n\nPerhaps one of the younger sisters of the Queen of Naples and the Dauphine? Likewise, there are two Bavarian princesses available. I don't know of any other Catholic princesses (and Spain only got it's first non-Catholic born queen with Ena of Battenberg) available.\n\nWhat about a French match? Louis XV's youngest daughters, Madame Sophie and Madame Louise, would be the right age."
