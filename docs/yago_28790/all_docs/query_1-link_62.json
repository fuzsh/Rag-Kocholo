        "text": "And of course, the Circolo di Conversazione, all red velvet and gold, without which this book would not exist, may be found in the old baroque town of Ragusa, one hour west of Syracuse:\n\nThe Circle of Conversation in Ragusa (Sicily)\n\nTwo round-eyed lions sit on its neoclassical frontispiece with a hieratic eagle between them, just like in the novel:\n\n…and no, you won’t find any Circolo in Syracuse’s old Ortigia. That was poetic license.\n\n2. The people: people Tony Luna meets in the Circolo di Conversazione are either historical or closely modeled after historical characters. Let’s start with Eloisa. She is modeled after Eloisa Bonanno, the heroin of the fall of the Castle of Judica in 1130. She was in fact enslaved by the Saracens and kept a prisoner in the fortress of Judica, a place very similar to this one, although nobody has found it (it has disappeared without a trace, or so the historians say…):\n\nShe is said to have opened the castle doors to her brothers’ troops who were coming from Caltagirone. It is a fact that Judica was the last major Saracen fortress to fall in the hands of the Normans, thus completing their conquest of Sicily, after over three centuries of Arab domination. While Eloisa was viewed as a romantic figure in 19th century Sicily and the subject of several (bad) novels, little else is known about her.\n\nThe zoo of the Villa Floridiana that is the setting of a heart-breaking incident in the book (no spoilers!), did exist, and the King had purchased at great cost wild animals, including kangaroos, the first time anyone had seen them in Italy. They were purchased from the English in return for precious papyri that had been dug up at Herculaneum – the subject of a scandal and much acrimony voiced by those who opposed the monarchy.Much of the life and love of the King for the Duchess can be evinced from the numerous letters he wrote to her while he was away hunting. They are filled with intimate details – for example, he didn’t go to theatre because of an attack of “cacarella” (sic); he slept badly because all his “nerves were pulling” . But whatever monies he won at card games, he sent her; whatever he shot, birds or boars, he also sent her, at times filling the kitchen of the Villa Floridiana to the brim with animal carcasses.\n\nII. What is nearly true in Luna Rising:\n\nFrancis Leckie: there is an Englishman of that name who settled in Sicily around the early 1800s. He could have met the Duchess of Floridia. Whether he actually did meet her is not known, and whether he actually fell in love with her, if true, is a well-kept secret.What is known is that around 1801, he acquired from the local church – the Bishop of Syracuse – the right to exploit the Tremilia lands, a short ride from both Syracuse and Floridia. Documents attest to this contract. Little is known of Francis Leckie, beyond the fact that he was the son of a City of London merchant. To be allowed to rent Tremilia, he was forced to convert to Catholicism and change his name to Francesco. He went bankrupt when at the end of the Napoleonic wars the British troops, who had been the main purchasers of his produce, left the island. He ceded his leasing rights to Tremilia to Giuseppe Bonanno, a cousin of the Duchess of Floridia. This Bonanno had many children (exactly as he complains in the novel) and died a very wealthy man, in 1822.\n\nNicchia, or Virginia Oldoini, the “divine countess” or “vulva d’oro del Risorgimento” (the “golden vulva”– a crude reference to her affair with Napoleon III) is such a well-known historical character that there is no need to go into the details here. Except for one juicy piece of gossip: she was said to be the daughter of Luigi Grifeo who used to spend summers in Florence and had met Nicchia’s mother in a moment when the latter had been abandoned by her husband. Whether true or not, in this book it opens for her the doors of the Circolo di Conversazione, turning her into Lùzia’s grand daughter.\n\nIII. What is pure invention:"
