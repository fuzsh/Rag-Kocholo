        "text": "Prince Jaime of Bourbon-Two-Sicilies has tied the knot with Lady Charlotte Lindesay-Bethune in a stunning ceremony in southern Italy on Saturday.\n\nThe Duke of Noto married Lady Charlotte at The Cathedral of Monreale, nearby the town of Palermo, with the bride donning an elegant white gown featuring a lace bodice and a diamond and pearl tiara once belonging to Archduchess María Anna of Austria.\n\nCharlotte, 28, is the youngest daughter of Scottish businessman James Lindesay-Bethune, 16th Earl of Lindsay, and Diana Mary Chamberlayne-Macdonald. The Duke, 29, is the heir apparent to Prince Pedro of Bourbon-Two-Sicilies and his wife, the former Doña Sofia.\n\nThe Royal House of Bourbon Two Sicilies - or Bourbon des Deux Siciles - is an ancient branch of the Spanish royal family which ruled parts of southern Italy for more than 100 years from 1734 to 1861. Its descendants still carry the name today, some 150 years later.\n\nAmong the high-profile guests was Princess Alexandra's granddaughter Flora Ogilvy, the Duke and Duchess of Huéscar and the wedding was blessed by Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, a German cardinal of the Catholic Church.\n\nPrince Pedro is a claimant to the now defunct throne of the former House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a cadet branch of the Spanish royal family, which descends from the Capetian Dynasty and ruled over Southern Italy and Sicily during the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nAlthough the family has no official remit, they spend their time doing charity work and promoting the interest of Southern Italy.\n\nThe bride was a vision in white as she walked down the aisle in a sophisticated lace-detailed gown with a floor-length train and embroidered, long-sleeved bodice with transparent fabric revealing a separate white bodice with a sweetheart neckline underneath.\n\nHer brown tresses were styled into a sleek up do, concealing her floor-length veil, and she accessorised her elegant look with a pair of pearl teardrop earrings.\n\nIn a nod to her Scottish heritage, bridesmaids donned tartan sashes and sweet white flower crowns as they followed the bride up the cathedral steps.\n\nLady Charlotte is an Oxford graduate who works in investment at a London-based private equity firm. The couple are thought to live together in London.\n\nShe arrived in the cathedral square with her father, the politician James Randolph Lindesay-Bethune, in a carriage pulled by four white horses.\n\nEarl of Lindsay is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, with the family seat being the Lahill House, near Upper Largo, Fife. Lady Charlotte’s father, who currently holds the title, studied at Eton, the University of Edinburgh and the University of California.\n\nHe succeeded his father as Earl of Lindsay in 1989 and was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from 1995 to 1997.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2017, Lord Lindsay was President of the National Trust of Scotland and was appointed as President of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute in April 2021.\n\nHe married Diana Mary Chamberlayne-Macdonald, a granddaughter of Sir Alexander Somerled Angus Bosville Macdonald of Sleat, 16th Baronet in 1982 and they have five children.\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair Italy, some 200 guests were present at the ceremony, including many European noble descendants, and the bride and groom returned to Palermo after the wedding to enjoy cocktails in the gardens of the Royal Palace before dinner at the Palazzo Mazzarino.\n\nHowever the publication claim that, despite their good relationship, King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain did not attend the wedding because they are waiting on developments following the volcanic eruption in Le Palma last Sunday.\n\nThe wedding was conducted in four languages: Latin, Spanish, Italian, and English, with vows being read in English. The couple, who met in Sicily, announced their engagement in May and the new Duchess of Noto converted to Catholicism last year in a ceremony at the Vatican.\n\nAccording to Italian newspaper Italy24news, the happy couple were received by The Mayor of The Municipality of Monreale ahead of the wedding, who said it was 'a great honour to participate in this event that will remain in the history of Monreale.\n\n'The architectural and landscape beauties of our city have been enhanced by the fairytale atmosphere that the royal wedding created in a setting that we hope will remain in the hearts of the spouses, to whom I reserve the wish for a long and joyful life together by all the Monreales.'"
