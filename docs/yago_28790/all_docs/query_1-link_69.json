        "text": "The Napoleonic Wars are still reflected by works of art and products of arts and crafts, or any imprints of human creativity called Napoleonic memorabilia (or Napoleonics). Regarding the rich iconography of these objects we can create an idea of the events and personalities that at the turn of the 18th century and the 19th century were stirring the fate of Europe. It is a specific category of cultural heritage which functions as a mediator of historical memory with a clear reference to the contradictory character of Napoleon Bonaparte. His dizzying life story, which surprised and shocked the society at the same time, has been presented in numerous collections of castles and other manor residences for many centuries. Among the major historical events that influenced the collecting of these artefacts in the historical lands of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, besides military successes of Coalition in the Battle of Aspern and other battles in recent years of the Napoleonic wars, was also the marriage of the Emperor Napoleon I with the Austrian Archduchess Marie Louise, the factual alliance of the Austrian and French Imperial Houses. These events, their main actors and other participants, whether standing alongside or against France, provided artists with a variety of themes for their artistic interpretation. The birth of the successor of the French throne, the legitimate descendant of the Habsburg and Bonaparte dynasty, with the newly established title of the Roman King, meant one of the decisive inspirational impulses for the world of art and period iconography. Renowned events attended by the members of both Imperial Houses and the Czech nobility are still commemorated in iconography on a number of objects in château collections currently managed by the National Heritage Institute in the Czech Republic. These collections also preserved items from Napoleon's inheritance which were perceived by their former owners and noble collectors as relics or curiosities and, at the same time, a trace of great history, reminded in their ancestral memory."
