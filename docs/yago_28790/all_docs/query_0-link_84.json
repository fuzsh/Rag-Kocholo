        "text": "Ferdinand I (April 19,1793 – June 29,1875) was Emperor of Austria from March 1835 until his abdication in December 1848. He was also King Ferdinand V of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia (as ), King of Lombardy–Venetia and holder of many other lesser titles.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nEmperor Ferdinand was the eldest son of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor (Emperor Franz of Austria) and Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily the daughter of King Ferdinand IV of Naples who was King Ferdinand III of Sicily. On December 12, 1816, after the Napoleonic Wars, Ferdinand took advantage of the situation to abolish the Sicilian constitution, in violation of his oath, and to proclaim the union of the two states into the kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\n\nKing Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies was married to Archduchess Maria Caroline of Austria the daughter of and thirteenth child of Queen Maria Theresa of Hungary , Bohemia and Croatia, Archduchess of Austria and her husband Emperor Franz I Stefan of Lorraine.\n\nFerdinand’s parents were double first cousins as they shared all four grandparents (Franz’s paternal grandparents were his wife’s maternal grandparents and vice versa). Therefore, Ferdinand only had four great-grandparents, being descended from each of them twice. Further back in his ancestry there is more pedigree collapse due to the close intermarriage between the Houses of Austria and Spain and other Catholic monarchies.\n\nEmperor Ferdinand had hydrocephalus, neurological problems including epilepsy, and a speech impediment. He was educated by Baron Josef Kalasanz von Erberg, and his wife Countess Josephine von Attems.\n\nFerdinand succeeded his father Emperor Franz of Austria upon his death on March 2, 1835. He was incapable of ruling the empire because of severe epilepsy, so his father, before he died, made a will promulgating that Ferdinand should consult his uncle Archduke Ludwig on all aspects of internal policy and urged him to be influenced by Prince Metternich, Austria’s Foreign Minister.\n\nFerdinand married Maria Anna of Savoy, the sixth was the penultimate child and daughter of King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia and his wife, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, who was the second child and first daughter of Archduke Ferdinand Karl of Austria, governor of Milan, and Maria Beatrice d’Este, heir to the Duchy of Modena. She was named after her paternal grandmother, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, as all eldest granddaughters of the empress were.\n\nWhen Ferdinand married Princess Maria Anna of Savoy, the court physician considered it unlikely that he would be able to consummate the marriage. When he tried to consummate the marriage, he had five seizures. He is also remembered for his command to his cook: when told he could not have apricot dumplings because apricots were out of season, he said “I am the Emperor, and I want dumplings!”\n\nRevolution of 1848\n\nThe Revolutions of 1848, known in some countries as the Springtime of the Peoples or the Springtime of Nations, were a series of revolutions throughout Europe over the course of more than one year, from 1848 to 1849. It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history to date.\n\nThe revolutions were essentially democratic and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing the old monarchical structures and creating independent nation-states, as envisioned by romantic nationalism. The revolutions spread across Europe after an initial revolution began in France in February when King Louis Philippe of the French was deposed.\n\nAlong with France the revolutions were most important in the Netherlands, Italy, the Austrian Empire, and the states of the German Confederation that would make up the German Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nOver 50 countries were affected, but with no significant coordination or cooperation among their respective revolutionaries. Some of the major contributing factors were widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership, demands for more participation in government and democracy, demands for freedom of the press, other demands made by the working class for economic rights, the upsurge of nationalism, the regrouping of established government forces, and the European Potato Failure, which triggered mass starvation, migration, and civil unrest.\n\nAs the revolutionaries of 1848 were marching on the palace, he is supposed to have asked Metternich for an explanation. When Metternich answered that they were starting a revolution, Ferdinand is supposed to have said “But are they allowed to do that?”\n\nHe was convinced by Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg to abdicate in favour of his nephew, Archduke Franz Joseph (the next in line was Ferdinand’s younger brother Archduke Franz Charles l, but he was persuaded to renounce his succession rights in favour of his son) who would occupy the Austrian throne for the next 68 years.\n\nFerdinand recorded the events in his diary: “The affair ended with the new Emperor kneeling before his old Emperor and Lord, that is to say, me, and asking for a blessing, which I gave him, laying both hands on his head and making the sign of the Holy Cross … then I embraced him and kissed our new master, and then we went to our room. Afterwards I and my dear wife heard Holy Mass … After that I and my dear wife packed our bags.”\n\nIn retirement (1848–1875)\n\nFerdinand was the last King of Bohemia to be crowned as such. Due to his sympathy with Bohemia (where he spent the rest of his life in Prague Castle) he was given the Czech nickname “Ferdinand V, the Good. ” In Austria, Ferdinand was similarly nicknamed “Ferdinand the Benign.\n\nFerdinand was also the last ruler to be crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy in his capacity as King of Lombardy-Venetia.\n\nFerdinand died on June 29, 1875 and he is interred in tomb number 62 in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.\n\nMaria Anna of Savoy (September 19, 1803 – May 4, 1884) was Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary by marriage to Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria.\n\nBiography\n\nMaria Anna was born in Palazzo Colonna in Rome, the daughter of King Vittorio Emanuele I of Sardinia and his wife, Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este, daughter of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, governor of Milan and son of Empress Maria Theresa after whom she was named. Her mother was Maria Beatrice d’Este, Duchess of Massa and heir to the Duchy of Modena. Maria Beatrice d’Este, Duchess of Massa, was born in Modena, the eldest child of two monarchs, Ercole III d’Este, Duke of Modena and Maria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina, reigning duchess of Massa and princess of Carrara.\n\nMaria Anna of Savoy had a twin sister Maria Teresa, who became Duchess consort of Parma and Piacenza by marriage to Carlo II, Duke of Parma (Duke Charles I of Lucca).\n\nThe two princesses were baptised by Pope Pius VII. Their godparents were their maternal grandparents, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este and his wife Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d’Este. In the Museo di Roma can be seen a painting of the baptism.\n\nOn February 12, 1831 Maria Anna was married by procuration in Turin to Archduke Ferdinand of Austria (later Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria). On February 27, the couple were married in person in Vienna in the Hofburg chapel by the Cardinal Archbishop of Olmütz.\n\nFerdinand was the eldest son of Franz II-I, Holy Roman Emperor and Emperor of Austria and Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Possibly as a result of his parents’ genetic closeness (they were double first cousins), Ferdinand suffered from epilepsy, hydrocephalus, neurological problems, and a speech impediment. He was educated by Baron Josef Kalasanz von Erberg, and his wife Josephine, by birth a Countess von Attems.\n\nWhen Princess Maria Anna and Archduke Ferdinand married, the court physician considered it unlikely that he would be able to consummate the marriage. When he tried to consummate the marriage, he had five seizures.\n\nFerdinand succeeded on the death of his father Franz II-I on March 2, 1835. Fredinand also became King Ferdinand V of Hungary. Ferdinand was incapable of ruling his empire because of his mental deficiency, so his father, before he died, made a will which promulgated that Ferdinand should consult Archduke Ludwig on all aspects of internal policy and urged him to be influenced by Prince Metternich, Austria’s Foreign Minister.\n\nFollowing the Revolutions of 1848, Ferdinand abdicated on December 2, 1848. He was succeeded by his nephew, Franz Joseph. Following his abdication, he lived in Hradčany Palace, Prague, until his death in 1875.\n\nMaria Anna and Ferdinand had no children.\n\nWhen Ferdinand succeeded as Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary and Bohemia; Maria Anna became Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia. On September 12, 1836 she was crowned as Queen of Bohemia at Prague.\n\nAfter December 2, 1848 when Ferdinand abdicated as Emperor of Austria, but retaining his imperial rank; Maria Anna was henceforward titled Empress Maria Anna. They lived in retirement together, spending the winters at Prague Castle and the summers at Reichstadt (now Zákupy) or at Ploschkowitz (now Ploskovice).\n\nMaria Anna died in Prague, May 4, 1884 (aged 80). She is buried next to her husband in tomb number 63 in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.\n\nFerdinand I (April 19, 1793 – June 29, 1875) was the Emperor of Austria from 1835 until his abdication in 1848. As ruler of Austria, he was also President of the German Confederation, King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia (as Ferdinand V), King of Lombardy–Venetia and holder of many other lesser titles. Had the Holy Roman Empire not been abolished during the reign of his father, Ferdinand would have reigned as Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand IV.\n\nFerdinand was the eldest son of Franz II-I, Holy Roman Emperor and Emperor of Austria, and Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Ferdinand’s mother was the eldest of 18 children born to King Ferdinand IV-III of Naples and Sicily (later King Ferdinand I of the Two-Sicilies) and Maria Carolina of Austria, the thirteenth child of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor Franz I.\n\nPossibly as a result of his parents’ genetic closeness (they were double first cousins), Ferdinand suffered from epilepsy, hydrocephalus, neurological problems, and a speech impediment. He was educated by Baron Josef Kalasanz von Erberg, and his wife Josephine, by birth a Countess von Attems.\n\nFerdinand has been depicted as feeble-minded and incapable of ruling. Yet, although he had epilepsy, he kept a coherent and legible diary and has even been said to have had a sharp wit. However, suffering as many as twenty seizures per day severely restricted his ability to rule with any effectiveness. Though he was not declared incapacitated, a Regent’s Council (Archduke Ludwig of Austria-Tuscany, Count Kolowrat, and Prince Metternich) steered the government.\n\nArchduke Ludwig, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia and Prince of Tuscany (1784 – 1864), was the 14th child of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, King of Hungary and Bohemia, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain.\n\nWhen Ferdinand married Princess Maria Anna of Savoy, the court physician considered it unlikely that he would be able to consummate the marriage.\n\nPrincess Maria Anna of Savoy\n\nPrincess Maria Anna of Savoy was the daughter of King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia and of his wife, Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este, daughter of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, Maria Beatrice d’Este of Modena. Princess Maria Anna of Savoy had a twin sister Princess Maria Teresa. The two Princesses were baptized by Pope Pius VII. Princess Maria Teresa married Charles Louis, Prince of Lucca.\n\nWhen Ferdinand and Maria Anna tried to consummate the marriage, he had five seizures. Ferdinand is best remembered for his command to his cook: when told he could not have apricot dumplings (Marillenknödel) because apricots were out of season, he said “I am the Emperor, and I want dumplings!” (German: Ich bin der Kaiser und ich will Knödel!).\n\nIn 1848 revolutions swept across Europe. As the revolutionaries were marching on the palace, he is supposed to have asked Metternich for an explanation. When Metternich answered that they were making a revolution, Ferdinand is supposed to have said “But are they allowed to do that?” He was convinced by Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg to abdicate in favour of his nephew, Archduke Franz Joseph (the next in line was Ferdinand’s younger brother Archduke Franz Charles, but he was persuaded to waive his succession rights in favour of his son). The new Emperor, Franz Joseph, would occupy the Austrian throne for the next sixty-eight years.\n\nFerdinand was the last King of Bohemia to be crowned as such, as King Ferdinand V of Bohemia. Due to his sympathy with Bohemia (where he spent the rest of his life in Prague Castle) he was given the Czech nickname “Ferdinand the Good” In Austria, Ferdinand was similarly nicknamed Ferdinand the Benign.\n\nFerdinand died on June 29, 1875 and is interred in tomb number 62 in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna."
