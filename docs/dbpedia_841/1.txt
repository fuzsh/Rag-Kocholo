Mama Shelter Saray Casablanca will feature 92 rooms and 49 apartments designed in Mama Shelter’s signature style. Its additional amenities will consist of three swimming pools, a rooftop lounge, indoor and outdoor fitness equipment, a yoga area, a meeting room, events spaces, and events programming.

The property will be located in Morocco’s first mixed-use real estate project, Saray. Nestled in Les Princesses neighbourhood, the development will also include five-storey buildings with high-standing apartments, offices, shops, leisure areas, hanging gardens, and green spaces. With both a hotel and branded private residences, Mama Shelter will constitute an integral part of Saray.

We favour differentiating offers that bring novelty, freshness, and impact, Saray is the perfect illustration of this. It is a pioneering project that gives pride of place to functional and recreational diversity for a living environment neighbourhood centred on the human. Our partnership with Mama Shelter perpetuates this philosophy while rewriting the codes of luxury in the industry of lifestyle hospitality in Morocco. We are happy to be actors of this great adventure.

Khaled K Al-Mashaan, CEO of ALARGAN International

We are extremely excited about the first Mama Shelter in Morocco, and the first in Africa. We know our brand carries the fundamental values of Moroccan culture, such as the generosity that our guests find in our gastronomic approach, the joy of living and sharing with friends and family. We look forward to introducing this beautiful city to Mama Shelter, and everything she has to offer. We have the ambition to make the brand a vector of local hospitality as we did in London, Rome, Lisbon, Belgrade, and Los Angeles.
