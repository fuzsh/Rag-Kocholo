It will give these businesses easy access to our circuit, whether for testing or customer experiences.”\n\nRichard Birch, Dubai Autodrome General Manager, added: “We have been overwhelmed by interest in the new project and have even contemplated a phase two for 2018.\n\n“But first we want to concentrate on getting phase one built. We had to overcome some frustrating delays in the past eight months, but I’m very pleased to say we have finally broken ground on the project and moving forward quickly.”"
