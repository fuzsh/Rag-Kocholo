2023 closes with the consolidation of a 2 years project where Argan Albida'a Club affirmed its position in Kuwait Health and Fitness landscape. 2 years of consecutive double growth (plus) in all main KPI's and building positive #netprofit in less than 6 months. What a journey! Together with a fantastic and special group of people, we created a #holisticwellness exeperience focused on families and introduced an independent, stand-alone brand with a full scope of fitness facilities, kids club and outdoor activities. The picture below speaks perfectly to this 2 years endeavour and the accomplishments achieved by this remarkable #team and its footprint in Kuwait. I could not be more grateful for being part of this magnificent journey and to all the wonderful people that I had the privilege to serve with in the ALARGAN Group I say: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

One final look into a beautiful chapter of my career with the feeling of mission accomplished. Proud to be recognized as a hard-working, dedicated leader with high ethical standards My endless gratitude for the opportunity of serving the ALARGAN International Real Estate Company goes to Eng. Khaled Al-Mashaan whose mentorship has shapped my professional growth and my personal development. Extremely excited for the future ahead while carrying the lessons and values instilled during this chapter into the next adventure, celebrating growth and pursuing excellence. #leadership #missionaccomplished #nextchapter
