BYU coach Mark Pope added one more player to his roster for the upcoming season.

Paora Winitana, a 6-foot-6 combo guard-forward, committed to the Cougars and will join the team as a walk-on.

Winitana averaged 26 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists last season at American Heritage in Lehi. He plans to be at BYU next season before departing for a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Winitana is originally from New Zealand. He came to the United States before his junior year of high school.
