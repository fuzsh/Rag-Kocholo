        "text": "From 2009 to 2014 Foundation North, a philanthropic trust serving Auckland and Northland, funded a Māori and Pacific Education Initiative (MPEI) designed to facilitate Māori and Pacific students’ educational achievement. The longitudinal study, Ngā Tau Tuangahuru, described here was funded in late 2014 to explore what happened next for families and students who had been involved in MPEI initiatives, with a focus on family success and student educational success. The first data collection round of this study took place in 2017, and 69 families were interviewed. This article examines what the 35 Māori whānau (56 individuals) said about family success and about supporting the success of young people in their whānau. For many whānau, success embodied happiness, collective wellbeing, and good whānau relationships, alongside education and having a plan for the future. This success was most often hampered by financial restrictions. Whānau wanted young people to be achieving in education, w...\n\nMāori (Indigenous New Zealand) university graduates are role models for educational success and are critical for the social and economic wellbeing of Māori whānau (extended family) and communities. In this study, Māori graduates ( N = 626) from all eight New Zealand universities participated in the Graduate Longitudinal Study New Zealand between July and December 2011. They were asked to describe factors that they found helpful or challenging to the completion of their qualifications. Graduates described a range of external (e.g. family), institutional (e.g. academic support), and student or personal (e.g. persistence) factors. Describing the experiences of Māori graduates can provide a blueprint for future indigenous success by building an evidence base of the factors that may promote indigenous higher educational achievement in New Zealand and internationally.\n\nThe New Zealand education system produces high levels of academic performance (Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development OECD, in Timperley, Wilson, Barrar, & Fung, 2007). Contradictorily, New Zealand is also one of the few countries that produce a huge divide in performance levels between Maori and other minority culture groups on the one hand, and non-Maori and dominant culture groups on the other (ibid.). However, school policies on Maori student initiatives appear to generate minimal success for Maori students. Therefore, an urgent critique, and transformation of school policies are required to bring about better educational outcomes for Maori students. Hence, this qualitative study is underpinned in critical and socio-constructivist theories, and adopts a Kaupapa Maori orientation that is grounded in the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Obstacles to Maori student achievement were firstly identified to determine how partnership relationships among students, whan...\n\nSchool marae are increasingly common in mainstream state secondary schools in Aotearoa / New Zealand. But such marae have, so far, attracted very little research attention – either from the Ministry of Education or the academy. Given school marae offer a site for the development of the Ministry’s educational aim of ‘Māori succeeding as Māori’, this project contributes to both research on school marae, and on the ways that ‘success as Maori’ might be understood in this context. As a qualitative study, informed by kaupapa Māori research methodology, this work examines the experiences of a small group of eight Māori students and five whānau who participate at Tiriwa Marae – a school marae located in a large urban secondary school in West Auckland. How do Māori students and whānau at Tiriwa understand ‘success’? What does ‘being Māori’ mean to them and how does the marae inform their interpretation of the educational ideal - to ‘success as Māori’? The thesis outlines key themes raised by the participants as the educational, social and cultural benefits of their school marae experiences. In doing this, the project contributes to future debates about the educational significance of school marae. It also represents a lasting record of the views and experiences of the Tiriwa Marae whanau in 2011."
