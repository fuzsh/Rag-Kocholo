        "text": "In the spring of 2017, my research sabbatical at Waikato University in Aotearoa/New Zealand centered on the extreme over-representation of the indigenous Māori people in the prison system. Nonetheless, I was constantly pulled into the national obsession with rugby and its conspicuous connection to Māori culture. Although well aware that many Māori athletes are rugby players, I was surprised to see the members of Hamilton's local professional team perform a version of the traditional Māori haka before matches. The haka is a traditional Māori dance and song performed on the battleeeld, at welcoming ceremonies, and during peace negotiations. Representing cultural pride and unity, the contemporary haka is performed at cultural events and to signify the rights of Māori other indigenous peoples. The All Blacks rugby team performs haka before match. davidwebb22/ Flickr (CC BY 2.0)\n\nThis dissertation seeks to define the relevance of an Indigenous ontological perspective within a contemporary Māori arts practice. It does so in order to ascertain whether this type of approach can be a valid tool for empowering oppressed indigenous identity within a globalised context. By investigating the practices of a range of indigenous artists form various parts of the world, this dissertation affirms the potential of transcultural processes, inherent within a globalised ideology. It seeks to clarify the ways in which a mediated perspective that resides between indigenous expression and globalised expression is able to successfully reinterpret the myths implicit within colonised accounts of history. Through a detailed analysis of a contemporary Māori arts practice, this dissertation explores the ways in which a combination of performance art and performance artefact can be employed as self portraiture. In doing so, this dissertation explains how an Indigenous based arts practice is able to positively interrupt the pervasive discourses that are inherent components of globalised ideologies."
