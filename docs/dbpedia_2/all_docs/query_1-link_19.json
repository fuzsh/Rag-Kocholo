        "text": "New Zealand softball pitching legend Chubb Tangaroa struck the Ngati Kahungunu Maori Sportsperson of the Year award for the second time last night.\n\nTangaroa, the pitching coach for the world champion Black Sox, who completed a history-making triple victory earlier this year, received the award at the annual Sport Hawke's Bay-organised function attended by 250 people at Taradale's Pettigrew-Green Arena. Havelock North's Tangaroa last won the award four years ago when the Black Sox won their previous World Series title.\n\nHis other achievements this year included coaching Havelock North High School to the national secondary schoolgirls' title, receiving a Queen's Birthday Order of Merit award for his services to the code and being inducted into Softball New Zealand's Hall of Fame.\n\nBefore receiving the premier award last night Tangaroa won the coach award. Other finalists for the award were one of last year's joint winners, cue sports whiz Ramona Belmont, who won the Junior Sportswoman award for the third consecutive year, Tall Black basketballer Paora Winitana, who won the Senior Sportsman award for the third consecutive year, kickboxer Leighann Banham, who won the Senior Sportswoman award and taekwondo exponent Tamihana Wairama, who won the Junior Sportsman award. Tangaroa's manager of the Havelock North High School softball side, Carlien Paul, took home the administrator award for the second consecutive year.\n\nWinitana provided an emotional touch to the evening when he decided to share his award with Paralympic gold medallist Sholto Taylor.\n\nWinitana and Taylor were the guest speakers.\n\nLabour Hawaikirangi and Tinahaere Walker were joint winners of the inaugural Active Kaumatua award.\n\nWinitanta spoke about his experiences at the 2004 Athens Olympics and his time with the 2003 New Zealand Breakers. Taylor, a long-serving Wheel Black, spoke about the glory associated with winning a gold medal at the Athens-hosted Paralympics."
