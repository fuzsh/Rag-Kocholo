        "text": "Essential Freshwater Policy Programme Update\n\nNgā tūtohutanga\n\nRecommendations\n\nThat the Rangitāiki River Forum:\n\n1 Receives the report, Essential Freshwater Policy Programme Update.\n\n1. He Whakamārama\n\nBackground\n\nThe Essential Freshwater Policy Programme (EFPP) is Toi Moana Bay of Plenty Regional Council’s (Toi Moana) work programme to implement the requirements of the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management 2020 (NPSFM) and also review the Regional Natural Resources Plan (RNRP). Overall, the EFPP continues to be implemented according to Toi Moana’s agreed programme plan, although there are some parts which are behind schedule.\n\nTight timeframes are necessary to achieve notification of changes to the RPS & RNRP by 2024 as required by the legislation. This year, the focus is primarily on developing draft policy options, and continuing to involve tangata whenua. An extensive public engagement period will occur in 2023.\n\n2. Essential Freshwater Policy Programme update\n\n2.1 Draft policy options\n\nToi Moana staff are now progressing tangata whenua and some targeted stakeholder engagement on working draft policy options for region-wide freshwater related chapters of the RPS and RNRP that have been reviewed. These include:\n\n· RPS Water Quality and Land Use, and Water Quantity chapters.\n\n· RNRP Integrated Management, Beds of Water Bodies, Wetlands, Discharges to Water and Land, and Land Management chapters.\n\nThe RNRP Kaitiakitanga chapter review is progressing and will be made available for tangata whenua engagement in September 2022. The RNRP Kaitiakitanga chapter review is currently under internal review and has been provided to Ngā Kaitohutohu (kaupapa Māori advisory group) on 2 August for comment (a follow up workshop is pending). It has also been provided to two external resource management consultants with comprehensive iwi and Māori resource management experience.\n\nWork is also underway on other policy review and development topics including:\n\n· Early draft long-term vision and outcomes for Freshwater Management Units (FMU), there will be an opportunity to discuss these at the meeting.\n\n· Water quality targets, limits and options to achieve them in FMUs, including for the Rangitāiki; the aim is to have some draft science summaries by early September. Tangata whenua involvement in the preparation of attributes/indicators for mahinga kai will be a critical part of this work.\n\n· Groundwater and surface water quantity limits and management options.\n\nThe aim is to have draft policy options ready for public engagement in 2023. There are likely to be some gaps. For clarity, no decisions on policy options will be sought from Toi Moana Councillors until late next year.\n\nThis is the last RRF meeting for the year (due to local body elections in October 2022). Letters inviting consideration of further draft policy review and development topics will be sent out to tangata whenua, including RRF iwi organisation members as they come to hand. An EFPP briefing can be provided for any new RRF members either ahead of or at the first RRF hui in 2023.\n\n2.2 Tangata whenua engagement\n\nFreshwater is a taonga and integral to the whakapapa of tangata whenua. The NPSFM clearly sets out increased expectation of active involvement of tāngata whenua in freshwater management, including incorporating mātauranga Māori, cultural values, and identifying attributes or indicators relating to cultural values such as mahinga kai. Toi Moana staff continue to invite and support iwi and hapū involvement via the Māori engagement process under Te Hononga to the extent they want to or have the capacity to be involved. Several iwi are now participating in the freshwater policy mahi whether that be through providing input into the draft long-term vision (a brief summary of key points from the combined iwi meetings was included in the paper for the June meeting), considering draft policy options or via other projects and engagements.\n\n2.2.1 Involvement in early working draft policy reports\n\nAs outlined under the draft policy options section above, tangata whenua, via iwi organisations and co-governance groups have been invited to consider draft region wide policy options, to hold workshops with Toi Moana on these, and to provide feedback. The letter received by RRF has been forwarded to members and can be discussed at the hui.\n\nRRF may consider requesting a combined hui for tangata whenua with associations to the Rangitāiki river and its tributaries similar to the Rangitāiki vision hui or may wish to wait until more Rangitāiki and/or tangata whenua specific draft policy material is available.\n\n2.3 Community engagement\n\nThroughout the remainder of this year, Toi Moana staff will provide information for the public, and opportunities for involvement via online engagement and aim to develop community interest and readiness to engage on policy options relevant to them in 2023.\n\nOnline engagement on long-term visions for freshwater and environmental outcomes for freshwater values closed on 1 August. Two contributions were provided online for the Rangitāiki FMU which covered values such as recreation, natural character, mahinga kai, irrigation, cultivation and food production, commercial and industrial use, animal drinking water, traditional resources and taonga species. Where these values were present, the contributors sought improvements to the current state. Both entries acknowledged the importance of being able to swim safely, concerns were raised about water availability and storage, erosion control and acknowledgement of the work landowners had undertaken already. They sought protection of Whirinaki Forest for its natural character and the community working together to keep our awa clean and available to all people.\n\nAs outlined above draft issue and option topics as well as the draft communication and engagement plan can be shared with iwi (and RRF members prior to the election) for consideration. Initial consideration may include whether or how to be involved in communication and engagement next year.\n\n3. Ngā Whakaarohanga\n\nConsiderations\n\n3.1 Ngā Mōrea me Ngā Whakangāwaritanga\n\nRisks and Mitigations\n\nThere are no significant risks associated with this matter/subject/project/initiative.\n\n3.2 Huringa Āhuarangi\n\nClimate Change\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are of a procedural nature and there is no need to consider climate change impacts. Climate change impacts will be considered as part of implementing the NPSFM and reviewing the RNRP.\n\n3.3 Ngā Pānga ki te Māori\n\nImplications for Māori\n\nThe NPSFM sets out requirements to involve tāngata whenua in the management of freshwater and Council is progressing this in accordance with Te Hononga, Toi Moana’s Māori engagement approach for implementing the NPSFM and review of the regional plan.\n\nTe Mana o Te Wai in the NPSFM 2020 represents a significant shift by central government to recognise the importance of tangata whenua involvement in the management of freshwater. Importantly, it signals inclusion of mātauranga Māori in shaping up the policies to be included in the notified plan change. In particular, the NPSFM makes mahinga kai a compulsory value in Te Anga Whāinga ā-Motu (National Objective Framework, NOF) that needs to be provided for in the setting of objectives, water quality and quantity targets and limits on resource use for freshwater bodies. Toi Moana staff acknowledge iwi and hapū organisations have a heavy workload crossing a wide range of matters, as well as freshwater, and yet still we seek to support and encourage tangata whenua to express their mahinga kai values and the tohu that indicate this value is provided for in freshwater bodies.\n\n3.4 Whakawhitiwhiti ā-Hapori\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nCommunity engagement on freshwater visions, values and outcomes has been online via Participate BOP over the last year. See the section on community engagement within the report. In 2023, Toi Moana will engage across the region on policy options and implications.\n\n3.5 Te Hāngai ki te Pou Tarāwaho Rautaki\n\nAlignment with Strategic Framework\n\nPlease consider the committee’s relevant strategic framework and how this report aligns to its purpose and what it is seeking to achieve.\n\nNPSFM implementation and supporting RRF are both core Toi Moana functions. They are both supported by the strategic framework and align with aspirations in Te Ara Whānui o Rangitāiki = Pathways of the Rangitāiki – river document.\n\n3.6 Ngā Pānga ā-Pūtea\n\nFinancial Implications\n\nIf the recommendation is adopted by Council, will it result in:\n\n- Unbudgeted work during the current financial year?\n\n- Unbudgeted work for any of the years remaining in the current Long Term Plan?\n\nIf the answer is ‘no’ to both questions please select the dropdown option 1 and complete appropriately.\n\nIf the answer is ‘yes’ to either question please select “Budget Implications” in the building block below and liaise with your Management Accountant in order to complete the Financial Impact table.\n\nThere are no financial implications for RRF associated with this report.\n\n4. Ngā Mahi Whai Ake\n\nNext Steps\n\nNext Steps: What next? What resources are needed? Further analysis? Timeframes ahead. Any consultation planned. Remind Council of the process ahead. Next update to Council?\n\nConclusion: Short concluding remarks. Referring back to recommendations. No new content.\n\nToi Moana staff will:\n\n1. Continue to invite and support involvement of tangata whenua in draft policy options for region-wide chapters, and in the preparation of draft long-term vision for freshwater and environmental outcomes.\n\n2. Continue to support various iwi led projects to advance their input and advice into this work programme.\n\n3. Continue to progress key policy workstreams at pace, including surface water quantity, groundwater quantity, water quality and ecosystem health in Freshwater Management Units.\n\n4. Share summary information and draft policy option material relevant to the Rangitāiki with RRF and iwi and hapū organisations. Invite tangata whenua to provide feedback prior to public engagement in 2023.\n\n5. Continue to develop the Communications and Engagement Plan for 2023.\n\n2022 Local Government Elections Update\n\nNgā tūtohutanga\n\nRecommendations\n\nThat the Rangitāiki River Forum:\n\n1 Receives the report, 2022 Local Government Elections Update.\n\n1. He Whakamārama\n\nBackground\n\nElections of members to all local government councils are held once every three years with the close of polling day for the 2022-2025 triennium being Saturday 8 October 2022. Elections for local government are conducted by way of postal voting.\n\n2. Establishing a new council\n\nFollowing the elections, the 2019-2022 Council triennium will end and all the Councils’ committees established under the Local Government Act are disestablished. This does not affect any co-governance forums which are established under separate legislation. However, the term for the Councils’ elected representatives on Rangitāiki River Forum will end.\n\nAfter the official election results have been declared sometime between 13-19 October, the new Council will be established over the October – December period. This involves swearing the Councillors into office, electing the Regional Council’s Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson, undertaking the Councillors’ induction programme, adopting a new governance committee structure and associated appointments of committee chairpersons and deputies, membership appointments to the various committees and co-governance forums, and establishing the 2023 Council and committee meeting schedule. Due to the amount of procedural requirements it is anticipated that Council’s representative appointments won’t be in place until late November therefore is anticipated that the next meeting of the Rangitāiki River Forum will be held in early 2023.\n\nIn developing the 2023 Meeting Schedule, staff anticipate keeping Rangitāiki River Forum meetings to the current quarterly meeting cycle and day of the week unless otherwise advised by the Rangitāiki River Forum Chair.\n\n3. Ngā Whakaarohanga\n\nConsiderations\n\n3.1 Huringa Āhuarangi\n\nClimate Change\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are of a procedural nature only.\n\nNgā Pānga ki te Māori\n\nImplications for Māori\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are of a procedural nature only.\n\n3.2 Ngā Pānga ā-Pūtea\n\nFinancial Implications\n\nThere are no material unbudgeted financial implications.\n\n4. Ngā Mahi Whai Ake\n\nNext Steps\n\nInformal notice will be provided of the new Councils’ membership appointments and 2023 meeting dates once they have been confirmed as well as being reported to the next meeting of the Rangitāiki River Forum for confirmation.\n\nThe 2023 meeting cycle will be modelled on the 2022 meeting cycle. Members will receive notice of the 2023 meeting calendar and meeting invites once the meeting schedule has been confirmed."
