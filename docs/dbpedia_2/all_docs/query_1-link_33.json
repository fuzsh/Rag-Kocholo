        "text": "The annual Basketball New Zealand Awards, held at the Pipitea Marae and Function Centre in Wellington on Saturday night, saw awards handed out to 24 worthy recipients – in recognition of their excellence and achievement in basketball for the 2022 calendar year.\n\nHighlights from the Awards night included Charlisse Leger-Walker being named both MVP for the year as well as Female Player of the Year, after a stellar year both in the NCAA College basketball and with the Tall Ferns. Meanwhile Isaac Fotu was named Male Player of the Year, following his performances both in the top tier of the Japan League and with the Tall Blacks as they qualified for the 2023 FIBA World Cup.\n\nMaia Jones and Dontae Russo-Nance took out the awards for Female and Male Junior Player of the Year respectively – Dontae for the second straight year – while Bronwen Davidson claimed the Female Coach of the Year award and Greg Brockbank won Male Coach of the Year. The Zena Gay Award, who recognises a notable contribution to women’s basketball in New Zealand was awarded to Glenda Taylor while Iain Potter was a deserved recipient of the Sir Lance Cross Award.\n\nBasketball New Zealand also inducted five new members into its prestigious Hall of Fame: Leigh Houston, Kenny McFadden, Tab Baldwin, Tania Tupu and the 2002 Tall Blacks squad that finished fourth at the FIBA World Champs.\n\nThe night culminated with BBNZ bestowing its highest honour – the Basketball New Zealand Legend – to the 1958 Women’s New Zealand National Team, as the only New Zealand national team to have beaten Australia 3-0 in a series.\n\nHALL OF FAME INDUCTEES\n\nLeigh Houston (player) – Leigh is one of the preeminent players of her time, playing for the Women’s National team from 1971-1977. She also captained the 1969 U18 team that attended the Australian State Champs for the first time. At 5’10”, she was a taller member of the New Zealand team but considerably smaller than a number of the Australian forwards.\n\nDomestically, Leigh won a national title with Nelson in 1973, repeating the feat the following year but this time in Otago colours. Leigh earned South Island representation on two occasions and after moving to Wellington, North Island representation five times. After retiring from playing, she continued in the game as a coach for over ten years.\n\nKenny McFadden (player, coach and contributor) – Michigan native Kenny McFadden came to New Zealand in 1982 after playing at Washington State University. In his first year he guided the Saints to the Second Division title before carrying the club to six straight NBL finals finishing as champions on four occasions. He played 252 NBL games in his career, exceeding 5000 career points at over 20 points per game – his #5 jersey retired in his honour.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 1996 Kenny became heavily involved in junior player development setting up his own Hoops Academy in the capital. He coached the Junior Tall Blacks at the 2009 FIBA U19 World Cup, and also had stints as assistant coach of his beloved Saints. Kenny also took 14-year-old Steven Adams under his wing and guided the Kiwis rise to the NBA.\n\nTab Baldwin (Coach) – Tab arrived in New Zealand in 1988, having coached in the States for five years. He enjoyed immediate success, taking Otago from the second division to the NBL, then moved north to Auckland where he guided the Auckland Stars to five titles in eight years – with Tab named NBL Coach of the Year on four occasions. He took the reins of the national team in 2001 and had immediate success with the team beating Australia 2-1 to win the 2001 FIBA Oceania Championship, the victory propelling the Tall Blacks to the 2002 World Cup. The Tall Blacks enjoyed a stunning run at that World Cup to finish fourth – the highest placed finish by an Oceania team at a FIBA event.\n\nIn 2004 he coached the Tall Blacks to a tenth-place finish at the 2004 Athens Olympics, then took the team to silver medal success at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, victories against Australia in 2004 and 2006 and then coached the team to the quarter-finals at the 2006 FIBA World Championships.\n\n2002 Men’s New Zealand National Team – this squad enjoyed an incredible campaign at the 2002 World Cup, eventually finishing fourth, and in so doing captured the imagination of the New Zealand sporting public. The team reads like a “Who’s Who” of the Tall Blacks – only 11 players have played 100 tests for New Zealand and six of them were at those World Champs in Indianapolis and the 12 players totalled 1,173 international appearances between them.\n\nPero Cameron, a future FIBA Hall of Famer and BBNZ Legend, was named to the All-star team at the champs after averaging 14.7 points and 5 rebounds per game. Phill Jones led New Zealand in scoring averaging 18.2 ppg while Kirk Penney tallied 16.9 per contest; Mark “Sparky” Dickel second in assists with 4.6 per game. The other team members of the star studded 12 were Paul Henare, Dillon Boucher, Judd Flavell, Paora Winitana, Damon Rampton, Ed Book, Robert Hickey and Sean Marks. Head Coach was Tab Baldwin and Assistant Coach Nenad Vucinic.\n\nTania Tupu (player) – Tania played 93 games for the Tall Ferns – ninth all-time on the Tall Ferns list – representing New Zealand at the 1994 FIBA World Championships and both the 2000 and 2004 Olympics. Tania was second highest scorer for New Zealand at the World Champs and also second at the Sydney Games. She made her international debut at the William Jones Cup in Taiwan in 1992 before signing off her illustrious career at the Athens Olympics in 1994.\n\nShe played NCAA Division I basketball at the University of Hawaii and averaged 19.6 points per game in her senior year – the fifth highest single season scoring average in the programme’s history. Tania earned a trial with WNBA team Houston Comets before going on to play in the Australian WNBL for the Perth Lynx. Tania then returned to New Zealand and won a National title with the Waikato Lady Titans in 2002. In recent years she has given back to the game as a coach. In 2022, as head coach of the Tokomanawa Queens, Tania guided the team to the inaugural Tauihi Aotearoa Championship.\n\nBASKETBALL NEW ZEALAND LEGEND\n\n1958 Women’s New Zealand National Team – this was the only New Zealand national team, men’s or women’s, to have beaten Australia 3-0 in a series. The uniqueness of the this team’s participation in international basketball – the first women’s series to be played under FIBA international rules – saw the 10-woman squad playing a demanding 6 games in 6 days at the Australian State Championships and 14 games total played in 3 weeks. The team played well to win 5 out of 6 games at the State Championships as a lead into the international series.\n\nThe 1958 team comprised of captain Irone Brough, Alma Coulson, Anita Hannen, Noeline Marsh, Beverley Green, Val Rogers, the Otago trio of Lois Muir, Frances Pedofsky and Diane Enright plus the youngest member of the team 20-year-old Maureen McDermott.

In August Dontae was selected to attend the Basketball Without Borders Asia NBA camp in Canberra, his second trip to Canberra that year after being invited to train at the NBA Global Academy in March.\n\nMALE PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nIsaac Fotu – Isaac Fotu won this award following both his capturing of the Japan League championship in 2022 and his participation at the FIBA World Cup Qualifying games where he helped New Zealand secure a berth at the 2023 FIBA World Cup.\n\nIsaac played World Cup qualifiers against Saudi Arabia and Jordan as well as a warm-up game against Japan, and currently plays for Brex Utsunomiya that play in the Japan-B1, the top league in the country.

She led the Cougars in scoring with 483 points – the second highest points aggregate in the Pac-12 Conference – and was second in rebounds, assists and steals. She was Named to the All-Pac 12 First team for her efforts.\n\nCharlisse moved into elite company as she became the 16th Kiwi to score 1,000 points in Women’s NCAA Division I college hoops, since taking her tally on to 1,465 career points. Despite her heavy collegiate schedule, Charlisse played all four games for New Zealand on the tour of Australia last October – scoring in double figures in each game while averaging 17 points per game.\n\nCAROLYN GREY FEMALE COACH OF THE YEAR AWARD\n\nBronwen Davidson – In 2022 Bronwen’s Westlake Girls High School team produced a historic 30 wins and zero losses season.

During his tenure he helped turn around an organisation in financial trouble, into one that is healthy and high-performing; helping basketball to become the sport of choice for many New Zealand youth.\n\nIain has been a huge supporter of equity for the women’s side of basketball, which has resulted in equity in funding and player payments. He oversaw the introduction of the new FIBA qualifying structure for the men’s game, resulting in more frequent home games for the Tall Blacks and Tall Ferns. Under Iain’s stewardship BBNZ was an early-adopter of the 3×3 game, resulting in 2 early World Titles for our U18 Men’s teams and numerous medals for our men’s and women’s teams participating at other FIBA international events.\n\nIain was also honoured on the night as the recipient of FIBA’s prestigious Patricia Ramsay Award.\n\nTHE ZENA GAY MEMORIAL AWARD\n\nGlenda Taylor – this award recognises a notable contribution to women’s basketball in New Zealand, with Glenda known as a tough competitor and an intelligent player.
