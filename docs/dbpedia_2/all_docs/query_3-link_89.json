        "text": "The Geography wing of the Social Sciences Department has had another busy year. While Covid again proved to add disruptions into the programme we still managed to get out and about and expand on the learning that took place in the classroom.\n\nThe Geography courses offered at HBHS include the NCEA Level 1 -3 classes and also the IGCSE (Cambridge) course that is offered in Year 11. Students taking the subject learn about the key issues facing society at a local, regional and global scale. It is important to gain an understanding of these issues, as they affect all of us in our daily lives. Knowledge is power and students who understand the key issues we face can become part of the solution. Students who have this awareness are well sought after by employers in most industries. This is what Geography is all about at Hastings Boys’ High School.\n\nPart of our student learning is to conduct field trips to various locations to help students gain a wider understanding of what they are learning in class. The most notable group field trip the department went on this year was to the South Island in Term 3. Joel Van den Hout, a Year 13 geographer was on the trip and his report follows:\n\nOn the 28th of September, a group of students from Years 11, 12 and 13 Geography went on a 7-night trip down to the South Island to look at possible careers available in Geography. The flight at 6.25 am meant an early start for the boys, and after a smooth flight, we arrived at Christchurch Airport.\n\nThe first two days of the trip were spent in Christchurch, where we spent time looking around the city and learning about how engineering had advanced following the devastation of the 2011 earthquake to make buildings safer. Our guide, Brandy from the University of Canterbury, also took us to the red zone of Christchurch, which was interesting to learn about as what was once a whole suburb now looked like a big open field. We also visited the Antarctic Centre and took a quick tour around the University of Canterbury campus, led by last year's Head Boy, Sam Connor. The food in Christchurch was a highlight for the boys, especially the Riverside Market and the Little High Eatery.\n\nOn the third day, we began our journey southwards, setting up camp in the stunning Lake Tekapo. During our time here, we visited the Church of the Good Shepherd and also walked the Hooker Valley Track, which had amazing views of a glacier lake and Mt Cook. But the best scenery came from Reuben when he blessed our eyes with his budgie smugglers at the hot springs in Tekapo and Twizel Lakes. The night sky in this area is phenomenal, and Mr Barclay took us outside at night and taught us about some constellations.\n\nDay 5 began with a helicopter flight up to the mountains. The views from the mountaintops were breathtaking, especially when we landed on a glacier above the cloud. We then made our way southwards to Queenstown, our final destination. We stopped at Arrowtown to attempt gold panning.\n\nDuring our time in Queenstown, we met up with an Old Boy from the school, Luke Place, who talked to us about his job as an Urban Planner for Queenstown Lakes District Council and the challenges they are facing in the next 30 years. We also experienced some of the tourism in the area, doing the luge and zipline, which was one of the trip's highlights. This was partly due to Briarne’s enthusiasm (or over-enthusiasm, some would say). The final day for me was the best day of the trip. We spent a whole day skiing at Cardrona Ski Field, and upon figuring out how to stop and turn without falling over, the boys had a blast. The views from the top of the ski field were simply out of this world. The trip back to the Bay wasn’t relatively as smooth as the way there. A polar vortex hit and cancelled our flight out of Queenstown, meaning a slightly stressful 7-hour drive back to Christchurch to catch a 6 pm flight. In a way, it was a fitting way to end such an epic trip. The views of the snow-covered Ida Valley and surrounding mountains on our way back to Christchurch were amazing.\n\nA big thank you must go to Mr Barclay and Mr Crawford for the massive effort in the trip preparation and for transporting us around the South Island. The boys performed a haka for Mr Barclay and Mr Crawford at Hawkes Bay Airport to show our appreciation for this, and they were presented with taonga. It was such an awesome opportunity to see our backyard in New Zealand, with the anxiety around Covid-19 finally gone with the total relaxation of the rules.\n\nFor me, and I’m sure for many others, this trip was the year's highlight.\n\nJoel\n\nMr Barclay and Osiris experienced a trip of a lifetime in September when he was given the opportunity to travel to The Northwest Territories of Canada for 22 days to take part in a cultural exchange programme with the First Nation Dënesųłıné indigeonous people from Thaidene Nëné (The Land of our Ancestors). Mr Barclay was invited on the trip and given the opportunity to ask a Geography student to come with him.\n\nThe goal of the cultural exchange was to understand how Indigenous people around the globe are using their knowledge to make decisions about their tribal territories, plants and animals that they consider taonga. A significant part of this cultural exchange program was to experience how the Dënesųłıné indigeonous people are supporting and developing the capacity, wellness, confidence, and resilience of their youth to confront the challenges of the future.\n\nThis trip was in the making for five years and was put together by landcare researchers at Manaaki Whenua, Phil Lyver and Puke Timoti. There are absolutely no words to describe how thankful, privileged and thrilled I was to travel to a country I have only dreamt going to! I would like to give a big Ngā Mihi to them for giving me this opportunity. I enjoyed meeting new people, participating in activities, creating fond memories and listening to stories the Dënesųłıné had to tell. A highlight I recall is the absolute beauty of the pristine nature, with little to no human interaction! Canada has a varied landscape, with majestic mountains, rolling plains, forested valleys, immense barrenlands and beautiful blue rivers and lakes. There was never a dull moment. I’ve made a lot of friends and I wish to go back in 3 years.\n\nThe trip involved travelling to Yellowknife in Northwest Territories, and then on to Łutsël K’é - a settlement only accessible by boat, plane or snowmobile in winter. From there we flew by float plane further north to our campsite for the next 2 weeks at Artillery Lake, or Ɂedacho Tué as it is called in the Chipewyan language.\n\nWhat a fantastic opportunity given to one of our Boys - we are so happy for you. Thank you for the great article and photos Osiris. Photo to the right: Myself and Chase - A Dënesųłıné Legend"
