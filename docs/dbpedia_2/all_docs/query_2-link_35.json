        "text": "The New Zealand Men's National Team is set to compete at the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, qualifying with a third-place finish at the 2022 FIBA Asia Cup in Indonesia.\n\nOne year after qualifying, New Zealand's Tall Blacks are in the Philippines, where they will take part in a group featuring Greece, Jordan and the United States. And while each matchup provides a unique challenge, New Zealand's final step of preparation before each game will be the same.\n\nAs part of a pregame tradition, the Tall Blacks perform a traditional haka just moments before the game tips off. The haka features all 12 members of the team performing in synchrony, with actions including stomping and rhythmic body slapping accompanying a loud chant.\n\nThe tradition, which is interwoven with the nation's rich culture, has often resulted in memorable reactions from New Zealand's opponents, most notably James Harden and Team USA in 2014.\n\nMORE: New Zealand official FIBA Basketball World Cup roster\n\nThe haka meaning, explained\n\nThe haka is a pivotal element of Māori culture. Māori are the indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand. Here is a detailed explanation of the Tall Blacks' haka, Tū Kaha, from the official website of New Zealand basketball:\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Tall Blacks haka is not a war dance. Former Tall Black, Paora Winitana, says there are many reasons why New Zealanders haka – to celebrate, to acknowledge, to give thanks, at tangi (funerals)...\n\nThe objective of the Tall Blacks' haka Tū Kaha is purely to help us all stand strong, not only as Tall Blacks or as basketball players, but as a people, as New Zealanders. One of the lines is 'Tuturu whakamaua kia tina,' which means 'we honour the past, the present, the future.' This is us acknowledging everybody who has gone before us, those who will surely follow after and the acceptance of the responsibility we have now to prepare the way forward. We are not standing strong because it's the 12 guys you see standing against you, we are standing strong because it's you against every Tall Black and all New Zealanders.\n\nIn each game, the Tall Blacks are unified in the same Māori chant, which holds deep meaning and connects the 12 players suiting up to their entire nation.\n\nNew Zealand basketball team haka\n\nAs explained by on the official website of New Zealand, \"haka are also used to challenge opponents on the sports field.\"\n\nIt is important to note that there are different haka, with the New Zealand Tall Blacks having their own haka, which differentiates from other national teams, including New Zealand's men's and women's rugby teams, each of whom uses a different haka.\n\nMeaning of New Zealand basketball team chant\n\nHere is the meaning of the chant said as part of the Tall Blacks' haka:\n\nTūturu whakamaua kia tina! Tina\n\nHonor the past, the present, the future.\n\nHaumi e hui e... tāiki e!\n\nTo all who can hear my voice, listen... We are ready!\n\nTorona kei waho!\n\nWe accept your challenge, accept ours.\n\nHurunuku, Hururangi te hau o Tāwhirmātea, e kaka nei!\n\nThe two strongest winds of Tawhiri, Hurunuku and Hururangi are here.\n\nTŪ KAHA O PANGO TE KAKHIKATEA A Hī!\n\nThe black singlet stands strong, firm, immovable.\n\nWhakarongo ki ngā pere o te ā-whiowhio\n\nListen to the fierceness of this great storm.\n\nHaere mai haere mai te hau kaha auē te wehi e!\n\nTo the strongest winds we reply, \"Bring your best! We will never give in, we have no fear!\"\n\nHe aha tātau tū tonu ai?\n\nIn the midst of this great storm, how are we still standing?\n\nHe pakiaka, toi Ariki, toi Uru tapu\n\nOur strength is in our roots, our history, our legacy. This is the vine that connects us with a sacred strength from above.\n\nTŪ KAHA O PANTO TE KAHIKATEA HĪ!\n\nThe black singlet stands strong, firm, immovable!\n\nNew Zealand basketball team haka video\n\nHere is a look back at New Zealand's basketball team performing the haka prior to a meeting with Team USA in 2014:\n\nWhy is New Zealand's basketball team called the Tall Blacks?\n\nThe nickname is derived from the nickname for New Zealand's rugby team, which is called the All Blacks.\n\nThe rugby team's nickname was inspired by its uniforms, which are all black. The basketball team's nickname is a play on that, leaning on the fact that, in addition to wearing black, most members of the team are exceptionally tall."
