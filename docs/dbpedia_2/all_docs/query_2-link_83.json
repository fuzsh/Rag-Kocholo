        "text": "re: Maher out six weeks (#156447 | Grrr!)\n\nDench needs to go\n\nChappell needs to go\n\nDodman to get any minutes that were reserved for dench. As it would be nice to think that phil might start to try and develop him for future years.\n\nOption for Chappell\n\nFull Name:\n\nJoshua Pace\n\nNickname:\n\nJP\n\nBorn:\n\n23/05/83\n\nBirthplace:\n\nGriffin, GA\n\nEthnicity:\n\nAmerican\n\nSchool:\n\nSyracuse\n\nHeight:\n\n1.97\n\nWeight:\n\n89\n\nPosition:\n\nGd/Small Forward\n\nIt IS Josh Pace....Knew about it today but couldn't say (Sorry guys). Check out his NZBL Stats for more up to date info.\n\nWas People's Choice MVP and a member of the league all star 5.\n\nLooks OK.....but it's hard to judge with the NZBL.\n\nNote that Phil STILL didn't look too far :-)\n\nyay sounds like a great signing, if hes as good as Crowe or better from the Gold Coast he will be a greta pick up, and hopefully if he turns out well we can hang on to him as he isnt that old either, and a fresh face is always exciting!\n\ni wouldnt worry about Phil not looking far away, i remember people sugesting him on this forum and no one seemed to think of him as a bad idea and most liked the idea, plus he is a safer bet the fact he has beaten guys like Crowe before, and Crowe has gone on to be a good import, means that he is fairly certain to be a decent import and prob wont be heaps expensive either!!\n\nExciting times ahead hears hoping he fits in well and does well!\n\nIts difficult to tell how he will perform in NBL. If you look at players like Crowe, Horvath and Hendrix, their NZNBL stats pretty much reflect their NBL stats but then you have players like Lindsay Tait and Paora Winitana who are amongst the top scorers in NZNBL but no where near reflect their stats in NBL, particularly Winitana. If he can consistently bring 22.4 points and 8.7 rebounds, then he will fill a hole in the 36ers roster.\n\nFrom what I've read, I'd expect a bit of an undersized SG/SF who doesn't have range but goes 110%. His FT numbers weren't great in the past, but it seems that he's improved a bit in that category.\n\nHe'd be coming from the East Kentucky Miners in the CBA (where he just had two straight triple-doubles):\n\nPace led East Kentucky in scoring, rebounding and assists. The Miners' leading scorer for the season finished with 28 points, 14 rebounds and 13 assists.\n\nIn Monday's 117-114 win over Atlanta, Pace had 26 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists. He led all players in rebounds and assists.\n\nHis stats in the CBA\n\n24.0 PPG (53% FG, 72% FT, 3/6 3P), 8.0 RPG, 4.8 APG, 2.3 SPG.\n\nIf he can put in a good effort, having that alongside Davidson and Ballinger, plus Maher, won't be too bad.\n\nI really like the look of him. Looks like he's not a great a shooter but doesn't try to be, limits his shots to within 10 feet most of the time which will be a nice alternative to our existing reliance on the three ball. He's also young which suggests he'll be at his athletic peak, and with his first crack in the NBL I expect he'll have a point to prove and play with an intensity we've been lacking thus far. Seems to be a bit of a hard ball get type player, should fit well alongside Davidson in that regard.\n\nReally hope this goes through and I look forward to seeing him when I'm back in Adelaide in a few weeks.\n\nAgree Billo, I think he'll help us defensively especially. Looks to be a solid rebounder as well. I just wish this deal was done a long time ago.\n\nHopefully catch up with you when you're back in Adelaide although I'm skipping the country soon for a little while.\n\nLike this part of his scouting report at http://www.orangehoops.org/JPace.htm :\n\n\"Pace had a very limited shooting range (10 feet and in), and played well within his means, rarely taking a long shot. He had the dubious distinction of being one of the worst free throw shooters in Orangeman history, with a shot that was flat out ugly.\"\n\nLike the fact he is cominf off 2 straight triple doubles, and not coming off the plane with back problems.... KNOCK ON WOOD ;)\n\nAs long as he gives even 10% more than Chappell, 36ers will be fine to make the playoffs this season, and perhaps even cause some damage....but Smyth is gone at seasons end, no smiley face can depict exactly how relieved that makes me as a fan that wants to see a bright future at the Dome!\n\nYeah, eventually emailed them about Pace a couple of weeks ago suggesting they look into him, figuring a bit of affordable hustle could suit the situation. Some NZ fans who'd seen him thought he could do OK and Oscar said a couple of the Nelson guys thought he could handle it at NBL level. As others have said around the place, Crowe and Hendrix are two NZ NBL imports who've shown they can at least contribute over here.\n\n(That's not to say that they weren't already aware of him though.)\n\nLet's just hope that he signs and does well because I don't know that they'd make another change if things didn't go to plan.\n\nJust playing Devil's advocate here, but wasn't David Cooper the reigning NZNBL MVP when we signed him?\n\nAlso, if Pace is so good, how come NZ, who have signed two new imports in recent weeks, didn't sign him then, when he has been right under their nose during the past season?\n\nWho Me? - Cooper had an MVP season over there, yes, and it's often cited as an example of the inferiority of their league. Going against that, Crowe has been decent for the Blaze, and was beaten to the award by Pace. Pace had 37 points against Crowe in one of the finals.\n\nNZ needed a point guard (Greene) and a big man (Alston). Pace was neither (an off-guard/SF) though I swear I read that they considered him anyway?\n\n\"It IS Josh Pace....Knew about it today but couldn't say (Sorry guys). Check out his NZBL Stats for more up to date info.\"\n\nDICKO??...totally unaceptable, if you are going to be my go to man for this sort of info...it is not on, to not tell me...\n\nhmm reviewing whether you should be cut :)\n\nLook up \"Josh Pace\" with inverted commas on Google Video and there are is a game with him playing in the NZBL - not sure which team or number he is to be honest, but a small amount of research and you'll work it out.\n\nEC, don't see why. I've never seen him play, just sounded like he could suit their needs and budget and put forward the name. They would've looked into it further. Of course, if it's him they sign, I certainly hope he plays well.\n\nShame that whoever it is only gets five or so games in front of their home crowd unless Adelaide make the post-season.\n\nDICKO: \"It IS Josh Pace....Knew about it today but couldn't say (Sorry guys).\"\n\nLove you DICKO, thanks for that, you're a legend.\n\nDICKO: \"Check out his NZBL Stats for more up to date info.\n\nWas People's Choice MVP and a member of the league all star 5.\n\nLooks OK.....but it's hard to judge with the NZBL.\"\n\nThe Kiwis know their shit, & I respect that. Top scoop DICKO.\n\nDICKO: \"Note that Phil STILL didn't look too far :-)\"\n\nYou're absolutely right DICKO, Phil pounced on him, much to management's disgust. Keep it com'n DICKO, you're a ledge.\n\n*** time passes ***\n\nDICKO: \"Quick back peddle.\n\nThe 6ers have OFFERED Pace a contract. He is yet to agree to terms.\n\nThey're sweating by all accounts as they don't have any money to offer more.\n\nStill pretty LIKELY to be Pace.\"\n\nI'll go along with your (valid) point that we don't have any money, but he's likely to sign? 8 ) ????\n\nWhat if he doesn't?\n\nWhat if another team snatches him?\n\n*** pre-empts come-back ***\n\nIt's Phil's fault? ; )\n\nPosted by EC yesterday: \"Isaac, if indeed it is Pace that is recruited, will his performance put any pressure on you?\"\n\nPosted by Isaac yesterday \"EC, don't see why.\"\n\n*** break in thread to itemise, for simplicity ***\n\nPosted by Isaac yesterday: \"I've never seen him play,\"\n\n*** break in thread to itemise, for simplicity ***\n\nPosted by Isaac yesterday: \"just sounded like he could suit their needs and budget and put forward the name.\"\n\n*** break in thread to itemise, for simplicity ***\n\nPosted by Isaac yesterday: \"They would've looked into it further.\"\n\n*** break in thread to itemise, for simplicity ***\n\nPosted by Isaac yesterday: \"Of course, if it's him they sign, I certainly hope he plays well.\"\n\nIsaac = Phil??????\n\nNah.\n\nSweat it out brother. : )"
