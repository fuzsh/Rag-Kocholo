        "text": "Mihimihi Moe araara! Moe araara, Kohe rii, Kohe raa Katahi ano i oti ai ahau i te kura reo o te Taurawhiri ki Waimarama. Ko tahi wiki te roa. Ka rawe rawa atu te mahi o te tangata i mui mai ana ki te korero i te reo rangatira mai te ao ki te po mai te po ki te ao. Miharo atu te hunga rangatahi o <strong>Kahungunu</strong> i wanangatia ai. Tino matatau ratou ki te korero me te aroa me te tuhituhi i te reo. Ka tau ke! Having just completed a week long total immersion reo wananga held at Waimarama and been totally drenched in te reo from dawn to dusk, I can only but wonder about the immense pride in using te reo in all places and at all times to all people. This is our 25 year moemoea for all of <strong>Kahungunu</strong> to have te reo as a first language. Na te uaua tamariki o te Whatuiapiti, o <strong>Kahungunu</strong> whanui hei tutuki pai te kaupapa. Hei manawa piharau - We will be relentless in the pursuit of our goals. Ngahiwi Tomoana (Chairman) Waitangi Day Celebrations <strong>Kahungunu</strong>'s Waitangi Day celebrations will be held at Farndon Park Domain in Clive. The park is situated only 500 meters from where Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong> signed the Treaty of Waitangi in June 1840. A boat pageant featuring descendants of Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong> signees and early British settlers on waka and rowboats will start the day. Three waka ama with 30 youth paddlers on board from <strong>Kahungunu</strong> and Ngai Tahu will also join the event as the climax to a three day sea journey from Mahia. This will be followed by the signing of a 'treaty of the spirit' a tradition started in 2000 at Clive. The words in both Maori and English, read, \"I am here, you are here, one country, one heart, two cultures, unity through diversity\". Everyone is invited to sign the arts installation. This free family day includes an annual hikoi from Waipatu Marae, morning and afternoon concerts featuring Maori, Pacific Island and Asian performers,waka rides, a sports tournament, karaoke entertainment, art and craft fair, and plenty of kids activities. The headline act for the day is the Vaimutu All Stars Band featuring Brother Love. This group is a polynesian up tempo show. The music is uplifting and funky with a pop beat and a groovy ukelele rhythm. Last year more than 10,000 people took part in the annual event. This year the organisers (The Maori Millenium Committee) expect similar numbers. The event is sponsored by Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong> <strong>Iwi</strong> with funding support from the Ministry of Arts and Culture and Creative Communities. For more information about this event contact: Te Rangi Huata Ph: 06 8763128 National School of Ancient Maori Weaponry In September 2002 Te Whare Tu Taua O Aotearoa started training at the Tuhonohono Whare at Nga Punawai Aroha Addiction Services. The syllabus that they followed was that same one which was started in Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong> by Dr Pita Sharples in 1983. This has now spread nation wide and is well recognised all over Aotearoa with a following of over 5000 Tauira who have attended various grades. Since the roopu in Heretaunga was formed, an excess of 50 Tauira registered with 21 successful gradings in the last year. Grading was held at Rakautatahi Marae Takapau, under the watchful eyes of Paora Sharples and Matua JB Smith, who both hold the highest turanga in the kura of Pouwaru. In November, Paora and JB also had the honour of being put through their paces by their Tumu Whakarae, Pita Sharples. All Pia (students) were successful in passing. One Pourua grading was the longest ever recorded at seven hours. The following are the Tauira who attained a grade in 2002. Tyla Te Whaiti – Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong> (Poutahi) Iatimo Tipasa – Ngāti Hine/Nga Puhi (Putahi/Pourua) Malcom Puhia – Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong>/Ngāti Pahauwera (Poutahi) Te Kaireka Puhia – Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong>/Ngāti Pahauwera (Poutahi) Charles Ruwhiu – Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong>/Nga Puhi/Ngāti Porou (Putahi) John Tangaere – Ngāti Pourou/Ngāti Horowai (Putahi/Pourua) Tom Haapu – Ngāti Pourou/Ngati Konohi (Putahi/Pourua) Manila Haapu – Ngāti Tuwharetoa/Waikato/Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong> (Poutahi) Rewi Haapu – Ngāti Pourou/Ngāti Tuwharetoa (Poutahi/Pourua) Jacob Arthur – Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong> (Poutahi) Greg Waiwiri – Waikato/Taranaki (Poutahi) Cecily Heperi – Waikato/Ngāti Tipa (Poutahi) Nikita Miller – Waikato/Ngāti Tipa (Poutahi) Kingston Miller – Waikato/Ngāti Tipa (Poutahi/Pourua) Taongamapuna Ngawhika-Tepu – Waikato/Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong>/Te Arawa (Poutahi/Pourua)\n\nSport Art Gifted Sands Annual Art Exhibition In November 2002 <strong>Kahungunu</strong> hit the fields with all they had competing against two other iwi - Te Arawa and Tainui. All of our <strong>Kahungunu</strong> players looked smart and played to the best of their ability and although we didn’t come back with trophies and first prizes, it was believed that our <strong>Kahungunu</strong> team spirit was awesome. Overall <strong>Kahungunu</strong> came second. Comments were made that watching the Men’s Basketball final, Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong> versus Tainui, was like watching an NBA game on television and the opponents were given a game to remember. Most of the team players on both sides were first division players and Paul Winitana (New Zealand-Tall Blacks) gave us all a great show. This Inter <strong>Iwi</strong> Sports Event was the first of a tri-annual event. The next Inter <strong>Iwi</strong> Sports Event will take place in 2005 and will be hosted by Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong> <strong>Iwi</strong>. Already plans are being made to make this event a great success. Gifted Sands is the title of the annual exhibition of beautiful art created by talented and inspired artists throughout <strong>Kahungunu</strong>. This annual event which recently took place at Ruawharo Marae in Mahia earlier in January promoted 49 artists and their unique work to the population that crowded Mahia during these Summer months. Over one hundred pieces of art were on display including paintings, sculpture of wood, stone and metal, Jewellery made from bone, stone, shell and fibre, clay figurines and photography. People gathered from all around for this creative experience not only to witness the talent but to participate in workshops and develop an inspired creative talent of their very own. The exhibition curator is Ngaromoana Raureti. She is also a well known creative painter. One of Ngaromoana’s paintings is displayed in our Ngāti <strong>Kahungunu</strong> <strong>Iwi</strong> office foyer.
