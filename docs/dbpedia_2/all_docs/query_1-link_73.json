        "text": "BENITA CAIRNS\n\nBenita has dedicated her life to being a champion for Wairoa. Benita cares deeply for the people of Wairoa and is someone who can represent the interests of others from all walks of life.\n\nHer previous nine years’ experience as a Councillor and her passion for the place and the people holds her in good stead to be the Mayor that Wairoa deserves and expects. The people of Wairoa need to have confidence in their Council and that can only be achieved by being open and transparent about all its dealings. The Council continues to incur unnecessary cost burdens on the ratepayers through ongoing rates increases and frivolous spending on projects that have no benefits back to the community.\n\nBenita has gained the necessary skills and acquired the knowledge to know what it takes to lead an efficient and effective Council in a critical role as Mayor of Wairoa.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area. I am also standing for Māori Ward Councillor.\n\nCRAIG LITTLE\n\nI have had the honour of being Wairoa’s Mayor for the past nine years.\n\nI am re-standing because of the critical unprecedented challenges we face, and the many approaches I have had from people asking me to continue as Mayor.\n\nWe are confronting significant, proposed Government reforms that could strip local government of its core wellbeings, infrastructure and decision-making and place control with an unelected, unaccountable, centralised group.\n\nWairoa needs proven, experienced leadership. I will continue to advocate for our district with a strong voice and transparency.\n\nI will continue our strong partnership with Tangata Whenua/Iwi to build our community and future.\n\nI will continue to grow our population to ensure our district is a sustainable home for young and old to live, work and play.\n\nI am Wairoa born and bred and want our district to be the best it can be. I won’t make promises I can’t keep.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area.\n\nSIMON MUTONHORI\n\nI am a career public servant with 30 years experience serving local government, twenty of those in New Zealand. I derive satisfaction in contributing to society by just doing my job. I believe in equal opportunities, fairness and I believe each member of our community has something to contribute and what they need is an opportunity to be engaged and be heard to unleash their potential.\n\nMy values are inclusiveness, transparency, integrity, accountability, manaaki and utmost respect for all members of our community regardless of their race, culture, lifestyle, beliefs, gender, occupation or their socio-economic situation.\n\nNot only do I believe in New Zealand biculturalism, I am also bilingual and I live and practice these values in my everyday life. To honour the past, we must prepare for the future. Your vote may as well be the x-factor needed to change for good. He wero tenei kia koutou aku rangatira.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area.\n\nMURRAY OLSEN\n\nKo tapatahi toku maunga, Ko mahi pono toku awa, Ko tangata tiriti toku iwi, Ko Olsen toku whanau, Ko Ken toku papa, Ko Shirley toku mama, Ko Murray toku ingoa, Ko toa papapaatuhi o Wairoa ahau.\n\nTena koutou katoa\n\nI’ve been living in Wairoa for five years, after a 20 year physics career, mainly overseas. A physicist identifies problems and finds solutions.\n\nI have come to know many great people in Wairoa and I am committed to the town, the district, and Wairoa Hopupu Honengenenge Matangirau, our main river. I have been lucky to participate in mahi preserving the health of the river, including the expensive wastewater consent hearings. I was also given the chance to help solve problems at the Citizen’s Advice Bureau.\n\nI strongly believe we are all part of the same community, and I want to help strengthen that community as Mayor of Wairoa.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area. I am also standing for General Ward Councillor.\n\nJENNIFER TAKUTA-MOSES\n\nKo Panekire te Maunga, Ko Waikare te moana, Ko Haumapuhia te Tipua huri kohatu ki tua. Tenei te tuhono Tatau-Pounamu Kia Koutou nga uri whakaheke o Ngati Kahungunu.\n\nKo te Wairoa ko koe, ko koe ko te Wairoa. The long river is you, you are the long river.\n\nI am delighted to be contesting the position for Wairoa.\n\nWith your votes my passion and promise to be a community minded leader embraces transparency, trust, social responsibility and a solid attitude to drive local and regional economic progress.\n\nVote to improve health to well-being. Vote for good housing and good education. Vote for a dual heritage to thrive in Wairoa.\n\nKo te Wairoa ko au, ko au ko te Wairoa. The long river is me, I am the long river. Vote me for Mayor, Vote for Te Wairoa.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area. I am also standing for Māori Ward Councillor.\n\nNGAIRE CULSHAW\n\nNga mihi. Married with 6 children, 20 grandchildren. My husband owns a shearing business and employees up to 30 people during peak season. Have an online health and wellbeing business. I run healing retreats e.g. massaging, te rongoā, right across the board. Am actively involved in Marae, passionate about environmental issues, rangatahi and charitable endeavours and elderly pursuits. Empowering small businesses. Farming and the wellbeing of farmers within our rohe is important as I believe they have a huge impact within our infrastructure. Forestry is a No for me because of the damage to the environment (roading) and eco-system. Our over the top rates need to be addressed in earnest. The 3 Waters is also a No for me. Honest and transparency is a must. I am outspoken when expressing my views not afraid to stand alone. A good leader creates leaders.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area.\n\nDENISE EAGLESOME-KAREKARE\n\nKia ora, my name is Denise Eaglesome-Karekare. I am Wairoa born and bred, and I have a deeply vested interest in our community and its future. I strongly believe in putting people first and this underpins how I operate. I hold a number of governance and community roles which provide relevant experience for a position on the Council. I am currently the CEO of Wairoa Young Achievers Trust and manage multiple projects that improve the lives of our people. This role keeps me grounded and connected to our community. I believe we have the answers to many of the tough issues we face in our district and these are from a grassroots space. My record speaks for itself and I will continue to bring a wealth of passion, dedication and experience to the Council table to make the best decisions we can for our proud community and people.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area.\n\nHINE FLOOD\n\nThere is no doubt we are at a time of unprecedented challenges and complexity in local government. The rapid pace of change is challenging and will require your vote to elect a Council who will best serve the Wairoa district over the next three years. In my time as Councillor, I can say categorically this upcoming term as being the most crucial requiring influence. Wairoa will need a Council with exceptional governance experience, courageous smarts, and steady hand to lead the inevitable government reforms, taking extreme care to uphold affordability and drive sustainability.\n\nI am enthusiastic and cautious about our future and have the skills, experience, and stamina to hold our table to account ensuring Wairoa interests are exceptionally well represented with financial diligence at the core of decision making, being frugal when needed without compromise but ambitious where wellbeing and innovation is paramount.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area.\n\nJEREMY HARKER\n\nI have extensive experience in leadership, management, and governance gained from 28 years in the NZ Army, as a previous Director on the Health Hawke’s Bay Board, and as a Wairoa District Councillor.\n\nI am actively involved in the Wairoa community through the Wairoa RSA and CACTUS.\n\nMy vision for Wairoa is that it is a well-connected, positive, forward-thinking community that fulfils the potential that this district has by engaging with the community, businesses, other local authorities, and central government to boost economic resilience. This requires key decision makers to listen to the community and work hard, ensuring that they are fully informed when making decisions.\n\nI am passionate about Wairoa’s future and will ensure good decisions are made that will benefit all of Wairoa in the long term.\n\nI am married to Paula Couper, we have three sons and we are grateful for the remarkable lifestyle Wairoa offers us.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area.\n\nMURRAY OLSEN\n\nKo tapatahi toku maunga, Ko mahi pono toku awa, Ko tangata tiriti toku iwi, Ko Olsen toku whanau, Ko Ken toku papa, Ko Shirley toku mama, Ko Murray toku ingoa, Ko toa papapaatuhi o Wairoa ahau.\n\nTena koutou katoa\n\nI’ve been living in Wairoa for five years and have always taken an interest in council and community affairs. I am committed to the town, the district, and Wairoa Hopupu Honengenenge Matangirau, our main river, as well as all our other rivers.\n\nI worked as a physicist before I retired. I was an Equity and Harassment Officer at the University of Queensland. Now I garden, fish, and ride my bikes, as well as participating in Facebook discussions in our town. I love finding solutions to problems as part of a good team.\n\nI can do a lot to help develop Wairoa for all its people as a councillor. I want the chance.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area. I am also standing for Mayor.\n\n022 566 8548\n\nROZ THOMAS\n\nWithout a local voice there is no local action.\n\nThe importance of local government is significant, now more than ever.\n\nWairoa is facing major issues including Three Waters, Blanket Forestry, overreaching policies in agriculture, horticulture and environmental challenges eroding our community and local economy.\n\nCritical thinking and diverse community representation is required to develop grass roots solutions best fit for Wairoa, ensuring a strong prosperous district, now and for future generations.\n\nMy experience comes from a lifetime of volunteering and working in horticulture, farming, community development and governance including local and central government.\n\nI have been involved in these sectors in Wairoa for the past 26 years focusing on project management and professional fundraising, including Wairoa’s Destination playground right through to multi-million-dollar Provincial Growth Fund initiatives.\n\nWith this broad skillset I can help tackle these complex challenges facing our district while building on the positive initiative’s already in place.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area.\n\nWAIPATU WINITANA\n\nKia ora,\n\nMy wife Desiree and I, with our 8 children, have made Wairoa our home relocating from Waikaremoana 12 years ago, this decision was made based on our desire to invest into people. During this time, we managed and now own On Sight Security which has helped us to help others. My desire to continue to serve our community has brought us to this place of standing for Council.\n\nI identify with both European and Māori heritage which enables me to recognize the importance of accepting people from all walks of life and different backgrounds. I want to honor the many people who supported us on this journey and have encouraged us to step into this important role of leadership.\n\nWe have endured wars, environmental changes and even pandemics, I am proud of the spirit of our people to not only survive but thrive.\n\nVote Waipatu Winitana for Wairoa.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa District area.\n\nBENITA CAIRNS\n\nTena tatou\n\nKo Benita Cairns, no uri o Mahia mai tawhiti, Na Nuhaka, Whakaki nui a rua o wai u me te Waikaukau.\n\nBenita has dedicated her life to being a champion for Wairoa. Benita cares deeply for the people of Wairoa and is someone who can represent the interests of others from all walks of life.\n\nBenita has worked in community services, business management and ran a successful shearing business with her partner of 33 years, Taylor Munro. It provided much needed employment for many people of Wairoa.\n\nBenita also volunteers her time including as Chairman of Te Kuha Tarewa Marae. This commitment to give back stems from her upbringing when she would go collecting for Red Cross with her nan Lovey Hook. Her previous nine years as a Councillor and her passion for the place and the people holds her in good stead to represent Wairoa on Council.\n\nMy principal place of residence is in the Wairoa district area.
