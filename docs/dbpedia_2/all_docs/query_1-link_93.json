BALLIF HP HERE is a significance of new- ■* ness about each January 1st, not new in the sense of the newness of birth, because we have lived and ex- perienced much. But there is a feeling of starting again. It is something like standing on top of a mountain at the beginning of a ski run where the snow is unbroken and you are ready to make the trail. To the experienced skier the run will be exciting and beckoning ; to the careless skier, danger lurks at every turn ; to the new, inexperienced skier there is the fear of the new, the caution and the errors of the beginner. To all of you who have filled this past year full of distance run, who do feel the joy of accomplishment that arises from the thrill of obstacles over- come, congratulations ! You are better prepared to run the course of a New Year. Life to you is like climbing the slopes of a mountain, the view is more beautiful and more breathtaking as you reach new heights. By using and de- veloping the gifts God has given to you, you can arrive at new places, feel new powers, and place yourself in a positon to do more good. The challenge of the New Year is not only to the successful, but to all men, women, and children. It is a starting point often cluttered up with wordy resolutions. However, it is a real starting place and for people with courage, determination, and a worth- while goal in view, the summit can be reached. In this New Year of 1958 we have new stimulation toward the better way of life as we turn our thoughts and efforts to participation in the temple ordinances. This calls for the best in us as set forth in the pattern provided by the Saviour of Mankind. To most of the Church membership this experi- ence in the temple will be new. It will be thrilling to all who enter because of the confidence gained in living the basic principles of the Gospel. The blessings promised are available to every member of the Church. The re-directing of our lives by true re- pentance places us in line for these privileges. We read in Matt. 20:1-16 the par- able of the labourers : \"For the king- dom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.\" Later in the day he found other men idle and set them to work and again he found other idlers even later in the day and set them to work. He even put some to work at the eleventh hour. The important part of this parable is that we are brought face to face with the great fact that the acceptance of the idler or wayward of the right direction will open the possibilities of the kingdom of our Father to him. Hearing the Master's voice, accept- ing of His terms, and working with diligence will bring the blessing of God to everyone. May this New Year bring you the fullness of our Father's blessings. TE KARERE <r*Qz*<Fa*Q2*c(rs<Q=*<i(7=a<Q^ 'S By SISTER ARTA BALLIF HAPPY NEW YEAR! AND MAY YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO LIVE IT! THE beginning of the year is not only the best time to take inven- tory of abilities, accomplishments and weaknesses, but it is the best time also to stock up on courage. It takes some courage to greet each morning with a smile, but it takes a great deal of courage to say, \"I was wrong.\" If 1958 requires of you the courage to admit error will you have enough to do it? Admitting a mistake is a starting point for humility, for progress, and is part of repentance. \"Don't be afraid to say, 'I was wrong,' \" advised Ed- ward Anthony and explained that in every phase of life one is apt to err. A misdeed may not be a grave one but defending it may lead to great difficulty. Fear deters advancement at any time but fear to acknowledge wrong doing is cowardly at the very moment when one wishes to appear strong. A man who had been married fift) years and whose friends regarded him as a happy man, was asked to give his recipe for a successful marriage. Said he, \"Be quick to admit error. We all make mistakes. [t*S how We behave afterwards that counts. It took me years to learn that it always makes matters worse t<> defend an obvious blunder.\" When there is quarrelling between husband and wife, between children and parents, all cannot be right, but because of stubbornness, ego, or pride, few will say they are wrong and the quarrelling becomes bitter. L n- happiness is the result. All people want recognition ; they desire to be well-thought of by others ; they fear being wrong, and often main- tain their point of view in order to retain status. \"It's a fact,\" said one girl. \"You mean you think it is,\" re- plied the other. \"No, I mean that it is a fact,\" retorted the first and the con- tention grew big from there. Continual declaration of an error does not make it right. The mayor of America's biggesl metropolis, Mayor LaGuardia. once said. \"When I make a mistake, it's a beaut I\" Then he laughed and ad- mitted it to his opponents and thej could not be angry with him. Although he was a small man in physical stature he was big in character. Richard Maney wrote recently. \"Even the elite are guilty of fantastic errors in judg- ment.\" h takes courage to admit a blunder even t<> one's self, but doing 10 makes one great in bis own and other's views It \\ ou are still thinking and pr inK you cannot always be right So don't be afraid t0 Saj . \"I was \\\\ rOIUJ and he was right.\" If such an OH comes to you in 1958 \\\\ iH you hi i out age to admit i mistal January, 1958 EDITORIAL . . . REMEMBER the old saying, \"Time waits for no man?\" What is this time that passes and never returns — that we think of especially at the beginning of each New Year. Longfellow says : W hat is time? — the shadow on the dial — the striking of the clock — the running of the sand — the day and night — summer and winter — months, years, centuresf These are but arbitrary and out- zvard signs — the measure of time, not time itself. \"Time is the life of the Soul.\" The life of the Soul ! As Latter-day Saints we know that our souls are eternal ; therefore time, the life of our soul, is equally eternal. It never waits, repeats itself or rests, but continues on its eternal march, catch- ing all who will into its steady progress. Alma, in the Book of Mormon, says, \"Behold, if we do not improve our Time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.\" Our time which has been allotted to us as mortals is NOW, passing each moment. It is to be used to prepare to meet Our Heavenly Father — to become per- fect even as He is perfect. Let us — \"Improve the shining moments; don't let them pass you by. Work while the sun is radiant; work, for the night draws nigh. Time flies on wings of lightning. We cannot call it back. It comes, then passes forward along its onward track.\" Time is marching on. We must live in accordance with the principles of the Gospel each moment. Then when we look back at the time past, we will be happy that we have used this part of eternity as Our Father in Heaven would have us do. \"For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.\" TE KARERE COLLEGE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT: ANOTHER year has passed and with 1958 comes a new era of progress in the lives of the New Zea- land Saints.

Mendenhall and Di PacifV Board oi Education Di < (\"out murd M I'^RC 10> January, 1958 Missionary Activities The year 1957 has seen many missionaries arrive and depart from the beautiful Aotearoa. Some have passed tracts and preached sermons in door-to-door contact and others with their families Riven assistance to the great construction programme being carried out. Each has voiced his or her testimony and felt the solemn obligation to proclaim the Resoration of the Gospel whereby man may attain his salvation. What was then Next Year, is now This Year. \"Procrastination\" cap- tured our \"intended\" labours and service. Following is an article by ELDER RICHARD ANDERSON of the Auckland District on pre- paring for THIS NEW YEAR. Resolution : AT the commencement of this New Year most of us sat back and took inventory of ourselves. We re- solved to overcome our faults and become better during the year. Then by the time a few days had past, many of us have forgotten that we ever made those resolutions. My suggestion and plea is that at the beginning of each neiv day, not year, we all take stock of ourselves. We should resolve to correct our shortcomings and ask God's forgive- ness for them, and then earnestly en- deavour to carry out the resolution. We need to try constantly to become more Christ-like in our action and thought. We must make this religion of Christ our everyday life. It can- not be, as you find in many churches today, just a passive routine habit of being in the assigned pew at the proper time. Man is put here upon this earth for a purpose. He is put here \"That he might have joy.\" The only way we can experience that joy is by living as the Saviour taught us. The time to begin improving our- selves is now, today. \"For behold, this is the time for men to prepare to meet their God — . Ye cannot say when ye are brought to that awful crisis that I will repent, that I will return to my God.\" Then it will be too late. Are you procrastinating the day of your repentance ? Are you saying, \"One day I'll live the Gospel to the fullest?\" TODAY is the day to prepare to meet our God. He zvas going to be all that a mortal should be — tomorrow. No one should be kinder nor braver than he — tomorrow. A friend who ivas troubled and weary he knew Who'd be glad, of a lift and he needed it too. On him would he call and see what he could do — tomorrow. The greatest of zvorkers this man would have been — tomorrow. The world would have seen him had he ever seen — tomorrow. But the fact is he died and he faded from view, And all that he left here when living ivas through, Was a mountain of things he intended to do — tomorrow. — Edgar A. Guest. If your worship and embracing of the Gospel of Jesus does not bring satisfaction and does not bring vibra- tions of delight from the depths of your soul, then it is time to take in- ventory of yourself. It is time to get in tune with the Spirit of God. We as Latter-day Saints are blessed above all people. Let us make use of that God-given right we have to joy and happiness. Take stock of yourself today, then again tomorrow, and each day become more like Him. 8 TE KARERE DEPARTURES: Two Zion Elders left for home on the \"Waitemata\" in mid-December. ELDER ROY B. THOMSON ar- rived in the New Zealand Mission August 19, 1955, and had previously served two years in the U.S. Army. He also attended school studying farm management and animal husbandry and hopes to continue his studies upon his return home. Elder Thomson laboured in Hauraki 9 months ; Auckland, 9 months ; Bay of Islands, 7 months ; and Whangarei, 4 months ; the last two as Supervising Elder of the Whangarei District. labouring in this land. Their message and counsel is the same as is given by Our Saviour : \"Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these tl;iugs shall be added unto you.\" Elder Edwards LOCAL SISTERS RELEASED: SISTER JENET WATENE was called on a mission at Hui Tau of 1956. Prior to her call, she was a dental nurse and received her training in Auckland. Her home is in Kiri Kiri. Elder Thomson ELDER GEORGE NORMAN EDWARDS arrived in New Zealand August, 1955. He laboured one month in Inglewood, California, and his first assignment in New Zealand was in the Auckland District for 9 months. He also laboured as a District Elder in YVaikato where he helped to organize Sunday Schools at Morrinsville. and Port YVaikato, and spent tin- last 1_' months as Supervising Elder in Baj of Islands District. Elder Edwards worked for tin- Columbia Steel Mill iii California prior to his mission, and would like to return to school.

She migrated from Tonga five years ago and was living in Wellington previous to her call. She has proselyted in the Auckland District for a year, spending a short time working in the Mission Re- corder's Office. All who have associated with these two Sisters have appreciated their strong testimonies of the Gospel and will miss them and the strength they gave to the missionary work in this land. We wish you success in your future plans. FROM THE COLLEGE (Continued from Page 7) left November 9th for Hawaii where he was to spend a few more days at the Church College of Hawaii before returning home to resume his regular duties as Assistant Superintendent of the Mt. Diablo High School District. President Mendenhall, in addition to meeting with the Pacific Board and Advisory Board at the College, spent about a week in Australia and feels sure there will be a group of students from Australia that will come to at- tend the Church College of New Zea- land in the future. Help and counsel from these brethren has been much appreciated in setting up the aims and objectives of the school and assisting with details of supply, equipment and teaching staff.

When it was found that the efforts of a group of different personalities, could be organ- ized and co-ordinated to function as one, that day, civilization began. UNITY: Certainly, throughout all of human history this quality of \"unity of pur- pose,\" this \"consolidated action,\" has proved to be one of the most im- portant elements of accomplishment. When men are not able to unite and work together, then those going in one direction tend to neutralize the efforts of those going in the opposite direction, and the result is confusion and failure. It doesn't matter very much whether the desired accomplishment lies in building a business, doing effective Church work, or running an empire — the ability to make united effort is usually the final test of superiority. In our day, the Lord Himself has it up an organization to bring about the salvation of His children. Each of us has been placed in some position of responsibility in the Church to help work out our own exaltation. Jesus prayed for His disciples that the) might be one, as lie and llis Father arc one. That is the greatesl possible objective. Bill sometimes we never learn to work together, no matter how im- portant the undertaking may be. Some- times we resemble a team of horses without a driver, or a team that is balky, or one that is trying to go in opposite directions. This confusion may not be because the workers are not capable, or because they do not believe in the doctrines of the Church. It may be that we have just never trained ourselves to co-ordinate our efforts and work as a unit. OBEDIENCE: The Lord has said that \"as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways.\" (Isa. 55:9.) It naturally follows that when He tells us to do something we may not always understand why it is necessary, or why it should be done wow, or why it must be done as He has said. And as a consequence, a lot of us get out of step with Cod and the programme <.<i the Church. Xaaman was told to bathe himself in the River Jordan to be cleansed of his leprosy. But Xaaman said. \"Arc not the rivers of my own country better than the water- of Israel\"\" (See II Kings 5:12.) Sometimes, like Xaaman. we figure out reasons to be out of step; for example, the Lord has t<«ld us to be baptised by immer- sion for the remission of sins. Then Somebody immediately argues that sprinkling will do just as well. Or why should one be baptized at alii But tin- Lord has said. \"He that be lieveth and is baptized -ball be saved; but he that beheveth not shall be damned.\" I Mark 16:16 I Vnd we bad better let it go at that. January, 1958 11 What a wonderful thing it would be if we accepted the word of the Lord at face value and then did what He said, when it should be done. Recently an article was published by one of the popular ministers of the world, apologizing for a book he had written a number of years ago in which he opposed one of the principles of the Gospel. Greater experience and more mature thought had caused him to change his mind. But for all the intervening years, his philosophy and his books have been leading people astray, bringing confusion and dis- obedience into their lives. Now he finds that he was wrong, but the dam- age has been done and the problem has not been corrected, for as long as he puts his trust in his own opinions instead of the word of the Lord, he will probably continue to go off on other tangents in the future. How much better it would be to trust in God and march in step with Him and His programme. Sometimes the Lord must get pretty weary of the discord and confusion when so many of His children trust in their own whims and prejudices. \"... to obey is [still] better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\" (I Sam. 15:22.) ATHLETIC TEAM: We pay money to see a great ath- letic team, when the players have learned to synchronize their efforts and play for the team. Then each player submerges individual wishes in seeking the welfare of his group. Each takes the attitude that \"the team\" and \"the cause\" are bigger and more im- portant than individual wishes. We do not like to see each player trying to show how capable he is individually; the thing that we want to see is a team performance that is effective, and that is what the Lord wants to see. No football team would ever accomplish much if every member carried his own book of rules and called his own signals, each having his own objectives in mind and his own independent pro- cedures for accomplishment. Someone said that the greatest con- tribution ever made to progress came from football when someone invented \"the huddle.\" That is when the players get their heads together to co-ordinate their efforts so that they can play as one. They are as \"men in step.\" This is a great invention, and we should use it more. RESPONSIBILITY: In the Church, as in the army or in football, it is necessary for every man to know his responsibility and to carry out his part of the assignment. The Commander-in-Chief may not be able to take the time personally to persuade everyone that the course outlined is the proper one. But if the army could not move until every private had given his approval on every detail of pro- cedure, the army would never get very far, as there are usually about as many opinions as individuals in- volved. The men in an effective army must learn confidence and obedience, not only to march in step with their feet, but with their hearts, their wills, their purposes, their minds, and their ability. In the work of salvation, God is calling the signals and our exaltation is at stake. How much better it would be if we always placed our trust in God and did what we should, when we should, and how we should. We may not always understand the whys and wherefores ; it may appear to some that civil marriage is about as good as temple marriage. Or we may think that Sacrament meeting attend- ance or the observance of the Sabbath Day is not very important, or that a little irresponsibility won't make much difference. Then when we find out our mistake, the wrong has already been done. It has been said that \"Hell is truth seen too late.\" But in addition, we have contributed to the discord and confusion of other people. For it is far 12 TE KARERE more difficult for others to march in step when we are in confusion. PRIESTHOOD REACTIVATION: Jesus initiated a programme of in- dividual work, illustrated by the para- ble of the lost sheep, and in conformity therewith the General Authorities of the Church initiated a programme for 1956 requesting that this plan of per- sonal visitation be the united action of the Priesthood in order to bring back into activity those whose spiritual welfare was being jeopardized. Some responded wonderfully; others made only a feeble effort; and some did almost nothing at all. All usually have many reasons as to why the work was not done. Some have more urgent things to do. Some say, \"I go,\" but go not ; others don't want to be bothered. Some didn't understand the programme. Some didn't remember ; some didn't care. Some insisted on playing according to their own rules, with their own signals, and at their own pleasure. Consequently, accomplishment in this programme in some groups remains very near to zero. Jesus must have had this in mind when He said, \"... if ye are not one ye are not mine.\" (D. & C. 38:27.) IN UNITY- THERE IS STRENGTH: We have been invited to march in step with God in the process of bring- ing about our own salvation. This proposed unity guarantees a maximum of accomplishment. What a thrilling idea to play on God's team, to help to do His work and to co-ordinate our minds and efforts with Him in bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. Think what would happen in any branch where all efforts were perfectly synchronized to do His will. We would then have His spirit. We would multiply our ability and accomplish- ment. We would all be going in the right direction at the right time. \"In unity there is strength.\" If each unit responded as one man, nothing would be impossible. To think would be to act. There would be no \"time lag\" or days or months or years between the impulse and the accomplishment. When the Lord spoke, we would answer. When the President of the Church gave a direction, we would hear. \"We may not know what the future holds, but we do know who holds the future,\" and \"to be in step\" with Him is the greatest opportunity of our existence. AARONIC PRIESTHOOD HA VIC you ever heard people say. \"The eyes of the ivorld arc upon you?\" Have you ever wondered just what is meant by this statement, and how it applies to Aaronic Priesthood bearers ?

As we travelled to our destination, all had the same thought and were looking forward to seeing our relations and above all our old Grandfather Hohepa Heperi. Sunday morning was beautiful. Priesthood meeting and Sun- day School in the Waihou Branch was inspirational, and to be home again with the family was something that will long live with us. \"Haere Mai's Haere-mai inga Tukua-Kana me nga Teina.\" This welcome was given by Brother Hare Nehua Bryers of the Waihou Branch Presidency in the general meeting. Called to speak were Waake Heperi, Taranaki ; Wikitonia Thompson, Dan- nevirke ; Pita N. Bryers, Whangarei ; Rukha Heperi, Waitangi ; and our dear old Grandfather, Hohepa Heperi. He stressed the point of family ties and bore his testimony of the Gospel. After the general meeting kai was served to the children, and we had our Whakapapa meeting. This was well attended by the family and the little Waihou Chapel was overflowing. Much work for our dead was done and Brother Pita Bryers gave good advice about Genealogy work and the seven canoes. At this meeting Brother Ho- hepa Heperi was released as chair- man of the Family Organization and Brother Pita Heperi's name was pre- sented and sustained. At 10 a.m. Monday morning every- one reassembled to do more family group sheets and after this meeting all went down to the river to have our family dinner together. It has been a long time since we sat together as one family. The hangi was very good and our thanks go to Brother Graham Alexander for his advice. We appreciate all those who made this reunion a success. May God bless us at all times that we may keep closer together and be one family here, and for eternity. BROWSINGS AND MUSINGS Every day is the beginning of a nezu year. Only one who has been over the road may become a guide. Opportunity is always zvithin the reach of the arm of preparation. Some of us do not heed a bushel to hide our light; a thimble would suffice. Today is the link which joins the chain of our yesterdays to the chain of our tomorrow.

Peraniko ' neroai, Rhind Emma Wlnnla, Febraari 18, l'.'i i RECORDERS OFFICE, BOX 72, AUCKLAND January, 1958 15 Qjundau CJclteeL By ELDER CLIVE A. PUSEY A FEW months ago I was im- pressed by a seemingly insignifi- cant statement. A man remarking to a friend in reference to some past events, said, \"It seems like the end of an Era.\" An era is understood as a period of time when conditions, ideas, and as- pirations remain at a somewhat even pace. When a distinct change develops, an era passes and is succeeded by a new one. As an example in recent times, we have heard about the \"gay nineties,\" and the \"roaring twenties.\" Eras, then, are the stepping stones of time and building blocks of progress. How many times have you reflected back through the years and let your thoughts rest upon a bygone era? In- variably we all do, and usually spend at least some time comparing con- ditions of that former time with those of today. It seems like the world, the nations, the Church, and the individual pass through many successive eras in the course of God's plan of mortality. Considering individuals for a moment, we find that we think and act differently, in most cases, than we did ten years ago. Things that may have meant everything to us then, have taken a \"back seat\" today. Aspirations in life may have taken on a new light. Perhaps sorrows that seemed at the time would remain forever, have all but been forgotten. In looking at the Church, particu- larly in New Zealand; I feel that it is a period of transition. We are leaving an old era and beginning a new one. The new era shall herald in a period of progress never before experienced in New Zealand. With the dedication of the College and Temple project, the climax of yesterday will be complete and the transition into the future will fade into the birth and maturity of a new era. On the eve of the old and the dawn of the new, where do we as Sunday School workers fit into the picture? What would pass as acceptable yester- day won't be able to meet tomorrow's standards. Leadership must reach new heights. We must, if we will dare to be a part of this new era, push our- selves and our organization to a new high of excellence and level of per- formance. Yes, eras are the stepping stones of time and once we have tread over them they vanish with the opportunity that could have been ours. Eras are like the acts and scenes of a play; they must eventually lead to a climax. May the Lord bless us to shake off the shackles of laxity and indifference that to some extent characterises the fading era of yesterday. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you people of the New Zealand Sunday Schools, and genuinely appre- ciate all the help and co-operation I have received. SACRAMENT GEM FOR JANUARY // any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. (James 1:5.) 16 TE KARERE The aims and objectives as outlined by school officials are five-fold as follows : 1. To provide an inspiring programme of the religious history, principles, scripture and doctrine of the Church. 2. To help students toward full real- ization of individual capacities. 3. To have effective citizenship. 4. To obtain the achievement of in- creasingly effective human relation- ships. 5. To attain economic efficiency. c4 FOR some ten years the people of New Zealand have been working for and looking forward to having a Church College where the youth of the Church could receive instruction in the principles of the Restored Gos- pel along with their secular education. That dream and hope will soon be a reality. Soon after the beginning of the New Year the Church College of New Zealand will open its doors to youth with an invitation for them to enter, study the Gospel and thus strengthen their testimonies in this great Latter- day work. A well-qualified staff of teachers, some local and many from the States, vvil arrive at the College about mid- January to attend institutes and com- plete plans for the opening of school February 10, 1958. This entire staff has been selected because of their faithful Church activity plus their out- standing educational qualification-. The Education programme is being organized under the supervision of the Department of Education of Ww Zea- land and will meet New Zealand standards. Provisional registration of the school, standard procedure, hai already been granted by the Director of Education for the first year. This will be followed by final registration after inspection by the Department. The visit of President Wendell B. Mendenhall, Chairman of the Pacific Board of Education of the Church, and Dr. Owen Cook, Executive Sec- retary of the Board, under whose jurisdiction the College is adminis- tered, added greatly in making final decisions on many policies and prac- tices for the College. The Advisory Committee with the following members, Ariel S. Ballif (Chairman), Clifton D. Boyack (Prin- cipal), Stanford W. Bird (Secretary) and Elders George R. Biesinger, Selu Louis Fruean, William Roberts and Syd Crawford, have been most help- ful in their recommendations for the plans for the school and will continue to advise the College Principal as the year progresses. Every qualified young person who can profit from the instruction to he given at the College should send in their applications tO attend. SoflM scholarship and work assistance is available and Branch and District Presidents will gladly assist am Student desiring further information It is a wonderful privilege tO attend a College where students can stiul> with the influence of the Spirit of the January, 1958 17 Lord. We hope and pray our youth will take full advantage of it. During the past month we have had the pleasure of having Elder Wendell B. Mendenhall, Chairman of the South Pacific Board of Education, and his lovely wife working on the building project and problems relative to the completion of the College-Temple Pro- ject, and setting up the operation of the school. He brings to us in each of these programmes the wishes of the First Presidency, an expression of their interest in our welfare. He and his organization work untiringly for the advancement of the general welfare of the people in this Mission and throughout the South Pacific. Of great importance to us is his announcement as the Chairman of the Building Committee of the Church, that the First Presidency has author- ized the building of our chapels, with 18 TE KARERE Left to right: Dr. Owen J. Cook, Presi- dent Wendell B. Mendenhall, Elder George R. Biesinger and Dr. Clifton D. Boyack. an identical programme to the one that lias made it possible for US to build me Temple and College. We are < ml for this information and for the part played by Elder Mendenhall, Elder Biesinger, and the building organization in making the projected chapel-building programme A Dream Conic True. Briefly, the programme is as fol- lows : We will continue in New Zea- land the organization which has been set up to do our present building. This will be supported by continuation of the financial contributions we are now making toward the maintenance of the working group, though the actual amount will he reduced by approxi- mately 50% of the present contribu- tion. This will begin after the Temple- College Project has been completed. Each branch that receives a building will, of course, have to provide their 30% of the cost of the property and. in addition, continue to send in their branch allotment of the maintenance of the building crew and feed and house the building crew that is on the job during the construction of their chapel. The announcement of such a pro- gramme by the First Presidency pro- vides us with the only possible means by which we could get the building done that we need to have done. It will take us until the end of April to get our present project completed under the present sj stem. The new programme is projected ahead for two years and we hope to have many chapels completed by the end ni that period. In expressing our appreciation for this programme a .ureat deal oi credit must go to those who have laboured so diligently as our labour mission- aries. These men, with their families, have given greatly ^i themselves and their time for the carrying out oi this remarkable programme. We are all mindful of the magnificent work that has been done under the direction of Elder Biesinger in co-operation with the Rne group of the /ion labour missionaries. I am sure that member *>i this Mission joins in ex n • \"in appro iation to ail who have i\" •ni\\ wa\\ contributed to our immc, January, 1958 19 1957— -A Year of Progress JANUARY: ELDER AND SISTER HUGH B.

January, 1958 21 The Mutual Improvement Association MIA is Fun — Let's all Join In I \\AT HEN MIA meetings begin, \" * would you like the hall to be full of happy, smiling faces, waiting eagerly for the programme to begin? True, if you had a larger Church membership or more facilities in your area it might be easier. Perhaps our solution would be an avalanche. Not a destructive slide of rocks, ice, snow and mountain soil, but an avalanche of Enthusiasm. Avalanches always begin at the top of the hill. In MIA this means with the officers. The beginning is usually small, hardly noticeable — snow falling from the limb of a tree, a stone rolling until it nudges loose another, then each coursing down the hill to affect others until, multiplied many times, all opposi- tion is overcome and caught in the cascade. A spark of well-timed, persistent enthusiasm will similarly spread through any group or congregation and will overcome apathy and com- placency if we don't let it become extinguished and dampened by dis- couragement. The MIA has been provided with a fine, active programme for the coming twelve months. As the year begins, let's start the pebbles of Enthusiasm bounding down the hill. SEE YOU AT MIA!!

ELDER, KARL GILES TOP- HAM, Salt Lake City, has been sus- tained as Superintendent of the YMMIA of the New Zealand Mission. He replaces Brother George Dorring- ton who has been released. Elder Topham was actively engaged in Church work prior to his mission call, serving as Superintendent of the Sunday School in the Pacific Branch of the Panama District where he was stationed in the U.S. Army. Elder Topham has laboured in Bay of Plenty, Wellington, and Manawatu Districts. At the time of his appoint- ment he had been serving as Super- vising Elder of the Manawatu District. 24 TE KARERE Promise of 1958 FOR doorways, beginnings, travels, and New Years, the Romans had a God. Janus was their reminder of change, of passing from one scene to another, of old things passing and the arrival of new. Janus was uniquely equipped for his particular assignment with two faces — one looking forward, one back. Carved into the wood or chiselled in stone above the doors, he stood as a re- minder to all who passed beneath at the beginning or ending of a journey; that while some things were left behind and others were ahead, they should contemplate the lessons learned and relate them to the future. Now a January dawn breaks over the biggest year of them all for us. It is a time to reflect briefly upon the year just past — measuring success, recognizing mistakes and momentarily imagining the year that might have been. Then with this as a guide we must take a longer look ahead — at the promise of 1958. The New Year arrives as a most generous gift of a loving Father to His children. In it are 365 stones with which we can construct a stairway or a wall, a palace, or a precipice. Each day reminds anew to offer a prayer of Thanksgiving, presenting us with the opportunity of serving our fellowman, of studying the scriptures and enrich- ing our lives with Gospel knowledge ; of setting stalwart examples upon which family and loved ones can build ; of bearing our testimonies by our con- duct to neighbours ; of obeying the commandments ; of reaching toward the perfection Christ proclaimed and personified. When 1958 closes, the Temple Col- lege project will stand as a dedicated monument to the industry and devotion of the Latter-day Saint people. Many will have proven themselves worthy to enter the Temple and project their families into the eternal ages. Many will have a greater knowledge of the restored Truths and many will be reaping the limitless blessings that follow obedience. These will be able to proclaim with the Prophet Nephi. \"Men are that they might have Joy.\" Will you be one of these? It is our sincere prayer that you will. —ELDER K. G. TOPHAM. \"Speech is the picture oj the mind.\" — Proverbs. \"Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his OWU soul ; he heareth cutting, ami hetraxeth it not.\" —Proverbs 29 24 \"Clear grit is the power t,> say ' \\ \"' to what seems to he a inula:;, angels when they would counsel you away from downright toyaby to your instant duty.\" Robert Collier.

Are you ready with your required Lesson Book, \"Our Mission Primary and the Teach- ers' Kit?\" Have you promoted your 7-year-old children into the next class ? For experienced teachers the first week you may take any activity you have missed. New Teachers, please study carefully the instructions on the first six pages of your Lesson Book. Learn the procedure of your Opening- Exercises. 2nd Week : Friends. 3rd Week: Our Home. 4th Week: Our Family. Explain to the children that we have friends, and that Jesus is our friend, too. Our Homes and our Families are important. Discuss those of people who 26 TE KARERE live in different countries and also those of animals and birds. Top Pilot and Radar Pilot: Take the first four lessons as out- lined from whichever book you have. The subjects are the same. IMPORTANT TO TEACHERS: Study the first instructional pages of your book. These give you helps, guides, and a complete understanding of your calling and the aims of your lesson work. Following these, I am sure you will realise what Primary can do for you and the children. Each officer and teacher must remember she has an objective in her Primary Call- ing, and for success she must find and follow this objective.

Become acquainted with your boys and their parents that you may have their full co-operation in this wonderful pro- gramme. Even if the boys all know each other, use the first week to help them know the Trekker Programme. The objective of the second week's lesson is clearly stated in the Manual, and the boys receive their Trekker Em- blem.

(Deut. 11:11-12.) TODAY we stand upon the thres- hold of a New Year ! We pause upon the verge of the unknown, Thrilled ! Wondering ! Hoping ! as we step forward to possess it. Who can tell what new experiences await us, what changes shall come, or what needs may arise ? The land is a land of hills and valleys, and so it is with life and the assignments we have in Relief Society. It is not all smooth going — and aren't we fortunate that it isn't, for if life was all one level how oppressing the smoothness would be. We need the hills and the valleys! The hills collect the rains for a hundred fruitful valleys. It is the hill difficulty that drives us on. The bleak hills of life that we wonder at amd sometimes grumble about ! Some of us are inclined to linger in the lowlands because we are afraid to climb the hills — the steepness and ruggedness dismay us and we remain in the misty valleys. We do not experience the joys, glory, and blessings that faith and courage can bring because we shrink from the sight of what appears to be something insurmountable. The feeling to know what lies be- yond, the urge to continually per- severe, must ever he with us — pushing and striving until we reach the top that brings down upon us the shower of blessings. Blessings of a work well done ! This brings us to the work we have to do now, the first Leadership meet- ing of this New Year. We know that the district officers cannot be anything other than thoroughly prepared for this first step. Like the hills, we will give of that which we have collected, that all might drink of the water 6f heaven. From the Leadership Convention, daily studies, and thorough planning, all have been \"collected\" and it is now time to \"give and to do,\" that the work of Relief Society may flourish and be fruitful in a haundred valleys. We cannot know what trials lie ahead of us, but we do know that Our Heavenly Father is ever near to take our hand and lead us on the way., Give Him the chance ! Trust Him ! How- ever steep, rugged or stern the hill may be, do not rest satisfied with the lowlands . . . Aspire to a higher, nobler and fulled life. Relief Society will lead us on ! Remembering . . . \"Others may do a greater work But you have your part to do, And no one in all God's heritage Can do it as well as YOU! Blessed are they who have the gift of making friends, for it is one of God's best gifts. It involves many things, but above all, the power of going out of one's self, and appreciating whatever is noble and loving in another. — Thomas Hughes. 28 TE KARERE Here and There in The Mission *#yfc BAY OF ISLANDS DISTRICT By June Rakena On 9th and 10th of November Bay of Islands held their Hui Pariha at the Kaikohe Chapel.

On Friday, 8th November, the dis- trict members held a street bazaar at Kaikohe to raise funds for the Kai- kohe Memorial Hall, as the Church's contribution towards this cause. Alto- gether a sum of £37 was collected and handed over to Mr. Palmer, who is chairman of the Kaikohe Memorial Hall Committee. Tautoro Branch has been running a Talent Quest each Saturday evening to raise money for their chapel and the hall has been filled to capacity the last two Talent Quest evenings.

At the close of 1957 visits were made to the three branches and out- lying areas by the District Presidency. the results of which have been reas- suring. There seems, however, to be a great need for an all-out effort oi every member in good standing to help the inactive members to live the prin- ciples of the Gospel.

The ceilings in the kitchen, cafeteria, snack bar area, and corridor of the David O. McKay Building are now completed, as well as the tiling in the kitchen.

PRIESTHOOD PAGE (Continued from Page 13) ing experience actually occurred and was told in an Improvement Era : Several years ago four boys who had just graduated from High School and had been very active in the Aaronic Priesthood, decided they wanted to \"paint the town red.\" They wanted to find out for themselves if such things as smoking and drinking were as bad as their parents and teachers had made them out to be. Taking their car, they crossed the State line and found a nearby popular tourist resort. Here they looked around until they caught sight of a big Neon sign and the word \"Bar\" flashed before their eyes. They entered the large doors and walked up to the counter. One of the boys gained some courage and said in a timid voice, \"Four beers, please.\" As they started to drink, a man walked up to them and, speaking to one of the boys who was holding a glass of beer, re- marked, \"Are'nt you the son of Mr. Jones? I'm the Vice-President of the Company your Father works for, and I'll never forget how you explained your Mormon Priesthood to one of our executives. You and your mother were at our Company dinner last year and he asked you what it meant to be a 'Mormon Boy.' \" You can draw your own conclusions as to how these four boys felt. Suffice to say, they left the bar heartsick, having learned a lesson they would never forget. This experience illustrates how much \"The eyes of the world are upon us.\" We must always be on guard through living the principles of the Gospel, no matter where we are, for we never know in whose company we may be. Always remember that there is one Person who continually watches us — and that is Our Father in Heaven. For this reason alone we should always strive to be what He would want us to be in the eyes of all mankind. \"Some men are immovable ; some can be moved — and some move.\" — Abrabian saying. * Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and vuith all thy soul, and ivith all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and, thy neighbour as thyself.\" 34 TE KARERE Beatitudes of a Leader * The theme for the Leadership Convention held December 28th and 29th at the Church College was: FOLLOW THE LEADER, WHO KNOWS WHERE HE IS G6f$|!> If In the New Year of 1958 we pray that YOU will be the lead^HM^Vnows where he is going.

BALLIF WE are grateful to our Father in Heaven for the blessing that has been given to the people of this nation through the opening of our new Church College of New Zealand. As a people we have always been interested in the development of school opportunities for our people. Soon after the Church was organized a School of the Prophets was developed for the advancement and the improve- ment of the leadership of the Church. When the beautiful City of Nauvoo was built preparations were included for the establishment of a university and from that time forward the pro- vision for schools and the training of our young people has been a basic part of the programme. From the Bible, particularly in the Book of Proverbs, we read : \"Train up a child in the way he shall go : and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\" (Prov. 22:6.) Also, \"Get wisdom, get understanding : forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee : love her and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is the prin- cipal thing ; therefore get wisdom : and with all thy getting get understand- ing.\" (Prov. 4:5-7.) There has been established in the minds of the people in the Church the importance of having their secular education given under the inspiration of the priesthood of our Father in Heaven. In other words, the Church has always maintained that it is necessary to teach young people the things of this earth by men and women who have a strong testimony as to the divinity of Jesus Christ and who recognize and work in harmony with the priesthood of God our Eternal Father. In the Book of Mormon in 2nd Nephi 9 :29, we read, \"To be learned is good if thy hearken unto the coun- sels of God.\" And in Mosiah 23:14 we read, \"Trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister except he be a man of God, walking in His ways and keep- ing His commandments.\" Frequently in the Doctrine and Covenants encouragement has been given to get knowledge and under- standing. In the 88th Section, 77th and 78th verses, the Lord commanded His people to become enlightened on im- portant things, \"And I give unto you a commandment that ye shall teach one another the doctrines of the king- dom. Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be in- structed more perfectly in theory, in principles, in doctrine, in the law of the Gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God that are expedient for you to understand.\" This instruction definitely pertains to the teaching of the Gospel which should be to all people who enjoy the benefits of our religious education programme and then the Lord goes on to say in the 79th verse of the 88th Section, \"Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass, things which are at home, things which 40 TE KARERE are abroad; the wars and the perplexi- ties of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land ; and a know- ledge also of countries and of king- doms.\" Frequently the Prophet made refer- ence to the value of the training of the mind. He says, for example, in the Doctrine and Covenants 93:36. \"The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.\" And .'•.gain, in the 130th Section, 18th and 19th verses, \"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection and if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than an- other, he will have so much the ad- vantage in the world to come.\" In re-reading the statements made by the Prophet Smith one cannot help but be impressed with the fact that the stimulation and cultivation of the mind were held in great esteem by the Prophet who himself had very little formal education but who received great inspiration and stimulation through his own efforts and particu- larly through the revelations of God to him directly. Joseph Smith said. \"Man was created to till the earth, to cultivate his mind, and to glorify God . . . We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light com- municated from Heaven to the intel- lect ; and that the nearer man ap- proaches perfection, the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoy- ments.\" Karl K. Maeser, who was a great educational leader in our Church and who received his instructions directly from the Prophet Brigham Young, made the following statements, \"I would rather trust my child to a ser- pent than to a teacher who does not believe in God.\" And to continue he said. \"It should be the aim of parents and teachers to encourage the cultiva- tion of intellectuality and will power. so that these faculties may be made available in the performance of the duties and responsibilities of active life and in the endurance of the in- conveniences and trials of mortality.*' Karl G. Maeser was instructed by the Prophet Brigham Young as fol- lows, \"You ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God. That is all. God bless you. Good-bye.\" With these instructions the educational pro- gramme\" of the Church was launched in a very definite way in the Brigham Young Academy at Provo, L'tah. The Brigham Young Academy was organ- ized on October 16. 1S75. and the at- titude toward education in the Church has never changed. Today as then we expect all of our teachers to have a testimony of the Gospel and to teach their subject matter under the enlight- enment of the Spirit of God l\\ver\\ child on earth can benefit by education given under this influence.

It is challenging to aim toward a goal that brings know- ledge of things beyond value. It is thrilling to begin a College with such a goal. What are these things? What will the students learn ? What will the teachers teach? One young man, on his completion of secondary school, said, \"Our job, then, is to meet the world straight on, taking and making opportunities, guar- anteeing ourselves and all who come after us the right to work.\" He had acquired many facts from books ; he had passed examinations on dates and figures, but he had also found courage. Me had learned to work for himself and others with courage enough to meet the world straight on. Our stu- dents will learn courage. They will % attain fortitude and faith and love. And what else? What more will they learn, the stu- dents? What more will they teach, the teachers? What will they experi- ence together?

Love of God and Fellow Men 7 am the way, the truth and the life. Follow me!' NY of us who desire to interpret, teach and apply the principles of the Gospel must follow in the foot- steps of the Master. As a divinely, effective teacher of the Gospel, He has given us an invitation to Follow Him and has set an example never to be equalled. The principle that marks the effectiveness of the Saviour's work more than any other is His application of what we term the Golden Rule : \"... Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind and strength ; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve Him. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ...\" (D. & C. 59:5-6.) In every act of the Saviour's life is revealed His great love for His Father and fellow men. He adhered to the truth and made no compromise for Sin. He taught in simplicity and humility the principles of eternal life and salvation. He fulfilled the responsibility given to Him by His Father. His love was perfect, as He was, and this instruction to those who would follow was, \"Be ye therefore Perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is Perfect.\" How can we, who are representatives of Jesus Christ, give living application to these two great com- mandments ? In the Doctrine and Covenants we find, \"If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my com- mandments.\" Through Joseph Smith the Lord further states, \"No one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love, having faith, hope and charity, being temperate in all things, whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care.\" (D. & C. 12:8.) Then to love God with all one's heart and soul is to serve Him and keep all His commandments. That, of course, includes love of our fellow men. No message can resound with the ring of truth unless it comes from a heart that vibrates and thrills with the love of ( rod and fellow men. \"Let us love one another; for love is \"i God; ami everyone that loveth is born of (i<><i and KNOWETH God.\" ( 1 John 4:7.) To us will come strength »>f character ami a bum ing desire to serve more faithfully, if we apply these two great commandments and strive to follow in the Foot steps of the Master. \"/ am ///e way, ///<■ truth <\"\"/ the life, l:oll<>:K' me\" February, 1958 43 Mission to Hawaii and the U.S. By Stuart Meha President And S. Ballij has asked me to write an article for the \"Te Karere\" regarding my mission to Hawaii ami the U.S.A. Humbly I acknow- ledge the very great honour and privilege that was mine when President David 0. McKay called me to go to the House of the Lord at Laic to translate into Maori the sacred Temple ordinances so that they might he available for the New Zealand Temple which at this stage is nearing completion. I AM deeply grateful to our Heaven- ly Father for this mission, for while working on the ordinances everything I had done in the Temple, my vows and covenants came hack to me. It was in 1913 — 44 years ago — that I went to the Salt Lake City Temple with five others. My first wife, Hinei- turama Tapsell, had passed away the year before, and it was to attend to our endowments and have her sealed to me for time and all eternity. Forty- four years ago is a long time, and to be frank I had forgotten many of the Temple ceremonies. However. I had told myself that I must remember two thing.-;, and observe them. The two things which I had promised to live up to were the Law of Chastity and the Law of Consecration to the Church, for I knew if I failed in them it would be better I had not been born. One cannot go through a House of God too often. The more he goes through the better it is for him, for his mind is refreshed ,and would be constantly reminded of the great bless- ings promised him and awiting him if he remained true and steadfast. I enjoyed the work assigned me. Two Samoan brethren, Tautua Tanoai and Feagaimaalii Galeai, were called to translate the ordinances into the Samoan language for the New Zea- land Temple. These brethren, too, en- joyed their work. After I had finished my work in Hawaii. I was required to go to the Salt Lake City Temple and submit my work to a committee of good Maori- speaking elders. The committee con- sister of President Gordon C. Young, President Reed Halverson, and Paul Mendeuhall. Hine Paewai stenogra- pher, and Dr. Xitama Paewai checker. Mistakes made by me were eliminated and rectified. We worked hard for seven days. There was one day's break and I attended an organ recital in the Tabernacle. In the afternoon we went to the Genealogical office -of the Church where we met Brother Win. Cole, who took us down to the archives where are kept millions and millions of names of people who had been worked for in any of the Temples of God. I asked for a certain name, and within the minute that name was unearthed from among millions with all particulars pertaining to it. I was amazed. It spoke well for the effici- ency of the book-keeping system and the workers connected with this de- partment of Church activities. Then Brother Cole gave me the biggest sur- prise of my life. He showed me my own genealogical chart. He had it neatly typed, and pasted down on calico runners. When he unrolled it. the chart stretched out across the floor 85 feet. Don't misunderstand me. In his working on that chart he had found that I could be related to people who are living today and whom I did not know were related to me. Thus he had brought in the names of people which the whakapapas showed were my kin and whose ancestors came in the Seven Canoes of the Fleet. There- fore I could trace my whakapapa back to the canoes of the Fleet. Dr. Paewai had been in the States nearly a year, visiting Xew York. Washington. Chicago, and many of 44 TE KARERE the great cities of America. He visited some of the great hospitals of the United States, specialising in some medical subject, and which now would qualify him more fully in his medical career. He and Hine went through all the Temples of the Church in the U.S.A., Canada and Hawaii. During my short stay, I was privileged to go through the St. George Temple, the Arizona Temple at Mesa, and the Los Angeles Temple. After we left Salt Lake City, Nitama's passport had only 15 day's life, and after going and visiting St. George, Arizona and Cali- fornia, there was very little time, and by the time we reached Honolulu there was only one more day for the pass- port's duration. We began to fear that Xitama might be barred from coming home, but through the blesssings of the Lord the passport was extended and we all came home together, and we were privileged to attend the Auck- land District Hui Pariha. It was one of the finest huis I have ever attended and that was complimentary to the District Presidency. I would like to refer to one or two things which had impressed me very much during our short sojourn in the three States we travelled through — Utah, Arizona and California. After leaving St. George our objective was Phoenix, capital of Arizona. But ow- ing to the snow we did not make it, and stayed at a hotel at Cameron Staff. The next clay we continued our journey, and went through the Nation- al Park. It was beautifully white with two or more feet of snow on the ground, and the trees and everything were weighed down with snow. Then we came upon the most majestic, and at the same time the most awe- inspiring sight that it had been our lo1 to see. From the several view stations provided for tourists we looked down into the Grand Canyon of the Colorado — the greatest and first of the Seven Wonders of the World. On reaching Grand Canyon Village, we went to a hotel built on the very edge of the Canyon, The view was frightening. Scientists and leading geologists of the world tell us that this split or tear (I can't think of a better word) was caused 3,000,000 years ago by erosion, the act of water, w-ind and snow. Then something flashed across my mind. It was the 8th chapter of 111 Nephi, verses 5-23. These verses tell of the time when the Saviour was crucified in the Eastern Hemipshere in the land around about Jerusalem, but it was the land of America, in the Western Hemisphere which paid the penalty in full as we shall see from these passages I have quoted. Get your Book of Mormon out and study them carefully. 5. And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm, such an one as ne"
