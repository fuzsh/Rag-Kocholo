Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki is honoured to generate this remarkable publication on the occasion of the accompanying exhibition. It is the largest and most ambitious assembly of Lindauer’s works ever presented. The endeavour builds on the successful exhibition and publishing partnerships with the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin, in 2014–15, and the Gallery of West Bohemia in Pilsen (Lindauer’s birthplace), Czech Republic, in 2015. Lindauer’s portraits continue to capture the imagination of the Gallery’s international visitors and remain the most requested works in our collection. More important, however, are the powerful and generative qualities these portraits have – particularly for the many Māori communities across Aotearoa whose direct genealogical affiliations to the portraits are keenly felt. Through the stories associated with each figure these taonga (treasures) provide insight into New Zealand’s past and future. Arresting and compelling, the portraits also highlight the complex intercultural exchanges that occurred at a time of great political, cultural and artistic upheaval. Lindauer’s portraits of Māori remain a vital contribution to New Zealand’s cultural history. The majority of Lindauer’s subjects were prominent figures in nineteenth-century New Zealand life: entrepreneurs and global traders, tour guides and landholders, politicians and diplomats, peacemakers and warriors acting in defiance or defence of the colonial government during the hostile New Zealand Wars of the 1860s. Many of the individuals were rangatira (chiefs) of iwi, several of whom in 1840 signed Te Tiriti o Waitangi, New Zealand’s founding document. These individuals were leading protag­onists whose actions and influence determined the rich unfolding of colonial, political, diplomatic, mercantile, linguistic, military and spiritual life in New Zealand. Among the many markers of burgeoning modernity that informed the late nineteenth century was the ascendancy of mechanically produced images. Having a familiarity with photography as well as training in religious painting in Vienna, Lindauer demonstrated his ability to create an intensity and a directness of the gaze between subject and viewer working from his own studio photography and existing cartes-de-visite in addition to painting from life. Lindauer’s paintings caused a sensation due to their technical proficiency, particularly the dramatic luminosity the artist created with glazing techniques. The combination of vivid realism and powerful subject matter in these portraits contributed to the enthusiastic reception they received at the time of their making – and to their enduring potency. The Gallery became the permanent home to the Partridge Collection of Lindauer’s portraits and genre paintings in 1915. Since 2010, the Gallery’s Whakamīharo Lindauer Online has offered a digital portal into the stories of the tīpuna (ancestors) portrayed in these precious taonga. Much of the information has been given by descendants and provides a deep pool of knowledge and a collective memory. I thank the many contributors to this publication, for their insightful and thoughtful observations and significant new research, and the descendants for their generosity and support for our work. I honour the late Jonathan Mane-Wheoki CNZM for his vision and foresight. The combined illumination of all in this book will pave the way for future understanding of Lindauer’s work and the world he inhabited.\n\n8\n\nHe Kupu Whakataki Elizabeth Ellis\n\nKimihia te mea ngaro — ka tuohu koe, he maunga teitei He moemoeā i tutuki — ko ō mātou tapuwae, ō mātou roimata i mahue . . . Ka mihi ki a koutou, tātou katoa hoki e whakarere tapuwae ana mō ngā uri whakaheke. Tēnā koutou. Search for what is hidden — and only bow to lofty mountains Our dreams are realised — only our footprints and tears are left behind . . . I send my thanks to all of you, to all of us who are leaving footprints for our future generations. Greetings. This is a book that speaks to many things: New Zealand’s art history, the life and works of portraitist Gottfried Lindauer, art patronage in nineteenth-century colonial society, paintings of Māori between the years 1874 and 1910 and the upheavals in Aotearoa at that time. This significant book complements the comprehensive website Whakamīharo Lindauer Online, and the beautiful television documentary series launched in 2013 entitled Behind the Brush, which focuses on the lives of Māori painted by Lindauer. And the book echoes the grand and successful Gottfried Lindauer exhibitions in Berlin, Germany, in 2014, and Pilsen in the Czech Republic in 2015; and now in 2016 here at Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki. Gottfried Lindauer’s New Zealand: The Māori Portraits focuses on a politically contested period in the making of New Zealand’s identity and history and presents new research and insights about familiar and forgotten pasts that sit behind Lindauer’s life and paintings. Remarkable individual histories of ancestors and the specifics of the past are discussed from today’s perspective. As an active Māori arts advocate, I know that providing future citizens of the world more, not less, history is the key to understanding the specifics of our place in the world: that of Māori and of Pākehā. The faces portrayed by Lindauer hold a space of political contradiction and tension that reaches back 140 years. The portraits remain culturally, socially and personally significant to descendants who carry the names, deeds and histories of ancestors. This book comes at a time of post-Treaty of Waitangi settlement in New Zealand, when we are able to reflect on the journeys that Māori have been taking since 1840, and, as we turn to the future, consider new ways to articulate our history and celebrate our survivance.

Guido Reni’s early seventeenth-century series of Saint Sebastian paintings has endured in European art history as a paragon of male beauty, sainthood and martyrdom. Gottfried Lindauer had a subject he kept returning to over a period of twenty-four years: his\n\narchetype of female beauty was Heeni Hirini and Child (formerly known as ‘Ana Rupene and\n\nChild’, see Plate 29), a mother-and-child series he started in 1878. The portrait can be read as an exemplar representing abiding hope for Māori people beaten by British colonisation. Hirini can also be understood as the Māori mother of Māori survivance. Women literally bear the future, as illustrated by the child on her back. Her breaking smile and that of the child is bright and uplifting. Whether Lindauer intended, there is a Christian overtone to the painting that, like his subject, is quietly powerful and might signal that Māori conversion to Christianity is a large part of the colonial story. Multiple paintings of a single subject were not attempted in nineteenth-century New Zealand painting to the degree accomplished by Lindauer. At the time of writing, twelve of a purported thirty versions of Heeni Hirini and Child have been located, offering insights and new understandings of Lindauer’s paintings and subjects.\n\nLeft: Guido Reni, Saint Sebastian, c. 1625, oil on canvas, 1670 x 1276 mm, Mackelvie Trust Collection, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, gift of James Tannock Mackelvie, 1882 Right: Gottfried Lindauer, Heeni Hirini and Child, 1878, oil on canvas, 680 x 560 mm, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, gift of H.E.

Gottfried Lindauer’s creative process and his use of photography in creating the largest number of painted portraits of nineteenth- and twentiethcentury Māori is an undeniable fact, but one which was unknown to many previous to this project. Retrospectively, this is interesting but does not take away from the painted portraits by a professional artist who made a significant and unprecedented record of a time and place. Yet Lindauer can be applauded as an artist ahead of his time. His contemporary critics and subsequent historians have criticised his style of portraiture as being flat and unsophisticated. The fact that he painted from photographs has also brought him criticism, but Lindauer was not alone in this respect. The twentieth-century portraitist Charles Goldie (1870–1947) used the same photograph of Tāmati Wāka Nene that Lindauer used to create his posthumous portrait of Nene (Plate 5). When the paintings by both artists are overlayed on the original photograph, the match is identical. Indeed, many artists explored the medium of photography to varying degrees. For example, when the itinerant artist Eugene von Guérard depicted picturesque Lake Wakatipu, he reversed the glass plate and illustrated the canoe sailing backward. Lindauer\n\n12\n\nEugene von Guérard, Lake Wakatipu with Mount Earnslaw, Middle Island, New Zealand, 1877–79, oil on canvas, 991 x 1765 mm, Mackelvie Trust Collection, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, purchased 1971\n\nwas an accomplished photographer, a skill he most likely acquired in Pilsen before he migrated to New Zealand in 1874, and was certainly proficient in by the time of his settled later life. Lindauer’s self-portraits and his paintings of his wife Rebecca and family members are based on his own photographs. Details in his large scene paintings representing Māori life are also drawn from his studio-based photography practice. His long-time friend and supporter Samuel Carnell (1832– 1920) is known to have given Lindauer access to his photographs. However, other photographers such as the Foy Brothers (James Foy, 1844–90 and Joseph Foy, c. 1847–1923) may not have been happy with Lindauer’s borrowing; certainly Elizabeth Pulman (1836–1900) is known to have objected to the practice of other photographic studios reproducing her photographs. For those who presume the Māori and Pākehā portraits commissioned from Lindauer by patron collectors and individuals were done from life, the overwhelming evidence that subjects were often painted from or on photographs may be surprising, as it was to Lindauer’s descendants who have contributed to this research. Descendants who have inherited portraits are fully connected to the likeness of their fore­ bears. The private commissioning process has produced several generations who have grown up with Lindauer’s portraiture as familial images. Other descendants come to the portraits with little knowledge of tīpuna. Exhibitions of Lindauer’s portraits provide public access and curators and researchers close gaps in museum and descendant knowledge by sharing what is known about subjects. The focus on Lindauer’s portraits at Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki and the recent international exhibitions in Berlin and Pilsen has drawn critical acclaim for Lindauer’s New Zealand and his Māori portraits. His portraits are on permanent display in hapū marae and private homes and brought out at tangihanga and other equally important Māori occasions. More recently, reproductions of portraits have been exhibited at Treaty of Waitangi settlement claim hearings. Institutions of art and history must be open to correcting institutional information, just as descendants should to be open to receiving new information about tīpuna.\n\nLeft: Gottfried Lindauer, Tamati Waka Nene, 1890 (detail), oil on canvas, 880 x 700 mm, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, gift of H.E.

Partridge, 1915\n\nNot lost in the resurgence of exhibition making and research is an expectation from descendants to be consulted on cultural and personal terms. This is not unreasonable, but time and resources are required to properly meet requests. A growing number of descendants disagree with each other about basic facts pertaining to their forebears and at times there is simply no knowledge among hapū or there is insufficient time to continue inquiries. A common issue between museums and Māori descendants is an expectation to travel with their ancestors to international venues and to attend exhibition openings. Another issue is the belief that the reproductions of Lindauer’s images of ancestors could be a source of income. However, some descendants are supportive of disseminating images of tīpuna widely so that the image of their forebears is always in the sightline of future generations, some of whom may live in other parts of the world. These are part of the behind-the-scenes realities when working with ancestral portraits. The rewards are better relationships, trust and the sharing of kōrero. Alongside the art historical space, the Treaty of Waitangi process throws into relief what information on ancestors resides in the hapū, iwi and whānau space, and how much research is being produced through the Treaty of Waitangi Tribunal by historians. Descendants have come to rely on published accounts rather than oral histories handed down the generations; indeed, in some cases, information did not get passed down. It is difficult and practically impossible to know all things about a historical period. History is living and continuous. This project shows that Lindauer’s Māori portraits are protagonists in a history that began nearly a century and a half ago when he started painting tīpuna. The portraits stimulate inquiry because the images have mana that still resides with hapū and whānau. The collective survivance of Māori is captured in the image of Heeni Hirini and Child because it inspires hope and is centred on the future.\n\n14\n\nIntroduction: Gottfried Lindauer’s New Zealand Zara Stanhope and Ngahiraka Mason\n\nMāhau rānei ahau, māhau rānei koe Roto i ō kamo, te kupu mai ki au Kaua he rā e huri, tahuri mai ki au Māku rānei ahau, māhau rānei koe.1\n\nPerhaps I am yours, or you are for yourself In your eyes is your message to me Don’t let a day pass by, turn, turn to me\n\nA\n\nPerhaps I am for myself, or you are for yourself.\n\nt the turn of the twentieth century, hundreds of people visited a small upstairs gallery on Queen Street in Auckland to view portraits of Māori by the artist Gottfried Lindauer. Lindauer, a migrant from Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic) who arrived in New Zealand in 1874, began exhibiting portraits of Māori subjects in 1876.2\n\nThe inscriptions left by Māori visitors in the Queen Street gallery’s visitors’ books attest to their strong interest in the images of their leaders, whānau and tīpuna. Apart from being the subjects of Lindauer’s portraits, Māori commissioned painted portraits of their tīpuna, and these portraits were exhibited by hapū, whānau and iwi in marae and at tangihanga as part of whānau taonga, alongside photographs which had become the conventional mode of representation. The portraits, which are today living ancestors to uri whakaheke (descendants) of the sitters, and often the only surviving images of ancestors, are the primary subject of this book, alongside Lindauer’s large scene paintings of Māori life. Lindauer was an artist who helped form public relationships with Māori, and Māori engaged\n\nwith Lindauer as an artist. The new writing in this volume reveals the story of how Gottfried Lindauer, born a citizen of the Austrian empire in 1839,3 came to be called Rinitana4 by the Ngāti Hikairo ki Tongariro people of Ngāti Tūwharetoa and why his paintings are meaningful to succeeding generations of New Zealanders.5 Both Māori and Pākehā points of view of colonial New Zealand and the histories and contemporary significance of the people and the artist who depicted them are discussed here, and gathered together through a Māori perspective. Lindauer came from a modernising Europe. His home town Pilsen — encircled by Germany to the west and north, Poland to the northeast, Moravia to the east and Austria to the south — was at the centre of the wealth-producing heartland of the Austrian empire. Born into a middle-class Christian background, Lindauer undertook private tuition, becoming an academic painter with a focus on religious commissions and portraits. Historians Aleš Filip and Roman Musil offer a detailed overview of Lindauer’s biography and practice from the perspective of central Europe. After being conscripted for a second time to serve in the Austrian Army, Lindauer departed Bohemia via Hamburg on board the Reichstag, with a plan for a short-term stay in New Zealand.6 He arrived in Wellington on 6 August 1874 and made Aotearoa New Zealand his permanent home.\n\n15\n\nGottfried Lindauer, Self-Portrait and Rebecca Lindauer, c. 1890, cabinet cards, private collections\n\nLindauer initially spent time in Nelson, where he learned English and embarked on a practice as itinerant painter and photographer. He established the first of his studios on Nelson’s Trafalgar Street, commencing the practice of painting from life and from carte-devisite photographs. Moving to Auckland at the end of 1875, Lindauer made contact with Māori subjects, facilitated by introductions made by businessman Henry Partridge (1848–1931), who was to become his most important patron. As his practice grew, Lindauer began exhibiting his portraits of Māori: in the front window of a Wellington bookstore in 1877; in a first solo exhibition, in Cambridge, in 1880. He married in the late 1870s and, after his first wife Emelia Wipper died in 1880, for a second time in 1885, to Rebecca Petty, with whom he had two sons, Hector Carnell Partridge and Victor Wilhelm. All through this period, and spurred by constant travelling around New Zealand as well as a trip back to Europe in 1886, his reputation as a portrait painter grew. The national and international context for Lindauer as a colonial artist in New Zealand and the ways his art operated, both as symbolic and metaphysical images for Māori and ethnographic documents at a time of an emerging Pākehā identity, are discussed by art historian Leonard Bell. A key contribution to this book is the new research into Lindauer’s studio practice and his creative method. Sarah Hillary presents insights into Lindauer’s use of photography in his compositions, as well as his technique of painting over photographs to create portraits. Lindauer took his own bromide studio photographs of Māori and Pākehā subjects, as well as employing images by established photographers such as Samuel Carnell7 and the Foy Brothers. Ute Larsen and Jane Davidson-Ladd combine conservation and art historical research to bring new knowledge to Lindauer’s practice as a photographer–painter.\n\n16\n\nHenry Edward Partridge in about 1899, taken by an unknown photographer. Image kindly supplied by Bruce W. Graham\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence about the number of portraits of Māori and Pākehā Lindauer produced: writers in this volume indicate that his output was prolific, although it is difficult to enumerate precisely. The extent of his production can be gathered from the notebook in which Lindauer detailed his earnings from Māori portraits: a grand total of £4,474, including £1,421 contributed by patron Henry Partridge.8 After moving around between Wellington, Thames, Christchurch, Hawke’s Bay and Cambridge, Lindauer settled in Woodville, north Wairarapa, in 1889 with his wife and his two young sons. He was also a favoured portraitist for Pākehā New Zealanders until photography became affordable. Jane Davidson-Ladd discusses cases of portrait commissioning in this book, arguing that the Māori portraits cannot be understood without recognition of the totality of Lindauer’s portrait output. Lindauer’s practice and his role as a painter of Māori were bolstered by Henry Partridge. Ngahiraka Mason’s essay analyses how this complex historical relationship remains important for uri whakaheke today. Partridge amassed the largest extant collection of Lindauer’s paintings — numbering sixty-two portraits and eight scenes from Māori life (the latter painted between 1901 and 1910) — and opened the Queen Street gallery devoted to Lindauer’s work.9 Also a migrant but from Great Britain, Partridge met Lindauer — then recently arrived in New Zealand — in 1875 and immediately struck a commissioning arrangement with him, acquiring four portraits that first year. Partridge was instrumental in introducing Lindauer to Māori — both as subjects of paintings and as potential commissioners of portraits in their own right — and to other Pākehā clients. Ngahiraka Mason discusses the Partridge Collection in depth. Lindauer’s other major patron was Sir Walter Lawry Buller (1838–1906). Buller had many roles in colonial New Zealand and his reputation was well established with Māori, as he had mastered the Māori language and developed important relationships with prominent chiefs. A lawyer and ornithologist,10 Buller was the native commissioner for the South Island in the late 1850s. In 1861 he held the position of honorary secretary to the Auckland Kohimarama meetings of Māori chiefs and was resident magistrate of Manawatū, before becoming a judge of the Native Land\n\n17\n\nGottfried Lindauer, unidentified sitter (possibly the subject of the painting Hinepare of the Ngati Kahungunu Tribe of Takitimu Fame, Plate 50), c. 1880, glass-plate negative (digitally inverted 2015), private collection\n\nCourt in 1865.11 Buller was also editor of The Maori Messenger, a bilingual newspaper, and from 1885 editor of the weekly Māori newspaper Te Karere o Poneke. Napier photographer Samuel Carnell introduced Buller and Lindauer, suggesting that claimants in land court hearings might be interested in commissioning portraits of themselves and/or their tīpuna; Buller received paintings for his own collection as commission for introductions to subjects in Cambridge.12 This made Lindauer’s practice viable and changed his plans to return to Europe. Buller was interested in Lindauer’s art for multiple reasons. As well as establishing a collec­ tion at little cost by providing Lindauer with introductions for other commissions, he also had an ethnographic perspective.13 After retiring from the law in 1886, Buller took up a prestigious role as one of New Zealand’s commissioners to the 1886 Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London. Twelve Lindauer paintings from Buller’s collection were loaned for the London exhibition, including Lindauer’s 1886 painting Terewai Horomona (The Maori Poi-dancer), a portrait of eighteen-year-old Terewai Grace Horomona Elkington, which Buller gifted to the British royal family after it was admired by the then Prince of Wales.14 Buller was rewarded with New Zealand’s first knighthood to a colonial-born citizen. These patrons recognised the importance of documenting both Māori and Pākehā during times of great change. Lindauer, the European painter, obviously had a deep interest in Māori. This volume brings a Māori perspective by a range of writers to Lindauer’s work. Lindauer painted key Māori protagonists for Partridge’s collection, including: Tāmati Wāka Nene (Plate 5), who was instrumental in forming Māori opinion in regard to the Treaty of Waitangi; chiefs who signed the Treaty and those who refused to sign it; leaders such as Wiremu Tāmihana Tarapīpipi\n\n18\n\nTe Waharoa (Plate 15), who promoted unity of Māori and coexistence with Pākehā; loyalists including Major Rāpata Wahawaha (Plate 47); Māori members of parliament and advocates of Māori tradition such as Pāora Tūhaere (Plate 9). In the interests of respecting the mana of his subjects, Lindauer developed a good under­ standing of certain aspects of te ao Māori. The Tohunga-ta-moko at Work (Plate 70) portrays tohunga ahurewa Winitana Tūpōtahi of Ngāti Maniapoto in the King Country chanting, as an expert tohunga tā moko applies the beginnings of a rangi paruhi (full-face tattoo) with an uhi (chisel) on the face of a young chief. Lindauer’s concern for accuracy regarding traditions such as the ceremonies of tā moko is documented in his letters to Vojtěch and Josefa Náprstek, founders of a museum of ethnography in Prague.15 Lindauer’s descriptions of the full process of receiving rangi paruhi evidence a detailed knowledge which required interaction with tohunga. Other examples are Lindauer’s annotated drawings of the moko of Tāraia Ngākuti of Ngāti Maru sent to his friends in Prague.16 He also used taonga and kākahu (garments) as props in many portraits, some of which were gifts the painter received from his subjects, such as a patu parāoa from the Māori king Tāwhiao (Plate 18) on the occasion of Lindauer’s wedding. Kahutoi Te Kanawa and Ngahiraka Mason provide a discussion of the kākahu depicted by Lindauer as a celebration of Māori tradition. Lindauer’s respect for Māori and concern for accurate preservation of culture is reflected in his commissioning of new taonga to send to Europe, rather than asking Māori for existing iwi and personal treasures.17\n\nGottfried Lindauer, Mrs Haromi, Hastings H.B., 1885, oil on canvas, 678 x 522 mm, private collection, Auckland\n\n19\n\nThere is evidence that Māori also seemed to approve of the details conveyed in Lindauer’s work. In February 1883 the Māori newspaper Te Korimako ran a story entitled ‘Nga Whakaahua a Rinauera’ (Lindauer’s Portraits) about works then on display in a shopfront in Cambridge. Included in the show was a portrait of Tāwhiao, commissioned by Walter Buller, and a likeness of Waikato Tainui tohunga Te Aokatoa, who was expert in karakia, commissioned by one Meiha Hakihona (Major Jackson). The article described the paintings in detail: Ko te puweru o Te Aokatoa, he korohunga, he mere-pounamu kei te ringa. (The garment worn by Te Aokatoa is a cloak with an ornamental border, he has a greenstone mere in his hand.) Te Puweru o te Kingi, he kahu kiwi, he mere paraoa kei te ringa. He kotore huia kei te mahunga, he kuru kahurangi kei te taringa. Pai atu hoki te tu. (The garment worn by the King is a kahu-kiwi, he has a whalebone mere in his hand. He has an ornament, a huia tail feather in his hair and one greenstone ornament in his ear. He stands proud.) Nui atu te whakapai a nga Maori, me nga Pakeha ki enei ahua, a, e kiia ana, katahi te tuturu tohunga whakaahua tangata, ka kitea mai kite motu nei. 18 (Both Māori and Pākehā alike have much praise for these portraits, and are saying it is the first time the work of such a master painter has been seen in this country.)\n\nThis commentary offers a sense of Māori responses to Lindauer’s images.\n\nThe New Zealand Court in the Forestry, Fish and Game Building at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 1904, St Louis, Missouri, United States.

Ngāpuhi historian Haare Hongi, Te Arawa scholar Maggie Papakura and politicians James Carroll (Plate 52), Māui Pōmare and Hōne Heke (Plate 3) all recorded their visits, alongside Native Land Court judges, colonial administrators James Mackay and T.E. Donne, historians James Cowan, Percy Smith and Elsdon Best, artists Allen Hutchinson, Kennett Watkins, Charles Blomfield and Charles Goldie and historian and collector W.D. Skinner. In this book, Chanel Clarke discusses the complex cultural intersections of late nineteenth-century New Zealand and specific portraits by Lindauer that indicate Māori fashioning their own identities in complex processes of exchange and dialogue. Acknowledging the range of agency held by Lindauer’s sitters in their selection of dress or weapons and personal adornment of moko and taonga, Ngarino Ellis argues that Lindauer’s paintings are a significant aspect of the history of the Māori body. The value that Māori visitors to the Queen Street gallery saw in Lindauer’s paintings helps us understand why the preceding Māori generation had joined Partridge, Buller and other Pākehā patrons in commissioning paintings. They included Peti Karaitiana of Hawke’s Bay, who commissioned eight paintings.20 The 1891 portrait titled Matuaahu was commissioned by Ngāti Tūwharetoa’s Ngāti Hikairo ki Tongariro of the Rotoaira Basin in the central North Island and, according to descendants, Lindauer visited the marae for several weeks that year. When\n\n21\n\nhe delivered the chief’s portrait, it was immediately put on display in the carved meetinghouse Ōkahukura, where it has since remained. Matuaahu died in 1887 and his posthumous portrait was based on a photograph. The painting is inscribed with the name ‘G. Rinitana’, given by the chief’s hapū who considered Lindauer part of their whānau. Lindauer also wove his own family into his paintings of the Māori world. Hector, his elder son, appears in Time of Kai (Plate 73) on the far left of the painting wearing a white shirt and dark pants. Wife Rebecca is also cast in the painting as a turban-wearing, joyful kuia (older woman) looking directly out from the canvas on the far right, tucked behind two male figures. These scene paintings show Lindauer bringing together two cultures in subtle, personal, and yet telling, ways. His patronage was also bicultural as the example of the portrait of the Ngāti Tama chieftainess Hūria Mātenga (Plate 26) commissioned by the citizens of Nelson attests.21 It has been proposed that Lindauer, as a recorder of his time, and his art represent wide-reaching and powerful intercultural encounters.22 Lindauer’s portraits continue to have agency in the twenty-first century because they elevate Māori life and key historical figures and are part of the changing post-Treaty of Waitangi environment that has been in play since 1840. This book and the information in this introduction are the kaupapa of Ngahiraka Mason, Indigenous Curator, Māori Art at Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki until 2015. She brings to this project twenty years of work in the field. Mason has worked with many of the descendants of Lindauer’s subjects in regard to the paintings, the Lindauer website,23 exhibitions of Lindauer’s work at the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin and the Gallery of West Bohemia, Pilsen, in 2014–15, and now this book and the accompanying exhibition. Fundamental to her contribution to this project has been the practising of a Māori worldview, which looks to learn from what has gone before in order to contribute to the shaping of the present. Mason refers to her time with the portraits as edifying as she searched for ways to convey ‘he kanohi kitea, he hokinga mahara’ (faces seen, memories stirred). As the Māori subjects in the paintings have living connections with their descendants, Māori communities are stakeholders in any exhibitions and published accounts of their ancestors. Mason has enabled this project to take place by earning the trust of hapū and iwi descendants of Lindauer’s Māori and Pākehā subjects, who have given their time and shared their knowledge. In addition, Lindauer’s direct descendants have been great supporters. Mason and the other contributors to this book have approached their essays with those communities in mind. For Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, it is also an occasion to renew connections between the institution and special groups of constituents and to get to know each other face to face. The concluding words need to be those of Ngahiraka Mason: ‘For more than a hundred years, descendants have held fast to these evocations of their tīpuna. The portraits add tangible knowledge and relations to our present times and instruct with tūmanako (hope) and love as ways forward from opaque histories toward new and optimistic understandings of Aotearoa’s past.’ Kia kotahi te kōhao o te ngira e kuhuna ai te miro mā, te miro pango, te miro whero. Ā muri kia mau ki te whakapono, kia mau ki ngā ture, kia mau ki te aroha. (There is but one eye of the needle through which must pass the white thread, the black thread and the red thread. Hold fast to faith, hold fast to the lore/laws, hold fast to love.) — Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, 1850\n\n22\n\nThe View from Central Europe: A Bohemian Artist in New Zealand\n\nAleš Filip and Roman Musil\n\nA\n\nmajor retrospective of Gottfried Lindauer’s work was held in 2015 in Pilsen, the capital of West Bohemia and the city of his birth.1 This was the first opportunity to combine in one exhibition the two major stages of his painting: his work before he left Europe and the paintings he created later in New Zealand. Research\n\ninto Gottfried Lindauer’s life and work in New Zealand has been conducted for several decades, but it was only in preparation for the Pilsen exhibition that new research about him was undertaken in the Czech Republic, drawing on findings from the 1960s.2 Hence, we have taken a heuristic approach to the subject matter, focusing on new knowledge about Lindauer’s biographical information.3 We discuss how the artist perceived his new home country and how he described it to his Czech compatriots. Overall, we are offering an interpretation of Lindauer’s\n\nwork by comparing his early work in Europe with the later painting produced on the opposite side of the world. Artistic beginnings and early career in central Europe Gottfried Lindauer was born on 5 January in 1839, the third of six children of Ignác (Hynek) Lindauer, a caretaker of the Archdeacon’s Garden in Pilsen. He was baptised the day after his birth by a Catholic priest at St Bartholomew Church in the same city. The Lindauer family had come to West Bohemia from Germany during the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48) and settled in Útušice, a village near Pilsen. Gottfried’s grandfather, Matěj (Mathias) Lindauer, was the last of the family born in the village; he married Terezie Sokolová in 1801 in Pilsen and settled in the city. Alžběta Schmidová (née Patage), Gottfried’s maternal grandmother, was Spanish, born in Tarragona in Catalonia. His parents decided that Gottfried should take up his father’s profession and at the age of thirteen he started working in the Archdeacon’s Garden. There he demonstrated his artistic talent in drawings inspired by nature. In 1855, when he was sixteen, he went to Vienna to study fine arts. Most sources state that Lindauer was a student of Josef Führich and Leopold Kupelwieser, professors of historic and religious painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna; however, his name is not listed among the students enrolled there.4 According to Lindauer’s own memoir as recorded by the painter’s family, the young Gottfried Lindauer and Janić, a fellow student from the Balkans, lived in the flat of Professor Führich in Vienna,5 suggesting that Lindauer was Führich’s private student. However, the most important influence in the formation of his painting skills was the practical training he received at the studio of the Mainz-born painter Carl Hemerlein (1801–84), who had moved to Vienna in 1838 at the invitation of Prince Klemens von\n\n23\n\nMetternich, the chancellor of the Austrian empire and his compatriot from Rhineland. The first mention of Lindauer’s presence in Hemerlein’s studio dates back to 1857, when the artist was eighteen years old.6 Lindauer worked there until he established an independent studio in Pilsen in the mid-1860s, although there is no evidence to suggest that he did not occasionally collaborate with the studio after he left. The largest Hemerlein project that Lindauer participated in was the decoration of the newly erected pilgrimage chapel of Sts Cyril and Methodius in Valašské Klobouky in East Moravia. The year 1863 marked a thousand years since the arrival of the saints, two brothers from Thessalonica in Greece, in Moravia as Christian missionaries to lands that were, for the most part, pagan. Cyril created the first Slavic alphabet, the Glagolitsa, and the brothers translated the Bible into the Slavonic language. Their lives are depicted in a series of eight paintings inside the chapel. Written evidence indicates that the series was probably painted by Hemerlein with the participation of his employees, painters who worked in his studio in Vienna.7 Lindauer participated in the selection of themes and acted as the contact between Hemerlein and Father Jan Bartoš, who commissioned the series. Hemerlein indicated Lindauer’s significant role in the commission when he stated: ‘[The] Czech book sent to Lindauer served as the guiding line.’8 This book was most probably the biography of the saints by Jan Evangelista Bílý, with illustrations by M. Müller that clearly influenced the compositional schemes of certain paintings of the series in Valašské Klobouky.9\n\nValašské Klobouky, Sts Cyril and Methodius Chapel, interior with the main altar, 1863–64.

Sts Cyril and Methodius Chapel, Valašské Klobouky. Photos: Oto Palán\n\nThe altar painting shows the heavenly apotheosis of Sts Cyril and Methodius triumphing over the Devil. Grouped around this are six paintings, of Sts Peter and Paul and the Four Evangelists. These paintings differ from the other works in the chapel in having gold backgrounds and in their simple composition using a single figure with accompanying attributes. Spatial illusion is cleverly created in the lower section by placing the figure barefoot on the ground against the gold background. The style of the figures is based on early works of Hemerlein, as seen in St Lawrence Church, called Schottenfeldkirche, in Vienna. The painting of St John differs from those of the other Evangelists in having a more expressive face. The use of a side-view suggests that a live model was used and a comparison with Lindauer’s early self-portrait (c. 1862) indicates that the model was the painter himself and that the image of St John, the ‘Lord’s favourite’, may be a (cryptic) self-portrait. We can assume that Lindauer (with the aid of Franz Krisch) painted the pictures with the golden background in the Valašské Klobouky chapel, drawing on Hemerlein models, as well as the eight simple figural medallions above the windows showing Czech and Polish saints made using the al secco technique.10 Transcripts of Lindauer’s memories contain several mentions of Josef Führich being a most admired teacher,11 but it is surprising that they do not mention Carl Hemerlein, whose practice was more influential on the young artist. The reason, perhaps, was that Lindauer wanted to con­ vey the impression of being a highly trained professional artist and hence emphasised academic achievement over practice in a painter’s studio. This notion is supported by the advert­ise­ments Lindauer posted shortly after his arrival in New Zealand, in which he described himself as a\n\n25\n\ngraduate of Vienna’s Academy of Fine Arts,12 although he appears to have never been a full student there. Josef Führich, who taught at the academy, was a leading practitioner of Nazarenism,13 an artistic school formed by students who led a revolt against the teaching of the Vienna acad­emy in 1809. The following year four of the rebels moved to Rome where they established a community reminiscent of a monastic order, which focused on the restoration of Christianity in the arts through the study of medieval and Renaissance religious art. In a strange turn of events, some of the rebelling students later became professors in fine arts academies in Germany and Vienna, establishing Nazarenism as the preferred academic method. In the end, the excessive, uncritical popularity of Nazarenism would act against the method, which later reduced into schematism or the mere repetition of proven models. Nevertheless, when Lindauer studied in Vienna in the 1850s, the city was known as the centre for the highest form of Nazarenistic art, represented, for example, by the decoration of the Altlerchenfelderkirche under the super­ vision of Führich. Hemerlein was also a Nazarenist who specialised in religious themes; however, he reached beyond the traditional Nazarenist linear style to create illusionary paintings with vivid colours, a skill he had acquired during his studies in Paris. This is clearly visible in his 1858 self-portrait with his wife.14 Hemerlein also worked as the keeper in Metternich’s library and he was more\n\nCarl Hemerlein, Death of St Joseph, c. 1849, side altar of the Church of St Lawrence (Schottenfeldkirche) in Vienna, oil on canvas, dimensions unknown.

Interestingly, one of his altar paintings was designed for Pilsen, Lindauer’s birthplace, and two others are included in the decoration of Metternich’s funeral chapel in Plasy, near Pilsen. It was common practice in Hemerlein’s studio to insert existing figurative models into new compositions and this was the method used in the decoration of Sts Cyril and Methodius Chapel in Valašské Klobouky. Among many models who reappeared is the bearded old man with long hair, who is shown first as St Joseph in Hemerlein’s altar painting at Schottenfeldkirche in Vienna (c. 1849), then as Abraham in The Sacrifice of Abraham in Valašské Klobouky (c. 1861) and, finally, in 1864 as St Luke at Sts Cyril and Methodius Chapel.15 This method, quite popular at the time, has received very little attention in art historical writings; if recognised at all, it is viewed as an artist’s repeated use of a figure or design.16 After the mid-nineteenth century, this approach would be gradually replaced by figurative models based on photographs. Lindauer’s first signed painting dates back to 1861, when he was aged twenty-two. Cain above Dead Abel, at the Catholic parish in Valašské Klobouky, is a detailed rendering of Genesis 4, 9–15: God’s speech to Cain after he committed fratricide. The baroque composition, use of chiaroscuro and monumental gestures give the painting the look of works from Hemerlein’s studio. The links become even more prominent in the unsigned The Sacrifice of Abraham, to which Cain is a pendant.\n\n27\n\nThe most important chapter of Lindauer’s work, which would later become his specialty, began with his c. 1862 Self-portrait. A melancholy, partly obscured face with longish hair hints at a romantic sentiment in the young painter. He is wearing a Slavic festive coat with ornamental ribbon and cape. This type of coat was worn as a national uniform after 1848, the year revolution swept Europe, and indicates his allegiance to the idea of the emancipation of the Czech nation within the Austrian empire. Some of the major personalities who fought for this cause had their portraits painted wearing that type of garment, including the poet, journalist and national revivalist Karel Havlíček Borovský. Lindauer also used the garment in his portrait\n\nGottfried Lindauer, Self-portrait, c. 1862, oil on canvas, 550 x 450 mm, Museum of West Bohemia in Pilsen, inv. no. NMP 71672.

The portrait of Svidenský resembles a carte-de-visite photograph in its rounded-corner format and the pose of the figure sitting on a chair, and it contains one of the motifs that would characterise Lindauer’s later work: the lighter colouring of the background highlighting the sitter’s head and hinting at a halo. Lindauer began working independently in the mid-1860s. When Father Jan Bartoš, who had worked with Lindauer at Valašské Klobouky, became the parish priest in Vizovice in 1865, he engaged the painter to decorate the local St Lawrence Church and a parish building.17 These religious paintings of Lindauer still demonstrate the influence of Hemerlein. Around the same time, he established a studio in Pilsen specialising in portraits of local citizens, the earliest of which went back to 1866 and was of Kristián Lexa, a master builder, with his wife Markéta.18 However, few examples of his portraits painted in Pilsen have survived; there are a total of ten of these paintings in the collection of the Museum of West Bohemia.19 Public interest in portrait painting was clearly much less than the young artist had antici­ pated. One of the reasons was competition from portrait photography, which was cheaper and was gaining prominence in Pilsen and West Bohemia. As the newspaper Pilsner Bote commented: ‘Oh thou poor art of painting! How long it has been that you started dying slowly as a slighted, scorned foster-child, allowed only the scarce refreshment of a portrait painting. Photography has become the death of you.’20 The situation of painters became even worse after the Vienna stock market crash of 1873, which had a considerable influence on the arts and on painting commissions. The decline in the painting market was the fatal blow to Lindauer’s plan to operate a portrait painting studio in Pilsen.\n\n29\n\nGottfried Lindauer, Portrait of Kristián Lexa, 1866, oil on canvas, 680 x 520 mm; Portrait of Markéta Lexová, 1866, oil on canvas, 680 x 520 mm.

The artist has left few clues about why he decided to go to New Zealand in 1874. He probably had multiple motives. One reason may have been the example of his compatriots from the town of Stod, near Pilsen, who left for New Zealand in waves starting from 1863. They settled north of Auckland along the Pūhoi River, founding the village of the same name.21 Lindauer’s 1876 portrait of Mrs Rosalie Schischka, a native from Stod and one of the inhabitants of Pūhoi, attests to his relationship with the villagers.\n\n30\n\nAnother reason may have been the 1873 Vienna World Exposition, where Lindauer may have seen, among other New Zealand exhibits, examples of Māori cultural material.22 His other reasons may have been romantic. Possibly what attracted him to New Zealand was the opportu­ nity to make a new beginning in a distant land on the other side of the globe — a land that was considered one of the last remaining pieces of paradise in the world. A more pragmatic reason may have been that in the island country there were few professionally trained artists, offering a higher chance of accumulating the large group of clients that he lacked in Pilsen. New Zealand through the eyes of a Czech artist Gottfried Lindauer lived in his second homeland from the age of thirty-five to his death in 1926, during which time he visited Europe three times. The artist kept in touch with his old friends back in Bohemia, writing regularly with descriptions of the beauty and sights of his new homeland. Nevertheless, it appears that in the early years he did have doubts about staying in New Zealand. After the death of Emelia, his first wife, in 1880 it seems that he sold all his property and was preparing to return to Europe when Walter Buller, one of his patrons, dissuaded him from leaving.23 He obviously became attached to New Zealand: just before sailing back from Europe in 1902 — on this second visit the Lindauers took their two sons so Hector could study the violin in Leipzig — Lindauer wrote to Josefa Náprstková from the port\n\nA landscape photograph taken following the instructions of Gottfried Lindauer, described by him as (translated from Czech): ‘A forest fern tree by Māori called Ponga’, National Museum — Náprstek Museum of Asian, African and American Cultures, Prague, inv. no.

Our hearts would ache greatly for New Zealand, our homeland, free and beautiful.’24 Lindauer was never a landscapist; only the backgrounds of some of his portraits contain views into schematised, non-descript romantic landscapes. However, certain aspects of the New Zealand landscape caught his attention and he managed to photograph them. When he sent his brother Hynek a photograph of a nīkau palm and tree ferns, he delivered a rather pithy description: A nikau palm tree, growing to be up to 40 feet tall. It is a magnificent tree; you can see tree ferns in the background. This is the scene that I found in the forest myself and had it photographed from a number of angles; it cost me a couple of pounds. Hynek, if you could see this Landschaft [a landscape, also in a painting] in nature, you would shit your pants because of the beauty of it. — I spent several days with the photographer in the forest myself and I did my bit by carrying the camera etc., but it wasn’t that romantic.25\n\nHe had a photograph of himself taken in a friend’s garden in front of a giant prickly pear tree that had grown to an enormous height in a mere eight years. The painter was also fascinated by the New Zealand fauna: the kiwi (supposedly, he looked after one himself), the extinct giant moa (which he commemorated in photographs taken in the Canterbury Museum), and the\n\n32\n\nGottfried Lindauer sitting under a prickly pear tree, about 1880.

He took two tuatara to Prague in his visit in 1901–02; they were put on display at the house of Václav Frič.26 However, Lindauer’s predominant concern in New Zealand is quite apparent from a set of annotated photographs that he sent to his brother Hynek around 1890; it is now part of the collection of the Náprstek Museum in Prague.27 The vast majority are of New Zealand’s indigenous people with captions such as: ‘Young Maori ladies’, ‘Maori girl with a harp’, ‘Maori Mrs. Pare Whakaaro Rangi, meaning “heavenly thought” ’, ‘Maori soldier holding a wahaika, meaning a curved, wooden spade’, ‘Maori man wearing the national costume to puni from dog skin’, ‘Hongi — the Maori greeting of rubbing each other’s noses’. The series also includes photographs of Māori carvings, buildings and other artefacts. The captions show a great emphasis on the garments, weapons, amulets, jewellery and other items that play important roles in Lindauer’s portraits of Māori people. Citing one example: ‘Maori woman wearing feathers of the huia bird of New Zealand; the pendant on her neck is a hei-tiki [representing] gods, it is made from greenstone (Nephrite Australis). The hei-tiki are passed down from the father to the first-born child and are deemed to be of great, miraculous value to the Maori.’28 An element of Māori culture that Europeans might have viewed as sensational, or barbaric, was the Māori face tattoo. Tattoos, tā moko, might cover other body parts as well: ‘Chief Mohi te Rongomau wears a tattoo called “rape” on his buttocks. Only the chieftain and his wife can wear the rape tattoo,’ he wrote. Lindauer sent two drawings of face, buttock and thigh tattoos with his comments to Bohemia.29 The design of the tā moko worn by Chief Tāraia Ngākuti Te Tumuhuia is annotated with the Māori names of every detail (each having a symbolic meaning), and\n\n33\n\nGottfried Lindauer, Facial Tattoo of Chief Taraia Ngakuti, n.d., ink drawing, National Museum — Náprstek Museum of Asian, African and American Cultures, Prague, inv. no.

I do believe that.’ The painter highlights that each line has its place and name: ‘The Maori are extremely sensitive on the regularity of moko: they are quick to point errors when I am painting them. That is why I studied moko in depth. Yes, I do not make mistakes any more and they are always wondering that the Pakeha (meaning “a European”) can paint moko correctly.’ Lindauer knew that the tattoo process commences at ages eighteen to twenty and takes several years to complete, writing: ‘History knows of only one Maori man who had a full-face tattoo done in a single session; yet by the time the last lines were finished, he had died under the brush, or the bone chisel held by the tohunga’s hand.’ The result is unique: ‘There are no two Maori who have exactly the same tattoo.’ The decoration is rendered by a Māori priest, a tohunga, such as Lindauer depicted in his painting The Tohungata-moko at Work. While the Tohunga is cutting the poor man’s skin with a rather dull bone blade, all his friends are sitting around and singing songs as to encourage him and praise how beautiful it will look. The face swells and hurts, getting an appalling look; however, the cuts heal in 7–10 days and the wearer is parading it around as proud as a peacock. Young girls admire the attractive look: the more mutilated the face, the prouder the wearer.\n\nThe tā moko gains its blue–black colouring once massaged with ink from hīnau bark and ‘the Maori often have the tattoo done again so the moko gets a darker hue’. Young Māori ladies supposedly do not favour tā moko for themselves; ‘only girls have the decoration made on their lips’. The artist’s comments on tā moko would have surprised and shocked a European reader, but also indicate his knowledge of the symbolic significance of the tattoo practice. Lindauer showed great interest in Māori culture: he was interested in life and customs, learned several words of the Māori language and included a small basic dictionary in his letters to Bohemia.30 In New Zealand he had found a new purpose in life: to capture, in as much detail as he could, the world of the Māori and to act as an intermediary in informing his native country about their culture. He felt he was an artist–ethnographer who, instead of searching for new ways in art, preferred to learn and capture the essence of a people from a different land and culture. Interestingly, there were no artists, except for Hynek, in the group of people in Europe who Lindauer kept in touch with through letters and personal contact. Most were people interested in the exploration of lands they considered exotic, such as Vojtěch and Josefa Náprstek, the founders of a worldwide ethnographic museum, Václav Frič, a trader in natural resources and promoter of photography, and Josef Kořenský. The explorer Kořenský met Lindauer in Auckland in 1900, and he took a considerable liking to the painter, who he called ‘Our countryman Down Under’. Kořenský admired Lindauer for creating his portraits of Māori, and he dedicated a number of texts in magazines and books to the artist: Say Lindauer’s name and every Maori chieftain nods their head to indicate they know the artist who painted their portrait. Visit the house of any important public figure at their funeral, and what do you see above the body on display? You see a canvas painting with a spitting image of the chieftain, decorated with ribbons and reminding the guests of the good face of the deceased. And who did the painting, you might ask? Looking at the corner of the painting, you will see the artist’s signature: Bohuslav [sic] Lindauer.31\n\n35\n\nVojtěch Náprstek and Josefa Náprstková photographed in 1875 by Jindřich Eckert (left) and Josef Kořenský, c. 1902 (right).

In his letters, Lindauer stated how he wished to acquire a Māori relief sculpture for the Náprstek collection; however, the rarity of such items meant that only wealthy collectors could afford them. The letters and postcards Lindauer sent to his Czech friends make clear that he lived only for his family and for work. The letters do not mention living in Woodville or the politics of New Zealand. Lindauer certainly was interested in politics when he was young and spoke critically of the situation in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Although this topic resonates in his autobio­graphy, in his later life he was concerned, nearly exclusively, with his family, nature and the life of Māori. The lack of interest in politics may have been because of his happiness at being in a ‘free and beautiful’ country, as he wrote in the 1902 letter to Josefa Náprstková.33 Comparison of Lindauer’s European and New Zealand work Gottfried Lindauer’s work prior to his departure for New Zealand falls into two different categories in terms of theme and form: religious painting in the tradition of the Hemerlein school and portrait painting. Lindauer did little religious painting in his new environment, only completing several minor works: with very few exceptions, he focused on portrait painting and large-size figurative scenes depicting the life of Māori. However, surprisingly, parallels with his early religious painting can be observed in his portrait painting in his use of the hieratic principle of representation. The influence of Lindauer’s teachers in Vienna is evident in his techniques and his painting style. Josef Führich was a special influence on Lindauer’s harmonic compositions and the narrative style of painting. Nevertheless, Carl Hemerlein was more influential on his style. Hemerlein\n\n36\n\nhad managed to move beyond the Nazarenistic tradition of linearism that had dominated religious painting, probably through his time in Paris studying with Paul Delaroche, the master of illusionist historical painting. Lindauer had absorbed the illusionism, sophisticated lighting effects and plastic modelling for which Hemerlein’s painting was known. However, neither of these two painters had an immediate influence on Lindauer’s principal genre, the portrait; indeed, neither of them focused on portraits. Young Lindauer had found his role models in the portrait painters of the preceding era of Biedermeier, notably in the works of Friedrich Amerling from Vienna and, more prominently, in the work of Antonín Machek, a Prague painter who also trained in Vienna. Features of the Biedermeier portrait style that can be identified in Lindauer’s work are the smooth, detailed rendering of the sitter and the nuanced representation of material and garments. Biedermeier artists strove to achieve a balance between realism and idealisation: the goal was not to deliver a psychological study or exploit emotion, but to prepare a presentable portrait that if possible conferred authority or prestige on the sitter. A recurring trait is the use of a standard focal distance from the sitter, whose image is usually rendered in three-quarter profile or full face, a bust or a half-length figure. There are two types of background used: a full-area background with a halo-like illumination of the sitter’s head and a Renaissance model with a vista of the landscape. There is an important difference between the Biedermeier-style portraits and Lindauer’s European ones: Lindauer did not include items that signified status in his European painting. By contrast, in his Māori portraits, the social position of the subject is symbolised by amulets, jewellery, weapons and similar items. Lindauer collected his own set of studio props, which appear repeatedly in his paintings. He received many of them from Māori as a reward for his portraits. Apart from these details, there is little difference between his portraits from Europe and New Zealand, especially in regard to those of people of European descent. For example, a comparison of the portraits of Markéta Lexová from Pilsen with Rosalie Schischka from Pūhoi does not suggest any major differences in concept and style, apart from the greater mastery achieved by the older painter. For many of the portraits he painted in his second home country, Lindauer projected photographic images of his subjects onto the canvas.34 The method was in use in Europe at the time, as supported by evidence from Munich, Vienna and Prague. Lindauer presumably learned photography while he was living in Pilsen, where one of his peers and near neighbours was Josef Böttinger, the city’s most important photographer of the second half of the nineteenth century.35 It is quite certain that the two artists knew each other and that it was Böttinger who introduced Lindauer to rudimentary photography. Accounts from Josef Kořenský offer indirect evidence of Lindauer being a photographer when he arrived in New Zealand: Kořenský writes that the artist made his living in the early New Zealand years by portrait photography and that he later returned to painting.36 He certainly included photography in his studio practice in New Zealand, although there is no evidence that he used it in the preparation of his European portraits. Lindauer’s younger brother was also using photography in his painting, maybe consulting with him. A newspaper report from 1882 states that Hynek Lindauer had developed a specific portrait technique: he was praised ‘especially for portraits rendered fittingly in chalk by a special method after photographs were taken’.37 In conclusion, we can trace the development of Lindauer’s painting style through to the changed context later in his life. In the mid-1860s Lindauer learned and developed an individual style for portrait painting, which served his purpose during the later decades. His European\n\n37\n\ntraining gave him the experience and techniques necessary to achieve a mastery in portrait painting in New Zealand, especially in the domain of illusionary effects and technical finesse. Rather than developing his style further in New Zealand, Lindauer focused on visualising and spreading knowledge of the people and customs of his new land. His artistic skills were fully adequate for this purpose and received many accolades from his patrons and customers. Unlike the portraits, Lindauer’s large scene paintings do not show any noticeable continuity with his early European work, except perhaps for the works in the pilgrimage chapel of Sts Cyril and Methodius in Valašské Klobouky, where the decoration included large figural compositions. However, Lindauer’s genre paintings of the life of Māori have a different purpose, displaying an interest in ethnographic documentary, albeit taking artistic licence and revealing a tendency to romanticise. These scenes of Māori life were a long distance and time away from Lindauer’s early work on the opposite side of the globe. He had developed his own style of genre composition. In Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century, there was an increasing tendency for the fine arts to play an important role in developing the cultural identities of nations; this held especially true in countries going through the complicated process of emancipation from national oppression. Lindauer was no stranger to that attitude, as is seen in his early self-portrait and in the portrait of Jan Svidenský; both paintings have been mentioned in this context above. Often the initial stimuli for the establishment of an independent cultural identity were based around literature and historiography — for example, considerable recognition was given to the Walhalla, a pantheon of greats of the German nation, installed in the vicinity of Regensburg in Bavaria in 1842.38 In collaboration with the Munich sculptor Ludwig Schwanthaler, the Bohemian art patron Antonín Veith followed the Walhalla model when he established a sculpture gallery of the leading people in Czech history in Tupadly near his house in Liběchov. A similar conjunction of ideas inspired the preparation of a pantheon of paintings of Māori people, a result of collaboration between Gottfried Lindauer and the patron Henry Partridge. They certainly could not have predicted the importance their activities would hold for Māori in New Zealand and around the globe to this day.\n\n38\n\nA Perspective from New Zealand: Lindauer’s Painting in the Settler Colonial World Leonard Bell\n\nI would appeal to the artists of New Zealand to not allow the scenery entrancing as it is to consolidate the main subjects of study. Seek inspiration from the ancient indwellers — to the picture of whose stirring history and myth-shadowed life, the scenery is after all no more than a frame. — Johannes Andersen, Maori Life in Ao-tea (1907)\n\nD\n\nuring several formative years Lindauer spent in Vienna, the capital of the Austro-\n\nHungarian empire,1 it is not known whether he ever saw A Maori Village in New\n\nZealand, in the Imperial Natural History Museum there, by the prominent and\n\nwidely travelled Viennese artist Alois Schönn, otherwise best known for his\n\nOrientalist pictures and his genre scenes of gypsies and Jews in eastern Europe.2 From 1876 to\n\n1884 Ferdinand von Hochstetter was director of the museum, which built up a large collection of Māori art and artefacts during the nineteenth century. Hochstetter had visited New Zealand during the state-sponsored Austrian voyage of scientific exploration on SMS Novara (1857–59), and he also assisted the commissioners of the New Zealand Court at the great Vienna World Exposition in 1873, superintending the ‘collection of specimens in natural history’.3 Lindauer visited the exposition and the Māori artefacts he saw there, as well as accounts of the good prospects for immigrants in New Zealand, may well have encouraged him to migrate to the other side of the world.4 Lindauer began his long antipodean career in Nelson in 1874, first, briefly, as a commercial photographer, then as a portraitist. His name soon appears in newspapers — for instance, in a story about his portraits of Nelson residents in early 1875;5 his subjects there included Father Garin, the mayor Mr Levien and children. During the 1870s and 1880s Lindauer travelled extensively round New Zealand. The ‘Austrian’, as he was labelled, ran an itinerant studio, setting up shop in towns, before finally making his permanent home with his young family in Woodville, north Wairarapa, in 1889. While he portrayed many Europeans, it was his paintings of Māori that made his public reputation. His output was prolific. For instance, according to his notebook, he painted or sold forty-six portraits in Wellington in 1877, and twenty-two in Cambridge and fifteen in Palmerston North in 1883.6 He made a good income. Those Wellington portraits fetched a total of £1,034, his 1885 sales of 115 portraits earned him £2,729, while his larger portraits sold for at least £50 each.7 By 1882 Lindauer had established an estimable reputation as New Zealand’s pre-eminent portraitist.\n\n39\n\nMāori–Pākehā intersections Lindauer migrated to an unsettled country. Although institutions of colonial government and administration were well established by the 1870s, New Zealand had become a colony of Great Britain only with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi between the British Crown and chiefs of many Māori tribes in 1840. Systematic organised European settlement and land acquisition began at that time. Conflict between colonists and various powerful tribes soon followed. From the mid-1840s to the 1870s there were periods of warfare, mainly in the more populated North Island, between the colonial government militia, supported by British Army troops and some kūpapa or ‘friendly’ Māori. By the mid-1880s resisting Māori were militarily subjugated and had lost much land through confiscation. By the early 1890s the Māori population had declined steeply, mainly from disease, while the European population increased rapidly, especially from the 1870s with large-scale immigration, mostly from Great Britain. In 1900 there were about a million Europeans and 50,000 Māori living in New Zealand.8 Māori, now a minority in their own country, continued to suffer extensive land loss, through legitimate sales, indebtedness, the machinations of the Native Land Court and further confiscations. Yet they did not accept colonial domination passively. Kīngitanga, or the King Movement, founded in 1857, aimed to unite the tribes. It challenged land alienation and promoted Māori sovereignty over their remaining territories. A few Europeans also protested injustices to Māori. Australian historian George Rusden’s Aureretanga: Groans of the Maoris\n\nAllen Hutchinson, Portrait of Gottfried Lindauer, 1902, bronze, 355 mm, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, gift of Miss Isa Outhwaite\n\n40\n\n(1888), for instance, lambasted the Crown and colonists for their ill treatment of Māori and failure to abide by the Treaty of Waitangi’s terms.9 And Charles Hardy, a correspondent from Mount Albert, wrote to the New Zealand Herald in 1905: ‘Respecting the treatment of the Maori in the past, at the present time, and with regard to the proposals of the Government concerning him for the future, I ask, could treaty rights be more contemptuously scorned, or a civilized Government more barbarous in its enactments?’10 The Young Maori Party, an affiliation of professionals, the key figures of which were James Carroll, Āpirana Ngata, Māui Pōmare and Peter Buck (Te Rangi Hīroa), emerged in the early twentieth century and constituted another attempt to strengthen the position of Māori in settler colonial society. There is a still-common tendency to render Māori–Pākehā relationships in the colonial period in terms of simple oppositions, when in fact their interactions were often much more complicated and full of inconsistencies. While the negative consequences for Māori of colonial settlement, such as land loss, war and disease, should not be underestimated, there were positive productive encounters between Māori and Pākehā. Lindauer’s work provides striking instances of such encounters. For example, it was reported in 1882 that, Much excitement was caused on Sunday [in Cambridge] by the exhibition in the shop window of Mr Hughes, the chemist, of a life-like portrait in oils of the Honourable Wi Tako [Ngātata] by Lindauer. The natives assembled in front of the shop to offer their greeting and sing a waiata, composed years ago in honour of this chief . . . The portrait of Wi Tako is so realistic that . . . old Hakariwihi, of the Ngatihaua, could not resist the temptation to rub noses with the picture, giving expression at the same time to the usual mihi.11\n\nThe making of art by Europeans in New Zealand was not solely determined by the ideological imperatives of colonialism. Lindauer’s Māori paintings need to be located within a mesh of socio-political complexities that made up the daily lives of New Zealanders. Seeing his paintings simply in terms of the standard art historical narratives is an oversimplification. Patronage and coexistence After his shift north to Auckland in late 1875, Lindauer’s career took off. In a city, and country, with a very small population, rudimentary fine arts institutions and a virtually non-existent art market, Lindauer advertised for portrait commissions in local newspapers, presented his work in shop windows and sold his pictures via art unions (raffles with paintings as prizes). He was the ‘Portrait Painter (in Oil), From the Academy of Artistes de Vienna’, an Auckland newspaper announced.12 Presumably the French touch was intended to signal sophistication in the rough harbour city. Lindauer met British-born Henry Partridge, a former sailor and adventurer in east Asia, whose Auckland tobacco business was reputedly the largest in New Zealand.13 Partridge com­ missioned upwards of eighty paintings from Lindauer over the next thirty or so years. Besides portraits of eminent and newsworthy Māori, Lindauer produced large-scale depictions of traditional Māori practices and pictures of everyday life.14 Partridge aimed to commemorate ‘old-time’ Māori and honour their representatives (inclu­ ding their Members of Parliament) at a time when it was widely believed that Māori were dying out. Initially holding his private collection at his home, Partridge loaned twenty-four Lindauer portraits to the 1898–99 Auckland Industrial & Mining Exhibition for public display in the\n\n41\n\nChoral Hall, also the venue for the annual Auckland Society of Arts shows.15 Then from 1901 to 1912 forty portraits and a painting of traditional tattooing were placed in a gallery, open to the public, above Partridge’s tobacconist’s shop in Auckland’s main thoroughfare, Queen Street. Māori visitors were most welcome.16 In 1901 James Cowan (1870–1943), a popular writer on New Zealand history, compiled a descriptive catalogue of Partridge’s Lindauer collection,17 which he revised, updated and republished with reproductions in 1930.18 Indeed Cowan, as much as Lindauer and Partridge, played a major role in bringing the Partridge Collection into wide public visibility and shaping how the general public saw and understood the paintings. He was also the first Pākehā writer for whom Māori achievements and activities were as essential for colonial history writing as those of settlers. That orientation is particularly noteworthy, in that Partridge’s collection was described as ‘practically a pictorial history of the colony since its earliest days’.19 Cowan stressed the speed of New Zealand’s transformation as a colony and argued that the New Zealand Wars were central to those changes.20 Past and present intersected in complex ways. Cowan, whose second wife Eileen Stowell was the daughter of Henry Matthew Stowell, a Ngāpuhi interpreter and teacher of Māori, held that Pākehā had a responsibility to Māori, because of the wars and the dispossession that followed.21 The conflicted past should not be forgotten. Productive S.P. Andrew Ltd, James Cowan, 1929, black-and-white film negative, Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, 1/1–018597\n\ninteractions between Māori and Pākehā would be the making of New Zealand, Cowan believed, and he was particularly interested in those who crossed boundaries between the two. One such person was Lindauer. The European empire that Lindauer came from was an intricately intertwined and multi-ethnic world, in\n\nwhich relationships between peoples from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds could be both conflicted and creatively stimulating. His experience of the adaptative benefits of such a milieu predisposed him to moving between Māori and Pākehā worlds. Although he exhibited a few of his Māori portraits in art society exhibitions and the New Zealand Art Students’ Association,22 in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most Europeans regarded these paintings primarily as ethnological and historical documents, rather than as ‘fine art’ objects. They saw them as providing an inventory of Māori public figures, their physiognomy, moko, dress, artefacts and ornament. Partridge’s daughter Eileen Clayton claimed that Partridge did not consider his pictures an ‘art collection’.23 And the pictures New Zealand-born Walter Buller, Lindauer’s second most important Pākehā patron, commissioned were exhibited as part of Buller’s ethnological collection, representing ‘typical Maoris . . . in characteristic native costume’.24 Besides these functions, Lindauer’s paintings, whether intentionally or not, also visualise European attitudes to Māori in the colonial period. For many settler colonials, the paintings represented ‘old-time’ Māori, who were destined to vanish into the dustbin of history. The notion of supposedly dying Māori society and culture had strong currency in the later nineteenth century. Yet, in fact, from the 1890s the Māori population was increasing and many Māori, individually and collectively, were reasserting their distinct cultural identity and difference from Europeans.25\n\n42\n\nSix Ngāti Maniapoto survivors of the Ōrākau battle photographed in 1914. James Cowan, Maori Survivors of War, black-and-white negative, Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, 1/1–017975–G\n\nNevertheless, Lindauer’s Māori pictures continued to be seen as records of what was passing. For some Pākehā the paintings may have functioned as trophies of conquest and emblems of control, with ‘old-time’ Māori ‘captured’ on canvas. And the Partridge Collection became part of a ‘pictorial colonisation’, which occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, by which motifs, narratives and elements from Māori history, mythology and visual arts were adopted or appropriated by Pākehā artists and designers in order to construct an indigenous–settler visual culture that differed from those of ‘Old World’ societies from which they originated.26 Such a supposedly distinctive visual culture was also intended to contribute to the formation of a new national identity, ‘New Zealander’, at a time when the country made the transition from a colony of Great Britain to an independent dominion (in 1907) within the British empire. Until recently the Partridge Collection has been the prime focus of institutional and art historical attention, with Buller’s collection, now in the Whanganui Regional Museum, a secondary focus. That Lindauer painted many pictures for Māori clients from the mid-1870s was largely overlooked (he often made replicas for European patrons, notably Partridge and Buller27). Initially nine of Lindauer’s paintings exhibited in a Wellington shop window in 1877 generated business from Māori; for instance, the portrait Mrs Ngahui Te Rangitakaiwaho of Wairarapa (Plate 56) which was commissioned in 1880. Māori customers paid good prices for portraits — for instance, £40 for Wahanui Reihana Te Huatare (Ngāti Maniapoto). Reportedly, attendance at the Native Land Court in the 1880s was ‘perceptibly thinner’ when Lindauer’s travelling studio, ‘literally throng[ing] with Maori visitors’, was in town.28 His paintings had, and have, symbolic and metaphysical values for many Māori, as well as generating intensities of emotion, that contrast with the historical, ethnological, aesthetic and commercial roles they have fulfilled in predominantly European contexts.29 On one hand, a portrait could commemorate the presence, mana and spirit of the subject. On the other, the portrayed person could be transformed into an exotic spectacle in which the figure was an actor. Late colonial art in New Zealand In 1851 Governor George Grey urged artists and poets in New Zealand to engage with Māori tradition and culture ‘. . . to recover some traits of their terrible lineaments . . . of their softer outlines . . . that either a stern grandeur, or the romantic glow of a primitive state of existence\n\n43\n\nmight be imparted to some works of art’.30 Only later in the nineteenth century were such views put into practice with any frequency or impact on art production. Professionally trained artists were rare in New Zealand: Lindauer was one of just a handful of full-time artists. There were no art schools before 1878 or galleries until the mid-1880s, the audience for the fine arts was limited and members of art societies were mostly amateur. Nevertheless there were some earlier professional artists, such as George French Angas, William Strutt, J.A. Gilfillan and Nicholas Chevalier, who painted Māori subjects before Lindauer’s arrival. They, however, were visitors or temporary residents, whose works were exhibited in Australia or Britain, not in New Zealand.31 There were also a few professionally trained portraitists who settled in New Zealand earlier than Lindauer — for instance, William Beetham in Wellington and environs and John Irvine in Dunedin. But there were no specialists in Māori portraiture until Lindauer.32 That changed with the emergence of art societies in the 1870s and 1880s in the main centres and the immigration of more professional artists. Depictions of Māori became one of the favoured subjects in the 1890s and early twentieth century. A brief consideration of contemporaneous artists’ representations of Māori subjects and Lindauer’s relation to theirs will help elucidate his position in the colonial art world, as well as the meanings and values his pictures generated in New Zealand society. Even if Lindauer did not participate much in the art society exhibitions, his Māori work was well known, admired and shown elsewhere, such as at the international exhibition in Wellington in 1885 and the 1898 Auckland Exhibition. As early as 1883 the social importance of Lindauer’s paintings was recognised. A newspaper asserted that his portrayals of Māori should become a national collection: ‘the Government ought, in the interests of the Colony, take advantage of this opportunity of securing so valuable a collection of historical paintings’.33 By 1912, James Parr, Auckland’s mayor, when suggesting that Partridge loan his collection to the Auckland Art\n\nKennett Watkins, The Phantom Canoe: A Legend of Lake Tarawera, 1888, oil on canvas, 1016 x 1695 mm, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, gift of H.E.

[It] is unrivalled in the world’, since it included ‘many of the celebrated history makers of the Maori race’, besides ‘the technical work [being] of the highest class’.34 Lindauer’s Māori subject paintings were part of an institutionalisation of ‘things’ Māori. When Partridge’s Lindauer gallery opened in 1901, it also included a set of six Māori heads by Allen Hutchinson, a visiting English professional sculptor, who otherwise specialised in nonEuropean ethnic ‘types’ (for example, Hawaiian and Chinese).35 The Auckland Society of Arts exhibited the Hutchinson works in 1901. Kennett Watkins (1847–1933), born in India and trained in France, Italy and Switzerland, migrated to New Zealand in 1873. He played a pioneering role in the professionalisation of art in Auckland, as a teacher, organiser of societies and painter. He advocated that, ‘to observe what remains of their [Māori] ancient customs and manners . . . herein lies our duty and the true direction of our study’.36 Watkins was a leading painter of Māori genre and historical subjects — for example, The Haunt of the Moa: A Scene in a Puriri Forest (1885), The Phantom Canoe: A Legend of Lake Tarawera (1888), painted for Partridge, The Legend of the Voyage to New Zealand (1912) and The Explosion of the Boyd (1890).37 The Boyd painting was a collaborative effort with Louis John Steele (1842–1918), an accomplished professional, who migrated to Auckland in 1886. Steele quickly became the pre-eminent painter of Māori subjects: portraits, genre scenes and historical pieces. According to the New Zealand Graphic in 1891, ‘It is with such a brush [Steele’s] that the incidents of our peculiar life and history should be recorded.’ 38 His most celebrated, and sometimes controversial, works included A Maori Legend from Te Rou (1888), Spoils to the Victor and Defiance (1908), The Launching of a Maori Canoe (1916) and, with Charles Goldie, The Arrival\n\n45\n\nof the Maoris in New Zealand (1898).39 New Zealand-born, Paris-trained Goldie took over Steele’s mantle from the early twentieth century, with his portraits-cum-narrative pictures of Māori. Goldie has been extensively exhibited, researched and written about, Watkins and Steele much less so.40 Others painted Māori subjects too — for instance, the portraitists Joseph Gaut, Kate Sperrey and Helen Stuart in the 1880s, then rugby star Thomas Ryan (whose wife was Māori) and Walter Wright, Wilhelm Dittmer, Ellen Von Meyern and Clas Friström in the new century.41 In Dunedin around the turn of the twentieth century Frances Hodgkins made high-quality watercolours of Māori women and children, while James MacDonald pictured and sculpted an array of Māori topics. John Moultray produced supposed scenes from the New Zealand Wars,42 building on the precedent of the New Zealand battle pictures painted by the Prussian soldier–artist Gustavus von Tempsky from the 1860s, several of which were in public collections.43 Overall these artists make up a diverse group, both in how they represented their subjects and in the formal and technical qualities of their work. What united their pictures was the cultural significance attributed to works that were regarded as distinctive to New Zealand. In terms of subject they were ‘break[ing] away from old world fetters’, as writer and librarian Johannes Andersen urged artists and writers to do.44 A reviewer’s comment in 1910 was typical: ‘Maori life continues to draw a widening circle of adherents . . . [It] is destined probably to be both the salvation and realisation of our national art.’ 45 That correlated with an emerging sense of a Pākehā national identity. Back in 1883 Watkins had called for a New Zealand ‘nationality in the art sense’.46 Manifestations of this artistic nationalism include Partridge’s public gallery, the Auckland Art Gallery’s deliberate early\n\nThomas Ryan, Interior of a Whare, c. 1891, watercolour on paper, 225 x 285 mm, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, purchased 2004\n\n46\n\nFrances Hodgkins, Head of a Maori Girl, 1900, watercolour, 490 x 338 mm, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki\n\ntwentieth-century practice of creating a collection of Māori-related art works, and the German artist Wilhelm Dittmer’s stylistically bravura illustrated book Te Tohunga: The Ancient Legends and Traditions of the Maoris, underwritten by the New Zealand government and published in London in 1907, the year the country became an independent dominion.47 During his time in New Zealand, from 1898 to 1905, Dittmer had had a studio in the Colonial Museum, the director of which was his close friend Augustus Hamilton. Hamilton wrote The Art Workmanship of the Maori Race in New Zealand (1896–1901).48 Despite their commonalities, Lindauer’s work and career is marked by a striking point of dif­f erence from these other artists. Virtually all of them painted exclusively for a European audi­ence and market. Only Lindauer, and Gaut and Dittmer to a much lesser extent, also worked for Māori clients. By the early twentieth century, an intense and widespread interest had developed among Pākehā in all aspects of Māori life and history. In 1908 the Auckland Star reported, The great interest felt in the Maori race was manifested by a large audience that assembled last evening in the Leys Institute [Auckland] to listen to the most interesting lecture delivered by Dr. Te Rangi Hiroa, M.B. Ch. B (Dr. Buck of the Health Department) on ‘The Evolution of the Maori’ . . . [and] also the result of the introduction of Western civilization and the aims of the Young Maori Party for the future of their race.49\n\n47\n\nLeft: Page from Wilhelm Dittmer, Te Tohunga: The Ancient Legends and Traditions of the Maoris, London: George Routledge & Sons, 1907 Right: Title page of Augustus Hamilton’s book The Art Workmanship of the Maori Race in New Zealand, Dunedin: printed and published for the Board of Governors by Fergusson & Mitchell, 1896–1901\n\nThat interest was apparent in the vast quantity of photographs of Māori (for example, by Lindauer’s friend Samuel Carnell in Napier, the American Photographic Company in Auckland, and Foy Brothers in Thames, from whose images Lindauer borrowed), the collection of Māori material culture by the new museums, the activities of the Polynesian Society, including their Journal of the Polynesian Society, and the publications of ethnologists, both trained and amateur. Theories and speculations, often fanciful, about Māori origins abounded. Watkins, for instance, informed Peter Buck that he believed that ‘the Maori obtained the double spiral of his art from the Egyptians’.50 There were music and fiction too — for example, Hinemoa: An Epic of New Zealand. For Soli, Chorus and Orchestra by Goldie’s friend, the prominent composer Alfred Hill (with lyrics by Arthur Henry Adams), was performed to acclaim at the Wellington Industrial Festival in 1896. Novels included William Satchell’s well-known The Greenstone Door (1914) and the little-known work by Henry Vogel (son of sometime prime minister Julius Vogel) called A Maori Maid (1898), whose heroine is a ‘half-caste’ spanning Māori and European worlds. This widespread preoccupation with Māori history, mythology, customs and life correlates with a will among European settlers and their descendants to become indigenous too, thereby perhaps legitimising, whether consciously or not, their presence here. The wider world Dittmer pitched Te Tohunga at an international audience. Back in 1879 Lindauer first considered sending his Māori portraits to Great Britain,51 and after just twelve years in the remote colony, his New Zealand-made paintings were celebrated on a metropolitan world stage, London’s 1886\n\n48\n\nColonial and Indian Exhibition. In this vast celebration of the power and products of the British empire, twelve pictures from Buller’s collection were displayed in the Maori Court; a large number of other artists’ paintings and photographs of New Zealand subjects were also shown at the Albert Hall. Lindauer’s paintings were declared ‘genuine works of art’:52 ‘[There is] much life and vigour in the native portraits . . . the paintings of the features, the tattoo marks, and the perfect expression of the eyes, are most delicately and effectively portrayed.’ 53 Although this was not the first time paintings devoted to New Zealand’s landscape and indigenous people had been exhibited in London — Angas’s 1846 show at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, and Chevalier’s at the South Kensington Museum in 1871 were the precedents — it exemplifies the primary role that such art had in making New Zealand known in the Euro–American world.54 In 1904 the New Zealand government borrowed nine of Partridge’s Lindauers to help promote the country at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis, Missouri. One of his approximately thirty versions of Heeni Hirini and Child won the Palace of Fine Art Grand Prize for Painting, even though it was shown in the New Zealand Pavilion, not the art gallery. Lindauer’s paintings were increasingly sought after in Europe and America.55 Partridge was asked ‘to take his unique collection to the “Old World”, where its ethnological value is known to scientific men’.56 There were plans to exhibit Lindauer’s work in London, Paris and New York57 and, although they did not eventuate, the interest in his paintings was part of the collecting of Māori art by Euro– American museums that occurred during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nGottfried Lindauer, Hinemoa, 1907, oil on canvas, 1080 x 1335 mm, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, bequest of Mrs M.A. Partridge, 1931\n\n49\n\nPartridge’s collection, of course, remained in New Zealand. With its loan in 1912, and then its gifting in 1915, it became a centrepiece of the Auckland Art Gallery, sought out by local Europeans, overseas tourists and Māori alike. Since many of its subjects were people of high socio-political standing — Māori who had been involved in major events and negotiations with the British and colonial governments, European settlers and missionaries — it offered a kind of national portrait gallery, a parallel to George Frederick Watts’s mid-nineteenth-century portraits of ‘great [British] men’ for his ‘Hall of F"
