In many cases, social concerns have highlighted the significant need for a more specialised and holistic approach and pre work programmes are required to assist with addressing the concerns.\n\n5.1.4 Through the Youth Futures Trust, a fund is now available for the purpose of supporting, and removing barriers for those young people that we are engaged with. This can include drivers licensing, transport/petrol, vocational training, work attire, tools and equipment etc. As well as boosting their confidence, this makes them more attractive to potential employers.\n\n5.1.5 Rangatahi ma kei eke\n\n5.1.6 The Rangatahi ma kei eke project which is a community based work project under the Matariki (REDS) Strategy (Project 1000) which aims to give up to 25 young people a pathway to employment is progressing well.\n\n5.1.7 This is a joint project with the Ministry of Social Development, Hastings District Council, EIT, HBDHB and TPK.\n\n5.1.8 The project aims to actively include young people who experience health conditions or a disability (but not limited to), in project based work where they can develop employment skills, experience and on the job training.

That purpose is to meet the current and future needs of communities for good quality local infrastructure, local public services, and performance of regulatory functions in a way that is most cost–effective for households and businesses.

They are:\n\n· Nanny Kona\n\n· Len Harlen\n\n· Kingsley\n\n2.7 Due to the number of playgrounds within the 500m walking distance, building another new play space in the cul-de-sac would only benefit a few.\n\n2.8 The Long Term Plan 2015–2025 (LTP) identifies a Level of Service Performance Target that by 2022, 62% of urban properties will be within 500m of a playground; and 94% of urban properties will be within 500m of a park. The Three identified playgrounds were in line with the LTP Level of Service Performance Target.\n\n3.0 CURRENT SITUATION\n\n3.1 After further consultation with the submitter and explaining Councils LTP around playgrounds, the submitted reassessed her application.\n\n3.2 The submitter was also informed that Council’s Parks team would soon be consulting the wider Flaxmere Community around the renewal of playground in Flaxmere.\n\n3.3 The Submitter also felt that it would be difficult to raise required funds for the new play space or courts.\n\n3.4 The submitter was not aware of Councils process and future plans when making the submission and felt that the $10,000 would benefit the wider community if it was spent on upgrading and enhancing the existing playgrounds.\n\n4.0 OPTIONS\n\n4.1 That the 2016/17 Annual Plan approval of $10,000 to be used to upgrade an existing playground identified through community consultation.\n\n4.2 That the approved $10,000 be set aside for future development in Flaxmere West that could align to any plans or strategies.\n\n4.3 That the 2016/17 Annual Plan allocation that arose from Mrs Ngapoe’s submission be restracted.\n\n5.0 ASSESSMENT OF OPTIONS\n\n5.1 Option 1 will allow for additional funds above the current budget for playground\n\nequipment into one of three parks in the area that will be identified through community consultation. Mrs Ngapoe spoke with her community and they identified this as the preferred way forward.\n\n5.2 Option 2 could allow for some seed funding to assist the implementation of the Flaxmere West Community Plan and strategies which are currently being developed.\n\n5.3 Option 3 would allow for the allocation to be removed.\n\n6.0 PREFERRED OPTION/S AND REASONS\n\n6.1 That the 2016/17 Annual Plan approval of $10,000 be used to upgrade an existing playground identified through community consultation. This will enable enhanced playground equipment to be provided in conjunction with Council playground renewal programme in the most appropriate location.\n\nAttachments:\n\nThere are no attachments for this report.\n\nFile Ref: 17/1084\n\nREPORT TO: Social & Cultural Development Committee\n\nMEETING DATE: Tuesday 31 October 2017\n\nFROM: Team Leader Strategy & Projects\n\nLouise Stettner\n\nSUBJECT: Safer Hastings:Update\n\n1.0 SUMMARY\n\n1.1 The purpose of this report is to provide an update to the Committee on Safer Hastings.\n\n1.2 The Council is required to give effect to the purpose of local government as prescribed by Section 10 of the Local Government Act 2002.
