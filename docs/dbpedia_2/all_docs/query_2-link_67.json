They are chosen for their willingness to challenge the behaviour of abusive men, and to convey key messages directly to their own communities.\n\nNOMINATE AN AMBASSADOR\n\nPlease feel free to download and submit your nomination forms for 2020.\n\nWe are looking to communities to nominate potential male and female Ambassadors who are respected and influential role models in their workplaces, businesses, government departments, faith, cultural groups or wider communities. All nominees must be informed of the nomination and sign a statement that they are living violence-free lives and will uphold the White Ribbon pledge not to commit, condone or remain silent about violence towards women.

Anna held the role of Chief People Officer of The Warehouse Group until November last year. During her time at the Group, The Warehouse became the first New Zealand employer to gain White Ribbon accreditation. Anna’s role as an ambassador will be to encourage other businesses to seek White Ribbon Business Accreditation. “As a mother of three boys, I’m acutely aware of the importance of raising them to understand what good relationships are and to be respectful men. However, New Zealand companies also need to play their role. Family violence has serious and devastating effects in New Zealand. For employers, it can impact your team’s ability to bring their best selves to work. So, I encourage employers to support their team whether they’re impacted by violence or want to stop using violence.” Anna believes New Zealand is one of the best countries in the world at hurting the people we love, and we all need to get involved to solve this problem.\n\nANNE SINGH\n\nAnne Singh is a dedicated, resourceful and resilient servant leader, who collaborates well with all stakeholders.

I intend to lead efforts in raising awareness about domestic violence and will help victims by referring them to local services, resources and other support available to them. I will become a link between victims. Due to my media background, I understand the importance of an effective campaign and will assist by sharing important information within the community. The strong community support I have garnered over the years means I will be able to challenge the taboos regarding Domestic violence within ethnic communities.”\n\nAWEN GUTTENBEIL\n\nAwen retired from professional league several years ago, and is now a Sports commentator for Maori Television (Code) and Sky Television. He is married to Natasha has two children.\n\nAwen says he is motivated to support White Ribbon Day because of his personal experience of family violence. “As a child I was around it and exposed to it,” Awen says. “I remember how terrifying it was and I still battle with it. It scarred me deeply – and as an adult I try to avoid confrontations because it brings back all those terrible feelings. I still remember those feelings from when I was three or four.”\n\n“As a role model for White Ribbon Day, I would love to encourage more men to hold each other accountable so that they are never intimidating or violent in their home, and with their family. It takes a brave person to take up the challenge to break the cycle for generations of males in their family. To me that’s a role model.”\n\nBARRY HELEM\n\nOriginally from Greymouth, but now residing in Christchurch, Barry is an experienced senior manager & CEO with a track record of success leading multi-site organisations in both the non-profit and corporate sectors.\n\nAfter a successful career as a senior manager in the financial services industry, Barry’s compassion, empathy and desire to serve the community led him to transfer his leadership skills to the non-profit sector in late 2011 as CEO of SPCA Canterbury. In 2017 he was appointed General Manager, Southern Region for SPCA New Zealand and then in June 2019 commenced his current role as CEO of Presbyterian Support Upper South Island, providing a range of social services to support communities in Canterbury, Nelson, Marlborough and the West Coast.\n\nWhite Ribbon is a cause close to Barry’s heart. During his tenure at SPCA, he established individual MOU’s with local Christchurch women’s refuge and family violence agencies. This provided short-term pet accommodation at SPCA to enable families to leave domestic violence situations without fear of repercussion against their animals.\n\nBarry is married to Tracee and they have 3 children and 3 grandchildren.

His goal is ‘that all families are living free of fear, have peace of mind and above all without violence’.\n\nBILL O’BRIEN (former White Ribbon Ambassador)\n\nBill has stepped down from being a White Ribbon Ambassador to focus on writing his new book. Bill O’Brien has seen the trauma associated with violent behaviour during a 35-year-long policing career. He was a Trustee with the Sophie Elliott Foundation where he advocates zero tolerance to abuse. Bill managed the police-run year 12 Loves-Me-Not workshops in schools nationwide from a Foundation perspective and also acts as voluntary manager for Lesley Elliott.\n\nBill has a strong personal connection to the White Ribbon movement. When researching for a book on the behavioural traits of mass-murderers he corresponded with Montreal police seeking background information into the Montreal Polytechnic killings. A reply he received from a police inspector shook him. The officer, responding to the tragedy, went from room to room where 14 young women had died. In the last classroom he found the body of his own daughter. That officer and Bill continued corresponding for some years.\n\nIt was that rampage that saw the formation of the White Ribbon movement, a cause Bill feels personally committed to. We thank Bill for all the work he has put into violence prevention.\n\nBISHNU POKHREL\n\nBishnu came to New Zealand in 2006 as a refugee from Nepal.

There is some justice in knowing that Helen’s killer is behind bars, but I need to do more than that. I need to make sense of the awful situation we found ourselves in, and do my part to ensure the violence against women is both understood and ended.” As part of his mission to change attitudes, david write the book, Helen, the Helen Meads Tragedy.\n\n“This book is an attempt to shine the light on abusive relationships. As parents Pam and I didn’t recognise the warning signs, we didn’t know what to do, and tragically, neither did our daughter. If we had known to look on the Women’s Refuge site, Helen would have understood that the most dangerous time is when you are leaving an abusive relationship.”\n\nDAVID WARREN\n\nDavid has a long history of advocating for the equality of women and men and has been running sessions about eliminating violence towards women over the past year with excellent results.\n\nAs a White Ribbon Ambassador David hopes to continue the work for eliminating violence towards women, advance the equality of women and men and create a greater social awareness for the opportunities and needs of the area.\n\nDEREK BLIGHT\n\nDerek is currently Community Development Advisor at Westland District Council, Elder at Hokitika Christian Fellowship, Coordinator of the Big Brothers Big Sisters Mentoring Programme in Hokitika, Secretary of the Hokitika Community Patrol, member of the steering committee for the Hokitika Community Champions Project and Coordinator of the Safe Community Coalition in Westland.\n\nHe has been married for 42 years to Diana, father of four children and grandfather of 13 grandchildren.

Having worked in the police for some time I have seen how the effects of family harm not only affected the intended victim but also others within the family unit who have witnessed the harm being delivered.\n\nHaving taught the Loves-me-not programme in relation to respectful relationships since its inception I am only too familiar with the harm caused by isolation, intimidation and other psychological affects.\n\nThis cycle of harm escalates in frequency and affect on the victim. Being an ambassador may give me the opportunity to assist a victim or family member experiencing family harm I may not otherwise have been able to help.\n\nJENAE TURNER\n\nHailing from Canada and now residing in Auckland, Jenae works as a Business Consultant at an Employee Experience Consultancy and is focused on learning and understanding people and their behaviour in order to improve their experiences at work.

We have a wide circle of people in every walk of life we deal with every day.\n\nKathy & I have been involved with the White Ribbon Ride for four years & it’s something that is very close to our hearts, as I was a perpetrator in the first three years of my first marriage of seven years, & Kathy was a victim of physical & mental abuse for most of her first marriage of five years.\n\nBeing able to talk about our past to men & women of all ages about how our kids turned out with their relationships has helped others make changes in their lives.\n\nKathy & I have been married for 34 years & have 11 kids, 22 grandchildren & 1 great grandson between us.\n\nHON KELVIN DAVIS MP\n\n“It is with real pride that I have been asked to become a White Ribbon Ambassador and it is a responsibility I take seriously. I believe those of us who are committed to being loving and respectful men need to speak out loudly and clearly that we will not tolerate violence in any form, be it verbal, physical, emotional or sexual. The vast majority of men are good men; we just need to make it known to our sons, brothers, fathers, uncles, cousins, nephews and mates who are violent, that their behaviour needs to change. Violent behaviour is a choice. With our collective determination we can turn the tide of violence against women, children – and other men, even if we have to do it one man at a time.\n\nKEN MAHON\n\nKen resides in sunny Nelson and is happily married to Jan.

The White Ribbon Trust is proud to have had Mark’s service over so many many years. He has been an inspiration and one of our most sought after speakers. “My daughter would have supported any opportunity for me to speak out against men’s violence and White Ribbon is an effective campaign that allows men to speak to other men. It’s been hard though, reliving the loss of a family member, but if I have stopped just one act of violence then it’s been worth it.” Our thoughts will always be with Mark as we keep the memory of Sophie alive so that no other parent should ever go through such a traumatic experience again.\n\nHON MARK MITCHELL\n\nMark Mitchell was a Cabinet Minister in the last National Government and is National’s MP for Rodney.

I recognize and understand that simply because someone is a perpetrator of violence, that does not necessarily make them a bad person as quite often these perpetrators also need help to turn their lives around.\n\nQuite often by doing this they become an important part of our journey with White Ribbon whanau, sharing their experiences as we travel around helping others realize there is a “way out”.\n\nI look forward to continuing my journey with the White Ribbon Campaign both on the road and within my region to stop violence, but also to help remove the stigma of Domestic Violence, which often stops both victims and perpetrators from seeking help.\n\nMARK URI-PUATI\n\nMark works as a Counsellor in Private Practice primarily in the city of Porirua and also the wider Wellington area.

Over the years they have adopted many kids and seen most of them grow into adulthood.\n\nMaurice was an ex-gang member and is now an example of change! His background has similarities to some of the people he works with, but his current lifestyle represents an example of what happens when men get the opportunity to create positive changes with positive outcomes. Maurice notes: “I model a lifestyle of core values that govern my representation and outcome. Nothing is impossible, but that it is only pride, ego, self-esteem and a self-righteous attitude that holds us back from being the partner, husband, dad and friend that we want to become.” He is a Senor Elder (Pastor) in a community church.\n\nMaurice has been involved in the White Ribbon Ride for the last 6 years with Te Ahi Kikoha that is run by Takurua & Cathy Tawera.
