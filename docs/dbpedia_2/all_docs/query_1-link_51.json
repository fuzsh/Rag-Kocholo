        "text": "29 April 2024\n\nAs seen on nswrl.com\n\nThe U17 Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs wāhine etched their place in history with a convincing 36-0 win over the Wests Tigers in the inaugural Grand Final of the Westpac Lisa Fiaola Cup.\n\nWinger Asha Taumoepeau-Williams continued what she’s been producing all season for the Under 17s girls. She had 11 tries coming into today’s decider and ratcheted that up to 15 by the end of the match.\n\nBut the one to snatch Player of the Match was hooker Mary-Jane Taito for her scheming work around the ruck and her relentless defence.\n\nFormer dual international Lisa Fiaola presented the match ball to Taito and congratulated five-eighth Evelyn Roberts, who scored two tries today, after she was named Player of the Series.\n\nTaito and Roberts were just two of the young kiwi wāhine who made the move to Sydney to join the Bulldogs side. They were joined by Seriah Palepale, Lahnayah Daniel, Paige Tauaneai, Trinity Tauaneai, Josinah Filisi Tauiliili, and Giovanna Suani.\n\nBulldogs coach Michael Stuart had warned his team not to expect everything to go their way in the finals even though they had been the dominant team all season to finish as Minor Premiers.\n\n“Finals is a whole new competition, so we prepared a little bit differently to reflect that,” Stuart told nswrl.com.au\n\nThe Bulldogs beat the Newcastle Knights 22-4 in last weekend’s Semi-final to concede just one try in two matches while scoring 13 of their own.\n\n“The girls deserve it, they’ve had a long, hard seven months and this is just the icing on the cake,” Stuart said.\n\n“We’ve got a lot of local girls in the team. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a team bond and come together as quick as these girls have.”\n\nAs for his winger’s four tries: “She’s only 15; turns 16 in November; and she’s a superstar.”\n\nTaumoepeu-Williams said she had scored four tries before for her junior club in New Zealand.\n\n“But it feels good to do it today,” she said. “We’ve bonded so well in a short amount of time. My teammates are my friends and like family.”\n\nAnd as for the secret to scoring so often in a grand final?\n\n“I just trusted my team.”\n\nThis was the Bulldogs 10th straight victory – eight in the regular season and two finals.\n\nIt might have been first versus fifth on the ladder, but the Wests Tigers mustered a fine Semi-final win with a 32-14 upset over the second-placed Illawarra Steelers.\n\nAlthough they tried hard, they were denied possession today and were outclassed in the middle and on the edges.\n\nA try in the opening minute, and then three more in a six minute period later in the first half, helped the Bulldogs to a commanding 18-0 half-time lead.\n\nThey gobbled up possession, restricting the Wests Tigers to only two entries into their territory for the first 30 minutes.\n\nIt was the Bulldogs right edge that shone – three of their first four tries came down that channel.\n\nThe first try was off a Tigers mistake in the opening set. On the third play the Bulldogs shot the ball through the hands for Taumoepeau-Williams to score his first for the day – her 12th for the season.\n\nShe followed up with a second in the 18th minute after a neat chip kick from halfback and skipper Olivia Vaalele.\n\nThe other first-half tries came from second rower Aliahana Fuimaono – cousin of Westpac NSW Sky Blues utility Taliah Fuimaono – who put on a mighty left fend to see her way to the chalk.\n\nThen in the 20th minute five-eighth Evelyn Roberts stepped off her left foot, then her right, for a fine individual try.\n\nThe Wests Tigers were awarded the only penalty of the first half but were unable to capitalise.\n\nIn the second half the dominance continued with another three tries, including Taumoepeau-Williams grabbing her third and fourth.\n\nRoberts bagged her second and centre Lahnayah Daniel got onto the scoresheet supporting Roberts, who drew in the defence on the left edge.\n\nThe win in the metropolitan version of the Lisa Fiaola Cup followed a 22-8 win by the Western Rams 22-8 over the Northern Tigers last March in the regional NSW competition of the same name.\n\nRead more on nswrl.com\n\n26 April 2024\n\n20-year-old Zyon Maiu’u from West Auckland made his NRL debut last night for the One New Zealand Warriors’, in their narrow loss to the Gold Coast Titans at GoMedia Mt. Smart Stadium.\n\nComing on in the 57th minute, the young prop/second rower instantly made an impact in the middle with his strong up-the-guts running style. In just 13 minutes on the field Maiu’u took seven runs for a total of 77 run metres, 39 of which were post-contact.\n\nHis intensity visibly lifted the energy for the Warriors who were battling against the clock to make a late comeback against the leading Titans.\n\nMaiu’u started off in the Warriors 2020 S. G. Ball Cup squad, before signing a three-year contract with the club in 2021.\n\nUpon his signing, Peter O’Sullivan Warriors recruitment manager praised Maiu’u’s “competitiveness, skill and toughness and ability to play edge and middle equally as well as the other”.\n\nSince 2023 he has been a mainstay in the Warriors New South Wales Cup squad having played 32 matches, until earning the call-up to the NRL side this week.\n\nA Te Atatu Roosters junior, Maiu’u featured in the 2020 NZRL New Zealand Schools representative side and the following year played in the NZRL National 20s Competition with the Auckland Blue team, going on to be named Tournament MVP.\n\nWith only a first small glimpse of his talent and impact seen on the NRL stage last night, young Zyon Maiu’u is definitely one to watch.\n\n15 Feb 2024\n\nThe New Zealand Rugby League (NZRL) proudly announces that the ‘RISE’ Talent Development Programme, in partnership with the NRL, is back for 2024.\n\nAfter its inaugural year in NZ in 2023, the ‘RISE’ Talent Development Programme aims to better prepare young players for the rigours of high-performance environments such as the NRLW, targeting female players aged 17-19 years of age.\n\nThis weekend, the ‘RISE’ programme expands to various cities in New Zealand. Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch will host Rise sessions for young aspiring female players to improve their skills, learn the basics of strength and conditioning, and understand the significance of player well-being.\n\n2023, which also saw the establishment of the NZRL Ahi Kā Aotearoa squad that competed in the Harvey Norman Women’s National Championship in 2023. Players who were selected for the squad were part of the inaugural Rise programme, which serves as a pathway for young females to\n\nWith the NRLW growing from six to 10 teams in 2023, female players have more opportunities to be recognised and establish themselves as elite athletes. The RISE programme is the next step for aspiring Kiwi players to become NRLW players and future Kiwi Ferns.\n\nOctober 23 2023\n\nThe 2023 16s and 18s boys and girls national representative fixtures showcased some of the best young rugby league talent throughout the four matches held at Auckland’s Bruce Pulman Park. Both Aotearoa Whaanui boys and girls teams produced wins over the Auckland invitational sides, while the Clubs v Schools matches saw the boys Clubs and girls Schools teams emerge as winners.\n\nAotearoa Whaanui 16s Girls v Auckland Invitational Girls\n\nAotearoa Whaanui 38-0\n\nThe Aotearoa Whaanui girls team portrayed much skill and strength in their convincing win over the Auckland Invitational girls side. Scoring for the match was opened by Whaanui winger Prayer Playle who crossed the white line off the back of an expert long ball by halfback Hera Maihi. Maihi was dependable with kicking duties throughout the match, successfully kicking four conversions and one penalty goal. The Whaanui side proved too strong for the Aucklanders going on to score eight unanswered tries, finishing the game as victors 38-0. Centre Te Maia Sweetman finished the match with a double, with her teammates Prayer Playle, Bailey Edwards, Ava-Lea Maxwell Ogilvy, Kayshana Rapana, and captain Mihikorama Kerr all crossing for tries.\n\nAotearoa Whaanui 16s Boys v Auckland Invitational Boys\n\nAotearoa Whaanui 20-10\n\nSpine-tingling hakas set the scene for the Auckland v Aotearoaa Whaanui 16s Boys clash at Auckland’s Pulman Park. However, the first forty was one-way traffic for the Aotearoa side. South Island’s Azaniah Roebeck opened the scoring, followed by consecutive tries to South Island’s Torino Jackson, Waikato’s Fine Fale and Wellington’s Shae TeKauri Taitua. The half-time hooter worked wonders for the Auckland side as they regrouped to find their comeback form. Auckland’s Charleston Te Rore set the scene for the second half, earning the 09’s first points through a barging run up the middle. Consecutive Auckland tries to Peter Faaleaga, and Steven Moala followed, but the clock rang full-time, and the comeback was cut short. An impressive second-half Auckland effort wasn’t enough for Whaanui’s first-half dominance, final score 20-10.\n\nNew Zealand Resident Clubs Boys v National Secondary Schools Boys\n\nNew Zealand Resident Clubs Boys 30-22\n\nThis intense clash saw heavy contact and excellent ball play from both 18s boys sides as they battled for the full 70 minutes. The Clubs team came out firing, with Captain Rodney Tuipulotu-Vea scoring first after an opportunity created by a kick from half Maui Winitana-Patelesio. Winitana-Patelesio was also successful for three conversions in the match. The NZ Resident Clubs side continued to dominate the first half, scoring three more tries bringing the score to 20-0 at halftime. The Schools side made a resurgence in the second half after prop forward Malachi Filipo crossed to put their first points on the board. They maintained momentum scoring two more consecutive tries but were ultimately outlasted by the Clubs boys, who went on to win the game 30-22.\n\nNew Zealand Resident Clubs Girls v National Secondary Schools Girls\n\nNational Secondary Schools Girls 32-28\n\nFullback Jessica Patea put first points on the board for NZ Clubs, but NZ Schools had the upper hand for most of the first half. Containing the Schools’ middles proved challenging as field position swayed heavily in favour of the Secondary Schools side. Schools led 20-6 at the break through tries to Shafenior Lui, Evelyn Roberts, Danii-Nicole Gray and Josinah Filisi Tauilili. Filisi Tauilili scored a double to kick off the final forty before Schools’ hooker Evelyn Roberts barged over for her second shortly after. NZ Club captain Braxton Sorensen-McGee cleverly found space on the line, injecting momentum into her side as they bridged the gap 32-12. That momentum carried as the return set saw winger Danii Mafoe crash over after a full-field effort from NZ Clubs with the deficit now 16. The Clubs began to find space as their comeback edged closer and closer. Consecutive line breaks saw winger Elenoa Havea barge over, making it a ten-point game with ten to go. More metres down the middle from an inspired Schools side saw it become a four point game with two minutes to go. A powerful kick-off from NZ Schools kept their lead alive as they got the ball back on the return set, but a knock-on soon after gave Clubs one final shot. A last-ditch attempt from Clubs to score a 100m try fell agonisingly short as the full-time hooter rang; NZ Schools held on to victory, 32-28.\n\nOctober 19 2023\n\nThe 2023 16s and 18s boys and girls representative fixtures boast an extreme amount of top talent from across the motu. New Zealand Rugby League is proud to announce the return of the Clubs vs Schools match-up as well as the return of Aotearoa Whaanui vs Auckland Invitational. This 16s clash puts the top talent from around Aotearoa up against the melting pot that is Tāmaki Makaurau, whilst the 18s Clubs vs Schools fixture is a combination of the best players from both the NZRL National Secondary Schools and National Youth Tournaments. All matches are set to take place at Auckland’s Bruce Pulman Park on Monday 23 October.\n\nNZRL General Manager of Football & High-Performance Motu Tony stated, “Another successful year of the National Secondary Schools and NZRL National Youth Tournaments gave our rangatahi and rugby league community a fantastic opportunity to come together.\n\n“The tournaments showcased the enormous talent we have playing and participating in rugby league, and our expanded female National Youth Tournament showed that the future of the Kiwi Ferns is bright and exciting.\n\n“The efforts of those who performed exceptionally well in our tournaments have been recognised. They will get another opportunity to connect and compete with the rugby league talent throughout the motu.\n\nI am excited about the talent we have that will compete in these fixtures and also proud that we can offer our young female players another representative opportunity.”\n\nAll games are free to attend at Bruce Pulman Park, Takanini, and will be live-streamed on the NZRL YouTube channel:

Crutcher featured in the inaugural U19 Ahi Kā Aotearoa team, who competed in the Harvey Norman Women’s Championship in the Gold Coast earlier this year. Now, the girls are preparing to move to Sydney together in the coming months, having signed on with the Manly Sea Eagles for their 2024 U19 Tarsha Gale Cup squad.\n\nThe Ahi Kā Aotearoa representative team Tanaia and Maia were part of comprised U19 players who participated in the ‘RISE’ Talent Development Programme, delivered in partnership with the NRL. The programme aims to better prepare young players for the rigours of high-performance environments such as the NRLW, targeting female players aged 17-19.\n\nWith the Ahi Kā team, Tanaia and Maia faced the First Nation’s Gems, QLD Ruby’s, NSW Country Women, and South Australia in the Championship. The Harvey Norman Women’s National Championship is an elite pathways tournament allowing players across Australia and now New Zealand to showcase their skills in the representative arena. “There’s a lot more opportunities for us as girls to get out there”, shared Tanaia.\n\nTanaia hails from Whangaparaoa, while Maia proudly comes from Whakapara, north of Whāngarei. Maia was part of the Northern Swords Wāhine Squad for the 2022 National Women’s North Island Championship. The 18-year-old has come up through the grades for the last three seasons at the Hibiscus Coast Raiders, and previously participated in NZ Māori Rugby League kōtiro tournaments. “The game has definitely grown ever since I first started playing, it’s good to see”, she reflected. Having previously played rugby union for Whangaparaoa College, Tanaia made the code switch to league and although only in her second year of playing she has already made a name for herself to earn sought-after recognition and opportunities.\n\nAs newcomers competing in their first National Girls Youth Tournament, Maia and Tanaia featured in the squad of 2022 champions and 2023 finalists, the Akarana Falcons. The girls earned selection for the Falcons after stellar seasons for the Hibiscus Coast Raiders in the Auckland Rugby League 18s competition this year. The pair shared much anticipation for the next step in their rugby league journey, which takes them to join the Manly Sea Eagles for the 2024 NSWRL U19 Tarsha Gale Cup season. As she now prepares to make the move to Sydney with her teammate and friend, Tanaia shared, “We’re super excited to be able to have this opportunity.”\n\n“It’s a massive opportunity; we’re super humble and truly grateful,” said Maia.\n\n18 May 2023\n\nIn game one of the Harvey Norman Women’s Championship, Ahi kā Aotearoa suffered their first defeat to the First Nation Gems 14-8.\n\nThe game started with a cultural salute as the First Nation Gems welcomed Ahi Kā onto the field with an indigenous welcome for their inaugural year.\n\nThe game started in a classic arm wrestle match as both teams battled in the first half for possession and territory of the field. The First Nation Gems capitalised off their first opportunity as they forced an error in Ahi Kā’s half, using this to get the first try of the game.\n\nFirst Nation Gems quickly followed up with another try as they utilised the quick ruck speed they generated to catch the Ahi Kā Aotearoa team off guard to go right through the middle.\n\nAhi Kā found their groove as they strung together solid runs to gain excellent field position right before halftime. A lovely cut-out ball to Marewa Samson, who delivered some beautiful quick hands to put Kyla Lynch-Brown in for a try, leaving the halftime score 10-4.\n\nAhi Kā started the second half off firing as they managed to regather the kick restart. Great scrambling defence from the First Nation Gems robbed the NZ side of a try to even the score. Quick play of the balls and fast ruck speed would be the catalyst for the next First Nation Gems try, as the score would be 18-4 with five minutes to go.\n\nVice-captain Monica Samita would scoot out at dummy half to crash over the line to give Ahi Kā a fighting chance in the game with three minutes to go. With the one minute left and NZ desperately trying to create opportunities, a shift on the final tackle put Marewa Samson in space, who would offload to Kyla Lynch-Brown, who managed to run 30 metres before she got run down by some great scrambling defence from the First Nation Gems to close the game out 14-8.\n\n18 May 2023\n\nThe Harvey Norman Women’s Championship in the Gold Coast kicks off today as Ahi Kā Aoteroa takes on the First Nation Gems at Pizzey Park at 2.30 pm (NZT).\n\nCoach Frank Fuimaono has named a strong team to kick-start the competition announcing 2022 NZ Clubs representative Summer Van Gelder as captain for the 2023 campaign.\n\nAlong with the Ahi Kā Aotearoa squad, several NZ girls are also competing today, as Alexis Tauaenai and Tatiana Finau, who were both a part of the 2022 NZ Clubs team, are playing for the NSW City squad.

They will get another opportunity to connect and compete with the rugby league talent throughout the motu.\n\nI am excited about the talent we have that will compete in these fixtures and also proud that we can offer our young female players a representative opportunity for the first time.”\n\nAll games are free to attend and live on Sky Sport!\n\nAuckland Invitational Boys 16s versus Aotearoa Whaanui Boys 16s; Monday 24 October, 2 pm.

The club responded quickly to Auckland’s second lockdown by providing a free Covid-19 testing station in their car park, encouraging members within their community to get checked.\n\nGala days, school holiday programmes and free meals for local families, are only a fraction of the work Mangere East have been doing off the field to continually serve the needs of their people, epitomising NZRL’s More Than A Game.\n\nThe 2020 NZ 16s Player of the Year was awarded to Marists’ Tre Fotu. He was a standout against the NZ Māori 17s scoring a double and continually asking questions of the defence.\n\nNZ 16s Head Coach, Phil Gordon says; “Tre is a young man who epitomised the meaning and value of wearing the Black and White jersey. He was a focused trainer, disciplined in his approach and committed to executing game plans and structures at the highest level.”\n\nThe NZ 18s Player of the Year for 2020 was awarded to Northcote Tiger and NZ 18s Clubs captain, Sam McIntyre. Sam captained the NZ 18s Club team in the inaugural Schools v Clubs match, scoring one try and leading his side to a 34-22 victory.\n\nNZ 18s Head Coach, Tusa Lafaele says; “Sam has always displayed a high skill level, technique and ability as an athlete. Often what separates the talented from the successful, is the attitude and fortitude to work hard and be prepared to make sacrifices. Sam has always applied himself in this manner, striving for success and competing with true grit.”\n\nAkarana veteran, Francis Leger, was awarded NZRL Domestic Men’s Player of the Year due to his outstanding season captaining Akarana to their fifth straight NZRL Premiership victory, as well as the NZ Residents.\n\nHarata Butler took home NZRL Domestic Women’s Player of the Year after a successful season in Counties Manukau colours, earning her MVP of the Sky Sport Women’s Premiership as well as her international Kiwi Ferns debut.\n\nNZRL Domestic Coach of the Year was awarded to Phil Gordon after he coached his undefeated Akarana side to an impressive fifth NZRL Premiership, as well the NZ Resident 16s to a convincing 42-6 victory over the NZ Māori Resident 17s.\n\nNZRL Match Official of the Year was awarded to veteran Paki Parkinson after a successful season officiating the NZRL Premiership, NZ 16s and the NZ Residents v NZ Maori Residents.\n\nPirtek’s 2020 Volunteer of the Year was awarded to Takahiwai’s Shayne Wassel. Despite several disabilities including mild deafness, speech impediment and blindness in one eye, the single father of four never lets that get in the way of his ability to go above and beyond for his local club, whanau and community – Read more about Shayne’s story here.\n\nNZRL would also like to give a special mention to runner up clubs for Grassroots Club of the Year, the Eastern Eagles and Timaru Outlaws.\n\nDespite financial difficulties, the Eastern Eagles immediately switched focus to supporting its club members and the wider community through the COVID-19 pandemic. Seeking support from local businesses, the Eagles procured and co-ordinated the receipt and delivery of hundreds of food packs and other essentials items, reaching pockets of the community that were often missed.\n\nThe Timaru Outlaws, just four years old, had only one U7s team in 2018, as of 2020 they now have five junior teams playing under the senior side equating to around 100 registered U13 players. Based in a non-traditional rugby league area, with no club rooms, it’s the collective efforts of the community and their strong whanau values-driven approach that has seen this club flourish with momentum only continuing to rise.\n\nNZRL CEO, Greg Peters says, “These awards recognise exceptional work in our grassroots, domestic and community space both on and off the field. We congratulate each recipient on their outstanding achievement.\n\n“Thank you to those in our rugby league communities who continue to go above and beyond for our game. In what was a challenging year for most, it’s the dedication of our people that keep rugby league thriving – thank you.”\n\n2020 NZRL Community Award Winners\n\nGrassroots Club of the Year – Mangere East\n\nDomestic Men’s Player of the Year – Francis Leger\n\nDomestic Women’s Player of the Year – Harata Butler\n\nDomestic Coach of the Year – Phil Gordon\n\nU16s Player of the Year – Tre Fotu\n\nU18s Player of the Year – Sam McIntyre\n\nMatch Official of the Year – Paki Parkinson\n\nPirtek Volunteer of the Year – Shayne Wassel\n\nTo watch the NZRL Community Awards, please click here.\n\nThe NZRL High-Performance Awards will be broadcast tonight Sky Sport 4 at 7:30 pm.\n\nDecember 9, 2020\n\nNew Zealand Rugby League will kick off its inaugural National 20s Competition on Saturday 27 February 2021.

NZRL will take this a step further come 2022 by entering an NZRL U19 team into the NSW SG Ball competition.\n\nThe NZRL National 20s Competition will not only showcase New Zealand’s domestic game but it will provide Clubs and Districts with the opportunity to recruit and retain rangatahi talent, an age group notorious for significant drop-offs in sporting activity according to Sport NZ.\n\nNZRL GM of High Performance and Football, Motu Tony says: “We have been working hard to improve the pathways we provide for our young rugby league players in New Zealand.”\n\n“Our rangatahi are vital to the domestic and professional success of the code, the average age of an NRL debutant is now 21, so it’s crucial we are developing and strengthening this age group as much as we can at home. This competition also allows coaches, managers, trainers and match officials to gain further development and experience.\n\n“The 20s Competition allows us to foster budding rugby league talent from up and down the country and the potential NZRL 2022 SG Ball team adds another layer of incentive for our young players.”\n\nFixture list and venue confirmation will be finalised in the coming weeks.\n\n8 November 2020\n\nThe inaugural U18s New Zealand Club vs Schools kicked off at Mt Smart Stadium in what was an inspired and hotly contested matchup.\n\nComing out of the gates strongly, initial pressure from the clubs’ side saw captain Sam McIntyre break the deadlock. Clubs were unable to convert to leave the score at 4-0 after six minutes.\n\nA mistake off the kick-off allowed a set on the Clubs’ line and the Schools team did not fail to level. Tome Poona executing a pin point cross field kick for Matua Robinson to leap and score. Poona converted to give the Schools a two point lead.\n\nThe Clubs team regained the lead in the 17th minute, this time taking advantage of a Schools’ mistake, number four Daeon Amituanai crashed over the line to make it 8-6. Half Sebastyan Jack again unable to add the extras.\n\nTwo minutes later, the Clubs left edge centre bulldozed his way over the line. Salesi Ataata capping off a great set of brilliance by the Clubs side. Jack again unable to convert as the score stayed at 12 points to six.\n\nA barnstorming effort from Elam Payne set up Daeon Amituanai for his second, as the Clubs team further their advantage 18-6.\n\nSchools hit back after receiving two penalties, a right side shift saw Eric Vaafusuaga grab his first of the afternoon to close the gap. Poona kicked wide to leave the score at 18-10 with 10 remaining in the half.\n\nA sneaky kick in behind from hooker Jarney Proctor-Harwood was enough to gift his captain a second try of the half, McIntyre latching on to make it 22-10 for the Clubs outfit.\n\nOn the stroke of half time Austin Anderson grabbed his first try from dummy-half, Poona was unable add the conversion as Clubs took a 24-14 lead into the sheds.\n\nEric Vaafusuaga scored his second try of the afternoon to kick off the second forty, crashing over after a sharp set move by the Schools. Poona was unable to convert as the Clubs lead was reduced back to six,\n\nDaeon Amituanai completed his hat trick, as he crashed over from dummy-half in the 54th minute. Sebstyan Jack converted from the right touchline to take the Clubs to a 30-18 buffer.\n\nA grubber rebounded back into the clutches of Austin Anderson saw the Schools keep the pressure on the Clubs side, with Poona unable to convert as the score remained 30-22 with a quarter left to play.\n\nTrading scores, the Club side hit back when five eight Josiah Karapani crashed over after a brilliant show of footwork. TJ Devery took over the kicking duties for the injured Sebastyan Jack but was unable to convert his first attempt. Clubs go up 34-22 with just over 15 minutes to play.\n\nClubs held on a late flurry from the Schools side to capture victory in the first-ever U18s Clubs vs Schools clash. Final Score Clubs 34 – Schools 22.\n\nOctober 16, 2020\n\nNew Zealand Rugby League wishes to congratulate the following players selected in the NZRL Schools and NZRL Clubs teams who are set to face each other in the inaugural NZRL Schools v Clubs match on November 8th at Mt Smart Stadium.\n\nThe NZRL Schools v Clubs game will kick-off at 2 pm followed by the NZ Residents v NZ Māori Residents match at 4 pm. It’s a gold coin entry into Mt Smart on the day and thanks to Sky Sport both games will be televised live.\n\nThe NZRL Schools v Clubs match is the first of its kind and will act as a key development pathway for New Zealand 18 players.\n\nFor 2020, the New Zealand Schools team comprises of identified players from the Auckland Rugby League Secondary Schools competition as well as those registered in full-time study.\n\nThe New Zealand Clubs team consists of identified players who have competed in regional tournaments or a meaningful club competition in 2020.\n\nGoing forward, this inaugural fixture is set to stick as an annual event in which the New Zealand Schools team will comprise of players actively playing in the NZRL National Secondary school competition, and the New Zealand Clubs team will be selected from District, Zone and National Youth programmes.\n\nUnfortunately, due to COVID-19 the National Secondary School Competition and NZRL Youth tournament were cancelled for 2020; however, players identified in the New Zealand Resident 18s wider squad back in February make up the majority of the selections for this year.\n\nNZRL GM of Football and High Performance, Motu Tony says; “This Schools v Clubs match is an important pathway going forward for our young and aspiring Kiwi talent. Although COVID has altered our selection process a bit for this year, it’s exciting to see this fixture come to light despite the pandemic setbacks.\n\n“We have an impressive list of talented 18 players from up and down the country representing both the Schools and Clubs sides. This game presents our 18s with a great opportunity to showcase their skill and position themselves favourably for opportunities that may arise in 2021.”\n\nNZRL congratulates the following players:\n\nSeptember 17, 2020\n\nMt Smart Stadium is set to host a jam-packed weekend of rugby league action as the inaugural NZRL Schools v Clubs (18s) match followed by an NZ Residents v NZ Māori Residents game have been scheduled for Sunday, November 8, following the Kiwi Ferns v Fetū Samoa Test the day prior.\n\nThe inaugural NZRL Schools v Clubs game (18s) will kick-off at 2 pm at Mt Smart followed by the NZ Residents v NZ Māori Residents match at 4 pm. Thanks to Sky Sport both games will be televised live.\n\nThe NZ Residents squad will consist of the best players from the NZRL National Men’s competition kicking off on October 3.\n\nThe last time the two met was in 2017 where the NZ Māori Residents came away with a 22 – 16 victory over the NZ Residents squad.\n\nNZRL CEO Greg Peters says; “To see our NZ Residents and NZ Māori Residents face each other once again is an exciting milestone, it will be a tough clash with plenty of passion and a great way to finish off a specular weekend of rugby league action at Mt Smart.\n\n“The Residents selection is an important accolade and increases the standard of competition for our National Competition. This match will showcase New Zealand’s best grassroots talent from up and down the country, and it’s great to work with NZ Māori Rugby League (NZMRL) again to produce a quality rugby league event.”\n\nNZMRL Chairman, John Devonshire, is delighted that a Māori Residents side will be taking on the NZ Residents in November.\n\n“It is a win-win scenario for both organisations, and it’s great to see the two sides come up against each other. The NZRL premiership competition will take on extra meaning for the players and the ability for our tuakana tournament side to have a live match is awesome.\n\n“The sides have played previously with a break last year due to the touring English side, a game where NZ Māori dominated with a solid victory. I always look forward to these games and more importantly, the opportunity for our players that support our tuakana tournament to put on the Māori jersey.”\n\nThe NZRL Schools v Clubs match set for a 2pm kick off prior to the Residents game, is the first of its kind and will act as a key development pathway for New Zealand 18 players.\n\nThis inaugural fixture is set to stick as an annual event in which the NZRL Schools team will comprise of players actively playing in the NZRL National Secondary school competition and the NZRL Clubs team selected from District, Zone and National Youth programmes.\n\nUnfortunately, due to COVID-19 the National Secondary School Competition and NZRL Youth tournament were cancelled for 2020; however, players identified in the NZRL wider squad for the New Zealand Resident 18s back in February will make up the majority of the selections for this year.\n\nThe New Zealand Schools team will be comprised of identified players from the Auckland Rugby League Secondary Schools competition as well as those registered in full-time study.\n\nThe New Zealand Clubs team will consist of identified players who have competed in a meaningful club competition in 2020.\n\nUnfortunately, initial NZ 18s fixtures against England Academies and Fiji Schoolboys had to be called off due to COVID-19 border restrictions.\n\nNZRL GM of Football and High Performance, Motu Tony says; “This Schools v Clubs match will act as an important pathway going forward for our young and aspiring Kiwi talent, so it’s great to see this fixture come to light even despite the COVID setbacks.\n\n“We were disappointed the NZ18s fixtures had to be called off, but our talented 18 players are still able to get a run in what will hopefully develop into a staple calendar event for NZRL.\n\nThe NZRL Development U18s took on the Vodafone Warriors 18s to mark the final day of the CCL: Revera Talent Development Camp for 2020 at St Peters College in Cambridge.\n\nBig defensive efforts on display by both teams to kick off the match, but it was the Warriors that got first points on the board as centre Jeremiah Asi dives under the post off the back of a high ball. The Warriors wasted no time following up with back to back to tries to Carl Lolohea and Tea-Rani Woodman-Tuhoro making it 12 – 0 after ten minutes.\n\nNZRL 18s found some momentum after forcing a repeat set, a long ball to winger Jeremiah MarGraff put NZRL on the board with the score 12 – 4 at the end of the first quarter.\n\nWarriors hit straight back in the second quarter with a try down the right edge to winger Zyon Maiu’u. NZRL soon responded as Manaia Ngataki-Matthews set up Ethan Faitaua to cross for NZRL’s second, score 16 – 8.\n\nRawiri Matthews extended the lead for the Warriors but NZRL quickly hit back with what looked like a spectacular try in the corner but it was not to be as the touch judge called out, the score remains 20 – 8 at half time.\n\nNZRL start the second half was some big defensive efforts but it was the Warriors that managed to cross first taking the score to 24 – 8. Zyon Maiu’u then showed his speed down the left edge crossing over for his second bringing the score to 28 – 8.\n\nThe Warriors then extended their lead yet again off another impressive running set, shortly after Zyon Maiu’u steamrolled over for his third for the day making it 34 – 8 at the end of the third quarter, all momentum with the Warriors U18s.\n\nVaka Sikahele opened the scoring for the Warriors in the fourth quarter bumping off defenders to put it down under the sticks 38 – 8.\n\nNZRL Development squad then found some momentum through the middle after a great offload from Jareny Proctor-Harwood who set up a runaway try to Riley Pascoe, score now 38 – 12.\n\nSoon after Montel Peppard brushed off defenders to give speedster Matua Robinson a 50m run to the try line gifting NZRL their fourth try, however, the Warriors dot it down one last time before the siren making the full-time score 42 – 16.\n\nIn the end, the Vodafone Warriors 18s were too good for the NZRL Development 18s, however, players from both teams will be selected for the NZRL U18s wider squad set to be announced in the next three weeks.\n\nDue to the ongoing implications of the Covid-19 outbreak, New Zealand Rugby League regrets to advise that all NZRL run representative competitions and tournaments have been called off for the remainder of the year.\n\nCommunity and Club competitions and trainings are still currently postponed until May 2 with that date to be reviewed in due course.\n\nDue to the current uncertain revenue lines, these representative competitions would place too big of a financial burden on the Zones. International rugby league has also been cancelled for the foreseeable future, and NZRL has ceased all non-essential expenditure.\n\nGreg Peters, NZRL CEO, “We are extremely disappointed that these competitions will not happen in 2020, but unfortunately, it was a decision that had to be made for the financial longevity of our game.\n\n“Due to the extensive consequences of this pandemic across the code, we have had to make some significant short term sacrifices in order to see the game thrive long after this virus is contained.\n\n“The impact and influence rugby league has is felt widespread both on and off the field. Although unprecedented, this decision was made fully with the longevity of our game in mind and the important role it plays within our communities.”\n\nNZRL will provide a further update on club and community competitions in due course. Once lockdown restrictions are lifted, the focus will be on getting the grassroots game operating as quickly as possible.\n\nThe NZRL Development U18s took on the Vodafone Warriors 18s to mark the final day of the CCL: Revera Talent Development Camp for 2020 at St Peters College in Cambridge.\n\nBig defensive efforts on display by both teams to kick off the match, but it was the Warriors that got first points on the board as centre Jeremiah Asi dives under the post off the back of a high ball.

Cassius Cowley and New Zealand Captain Jaedon Wellington would put the team in front going into the second half 14 – 10.\n\nSamoa went into the sheds trailing by four, but complacency, a lack of discipline from the New Zealand team and pure passion from the Samoans lead them to take the win over the hosts in the end 26 – 20.\n\nThe French team who faced the New Zealand 18s earlier in the week, arrived ready to finish their tour of Aotearoa on a high, with only Auckland U19s standing in their way.\n\nWhile the first half was a grind – with France kicking a penalty on the siren to lead 14-12 at the break – the second stanza saw 38 combined points scored.\n\nA big second half saw Auckland U19 get past France U19 38-26 in their one-off representative clash.\n\nFresh off the back of their win against France on Thursday, the NZ18s were keen to finish their campaign undefeated, however, if the Toa Samoa 16s performance was anything to go by, this wasn’t going to be an easy task.\n\nBoth teams came out firing but it was NZ who capitalised on early possession to get first points on the board. That momentum, however, was short-lived as Samoa fired straight back with an overlap to the right as centre, Sam Taunga, went over for Samoa’s first points. Neither side was able to convert making the score four a piece after ten minutes\n\nA tackle in the air from NZ put Samoa in the lead as they took the two penalty points soon followed by a try to Vaiala Tamati off a clever cross-field kick extending their lead 12 – 4.\n\nNZ answered straight back as Semisi Sikei dived on a kick in goal to make it 12 – 8. Poor discipline from NZ gifted Samoa further field possession as hooker Jeremiah Schuster dived through the defensive line making it 18 – 8 at the break.\n\nThe Kiwis had no choice but to come out firing if they were to remain in the game, and that they did, NZ opened the second half with a try to Vaka Sikahele in corner to tighten the gap to 18 – 12. Kina Kepu then steam-rolled the Samoan defence to score a great solo try making it 18 – 16 with a kick to come. Sione Moala was having a less than ideal day with the boot missing another conversion; the Kiwis still trail by two.\n\nThe NZ forward pack were proving hard to handle breaking the Samoan defensive line two more times, yet handling errors by the Kiwis cost back to back try opportunities. NZ then caught Samoa napping and finally capitalised on their possession as Jordan Coleman scored under the posts making it 22 – 18.\n\nSamoa gained momentum off poor discipline from the Kiwis yet a try went begging as Samoa’s chasers were caught offside. NZ went straight back on the attack as William Fakatoumafi skillfully caught a highball and offloaded to winger Semisi Sikei who extended the Kiwis’ lead to 26 – 18.\n\nFakatoumafi then defused Samoa’s last play option catching yet another high ball to run 100m untouched adding an extra four for NZ, Moala was unable to convert keeping the score 30 – 18. Feao Tongia crossed for the Kiwis eighth, and final try making it 36 – 18 at full time.\n\nAn impressive second-half performance by the Kiwis concluded an entertaining day of footy at Auckland’s Pulman Park. Congratulations to all involved.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NZLeague/videos/509277579912559/\n\nA passionate rendition of Te Iwi Kiwi from the NZ18s set the bar for what would be a tough battle between two high-quality sides. France U19s were full of confidence fresh off two wins against Waikato and Canterbury, and the NZ 18s were eager to kick off their 2019 campaign with a win – this game was set to be a good one.\n\nNine minutes into the match, Canterbury prop Caius Faatili, rolled over for New Zealand’s first try, impressively the Canterbury Bulls star is also set to take the field at the NZRL Premiership final on Saturday against Akarana.\n\nEighteen minutes in France scored their first points as Thomas Soler showed good pace to run away with an intercept try. NZ hit back shortly after as Jonah Palota-Kopa dived on a grubber from Coleman to make it 10 – 4. NZ continued its dominance throughout the rest of the half with Caius rolling over for his second in the 27th minute soon followed by back to back tries to Jordan Coleman, Taniela Otukolo and Semisi Tapa. NZ’s attack proving too much for France with six tries to one during the first forty, half time score: 32 – 4.\n\nNew Zealand continued to dominate on attack as Feao Tongia opened the second half scoring soon followed by a try to Caleb Pese to make it 44 – 4. However, any thoughts of it being a one-sided match were quickly put to bed as France mounted an impressive comeback. The French starved NZ of possession for most of the second half, although at times made easy by the NZ’s own handling errors, France showed pace and attacking smarts to score 22 unanswered points in the second forty, with tries to Thomas Lacans, Jason Goffin, Matthew Cozza and Valentin Zafra.\n\n44 – 26 marked the full-time score as NZ18s came away with the win in what was an entertaining but tough battle between the two sides. Both teams head to Auckland’s Pulman Park on Sunday as the French set to take on Auckland U19s while the NZ 18s prepare for their clash against TOA Samoa.\n\nNew Zealand Rugby League is pleased to announce a series of international fixtures that will see our brightest future league talent on display from up and down the country.\n\nThe NZ Resident 16s and 18s are set to take on TOA Samoa 16s and 18s at Auckland’s Pulman Park on Sunday 6th October, while the NZ Resident 18s will also come up against France’s U19s on Thursday, October 3rd at International Stadium, Rotorua.\n\nAs well as the NZ Residents 18s fixture, French Rugby League will embark on a historic tour of New Zealand facing the South Island 20s, Waikato 20s and Auckland 19s.\n\nFull list of fixtures in date order (all times are NZT):\n\nFriday 27 September 2019 – Nga Puna Wai, Christchurch\n\nCanterbury Invitation XIII vs. France U19s; 5pm kick off\n\nMonday 30 September 2019 – Ngaruawahia, Waikato\n\nWaikato 20s vs. France U19s; 4pm kick off\n\nThursday 3 October 2019 – International Stadium, Rotorua\n\nNew Zealand Resident 18s vs. France U19s; 6:30 kick off\n\nSunday 6 October 2019 – Pulman Park, Auckland\n\nNew Zealand Resident 16s vs. TOA 16s; 10:30am\n\nAuckland 19s vs. France U19s; 12:15pm\n\nNew Zealand Resident 18s vs. TOA 18s; 2:00pm\n\nNew Zealand Rugby League is pleased to announce the following successful players have been selected to represent the New Zealand Resident 16s and 18s teams for 2019.\n\nNew Zealand Resident 16s:\n\nName Club District Zone Team Keano KINI Marist Auckland Akarana Zyon MAIU’U Te Atatu Auckland Akarana Stanley IONGI Marist Auckland Auckland Heneli LUANI Pakuranga Auckland Counties Manukau Sione VAIHU Waitemata Auckland Auckland Filipo WHITEHOUSE-OPETAIA TOVIO Waitemata Auckland Auckland Ali LEIATAUA Pakuranga Auckland Counties Manukau Francis MANULELUA Papatoetoe Auckland Counties Manukau Ben PENI Papatoetoe Auckland Counties Manukau Carlos TARAWHITI Pakuranga Auckland Counties Manukau Arama KITE Manukura Manawatu Mid Central Fatiauma MOEAHU LEOTA Waitara Taranaki Mid Central Tea-Rani WOODMAN TUHORO Takahiwai Northland Northland Ethan FAITAUA Linwood Canterbury Southern Felix FA’ATILI Hornby Canterbury Southern Jaedon WELLINGTON Hornby Canterbury Southern Uriah TULI Linwood Canterbury Southern Cassius COWLEY Pikiao Bay of Plenty Upper Central Manaia NGATAKI-MATTHEWS Turangawaewae Waikato Upper Central\n\nHead Coach: Bejay Hewitt (Akarana)\n\nAssistant Coaches: Chris Langley, Eugene Davis (Upper Central)\n\nManager: Junie Shelford (Northland)\n\nTrainers: Sean Witanga (Counties Manukau), Iripa Rangi (Vodafone Warriors)\n\nPhysio: Quentin Hokianga (Vodafone Warriors)\n\nWellbeing Support: Te Iwi Ngaro Wairau (Southern)\n\nNew Zealand Resident 18s:\n\nName Club District Zone Team Caleb PESE Ellerslie Auckland Akarana Jyris GLAMUZINA Ellerslie Auckland Akarana Lani GRAHAM-TAUFA Marist Auckland Akarana Moana GRAHAM-TAUFA Marist Auckland Akarana Temple KALEPO Richmond Auckland Akarana Jonah PALOTA-KOPA Richmond Auckland Akarana Luani Naufahu WHYTE Marist Auckland Akarana Eteru ROPETI Marist Auckland Auckland William FAKATOUMAFI Otahuhu Auckland Counties Manukau Otukinekina KEPU Manurewa Auckland Counties Manukau Peesi Valingi KEPU Manurewa Auckland Counties Manukau Sione MOALA Manurewa Auckland Counties Manukau Taniela OTUKOLO Otahuhu Auckland Counties Manukau Semisi SIKEI Otahuhu Auckland Counties Manukau Semisi TAPA Otahuhu Auckland Counties Manukau Feao TONGIA Otahuhu Auckland Counties Manukau Brooklyn HEREWINI Whanganui Manawatu Mid Central Tyson CHASE Kia Ora Manawatu Mid Central Jordan COLEMAN Hornby Canterbury Southern Caius FA’ATILI Hornby Canterbury Southern Tukimihia SIMPKINS Pikiao Bay of Plenty Upper Central Dallas MCEWAN Randwick Wellington Wellington\n\nHead Coach: Tusa Lafaele (Counties Manukau)\n\nAssistant Coaches: Daniel McEwan (Wellington) and Cody Walker (Akarana)\n\nManager: Tania Harris (Counties Manukau)\n\nTrainers: Lee Paru (Southern) and Jasen McCarthy (Akarana)\n\nPhysio: Allan Horn (Counties Manukau)\n\nWellbeing Support: Te Iwi Ngaro Wairau (Southern)\n\nNZRL CEO, Greg Peters, says these fixtures are a teaser of the international rugby league to come.\n\n“What’s really exciting about these matches is that we get a glimpse into the future of New Zealand Rugby League. These National Teams provide a platform for players to springboard their future opportunities in the game and are an essential part of the NZ pathway.\n\n“The fixtures are also a display of the impressive domestic talent developed through our Clubs, Districts and Zones and having our future Kiwis come up against quality competition such as TOA Samoa and France will be exciting to see.”\n\nGeoff Brown, Rugby League Samoa Executive said: “We are thankful for the opportunity to come up against the NZ Residents, and at the same time, continue to strengthen our international relationships as these fixtures are vital to the development of Samoan rugby league.\n\n“To play for your country is the ultimate goal and we’re always working to provide elite pathways for our young players to achieve this at a range of age levels. Thanks to New Zealand Rugby League for their ongoing support, we look forward to the upcoming clashes.”\n\nMarc Palanques, Executive Chairman Federation Français Rugby a XIII said: “We are looking forward to this historic U19’s tour of New Zealand with a distinct vision of preparing a competitive squad capable of mixing it with the world’s best in the future.\n\n“The current rep cycle means we are preparing for a World Cup every four years and this is our first step in giving our players the experience they need to compete against the world’s best players. The four-match program we have is ambitious while providing a wonderful mixture of games and community engagements for our young players.\n\n“Mixing sport with the local culture and experiencing their first haka, will be a life-changing experience and we hope to be able to reciprocate this with the NZRL when they visit next. A special word of thanks to our rugby league hosts in the South Island; Canterbury Rugby League and the North Island; Waikato Rugby League, Auckland Rugby League and New Zealand Residents.”\n\nDetails on how to view each fixture will be released in due course.\n\nImage – Photosport\n\nAfter a highly successful 2020 Talent Development Programme held in Cambridge last month, New Zealand Rugby League wishes to announce and congratulate those players who have been selected in the New Zealand Resident 16s and 18s, 26-man squads.\n\n80 of the best 16s and 18s players in the country were put through their paces both on and off the field at the three-day camp, with everything they learnt culminating in two trial matches on the final day. The talent on display left selectors with some difficult decisions to make as players battled it out in hopes of catching the coaches’ eyes.\n\nThese squads will assemble on the first Monday of the school holidays, 15 April and 8 July, with a game in October to be announced in the coming months.\n\nNew Zealand Resident 16s Wider Squad 2020\n\nAKARANA; Benaiah Ioelu, Zion Maiu’u, Paaua Papuni-Abbott: AUCKLAND; Nathaniel Tangimataiti, Nathaniel Cama, Stanley Iongi, Heneli Luani, Sione Vaihu, Filipo Whitehouse-Opetaia Tovio, Sione Fotuaika: COUNTIES MANUKAU; Ali Leiataua, Ben Peni, Carlos Tarawhiti, Salesi Ataata, Francis Manulelua.

He has immense passion towards where he wants to see the black and white jersey and this is a real quality of his,”\n\n“Off the back of his brilliant season in club land, he was in a good position to play his best footy for the Kiwis and that’s exactly what he did. His experience has been invaluable in mentoring younger players to step up into international rugby league,” Maguire says.\n\nThe powerhouse prop capped off his 2018 NRL season with his second NRL premiership win, a title he was able to share with Kiwis teammate Joseph Manu (finalist for Kiwis Rookie of the Year).\n\nIn one of the biggest years to date for women’s rugby league, Honey Hireme was hard to go past when it came to crowning the Kiwi Ferns Player of the Year, an award she won back in 2012. As co-captain of the Kiwi Ferns alongside veteran teammate Laura Mariu, she crossed the ditch to play for the St George Illawarra Dragons in the inaugural NRL Women’s Premiership, an experience she says has benefitted her game.\n\n“The addition of this year’s NRL competition was great for the women’s game. The fact that we could all come together in Kiwi Ferns camp following four weeks of competing in the elite space, was hugely beneficial when it came to pulling on the black and white jersey against the Jillaroos,”\n\n“The more we can play at the top level, the better our game gets. I’m grateful for receiving this award but would also like to recognise the efforts of the other finalists (Kimiora Nati and Aieshaleigh Smalley) and our Kiwi Ferns teammates, my family for their undying support, management and coaching staff,” she says.\n\nThe Kiwis Rookie of the Year award was picked up by Kiwi #810 Ken Maumalo, a player who earnt his Kiwis call-up in June at Mile High Stadium before going on to play in all five 2018 Kiwis Test matches, scoring four tries. His impressive season with the Warriors and Kiwis attracted high praises from coach Michael Maguire and rightfully so, given he amassed 15 tackle breaks and 801 run metres over the three Tests he played against England.\n\n“Both Ken and Jared are two players that are hungry for the Kiwis jersey to reach new heights and that’s pleasing,”\n\n“It has been really enjoyable coaching Ken, the more he plays, the more he grows so I look forward to seeing what he does next year,” Maguire says.\n\nJoining Maumalo in playing her first Test at international level, Onjeurlina Leiataua has been rewarded for her break out season with the Warriors women’s team, and the stellar part she played in the Kiwi Ferns narrow loss against the Jillaroos at Mt Smart Stadium this year. These achievements saw her pick up Kiwi Ferns Rookie of the Year.\n\nPromising youngster, Isaiah Papali’i wins Junior Player of the Year for the second consecutive year, having been awarded Warriors Rookie of the Year and receiving his Kiwis debut in England after leading the Junior Kiwis in their match-up against the Junior Kangaroos in October.\n\nThis year’s award winners showcase players and match officials performing at the pinnacle of rugby league, as well as community representatives and volunteers who prove to be the backbone of grassroots rugby league in New Zealand.\n\nNew Zealand Rugby League wishes to congratulate the award winners from all 13 categories below:\n\nPirtek Female Volunteer – Karen Gibbons Karen Gibbons (Akarana, Auckland)\n\nPirtek Male Volunteer – Lawrence Erihe (Mid Central, Manawatu)\n\nGrassroots Club of the Year – South Pacific Raiders (Southern, Otago)\n\nDomestic Coach of the Year – Keith Hanley (Akarana, Auckland)\n\nMatch Official of the Year – Paki Parkinson (Upper Central, Bay of Plenty)\n\nNZ 16s Player of the Year – Sione Moala (Counties Manukau, Auckland)\n\nNZ 18s Player of the Year – Tyler Slade (NZ Warriors)\n\nDomestic Premier Player of the Year – Francis Leger (Akarana, Auckland)\n\nKiwi Fern Rookie of the Year – Onjeurlina Leiataua (NZ Warriors)\n\nKiwis Rookie of the Year – Ken Maumalo (NZ Warriors)\n\nKiwis Fern Player of the Year – Honey Hireme (St George Illawarra Dragons)\n\nKiwis Player of the Year – Jared Waerea-Hargreaves (Sydney Roosters)\n\nA passionate New Zealand Resident 18s haka and Toa Samoa U18s Siva Tau set the tone for what was a hefty battle up front and it was the New Zealand Resident 18s who capitalized off the first set, Paul Turner crossing the line for the first try.\n\nOnly minutes later in front of a packed out crowd at Pulman Park, 2017 New Zealand 16s Player of the Year Christian Tuipulotu put his two cents in putting four more points on the board for the NZ Resident 18s, score 8-0.\n\nWhen looking at the scoreboard, it may have seemed one sided after the first 15 minutes but the Samoans certainly brought the mongrel pushing the Kiwis back to their own line on several occasions but the black and white defence was too strong.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, an intercept from Emmanuel Tuimavave-Gerrard saw the Samoans hard work unravel as they were once again forced back to their own 10 metre mark.\n\nThen Kakoi Togoiu came off the bench and his impact was certainly made known. Much like his teammates in the Toa Samoa U18s forward pack, facing his tackles was not too dissimilar to coming up against a brick wall – bone tingling.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, Samoa forced more and more mistakes from the home side, their defence getting stronger as halftime loomed.\n\nIn the black and white jersey, Paul Turner had extra incentive to impress with Junior Kiwis Coach, Ezra Howe watching on. After today’s match where he played for the NZ Resident 18s, Turner will play for the Junior Kiwis in their clash against the Junior Kangaroos next Saturday, the first game of the Trans-Tasman Triple-Header at 3.05pm at Mt Smart.\n\nBoth teams were kept scoreless in the final 20 minutes of the first half hitting the sheds with the score at 8-0.\n\nA very composed Toa Samoa U18s side looked promising to score the first four points of the second half but a classy NZ defence took him into touch five metres out from the line. But, the Samoans fought their way back to the same spot, their mounting pressure forcing an uncharacteristic dropped ball from NZ fullback Kayal Iro.\n\nOn the back of the hard yards done by the Samoans forward pack, the boys in blue put their first points on the board with Devontai Seumanutafa crashing through the NZ Resident 18s defence, score 8-4 following an unsuccessful conversion.\n\nA second try only minutes later looked imminent but a double movement called for a line drop out instead.\n\nOn the back of a few mistakes, NZ came up with the ball in hand, Temple Kalepo seeing space to score under the posts. 12-4 turned into 14-4 when converted by Emmanuel Tuimavave-Gerrard. Paul Turner then joined in on the fun scoring his second try of the day, once again converted by Tuimavave-Gerrard taking the score to 20-4.\n\nErrors plagued both sides in the final 15 minutes bringing countless turnovers.\n\nThen, just what the Toa Samoa U18s were hoping for, a cross field kick sent fullback Jonaiah Lualua across the chalk, the score remaining 20-8 following an unsuccessful conversion.\n\nHowever, their last minute efforts weren’t enough to overtake the NZ Resident 18s who put another four points on the board just before the final whistle, the NZ Resident 18s triumphant with the final score reading 24-8.\n\nMVP – Paul Turner\n\nNZ Resident 18s 24 (Christian Tuipulotu, Emmanuel Tuimavave-Gerrard, Paul Turner 2, Temple Kalepo tries; Emmanuel Tuimavave-Gerrard 2 goals) Toa Samoa U18s 8 (Jonaiah Lualua & Devontai Seumanutafa tries)\n\nFollowing trials on the weekend, the New Zealand Resident 18s have been named to take on the TOA Samoa U18s on 6 October at Pulman Park.\n\nThe 18-strong team includes two players from last year’s New Zealand 18s team who took on the Australian Schoolboys, Tyler Slade and Paul Turner, who have also been named in the 2018 Junior Kiwis wider squad for the Trans-Tasman Triple-Header on 13 October. Emmanuel Tuimavave-Gerrard and Kayal Iro are also eligible again having played in the NZ Select 18s side which took on the Australian Schoolboys too.\n\nMany of the players have progressed through the New Zealand Rugby League age-group pathways with Christian Tuipulotu having captained the New Zealand 16s team to victory against the New Zealand Maori 17s last year, alongside his vice-captain Temple Kalepo and teammate Caleb Pese.\n\nBrooklyn Herewini’s naming in the 2018 New Zealand Resident 18s side serves as a reward for his fantastic National Talent Development Programme campaign being named as MVP in March this year. He also represented Manukura School earlier this month staging outstanding performances at the National Secondary Schools Tournament.\n\nNew Zealand Resident 18s v TOA Samoa U18s\n\nSaturday 6 October, 12pm kick off\n\nPulman Park, Auckland\n\nNumber 1 field\n\nLive streamed through NZRL Facebook page\n\nName Amateur Club* Zone* Aiden Aue Mt.
