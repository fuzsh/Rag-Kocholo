Conceived by Citroën Vice-President Pierre Boulanger to help motorise the large number of farmers still using horses and carts in 1930s France, the 2CV has a combination of innovative engineering and utilitarian, straightforward metal bodywork — initially corrugated for added strength without added weight. The 2CV featured low cost; simplicity of overall maintenance; an easily serviced air-cooled engine (originally offering 9 hp); low fuel consumption; and an extremely long-travel suspension offering a soft ride and light off-road capability. Often called \"an umbrella on wheels\", the fixed-profile convertible bodywork featured a full-width, canvas, roll-back sunroof, which accommodated oversized loads and until 1955 reached almost to the car's rear bumper. Notably, Michelin introduced and first commercialized the radial tyre with the introduction of the 2CV. Manufactured in France between 1948 and 1988 (and in Portugal from 1988 to 1990), more than 3.8 million 2CVs were produced, along with over 1.2 million small 2CV-based delivery vans known as fourgonnettes. Citroën ultimately offered several mechanically identical variants including the Ami (over 1.8 million); the Dyane (over 1.4 million); the Acadiane (over 250,000); and the Mehari (over 140,000). In total, Citroën manufactured almost 9 million 2CVs and variants. The purchase price of the 2CV was low relative to its competition. In West Germany during the 1960s, for example, it cost about half as much as a Volkswagen Beetle. From the mid-1950s economy car competition had increased – internationally in the form of the 1957 Fiat 500 and 1955 Fiat 600, and 1959 Austin Mini. By 1952, Germany produced a price competitive car – the Messerschmitt KR175, followed in 1955 by the Isetta – these were microcars, not complete four-door cars like the 2CV. On the French home market, from 1961, the small Simca 1000 using licensed Fiat technology, and the larger Renault 4 hatchback had become available. The R4 was the biggest threat to the 2CV, eventually outselling it. A 1953 technical review in Autocar described \"the extraordinary ingenuity of this design, which is undoubtedly the most original since the Model T Ford\". In 2011, The Globe and Mail called it a \"car like no other\". The motoring writer L. J. K. Setright described the 2CV as \"the most intelligent application of minimalism ever to succeed as a car\", and a car of \"remorseless rationality\".\n\nSee West Germany and Citroën 2CV\n\nCity-state\n\nA city-state is a sovereign state, also described as a type of small independent country, that usually consists of a single city and its dependent territories.\n\nSee West Germany and City-state\n\nCivil defense\n\nCivil defense or civil protection is an effort to protect the citizens of a state (generally non-combatants) from military attacks and natural disasters.\n\nSee West Germany and Civil defense\n\nClaudia Roth\n\nClaudia Benedikta Roth (born 15 May 1955 in Ulm) is a German Green Party politician.\n\nSee West Germany and Claudia Roth\n\nClaudia Schiffer\n\nClaudia Maria Schiffer (born 25 August 1970) is a German model, actress and fashion designer.\n\nSee West Germany and Claudia Schiffer\n\nClaus von Stauffenberg\n\nClaus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (15 November 1907 – 21 July 1944) was a German army officer and member of the Bavarian noble family von Stauffenberg, who was one of the leading members of the failed 20 July plot of 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler and remove the Nazi Party from power.\n\nSee West Germany and Claus von Stauffenberg\n\nCohabitation\n\nCohabitation is an arrangement where two people who are not married live together.\n\nSee West Germany and Cohabitation\n\nCold War\n\nThe Cold War was a state of geopolitical tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others).\n\nSee West Germany and Cold War\n\nCold War espionage\n\nCold War espionage describes the intelligence gathering activities during the Cold War (circa 1947-1991) between the Western allies (chief US, UK and NATO) and the Eastern Bloc (The Soviet Union and aligned countries of Warsaw Pact).\n\nSee West Germany and Cold War espionage\n\nColin Powell\n\nColin Luther Powell (born April 5, 1937) is an American statesman and a retired four-star general in the United States Army.\n\nSee West Germany and Colin Powell\n\nCologne\n\nCologne (Köln,, Kölle) is the largest city in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth most populated city in Germany (after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich).\n\nSee West Germany and Cologne\n\nColor television\n\nColor/Colour television is a television transmission technology that includes information on the color of the picture, so the video image can be displayed in color on the television set.\n\nSee West Germany and Color television\n\nCombined oral contraceptive pill\n\nThe combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), often referred to as the birth control pill or colloquially as \"the pill\", is a type of birth control that is designed to be taken orally by women.\n\nSee West Germany and Combined oral contraceptive pill\n\nCommander-in-chief\n\nA commander-in-chief, also sometimes called supreme commander, or chief commander, is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces.\n\nSee West Germany and Commander-in-chief\n\nCommunist Party of Germany\n\nThe Communist Party of Germany (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) was a major political party in Germany between 1918 and 1933, and a minor party in West Germany in the postwar period until it was banned in 1956.\n\nSee West Germany and Communist Party of Germany\n\nConscription\n\nConscription, sometimes called the draft, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service.\n\nSee West Germany and Conscription\n\nConstitution of East Germany\n\nThe German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded in 1949 and was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990.\n\nSee West Germany and Constitution of East Germany\n\nConstructive vote of no confidence\n\nThe constructive vote of no confidence (in German: konstruktives Misstrauensvotum, in Spanish: moción de censura constructiva) is a variation on the motion of no confidence that allows a parliament to withdraw confidence from a head of government only if there is a positive majority for a prospective successor.\n\nSee West Germany and Constructive vote of no confidence\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nThe Council of Europe (CoE;

They also form a significant diaspora, with Greek communities established around the world.. Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, but the Greek people have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas, where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age.. Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula, the western coast of Asia Minor, the Black Sea coast, Cappadocia in central Anatolia, Egypt, the Balkans, Cyprus, and Constantinople. Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization. The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens, Thessalonica, Alexandria, Smyrna, and Constantinople at various periods. Most ethnic Greeks live nowadays within the borders of the modern Greek state and Cyprus. The Greek genocide and population exchange between Greece and Turkey nearly ended the three millennia-old Greek presence in Asia Minor. Other longstanding Greek populations can be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and southern Russia and Ukraine and in the Greek diaspora communities in a number of other countries. Today, most Greeks are officially registered as members of the Greek Orthodox Church.CIA World Factbook on Greece: Greek Orthodox 98%, Greek Muslim 1.3%, other 0.7%.
