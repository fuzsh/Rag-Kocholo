        "text": "I’m only allowed 5 stars??? My first thought was wow, this is cool. Then I kept going and I couldn’t have ever imagined it would be that incredible. More and more impressive the further I walked. All the buildings and their shops within. The Blacksmith’s shop with demonstrations was neat, and was right up my alley, as were all the sword and knife shops. The dress shops were full of every beautiful material you could imagine. I am a slow shopper and entered many interesting shops, all with varied items of very high quality and reasonable prices. The coin stamper was very cool, it was made from the same design as a French Head Chopping machine, the word for it, I know how to say, but unfortunately can’t spell. Plenty of good food shops and beverages throughout the whole place. The people were all so wonderful. We drove from the Appleton area and only had a few hours before we had to return. I will definitely be coming back, so I can explore at least half more of that wonderful place. If you mosey around and shop and eat and watch a few performances, it will probably take you at least two visits to enjoy the whole grounds. What wonderful people you have there. So professional and dedicated. Thank you so much for the outstanding experience. Next time I will bring more people and stay longer. Thank you all! And see you again soon! – Harry F."
