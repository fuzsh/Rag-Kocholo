Adult insects of the Order Lepidoptera can be characterised by the presence of scales on the wings and other external parts of the insect. The name of the order reflects this, with 'lepido' meaning scaly, and 'ptera' referring to wings. The mouthparts of adults (when present) are generally tubular, and are adapted for taking in liquids such as the nectar from flowers. Adults usually have two pairs of wings. Within the Sydney region, there are several hundred species of lepidopterans and about 100 of these are butterflies.

A pupal stage is present between the larval and adult stages. This stage is sometimes protected from predators and parasites by a cocoon, or by a shelter built by the larva, or by being underground. Many butterfly pupae rely on being camouflaged to avoid being eaten.

The Order Lepidoptera is extremely diverse, with over 10 000 Australian species described and an additional 10 000 undescribed species. It is estimated that many more are yet to be recognised, and the total number of Australian species may be as high as 30 000.

Like all insects, butterflies and moths go through metamorphosis (that is, they look different at different stages of their life cycle). During the caterpillar stage they spend their time feeding mostly on plants, to the annoyance of some gardeners. Adult moths and butterflies spend their short lives searching for a mate and feeding on nectar from flowers. They have no jaws, but feed via a tube-like tongue, known as a proboscis. Some adults don't even feed at all and rely on the energy they consumed as caterpillars.

In general, moths are named according to the habits of their caterpillars, whereas butterflies are named after the characteristics of the adults.
