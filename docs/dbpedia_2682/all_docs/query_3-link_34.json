        "text": "Mouthparts of Glossata and Evolution of the Proboscis\n\nThe great majority of adult Glossata possess a coilable proboscis ( ), which evolved only once, thus representing an autapomorphy of this clade. Adult Glossata take up only liquid food and achieve this exclusively by way of the food tube of the proboscis, which is composed of the medially concave and interlocked galeae. The origin of the proboscis and the transition to feeding on liquids resulted in the reinforcement of the sucking pump in the head and a reduction of all major constituents of the mouthparts, except the galeae and the labial palps (136). The other components of the mouthparts play no role in food uptake but may have sensory function during foraging.\n\nIn species with a functional proboscis, the labrum forms a small plate over the basal proboscis joint, where bristles of the pilifers contact the basal galeal joint; these sensory bristles probably detect proboscis movements (53, 84, 87). The mandibles are reduced and nonfunctional. The basal maxillary sclerites—the stipes and the cardo—form a tubular component from which the coilable galea and the maxillary palp emerge ( ); a lacinia is absent (98).\n\nThe maxillary palps are composed of five segments in the plesiomorphic condition, but are short and reduced in the number of segments in most species of Ditrysia (98). The biological role of the maxillary palps remains unclear despite the presence of sensilla in various lineages (52, 53, 57). In the females of the yucca moth, Tegeticula and Parategeticula (Prodoxidae), the second segment of the maxillary palpus is extended into a long coilable tentacle that is used to collect pollen and to actively pollinate Yucca flowers (37, 119). The tentacles are as long as the proboscis and are similarly equipped with muscles and sensilla. This extraordinary and novel organ probably evolved as an adaptation to the mutualistic pollination behavior of female yucca moths (120).\n\nThe labial palps are composed of two to three segments (98). They extend from the prementum sclerite and may form prominent structures in front of the head ( ). They are equipped with scales, bristles, and various sensilla partly arranged in an apical pit organ (52, 53, 57, 98). The sensilla of the pit organ are sensitive to carbon dioxide (25, 68, 78, 106). They play an important role in the nectarforaging behavior of sphingid moths (139). In Manduca sexta (Sphingidae) the labial pit organ detects minute changes in concentration of carbon dioxide, which serves as a distant olfactory attractant to freshly blossomed flowers (65) and as a predictor of nectar volumes before actual flower probing (67).\n\nThe plesiomorphic condition of the proboscis occurs in the representatives of the family Eriocraniidae, which use their short and simply composed proboscises to drink from water droplets and sap seeping from injured leaves (93, 95). Originating from the tubular stipes, the coilable galeae are linked to each other by pointed cuticular structures on the dorsal and ventral sides of the median food canal. The outer surface of each galea bears microtrichia, few uniporous sensilla basiconica, and bristleshaped aporous sensilla trichodea. The galeal lumen contains a nerve, a trachea, and an extrinsic muscle that originates on the stipes; however, no intrinsic galeal musculature extends to the tip (87, 88, 93).\n\nDerived from the plesiomorphic condition, the proboscis of Myoglossata is characterized by functionally specialized dorsal and ventral linking structures, three morphological types of sensilla, and additional intrinsic galeal muscles (87, 88, 101). The principal composition is similar in Myoglossata, except for the species-poor family Neopseustidae, in which each galea forms a functionally closed food tube. The short double-tube proboscis is held together by special scales that extend from the ventral side of each galea. The galeal lumen contains a slender intrinsic galeal muscle in addition to the basal extrinsic muscle (88, 100). Three types of proboscis sensilla are present, including sensilla styloconica (56, 57), which was previously regarded to be restricted to the nectar-feeding taxa (87). The food source of the neopseustid moths is still unknown.\n\nThe proboscis of the Eulepidoptera exhibits features that probably evolved in context with flower visiting: considerable length, complexly composed galeal walls, a fluid-tight food tube with a special tip region, and numerous intrinsic galeal muscles ( , ) (87, 88). The proboscises of nectar-feeding species display amazing lengths, which range between 3.5 and 49.9 mm in butterflies (104) and between 2.5 and 280 mm in sphingid moths (4, 109). In butterflies the length normally corresponds to about 43–93% of the body length (34, 104, 118). In the family Sphingidae the body mass is positively correlated with proboscis length (2). Disproportionately long proboscises exceeding the body length occur in some species of the Hesperiidae, Riodinidae, and Sphingidae families. The current record holder among true butterflies is Eurybia lycisca (Riodinidae), with a 49.9-mm-long proboscis, about twice as long as its body (104). The longest proboscis yet encountered in any flower-visiting animal belongs to the Neotropical hawk moth, Amphimoea walkeri, and measures 280 mm (4).\n\nThe proboscises of nonfeeding adult Lepidoptera are generally more or less reduced in length and structural complexity (130), but detailed studies are lacking. Reduced proboscises are characteristic of the representatives of the superfamilies Hepialoidea, Tineoidea, Cossoidea, and Lasiocampoidea. Furthermore, rudimentary proboscises are occasionally encountered in species of other taxa, such as the Sesioidea, Pyralidoidea, Bombycoidea, Noctuoidea, and Geometrioidea (98, 130). All true butterflies, the Papilionoidea, possess a fully functional suctorial proboscis.\n\nThe composition of the galeal wall ensures the elasticity for coiling and uncoiling without deformation of the food tube. The outer galeal wall is composed of darkened cuticle rings that lie embedded in the lighter-hued cuticle, giving the proboscis an annulated appearance (73, 82, 118). The dark cuticle is probably hard exocuticle, whereas the light cuticle is interpreted to consist of flexible mesocuticle and endocuticle. Resilin is found in particular areas of the proboscis wall (73). In many species, distinct ribs, visible on the convex outer surface, may have cuticular spines, hair-like cuticular processes, or scales (82, 87, 118, 134). The concave median surface that forms the food tube is composed of smooth plates that may be vertically fluted (73, 87, 118).\n\nThe galeae are held together by rows of interlocking cuticular processes, termed legulae, that exhibit different shapes on the dorsal and ventral sides of the food canal ( ) (44, 73, 87). The dorsal linkage consists of flat horizontally extending lancet-shaped plates. They overlap those of the opposite galea to form the roof of the food tube. Their principal variation in Glossata concerns the number of rows (87). Single-celled glands are situated in the galeal epidermis and empty toward the dorsal legulae; their secretion serves to lubricate and seal the dorsal linkage in butterflies (44). Two rows of ventral legulae are plesiomorphic in Eulepidoptera; in certain lineages of Ditrysia the lower legulae are modified into hooks that interlock with their counterparts, like a zipper ( ), providing firmness to the proboscis linkage (87).\n\nDorsal and ventral linking structures seal and firmly link the food tube; they are regarded as a functional precondition for a suctorial proboscis that takes up fluid along a pressure gradient (28). The fluid-tight food tube necessitates a specialized region for fluid intake. Near the tip, the dorsal legulae are particularly elongate and between them are drinking slits, which permit the uptake of fluids ( ). This region comprises 5–20% of the proboscis length in butterflies (92, 118, 123). Nymphalid butterflies and probably all other Macrolepidoptera assemble their proboscises after emerging from the pupal stage, because the galeae develop separately from each other. This behavioral process renders the proboscis functional and has to occur immediately after eclosion (83).\n\nThe sensory equipment of the proboscis was comprehensively reviewed by Faucheux (53). The sensilla trichodea or sensilla chaetica have an aporous sensory bristle that extends from a collared socket. They occur only on the external surface of the proboscis and become shorter and more scattered toward the tip; in most butterflies they are longer on the ventral side of the proboscis than on the dorsal side (84, 118). On the basis of ultrastructural studies, these sensilla are regarded as mechanosensitive (5, 84). They might provide information on the width and depth of tubular flowers during probing (84). Flower-handling efficiency relies heavily on mechanosensory input, as shown for species of sphingid moths (66). Bristle-shaped sensilla probably also provide tactile information concerning the correct resting position of the proboscis, as scanning electron micrographs confirm that they contact the surface of the adjacent coil (82).\n\nThe sensilla basiconica of the external proboscis surface are arranged in irregular rows, whereas in the food canal they form a single row (52, 75, 84, 87). They consist of a short dome-shaped socket and sensory cone that may be elongate or short, blunt or sharply tipped; sometimes it barely extends beyond the surface sculpture of the galeal wall (3, 5, 52, 53, 84, 118, 123, 131, 141). A terminal pore may be present or absent; in exceptional cases the cone is multiporous (53). Deduced from their ultrastructure, these sensilla are regarded as chemo- and/or mechanoreceptive (84, 135, 141). In electrophysiological tests, the sensilla of the food canal respond to sucrose solutions (75) and may provide information on flow rates by means of gustatory cues received from the imbibed fluid (84). In addition, sensilla ampullacea occur near the proboscis tip in the Sphingidae (53).\n\nThe sensilla styloconica are composed of a variously shaped stylus and a shorter terminal sensory cone ( ). Sensilla styloconica are regarded to be derived from sensilla basiconica (3, 53, 131) and do not occur in nonglossatan Lepidoptera (87). They are arranged in one to three regular rows in the distal half of the proboscis and are restricted to the tip region, where the drinking slits occur in butterflies (84, 87, 118, 123, 131) and in the noctuid moth Heliothis virescens (105). Their number may range from 7 to 144 per galea and their length from 10 to 237 μm in butterflies (53, 118, 123). An astounding diversity of sensilla styloconica lengths and shapes are found in taxa of the true butterflies (the Papilionoidea) and the families Noctuidae, Geometridae, and Pyralidae. Cross-sections reveal the stylus to be either smooth and ellipsoid or longitudinally ribbed and star-shaped; some species exhibit terminal spines around the sensory cone, whereas in others the ribs are serrate or very short and practically absent (52, 53, 84, 87, 92, 105, 118, 123, 131, 141). In species of the Sphingidae the short sensilla styloconica are located in pits and never extend beyond the surface of the proboscis (53). Comparative morphological studies suggest that a stylus with cuticular ridges is the plesiomorphic condition in Glossata (57, 87). Derived sensilla shapes evolved in adaptive context with derived feeding habits (32, 92, 110). The internal ultrastructural composition is similar in all examined taxa despite the variety of external shapes. The sensory cone is uniporous; in some species wall pores were also detected. Each sensillum contains three to four receptor cells with dendrites extending to the terminal pore. One dendrite ends with a tubular body at the base of the cone, indicating that the sensillum serves as a combined chemo- and mechanosensory organ (3, 84, 105, 111, 141). Sensilla styloconica are sensitive to certain mono- and oligosaccharides and a variety of other substances (22, 127). For example, in butterflies that feed on fermenting fruits, the sensilla also respond to ethanol (117). The central projection pattern of the sensory neurons can be divided into two categories, which presumably reflect the functions of these sensilla (105). The axons of the receptor neurons enter the tritocerebrum and terminate near the antennal gustatory neurons. Stimulation of sensilla styloconica with sucrose increases proboscis movements and food ingestion (76)."
