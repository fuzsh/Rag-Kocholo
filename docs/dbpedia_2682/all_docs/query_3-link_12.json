        "text": "The adult\n\nNearly all external surfaces of the adult are covered with scales, which may be broad and flat or long and hairlike. Each of these is the outgrowth of a single epidermal cell. Similar scales occur in a few groups of other insects but never to the same extent.\n\nLike most insects, adult lepidopterans have three distinct body segments, or tagmata—the head, the thorax, and the abdomen—each with special functions. The head bears the main sensory organs and those of feeding and ingestion. The thorax is chiefly concerned with locomotion. The abdomen contains the main organs of digestion, excretion, and reproduction and bears the external accessory reproductive structures.\n\nHead\n\nThe head is relatively small and round or elliptical. With regard to its evolutionary development, it is derived from the first six primitive body segments (somites, or metameres), but these have become so coalesced that none of the primitive segmentation is evident. The antennae are prominent and multisegmented, with many microscopic receptors (sensilla) for detecting odours. In most moths the antennae are slender and tapering, although in some the surface area of the antennae is greatly enlarged by many side branches that make them comblike or featherlike. In skippers and butterflies the terminal part is expanded into a clublike shape, on which most of the sensilla are concentrated. In many families there is also a cluster of sensory bristles (the chaetosema) on each side of the head near the eye. On either side of the head is a large compound eye, sometimes consisting of thousands of units (ommatidia). Most moths have, in addition to the compound eyes, a pair of very small simple eyes (ocelli), which have limited light-sensing ability but do not form an image.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nDeadliest Animals Quiz\n\nThe compound eyes are very efficient for distinguishing motion but not for resolving clear images of distant objects. Diurnal species may be able to distinguish flower shapes, and courting individuals have been shown to respond to specific wing patterns. Colour perception, especially in the blue-violet end of the spectrum, is acute in some species. Moths are generally able to see by ultraviolet light, to which they are often strongly attracted at night.\n\nThe sense of smell is acute in some groups, especially in males with large antennal surfaces. The sense of taste, especially for sugars, is also acute. In moths and butterflies, taste receptors are located chiefly on the palpi and on the feet (tarsi).\n\nNearly all caterpillars have chewing mouthparts, but these are retained among adults of only the most primitive moths—the mandibulate moths of family Micropterigidae. Caterpillar mouthparts basically consist of an anterior flap (labrum), a pair of chewing jaws (mandibles), a pair of complex first maxillae, and a pair of similar second maxillae joined together behind the mouth to form a structure called the labium. Each of the first and second maxillae bears a jointed sensory appendage, or palpus. All these structures function together for chewing and manipulating solid foods. In the vast majority of adults the mandibles are either vestigial and nonfunctional or entirely absent. Parts of the first maxillae, however, are elongated to form the two halves of a tubular proboscis (haustellum) through which liquids may be sucked. The segmented palpi of the first and second maxillae are present and function as sensory organs. Not all adults have all these parts fully formed and functional. In numerous families the proboscis has become considerably reduced and even vestigial, resulting in adults that cannot feed. In advanced moths and in skippers and butterflies, the maxillary palpi are vestigial or lost, so that only the labial palpi remain functional.\n\nMouthpart reduction in adults appears to have occurred independently in a number of evolutionary lines. The result in these species has been to limit feeding to the larval stage and thus enable the adult stage to be dedicated only to reproduction and dispersal.\n\nThorax\n\nThe thorax consists of three segments, the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax, each derived from a primitive segment. The prothorax bears the first pair of legs and a pair of respiratory openings (spiracles). The much larger mesothorax bears the second pair of legs, a second pair of spiracles, and the pair of forewings. The metathorax bears the third pair of legs and the pair of hind wings. In many moths the metathorax bears a pair of complex auditory organs (tympana). In some species these organs serve as receptors of the high-frequency echolocation signals emitted by hunting bats, allowing the moths to initiate escape maneuvers. In other species the auditory organs are receptors of mate location calls. Sound signals are produced in some species by timbal organs and in others by a mechanical clicking of the wing base.\n\nThe wings begin development in the maturing larva as invaginations of the epidermis. As the pupa is formed, these fold out (evaginate) to lie externally and become large and flat. Within them, branching tubes (tracheae) carry an air supply and also mark the pathways along which will develop the tubular “veins” that support the fully formed wings. When the adult emerges from the pupa, the wings expand to full size. On the wing the scales lie in overlapping rows, like shingles. The usual scale is a flattened, rigid, air-filled sac attached by a peglike base. It is usually ribbed longitudinally and toothed terminally. Many males have special glandular scent scales (androconia) scattered or concentrated in patches (brands or stigmata) on the wings, sometimes forming expansible, hairlike tufts. These have a scent-distributing function that is essential in specialized courtship.\n\nThe scales and hairs of the adults, especially on the wings, are responsible for colours and patterns. There are many different pigments of several chemically diverse types such as melanins, uric acid derivatives, and flavones. In addition, the microstructure of hairs and scales refracts light in various ways so as to produce colours as well as metallic, pearly, iridescent, and white effects. Very fine parallel ridges in scales may produce an iridescence by acting as diffraction gratings. More common are the effects of very thin superimposed layers (laminae) in the walls of the scales, a colour phenomenon comparable to that produced by a thin film of oil on water. Many of the most striking effects are caused by combinations of pigmental and structural colours.\n\nThe forewings and hind wings on each side are coupled together in various ways. In primitive moths a fingerlike lobe on the forewing overlaps the base of the hind wing. In most moths a strong bristle or cluster of bristles (frenulum) near the base of the hind wing engages a catch (retinaculum) on the forewing. In some moths and in the skippers and butterflies, the frenulum mechanism has been lost, and the wings are coordinated by the friction of the overlapping areas. In the most primitive moths the forewings and hind wings are similar in size, shape, and veinage. In most moths and in the skippers and butterflies, the hind wings have become shorter and more rounded, with reduced veining except in the posterior wing section. The anterior, or leading (costal), edge of the forewing is thickened, with stronger veins, while the outer and posterior (anal) wing section margins are thinner and weaker. This accords with the function of the wings as airfoils having a stiff leading edge and a flexible trailing edge.\n\nThe wings are characteristically modified in various families. In many moths of the superfamily Tineoidea, both wings have become extremely narrow, with much-reduced venation. However, along the margins there are long, dense fringes of hairs that maintain the functional wing area. In the plume moths (family Pterophoridae) the wings are deeply cleft into two or three narrow plumes, and in the many-plumed moths (family Alucitidae) each wing is cleft into six plumes. In a number of moth families the females are wingless, although the males are fully winged (bagworm moths [family Psychidae], some tussock moths [family Lymantriidae]). In the aquatic snout moth (Acentropus) some females are wingless, while some females and males are winged. There are eight main wing veins, each with a characteristic pattern. These are usually designated according to the modified Comstock-Needham system. The names of the veins (with their symbols in parentheses) and the usual number of branches of each (subscript designations) are as follows, in progression from the costal margin of the wing to the anal margin:\n\nCosta (C), along the anterior margin, no branches; Subcosta (Sc), usually with no branches, rarely with two (Sc1, Sc2);\n\nRadius (R), typically with five branches (R1–R5); Media (M), with three branches (M1–M3; four in some other insects);\n\nCubitus (Cu), primitively with three branches (Cu1a, Cu1b, Cu2);\n\nAnal veins, First (1A), Second (2A), and Third (3A), all unbranched.\n\nAbdomen and genitalia\n\nThe abdomen has 10 segments, although the posterior ones are indistinct. Each of the first eight segments bears a pair of spiracles. The first or second segments bear paired auditory organs in the snout moths and measuring worm moths. Segmental appendages are absent except for vestiges that may form parts of the genitalia. Various segments may bear special structures that produce and disperse pheromones. The genitalia of both sexes are often complex and bear characteristic spines, teeth, setae, and scale tufts. These structures are important in complex courtships and matings, preventing hybridization between males and females of different species.\n\nIn males a ringlike structure is the base of attachment for a number of dorsal structures and a pair of lateral clasping organs (valvae). In copulation a median tubular organ (the aedeagus) is extended through an eversible sheath (vesica) to inseminate the female. These structures are derived evolutionarily from parts of segments 8 and 10 and from vestiges of abdominal appendages.\n\nThe female genitalia show a number of different types of organization of the internal genital ducts and openings. These are considered so fundamental that the lepidopterans can be classified into suborders largely on the basis of these traits and their correlation with characteristics of the mouthparts, wings, and early developmental stages.\n\nThe internal reproductive systems of both sexes contain the organs typical of most insects. The testes of the male are paired in primitive lepidopterans but fused into a single organ in advanced forms. In both cases the sperm ducts are paired. As in other insects, the sperm pass from the testes down these paired ducts (vasa deferentia) for storage in sacs called seminal vesicles. Accessory glands, providing fluids that lengthen the life of the sperm, open into the vasa deferentia.\n\nThe female reproductive system consists of paired ovaries, paired accessory glands that provide the yolks and shells of the eggs, and a system of receptacles and ducts for receiving, conducting, and storing sperm. The individual oviducts join to form a common oviduct that leads to the vagina. In copulation the male deposits a sperm capsule (spermatophore) in a receptacle of the female. The spermatophore releases the sperm, which swim into the oviduct and thence to the seminal receptacle, where they are stored until egg laying. This may occur hours, days, or months after mating.\n\nThe larva, or caterpillar\n\nCompared with the highly specialized adult, the larva is simple and primitive. Many of the primitive characteristics retained in the larva are important in the classification of the suborders, superfamilies, and families. The traits also aid in making speculations on relationships among these groups (taxa).\n\nThe head bears a pair of very short antennae and on each side a cluster of minute simple eyes (stemmata). A short liplike labrum is in front of the mouth. Behind the labrum are paired jaws (mandibles) that are short, broad, and powerful to allow consumption of large amounts of plant material. Next is a pair of small first maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Then, more or less connected with the maxillae, is the labium-hypopharynx, a complex structure with a pair of labial palps between which is located a tubular spinneret through which silk is extruded. Each of the three thoracic segments bears a pair of short segmented legs. The remaining 10 segments constitute the abdomen. Abdominal segments 3 through 6 and segment 10 bear a pair of fleshy appendages called prolegs, which may be homologous with the primitive segmental appendages. Each proleg has one or two curved rows of minute hooklets and an eversible soft end, the planta. The crochets on the prolegs allow the larva to hold onto surfaces. Body fluids forced into the proleg cause it to expand, extending the hooklets. After the proleg has been placed on the substrate, the fluids are retracted into the body and the elasticity of the cuticle causes the tiny hooks to retract, thus gripping the substrate. Prothorax and abdominal segments 1 to 8 have a pair of spiracles on them.\n\nThe larval epidermis bears on the head and each body segment a number of bristles known as primary setae. The position and number of setae are constant in each species and so are important in classification. Often there are many secondary setae, giving the caterpillar a hairy appearance. Larvae that live and feed as borers, burrowers, or miners are mostly plain. Those that live and feed in the open often show a great diversity of shape, colour, pattern, and ornamentation. Many have wartlike projections (verrucae) that may bear tufts of setae or spiny projections, or there may be prominent hornlike or spiny processes.\n\nIn some families the number of prolegs has been modified. In the measuring worms the prolegs of segments three, four, and five are missing, and in some owlet moths one or two pairs have been lost. In the puss moth caterpillars the last pair has evolved into a pair of long eversible whiplashes (stemmatopoda). The larvae of some leaf miners (family Gracillariidae) have lost some or all of the prolegs. Mandibulate moth larvae have eight pairs of abdominal legs, which are structured more like true thoracic legs than prolegs.\n\nInternally, the larva is relatively simple, with the very large digestive tract being the most prominent organ. The paired silk glands are often very large, extending far back into the abdomen. The ovaries and testes, which begin to develop during embryonic life, continue to develop in the larva, as do the wings. Many special glands secrete repellent or toxic substances, which may circulate in the blood or be extruded from special openings as a means of defense.\n\nLarval vision can detect little more than differences between light and darkness. Taste is acute, with highly developed sensory receptors in the antennae and palpi. Food discrimination is keen, and many larvae will starve rather than eat abnormal food plants. The sense of touch functions via setae widely distributed over the outer surface. Some of these appear to react to sound waves of low pitch, well within the limits of human hearing."
