        "text": "Wings\n\nWings are also important features of insects and the variations of wing forms can help identify insect families, genera, and even different species. Wing venation (the arrangement of veins in wings) also serves as a means of identifying insects to family or sometimes species. Wing surfaces may be covered with fine hairs or scales or they may be bare or membranous; these characteristics can be used for identification as well. Note that the names of most insect orders end in “-ptera,” which comes from the Greek word meaning “with wings.” Many order names describe some feature of the wings. Hemiptera means “half-winged” and refers to the appearance of the wings of true bugs, while Diptera means “two-winged” and refers to the fact that flies have only one pair of wings.\n\nOnly adult insects possess wings, although wing pads (areas where the wings are developing) are sometimes noticeable on older nymphs.\n\nAbdomen\n\nThe insect abdomen may have 11–12 segments, but in most cases they are difficult to see clearly because the segments are short or they are covered by wings. Some insects have appendages called cerci at the tip of the abdomen. Cerci can be short, as seen in grasshoppers, termites, and cockroaches; extremely long, as in mayflies; or curved, as in earwigs.\n\nInsect Development—Metamorphosis\n\nAs immature insects feed and grow, eventually their exoskeleton gets too tight and the insect must shed the outer skeleton in a process called “molting.” At various stages of growth, the immature insect will split open the exoskeleton and pull itself out of it wearing a soft, new exoskeleton it formed under the old one. The new exoskeleton will harden to protect the insect while giving it sufficient room to grow once it hardens. The stage of life between each molt is called an instar. The number of instars, or the frequency of molts, varies with each species and to some extent with food supply, temperature, and moisture.\n\nIn addition to molting, insects also undergo a distinctive phenomenon called metamorphosis at certain stages of their development. The term is a combination of two Greek words: “meta,” meaning change, and “morphe,” meaning form. Metamorphosis is a biological process in which an insect undergoes an abrupt change in its form from one stage of development to the next. A familiar example of metamorphosis is the change a caterpillar undergoes when it becomes a pupa, or when the adult butterfly emerges from the pupa.\n\nTypes of Metamorphosis\n\nWithout metamorphosis (ametabolous): Insects increase in size throughout their life cycle but do not change basic body structure and arrangement. The adult is wingless and looks very similar to the immature form. This is considered the most evolutionarily ‘primitive’ form of metamorphosis. Silverfish are a good example of an insect with ametabolous metamorphosis. Example orders: Protura, Diplura, Thysanura, Collembola.\n\nGradual metamorphosis: Insects increase in size while maintaining the same basic characteristics throughout the life of the insect. This is the most common type of metamorphosis seen in insects. There are three stages of development in hemimetabolous insects: egg, immature, and adult. Hemimetabolous insects are usually terrestrial. The immatures, called nymphs, share similar food sources with the adult insects. Some hemimetabolous insects are aquatic, such as the dragonflies. Immature aquatic insects are called naiads and they have a different food source than the terrestrial adults. In both terrestrial and aquatic hemimetabolous insects, fully functioning wings are found only in the adult stage. These wings will appear as developing wing buds in the immature stage. Example orders that undergo gradual metamorphosis: Orthoptera, Hemiptera. Orders that undergo incomplete metamorphosis: Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera.\n\nComplete metamorphosis (holometabolous): Insects go through four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The immature larvae differ greatly in appearance from their adult form. The profound change from larvae to adult takes place during the pupal stage. Many tissues and structures, such as the prolegs of caterpillars, are completely broken down, and true legs, antennae, wings, and other structures of the adult are formed. The larvae of holometabolous insects often use different food sources from the adults. These are considered to be the most evolutionarily advanced and biodiverse insect orders. Example orders: Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera.\n\nRegardless of the type of metamorphosis, the adult stage of an insect focuses on reproduction rather than feeding and growth. Some adults are very short-lived and they may not feed at all.\n\nIdentifying Insects\n\nSome home gardeners recognize insects by the common name of their order, such as beetle, wasp, ant, or butterfly. Common names are sometimes regional and occasionally inaccurate. For example, a June bug in one area may be called a May beetle in another location. However, these common names can be helpful when conversing with clients who are not familiar with insects or their scientific names.\n\nWhile there are many apps and online tools available to help ID insects, becoming familiar with insect orders and basic entomology can help gardeners assess the accuracy of ID recommendations from apps (which are not always correct) and provide a starting point for online searches.\n\nThe ability to classify an insect to its correct order gives a gardener access to valuable information about that insect. This information includes the type of mouthparts the insect has, which provides clues to the type of plant damage caused by members in that order and which methods may be effective in controlling those insects. Familiarity with the life cycle of an insect can help the planning for the proper use and timing of best management practices to avoid pest problems.\n\nBecause of the sheer number of insects, their overall diversity, and their relatively small size, identification can be difficult for the beginner. Outside of having a local expert identify them, the best way for gardeners to learn insect classification is to practice using a dichotomous key. Dichotomous keys are based on an organized series of choices between mutually exclusive characteristics, arranged hierarchically from the more general to the more specific. By working through the organized set of couplets and carefully selecting answers, you can arrive at the correct identification of an organism. These keys require knowledge of insect characteristics and time spent becoming familiar with how to use the keys, but this effort will allow the gardener to quickly classify insects to the order level or even higher levels. The goal of order level keys is to familiarize the user with the basic characteristics so that eventually the keys will become no longer necessary except as a reminder when memory fails.\n\nWhile the identification of adult insects can be learned with some practice, immature insects often present a greater challenge. With the exception of colorful caterpillars and some odd-looking species, many immature insects are difficult to differentiate from each other and their adult counterparts. Sometimes the immature stages look nothing like the adult stage. There are some rules of thumb to describe immature insects in relation to their adult counterparts. The following table illustrates some of the main differences.\n\nTable 3-1: Features of immature and mature insects\n\nImmature Insects Adult Insects Sometimes worm-like or grubs Three body regions Number of legs can vary Three pairs of legs Body generally soft and/or fleshy Usually with tough body wall Lack wings May have wings Most move slowly Most can move quickly\n\nIn some cases we are more dependent upon host and habitat information to help us identify insects in question. Knowing the host plant can go a long way to figuring out the insect (for example, tomato hornworms aren’t usually found on oak trees). Some key questions can offer important clues to the identification of the immature insect. Where were the insects found? What are the insects eating? What kind of mouthparts do they have? Do they have legs? If so, how many legs? What color are the insects?\n\nFor your reference, the insect orders have been divided into three sections: those containing insects important to the gardener, those containing insects of lesser importance to the gardener, and common “noninsect” pests in Virginia. The orders containing insects of importance to home gardeners will be considered in detail.\n\nResources for Identifying Insects\n\nThere are many insect identification keys available in textbooks, field guides, scientific papers, and on the Internet. Start with keys that are simple, such as those for the order level, and do not rely on scientific terminology. A good key for beginners are the following books: A Field Guide to Insects North of Mexico, by Donald J. Borrer and Richard E. White; Garden Insects of North America: The Ultimate Guide, by Whitney Cranshaw; and Bugs Rule!, An Introduction to the World of Insects by Whitney Cranshaw. In addition the website bugguide.net is a fabulous resource for images of insects and other arthropods. Experts on this website may be able to assist with the identification of an arthropod if a high-quality image can be uploaded to the site. Most of the characteristics used to identify an insect to order can be seen with a 10X magnifier, although it is easier with a dissecting microscope and a good light source. Once an insect has been identified to order it can be more easily cross-referenced with other resources that narrow down possible suspects by habitat or food source.\n\nInsect ID Lab\n\nInsects can be submitted to Virginia Tech’s Insect ID Lab for identification. Important information that must be included is: host plant or location found, date, description of damage, when it was first found, and if control information is required. Since an Extension office is an excellent resource on local pests, identifications can often be obtained at that office without sending a sample to state identifier.\n\nWatch: Basic Entomology and the VT Insect ID Lab with Eric Day\n\nTypes of Insect Injury\n\nSometimes it is useful to classify insects in groups according to how they feed or damage plants. Members of these groups, also called guilds, all share a common manner of injuring plants even though they may belong to different insect orders.\n\nInjury by Chewing Insects\n\nInsects take their food in a variety of ways. Many insects feed by chewing off the external parts of a plant, so they are called “chewing insects.” Examples of this type of plant injury are easy to find. Perhaps the best way to appreciate the prevalence of this type of damage is to look for leaves of plants in late summer that have no sign of leaf chewing. Cabbage worms, armyworms, grasshoppers, Colorado potato beetle, and fall webworm are common examples of chewing insects. Often chewing insects merely browse the leaves and do not cause a significant amount of plant damage beyond aesthetics. Significant plant damage occurs when large numbers of insects defoliate a significant portion of the leaf and impair its ability to make food for the plant. Plant species differ in their responses to insect damage, and this should be a consideration in pest management.\n\nInjury by Piercing-Sucking Insects\n\nOther insects feed by piercing plant tissue and sucking sap from the plant’s cells. Only internal liquids from the plant are ingested, not portions of the tissue. Insects that feed this way have slender, sharp mouthparts that are inserted into the plant and used like a straw. The injury to the plant is physically small and very difficult to see with the naked eye, but the withdrawal of sap can result in: minute, spotty discolorations on leaves, fruit, and stems; curling or puckering of leaves; deformed fruit and seeds; witch’s broom growths; or a general wilting and dying of the entire plant. Aphids, squash bugs, scale insects, leafhoppers, and other members of the order Hemiptera are all piercing-sucking insects. Many of these pests also carry plant diseases and transmit them when they feed.\n\nInjury by Internal Feeders\n\nSome insects feed within plant tissues for all or part of their development. They gain entrance to plants either when an adult female inserts her eggs into part of a plant, or by eating their way into the plant after hatching from eggs deposited on the plant. In either case, the entrance hole is small and hard to see. Large holes in fruit, seeds, stems, or trunks usually indicate where an insect has left the plant, not where it entered.\n\nThe chief guilds of internal plant feeders share a common name for their group. Borers feed in wood or pith; worms or weevils are found in fruits, nuts, or seeds; leaf miners live within the thin layers of leaf tissue; and gall insects form characteristic homes from leaves, stems, twigs, and roots. These guilds are some of the most important insect pests. Nearly all internal feeding insects live inside the plant only during part of their lives and usually emerge as adults. Control measures are most effective when aimed at emerging adults or the immature stages before they enter the plant, where they are hidden from sight and well protected.\n\nInjury by Subterranean Insects\n\nInsects that attack plants below the surface of the soil are also hidden from sight. These subterranean insects include chewing and sucking insects, root borers, and gall insects. Some subterranean insects spend their entire life cycle below ground. For example, the woolly apple aphid sucks sap from the roots of apple trees as both nymph and adult, causing the development of tumors and subsequent decay of the tree roots. Other subterranean insects have at least one life stage found above ground. Examples include wireworms, root maggots, strawberry root weevil, and corn rootworm. These larvae are root feeders while the adults live above ground.\n\nInjury by Egg Laying\n\nProbably 95% of the plant injury caused by insects is due to their feeding in the various ways just described. Some insects also cause damage by laying eggs in critical plant tissues. The periodical cicada deposits eggs in 1-year-old-growth of deciduous trees, splitting the wood so much that the twig may break and die. When they hatch, the nymphs drop to the ground and feed on roots in the soil but cause no further damage to the canopy.\n\nFemale gall insects lay eggs in plant tissues. The plant responds by forming a gall where the female laid her eggs, which houses and feeds the developing immature insects. Galls are abnormal growths of deformed stem, leaf, root, or bud tissue. They can be distinctive enough that the attacking insect can be identified to species based solely on the size and shape of the gall. Gall formation is likely initiated by chemicals produced by the female laying her eggs, but continued development of the gall relies on the mechanical damage by larval feeding and secretions from the developing grubs.\n\nUse of Plants for Nest Materials\n\nInsects sometimes remove parts of plants for the construction of nests or to provision nests. Leaf-cutter bees neatly cut circular pieces of foliage from roses and other plants to line the brood cells of their young.\n\nInsects as Vectors for Plant Diseases\n\nThere are over 200 plant diseases spread by insects. Viruses produce the majority of plant diseases vectored by insects, followed by fungi, bacteria, and some protozoa. One example is fire blight of apples and related fruit trees, which is caused by bacteria and spread by honey bees and other pollinators.\n\nInsects can spread plant disease in the following ways:\n\nBy creating wounds when feeding, laying eggs, or boring into plants. These are entrance points for a disease that is not actually carried by the insect.\n\nBy carrying and disseminating the causative agent of a disease in or on their bodies from one plant to the next. This is a passive transfer of pathogens.\n\nBy carrying pathogens in or on their bodies and actively transferring the pathogen into the host as they feed.\n\nBy serving as an essential host for some part of the pathogen’s life cycle. The pathogen could not survive without the insect host.\n\nExamples of diseases where the insect is the vector:\n\nThe fungus responsible for Dutch elm disease and the elm bark beetle.\n\nThe virus responsible for tomato curly top and the beet leafhopper.\n\nThe virus responsible for tomato spotted wilt and thrips.\n\nThe bacteria responsible for Stewart’s disease in corn and corn rootworm and flea beetles.\n\nThe virus responsible for rose rosette disease and eriophyid mites.\n\nInsects of Importance to the Gardener\n\nOrthoptera: Grasshoppers, Crickets, Katydids\n\nAdults can be moderate to large insects, often with hard bodies.\n\nHind legs are modified for jumping. Antennae can be very long.\n\nThey undergo gradual metamorphosis. Nymphs resemble adults but lack wings.\n\nAdults have two pairs of wings. The forewings are elongated, narrow, and hardened. Hindwings are membranous with extensive folded areas. Some species have reduced wings or may be wingless.\n\nMany orthopterans “sing” or chirp by rubbing one part of their body against another.\n\nBlattodea: Cockroaches and Termites\n\nBoth cockroaches and termites have chewing mouthparts.\n\nBoth cockroaches and termites undergo gradual metamorphosis. Nymphs generally resemble the adults but without wings.\n\nCockroaches have oval, flattened bodies and are usually dark brown to reddish in color. They can be small to large insects. Adults may have wings, or they may be reduced in size or absent. Cockroaches are known for being fast runners.\n\nTermites somewhat resemble ants in shape and size, but they lack the “waist” seen in ants. They are soft-bodied and live in colonies with a complex social system. Termites feed on cellulose and are very destructive to wood. Reproductive termites have two pairs of wings, but they may shed them quickly.\n\nMantodea: Praying Mantises, Mantids\n\nAdults can be moderate to large insects.\n\nThey have elongated bodies, large eyes, and front legs modified for catching their prey.\n\nAdults have two pairs of wings. The forewings are elongated, narrow, and hardened. Hindwings are membranous with extensive folded areas.\n\nThey undergo gradual metamorphosis. Nymphs resemble adults but lack wings.\n\nBoth nymphs and adults have chewing mouthparts and eat other arthropods.\n\nDiptera: Flies, Mosquitoes, Gnats, Midges\n\nAdult flies have one pair of wings, are usually soft-bodied, and often covered with hairs or bristles.\n\nFlies undergo complete metamorphosis.\n\nMost larvae are legless with chewing mouthparts or mouth “hooks.”\n\nAdults have sponging mouthparts, or in blood-feeders like mosquitoes, piercing mouthparts.\n\nLarvae of advanced flies (such as house flies) lack a head capsule, possess mouth hooks, and are called maggots.\n\nLarvae of lower forms (such as mosquitoes and fungus gnats) possess a head capsule.\n\nBlood-feeding flies (such as mosquitoes, horse flies, biting midges, and black flies) are a nuisance and can transmit diseases.\n\nHymenoptera: Bees, Ants, Wasps, Sawflies, Horntails\n\nAdults usually have two pairs of membranous wings. (Female velvet ants do not have wings.)\n\nLarvae have no legs except for the sawflies, with three pairs of legs on the thorax and at least six pairs of legs on the abdomen.\n\nAdults have chewing mouthparts and soft or slightly hard bodies.\n\nThey undergo complete metamorphosis.\n\nAsian giant hornet look-alikes in Virginia\n\nVespa mandarinia, or the Asian giant hornet, has not been found in Virginia (in the U.S., it has only been confirmed in the Pacific Northwest). A few look-alike species are found in Virginia and these are often mistaken for the Asian giant hornet. For example, the European hornet, Asian hornet/yellow-legged hornet, and the cicada killer are large insects that can be mistaken for the Asian giant hornet. For more information, see Virginia Tech’s Asian giant hornet fact sheet here.\n\nLepidoptera: Butterflies, Moths, Caterpillars, Cutworms\n\nAdults are soft-bodied with two pairs of well-developed wings covered with scales.\n\nThey undergo complete metamorphosis.\n\nLarvae have chewing mouthparts while adults have a coiled, sucking tube adapted for feeding on nectar and other liquids.\n\nLarvae are called caterpillars; they are worm-like, voracious feeders on plants.\n\nCaterpillars have three pairs of legs on the thorax as well as multiple pairs of legs on the abdomen.\n\nNeuroptera: Lacewings, Antlions, Snakeflies, Dobsonflies\n\nMany neuropterans are predators of other insects.\n\nSome are aquatic.\n\nAdults have two pairs of membranous wings held “roof-like” over the abdomen.\n\nAdults have chewing mouthparts and long antennae.\n\nThey undergo complete metamorphosis.\n\nTable 3-2: Insect orders of lesser importance\n\n(Examples, not a comprehensive list)\n\nOrder Example Insects Ephemeroptera Mayflies Embiidina Webspinners Mecoptera Scorpionflies Odonata Dragonflies, damselflies Plecoptera Stoneflies Psocoptera Booklice, barklice, parasitic lice Siphonaptera Fleas Strepsiptera Twisted-wing insects Trichoptera Caddisflies Zoraptera Angel insects Zygentoma Silverfish\n\nCommonly Encountered Non-Insect Arthropods\n\nThere are a variety of other arthropods seen in the average backyard. The following are some of the more common ones found in Virginia.\n\nArachnida: Spiders, Mites, Ticks, Daddy-Longlegs\n\nSpiders are soft-bodied arthropods with two distinct body regions. Spiders have four pairs of legs, although some of their specialized mouthparts may be mistaken for legs. Spiders are important predators of insects and other arthropods. Many spiders spin webs to catch their prey but others ambush or actively hunt for food. Only a few species of spiders in Virginia have venom considered potentially harmful to humans. For more information, see the VCE publication “Spiders of Medical Concern” ENTO-346NP.\n\nMites superficially resemble very tiny spiders. They have two body regions that appear undivided and lack antennae. Most adult mites have four pairs of legs while some of the immature stages have only three pairs of legs. Many mites are plant feeders, but some are predators of other mites while others feed on animals. Spider mites that attack plants often produce noticeable sheets of webbing when their populations are large.\n\nTicks look much like large mites. Adults have four pairs of legs while the youngest immature stage has only three pairs of legs. They are exclusively parasitic, feeding on the blood of animals. Some species are important vectors of diseases. For more information, see the VCE publication “Common Ticks of Virginia” ENTO-487NP.\n\nDaddy-longlegs are also known as harvestmen. These familiar arachnids have small bodies and long legs that are often several times longer than the length of the body. They are harmless and do not possess venom.\n\nTick populations densest in suburban forests\n\nBy David Gaines, State Public Health Entomologist Virginia Dept. of Health, Office of Epidemiology\n\nSuburban forests are the most important tick prone environments for people, and persons whose homes are adjacent to suburban forests are at higher risk of exposure to ticks and the diseases that they carry than people who do not live next to such forests.\n\nDeer hunting is generally prohibited in suburban forests due to the dangers posed to people and homes by firearms and flying projectiles. Therefore, deer population densities often become much higher in suburban forests than in rural forests. Because populations of the two most important human-biting, disease-vector tick species in Virginia (blacklegged ticks and lone star ticks) mainly use deer as their mating ground and as a source of blood used by mated female ticks to nourish the thousands of eggs she will lay, tick population densities will generally be greatest where deer population density is highest.\n\nBlacklegged tick adults mostly meet and mate on deer during the fall and early winter season, and lone star tick males and females mostly meet and mate on deer during the late winter and early spring season. The male ticks often encounter and mate with the female ticks on a deer as the females are engorging on deer blood, and each mated female tick that has filled up with deer blood can nourish up to 3000 to 4000 eggs to lay. The fully engorged female ticks often drop off the deer and lay their eggs in these same suburban forests.\n\nImmature lone star ticks often pick up the ehrlichia disease agents that they transmit to people by feeding on an infected deer, and immature blacklegged tick larvae that have recently hatched out of eggs often become infected with Lyme disease, or other associated disease agents, by feeding on white-footed mice (which are primarily a rodent species associated with suburban forests or forest environments that have been altered or fragmented by human activity). Additionally, suburban forest environments often offer mouse nesting habitats such as firewood piles, scrap lumber piles, leaf piles, sheds, or junk piles for the mice to nest under.\n\nReduce your risk:\n\nVirginia has three tick species that can bite people and transmit diseases (lone star tick Amblyomma americanum, American dog tick Dermacentor variabilis, and blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis), and at least 12 different disease agents and/or health conditions that can be caused by tick bites to people, including ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, and alpha-gal syndrome (also called acquired red meat allergy).\n\nProbably the best means of reducing the risk of blacklegged or lone star tick bites is to wear permethrin-treated shoes, socks and pants, and to always tuck the treated pants legs into the treated socks. That is because the ticks, which are primarily found in shaded areas on the ground, on leaf litter, or on very low vegetation on the forest floor, generally climb onto a person’s shoes first, and then crawl upwards until they can find some skin to attach to and feed from. Therefore, if one’s shoes, socks, and pants are treated with permethrin, and are tucked, by the time a blacklegged nymph has been forced to crawl across the treated shoes and socks, it will also be forced to climb up the treated pants legs, and will become too intoxicated from the permethrin to go much further.\n\nLone star nymphs move much faster than blacklegged nymphs, so they may climb up a person’s treated shoes, socks and pants, to reach the shirt level, and then may go between the buttons looking for skin to attach to. However, because that tick has crossed a large amount of permethrin-treated clothing, it typically dies inside one’s shirt without ever biting. On the other hand, if one is wearing shorts or will have a lot of hand contact with the forest floor, it is best to wear treated shoes, socks, shorts and shirt, and apply a band of deet around the ankles and wrists to serve as a deterrent/barrier to the ticks climbing any higher. Clothing that has been treated with permethrin stays effective even after a few wash cycles, and may remain effective for a full season.\n\nFor more information about ticks, see the Virginia Department of Health website and their publication “Ticks and Tick-Borne Disease of Virginia.”\n\nDiplopoda: Millipedes\n\nMillipedes are long arthropods whose bodies are rounded in cross section and made up of many segments. All but the first four or five body segments behind the head have two pairs of legs. Millipedes move slowly and are found in leaf litter or on the soil. They prefer humid habitats. Most are detritivores, feeding on decaying organic matter. Sometimes they can be pests to tender young plants or in greenhouses.\n\nChilopoda: Centipedes\n\nCentipedes are also long arthropods made up of many segments. They tend to be flatter than millipedes, with longer antennae and only one pair of legs per body segment. The last pair of legs is held extended behind the body. Centipedes are fast-moving predators of other arthropods, with a pair of legs modified into “poison claws” that they use to inject venom into their prey. Despite their fearsome appearance, most centipedes are too small to be of medical concern to humans.\n\nIsopoda: Sowbugs, Roly Poly, Pill Bugs, Woodlice\n\nThese are small, oval arthropods with highly segmented, hard bodies and seven pairs of legs. They require high humidity for survival. Only some isopods can roll themselves into a ball. Isopods feed on decaying plant matter and are generally harmless, but sometimes they attack young, tender plants.\n\nTable 3-3: Commonly seen classes of phylum arthropoda\n\nClass Examples Body Regions Pairs of Legs Importance Arachnida Spiders, mites, ticks, harvestmen, scorpions, chiggers, etc. 1-2 4 (immature ticks have 3 pairs) Spiders prey on insects; some mites are major plant pests while others are beneficial predators; ticks, some mites and spiders, and scorpions are of medical importance Chilopoda Centipedes 15+ 15+, 1 pair per segment Predators of insects, spiders, and other small animals; some are household pests Collembola Springtails 3 3 Feed on decaying organic matter can be pests of houseplants Diplopoda Millipedes 2 (body can have many segments) Generally 2 pairs per segment Feed on decaying organic matter Diplura Two-pronged bristletails 3 Feed on decaying organic matter Insecta Beetles, true bugs, flies, butterflies, wasps, fleas, etc. 3 3 Mostly beneficial with some pest species Malacostraca Crabs, lobsters, shrimp, sowbugs 2 5 Many aquatic orders; some considered delicacies; predators and scavengers Protura Coneheads 3 3 Feed on decaying organic matter Symphyla Symphylans, garden centipedes 2 (body can have many segments) 10-12 Feed on decaying organic matter; can be pests in agriculture\n\nTaxonomy\n\nClassification Mnemonic:\n\nKingdom = Keep\n\nPhylum = Putting\n\nClass = Coffee\n\nOrder = On\n\nFamily = For\n\nGenus = Good\n\nSpecies = Students\n\nTaxonomy is the science of classifying life into a hierarchical scheme with categories of varying ranks. Identification of the hundreds of thousands of species of insects would be impossible if they were not organized around a standard classification system that groups organisms according to their shared characteristics. All life on Earth is divided into six kingdoms, the highest level of the classification system: Eubacteria, Archaeabacteria, Protista, Fungi, Animalia, and Plantae. Each kingdom is further divided into smaller phyla. For example, several of the phyla that contain agricultural and horticultural pests in the animal kingdom are:\n\nArthropoda (insects, spiders, mites, crayfish, millipedes)\n\nNematoda (roundworms, trichina)\n\nPlatyhelminthes (flatworms, flukes, tapeworms)\n\nMollusca (snails, slugs, clams)\n\nPhyla are subdivided into classes, which are composed of orders. Orders are composed of families, which contain genera, in which the species are ultimately placed. High school biology students may remember the phrase “Keep Putting Coffee On For Good Students,” or a similar mnemonic device to help remember the whole classification arrangement of kingdom through species.\n\nPhylum Arthropoda and its Classes\n\nInsects belong to the phylum Arthropoda. Arthropods are a very important group of animals, representing more than 80% of all described living animal species. Familiar arthropods include spiders, ticks, crabs, scorpions, shrimp, barnacles, and insects. All arthropods share some common characteristics, such as segmented bodies, paired segmented appendages, bilateral symmetry, and an exoskeleton (an outer “skin” or “shell” that serves as an external skeleton) that is periodically shed as the arthropod grows. Insects belong to the class Insecta.\n\nOrders of the class Insecta\n\nClasses are further divided into orders. Orders in the class Insecta are based on the type of metamorphosis, mouthparts, and wings an insect may have. Insect orders are further broken down into smaller groupings called the family. Each family is a more select group of very closely related insects. Family names end with “-idae.” Aphidae (aphids), Muscidae (house flies), and Acrididae (grasshoppers) are examples of families of insects.\n\nFamilies are divided into genera, which are finally divided into species. These are the most finite levels of our classification system. The house fly, Musca domestica, serves here as an example of specific classification:\n\nPhylum: Arthropoda\n\nClass: Insecta\n\nOrder: Diptera\n\nFamily: Muscidae\n\nGenus: Musca\n\nSpecies: domestica\n\nCommon name: house fly\n\nMusca domestica is the scientific name for the house fly. The scientific name of an organism includes both its genus and species names. The scientific name is always italicized and only the genus name is capitalized. Many insects, but not all, have common names; sometimes a single species will have several common names. For example, Heliothis zea is called the corn earworm when found on corn, but it is a tomato fruitworm when found on tomatoes. Using scientific names eliminates the confusion that can occur when an insect has several common names, or if one common name is used for more than one species. Common names can also refer to large groups of insects, such as families or orders. The entire order Coleoptera is known as the beetles. The term moth refers to thousands of species in the order Lepidoptera.\n\nNote: Invertebrate taxonomy often changes to reflect ongoing research into the relationships among organisms. Species are moved from genus to genus, whole families can be combined with another family, and changes sometimes occur even at the level of orders. One resource that stays up-to-date on the current state of insect taxonomy is the website bugguide.net. This website has a wealth of material on insects, spiders, and related arthropods, including a fantastic gallery of photos.\n\nTable 3-4: Commonly seen orders of the class Insecta\n\nOrder Common Name Habitat Metamorphosis Mouthparts Wings Zygentoma Silverfish Leaf litter and soil; indoors Gradual Chewing None Ephemeroptera Mayflies Aquatic or near water Gradual Vestigial 2 pairs Odonata Dragonflies, damselflies Aquatic or near water Gradual Chewing 2 pairs Dermaptera Earwigs On vegetation; leaf litter Gradual Chewing 2 pairs, sometimes reduced in size or absent Plecoptera Stoneflies Aquatic or near water Gradual Chewing 2 pairs, sometimes reduced in size or absent Orthoptera Grasshoppers, crickets, katydids On vegetation; leaf litter Gradual Chewing 2 pairs, sometimes reduced in size or absent Phasmida Walkingsticks On vegetation Gradual Chewing In the U.S., none or 2 pairs very reduced in size Mantodea Mantids On vegetation Gradual Chewing 2 pairs Blattodea Cockroaches, termites Leaf litter and woody plant debris; in buildings; subterranean Gradual Chewing 2 pairs on reproductive termites; 2 pairs, sometimes reduced in size, on cockroaches Thysanoptera Thrips On vegetation Intermediate between simple and complex Rasping-sucking 2 pairs Hemiptera True bugs, cicadas, aphids, leafhoppers, scales, and allies On vegetation; aquatic; in leaf litter Gradual Piercing-sucking 2 pairs, sometimes reduced or absent Psocodea Booklice, barklice, and parasitic lice Booklice are found in buildings; barklice on trees; parasitic lice on birds and mammals Gradual Chewing; piercing-sucking 2 pairs, sometimes reduced or absent in booklice and barklice; none in parasitic lice Neuroptera Dobsonflies, antlions, lacewings, and allies Aquatic or near water; on vegetation; in soil and leaf litter Complete Chewing 2 pairs Coleoptera Beetles Everywhere Complete Chewing 2 pairs, sometimes reduced in size or absent Hymenoptera Ants, bees, wasps, sawflies Everywhere Complete Chewing-lapping 2 pairs, sometimes reduced in size or absent Lepidoptera Butterflies, moths On vegetation or plant materials Complete Chewing siphoning 2 pairs, sometimes absent Siphonaptera Fleas In association with birds and mammal hosts Complete Piercing-sucking None Diptera Flies Everywhere Complete Piercing-sucking, sponging 1 pair\n\nSummary\n\nThe class Insecta is larger than all of the other classes in the Animal kingdom combined. Insect species vary greatly in size, color, shape, life history, and favored habitat. Most insects are harmless or even beneficial, but the few that cause damage have tremendous impact on the world. Insects can usually be recognized with practice and some knowledge of their host, habitat, and life cycle. Feeding damage by pest insects varies according to the type of mouthparts possessed by the insect.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nResources for Entomology section on the VCE publications website\n\nA Field Guide to Insects North of Mexico, by Donald J.
