The type-locality of the type-species of each nomenclaturally available name is also given. New genus-group names are proposed for 35 junior homonyms for which no replacement name could be found; one new genus and two new subgenera are established. Type-species are designated for 166 genera for which no designation could be found and 21 genera have been transferred to other families. Aim, Scope and Style The aim, scope and style of this catalogue follow closely those defined by Dr I. W. B. Nye in the first volume of this series and his definitions have largely been repeated in this introduction. The aim of this volume has been to compile a catalogue of all the genus-group names in the super- family Geometroidea, to include the families Pterothysanidae, Callidulidae, Thyatiridae, Cyclidiidae, Axiidae, Drepanidae, Uraniidae, Epicopeiidae, Sematuridae, Epiplemidae, Geometridae and Apopro- gonidae. The families included in this catalogue differ from those listed by Brock, 1971, J. nat. Hist. 5; 29-102, in his definition of the Geometroidea, by the inclusion of the Axiidae and the Apopro- gonidae, by the separation of the Cyclidiidae from the Drepanidae where Euchera substigmaria Hiibner [1831], had been placed, and by the separation of the Epicopeiidae and the Sematuridae from the Uraniidae. Each nomenclaturally available generic name has been objectively defined by linking it with its first valid type-species designation, determined according to the International Code of Zoological Nomen- clature (Edn 2), 1964 (with amendments, 1974). Invalid and incorrect designations of type-species which antedate the first vglid designation are listed and the reasons for their rejection are given. This catalogue contains all the genus-group names of the appropriate families included in Neave, 1939-1975, Nomenclator zoologicus 1-7, and in the Zoological Record \\x^ to and including volume 109 published in 1977. Relevant names from recent works published up to September 1978 have also been included. Subjective synonymy of genus-group names has not been included, except in the case of : (a) a junior homonym having no objective replacement name, or (b) two or more genera having type-species which are subjectively synonymous; such genus-group names have been cross-referenced by the phrase ‘See also Genus Author, date’. Where the type- species of a genus is a junior subjective synonym, its senior subjective synonym and reference is also included. Form of Entries Sequence The catalogue is arranged alphabetically. Junior homonyms, junior objective synonyms and names not nomenclaturally available are listed chronologically under their potentially valid name, and are also cross-referenced in the main alphabetical sequence. References Titles of journals have been abbreviated as in the World List of Scientific Periodicals (Edn 4), 1963-1965. If the cited journal has not been included in the World List, abbreviations in the style of that work have been used. Nouns always start with a capital letter and adjectives usually start with a small letter. Abbreviations are followed by a full stop, but contractions are not. Titles of books and other non-serial works have also been abbreviated in the style of the World List, using the ‘Select List of Abbreviations’ published in volume 3 of that work. The full titles of journals may be found in the World List or in the List of Serial Publications in the British Museum {Natural History) Library (Edn 2), 1975. Most of the titles of books and of other non-serial works are in the Catalogue of Books, Manuscripts, Maps and Drawings in the British Museum {Natural History). Throughout this catalogue the term Commission refers to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature and the term Code refers to the International Code of Zoological Nomen- clature (Edn 2), 1964, with amendments 1974, Bull. zool. Nom. 31: 77-89. Dates Following Recommendation 22A of the Code, dates of publication have been cited in square brackets if they have been determined from external evidence and in parentheses if determined from evidence in the volume itself. These dates have usually been followed by those printed on the title-page to assist in finding the work in library catalogues. IX X GENERIC NAMES OE MOTHS OF THE WORLD Dates of publication given in Sherborn’s hulex Animaliwn and in the Catalogue of Books, Manu- scripts, Maps and Drawings in the British Museum {Natural History) have been adopted, except where bibliographical research has shown that changes should be made. Type-localities Names of countries are given in their current English form and are placed in square brackets when they have not been included with the original description. Where the modern name of a country differs from its perhaps better known, older name, the latter has been included in parentheses; for example, Sulawesi (Celebes). The Times Atlas of the World (Comprehensive Edn), 1968, has been used as a standard, except for those names changed since its date of publication; for example, Zaire in place of Congo Republic and Bangladesh in place of East Pakistan. Where no English equivalent can be given, the locality is cited as published in the original description; for example, Mndiis’ or Tndes Orientales’. Where the type-locality is not known or not stated with the original description, brief notes on the current distribution of the species are given. Unavailable names Unavailable names, that is names which are not nomenclaturally available under the provisions of the Code, are preceded by a double dagger (|) and reasons for their rejection are given. Names recorded in Neave, Nomenciator zoologicus as ‘(pro A-us Author, date)’ usually lack positive indication as to whether the names are misspellings without nomenclatural availability or whether they are emendations with nomenclatural availability. All such entries have been checked and the correct status given. A number of manuscript names have been included as \"Genus Author, no published reference found’. These are genus-group names placed in the Rothschild collection of Geometridae by Warren and in the BMNH collection of Geometridae by Prout, the latter having intended to describe such genera as new in Seitz, Die Gross-Schmetterlinge der Erde. Dates of some Important Publications Agassiz, E. 1842-1847 Nomenciator zoologicus, continens Nomina systematica Generum Animalium tarn viventium quam fossilium. 4to. The work consists of twelve quarto sized fascicles published in eight parts, each part in a dated wrapper. The title-page of the work is dated 1842-1846, but the dated wrappers of the parts span the years 1842-1847. Photocopies of the dated wrappers were kindly sent by Dr W. D. Myers of the Agassiz Museum at Harvard University, U.S.A.; these have now been placed with the copies of the Nomen- ciator zoologicus in the BMNH library. For convenience of reference the parts which include Insecta are tabulated below, together with their dates of publication. Wrapper Title-page Fascicle date date Contents Nomina syst. Generum Anim. 3 -f 4 in one wrapper 1843 Not dated Hemiptera 5 + 6 in one wrapper 1844 Not dated Neuroptera Orthoptera 7 -b 8 in one wrapper 1845 Not dated Hymenoptera Addenda to: Hemiptera Neuroptera Orthoptera 9 4- 10 in one wrapper 1846 Not dated Lepidoptera Strepsiptera Diptera Thysanura Thysanoptera 1 1 1846 Not dated Coleoptera 12 1847 1846 Index universalis As will be seen from the above table, the ‘Index universalis’, dated 1847 on the wrapper, includes a title-page dated 1846. An explanatory note pasted to the front end paper in one of the two copies in the Agassiz Museum reads ‘However, the title page bound with the fascicle [fascicle 12] itself bears GENERIC NAMES OF MOTHS OF THE WORLD XI the date 1846. Apparently this title page was among those supplied in 1846, and fascicle XII, intended to be published in 1846, [was] not actually published until 1847’. The ‘Index universalis’ was republished in 1848 in octavo size. Notes on fascicles 9, 10 and 12 of Agassiz’s Nomenclator zoologicus were published by Cowan, 1970, Annotationes Rhopalocerologicae 1970: 14. Felder, C., Felder, R. & Rogenhofer, A. F. 1864-1875 Reise der dsterreichisclien Fregatte Novara um die Erde (Zoologischer Theil) Band 2 (Abtheilung 2). Abtheilung 2 was devoted to Lepidoptera and was published in five Hefte; Hefte 1-3 were by Felder, C. & Felder, R. and included the Rhopalocera, Hefte 4 and 5 were by Felder, C. & Rogenhofer, A. F. and included the Heterocera. Some confusion exists in the literature concerning the dates of publication of the plates of this work. The plates themselves each bear two dates, the date when the plate was drawn and the date purporting to be that of publication. For example, plate 75 is inscribed ‘del Febr. 1867. edit 1868’ [delineavit Febr. 1867, edita 1868; that is, drawn February 1867, published 1868] and plate 137 is inscribed ‘del. 1869. edit Decbri 1874’. That some of Felder’s Heterocera plates, together with their legends, were circulated before the dates of publication of the two Hefte in which they were issued is evident from Boisduval’s Consider- ations Lepidopteres envoyes du Guatemala a M. de VOrza published in 1870. On pages 66-99 of the work Boisduval attributed to Felder six generic and seventeen specific names, previously unpublished, and cited nine plates (75, 77, 78, 101-106; plate 108 was cited in error for 103) on which the species were illustrated in Heft 4 of the Reise Novara. Butler, 1871, Ann. Mag. nat. Hist. (4) 8: 290, stated that he had received a letter from Rudolph Felder dated 5 August 1869 in which he advised Butler that he would soon receive ‘provisional copys of our Heteroc. plates’. Butler added that shortly after receiving the letter he received uncoloured proofs of 46 plates; plates 75-107 were lettered, the remainder unlettered. As far as Butler could ascertain the part of the Reise Novara containing these plates was not then available. No record or wrapper has been traced to suggest that the Heterocera plates were published in parts smaller than the two Hefte 4 and 5, so it is therefore probable that Boisduval, like Butler, obtained Reise der dsterreichisclien Fregatte Novara um die Erde (Zoologischer Theil) Band 2 (Abtheilung 2) Heft Contents Date printed on wrapper of Heft Date printed on title-page of Heft Spitzka Higgins Date adopted in this catalogue 1 RHOPALOCERA Pis 1-21 (with names at foot of each plate) and pp. 1-136 1864 (Higgins copy) 1865 (BM copy) Undated 1864 [12. i. 1865] [12.i.l865] 2 RHOPALOCERA Pis 22-47 (with names at foot of each plate) and jp. 137-378 1865 1865 1865 [post X.] 1865 [post X.] 1865 3 RHOPALOCERA Pis 48-74 (with names at foot of each plate) and pp. 379-536 1867 1866-Marz 1867 1866 [25. iv.] 1867 [25. iv.] 1867 4 RHOPALOCERA Inhalts-Verzeichniss to pis 1-74: pp. 1-9 HETEROCERA Pis 75-107 (with names at foot of each plate) Pis 108-120 (with names in Erklarung facing each plate) November 1874 November 1874 1874 [7. i. 1875] [31.xii.] 1874 5 HETEROCERA Pis 121-140 (with names in Erklarung facing each Juni 1875 Juni 1875 Juni 1875 July 1875 [or later] July 1875 (from plate; pi. 121 with its title-page names also printed at of Band 2 foot) (Abtheilung 2)) Erklarung to pis 75-107: pp. 1-10 Inhalts-Verzeichniss to pis 108-140: pp. 1-20 GENERIC NAMES OE MOTHS OE THE WORLD xii privately provisional proof copies of Felder’s plates and their legends prior to their publication in Vienna in 1874 and 1875. The Felder names used by Boisduval in 1870 are treated as Felder un- published manuscript names and their authorship attributed to Boisduval. In 1877 Johann Spitzka, accountant to the Royal Academy of Science in Vienna, the body responsible for the publication of the Reise Novara, published a twelve-page pamphlet listing all the parts of the work, their contents and dates of publication; a copy of the pamphlet is in the library of the BMNH. Some of Spitzka’s dates have, however, been shown to be incorrect. Dr L. G. Higgins, 1963, J. Soc. Biblphy nat. Hist. 4: 153-159, listed dates of publication of the five Lepidoptera Hefte, basing his conclusions on the study of two copies of Abtheilung 2 in their original Heft wrappers and upon data from the Sber. Akad. Wiss. Wien, the journal that included accounts of the meetings of the Royal Academy of Science in Vienna. The publication of many of the Hefte of the Reise Novara was announced at the Society’s meetings, but no announcement was made for the two Lepidoptera Hefte, numbers 2 and 5. The dates of publication suggested by Dr Higgins have been adopted for use in this catalogue, with the exception of that proposed for Heft 4. The cover of Heft 4 is dated 1874, its title-page, November 1874; its publication was not, however, announced until 7 January 1875, but as no meeting of the Society was held between 17 December 1874 and 7 January 1875, the Heft could well have been published in December 1874. The evidence for accepting 1875 as the year of publication of Heft 4 is inconclusive and insufficient to justify a change from the currently accepted 1874. In this catalogue [31 December] 1874 has been adopted as the date of publication of Heft 4. For convenience of reference the accompanying table has been prepared, listing briefly the contents of each Heft and the date of publication adopted in this catalogue. For fuller information Dr Higgins’ paper should be consulted. Herrich-Schaffer, G. A. W. 1843-1856 Systematische Bearbeitung der Schmetterlinge von Europa. The work consists of six volumes that were published in 69 Hefte.

Hemming, 1937, Hiibner 1: 579-589, tabulated the contents and year of publication of all 69 Hefte, deriving his data from notes compiled by J. H. Durrant from a copy in original wrappers in the British Library. Durrant’s manuscript notes in the BMNH record that the wrapper of Heft 66 is dated ‘April 1855’, Heft 67 ‘Juli 1855’ and Heft 68 ‘Ende Dezember 1855’. Herrich-Schaffer, G. A.

The work was published in two volumes. Volume 1 contains 84 pages of text and 120 coloured plates. The plates were issued in two separately numbered series: Series I, plates 1-96, illustrate Heterocera (Nachtfalter) and were published in 26 Hefte; Series 11, plates 1-24, illustrate Rhopalocera (Tagfalter) and were published in six, possibly seven, Hefte. Volume 2 was published in one Heft in 1869; it contains four pages of text and eight coloured plates, the continuation of the plates of volume 1 in the same two series. Series I plates 97-100 and Series II plates 25-28. Only the first two Hefte of Series II appear to have been published with the wrappers and title-pages in German; Hefte 1 and 2 of Series I and subsequent Hefte of both Series were published with Latin and French titles, the former on the left side, the latter on the right side of the front page of the wrapper. The names of the species illustrated on the plates enclosed in each Heft, together with their localities, were usually printed on the back page of each wrapper; with rare exceptions the wrappers are undated. There are some discrepancies in the dates of publication attributed by bibliographers to volume 1, the title-page of which is dated 1850-1858. Volume 1 (Series I), which includes the plates of Lepidoptera Heterocera, was issued in 26 Hefte. The dates of publication of the Hefte have been recorded by Gerstaecker, 1854, Arch. Naturgesch. 20 (2): 263; 1855, ibidem 21 (2); 241; 1856, ibidem 22 (2): 266 and 1857, ibidem 23 (2): 431-433, 439-441 ; by Wuttig, 1860, Kayser's Bucher- Lex. 13: 430; by Zuchold, [1854], Bihlthca hist.-nat. 4: 120; [1855], ibidem 5: 21 ; [1856], ibidem 6 (1): 24 and [1857], ibidem 6 (2): 140-141 ; by Cams & Englemann, 1861, Biblthca zool. 2: 576; by Herrich-Schaffer himself, 1869, CorrespBl. zool.-min.

Troppau 1 (2): 1-2 and by Horn & Schenkling, 1928, Index Lit. ent. 2: 546. Wuttig recorded that 25 Hefte were issued by 1856 and the issue of the Schluss-Heft, Heft 26, in 1858 to complete the work. Gerstaecker recorded the issue of 25 Hefte by 1856, with the text still incomplete. Woodward recorded the work as complete in 25 Hefte. There is general agreement on the years of publication of Hefte 1-17, which included plates 1-68, figures 1-390; these were published in the years 1853-1855. The first twelve Hefte each consisted of four plates with the names of the species that were illustrated and their localities printed on the back xin Herrich-Schaffer, 1850- [1869] 1850-1858, Sammlung neuer oder wenig bekannter aussereuropdischer Schmetterlinge Dates of Publication O o £^2 0=3 c K S XT3 g; a E tj o Qh S.2 S, a-S^ !§ c 5 O— ' M ^ -a-a t« T3 u « o.

Dalla Torre dated plates 1-3 ‘before July 1853’ and plates 4-16 ‘July 1853’; the legend to plates 1-4 was, however, published entire on one wrapper. Evidently ‘1-3’ and ‘4-16’ are errors for ‘1-4’ and ‘5-16’. Hefte 18-22, which included plates 69-79, figures 391-458, were variously dated 1855 and 1856 by different bibliographers; the precise contents of each of the five Hefte have not yet been established. Available evidence suggests that Woodward’s grouping and dating of Hefte 13-22 (plates 49-88) as 1855 and his grouping of Hefte 23-24 (plates 89-94) were mistaken, for fifteen plates (80-94) were issued in Hefte 23-25 in 1856. The Heft or Hefte which contained plates 71-78, figures 404-451, were issued in one wrapper with the legend printed in a single column on the back page; this is the only dated wrapper of volume 1 (Series I) so far located. At its head is a note which states that ‘The names of those species figured on plates 69, 70, 79-82 follow with the next parts, in which will also be included the text, corrections and indices. Regensburg d. 31. Dec. 1855’; at its foot was added ‘Textbogen A-G’ [pages 1-52]. The inference is that plates 69-82 were issued simultaneously; eight (71-78) with relevant legends, the remaining six, 69, 70, 79-82, without legends and that the first fifty-two pages of the text accompanied them, but this is not supported by subsequent evidence. According to Gerstaecker (1857; 431) the first part of the text, fifty-two pages, was issued in 1856 together with fifteen plates in Hefte 23-25. The fifteen plates were 80-94 and the legend to them was printed in double column on one wrapper. It seems probable therefore that Hefte 18-22 included plates 71-78 with their legend printed in single column on their wrapper and plates 69, 70 and 79 without legends; plates 80-82 and Textbogen A-G were not issued then, but were included with Hefte 23-25 in 1856. No printed legend has yet been found to plates 69, 70 or 79, so the names of the species illustrated on them should be dated from the text. A foot-note published first in 1855, Syst. Bearbeilung Schmett. Eur. 6: 86 and subsequently in [1856], Samml. neuer oder wenig bekannter aussereur. Schmett. 1; 6, stated with reference to Series I of the latter work that ‘up to now 516 figures on 90 plates have appeared’. Page 86 of volume 6 was included in Heft 68 of the European work which, according to Herrich-Schaffer (1869: 214) and to wrapper evidence, was published in 1855. The last Heft of the aussereur. Schmett. to be published in 1855, in a wrapper dated 31 December 1855, included plates 71-78 (figures 391-476) with legend and, by inference, plate 69, 70, 79-82 without legend (see above). Further, wrapper evidence shows that plate 90 did not conclude a Heft, but that it appeared in a sequence which ended with plate 94, for the legends to plates 80-94 (figures 459-540) were printed on one wrapper. A possible explanation of the foot-note is that at the time 516 figures on 90 plates had been printed, but not necessarily issued. A foot-note on the wrapper of the Heft that included plates 80-94 stated that with Heft 26 [Schluss-Heft] the work would be completed and that with it the title and relevant text would be issued. According to Wuttig (1860: 430), the Schluss-Heft which included the second part of the text, pages 53-84, and four plates [numbers not stated] was issued in 1858. Volume 1 (Series II) which included the plates of Lepidoptera Rhopalocera was issued in at least five Hefte; Woodward (1922: 458) differs from other bibliographers in recording the issue of the plates in seven Hefte. Heft 5 evidently included plates [19-22], for Gerstaecker (1857: 431) recorded the issue of the part and discussed the species illustrated on them on pages 440 and 441 of the same article; Woodward referred these plates to Hefte 5 and 6. Plates [23] and [24] recorded by Woodward as Heft 7 were evidently published without a legend on the wrapper; the sole new species illustrated, Euriphene senegalensis Herrich-Schaffer, should be dated from the text. According to Herrich-Schaffer (1869: 214), volume 2 was published in August 1869 and all biblio- graphers appear to have accepted that date. The accompanying table summarises the available evidence of the dates of publication so far examined and records the dates that have been adopted in this catalogue. Hubner, J. 1786-1842 The dates cited in this catalogue are taken from Hemming, 1937, Hubner volumes 1 and 2. Seitz, A. 1906-1954 Die Gross-Schmetterlinge der Erde (German Edition) and The Macrolepidoptera of the World (English Edition). The dates of publication cited for Seitz are those printed at the top of the first page of each eight-page signature. Where the dates of the eight-page signatures differ in the German and English editions, the earlier has been cited and the later noted in a comment. The signature dates have been adopted in preference to those listed by Griffin, 1936, Trans. R. ent. Soc. Land. 85: 243-280, which are the dates of receipt of the parts in London. Stephens, J.

Werny, K. 1966 Untersuchungen iiber die Systematik der Tribus Thyatirini, Macrothyatirini, Habrosynini und Tetheini (Lepidoptera Thyatiridae). (Doctoral Thesis). Karl Werny’s thesis for a doctorate in natural sciences, submitted to the University of Saarbriicken in 1966, was reproduced by Rotaprint-Olfset ensuring identical copies, printed by ink on paper and was freely available from the author and from the university; it thus satisfied the criteria of publication as defined in the Code, Article 8. The work was recorded, together with the new taxa and new combinations that it contained, by Clark, J. et al., in Vevers, 1973, Zool. Rec. 105 (B 13): 274, 599, 600. The four new generic names and any relevant type-species designations contained in the work have been included in this catalogue. Homonymy Names that have been proposed expressly to replace junior homonyms, and junior objective synonyms that have been used for the same purpose, are referred to in this catalogue as objective replacement names. Junior subjective synonyms that have been used to replace preoccupied senior synonyms are referred to as subjective replacement names. Of the 3680 nomenclaturally available generic names included in this catalogue 247 were found to be junior homonyms. Objective replacement names are available for 144; the type-species of each of the remaining homonyms has been studied and wherever it was possible to find a genus with a type-species congeneric with that of the homonym, then the latter has been placed as a subjective synonym of it. There remained, however, 35 for which there is neither an objective nor a subjective replacement name and new names have been proposed for these genera. A list of the new names has been included in a ‘Summary of new genus-group names proposed’. Misidentified Type-species Under Article 70 of the Code it is to be assumed that an author has correctly identified the nominal species that he (1) referred to a new genus when he proposed it, or (2) designated as type-species of a new or established genus. In this catalogue there are several genera having type-species now known to be based on mis- identified specimens; in each case not decided upon by the Commission, the misidentification has been corrected and the reasons for doing so have been given; the correct species has been cited with the misidentification in synonymy. Several of the type-species are well known in the European fauna and have been illustrated several times; less well known species from other regions are illustrated on Frontispieces 1 and 2. Under Article 70(a) of the Code such cases should be referred to the Commission to designate as type-species whichever species will in its judgement best serve stability and uniformity in nomenclature. Family-group Names The family and subfamily names used in this catalogue are in the main universally used and only at subfamily level in the Geometridae does some confusion arise. Reasons for this are discussed below and a table is given summarising the classification used by authors at the turn of the century and during the past seventy years.

Drepanidae was confirmed as the correct family-group name by the Commission in 1961, Bull. zool. Nom. 18 Opinion 610; 267-269, when the family-group name Drepanidae (correction of Drepanulidi Boisduval [November] 1828) was placed on the Ojficial List of Family-Group Names in Zoology with Name No. 307 and Drepanulidi Boisduval [November] 1828 was placed on the Ojficial Index of Rejected and Invalid Family-Group Names in Zoology with Name No. 338. The Thyatiridae have been widely known as Cymatophoridae, but the type-genus Cymatophora Treitschke, 1825, is a junior homonym of Cymatophora Hiibner, [1812], in the Geometridae. Accord- ing to Article 39 of the Code ‘The name of a taxon of the family-group is invalid if the name of its nominal type-genus is a junior homonym’ and for that reason Thyatiridae is used in place of Cymatophoridae. The Geometridae have been known variously as Phalaenidae and as Geometridae, but under a Ruling by the Commission, 1957, Opin. Decl. int. Commn zool. Nom. 15; Opinion 450, the name Geometridae was declared to be the correct name for the family and it was placed on the Ojficial List of Family-Group Names in Zoology with Name No. 137. The subfamily names used in this catalogue are a combination of those that are mandatory and those that have the widest current use. The subfamily widely known as the Brephinae has been renamed Archiearinae. The type-genus of Brephinae is Brephos Hiibner, [1813]; its type-species is now known to be Phalaena Julia Cramer, 1775, in the Agaristidae. No subfamily name was available from the synonymy of Brephinae sensu auct. in the Geometridae, so the name Archiearinae was introduced by Fletcher, 1953, Acta zool. lilloana 13; 367.

Of the twelve other subfamily names in the literature associated with the Oenochrominae, the two names Monocteniadae proposed by Meyrick in 1889 and Orthostixidae proposed by Meyrick in 1892 have had the widest use. Oenochrominae, however, has had almost universal use during the past sixty years. The family-group name Alsophilinae proposed by Herbulot in 1962 has not been separated from the Oenochrominae in this catalogue. In Opinion 450 the Commission ruled Phalaena papilionaria Linnaeus, 1758, to be the type-species of the genus Geometra Linnaeus, 1758; thus the nominate subfamily name Geometrinae replaced Hemitheinae. Until the publication of Opinion 450 the subfamily had been almost universally known as Hemitheinae since the beginning of this century; prior to that period eight other subfamily names had been used for the group, or for parts of it. Haziidae introduced by Guenee in 1857 and Euschemidae introduced by Walker in 1862 each had wide use. If priority were to be applied to the naming of the subfamily now known as the Sterrhinae, proposed by Meyrick in 1892, and widely used during this century, the name Zonosominae proposed by White in 1876 and used since only by Kirby in 1903, would have to be adopted. The earlier and widely used Ephyridae and Acidaliidae are invalid because of the homonymy in each case of the type-genus. Eight other subfamily names were applied to this subfamily, or to parts of it, between 1881 and 1918. Rhodometrinae, proposed by Agenjo in 1951, has not been separated from the Sterrhinae in this catalogue. GENERIC NAMES OE MOTHS OE THE WORLD Comparative table of family-group names.

The subfamily was split by Warren in 1893 and 1894 into six separate groups, to each of which he accorded family rank. The largest of the subfamilies in the Geometridae, distinguished by the absence of vein M2 in the hind wing, has been split into at least twenty groups. Warren, 1893, 1894, recognized nineteen subfamilies; other authors have treated his subfamilies as tribes. The first name to be applied to this subfamily is Ennominae, proposed by Duponchel [1845]. The name Geometrinae was applied to it in volumes 4 and 16 of Seitz, Gross-Schmett. Erde, but since the publication of Opinion 450 in 1957, Geometrinae may no longer be used for this subfamily. The two comparative tables of family-group name usages summarize the classification of the families included in this catalogue in two standard works at the beginning of this century and in seven more recent works representing various parts of the world.

A junior homonym of Cymatophora Hubner, [1812] 1806, Samml. exot. Schmett. I: pi. [205] - Lepid. Geometridae and a junior objective synonym of Achlya Billberg, 1820. The generic name was listed by Duponchel as XCymatho- phora, an incorrect subsequent spelling. It is arguable that Cymatophora was proposed by Treitschke as an objective replacement name for Tethea Ochsenheimer, 1816, which Treitschke believed to be preoccupied by Tethya Lamarck, 1814 (Spongida) and which he cited as Tethya Donati, an incorrect authorship. If this argument is sustained, the type-species of Tethea would then be Phalaena flavicornis Linnaeus, 1758, designated by Duponchel for Cymatophora Treitschke, the objective replacement name, not Noctua or [Denis & Schiffermiiller], 1775, designated by Curtis four months later for Tethea. Tethea would thus become a senior objective synonym of Achlya Billberg, 1820, and Palimpsestis Hubner, 1821, would become the generic name available for those species currently included in Tethea. In the opinion of the author the interests of stability are better served by regarding Tethea Ochsenheimer, 1816, and Cymatophora Treitschke, 1825, as independent genera.
