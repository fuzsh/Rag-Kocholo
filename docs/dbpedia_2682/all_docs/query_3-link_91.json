        "text": "Intro to Insects\n\nInsects comprise the largest number of terrestrial animals on the planet. According to the Encyclopedia Smithsonian, there are 91,000 described species with 10 quintrillion (10,000,000,000,000,000,000) individuals alive on Earth!\n\nWith this many insects, it is no wonder that they play an important role in Earth’s ecosystem. Insects can be pests, competing with humans for resources, such as crops; yet other species, such as bees, wasps, and butterflies, are important pollinators of these same crops. Insects also are beneficial to us as biological control agents, killing or parasitizing pest insects; recycling decaying organic matter, including feces and carcasses; and serving as a primary food source in some countries. Insects can also be important medically…they can be used in maggot therapy to heal wounds or venom therapy, yet they can be vectors of serious diseases, such as Chagas, sleeping sickness, or malaria.\n\nWith so many interactions between mankind and insects, both negative and positive, these creatures deserve our respect. They may be small, but their impact on human interests can hardly be measured. This publication will provide information about using insects as educational tools as well as discuss the background, basic biology, and classification of insects. Then, in Appendix A, complete lesson plans are available for instructors to use in elementary classrooms or educational programs to teach children about the importance of these small creatures.\n\nTeaching with Insects\n\nBecause of the large diversity of insects, they can be used in many valuable ways in an educational setting. In addition to scientific topics, they can be used, through their appearance in many books and films, to teach moral lessons, basic life skills, and how insects are viewed in society.\n\nInsects are abundant, easy to obtain, and fairly inexpensive to rear and maintain. Most just require a small to medium sized terrarium with some bedding, water, and food. If properly cleaned and taken care of, insects can often survive for several generations (eggs hatch, go through their life cycle, mate, and lay more eggs) when you have a breeding population. See Appendix B for a list of the types of insects you can rear in your classroom.\n\nWhen teaching scientific concepts, educators should include Next Generation Science Standards in their curriculum. To help guide educators, lesson plans included in Appendix A will list in depth which standards each particular activity addresses. This includes the main content standard, science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts. See Table 1 for an example of Next Generation Science standards that might be covered in insect related curriculum.\n\nBefore developing and conducting your own educational program, you should have a good understanding about the biology and classification of insects, which you will want to discuss in your lessons. Let’s begin by giving a basic overview about insects and their roles in the environment.\n\nTable 1: Example of Next Generation Science Standards Used in Insect Curriculum\n\nInsect Classification\n\nAs with other living organisms, insects are placed in a hierarchical scientific classification structure:\n\nKingdom\n\nPhylum\n\nClass\n\nOrder\n\nFamily\n\nGenus\n\nSpecies\n\nThe diversity of insects is astounding, which becomes more apparent the narrower we go in the classification system. At its basic level, insects belong to the Kingdom Animalia, so in this they are related to mammals, birds, or amoebas. However, Phylum Arthropoda reduces their commonality with most other animals significantly.\n\nArthropods have distinct characteristics that assign them to this phylum. The three main ones include having an exoskeleton (hard shell on the outside of the body, as opposed to internal skeleton, as humans and many other animals have); segmented body; and jointed appendages. Insects do share these traits with some other common animals, such as crustaceans (lobsters and shrimp), millipedes, centipedes, and spiders. This brings us to the next level: Class.\n\nInsects belong, not surprisingly, to Class Insecta. This is where they diverge from related arthropods like spiders. Insects, for example, have three distinct body regions: a head, thorax, and abdomen. They also have six legs, arising from the middle body segment, or thorax, and a pair of antennae. Compare this to arthropods such as spiders (Class Arachnida), which have two body segments, eight legs, and no antennae, or millipedes (Class Diplopoda), which have numerous body segments, with a pair of legs on each segment.\n\nThe next classification level is Order. Here is where diversity is readily obvious. There are approximately 30 orders in Class Insecta (Figure 2). Some variation exists where scientists have proposed new or adapted orders to accommodate insects currently featured in their own orders but that share certain characteristics with other species (such as combining termites and cockroaches together where previously they were separated). Below is the current consensus for accepted Insect Orders.\n\nFigure 2: Insect Orders\n\nOf the insect orders, some of the more common include Blattodea, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Mantodea, Neuoptera, Orthoptera, Odonata, Pthiraptera, and Siphonaptera.\n\nGradual metamorphosis (Hemimetabolis):\n\nThis life cycle includes an egg, a nymph, and an adult. The nymph looks just like the adult only smaller, and eats the same foods. The difference between gradual and no metamorphosis is that nymphs have wing pads that grow with each molt and are fully formed in adulthood. Only adults are sexually mature."
