        "text": "Outside of my doctoral dissertation, this is the undertaking I am most proud of! My heartfelt gratitude to everyone involved!\n\n(Also grateful to Simon Peyton Jones and Hadi Partovi for previewing the book and providing advance acclaim for the back cover).\n\nAs teachers & members of the global CS education community become aware of the #A2ZK12CS handbook, and start to read it (or use it in various ways) as part of teacher PD, I figured Iâ€™d share some fun facts and stats ðŸ˜‰\n\nHow â€™bout some fun facts and stats ðŸ™‚\n\n8 years as an idea, 24 months in the (actual) making and this 300+ page handbook with 26 A-Z chapters is finally in print!\n\nTo me the stats most worth sharing: 40 contributors joined me on this wonderful journeyâ€”21 are women and 19 are men (woohoo!)â€”each one deeply engaged in K-12 CS education. These figures include Mark Guzdial who graciously authored the Forewordâ€”Inventing Computing Education in Schools.\n\nThe authors represent classrooms in 7 countriesâ€”USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Finland, and Switzerland.\n\nThe 26 chapters in A-to-Z alphabetical order address 10 foundational programming concepts, 4 key programming practices, and 12 well-researched pedagogies based on classroom practice and 3 decades of CS education and learning sciences research.\n\nThese chapters are color coded in orange for concepts, green for practices, and blue for pedagogies (in the color version of the book). They can be read in any sequence, but readers would benefit from starting with Chapter 11 (â€˜Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes, and Beliefs: Learning Goals for Introductory Programmingâ€™), Chapter 10 on programming languages, and Chapter 14 (â€˜NaÃ¯ve Conceptions of Novice Programmersâ€™)."
