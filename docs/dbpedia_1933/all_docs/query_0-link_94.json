Most of the time\n\nthey seem to lump anyone with any type of average into this great hitter category\n\nbut they aren't really consistent about it. Case in point is Garret Anderson\n\n(although I haven't really heard anyone go on and on about him lately). Even when\n\nhe hit .321 (probably his best season to date) I don't think that I could have\n\nconsidered him a great hitter by their definition, but they would. At the same\n\ntime I'm pretty sure those same people, if asked if Griffey was a great hitter\n\nwould have said yes he was too even in those years he hit .258 and .284. It's\n\nclear that Griffey has greater offensive value than Anderson but they would both\n\nhave been considered \"great\" by the media, with no distinction between the two in\n\nterms of power (or lack of). I think they have it already in their mind who is a\n\n\"great\" hitter and who is not. They probably attempt to rationalize it by using\n\nsome methodology of ballancing different abilities, but to me they just don't seem\n\nvery consistent with it.\n\nIn article <19990423134816...@ng-fs1.aol.com>, ra...@aol.com\n\n(Rae Wu) wrote:\n\n> The media always praises this guy as one of the greatest hitters ever.\n\n>\n\n> Career: (.339/.390/.458)\n\n> Last 3 years: (.350/.393/.501)\n\n>\n\n> Does Tony Gwynn deserved to be mentioned as one of the greatest hitters ever?\n\n> In my opinion, the answer is a resounding... no.\n\nOne of how many? Top 10? Top 50? Top 100? His career PRO+ of\n\n134 has him in the top 100, right up there with Al Kaline and\n\nPaul Waner (to mention some RFs). Not exactly over a short\n\ncareer, either. If those guys may be considered among the best\n\nhitters ever, then I see no reason not to say the same of\n\nGwynn.\n\nIs he \"the best hitter of his generation\"? No. But 'overrated'\n\nand 'not one of the greatest' are not the same thing.\n\n> Should Tony Gwynn be considered one of the best RF today? Again, I say no.\n\nToday, as in April 24, 1999? Certainly not. But over the past 20\n\nyears, who has been better? Jose Canseco and Darryl Strawberry\n\nhad their moments. Salmon, Ramirez, Gonzalez, Sosa, Walker,\n\nGuerrero, O'Neill, et. al may be better at the moment, but they're\n\nnot really Gwynn's contemporaries. Gwynn is still at least in the\n\ntop quartile as it is. Who else? Joe Carter?

I\n\nprobably left in a few who I shouldn't have as well. Remember, these\n\nare the numbers only from years they played at least one game in the\n\noutfield (Sheffield played a few at SS and 3B only).\n\nIn just OBP Gwynn would rank 8th (#1 is Scheffield at 434 although his\n\nis helped by the weaker years being at infield positions...#2 is Bonds\n\nat 411), but in Average he is #1 by a mile (339 vs 2nd place Kirby\n\nPuckett at 318 with Lofton the highest active player other than Gwynn\n\nat 311), and is #4 in games played (#1 is Rickey Henderson by 400\n\ngames over Tim Raines).\n\nSo, is it reasonable to say Gwynn is one of the best outfielders of\n\nthe past 20 years? I'd say yes as #8 in OBP over that time span is\n\nvery good and #1 in average (while it isn't the most valuable stat) is\n\nhard to ignore. 26th in OPS hurts, but since most of his value is in\n\nOBP you'd have to rank him higher I'd think, however using 1.5 times\n\nOBP + Slg he would be #22 so not a great jump.\n\nNot the greatest, but certainly a high caliber player.\n\nJohn Northey.\n\nCrazy Canadian and creator of the Fans of Teri Sue Wood site.\n\nhttp://www.sentex.net/~jnorthey/TSW\n\nJames C.

In the very helpful posting that\n\nlisted OPS for OF in the past 20 years, Tony Gwynn is obviously hurt by\n\nhis low SLG. High average, Lower than hoped for BBs, low SLG, extremely\n\nlow Ks. Why do I want to say #2 hitter?\n\nThis is where the all-purpose OPS bothers me. Tony's got less pop than\n\nWinfield, oh yes. And far more likely than DW to hit the ball\n\n*somewhere*. The hitters' role seems overlooked by this statistical\n\noverview, IMO.\n\nIf my leadoff guy never gets an extra-base hit but has a high OBA, he's\n\nstill a good leadoff hitter, isn;t he? more likely than Sheffield to\n\nstart an inning that leads to a run, just least base-productive per at\n\nbat.\n\nIf my #4 hitter never hits a single, but delivers hits that will clear\n\nthe bases, when he does hit, that's fulfilling his role, isn't it?\n\nI know that 'offensive sequence' goes out the window after the first\n\ninning, but there is still a value to having all types of hitters in\n\nyour lineups, I would guess. Singles and BBs with speed, Power and K's\n\nwith BBs, High Contact- Low BBs- No pop....I feel like we're looking at\n\napples and oranges.

I'd still take\n\nSheffield over Gwynn at every position in the lineup.\n\nArne\n\nAlan & Erin Williams wrote:\n\n>\n\n> James C.

Given the shorter length of seasons back when he was playing\n\nthat's remarkably valuable. TB also rates him as a great defensive\n\nplayer. If you want to take being in the HOF as qualification for the\n\nteam, I'd take Ricke Ferrell, who's overrated just by being in the Hall.\n\n\n\nzene...@wwa.com wrote:\n\n: On 27 Apr 1999 j...@socrates.berkeley.edu wrote:\n\n: > Thomas R Scudder (tom...@umich.edu) wrote:\n\n: > : Rules for eligibility: The player must be a Hall of Fame-caliber player,\n\n: > : but still overrated by the media and the fans.\n\n: >\n\n: > : RF: Gwynn (or Clemente)\n\n: > : CF: Dimaggio\n\n: > : LF: ???\n\n: Ralph Kiner.\n\nI'll join those who disagree.\n\nIMO, Kiner's reputation would be: solid HOFer, nothing more.

Rizzuto\n\nisn't a HoFer, the Yankee mystique isn't enough for him.\n\nInteresting discussion. The nomination of Ryan for overrated HOF pitcher is\n\nhard to argue with. I will agree with the posts that also suggested Gibson\n\ndeserves mentioning. I am always impressed by the impression (to use a\n\nredundant phrase) that Gibson seems to have left on people who watched baseball\n\nin the 1960s -- when I suggest to those folks that Marichal was at least his\n\nequal, this is often dismissed out of hand as a possibility, and Gibson is also\n\nfrequently described as being greater than Seaver, which I have trouble seeing\n\nat all.\n\nAs a Bucs' fan, I have to admit that Clemente's mystique also surpasses his\n\nactual playing greatness, especially among casual fans. I am often surprised\n\nby how often Clemente's name comes up in trivia contests -- I might throw out a\n\nquestion about some home run record and the answers will come back -- Mays,\n\nAaron, Clemente -- there are a surprising amount of folks, casual fans, who do\n\nnot by any stretch have an accurate picture of his skills, and think that he\n\nwas the all-around power-supplemented offensive package that a Mays or Aaron or\n\na Robinson was.\n\nHad you asked me as a kid who was the more effective hitter, Clemente or\n\nStargell, I'd have named Clemente without a second thought. I see now in\n\nretrospect that most of us undervalued how devastating a hitter Stargell really\n\nwas, and overrated the value of Clemente's offense, great though it was.\n\nClemente was actually a pretty mediocre hitter in many of his early seasons.\n\nClearly Clemente's untimely death and his proud demeanor have added to his\n\nmystique, and I will say that there is no player I have ever seen who was\n\nsimply more \"awe-inspiring\" to watch. This is quite different from saying that\n\nhe was as great or effective as he seemed. But for a long time early in his\n\ncareer he was thought of as something of a sullen malingerer and hypochondriac,\n\nbut the 1971 Series followed by his death completed a sudden and irreversible\n\ntransformation of that image.\n\nDoes this \"overrated but HOF-caliber\" team need a manager? Should I bring up\n\nCasey Stengel again or is there a more obvious candidate?\n\ndkeisen writes:\n\nYaz was the best hitter in the American League over the last\n\nhalf of the sixties. He seems to be underrated here which makes\n\nme think it's unlikely he's overrated in general.\n\n(end excerpt)\n\nThis suggests another topic: Players who are underrated by the likes of us,\n\nbecause we get so used to telling other people that they aren't as great as\n\neveryone thinks they are that we forget the quality they actually had.\n\nYaz is not a bad example -- very high peak in the low offense late1960s that is\n\neasily forgotten.\n\nSomeone else mentioned Ripken and how truly valuable he was for a time as a\n\nterrific combination of offensive and defensive value.\n\nDon't throw things at me but I would put Pete Rose in this category. Take a\n\nseason like his 1968 in the offensive context in which it occurred and it's\n\njust a fine fine season, no getting around it.

Funny, I never really thought about whether Cox would\n\ngo into the HOF. He's been very prominent in recent years but if he retired\n\ntomorrow I doubt he'd be in, though I have only gut instinct to go on for that.\n\nI was actually thinking in terms of historical greats on the managers.

Moreover, his stats\n\ncompared to his contemporaries look worse and worse. 396 HRs aren't much\n\nof an argument *now*, and by the time he's eligible, it won't look\n\nimpressive at all. Outfielders who hit .259 don't make the Hall.\n\nThe only thing in his favor is that HR, but it didn't seem to help Maz.\n\n\n\nIn article <Pine.GSO.3.96.99042...@blaze.accessone.com>,\n\nIvan Weiss <iv...@blaze.accessone.com> wrote:\n\n> On Mon, 26 Apr 1999, Jay wrote:\n\n>\n\n> > Samson wrote:\n\n> >\n\n> > > > >3B: Brooks Robinson\n\n> > > > >C: ???\n\n> > > >\n\n> > > > Yogi Berra.

Maybe. Maybe not. It's not as though he was\n\nout of their league, though, and yet his number has been\n\nretired in every stadium in baseball. That's 'overrated.'\n\nWas Yogi Berra better than Gabby Hartnett? Again, it may\n\nbe too close to call, but ask the average baseball fan\n\nwhat position each played, what team they played for, or\n\nif they've even heard the name 'Gabby Hartnett', and\n\nmost will know much more about Berra than Hartnett. That's\n\n'overrated.'\n\nAnyway, both Berra and Robinson were involved in the most\n\noverplayed bad call by an umpire, in which I *have* seen them\n\nplay (for a moment).

Ted\n\nWilliams, Stan Musial, and... Joe DiMaggio, maybe. That's an awfully\n\nshort list.\n\n"
