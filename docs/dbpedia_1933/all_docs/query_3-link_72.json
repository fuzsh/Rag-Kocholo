        "text": "Since most common counting stats (Runs, Home Runs, RBIs, Stolen Bases, and Strikeouts) are easy to predict (75–80% accurate) this article will examine corrections you can make to improve on projections. We start with a little greater depth on the tougher to predict ratio stats of Batting Average and On-Base Plus Slugging Percentage, which were under 40% accurate.\n\nRatio Stats\n\nRatio stats are complex, both to project and to utilize toward fantasy success. If you insist, here is the analysis of key ratio stats.\n\nBatting Average\n\nBatting average is tricky and generally an unreliable stat to rely on for fantasy purposes. The difference between a good batting average (.300) and a bad one (.250) is very slight. Assume you and your opponent have exactly 200 at bats in a given week — the spread between a great and a poor team is a narrow range of 50 to 60 hits. Looking at at typical league, the difference between the median team and a very high batting average team is about .015, or just three hits. Over the course of 20 weeks of such matchups, here’s a typical distribution:\n\nIn this simulation the high batting average won in 11/20 weeks. In other words, if you used all your draft points on phenomenal hitters, you would only snag one extra win per year.\n\nEven worse, the projections for batting average are poor, showing just a 34% correlation between pre-season expectations and actual performance. The dotted line is reserved for those whose projection was exactly correct, the blue line is the best-fit linear trendline.\n\nA pattern is visible but it’s a bit of a jumble. For comparison, here’s what this looks like with home runs, a stat that shows 76% correlation between projections and results.\n\nConsider how absurdly tough this makes it to compete on batting average. Each week you are trying to thread the needle by squeezing out an extra five hits from 200 odd at-bats, yet you’re working off projections that are about 30% accurate. Do you dare continue?\n\nBatting Average Regression Analysis\n\nThe best regression I could find was able to generate slight improvement on the projections. The best formula starts with the projected average, bumps it up slightly for raw number of hits projected, and bumps it down slightly for expected number of plate appearances.\n\nPerhaps the model is finding that hitters bat too often will themselves regress? Or maybe the projections are underweighting raw hitting ability. At any rate, the performance boost it provides over the baseline projections provides detectable improvement on the holdout group, though the effect here is slight:\n\nThe model did better with the edge case of Jose Martinez, the outlying dot in the upper left of the first graph, who was projected for .209 but actually slashed a hundred points higher. Our adjustment had him twenty points higher. However, our model was overly bullish on Rougned Odor (the point in the bottom right of the second graph), who the model was overly bullish on.\n\nSadly, the improvement gains came primarily from better identifying poor hitters. There’s still a discomfiting cluster of batters who ended above .300 that this model was overly bearish on, in fact predicting them worse than the baseline projections. This cluster includes hitters such as Jeimer Candelario, Josh Reddick, Tommy Pham, and Ozzie Albies. If any reader of this is more a baseball fan than I am, they could tell me what common threads unite such players for the purposes of better identifying breakouts.\n\nOther Factors\n\nUnfortunately, the above model is even less useful because it pushes players with lower plate appearances. If you are actually trying to win batting average, you need not just high average batters but high average batters who have a lot of plate appearance. If you are trying to balance out 2017 Rougned Odor (.204 AVG on 607 at bats), you will need two Howie Kendricks (.315 on 334 at bats) since he is resting every other game. A model that tells you to fade the guy with a high batting average because they’re at the plate too often will get you Howie.\n\nWe briefly run through various factors that, when regressed with batting average, provided a statistically significant improvement at predicting batting average. The following factors had a t-value under 0.2, which is a higher than desireable but has to suffice because batting average is so tough to predict. You might consider these as tie-breaking factors if you are evaluating two hitters with similar projected averages.\n\nProjected Runs: t-value of 0.16\n\nProjected Stolen Bases: 0.15\n\nProjected Triples: 0.14\n\nADP: 0.11\n\nProjected Doubles: 0.11\n\nIntentional Bases on Balls: 0.06\n\nProjected Singles: 0.05\n\nAll of these factors are positively correlated (except of course ADP, where lower is better.), and all did OK in a regression predicting batting average (though not as good as the above formula). It’s not immediately obvious why steals artists would bat better than expected, but that’s the fun of sabermetrics.\n\nSlugging Percentage\n\nOur league scores OBP, but realistically the on-base percentage is heavily overshadowed by slugging percentage. That is to say, if you stacked your team with high on-base percentage people you will lose this stat every time against the person who has a high slugging percentage. By itself the slugging percentage projections are about 40% correlated with results, better than average but it still needs some work. Here’s what you can use instead:\n\nAgain, younger guys are likely to give you a slight bump to this stat. Unfortunately for those who are trying to achieve a balanced team, a high batting average correlates poorly with a high slugging percentage. This makes some sense, when you watch the power guys get up to bat they like to strike out a lot. Finally, the weighted runs above average stat did an ok job of improving slugging percentage, and while it looked less significant it did perform well on the holdout group so I include it here.\n\nCounting Stats\n\nThe remainder of the stats did pretty good in terms of projections, generally around 80% correlation. We briefly tick through where you could eke out improvements\n\nAt Bats\n\nThe total number of At Bats a player gets in the season is critical to both your average stats and every counting stat they may produce. Technically plate appearances are better to look at, but the effect was ultimately the same here. You need to know who is likely to stay injury free, out of the minor leagues, and have the fewest rest days.\n\nFortunately, “at bat” projections were quite good, getting 80% correlation with reality without any adjustments. Here’s a few corrections you can use to improve on this.\n\nBatters projected to hit 3rd in the lineup were strongly likely to exceed their number of at bats. Younger people were also significantly likely to bat more often, by a factor of nearly 3 at bats per year. ADP also seemed a useful factor but was not as predictive when applied to the holdout group.\n\nRuns\n\nThe most important stat in theory, if you could predict this perfectly you could predict the outcome of every ball game. As it stands you can get about 77% of the way from season-long run projections.\n\nYounger players are likely to outperform, knocking off almost 2/3 of a run per year of age. A higher projected strikeout rate may also affect run projections at a rate of roughly 1 run per 12 projected strikeouts.\n\nAlso consider the weighted runs above average, which proved a positive factor here. This term did not play nicely with K_proj so it got dropped in the final model due to the fact K-proj performed better on the holdout group.\n\nRBIs\n\nA number of factors appeared significant at adjusting RBI projections. The terms in the aggregate model each showed small improvement on the holdout group, but more rigorous stress testing is useful given the complexity of this model.\n\nAge was the most significant negative factor, discounting 3/4 of an RBI per year of age. Stolen bases were the second strongest factor, also counting against RBIs. One could surmise that base stealers are more likely to sit at the top of the roster and therefore have fewer RBI chances, but it is unusual that this would not be incorporated into the projections. ADP and strikeouts also appear as factors.\n\nHome Runs\n\nAge appears again as a critical factor, knocking off nearly a third of a home run per year of age. A two percent bump also applies to players likely to play first base.\n\nStolen Bases\n\nA lot of factors appeared to correlate significantly with steals. Model complexity is generally a bad sign so take these with a grain of salt.\n\nA higher number of projected strikeouts was a negative factor again. A high number of projected triples was a positive correction, which is a sensible measure of speed and hitting for some reason not accounted for by stolen base projections.\n\nADP and BABIP rounded out the list of other possible factors. The FanGraphs Base Running and Ultimate Base Running scores also looked to be good predictors and appeared as significant factors in other models with similar AIC, but did not get included in the final model.\n\nStrikeouts\n\nWho is likely to strike out the most? Again, the strikeout projections are already pretty good. It’s notable that ADP was the most significant factor in nearly every pitching stat, but only on strikeouts does it show such strong correlation. It’s also interesting that the higher draft positions appear to strike out more frequently than expected. When you spend your draft picks on the top sluggers, don’t be surprised if they are striking out more than you hoped.\n\nOther reasonable factors that could adjust strikeout rate are walks (players who are good at drawing walks are less likely to strike out than their projections may indicate) and higher batting averages (also less likely). First basemen had a tendency to strike out more often than expected, perhaps the same cohort of first basement who overperformed their home runs. Similarly, players with a high slugging percentage also struck out a little more than their projections.\n\nPost-Game Analysis\n\nThere’s a lot to digest here, so here are the high level takeaways to considerwhen you are reviewing hitter projections for your fantasy baseball drafts.\n\nHitter counting stats projections are quite reliable and can be trusted without a lot of additional adjustments.\n\nWhen in doubt, opt for the younger hitter over the older hitter\n\nPlayers who strike out frequently are more likely to disappoint in other categories."
