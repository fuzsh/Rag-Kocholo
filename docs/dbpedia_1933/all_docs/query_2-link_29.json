        "text": "COLBERT COUNTY\n\nOriginally settled as early as 1810 and part of Franklin County, Colbert County was created by the Alabama Legislature on February 6, 1867. It was abolished by the constitutional convention on November 29, 1867, and re-established by the legislature on FebÂ­ruary 24, 1870. Colbert County is located in the northwestern part of the state. It encompasses approximately 600 square miles. The county was named after George and Levi Colbert, noted Chickasaw chiefs who resided in the county. It is bordered by Lauderdale, Lawrence, and Franklin Counties, Mississippi, and the Tennessee River. An election in 1870 established the county seat at Tuscumbia. Colbert County was the birthplace of Helen Keller.\n\nCourthouse:\n\n201 North Main Street,\n\nTuscumbia, AL 35674\n\n256-386-8542\n\nProbate Judge: Daniel Rosser\n\nSheriff: Eric Balentine\n\nCircuit Clerk: Mark Eady\n\nDistrict Attorney: Hal Houston\n\nRevenue Commissioner: Tommy Oswalt\n\nCounty Commissioners:\n\nTommy Barnes (R) - District 1\n\n3414 E 18th Ave. Sheffield, AL 35660\n\nPhone: 256-284-5852\n\nW.
