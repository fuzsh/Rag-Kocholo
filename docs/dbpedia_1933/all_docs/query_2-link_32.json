        "text": "Fort Worth, TX - The search for the next leader of Charger Football is over as Keller ISD Director of Athletics Eric Persyn and Central Principal Dr. Liz Russo announced Eric Vance will become just the third Head Coach in Charger Football history. Vance takes over for Mike Sports who departed the program this winter after serving as the head coach for four seasons. Vance brings a wealth of experience to the table, having played SEC football at Vanderbilt where he was a four-year starter and team captain for the Commodores. He continued his playing career after breaking into the NFL as an undrafted free agent in 1997, playing in the league for six seasons as a member of the San Diego Chargers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and New England Patriots.\n\nAt the conclusion of his playing career, Vance immediately dove into education, teaching for three years at Robinson High School in Tampa Bay, where he was voted the 2005 Ida S. Baker Distinguished Minority Educator of the Year. The NFL came calling again in 2006, as Vance returned to the Buccaneers, this time as the Director of Player Development. While with the Bucs, he coordinated transition for all new player signees, and ultimately developed and implemented \"Buccaneer University\", which taught players financial education and skills for career transitions, while helping with degree completion and other off-field issues. Additionally, he assisted coaches with daily practice activities and game-day charting, and served as the main liaison between players and the community relations department.\n\nStaying in the Sunshine State, Vance made the jump from the NFL to College football when he joined the staff at the University of Miami in 2013 as the assistant director of football operations.\n\nA Texas native and graduate of L.D. Bell High School, Vance found his way back to the Lone Star state in 2015 when he joined the coaching staff at Southlake Carroll, before moving onto fellow district four opponents Byron Nelson (2016-20). Vance would get his first shot at being a coordinator in 2020 when he moved to Chisholm Trail. After just one season with the Trail Rangers, Vance's Alma Mater came calling when TJ Dibble became the new Blue Raiders Head Coach, and Vance would be named Defensive Coordinator on Dibble's staff where he's served up until now.\n\nAs part of Dibble's staff, Vance was a key architect in turning the fortunes of the Blue Raiders program around as L.D. Bell saw incremental growth across his three seasons, rising from a 2-8 record in 2021, to a 6-4 record in 2022, and finally a 7-3 record this past fall. The Blue Raiders seven victories was equivalent to the total number of wins across the four seasons prior to Vance's arrival and their best record since 2013.\n\nCentral Principal Dr. Liz Russo had the following to say on bringing Vance in to lead the program: \"It is with great excitement that I welcome Coach Vance to Central High School! We are thrilled to have someone of this caliber join our team, and we believe that Coach Vance's experience and expertise will contribute significantly to the success of our athletes on and off the field. Coach Vance brings a passion for the game, outstanding leadership skills, and dedication to fostering both individual and team growth. I know our Charger community will embrace Coach Vance and his family as he leads our football program to new heights. Welcome to Charger Nation.\"\n\nThe Vance Years At L.D. Bell Season Record 2023 7-3 2022 6-4 2021 2-8 2020 2-7 2019 3-7 2018 1-9 2017 1-9 2016 3-7 2015 2-9 2014 1-9 2013 7-4\n\nVance was formally introduced to Central staff and players Wednesday morning and discussed his excitement to join Charger Nation. Coming from a coaching tree that includes Hal Watson (Southlake Carroll State Champion), Tony Dungy (Super Bowl XLI Winner), Mike Tomlin (Super Bowl XXXVII & XLIII Winner), and Jon Gruden (Super Bowl XXXVII Winner), Vance promised a program that would pay attention to and put value in every detail, pride it's self in discipline, and set high expectations. The work towards all of these things started this morning and will continue through the spring as the start of the 2024 season is just over 200 days away.\n\nJoin the whole of Charger Nation as we Welcome Eric, his wife Inika, and children Jalyn and Jordan to the Central Family.\n\nKeller ISD Athletics offers sports programs that help develop the whole student through athletics.
