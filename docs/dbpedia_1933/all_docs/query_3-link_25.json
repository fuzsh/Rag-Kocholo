        "text": "The number you see here is the Batting Runs Formula and is calculated based on a player's single game performance. The calculation is made when your coach enters the game stats so the player may change from night to night until the week closes (Saturday). If your name appears here (even for a night), then congratulations and keep swinging! ~Mark Senna\n\n2012 Season\n\nWeek 1 - Jimmy Pinkston (Pirates) 5.14\n\nWeek 2 - Pat Dolbeare (Pratt Club) - 4.39\n\nWeek 3 - Jared Barber (Telegraph Hill) - 4.70\n\nWeek 4 - Rob Rogers (Pirates) - 4.05\n\nWeek 5 - Kevin McAuliffe (The Swingers) - 3.67\n\nWeek 6 - Anthony Garofalo & Chris Deane (Below Average Joe's) - 4.05\n\nWeek 7 - Dan Pencinger (Warehouse) - 2.53\n\nThe batting triple crown, bestowed on the hitter who simultaneously leads his league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in, is among baseball's rarest and most revered feats. While the triple crown statistics measure three important things, they aren't the best means to evaluate a hitter's overall value.\n\nLooking solely at batting average, for example, ignores the contribution of reaching base by drawing walks. Giving a hitter credit only for his home runs ignores the power inherent in hitting doubles and triples. If you're looking at runs batted in, why not take into account runs scored, too?\n\nRuns batted in and runs scored, unless solely the product of a hitter's own home runs, are dependent not only on his own ability, but that of his teammates, too. A great RBI man requires lots of runners to reach base ahead of him. A prolific table setter needs the help of the hitters behind him to score many runs. Runs batted in and runs scored are a product of opportunities as much as ability.\n\nInstead of measuring how many times he drives in his teammates who succeed in reaching base, or how many times his teammates succeed in driving him in when he reaches base, it's possible to isolate the value of the things a hitter does himself. Each offensive event, singles, doubles, triples, home runs, bases on balls, hit by pitch, and outs, has an approximate value that can be measured in runs. Batting runs uses these values to estimate a hitter's total individual contribution to his team above or below the league average. Here is the batting runs formula:\n\n(0.47 * 1B) + (0.78 * 2B) + (1.09 * 3B) + (1.40 * HR) + (0.31 * (BB + HBP)) - (0.276 * (AB - H))\n\nFive advantages of the batting runs formula are:\n\n The formula is of proven accuracy. When applied to a team's offensive statistics, the batting runs estimated by the equation correlate highly with the number of runs actually scored by the team.\n\n The formula uses statistics that are commonly available. While even more accurate measures of offensive performance exist, they often rely on situational statistics or even play-by-play data not readily accessible to the average fan.\n\nThe formula's result is expressed in an easily understood unit, i.e., runs. Unlike formulas that express their outcome in bases gained, ratios, or percentages, batting runs estimate what the player produced in terms of the basic and most important element of offense.\n\n The formula incorporates not just the player's positive contributions, like hits, and walks, but his negative actions, too, i.e., his outs. A player who hits .300 with 30 home runs and makes 400 outs is likely not as valuable as a player who hits .300 with 30 home runs and makes 300 outs. Batting runs estimate a player's net value, not just his gross value. Cost of an Out. The value of a single (0.47), double (0.78), triple (1.09), home run (1.40), walk (0.31), and hit by pitch (0.31), is constant.\n\nCaveats. Batting runs has its limitations. The values assigned to each offensive event are based on averages. Yet clearly a single with a runner on third base is worth more than a single with a runner on first base, just as an out with the bases loaded is usually more costly than an out with no one on base. While statistics exist that reveal how well a batter hits in particular base and out situations, such detailed information would make batting runs much more complicated in order to achieve greater accuracy.\n\nMoreover, batting runs is limited by the data available. It would be useful to know how often a batter advances a runner with outs, how frequently a faster player takes extra bases on hits and outs than a slower player, and how often a batter reaches base or advances on errors. Such statistics are not readily available to most fans. Indeed, even more common statistics, like stolen bases and caught stealing, are unavailable for many players in major-league history.\n\nIn any event, batting runs is an estimate, not a definitive value. The ability of his teammates to reap the value of a batter's contribution is a huge factor in determining whether real runs, not just batting runs, are gained. Batting runs proceeds on the assumption that the batter's actions take place within an average context. Obviously this is not always the case.\n\nConclusion. Batting runs are not necessarily more accurate than other methods of hitter evaluation, like Bill James' runs created, Paul Johnson's estimated runs produced, Jim Furtado's extrapolated runs, or Tom Ruane's value-added runs created. Similarly, a simple measure like on-base percentage plus slugging average also correlates highly with team runs scored. But for the purposes here, to express a player's value above or below the league average in a unit easily understood, batting runs is the best choice.
