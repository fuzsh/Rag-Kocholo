        "text": "Behavioral Science Faculty\n\nAt Booth, we are a business school that eschews academic silos and ideological thinking. We believe in working across fields, both in the classroom and in our research, to produce ideas that can change the world.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach lends itself to innovative courses at Booth in the field of behavioral science that you won’t find elsewhere. Courses such as Managerial Decision Making, for instance, incorporate Nobel Prize–winning research on behavioral decision theory. Other classes, such as Designing a Good Life, provide students with the tools to adopt a psychological approach to understanding ethical behavior.\n\nDiscover more about our behavioral science faculty, including the classes they teach, below.\n\nAwards and Honors\n\n“It is humbling to be referred to as a humanitarian. Of course, I am deeply honored to be recognized. At the same time, I view my involvement with the program as a great privilege.”\n\nBooth’s George Wu, speaking about receiving the 2020 Chicago Urban League’s Humanitarian Award. Professor Wu received the award for his contributions to the Urban League’s IMPACT Leadership Development Program, a partnership between Booth and the Urban League that promotes engagement between up-and-coming professionals and successful senior African American leaders in Chicago.\n\nLearn More about Professor Wu and His Award\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nBehavioral Science Faculty in the News\n\n8 Ways to Vastly Improve Your Communication Skills\n\nSeptember 23, 2020 | World Economic Forum\n\nA study coauthored by Booth’s Nicholas Epley finds that people who know each other well don’t understand one another any better than people who just met. “Our problem in communicating with friends is that we have an illusion of insight,” Epley said.\n\nQ&A: How to Better Cope with the Mental Burden of a Pandemic\n\nJuly 23, 2020 | Medical Xpress\n\nBooth professor and social psychologist Ayelet Fishbach says policymakers have a responsibility to help guide the public through feelings of uncertainty brought on by the pandemic.\n\nThe Law of Supply and Demand Isn’t Fair\n\nMay 20, 2020 | The New York Times\n\nIt isn’t socially acceptable to raise prices of essential items during an emergency, but Booth’s Richard H. Thaler says this social norm predictably leads to shortages like those seen during the early weeks of the coronavirus crisis in the United States.\n\nPartnering across the University of Chicago and Beyond\n\nOur behavioral science faculty members are active in and outside of the University of Chicago.\n\nBooth’s Anuj Shah works with UChicago’s Crime Lab on issues such as improving criminal justice outcomes. The behavioral science faculty collaborates with the university’s Department of Psychology, providing Booth’s PhD students with the option to earn a Joint PhD in Psychology and Business. And Booth’s Sendhil Mullainathan helped cofound a nonprofit to apply behavioral science called ideas42, which leverages behavioral science to help improve lives, create social change, and build stronger systems and policies.\n\nResearch Spotlight\n\nDiscover some of the latest working papers and published papers from our behavioral science faculty.\n\n“Trade-Offs in Choice”\n\nAyelet Fishbach, with coauthors Franklin Shaddy (Anderson School of Management, University of California at Los Angeles) and Itamar Simonson (Graduate School of Business, Stanford University)\n\n“Dyadic Judgments Based on Conflicting Samples: The Failure to Ignore Invalid Input”\n\nAlex Koch, with coauthors Klaus Fiedler (Department of Psychology, University of Heidelberg), Tobias Krüger (Department of Psychology, Neu‐Ulm University of Applied Sciences, Hochschule Neu‐Ulm), and Florian Kutzner (Department of Psychology, University of Heidelberg)\n\n“Arousal Increases Self-Disclosure”\n\nAnn L.
