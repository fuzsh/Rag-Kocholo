The closest that I think weve come to a no-hitter on Opening Day was us getting 1-hit. It was a great memory tonight.\n\nA great one for the three pitchers, too. For themselves, of course, but also for providing their coach with yet another special moment. Told of Martins comments after the game, Parrish laughed and said, I mean, the guys been around baseball longer than Ive been alive two times in a row.\n\nFor him to say that, after all that hes seen, all the great players hes coached, its just something you're going to remember for the rest of your life.\n\nThe plan, of course, is for Martin to and FSU baseball to experience plenty of great memories over the next few months.\n\nSome, like Martins upcoming 2,000th win  now just 12 away  are planned.\n\nThis one was not.\n\nOptimistic as he was, Martin wouldve been hard-pressed to predict a no-hitter in his teams opener.\n\nNot with his starter, the former All-American Parrish, on a soft pitch count. (He was pulled after 65.) And not with his closer, Haney, making his first appearance since 2017 after missing last season with an injury.\n\nAnd, for that matter, Martin might not have predicted that his new-look lineup would erupt for 12 hits and 11 runs, five of which were driven in by true freshman Robby Martin in his collegiate debut.\n\nNear the end of his press conference, Martin reminded, as he often does, that theres no sense in overreacting to one game. There will be highs and lows throughout the season, and how well his team rides them will likely determine where it spends its summer.\n\nBut it certainly doesnt hurt to start this high.\n\nWe couldnt ask for a better start, Grady said.\n\nThe very end was pretty good, too.\n\nA few moments after bringing in the games final out, catcher Mat Nelson approached Martin with the ball and asked if hed like to have it.\n\nTheres only one ball from the final Opening Day of a 40-year career, after all.\n\nMartin took it, put it in his pocket then flashed back to February 24, 1980.\n\nAfter starting the season 0-2 in their new head coachs first season, Martins Seminoles topped Miami, 9-8, to pick up the very first victory of what would become a legendary career.\n\nAfter the game, catcher Craig Ramsey, whose son James would become an FSU All-American in 2012, approached Martin with the game ball.\n\nThat was ironic, Martin said with a smile. (Nelson) said, You want the first win from the last year?\n\nIt was the latest of thousands, and Martin hopes its the first of many still to come. But it might be a little while before its topped.\n\nOf Note\n\nThe no-hitter was the 10th in Florida State history and the first since a combined no-no from Cole Sands, Cobi Johnson and Jim Voyles against Toledo in 2016. Mike Martin has overseen four no-hitters, including solo efforts from Jerry Nielsen against Charleston Southern in 1988 and Chris Chavez against Charleston Southern in 1998.\n\nFlorida State started five newcomers in its lineup, highlighted by freshman designated hitter Robby Martin. Martin, from Tampa, Fla., finished 3-for-4 with five runs batted in.\n\nFreshman Nander De Sedas had two hits in the nine hole, including a double, and Elijah Cabell was hit by two pitches and stole a pair of bases.\n\nSophomore Reese Albert was 2-for-4 with two runs batted in, including his eighth career home run. Albert thought he had a second home run to centerfield, but it was overturned on replay to a triple.\n\nJunior J.C. Flowers hit a 410-foot home run to deep centerfield, the third of his career and first since 2017.\n\nFSU improved to 36-4 in season openers under Martin.\n\nThe no-hitter was the first game as a full-time assistant coach for Clyde Keller, who took over for Mike Bell in the offseason. Student assistant Tyler Holt also was coaching his first game.\n\nThird baseman Drew Mendoza and second baseman Mike Salvatore each had a pair of hits and five total runs scored. FSUs top three hitters in the lineup (Salvatore, Albert, Mendoza) combined to hit 6-for-12 with 7 runs scored and 4 RBI.\n\nNAME POSITION AB R H RBI BB SO PO A ======================= ======== == == == === == == == == Mike Salvatore 2B 5 3 2 1 0 0 0 1 Reese Albert RF 4 2 2 2 0 0 3 0 Drew Mendoza 3B 3 2 2 1 2 0 0 1 Elijah Cabell LF 3 1 0 0 0 3 3 0 Robby Martin DH 4 0 3 5 0 1 0 0 Matheu Nelson C 5 0 0 0 0 1 9 1 Nico Baldor 1B 2 0 0 1 0 0 5 0 Cooper Swanson 1B 1 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 J.C.

From the FSU Website, seminoles.com.\n\nNoles Sweep Doubleheader on Walk-Off.\n\nThree freshmen lead to walk-off victory; Noles stay perfect.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla.  In a rare early season doubleheader at Dick Howser Stadium, No. 6 Florida State (3-0) used a walk, RBI double and sacrifice fly to beat Maine (0-3) 6-5 in walk-off fashion in game two Saturday evening. The Seminoles beat the Black Bears 16-3 in the first contest earlier in the day.\n\nElijah Cabell led the inning off with a five-pitch walk and scored on a towering double off the right field fence by fellow freshman Robby Martin to tie the score. J.C. Flowers pinch ran for Martin, moved to third on a balk by Maine pitcher Matt Geoffrion (0-1) and scored on Mat Nelsons sacrifice fly.\n\nTyler Ahearn (1-0) earned the win after a perfect top of the seventh in which he hit 96 on the radar gun.\n\nAfter Austin Pollock allowed a grand slam to Maines Jake Roper in the fourth inning that gave the Black Bears a 5-2 lead, Clayton Kwiatkowski entered and retired the seven batters he faced before Ahearn took over in the seventh. The seven-inning game was agreed to prior to the season.\n\nFSU took a 2-0 lead on a Nander De Sedas single and a Mike Salvatore double in the second inning. Salvatore added an RBI single in the fourth and Reese Albert had a sacrifice fly in the sixth that provided the theatrics for the final inning.\n\nIn Saturdays opener, FSU drew 14 walks, had 10 hits and was hit by six pitches in a 16-3 victory. CJ Van Eyk (1-0) remained perfect in his FSU career after finishing his freshman campaign 7-0. The sophomore from Lutz, Fla., allowed two runs on six hits in 5.0 innings before Jonah Scolaro, Gage Hutchinson and freshman Cade Hungate held the Black Bears to one run over the final four innings.\n\nDe Sedas, Salvatore and Albert each had four RBI in the first game, including Salvatores second career home run. Cabell hit a towering 443-foot home run to center field, while Jonathan Foster (3) and Flowers (4) set career highs for runs scored. Flowers was 1-for-1 with a two-run double, three walks and two hit by pitches.\n\nOf Note  Game 1\n\nMaine earned its first hit of the weekend in the first inning of game one, a single off the bat of Hernen Sardinas in the first inning. The Black Bears were no-hit in Fridays season opener.\n\nFirst baseman Nico Baldor singled in the second inning of game one, his first hit as a Seminole. Carter Smith entered in the 8th inning and singled in his first at-bat.\n\nTim Becker, Cade Hungate, Alec Sanchez and McGuire Weaver also made their first appearances as Seminoles. Becker walked in his lone plate appearance and Hungate threw the final two innings without allowing a run.\n\nThree players had four RBI each in the game  Mike Salvatore, who hit his second home run of his career in the seventh inning; Reese Albert, who had a two-run double in the second inning and two sacrifice flies; and Nander De Sedas, who had a two-run single, a sacrifice fly and a bases loaded walk.\n\nLeft fielder Elijah Cabell mashed a 443-foot home run for his first hit as a Seminole.\n\nJ.C. Flowers finished 1-for-1 with a double, walked three times and was twice hit by a pitch. Flowers four runs scored was a career high.\n\nJonathan Foster also scored three runs for the first time in his career. Salvatores four RBI tied a career high against Louisville last year on a grand slam.\n\nAs a team, Florida State drew 14 walks, its most since also drawing 14 against Villanova in March 2016. The Noles were also hit by six pitches, its most since drawing seven HBPs against Sam Houston State in the 2017 Super Regionals.\n\nBoth teams left 14 runners on base.\n\nOf Note  Game 2\n\nDrew Mendoza started as the designated hitter for the first time in his career. He had started the previous 64 games at third base. He leads the team with 108 consecutive starts.\n\nFreshman Robby Martin started in right field for the first time this season. Cooper Swanson started at first for the first time in his career and Carter Smith made his first career start at third base.\n\nMike Salvatore (2-for-3) and Martin (2-for-4) combined for four of FSUs six hits.

The Seminoles (8-0) remained perfect behind six strong innings from Drew Parrish (2-0) and 12 hits from the offense. Mercer fell to 8-2 on the season.\n\nParrish got the nod and pitched six innings of three-run baseball in his second win of the season. He fanned eight batters while only walking two and found his stride over his final three innings. Jonah Scolaro and Jack Anderson worked the final nine outs, with Scolaro pitching two scoreless innings. The three combined for 13 strikeouts on the evening.\n\nAfter a one-two-three top of the first inning, the Seminoles jumped all over Mercers starting pitcher with three runs on three hits in the bottom frame. Robby Martin started the scoring with an RBI single to center, followed by Nico Baldor with an RBI double to left center and then a perfect bunt single by J.C. Flowers tallied the final run of the inning. Mercer starter Sawyer Gipson-Long (2-1) allowed four runs in just 2.2 innings.\n\nThe teams exchanged runs in the second, Florida State getting theres by way of a Nander De Sedas triple to lead-off and then being driven in on Mike Salvatores single. The Seminoles added another in the sixth, again on a Martin RBI single, before they opened the offense up in the bottom of the eighth. Four runners scored, highlighted by a double apiece by Elijah Cabell and Martin before Cooper Swanson hit a pinch-hit home run deep to right field on the second pitch he saw.\n\nMercer scored a pair in the third inning on an RJ Yeager single that made the score 4-3 but Parrish and Scolaro did not allow another run over the next five innings. The Bears got two back in the top of the ninth with two outs before Drew Mendoza caught a liner at third base to end the game.\n\nOf Note\n\nRobby Martin added three RBI Friday and now has 20 on the season. He entered the weekend fourth in the country in RBI. He has at least one hit in all eight games this season and is averaging 2.5 RBI per game.\n\nNander De Sedas hit his first career triple in the second inning.\n\nDrew Mendoza has drawn three intentional walks this season and has a team-high 14 total walks. He tied a season- and career-high with three Friday.\n\nCatcher Mat Nelson lined two singles Friday, his first multi-hit game as a Seminole.\n\nCooper Swansons pinch-hit home run in the eighth inning was FSUs 14th of the season.

CJ Van Eyk (3-0) allowed just two hits after the second rain delay and the sophomore struck out a season-high eight in 5.0 innings.\n\nThe Noles used three crooked numbers to break the game open in the middle innings. FSU tied the game on Robby Martins sacrifice fly in the third inning before Swansons mammoth home run. FSU took a 5-1 lead on Jonathan Fosters RBI double.\n\nIn the fourth, Mendozas two-run home run extended the FSU lead to 7-1. It was his team-high third of the season and FSUs 16th of the year.

The win keeps the Seminoles perfect at 11-0, while the Ospreys drop to 8-6. Freshman shortstop Nander De Sedas completed the comeback with a game-winning double in the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\nChase Haney (1-0) earned the win, allowing just one hit over the eighth and ninth innings. Four Seminole relievers (Jonah Scolaro, Conor Grady, Clayton Kwiatkowski and Haney) combined to allow just four hits without walking a batter in 8.2 innings pitched.\n\nThe Ospreys jumped out to a hot start as they earned two walks, four hits, and three runs to force FSU starter Antonio Velez out of the game after only one out. Scolaro came in and struck a batter out and forced a fly out to strand the bases loaded. Scolaro did not allow a baserunner in his eight batters faced.\n\nA sluggish Florida State offense struck out 17 times, one shy of the school record. Despite leaving 14 runners on base, FSU got a timely hit from De Sedas in the second inning that scored Carter Smith and from Elijah Cabell in the seventh inning. Cabells two-run home run scored Drew Mendoza, tied the game and got a quiet Howser Stadium crowd on its feet.\n\nAfter Haney pitched a perfect top of the ninth, catcher Mat Nelson reached base on a throwing error that chased Eddie Miller (1-1) from the game. Logan Clayton entered, walked J.C. Flowers and De Sedas lined a double off the right field fence that easily scored Nelson. The win was FSUs second walk-off win of the season. Nelson had a sacrifice fly to beat Maine during opening weekend.\n\nOf Note\n\nFSUs bullpen continued to dominate Wednesday night. For the season, FSUs bullpen is 6-0 with a 1.01 earned run average in 53.2 innings pitched (6 ER). The relievers have a 55-to-15 strikeout-to-walk ratio and have surrended just 22 hits.\n\nMike Salvatore stole a base for the second straight game. He has 10 career stolen bases. He also drew two walks in a game for the seventh time in his career.\n\nFSU played errorless baseball for the fourth consecutive game and ninth time this season. On the year, FSU has committed just two errors and leads the nation in fielding percentage (.995).\n\nFlorida State is one of four remaining undefeated teams (Arizona State, NC State, Tennessee).\n\nElijah Cabell extended his hitting streak to a team-high 10 games. Fellow freshman Robby Martin saw his 10-game hitting streak come to an end.\n\nFSUs three-run deficit tied its largest of the season (5-2 against Maine, February 16).\n\nHead coach Mike Martin is two wins away from 2,000 for his career.

The Seminoles improved to 12-0 while Virginia Tech dropped to 8-4. Junior J.C. Flowers delivered the game-winning, walk-off double that scored three runs and kept the Seminoles perfect on the year.\n\nConor Grady (2-0) allowed two runs in the top of the 10th inning after pitching a scoreless ninth. Luke Scherzer (1-2), the Hokies projected Game Two starter, gave up the final two runs without recording an out.\n\nAfter allowing two runs in the top of the 10th, the Seminoles came to the plate with the game on the line. Mike Salvatore walked to lead off and Elijah Cabell was hit by a pitch with two outs. Walk-on senior Tim Becker battled to earn a six-pitch walk, loading the bases for Flowers. Flowers watched the first pitch for a strike and then smoked a ball to center field, off the wall, for the Seminoles second walk-off in as many games and third of the season.\n\nTrailing since a three-run second inning from the Hokies, Florida State rallied to tie the game in the bottom of the eighth. Freshmen Alec Sanchez and Nander De Sedas both walked with one out and Nico Baldor pinch hit for Cooper Swanson and sent a ball over the third basemans head, scoring Sanchez and advancing De Sedas. Third baseman Drew Mendoza doubled to deep center field, driving in both runners, and tying the game at 6-6.\n\nFlorida State and Virginia Tech each hit three home runs in the first four innings, giving the Hokies a 4-3 advantage.

From the FSU Website, seminoles.com.\n\n11 Reaches 2,000 Wins.\n\nNoles split doubleheader as FSU wins series vs. Virginia Tech.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla.  No. 6 Florida State (13-1, 2-1 ACC) split a Saturday doubleheader with Virginia Tech (9-5, 1-2) and head coach Mike Martin won his 2,000th career game on the field at Dick Howser Stadium that bears his name. After getting shut out 6-0 in the opener, FSU won 5-2 in the nightcap for the historic win and a series victory against the Hokies.\n\nIn front of a crowd of 5,506 that was anxious to witness the milestone victory, Drew Mendoza broke a 2-2 tie with an RBI single in the seventh inning and J.C. Flowers sealed the win with an eighth inning home run and his second save of the year.\n\nGame 2  FSU 5, Va. Tech 2\n\nMartin, the winningest coach in NCAA baseball history, earned his 2,000th career win as Florida State took the rubber match of the three-game set with a 5-2 victory on Saturday night thanks to timely hitting and another strong bullpen showing.\n\nJonah Scolaro was the first out of the pen and pitched a season high 3.2 innings of scoreless baseball in which he only allowed one baserunner. Chase Haney (2-0) earned the win with his perfect seventh inning, and Flowers picked up his second save of the season in a two-inning performance. Flowers, FSUs starting centerfielder, also put the final notch on the scoreboard with a solo home run in the eighth inning, his second of the year.\n\nAfter FSU was one-hit in Saturdays opener, Cooper Swanson changed the tone of the day with a solo shot to deep right center in the first inning. The home run was his fifth home run of the season, tying the team-high. Drew Mendoza then got on base and was eventually brought around to score on a Flowers single up the middle, putting the score at 2-0 in favor of the Noles.\n\nShane Drohan notched his first six outs via strikeout, but was erratic and lasted just 2.1 innings, allowing a pair of runs on two hits and three walks. Drohans exit led the way for the bullpen, which allowed just two hits over 6.2 innings.\n\nFSU added two more runs in the seventh as Nander De Sedas led off with a double, his second of the week, and was eventually brought around to score on a Mendoza single to right field that broke the tie. Elijah Cabell notched the other RBI of the inning with a deep sacrifice fly to center field that plated Tim Becker.\n\nGame 1  Va. Tech 6, FSU 0\n\nVirginia Tech beat the Seminoles, 6-0, behind a dominant performance from starting pitcher Chris Gerard (1-0). Gerard held FSU to just one hit and walked three batters in seven innings, striking out 10 hitters. Florida States only hit of the game was a Drew Mendoza single in the seventh inning.\n\nFSU starter CJ Van Eyk (3-1) lost his first career game, allowing four runs, four hits, walking six and striking out four in five innings. Van Eyk was 7-0 as a freshman in 2018.\n\nGerard retired 13 straight hitters between the second and sixth innings. FSU opened the seventh with a Cooper Swanson walk and Mendozas single, but both runners were stranded in scoring position.\n\nThe loss was FSUs first of the seas"
