        "text": "Self-care\n\nThe Gift of Being Yourself: The Sacred Call to Self-Discovery\n\nDavid G. Benner\n\nThe Freedom of Self Forgetfulness: The Path to True Christian Joy\n\nTimothy Keller\n\nMarriage\n\nThe Meaning of Marriage: Facing the Complexities of Marriage with the Wisdom of God\n\nTim Keller\n\nWith a clear-eyed understanding of the Bible, and meaningful instruction on how to have a successful marriage, The Meaning of Marriage is essential reading for anyone who wants to know God and love more deeply in this life.\n\nHow to Act Right When Your Spouse Acts Wrong\n\nLeslie Vernick\n\nActing right when your spouse acts wrong will not necessarily guarantee a more satisfying marital relationship, nor will it automatically make your spouse change his or her ways–although both could occur. It will, however, help you see how God is stretching you in the midst of your marital difficulties, teach you to respond wisely when wronged, and lead you into a deeper relationship with Christ as you yield your will to his plan for your life and learn to be more like him.\n\nThe Emotionally Destructive Marriage: How to Find Your Voice and Reclaim Your Hope\n\nLeslie Vernick\n\nYou can’t put it into words, but something is happening to you. Your stomach churns, your heart aches, and the tension in your marriage is making you feel weary and a little crazy. The constant criticism, disrespect, cruelty, deceit, and gross indifference are eroding your confidence and breaking your spirit. For any woman caught in an emotionally destructive marriage, Leslie Vernick offers a personalized path forward. Based on decades of counseling experience, her intensely practical, biblical advice will show you how to establish boundaries and break free from emotional abuse.\n\nScreamFree Marriage: Calming Down, Growing Up, and Getting Closer\n\nHal Runkel\n\nRunkel now shows couples how learning to stay calm, in the face of common marital conflicts, is the key to creating and enjoying a deep, lifelong connection.\n\nParenting\n\nScreamfree Parenting: The Revolutionary Approach to Raising Your Kids by Keeping Your Cool\n\nHal Runkel\n\nYou can start to create and enjoy the types of calm, mutually respectful, and loving relationships with your kids that you’ve always craved. You can begin to revolutionize your family, starting tonight. Parenting is not about kids, it’s about parents. If you’re not in control, then you cannot be in charge. What every kid really needs are parents who are able to keep their cool no matter what.\n\nParenting with Love and Logic: Teaching Children Responsibility\n\nFoster Cline and Jim Fay\n\nThis parenting book shows you how to raise self-confident, motivated children who are ready for the real world. Learn how to parent effectively while teaching your children responsibility and growing their character. Establish healthy control through easy-to-implement steps without anger, threats, nagging, or power struggles. Indexed for easy reference.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Love-Logic-Teaching-Responsibility-ebook/dp/B00IV351R0\n\nSexual Abuse\n\nThe Wounded Heart: Hope for Adult Victims of Childhood Sexual Abuse\n\nDan Allender\n\nYou may think you don’t know anyone who has been sexually abused, especially if most of your friends and acquaintances are Christians. But the statistics indicate otherwise. This book takes an intensely personal and specific look at this most “soul deadening” form of abuse. Personal because it may be affecting you, your spouse, a close friend or neighbor, or someone you know well at church; and specific because it goes well beyond the general issues and solutions discussed in other books.\n\nHealing the Wounded Heart: The Heartache of Sexual Abuse and the Hope of Transformation\n\nDan Allender"
