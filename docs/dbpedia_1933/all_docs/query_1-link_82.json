The proceedings volumes were published by AAAI Press.\n\nThe AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence has promoted theoretical and applied AI research as well as intellectual interchange among researchers and practitioners for more than three decades. As can be seen in these proceedings, AI's scope and influence continue to grow. This year, the main technical and topical tracks of AAAI-15 received 1,991 submissions, the largest number in the history of the conference and about 40 percent more than the main technical track of AAAI-14 (that held the record previously), demonstrating that the scope and influence of AI continue to grow. The technical papers presented at the twenty-ninth meeting of this conference feature substantial, original research and practices. The 2015 conference program cochairs were Blai Bonet (Universidad Simón Bolívar, Venezuela) and Sven Koenig (University of Southern California, USA).\n\nThe main technical program features papers grouped into the following categories: AI and the web, applications, cognitive modeling, cognitive systems, computational sustainability and AI, game playing and interactive entertainment, game theory and economic paradigms, heuristic search and optimization, human-computation and crowd sourcing, humans and AI, integrated systems, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning applications, multiagent systems, NLP and knowledge representation, NLP and machine learning, NLP and text mining, novel machine learning algorithms, planning and scheduling, reasoning under uncertainty, robotics, search and constraint satisfaction, and vision, along with student abstracts and the AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium, the demonstration programs, and the what’s hot track.\n\nAlso included in this proceedings are the papers of the Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference (IAAI), which emphasizes the relevance of AI in our everyday lives. The IAAI-15 chair was David Gunning (PARC, USA). The conference was cochaired by Peter Z. Yeh (Nuance Communications, USA).\n\nThe conferences are sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence."
