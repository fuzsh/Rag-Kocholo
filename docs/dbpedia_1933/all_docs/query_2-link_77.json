        "text": "Some of these \"Scale Dictionaries\" which give you all 12 major and minor scales tab/notation, and then all the modes, etc. etc. are, imo, a waste of money. The real purpose of these publications is not really to instruct, but to induce you (to buy the product). Yes, there are #scales etc., but, you could download the manual for making WMD and get as much practical use out of it.\n\nLearn to read notation, and then go out and get Sevcik's School of Violin Technics for technical exercises.\n\nAnd you could also get the Coker/Casale/Campbell/Greene Patterns For Jazz\n\nIf you really don't understand how the major and the minor scale, knowing 50 other scales is like memorizing a lot of sports stats about some game you don't even play.\n\nYou've got major and minor, and all the other stuff, is slight chromatic alterations, or reductions, or expansions of those two basic scales. (That's in 12TET. If you want to get microtonal and get into quartertone and the Arabic/Turkish/Indonesian/Thai and lots of other non-western (non-northern European) stuff, that's something else\n\nNH\n\nNiles speaks the truth, in that once you learn a scale in one key, via note functions i.e. 1 2 b3 4 5 6 7, you should figure the modes and other keys out yourself. Once it's in your head/ears/fingers, you need to access them on the fly- and not on the music stand!\n\nIf you want lots of applicable scales and cool ideas for the purpose of improvisation, try Jerry Bergonzi's excellent Inside Improvisation series. 6 books, all really useful (if you play the Jazz Music).The pentatonics book will blow your mind!\n\nAs a relative novice, I feel the best improvements I have made is learning how scales, scale variations and modes work. How does changing the 3 or adding the 7th change the feel. What are the notes that sound better at the beginning or end of a chord? What are the leading tones or the passing notes that fill out a phrase. My instructor has me working with arpeggios a sort of sparce scale and making it minor or a 7th minor. We've been using the arpeggios that go along with each chord in a tune to improvise. They are all in the same scale after all. I strongly recommend taking the time to learn how scales, chord progression, modes and chords all tie together. Someone on this site says something like it's more like plumbing and less like theory after you learn how it all works."
