The talent-laden Yankees kept the lefthanded slugger in Newark (International League) the season after he was the league batting champion and TSN Minor League Player of the Year for 1937. A place was made for him in 1939, and he hit .334 with the first of six Yankee pennant winners for which he would play. He was a five-time All-Star and reached highs of 33 HR and 122 RBI in 1941. He led the AL in walks with 106 in both 1940 and 1943. Keller ‘s career was interrupted for maritime service in WWII. He had chronic back problems which eventually relegated him to pinch hitting, and he led the league in that department (9-for-38) in 1951, his final full season. Keller coached for the Yankees before retiring to rural Maryland to run a horse farm. His brother Hal caught briefly for the Senators and spent over 20 years as a front-office man for the Senators, Rangers, and Mariners. His son, Charlie Jr., led the Eastern League in hitting with a .349 average before being sidelined by the same congenital back problem that had plagued his father.\n\n@ET-DC@eyJkeW5hbWljIjp0cnVlLCJjb250ZW50IjoicG9zdF90YWdzIiwic2V0dGluZ3MiOnsiYmVmb3JlIjoiTGVhcm4gTW9yZSBhYm91dCB0aGUgdGVhbXMsIHBsYXllcnMsIGJhbGwgcGFya3MgYW5kIGV2ZW50cyB0aGF0IGhhcHBlbmVkIG9uIHRoaXMgZGF0ZSBpbiBoaXN0b3J5IC0gLSAtIC0gLSAtIC0gIiwiYWZ0ZXIiOiIiLCJsaW5rX3RvX3Rlcm1fcGFnZSI6Im9uIiwic2VwYXJhdG9yIjoiIHwgIiwiY2F0ZWdvcnlfdHlwZSI6InBvc3RfdGFnIn19@\n\nVintage Baseball HOT ON EBAY\n\nCard Collections ENDING SOON ON EBAY\n\nMOST WANTED ROOKIE CARDS\n\nVINTAGE SPORTS TICKETS\n\nBaseball Hall of Famers\n\nFactoids, Quotes, Milestones and Odd Facts\n\nPlayed For\n\nNew York Yankees (1939-1949)\n\nDetroit Tigers (1950-1951)\n\nNew York Yankees (1952)\n\nPost-Season Appearances\n\n1939 World Series\n\n1941 World Series\n\n1942 World Series\n\n1943 World Series\n\nDescription\n\nThough Keller was known for his great physical strength, he was a skilled all-around athlete. He could run very well, for example. In 1943, in a 60-yard dash prior to a game against the Indians, Keller ran the distance in seven seconds flat, beating every runner, including teammate Snuffy Stirnweiss, who had stoled more than 70 bases the previous season.\n\nScouting Report\n\n“The kid isn’t much of a catcher and never will be, but he certainly can hit that ball.” — former big leaguer Bill Bradley, scouting a young Kiner in the minors\n\nNotes\n\nOn September 25, 1948, at Yankee Stadium, friends and fans of Keller held “Charlie Keller Day.” Keller had refused to allow the day, unless a scholarship fund was set up to benefit students to attend his alma mater, the University of Maryland.\n\nAll-Star Selections\n\n1940 AL\n\n1941 AL\n\n1943 AL\n\n1946 AL\n\n1947 AL\n\nOther Resources & Links\n\nComing Soon"
