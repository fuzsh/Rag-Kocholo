        "text": "Faculty Mentored Research Projects\n\n2024\n\nPhysically-Based Audio Effects\n\nAmanda Li, Rolando Martinez, Carolyn Wang, Jessie Wang\n\nMentor: Victor Cepeda\n\nIn this project, we aim to create a realistic simulated audio model by using digital signal processing to modify audio files to account for the pitch variations in echo/reverb that occur as a result of differences in the surrounding environment.\n\nTopology of the Turaev Genus of Knots\n\nShreev Goyal, Joshua Kou, Emma Wu, Helen Yang, Aaron Zhou\n\nMentor: Christine Lee\n\nOur project investigated the Turaev genus, a measure of how far a knot is from being alternating. Through applying the Jones polynomial and brute forcing through a family of knots with diagrams of Turaev genus 2, we identified five sub-families of knots with this property.\n\nExamining the Influence of Fairness Metrics on Clustering Algorithms\n\nBrandon Cardamone, Katherine Liu, Theo Sittig, Meiting Yang\n\nMentor: Ivan Ojeda-Ruiz\n\nClustering algorithms which partition data and generate partition centers come with biases that make them “unfair” when applied to different situations such as placing voting centers. In this project, we examine how applying fairness metrics to clustering algorithms affect how “fairly” the partitions and centers are generated.\n\n5-cycles in the Complements of Minimal Prime Graphs\n\nMicah Dorton, Ronok Ghosal, Ryan Tang, Justin Yu\n\nMentor: Thomas Keller\n\nWe studied MPGs, which connect graph theory and group theory. We tried proving that each edge in an MPG complement is always part of a 5-cycle. We did this by constructing a specific type of graph, and then inducting on it.\n\nCreating a More Flexible Test for the Population Mean\n\nGrace Huh, Albert Kim, Andy Zhou\n\nMentor: Steven Hoberman\n\nWe are attempting to improve the current t-test that we have in statistics. It works adequately for many data sets, but there are a subset of data sets for which it cannot accurately be run for, and we need an alternative for these data sets.\n\nDemazure Products of Type D Permutations\n\nDarren Han, Michelle Huang, Benjamin Keller, Jerry Zhang\n\nMentor: Suho Oh\n\nOur project presents an efficient way to compute the Demazure product of type D permutations starting from their usual product and then applying a new operator called the hopping operator based on previous findings.\n\nMitigating Bias Beyond Gender in Natural Language Processing\n\nAien Du, Alicia Gu, Thalia Kahozi, Elizabeth Lei, Chloe Weng\n\nMentor: Ivan Ojeda-Ruiz\n\nIn the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, bias transcends traditional gender disparities to more complex distinctions such as race, religion, and socioeconomic status. Using corpus-level constraints and Lagrangian relaxation, we expanded the usage of Reducing Bias Amplification (RBA) to non-binary inputs of protected groups.\n\nDeveloping Fast Training Logistic Regression Models\n\nNicolas Aldana, Anant Asthana, Gordon Chen, Tomas Faletti-Moore, Cameron Hong, Chloe Polin, Emma Qiu, Ram Sivaraman\n\nMentor: Young-Ju Lee\n\nWe propose to develop and assess fast solution techniques for logistic regression based on the Newton method and Heavy Balls method that was recently developed. The advantage of the Heavy Balls method is that it does not require Hessian computation, leading to a rather fast and efficient solver in CPU time.\n\nComparing Performances of Neural Networks on Genetic Data\n\nOlivia Bley, Jason Cheng, Ethan Poon, Adriana Vigo, Angela Wang, Kalia Wang, Elena Xiao, Joseph Zhang\n\nMentor: Xiaoxi Shen\n\nOur project compares the use of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to accurately predict traits based on genetic data. Through analyzing loss, we improved upon previous deep neural networks such as DanQ and DeepSEA to formulate better predictions.\n\nDerived Length of Solvable Groups\n\nReiyah Jacobs, Cody Zhou\n\nMentor: Burcu Cinarci\n\nWe found the derived length of any group G in terms of the p-element centralizers of the group, denoted as k. We show that if G was solvable, the upper bound was k exactly, but if the group was nilpotent, the upper bound could be set as (k-1)/2 + 1.\n\n2022\n\n2022 Research Projects\n\nData Encryption and Compression in Tandem - Shreev Goyal, Amy He.
