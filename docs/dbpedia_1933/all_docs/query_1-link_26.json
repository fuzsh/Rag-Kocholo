        "text": "In addition to our two players of the week, this week’s honor roll of the state’s top single-game performances includes a sophomore quarterback from Sacramento with seven TD passes plus an All-American lacrosse player from San Francisco scoring on a 98-yard interception return.\n\nWe will lead off the State Stat Stars every week with the Northern California and Southern California Players of the Week, which were not part of this week’s Time Warner Cable’s Varsity Roundup show due to a studio conflict but we also didn’t want to miss a week, either. We will then present the stat stars each week according to performance and no longer simply alphabetical.\n\nAs has been customary for many years, we collect the state stat stars in support of the Cal-Hi Sports State Record Book & Almanac. The book has been published seven times and is as official as a state record book can be since no other exists. To report a State Stat Star of the Week of your own, please email details to markjtennis@gmail.com.\n\nNote: All football state records are in the process of being added to this web site. They will be part of our Gold Club membership. To join our Gold Club today, please CLICK HERE.\n\nThanks to Paul Muyskens, Harold Abend, Ronnie Flores and CIF Central Section historian Bob Barnett for contributing items this week. This honor roll is for games played from Oct. 10 to Oct. 12.\n\nNorthern California Player of the Week\n\nDelshawn Mitchell (Wilcox, Santa Clara)\n\nThree-year standout for the Chargers had 16 carries for 262 yards and three TDs in their 43-39 win over Palo Alto. Wilcox needed all of Mitchell’s yards because Keller Chryst of Palo Alto (committed to Stanford) passed for 379 yards and three TDs, plus two scores rushing. Mitchell also had four tackles playing defense. He had an 80-yard TD on the second play of the game and later on went 91 yards for a score. Still, to beat Paly in the back-and-forth game, it took Mitchell scoring on a 19-yard run with just under one minute to play.\n\nSouthern California Player of the Week\n\nClayton Hanly (Santa Ynez)\n\nIn a 40-14 win by the Pirates last Friday over Santa Maria, Hanly was charted with 8.5 sacks according to head coach Jason McClurg along with Santa Maria Times writer Brad Memberto. Both the coach and the writer added that all of the plays in which Hanly was given a sack were intended passes and not rushing attempts. The 6-foot-4, 235-pound Hanly has had games in the last two years in which he’s had double-digit tackle totals plus one or two sacks, but never anything like when he continuously pursued Santa Maria quarterback Dominique Garrett throughout the contest. According to our own Cal-Hi Sports record book, Hanly’s 8.5 sacks tops the previous state record of 8 first set in 1994 by Ramiro Munoz of Firebaugh, then tied in 2001 by Jimmy McGuiness of La Canada and Ray Anaya from San Jose Gunderson in 2011.\n\nPASSING\n\nCaden Boges (Sacramento)\n\nTaking over for graduated standout Josiah Johnson, Boges delivered in a big way for the Dragons in their 70-6 romp past Johnson of Sacramento. Just a sophomore, Boges connected on 22 of 31 passes for 388 yards and seven TDs. We know the seven TDs isn’t a school record because Johnson threw that many in a game at least once .\n\nBrandon Dawkins (Oaks Christian, Westlake Village)\n\nHe continued his hot play by completing 22 of 37 passes for 386 yards and accounting for seven touchdowns in the Lions’ easy 50-7 win over Agoura. He had six touchdown passes and added another on the ground. WR Chris Davis added nine receptions for 171 yards and three touchdowns. For the season, the 2011 State Sophomore of the Year has passed for 2,480 yards and 31 touchdown passes in seven games.\n\nKeller Chryst (Palo Alto)\n\nThe Stanford-bound quarterback passed for 379 yards and three TDs and ran for two more scores, but he was on the sidelines watching as Santa Clara Wilcox scored in the game’s final minute of a 42-39 loss. It was Palo Alto’s third loss of the season.\n\nBrian Gadsby & Chase Walker (Crescenta Valley, La Crescenta)\n\nThis pass-catch combo helped CV to a 48-47 overtime victory over Burbank. The Great Gadsby was 25 of 31 for 352 yards passing. Walker might have been even more impressive, as he had 10 receptions for 215 yards and two touchdowns. He caught a 38-yard touchdown in overtime and the two-point conversion to seal the win for the 5-1 Falcons.\n\nDanny Mattero (Calvary Chapel, Santa Ana)\n\nHis arm got a good workout as the Eagles improved to 2-0 in the Orange Coast League with a 42-14 win over Godinez of Santa Ana. Mattero completed 31 of his 42 pass atttempts for 366 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nCollin Rugg (La Jolla)\n\nYou can’t pull the Rugg under the feet of this quarterback. He passed for nearly as many touchdowns as University City of San Diego scored points as he completed 22 of his 31 pass attempts for 364 yards and five touchdowns in the Vikings’ 63-6 victory.\n\nJake Browning (Folsom)\n\nWhen an opponent gets credit for limiting you to just three touchdown passes like Oak Ridge of El Dorado Hills did during a 35-0 win by the Bulldogs you know you’ve been having a great season. In that game, despite five interceptions, Browning completed 27 of his 39 pass attempts for 362 yards.\n\nJosh Allen (Firebaugh)\n\nIt was no calm night for Tranquillity in trying to stop the fire that was his passing arm. Allen completed 19 of his 33 pass attempts for 353 yards and three touchdowns as the Eagles remained undefeated this season with a 33-14 win. Teammat Jordan Martinez also had a fine game with seven catches for 170 yards and one TD.\n\nMarco Morales (Mater Dei Catholic, Chula Vista)\n\nIt has been a tough battle this season for the Crusaders but they were able to get their second win of the season behind Morales, who completed 20 of his 36 pass attempts for 345 yards and four touchdowns in a 31-27 victory over Mar Vista of Imperial Beach.\n\nTristian Hernandez (Roosevelt, Fresno)\n\nHe led Roosevelt to its third straight win by passing for 336 yards on 23 of 34 throws and two TDs in a 35-28 victory vs. Hoover of Fresno. It’s the fourth time this season Hernandez has passed for more than 300 yards in one game.\n\nJosh Evans (Alhambra, Martinez)\n\nTalk about beating adversity. The Bulldogs overcame a team bus breakdown, the lights going out during the game, and a 21-6 deficit to defeat host Dougherty Valley of San Ramon 40-37. Junior quarterback Evans passed for 330 yards and three touchdowns, and ran for a fourth score.\n\nCristian Solano (San Fernando)\n\nLeading the Tigers to their seventh win of the season (against no losses), Solano completed 15 of 20 passes for 324 yards and five TDs as they beat Panorama 61-6. Solano also rushed for 40 yards and two more scores to give him seven accounted for in the contest.\n\nJake Wallace (Valencia)\n\nHe completed 21 of 33 passes for 321 yards and two scores in a 38-24 Foothill League victory over Saugus. He added another touchdown rushing.\n\nPeyton Wilfley (Casa Roble, Orangevale)\n\nNot only did he look like Peyton Manning throwing the football as he passed for 288 yards and three touchdowns but he also showed he could run more than that other Peyton with 91 yards and two more scores in a huge 35-32 win over Del Campo of Fair Oaks.\n\nRECEIVING\n\nJoey Cox (Calvary Chapel, Santa Ana)\n\nDanny Mattero looked his way early and often as he outscored Godinez of Santa Ana on his own with 10 receptions for 221 yards and three touchdowns in the 42-14 victory.\n\nJosh Holman (Woodside)\n\nIt was a long night for Half Moon Bay trying to limit his catches as he caught seven passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Wildcatcs to their first win by a 42-27 final score.\n\nRUSHING\n\nTre Watson (Centennial, Corona)\n\nHelping get the Huskies back on track, Watson rushed for a whopping 382 yards and hit paydirt three times in the big 43-25 victory over Norco. So far this season, Watson has rushed for 1,568 yards and scored 22 touchdowns in six games. Of course, he set the school record by rushing for 466 yards in an earlier win over St. Bonaventure of Ventura.\n\nNathan Lancaster (Laguna Beach)\n\nLooking like he could run to Lancaster before being brought down, he rushed for 335 yards and five touchdowns on 18 carries as the Breakers moved to 4-2 on the season and ended a two-game losing streak with a 55-19 road win against Saddleback of Santa Ana.\n\nRyan Martinez (Le Grand)\n\nYet to rush for 200 yards in a game this season, he went way past that mark in the Bulldogs’ 52-14 win over Waterford. Martinez carried the ball a season-high 27 times for 320 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nDeven Boston (Buena Park)\n\nApproaching 1,500 rushing yards on the season, he ran for over 300 yards in a game for the third time with 318 yards and four touchdowns on 25 carries in a 30-22 win for the Coyotes over Sunny Hills of Fullerton.\n\nMarcos Lopez (South El Monte)\n\nFor just the second time this season, the Eagles were able to celebrate a win as he carried the ball 29 times for 308 yards and four touchdowns in their win over nearby El Monte.\n\nRichard Doctor (Lemoore)\n\nDoing his best to keep prescribing losses for the opposition, Doctor ran for 306 yards and six touchdowns on 27 carries in a 57-31 win over Golden West of Visalia.\n\nJamie Taylor (Rim of the World, Lake Arrowhead)\n\nTeams in the Mountain Valley League are likely hoping there aren’t any more Taylor brothers to come around. Jamie rushed for 293 yards and five touchdowns on 29 carries as the Fighting Scots defated Banning 55-3.\n\nSean Lanoza (Los Altos)\n\nDespite rushing for 291 yards and two touchdowns on 23 carries, Lanoza had to be a bit dissapointed after the game as the Eagles suffered their first loss of the season 42-24 to Homestead of Cupertino.\n\nAndrew Brown (Ripon Christian)\n\nThe running back/kicker racked up 281 yards on 22 carries and scored six TDs in RC’s 84-0 win over Turlock Christian. According to the Ripon Record, Brown has 1,184 yards rushing and 22 touchdowns on the season.\n\nEddie Reyes (Inglewood)\n\nHe had a monster game with 275 yards rushing and two touchdowns, on just eight carries, in the Sentinels’ 49-0 victory over Beverly Hills in Ocean League play.\n\nHarrison Faecher (Redondo Union, Redondo Beach)\n\nOn only 15 carries, the Seahawks’ quarterback rushed for 270 yard and hit paydirt four times, including the game-winner, in Redondo’s 42-35 victory over Peninsula of Rolling Hills Estates. His winning score came on a 34-yard run midway through the final period.\n\nDeJonte O’Neal (Bullard, Fresno)\n\nIn a 55-0 romp past Madera South, O’Neal rushed for a career-high of 266 yards on 15 carries and scored four times. His TDs were on bursts of 33, 70, 3 and 19 yards.\n\nJames Williams (Burbank)\n\nHe set the school rushing record by gaining 263 yards on 19 carries in a 48-47 loss to Crescenta Valley of La Crescenta. The school mark was set in 1952.\n\nAaron Aguilar (Orange)\n\nWhile we are not sure if he had any oranges for a halftime refreshment, we are sure that the Panthers are now 5-1 as he rushed for 262 yards and four touchdowns on 19 carries during a 55-21 win over Santa Ana.\n\nDeaudrey Steen (Jefferson, Los Angeles)\n\nSenior back for the Demos rushed for 261 yards and six touchdowns on only 12 carries in a 62-20 victory over Diego Rivera Learning Complex of Los Angeles. So far this season, Steen has 906 yards and 14 TDs on 99 carries and another 307 yards on kick returns.\n\nAustin Cardoza (Exeter)\n\nSelma couldn’t slow down this Cardoza as the Exeter running back motored for 259 yards on 39 carries and scored five touchdowns as the Monarchs beat the Bears 50-22.\n\nJustin Allen (Mater Dei, Santa Ana)\n\nIn the biggest game of the weekend as far as the state rankings are concerned, Allen ran for 244 yards and two touchdowns on 28 carries as the Monarchs defeated Servite of Anaheim 28-21. He earned the OCVarsity Athlete of the Week honor.\n\nWadus Parker (Elk Grove)\n\nAnother week and another big rushing performance for the Thundering Herd’s feature back as he rushed for 242 yards and three touchdowns during a 46-6 win over Laguna Creek.\n\nMatt Woodcock (Nordhoff, Ojai)\n\nRushing for 242 yards on 22 carries, the Rangers moved to 6-0 on the season with a 31-14 win over Sierra Canyon of Chatsworth.\n\nNico Evans (Loyola, Los Angeles)\n\nHe had a breakout game with 238 yards and three touchdowns in the Cubs’ 31-20 victory over Alemany of Mission Hills that knocked that team from the state top 25 rankings. Loyola has a strong offensive line and Evans also gets top-notch schooling from Kennedy Polamalu, the former USC running backs coach who joined the staff of friend Marvin Sanders, USC’s former defensive back coach, this off-season.\n\nFreddy Holly (Norte Vista, Riverside)\n\nMaking one heck of a season debut for the Braves, he ran for 238 yards and two touchdowns on 15 carries during a 48-7 road win over Ramona of Riverside. He had to sit out the first five games of the season after transferring to the school from Ramona.\n\nJoey Camarillo (Santiago, Corona)\n\nDespite the Sharks losing their quarterback early in the game with a concussion, they made sure they didn’t lose the game against Roosevelt of Eastvale. Camarillo was handed the ball 42 times and he ran for 234 yards and three touchdowns in a 38-25 win to open up Big VIII league play.\n\nDylan Alvarado (Calistoga)\n\nThe No. 2 rusher in the CIF North Coast Section (1,316 yards, 14 TDs) didn’t go for 400 yards like he did two weeks ago, but after a bye he helped the Wildcats move to 6-0, after a 218-yard three-TD effort helped produce a 47-6 win over Hayward Stellar Prep.\n\nMichael Ysit (Ripon)\n\nYsit continues to get it for the undefeated Indians. He had 215 yards on 13 carries and scored four TDs as Ripon beat Hughson 30-14. Ysit has 981 yards on the season, averaging 18.1 yards per carry.\n\nALL-PURPOSE\n\nWayne Brooks (Stagg, Stockton)\n\nThe returning Stockton Record Player of the Year finally had a breakout night to lead the 5-1 Delta Kings past Edison of Stockton 41-12. Brooks completed 18 of 28 passes for 256 yards and three TDs. He also rushed for 105 yards on 11 carries with one more score.\n\nJoe Lang (St. Ignatius, San Francisco)\n\nIn one of the few night games ever played in San Francisco, the Wildcats got their first win of the season, a 49-7 victory over crosstown WCAL rival Archbishop Riordan. Lang, an All-American lacrosse player who will play for Harvard next year, had 200 all-purpose yards before halftime and three touchdowns in three different ways. He returned a punt 56 yards for a TD, had a 31-yard pass interception for a score, and a 98-yard interception he returned to paydirt that was one yard shy of the school record.\n\nVictor Viramontes (Norco)\n\nWhile unable to lead the Cougars to another big win last week, this sophomore signal caller did have a nice game in their 43-25 loss to Centennial of Corona. He set several career highs as he completed 10 of his 15 pass attempts for 158 yards while also rushing for 149 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nBenjamin Giese (Tri-City Christian, Vista)\n\nEarning an athlete of the week honor from the San Diego Union Tribune, he ran for a reported school-record 206 yards on 19 carries while scoring four touchdowns in a 42-7 win over The Rock. He also kicked extra points and recorded seven tackles on defense.\n\nPatrick Allen (St. Bernard’s, Eureka)\n\nHumboldt County sports radio personality Tag Wotherspoon reports that the Crusaders’ senior had a hand in all five touchdowns of a 35-16 victory over Miranda South Fork. Allen passed for two TDs, ran for two more and returned a punt 91 yards for a fifth score.\n\nBrandon Thompson (Christian Brothers, Sacramento)\n\nHe caught two touchdown catches from his own quarterback while returning two interceptions for scores off of the other one in the Falcons’ 35-19 win over Oakmont of Roseville.\n\nChristian Lara (Santa Fe, Santa Fe Springs)\n\nIn the Chiefs’ easy 49-15 victory over Pioneer of Norwalk in Del Rio League action, Lara accounted for 417 yards. He completed 9 of 13 passes for 276 yards and three touchdowns. He also added 141 yards rushing and two touchdowns on 12 carries. Receiver Brandon Takata also had a huge night with three touchdown catches, and four total receptions, for a whopping 141 yards.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nManoah Pearson (Carson)\n\nA senior honors candidate at linebacker, Pearson was in on 20 tackles, including 10 solos and a sack, in the Colts’ 27-21 victory over San Pedro.\n\nRECORD WATCH\n\nEdgar Segura (Mendota)\n\nThe senior pushed his career scoring total to 105 touchdowns and became the fifth player in the CIF Central Setion to have rushed for more than 6,000 career yards during Mendota’s 45-14 win against Dos Palos. Segura had 193 yards on 29 carries and scored five TDs.\n\nCoaching Milestones\n\nKim Jorgensen (Ferndale)\n\nOur source way up north behind the Redwood Curtain, local Humboldt County sports radio personality Tag Wotherspoon, gives us an update on the current winningest coach in the Redwood Empire portion of the CIF North Coast Section. The 1973 graduate of Ferndale, who’s in his 23rd year at the helm, has helped lead his alma mater to eight section titles and 18 conference championships. Along the way, and going into a Friday night matchup with visiting South Fork of Miranda, Jorgensen has amassed a 222-46 record for a pretty decent .828 win-loss percentage.\n\nMatt Sweeney (Foothill, Pleasanton)\n\nA coach who is quickly moving up the ladder on the all-time winningest list is this wily veteran in his 27th year guiding Foothill varsity football, with 31 years teaching at the school. Someday, the Falcons’ girls softball coach will most likely be the state leader in combined football/softball wins. On the gridiron, Sweeney had his team off to a 6-0 start this season before the Falcons lost last week to East Bay Athletic League rival California of San Ramon. With the six wins, the current active leader in the CIF North Coast Section has a 226-79-5 record."
