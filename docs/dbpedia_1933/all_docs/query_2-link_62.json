        "text": "Stephanie Keller Rohde was born on Friday, June 13, 1952, and was raised on Staten Island, NY. A graduate of Port Richmond High School in 1970, she then earned her undergraduate degree in mathematics and education from Springfield College, MA, in 1973. After graduation, she worked for Brown Brothers Harriman in Manhattan in the Foreign Exchange Advisory Department until September 1976 when she joined the United States Air Force. Her first assignment following Officer Training School (OTS) was nine months of communications-electronics instruction in Biloxi, MS, which trained her for the next tour of duty located at Kelly AFB in San Antonio, TX. While at Kelly AFB, she worked in the base Communications Squadron—in both the Operations and Maintenance divisions. In her next assignment—and her early claim to worldly fame—she was the first lady to ever command a site for the Air Force in the “European” theatre. Actually it was Malatya, Turkey (Asia)—a remote tour on a mountaintop during 1980 and 1981. She taught mathematics while there as an extension of the University of Chicago. She later obtained her Master’s Degree from the University of Texas at Austin, TX, courtesy of the United States Air Force in math and computer science education in 1983. She then was assigned to the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) as an Assistant Professor of mathematics where she taught the cadets algebra, trigonometry, calculus, differential equations, and statistics from 1983-1987. She achieved the rank of Major, which she declined, and separated from the Air Force in 1987. Remaining in Colorado Springs, she worked for the Prudential Insurance Company until mid-1990, managed, and also taught for the Kaplan Educational Test Prep Center into 1995. She then became the personal assistant and secretary to Dr. Hal A. Huggins, DDS through 1997. In 1998, she became the office manager for Aspen Painting Inc. in Aspen, CO. She moved to Ocala, FL in 1999 to be close to her dad, as her mom died in 1996. Stephanie, in addition to her mathematics and educational training also has well over 40 years of varied computer experience (personal and business) including IBM compatibles (PC) and Apple computers—she authored 5 computer books which are no longer in print. In 1999 she created her own company End The Clutter ETC®—and began explaining to her clients (via mathematics and physics) just exactly why “stuff” happens in life—good and bad—and taught how to End The Clutter ETC® in one’s mind, body, relationships, and situations. She is retired from the world, and is a full time servant for our heavenly Father in Lord Jesus Christ. AMEN https://1-god.net/\n\nRead full bio"
