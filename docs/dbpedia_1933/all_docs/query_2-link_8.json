        "text": "Hal Keller was “one of the smartest Baseball Men I have ever know,” such are the words of Mariners President Chuck Armstrong upon learning today that the former Mariners General Manager died at his home in Sequim.\n\nAccording to Tracy Ringolsby, the Hall of Fame baseball writer who covered the Mariners in the early 1980s and remained close to Keller, Keller had been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer.\n\nRingolsby, now an analyst for ROOT SPORTS Rockies telecasts, and columnist with FOXSPORTS.com, posted a remembrance of Keller.\n\nArmstrong says Keller taught him a lot about baseball, “He epitomized the ‘essence’ of being a Baseball Person.”\n\nKeller was 84. According to Ringolsby, there will be memorial services for Keller in his native Maryland and his adopted home of Sequim in six to eight weeks.\n\nThe family also suggests that donations may be made in Keller’s name to:\n\nVolunteer Hospice of Clallam County\n\n540 E. 8th St.\n\nPort Angeles, WA 98362.\n\nRingolsby also provided this link to a SABR bio on Hal Keller."
