It refers to the number of runs that a batter directly contributes to their team by getting a hit or drawing a walk. Here is a deeper look at what constitutes an RBI, how they are recorded, and why RBIs are an important metric.\n\nDefinition of an RBI\n\nA batter is credited with an RBI when:\n\nThey get a hit that allows a runner to score\n\nThey hit a sacrifice fly bringing home a run\n\nThey draw a walk or get hit by pitch with the bases loaded\n\nThey hit into a fielder's choice where a run scores\n\nThey hit a ground ball resulting in an error that allows a run\n\nSimply put, any time a batter's plate appearance directly contributes to their team scoring a run, they are awarded an RBI.\n\nHow RBI's Are Scored\n\nOfficial scorers carefully track when a batter's actions lead to a run. Common scenarios include:\n\nSingle drives in runner from third\n\nDouble scores runner from second\n\nTriple brings home runners from first and second\n\nSac fly with runner on third tags to score\n\nBases loaded walk forces home a run\n\nThe key is the runner crosses home plate immediately as a direct result of the batter's plate appearance. Exceptions are scenarios like delayed steals where the runner started before the play.\n\nTracking RBI Totals\n\nA batter's RBI total accumulates through the season based on each hit, walk, or sac fly that drives in runs:\n\nSingle knocks in one - RBI total +1\n\nDouble plates two - RBI total +2\n\nTriple drives in three - RBI total +3\n\nSac fly adds one - RBI total +1\n\nThese contributions get added into their season and career RBI totals. Leaderboards rank players by season and all-time RBI's.\n\nSignificance of RBI's\n\nRBIs have significance in baseball because:\n\nThey directly contribute to team scoring\n\nThey frequently occur with 2 outs, driving in \"clutch\" runs\n\nHigh RBI guys are middle of the order \"run producers\"\n\nTop RBI seasons often lead leagues and drive pennant runs\n\nDriving in runs when it matters most is a key skill. RBI leaders Richard Hamilton and Manny Ramirez show the importance of cashing in runs.\n\nLeading the League in RBI's\n\nDriving in 100+ runs is an elite benchmark. Here are recent league RBI champions:\n\n2022 AL - Aaron Judge (131)\n\n2022 NL - Pete Alonso (131)\n\n2021 AL - Salvador Perez (121)\n\n2021 NL - Adam Duvall (113)\n\nSluggers like Aaron Judge put up insane RBI totals that separate them in the MVP races. Judge's 131 RBI in 2022 ranks as one of the best of the century.\n\nAll-Time RBI Leaders\n\nCareer leaders in MLB history for total RBI's include:\n\n1. Hank Aaron - 2,297\n\n2. Babe Ruth - 2,214\n\n3. Alex Rodriguez - 2,086\n\n4. Albert Pujols - 2,218\n\n5. Barry Bonds - 1,996\n\nOnly the legendary Hank Aaron drove in over 2,000 runs. Active leader Albert Pujols (2,218 RBI) sits fourth and counting.\n\nTop Single Season RBI Totals\n\nHere are the best RBI seasons in MLB history:\n\n1. Hack Wilson - 191 RBI (1930)\n\n2. Lou Gehrig - 184 RBI (1931)\n\n3. Hank Greenberg - 183 RBI (1937)\n\n4. Juan Gonzalez - 157 RBI (1998)\n\n5. Babe Ruth - 158 RBI (1921)\n\nHack Wilson's MLB record 191 RBI in 1930 came during an especially high offense era. The 191 mark is unlikely to ever be surpassed.\n\nGame Winning RBI's\n\nA batter is awarded a walk-off \"Game Winning RBI\" when:\n\nTheir walk off hit scores winning run\n\nA runner scores on error on potential last out\n\nThey receive walk, HBP, or sac fly for winning run\n\nThese clutch RBI's that end the game create the most exciting moments. RBI leaders tend to have abundant walk-off RBI's on their resume.\n\nContext for RBI Totals\n\nWhile an important stat, RBI totals must be assessed in the context of factors like:\n\nGames Played - Missing time impacts totals\n\nSpot in Batting Order - RBI opportunities vary\n\nQuality of Hitters Around Them - Protection impacts pitches to hit\n\nHigh SLG%/XBH - More extra-base hits drive in more runs\n\nEvaluating RBIs relative to at-bats and team lineup profile adds perspective on run production.\n\nIn summary, RBIs directly reflect a batter's ability to capitalize with runners on base to score runs. This key skill makes RBIs a useful metric to evaluate hitters."
