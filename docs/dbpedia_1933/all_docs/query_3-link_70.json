        "text": "Calculate On-Base Percentage\n\nMajor League Baseball hitters are commonly judged based on their batting average, homeruns, and runs batted in (RBI). Those are statistics familiar to most fans, although they only tell a very small part of the story. Another important statistic is On Base Percentage (OBP). It shows how often a batter reaches base safely, whereas batting average only considers hits.\n\nOn Base Percentage is calculated by adding hits, walks, and hit-by-pitches and dividing by the sum of at bats, walks, hit by pitches, and sacrifice flies:\n\n$$ OBP = \\frac{H+BB+HBP}{AB+BB+HBP+SF} $$\n\nBatters typically have an on base percentage that is roughly .050 points higher than their batting averages. More aggressive hitters will have a OBP closer to their batting average because they walk less. Those batters who are frequently walked can have on base percentages well over .500."
