RBI stands for "runs batted in" and is one of the most common baseball statistics. It refers to the number of runs that a batter directly contributes to their team by getting a hit or drawing a walk. Here is a deeper look at what constitutes an RBI, how they are recorded, and why RBIs are an important metric.

Definition of an RBI

A batter is credited with an RBI when:

They get a hit that allows a runner to score

They hit a sacrifice fly bringing home a run

They draw a walk or get hit by pitch with the bases loaded

They hit into a fielder's choice where a run scores

They hit a ground ball resulting in an error that allows a run

Simply put, any time a batter's plate appearance directly contributes to their team scoring a run, they are awarded an RBI.

How RBI's Are Scored

Official scorers carefully track when a batter's actions lead to a run. Common scenarios include:

Single drives in runner from third

Double scores runner from second

Triple brings home runners from first and second

Sac fly with runner on third tags to score

Bases loaded walk forces home a run

The key is the runner crosses home plate immediately as a direct result of the batter's plate appearance. Exceptions are scenarios like delayed steals where the runner started before the play.

Tracking RBI Totals

A batter's RBI total accumulates through the season based on each hit, walk, or sac fly that drives in runs:

Single knocks in one - RBI total +1

Double plates two - RBI total +2

Triple drives in three - RBI total +3

Sac fly adds one - RBI total +1

These contributions get added into their season and career RBI totals. Leaderboards rank players by season and all-time RBI's.

Significance of RBI's

RBIs have significance in baseball because:

They directly contribute to team scoring

They frequently occur with 2 outs, driving in "clutch" runs

High RBI guys are middle of the order "run producers"

Top RBI seasons often lead leagues and drive pennant runs

Driving in runs when it matters most is a key skill. RBI leaders Richard Hamilton and Manny Ramirez show the importance of cashing in runs.

Leading the League in RBI's

Driving in 100+ runs is an elite benchmark. Here are recent league RBI champions:

2022 AL - Aaron Judge (131)

2022 NL - Pete Alonso (131)

2021 AL - Salvador Perez (121)

2021 NL - Adam Duvall (113)

Sluggers like Aaron Judge put up insane RBI totals that separate them in the MVP races. Judge's 131 RBI in 2022 ranks as one of the best of the century.

All-Time RBI Leaders

Career leaders in MLB history for total RBI's include:

1. Hank Aaron - 2,297

2. Babe Ruth - 2,214

3. Alex Rodriguez - 2,086

4. Albert Pujols - 2,218

5. Barry Bonds - 1,996

Only the legendary Hank Aaron drove in over 2,000 runs. Active leader Albert Pujols (2,218 RBI) sits fourth and counting.

Top Single Season RBI Totals

Here are the best RBI seasons in MLB history:

1. Hack Wilson - 191 RBI (1930)

2. Lou Gehrig - 184 RBI (1931)

3. Hank Greenberg - 183 RBI (1937)

4. Juan Gonzalez - 157 RBI (1998)

5. Babe Ruth - 158 RBI (1921)

Hack Wilson's MLB record 191 RBI in 1930 came during an especially high offense era. The 191 mark is unlikely to ever be surpassed.

Game Winning RBI's

A batter is awarded a walk-off "Game Winning RBI" when:

Their walk off hit scores winning run

A runner scores on error on potential last out

They receive walk, HBP, or sac fly for winning run

These clutch RBI's that end the game create the most exciting moments. RBI leaders tend to have abundant walk-off RBI's on their resume.

Context for RBI Totals

While an important stat, RBI totals must be assessed in the context of factors like:

Games Played - Missing time impacts totals

Spot in Batting Order - RBI opportunities vary

Quality of Hitters Around Them - Protection impacts pitches to hit

High SLG%/XBH - More extra-base hits drive in more runs

Evaluating RBIs relative to at-bats and team lineup profile adds perspective on run production.

In summary, RBIs directly reflect a batter's ability to capitalize with runners on base to score runs. This key skill makes RBIs a useful metric to evaluate hitters.
