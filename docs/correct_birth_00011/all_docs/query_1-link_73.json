        "text": "Kanye West is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, fashion designer and self-named ‘genius’. Ye was born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago by his mother Donda West who was an English professor before she died in 2007 following complications from cosmetic surgery. Kanye quickly became one of the world's best-selling music artists, selling over 160 million records and winning 24 Grammy Awards. The rapper married reality TV star Kim Kardashian in 2014 and they share four children: North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm West. After his divorce from Kim was finalised, he married Yeezy architect Bianca Censori in January 2023 and the couple have been photographed in outlandish outfits amid rumours he will return to music."
