        "text": "Kanye West has been active in the music world since 1996 and has become one of the most influential & impactful hip-hop singers ever.\n\nHere’s a list of the top 30 facts about the musical genius Kanye West!\n\nHis birth name is Kanye Omari West; however, his legal name is Ye.\n\nKanye West is 47 years old. He was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 8, 1977, to Ray and Donda West.\n\nIn Swahili, the name Kanye is translated to mean “the only one.”\n\nHis mother was an English professor, and her profession took Kanye all the way to China, where she taught for a little over a year.\n\nWhile driving home in 2002, he was involved in a bad car accident. He almost died, sustaining very bad injuries.\n\nDuring his recovery in the hospital, he continued to produce music using an electronic drum kit and other equipment.\n\nThe holiday season doesn’t seem to stop Kanye West from working either, and on New Year’s Eve 2015, he released a single called ‘Facts.’\n\nBefore he recorded his own songs, he produced music for other stars, including Jay-Z. More than half of the tracks on Jay-Z’s ‘The Blueprint’ album was produced by Kanye West.\n\nKanye’s album, “The College Drop-out,” was aptly named after he dropped out of Chicago State University.\n\nBillboard ranked him 3rd on the list of producers from the decade in 2010.\n\nHe stated that Fiona Apple was one of his favorite artists, and he wanted to become the ‘rap version’ of her.\n\nSome of his nicknames included The Louis Vuitton Don and Yeezy.\n\nMore than 50% of his tracks have been the result of a collaboration with other artists.\n\nHe was engaged to Alexis Phifer, a fashion designer, from 2006 until their relationship ended in 2008.\n\nGQ awarded Kanye West the title of International Man of the Year in 2007.\n\nHis song ‘Hey Mama’ was dedicated to his mother, who died in 2007 after complications with plastic surgery.\n\nKanye West married model and actress Kim Kardashian on May 24, 2014. They have two children together – North and Saint.\n\nIn 2008, Kanye opened two burger restaurants. This new business venture, Fatburger, came to a sudden end when West suffered financial problems in 2011.\n\nHe met his stylist at Barney’s while out shopping. Yale student Cassius Clay impressed Kanye with his dress sense and was asked to work for him.\n\nIf you search Google for ‘gay fish’, Kanye West’s knowledge graph appears on the right. This is due to an episode of South Park called ‘Fishsticks’ where Kanye West is the only person in the country who fails to get a joke and can’t admit that he doesn’t understand because he believes himself to be a genius.\n\nHe sampled Chaka Khan’s vocals on his track ‘Through the Wire’, but she wasn’t prepared to let Kanye release the single until her son talked her into it a couple of weeks later.\n\nOn August 30, 2015, Kanye West publicly announced his plans to run for president at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nAfter Kanye interrupted Taylor Swift‘s acceptance speech at the VMAs in 2009, he left the country and visited Japan and Rome.\n\nHip-hop producer No I.D. was Kanye’s mentor in the early days and taught him how to create beats and make music.\n\nKanye West has said that he thought of becoming a porn star once or twice as a way of making money before his music career took off.\n\nHe has won a total of 21 Grammys and 112 music awards in general. ‘The College Drop-out’ and ‘Late Registration’ were the albums that won him the most awards.\n\nHis fashion sense has gained much attention around the world, and Michael Jackson phoned him once to ask about a jacket he had worn while filming the music video for ‘Stronger’.\n\nKanye is the sixth most popular digital artist, with a grand total of 30 million downloads within America as of January 2016.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Kanye’s favorite band is a group of indie artists from Glasgow, better known as Franz Ferdinand."
