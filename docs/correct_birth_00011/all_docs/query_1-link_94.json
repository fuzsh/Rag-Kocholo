        "text": "What’s this beat?\n\nWhen [Jay Z] first heard it, he stopped the beat, called Hip-Hop—who was my manager and also Hov’s main A&R—into the room, and started talking about, “Man, y’all understand what this is? Why y’all not hype?” Hov don’t ever show that much emotion, and he’s like “Yo, let’s call Hype Williams right now.” He started thinking up video concepts before he even wrote the rap. That’s how crazy—he just knew it was crazy like that.”\n\nSo is that done now?\n\nYeah, he got it up there right now but Beyoncé’s part is not on it yet. This right here is kind of crazy, though. [Turns up beat for “03 Bonnie & Clyde”] …I was supposed to write some shit like:\n\n[Rapping.]\n\nAyo, planes, trains, automobiles\n\nThe G500 with the auto-roll wheels\n\nThe Pinot Grigio got ‘em on chill\n\nSee now, see me hoe, I got that deal\n\nIf you trying to build, I bet you’d like that\n\nMy father was a Black Panther with Geronimo Pratt\n\nAnd back in college I ain’t run with no frat\n\nNow the Roc in the building UIC Pavillion\n\nTwo years ago I was just a civilian\n\nNow every chickenhead swear I got millions\n\nIn area codes with unidentified children...\n\nHold up, hold up. [Cuts off the beat, keeps rapping.]\n\nI used to want the Jordans that’s most recent\n\nNow I throw Jordans on the whip just to look decent\n\nJust to get pulled over by the precinct, so frequent\n\nIt’s like I’m back being a delinquent\n\nThey want to know where I live, stay and work\n\nHow a young black nigga get all these perks\n\nHow I stack my paper, got adidas in every flavor\n\nExcuse me officer, I don’t know Rod Laver\n\nOr Stan Smith\n\nWhat they don’t understand is, how I got that color in canvas.\n\nThen he got this other song that the Neptunes produced. I was like like, “Yo, man. I know you going to laugh when I say this but you need to let me rap on your first single, right?” [Laughs.]\n\nHow’d that go over?\n\nThe song was already complete, he wouldn’t let nobody—not Cam, not Beans, nobody was rapping on this shit. Not Michael Jackson. No one. I was like, Y’all gon’ be like ‘Damn, don’t he do beats too?’”\n\nBut my rap I had for it, it was like on some grown-man shit like how the rest of my album is. It was real similar to the vein of shit I talk about: Concepts, relationships, dealing with, like, real people, not just dealing with fans looking at stars or just like, “I’m a big rapper.” It’s more like “I’m one of y’all.” And that’s how Hov’s rap was, like, “Yo she’s talking to Shawn not Hov.”\n\nSo my rap, I came with said...\n\n[Rapping.]\n\nShe said “Kanye who? You produce?“\n\nAct like she all out of the loop\n\nLike I couldn’t make all this loot offa all these loops\n\nSays she don’t listen to Roc-A-Fella, she just listen to Roots\n\nSays she don’t like trucks, she just get into coupes\n\nSurvey says my chance is real low of knocking the boots\n\nI got a Plan B planned out for when things don’t pan out\n\nHov tell her you my brother and I’ma play Chi brother\n\nAnd you take the Destiny’s Child girl in the coupe\n\nAnd I’m gonna try to bag the ones that got kicked out the group\n\nFigure that’ll be simple, I just help them with they demo\n\nHelp them to the limo\n\nPlay nothing but instrumentals\n\nThat old Luther Vandross\n\nAl B gentle\n\n[Sings] I’ll be very gentle, remember that?\n\nShe grabbed my tattoo, peeped the credentials\n\nGrabbed my pants, peeped the potential\n\nWe breaking all the fundamentals\n\nTrying to find something fun to get into...”\n\n[ Laughs.]\n\nWhat are your parents’ names?\n\nDonda West and Raymond West.\n\nWhat do they do for work?\n\nMy father did a little bit of everything coming up. He was a photographer when I was young and he had a loft apartment when we stayed in Atlanta. They always had nice cribs.\n\nThen my father ended up being a salesman. I remember he was in vacuum cleaner sales and we used to go to white people’s houses and he’d sit up there and show them how powerful the vacuum cleaner was by putting a penny on the floor and then put the vacuum cleaner over it and then Pop! It would come out and he would have bent the penny. And then he’d get up there, like, “Look at this vacuum cleaner!” And he’d give them his card and he’d take me to go get some ice cream or something.\n\nAnd then the next day I’d see him go to some other white person’s house, put down the penny and shit, like, “Look at this vacuum cleaner!” We had a Nova and I remember some days we would ride around and he had vacuum cleaners in the back and we’d be going up a hill and the car would stop. And I just see him, like, “Not today. Not today.”\n\nHow long were your parents together?\n\nUntil I was like, 3.\n\nAnd then your father moved out?\n\nI used to go to Atlanta to see him, but when I was 6 or 7 he moved out to Maryland for a job. I forgot which job.\n\nDid he ever remarry?\n\nYeah. He married four times. He works as a Christian marriage counselor.\n\nI can see why.\n\nYeah. [Laughs.]\n\nHe probably knows a thing or two. And your mother?\n\n, who to me to this day was like my step-father. I feel like he helped teach me responsibility, like I ain’t get to go play basketball. I had to cut the grass—but look where I’m at.\n\nMy mother was going to be an actress when she was young. When she graduated from her four-year program to get her bachelor’s degree, she went to some acting tryout. And if she had gotten that she would’ve followed the acting. But she ain’t get it so she went back to school.\n\nWhere’d she go?\n\nShe went to Clark in Atlanta. That’s where she met my father. And now she got her Ph.D in English, so then she became a teacher and she found a job at Chicago State. I went to Chicago State for half price because I didn’t want to be in school no way. It was just something to do while my music wasn’t really popping. By that time my mother became the head of the English department. The first black chair of the English department at Chicago State University, not to mention female. So now she had the department and I could just turn in my homework whenever I wanted. My whole goal when I went to Chicago State was just to walk around with my Ghostface chain, Polo’d up. Just be the coldest.\n\nSo take me back to college, did you graduate from school?\n\nNah, man. I’m a college dropout. You ain’t heard the album title?\n\nNah.\n\nThat’s the album title.\n\nOh it is? Hey man, I’m right there with you.\n\nThat’s exactly what I want people to think with that title: “I’m right there with you.” I’ve thought about calling my shit I’m Good, because that’s a “cool” title, like just having a title that’s like, “Yo, you can’t criticize that.” But for me to try and put on the facade of being the coolest motherfucker ever, it’s not going to come across like that. I’m not saying I’m the coolest motherfucker ever, I got to put it in raps.”\n\nTell me about growing up in Chicago.\n\nIn Chicago you’re going to do one of three things. You’re either going to be sports—straight basketball or football—or you’re going to be hip-hop, like really focus on hip-hop and the culture—or you going to be gangbanging. You might be doing all this and gang-banging at the same time because 99 percent of people in Chicago is gangbanging.\n\nWe was gangbanging in kindergarten. We was on the school bus throwing up gang signs like, “Which gang sign was which again?” Perpetrating and shit. Moving our hats to the whatever side, and when the Starter coats came out, “I’ma get the Bulls and I’ma do this, this, this.” And if you wasn’t none of that, you was just a fucking lame and shit.\n\nThat’s how Chicago is. This gangbanging shit is so real that you not going to front whatsoever. Once you grown and you see niggas getting their heads chopped off and you going to funerals, you either going to take it to the fullest or you going to be like, “Nah, it’s not for me.” I know it’s not for me. I know that.\n\nSo basically, my main focus became music. I been making tracks since seventh grade. I was on the basketball team freshman year. I used to play for Eisenhower and we went to some tournament or something. But by sophomore year, I had been working on my music so much that by the time we went to tryouts, I’m just straight missing layups and shit.\n\nSo you just decided to...\n\nI didn’t decide. God decided for me. Niggas was looking at me like, “Maybe this just ain’t your sport.” I remember when we was in the layup line we had to clap our hands like this [regular clapping] but when I was doing my clap, my shit was more like [claps and knocks beat], and niggas was like, “Damn. Maybe that’s what you need to do and shit.” [Knocks twice.] So at that point, basically, I just switched over to focusing on that.\n\nYou said you used to bring back slang and whatnot from the East Coast.\n\nYeah. My father stayed in Delaware for the latter part of his life but his father was in the Air Force, so he had to fly around. He spent some of his high school years in Germany so he was never at one school. And they always stayed around white people.\n\nSo when he finally got the opportunity to go to a black school everybody was like, “Yo, you talk white.” They wouldn’t accept him. And when he was around white people, you were a nigga off the bat so they weren’t trying to accept him. I seen how that hurt him. So whereas my father struggled with that, basically I learned how to speak every language.\n\n—black people and white people interacting and racial profiling and all that—because I got locked up one day for having braids and driving in an Expedition. And they said, “Your braids is what gave you away.”\n\nHow all this relates is—I ain’t trying to front. I’m aware of shit. Because a lot of rappers.... Am I supposed to get here and say, “Yo man, I sold drugs and I did this?” Because I never did none of that. Is that automatically going to lower my record sales like crazy because I said I never sold crack? I apologize. I just went and got a job. Whatever.\n\nSo what was the first thing you started building beats on?\n\nThe Casio, that old sampler that everybody talks about they had. I didn’t have that until some talentless dude down the street had it. And he would never let me keep it—he’d just come over with it. My mom had bought me a keyboard. Just to establish, she didn’t know—I wanted to be a freestyle biker, I wanted to draw, make video games—so she didn’t know I wanted to make beats. I remember one day when I was making beats in her crib, she told me, But she’s never the type to say nothing negative toward music.\n\nShe wanted to get me the keyboard with the big keys so I could learn how to play. The other keyboards had small keys, but that one had sequences on it so I could play and save it. But she didn’t buy me that one because it was $50 more. She was like, “I don’t want to pay for that.” Then she turned around, totally redeeming herself, and she helped me get my ASR 10 keyboard.\n\nI really started getting into the music thing around freshman year—around the time of my short-lived hooping career. I was with my father when I was 14 years old talking about, “I want a Korg keyboard.” Because the best keyboard I ever saw was the Korg. So we went to a music shop and I said I want a Korg and the guy was like, “What kind of music do you make?” I said “hip-hop,” and he was like, “People like you do what they call sampling.” I could never figure out why EPMD beats were so much better than what I hear in my head.\n\nSo he went up to show me a keyboard, it was an old Ensoniq and I hit a key and it played the drums from “Summertime.” I was like, “Oh shit!” You would’ve thought I saw Michael Jackson or something. I was like “Damn. This is crazy. This shit sounds so cold.”\n\nI know you produced Grav’s “City to City.” Was that the first thing?\n\nYeah, the Grav album was the first shit that came out—damn, you brought it back for real. I did three joints on the album. I rapped on Grav’s album, too. I was 18 when I did Gravity’s album.\n\nYou were in school?\n\nI was going to college.\n\nWhere at?\n\nChicago. By that time I was going to Chicago State University. I met Grav when I was going to the American Academy of Art. With his album I made $8,800 off of eight beats altogether—like $1,100 a beat. I took half the money and I bought one of those Jesus pieces like everybody wore, but back then Ghostface was the first nigga with that chain. So I had a Ghostface Jesus piece and I spent the other half on Polo, because Polo was real in style. What was I going to get with $8,800? At least I got something that I could keep for a second, you know what I’m saying?\n\nThen it got to the point where No I.D. was finna play out his album, and he wanted my chain for the video shoot, but he didn’t want to wear somebody else’s chain. He said, “I’ll trade you my SP1200 for your chain” because my drums was weak so he was saying, “Yo, you need an SP1200.” I ain’t have no money, but I had the chain so we just traded and he rocked that chain in his first video with Doug Infinite.\n\nThat’s funny. The “State to State” video?\n\nYeah. I think that’s what it’s called.\n\nWhat records were pivotal to you?\n\nThe reason I’m so real today is because of MC Hammer and Kid ‘n Play. Those were my favorite rappers back in the day. I felt like they was real. They making music that I wanted to hear. I remember someone played me some Jungle Brothers, and I was like, “Ew, I’m not feeling that right there.” De La Soul’s “Me, Myself, and I” was the first hip-hop song I liked. At that point it was EPMD, Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Beastie Boys. Remember that? I’d be at my mama’s crib. This is back when people used to sit they record player on top of they TV.\n\nWhat music do you listen to for inspiration?\n\nMidnight Marauders. I listen to certain classics to figure out where I want to go. I listen to Lauryn Hill’s album, Pharcyde’s first album, that’s one of my favorite albums of all time. That joint still sells 1,000 a week.\n\nYou say you weren’t feeling the Jungle Brothers. Where did you pick up your ear for that sound?\n\nI got that from No I.D., from Common Sense’s first album, which is much later than the Jungle Brothers.\n\nIt’s definitely the same thing though.\n\nIt’s the same thing but the way they was doing it wasn’t like they made me want to do it. It’s kind of like how people had soul beats, but there’s something about the way me, Just Blaze, Bink, and Jay Z did on The Blueprint that made everybody want to do it. People had throwback jerseys for the longest. I went out and bought that actual jersey soon as I saw Big Boi in the “Sky High” Goodie Mob video. That was what, six years ago?\n\nYeah ’97 or ’98.\n\nOK, so four years ago. You remember when he had that throwback on?\n\nYeah!\n\nI went out and bought one. But there was something about Hov and Fabolous, something about the way they did it made everybody go out and get it. And I’m a good producer but the opportunity to have Hov rap on your beats makes all the difference in the world because he sets trends. People do what he does. They want to do whatever he does, , everything that people want to be. So when Hov rapped on soul beats everybody else wanted to rap on soul beats.\n\nYou worked with dead prez, Jermaine Dupri, and the Harlem World shit before 2000?\n\nYep.\n\nSpeaking of which, I just noticed that Harlem World had a joint from you and from Just Blaze.\n\nThat was crazy right?\n\nWas that random?\n\nMa$e is the type of rapper that wanted to give new producers that he felt a new drop. So let’s not forget Ma$e, to a certain extent, found Just Blaze, Kanye West, and The Neptunes. That’s a nigga that knows how to pick beats. Ma$e found them, but Hov—to a certain extent—made Just Blaze, Kanye West, and The Neptunes stars."
