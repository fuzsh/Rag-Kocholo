        "text": "In case you hadn’t noticed, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are officially divorced…after Kim filed all the way back in January 2021. And the whole two-year process was a slightly mysterious ride. Like, things seemed tense…then things seemed fine…then Kim started dating Pete Davidson (who got her name BRANDED on himself), and then Kanye made public statements about them getting back together and bought a house across the street from Kim’s place. Honestly, there was a lot going on and updates came every day, so we went ahead and put it all in one place for you: this timeline.\n\nQuick note though—this is in reverse chronological order so that you get the most hot-off-the-press info first! If you want to start from day one, then go back, back to the beginning and scroll right on down.\n\nJuly 6, 2023\n\nIn an episode of The Kardashians season 3, Kim speaks about her conflicting feelings for her former husband.\n\n“I feel so bad for him,” she says to her sister Khloé, confessing that she hasn’t spoken to the singer amid his online antisemitic attacks.\n\n“Then I feel guilty that I posted something in support of the Jewish community, then people dropped him today,” the reality TV star adds. “Then I'm like, 'Is that my fault that I posted that? Did that push them? Should I just have kept quiet?' But I'm vocal about everything else and I never know what to do.”\n\nAfterwards, during a later confessional, she muses, “I'm conflicted because I don’t ever want to jump in and be a part of a downfall for the father of my kids.”\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\nDecember 26, 2022\n\nKim gets emotional talking about the challenges of co-parenting with Kanye during an interview with Angie Martinez.\n\n“I had the best dad. I don’t want to get emotional, but it’s just been a day for me. It’s hard. Co-parenting, it’s really fucking hard,” Kim says. “I had the best dad and the best experiences, and that is all I want for my kids. As long as they can have that, that is what I want for them.”\n\nKim also explains that she tries to shield her kids from anything negative, saying, “It is [a full-time job]. It is worth it because I think that of course I want to disassociate in specific thoughts and things being said because that is not me. But at the same time in my home I could be going through something, but if we are riding to school and they want to listen to their dad’s music—no matter what we are going through—I have to have that smile on my face and blast his music and sing along with my kids. [I can] act like nothing is wrong, and as soon as I drop them off, I can have a good cry.”\n\nDecember 1, 2022\n\nPrior to getting suspended from Twitter, Kanye posts a series of tweets, including one in which he alleges that the reality TV star had cheated on him with professional basketball player Chris Paul. “Let’s break one last window before we get outa here,” the rapper writes alongside an image of Chris. “I caught this guy with Kim.”\n\nHowever, sources close to Kim fire back and insist that the rumor is just that. “This is not true and sadly it’s an ongoing pattern with Kanye—attacking Kim to redirect everyone’s attention after a day of antics where he has said every hateful and offensive thing he can possibly dream of,” said one insider who spoke with People.\n\nNovember 29, 2022\n\nKanye and Kim’s divorce is finalized after almost two years. The former couple will share joint physical and legal custody of their four children, and Kanye will pay Kim $200,000 a month in child support (as well as half of the kids’ educational and security costs). Both Kim and Kanye have waived spousal support.\n\nIf Kim and Kanye ever have a dispute about their kids, they’ve agreed to participate in mediation. However, TMZ notes that if one of them “fails to participate,” the other party gets to make the decision “by default.”\n\nNovember 22, 2022\n\nAfter Kanye skips out on his and Kim’s scheduled deposition, according to reports from TMZ, a new deposition is scheduled for November 29.\n\nOctober 2022\n\nKanye goes on a tirade of public controversies, making antisemitic remarks and anti-choice comments and wearing a “white lives matter” T-shirt to his daughter North’s basketball game, among other places. Sources tell TMZ that Kim “totally removed herself from the situation with Kanye” and that she hasn’t spoken “directly to him in weeks.”\n\nWhile Kim does not address Kanye directly, she takes to her Instagram Story to condemn antisemitism, saying, “Hate speech is never okay or excusable. I stand together with the Jewish community and call on the terrible violence and hateful rhetoric toward them to come to an immediate end,” she wrote.\n\nAugust 5, 2022\n\nThings are reportedly looking up for Kim and Kanye when it comes to co-parenting. Sources tell Us Weekly that the exes “have been co-parenting very well as of late.” The source adds, “They are very civil with each other, and right now, there are no issues. They are both treating each other with mutual respect.”\n\nJune 20, 2022\n\nKim shouts Kanye out on Father’s Day, thanking him for being “the best dad to our babies and loving them the way you do.”\n\nMay 11, 2022\n\nKim tells Kourtney Kardashian that after she styled herself for the Wall Street Journal Magazine Innovator Awards, Kanye said her career was over.\n\n“He called me afterward,” Kim told Kourt during the May 11 episode of The Kardashians (filmed on November 5, 2021). “He told me my career’s over and then he showed me a picture of Marge Simpson wearing something similar.” :(\n\nMay 4, 2022\n\nKim explains why Kanye walked out of her SNL monologue during The Kardashians’ May 4 episode, telling Khloé Kardashian, “He’s upset of the fact that I said ‘the reason I divorced him,’ used the word ‘divorced.’ So he wished I said the word ‘filed’ for divorce. And he was upset that I also said he was a rapper. He said, ‘I’m so much more than a rapper. I can’t believe you said rapper.’”\n\nKim added that Kanye is “so used to getting exactly what he wants” but that “it’s not gonna happen here.”\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nAfter several drama-free weeks, a source tells Entertainment Tonight that Kanye is trying to move on. “Kanye has been lying low and focusing on healing. He is trying to disconnect from all the drama that happened between him and Kim,” the source says. “He is focused on taking care of himself, getting healthier, and removing himself from all the craziness. He cares deeply about his family and kids. They are his number one priority and he’s working on himself.”\n\nMarch 16, 2022\n\nKanye is given a 24-hour suspension from Instagram beginning March 16 for violating policies on hate speech, bullying, and harassment.\n\nMarch 16, 2022\n\nIn an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Kim tells Ellen that she’s trying to “take the high road” in the exchanges with Kanye, especially since she wants her kids to see “the best.”\n\n“I always saw such a good example in my mom and my dad in their relationship, so I’m always just hopeful. And no matter what goes on, [he’s] the father of my kids. I’ll always be protective. I always want my kids to just see the best of the best. So I just try to—as hard as it can be sometimes—I do try to ignore it and just try to do whatever’s best for the kids.”\n\nSources tell Entertainment Tonight that Kim “doesn’t want anything bad to happen” but she might be “forced to take more drastic measures” if things between her and Kanye don’t become more amicable.\n\nMarch 14, 2022\n\nOne day after the text exchange with Pete, Kanye alludes to the fact that he doesn’t get to see his kids. Kim comments on the post saying, “Please stop with this narrative, you were just here this morning picking up the kids for school.”\n\nMarch 13, 2022\n\nIn since-deleted screenshots posted on his friend’s Instagram account, Pete texts Kanye with, “Yo it’s Skete, can you please take a second and calm down. It’s 8 a.m. and it don’t gotta be like this. Kim is literally the best mother I’ve ever met. What she does for those kids is amazing and you are so fucking lucky that she’s your kids’ mom. I’ve decided I’m not gonna let you treat us this way anymore and I’m done being quiet. Grow the fuck up.”\n\n“Pete stepped in because he couldn’t take seeing Kanye continue to throw Kim under the bus anymore,” a source tells Us Weekly. “Pete and Kim continue to get harassed, and Pete’s had enough of seeing Kim being made out to be the villain. Pete didn’t want to text Kanye, but he was pushed to the limit.”\n\nMarch 2, 2022\n\nKim is officially granted permission by a judge to change her legal marital status to single after virtually appearing in court on March 2, according to E! News. The decision comes not long after Kim said Kanye’s public treatment of their divorce process—which she's made clear she wants to be kept private—has caused her “emotional distress.”\n\nFebruary 4, 2022\n\nIn a rare move, Kim publicly acknowledges Kanye’s “constant attacks” on her in a lengthy Instagram Story after he speaks out about North being on TikTok against his wishes.\n\n“Kanye’s constant attacks on me in interviews and on social media is actually more hurtful than any TikTok North might create,” Kim says “As the parent who is the main provider and caregiver for our children, I am doing my best to protect our daughter while also allowing her to express her creativity in the medium that she wishes with adult supervision—because it brings her so much happiness.”\n\nShe continues, “Divorce is difficult enough on our children and Kanye’s obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negatively and publicly is only causing further pain for all. From the beginning, I have wanted nothing but a healthy and supportive co-parenting relationship because it is what is best for our children and it saddens me that Kanye continues to make it impossible every step of the way.”\n\nHours later, Kanye responds with, “What do you mean by main provider? America saw you try to kidnap my daughter on her birthday by not providing the address. You put security on me inside of the house to play with my son then accused me of stealing. I had to take a drug test after Chicago’s party ’cause you accused me of being on drugs. Tracy Romulus, stop manipulating Kim to be this way….”\n\nJanuary 18, 2022\n\nAmid a turbulent weekend and the misunderstanding about Chicago’s birthday party, a source tells Us Weekly that Kim is “hoping the divorce is settled soon” and that she’s “ready for that chapter to close for good.”\n\nJanuary 16, 2021\n\nThings get tense due to a misunderstanding about Chicago West’s birthday party, which Kanye (who is now dating actor Julia Fox) initially tells fans he wasn’t invited to. He ends up showing up at the party and is spotted chilling with Kris Jenner:\n\nA source then tells E! News that “Kanye was never not invited to the birthday party. Kim was under the impression he wanted to do his own celebration. She was fine about him coming to Kylie’s house and is happy the kids can see them together.”\n\nE!’s source adds that Kim “wants to be able to move on in peace,” while the entire Kardashian family “still love him and want him around” but also want “Kim to be at peace and to allow her to move on in her life. Kim is hoping they can have more of a structured schedule and Kanye will abide by it.”\n\nDecember 27, 2021\n\nKanye purchases the home directly across the street from the Hidden Hills mansion he shared with Kim—for $421,000 over the asking price. According to the Daily Mail and Dirt, Kanye spent $4.5 million on the “relatively modest” estate, which has 4 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, a guest studio, and horse stables.\n\nDecember 21, 2021\n\nKanye reportedly breaks up with model Vinetria.\n\nDecember 13, 2021\n\nKim files documents requesting to be “legally single” and move forward with her divorce from Kanye. The docs reportedly say that Kim’s been “attempting to settle this manner since she filed her Petition for Dissolution of Marriage in February 2021” and that she’s reached out to Kanye and his counsel to move the case forward but they’ve “been nonresponsive.”\n\nThe documents also claim that “the parties’ marriage has irremediably broken down,” that Kim “no longer desires to be married to Kanye,” and that “there are simply no compelling reasons not to grant a motion to bifurcate and terminate marital status in this case.”\n\nKim herself is quoted as saying “irreconcilable differences have existed and continue to exist between [West] and me, which have caused our marriage to irretrievably break down. No counseling or reconciliation effort will be of any value at this time.…[West] and I both deserve the opportunity to build new lives. Therefore, I am asking that my request to bifurcate and terminate our marital status be granted.”\n\nDecember 9, 2021\n\nKanye and Drake perform at the Free Larry Hoover benefit concert in L.A., where Kanye changes the lyrics to his song “Runaway,” saying, “I need you to run right back, baby, more specifically, Kimberly.”\n\n“Kimberly” trends worldwide as a result.\n\nA source later tells Page Six that Kim is “embarrassed” by Kanye’s public displays of affection, explaining, “Kim is making a statement by doubling down that she’s single. She thinks it’s strange that Kanye keeps saying he wants her back, but all the while he’s got [Vinetria] at his Malibu house.”\n\nNovember 25, 2021\n\nKanye gives an impromptu speech at Los Angeles Mission’s Annual Thanksgiving event, saying, “The narrative God wants is to see that we can be redeemed in all these relationships. We’ve made mistakes. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve publicly done things that were not acceptable as a husband, but right now today, for whatever reason—I didn’t know I was going to be in front of this mic—but I’m here to change the narrative.”\n\nHe adds that he’s not going to let E! and Hulu “write the narrative of his family” and says, “If the enemy can separate Kimye, there’s going to be millions of families that feel like that separation is okay. But when God brings Kimye together, there’s going to be millions of families that are going to be influenced to see that they can overcome the work of the separation, of trauma the devil has used to capitalize to keep people in misery while people step over homeless people to go to the Gucci store.”\n\nNovember 5, 2021\n\nAmid early reports that Kim is dating Pete Davidson, Kanye gives a rare interview to Drink Champs and makes it clear that he wants to stay married to Kim, saying they aren’t technically divorced yet. “SNL making my wife say ‘I divorced him’ on TV because they just wanted to get that bar off, and I ain’t never even seen the papers,” he said, referencing Kim’s Saturday Night Live monologue. “We’re not even divorced…that ain’t no joke to me. My kids want they parents to stay together. I want us to be together.”\n\nAugust 26, 2021\n\nKim wears a wedding dress to Kanye’s third Donda listening event, and the former couple seemingly recreate their wedding vows—prompting speculation that they’re remarried.\n\nHowever, TMZ reports that Kimye aren’t back together and are simply “family forever.”\n\nAugust 6, 2021\n\nKim once again supports Kanye at a Donda listening event and shares footage from the evening:\n\nHe also reportedly describes their marriage as the “best collab since Taco Bell and KFC.”\n\nJuly 23, 2021\n\nKim supports Kanye at his first Donda listening event, showing up in a matching red outfit:\n\nKanye also references his divorce from Kim on a track titled “Love Unconditionally,” saying repeatedly, “I’m losing my family / I’m losing my family / I’m losing my family.”\n\nJuly 20, 2021\n\nKimye hang in San Francisco and take their four children (North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm) to the Asian Art Museum. A source tells Us Weekly that “they came in as a normal family who was there to have fun. They had light security with them and didn’t even have nannies.” Note: Kanye proposed to Kim in San Francisco, and the source adds that “it’s nice to see them revisiting the city that’s special to them and now bringing their kids along for the ride.”\n\nJune 12, 2021\n\nKanye unfollows Kim and the Kardashian family on Twitter amid Irina Shayk romance rumors!\n\nJune 10, 2012\n\nKim opens up more about her divorce on the finale of KUWTK, telling Kris Jenner, “After turning 40 this year, I realized, like, No, I don’t want a husband that lives in a completely different state. To me, I thought, Oh my god, that’s when we’re getting along the best, but then that is sad to me and that’s not what I want. I want someone that we have the same shows in common. I want someone who wants to work out with me.”\n\nJune 8, 2021\n\nKim wishes Kanye a happy birthday on Twitter:\n\nJune 4, 2021\n\nKim opens up about her divorce from Kanye on KUWTK:\n\n“I just think he deserves someone who will support his every move and go follow him all over the place and move to Wyoming. I can’t do that,” she says. “He should have a wife that supports his every move and travels with him and does everything, and I can’t. I feel like a fucking failure. It’s my third fucking marriage. Yeah, I feel like a fucking loser. But I can’t even think about that. I want to be happy.”\n\nApril 28, 2021\n\nFans notice that Kanye’s still wearing a wedding ring in this photo posted by DJ Khaled:\n\nApril 19, 2021\n\nA source tells Page Six that Kanye is “super annoyed that the story is being constantly presented as her divorcing him.…Actually, it was him saying for a year that they have nothing in common except the kids and he wanted out. She pulled all the stops to try to save the marriage.” The source also alleges Kanye let Kim “file first in order to give her dignity.”\n\nApril 13, 2021\n\nKanye responds to Kim’s divorce filing and—like her—files paperwork seeking joint legal and physical custody of their kids. He also cites “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the split.\n\nApril 5, 2021\n\nKim subtly supports Kanye by posting a photo of herself wearing Yeezys:\n\nMarch 11, 2021\n\nThings take a turn for the dramatic, and Page Six reports that Kanye changed his number and asked that Kim contact him through his security team. As a source tells the outlet, “Even before Kim filed for divorce, Kanye changed his numbers and said, ‘You can contact me through my security.’ She leaves the house and he arrives and hangs out with the kids. They have an army of nannies so the transition is easy.”\n\nFebruary 22, 2021\n\nA source tells People that Kim is “disappointed” she and Kanye “couldn’t figure out how to stay married,” and while there’s no drama between them “it takes two people to create a happy marriage. Kim has felt Kanye is not willing to do the hard work and compromise.”\n\nMeanwhile, another source tells the outlet that Kanye “knew it was coming, but that doesn’t make it any easier.”\n\nFebruary 19, 2021\n\nTMZ, Page Six, and E! News report that Kim has officially filed for divorce, so there you have it.\n\nThe docs reportedly say Kim is asking for joint legal and physical custody of the couple’s four kids, and sources tell TMZ that Kanye and Kim are both cool with this.\n\nFebruary 18, 2021\n\nMultiple reports drop about how Kim and Kanye are coping with the divorce proceedings, and things sound pretty amicable, all things considered.\n\nA source tells Entertainment Tonight that “Kim and Kanye are trying their best to keep their relationship issues a private matter, especially for the sake of the kids,” adding, “Kim is extremely stressed out right now between taking care of their children, studying to become a lawyer, and figuring out her situation with Kanye in the best way possible for both their kids and for him and his mental state.”\n\nPeople interviews a separate insider, who says Kanye’s having some trouble with the split because he really does love Kim. “Kanye is not doing well. He is anxious and very sad. He knows that the marriage is over and there’s nothing that can be done right now. He also knows what he is losing in Kim.”\n\nThe source adds, “There is very little hope of reconciliation. It would have to be a miracle. But Kanye does believe in miracles.”\n\nFebruary 12, 2021\n\nTo the surprise of literally no one, reports say Kim and Kanye will not be spending Valentine’s Day together this year.\n\n“Kim is great,” People reports. “She has a Valentine’s Day celebration planned with her kids and family. She likes to make it special for the kids. She doesn’t have any contact with Kanye. It’s obvious that she is just focused on the future.”\n\nFebruary 3, 2021\n\nPage Six reveals that Kanye has moved his personal items out of his and Kim’s Calabasas home—including 500 pairs of sneakers. He made sure to move his belongings while Kim was on vacation because “they both felt it would be less dramatic without both of them in the house.”\n\nThat same day, People reports that Kim and Kanye “have no contact,” and get this: Their source reveals that “her issues with Kanye are a big part of the final season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and she will likely “file for divorce when the season has aired.”\n\nJust gonna…drop…this…here:\n\nAnyway, not to be outdone, Entertainment Tonight also drops a new report with a source saying, “Neither Kim nor Kanye is interested in dating anyone at this time.”\n\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\nFans notice that Kim’s brand-new Skims showroom is literally Kanye West’s old closet, which he showed David Letterman during a Netflix special. So yeah, looks like his stuff is officially gone:\n\nFebruary 1, 2021\n\nKim drops a bikini pic from vacation that features a pair of Yeezys, making a pretty clear statement that she and Kanye are on good terms:\n\nJanuary 27, 2021\n\nUs Weekly reports that Kim has been working with “her financial advisers to figure out an exit plan that would be best for her whole family.” Here’s what the source said:\n\n“Kim has had all of her and Kanye’s financials and properties ready to be split—it’s a very fair deal for everyone. Kim has all of her assets and financials ready for when she decides to file officially. Friends thought she was going to file in September, but she’s holding out. That does not mean that everything behind the scenes is already done.”\n\nJanuary 19, 2021\n\nPage Six answers the question on everyone’s mind: Yep, Kimye’s divorce will be on KUWTK. Straight from ~a~ source:\n\n“The Kardashians intend to go out with a bang. They’ve filmed Kim discussing her marriage problems. But everybody involved is on a nondisclosure agreement, because the finale won’t screen until later in 2021.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kanye apparently “understands Kim’s side has to spin that she is sick of him. In reality, he’s been sick of being involved with [the] Kardashians for a long while. Especially her mother, who looms large in all big decisions she makes.”\n\nTruly !!!! but there’s even more: Kanye also “is quite familiar with what the Kardashian public relations machine is capable of and thinks it’s funny that her team is blaming his presidential run on the marriage disintegration.”\n\nJanuary 18, 2021\n\nPeople reports that Kimye have “completely” stopped their counseling sessions and that Kanye “is talking to divorce lawyers this week.”\n\nJanuary 14, 2021\n\nE! News reports that “Kim and Kanye have no bad blood and they are very cordial. He’s focusing on his world and she is focusing on her world.” The source also says that “Kim wants to feel at peace going into this new chapter of her life and is focused on herself and her children.” In terms of how the rest of the family feels, the source says, “All of the sisters are aware of the situation and are very supportive. They all love Kanye like a brother but agree it’s best they part ways.”\n\nJanuary 8, 2021\n\nFans notice that Kim deleted a photo of herself sans ring that was initially posted on January 5. Since the internet never forgets, here ya go!\n\nJanuary 6, 2021\n\nIn an attempt to shed light on what’s happening, even, an Us Weekly source says, “Kanye is jealous of the amount of time Kim has dedicated to prison reform and the kids. Kanye wanted the family to move to Wyoming full-time. It’s where he sees this direction of his life going. Kim just doesn’t see their lives full-time in Wyoming.”\n\nThe source also says that Kimye have been in marriage counseling but “haven’t had a joint session together in a while.”\n\nJanuary 5, 2021\n\nThe day it all goes down! Page Six comes outta left field and drops a lengthy report that Kim and Kanye are getting divorced, with multiple sources confirming that “divorce is imminent” and Kim had hired attorney Laura Wasser. A source also claims that Kanye “is completely over the entire family” and finds KUWTK “unbearable.” Okay!!!!!\n\nAfter several breathless hours, an E! (home of KUWTK) source confirms that, yep, Kimye is done—Kim just hasn’t filed yet.\n\n“Kim wants to make sure she’s making the right decision for the kids. It’s gotten to the point where they haven’t spent time together as a married couple in months. They’ve seen each other for the sake of the kids but have been living separately. Kim knows the marriage is over. She’s known for a while.”\n\nMeanwhile, a bunch of other sources start doing the most, with People’s insider confirming Kanye is “sad but okay” and someone telling Us Weekly that Kimye “had a big fight in early December.”\n\nDecember 22, 2020\n\nKim posts a picture of herself on vacation in Lake Tahoe. Go ahead and zoom in, ’cause her engagement ring? Missing."
