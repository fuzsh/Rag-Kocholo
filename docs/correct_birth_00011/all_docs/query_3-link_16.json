        "text": "Kanye Omari West (born June 08, 1977) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, entrepreneur, and fashion designer. Over the course of his career, West has inspired massive developments in hip hop and popular music in general. His musical career has drawn from eclectic influences including soul, R&B, electro, indie rock, synth-pop, industrial music, and other artistic mediums such as digital art and architecture[1][2].\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia and raised in Chicago, Illinois, West first became known as a Roc-A-Fella Records producer in the early 2000s, producing singles for famous recording artists such as Jay-Z, Ludacris, and Alicia Keys. More interested in pursuing a career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Bassett to critical and commercial success, and founded record label GOOD Music. He experimented with other musical styles in subsequent albums, including Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), which contains acclaimed single \"Flashing Lights\", and the polarizing but influential 808s & Heartbreak (2008). In 2010, West released My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which is considered one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. He has since released albums Yeezus (2013), The Life of Pablo (2016), and Ye (2018), along with collaborations Watch the Throne (2011) and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Jay-Z and Kid Cudi, respectively.\n\nRead more here...\n\nTrivia\n\nOn October 31, 2019, West and his children dressed up as Big Daddy, Johnny, and Ash for Halloween[3]."
