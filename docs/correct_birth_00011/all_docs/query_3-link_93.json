        "text": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West took time out from welcoming their new-born son Psalm last night by heading out for some Italian food.\n\nThe arrival of the couple’s fourth child, who was born via surrogate on 10 May, has no doubt occupied plenty of their time over the past two weeks.\n\nBut KimYe took time out for themselves yesterday (23 May) as they were spotted going into the Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, California.\n\nPsalm is the couple’s fourth child, following on from North (5 years old), Saint (3) and Chicago (1).\n\nKim lavished praise on her new son as she announced his birth earlier this month, calling him ‘perfect’.\n\nMeanwhile, a source close to the couple has claimed this week that the family spend an alleged £1 million a year on childcare.\n\n‘Right now, what’s costing them the highest by far though are the nannies,’ the source said.\n\n‘They have teams of staff on call 24/7, and when they’re away they take a nanny with them to help out if they’re too busy. It costs them anything from $50-100k in monthly bills.’\n\nIt was also reported earlier this week that the couple have already moved to trademark the name Psalm West.\n\nThe action, which was apparently filed by Kim’s company, is thought to cover everything from entertainment services and skin care to hair extensions and pushchairs.\n\nMORE : Kanye West opens up on ‘erratic’ behaviour as he deals with bipolar diagnosis with David Letterman"
