        "text": "Bear witness to Ye, the man formerly known as Kanye West! Whether you love him or loathe him, few can stir the infamy that West, 44, has within the media.\n\nHis notoriety is one he capitalizes upon brilliantly. A polarizing figure, as if drawn between extremes, his fiery personality has struck fear and awe into the public. With an extensive dating history and ongoing separation from his 41-year-old wife, Kim Kardashian — as well as many famous fights (with major celebs like Taylor Swift, Jay-Z and Drake) and bromances (with political figures such as fellow Gemini Donald Trump) — West lives his life with little grace. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder and a fan of creepy masks, one is left to wonder if the “Donda” singer, producer and fashion designer is the villain or the victim of a modern perfect storm.\n\nLet’s consult the stars to gain a clearer perspective of who he is and where he is headed!\n\nKanye West’s birth chart shows that he is a creative genius\n\nKanye West was born on June 8, 1977. His birth time hasn’t been confirmed, so we can’t truly assess his ascendant, but we can still glean a lot of striking secrets about him.\n\nFirst off, we know that he is a sharp Gemini sun with a tumultuous Pisces moon. He is a natural-born communicator with an agile mind and a knack for channeling inspirational ideas in ways that make people think. He craves spontaneity in life and despises structure, limits and restrictions — something that leads him to be quite impulsive, spontaneous and adventurous.\n\nOn the one hand, that means that he is able to experience more in life because he’ll chase new horizons and dare to go where other people would be too cautious to explore. On the other hand, it can also lead him to be somewhat of a hurricane. However, as any great artist knows, creation and art are an act of chaos. In that tempest, something beautiful can emerge. But there is also a high possibility of destruction from that kind of energy, too.\n\nHe also possesses some extremely rare alignments that caught my interest right away. Jupiter, the planet of expansion, is united in the same place in the sky as his sun. This brings someone a larger-than-life quality that encourages them to step up courageously as a leader. However, the most notable quality that runs through his chart repeatedly is that he is drawn too far into extremes — and, in this case, it means he can also be prone to egomania and vanity. It is difficult to satisfy his never-ending lust for life and experience. That can certainly give someone great luck but is always best when balanced — which West has nothing in his birth chart to do.\n\nWhen it comes to creative brilliance, though, I noticed that his Venus, the planet of art, is united with Mars, the planet of passion. This is one of the strongest aspects in his chart that fuels his artistic intensity. With them being so aligned, he can channel his ideas — and chaos — into projects that have a profound impact. This isn’t just limited to music; it is why he has also ventured into other mediums, as well.\n\nAre Kanye West and Julia Fox compatible?\n\nWell, the news broke that Ye and actress Julia Fox are dating — but is this a revenge rebound against Kim Kardashian now that she’s official with “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson? (Spoiler alert: kind of, yes.) But just for fun, let’s take a quick peek at their stars.\n\nFirst and foremost, we can see that Fox was born on Feb. 2, 1990. That makes her an Aquarius dun with a Taurus moon. Compatible? Right off the bat: definitely. They have a natural affinity between them as their sir duns energize each other’s excitement and natural personalities. Oh, and their moons blend sweetly, sort of like Ye can supply the creativity and magic that keeps Fox’s spirit thriving. Their natal charts blend beautifully together overall as well, with lots of optimism, stability and passion, too. Chemistry? Yup. They see one another initially as a conquest but realize that there’s a genuine friendship and spark. So when people are claiming these two are “kindred spirits,” I wholeheartedly see the attraction.\n\nHowever— and this is a big “however “— taking it slowly until mid-February 2022 will be crucial to see if this union can last because Venus, the planet of romance and love, is retrograde, which means she is weakened and no one (especially these two lovebirds) is seeing clearly in matters of the heart. Worse: If they’re making it official during this time, it also means that the union will 100% fail in the end or, at the very least, lose its sparkle and affection.\n\nKanye West’s birth chart shows eternal struggle\n\nBut then we get to all this other stuff in his natal chart that makes my heart hurt for him — and understand him better.\n\nMy particular brand of astrology teaches that all challenges in our charts or sky are actually advantages to grow, become stronger and ultimately teach a lesson. However, you have to be open to the lesson; otherwise, the storm consumes you. In West’s birth chart, there are a multitude of planetary aspects that spell eternal conflict and possible disillusion with reality — so far out of touch that one may even consider themselves to be a conduit for a higher power. I know for a fact, having studied people’s charts for decades, that certain individuals do possess a higher aptitude for psychic or spiritual awareness — but then there are those who do not know how to channel it and end up simply getting lost beneath the sea.\n\nWhen you add money, power and fame to the equation, the results can be deadly.\n\nIn West’s chart, we see that his Saturn, ruling strength, aligns with Neptune, the planet of fantasy. I like this because it does show great success in a musical career (seriously, I’m not making this up), but it also means that he is an individual who despises restrictions and limits and will go to extremes to not be controlled. Then, his sun is clashing with his moon directly, which means that he only knows life to be one of conflict and struggle, filled with arguments and a lack of harmony. Sure, he may sometimes find peace for a period, but it will likely bore him and cause him to start fights with others because that is the only way he knows how to survive. (Let’s just use his feuds with Taylor Swift, Jay-Z and Drake as obvious examples.)\n\nAnd then there’s the cult-like energy that infuses the majority of his chart. His Sun and Jupiter violently clash with Neptune, which can certainly bring someone a visionary imagination but ultimately says that he must learn to balance the spiritual dimension with ordinary life. His imagination ultimately clouds his judgment, and he has a propensity to seek personal glorification for all of his efforts — even to the point of embracing religion as a tool to make brash statements, such as a claim that God made him storm the stage during Swift’s infamous VMAs speech. No, bro. Have a seat.\n\nThen we see his Jupiter linking with Pluto, the planet of the underworld, and his Moon under siege from Neptune. Yes, he has the strong powers of a mystic, but he is ultimately prone to self-deception and likely doesn’t even like living in a practical world. Instead, the more that his ego grows without self-control, the more he further sabotages himself and leans into bizarre behavior, paranoia and creepy masks.\n\nIn no way am I degrading this man: I always seek to have a high code of integrity in my life and my work. I just ultimately feel for him. And I genuinely wish him the best. In fact, I’d even give him a hug because — viewing all of this — I think sometimes he might need it.\n\nKanye West’s future will have the good, the bad and the ugly\n\nSo what lies ahead for Ye? Spoiler alert: He has some great things to look forward to, but there’s also a tremendous amount of challenges he is going to have to step through, too. It will take great effort for him to navigate those land mines, but with over a billion dollars to his name, I’m sure he will find the right help and be able to do so.\n\nLet’s start with the good news! In 2022, he will have planets that energize his sector of professional victories. Awards? Hell, yes. Greater exposure? Also yes. In the summer of 2022 and again in early 2023, he’ll feel a greater synergy with his tribe and close personal connections. In that regard, I think he will be happier than ever.\n\nBut then there are also the obstacles I see for him, too. Saturn, the planet of hardship and life lessons, is standing across the sky from his natal Saturn (where it was when he was born). That will give him a stronger ability to analyze his past as well as have easier separation from people who aren’t in alignment with the next chapter of his life.\n\nIf he owns his behavior, he will distance himself from self-destructive habits. However, that also bodes difficulty with the law and the disruption of his social status that is hitting in the second half of 2021 and on into 2022, too. That could bring health problems, either mental or physical. That also leads me to the most troubling news: He is beginning to enter an eclipse cycle that affects his mental and physical health, too. For some people, this means dealing with addictions, having a mental breakdown, going to rehab or being admitted to a hospital for surgeries. This energy starts now and echoes until the end of 2023. We all have free choice, so the path he decides to embark upon will be his own creation — or undoing.\n\nThe last thing I will leave you with in regards to Mr. West is that the nodes in his chart ultimately discuss his true destiny in this lifetime. When one pursues the energy of their North Node, they live an easier and more fulfilled life. Yet when they fall back on the patterns attributed to their South Node, they stifle themselves and end up repeating negative patterns. West’s North Node is in Libra — the zodiac sign of balance, equilibrium and partnership. This is what he needs to embrace in this lifetime. His South Node is in Aries — the zodiac sign of ego, individuality and independence. That means that he’s falling back on what he’s comfortable with, rather than actually growing and changing in the way the universe has meant for him.\n\nI hope, for his sake, he finds peace with that karma someday. He deserves that. It is his destiny."
