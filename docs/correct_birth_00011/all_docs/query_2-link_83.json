        "text": "Fame is often achieved on the precipice of years of labor and hard work. This has been no different for Kanye West, one of the most famous music artists ever to come out of America. Like many artists and creators today, Kanye faced rejection at the early stages of his career. He even had to drop out of college to chase his dreams. Against all odds, he made it in the creative industry and has been on the big stage ever since.\n\nThis article is not an exposé on the life of Kanye West. It is a piece written to show creators that their situation is not peculiar and that they can rise to stardom against all odds. It is a piece that showcases the need for change in the global creative space.\n\nThe Early Life of Kanye West\n\nKanye West was born on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia. He grew up in Chicago, Illinois, where he developed a passion for music at an early age. During his high school years, Kanye West displayed a keen interest in art and music. He began making music in his basement, sampling and creating beats.\n\nDespite his academic achievements, Kanye faced challenges within the traditional education system. He attended Polaris High School but later transferred to the South Shore Academy, where he had the opportunity to pursue his artistic interests.\n\nIn pursuit of his music career, Kanye West eventually dropped out of college. He briefly attended Chicago State University but left before completing his degree to fully focus on his passion for music production. West’s decision to drop out of college was driven by his unwavering belief in his talent and his desire to dedicate his energy to pursuing a career in music.\n\nThis bold choice marked a turning point in his life, as he went on to work with prominent artists, producing critically acclaimed albums, and become one of the most influential figures in contemporary music.\n\nStruggles and rejections\n\nAs an upcoming artist, Kanye West faced several rejections and obstacles before achieving success in the music industry.\n\nBefore Kanye West became a well-known rapper and producer, he struggled to secure a record deal, with labels not fully recognizing his talent and unique style.\n\nKanye’s struggle reached a peak when he was rejected by Roc-A-Fella Records. Kanye West initially aspired to be a rapper and producer and tried to gain the attention of Roc-A-Fella Records, a prominent hip-hop label co-founded by Jay-Z. However, he faced rejection from the label multiple times, as they did not see him as a viable rapper.\n\nDespite facing rejection, Kanye West continued to work on his craft and eventually produced his own music. However, when he presented his debut album, “The College Dropout,” to record labels, they were hesitant to sign him as a solo artist. They were uncertain about his ability to transition from being a producer to a successful rapper.\n\nAlso, Kanye West invested his own money to produce his music and projects in the early stages of his career. For instance, when he was trying to establish himself as a rapper, he used his own funds to create and distribute mixtapes during his struggle to establish himself as an artist.\n\nHis “Get Well Soon” and “Freshmen Adjustment” mixtapes are some of the early works that he released independently. They ultimately helped him solidify his position as a unique talent while serving as a precursor to his debut album, “The College Dropout”.\n\nIt is important to note that while mixtapes are typically free or low-cost releases, they serve as crucial platforms for artists to gain exposure and attract industry attention. Kanye West leveraged the power of mixtapes to showcase his skills, build a fanbase, and create buzz around his music, ultimately paving the way for his successful career as a rapper and producer.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 challenges facing global creators\n\nMajor breakthrough and rise to stardom\n\nKanye West had his breakthrough in the early 2000s as a producer and rapper. His significant breakthrough moment came with the release of his debut album, “The College Dropout,” in 2004. The album received critical acclaim and commercial success, introducing Kanye West as a unique and innovative voice in hip-hop.\n\nIt featured hit singles like “Through the Wire” and “Jesus Walks” and tackled personal and societal themes, resonating with a wide audience. “The College Dropout” went on to win multiple awards, including a Grammy for Best Rap Album.\n\nSince his breakthrough, Kanye West has consistently pushed the boundaries of music and fashion, becoming an iconic figure in both industries. He has released several highly successful albums, including “Late Registration” (2005), “Graduation” (2007), “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” (2010), and “Yeezus” (2013). Each of these albums showcased his artistic evolution and garnered critical acclaim.\n\nIn addition to music, Kanye West has ventured into fashion with his Yeezy brand, collaborating with renowned brands like Adidas.\n\nExciting piece: What are soulbound tokens?\n\nLessons for creators\n\nThis piece chronicles the emergence of Kanye West as a global music star. It digs beyond Kanye West as the superstar we know today to reveal his early life and how his undying passion for creativity eventually brought him to the forefront of global music. Nonetheless, Kanye encountered a series of rejections and even had to fund his own songs as an independent artist.\n\nWhile Kanye built his reputation in a world devoid of social media and music streaming platforms, he utilized the resources he had at his disposal (mixtapes) to create, document, and distribute his unique style to the people around him.\n\nThis is a vital lesson for all creators today. They must learn to utilize the tools and resources around them to build, create, and consolidate their artistic work while preparing for the big breakthrough."
