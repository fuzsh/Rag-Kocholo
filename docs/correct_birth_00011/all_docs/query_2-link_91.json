        "text": "Kanye West is a big name on the hip-hop scene. Born 29 years ago in Atlanta, Georgia, Kanye is best known as the producer and rapper of the smash hit \"Through the Wire\". With immaculate sense of success, Kanye finds the best way to canalize his rap makings. First he starts as a producer, mixing and beating, and is soon noticed by Jay-Z, who hires him to produce songs for The Blueprint in 2001. Kanyes noticeable work earns him contracts with other celebrities such as: Ludacris, Alicia Keys and Jamie Foxx. After several years of producing Kanye decides to concentrate on a solo career as a rapper that gives birth to his 2004 debut album, The College Dropout. The album spawns the smash hits \"Jesus Walks\" and \"Through the Wire\" and wins three Grammys, including Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song (\"Jesus Walks\"). One year later comes up the even more successful Late Registration that earns 8 Grammy nominations as three of them turn into awards: for Best Rap Album, Best Rap Solo Performance (for \"Gold Digger\") and Best Rap Song (\"Diamonds From Sierra Leone\")."
