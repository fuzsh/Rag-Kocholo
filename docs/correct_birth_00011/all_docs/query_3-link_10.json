        "text": "Kanye West, also known as Ye, is simultaneously one of the most original and trailblazing artists of the 21st century — and one of its most polarizing.\n\nBorn Kanye Omari West on June 8, 1977, he was raised in Chicago primarily by his mother, Donda West, a professor of English who instilled a lifelong love of the arts and a profound self-confidence in her only son. By his early twenties, he’d gravitated toward hip-hop production, learning about the industry by working under more established producers like No I.D. and Deric “D-Dot” Angelettie. At the dawn of the 2000s, he became one of the go-to producers for the ascendant Roc-A-Fella Records. His breakthrough came when he produced a third of Jay-Z’s acclaimed 2001 album The Blueprint, deftly reworking vocal samples from old soul, R&B, and rock hits on songs like “Heart of the City,” “Izzo (H.O.V.A.),” and “The Takeover.” But West wanted to be more than the hottest producer in the game: He wanted to be a superstar.\n\nBefore he could get there, he broke his jaw in a 2002 car crash. He used that accident to dramatic effect on his debut single, “Through the Wire,” rapping with his jaw wired shut over a Chaka Khan sample. The song became a hit, as did his full-length debut, 2004’s The College Dropout, where West used his middle-class upbringing, his everyman image, and his generational gifts as a producer to remake himself as an unlikely rap star. Songs like “Jesus Walks” and “Slow Jamz” were unlike anything else in rap or pop music in the early 2000s, and West made the most of his unique perspective and sound. He aimed even higher with 2005’s bombastic, orchestra-assisted Late Registration and 2007’s glossy, triumphant Graduation (the latter of which memorably won a first-week-sales battle with 50 Cent, commemorated on the cover of Rolling Stone). The music was brilliant and the Grammy Awards shined bright.\n\nWest’s career took a turn after the unexpected death of his mother in November 2007. The loss affected him profoundly, and his next album, 808s & Heartbreak, was met with mixed reviews — although its moody synth-pop sound ended up proving to be a major influence on later stars like Drake. In 2009, West stepped into a firestorm of criticism by interrupting Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards, insisting on live television that her award for Best Female Video was undeserved: “Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'ma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time.” Instantly, West became the target of intense public anger, not all of it fair; President Barack Obama called West “a jackass.” West retreated from the music industry, reemerging a year later in 2010 with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a spellbinding look at his own flaws and American celebrity culture that won rave reviews and largely repaired his reputation. He continued this second career high point with 2013’s harsh, minimalist Yeezus, once again wowing critics and fans."
