        "text": "Kanye West has found “True Love” with Bianca Censori after his divorce from Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe rapper’s relationship with his former Yeezy employee took the internet by storm in January 2023 amid backlash over his disturbing anti-Semitic tirades.\n\nThen, in a shocking turn of events, it was revealed that the pair had secretly married in December 2022 prior to going public with their romance.\n\nSince then, the couple have been making headlines for their head-turning fashion choices and PDA-packed outings.\n\nKeep scrolling below for their complete relationship timeline.\n\nNovember 2020: Paths cross\n\nCensori, who is 18 years West’s junior, started working for the rapper’s fashion brand, Yeezy, as an architectural designer in November 2020.\n\nIn fact, one of her former friends alleged in an interview on the “Ben, Liam and Belle” show that Censori dropped out of University of Melbourne after the rapper slid into her DMs.\n\n“Ye slid into her DMs, found her on Instagram and said, ‘Come and work for me,’ and she dropped out. I’m not actually sure if she’s an architect,” the friend once claimed.\n\nShe also revealed that Censori was “not a huge fan” of the rapper’s music before getting involved with him.\n\nDecember 2022: ‘Censori Overload’\n\nWhile it’s unclear exactly when the pair’s professional relationship turned personal, the first sign of a romance came in December 2022 when West released a song titled “Censori Overload” as a direct nod to his new flame.\n\nEarly January 2023: Romance rumors swirl\n\nWest and Censori were first photographed together in early January 2023 while dining together at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills, where the “Heartless” rapper was reportedly living at the time.\n\nDays prior to their low-key lunch date, the couple had been photographed arriving at the ritzy hotel hand in hand.\n\nMid-January 2023: Wedding bells ring\n\nOn Jan. 13, 2023, TMZ reported the couple had secretly wed during a “private ceremony” in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nAlthough the pair exchanged wedding rings and vows, the outlet claimed they never filed a marriage certificate to make their union a legally binding one.\n\nHowever, the Daily Mail revealed in October 2023 that Ye and Censori were, in fact, legally married.\n\nThe newspaper obtained a confidential marriage license that included a wedding date of Dec. 20, 2022, and location of Palo Alto, Calif.\n\nAfter saying “I do,” the couple traveled to Utah, where they enjoyed a relaxing honeymoon at the celeb-loved Amangiri resort.\n\nHowever, the newlyweds decision to get hitched reportedly didn’t sit right with Kardashian, who sources said “hates” Censori.\n\nInsiders told Page Six that it was well known around Yeezy HQ that Kardashian was not a fan of the architectural designer, whom she long suspected had a crush on West.\n\nYet it wasn’t just Kim who was “confused” by the nuptials: We were told that the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan was concerned about the new arrangement and how it would impact their kids’ lives.\n\n“They aren’t sure if it is a PR stunt,” a source told us at the time. “They are waiting to see if he files [legal marriage] papers. They are nervous because if it’s real, she would be in the children’s life.”\n\nThe exes share four children: North, Chicago, Psalm and Saint.\n\nEnd of January 2023: Meeting the family\n\nDespite Kardashian’s skepticism, Censori quickly immersed herself into the role of stepmom and was spotted out to dinner with the former couple’s eldest daughter, North, toward the end of January 2023.\n\nAt the time, the Daily Mail obtained photos of Kanye and Censori waiting for North to arrive at Nobu in Malibu, Calif.\n\nA security team was then seen dropping off North and one of her friends at the Japanese restaurant before they all headed inside.\n\nIn the following months, North was spotted spending time with West and Censori at Universal Studios Hollywood and even attending church with the duo.\n\nEarly June 2023: Settling in to home life\n\nCensori and North continued to put their growing bond on display at West’s 46th birthday bash in early June 2023.\n\nThe duo were photographed walking hand in hand into the soirée, where they were spotted hanging around each other all night.\n\nThe pair seemed to be getting along swimmingly inside the party after meeting up with West.\n\nAround the same time, insiders told the US Sun that the couple had settled into a $20,000-a-month apartment in West Hollywood, Calif.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom apartment reportedly included amenities such as a heated pool, rooftop cafe, private cinema, valet, a bar and lounge area and 24-hour concierge service.\n\nMid-June 2023: Doing ‘amazing’\n\nAfter the headline-making couple hit their six-month marriage mark, sources told Us Weekly that they were “doing amazing.”\n\n“Things couldn’t be better for Kanye and Bianca,” an insider shared with the magazine in June 2023. “Kanye feels like he finally met someone who truly gets him and loves him for the person he is.\n\n“Bianca complements Kanye on so many levels, and he loves that they can work and collaborate together on projects,” they added. “He appreciates and respects her opinions, even if they don’t always agree. She really keeps him grounded, and he’s feeling better than ever.”\n\nEnd of June/early July 2023: Tokyo trip\n\nCensori and West took their romance overseas for a fun-filled trip to Japan at the end of June 2023.\n\nThe disgraced “Jesus Walks” rapper and his onetime staffer were photographed exploring Tokyo — and eyeing some souvenirs to commemorate the trip.\n\nAt one point, the pair were seen perusing sex toy options while walking through the Don Quijote discount store, according to TMZ.\n\nDuring the trip, the couple also seemingly spent time with the architect’s parents, who arrived in Tokyo in July 2023.\n\nWhile there was no photo evidence of the hangout, Censori’s sister posted photos of the family exploring the city.\n\n“I ❤️ toookkyyooo,” she captioned the Instagram post, which featured a snap of her gripping Censori’s hand and another of her parents walking ahead of them. However, none of the pictures included West.\n\nAugust 2023: Italian vacation\n\nFollowing their trip to Asia, the couple headed to Europe for an Italian getaway.\n\nWhile traveling the country in August 2023, the couple put their love on full display while getting hot and heavy on numerous different occasions.\n\nWhile in Florence, West and Censori — who left little to the imagination in a completely see-through, thong bodysuit with sheer tights — were caught sharing a passionate kiss in the street.\n\nLess than a week later, the Grammy winner couldn’t keep his hands off of his partner’s backside as they waited outside a Travis Scott concert, where West made a surprise appearance.\n\nThey also looked every bit in love in a video shared to Instagram showing the couple singing and dancing with a group of friends during a private dinner.\n\nTheir getaway continued through the end of the month when the rapper was caught with his pants down while on a boat in Venice with his lover.\n\nNovember 2023: Intervention\n\nCensori’s friends reportedly staged an intervention in November 2023 to urge her to “wake the f–k up” after she went home to Australia.\n\n“She knows that she has shut out those close to her, and she is also starting to see through the smoky mirrors of her marriage,” a source told the Daily Mail."
