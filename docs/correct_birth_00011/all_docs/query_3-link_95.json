        "text": "North West’s personality is mind-oriented. They understand and relate to the world around them via the medium of thought and intellect. Memorization, comparison, analysis, and the verbalization of their mental imagery are their favorite activities. They seek to extend their personality by a mental outreach to a multitude of new ideas and factors, becoming acquainted with an ever-increasing variety of facets of human nature. Thus, language and symbolic expression, written or oral, are their primary resources in life, although they are also potential pitfalls. Their eloquence, wit, and verve, their mastery of language, unquestionably give their power over other people (via communication) and things (science and technique). But taken to extremes, this faculty may lead to incoherency.\n\nIt is thus vital for them to find an outlet for their flow of verbal expression, they must explain, communicate, and speak. If it is dammed up, they will undoubtedly suffer. Their flow of words is the expression of their vital energy, the proof that they are alive and well. If they are forced to be silent, they would be cut off from the bonds that hold them together. A kind of duality or split personality might emerge… remember Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? “They” were a classic case. For all of the above reasons, they are naturally gregarious and sociable.\n\nThey make friends quickly and easily. Their contacts and networks are important to them, because they enable them to evolve. They are a source of self-fulfillment and identification. Any form of play is also important to them, and only severe depression will deprive them of their playfulness. They sometimes amuse themselves by acting out a variety of roles on the stage of life, just for the fun of it. Their animation and wit give them a talent for improvisation and adaptation. However, adaptability is a two-bladed sword. They are liable to find themselves in a superficial bind, having jettisoned certain important ideas in order to move about more freely. They are also sensitive, but their emotions and feelings are sometimes subject to the scrutiny and censorship of their intellect. Thus, they cannot free themselves to the strength of great passions and energies without idealizing them to a certain degree and giving them intellectual resonance. Wary of their irrational instincts and urges, they tend to control or repress them.\n\nBut they will do well to learn that the intellect is not omnipotent, especially where instinct is concerned. Inhabiting a complex inner world, they sometimes feel vulnerable, due to their emotionalism and sensitivity to the aggressions of the outer world. Because they rely first and foremost on their adaptability and agility to wriggle out of trouble, they may, on certain occasions, make rather dubious compromises with themselves – all the more likely if their moral fiber is made of wax, as is often the case, instead of steel. The weaknesses they must overcome are instability, wishy-washiness, a lack of determination and coherence in their thought.\n\nNorth West needs movement. North West is a talented communicator.\n\nThe ego which is available to others is no longer completely self-possessed. North West invests all their energy in their relationships and partnerships.\n\nAt the time of your birth, my rising sign was located in Sagittarius (the Archer), while the sun was passing through the sign of Gemini (the Twins). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide my personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of my character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nImpetuosity – Need for contact – Enthusiasm – Mental agitation – Group spirit – Frivolity – Impressionability – Dilettantism – Analytical mind – Worldly concerns – Communication – Projection – Inner duality.\n\nAn accurate sense of observation, keen intuition, an ability to analyze and recompose, and a far-reaching vision which integrates universal concerns: these are my chief mental qualities. However, these talents are part of a dissociated temperament, a personality whose duality gives it a multitude of facets. As a result, I display unpredictable behavior which alternates between contradictory attitudes.\n\nSerious at times and lighthearted at others, my enterprise and determination will yield without warning to a giddy nonchalance. My responsible, group-oriented nature will suddenly be overshadowed by signs of mental if not physical escape and absence.\n\nI must become aware of my opposing traits in order to achieve the stability necessary to take full advantage of my many qualities.\n\nBy consciously rewarding one or the other of the tendencies I have recognized in myself, I will find inner peace. My environment will become less influential and upsetting; my efforts will be available for application to a specific goal, which will be all the more rewarding because I have chosen it with new awareness.\n\nBorn three and a half to seven days after the rising of the new moon, North West is said to be a “crescent moon” lunar type. This “soli-lunar” configuration indicates that North West may need to make an effort to free themselves from the past. Something related to their childhood, parents, or ancestors is holding them back, impairing their effectiveness and could stand to be overcome.\n\nDue to their past, North West refuses tried-and-true models, is always fighting to justify their innovative viewpoints, and tends to break away from tradition. North West is hardly ever aware that they are making career and lifestyle choices which are based on an urge to modify their relationship to society, and the rigid standards and models from the past."
