        "text": "Ever since Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West's new baby daughter was delivered via surrogate, everyone has been dying to know her name. And no, she was not named after a famed fashion house as some theories postulated. What ingeniousness, we wondered, could possibly follow North West and Saint West? Well, Friday we got the answer, via a post on Kim Kardashian's app. Drumroll, please. The third child of Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West, born January 15, 2018 at 12:47 a.m., weighing 7 pounds and 6 ounces, is named...\n\n...Chicago West.\n\nOf course, the meaning behind the name is easy to discern. Kanye was raised in Chicago and often reps his city, most specifically in his song \"Homecoming\":\n\nEvery interview I'm representin' you, makin' you proud / Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud / Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around / And if you don't know by now, I'm talkin' about Chi Town\n\nCongrats to the happy parents to naming their third child. We can't wait to eventually see photos of Chicago playing with siblings North and Saint.\n\nRelated: Kim Kardashian Posted a Pic of Designer Trash Cans and Wow, Who Took This Photo of Me\n\nCheck this out:\n\nCulture\n\nIn Dance Music, Black Women Are the Constant Tastemakers\n\n“In 2024, we shouldn't be having any ‘Oh, first Black female to headline something.’”\n\nCulture\n\nIntroducing MOMENT by Teen Vogue, a Living Pop Culture Yearbook\n\nOur MOMENT launch cover star is Grammy-nominated rapper Coi Leray.\n\nIdentity\n\nWhat It’s Like to Lobby for Abortion Rights From a Red State\n\n\"Whether you like it or not, you represent us.”"
