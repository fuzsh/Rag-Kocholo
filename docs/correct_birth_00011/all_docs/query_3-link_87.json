        "text": "Kim Kardashian West has just announced the birth of her third child with her husband Kanye West.\n\nThe rapper and beauty mogul are said to have welcomed their baby girl into the world yesterday.\n\nShe arrived safely via surrogate and weighed a healthy 7lb 6oz.\n\nIn a statement released on Kardashian's official website, the star expressed gratitude and happiness:\n\nKanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl. We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care. North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister.\n\nThe 37 year-old mother-of-three experienced difficult pregnancies with Saint and North as a result of preeclampsia - a condition characterised by the onset of high blood pressure. She was reportedly warned not to carry a third child so took the decision to use a surrogate.\n\nIn a recent episode of her hit reality show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the star said of the third pregnancy: 'It is frustrating like to not be able to do it on your own.\n\n'It is a weird dynamic. Like I go to all the doctor's appointments and I try to be really present, but when you're not carrying it yourself it is such a fine balance of how much you're going to be in their lives.\n\nKardashian West ensured the privacy of her surrogate, who was unaware she'd be carrying the famous offspring at first, making sure she has not been named or bothered.\n\nOf course, keeping things quiet regarding pregnancy somewhat runs in the famous family.\n\nKim's younger sister Khlo√© only recently announced she was six months pregnant with her first child, while many people continue to speculate regarding the clain's youngest child, Kylie, who is rumoured to also be with child.\n\nWe can't wait to see the new Kardashian West child. Congratulations, Kim and Kanye!"
