After his parents' divorce, Kanye moved to Chicago with his mother, who played a significant role in nurturing his creative talents. Donda's support and encouragement were instrumental in Kanye's development as an artist.

Kanye showed an early interest in the arts, particularly in music and visual arts. He began rapping in the third grade and producing music in his teens. Influenced by artists like Michael Jackson, Public Enemy, and A Tribe Called Quest, Kanye developed a unique sound that blended soulful samples with contemporary beats. He attended the American Academy of Art and Chicago State University but dropped out to pursue a career in music, a decision that would later inspire his debut album title, "The College Dropout."

Rise to Fame as a Producer and Rapper

Kanye West's initial foray into the music industry was as a producer. He gained recognition for his work on Jay-Z's critically acclaimed album "The Blueprint" (2001), where his distinctive use of soul samples set him apart. His production credits on tracks like "Izzo (H.O.V.A.)" and "Takeover" showcased his innovative approach and cemented his reputation as a top-tier producer.

Despite his success behind the scenes, Kanye aspired to be a rapper. He faced skepticism from record labels who doubted his potential as a solo artist. However, his persistence paid off when he signed with Roc-A-Fella Records. In 2004, he released his debut album, "The College Dropout," which was both a commercial and critical triumph. The album featured hits like "Through the Wire," "Jesus Walks," and "All Falls Down," and earned Kanye multiple Grammy Awards.
