        "text": "Yeah, some of those problems come from literal translation issues (I've seen the same with anime - translating things literally, vs translating the 'spirit' of it: the hidden meanings that a native speaker would get from regional accent, slang, etc)\n\nSome of them just seem like the OP's personal issues, or being deliberately obtuse to 'gaming jargon', not translation ones.\n\nLike \"Alliance points\". This isn't a language or translation issue. It has nothing to do with NATO, or the US, or whatever. The PvP in this game is between the three Alliances. Thus, the points you earn in PvP are Alliance Points.\n\nOr maybe as a long-time gamer (both digital & tabletop), I'm just used to the idea of using all sorts of different \"points\" as currencies. /shrug\n\nI've played games where you earn experience points, then spend them to increase your skills; etc. I can't imagine that other languages where gaming happens, don't have their equivalents of that jargon. Now, if ESO didn't translate English gaming jargon into the appropriate jargon in other languages, then that would be a translation issue. But not because such concepts just don't exist.\n\nDitto for the many things that seem to be totally normal due to my familiarity with Fantasy, Folklore, Mythology, etc. Like this:\n\n21. Scaled Court, Court of Bedlam, Feathered Court - what court is meant here? A court of judges, a royal court, a tennis court? Anyway, I couldn't find any of suitable meanings.\n\nI've run into too many stories over the years with things like the Fae Courts (Court of Summer, Seelie Court, etc) to be thrown by those. And that's like ancient mythology from Europe, not some newfangled thing.\n\nEh, whatever.\n\n(are there really languages out there, where people in the past didn't create place names out of whatever words they felt like shoving together?)\n\n----\n\nActually, looking at it more, Metaphor seems to be a major issue. Like with \"Hands\" or \"Blades\". The main helper being the \"the Right Hand of the King\", or \"You are my Blades! Go out and kill in my name!\" The ruler gives orders and his Hands (for various tasks) and his Blades (for more stabby-killy tasks) carry out those orders. I desire something done and my hands carry out the job, whether it is literal (I open a door with my actual hand) or metaphorical (my minion goes and does what I require)\n\nEven in the respective lorebooks are treating these stories with caution.\n\nOdiva Gallwood in A History of Daggerfall writes:\n\n\"Daggerfall, by tradition, is said to refer to the knife the first chieftain threw to form the borders of his lands. But there are other legends that may have equal validity.\" (Emphasis mine)\n\nAnd she calls the attempts at explaining the name a \"not actually helpful amusement\".\n\nThat's not an explanation, that's just ingame speculation and storytelling. In fact, it's quite obvious how someone would come up with a story like that after they heard the name \"Daggerfall\" and wondered where it came from, and wanted to get an entertaining tale out of it.\n\nThe same with Hammerfell and Volenfell. Volenfell is translated from the Dwemeris as \"City of the Hammer\" by the Pocket Guide, so it has absolutely nothing to do with the English word \"to fall\". And Hammerfell was named such by the Redguards who didn't really care that much about Dwarven legends - after all, the Dwemer had disappeared a century before the Redguards ever came there. We can probably assume that it's a case like Edinborough - one part of the name translated, the other not, making both Volenfell and Hammerfell identical in meaning.\n\nAnd generally speaking, it's always a good idea to keep in mind that TES ingame sources are either intentionally biased, wrong, or unreliable, or can be declared such at any moment by other sources. If it's written in an ingame book or told by an ingame NPC, it's not automatically \"true\".\n\nIn French version of The Elder Scrolls, it's a bit special, because like Middle Earth's writings and films, there are different traductors who worked on it at different times, with different artistic choices.\n\nThis way, each \"tamrielic\" English name in the lore has often TWO french translations. One for the Arena-Oblivion time, one from ESO.\n\nI'll take some examples.\n\n- Summerset Isles: untranslatable because it's a pun with Summer and Sunset... So the old name was Archipel de l'Automne (Autumns Archipelago) and in ESO it became Archipel du Couchant (Archipelago of the West , or Sunset Archipelago)\n\nThis new translation is way better, because it removes the \"dying\" feel of Automne and the wrong season theme regarding in-game flora of said Isles. It also revives the geographical sense, Le Couchant is the \"tamrielic\" French name for Summerset, just like IRL it is our peotic name for Morocco, in opposition with Le Levant (Lebanon and Syria). It makes even more sense when we notice how Summerset have the a similar vibe like Canary islands.\n\n- Cloudrest : Havrebrume (old, Hazehaven) / Pas-des-Nuées (modern, Swarmstep or Cloudpace)\n\n- Anvil : Anvil (old, untranslated) / Lenclume (modern, Theanvil)\n\n- Wayrest : Refuge (old, Shelter) / Haltevoie (modern, Wayhalt)\n\nSome places are still untranslated in ESO.\n\n- Rimmen (men from the rim) is meaningless in french (it could have been Frontaliers in french)\n\n- Morrowind (wind of tomorrow?) sound very english like an american blockbuster title (it may have been Vendemain or Vantdemain with a pun between vent and lendemain).\n\n- Ald'Ruhn : we don't understand the hidden meaning \"ald/old\", because it should have been vieil/vieux.\n\nSome places are translated only in the french version of the lore but not as commercial name.\n\nFor us, Skyrim is the game name, Bordeciel is the lore area.\n\nOblivion is used untranslated but the latin root makes it looking like an original french word (we don't get the meaning, \"Oubli\", forgotting)\n\nThe harder fun fact about all this, is that sometimes we have SEVERAL concurrent translations INSIDE one game like ESO. Maybe because two persons worked on it I guess.\n\nStill not fixed currently, I can testify (as an altmer lore stan account )\n\n- Sunhold : Solanie (Sunlany) et Soltenure (Suntenure) !\n\n- - Sol is a cut part from \"Soleil\", but it's not ideal because it's the word for ground, soil.\n\n- - Soltenure looks less poetic to me but is well consistent with other city of Prime-Tenure (modern french version of Firsthold - that old version was Primeterre (Firstland))\n\n- Sil-Var-Woad : big mess here, since Schick reverse-engineered and retconned the older TES:A name of \"Silverwood\" into this. Two french translators for ESO:Summerset tried. It gave Boss-Khar-Jhen, Boss-Kar-Jhen et Bosq d'Âr-jen (and l’aube some more as I find new iterations in treasures names...)\n\n- - they are two phonetic mimicking of \"Bosc d'argent\" (old french for \"Bois d'argent\", Silver Wood).\n\n- - Sh!t would happen if one day they decide to give Aldmeri translation for Sil, Var and Woad like they did for Thor Hame Khard (former Thorheim Guard).\n\n2. Almalexia's Hands (also Her Hands). So where are Her Fingers, Her Nails, Her.. Eyebrows or.. (sorry-sorry) Her Arse ? Why couldn't they have been called simply \"Almalexia's Guard\"? There are two words for the \"hand\" in my language - a casual and poetic one meaning the \"hand\". So, I have to use that poetic one, but nonetheless, we don't use that word to name someone's personal henchmen.\n\nMain d'Almalexia directly from english like you said. We understand the meaning (at least I was able to, because it mimicked the Hand of the Emperor title in old Star Wars expanded lore )\n\nIn proper french it could have been \"Bras droit d'Almalexia\" because we use the right arm metaphor for the english \"hand\" lackey. But I guess it's fine. Also The Eye of the Queen are Les Yeux de la Reine, literally.\n\n3. Redguard. Yeah, it's a misspelling of the \"Ra Gada\" (a good name, by the way). But why the \"Redguard\"? It reminds me of that Chinese military all the time I hear or read that word.\n\nSpeculation: maybe the first creators imagined them as a former mercenary army (like the tsaesci blades became in modern lore) from remote continent that would be called, Red Guard. In fact they do have red tapestries and red themed stuff.\n\nAfterwards, I remember a dev (MK?) said they were developped as a kind of reverse-from-real-world Black Power conquerors of Tamriel, so Red Guard could be a private joke around the maoist vibe of the Black Panther party?\n\n6. Hammerfell.\n\n=> Martelfell in ESO (Hammerfell previously)\n\nVvardenfell => untranslated to this day. Nonsense word in french. I only realised it was \"Warden Fell\" in english when the Chapter was released with the Warden class\n\n14. Gold - you say \"X gold\" meaning X amount of gold. We can't say that in my language. Well, video game players do say it, but otherwise it's a weird phrase.\n\nFrench gaming and roleplaying slang uses \"PO\" : letters P and O for pièces d'or, gold coins.\n\n15. Ald Daedroth,\n\nWe don't have the TH sound so it's \"alde dahédrote\"\n\n21. Blades\n\nLes Lames. (literally)\n\nWe call this \"métonymie\" when a person or something is named after a feature or a stuff it has.\n\nCourt of Bedlam\n\nLa Cour du Saccage (like a king's court, yes, but pledging to the havoc itself instead of a monarch)\n\n23. Walker, Shadow Walker - the word \"walker\" is untranslatable to my language. The closest one resembles with the \"pedestrian\".\n\n'Marcheur\" (it exists!)\n\n24. Sword-singers\n\nLes Chante-épée (literally)\n\nAccording to the rules of my language, complex words make stress on the \"main\" word within it. Those guys might not have that rule in theirs. But how does that work, say, in French? Is it still \"Dunmer\" there?\n\nWe have no such accent nor \"main word\" problems so it is merely \"dunmer\" ... flat \"dunmer\".\n\nI guess that for a foreigner our accent thing is always perceived on the last syllabe for every phrase.\n\nAnd the common spelling is \"deux + n'mère\" to badly mimic the regular english \"HUH\" sound for their U letter. I even don't know if proper spelling should be \"dounemère\" with a OU like in \"you\"...!\n\nTESO:Triskelion - forum RP, guilde francophone\n\nAjaxandriel - haut-elfe gardien 50 ;\n\nAltarya - haute-elfe templière 50 ;\n\nAngelith - elfe des bois gardienne 50 ;\n\nAntarius Scorpio - impérial chevalier-dragon 50 ;\n\nArtémidore de Corbeaulieu - bréton lame noire 50 ;\n\nAzothos Sadras - elfe noir sorcier 50 ;\n\nCelestras - haut-elfe sorcier 50 ;\n\nDiluviatar - elfe des mers sorcier 50 ;\n\nDorguldun gro-Arash - orque sorcier 50 ;\n\nHjarnar - nordique sorcier 50 ;\n\nJendaya al-Gilane - rougegarde chevalier-dragon 50 ;\n\nSabbathnazar Ullikummi - elfe noir chevalier-dragon 50 ;\n\nSelvaryn Virotès - elfe noire lame noire 50 ;\n\nTahajmi - khajiit sorcière 50 ;\n\nTelernil - haut-elfe templier 50 ;\n\nZadzadak - gobelin nécromancien 50 ;\n\nZandoga - rougegarde chevalier-dragon 50\n\nBuoyant Armigers\n\nThere's that Lore Book about the \"founding\" of these guys: \"The 36 Lessons of Vivec: Sermon24\n\n\"When they saw their lord, the Velothi cheered. \"We are happy to serve you and win!\" they said.\n\nVivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order.\n\n\"You shall forever be now my Buoyant Armigers,\" he said.\"\n\nSo \"Buoyant\" here definitely represents the meaning of \"mirthful, cheerful, spirited, lively\", not the meaning of \"floating, unsinkable\" (or, only insofar as their good spirits are \"unsinkable\" by adversity).\n\nWhen someone mentioned \"gay\" that was correct. Because up to the late 19th century that word just meant \"carefree, cheerful, (for persons and occasions), bright and showy (for displays/things/looks). The mainly sexual connotation came after that.\n\nAnd reading that thing about \"displays of love and duty\" and \"crown of mating bones\", well, maybe both meanings are fitting here.\n\nAnd \"armigers\" is a medieval thing, describing persons, families, or clans that are entitled to use a heraldic representation (a \"Coat of Arms\" = heraldic emblem = Wappen [in German]). The correct phrasing for having and using such a heraldic emblem is \"bear a code of arms\" (not literally carrying it around, although knights having it on their shields was probably the basis for the wording). That explains the \"Wappenträger\". Only people of a certain social standing were allowed to do so, and this right was usually granted at some point by a higher authority, or passed on hereditary.\n\nSo Vivec kind of ennobled these people by making them Armigers with his (divine) authority.\n\nYou could try to translate this as \"Knecht\" in German. But that would hold the risk of backfiring spectacularly. Because yes, at some point when it was still a Germanic word it meant something like \"fighter for their lord\". But later its meaning in Germany and other countries changed to a lowly worker/servant, with very few rights and no authority, either at a farm, or in a household. And that would be a completely wrong association.\n\nSo for Armigers, I'd go with \"Streiter\" or \"Kämpen\" (both formal, a bit old-fashioned, but also poetic words for \"fighter\") or even \"Ritter\" (=knight, which is technically/historically one step above the \"Armiger\", but since this is a religious order they probably wield a similar social weight).\n\nThen we have the Lore Book Buoyant Armigers: Swords of Vivec.\n\nIt explicitly talks of \"Knights-Errant\", so I'd go with \"Ritter\" (knight) for this part.\n\nBuoyant is much more of a challenge, because while there are many adjectives that fit the bill in some way or other, you'd need to find one that is poetic, describing good spirit, while not sounding too harmless or cumbersome.\n\nYou could go with \"Strahlende Ritter\". That would indicate a bit of humour from Vivec's side, because in German that's the equivalent of the slightly romantically exaggerated \"Knight in Shining Armour\". A bit old-fashioned, implying an ideal more than a reality. So in essence, it would fit the bill, because the BAs are described as exactly that kind of idealized knightly image (valour, combat prowess, chivalric courtesy, and warrior-poetry). It is kind of a standing phrase in language and literature, though.\n\nBut young folks - and folks with that other sort of humour - would probably make jokes about Vivec's Knights being irradiated or glowing in the dark (because strahlend can also mean those things).\n\nSo a safe, working, albeit a bit lame, translation could be \"Vivecs Ritter\" (Knights of Vivec) oder \"Vivecs Fahrende Ritter\" (Vivec's Knights Errant).\n\nI'll stop at this, because I should have been asleep for two hours already. Thank you for an interesting topic!\n\nAnd to answer one of your general questions: I'm German, so English isn't my native language. But after about 20 to 25 years of using it regularly as a 2nd language, first at school, then when consuming books (both for university studies and amusement), films or TV stuff from US/Britain I do \"think\" (or better: associate emotionally) directly in English when hearing it. That's why I bought the English version of ESO, because so many of the German translations just don't work, and I know it when I see/hear them, because they sound \"wrong\" in German, but I \"hear\" what the English original behind them was, and that one makes sense. Especially with fantasy and legend you always have to translate by meaning/emotional association, not literally - and that is very, very hard to achieve.\n\nThat's why the translation of Margaret Carroux for The Lord of the Rings in German, for example, works like a charm, transporting the wonderful epic of Tolkien, and the new one by what's-his-name Krege is an utter disaster. Because he just doesn't have (or use) the background in historic linguistics, folk lore, and various mythological and cultural backgrounds that you need to find the right words to represent the concepts behind the original ones.\n\nHoly Moses, that was awesome, @Ajaxandriel! Very insightful. Thank you!\n\nWe have no such accent nor \"main word\" problems so it is merely \"dunmer\" ... flat \"dunmer\".\n\nI guess that for a foreigner our accent thing is always perceived on the last syllabe for every phrase.\n\nAnd the common spelling is \"deux + n'mère\" to badly mimic the regular english \"HUH\" sound for their U letter. I even don't know if proper spelling should be \"dounemère\" with a OU like in \"you\"...!\n\nI'm an ordinary European man, but I was born in the territory of Asia and lived there for the first 16 years of my life. That was a good long time ago, indeed. A Frenchman taught me the basics of archery, we discussed the philosophy of life and sang songs of the 70s with an Italian, I had several friends from America, a Brazillian was my classmate and a friend that time (I did not spoke his Portuguese at all, but I spoke English and my native language only - he couldn't say a word using neither of them, so we always had plenty of things to discuss . A very good man, I still remember our conversations). I had plenty of things to observe and it's hard to surprise me with some lingual things including those Chinese, Japanese, Thai and some other languages. But what is totally surprising for me is that the \"last syllable\" rule is not a rule at all in French ! How could that ever be true ?! That's a revelation. Aren't you some kind of a \"wrong\" Frenchman, Ajax ? What French is that - a Belgian or.. a Canadian?\n\nIn French version of The Elder Scrolls, it's a bit special, because like Middle Earth's writings and films, there are different traductors who worked on it at different times, with different artistic choices.\n\nThis way, each \"tamrielic\" English name in the lore has often TWO french translations. One for the Arena-Oblivion time, one from ESO.\n\nWe had something similar back in the 90's when we got acquianted with the game. I remember those talks on the \"Daedra\" (each letter pronounced as a separate one - d-a-e-d-ra) or something like \"Day-drah\"). Later on we agreed to use the first way of pronunciation.\n\n- Summerset Isles: untranslatable because it's a pun with Summer and Sunset... So the old name was Archipel de l'Automne (Autumns Archipelago) and in ESO it became Archipel du Couchant (Archipelago of the West , or Sunset Archipelago)\n\nThis new translation is way better, because it removes the \"dying\" feel of Automne and the wrong season theme regarding in-game flora of said Isles. It also revives the geographical sense, Le Couchant is the \"tamrielic\" French name for Summerset, just like IRL it is our peotic name for Morocco, in opposition with Le Levant (Lebanon and Syria). It makes even more sense when we notice how Summerset have the a similar vibe like Canary islands.\n\nSome places are translated only in the french version of the lore but not as commercial name.\n\nFor us, Skyrim is the game name, Bordeciel is the lore area.\n\nOblivion is used untranslated but the latin root makes it looking like an original french word (we don't get the meaning, \"Oubli\", forgotting)\n\nWow. Two different translations for the \"Skyrim\" ? \"Bordeciel\".. Interesting. Both Summerset and Skyrim are left untranslated in my language. But regarding the \"Oblivion\" - this is something I can't agree with my fellow players. Yes, generally we do not translate the \"Oblivion\" too, be it a TES game name or that in-game realm. And basically, just like in your language, people think it means the \"forgetting\" or something. What I think, is that this word should be translated, but not in the sense of \"forgetting\". We have a very beautiful word for the place of \"nonbeing\", \"netherrealm\", \"inexistence\", \"abhava\" (well, that's an Indian word, actually, not the one from my language), \"nonentity\". And that word means exactly the place opposite to the place of existence, life, being, the Mundus. I don't know what meaning of the \"Oblivion\" was meant originally, but I doubt it meant something derived from the \"forget\" word.\n\nMain d'Almalexia directly from english like you said. We understand the meaning (at least I was able to, because it mimicked the Hand of the Emperor title in old Star Wars expanded lore )\n\nIn proper french it could have been \"Bras droit d'Almalexia\" because we use the right arm metaphor for the english \"hand\" lackey. But I guess it's fine. Also The Eye of the Queen are Les Yeux de la Reine, literally.\n\nThe Hand of the Emperor ! It is always a pleasure to meet another real Star Wars fan. We use the right arm metaphor that way too! But in order to do it you always have to say \"right arm of\" someone, and refer to someone specific. So, we can't say that the Hands of Almalexia are her right arms, because there are.. 10 (if I'm not mistaken) of them in TES III and even many more today. The word \"eye\", just like the \"hand\" has both literal, modern, casual meaning, and a poetic one. But then again, we can't use that word when we name those people officially - in my language it is a metaphorical word just like that \"hand\" example and should be used to officialy name the agents of the Altmeri state.\n\nMartelfell in ESO (Hammerfell previously)\n\nVvardenfell => untranslated to this day. Nonsense word in french. I only realised it was \"Warden Fell\" in english when the Chapter was released with the Warden class\n\nThat word reminded me of your Charles Martel who saved Europe from the Arabs in the 732nd, if I'm not wrong on that. And of your cognac . Though it's spelled with a double \"L\", of course. Thank you for your post, @Ajaxandriel! That was very insightful. Awesome!\n\nSome thoughts about some of the words you listed:\n\nBuoyant Armiger: When I played TES3 Morrowind for the first time, I was 15 years old, I think. I played it in English and I had no clue what \"Buoyant Armiger\" actually means. I mean, I saw what they did, but the exact meaning of their name... My dictionary gave \"cheery, vivid\" as one possible translation for \"buoyant\". Together with \"armiger\", I could imagine it means something like \"guards who serve mostly a representative function, who show off especially splendid uniforms and weapons and somehow serve as a status symbol for their ruler\". So, I don't think \"Kriegswappenträger\" is that wrong. Sometimes I've seen \"Wappen\" used not only for the coat of arms itself, but also for, for example, clothing or shields bearing it.\n\nAlmalexia's Hands: Metaphorically, they are her hands. They are the ones who carry out her orders while she stays in her temple. I mean, what body part do you use when you do things? Your feet? Your ass? I normally use my hands\n\nDaggerfall: It's \"Dolchsturz\" in the German translation. I'm not sure about it, but it seems to me that the city's name is based on a founding myth? That also happens in reality.\n\nMorrowind: I once read that \"Morrowind\" is probably just the translation of \"Resdayn\". I'm not sure for \"res\", but \"dayn\" seems to be Dunmeri for \"dawn\" or \"morning\". If I find the source again, I'll post it here.\n\nWayrest: There are two different translations in German. \"Wegesruh\" in ESO, \"Wegrast\" in Oblivion.\n\nWhiterun: Run = Lauf = Flusslauf. You also have that in German. So, it's a town next to the White River.\n\nSolitude: You never heard of this? https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Solitude\n\nIt was common to name places after moods. You also have this castle in Germany: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanssouci\n\n(from French \"sans soucis\" = without sorrow)\n\nBlades, Nightblade: pars pro toto. It is not uncommon in German to call soldiers of someone \"blades\" = Klingen. \"Die Klingen des Königs\", or \"Soldklingen\" (literally \"blades for money\" = merchenaries).\n\nMore later Btw, what are your favorite poems by Robert Frost? I've been wondering all the time now.\n\n@Syldras | PC | EU\n\nThe forceful expression of will gives true honor to the Ancestors.\n\nSarayn Andrethi, Telvanni mage (Main)\n\nDarvasa Andrethi, his \"I'm NOT a Necromancer!\" sister\n\nMalacar Sunavarlas, Altmer Ayleid vampire\n\nSo, back again\n\nGold: In the German translation, it's also just \"Gold\" (except for, Oblivion I think, where they employed a wrong plural form saying \"Golds\" ). Like \"5 Gold\", although \"Goldmünzen\" = \"gold coins\" would be more correct. But, if you use it as a currency name, it would be okay. You also say \"5 Euro\" or \"5 Dollar\" after all. Also, sometimes commons phrases are shortened. You can order \"5 Flaschen Bier\" by telling the waiter \"5 Bier\" (even in the singular form).\n\nDaedric ruin and Ashlander names: Sumerian, Assyrian and other Mesopotamic languages. There was a Assyrian King with the name Aššur-bāni-apli (sometimes shortened to Assurbanipal...). His son was Aššur-aḫḫe-iddinas. In ancient Sumeria, there were places like the temple of Eninnu, Zabalam, or Tel Agreb and Tel Asma (Tel meaning \"hill\"), you have people's names like Kudur-Mabuk, Nammu, Asarualimnunna or Ningirsu. Do they remind you of something, sera?\n\nGenerally, I actually like that the names of places are translated in the TES games. It's not always done perfectly, but I think it's better if you get the meaning instead of having English names for everything. This perspective might stem from the fact, though, that here in Germany we are totally used to get everything translated to German. There are normally no movies with original sound and just German subtitles on TV. Same goes for pc games. And many people don't ever read books in their original language.\n\nAnother thing I just thought of... The city of Kvatch. It sounds like the German word Quatsch, which means \"nonsense\"\n\nVivec's warriors were called Buoyant Armigers becase they're gay samurai, as described by one of the devs that created them.\n\nWhy Samurai? I know Morrowind has a very strong feudal Asia feel (to me, mostly Japanese, with Chinese mixed in), but Samurai as a warrior caste (and many of them with aristocratic background) rather remind me of Great House Redoran. Vivec somehow has more of an Indian vibe. I mean, the way he looks and his concept as a hermaphrodite God is even designed after Ardhanarishvara:\n\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/medusatombstone/art/Ardhanarishvara-377860408\n\n@Syldras | PC | EU\n\nThe forceful expression of will gives true honor to the Ancestors.\n\nSarayn Andrethi, Telvanni mage (Main)\n\nDarvasa Andrethi, his \"I'm NOT a Necromancer!\" sister\n\nMalacar Sunavarlas, Altmer Ayleid vampire\n\nBut what is totally surprising for me is that the \"last syllable\" rule is not a rule at all in French ! How could that ever be true ?! That's a revelation. Aren't you some kind of a \"wrong\" Frenchman, Ajax ? What French is that - a Belgian or.. a Canadian?\n\nHahaha but let me return you the question, wasn't this Frenchman a \"wrong\" one? ;D\n\nI am both from north and south of France (regarding parents) so I can tell there are huge differences of \"accent\" between regions, city or countryside, and of course with Belgium, Swiss and of course Québec...\n\nbut these differences only concern spelling of letters (in the south, southwest one pronounces more the \"e\", and also, \"an, in, on\" they are spoken \"ãŋ, \"ɛ̃ŋ\", \"õŋ\" instead of \"ã, \"ɛ̃\", \"õ\" ...and some other unexplainable details).\n\nBut here - what I am sure is that we have no \"accent tonique\" like germanic or other romance languages, we never talk of this until we learn english or spanish at middle school. It feels very artificial to \"play up\" some syllabes ... like the rest of the world do (That's why it's so hard to speak english properly, more than just wright it for us.)\n\nAnd even later we learn that accent stuff about ourselves, like, yes, we do accentuate the late syllab of a phrase, or of a significant part of a phrase (checked, here https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_tonique#Le_cas_du_français )\n\nAlso it's said that nowadays more and more people do use a tonic accent like other languages, in the slang accent from the african / french-arab quarters of big cities.\n\nWow. Two different translations for the \"Skyrim\" ? \"Bordeciel\"..\n\nIn game and in roleplay we say Bordeciel like a place in the fictional world, but when we say Skyrim we refer to the game software, its gameplay, all this. But everybody understand it refers to the same fictional place in the english version of the lore X)\n\nI don't know what meaning of the \"Oblivion\" was meant originally, but I doubt it meant something derived from the \"forget\" word.\n\nIt does! from latin oblivio ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivion )\n\nBut in order to do it you always have to say \"right arm of\" someone, and refer to someone specific. So, we can't say that the Hands of Almalexia are her right arms, because there are.. 10 (if I'm not mistaken) of them in TES III and even many more today.\n\nYou're right, there should be one and only one Bras droit / Right Arm of Almalexia for this to work haha\n\nMartelfell\n\nThat word reminded me of your Charles Martel\n\nLe martel is an old french word that became le marteau (spoken \"marto\") currently, that means simply \"the hammer\" ;p\n\nTESO:Triskelion - forum RP, guilde francophone\n\nAjaxandriel - haut-elfe gardien 50 ;\n\nAltarya - haute-elfe templière 50 ;\n\nAngelith - elfe des bois gardienne 50 ;\n\nAntarius Scorpio - impérial chevalier-dragon 50 ;\n\nArtémidore de Corbeaulieu - bréton lame noire 50 ;\n\nAzothos Sadras - elfe noir sorcier 50 ;\n\nCelestras - haut-elfe sorcier 50 ;\n\nDiluviatar - elfe des mers sorcier 50 ;\n\nDorguldun gro-Arash - orque sorcier 50 ;\n\nHjarnar - nordique sorcier 50 ;\n\nJendaya al-Gilane - rougegarde chevalier-dragon 50 ;\n\nSabbathnazar Ullikummi - elfe noir chevalier-dragon 50 ;\n\nSelvaryn Virotès - elfe noire lame noire 50 ;\n\nTahajmi - khajiit sorcière 50 ;\n\nTelernil - haut-elfe templier 50 ;\n\nZadzadak - gobelin nécromancien 50 ;\n\nZandoga - rougegarde chevalier-dragon 50"
