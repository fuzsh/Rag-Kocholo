        "text": "intertitlenoun\n\nA piece of static text inserted into the film to provide context or other information.\n\nThe film made frequent use of intertitles, every scene change was accompanied by text describing the new location.\n\nIntertitle\n\nIn motion pictures, an intertitle is a piece of filmed, printed text edited into the midst of the photographed action at various points, generally to convey character dialogue, or descriptive narrative material related to, but not necessarily covered by, the material photographed. Intertitles, then known simply as \"titles\", were a mainstay of silent films once the films became of sufficient length and detail to necessitate dialogue and/or narration to make sense of the enacted or documented events. The earliest known use of intertitles was in the 1901 British film Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost. The first Academy Awards presentation in 1929 included an award for \"Best Title Writing\" that went to Joseph Farnham for no specific film. The award was never given again, as intertitles went out of common use due to the introduction of \"talkies\". In modern film, intertitles are used to supply an epigraph, such as a poem, or to distinguish various \"acts\" of a film or multimedia production by use as a title card. However, they are most commonly used as part of a historical drama's epilogue to explain what happened to the depicted characters and events after the conclusion of the story proper."
