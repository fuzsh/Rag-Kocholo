        "text": "Hi.\n\nHow do native speakers usually call an animal?\n\nFor an example, if I am talking to someone about his/her pet, can I say:\n\n\"She is so cute.\" without knowing the actual gender of the cat, or, is it better to just say \"Your cat is so cute.\"\n\nI think generally speaking, you can call a cat \"she\" and a dog \"he\" and any animal \"it\" (sounds somewhat rude to me) but not sure.\n\nThank you!\n\nFor pet animals, we use the appropriate (male or female) pronoun. Where the noun is gender-specific, we also use he/she: so a bull is he, a cow is she.\n\nOn the cat question, you might like to look at this previous thread cat -- gender.\n\nPersonally, it would never occur to me automatically to refer to a cat as \"she\" - but different views are expressed in the thread .\n\nPeople invariably seem to refer to my (female) dog as \"he\" until I correct them, yes. I'm not sure about cats: from what I remember from when we had two, most people I think knew what their names were.\n\nIt's a bit rude to call a dog \"it\" when talking to the owner unless you're expressing displeasure over something \"it\" has done.\n\nPlease see this thread: Pets >>IT<<\n\nYou are right, people prefer that you not refer to their pets as 'it'.\n\nIf you don't know the gender, your solution is a good one: \"Your cat is so cute.\"\n\nHere are some more threads:\n\nAre animals referred to as \"she\" or \"he\"? [it]\n\nuse of he/she speaking of animals [+it]\n\n\"It\" when referring to animals\n\n[ I'll close this thread to keep from increasing the number of threads on the subject. ]\n\nCagey, moderator.\n\nAdded: Cross-posted with Loob and DonnyB.\n\nEdit: Thread later merged and opened.\n\nThe usage is dependent on the context.\n\nFor example, a farmer talking about his or her cow would almost certainly say She's got a limp.\n\nBut if a cow approached someone, we would say It came closer to the person walking through the field.\n\nI doubt whether pet owners would use it, even when talking about a pet tarantula.\n\nI have written:\n\n\"When the Chinese president saw a panda, she had already eaten a peace of bread.\"\n\nI have a question about \"person\" in English. If I want to \"nammed\" a panda (I mean an animal), how should I named panda? He, she or It?\n\nI don't understand at least, which person should I reffer a panda? He, She or It?\n\nJust in case, if someone didn't understand me, I ask the question otherwise:\n\nIs panda he, she or it?\n\nKind regards.\n\n<<Mod note: DanStyle's thread has now been merged with an earlier thread.>>\n\nAn animal is 'it', but if you know its sex, it can be 'she' or 'he'. If you have a pet dog yourself, you know its sex, and you're its friend, so you would always call your dog 'she' or 'he' as appropriate. But other dogs you see in the street are 'it' unless you know them \"personally\".\n\nThe two pandas at Edinburgh Zoo are ready to mate (the zookeepers hope). Here is a story about them, which calls Tian Tian 'she' - obviously her sex is important in this story, so she is called 'she' here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-26813170 But if it was a story where the panda died, or injured a keeper, it might call the panda 'it'.\n\nFrom your first sentence, I would assume the Chinese president was the 'she' referred to, as pandas don't eat bread (as far as I know). (Note: 'a piece of bread'.)\n\nIf you know the gender of the panda, you could refer to it (!) as 'he' or 'she'.\n\nFor pet animals, we use the appropriate (male or female) pronoun. Where the noun is gender-specific, we also use he/she: so a bull is he, a cow is she.\n\nAnd what sex is a fly? Well, I watched a video on YT. A Canadian was doing live streaming and a fly was bugging him. At some point he killed it with a clap and said \"I think he has just met his end\". So why 'he'? Well, first of all, a fly is not a pet and then how do you know a given fly is male or female . Interestingly enough, in Polish a fly will always be referred to as 'she' . Feminists might feel anxious in English speaking countries.\n\nAttachments\n\nfly.jpg\n\nin Polish a fly will always be referred to as 'she' .\n\nWell, that's because presumably the Polish word for \"fly\" has feminine grammatical gender (it has in German too). English nouns do not have grammatical gender and therefore the choice of calling a creature he or she is generally based on that particular creature's sex, if known. I'd have called it \"it\" too, but often (more so in the unenlightened past) the default gender for more or less anything will be masculine, though I like the idea of \"typically male behaviour\".\n\nSuch default gender is evident in French and Spanish, which have different masculine and feminine plural pronouns, i.e. two versions of \"they\". The feminine version is applied to a group of people only when all of them are female. When they are of mixed sex, the masculine pronoun is used.\n\nIn other words, we will never call any type of insect, worm, etc 'he' or 'she', right? Unless we have scientific context where we are talking about females and males? Or would it still be odd to refer to an insect as 'he' or 'she' even in such context?\n\nIf there is a hen walking down the street, I'll ask \"What is it doing here?\", right? It would be odd to call a hen I don't know 'she', right?\n\nHowever, referring to a hen of mine, I might say 'she', for example, \"She looks sick\", right? Or would you still call it 'it' because a hen is not a pet?\n\nIt would be odd to call a hen I don't know 'she', right?\n\nNot necessarily. If you know it's a hen, then you know it's female. But you might not know it's a hen, it could just be a chicken.\n\nIf you see a bull in a field, do you call it \"he\" or \"it\"?\n\nIf I met you walking your dog, I didn't know what sex it was, I'd say something like 'Nice dog. What's its name?' or 'What is it, a boy or a girl?' Then, depending on your answer, I will talk about him or her as 'he' or 'she'.\n\nIf you were out with a cow, for instance, I would know she was a she, and ask 'What's her name?'\n\n'What is it, a boy or a girl?'\n\nIs that the question you ask in everyday language? Can I call any animal a girl or a boy when asking about its sex? Interestingly enough, speaking of dogs, in Polish we will ask \"Is this a dog or a bitch? \"\n\nIf you were out with a cow, for instance, I would know she was a she, and ask 'What's her name?'\n\nSo if it's clear it is a cow, most native speakers will say \"her\"? Or some will say equally naturally \"What's its name?\"\n\nIn other words, we will never call any type of insect, worm, etc 'he' or 'she', right? Unless we have scientific context where we are talking about females and males? Or would it still be odd to refer to an insect as 'he' or 'she' even in such context?\n\nIf you are bitten by a mosquito you could conceivably refer to it as 'she' because only female mosquitos bite. Not that I do, though.\n\nSo if it's clear it is a cow, most native speakers will say \"her\"? Or some will say equally naturally \"What's its name?\"\n\nIt's quite possible, I guess, that some might say, 'what's its name?'.\n\nIt is entirely possible that the person won't recognise it as being a cow, in which case they would almost certainly use \"it\".\n\nAnyways, in the context I mentioned, i.e., you just kill a fly that is bugging you, calling a fly \"he\" is very unnatural for you all, right?\n\nOrdinarily, most people would use \"it\". However it is common to anthropomorphise animals, even insects, imagining them to be capable of conscious thought and having a personal vendetta against you. In this situation, you would almost certainly give them a gender and then use the appropriate pronoun.\n\nSWAT!​\n\n\"Got him!\"​\n\nOrdinarily, most people would use \"it\". However it is common to anthropomorphise animals, even insects, imagining them to be capable of conscious thought and having a personal vendetta against you. In this situation, you would almost certainly give them a gender and then use the appropriate pronoun.\n\nSWAT!​\n\n\"Got him!\"​\n\nOk, it's clear to me, but why not \"Got her!\" Possibly because in many languages the masculine gender prevails? Like God will be called 'he' possibly in all languages?\n\nOk, it's clear to me, but why not \"Got her!\"\n\n\"Got her!\" is fine. I imagine different people assign different genders to annoying insects, it is just that I am more familiar with using \"he\". If you are going to anthropomorphise an animal, then you have to give it a gender, but it is often an arbitrary choice.\n\nWell, I asked that Canadian why he called the fly 'he' and he replied: \"Hmm. We do that sometimes. We assign an animal or insect a gender. For instance if I was talking about a mosquito I might say, \"Oh this mosquito is so annoying. He tried to bite me three times!\"\n\nAttachments\n\nhe.jpg\n\nIf you found a dead mouse, would you refer to it as \"he\" or \"she\"? Or is it much more natural to refer to it as \"it\" ?\n\nWell, this American referred to a dead mouse that some cat had left on his lawn as \"he\", saying \"Poor little mouse. I think a cat got him.\""
