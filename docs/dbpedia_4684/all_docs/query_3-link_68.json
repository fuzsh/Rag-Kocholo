W. Griffith's 1919 silent film Broken Blossoms, the opium house in London that the protagonist goes to is described on the intertitle as \"Chinese, Malays, lascars, where the Orient squats at the portals of the West\".\n\nIn most countries, intertitles came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film.\n\nSpanish intertitles have been translated into German with the aid of the censor- cards\n\nThere are a total of seven narrative sequences; the three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles: \"Prologue – The Diner\" (i) Prelude to \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\" \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\" Prelude to \"The Gold Watch\" (a – flashback, b – present) \"The Gold Watch\" \"The Bonnie Situation\" \"Epilogue – The Diner\" (ii) If the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 4b, 3, 5.\n\nThe German intertitles were taken from extant prints and flash-titles restored digitally from the negatives.\n\nSome intertitles were from other countries.\n\nA Picture Shot In The Back (intertitle).\n\nThe earliest known use of intertitles was in the British film Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost.\n\nThe film, HAUNTED CASTLE (Schloss Vogeloed), was restored in #, using the following material: an original negative of the Federal Film Archive, Berlin and a celluloid, tinted copy, with Portuguese intertitles from the Fundacao Cinemateca Brasileira, preserved in the Federal Film Archive in Koblenz\n\nA Free Ride's opening intertitle denotes the film's setting as \"in the wide open spaces, where men are men and girls will be girls, the hills are full of romance and adventure\".\n\nOnly a few of the \" animated intertitles \"\n\nThe intertitles were, as far as they were present, taken from the negatives.\n\nThe animation combines editorial cartooning techniques with live-action-like sequences, and is considered McCay's most realistic effort; the intertitles emphasized that the film was a \"historical record\" of the event.\n\nThe wording of the German intertitles was recreated with the aid of German-French intertitles from a copy at the Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique, Brussels.\n\nThe intertitles include excerpts from the writings of Walt Whitman.\n\nThe intertitles were - when available - taken from the copy of the Bundesarchiv - Filmarchiv or corrected electronically.\n\nOn 20 September 1927 it was made a projection for the criticism that advised to cut intertitles, delete some others and eliminate some scenes of the film before presenting it to the public.\n\nThe intertitles in the surviving print were different than the ones from the pages of the official Censor\n\nAuthors"
