        "text": "Samtec has 10 connector systems – both cable-to-board and board-to-board — that achieve outstanding performance at 112 Gbps PAM4 data rates. The 112 G cable systems are Samtec Flyover® solutions that are designed for mid-board, mid-board to front-panel, mid-board to back-panel, and panel-to-panel configurations. (Here’s a link if you want to learn more about the benefits of Samtec Flyover)\n\nIn this video, Matt Burns, Director of Technical Marketing, walks us through a live demonstration of a new Samtec front-panel cable system, coupled with Synopsys advanced silicon, operating at 112 Gbps PAM4.\n\nLet’s begin by taking a look at the signal path. The Synopsys 112G Ethernet PHY generates two lanes of 31-bit, PRBS data at 112 Gbps PAM4.\n\nSignals travel from the PHY to a Samtec Bulls Eye® connector, the BE70A. Bulls Eye is a high-performance test system.\n\nFrom the Bulls Eye connector, the signal travels through 12” of low-loss microwave cable, to Samtec 1.85 compression mount jacks on a Samtec NovaRay® Evaluation Board. Here we see a mid-board NovaRay cable system directing signals to a NovaRay I/O front panel assembly.\n\nThe signals loop back along the same path, back to the Synopsys 112 G PHY for analysis.\n\nBTW, the NovaRay I/O cable is two meters long, and the total signal path of the entire demo is over 2.6 meters.\n\nThe results are great. For this 112 Gbps PAM4 system, the BER is e-10, the eye patterns are wide open, and the bathtubs are very clean.\n\nNovaRay I/O is a 112 G panel mount cable system, which includes front panel brackets. It has full external EMI shielding and is available in 16 and 32 differential pair configurations.\n\nThe internal cable is 34 AWG Eye Speed low loss twinax, and the external cable is either 28 or 34 AWG."
