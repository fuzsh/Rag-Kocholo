        "meta_description": "<p>Beachgoers delight in this large, black pterodactyl-like bird that soars effortlessly on tropical breezes with hardly a flap, using its deeply forked tail to steer. Watching a Magnificent Frigatebird float in the air truly is, as the name implies, magnificent. These master aerialists are also pirates of the sky, stealing food from other birds in midair. Males have a bright red pouch on the throat, which they inflate like a balloon to attract females. Females unlike most other seabirds look different than males with their white chest. </p>",

        "text": "Magnificent Frigatebirds are large seabirds with long, angular wings. They have a deeply forked tail that is often held closed in a point. The bill is long and sturdy with a prominently hooked tip.\n\nRelative Size\n\nLarger than a Brown Pelican, smaller than an American White Pelican.\n\ngoose-sized or larger\n\nMeasurements\n\nBoth Sexes\n\nLength: 35.0-44.9 in (89-114 cm)\n\nWeight: 35.3-67.0 oz (1000-1900 g)\n\nWingspan: 85.4-88.2 in (217-224 cm)\n\nMagnificent Frigatebirds are mostly black, but females and young birds have varying amounts of white on the head, chest, and belly. Females have a white chest and a dark head. Juveniles start with a white head and belly and gradually obtain darker heads. Young birds also have a pale tan streak on the upper wing. Breeding males are entirely black save for the bright red throat pouch, which is not always visible.\n\nMagnificent Frigatebirds soar over the ocean on outstretched wings with their head drawn into the shoulders. They rarely flap their wings, but when they do their wingbeats are slow and deep. Despite being a bird of the ocean, they don't dive after fish; instead they skim fish from the surface of the water or chase other birds, forcing them to give up their recent meal."
