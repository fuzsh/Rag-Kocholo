        "text": "One of Samtec’s many live product demonstrations at IMS 2024 showcased our variety of mm wave solutions. It included our compression mount board connectors in both vertical and edge launch designs, new Nitrowave™ coaxial cable technology, Analog over Array™ connector solutions, glass core technology, and flexible waveguide technology.\n\nThere’s a lot going on, and in this video, Samtec’s J.R. Bonnefoy walks us through the demo, the equipment, and the performance.\n\nA waveform generator sends baseband I/Q signals through one meter of Samtec Nitrowave coaxial cable. All four cables are phase-matched to one picosecond. Samtec’s new Nitrowave cable technology is phase and amplitude stable with flexure over time.\n\nThese cables connect to a Samtec Analog Over Array board, via Samtec 2.92 vertical compression mount RF. Samtec Analog Over Array technology can replace dozens of precision RF connectors, offering a smaller footprint, less weight, and cost optimization.\n\nThe signals travel through another set of 10” phase-matched Samtec Nitrowave cables, to a mm wave radio. We also see Samtec edge launch connector designs, including 2.92 and 2.40 mm.\n\nOn the radio, the baseband traffic is modulated to 73.2 GHz carrier frequency. The radio circuitry is built on glass, using Samtec Glass Core technology.\n\nSamtec Glass Core technology is ideal for designing micro multichip modules. It provides low dielectric loss and, therefore, offers improved performance over PCB. Its CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) is close to silicon’s, making it very stable when stacking device modules. It’s ideal for integrating structures like filters, antennas, wave guides, and chip-to-chip links.\n\nThe through-glass vias are hermetic, and since glass is clear, it’s also perfect for optics applications.\n\nThe carrier frequency travels through two, six-inch Samtec flexible waveguides, separated by a programmable attenuator. Samtec flexible waveguide offers the near-loss performance of a rigid waveguide while still providing the flexibility and size typically associated with a coaxial cable.\n\nThe signal takes a symmetrical path back to the digitizer: through another mm wave radio, analog over array board, more Nitrowave cable, and back to a digitizer where we look at the quality of the QAM signal received.\n\nAnalyzing the signal received, we see a signal-to-noise ratio of around 30 dB and an error vector magnitude of 3% for a symbol rate of 3 GHz at 256-QAM (24 Gbps).\n\nSamtec offers complete RF interconnect solutions to 110 GHz microwave, mm wave frequencies. This includes end-to-end RF cable assemblies, board connectors, cable connectors, adaptors, and Samtec Original RF Solutions.\n\nHere’s some links to recent RF news:"
