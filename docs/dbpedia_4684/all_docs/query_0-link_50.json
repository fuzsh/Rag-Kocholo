        "meta_description": "The intriguing Common Raven has accompanied people around the Northern Hemisphere for centuries, following their wagons, sleds, sleighs, and hunting parties in hopes of a quick meal. Ravens are among the smartest of all birds, gaining a reputation for solving ever more complicated problems invented by ever more creative scientists. These big, sooty birds thrive among humans and in the back of beyond, stretching across the sky on easy, flowing wingbeats and filling the empty spaces with an echoing croak.",

        "text": "Not just large but massive, with a thick neck, shaggy throat feathers, and a Bowie knife of a beak. In flight, ravens have long, wedge-shaped tails. They're more slender than crows, with longer, narrower wings, and longer, thinner “fingers” at the wingtips.\n\nRelative Size\n\nAbout half again larger than an American Crow or Chihuahuan Raven\n\ncrow-sized\n\nMeasurements\n\nBoth Sexes\n\nLength: 22.1-27.2 in (56-69 cm)\n\nWeight: 24.3-57.3 oz (689-1625 g)\n\nWingspan: 45.7-46.5 in (116-118 cm)\n\nCommon Ravens are entirely black, right down to the legs, eyes, and beak.\n\nCommon Ravens aren’t as social as crows; you tend to see them alone or in pairs except at food sources like landfills. Ravens are confident, inquisitive birds that strut around or occasionally bound forward with light, two-footed hops. In flight they are buoyant and graceful, interspersing soaring, gliding, and slow flaps.\n\nCommon Ravens live in open and forest habitats across western and northern North America. This includes deciduous and evergreen forests up to treeline, as well as high desert, sea coast, sagebrush, tundra, and grasslands. They do well around people, particularly rural settlements but also some towns and cities."
