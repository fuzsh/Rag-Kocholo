        "meta_description": "Introducing FREQ™, the world’s first ultrasonic, full spectrum electronic game call. It operates like traditional e-callers but features two premium True Cast speakers, one low-frequency speaker that plays sounds at the end of the spectrum that humans can hear, and one ultrasonic speaker that plays high-frequency sounds. These speakers play full spectrum sound which was recorded on state-of-the-art recording equipment designed specifically to capture both low and high (ultrasonic) sounds. This patented technology is why FREQ dramatically outperforms ordinary e-callers and is exclusive to FREQ. There is nothing else like it available today!",
