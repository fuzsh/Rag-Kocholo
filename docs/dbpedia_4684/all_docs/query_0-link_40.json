        "text": "The Turkey is a large bird native to the Americas that we know very well due to its popularity during the month of November and our Thanksgiving holiday. Interestingly, the Wild Turkey can frequently be seen roaming in environments inhabited by humans and during mating season can be unpleasantly aggressive!\n\nBrookline, a small town in Massachusetts has experienced this aggression first hand, to extreme ends, as the Wild Turkey population, once reduced to nearly non-existent, has seen a successful return to healthy numbers thanks to a statewide initiative to restore these native birds. From nearly extinct to a healthy population of over 37,000 birds is a true conservation success story! Unfortunately, some negative repercussions are experienced from this success as people are pursued in the streets by these remarkable, but aggressive, birds during mating season.\n\nThe Wild Turkey is a long time symbol of an important National tradition that plays a significant role in both history as well as to the ecosystem in which it is both prey and predator. Obviously, we need to live together peaceably! The town leaders of Brookline have come together and determined a plan is needed to protect their citizens, tourists, and the turkeys.\n\nThrough some brilliant brainstorming a solution has been developed – a Turkey Self Defense Training Center is to be established using town education funds. Brookline citizens will be able to attend training and receive their “Turkey Safe” certification which will include various means of self-defense as well as a solid introduction to Turkey Psychology. The town is excited about their solution and ready to implement as soon as possible."
