The quality of the screening is of utmost importance to us, so we insist on DCP or 35 mm print screenings whenever possible. Other formats may be available for small venues, depending on the title.\n\nDCP is the best option. A DCP is a specialist hard disk designed specifically for digital cinema servers to ingest from. A 2K projector (eg. Christie, Nek, Barco, Sony) is required. Projections must adhere to the Digital Cinema Standard according to the DCI standard (see www.dcimovies.com). Our DCPs are “open”: we do not deliver a KDM (Key Delivery Message), and therefore do not need your server details.\n\n35 mm is excellent quality, as well, but bear in mind that shipping is more expensive for you and we expect our prints to be returned in the same condition you receive them. For 35 mm, an excellent projectionist and sometimes a variable speed projector, depending on the title, is required. The projection speeds of some of the films (THE GOLD RUSH, THE KID/THE IDLE CLASS, THE CHAPLIN REVUE, PAY DAY) are different from modern day prints and require expert handling. The other films are normal 35mm, 24 frames per second, sound prints (soundtrack= sound effects only), or silent in the case of The Circus, after the opening sequence of Chaplin’s song.\n\nIf DCP is really not possible, certain titles are available in HDCAM, which will require an HD projector with HD-SDI input.\n\nWe are phasing out our Digibetas and do not recommend them. These are only to be used as a last resort. PAL DigiBeta is preferable to NTSC. NTSC has a blurred effect when someone in the film moves their arm, for example. PAL DigiBeta does not do away with this blurring altogether (DCP DOES) but is nevertheless better.\n\nAll films are original version with English intertitles. DCP is the only format we have with subtitles available in certain foreign languages. If you are in a non-English-speaking country and you are not using DCP, or if our DCP does not have your language, you will need to organize electronic subtitling at your own expense. We will provide the English intertitle texts in a Word document to help you do so.\n\nScores for Live Orchestral Screenings\n\nThe scores to City Lights, Modern Times, The Circus, The Gold Rush, Shoulder Arms, A Dog’s Life, and The Pilgrim were restored for modern day orchestral use and live orchestral screenings by Timothy Brock.\n\nThe scores to The Kid and The Idle Class were restored for modern day orchestral use and live orchestral screenings by Carl Davis.\n\nReduced orchestrations (restored by Timothy Brock) of The Kid, The Gold Rush, A Dog’s Life, Shoulder Arms and The Pilgrim to enable smaller venues and musical ensembles to present a film with live music are also available\n\nMusic Hire\n\nYou also need to apply to our music publishers, details follow, giving size of hall, ticket prices, number of seats etc, and they will establish the music hire (and performance fees if you do not wish to pay performance fees to your local collection organisation). To give you an idea, their music hire is approx USD 800 – USD 1200 per performance, plus shipment costs, (plus a refundable deposit).\n\nBourne Co.\n\n35 West 45th Street, 2nd Floor\n\nNew York, NY 10036\n\nTel: (212) 391-4300\n\nFax: (212) 391-4306\n\nE-Mail: Bourne@bournemusic.com\n\nSite: www.bournemusic.com\n\nThe following perusal scores are now available on bournemusic\n\nCity Lights - Modern Times - The Circus - The Gold Rush (full and reduced scores) - The Idle Class - The Kid (full and reduced scores) – A Dog’s Life (reduced score) – Shoulder Arms (full and reduced scores).\n\nScroll down the list until you get to “WORKS ON RENTAL, Orchestra”, where you will find the Chaplin titles in the alphabetical list."
