Different edition (Special ed. vs. no ed. statement; Special ed. vs. Collector's ed.)\n\nCAUTION: With video cataloging, format information is sometimes entered in 250. Since this could be considered note information or not worth considering as a note, generally accept the edition statement as found on the record (all other things being equal) if the format information applies to the item in hand, e.g. use a record with 250 Widescreen version if the item in hand is widescreen and the phrase appears on an approved source of information; do not use the record if the item in hand is full screen. Cf. 9.\n\n3. Black and white vs. color (or colorized)\n\n4. Sound vs. silent (e.g. a video of a silent film without a soundtrack vs. a silent film with a soundtrack)\n\n5. DVD Region Variations. DVD region vs. DVD region. There are 8 DVD regions, although catalogers are likely to encounter only 1-6. Generally a DVD will only play on the region player programmed for it, although some players are specially programmed to play multiple regions. North America is Region 1, and DVDs produced for this market will be assigned that region, but the extent of the YUL collection and the various sources used by our selectors is such that we can expect to receive many DVDs for other regions, and they may have the same or very similar content to DVDs produced for the North American market. For an overview of DVD regions see DVD Demystified FAQ, #1.10. See also the instruction on 538.\n\n6. Videocassettes/DVD Color System Variations. VHS NTSC vs. VHS PAL vs. VHS SECAM (NTSC is compatible with standard U.S. vcrs; PAL and SECAM are not, although they may be played back on special \"universal\" vcrs). NTSC, PAL and SECAM are color systems and are also applied to DVDs, so a DVD PAL may not be compatible on a DVD NTSC player, or would require a different setting on the player.\n\n7. VHS vs. DVD vs. Laserdisc.\n\nCAUTION: Since both laserdiscs and DVDs may use the same SMD in 300 $a, i.e., videodisc footnote 2, be sure to check the size: DVD standard is 4 3/4 in. (for DVD); laserdiscs range in size from 8 to 12 in. Check the 538 note (should indicate DVD or Laserdisc). Note that the use of 007 Format code v for DVDs was not authorized until 2002; DVDs cataloged prior to the change may have Format code g, the same code used for laserdiscs.\n\nCAUTION: Titles in the series Criterion collection <without qualifier> are restricted to laserdiscs per SAR LCCN 93124386. DVDs in the Criterion collection series are distinguished by a qualifier per SAR LCCN 00034882, i.e. Criterion collection (DVD videodiscs). However, DVD titles in the utilities have often been assigned the series Criterion collection without the qualifier (DVD videodiscs). In such cases, do not make a new record; edit the utility record to match the established heading for the series.\n\n8. Dubbed version vs. subtitled version\n\n9. Subtitles in English vs. subtitles in Cantonese\n\n10. Widescreen (letterbox/lbx) vs. full-screen (pan and scan)\n\n11. Theatrical release vs. \"Director's cut\"\n\n12. Theatrical release vs. theatrical release plus \"making of\" documentary\n\nA change in copyright on the box or sleeve will sometimes just reflect a change in packaging design; if this is the only change, generally do not create a new record or update the cataloging copy. (YUL)\n\nIf the bibliographic record does not indicate closed captioning, and the copy in hand has closed captioning, generally just update the bibliographic record unless you are certain that two versions exist. (YUL) See also instructions for notes in 546 and subject access under Subjects.\n\nFootnote 1: \"Among the most troublesome differences that may NOT justify a new record are the choices made by different catalogers about video publishers. in the 260 subfield $b section of OCLC's \"When To Input A New Record,\" one murky guideline says: \"Absence or presence of multiple publishers, distributors, etc., as long as one on the item matches one on the record and vice versa\" does NOT justify a new record. The intention of this guideline is to remind catalogers that it is often difficult to differentiate publishers, distributors, and producers of videos. This is so not simply because of the welter of often ambiguous information that may be associated with any given video, but also because the definitions of \"publisher,\" \"distributor,\" and \"producer\" can be so jumbled.\"--Jay Weitz. Videorecording Cataloging: Problems and Pointers.\n\nFootnote 2: AACR2r with 2004 amendments. 7.5B1 allows the option to use a term in common usage to record the specific format of the physical carrier, and gives as an example: \"1 DVD-video.\" Since LC uses AMIM rather than AACR2, there is no LCRI and no de facto national policy on whether to use the option. Therefore, it is possible that as more libraries elect to apply the option, the ambiguity referred to will be less frequent.\n\nAMIM or AACR2\n\nThe Library of Congress uses AMIM (Archival Moving Images Material manual) for its video cataloging. PCC uses AACR2; Yale uses AACR2, even for archival cataloging. If a PCC rule interpretation exists, it will be recorded at the appropriate rule number in the LCRIs. In the absence of a PCC RI, follow the local rule interpretations recorded here and identified as (YUL). Most of the local interpretations are based on common utility practice.\n\nChief source\n\n(7.0B1): The chief source is (in order of preference):\n\na) the title and credit frames (opening AND closing; be sure to check at the end of the video.)\n\nb) If the item is not playable because we lack the playback equipment for the item to be cataloged, the chief source is the physical item itself (the carrier).\n\nDVD. For purposes of determining chief source, the carrier is the videodisc, NOT the box or sleeve it comes in (the AACR2 glossary is somewhat misleading). Option b) also applies when the video itself lacks credit information but credit information is found on the disc.\n\nVIDEOCASSETTE. For purposes of determining chief source, the carrier is the videocassette and its label, NOT the box or sleeve it comes in. Option b) also applies when the video itself lacks credit information but credit information is found on the carrier, e.g. the videocassette label.\n\n(YUL:) Since the title on the carrier sometimes differs from the title on the frames, for original cataloging every effort should be made to find a suitable playback device and view the actual video. Although not required, for the benefit of shared cataloging include a source of title proper note if option b) is used. (See example in the Notes section for 7.7B3.)\n\nIf information is not available from a) or b), take it from (in order of preference):\n\naccompanying textual material\n\ncontainer (i.e., the box or sleeve) footnote 3\n\nother sources\n\nNote that if the title and statement of responsibility are not taken from a) or b), the information must be enclosed in square brackets; for example, title & statement of responsibility information taken from accompanying material, or the box/sleeve, must be in square brackets.\n\nPrescribed sources for the other areas. No order of preference is given if more than one source is provided. If information is not taken from one of the sources listed below, it must be recorded in square brackets.\n\nEdition (250) chief source, accompanying material, container (including the box or sleeve) Publication, distribution, etc. (260) chief source, accompanying material, container (including the box or sleeve) Physical description (300) any source Series (4xx/8xx) chief source, accompanying material, container (including the box or sleeve) Note (5xx; 246) any source Standard number & terms of availability (020, 028, 024) any source\n\nChoice of entry\n\nVideos are generally entered under title, based on AACR2 21.1C1, where the cataloger is instructed to enter under title when personal authorship is diffuse and the work does not emanate from a corporate body. Some exceptions might be: video art, where in some cases the video is totally conceived and executed by a single individual, a video about a business firm commissioned by the firm, or a video of a conference if the conference is named.\n\nNote that AACR2 21.1B2, e), a music video by a performing group \"where the responsibility of the group goes beyond that of mere performance, execution, etc.\" is entered under the name of the group. For performance situations, LCRI 21.23C applies the rules for sound recordings to videorecordings when the video contains works by different persons or bodies (entry under \"principal performer).\n\nFootnote 3: AACR2 glossary defines a container as: \"Housing for an item, a group of items, or part of any item, that is physically separable from the material being housed (e.g., a box for a disk or videocassette, a sleeve for a sound or videodisc).\" However, 7.0B1 uses container in 2 senses. As option b) of chief source, a container is \"an integral part of the piece (e.g., a cassette).\" However, as \"information not available from the chief source,\" a container is understood to be \"not an integral part of the piece,\" by inference, the box or sleeve used to contain the videocassette. And, by inference, in the prescribed sources of information for the edition, publication, and series areas, \"chief source\" includes container in the first sense, and \"container\" implies container in the second sense. Olson's 1998 Cataloging of audiovisual materials states \"The place of publication or distribution for videocassettes is given only on the container in many cases. If so, it must be bracketed.\" This was probably based on the 1993 version of AACR2, where \"container\" was not listed as one of the prescribed sources. \"Container\" is listed as one of the prescribed sources for edition, publication, and series area in the 1998 version of AACR2. Conclusion: in current cataloging, information taken from the box or sleeve does not need to be bracketed for the edition, publication, or series areas.\n\n130\n\nFollow the LCRIs implemented with 2005 Update 1:\n\n25.5B, Appendix I\n\n25.6B3.\n\nHighlights:\n\nUniform title assigned if title of the motion picture conflicts with the title proper of any other bibliographic resource\n\nFor motion picture uniform titles, qualifier is always \"(Motion picture);\" for television program uniform titles, qualifier is always \"(Television program)\"[if in doubt whether a motion picture or television program, use (Motion picture)]\n\nAdditional qualifiers to differentiate motion picture with the same title (in order): year of original release, director, production company. Note that when this situation occurs, the bibliographic record(s) for the previously cataloged title will need to be updated. If there is a previously existing authority record for the previously cataloged title, it must be updated; if no authority record existed, it should now be made, with an appropriate differentiating qualifier.\n\nDifferent titles in the same language (U.S. title vs. British title): use the same uniform title.\n\nDubbed motion pictures (qualify by the language). See the RI for multiple dubs & combinations of multiple dubs and subtitles.\n\nMotion picture with translated intertitles (qualify by language)\n\nSubtitled motion picture released under a different title (do not qualify by language)\n\nFilmed simultaneously in different languages under different titles (apply 25.5C3)\n\nDistinguishes for both motion pictures and television programs between \"individual titles intended to be viewed consecutively\" and \"individual titles not intended to be viewed consecutively.\" If intended to be viewed consecutively, the comprehensive title is the first element. Treatment is applied to 130 or 245 as appropriate (see first bullet). See 245 ‡a ‡n ‡p ‡h. Television episodes.\n\nTreatment of television compilations. See 245 ‡a ‡n ‡p ‡h. Television episodes.\n\n245 ‡a ‡n ‡p ‡h\n\n245 Credits in Title Proper\n\nLCRI 7.1B1 notes that LC does not follow AACR2, but also includes PCC practice. Follow PCC practice cited here when transcribing video titles:\n\nWhen credits for performer, author, director, producer, \"presenter,\" etc., precede or follow the title in the chief source, in general do not consider them as part of the title proper, even though the language used integrates the credits with the title. (In the examples below, the underlined words are to be considered the title proper.)\n\nTwentieth Century Fox presents Star wars\n\nSteve McQueen in Bullitt\n\nEd Asner as Lou Grant\n\nJerry Wald's production of The story on page one\n\nOrdinary people, starring Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland\n\nThief, with James Caan\n\nThis does not apply to the following cases:\n\n1) the credit is within the title, rather than preceding it;\n\nCBS special report\n\nIBM--close up\n\nIBM puppet shows\n\n2) the credit is actually a fanciful statement aping a credit;\n\nLittle Roquefort in Good mousekeeping\n\n3) the credit is represented by a possessive immediately preceding the remainder of the title.\n\nNeil Simon's Seems like old times\n\n245 ‡h [videorecording]\n\nThe GMD is required for videorecordings.

Television Programs (including video and film formats) (see 130 above), the name of the television series is entered in 245 ‡a and the episode should be entered as a dependent title using ‡n ‡p.\n\nGenerally accept cataloging copy that follows the alternative practice footnote 4. One possible exception might be if a number of separate episodes following different practices were being cataloged at the same time; in that case it would be better to follow one or the other practice for all episodes.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nThe RI requires that television episodes meant to be viewed consecutively (as in the following example) must include a ‡n subfield (numeric designation).\n\nNote that ‡h follows ‡p.\n\n\"Giving 246 title access or not [to the ‡p title] is based on the character of the individual title and a judgment of the usefulness of title access in that form.\"--RI.\n\n245 0 4 ‡a The Civil War. ‡n Episode 1, ‡p 1861--the cause ‡h [videorecording] / ‡c a Florentine Films production ; produced in association with WE​TA-TV ; executive producer, Ken Burns ; produced by Ken Burns and Ric Burns ; a film by Ken Burns ; written by Geoffrey C.

Unlike serials, a 130 is not made solely to remove the initial article in ‡p. Note use of 246 to provide access to the title/episode number combination in cases where the RI instruction is to leave out the numeric designation in the title proper.\n\n245 0 0 ‡a Tanner '88. ‡p ​The night of the Twinkies ... 246 3 0 ‡a Night of the Twinkies 246 3 ‡a Tanner '88. ‡n Volume 1\n\nNews-show episodes do not fall into the consecutive sequence category unless there is some explicit indication of \"consecutiveness\" (e.g. Nightline.

A 5 part c-t analyzed set for the history of Islamic civilization would require ‡n in the 245 for the analytics; a multipart \"Shakespeare's plays on video\" would not get a ‡n in the 245 for the analytics. Note that in the analytic records of a classed-together analyzed set, the collective title for the multipart would not be recorded in the series position (4xx).\n\nTelevision Program Compilations\n\nAll programs in a particular season. Use \"Season\" as the standard term (item may have \"year 1,\" \"season one,\" \"first season,\" \"vol. 1,\" \"first year,\" etc.).\n\n130 0 ‡a Sex and the city (Television program). ‡n Season 5. 245 1 0 ‡a Sex and the city. ‡n The complete fifth season ‡h [videorecording] ...\n\nThe procedure is not applied to a complete series telecast over a short period of time.

The following transcription is from an RLIN NJPG record for the same manifestation:\n\n245 0 0 ‡a Tango ‡h [videorecording] / ‡c Pandora Cinema presents an Argentinian-Spanish coproduction ; Argentina Sono Film ; Alma Ata International Pictures ; written and directed by Carlos Saura.\n\nFootnote 4: Alternate practice (will continue to be encountered since many cataloging units may not follow the RI). If the name of the episode was distinctive, the episode title was recorded in 245 ‡a; the name of the television program was generally recorded in a note and a 730 was made for the television program.When the name of the episode was not distinctive, the name of the television program was entered in ‡a and the episode name was entered as a dependent title using ‡n ‡p.\n\nFootnote 5: Past practice has been to include screenwriters in the statement of responsibility based on LCRIs for 7.1F1 in CSB 11 and 36. These are no longer in the current LCRIs; note that AACR2 does not mention screenwriters and 7.7B6 gives a screenwriter in one of the examples for Credits notes. LCRI 21.29D instruction is to make added entries for \"persons who are listed as producers, directors and writers\" if the production company is not named, which suggests indirectly that writers are still considered to play \"a major role in creating a film\" and therefore should be recorded in the statement of responsibility. CPDC:\n\nCSB 11: \"Primarily this means giving the names of corporate bodies credited with the production of the work. Personal names should also be transcribed when the person's responsibility is important in relation to the content of the work. For example, names of persons who are producers, directors, and writers are given in most instances; the name of an animator is given if animation is a significant feature of the work; the name of a photographer is given if the work is a travelog.\" (quoted in Cataloging of audiovisual materials, 4th ed. 1998)\n\nCSB 36: \"When deciding whether to give names in a statement of responsibility or in a note, generally give the names in the statement of responsibility when the person or body has some degree of overall responsibility; use the note area for others who are responsible for only one segment or one aspect of the work. Be liberal about making exceptions to the general policy when the person's or body's responsibility is important in relation to the content of the work, i.e., give such important people and bodies in the statement of responsibility even though they may have only partial responsibility. For example, the name of a rock music performer who is the star of a performance on a videorecording may be given in the statement of responsibility even if his/her responsibility is limited to the performance. [Example]. Normally the Library of Congress considers producers, directors, and writers as having some degree of overall responsibility and gives them in the statement of responsibility.\"--Ibid.\n\n246 Variant titles (7.7B4)\n\nIf a title variation requires access, use 246. Whether access is made is cataloger judgment, bearing in mind that computer retrieval is unforgiving of even small variations. See also use of 246 to bring out ‡p titles in 245 section on television programs.\n\n(YUL): Although AACR2 \"container\" could be used in the first three examples, the reference is ambiguous for video, so a more specific term has been used.\n\nTitle on videocassette label varies from the title on the video.\n\n245 0 0 ‡a Thelma & Louise ‡h [videorecording] / ‡c Pathâe Entertainment, a Percy Main production ; directed by Ridley Scott ; produced by Ridley Scott and Mimi Polk ; written by Callie Khouri. 246 1 ‡i Title on cassette label: ‡a Thelma and Louise\n\nTitle printed on the videocassette varies from the title on the video:\n\n245 0 0 ‡a Mission, impossible 2 ‡h [videorecording] / ‡c Paramount Pictures presents a Cruise/Wagner production ; a John Woo film ; producers, Tom Cruise, Paula Wagner ; story by Ronald D.

This field should end with a period.\n\n2. Note that prescribed sources are: chief source, defined as: a) title frames b) \"container,\" i.e., either the video disc or the cassette and label, or, accompanying material, or \"container,\" i.e., box or sleeve. Information taken from \"container\" by either definition does not require square brackets.\n\n3. Note that the term \"edition\" or the equivalent is not a requirement for transcribing in 250. The OLAC guidelines on edition statements for DVDs are probably generalizable for video cataloging practice : \"statements that distinguish one manifestation from another should be treated as edition statements, whether they carry the word 'edition' or not ...\"\n\n4. Unlike videocassettes, DVD editions often include multiple manifestations, e.g. both a widescreen and a full-screen version. In such cases, OLAC advises: \"When a disc carries both widescreen and standard version, the information becomes a note rather than an edition statement. Don't put both statements into the 250.\"\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n250 ‡a Restored version.\n\n250 ‡a 10th anniversary ed.\n\n250 ‡a Letterbox format.\n\n250 ‡a Unrated director's cut.\n\n250 ‡a Full screen version.\n\n260 Publication, distribution, etc. area.\n\nNote that prescribed sources are: chief source, defined as: a) title frames b) \"container,\" i.e., either the DVD or the cassette and label, followed by, in order, accompanying material, and then \"container,\" i.e., box or sleeve. Information taken from \"container\" by either definition does not require square brackets. However, note that if the publication date is inferred (i.e., not associated with the date or copyright date of the publication/edition), the date is bracketed no matter what the source. The OLAC guidelines for dates found on the container tend toward the \"when in doubt\" approach. But if the date found on the container is evidently associated with the edition in hand, it should not be bracketed.\n\nUse judgment in determining the publication date from the \"title frames\" since the date may be the original release date and not the publication date of the manifestation in hand. Per 1.4F1, the date in the publication area applies to the edition to which the item belongs (e.g. the DVD reissue), not the original manifestation, e.g., the motion picture or television program. It doesn't appear that \"title frames\" are necessarily restricted to those of the original motion picture/TV program, however; \"title frames\" could be applied to a copyright date associated with the DVD publisher that appears before the beginning of the feature.\n\nFrom the OLAC Guide to Cataloging DVDs:\n\n\"Some DVDs have a copyright date on the printed disc surface that represents the date the item was published; this date would be recorded in MARC 21 field 260, just as found (with the copyright symbol).\n\n\"If there is no copyright date on the disc surface, look for the latest date of those that may be printed on the back of the container [copyright date for cover design, etc.], and use this latest date as the assumed date of publication. Record this date in brackets and without the copyright symbol because it is an assumed date. Copyright renewal dates are ignored according to LCRI 1.4F6 (CSB 92).\"\n\n260 ‡a Irvington, N.Y. : ‡b Criterion Collection ; ‡a [Los Angeles, Calif.?] : ‡b Janus Films, ‡c c2001.\n\nSince the place of publication is often absent on videos, remember that per 1.4C6, \"[S.l.]\" is considered to be the last resort. First preference is probable place (city) in English form followed by a question mark. If a probable place is not available, give the state, province, or country; followed with a question mark if this is not certain. Use [S.l.] only if none of these options is available.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that a locally produced video (lectures, video theses, class projects), for which there is a unique copy or a restricted number of copies, should be treated as unpublished material and, per AACR2 1.4C8 and 1.4D8, no data is recorded for place of publication or publisher, including [S.l] and [s.n.].\n\nJay Weitz notes that off-air recordings (licensed copies of broadcast programs or programs transmitted by satellite) are also considered unpublished materials; \"broadcasting does not constitute publication.\" In such cases, he recommends adding \"a note indicating that the recording was made under license and a note specifying the name of the broadcast station or satellite service and the date of the off-air recording.\" (Weitz, p. 78-79)\n\n300\n\nThe standard AACR2 term (specific material designation) for DVDs is videodisc, but the 2004 amendment to 7.5B1 gives catalogers the option to use \"a term in common usage to record the specific format of the physical carrier\" and uses \"DVD-video\" as an example. Since LC currently does not follow AACR2r for video cataloging there is no LCRI regarding the option. Follow the common-usage option for new cataloging, on the basis that the term is more user-friendly and in addition cannot be confused with laserdiscs. For consistency, use \"DVD\" rather than AACR2's suggested \"DVD-video.\"\n\nSee AACR2 1.5B4. You are not expected to verify or determine the playing time.\n\n1. When the playing time is stated on the item, give the time as stated.\n\n2. When the playing time is not stated, but is readily ascertainable, give the playing time.\n\n3. Follow the LCRI, i.e., do not apply the option to supply an estimated time.\n\n4. The OLAC Guidelines note that the playing time refers to the work, not the combined playing time of the work and any supplementary materials included on the DVD.\n\nBy implication, this means that DVDs issued as multipart sets, where one of the DVDs contains supplementary material, are generally described as a set rather than primary physical unit + accompanying physical unit.\n\nFollow the OLAC guidelines in original cataloging if the information is readily available. However, if the publisher only provides total running time for the set (feature + supplementary material), record the total running time rather than attempt to determine the running time of the feature. Generally follow the OLAC guidelines in original cataloging; it is not necessary to revise the playing time on member copy.\n\n7.5C. Other physical details. For video, only sound characteristics and color (or b&w) are recorded in other physical details (300 ‡b). For usage, see examples.\n\nNote that recording of aspect ratio and recording speed in Other physical details (300 ‡b) is limited to motion pictures. For videorecordings, aspect ratio (e.g. anamorphic widescreen) is usually recorded as edition information or in notes.\n\n7.5D. Dimensions. All DVDs are recorded in 300 ‡c as 4 3/4 in. (width of the disc).\n\n300 ‡a 1 DVD (123 min.) : ‡b sd., col. ; ‡c 4 3/4 in.\n\nDVD set, one DVD with feature, one DVD with supplementary material.

Per AACR7.5C3: \"Give sd. (sound) or si. (silent) to indicate the presence or absence of a sound track \" (emphasis added). Note also that per 7.5C4, use b&w for sepia prints, and so indicate in a physical description note (7.7B10).\n\n300 ‡a 1 videocassette (81 min.) : ‡b sd., b&w ; ‡c 1/2 in. 500 ‡a Silent film with organ accompaniment and English intertitles. 500 ‡a Sepia print.\n\nIf you are cataloging a new ongoing multipart, do not record running time in 300 until the set is complete. Record the running time for each part in field 505 in parentheses after the title (see second 505 example). When the set is complete, record the total running time in 300. If there is no 505, itemize the MFHD and record the running time in ‡z. When the set is complete, record the total running time in 300, compress the MFHD.\n\nRemember that the AACR2 amendments applying to multiparts also apply to video. (The \"Description based on\" note is used if the first part of the set is not the basis for cataloging.)\n\nNote that for copy cataloging, if the source copy for a multipart is for a complete set, the 300 should be left as is.\n\n4xx / 8xx\n\nExamples of video publisher series:\n\n245 0 0 ‡a Three ages ‡h [videorecording] ; ‡b The goat ; My wife's relations / ‡c [presented by] Joseph M. Schenck ; directed by Buster Keaton. 440 4 ‡a The art of Buster Keaton\n\nNote that a separate heading is used for items in the Criterion collection issued on DVD.

Publisher series is always transcribed in 4xx, while the name of the television series is entered in 245 ‡a, with the name of the episode entered as a dependent title in ‡p (preceded by ‡n in some cases). See 245 section on television programs.\n\n7xx. Make added entries for names cited in 245 ‡c.\n\nMake related work added entries for adaptations of literary or dramatic works. Optionally, make added entries for names recorded in 508.\n\n700\n\nPer LCRI 21.29D Audiovisual materials, make added entries for:\n\n--interviewers, interviewees, and persons delivering lectures, addresses, etc. or discussing their lives, works, etc.\n\n--cast members given prominence in the chief source; otherwise make added entries for each if there are less than three. [It appears that added entries are made for all cast members given prominence on the chief source even if there are more than 3; in any case, any cast member requiring an added entry must be justified in 511]\n\nFor original cataloging, if the name is significant enough to be transcribed in 245 ‡c, make an added entry, but keep in mind also that many names should not be routinely transcribed in 245 ‡c. Use judgment and record such names in 508, or not at all. footnote 7\n\nCreate author/title added entries for the original work for filmed adaptations. (See Red badge of courage example below)\n\nConsult the LCRI for situations involving performing groups and where the film maker is the main entry.\n\nOptionally, relator terms may be added (e.g. ‡e director). In the OPAC, relator term subfields do not affect indexing and display only in the Long View in uncoded form. In the staff cataloging module, relator term subfields do not affect indexing in Staff Name Heading searches; however, in Names searches, the relator term subfields do index and display. Note that if a Name search is performed without the relator term in the search argument, the name with the relator term will then interfile with the name-title and name+subject subdivision headings in the Titles Index window. footnote 8\n\nCAUTION: Use ‡e <relator term>. The ‡4 <relator code> does not display in the OPAC.\n\nThe MARC code list for relators, sources, description conventions is on the Cataloger's Desktop and also on the web at:\n\nhttp://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relators.html\n\nIf the relator term option is selected and the person performs more than one function, multiple codes may be assigned [arrange in alphabetical order]; do not assign multiple added entries for the different functions.\n\n700 1 ‡a Tarantino, Quentin, ‡e actor ‡e director ‡e scenarist\n\n710\n\nPer LCRI 21.29D Audiovisual materials, make corporate name added entries for:\n\n--the production company, unit, etc.\n\n--all bodies named in 260 (i.e., even though the body has not contributed to the creation of the resource).\n\n245 0 4 ‡a The red badge of courage ‡h [videorecording] / ‡c Metro Goldwyn Mayer ; produced by Gottfried Reinhardt ; directed by John Huston ; screenplay by John Huston ; adaptation by Albert Band. 260 ‡a New York, NY : ‡b MGM/UA Home Video, ‡c c1993. 511 1 ‡a Audie Murphy, Bill Mauldin, Andy Devine. 508 ‡a Director of photography, Harold Rosson Assoc.; art directors, Cedric Gibbons and Hans Peters; film editor, Ben Lewis; music, Bronislau Kaper. 520 ‡a Movie version of Stephen Crane's novel: the story of Henry Fleming and his initiation into manhood as a Union Army recruit during the Civil War. 700 1 ‡a Reinhardt, Gottfried. 700 1 ‡a Huston, John, ‡d 1906- 700 1 ‡a Band, Albert, ‡d 1924- 700 1 ‡a Murphy, Audie, ‡d 1924-1971. 700 1 ‡a Mauldin, Bill, ‡d 1921- 700 1 ‡a Devine, Andy, ‡d 1905-1977. 700 1 ‡a Crane, Stephen, ‡d 1871-1900. ‡t Red badge of courage. 710 2 ‡a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 710 2 ‡a MGM/UA Home Video (Firm)\n\nVideos of choreographed works: assign a 630 rather than a 730. Refer to LCRI 25.5B for uniform titles for choreographic works.\n\nFootnote 7: LCRI 21.29D Audiovisual materials also says to make an added entry for persons listed as producers, directors, and writers only if the production company is not named \"unless their contributions are significant\" (the LCRI then provides some rather restrictive examples). It is fairly common video cataloging practice to interpret significant contributions somewhat more broadly than the LCRI examples suggest.\n\nFootnote 8: Relators & searching in Voyager.\n\nCataloging Module: Names search. 1. If the name exists on a single bibliographic record both with and without the relator term (e.g. 1XX + (6XX or 7XX), the item does not display on the list under name+term. However, if one searches under name+term (sendak maurice ill), it will pull up all of the records with name+term, even if the name is present in both forms on a given record. 2. If the name exists on multiple records, any ‡e, ‡t, or ‡x will cause the name to sort after the name without subfield, irrespective of whether the name is in 6XX or 7XX:\n\n[name]\n\n[name], ‡e actor\n\n[name] ‡x Autograph\n\n[name]. ‡t [title beginning with letter \"B\"]\n\n[name] ‡x Criticism and interpretation.\n\n[name], ‡e director\n\n[name]. ‡t [title beginning with letter \"M\"]\n\nSee SCM H 2230 Visual materials and non-music sound recordings and the new [Oct. 2007] SCM H 1913 Moving Image Genre/Form Headings. To summarize:\n\nH 2230\n\na. Assign subject headings for all important topics mentioned in the summary statement (520 field).\n\nb. If a specific topic is emphasized in order to illustrate a more general concept, assign subject headings for both the specific and the general topics.\n\nH 1913\n\na. Assign genre/form headings to both fiction and nonfiction works. \"Headings may be assigned from different levels of the same hierarchy if desired.\"\n\nb. In addition, assign one of the headings from the following list:\n\n655 _0 ‡a Fiction films.\n\n655 _0 ‡a Nonfiction films.\n\n655 _0 ‡a Fiction television programs.\n\n655 _0 ‡a Nonfiction television programs.\n\n\"Films\" as an LC genre term applies to works originally released as motion pictures, video, or digitally (e.g. YouTube). \"Television programs\" applies only to works that were originially telecast.\n\nc. For films assign either 655 _0 ‡a Short films (anything less than 40 min.) or 655 _0 ‡a Feature films (40 min. or longer). Note that these terms are now assigned to both fiction and non-fiction films. (Until the new H 1913, Feature films was assigned only to fiction films 40 min. or longer)\n\nH 2230 gives the following example; a form/genre heading should now be added:\n\n520 ‡a Describes the highlights of Colombia, including the production of coffee. 651 0 ‡a Colombia ‡x Description and travel. 650 0 ‡a Coffee ‡z Colombia. 655 0 ‡a Nonfiction television programs.\n\n3. When a topic is discussed in conjunction with a particular place, make, insofar as possible, a subject entry under both the topic and the place.\n\n245 0 0 ‡a American dream ‡h [videorecording] / ‡c directed by Barbara Kopple ; produced by Barbara Kopple and Arthur Cohn. 520 ‡a In this Academy Award winner for best documentary in 1991, the true-life story of the 1985-1986 workers' strike against Geo.

When a particular person is treated as illustrative of a profession or activity, assign a heading for both the person and the field of endeavor. However, do not treat as a biography (i.e., no --Biography subdivision).\n\n520 ‡a The message of the Los Angeles evangelist who preached to thousands in the 1920s. 600 1 0 ‡a McPherson, Aimee Semple, ‡d 1890-1944. 650 0 ‡a Evangelists ‡z United States. 655 0 ‡a Short films. 655 0 ‡a Nonfiction films.\n\n5. Fiction films. Assign a) & b) as appropriate. Assign in the order listed if more than one is assigned.\n\na) Use subdivision ‡vDrama after topical subjects to the same extent you would use it for a drama in book form. SCM:SH H 1870 sec. 4: \"Bring out the topic of an individual play by assigning headings of the type described in sec. 3 [i.e. \"[topic]--Drama or [topic]--Juvenile drama. Use headings of this type as the standard means of designating topics in drama, for example, Alcoholism--Drama; Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865--Drama; Holmes, Sherlock (Fictitious character)--Drama; Brontë family--Drama.\" ]\n\nb.) Assign form headings for genre (Comedy films; Western films) or for technique (Silent films, Experimental films). Use 655 _0. The heading must be established by LC; the most up-to-date list is in OCLC authorities (search on the genre index). If the heading has not been established as 155 by LC, use the 150 heading if available and tag as 650.\n\nIt is not correct practice to subdivide form/genre headings geographically to indicate that the film is about or produced in a given place. (Not documented in H 2230, but apparently LC practice based on records in LCDB)\n\n245 0 4 ‡a The red badge of courage ‡h [videorecording] / ‡c Metro Goldwyn Mayer ; produced by Gottfried Reinhardt ; directed by John Huston ; screenplay by John Huston ; adaptation by Albert Band. 651 0 ‡a United States ‡x History ‡y Civil War, 1861-1865 ‡v Drama. 650 0 ‡a War films. <655 is not yet established; use 650 for the time being> 655 0 ‡a Fiction films. 655 0 ‡a Feature films.\n\n6. Assign Films for the hearing impaired or Television programs for the hearing impaired to all videos produced with captions or sign language for viewing by the hearing impaired.\n\nNote that the new definition for \"Films\" and \"Television programs\" is applied here as well. Films: a video originally released as a motion picture, or as a video, or digitally. Television programs: a work originally telecasted.\n\nNote that the form heading [tag as 650] Video recordings for the hearing impaired is now obsolete & should not be assigned as either 650 or 655. Note that ... for the hearing impaired is not assigned if the video only has subtitles for foreign language films; the form heading should only be assigned when justified by the 546 note Closed-captioned.\n\n7. Assign as a form heading either Films for people with visual disabilities or Television programs for people with visual disabilities to all films with additional audio description provided for the visually handicapped.\n\nNote: The heading Videos for people with visual disabilities is now obsolete.\n\n8. Foreign language teaching films. Assign the heading [...] language–Films for [...] speakers as the first heading, and bring out any special topics by assigning additional headings.\n\n520 ‡a Offers a tour of France including Paris, Alsace, Burgundy, the Riviera, Provence, the Pyrenees, and the Breton and Norman coasts. The narration in English deals with the history and culture of France, the shorter narration in French is a simplified version of the English using a controlled vocabulary aimed at the first-year student, and is followed by the French text repeated with French subtitles of the narration. 650 0 ‡a French language ‡x Films for English speakers. 651 0 ‡a France ‡x Description and travel.\n\n9.

Use code p (=content identical to original but different medium) if the video (videocassette or DVD) contains the same material as the original motion picture or television production, with no \"extras.\" \"Extras\" would include closed captioning and subtitles as well as the more obvious \"director's commentary\" and \"making of\" documentary. If there are any extras, use s (=new work). Code r (=reissued in the same medium with no change in content) might be used for a work first issued directly on videocassette in 1986 and then reissued (again on videocassette) by another publisher in 1996. Use the same publication status codes for video serials that you would use for printed serials. (CEG Appendix N, Videorecordings)\n\nDate 1 The date the video was released. Date 1 should generally correspond to the most recent date in field 260. Only Date 1 is used if code s.\n\nDate 2 The original date of the motion picture when Publication status is p. Note that u can replace some digits if the original date is approximate: 197u\n\nPlace of Publication. Use the code for the state/country of the original production, not the country of distribution or release. For multicountry productions, enter the first named state/country. Optionally, enter codes for all countries of production in variable field 044.\n\nRunning time. Select total number of minutes from the menu. RT is always rounded up to the nearest minute.
