        "text": "Author(s)\n\nConference name\n\nMedia for All 10 Conference\n\nCity\n\nCountry\n\nBelgium\n\nModalities\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring the silent era, typography was in the limelight since directors relied on written text to convey linguistic information. Title cards were often designed with exquisite refinement and creativity, acknowledging the semiotic capabilities of the visual representation of text and, on occasions, even including animations. However, the importance of typographic design was left aside with the introduction of sound since most of the information formerly included in text elements was now conveyed auditorily.\n\nNevertheless, the establishment of written text as a linguistic source for the construction of the film's narrative during the silent era had a tremendous impact not only on the history of cinema but also on the inception of audiovisual translation (AVT). Indeed, many scholars attribute the birth of AVT to the translation of intertitles in the silent era. As Chaume (2020) expressed, “as soon as the first titles were inserted in movies, translation became fundamental to the full understanding of filmic narration.” Consequently, different methods and strategies were developed to translate the various elements, which influenced the further development of the AVT industry.\n\nIn the 1950s, typography recovered part of its meaning-making role with the development of the title sequences by Saul Bass and has been gaining prominence since then, accelerated by the digital revolution. Nowadays, the elements that can be added to a movie are vast and heterogeneous and can function differently towards the narrative of the film. However, the expressive power of typography has not been equally exploited in the different types of text elements, and, consequently, their visual evolution has not followed a similar trend. While some elements, such as title sequences, have evolved to be displayed on-screen with creative animations and a particular design for each film, other text elements, such as subtitles, have followed a historical tradition and maintained a consistent and uniform appearance across films.\n\nHowever, in recent years, driven by the supremacy of the digital world, the stylistic and narrative capabilities of typographic design that had been consigned to the title sequences have begun to be exploited innovatively in other types of textual elements, such as impact captions and tailored subtitles. Due to the presence of these elements, it is critical to take greater care during the translation process to disturb the original product as minimum as possible and generate the best viewing experience. Still, this is not generally the case since the translation is done by adding a new element (oral or written) that was not present in the original product instead of replacing the text element with its translated version.\n\nThe aim of this presentation is to provide an overview of the evolution of text elements in motion pictures throughout history. To this end, a thorough analysis of over 100 audiovisual products was conducted. Pertinent examples of the expressive use of typographic design from silent films to the present day will be discussed, emphasizing the most contemporary innovative applications. Simultaneously, the relevance of the translation process in preserving the visual identity of the original product will be demonstrated.\n\nSubmitted by miguelaoz on Wed, 27/09/2023 - 11:28"
