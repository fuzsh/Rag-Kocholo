        "text": "The term “Silent film” is pretty ironic when you think about it.\n\nAlthough there really isn’t much dialogue used (if any), there are other aspects of the film to keep the viewer intrigued. For example, intertitles.\n\nIntertitles were an essential element of silent films. They both progressed the film and interacted with the audience. Intertitles provided what couldn’t happen in the film: DIALOGUE. And it wasn’t just dialogue that they provided. Some intertitles included onomatopoeia.\n\nGASP! BAM! SMACK!\n\nIf sound effects couldn’t be heard, they were written. As silent films progressed, intertitles became more aesthetically pleasing. Intricate borders were created to give the film a more ritzy appeal, and even add to the film’s arc. They were essentially primitive CGI (Computer Generated Images).\n\nSkipping the obvious aspect of early silent films (viewed in black and white; no color), another essential part of early silent films was the acting. Name some of AFI’s top 100 Films.\n\nCitizen Kane, Casablanca, Raging Bull, The Godfather.\n\nAlthough 3 of the 4 movies are in black and white, the acting style isn’t the same as early silent films. If a film had acting in it, it was mostly in the style of pantomime. Pantomime is essentially what mimes do; lots of facial expressions and clumsy gestures. The precise definition of pantomime is “The art or technique of conveying emotions, actions, feelings, etc., by gestures without speech” (“pantomime”). This isn’t the end-all-be-all for acting in early silent films however; some silent films didn’t have any acting in in at all. For example, The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight (Rector, 1897) was a staged boxing match. No pantomime needed.\n\nWhen the general public thinks of silent films, they think of funny pantomime acting, black and white film, and one other important aspect.\n\nMusic. The primitive score for films.\n\nExample of silent film music here.\n\nSilent film music was essential to the early films; the acting and set could only get a silent film so far. It really made the term “going to the movies” an experience in-and-of itself. A majority of the silent film’s score was played by the piano, but there was something interesting about the score during the advent of silent films.\n\nIT WAS LIVE.\n\nEven at the Lumiére Brothers’ first public screening, a pianist was there playing the score to their film (Cook). The music being played was supposed to add an ambiance to the atmosphere, and also give emotional cues to readers during the film. This aspect of the silent film has developed immensely today; composers get paid millions of dollars to compose music for films.\n\nTwo of the greatest contemporary film composers, John Williams and Hans Zimmer, who wrote the film scores for films like Schindler’s List, Star Wars, Inception, JAWS, The Harry Potter Series, etc., will get paid in the millions of dollars to do what pianists at live silent film screenings did in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Another industry is born."
