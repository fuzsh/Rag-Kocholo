Schoedsack, US, 1925) (71 mins) Before they went on to make King Kong, Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack told the jaw-dropping true story of a tribe of nomads in Iran known as the Bakhtiari and their epic annual 48 day trek across inhospitable terrain from Turkey to Iran to their flock’s summer pastures. Venturing through deserts, mountains, rivers and snowy wastelands in search of the life-sustaining grasslands, the Bakhtiari’s 50,000 strong caravan – complete with 500,000 cattle and goats – becomes the sole focus of the camera’s gaze. A spectacular ethnographic record, this film was intended for the lecture circuit but was snapped up by Paramount for theatrical distribution on the strength of its powerful dramatic punch. It’s easy to see how the character of Denham in King Kong was modelled after the adventurer Cooper, whose daredevil real-life exploits were the stuff of Hollywood adventure films.

In fact, there were more women working in Hollywood in its first two decades than there are now, or have been at any time since. If Hollywood is ever to achieve gender parity in its studios and boardrooms, it should look back to its beginnings. This on-line lecture seeks to highlight just how much the cinema of today owes to the brilliant but often overlooked women of the silent era: the stars, directors, screenwriters and producers. Women like Mary Pickford, who said: “I am the star, I am the producer, and I am the owner of this picture.” Or Lillian Gish, who recruited an all-woman crew for her directorial debut. Hollywood became the world leader in cinema thanks to the wit of screenwriter Anita Loos the visual flair of director Lois Weber, the charisma of stars such as Gloria Swanson and Gish and Pickford. So, travel back in time to a period when the Universal studio produced 170 films directed by women in a seven-year period – a feat never to be repeated, or even approached by any Hollywood studio since. When the best films were made by women, for a majority female audience. Presented by Pamela Hutchinson a freelance critic, writer, curator and film historian who also runs the Silent London website. Screens at 18:30 UK time. Link\n\nPast Live Streaming Events\n\n18 March\n\nWartime Propaganda And Peacetime Diplomacy: Edith Cacell On Film 1915-1928 When the German occupiers in Belgium shot Edith Cavell for treason in 1915 they handed the British and their allies a perfect propaganda opportunity to portray the enemy as brutal and uncivilized. After the war international relations shifted significantly, and cinema took a key role in cementing more friendly relations within Europe and in remembrance activities through battle reconstructions and war stories. Lawrence Napper’s accessible, illustrated talk will consider Herbert Wilcox’s extraordinary retelling of Cavell’s story in the film Dawn (1928) and discuss representations of the Cavell case on film as part of allied propaganda, shining a light on the diplomatic controversy sparked by continuing interest in the case. Presented as part of the Hippodrome Silent Film Festival. Dr Lawrence Napper is a senior lecturer at King’s College London. Event streams at 13:30 UK time. Details Here\n\n16 March\n\nQueen Of Hearts: Mary Queen Of Scots In Popular Culture Mary is not just Queen of Scots, but Queen of the movies. Like the plays, songs and ballads, the films from cinema’s earliest days have portrayed the Mary we love to know – passionate, headstrong, and with a dash of adulterous spice. In this illustrated talk, Donald Smith celebrates the Mary of legend, while inviting the equally interesting Mary of history to step out of the silver screen shadows. Presented as part of the Hippodrome Silent Film Festival. Donald Smith is an author, storyteller, and Director of the Scottish International Storytelling Festival since 1989. Event streams at 16:00 UK time.

Details Here\n\n23 February\n\nA String Of Pearls: Mandarin Ducks, Butterflies and Modern Shanghai In the 1920s The Chinese melodrama A String of Pearls (1926) exemplifies the kind of “modern cinema” Shanghai filmmakers and intellectuals in the 1920s had aspired to achieve before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. It is also one of few surviving films written by Hou Yao (1903–42), who was a pioneer in Chinese-language film theory and criticism. In this talk, Victor Fan (Reader in Film and Media Philosophy, King’s College London, author and Film Consultant of the Chinese Visual Festival from 2013–21) will introduce the historical background and critical discourses of Shanghai cinema in relation to this masterpiece.

Hart. Join George Eastman Museum Senior Curator Peter Bagrov and Preservation Manager Anthony L’Abbate to learn about the museum’s ongoing restoration of the works of everyone’s favorite cowboy, William S. Hart! In 2021 the Moving Image Department at the George Eastman Museum embarked on a multiyear project, funded by the Louis B. Mayer Foundation, to restore nine silent films of one of the first western superstars, William S. Hart (1864 – 1946). Widely distributed across the world, rereleased and reedited on multiple occasions, these films now exist in a wide range of versions and formats (35mm nitrate, 28mm diacetate, 16mm triacetate, paper prints; with intertitles in Danish, Dutch, English, German, French, Italian, etc.). The Eastman Museum has conducted a world-wide search for the best surviving film elements, and this restoration turned into a complex international reconstruction project. In addition to materials in the museum’s own collection, elements from at least seven other archives – The Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, UCLA, Fondazione Cineteca Italiana, La Cinémathèque française, Centre national du cinéma et de l’image animée, and the EYE Film Museum (the Netherlands) – will be used to put the jigsaw puzzle together. Over 30 film elements will be scanned at Eastman Museum’s Film Preservation Services department where they will be digitally restored, reassembled and sent out to 35mm film to secure long-term conservation. During the search for elements, many discoveries were made – including two films previously considered lost! Event streams at 12;00 noon Pacific Time 8.00pm UK time.

D.W Griffith, US, 1924) (104mins) This rare example of a D.W Griffiths comedy pairs silent film darling Carol Dempster with W.C Fields playing the suitably cantankerous role of a juggler and small time conman who is left, literally, holding the baby when the child’s mother dies, having been cut off by her high-born family. Together they form a double act but trouble follows when Sally, now grown up, becomes romantically involved with the son of one of her estranged grandfather’s friends.Find out more at imdb.com Presented as part of the Bristol Slapstick Festival.

Frank Urson & Cecil B.DeMille (uncredited), 1927) (118mins ) Seventy-five years before Bob Fosse’s Oscar-winning musical version of Maurine Watkins’ successful stage play, Cecil B. DeMille’s production company made this saucy silent film version. Phyllis Haver is hugely entertaining as the brazen Roxie Hart “Chicago’s most beautiful murderess” – a woman so pathologically shallow she sees notoriety for a murder rap as an opportunity to secure her fortune. Egged on by her crooked lawyer (“they’ll be naming babies after you”) Roxie neglects her long-suffering loyal husband and sets about milking her celebrity status for all she’s worth. The sequence in the prison is an absolute delight – particularly the rivalry between Roxie and fellow-murderess Velma (played by DeMille’s mistress), as are the climactic courtroom scenes. A cracking, satire on fame and the media, this fun-filled tale of adultery, murder and sin (so sinful that DeMille – known for his Biblical epics – was at pains to keep his name off the credits) is as fresh and relevant as ever.

His glorification led to a backlash in the 1950s and 60s, that declared him a fraud and a fantasist, from which his reputation never recovered. Over the last 25 years, Peter Domankiewicz – a film director, writer, and film historian – has been trying to uncover the real Friese-Greene underneath the many layers of myth painted on by those who wanted to depict him as a hero or a scoundrel. In this talk, in the year of the centenary of Friese-Greene’s death, he will be lifting off the weight of that monument to find the man beneath. 19.00 – 20-30 UK Time.
