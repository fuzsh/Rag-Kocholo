        "text": "If you’ve read any of my eblasts over the past three years, you know that I’m a huge advocate for God’s glorious gift of wonder—especially as it’s revealed in the natural world through everything He has made (Romans 1:18,19). The Lord speaks to us through maple trees, hummingbirds, butterflies and millions of other living organisms…and it’s a monologue that continues 24/7/365.\n\nJerry and I have really enjoyed producing this month’s featured video because it showcases a creature that is beautiful, mysterious, and a literal beacon for God’s creative power. If you live in the eastern United States, Japan, Thailand, India or several other countries throughout the world, then you probably know that June is the unofficial start of firefly mating season. Beginning at twilight for the next 4-6 weeks, “lightening bugs” will glow in forests, grasslands, and along lake shores. It’s a spectacular light show that you can watch right now.\n\nFireflies are bioluminescent. They produce their own light through an elaborate chemical process that takes place inside of their abdomens. It’s a fascinating process that we explore through live footage and computer animation. I hope you can take seven minutes this week to watch FANTASTIC FIREFLIES, celebrating and reflecting on these wondrous works of God.\n\nThanks for your encouragement and support. You light up our lives every day."
