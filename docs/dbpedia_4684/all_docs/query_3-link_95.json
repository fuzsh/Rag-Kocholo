Intertitles were a mainstay of silent films once they became of sufficient length and detail to necessitate dialogue and/or narration to make sense of the enacted or documented events. The development of the soundtrack largely eliminated their utility, except as an occasional artistic device (for instance, as a gimmick in Frasier or to describe a location in Law & Order, or in the films of Guy Maddin).\n\n\"Intertitle\" is an academic term invented long after the advent of sound film (see also subtitle (captioning) and supertitle). These \"titles\" should not be confused about with the modern-day definition of subtitle (titling) or main title.\n\nNotably, Alfred Hitchcock began his career as an illustrator of intertitles for silent films. He resumed this work for his television show, Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\n\nSee also\n\nAcknowledgment (creative arts)\n\nBilling (filmmaking)\n\nCharacter generator\n\nClosing credits\n\nCredit (creative arts)\n\nDigital on-screen graphic (BUG)\n\nLower third\n\nOpening credits\n\nSubtitle (captioning)\n\nTitle sequence\n\nWGA screenwriting credit system\n\nExamples\n\nThalia in a Three Stooges title cards\n\nThe time is short, you die at dawn from the intertitles of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920)"
