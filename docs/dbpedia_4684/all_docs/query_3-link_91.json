The advent of talkies marked the dawning of the era of sound films, as opposed to silent films Example: the landmark film In Old Arizona (1929), was advertised as \"100% All-Talking\", and \"You Hear What You See\" on its poster, because it was the first sound western from a major studio (Fox Pictures); Singin' in the Rain (1952) took a look back at the dawning of the talkies talking head(s) a medium shot of people conversing; used as a criticism - denoting an uninteresting image tap a slang term, meaning to \"pick\", \"select\", \"name\", or \"appoint\" tearjerker(s) an excessively-sentimental or emotional film, usually with suffering female protagonists, tragic circumstances, manipulative scenes, and dramatic musical scoring; aka melodramas or weepies; derogatively known as a 'woman's film' or 'chick flick'; contrast to feel-good film Examples: Dark Victory (1939), Now, Voyager (1942), Mildred Pierce (1945), Letter From an Unknown Woman (1948), Love Story (1970) (pictured), Beaches (1988), and Steel Magnolias (1989) Technicolor the trade name for the best known color film process; 3-strip color is often used as a synonymous term; also used generically as a term for rich, bright, vibrant, sometimes garish colors; Technicolor films were described as highly saturated (with pure and vivid colors); Technicolor (a 3-color dye transfer system) was introduced in the Disney short cartoon, Flowers and Trees (1932) This new process in the 1930s involved a camera that used prisms to split the light coming through the lens onto three strips of black-and-white film, one each for the primary colors (red, green, blue; with complementary color dyes: cyan, magenta, yellow) tech-noir modern day (or post-modern) expressionistic film noirs set in the future, with dark, decaying societies Examples: Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982) (pictured), Outland (1981), Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), The Terminator (1984), Robocop (1987), Total Recall (1990), Kathryn Bigelow's Strange Days (1995), Andrew Niccol's Gattaca (1997), Alex Proyas' Dark City (1998), and David Cronenberg's eXistenZ (1999) telefilm refers to a feature-length motion picture made for television; also known as telepic or telepix; see also made-for TV movie telephoto\n\n(lens)\n\nrefers to a camera lens with a very long focal length and narrow angle of view - the effect is to compress or condense depth in space, thereby bringing distant objects closer to the viewer (without moving the camera), but it also flattens the depth of the image; it has the opposite of the effect of a wide-angle lens\n\nExample: Mike Nichols' The Graduate (1967) and the extreme telephoto shot of Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) running towards the church - and appearing to run in place; or the scene of Indy Jones (Harrison Ford) running from natives in the opening sequence of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) tentpole an industry slang or trendy buzzword term, meaning a film that is expected to serve as a primary support for a studio, i.e., to be a top-grossing blockbuster (usually during the summer season), to compensate for a studio's other flops; usually the film is the start of, or an installment in, a franchise Example: Armageddon (1998) and other $100 million-plus films, such as Spider-Man (2002) or Shrek (2001) theatre - theater\n\n(film) the place for screening, presenting, or viewing a film or motion picture; aka cinema theatrical a slang term referring to a feature-length motion picture theme\n\n(film) the central characteristic, idea, concern or motif in a film theme music the opening or closing music of a motion picture, often containing the film's 'signature' or leitmotif tune/phrase that is associated with a character or situation within the film Examples: 'Laura's theme' in Laura (1944), John Williams' shark music in Jaws (1975). 3-D a film that has a three-dimensional, stereoscopic form or appearance, giving the life-like illusion of depth; often achieved by viewers donning special red/blue (or red/green) polarized lens glasses; when 3-D images are made interactive so that users feel involved with the scene, the experience is called virtual reality; 3-D experienced a heyday in the early 1950s; aka 3D, three-D, Stereoscopic 3D, Natural Vision 3D, or three-dimensional\n\nExamples: the first major 3D feature film was Bwana Devil (1953) [the first was Power of Love (1922)], House of Wax (1953), Cat Women of the Moon (1953), the MGM musical Kiss Me Kate (1953), Warner's Hondo (1953), a version of Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder (1954) and Universal's Creature From the Black Lagoon (1954), Comin' At Ya!

See gel and sepia. Example: The Great Train Robbery (1903) was selectively hand-tinted. D.W. Griffith's Intolerance (1916) (pictured) tinted each of its four episodes (and its \"cradle rocking\" interludes) in a different color: the \"Modern\" Story was tinted amber, the \"Judean\" Story was tinted blue, the \"French\" Story was tinted in sepia, and the \"Babylonian\" Story was tinted grey-green. Gold tinting was also used to \"color\" the gold, brass beds, gold teeth, gilt frames, and the canary cage in Greed (1924).
