        "text": "With the warmer than average temperatures this past week, our winter resident ducks were in courtship mode. The spunky Hooded Merganser drake seen here positioned himself at the edge of the reeds. He threw back his head, exhibiting his striking crest, while calling repeatedly to his girl.\n\nListen to the Hooded Merganserâ€™s distinct courtship call, which sounds more frog-like than duck-like. She, with her richly hued cinnamon colored crest, after a time appeared, and they then drifted off together to forage in the shallow waters of the pond."
