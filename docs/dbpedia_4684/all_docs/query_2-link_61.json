        "text": "I’m pretty excited about this month’s theme; it has been in the planing stage since late last year but I think all the work will prove to be worth it. We’re going to take a whirlwind tour of Latin America and discuss the silent films that were made in that part of the world.\n\nGenerally speaking, English language information on Latin American silent films is pretty scarce and the films are not covered extensively even by hardcore movie buffs. This is uncharted territory for me and many of my readers and I am looking forward to the journey.\n\nIn the past, I have written about Latin American silent stars (Ramon Novarro, Lupe Velez, Dolores del Rio) and have reviewed Sergei Eisenstein’s Que Viva Mexico (my header image is from that film) but the pictures I will be reviewing this month will be filmmakers from Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico telling their own stories.\n\nI would also like to say that more than any other event, this month was the result of help from my readers and Twitter followers. Thank you to everyone who helped me track down films, shared their collections and research materials, and who volunteered to help me with intertitles in Spanish and Portuguese. I am extremely grateful for your kind assistance and this month would not have been possible without you.\n\n***"
