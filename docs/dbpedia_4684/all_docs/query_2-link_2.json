BACKGROUND\n\nField 041 is currently defined in the Bibliographic format as follows:\n\n041 - Language Code (R)\n\nIndicators\n\nFirst - Translation indication\n\n# - No information provided\n\n0 - Item not a translation/does not include a translation\n\n1 - Item is or includes a translation\n\nSecond - Source of code\n\n# - MARC language code\n\n7 - Source specified in subfield $2\n\nSubfield Codes\n\n$a - Language code of text/sound track or separate title (R)\n\n$b - Language code of summary or abstract (R)\n\n$d - Language code of sung or spoken text (R)\n\n$e - Language code of librettos (R)\n\n$f - Language code of table of contents (R)\n\n$g - Language code of accompanying material other than librettos (R)\n\n$h - Language code of original (R)\n\n$j - Language code of subtitles (R)\n\n$k - Language code of intermediate translations (R)\n\n$m - Language code of original accompanying materials other than librettos (R)\n\n$n - Language code of original libretto (R)\n\n$p - Language code of captions (R)\n\n$q - Language code of accessible audio (R)\n\n$r - Language code of accessible visual language (non-textual) (R)\n\n$2 - Source of code (NR)\n\n$6 - Linkage (NR)\n\n$8 - Field link and sequence number (R)\n\nCurrently intertitles are coded in $j with subtitles. This coding is misleading and not helpful for retrieval purposes because intertitles are in no way subtitles. Intertitles are more like captions because they provide access to the entire language content of the resource. Captions were recently removed from $j and put in their own subfield ($p) for this reason as well as others (See Proposal 2018-02).\n\nIn silent films intertitles are the filmed, printed text edited into the midst of the photographed action of a motion picture. Mostly in use in the era of the silent film this printed text provides the entire textual content of a film since there is no sound. In modern sound films this technique is sometimes used at the beginning of a film to inform the viewer of the back story or as an epilogue to explain what happened after the conclusion of the film. In this case the text does not represent the entire language content of the film and is not routinely mentioned by catalogers in the cataloging record. There is no indication in the literature that there is a need for coding of these short textual prologues and epilogues so the audiovisual community recommends that it not be included in the coding of the 041. In addition, these prologue/epilogue texts, as well as text that appears as “thought bubbles”, are always in the language that is spoken in the film and are thus already coded in the 008 for language.\n\nFor silent films the code in the 008 is zxx because there is no spoken language in silent films. The 008 35-37 says this:\n\nFor visual materials, coding depends on the type of material. For moving image materials, the language content is defined as the sound track, the accompanying sound, or sign language. For moving image materials with no sound or sign language content or, if with sound, no narration, use zxx (no linguistic content).\n\nAnother way intertitles are different than modern subtitles is that subtitles either indicate what is being said in the film, or translates what is being said. It is often not all of the dialogue. For example, it is typical for videos not to use subtitles for segments spoken in English in a film that is otherwise in French with English subtitles. Since the potential usefulness of intertitles and subtitles for accessibility is different, they should be coded separately.\n\nSimilarly, transcripts are very different from subtitles since they do not appear on the screen as the film plays, but are displayed or printed separately so they can be read through without watching the film. It has also become common for streaming video vendors to provide interactive transcripts with their videos. Likewise, for spoken audio recordings the transcript can be read without listening to the recording. For accessibility uses, it would be helpful to be able to identify these separately from other accompanying material.\n\nSeparately printed librettos and lyrics will continue to be coded in $e for musical films and recordings. The transcript subfield will be for non-musical spoken word materials with the text printed separately. For musical audiovisual materials all text printed separately will go in the $e. This will make it clear that the text of a monologue with music (like the Copland piece, Lincoln Portrait) and the lyrics/text of a film like Sound of Music, where there is spoken word and songs, would both go in the $e. In general, the use of transcripts are for non-fiction audiovisual materials like documentaries and oral histories.\n\nAs we move to more granularity in our coding of the 041 field it would be beneficial to our users to be able to clearly define what is available.\n\n2. DISCUSSION\n\nWe propose adding two new repeatable language subfields to Bibliographic field 041 that clarify the language attributes of silent moving pictures and of transcripts for both moving images and audio recordings. These codes will enhance the ability of our catalogs to correctly retrieve our patron requests.\n\n2.1. Proposed Additional Subfields\n\n$i - Language code of intertitles (R)\n\nFor silent films, the language code(s) of the intertitles or title cards. Intertitles are filmed text that is shown between the scenes of a silent film to provide dialogue or narrative context.\n\n$t - Language code of accompanying transcripts for audiovisual materials (R)\n\nFor non-musical audiovisual works, the language code(s) of the printed text of the spoken content of the work. For musical audiovisual works, the language code(s) of the printed text of the sung and/or spoken content of the work should be recorded in $e.\n\nThe content of the 008 for language has been very consistent over time for moving images. For this reason the moving image cataloging community would rather not muddy the waters by changing the definition of this byte by adding intertitles to it. We realize that sign language was recently added to the 008 for language but the role of intertitles is very different than sign language since it includes more information than just what is being spoken by the actors. All kinds of information can appear in intertitles. Leaving intertitles in the 041 where it has always been, and giving it its own subfield is cleaner and fits into the definitions already established for the 008 language and the 041.\n\nThese new subfields will enable MARC to convey more accurately accessibility information. Intertitles, like captions, provide access to the entire language content of the resource.\n\n2.2. Proposed Changes to Other Subfields\n\nIn addition, some edits will need to be made to other subfields in field 041. In the $g it needs to be made clear that printed scripts for projected still images remain in the $a and the title would need to be clarified that it does not include librettos and transcripts.\n\n$g - Language code of accompanying material other than librettos [and transcripts]\n\nLanguage code(s) of significant accompanying material other than summaries (subfield $b), librettos (subfield $e) [or transcripts (subfield t)].\n\nIncludes such items as program notes, prefaces, commentaries, manuals, codebooks, user instructions, etc. For visual materials, subfield $g is used for all accompanying material, except for accompanying printed script [for projected still images] or accompanying sound (which are recorded in subfield $a).\n\nA similar change to the title and definition of $m would need to be made:\n\n$m - Language code of original accompanying materials other than librettos [and transcripts]\n\nLanguage code of original language(s) of subsidiary materials other than librettos [(subfield $e) or transcripts (subfield $t)]. The subfield follows the related subfield $b, $g, [or $t].\n\n3.
