        "text": "The codes for the languages associated with an resource when the fixed field element Lang is insufficient to convey full information for multilingual resources, resources that are translations, or resources where a medium of communication is a sign language.\n\nThe language codes found in schemes listed in Language Code and Term Source Codes may be used in field 041. OCLC prefers the use of MARC codes as found in MARC Code List for Languages. You may repeat field 041 to include MARC codes if you use non-MARC codes. Note: Instructions and examples in this section will reflect the use of MARC codes.\n\nYou may also use field 546 to record language information in textual form.\n\nUse field 041 in conjunction with Lang. If Lang is coded zxx (No Linguistic Content), do not record a code in field 041 in subfield Ça or subfield Çd. If Lang contains a code other than zxx, record the same code from Lang in field 041 in subfield Ça or subfield Çd.\n\nUse field 041 when:\n\nThe resource contains more than one language one of which may be a sign language\n\nThe resource is or includes a translation\n\nThe language of the abstracts, accompanying material, or summaries differs from the language of the main resource\n\nThe language of a table of contents differs from the language of the main resource\n\nDo not use field 041 to record the MARC language code if there is only one language associated with the resource already recorded in Lang.\n\nFor information on punctuation, see the Punctuation section below.\n\nThe code for the language associated with the resource. If Lang is coded zxx (No Linguistic Content), do not record a code in subfield Ça. If Lang contains a code other than zxx, record the same code from Lang in subfield Ça.\n\nLang: Â Â eng 041 0 Â eng Ça fre Ça ger [The resource has text in English, French, and German]\n\nFor works in multiple languages, the codes for the languages are recorded in the order of their predominance. If predominance cannot be determined, record the codes in English alphabetical order. If the code mul (Multiple languages) is recorded in Lang (meaning the resource is multilingual with no predominant language), the code for the title (or the first title, if there are more than one) and the code mul are recorded. Alternatively, any number of specific language codes may be recorded in repeating occurrences of subfield Ça.\n\nLang: Â Â fre 041 0 Â fre Ça eng [The resource has text in French (the predominant language) and English]\n\nLang: Â Â mul 041 0 Â mul Ça rus [The resource has multilingual text with no predominant language and the title is in Russian]\n\nLang: Â Â sgn 041 0 Â sgn Ça eng [The resource contains representations of the alphabet in sign language with minimal English text on title page]\n\nWhen a work is a translation or includes a translation, the code for the language of the translation is recorded in subfield Ça. The code for the language of the original work is recorded in subfield Çh. The code for the language of an intermediate translation is recorded in subfield Çk. If an resource is in the original language with an accompanying translation, repeated subfields Ça contain the codes for the languages of the translation and the original. The code for the original is also recorded in subfield Çh.\n\nLang: Â Â eng 041 1 Â eng Çh fre [The resource has text in English translated from French]\n\nLang: Â Â eng 041 1 Â eng Çk ger Çh swe [The resource has text in English translated from German; originally published in Swedish]\n\nLang: Â Â eng 041 1 Â eng Ça grc Çh grc [The resource has text in both the original Greek and in an English translation]\n\nLang: Â Â eng 041 1 Â eng Çh und [The resource has text in English and the original language is undetermined]\n\nLang: Â Â eng 041 Â 1 eng Çh mul [The anthology of poems has textÂ translated into English from multiple languages]\n\nFor continuing resources, when the language of the text changes over a period of time, record the codes for all of the languages.\n\nLang: Â Â eng 041 0 Â eng Ça afr 546 Â Â In English, 1898-1963; English and Afrikaans, 1964- [The language of the resource has changed over time]\n\nFor computer files, record the language code associated with the data and/or user interface (e.g., screen displays) in subfield Ça.\n\nLang: Â Â eng 041 0 Â eng Ça spa 546 Â Â Interface in English; citations chiefly in Spanish.

[The score of a vocal work has lyrics in Italian with a German translation accompanied by an English preface with a German translation]\n\nFor moving image resources, subfield Ça contains the language code of spoken or sung language associated with the resource, as well as sign language and any language code of the languages of accompanying sound. Code languages used to provide access to a resource in an accessible alternative mode as appropriate in either subfields Çp, Çq, or Çr.\n\nFor projected still images, such as filmstrips and slides, subfield Ça contains the language code associated with the resource, as well as any language code of the languages of accompanying printed script or accompanying sound. For all other still images, including original or historical graphic material and opaque and non-opaque graphic material, and for three-dimensional artifacts, subfield Ça contains the code of languages associated with the material, i.e. captions or other text associated with the resource or collection that are part of the preferred source of information.\n\nLang: Â Â jpn 041 1 Â jpn Çj eng Çh jpn 546 Â Â Japanese sound track; optional English subtitles.
