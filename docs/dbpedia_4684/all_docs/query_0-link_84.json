This role is important as it enables new ideas to give birth.\n\nYou are responsible for creating a nest where you and your team members, with different expertise, feel comfortable and free to be creative—where these ideas can mate to give birth to new and better ones.\n\nIn this talk, we will look at how this works best and how we can stimulate everyone to be as creative as possible.\n\nDownload presentation (47.1MB PDF)\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nSander Crombach is the founder of Fluently, an online document editor with a built-in translator.
