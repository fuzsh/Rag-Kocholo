        "text": "The executive branch of the government of Tuvalu\n\nThe Cabinet of Tuvalu is the executive branch of the government of Tuvalu.\n\nIt is drawn from, and responsible to, the legislative branch, the unicameral Parliament of Tuvalu. After every legislative election, members of parliament (MPs) elect one of their own as prime minister. The latter then appoints ministers from among the MPs to form a cabinet.[1][2] (Officially, ministers are appointed by the Governor-General of Tuvalu, who represents the monarch, with the governor-general acting on the advice of the prime minister). Initially, the Constitution provided that the number of members of cabinet (excluding the prime minister) must not be more than one third of the number of members of parliament. This was amended by the Constitution of Tuvalu (Amendment) Act 2007, which provides that up to half of the members of parliament may be appointed to cabinet (in addition to the prime minister).[3] As there are no political parties in Tuvalu, and MPs are independent members representing the interest of their constituency, the prime minister is usually careful to appoint MPs from different parts of the country as cabinet members.[4] There are currently 16 MPs.\n\nThe Constitution of Tuvalu states that the cabinet is responsible to parliament. The latter may dismiss it through a vote of no confidence.[5][6]\n\nMain article: Teo Ministry\n\nFollowing the 2024 Tuvaluan general election, Feleti Teo was appointed as prime minister on 26 February 2024, after he was elected unopposed by the parliament.[7][8][9] On 27 February, Teo appointed the members of the Cabinet.[10][11]\n\nPortfolio Minister Constituency Notes Prime Minister Feleti Teo Niutao Deputy Prime Minister & Minister of Finance and Development Panapasi Nelesoni Nukufetau Minister for Foreign Affairs, Labour, and Trade Paulson Panapa Vaitupu Minister for Home Affairs, Climate Change, and Environment Dr. Maina Talia Vaitupu Minister for Transport, Energy, Communication, and Innovation Simon Kofe Funafuti Minister for Natural Resources Development Sa'aga Talu Teafa Niutao Minister for Health and Social Welfare Tuafafa Latasi Funafuti Minister for Education and Human Resources Development Hamoa Holona Nanumaga Minister of Public Works, Infrastructure and Water Ampelosa Manoa Tehulu Nanumea\n\nMain article: Natano Ministry\n\nFollowing the 2019 Tuvaluan general election, on 19 September 2019, the members of parliament elected Kausea Natano from Funafuti as Prime Minister,[12][13][14][15] and Samuelu Teo was elected as Speaker of the Parliament of Tuvalu.[13]\n\nMrs. Teniku Talesi Honolulu, the acting Governor-General of Tuvalu convened the Parliament of Tuvalu to meet on 19 September 2019, at which Kausea Natano was elected as Prime Minister of Tuvalu.[16] Natano appointed the members of the Cabinet,[17][18] which met for the first time on 20 September 2019.[19]\n\nPortfolio Minister Constituency Notes Prime Minister Kausea Natano Funafuti Deputy Prime Minister & Minister of Fisheries & Trade Minute Alapati Taupo[17][18][19] Nanumaga Died 23 May 2022.[20] Kitiona Tausi Nanumaga Elected in the by-election held on 15 July 2022 and then appointed to the cabinet.[21][22] Minister for Justice, Communication & Foreign Affairs Simon Kofe[17][18][19][23] Funafuti Kofe resigned from his role as a minister in July 2023 to focus on the parliamentary work to amend the Constitution.[24] Panapasi Nelesoni Nukufetau Appointed in August 2023.[25][26] Minister for Education, Youth & Sports Timi Melei[17] Nanumea Minister for Public Utilities & Environment Ampelosa Manoa Tehulu[17] Nanumea Minister of Finance Seve Paeniu[17][27][28] Nukulaelae Minister for Health, Social Welfare & Gender Isaia Taape[17][18] Vaitupu Minister for Local Government & Agriculture Katepu Laoi[17] Niutao Died on 8 April 2022.[29] Sa'aga Talu Teafa[30] Niutao Won the Niutao by-election on 6 June 2022 following the death of Katepu Laoi.[31] Minister for Transport, Energy & Tourism Nielu Meisake[17] Vaitupu\n\nMain article: Sopoaga Ministry\n\nSee also: 2015 Tuvaluan general election\n\nOn 1 August 2013, Governor-General of Tuvalu Sir Iakoba Italeli made an unprecedented use of his reserve powers in removing prime minister Willy Telavi from office and appointed opposition leader Enele Sopoaga as interim prime minister.[32] On 4 August 2013, Sopoaga was elected as prime minister by 8 votes to 5.[33] He was sworn in and appointed his ministers to the cabinet a day later.[33]\n\nThe 2015 Tuvaluan general election was held on 31 March. Vete Sakaio, the deputy prime minister and minister for public utilities, was not re-elected to parliament.[34]\n\nEnele Sopoaga was sworn in as prime minister and appointed the ministers to the cabinet on 10 April.[35][36][37]\n\nPortfolio Minister Term Start End Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga 5 August 2013 19 September 2019 Deputy Prime Minister Vete Sakaio 5 August 2013 10 April 2015 Maatia Toafa 10 April 2015 19 September 2019 Minister of Communications and Transport Monise Laafai 5 August 2013 19 September 2019 Minister of Education, Youth, and Sport Fauoa Maani 10 April 2015 19 September 2019 Minister of Education, Youth, Sport, and Health Fauoa Maani 5 August 2013 10 April 2015 Minister of Environment, Foreign Affairs, Labour, and Trade Taukelina Finikaso 5 August 2013 19 September 2019 Minister of Finance and Economic Development Maatia Toafa 5 August 2013 19 September 2019 Minister of Health Satini Manuella 10 April 2015 19 September 2019 Minister of Home Affairs Namoliki Sualiki 5 August 2013 19 September 2019 Minister of Public Utilities Vete Sakaio 5 August 2013 10 April 2015 Enele Sopoaga 10 April 2015 19 September 2019 Minister of Works and Natural Resources Elisala Pita 5 August 2013 22 August 2016[38] Puakena Boreham[39] August 2016 19 September 2019\n\nSee also: 2010 Tuvaluan general election\n\nMain article: Telavi Ministry\n\nThe government led by Maatia Toafa remained in office for 3 months. In December 2010, Willy Telavi, minister for home affairs in the Toafa Ministry, crossed the floor, joined the opposition and enabled it to bring down the Toafa's government through a vote of no confidence, which was carried by eight votes to seven.[40] On 24 December, Telavi was elected as the Prime Minister, defeating Environment Minister Enele Sopoaga (who was supported by Maatia Toafa) by another 8–7 vote.[41] Telavi appointed his cabinet on that same day, Christmas Eve.[42][43]\n\nPortfolio Minister Constituency Notes Prime Minister Willy Telavi Nanumea Held office of Minister for Home Affairs from December 2010 to July 2011.

Minister for the Environment, Foreign Affairs, Labour, Trade and Tourism Apisai Ielemia Vaitupu Tourism portfolio no longer appeared in a later list.[45] Minister for Finance Lotoala Metia Nukufetau Office held from December 2010 until death in December 2012. Vacant No successor announced following death of incumbent in December 2012. Minister for Health Taom Tanukale Nui Office held from December 2010 to July 2013. Vacant No successor announced following resignation of incumbent in July 2013. Minister for Works and Natural Resources Isaia Italeli Nui Office held from July 2011 until death.[45] Willy Telavi Nanumea Office held from July 2011 to August 2013. Minister for Home Affairs Willy Telavi Nanumea Office held from December 2010 to July 2011. Pelenike Isaia Nui Office held from July 2011 to August 2013.\n\nIsaia Italeli, minister for works and natural resources, died suddenly on 19 July 2011, while attending a regional meeting in Apia, Samoa.[46] In August, his widow, Pelenike Isaia, was elected to his seat in parliament in a by-election in the constituency of Nui, thereby saving the government's parliamentary majority. She was subsequently appointed to cabinet as minister for home affairs. She is the second woman in parliament, and in cabinet, in Tuvalu's history.[44]\n\nOn 21 December 2012, finance minister Lotoala Metia died in hospital, of unspecified causes.[47] The by-election caused by his death would decide the future of the Telavi government, reduced by his death (once again) to a parity of seven seats apiece with the opposition in parliament.[48] The government succeeded in postponing it until 28 June, whereupon it was won by the opposition candidate Elisala Pita, with two-thirds of the vote.[49]\n\nOn 30 July 2013, as the government was about to face a motion of no confidence, health minister Taom Tanukale unexpectedly resigned from Parliament (and thus also from the government) altogether. As a consequence of the death of Metia, education minister Falesa Pitoi being ill and outside the country since December 2012, and Tanukale having resigned, Telavi was left with only three active government ministers other than himself: deputy prime minister Kausea Natano, foreign affairs minister Apisai Ielemia, and home affairs minister Pelenike Isaia; he also had the support of the speaker. (There were no government backbenchers.)[50] The following day, the reason for Tanukale's resignation became apparent. The speaker, Sir Kamuta Latasi, rejected the opposition's attempt to table a motion of no confidence, on the grounds that there was now a vacant seat in parliament. Latasi adjourned parliament, and ruled that it would not reconvene until a by-election had been held - thus prolonging Telavi's minority government once more.[51] However, a day later on 1 August 2013, the governor-general and head of state, Sir Iakoba Italeli, sent out a proclamation removing Telavi from office as prime minister, and appointing opposition leader Enele Sopoaga as interim prime minister.[32] Telavi had reportedly announced his intention of removing Italeli as governor-general. Opposition spokesman Taukelina Finikaso praised Italeli for having \"uph[e]ld the constitution\", since Telavi had lacked a parliamentary majority with which to govern.[32]\n\nHis cabinet lasted officially until 2 August 2013, when it was formally voted out of office by the opposition.[52]\n\nMain article: Second Toafa Ministry\n\nThis short-lived cabinet was appointed by prime minister Maatia Toafa on 29 September 2010, following the general election on 16 September. It included a number of first time MPs, who had supported Toafa in his bid for the premiership. Sopoaga's appointment as minister for foreign affairs was described as a clear sign of the importance the government placed on climate change issues within its foreign policy.[53][54]\n\nPortfolio Minister Constituency Notes Prime Minister Maatia Toafa Nanumea Was previously Prime Minister from 2004 to 2006 Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs,\n\nthe Environment and Labour Enele Sopoaga Nukufetau First time MP\n\nDiplomat; renowned as Tuvalu's \"climate change negotiator\"[55] Minister of Education, Youth and Sport Namoliki Sualiki Nukulaelae Former teacher Minister of Finance Monise Laafai Nanumaga First time MP\n\nBusinessman Minister of Health Fauoa Maani Niutao First time MP\n\nFormer journalist and clerk to Parliament Minister of Works and Natural resources Vete Sakaio Niutao First time MP\n\nCivil engineer Minister of Communication, Transport and Fisheries Taukelina Finikaso Vaitupu Former Minister of Communication, Transport and Tourism Minister of Home Affairs Willy Telavi Nanumea Former Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development\n\nSee also: 2006 Tuvaluan general election\n\nMain article: Ielemia Ministry\n\nFollowing the 2006 general election Apisai Ielemia was elected as prime minister.[56] His cabinet consisted of the following members:[1] Ielemia continued as prime minister until the 2010 Tuvaluan general election.\n\nPortfolio Minister Constituency Notes Prime Minister;\n\nForeign Minister Apisai Ielemia Vaitupu Deputy Prime Minister;\n\nMinister for Natural Resources and the Environment Tavau Teii Niutao Minister for Communications Taukelina Finikaso Vaitupu Initially appointed Minister of Communications and Works.[1] Subsequently, appointed Minister for Communications, Transport and Tourism.
