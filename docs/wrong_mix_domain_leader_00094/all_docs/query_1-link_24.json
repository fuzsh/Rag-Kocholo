Climate change, fisheries and commitments to support development from the host nation will be among Pacific island countries' interests, along with concerns about the release of treated wastewater from the disabled Fukushima nuclear plant.\n\nJapan is seeking increased buy-in for its Free and Open Indo-Pacific vision, as China increases its footprint in the region. Tokyo has recently moved to boost its security and defense ties with its Pacific neighbors."
