        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1974, ethnic differences within the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands caused the Polynesians of the Ellice Islands to vote for separation from the Micronesians of the Gilbert Islands. The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate British colony of Tuvalu. Independence was granted in 1978. In 2000, Tuvalu negotiated a contract leasing its Internet domain name \".tv\" for $50 million in royalties over a 12-year period. The agreement was subsequently renegotiated but details were not disclosed. Tuvalu will host the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting in August 2019.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nOceania, island group consisting of nine coral atolls in the South Pacific Ocean, about half way from Hawaii to Australia\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n8 00 S, 178 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nOceania\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 26 sq km\n\nland: 26 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 238\n\nArea - comparative\n\n0.1 times the size of Washington, DC\n\nLand boundaries\n\n0 km\n\nCoastline\n\n24 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24nm\n\nClimate\n\ntropical;

low levels of islands make them sensitive to changes in sea level\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nwater needs met by catchment systems; the use of sand as a building material has led to beachhead erosion; deforestation; damage to coral reefs from increasing ocean temperatures and acidification; rising sea levels threaten water table; in 2000, the government appealed to Australia and New Zealand to take in Tuvaluans if rising sea levels should make evacuation necessary\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Whaling\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note\n\none of the smallest and most remote countries on Earth; six of the nine coral atolls - Nanumea, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, and Nukulaelae - have lagoons open to the ocean; Nanumaya and Niutao have landlocked lagoons; Niulakita does not have a lagoon\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n11,147 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 222\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Tuvaluan(s)\n\nadjective: Tuvaluan\n\nEthnic groups\n\nTuvaluan 86.8%, Tuvaluan/I-Kiribati 5.6%, Tuvaluan/other 6.7%, other 0.9% (2012 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nTuvaluan (official), English (official), Samoan, Kiribati (on the island of Nui)\n\nReligions\n\nProtestant 92.4% (Congregational Christian Church of Tuvalu 85.7%, Brethren 3%, Seventh Day Adventist 2.8%, Assemblies of God .9%), Baha'i 2%, Jehovah's Witness 1.3%, Mormon 1%, other 3.1%, none 0.2% (2012 est.)\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 29.32%(male 1,675 /female 1,593)\n\n15-24 years: 18.63%(male 1,078 /female 999)\n\n25-54 years: 36.91%(male 2,080 /female 2,034)\n\n55-64 years: 8.86%(male 404 /female 584)\n\n65 years and over: 6.28%(male 274 /female 426) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 26 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 25 years\n\nfemale: 27.2 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 152\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.86% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 124\n\nBirth rate\n\n23.7 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 55\n\nDeath rate\n\n8.4 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 82\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-6.6 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 206\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nover half of the population resides on the atoll of Funafuti\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 63.2% of total population(2019)\n\nrate of urbanization: 2.27% annual rate of change(2015-20 est.)\n\nMajor urban areas - population\n\n7,000 FUNAFUTI (capital) (2018)\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n0-14 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n15-24 years: 1.08 male(s)/female\n\n25-54 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n\n55-64 years: 0.69 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 0.64 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 0.98 male(s)/female (2018 est.)\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\ntotal: 28.2 deaths/1,000 live births (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 30.6 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 25.7 deaths/1,000 live births\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 66\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 67.2 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 65 years\n\nfemale: 69.5 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 173\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n2.93 children born/woman (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 56\n\nDrinking water source\n\nimproved: urban: 98.3% of population\n\nrural: 97% of population\n\ntotal: 97.7% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 1.7% of population\n\nrural: 3% of population\n\ntotal: 2.3% of population (2015 est.)\n\nCurrent Health Expenditure\n\n15.5% (2016)\n\nPhysicians density\n\n0.92 physicians/1,000 population (2014)\n\nSanitation facility access\n\nimproved: urban: 86.3% of population (2012 est.)\n\nrural: 80.2% of population (2012 est.)\n\ntotal: 83.3% of population (2012 est.)\n\nunimproved: urban: 13.7% of population (2012 est.)\n\nrural: 19.8% of population (2012 est.)\n\ntotal: 16.7% of population (2012 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate\n\nNA\n\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS\n\nNA\n\nHIV/AIDS - deaths\n\nNA\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n51.6% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 5\n\nEducation expenditures\n\nNA\n\nUnemployment, youth ages 15-24\n\ntotal: 20.6%\n\nmale: 9.8%\n\nfemale: 45.9% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 66\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment\n\nCountry name\n\nconventional long form: none\n\nconventional short form: Tuvalu\n\nlocal long form: none\n\nlocal short form: Tuvalu\n\nformer: Ellice Islands\n\netymology: \"tuvalu\" means \"group of eight\" or \"eight standing together\" referring to the country's eight traditionally inhabited islands\n\nGovernment type\n\nparliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy;

Only eight of the atolls are inhabited. It is one of the smallest countries in the world, with its highest point at 4.6 meters above sea level. The country is isolated, almost entirely dependent on imports, particularly of food and fuel, and vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels, which pose significant challenges to development.The public sector dominates economic activity. Tuvalu has few natural resources, except for its fisheries. Earnings from fish exports and fishing licenses for Tuvalu’s territorial waters are a significant source of government revenue. In 2013, revenue from fishing licenses doubled and totaled more than 45% of GDP.Official aid from foreign development partners has also increased. Tuvalu has substantial assets abroad. The Tuvalu Trust Fund, an international trust fund established in 1987 by development partners, has grown to $104 million (A$141 million) in 2014 and is an important cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government's budget. While remittances are another substantial source of income, the value of remittances has declined since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, but has stabilized at nearly $4 million per year. The financial impact of climate change and the cost of climate related adaptation projects is one of many concerns for the nation.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$42 million (2017 est.)\n\n$40.68 million (2016 est.)\n\n$39.48 million (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 226\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$40 million (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n3.2% (2017 est.)\n\n3% (2016 est.)\n\n9.1% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 107\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$3,800 (2017 est.)\n\n$3,700 (2016 est.)\n\n$3,600 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 180\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\ngovernment consumption: 87% (2016 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 24.3% (2016 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 43.7% (2016 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -66.1% (2016 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 24.5% (2012 est.)\n\nindustry: 5.6% (2012 est.)\n\nservices: 70% (2012 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ncoconuts;
