        "text": "header2 Key Developments in 2020\n\nThere were no reported cases of COVID-19 in Tuvalu. Other than the closure of borders in mid-March virus-related lockdown measures were minimal, as no wave of infections arrived to disrupt everyday life and business. The government implemented a strict, 14-day quarantine protocol for repatriation of citizens abroad and similarly careful measures for repatriation of foreign citizens in Tuvalu. Commercial flights to the islands remained suspended at year’s end.\n\nThe pandemic drew attention to the islands’ vulnerabilities, with government officials and others remarking that an outbreak could have had alarming effects due to the country’s geographic isolation and reliance on imports. In June, Prime Minister Kausea Natano, in his role as Pacific Island Forum chair, called for sustainable international assistance for Tuvalu and other fragile regional economies to recover from economic struggles related to the pandemic, as well as to protect against natural disasters and the impact of climate change.\n\nCyclone Tino struck the country in January, causing extensive property damage and prompting concerns about food insecurity. A state of emergency was declared, and the World Bank granted the country $6 million to aid recovery efforts."
