        "text": "The H-2A program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural jobs. A U.S. employer, a U.S. agent as described in the regulations, or an association of U.S. agricultural producers named as a joint employer must file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, on a prospective worker’s behalf.\n\nWho May Qualify for H-2A Classification?\n\nTo qualify for H-2A nonimmigrant classification, the petitioner must:\n\nOffer a job that is of a temporary or seasonal nature.\n\nDemonstrate that there are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work.\n\nShow that employing H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.\n\nGenerally, submit a single valid temporary labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor with the H-2A petition. (A limited exception to this requirement exists in certain “emergent circumstances.”See e.g., 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(x) for specific details.)\n\nH-2A Program Process\n\nStep 1: Petitioner submits temporary labor certification application to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). Before requesting H-2A classification from USCIS, the petitioner must apply for and receive a temporary labor certification for H-2A workers from DOL. For further information regarding the temporary labor certification requirements and process, see the Foreign Labor Certification, Department of Labor Web page.\n\nStep 2: Petitioner submits Form I-129 to USCIS. After receiving a temporary labor certification for H-2A employment from DOL, the petitioner must file Form I-129 with USCIS. With limited exceptions, the petitioner must submit original temporary labor certification as initial evidence with Form I-129. (See the instructions to Form I-129 for additional filing requirements.)\n\nStep 3: Prospective workers outside the United States apply for visa and/or admission. After USCIS approves Form I-129, prospective H-2A workers who are outside the United States must:\n\nApply for an H-2A visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or\n\nDirectly seek admission to the United States in H-2A classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry, if a worker does not require a visa in cases where an H-2A visa is not required.\n\nH-2A Eligible Countries List\n\nExcept as noted below, H-2A petitions may only be approved for nationals of countries that the secretary of homeland security has designated, with the concurrence of the secretary of state, as eligible to participate in the H-2A program.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security publishes the list of H-2A and H-2B eligible countries in a Federal Register notice. Designation of eligible countries is valid for one year from publication.\n\nEffective Nov. 9, 2023, nationals from the following countries are eligible to participate in the H-2A program:\n\nAndorraThe Kingdom of EswatiniMadagascarSan MarinoArgentinaFijiMaltaSerbiaAustraliaFinlandMauritiusSingaporeAustriaFranceMexicoSlovakiaBarbadosGermanyMonacoSloveniaBelgiumGreeceMontenegroSolomon IslandsBoliviaGrenadaMozambiqueSouth AfricaBosnia and HerzegovinaGuatemalaNauruSouth KoreaBrazilHaitiThe NetherlandsSpainBruneiHondurasNew ZealandSt. Vincent and the GrenadinesBulgariaHungaryNicaraguaSwedenCanadaIcelandNorth MacedoniaSwitzerlandChileIrelandNorwayTaiwan*ColombiaIsraelPanamaThailandCosta RicaItalyPapua New GuineaTimor-LesteCroatiaJamaicaParaguayTurkeyCzech RepublicJapanPeruTuvaluDenmarkKiribatiPolandUkraineDominican RepublicLatviaPortugalUnited KingdomEcuadorLiechtensteinRepublic of CyprusUruguayEl SalvadorLithuaniaRomaniaVanuatuEstoniaLuxembourgSaint Lucia\n\n*Regarding all references to “country” or “countries” in this document, it should be noted that the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-8, Section 4(b)(1), provides that “[w]henever the laws of the United States refer or relate to foreign countries, nations, states, governments, or similar entities, such terms shall include and such laws shall apply with respect to Taiwan.” See 22 U.S.C. § 3303(b)(1). Accordingly, all references to “country” or “countries” in the regulations governing whether nationals of a country are eligible for H-2 program participation. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(i) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(1), are read to include Taiwan. This is consistent with the United States’ one-China policy, under which the United States has maintained unofficial relations with Taiwan since 1979.\n\nThe secretary of homeland security may consider adding a country to the Eligible Countries List upon receiving a recommendation from the U.S. Department of State or a written request from an unlisted foreign government, an employer that would like to hire nationals of an unlisted country in H-2A or H-2B status, or another interested party or parties. When designating countries to include on the list, the secretary of homeland security, with the concurrence of the secretary of state, will take into account factors that include the following:\n\nThe country’s cooperation with issuing travel documents for citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country who are subject to a final order of removal\n\nThe number of final and unexecuted (meaning completed but not yet carried out) orders of removal against citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country\n\nThe number of orders of removal executed against citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country\n\nOther factors as may serve the U.S. interest. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(i) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(1).\n\nIf you want DHS to consider adding a country to the Eligible Country List, send a written request to DHS’s Office of Policy, or the Department of State at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Country listings are valid for one year. DHS may add a country to the Eligible Country List whenever the secretary of homeland security determines that the country is eligible.\n\nA national from a country not on the list may only be the beneficiary of an approved H-2A petition if the secretary of homeland security determines that it is in the U.S. interest for the national to be the beneficiary of such a petition. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(iii) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(ii) for additional evidentiary requirements.\n\nNote: If you request H-2A workers from both eligible and non-eligible countries, USCIS suggests that you file two separate petitions. Filing one petition for workers from eligible countries and a separate petition for workers from non-eligible countries may help decrease delays in processing your request for H-2A workers.\n\nPeriod of Stay\n\nGenerally, USCIS may grant H-2A classification for up to the period of time authorized on the temporary labor certification. H-2A classification may be extended for qualifying employment in increments of up to 1 year each. A new, valid temporary labor certification covering the requested time must accompany each extension request. The maximum period of stay in H-2A classification is 3 years.\n\nA person who has held H-2A nonimmigrant status for a total of 3 years must depart and remain outside the United States for an uninterrupted period of 3 months before seeking readmission as an H-2A nonimmigrant. Additionally, previous time spent in other H or L classifications counts toward total H-2A time.\n\nException: Certain periods of time spent outside of the United States may “interrupt” an H-2A worker’s authorized stay and not count toward the 3-year limit. See the Calculating Interrupted Stay for H-2 Classifications Web page for additional information.\n\nFamily of H-2A Workers\n\nAn H-2A worker’s spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age may seek admission in H-4 nonimmigrant classification. Family members are not eligible for employment in the United States while in H-4 status.\n\nEmployment-Related Notifications to USCIS\n\nOMB Control Number 1615-0107\n\nPetitioners of H-2A workers must notify USCIS within 2 workdays if any of the following occur:\n\nNo show: The H-2A worker fails to report to work within 5 work days of the latter of:\n\nThe employment start date on the H-2A petition, or\n\nThe start date established by the employer;\n\nAbscondment: The H-2A worker leaves without notice and fails to report for work for 5 consecutive workdays without the consent of the employer;\n\nTermination: The H-2A worker is terminated before completing of the H-2A labor or services for which he or she was hired; or\n\nEarly Completion: The H-2A worker finishes the labor or services for which he or she was hired more than 30 days earlier than the date specified in the H-2A petition.\n\nPetitioners must include the following information on the employment-related notification:\n\nThe reason for the notification (for example, explain that the worker was either a “no show,” “absconder,” “termination,” or “early completion”);\n\nThe reason for untimely notification and evidence for good cause, if applicable;\n\nThe USCIS receipt number of the approved H-2A petition;\n\nThe petitioner’s information, including:\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nPhone number\n\nEmployer identification number (EIN)\n\nThe employer’s information (if different from that of the petitioner):\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nPhone number\n\nThe H-2A worker’s information:\n\nFull Name\n\nDate of birth\n\nPlace of birth\n\nLast known physical address and phone number\n\nAdditionally, to help USCIS identify the H-2A worker, submit the following for each H-2A worker, if available:\n\nSocial Security number\n\nVisa number\n\nFailure to Notify USCIS: A petitioner who fails to comply with these employment notification requirements, or fails to demonstrate good cause for untimely notification, may be required to pay $10 in liquidated damages for each instance of noncompliance.\n\nNote: USCIS defers to DOL’s definition of “workday.” According to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), this generally means the period of time on any particular day when an employee begins and ends his or her “principal activities.”\n\nHow do I notify USCIS?\n\nEmail or mail your notification to the California Service Center at the following addresses. Although not required, email notification is strongly recommended to ensure timely notification.\n\nCalifornia Service Center\n\nBy email: CSC-X.H-2AAbs@uscis.dhs.gov\n\nBy mail:\n\nCalifornia Service Center\n\nAttn: BCU Section\n\nP.O. Box 30050\n\nLaguna Niguel, CA 92607–3004\n\nFee-Related Notifications to USCIS\n\nOMB Control Number 1615-0107\n\nA petitioner, agent, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service is prohibited from collecting a job placement fee or other compensation (either direct or indirect) at any time from an H-2A worker as a condition of employment.\n\nPetitioners are provided with the opportunity to avoid denial or revocation (on notice) of their H-2A petition if they notify USCIS that they obtained information concerning the beneficiary’s payment of (or agreement to pay) a prohibited fee or compensation to any agent, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service only after they filed their H-2A petition. This narrow exception does not apply, however, where a petitioner knew or should have known at the time of filing of its H-2A petition that the prospective worker had paid (or agreed to pay) such recruitment-related fees to any such persons or entities.\n\nPetitioners must notify USCIS of an H-2A worker’s payment of or agreement to pay prohibited fees to a recruiter, facilitator or similar employment service within 2 workdays of gaining knowledge of such payment or agreement.\n\nPetitioners must include the following information in their fee-related notification:\n\nThe reason for the notification;\n\nThe USCIS receipt number of the approved H-2A petition;\n\nThe petitioner’s information:\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nPhone number\n\nThe employer’s information (if different from that of the petitioner):\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nPhone number\n\nInformation about the recruiter, facilitator, or placement service to which the beneficiaries paid (or agreed to pay) the prohibited fee:\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nHow do I notify USCIS?\n\nEmail or mail your notification to the California Service Center at the following addresses. Although not required, email notification is strongly recommended to ensure timely notification.\n\nCalifornia Service Center\n\nBy email: CSC.H2AFee@uscis.dhs.gov\n\nBy mail:\n\nCalifornia Service Center\n\nAttn: H-2A Fee\n\nP.O. Box 10695\n\nLaguna Niguel, CA 92607–1095\n\nInquiring About a Pending H-2A Petition\n\nUSCIS provides expedited processing of Form I-129 for H-2A petitions. You can check the status of your case using Case Status Online. If your petition has been pending for more than 15 days and we have not sent you a decision or request for more evidence, you may call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 to ask about the status of your case.\n\nNote: We can only provide case-specific information to authorized individuals (for example, petitioners and attorneys of record). For H-2A petitions, the petitioner is the petitioning individual or company. We cannot provide case-specific information to unauthorized third parties, such as the beneficiary (the temporary worker).\n\nOther USCIS Resources"
