        "text": "By Joanna Putman\n\nPolice1\n\nBAY SHORE, N.Y. — The New York Attorney General’s Office has released body camera footage of a fatal police-involved shooting of a man who tackled an officer while raising a knife, News 12 Long Island reported.\n\nThe Feb. 17 incident began when Suffolk County Police Department officers responded to a domestic violence call, according to the report. The video starts by showing an officer running backward away from a man wielding a knife and a baton.\n\nThe officer fell backward onto the ground, and the suspect dove on top of him while still holding the weapons, raising the knife. He can then be seen stabbing the officer in the arm.\n\nA second officer deployed a TASER moments before a third officer fired his gun, with at least nine shots heard. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene, and one of the officers sustained several stab wounds to his arm. Police stated that the officer’s bullet-resistant vest saved his life, according to the report.\n\n“The decision by NYS Attorney General Tish James to release the video of this disturbing incident shows that the actions taken by our police officers were more than justified,” Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine stated. “The only reason we did not lose this officer is due to his protective vest and training. I’m proud to support our men and women in law enforcement who are keeping Suffolk County a safer place to live.”\n\nSuffolk County Police Benevolent Association President Lou Civello also said that the officers’ actions were justified.\n\n“The body camera footage released by the Attorney General confirms what we knew all along, this was a violent criminal intent on killing a Suffolk County Police Officer. The police officer’s actions were completely justified. Had they not taken action our officer would have been murdered in cold blood,” Civello said."
