        "text": "Youth in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) live in surroundings where the relentless ocean waves have been inching closer to their homes for generations. The salty breeze carries not only the sea's aroma but also the echoes of ancestral tales and the looming anxiety of a climate-threatened homeland. By mid-century sea levels are expected to rise between 25-58 centimetres.\n\nFor young people who constitute up to 75 percent of the region’s population, these climate vulnerabilities manifest as physical and emotional distress, hampering their well-being and curtailing their potential for a fulfilling life. UNDP's recent policy paper, “A Turbulent Future: How Climate Change Impacts Young People in the Pacific,” details these issues. If no action is taken, young people are expected to face more climate-related hardships in their lifetime compared to past generations.\n\nThe climate threats are not just future projections, they’re here. Many people in PICTs live in low-lying coastal areas, making them highly susceptible to natural hazards. In Kiribati, Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu the entire population lives just five metres above sea level. According to the 2021 Victims of Disaster Index, over 75 percent of the PICTs population is already affected by disasters. The crisis in the Pacific takes different shapes. Between 2030 and 2050 rising sea levels could cause around 250,000 more fatalities each year. This increases vulnerability and economic shocks, generating a real climate emergency.\n\nUnemployment rates are startlingly high across the region, reaching up to 63 percent in the Marshall Islands. Remoteness, lack of scale and diversification, and the effects of climate change on competitiveness in international markets are contributing to unemployment and underemployment. On the one hand, domestic economies can’t provide enough jobs; on the other, some industries are experiencing a shortage of qualified labour as young people migrate in search of more stable opportunities which leads to spatial and cultural identity insecurities. Migration disrupts connections to land and heritage. For Pacific Islanders, the land is not just a place to live, it is essential to their cultural and spiritual well-being. Displacement threatens this connection, leading to anxiety and a sense of loss. And citizenship laws in several Pacific Island nations may prevent migrants from retaining or passing on their nationality, exacerbating the identity crisis.\n\nThe crisis has a gender dimension, too. Women and girls experience higher rates of violence and have limited representation in decision-making processes. Climate change worsens these vulnerabilities, as women and girls often have less control over the resources affected by environmental disasters and economic disruptions. This gender disparity means that female young people face steeper challenges finding opportunities. It is crucial to adopt a gender-sensitive approach to youth development in the Pacific.\n\nInfluenced by diverse insecurities, young people suffer from a mental health crisis that often goes unnoticed and ignored. The research describes the prevalence of self-harm, as demonstrated by the over 11,000 cases reported annually in recent years, particularly amongst people aged 20-24 years. Countries such as Kiribati, Micronesia, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, those most vulnerable to climate change, show the highest rates.\n\nThis cycle seems difficult for Pacific youth to escape, but there's hope. The policy paper suggests ensuring meaningful youth participation in climate negotiations and policymaking. Training and social support is needed to bring clarity to legal systems to promote better collaboration between the private and public sectors. The paper argues that investment in education and skills development is essential to digital literacy, entrepreneurship, and skills which are relevant to both local and international job markets. It also stresses the importance of developing mental health support programmes to address climate-induced stress and anxiety."
