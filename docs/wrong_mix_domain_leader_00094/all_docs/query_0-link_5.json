        "text": "This is the list of the members of the Parliament of Finland between May 1, 1924 – September 1, 1927 following the parliamentary election held April 1–2, 1924. The elections were originally scheduled be held in August 1925; but after the Socialist Workers Party had been outlawed and its members arrested, the Parliament only had 173 members instead of 200. Disagreement between President Ståhlberg and Prime Minister Kallio on the question of early elections caused the latter to resign. The new caretaker cabinet led by Aimo Cajander then ordered disbandment of the Parliament and early elections.[1]\n\nThe elections did not cause major changes to the Finnish political landscape. The communists—in the form of Socialist Workers' and Small Farmers' Election Alliance—lost 9 seats, majority of which were gained by Social Democratic Party of Finland. Together the parties on the left had only 78 seats, less than ever before. Social Democrats remained the largest group in Parliament with 60 seats, followed by Agrarian Party and National Coalition Party.[1] Among the 200 members of the Parliament were 17 women (8.5%).[2]\n\nKyösti Kallio acted as Speaker of the Parliament of Finland until he become Minister in March 1925. Wäinö Wuolijoki was then the Speaker 1925–26 and Paavo Virkkunen 1926–27.[1]\n\nOnly the first of the four cabinets formed during this parliament had a majority,[3] and it too lost its majority when the Agrarian Party withdraw from cabinet following a disagreement on pensions of government officials. The Ingman cabinet finally resigned four months after that due to defeat of the election bill.[1]\n\nAs neither National Progressive Party nor Swedish People's Party were willing to enter the new cabinet due to their disappointment with the election bill, Antti Tulenheimo formed a minority cabinet between National Coalition and Agrarian Parties. After this cabinet had resigned due to question of national defense funding, Kyösti Kallio headed another cabinet formed on the same basis.[1]\n\nThe fourth and last cabinet formed during this Parliament and led by Väinö Tanner is important in the Finnish political history for several reasons. It was the first time the largest party in Finland, the Social Democrats, had participated in a cabinet during the time Finland had been independent, and also only the second time in the history of the Parliament of Finland after the Tokoi senate in 1917.[1] It also had Finland's first female minister, Miina Sillanpää.[4]\n\nCabinets formed during the parliament[3] Cabinet Start End Days Parties Lauri Ingman's second cabinet May 13, 1924 March 31, 1925 305 National Coalition Party\n\nNational Progressive Party\n\nAgrarian Party[N 1]\n\nSwedish People's Party Antti Tulenheimo's cabinet March 31, 1925 December 31, 1925 276 National Coalition Party\n\nAgrarian Party Kyösti Kallio's second cabinet December 31, 1925 December 13, 1926 348 National Coalition Party\n\nAgrarian Party Väinö Tanner's cabinet December 13, 1926 December 17, 1927 370 Social Democratic Party\n\nMembers of the Parliament 1924-1927\n\nIn the table, the names written with italics were appointed to the Parliament later than May 1, 1924—the first day of the new Parliament—to replace those who had died or resigned. The names are given here as in the membership roll of the Parliament; for example the name Svento is used instead of Sventorzetski even though the latter version was used until 1938.\n\nEnglish name
