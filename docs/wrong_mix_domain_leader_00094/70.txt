Table 1 provides key indicators on children’s work and education in Tuvalu.

Based on a review of available information, Table 2 provides an overview of children's work by sector and activity.

The Tuvalu Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 6 (MICS 6) 2019–2020, which provides the most recent and comprehensive data on child labor in Tuvalu, found that 4 percent of children ages 5 to 17 were working under conditions of child labor. The survey also reported that 16 percent of children were engaging in hazardous activities that included carrying heavy loads, working with dangerous tools, and operating heavy machinery, among others. (4) However, the MICS 6 did not specify the sectors in which children in Tuvalu were engaged in child labor. (4)

Tuvalu has ratified some key international conventions concerning child labor (Table 3).

The government has established laws and regulations related to child labor (Table 4). However, gaps exist in Tuvalu's legal framework to adequately protect children from the worst forms of child labor, including the identification of hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children.

The Government of Tuvalu has not specified, by national law or regulation, the types of hazardous work prohibited for children; previous provisions applied only to males under age 18 in the industrial, mining, and fishing sectors. (6,13) Research found that while primary school is free in practice for students up to age 13, the Education Act stipulates that fees can legally be charged for education. In addition, free primary school up to age 13 does not match the compulsory education age of 15, which leaves children ages 14 and 15 without free education. (5,10,11,14)

The government has established institutional mechanisms for the enforcement of laws and regulations on child labor (Table 5). However, gaps exist within the operations of agencies that may hinder adequate enforcement of their child labor laws.

Labor Law Enforcement

Research did not find information on whether labor law enforcement agencies in Tuvalu took actions to address child labor (Table 6).

In 2022, the ILO conducted consultations on international labor conventions with the government and civil society. (5) While labor inspectors cannot assess civil penalties, they may refer matters to the Office of Attorney General for criminal prosecution and the assessment of penalties upon conviction. (6) There is no formal referral mechanism, but the government's National Advisory Committee on Children’s Rights (NACCRC) is an interagency collective coordinating child protection issues. Members of the committee can be contacted should a case of child labor be found. (5) Research could not ascertain whether routine labor inspections have been conducted, but there have been no inspections of risk-prone sectors. (5)

Criminal Law Enforcement

Research did not find information on whether criminal law enforcement agencies in Tuvalu took actions to address child labor (Table 7).
