        "text": "The Real Housewives of Atlanta returns tonight, Dec. 6, at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Bravo. It’s also available to stream on FuboTV, Sling, and Hulu + Live (free trial).\n\nHousewives Cynthia Bailey, Kandi Burruss, Porsha Williams and Kenya Moore return this season, and a new housewife, Drew Sidora, will be joining them. She’s an actress and singer who has to balance her career with being a wife and mom to three kids. Her mother is currently living in their house, which might spell trouble for Drew and her husband.\n\nCynthia is planning her wedding, but Covid-19 has not been kind to her plans. There will be tension between Cynthia and her husband as she goes full steam ahead despite the virus. Kenya’s relationship with her partner is on the rocks, but she has other things on her plate. New to motherhood, Kenya keeps bonding with baby daughter, Brooklyn, and new friend LaToya Ali comes into her life, too.\n\nKandi’s personal life may have some uncertainties with her daughter going away to college, but her restaurant empire is booming. Porsha continues to be vocal about the Black Lives Matter movement as she speaks out against systemic racism and attends rallies.\n\nWhat channel is Bravo on?\n\nYou can find which channel it is by using the channel finders here: Verizon Fios, AT&T U-verse, Comcast Xfinity, Spectrum/Charter, Optimum/Altice, DIRECTV and Dish.\n\nWhere can I watch The Real Housewives of Atlanta if I don’t have Bravo?"
