        "text": "The Real Housewives of Atlanta has a new housewife for Season 13. Thirty-five-year-old actress and singer Drew Sidora has joined the cast of the hit reality television show.\n\nDrew is best known for her roles as Chantel in That’s So Raven and T-Boz in CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story.\n\nThe accomplished actress has also appeared in, Girlfriends, Step Up, The Game, Wild Hogs and White Chicks.

By submitting your information you agree to our T&Cs and Privacy Policy.\n\nThere’s already drama teased for Drew and her husband before we’ve even seen them together on Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\nShe tells the other women that she and her husband almost divorced after she hadn’t heard from him for three days. The couple discusses the three-day-period in the trailer and Drew says to her husband, “Where did you go?”\n\nCynthia Bailey, Kandi Burruss, Kenya Moore and Porsha Williams are returning as regulars with Marlo Hampton and Tanya Sam returning to the show as friends.\n\nTwo cast-members rumored to have hooked-up with stripper\n\nA rumor is swirling that two of the ladies from the RHOA had sex with the stripper from Cynthia’s Bailey’s bachelorette party. The party was held in Charlotte, South Carolina and was filmed for the show.\n\nCynthia and Kandi were eliminated as the cast-members involved in the trio by Kenya. Kenya claimed to have heard the activities taking place and said that neither Kandi or Cynthia were involved.\n\nThe two RHOA stars rumored to have been involved are Porsha and Tanya, but could the new housewife be one of the ladies in question? The party looks like it got pretty wild, according to the trailer. Racy footage of the evening included fishnet stockings, whips, hanging apparatuses, and moaning.\n\nThe trailer also shows Kenya telling the group that she heard sex noises coming from the bedroom. Also shown in the trailer is someone saying, “She can **** really good.”\n\nBoth the stripper and Tanya denied the rumors on social media. Marlo also implied she wasn’t involved. Porsha hasn’t yet commented on the rumors."
