While the one-time New Jersey native worked steadily, it was his role as forensic investigator Warrick Brown on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" (CBS, 2000-15) that put him on the map, introducing Dourdan to a large audience week after week and establishing him as a top-notch television star.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Dourdan was raised by his creative-minded mother, a fashion designer, and father, an agent who represented jazz musicians.
