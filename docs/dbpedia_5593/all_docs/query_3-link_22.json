The major blues music consists of six notes, including 1, 2, b3, 3, 5, and 6 major scales and 1, b3, 4, b5, 5, and b7 minor scales.\n\nEarlier, blues songs were focused on the pain, agony, and injustice expressed by enslaved African-Americans with a slow tempo and melancholy melodies.

Boogie-woogie blues emphasizes the complex and intricate rhythm played on piano accompanied by vocals. The piano is one of the prominent instruments in the boogie-woogie blues to add a desirable melody to your music/songs.
