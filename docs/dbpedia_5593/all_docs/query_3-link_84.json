        "text": "Images\n\nActivities\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Play a video of Big Mama Thornton performing “Hound Dog.” Ask students for any words or phrases they would use to describe Thornton’s sound. Next, play an audio clip of “(How Much is that) Doggy in the Window?,” a Pop song recorded by Patti Page in 1953, the same year Thornton released “Hound Dog.” Ask students to speculate: how might the general audience for Pop music have responded to Thornton’s sound? [Students might find the music “raw” or “gritty,” something that would unsettle the general Pop audience.]\n\n2. Display images of Billboard’s R&B and Pop charts from May 1953. Explain that in the 1950s, the R&B chart was associated primarily with black audiences, and, in turn, the Pop chart was associated with mostly white audiences. Ask students:\n\nOn which of these charts does Thornton’s recording of “Hound Dog” appear?\n\nDo you think that Thornton was reaching a mostly black audience, or a mostly white audience? What does this racial separation on the charts suggest about race relations in 1950s America?\n\n[Note: Of the Top 10 Pop artists listed, only Nat “King” Cole is an African American. The other nine artists on the Pop chart are white.​]\n\n3. Thornton’s recording was released at a time when many public institutions in the country were segregated. Segregation had legally existed since Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 Supreme Court decision that upheld the constitutionality of segregation under the “separate but equal” doctrine. Ask students:\n\nWhat areas of American society do you know were segregated during the early 1950s? [Answers may include: schools, restaurants, public transportation, hotels, bathrooms, etc.]\n\nHow do you think segregation would have affected an African-American touring performer?\n\n4. Play the video clip of Elvis Presley performing “Hound Dog” in 1956. Ask students: what are some differences you notice between Elvis and Thornton as performers? [Students may notice their differences in gender, race, physical movements, etc.]\n\n5. Display images from the 1956 Billboard R&B, Country, and Pop charts, and have students locate “Hound Dog” on each chart. Ask students:\n\nHow does Elvis’s success with “Hound Dog” compare to that of Thornton singing the same song?\n\nWhat does Elvis’s appearance at the top of all three charts suggest about the size and racial makeup of his audience? [Note: Excluding Elvis, all artists on this Rhythm & Blues chart are African American. All artists on this Country & Western chart are white. And on the Best Selling Popular Records chart, all of the artists are white, excluding the Platters, who are an African-American group.]\n\nWhat are some reasons why a white artist may have been able to reach wider audiences than an African-American artist in 1950s America?\n\nWhile Thornton’s recording had been released three years earlier, Elvis’s version became the most commercially successful.\n\n6. Explain that the class will now consider one specific example of how desegregation impacted life in 1950s America. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Brown v. Board of Education that segregated schools are unconstitutional. Such institutions were thus required to desegregate, a process that was often tense in communities accustomed to the “separate but equal” lifestyle born of the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision. In some cases, National Guardsmen were called in to help escort African-American students into school buildings. Ask students if they understand what “separate but equal” meant to life in the American South, and why Brown v. Board of Education disrupted that?\n\n7. Break students up into small groups and hand out to each group the School Desegregation Worksheet. The worksheet contains two photographs from 1956 of a high school in Tennessee undergoing desegregation. Groups should investigate both photos and discuss the following questions:\n\nWhat range of emotions do you think the people in the photos are feeling?\n\nWhat do you think it felt like to be at school on that day?\n\n8. Continuing on the worksheet, groups should select two individuals from each photo for whom the group will creating “thought bubbles.” Use the first-person perspective, with each thought bubble describing an individual’s internal feelings or reactions to the events that are transpiring on the school’s campus. When finished, invite volunteers from each group to present their thought bubbles to the class.\n\n9. Remind students that the Brown v. Board of Education ruling was decided in 1954, between Thornton’s release of “Hound Dog” in 1953 and Elvis’s recording of the same song in 1956. Have students write a journal entry answering the following prompt:\n\nIn the fall of 1956 Elvis’s recording of “Hound Dog” topped the American Pop charts. At the same time, formerly all-white schools in some parts of the country were struggling with the process of integration. Why might a person accept racial mixing in popular culture, such as in music, but not accept racial mixing in cultural institutions, such as public schools? What does this say about the particularities and possibilities of racial mixing in music culture? How might music culture thus help lead the way towards integration in other areas of American life?\n\nHandouts\n\nSchool Desegregation Thought Bubbles\n\nStandards\n\nCommon Core State Standards\n\n4997\n\nSocial Studies – National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS)\n\nTheme 1: Culture\n\nTheme 2: Time, Continuity, and Change\n\nTheme 4: Individual Development and Identity\n\nTheme 7: Production, Distribution and Consumption\n\nNational Standards for Music Education\n\nCore Music Standard: Responding\n\nSelect: Choose music appropriate for a specific purpose or context.\n\nAnalyze: Analyze how the structure and context of varied musical works inform the response.\n\nInterpret: Support interpretations of musical works that reflect creators’ and/or performers’ expressive intent.\n\nEvaluate: Support evaluations of musical works and performances based on analysis, interpretation, and established criteria.\n\nCore Music Standard: Connecting\n\nConnecting 11: Relate musical ideas and works to varied contexts and daily life to deepen understanding.\n\nCareer Technical Education Standards (California Model) – Arts, Media and Entertainment Pathway Standards\n\nDesign, Visual and Media Arts (A)\n\nA1.0 Demonstrate ability to reorganize and integrate visual art elements across digital media and design applications.\n\nA1.1 View and respond to a variety of industry-related artistic products integrating industry appropriate vocabulary.\n\nA1.3 Describe the use of the elements of art to express mood in digital or traditional art work found in the commercial environment.\n\nA1.5 Research and analyze the work of an artist or designer and how the artist’s distinctive style contributes to their industry production.\n\nA1.9 Analyze the material used by a given artist and describe how its use influences the meaning of the work. ia, and Entertainment |\n\nA3.0 Analyze and assess the impact of history and culture on the development of professional arts and media products.\n\nA3.2 Describe how the issues of time, place, and cultural influence and are reflected in a variety of artistic products.\n\nA3.3 Identify contemporary styles and discuss the diverse social, economic, and political developments reflected in art work in an industry setting.\n\nA4.0 Analyze, assess, and identify effectiveness of artistic products based on elements of art, the principles of design, and professional industry standards.\n\nA4.2 Deconstruct how beliefs, cultural traditions, and current social, economic, and political contexts influence commercial media (traditional and electronic).\n\nA4.4 Analyze the relationship between the artist, artistic product and audience in both an existing and self-generated project.\n\nA4.5 Analyze and articulate how society influences the interpretation and effectiveness of an artistic product.\n\nA5.0 Identify essential industry competencies, explore commercial applications and develop a career specific personal plan.\n\nA5.3 Deconstruct works of art, identifying psychological content found in the symbols and images and their relationship to industry and society.\n\nPerforming Arts (B)\n\nB2.0 Read, listen to, deconstruct, and analyze peer and professional music using the elements and terminology of music.\n\nB2.2 Describe how the elements of music are used.\n\nB2.5 Analyze and describe significant musical events perceived and remembered in a given industry generated example.\n\nB2.6 Analyze and describe the use of musical elements in a given professional work that makes it unique, interesting, and expressive.\n\nB2.7 Demonstrate the different uses of form, both past and present, in a varied repertoire of music in commercial settings from diverse genres, styles, and professional applications.\n\nB5.0 Apply vocal and/or instrumental skill and knowledge to perform a varied repertoire of music appropriate to music industry application.\n\nB5.4 Employ a variety of music technology to record, integrate, or modify a live or recorded performance to produce a new artistic product.\n\nB5.7 Create melodic and rhythmic improvisations in a style or genre within a musical culture (gamelan, jazz, and mariachi).\n\nB7.0 Analyze the historical and cultural perspective of multiple industry performance products from a discipline-specific perspective.\n\nB7.1 Identify and compare how film, theater, television, and electronic media productions influence values and behaviors.\n\nB7.3 Analyze the historical and cultural perspective of the musician in the professional setting.\n\nB8.0 Deconstruct the aesthetic values that drive professional performance and the artistic elements necessary for industry production.\n\nB8.1 Critique discipline-specific professional works using the language and terminology specific to the discipline.\n\nB8.2 Use selected criteria to compare, contrast, and assess various professional performance forms."
