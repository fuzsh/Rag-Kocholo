It evolved from a rich genre of unaccompanied vocal music sung by poor African-American laborers throughout the southern states. Spirituals, field hollers, work songs and Scots-Irish narrative ballads",

        "text": "Although there are many different varieties of blues, certain characteristics are shared by all forms of blues music. The 12-bar blues progression is common to almost all blues, as is the three-line rhyming pattern AAB. The bending of specific notes, called blue notes, also is typical of the style. Most blues music is sad in character, reflecting the difficulties of both the work environment and the private lives of the early blues masters.\n\nNo other major musical genre is as tied to one particular instrument as the blues is to the guitar. Although blues music always has been first and foremost a vocal art form, musicians have used the guitar not merely for harmonic or rhythmic accompaniment, but as a way of amplifying and enhancing the spirit of a particular text. Because most blues musicians are self-taught, with little concern about the correct way of playing the instrument, the flexibility of the guitar allows each artist to develop a style based on their own personality and temperament.\n\nNevertheless, three major stylistic forms of blues and guitar playing developed in the early history of the genre: Mississippi-Deep South Blues, Texas Blues and East Coast Blues.\n\nIn many cases, blues musicians developed such individual styles that it is difficult to compartmentalize them into any school or genre of blues. Robert Johnson (1911-1938) is perhaps the best-known of the early blues legends. He is often referred to as the grandfather of rock and roll because he, in one way or another, has influenced so many rock guitarists. Shortly before his early death, he recorded a series of classic tunes including the seminal Cross Roads Blues.\n\nHowlin’ Wolf (1910-1976) was born in Mississippi and also became an influential performer, not only on the guitar but on the harmonica, as well. In his youth, Howlin’ Wolf played with Robert Johnson, and at the height of his career became one of the most recognizable blues artists. The same could be said of Muddy Waters (1913-1983), who originated the Chicago Blues. Muddy played almost exclusively on electric instruments and, like Johnson, was a huge influence on the British rock explosion of the 1960s. Other important blues musicians of this era included T-Bone Walker (1910-1975) from Texas and Homesick James Williamson.\n\nCurrently, the most recognizable and popular bluesman of his generation is B.B. King, who was born in Mississippi in 1925. B.B. has also been influential in the genre of gospel music. He can be recognized by a sweet and singing sound on a signature Gibson guitar he has named Lucille. Other famous living blues performers include Buddy Guy and Otis Rush.\n\nBlues musicians have used a variety of guitars to accompany themselves, from acoustic steel string instruments to resonator guitars to Fenders and Gibsons. Common techniques developed by blues guitarists include slide guitar and note bending."
