It starts with understanding your values, interests, and passions. By building a deeper connection with yourself, you cultivate a strong sense of self-awareness and identity. Being happy on your own does not imply complete isolation but rather embracing your independence and inner strength. It means valuing your ability to find joy and contentment within yourself, regardless of external circumstances. Practicing self-compassion is vital in this pursuit. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, especially during challenging times. Embrace your flaws and imperfections as a natural part of being human. Set personal goals that align with your aspirations and values. Celebrate your achievements, no matter how big or small, as they contribute to your sense of accomplishment and happiness. Embracing moments of solitude and self-reflection can be empowering. It allows you to recharge, gain clarity, and appreciate the beauty of your own company. Cultivating a positive mindset and practicing gratitude are essential elements of being happy on your own. Focus on positive thinking and acknowledge the good things in your life. Building a supportive network of friends and loved ones can complement your happiness, but it's essential to remember that your worth and happiness come from within. Being open to change and growth is fundamental in this journey. Embrace life's transformations, as they can lead to new opportunities and personal evolution. Practicing mindfulness helps you be present in the moment, mindful of your emotions, and aware of how you react to various situations. Mindfulness contributes to your overall well-being and happiness. In conclusion, being happy on your own is about nurturing a positive relationship with yourself, valuing your independence, and finding fulfillment from within. It's a process of self-empowerment and self-love that enhances your overall well-being and enriches your experience of life.\n\nWe had the pleasure of interviewing David Arlo over Zoom video!London-born Nigerian critically acclaimed artist David Arlo and recently released his new single “Speeding”.“Speeding” is an anthem about never looking back. A powerful ballad with charismatic qualities of hums and powerful lyricism. Watch the official music video of “Speeding”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMVORx8jnHUABOUT DAVID ARLOAs a versatile, vital, and visionary creator, ARLO tells stories through multiple avenues. No matter the medium, his stories hold truth, facing failure, loss, mental health, and life's challenges head- on. The London-born Nigerian artist, actor, and creative projects his experience through a kaleidoscope of R&B, pop, and alternative vibes uplifted by his unpredictable vocal delivery and sky scraping range. His music feels like experiencing a moment of personal revelation teeming with newfound confidence in its soulful catharsis and exuding excitement for a brighter future via fascinating soundscape architecture. ARLO has created this new body of work with hitmakers such as Malay who co-wrote and produced both Frank Ocean's Channel Orange and Blonde, Marcus Semaj who co-wrote Giveon's debut album and Hitmaker Boots who produced Beyonce's self titled Beyonce album. On the strength of demos, he landed a deal with Arista and earned acclaim from the likes of Nylon, Ones To Watch, and WONDERLAND. He opens up with a sound that's as confessional as it is catchy on a series of singles for Arista Recordings introduced by “Speeding.”We want to hear from you!

In SZA's latest album SOS she expressed a lot of her emotions, and SOS did great on the charts. So would you now consider SZA the queen of R&B? We think yes! But is this kind of expression healthy? Revisiting songs on her CTRL album SZA made it known that she has multiple insecurities. We understand that music is art, but we aren't sure how healthy this form of art is. We bring up Mary J Blige, a great R&B singer, and Mary J Blige's music is an example of what we would call Sad Girl Music. Another artist we can think of that puts out similar music is Giveon. Most of his songs are about heartbreak which you could consider his music Sad Boy Music. The songs are great to vibe and listen to but we are worried about how these artists are doing mentally. This is a clip from Ep: 66 Sad Girl LET'S STAY CONNECTED!

His textural and experimental style tries to find new ways of exploring visual and narrative storytelling - always with a human story at its core. His work has garnered recognition across the world, with inclusion in both the Saatchi & Saatchi and 1.4 New Directors Showcases, two Golds and three Silvers at the YDAs, a Gold Cannes Lion, multiple AICP wins with work featured at the MOMA, shortlists for Music Video of the Year at Shots, Best Alternative Video and Best New Director at the UKMVA's - and a growing list of awards from the industry including the British Arrows, Cannes D&AD. These honors are all the more extraordinary for a young director ––– , who is just a couple of years into his commercial film career. His body of work includes short films like “Rocket Wars,” which documents the stunning aerial fireworks battle of a Greek village, as well as commercials for Puma, Adidas, Top Boy, S7, Valvoline etc, and music videos for artists like Justin Bieber, Giveon, Little Simz, Skrillex, Don Toliver, Prince, The Weeknd, Daughter, Bearcubs and Young Fathers.

Nayte took to instagram to clear up any cheating rumors and admits to how people could get a fuckboy vibe from him but that is truly not the case. Elizabeth Corrigan from Clayton's season (and the other half of Shrimpgate) came out as bisexual this past weekend with Pride. Caelynn Miller Keyes went on Dean's podcast to clapback about some comments around how he hasn't given her a ring yet. Do you think his argument of how she has more money and should get him a truck first holds any weight? The Bachelor franchise is no stranger to whitewashing and racism, but this time it might've held Pardeep back from the beach. We want more brown folks on the beach! Pilot Pete almost had his own flight to the beach but said that contract disagreements held him back. Sure, Jan… (Bachelor talk ends at time marker 29m:48s) The BET Awards were this past weekend (all four hours of them) and we got some great performances from Chloe and Brandy and some not so great ones from Giveon. The Sanderson sisters will be returning to spook up your screens this fall with a Hocus Pocus sequel. First Cardi B had Kylie in her “WAP” music video and now she's going to the other side of the house to have Ye on her new track, “Hot Shit,” that is out this Friday! Vee went “Yikes!” to the more troubling news surrounding Ezra Miller and their seemingly unknown whereabouts. Do they have just a groomed teen with them or potentially a mom and some young kids too?

The recorded version, which spent thirty weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, opens with a full-blast chorus featuring driving percussion and ringing guitars. But performing live, the song's instrumentation was stripped down, with Bieber alone at a grand piano, crooning into the mic. For a lighthearted song (“I get my peaches down in Georgia”), this intimate performance sounded overly serious on first listen. Slowly, the band built up, adding guest verses from Daniel Caesar and Giveon between seven repetitions of the chorus. Each time the chorus returned, the band got louder, the music pointing upward until a high-flying synth solo closed the song. It may have been a surprising arrangement of Bieber's hit, but it was the same approach heard elsewhere in the ceremony. The same sort of slow climb was heard earlier in the night when Maverick City Music, the first Christian group to perform at the Grammys in twenty years, gave an uplifting performance of their song “Jireh” off their award winning album Old Church Basement. In the church tradition, the slow build is a common feature, beginning as a quiet prayer that expands outward as more voices join in. Naomi Raine, one of the group's seven members, describes it as “this common and underlying structure” that feels “supernatural and spiritual.” While that familiar structure pervades the Christian music landscape, Maverick City Music has a greater purpose in their music. “We are called to blur the lines as far as what is Christian, what is Gospel, those two have been segregated for too long,” says the group's Chandler Moore. The expansiveness of the music is represented in Maverick City Music's diverse makeup. The seven core members invite dozens of songwriters from countless backgrounds to songwriting camps to explore the traditions constraining boundaries. Having only started releasing music in 2019, Maverick City Music has released over seventeen combined LPs & EPs in multiple genres including Worship, Gospel, R&B, and Latin Pop. Consistent across all those records is that transcendent slow build. After exploring the discography of Maverick City Music, one starts to hear this song form all over pop music. In the case of Bieber, who is both friends with the group and has a religious background, his previous hit songs like “Holy” and “Anyone” also unfold in a slow build. The reworked “Peaches” Bieber performed at the Grammys even makes sense given the chorus's final line “I get my life right from the source.” There has been a long history of stylistic exchange between the religious and secular world. There would be no Rock & Roll without Gospel, and Christian Contemporary draws its sounds from the 60s folk movement. Today, songs made for worship share qualities with modern power ballads, the former elevating the spirit, the latter coaxing our emotions. On the latest episode of Switched On Pop hosts Charlie Harding and Nate Sloan speak with Maverick City Music and listen back to songs both religious and secular that lift us up.

The footage of them learning to fight crime in Detroit has been posted to our YouTube, and they once again reiterate that Dale's techniques (*might*) actually work. They get into Big Sean's Drink Champs episode where he responds to Kanye's previous comments, and wonder how Pusha T is handling the “reconciliation” of Drake & Kanye. This leads into a conversation about friendship, and how women and men handle them differently. Of course, we wouldn't be us if we didn't give people relationship advice they didn't ask for, so we try to help Justine through her breakup with Giveon (somewhat). New music is spoken on, Christmas plans, having a loose caboose, and more!"
