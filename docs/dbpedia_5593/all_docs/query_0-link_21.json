He is the only child of his mother and father (Latanya & Rodney Washington) who are also from Chicago, IL. Rodney was inspired by music at an early age with the bond he and his father had with his father taking him to school having karaoke in the car singing “Vanilla Ice” & “Gangsta Party”. As Rodney got older he took his passion in music to school where he attended Morgan Park High School. He would sell Cds & make Mix Playlist for the entire school, and would always be up on new music to introduce people to. Even though music was a passion he also had another passion which was basketball. Rodney attended Morton College (Cicero, IL) after leaving Kennedy King College after a semester to play basketball for 2 Years then went off to Graceland University (Lamoni, IA). He then came back and attended Chicago State University where he found his passion back for music but with a twist in being a radio personality. Rodney started an online show with a friend (Which is now his producer on Power92.3) every Tuesday and Thursday calling it “TTU Radio” (Too Turnt Up Radio). The show was inspired by Tone & Shagg, DJ Pharris, Mike Love & The Dez, and The LA Leakers. The goal was to bring excitement to college radio and radio in general with introducing the city to new artists and music. Rodney then was introduced to Tone Kapone where he was mentored by him and guided. With Tone showing him the ropes of radio he also was trained by Teefa and Tony Scofield where they guided Rodney in creating his sound on radio and opening his mind to doing more than just radio but actually being a voice for the people. With that Rodney took that to heart as he did his Saturday show as a start he created a Organization for the youth called “PepRallyTakeOver” where he goes to the school with his team to create a high energy for the school, bridging the gap between the youth and teachers, and motivating the youth with talking to them, and bringing artist to motivate them as well.\n\nRodney Washington otherwise known as \"HotRod\" is a radio personality on Power92.3 Chicago M-F 7pm-10pm and Saturdays 6pm-10pm.

Shortly after college she took a leap of faith and moved to LA. Landing a job in publicity was her first mild success. Fast forward four years later, Alisha managed to sweet-talk her way into NBC’s Writers on the Verge program (2014-2015).

Currently, The Big Chop can be seen on Issa Rae’s digital channel and has over two million views. Alisha is staffed on Harlem (Amazon), recently wrapped Season 2 of South Side (Comedy Central/HBO Max) and has several projects she’s developing.\n\nHost: Christine Houston, Lecturer in Scriptwriting"
