You seemed a bit stressed out as you were getting ready to walk down the aisle – what was running through your head at the time?\n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch The Real Housewives of Potomac on Peacock and the Bravo app.\n\nCandiace Dillard: I hate to be a bossy mess but on my wedding day, if I don't speak my whole mind and ensure everything that I CAN control is in place, I'm going to have regrets! And let me tell you, if I had regrets on my wedding day, I would have set the whole place ablaze and it wouldn't have been good for anyone! Overall, I have zero complaints and very few regrets about me and Chris' beautiful wedding day! It was truly a whirlwind and went by SO fast. I slept like five minutes (up writing my vows at 2 am), and when I finally did lay down to sleep, obviously, I barely closed my eyes.\n\nWhat you saw during my getting ready moments was me attempting to MANAGE my stress. I know my limits (most of the time), and I was aware that having too many people in the room while I was in hair and makeup or getting dressed was going to send me over. I'm allllll about energy. If your energy ain't right, or if I SUSPECT it ain't right, I'm locking the door. I said it best on that day, if it's not Jesus at the door, don't let them in! Amen? Amen.\n\nBravoTV.com: How did it feel to see Chris at the end of the aisle as the doors opened up and you were about to walk down the aisle?\n\nCD: Listen. I've said it before: I'm a southern gal. We plan our weddings in our heads (and sometimes, on paper) long before we know who will be waiting for us at the end of an aisle. But when those doors opened and I saw my husband, I could not have imagined a more incredible and warm moment. I ONLY saw him -- something I just wasn't expecting! I thought that maybe I'd be acknowledging guests as I walked or taking in the stunningly beautiful ceremony space my wedding planners curated...but no. My eyes really just locked with Chris and that was it. Of course, in true Candiace fashion, I couldn't get through such a pivotal moment in my life without a few tears. Sigh. I'm always crying, guys. But I don't have regrets because I was authentically me and I had a wonderful partner to dab my little tears away waiting for me at the end of the aisle.\n\nBravoTV.com: What did you think of Chris' wedding vows?\n\nCD: Okay! At first, I was like \"what the hell is this man talking about?!?\" But when he quoted \"For You I Will,\" a popular Monica song, I said to myself, \"Wait...what? Is that Mon--...it can't be...\" THEN when he said, \"Can You Stand the Rain\" I was on board and way too tickled for words! ONLY MY husband would come up with something like this! And you know what? I loved every second of it because it's SO Chris to do something like that! lol. He truly ONLY listens to 90's R&B music and has been that way since I've known him. When he's cooking, showering, hyping himself up before he plays a soccer game or just relaxing, his '90s R&B playlist is bumping! So, yes Gizelle! My white man with the brown d*ck is the one! lololol...\n\nBravoTV.com: Your big surprise for Chris took his breath away. Were you nervous to sing for him on your big day?\n\nCD: When I met Chris and I realized that he was the one for me, I knew right then that I wanted to write and perform an original song for him. We have always connected through music. His love for rhythm and blues and the ways in which R&B have shaped and influenced me as a vocalist are some of the most endearing things about our love and our connection to one another. It always only made sense for me to honor and celebrate our love on our wedding day in this very special way. Now, getting the song done was another story. I was in a girl group as a teen and while we did write and record quite a bit, I had not really written a full and complete song in ages. Something I'm kind of embarrassed about is the fact that I also used to write poetry and consider myself to be a bit of a wordsmith. So, the writing part came easy to me. I have a lot of friends in the music industry so I had a lot of support in writing this song. My amazing friends Cliff and Veda who you saw singing background with me were instrumental in helping me get this song done. Veda is such a gifted writer and co-wrote this song with me. Cliff, who was my choir director during my tenure in the Howard Gospel Choir, is someone I trust with every part of my voice and he makes vocal production look easy.\n\nI wasn't nervous, but I was anxious about Chris' response. Would he like the song? Would he appreciate the words and what they meant? Overall, I honestly was not happy with the entire performance. I'm a perfectionist and this was far from perfect. But seeing Chris' face and the way he jumped up on the stage to hug me afterward made every rehearsal worth it. It has completely reignited my love for singing, writing and performing. Stay tuned, there may be a little something in the works from yours truly!\n\nBravoTV.com: What was your favorite part of the entire day?"
