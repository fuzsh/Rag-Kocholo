My main instrument is the alto saxophone, but I can play several different instruments.\n\nTypically, I connect with people on a musical level. Some of my best dates were in care musical battles. 80s R&B Groups, Classic Love Songs, Why Chris Brown might have more hits than Usher, the list is endless when it comes to me.\n\nAnother great musical debate is the best of the best for outstanding female singers from back in the day. You can argue me down about my personal list, but you better come with some facts and figures."
