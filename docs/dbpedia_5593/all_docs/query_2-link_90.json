With so many talented artists producing soulful and emotionally charged music, it can be challenging to keep up with all the new releases. Here are the top ten R&B artists you should be listening to in 2023.\n\n#10. SZA\n\nPhoto Credit: Jacob Webster\n\nIf you’re not tuned into SZA by now; what are you doing? SZA’s music is a blend of R&B and neo-soul, with soulful vocals and honest lyrics. Her debut album, Ctrl, was loved upon release by fans and critics alike. The emotional and honest deliveries within the project are what resonate with people. Her latest project, SOS just reinforced what she set out with her debut, exploring even more sounds (including pop-punk) the album has elevated SZA’s popularity while also keeping her talent and lyrics at the forefront.\n\n#9. Summer Walker\n\nPhoto Credit: Paras Griffin\n\nSummer Walker came into the R&B scene in 2018 with her debut album, Last Day of Summer. Her soulful voice and honest lyrics have made her a fan favorite. Her latest album, Still Over It, is a powerful and emotional journey that showcases her incredible talent.\n\n#8. Brent Faiyaz\n\nPhoto Credit: Kenneth Cappello\n\nBrent Faiyaz’ music is a combination of R&B and hip-hop, with soulful vocals and introspective lyrics. His debut album, Sonder Son, received critical acclaim and showcased his unique sound. His latest project, F*ck the World, is a powerful and emotional album that has cemented his status as one of the top R&B artists of 2023.\n\n#7. KAIRO\n\nPhoto Credit: Ashley Thompson\n\nThis pop and R&B duo of twin brothers are not only extremely talented vocally but their ability to perform live is also quite impressive; I was able to witness them live twice, once at SouthxSouthWest and during their Houston show back in 2022! The lyrics are honest, reflective, and full of life. The music brings a breath of fresh air and happiness that they’ve seemed to master in their newest release Return To Sender.\n\n#6. Chlöe\n\nPhoto Credit: Amy Sussman\n\nChlöe Bailey is a rising star in the music industry. Her music is fresh and innovative, she has a powerful voice that can capture the emotion of any song. Her vocals are soulful, emotional, and full of passion, making her music resonate with listeners on a deep level. Chlöe is not only a talented singer, but her ability to write songs that connect with listeners is a testament to her talent as an artist.\n\n#5. Ari Lennox\n\nPhoto Credit: Gizelle Hernandez\n\nAri Lennox’s soulful voice and honest lyrics have made her a standout artist in the R&B world. Her debut album, Shea Butter Baby, received critical acclaim and since then she’s had my ears glued to everything she’s released. Her newer album Age/Sex/Location (if you know, you know) is no different. Her luscious vocals, sensual lyrics, and features from artists like Chlöe & Summer Walker, just further reinforces that she’s a force to be reckoned with.\n\n#4. Lucky Daye\n\nPhoto Credit: Adrienne Raquel\n\nLucky Daye’s music is a blend of classic soul and contemporary R&B. His smooth vocals and catchy melodies have earned him comparisons to legends like Marvin Gaye and Prince. When Lucky Daye is included on a track you know he’s gonna elevate it with his shea-butter-coated vocals and effortless harmonies.\n\n#3. Jazmine Sullivan\n\nPhoto Credit: Myesha Evon Gardner\n\nJazmine Sullivan (probably the most underrated artist on this list) has been a force in the R&B world for over a decade. Her powerful vocals and relatable lyrics have earned her a loyal following expanding across different generations. Her latest album, Heaux Tales, is a collection of stories about love, sex, and relationships that showcase her incredible range as an artist. Not only are her lyrics vicious but the emotion in her voice alone is enough to earn her this spot.\n\n#2. Giveon\n\nPhoto by David Cabrera\n\nGiveon graced the R&B scene with his powerful voice and heartfelt lyrics. His debut album, Take Time, received critical acclaim and earned him a spot on the Billboard Hot 200. His unique sound combines traditional R&B with modern elements, with his husky voice brings something new to the table; making him a standout artist in the genre.\n\n#1. H.E.R.\n\nPhoto Credit: Michael Nagle\n\nH.E.R. (Having Everything Revealed) is a Grammy-winning artist who has been making waves in the R&B scene since 2016. With her soulful voice and introspective lyrics, she has become a fan favorite. Her latest album, Back of My Mind, showcases her versatility and range as an artist while staying true to the sound that’s garnered her so much success and an equally loyal fanbase.\n\nIn conclusion, R&B music has been thriving in the past and 2023 is no exception. These ten artists are just a small sample of the incredible talent in the genre today. Whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer to R&B, these artists are definitely worth a listen.\n\nWritten by: Jaylan Brooks\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
