        "text": "Being Mary Jane is almost done for the season, and I’m seriously going to miss it! (Luckily Scandal comes back on February 27!) Picking up from last episode, Mary Jane cooks dinner for herself and Andre. However, he comes in the house acting funny, like he has a problem or something. Turns out a friend of his went to the gala, and showed him a picture of his wife, which had MJ dancing with David in the background. That picture turns into a full blown argument! He’s obviously resentful about being away from his kids to be with her, and feels guilty for breaking up their family. MJ wants him to tell his kids the truth! He still feels like she’s lying about David, and walks out. She pushes him, and he gets in his car to drive away. Desperately she tries to get him to stay, but it doesn’t work. A lot of drama to start the episode! In my mind, “love” shouldn’t be that hard and that complicated.\n\nThe next morning, Andre wakes up after sleeping in his car for the night. He comes back to MJ’s house. MJ admits that they can’t unravel their past relationships under the same roof, and thinks he should get his own place. At that moment, Paul Jr. comes knocking at the door, frantically. The cops are looking for him. He went to get his re-up of weed, and the cops were called when a group came to harass his supplier for money. He jumped out the window and ran all the way there. Andre called a friend down at the precinct at that moment, and lets them know that they found PJ’s phone and a backpack with $5000 in it! Needless to say, Mary Jane is pissed! Andre thinks that it’s best that PJ goes back down to the precinct. He should act like he has nothing to hide, though he clearly does.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul questions if Patrick is really going to N.A. They had an agreement that there would be no drugs when he first moved in. Paul lets Patrick know that he is going to test him every week from now on. Patrick then tells him at that moment that he’s moving out. He obviously feels like a kid, and I get that. Paul tells him that if he leaves this time, that’s it. He can’t rescue him anymore. Patrick tells him he needs him to mean it this. I’m not exactly sure what is going to happen to Patrick. He might just be okay, but he needs to work hard at stay off drugs, and I’m not sure if he can do it by himself.\n\nLater, Mary Jane asks Andre if his cop friend can be trusted, and also thanks him for helping PJ. She gives him a key as well, and they make up. As she pulls into work, she gets a call from her mother about Patrick moving out, as well as the fact that Niecy is planning on getting her tubes tied (at 19!!!). On the way in, MJ sees Kara crying in the car, hesitates to go see her, and keeps walking.\n\nAt the police station, Paul Jr. tries to lie his way out of the situation, but Andre’s friend Cedric obviously isn’t falling for it! Andre asks for a favor, and he agrees to let it slide. Cedric asks Andre what is going on with him and Avery. When Andre tells him that there is somebody else, Cedric tells him that it’s not going to work. He also informs him that Andre’s “friend” Marcus took Avery out on a date last night. Andre seems a little thrown off by that, but reiterates that he will be there for his kids. If he’s not, Cedric says, Marcus will be!\n\nAfter the night show, MJ and Kara talk about why Kara was crying. Turns out she and John had another argument, which gets her tearing up again. Because Mary Jane and Kara both vowed not to cry at the workplace, MJ tells her to go and get it together. They’d talk about it later. Meanwhile, after the meeting with Cedric, Paul Jr. is really feeling himself that he got off! He tells Andre that everyone has done a little dirt, and it doesn’t make him a bad person. He even brings up his education and the good he does, but Andre tells him to get a clue. His education doesn’t make him better than anyone, and Andre’s uneducated self is the reason he got out of jail. PJ seems to think that this won’t catch up with him, and he’s stupid for it.\n\nMJ needs a copy of Garcelle magazine to look at David’s girlfriend. She’s a model and is gorgeous!\n\nLater, Kara and John have a sit down with their kids, who John tells to be honest about their feeilings. They think it would be easier to keep a lot of their stuff with their dad, since Kara’s not around as much. It’s clear they have resentment for her not being around. She doesn’t go their school and sports events, which makes them feel bad when they see other kids have their moms. Kara feels like they’ve been coached by John, who wants them to live with them full-time. I actually can’t blame them if they were to live with their dad. I know that Kara loves her job, and it’s clear that a lot goes into that job. As hard as it may be, she might need to really consider this. It’s not about John. It’s about her kids’ happiness, and with her job duties, she’s just not able to do it all. It’s the constant struggle of the working mom. Some can make it work. Others can’t. No judgement at all.\n\nMeanwhile, Andre gets a text from Avery about talking about the divorce with their kids. He plans on going over there the next day. When he gets back to Mary Jane’s, she’s waiting in lingerie and Louboutins. I guess it distracts him for a little bit. Later, MJ has a talk with Paul about his selling, and even offers him $5,000 just to stop. Paul gets mad, and feels like she just throws her money around all the time. The fact of the matter is, MJ is always fixing her family’s problems, and it can get tiring, I’m sure. I couldn’t deal with it. Meanwhile, Andre goes over to his family’s house, but then leaves as he hears Avery having bath time with the kids. I really think he’s starting to miss his family, to be honest.\n\nAt the job the next night, Kara and MJ drink after the show. Kara confesses that John wants primary custody of the kids. She feels like he’s turned the kids against her. Kara is always at work, but she wants this! She hates that she’s hated for it, but admits that John is the better parent, which gets her teary. MJ pulls her into a very well-needed hug.\n\nLater, Lisa checks out David’s new girlfriend, who was in a magazine that Mary Jane picks up. MJ asks about Niecy’s tube tying operation, and if Lisa is actually going to do it. Lisa claims patient-doctor confidentiality, but, overhearing the conversation, Niecy lets her know that she is getting this surgery. MJ tells her that she’s making bad choices, especially with Dante, who’s never around. She also tells Niecy that she’s deluded, living at her grandparents’ house with a kid and another on the way. She needs to get her life together! However, Niecy asks MJ where is her happy ending?! Mary Jane did everything right in her life, and still isn’t completely fulfilled. Niecy tells Mary Jane that it looks like she may be deluding her own self. It hits home. Mary Jane walks in cuddle up with her mother. She knows that Niecy’s right, and confesses that she’s having an affair with a married man. Mama Helen doesn’t judge her, instead telling her that she can cry about it tonight, but she has to make it right in the morning.\n\nThat night, Andre comes in, and MJ tells him to sit down to talk. She loves him, but she can’t be in this relationship anymore MJ didn’t want this life. She doesn’t want to settle. She’s been trying to break this off for the longest, but she couldn’t because of her infatuation with him. At the end of the day, I don’t think either of them were really in love. It was simply infatuation. Right afterwards, they almost have sex, but Mary Jane quickly stops before it can go too far. Good for her!\n\nAs they get ready for bed, Helen asks Paul if he’s having an affair with Kathryn. She feels like she’s possibly not fulfilling his needs because of her lupus. Paul kisses her, obviously still in love, and tells her that he isn’t going anywhere. Meanwhile, Mary Jane and Andre lie in bed, both on the edges away from each other. She tells him that she thinks Avery will take him back. Though he thinks this is about David, she promises it’s not. It’s about her.\n\nThe next morning, Mary Jane watches Andre pack his car with some of his stuff and leave. He later comes back for the rest, and leaves her a note that says “Good luck unraveling,” leaving behind the key. I’m glad that MJ walked away, but, from the preview of the season finale, it looks like she’s going to try to go after David now! Mary Jane really needs to find happiness in herself, before she’ll find someone good for her. She’s not in love with these guys. She’s in love with the idea of being in love.\n\nThe TWO-HOUR season finale of Being Mary Jane airs next Tuesday at a special time, 9 p.m. ET, only on BET!\n\nImage via BET\n\nBeing Mary Jane is almost done for the season, and I’m seriously going to miss it!

Mary Jane really needs to find happiness in herself, before she’ll find someone good for her. She’s not in love with these guys. She’s in love with the idea of being in love.\n\nThe TWO-HOUR season finale of Being Mary Jane airs next Tuesday at a special time, 9 p.m. ET, only on BET!\n\nImage via BET\n\nBeing Mary Jane is almost over for the season, but it’s definitely clear that BET is, or at least should be signing on to do another season! ! Picking up from last episode, Andre finds a new place to stay, though it’s not done. Just as MJ gets ready to undress for them , his real estate agent Leanne brings him the bad news that the place won’t be ready for another month. He needs to a place to stay, and MJ, like the crazy in “love” person she is, offers her house, OF COURSE!\n\nLater, Andre moves in. However, when she sees Mark taking out her trash like he always does, she quickly tells Andre. The next morning, he finds a lot of her post it notes, which he wonders about, but he’s cool with it.\n\nTurns out that Paul didn’t get a platinum table for Helen’s charity tea, which angers Helen since she’s one of the founders. However, because of their current finances, Paul couldn’t make it happen, though Helen brought up the fact that he still plays golf. She feels like she deserves to get out and have a good time after all that she’s been through. She tells him to fix it. Later, Paul tries to switch tables with Katherine. However, she doesn’t want his money, of course. It’s clear she wants something else from him (*side eye*).\n\nAt work, Kara walks in to see MJ. There’s a story about another journalist, Terrence Mitchell, accused of journalistic fraud on a story that launched his career. They both know him, but Kara wants the story…again. MJ doesn’t believe it, though.\n\nLater, Mary Jane gives Andre a copy of Terrence’s prison expose, which he loves. She wonders out loud who she’s going to bring to the gala, with the expectation that Andre can’t go, because, obviously, too many people know that he’s married. They can’t tell anyone about them, or go anywhere. They’re basically in hiding. Andre doesn’t feel like now is the best time to go public, which upsets Mary Jane.\n\nKara soon delivers proof that Terrence (played by Ludacris) is lying. Later, MJ is honest with Terrence five minutes before the interview, saying that his ex-girlfriend Reina has come forward to say that some of his facts have been fabricated. He admitted it to her, and she RECORDED it! When Terrence tells her that he won’t be a part of the story if they use Raina on the show, Mary Jane lets him know that all of his progress from his work has been compromised, and this is breaking news whether her station airs it or not. She’s offering him a voice, but he wants to leave Raina out of this. She uses Raina, and Terrence refuses to come on. Though it was a good show, Mary Jane is literally sick to her stomach afterwards. Again, it’s another matter of getting the story at any means necessary, even at the risk of losing friends.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul is still trying to get this table, by selling stock. However, it looks like Paul, Jr. is busy selling something else! His father later busts him for the money he has in the bank. Paul says that it must be a bank error. His father tells him that he needs to focus and finally graduate, and make something of his life. It’s clear that something else is going on, and it’s sure to come out soon!\n\nMary Jane and her brothers attend the gala with their parents and Lisa. Turns out that David is in attendance as well. Mama Helen calls David over, despite MJ’s pleas. Turns out that Papa Patterson has been advising David on his business ventures, and David even bought his own table. David and MJ chat, though Mary Jane is kind of cold towards him. Mama Helen however, makes a little speech about being grateful to be there, and gives a shout out to David, saying how she hoped one day he would become a part of the family! Mary Jane runs to the bathroom with Lisa. Lisa tells her that she should give David a chance.\n\nAfter she’s out of the restroom, Mary Jane is confronted by a guy who feels that she brought down yet another black man with her story. As she tries to walk away, he grabs her arm. At that moment, David steps up to defend her, and he asks her to dance. Paul asks Katherine to dance as well, which apparently was a part of the deal to get the table for Helen. However, Mama Helen pulls rank and cuts in for a dance with her man! Put that woman in her place!\n\nMJ and David dance, and seem to be having a good time! It turns into a slow dance to “There Goes My Baby.” David mentions how he always loved her perfume, and they almost kiss! However, he wanted to let her know that he’s seeing someone. MJ quickly walks out and goes home. She’s sad, but I think she’s more so upset that she doesn’t have the love she wants. She can’t be out with Andre. Andre senses she’s upset, and goes into the bathroom and tells her that it will be them next year. I feel for Mary Jane. She seemingly has it all, except for the love she wants.\n\nCheck out an all new episode of Being Mary Jane on Tuesday night at 10 p.m. ET only on BET!\n\nBeing Mary Jane is almost over for the season, but it’s definitely clear that BET is, or at least should be signing on to do another season! !

However, it looks like Paul, Jr. is busy selling something else! His father later busts him for the money he has in the bank. Paul says that it must be a bank error. His father tells him that he needs to focus and finally graduate, and make something of his life. It’s clear that something else is going on, and it’s sure to come out soon!\n\nMary Jane and her brothers attend the gala with their parents and Lisa. Turns out that David is in attendance as well. Mama Helen calls David over, despite MJ’s pleas. Turns out that Papa Patterson has been advising David on his business ventures, and David even bought his own table. David and MJ chat, though Mary Jane is kind of cold towards him. Mama Helen however, makes a little speech about being grateful to be there, and gives a shout out to David, saying how she hoped one day he would become a part of the family! Mary Jane runs to the bathroom with Lisa. Lisa tells her that she should give David a chance.\n\nAfter she’s out of the restroom, Mary Jane is confronted by a guy who feels that she brought down yet another black man with her story. As she tries to walk away, he grabs her arm. At that moment, David steps up to defend her, and he asks her to dance. Paul asks Katherine to dance as well, which apparently was a part of the deal to get the table for Helen. However, Mama Helen pulls rank and cuts in for a dance with her man! Put that woman in her place!\n\nMJ and David dance, and seem to be having a good time! It turns into a slow dance to “There Goes My Baby.” David mentions how he always loved her perfume, and they almost kiss! However, he wanted to let her know that he’s seeing someone. MJ quickly walks out and goes home. She’s sad, but I think she’s more so upset that she doesn’t have the love she wants. She can’t be out with Andre. Andre senses she’s upset, and goes into the bathroom and tells her that it will be them next year. I feel for Mary Jane. She seemingly has it all, except for the love she wants.\n\nCheck out an all new episode of Being Mary Jane on Tuesday night at 10 p.m. ET only on BET!\n\nBET didn’t air a new episode of Being Mary Jane last week out of respect for President Obama’s State of the Union. One week gone, and fans were going crazy! Picking up from last episode, Mary Jane is out partying with her girls, and she texts Andre to ask if they’re hooking up later. Meanwhile, Andre is with his family and Avery is loving it, because she believes this is her chance to rekindle their relationship and be a family. After their night out, Kara checks her online dating profile, hungover at MJ’s house. Mary Jane herself has a profile for “research,” and claims to not be looking for anybody. She logs in, and has 12 new messages! Kara messages one for her secretly to try to find her someone (keep in mind, only a few people know that Mary Jane is hanging out with a married man!). Later, MJ messages one of her suitors, though she is still thinking about Andre.\n\nThe next morning, Avery tries oral to “wake” Andre up, though he slept in another bed and sneaked back into theirs. She pulls out a pillow because her neck hurts, which makes Andre laugh instead of turning him on, so mission failed!\n\nAt work, Kara asks about the guy that Mary Jane talked to online, but MJ refuses to tell her. Moments later, Mary Jane gets a call from Nichelle to be a speaker for her Girls’ Inc luncheon, which she agrees to. Kara reveals that she’s still messing with Carlos the intern, and Mary Jane jokingly questions his sexuality! When she accidentally says that Kara should have Mark check him out to make sure, Kara finds out that Mark is gay! Mark hadn’t told anyone other than MJ, so this is sure to be interesting when Mark finds out that Kara knows.\n\nLater, Niecy helps MJ with her dating profile. Mary Jane tries to get some details on what’s going on between Niecy and Dante, but Niecy plays off the conversation. Meanwhile, Helen has lost her diamond bracelet and is hysterical about it. She blames Patrick’s girlfriend Tracy, and wants her out of the house! Later on in the episode, Tracy tries to talk to her, and convince her that she didn’t do it, and never would. Mama Helen is upfront about how she doesn’t feel comfortable with Tracy in the house, and wants her to leave.\n\nThat night, Mary Jane watches one of her segments with Andre about government assistance. They disagree on their stances, but they manage to joke and smile about it. He jokes that she does this thing with her eyebrow, the “Mary Jane serious face.” He starts laughing when she tries to smother him with the pillow, which makes him think of Avery trying to give him oral with the pillow. He tells MJ, and, of course, she gets angry, thinking that they’re not even sharing a bed, let alone being physical. To make him jealous, she tells him that she’s dating.\n\nLater, Kara tries to get Mark to take off his jacket to revamp his look for the show. She wants him to walk and talk to connect with the audience. When he tries it, Kara says his walk is “gay.” Mark’s ears automatically perk up as he questions what she meant, but she tries to play it off. Definitely didn’t work though. Meanwhile, Mary Jane goes to meet her date Sean (played by Wayne Brady) that she met online. It starts off well, but then she starts getting all these texts from everyone, which completely interrupts the date. After a while, he tells her to call him when she’s free. I’m partly mad at that. I know that the show will more than likely swerve in Andre’s favor, but this is a good guy. Kid free, wife free, and he’s a professor! (I get really invested in these characters, sorry!)\n\nThe next day, MJ meets the Atlanta board members for Nichelle’s foundation. Turns out that the top financial donor for the organization just happens to be AVERY! And, of course, they’re sitting at the same table. Very awkward. MJ is going over her speech, while the rest of the ladies chat. Avery reveals that she recently found out that her husband is having an affair and that his mistress told her. Then she shadily asks Mary Jane how she would handle it, and then MJ snaps back that she would probably up her sex game, claiming that that’s the number two reason men cheat. The number one reason is that they have fallen out of love with their wives. Avery dishes a stat of her own, saying that married men almost never leaves their wives, and also proudly says to the table that she and Andre are in couples therapy. That throws Mary Jane for a little loop, but she quickly gets it back during her speech. MJ ditches her planned speech and decides to talk to the girls about how it’s good to be number two in life. That way you can figure out what the number one is missing, and make it work to your advantage! It was a MAJOR read, though a little immature for a girls’ luncheon. No one caught it but Avery obviously, and Avery looked stunned!\n\nLater, Paul asks Patrick to take a drug test, which he takes every month. This time Patrick gets defensive, because he’s back on cocaine. He tells Paul that he doesn’t need to take the test, because he slipped and it’ll come back dirty. Patrick went to a meeting the very next day, and “got straight.” However, he insists that he didn’t take his mother’s bracelet! We find out towards the end that Mama Helen hid the bracelet in the laundry room on purpose to get rid of Tracy. I don’t know what her real beef is with this girl, but I hope it comes out in future episodes!\n\nMeanwhile, Mark comes over to see Mary Jane to ask her about what Kara said. MJ admits that she let his business slip, and, surprisingly, he quickly forgives her. Mary Jane notices that he’s not wearing his signature suit jacket, which Kara got rid of for the show. She tells him that if he’s not comfortable, he shouldn’t do it. Personally, she prefers Mark in a suit jacket, and I do too! I also really love their friendship!\n\nTowards the end of the episode, we see Avery and Andre are in counseling. Avery admits that she’s there because she’s invested so much into this marriage, and believes she has a good man and can make it work. However, they’ve been at this for six months and the therapist notices that Andre doesn’t seem to be committed. He doesn’t know why he’s still there himself. He goes off on Avery about everything that he himself has invested in this marriage. Andre feels like he hasn’t got anything in return, which is what he gets for her “marrying below her pay grade.” Seems like there’s a lot of bitterness there. One thing he also notes is that Avery sees him for who he was, while Mary Jane sees him for who he is now, which is why he flocks to her. At first, I called bull, but I actually understand that. People change.\n\nLater, MJ tries another date with Sean. When her phone starts buzzing, she turns it off and puts it away. Sean opens up about his past marriage, and admits that his ex-wife taught him forgiveness. He asks her what’s the biggest mistake that she’s ever made in a relationship, and she says falling in love with a married man. Though she lies when she tells him that it’s over, Sean gives her a wise piece of advice: there is life after a bad relationship. I think that Mary Jane could be happy in a new relationship, if she tried. However, the heart wants what the heart wants, and right now, she wants Andre.\n\nWhen MJ gets home, Andre is waiting for her. He claims to want her, as he always does, but now he’s tells her that he’s filing for divorce and even told Avery. Of course, that gets MJ happy because he’s never said that before. I don’t know if he’s actually going to go through with it, and, if so, what the aftermath will be. People know both Andre and Mary Jane in town. They know that Andre’s married, so if he goes prancing around with MJ, what will the backlash be? Guess we’ll have to keep watching to find out!\n\nNew episodes of Being Mary Jane air on Tuesday nights at 10 p.m. ET only on BET!\n\nImage via BET\n\nBET didn’t air a new episode of Being Mary Jane last week out of respect for President Obama’s State of the Union.

Picking up from last week, right at the opening of the episode, Mary Jane’s brother Patrick catches her giving Andre oral!!! MJ really needs to get some blinds or curtains, because that glass house tells ALL of her business! Come to find out that Andre used to be a promoter at Patrick’s old club, which is how Patrick knows that he’s married! Mary Jane freaks out, of course. Again, she knows she’s wrong, and her brother just caught her in the act! She brings up the fact that Andre didn’t fix her pool light like he promised, and he jumps right in to screw the light back in. Afterwards, he asks if there’s anything else he can do for her, and he returns her sexual favor! After the implied sex, Mary Jane stares at the ring Andre gave her, but ends up giving it back, saying that she doesn’t want an engagement like this.\n\nThe next day, the family tries to plan Patrick’s birthday. He then comes in being shady, asking for an eight letter word for “unfaithful” for a crossword puzzle, right as Mary Jane is sitting there! That brings up the topic of adultery to the table, which Mama Helen is totally against (I believe her words included “vile” and “stupid!”). Patrick was completely out of line to do that though. MJ asks how much to buy his silence, and he asks for 30 grand. Mary Jane truly believes that Andre loves her, but Patrick tells her that she reminds him of himself as a crack addict. MJ is an addict to Andre. However, Patrick promises to keep his mouth shut about the whole thing.\n\nAt work, Julian pitches a story to Kara about a woman, Samantha Haven, who died three years ago in front of her TV watching Showtime. It was a little unrealistic, because nobody would get away with not paying rent or their cable bill for three years. Plus the smell would have been horrendous! But I digress. The point it she died alone, and nobody missed her. Kara pitches the story to MJ, who isn’t sure, because it’s basically an expose on lonely women. Kara spins it, stating that it’s a universal issue, not just with women, that the world is becoming so disconnected and isolated. Later, after watching some of the footage from the documentary about Samantha, MJ decides to do the story. I think that she partly sees herself. Someone who is successful, but still alone, and she kind of wonders, if she were to die, would anyone miss her?\n\nLater, Patrick speaks with his father about possibly calling off the party. Paul tells him that sometimes celebrations aren’t for you but for others, namely his mom, who seems to be quite happy planning this whole thing. Paul makes it clear to Patrick that he better show up! He does, later on in the show, and his family celebrates him.\n\nThe next day, Kara confronts Mark about why he didn’t show up to their meeting about his show. He was caught up in traffic, apparently. She tells him that if he doesn’t want to do the work to save his show, then just let her know. She’s giving a status report on the show the next day, regardless. If Mark doesn’t put his pride aside, he might just lose his show all together!\n\nMary Jane runs the Samantha Haven story, and asks the question if social media and technology is disconnecting us all from the world. Rev. Jesse Jackson makes a cameo, saying he does partly blame it all for this woman being gone, and no one realizing it. It’s true. We often isolate ourselves and get so wrapped up in social media, that the line between the Internet and real life quickly becomes blurred. I know this as a blogger that it’s easy to become disconnected from the outside world.\n\nAt the station that night, Mark talks about his very first interview that lasted only 23 seconds, but impressed his boss. He worked his way up in this industry over 17 years, and it’s hard for him to change. Kara is honest that his show is boring, and he needs to revamp somehow. Kara also thinks there should be a pop culture segment as well. His work is what kept him here, but these changes need to happen in order for him to stay. Mark decides to give in and work with her.\n\nMary Jane’s friend Cynthia comes through. Cynthia compliments her on the angle of the Samantha Haven story. She also admits she had Greg fire Julian, saying that she thinks it’s important that everyone stays in their own lane. It seems to be a dig at Mary Jane as well. This woman might just be gunning for her to lose her job! Jealously much?!\n\nBack at her house, MJ does an “addiction quiz” and sees that she is 100% addicted. She deletes it, but then frantically calls her provider to get the number back! Definitely an Andre addict! Meanwhile, Patrick has an idea for a “mobile lounge” aka food truck and has a meeting with a former partner at his club. Because Patrick has been out of the business for so long, it’s not looking too great for him. Afterwards, MJ calls Patrick, realizing that she is an addict, though not in the typical form. Patrick drives her to their Aunt Toni’s house, which she is totally against. However, she goes in and has a plate. A little girl calls her little cousins out, claiming that Mary Jane is not really related to them. When MJ states how she is, Kashari Amber Wallace asks why she’s never seen her around? Mary Jane is somewhat taken aback, admitting she doesn’t know. I think she does though. I think she’s been trying to forget certain parts of her life, even with changing her name from Pauletta Washington to Mary Jane Paul. She’s somewhat embarrassed of her family, even if she doesn’t directly say so.\n\nAfterwards, Mary Jane doesn’t want to go home just yet. Patrick drives her to his old club. Patrick tells her upfront that she needs to leave Andre alone, but she’s already “in love” with him. Patrick admits that he himself was addicted to being the king of Atlanta with his club, and cocaine became a part of that. He stresses that Andre is not worth it, and she can do better. Patrick tells Mary Jane that he is working towards a new opportunity, and MJ pledges her support. All he asks is that if she feels herself slipping that she will call him, and not Andre.\n\nBack at the house, Patrick doesn’t have a key so his father has to let him in, though it’s 2 in the morning! He looks around at his present situation, and pulls out some cocaine. Meanwhile, Mary Jane ends up having Andre over again. Looks like they both relapsed. Addiction is a serious thing.\n\nWatching this show, I think a lot of us can be quick to judge, myself included. “She’s messing with a MARRIED man! Who does that? She knows she’s wrong.” I don’t agree, but, if it’s one thing I remembered tonight, is that many of us, if not all, have or have had an addiction somewhere along the way. Whether it be drugs, alcohol, a significant other, whoever. I don’t condone MJ’s behavior at all, or anybody else that would mess with someone married, but I got my own glass house (mine just happens to have really thick curtains!), so who I am to judge anyone else on anything? I hope that throughout the rest of the series, we will see Mary Jane grow and become stronger, and get rid of Andre. Hopefully she finds somebody good for her. I really want that for her!\n\nBe sure to watch new episodes of Being Mary Jane on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EST on BET!\n\nImage via BET\n\nAnother good episode of Being Mary Jane last night!

The two hour pilot that we saw back in July introduced Mary Jane as a broadcast journalist, who struggles with men, family and friends. The series has been picked up for a short season of eight episodes, and has already been picked up for a second (hopefully with more episodes)!\n\nTo start last night’s premiere, we see Mary Jane running frantically to her friend Lisa’s house (Lisa was seen as a doctor last season) and breaking in. Turns out that Lisa has taken a lot of pills, and is out of it on her bed. MJ quickly gets her up and helps to revive her. She stays the night with her friend, and even cooks for her the next morning. Lisa is clearly struggling with something, though we don’t know what just yet. The next morning, the two talk, and Lisa promises that she will call Mary Jane before ever doing something like that again.\n\nMary Jane heads back to the arms of her lover David at home. At that moment, Andre (who MJ had an\n\naffair with, until she found out he was MARRIED!) pops up at the gate. When David goes to find out what he’s doing, Andre claims to have pulled over to send a text, though he was definitely trying to get in! Mary Jane watches sneakily through the window, but acts like nothing at all is wrong when David comes back in. He then invites her to a concert, which she happily accepts.\n\nGoing into the office, Mary Jane stops to get coffee for her and her friend/producer Kara. Kara calls her and informs her that a co-worker has been fired, and that she needs to get into the office ASAP! At that moment, Andre shows up at MJ’s car (can we say stalker?!!), wanting to talk. MJ tells him off again, saying that he is married and needs to get away from her, and speeds away.\n\nChanges are happening at Mary Jane’s station, and her supervisor Gary plans to have individual meetings to discuss who is best for the network. After the meeting, Kara tells MJ that she should cover a hurricane in Florida. Like most black women would, Mary Jane refuses because of her hair (and the fact that no one really wants to be in the middle of a hurricane!) and suggests a local girl to go down there. Back at her office, MJ gets word that a fan wants to meet her. Turns out that the “fan” is Avery Daniels, Andre’s wife, whom Mary Jane told about the affair, though MJ had no idea she was married! Avery is really bold, pulling out phone records of Andre calling MJ, and drilling her about their affair, if they’ve talked about a future, and if he loves her! Andre told her that he loved her once, but it probably wasn’t true. Avery walks out, seemingly with a sense of satisfaction, feeling like MJ will never actually be with her husband.\n\nIn the middle of the broadcast on Hurricane Kenny, Kara’s kids come to see her along with her ex-husband, waiting for her to attend the oldest son’s recital. However, both Kara and Mary Jane are asked to stay to cover the hurricane. Kara has to disappoint her kids, and MJ has to break her plans with David. It’s the life of working women all over the country, especially those with significant others and children. Sometimes you have to choose between your work and your personal life, and it sucks.\n\nDuring the broadcast, Lindsay tries to come home because it’s getting really bad down there, but Kara wants her to stay and get the story! Lindsay leaves the camera with a couple who is staying to ride out the hurricane, and Kara keeps rolling with them on the air for the ratings, and a possible award! Suddenly the camera goes black, implying that something bad might have happened to the couple. Mary Jane explodes on Kara, knowing that Kara used them for ratings. It doesn’t work out bad for Kara, though. Afterwards, Gary asks Kara to consider consulting on another show, which she agrees to. It’s crazy, though. Kara clearly had no conscience about using that couple the way she did. It’s an issue that many companies, and the media especially (even myself), deal with all the time–ethics versus numbers. Would you rather stand by your standards, or push them aside to get more money, better ratings, or a few more clicks? It’s a deliberate choice.\n\nAfter the blowup, MJ calls David, who is driving to meet someone else. She hangs up angrily, but then calls him back and drills him about what’s going on with the other girl. David then calls her out about Andre, but she denies sleeping with him. Since she couldn’t go to the concert, he is meeting up with someone else. They aren’t together, and David really doesn’t owe her an explanation. He was honest with her about what he wanted at that point, and Mary Jane clearly wasn’t ready. Most of us have been there. That’s why I can’t do the friends with benefits thing. Emotions get involved, even if you claim they won’t.\n\nMary Jane’s night seems to go on as usual, but it’s clear she has a lot on her mind. She runs on the treadmill, but eventually gets off. Andre is also there (STALKER!!!) and follows that girl in the shower to talk! MJ demands the password to her phone which is her address (SERIOUSLY?! I know he just changed that for that moment!). She unlocks it, sees a picture of the man’s family, and breaks down into tears. However, with Andre’s slick talk, he gets her to have sex with her right then, right there! Again, it’s a situation that many have dealt with, not necessarily with a married man, but being involved with someone you know you have no business being with! Mary Jane knows better, but it’s hard to walk away sometimes.\n\nWhat did you think of last night’s premiere of Being Mary Jane? Will you be watching this season?\n\nImages via BET"
