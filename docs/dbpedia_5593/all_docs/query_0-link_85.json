The first time I went with a friend and knew that I had to return; the second time I went alone, to study the fifth-floor retrospective of her work; and finally I went back very briefly near the end of her atrium performance, part superstitiously and part protectively, to check that she was still all there. Her performance—and the entire exhibit—was intended to provoke strong reactions. In a piece for the New York Times, Arthur Danto described the experience of sitting with Abramović as akin to witnessing a shamanistic trance. Danto, who has sat across from Abramović in more sociable environments, was quick to mention her wit and her charming “kind of Balkan humor” outside of the performance space. But more striking is his rhetorical leap from Abramović’s fairly abstract, conceptual piece of performance art to his own connections with socialist Yugoslav history. He writes: I had put three months into the catalog essay for the MoMA show, reading about her performances and about her life. I had spent some time in Yugoslavia in the 1970s teaching philosophical seminars as a Fulbright professor at the Inter-University Center of Postgraduate Studies in Dubrovnik. It was around then that Marina was doing her first performances in Belgrade. I recalled that, years before she was born, I had, as a young soldier in Italy, sailed one dark night to the Dalmatian coast with some partisans\n\n2 Introduction\n\nI had fallen in with, to bring some of their wounded comrades back to Bari for treatment. One’s experience of art draws on one’s total experience in life.1\n\nI am struck by Danto’s sudden reference to World War II because this mental backsliding mirrors my own. Our reactions are justified by the intellectual content of Abramović’s work: the child of two partisan war heroes, Abramović has played with Yugoslav World War II iconography throughout her oeuvre, from the flaming five-pointed communist star that nearly killed her in the 1974 performance Rhythm 5, to the white horseand-flag tribute to her father in The Hero (2001). But for me, the stronger personal association has to do with the particular physicality of Abramović’s art, and with the wounded female body. I too was raised in the cult and culture of World War II heroism, and my grandmothers, both partisans, were fairly spectacularly riddled with lead: one had been machine-gunned through the knees, and the other carried a rifle bullet lodged near her ninety-something shoulder until the very end, May 2012. I had some very odd ideas about the female body as a child: the bodies I knew best were scarred but evidently unstoppable by bullets, and seemed made from a different substance than fragile men. Theirs are the older, scarred figures that I continue to see, glimmering indistinctly behind Abramović’s body of work. But what I have just described is only one of so many possible memories, intellectual approaches, and rhetorical roads leading into the lingering ghostly outlines of the former Yugoslavia. Twenty years after disintegration, all of the contributors to After Yugoslavia: The Cultural Spaces of a Vanished Land find themselves looking back to move forward. They are united here in an unprecedented attempt to address and reshape the effects of what Andrea Zlatar-Violić, quoting the French phenomenologist Paul Ricoeur, calls “too much memory in one place, too much forgetting in the other.” The overwhelming majority of the contributing authors (I believe, all but two) has lived in, however briefly, and draws roots from the former Yugoslavia. Sixteen contribute scholarly articles; three offer personal essays; and on occasion the distinctions prove porous. For one of the central binaries interrogated throughout this volume is that of individual versus collective memory. What of this post-Yugoslavia is mine alone, and what is ours? And, perhaps as fundamental as the same question posed in the firstperson singular, who are/were we? How do we reconcile, or comprehend contradicting memories and national narratives? How is post-Yugoslav\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nc­ ollective memory, or rather memories, being shaped by contemporary culture and external influences? Who would we like to become? H ­ yphenated diaspora? Europeans? The burning question of all the chapters in this collection remains: how do we make sense of the diverse, yet clearly interconnected post-­ Yugoslav cultural spaces? What combination of admittedly contradictory tools and methodologies will shed genuine light on the story of the Western Balkans, Central Europe, Southeast Europe, the former Yugoslavia, or any of these transitional spaces with contested names? The attempts offered here range from the meditative personal history, to historical inquiry, to linguistic research, to theoretically charged interventions, and even to close readings that bracket recent political history in pursuit of other categories of knowledge. In place of a dominant metanarrative, the contributors to After Yugoslavia attempt a polylogue, a multiplicity of communicating voices. However, certain names and terms recur with frequency, suggesting some common ground and shared assumptions underlying the discussion. Unsurprisingly, a recurring motif involves the mapping of cultural capital. Pascale Casanova offers one model: following in the footsteps of French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, she imagines a combative “world republic of letters,” where national canons compete for prestige and cultural capital. She writes of literary frontiers “independent of political boundaries, dividing up a world that is secret and yet perceptible by all (especially its most dispossessed members); . . . a world that has its own capital, its own provinces and borders, in which languages become instruments of power.”2 Franco Moretti’s Atlas of the European Novel and Dudley Andrew’s “Atlas of World Cinema” serve comparable purposes.3 Clearly there are centers and peripheries when it comes to the distribution of cultural capital, and evidently the experience of marginality or marginalization (Dubravka Ugrešić calls it provincialization) is painfully relevant to the post-Yugoslav cultural experience. Likewise, hardly a single article fails to mention Sigmund Freud or to use Freudian terminology, whether quoting his famous phrase on the “narcissism of minor differences,” often applied to intra-Balkan tensions, or borrowing more general notions such as trauma, melancholy, repetition compulsion, and the return of the repressed. This language appears unavoidable in descriptions of literature and film after the wars of secession; moreover, the “return of the Yugoslav repressed” emerges as one of the crucial concepts of the book. Sometimes the revenant-repressed is what lurked below the forced-idyll of the former Yugoslavia and brought about\n\n4 Introduction\n\nits ruin; and sometimes it resembles the borders of the country that no longer exists but that all of the contributors to this volume can redraw by heart. In either case the “living dead,” as in Maria Todorova’s essay, will return to haunt you. There are many other telling areas of overlap, as I will discuss below in more depth. George Steiner’s After Babel informs or complicates arguments over translation and language identity. Mikhail Bakhtin’s works on heteroglossia and polyphony provide a link between the experiences of reading texts on the page and encountering the cultural texts of marginal, border spaces. The Bakhtinian notion of the “carnivalesque” is used with more ambivalence to describe literary and film industries prone to self-exoticism, or as Tomislav Longinović has put it, “self-Balkanization.” Finally, the Frankfurt school and its heirs provide the infrastructure to ­cultural-studies approaches: the words of Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Fredric Jameson, and Walter Benjamin are coded into recurring critiques of the “free market” and of globalization as the new colonialism. This volume of essays about a region that “dare not speak its name,” aims both to report and to build on shared culture. The pieces repeat the experience of so many individuals and communities: the human mind cannot but quest for models to explain, rationalize, simplify, or conceptualize what are potentially infinitely complex phenomena. Several of our authors also number among the more pertinent writers contributing to these new or revised literary traditions. But direct involvement by no means cancels out the need for continual sense-making—through memoirs, scholarly articles, literary works, or films. All of these are efforts to “map” Yugoslavia, its wars, and its cultures in transition. It remains to ask the naïve-sounding question: to what exactly are these nations transitioning? Presumably, to membership in the European Union, but in 2011 the writers collected in this anthology express far more skepticism toward this new idyll than unproblematic unionism. Part of their reserve comes from bitter experience: we have already tried brotherhood and unity, cry the insulted and the injured. Europe might do well to skip the condescension and instead take a long hard look at the rise and fall of the South Slavic confederation: the EU has lessons to learn from YU. Finally, for all the “progress” of transitioning to democracy and capitalism from socialism, presumably inevitable after the fall of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union, the free market does not seem so free to scholars of post-Yugoslav culture. The five chapters included in the part on\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nnational literatures after 1991, as well as the pieces on cinema and on the history of a “common culture,” all speak with varying degrees of pessimism about print runs for fiction of no more than five hundred copies, the drastic decline of cinemas, and the failure of local products to compete with translated international bestsellers. The argument is familiar but remains troubling; as Tatjana Rosić puts it, cheesecake always wins over homemade local pastries. The idea for this volume came from the conference “Ex Uno Plures: Post-Yugoslav Cultural Spaces and Europe,” organized by Radmila Gorup at Columbia University in March 2010. The event itself was a lesson in poly­phony, bringing together specialists from the regional cultural capitals, academics from the diaspora, and Western Slavists and regional studies scholars. Despite the phrase “and Europe” in the title, New York was the physical space mediating the conference, and stands in metonymically for the largely American academic culture that continues to “mediate” in this volume, conceived, compiled, and intended for publication in the United States. Several of the pieces nod to this other cultural presence, whether as further evidence of trends that they describe, or to suggest alternative transnational communities. This anthology emerged as an attempt to reflect that complexity, to encourage the counterpoint of multiple perspectives, and to avoid the semantic violence of one totalizing master narrative. Narratives and stances certainly do emerge, but one hopes that they do so out of a creative and collaborative “struggle for mutual freedom”—to conclude somewhat archly with a phrase that Stanley Cavell has used to describe the relations between men and women.\n\nAn Overview After Yugoslavia opens with “My Yugoslavia: Personal Essays,” two short chapters by Maria Todorova and Vesna Goldsworthy. The volume closes in the same vein, with a personal essay by Dubravka Ugrešić, bringing together three remarkable writers never before published under the same cover. Addressing the tension between individual and collective memory, these framing essays foreground personal, subjective experiences of the region, moving east to west from the Balkans to the republic of “­Kakania,” counter to the flow of the Danube. Todorova, best known for her work on Balkan Orientalism in Imagining the Balkans (1997), offers “My Yugoslavia,” the keynote address at the\n\n6 Introduction\n\n2010 Ex Uno Plures conference. Todorova remembers Yugoslavia from the perspective of an initially disinterested neighbor: “In my Balkan map,” she writes, “Turkey was western (because of a handful of fascinating intellectuals), and Yugoslavia was eastern.” She traces the rise of regional comparativist studies, such as the 1934 founding of the Balkan Institute in Belgrade, in the then Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The institute’s first “Balkanological” manifesto identified “two immanent trends—unification and particularism,” that determined the historical evolution of the region. Today and in the wake of disintegration, Todorova suggests an approach based on the study of legacy. The region abounds with legacies: from the long shadows of the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires emerges what Todorova calls the 1990s “continued unmixings,” the last throes “on the road to homogenized Europeanization.” Likewise Yugo-nostalgia is but a peculiar subgenre of the postcommunist nostalgia stretching from Europe to Central Asia, China, and beyond. For one or two generations and diasporic communities, Yugoslavia will survive in memory like the “living dead.” In “Yugoslavia: A Defeated Argument?” Goldsworthy brings old documents and artifacts to ekphrastic life: her album, postcards, passport, and identity card. She speaks of the return of the Yugoslav repressed: “The familiar shape of the Socialist Federal Republic remains visible on maps of Europe, in the way that old outlines bleed through layers of new paint.” An alternative space/time, the Yugoslav chronotope includes an entire ghostly calendar of nonholidays. Goldsworthy calls herself “much better versed in writing about the idyll” of Tito’s Yugoslavia, although her firsthand memories have been partly supplanted by the violent “newsreel” Yugoslavia of the 1990s mediascapes. Admitting freely to her own possessive nostalgia, Goldsworthy notes the irritation we feel at others’ memories, which always seem to falsify our own. Western academic industries with “professional Serbs, Croats, Albanians, or Yugoslavs” provoke extra suspicion, for “such experts love their subject fervently if only to kill it for most other people.” Finally, Goldsworthy turns to the dimmed appeal of the European Union, whose byzantine bureaucracy looks suspiciously familiar to post-Yugoslavs: both “confederations” derive from the afterlife of Austria-Hungary. Perhaps more positive cultural continuity will take place online, or in the works of transnational writers like Aleksandar Hemon and Téa Obreht. The second part, “Histories and Common Culture,” includes chapters by Dejan Djokić, Zoran Milutinović, and Vladimir Zorić. In “The Past as Future: Post-Yugoslav Space in the Early Twenty-First Century,”\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nDjokić attempts a concise overview of Yugoslav history, and a rebuttal of the nationalist “para-histories” of the 1990s. Opening with Stojan Novaković’s futuristic 1911 essay, “After One Hundred Years,” Djokić charts the rise and perhaps temporary fall of the Yugoslav idea, which preceded Tito’s Yugoslavia by one hundred years. Djokić compares Yugoslav nation building and language standardization to those of Germany and Italy, and finds Yugoslavia to have been something between a nation-state, with 80 percent of the population South Slavs, and a multinational state with a complex counterpoint of individual nationalisms. Ultimately the collapse of the Party and of international relevance spelled doom for socialist Yugoslavia—but why was disintegration so incomprehensibly violent? There is still no good, book-length study of the Wars of Yugoslav Secession, Djokić notes. He ends with the warning that “Europe should closely watch,” for the attempt “to build a viable multinational state in the twentieth century, and their ultimate failure, could provide valuable lessons for the EU project,” and with a nod to Tim Judah’s concept of a “Yugosphere.” Paradoxically, some form of “Yugoslavism” might continue to flourish outside of the confines of a common state. Milutinović picks up from there with “What Common Yugoslav Culture Was, and How Everybody Benefited from It.” Warning that a clear picture cannot emerge from nationalist, anticommunist agendas or from Yugo-nostalgia, he calls for a rational assessment of the benefits of a common South Slavic culture. He agrees with Pascale Casanova that “minor” cultures are poor in resources, and posits that, unlike the Hapsburg or ­Ottoman empires, Yugoslavia managed to create a successful supraculture in only seventy years. The Slovene Bartholomus Jernej Kopitar, the Serb Vuk Karadžić, and the Croat Ljudevit Gaj once dreamed of a common “Illyrian” culture; at the turn of the twentieth century, “many ‘Illyrians’ felt at home everywhere between Austria and Bulgaria, and treated it as a single cultural space.” From partisan films to Ljubiša Ristić’s KPGT theater troupe,4 Milutinović runs through a list of “self-consciously supranational” Yugoslav phenomena. A shared culture was fostered through state funding, mandatory education, and translations—for culture mattered in socialist Yugoslavia. Where, he asks, are the great writers and artists today? The European Union makes no comparable effort to protect small languages and cultures: ironically, only Slavoj Žižek survives in the free market. The Yugosphere can only ever be the “pale shadow” of a once-vibrant Yugoslav culture. Milutinović demands how it is possible for a people to lose so much,\n\n8 Introduction\n\nto gain so little, and yet to look forward to voluntary colonization and disenfranchisement reminiscent of that under the Austro-Hungarian empire. Zorić in turn interrogates the once powerful Central European model in “Discordia Concors: Central Europe in Post-Yugoslav Discourses.” This semiotic concept and imagined space was born of Milan Kundera’s 1986 essay “The Tragedy of Central Europe,” which cast Soviets as “an anti-­European totalitarian force which captured the geographical center of the continent.” More appealing was Danilo Kiš’s “Variations on Central European Themes,” which proposed a utopian republic without center or borders. Zorić analyzes the works of Dragan Velikić, László Végel, and Drago Jančar, writers who treat Kiš as a spiritual guide. Velikić calls Serbia a temporally frozen “country on the other side of the mirror,” and maps Central Europe by tracing the Danube River upstream to the West. Végel, a Vojvodina Hungarian playwright, casts the region as a Bakhtinian hybrid cultural space: “The great paradigm of Central-Eastern Europe is precisely this feeling of periphery, a traumatic meeting of cultures . . . and despite all that, an extremely volatile space of hope.” Jančar focuses on the Slovenians: a Euro-skeptic, he fears that Slovenia has lost what it so recently gained, and that EU accession will “redraw the map of Europe and, for the first time, consign Slovenia to the East.” Zorić suggests Trieste, a city that even James Joyce called home, as a hybrid border-city and ideal Central European capital. Zorić joins his authors in mapping Central Europe as a literary “versatile trope of pluralistic space,” a metaphor rather than a political union. Looked at as a group, these chapters map out a territory similar to the personal essays that open and close the volume, drifting west from Yugo­slavia to Central Europe. Djokić suggests that Yugoslav culture will not entirely vanish; Milutinović argues that it will and that this is a tragedy; and Zorić interrogates Central Europe as an alternative utopia. All three texts are fascinated with shared culture, cultures in dialogue, and cultures as dialogic; all turn with interest to marginal, borderline, or virtual spaces such as the Yugosphere. Zorić’s study offers fascinating parallels to the final essay by Ugrešić, examining the Central European alternative as a republic of letters. The Danube River runs through the literature, suggesting continuity and flow in both space and time, a powerful image of the cultural/phenomenological experience of Central Europe.5 The third part, “Legacies of Yugoslavia: Cultural Returns,” is comprised of chapters by Mitja Velikonja, Gordana P. Crnković, and Marijeta Božović, focusing on what cultural traces remain or rise again in the post-\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nYugoslav spaces. All three texts step back in time in order to move forward. Not coincidentally, all three chapters deal with culture more broadly: Yugo-music, posters, journals and avant-garde design, or the film career of Rade Šerbedžija. Nonliterary arts, or projects that include other media as well as language, have an easier time crossing and blurring borders. These chapters turn to the Frankfurt school and Western Marxist thinkers for the tools to explore leftist subversions of capitalist/neocapitalist culture. Crnković finds a great local inspiration in Krleža, the “Croatian Sartre,” and Božović in the journal Zenit, an attempt to spark an internationally relevant Balkan avant-garde. Both chapters wonder at these radical subversions of Yugoslavia before state socialism, and at their lessons for transitional spaces in a globalized world. In “‘Something Has Survived . . .’: Ambivalence in the Discourse About Socialist Yugoslavia in Present-Day Slovenia,” Velikonja takes inspiration from a 2009 billboard advertising a popular radio station with the silhouette of Yugoslavia and the promise to play more “yugo” music than other stations. The silhouette is seductive; exotic “Balkan parties” are already popular with the Slovenians. Velikonja critiques the new “EUrocentrism” and Balkanophobia, and analyzes the 2003 film Kajmak i marmelada (Cheese and Jam, in the unfortunate English translation) as typical of dominant national discourses. The pretty blonde Slovenian heroine leaves her criminally macho Bosnian boyfriend: they tried, but they are just “too different”—the message is clear. And yet, iconic images borrowed from socialist Yugoslavia serve as inspiration to diverse “anti-establishment leftist groups like alterglobalists, pacifists, punks, anarchists, left-oriented students, and others who are fighting for a more just world.” A 2009 survey showed Slovenians more likely to identify terms like welfare, justice, and freedom with socialism than with capitalism. Velikonja notes that even the current Slovenian ruling elite were once members of the League of Communists, a past that haunts them in the “typical Freudian situation.” The old times are subversive, inspire love and hate, selective amnesia or selective nostalgia. But as we know, nostalgia always longs for a lost time more than for a lost space: a true return is impossible. Crnković structures her “Vibrant Commonalities and the Yugoslav Legacy” in two parts: first she looks to Yugoslav and post-Yugoslav film industries for examples of an enduring common culture. Despite the efforts of the dominant political establishments, she argues that “works of art shape the fluidity of space and time.” Individuals transcend n ­ ational\n\n10 Introduction\n\nborders: the paradigmatic Rade Šerbedžija is one such voice for reason and unity, initially as a member of the KPGT theater group and now quietly reuniting Yugoslavia through his numerous local and Western films. Filmmakers still rely on collaborations across post-Yugoslav spaces. Crnković turns to the same film as Velikonja, Kajmak i marmelada, as an example of continued collaboration: the Slovenian film is written, directed by, and stars the Bosnian Branko Đurić. Crnković then moves back in time to Miroslav Krleža: she echoes Ugrešić that the rest of ­Croatian literature should be a footnote to Krleža, whose great interwar texts were “not about a socialist society, but about a capitalist one of control.” Imitating Europe blindly never ends well. She finds hope in recent publications and reprinted works, for reappropriating Krleža “may show a way of reactivating and revitalizing other vibrant commonalities.” In one moving quote, Krleža defines socialism simply as “the fight against earthly evils by earthly means.” Meanwhile, recent Bosnian films betray profound anxieties over the new “rational ways of doing business,” an automatized drive for profit that finds its logical conclusion in the drug trade and trafficking in women. “Zenit Rising: Return to a Balkan Avant-Garde” follows a similar logic but in reverse order. I begin with the recent revival of interest in Zenit, an interwar journal centered around a core group of Serbs but originally printed in Zagreb, in two alphabets and usually at least five languages, including Esperanto as well as the “language” of images and visual design. The ambitious if tiny group aimed to reverse the fall of Babel, and consciously strove to evolve a radical, collective, and ephemeral new form of art. This Balkan avant-garde drew on Russian and German models, but sought to turn its double marginalization into an advantage. The Zenit circle, with Ljubomir Micić serving as the André Breton of the group, invented a new hero in the Balkan Barbarogenius, a near relative of Aleksandr Blok’s Scythian and Nietzsche’s übermensch. I study this movement in relation to other European avant-gardes, and to theoretical writing on the possibilities of new media and of new incarnations of print culture from the interwar period. This deeply self-conscious avant-garde practice evolved radical notions of “marginal art,” anticipating debates in the Frankfurt school and ongoing today. Finally, I suggest that the ideas of Zenit move beyond the historical avant-garde, and interrogate the paradoxical idea of an avantgarde tradition (as Marjorie Perloff has suggested of Anglo-American poetry). I end with the suggestion that the most internationally renowned\n\nIntroduction 11\n\navant-garde practice stemming from the Balkans today, the performance art of Marina Abramović, is perhaps the true heir to little Zenit. The fourth part, “The Story of a Language,” consists of chapters by Tomislav Longinović and by the linguists Ranko Bugarski and Milorad Pupovac. All three question the demise of Serbo-Croatian, which may well prove to have a life beyond the grave. These chapters consider questions of translation, intelligibility, and the complex interpenetration of language and identity. George Steiner’s broad-ranging study After Babel: Aspects of Language and Translation (1975) considers all human communication to be a form of translation, and the extreme plurality of human languages to stem from a desire for difference. Steiner famously interrogates the myth of Babel, common to so many languages: one might conclude that there can be—and in some sense, are—as many languages as there are models for mapping human experience. But Longinović, Bugarski, and Pupovac look closely at one particular and politicized mini-Babel, striving to understand why only certain Romantic efforts at language-standardization and nation building took root and became autoregulating (e.g., Germany, Italy). Longinović analyzes the fate of Serbo-Croatian in “Post-Yugoslav Emergence and the Creation of Difference,” merging his own experience as “a person trying to come to terms with the linguistic divisions imposed as a result of Yugoslavia’s violent dismemberment” with his “scholarly interest in understanding translation as a cultural practice promoting communication and understanding.” He begins with the surreal screening of the Serbian film Wounds (Rane, 1998) with added Croatian subtitles in Zagreb after the end of the war. The “translation” was nearly identical to the original, with occasional attempts to find synonymous alternatives. The already comical situation provoked audience hysteria when it came down to the “shared arsenal of obscenities.” What is less humorous is that translation, supposedly a bridge between cultures, became a tool to enforce difference. Longinović recalls the collaborative efforts of Vuk and Gaj in the nineteenth century, and argues that the failure of Yugoslavia marks the end of “the Romantic notion of the nation-state, imagined as a territory based on common linguistic heritage and a shared folklore,” to be replaced with “historically residual cultural formation based on religious affiliation and identification with the former imperial master.” Invoking Freud’s “narcissism of minor differences,” Longinović critiques the Orientalization of Serbs “as genocidal guslars.” He ends by predicting the “soft return of the hyphen in SerboCroatian,” should cultural bonds prove stronger than political agendas.\n\n12 Introduction\n\nBugarski asks “What Happened to Serbo-Croatian?” and offers several valid but mutually contradictory answers. Linguistically, he writes, not much has happened and Serbo-Croatian is alive and well. Politically, very much has happened: the language no longer exists. Finally, “something” has happened, referring to the psychological experiences of the speakers. Outlining the history of the language, he finds that the compound term was first put into use as early as 1824 by foreign scholars. He too recalls the Pan-Slavic Illyrian movement led by Ljudevit Gaj and Vuk Karadžić: from the vantage point of 2010, the term Serbo-Croatian has been around for 186 years, the idea of a common literary language for 160 years, and the standard language of that name was “codified about 110 years ago.” Despite the shift in politics, Bugarski concludes that there is “no inherent necessity” for the language to simply disappear with the end of Yugoslavia. He runs through the various extreme claims that have been put forward about the language/languages, and argues that linguistic considerations should take precedence over political or psychological reactions on the part of speakers. As a “native speaker of a dead language,” he notices the growing use of ambiguous but telling terms such as our language and the region more or less coinciding with Serbo-Croatian and the territory of the former Yugoslavia. In “Language Imprisoned by Identities; or, Why Language Should Be Defended,” Pupovac uses the term identitization to describe the process by which language is used primarily as a vehicle for the standardization of identity. Language should be defended both from itself and from us, Pupovac claims. He compares identitized language with secret languages and the metalanguage of researchers and specialists: none of these languages are dialogical, whereas in practice “languages survive because they meet and combine with each other,” just as do individual identities. ­Pupovac traces the “vernacular revolution” of the European languages and the foundations for modern linguistics put forward by Herder, von Humboldt, and others. He finds a particularly rich history of research into the language and folklores of the South Slavs, and contrasts such cumulative efforts with language policies in the 1990s that erased history and meaning through the forceful elimination of synonyms and “foreign” vocabulary. Through a “lack of continuity in language policy,” the language/languages of the region failed to arrive at the stage of autoregulation. Pupovac is especially critical of the recently standardized Montenegrin, with its insistence on a language layer that “belongs to all autochthonous Montenegrin citizens” and on minute differences such as the phonemes ś and ź. For a\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nwelcome and practical alternative, Pupovac offers a traditional recipe for stuffed turkey from a Bosnian cookbook, a text “polyphonic through and through,” which combines regional synonyms, substandard usages, neologisms, and calques—all with the goal of maximum communication with the greatest number. The fifth part, “Post–Film,” consists of two chapters. As the most internationally accessible cultural medium, Yugoslav and post-Yugoslav film has consistently met with the most, and often most favorable, critical coverage.6 On the one hand, Balkan film often stands apart from literature and other forms of art in the public eye. On the other hand, as evidenced already in this book, no larger discussion of post-Yugoslav culture would be complete without an overview of recent films, recontextualized by the discussions of other media that earlier articles have aimed to provide. Andrew Horton and Meta Mazaj provide two very different overviews in a section that in its own way encapsulates many of the recurring motifs of Ex Uno Plures. In “The Vibrant Cinemas in the Post-Yugoslav Space,” Horton agrees with Crnković that newly international collaborations are alive and well. Despite market pressures, “the drastic decline of cinemas everywhere,” and the “rise in video/DVD viewing, partly on illegal bootleg copies,” film industries appear to be coping. “Until the very end of its existence,” he writes, “Yugoslavia often had four or five films in the top ten [list at the box office], a phenomenon that continues today in Serbia and some of the other former Yugoslav republics.” He grimly lists the local predicaments: “high unemployment, often over 50 percent; the continuous departure of young people to other countries; lack of political security; and a huge illegal trade of goods, drugs, and women, often controlled by local ‘mafia.’” The movies reflect this reality, as well as the imperative to make sense of life after war—which gives contemporary projects an odd sense of continuity with the very first local industry of partisan films. Horton revisits the FAMU group of the 1960s and 1970s (Rajko Grlić, Goran Paskaljević, Emir Kusturica), then turns to a younger generation. Arsen Anton Ostojić’s A Wonderful Night in Split (Ta divna splitska noć, 2003) and Srđan Vuletić’s Summer in the Golden Valley (Ljeto u zlatnoj dolini, 2003) echo with familiar themes: trafficking in women, drug wars and crime culture, the neonoir of a lost generation. He closes with the somewhat more life-affirming or at least self-ironizing comedies, and Miroslav Momčilović’s Seven and a Half (Sedam i po, 2006). In the finale, which sounds suspiciously like the\n\n14 Introduction\n\nSoviet musical comedy The Circus (Tsirk, 1936), a multi-ethnic cast of characters sings a lullaby to a newborn Bosnian baby in a Belgrade hospital. If Horton reflects the most prevalent themes in post-Yugoslav cinema, Meta Mazaj stages an intervention with “Marking the Trail: Balkan Women Filmmakers and the Transnational Imaginary.” Balkan film has undergone a sea-change since 2000. The films of the 1990s that brought Balkan cinema international attention, Mazaj writes, were not only all by male directors but “presented, without a slight hint of ambiguity, a hypermasculine and patriarchal image . . . that appealed to international audiences, in no small amount because it affirmed the stereotypical image of the Balkans.” Balkan carnivalesque caters dangerously to the worst kind of voyeurism.7 Mazaj counters with the “transnational imaginary” of collaborative efforts run by female directors, such as Maja Weiss’s Guardian of the Frontier (Varuh meje, 2002), Jasmila Žbanić’s Grbavica (2006), and Aida Begić’s Snow (Snijeg, 2006). Most of these films are international coproductions, often with Austria, Germany, and France, and with Iran in the case of Snow. The intervention of women’s cinema ends the Balkan decade and the “cinema of self-Balkanization.” These new female filmmakers explore a poetics of normalization, putting traditional markers of realist aesthetics to uses that simultaneously engage with and reject the expectations of “world cinema” and the “palatable foreignness” of quasidocumentary and ethnographic film. Grbavica deals with the institutionalized mass rapes that gendered the Bosnian War and prompted the UN International Criminal Tribunal to define rape as a war crime in 1996. Guardian of the Frontier uses an innocent canoe trip down the Kolpa, a border river between Slovenia and Croatia, to explore internal and external borders—“landscape and mindscape”—and preoccupations with national purity. Snow finds a strangely idyllic and self-sufficient female world in a Bosnian village whose men have all disappeared in the war. In the sixth part, “The New National Literatures,” Davor Beganović, Andrea Zlatar-Violić, Tatjana Rosić, Alojzija Zupan Sosič, and Venko ­Andonovski sketch out five different flightmaps of contemporary literary developments in Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Macedonia. Perhaps due to the very nature of the topic, all five chapters turn inward to look at cultural developments in their respective nations. The experiences of war-torn Bosnia have been very different from those of Slovenia: there can be no equivalent to the subgenre of Sarajevo siege stories in Ljubljana. One expects less antagonism toward American intervention in\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nZagreb than in Belgrade after bombardment; and even for purely literaryhistorical reasons, different practices to emerge in the newest national literature, Macedonian. However, the literatures explored by these chapters seem more similar than divergent. The novels are preoccupied with trauma and with the noir of urban subcultures; they combine the tricks and stylistic “reveals” of postmodernism with more traditional realistic narratives.8 The essays in turn enact as well as depict a sense of isolation; all of the pieces either critique or betray powerful anxieties over the new market for local literature, or the lack thereof. Yet, regardless of the relative pessimism or optimism of their introductory remarks, all five contributors still find much new national literature to discuss. Beganović opens “Traumatic Experiences: War Literature in Bosnia and Herzegovina Since the 1990s” with Freud’s famous essays “Beyond the Pleasure Principle” (1917) and “Mourning and Melancholy” (1920). From these he borrows the language that he and the other post-Yugoslav literary critics so inevitably use: these terms include trauma, melancholy, repetition compulsion, and the return of the repressed. Beganović notes that trauma has gone from meaning a physical wound to psychological damage in popular usage. Beganović draws a direct parallel between post–World War I Europe and Bosnia after the wars of succession: literature dealing with the Bosnian wars repeats the “classic modernism created in the aftermath of World War I.” In turn, contemporary Bosnian letters veer toward either realist or modernist techniques. Essentially, the two styles come down to the competing schools of Ivo Andrić and Krleža. The former foregrounds a poetics of melancholy, claustrophobic internal spaces, and suspended time: such are the novels of Sarajevo under siege. The latter is marked by “warrior’s prose,” grotesque and charged with images of violence and the front, and by external spaces. In these works everything changes, including the topography: the familiar becomes unfamiliar just as bodies are disfigured beyond recognition. There are psychological risks involved in war writing, which may give the reader voyeuristic pleasure: black humor offers some release, but the challenge is to avoid self-exoticizing and the “Balkan carnivalesque” for which Emir Kusturica and other filmmakers have been so often criticized. In “Culture of Memory or Cultural Amnesia: The Uses of the Past in the Contemporary Croatian Novel,” Zlatar-Violić remarks that Croatian poetry has faded away as a viable literary form, in favor of the more readily marketable and consumable novel. In a free-market competition,\n\n16 Introduction\n\nb­ estsellers win by definition, and their lists are “invariably topped by translations of international hits, on the whole Anglo-American.” The new Croatian literary market and publishing industry are not yet self-sustaining: Zlatar-Violić describes a “failure to restore the distribution network” after the 1990s. However, a relatively stable reading public continues to grow. She finds several categories and subspecies of contemporary Croatian fiction, such as women’s writing, war stories, and various testimonials. Writers active before secession, such as Slavenka Drakulić, a pioneer of Croatian feminism, and Dubravka Ugrešić, from abroad, continue to produce. New voices like Maša Kolanović conjure Novi Zagreb as a complex cultural citytext with the capacity to remember. Characters are veterans of one kind or another, suffering from posttraumatic stress syndrome and experiences that cannot be represented directly. One recurring tendency in contemporary Croatian letters is to “deconstruct the existing stereotypes and to dismantle the key collective images which have dominated our fiction, nonfiction, and the media scene.” Zlatar-Violić ends with a meditation on memory and amnesia. The peculiar power of the individual speech act, “I recall,” is particularly evident when writers in exile defend their memories against dominant national narratives. She repeats the words of Paul Ricoeur, “Too much memory in one place, too much forgetting in the other,” a summary with melancholy overtones of the irremediable human condition. In “Cheesecakes and Bestsellers: Contemporary Serbian Literature and the Scandal of Transition,” Rosić emphasizes the agonies of market pressure. More pessimistic than either Beganović or Zlatar-Violić, Rosić considers the “transitional” literary market to be neocolonial and to have “fatally impacted” Serbian literature. Gone is the highbrow “pleasure of the text,” as she uses Roland Barthes’ phrase, to be replaced with mass entertainment of the sort that Adorno and Horkheimer considered the end of resistance. Summarizing what remains, Rosić turns to Cake Parlor Stories, a collection edited by David Albahari and Vladan Mijatović Živojinović. Rather than a locale for self-indulgent nostalgia (baklava, tulumbe, chestnut purée, wheat with whipped cream—and ashtrays!) the cake parlor turns out to be the “arena for gory transition conflicts,” such as abductions, mafia extortions, terrorist conspiracies, and grotesque ­gastarbeiter one-­upmanship, as well as a “venue possessed since time immemorial by foreign, demonic, and colonial” forces. Rosić also notices a surge in women’s writing, but marked by a tendency to trade on sex appeal. She veers tantalizingly into metacriticism with a discussion of the criti-\n\nIntroduction 17\n\ncal publication Beton and its attempts to “build a dam” of intelligent and sustained critique.9 Most compellingly, after remarking on the fascination with the “culture and aesthetics of urban subcultural communities,” she draws attention to the virtual soundtrack running through new Serbian literature. A post-1968 “spirit of freedom, individualism, and social resistance” finds its best tools of subversion in music: Rosić even suggests that these soundtracks function as a kind of symbolic unconscious, one way of struggling against the “reality” presented by the media. Sosič opens the modestly titled “Slovene Literature Since 1990” with relative optimism: while sharing many concerns with the other contributors to this part, Sosič considers Slovenian literature to be blossoming. The bad news is that the “restructuring of capital within the global neoliberal system effectively destroyed the Slovene economy and negatively impacted the development of all genres of noncommercial literature.” Print runs of local literature have dropped to five hundred from the state-supported ten thousand, while market conditions favor the fast turnover likely to come from cookbooks, travel guides, and “various New Age guides to personal growth.” (Arguably, these same contradictions hold across the globe: statistically speaking, people are reading more than ever, but there is a sense that high culture is under siege.) However, Sosič emphasizes Slovenia’s relatively peaceful secession from the former Yugoslavia and its cultural consequences. Working from different premises and without the direct experience of trauma, she divorces her study from post-Yugoslav or regional contexts. She writes that “it is often tempting to rely on the umbrella category ‘transition literature’ to understand Slovene works in the last two decades”; but her own stance is that “Slovene literature is better understood outside the confines of political demarcations.” Sosič believes that high-quality novels are emerging (poetry remains nonviable) around “small themes” and personal topics such as romantic disappointment and the inability to communicate, rather than “great themes” like national identity. Sosič divides the new literary phenomena into “literary eclecticism,” “new emotionality,” and “transrealism.” Many of these post-postmodern works rely on traditional literary formulae and approaches, modified in subtle ways. The category of “transrealism” sounds especially tempting. The ­Russian-American theorist Mikhail Epstein coined the term transculture to describe traditions that cross and challenge national borders. Sosič seems to use transrealism to suggest the crossing of temporal rather than spatial boundaries—but perhaps this too is something that will evolve in time.\n\n18 Introduction\n\nFinally in this part of the book, Andonovski turns to Macedonian literature in “The Palimpsests of Nostalgia.” Macedonian literature as such was founded in 1945; the end of Yugoslavia in 1991 marked its second critical hour. In between, literary currents have swept from socialist realism to “truth as construct,” a phrase Andonovski borrows from the philosopher Richard Rorty. Beginning with the late 1960s, exposure to new literary theory, such as the works of Bakhtin, immediately sparked or coincided with experiments in the novel. Macedonian literature has gone on to produce highly polyphonic novels that portray history as subjective experience. Complex allegories borrow from the Bible, and a certain species of neoneo-Romantic irony and palimpsestic structures are prevalent. Andonovski insists that these are not just postmodernist games “revealing the codes” of literature, but stylistic tricks with ethical and political implications. Just as an early modernist novel drew allegorically on the subversive religious practices of the Bogomils (Georgi Abadjiev’s Desert, 1961), now stories of false prophets prevail, such as in The Prophet of Diskantrija (Pustina and prorokot od diskantrija, 2001; diskantrija = “this country,” Slavicized), by leading Macedonian postmodernist Dragi Mihajlovski. Andonovski suggests that contemporary Macedonian literature seeks to deconstruct the binary of local and global settings, in awareness of the “‘cursed’ Balkan area as a geopolitical projection of Western political discourses.” Finally, he insists that today’s identity is only temporary for Macedonia, caught postYU and pre-EU. If nostalgia is ever the key word, in the Macedonian case it seems to extend forward as well as back. Lastly, After Yugoslavia ends as it began, with a personal essay. In “The Spirit of the Kakanian Province,” Dubravka Ugrešić muses that the Austro-Hungarian empire “stamped a watermark on the souls of its subjects, an internal landscape, the coordinates of periphery and center.” Her thumbnail sketches of Kakanian novels uncover a requisite melancholy male protagonist, a local Werther or Byronic hero who returns to the provinces after an education in the West. Deprived of either context or audience, this country cousin to the superfluous men of Russian letters inevitably goes mad or commits suicide. The reader, Ugrešić quips, might conclude that Croats “used the sea for nothing but drowning,” but in reality sea tourism was already booming. The subgenre of the tragic return culminates in Krleža: “In an ideal literary republic, all other Croatian writers . . . would be nothing but a footnote to—Miroslav Krleža.” Herself a kind of female incarnation of the Kakanian exile, the Amsterdam-based Ugrešić\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nmourns for the brief deprovincialization of socialist Yugoslavia. We had passports, she writes, and now we have the philosophy of the palanka and a cult of death. “Foreign media exercise their almost knee-jerk colonialism”; the crowds follows false prophets; “the five-hundred-year-old Gutenberg galaxy is dying while the new, young, omnipresent Digital galaxy is ascendant.” Culture has become a brand: culture is the “ideological Euro.” Unfortunately, the “Kakanian” republic of letters is too utopian a project to attract many citizens. .\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThis volume hardly presents the final word on the cultures of the former Yugoslavia and the post-Yugoslav spaces, but it strives to create an alternative space for discussion, one that might not have been possible at the turn of the new century. These essays, inquiries, articles, and interventions seek both to describe and to shape possibilities for extended regional communication. I find it beautifully fitting that the book begins and ends with the work of female writers: in fact, the entire structure of After Yugoslavia has something in common with the argument presented by Mazaj’s chapter. Ultimately and partly through fortuitous accident, the project is framed by a chorus of women’s voices; by collaboration and the promise of a sea-change in the discourse on post-Yugoslavia. Perhaps in criticism as well as in film, the era of self-Balkanization is fading: the increasing presence of female voices seems to me a very good sign.\n\n1 My Yugoslavia Maria Todorova\n\n“My Yugoslavia” is my way of sharing with the ones for whom Yugoslavia was an existential reality, their home for good or for bad, how a view from the outside was shaped. While it is an external view, it is not necessarily foreign: I would dare to say it is the view of an intimate stranger (or, less poetically, of a neighbor). This is not a research essay that pretends to add new knowledge or novel analysis. What it does do is illustrate my scholarly and personal engagements with Yugoslavia; it is a kind of Bildungs essay. When I was a little girl, of the four borders of my country my favorite was the one on the right side of the map: the eastern border, the Black Sea, where we went every summer on vacation. But I knew that on the left side of the map there was a country called Yugoslavia, and I was positively disposed to it, because from there came the chocolates called Kraš, which tetkica Božena would bring ever so often. She was a close family friend, born in Zagreb; she had moved to Sarajevo during the Second World War because she could not stand the Germans, and there she met and married a Bulgarian. We grew up with her daughter, who now lives in Canada with her Bulgarian husband. But that was pretty much all. Like most Balkan people at the time (and I think this pattern is very gradually beginning to be broken only in the past two decades), I was least of all interested in my neighbors. I had started school in Austria, then spent time in Germany, and later attended an English school; this is where my cultural interests lay. The one exception was Greece. I had been weaned, like many of my contemporaries, on Greek mythology, and I came from a mixed GreekBulgarian background, so sometime in high school I started learning\n\n24 My Yugoslavia: Personal Essays\n\nGreek. My interest in the country almost vanished, however, when I began dating Bulgarian boys, and my Greek grandmother told me solemnly that I should never forget that I was a “daughter of Pericles.” I don’t remember myself ever understanding the appeal of nationalism, but if ever there was a potential for my developing some national pride, this was the dire end of it. On top of it came my interest in the Ottoman empire, and when I entered university, I began studying Ottoman Turkish. My interests thus gravitated in a southeastern direction. When I first visited Istanbul, I instantly fell in love with the city. I was aware that the people I was meeting there, who were all wonderfully educated and cultivated, were not your average Turks, but this gave me enough ammunition to fight all the profound anti-Turkish prejudices at home. When the first Congress of Balkan Studies was convened, in Sofia in 1966, I was still in high school. Coming from a historian’s household, I had already encountered such silver-haired scholars, who came to our house from all over the world. I would regularly fall in love with one or more of them. Two in particular held my fancy for many years, both of them in their seventies: One, Anatolii Filipovich Miller, a prominent Russian Ottomanist, who sported a watch that had been given him by Atatürk, was like my third grandfather. The other one, an Albanian, I saw in a more romantic light: Alex Buda, a historian and president of the Albanian Academy of Sciences, who had studied in Vienna in his youth and could recite Goethe by heart. As a result, Albania was for me the epitome of real intellectuals, and the few contacts I had later with Albanian academics only confirmed this belief. This is significant, as it inadvertently influenced my first impressions of Serbian academics. At one of my earliest scholarly conferences, when I was a kind of debutante, nervous at presenting my work and at having left behind a husband with two tiny children for a few days, my colleague at the panel was a young Serbian academic. I had clashed with him in the corridors, when he enlightened me with regard to my naïveté about Albanians, all of whom he believed were savage and backward. Of course, my measure of Albania was Alex Buda. But it became worse when, unsatisfied with my continuing naïveté, he asked me how my husband and children were faring without their mother? What were they eating? Canned food? No, I replied, I had actually prepared cooked meals that I had put in boxes in the deep freezer with a different menu for every day. That was already a crime. I heard a lecture about organic and freshly prepared food, and how he refused to eat anything but\n\nMy Yugoslavia 25\n\nwhat his mother prepared for him from the farmer’s market. We parted, both of us firm in our negative impressions. For him, I was a naïve person (part of the postwar feminization of scholarship), and a failure as a mother, and my verdict of him was no less generous: he was a racist and a macho. To me this meant “Oriental.” So, I nested Orientalism in Serbia (avant la lettre) many years before I came to know Milica Bakić-Hayden, and many years before she had conceived of her felicitous and evocative concept. In my Balkan map, Turkey was Western (because of the handful of fascinating intellectuals there), and Yugoslavia was Eastern. Even one of my earliest positive encounters with Yugoslavia was mediated through Turkey. I must have been nineteen, when, browsing in an antiquarian bookshop in Istanbul, I stumbled upon Milovan Đilas’s Conversations with Stalin (Stalinle konuşmalar, 1964), in Turkish, and bought it. It did not much improve my Turkish, but it certainly whetted my appetite to learn more about Tito and why a broader Balkan federation had not materialized. My subsequent encounters with Serbian colleagues did not entirely disabuse me of my first negative impression until quite later, although I excluded women from my harsh judgment. And even there, the beginning was thorny. Olga Zirojević, the great Ottomanist, whose book ­Carigradski drum od Beograda do Budima u XVI i XVII veku (The Constantinople Road from Belgrade to Buda in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, 1976) I had long admired, approached me after one of my comments at a conference and told me that I was vrlo vredna. I was deeply mortified. The literal translation of vrlo vredna in Bulgarian is “exceedingly harmful”—in a word, a huge pest. Luckily, Olga saw me blush and gasp for air, and the misunderstanding was dispersed with lots of laughter, but it taught me never to arrogantly assume that I knew a language simply because it was the closest to my own. So when I did my next purchase of Yugoslav books, I made sure that it was in the original. But it was still mediated: I bought Ivo Andrić’s Na Drini ćuprija (The Bridge on the Drina) in the foreign-language bookshop in Moscow. My real-life introduction to inflation I also owe to another remarkable Serbian historian: the Ottomanist Bojanka DesanićLukać. We were in Hungary for a conference in the 1980s, and we had to pay our registration fee “in currency”—three dollars, no national equivalent. So Bojanka opened her large purse and started rummaging through a pile of banknotes, which turned out to be dinars, until at the very bottom of her purse she fished out the three precious green banknotes, exclaiming: “Ovo su pare [Here is the money].”\n\n26 My Yugoslavia: Personal Essays\n\nNor were my impressions of Yugoslav males, especially Serbian ones, entirely negative. One of the finest (of the very few fine Bulgarian feature movies) of the 1960s was a film adaptation of a novella by the great Bulgarian writer Emilian Stanev, Kradetsît na praskovi (The Peach Thief ). The story—set in the First World War—is about a POW camp in Tîrnovo, in which a Serbian officer and the wife of the Bulgarian chief-of-garrison fall in love with each other. At the end, when the camp has to be relocated, he decides to say a last farewell, sneaking into the garden of his beloved trying to bring her peaches. He is shot by the guards as a mere peach thief. It was a wonderful role—of the sophisticated, disillusioned, peace-loving, internationalist, and cosmopolitan Serb, contrasted with the priggish, disciplined, and boring Bulgarian military husband. The beautiful Nevena Kokanova was in the leading female role, and the Serbian officer was played by Rade Marković, who for a brief time became the dream of many Bulgarian women. Maybe because this, my first encounter with Serbs, was artsy, my first real-life one was very disappointing. It felt like a betrayal. I have to say, though, and this is my way of paying homage to one of the sweetest human beings I have ever encountered, that when I was already in the United State and came to know closely the late and much missed Mita Đorđević, his warm and soft nature reminded me of the peach thief. All of this is the stuff out of which stereotypes are made. Why am I telling these unimportant stories without any seeming connection or purpose? Because they all shaped a perception or, rather, a stereotype, and because this is how stereotypes are formed. They revolve around true occurrences, but it is the blanket generalization that elevates them to a seemingly coherent and, most often, dangerously sweeping and oversimplified picture. Later, I learned that such stereotypes are shared. In the mid-1990s, when I was writing Imagining the Balkans at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C., the journalist Liljana Smajlović, a cofellow, told me that at one point she had lived in Algeria, where her mother, a doctor, was posted for a period of time. When rambunctious Yugoslavs would go to the beach with wine and beer, and were accosted there by the local police, they maintained that they were Bulgarians. Recently, I read Vesna Golds­ worthy’s wonderfully moving memoir Chernobyl Strawberries, in which she describes going to a bookstore near St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. I remember this very same bookstore from before 1989: it gave out free books to Eastern Europeans—mostly forbidden literature, but also useful dictionaries, textbooks, and guides—and all you had to do was sign up in\n\nMy Yugoslavia 27\n\na pro forma book with your name and provenance, without being obliged to provide an identity. Vesna, upon picking up her volume of Solzhenitsyn (I believe), signed up as Bulgarian, just to be on the safe side. But this was not necessarily malicious. It displayed a certain kind of “cultural intimacy,” to use Michael Herzfeld’s notion, where you partake in the dirty linen of your group or a group you consider sufficiently close or well known. Yugoslavia was the last Balkan country (outside of Albania, where I have never been) that I visited while still living in the Balkans. As a child, I had actually passed through it once with my family en route to Hungary, but I did not remember anything. But Yugoslavia was a favorite choice for many Bulgarians. The language was similar, there were often open border meetings (even in the days of the Cold War), and then there was Macedonia, the bleeding Bulgarian irredenta until the Second World War. To conclude my section on personal reminiscences, I recall how recently I almost lost a good Serbian friend with my potentially hurtful comments. Countering the bitter complaint about the fate of the Kosovo monasteries and what was the sacred symbolic center of Serbian national consciousness, I pointed out (obviously tactlessly): “You’ll get over it. The Bulgarians got over Macedonia, but most importantly the Greeks got over Constantinople, and Constantinople is worth a couple of hundred Serbian monasteries and Macedonia on top, and even I would not be able to get over the city.” We are, however, still friends. It was mostly because of Macedonia that I was demonstrably not interested in Yugoslavia, since for many Bulgarians, and certainly for most of my historian colleagues, Macedonia was an obsession. I was sick of it and did not want to have anything to do with it (in fact, Macedonia is the only one of the former Yugoslav republics that I have not been to). But apart from Macedonia (and that primarily in unofficial conversations), university courses actually gave me a fairly solid grounding in the history of the neighboring South Slavs. As undergraduates conforming to a curriculum still owing a lot to the Humboldtian system we were drilled with an inordinate amount of ancient and medieval history. Apart from Bulgarian medieval history, I have passed exams in ancient Greece and Rome, Byzantine, Serbian medieval history, Russian medieval history, and Western European medieval history. All these courses were remarkably devoid of any nationalist zeal. The same was true, more or less, for the modern period, but it depended on the instructor. I happened to be exposed to professors of both kinds. For example, the professor who gave the lecture course on modern\n\n28 My Yugoslavia: Personal Essays\n\nBalkan history went against every cliché that would have been instilled in school. Explaining the Treaty of San Stefano, for example, the cornerstone of the idea of the modern Bulgarian state, he did not necessarily challenge the idea that it resurrected a Bulgarian state in its ethnic boundaries, since it actually did follow the borders of the Bulgarian Exarchate recognized by the Sublime Porte. However, the professor accompanied this with a map showing that this new Bulgaria of 1878 was larger than the territories of the new kingdoms of Serbia and Greece combined. Here was a wonderful illustration not only of clashing perspectives but of the conflict between the principles of balance of power and self-determination. On the other hand, his young assistant, who was writing a dissertation on the Comintern policy toward Macedonia, was of the opinion that Yugoslavia was an “artificial formation” that would inevitably disintegrate. I thought this was silly at the time and I still think so, even as he seems to have been vindicated by the latest developments. What is natural as opposed to artificial in the world of politics, after all? One of the most valuable graduate seminars I had at the University of Sofia was a seminar devoted to the history of the discipline. It was not exhaustive and there was little written on this subject at the time, but it provided a sound framework that remained intact over the years, to be filled in with detail and nuance. It is here that I first learned about Jovan Cvijić and his major work La Péninsule balkanique (1918). This grand regional survey was a paradigmatic work of geopolitical theory, drawing on the conjunction of geomorphologic and geophysical analysis with human geography and migrations, which bestowed a central political and strategic role to “Greater Serbia” as ordained by geography and in the best interests of the West. Thus history was subordinated to a geopolitical and ethno-cultural framework and the regional narrative was meant to buttress Yugoslav nation building, where common racial characteristics overwrote divergent historical and religious experiences. While the turn of the twentieth century was generally characterized by the radicalization of national discourses, it also saw the rise of non­national historical comparative methodologies, primarily among linguists, literary scholars, and ethnographers. Historiography, to the extent that it ventured beyond the national framework, later followed suit. The interwar period saw the institutionalization of Southeastern European studies in the whole region, and in this respect what was happening in Yugoslavia was crucial. In 1934, a Balkan Institute was founded in Belgrade under the auspices of the\n\nMy Yugoslavia 29\n\nKing of Yugoslavia. Alongside its research program, it had a regional geopolitical agenda envisaged on the basis of Balkan solidarity. “Our patriotism, if it wants to be real, should be a Balkan patriotism,” was the programmatic pronouncement of the founders of the Belgrade Balkan Institute.1 Two scholars were pivotal in defining the new discipline of Balkanology: the linguists Petar Skok, a Croat, and the Serb Milan Budimir. As editors of the Belgrade-based Revue internationale des études balkaniques, of which only three volumes were published between 1934 and 1938, they aimed at demonstrating the commonality of Balkan societies through the comparative method of the nineteenth century. They related the new discipline to Byzantinology, Egyptology, or to classical philology which studies together and in a comparative way Greek and Roman antiquity.2 In their first editorial, a sui generis Balkanological manifesto, Skok and Budimir observed that Balkan studies “divided into national compartments, such as were constituted after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, researched, in fact, solely the parts of an organic whole.”3 Thus, “state particularism has been duplicated with a scientific particularism.” They lamented that at present no scholar studies the common Balkan reality and pleaded that “the time has come to contemplate the coordinating of national academic Balkan studies, to give them cohesion, and, above all, to orient them towards the study of a Balkan organism that had constituted one whole since the most distanced times of classical and pre-classical antiquity. This is the principal goal of the science that we have called Balkanology and to which our journal is devoted.”4 The Yugoslav scholars posited for the Balkans “a unique law guiding the vicissitudes of the totality of their history.” This law manifested itself in two alternating historical trends—cohesion and particularism—from antiquity to the present.5 The major forces of “Balkan aggregation,” whether locally engendered or imposed from the outside, were the Hellenistic, the Roman, the Byzantine, and the Ottoman empires. The particularism of the Greek city-states was overcome by “the first Balkan aggregation” under Philip and Alexander the Great, which “issued from the proper forces of the peninsula and thanks to which the basis of the European civilization were laid.” I­rrespective of the linguistic divide between the Greek and the Latin worlds, the region preserved its political unity and internal cohesion under Roman and, subsequently, Byzantine domination. The tribal particularisms of the Slavs eventually succumbed to the same “Balkan law of aggregation”: the prime\n\n30 My Yugoslavia: Personal Essays\n\nambition of two Bulgarian empires and of the empire of Stefan Dušan was the unification of the peninsula.6 Where they really went against the grain was in their assessment of the Ottoman empire. Budimir and Skok attributed the present degree of social and cultural cohesion of the Balkan region primarily to the aggregation achieved and imposed by the empire of the “Turks.” Modern scholarship, however, had misinterpreted, according to them, the productive results of this aggregation; moreover, it had not duly recognized that the imperial regime had never pursued policies of denationalization typical of many other European states. The roots of this skewed interpretation lay in the ideology of nineteenth century Balkan romanticism. Balkan intellectuals, imbued with the desire to deliver their peoples from Ottoman oppression, saw the long centuries of Ottoman rule only as a continuous degradation of a formerly illustrious independent national past. This view was widely shared by practitioners in the new national disciplines, who focused accordingly on the study of the periods preceding the coming of the Turks, especially antiquity and the medieval states. Research on aspects of national life during the Ottoman period was almost completely ignored, with the exception of the anti-Turkish resistance.7 The Ottomans, according to Skok and Budimir, exerted their most significant impact by having imposed identical political and social conditions on the Balkan peoples. They had introduced “oriental urbanism”: the Balkan city originating with the Turks was “totally different from the ancient and the European” one and it exerted a strong impact on everyday life as well as on language. By tolerating and even favoring the mixture of Balkan races, the Turks had obliterated to a great extent the differences in mentality induced by the previous exclusivist medieval states. Skok and Budimir even attributed folklore and popular literature to the stimulus coming from Turkish rule insofar as the period of Turkish domination had encouraged the creation of national epics that became major sources of national pride for the Balkan peoples. The fact that popular poetry could travel freely across the space of the Ottoman empire allowed for the creation of common themes and vocabularies among the different Balkan folklores. Even the Romantic literary movement, known as “Balkan romanticism,” equally owed its unique characteristics that set it apart from the other European romanticisms, to Turkish rule. Finally—and this was the most powerful contention—it was utterly wrong to consider the Turks hostile to the civilization created in the Balkans before them since\n\nMy Yugoslavia 31\n\ntheir empire had embraced and maintained a number of Byzantine institutions.8 All of this had a singular appeal to me, legitimizing, as it were, my scholarly interests in a period that was not held in high esteem. In the manifesto “But et signification des études balkaniques,” Balkan­ ology is defined as a “science based on inter-Balkan comparison.”9 It was also an interdisciplinary science, encompassing history, linguistics, folklore, economics, the study of religion, literature, jurisdiction, and so on.10 It also formulated the methodology of a the inter-Balkan science that was to “to define and explain the parallel facts that make themselves manifest in the different domains of human activity in the Balkans.”11 A Balkanologist should be looking for analogies among the neighboring Balkan peoples. For any given question, at least two Balkan peoples should be compared, but the analysis should never be confined to a single case.12 Only a perspective of this kind was capable of explicating major historical processes and circumventing the strictly national frameworks. This advocacy of a comparativist framework within the region even prompted them to transcend the confines of the region itself. For example, they advocated a cross-regional comparison between the Balkans under Ottoman rule and the Iberian peninsula, stressing parallels between the impact of Arabs and Turks on traditional Christian societies.13 All in all, Balkanology had two objectives—theoretical and practical: “As a theoretical science it is expected to deepen our knowledge about the mutual relations between the Balkan peoples and to throw light on the intrinsic laws which have governed and continue to govern their development and their life.” As a practical science, it had a singular moral importance “to influence the Balkan mentality by offering Balkan statesmen knowledge of the Balkan man, his natural and social environment, his way of thinking and feeling, and at the same time by teaching the Balkan communities the necessity to know, understand, and cooperate with each other.”14 This interwar conceptualization of Balkan history, which was shared across the peninsula—already in 1920 a Balkan Near Eastern Institute was inaugurated in Sofia, and in Romania the first Institute of Southeast European Studies in 1913 continued with the Nicolae Iorga–established Institute of Byzantine Studies and then the Victor Papacostea Institute of Balkan Studies and Research in 1937—had much to do with the political conjuncture, especially adding a scholarly facet to Balkan cooperation following the establishment of the Balkan Pact (1934). The Second World War put\n\n32 My Yugoslavia: Personal Essays\n\nan end to this, and only the thaw in East-West relations in the early 1960s made possible a renewed regional dialogue. The present institutional organization of Balkan studies institutes in Greece, Turkey, the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania, as well as the ongoing system of Balkan congresses, has its immediate roots in the 1960s, but the fundamental principles and conceptualizations as they were formulated especially clearly by the influential Belgrade-based Revue internationale des études balkaniques (6 volumes, 1935–38) stood the test of time and structures research in the area to this day. This is the bookish baggage with which I came to the United States in the late 1980s, exactly at a time when the geopolitical reconfiguration produced a concomitant boom of interest in the region (catalyzed mainly by the dramatic events of the dissolution of Yugoslavia). On the one hand, it internationalized even further the scholarship on this region; on the other hand, it opened up gates for the revival of ethno-nationalist and exclusivist constructions. I began to read more closely in the history of Serbia and Croatia while I was working on my historical demography project, trying to make sense of the phenomenon that had been posited as Balkan par excellence, or rather typical of the South Slavs: the existence of the large communal family, the zadruga. This put me in touch with the works of a host of great pre-Yugoslav and Yugoslav scholars: Vuk Karadžić who coined the word, Baltasar Bogišić, Milenko Filipović, Rudolf Bićanić, Milovan Gavazzi, Vera Erlich, and Wayne Vucinich. I read most of them in the serene surroundings of Dumbarton Oaks under the wonderful care of the librarian of the Byzantine and Slavic collection—the late Seka Allen. Using rigorous statistical methods and data on population structure, marriage patterns, fertility and mortality rates, family and household size and structure, and inheritance patterns, I could show the great diversity in the Balkan region but, at the same time, its similarity to Western and Central European patterns. Above all, I reassessed the traditional stereotype of the complex Balkan family, showing that even in the periods where the zadruga was documented (only from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries), it was never statistically predominant. Its appearance (or recurrence) and decline could be due to different factors; I hypothesized that the most plausible explanation was the link between pastoral economy and multiple households.15 My work on this problematic cemented contacts and friendships with younger scholars, of whom the historical demographer and anthropologist Jasna Čapo-Žmegač is the most promi-\n\nMy Yugoslavia 33\n\nnent. With her, we had to fight for the acceptance of our theses against a wall of prejudice—my first real scholarly encounter with Balkanism. Technically, I would not have written Imagining the Balkans had it not been for the events of the 1990s, yet I have to confess that my very first irritant was not so much what was said about Yugoslavia but that what was said was generalized to the whole of the Balkans when it was a distinctly internal Yugoslav affair, and on top of that it was often said by people who did not want to be described as Balkan. Very soon, however, I realized that I was getting inordinately more emotionally involved than I would have done had this been somebody else’s affair, and not simply with what was being said but with what was going on. I realized that I was thinking and feeling Balkan. As an aside, when I was given a doctor honoris causa by my alma mater, the University of Sofia, I was told that there had been only one voice against conferring the honor on me, the accusation being that “she does not love Bulgaria; she loves the Balkans.” But the bigger surprise was that I was not thinking only “Balkan.” My mind did understand, but my heart could not share any of the separate national arguments, even when they were articulated in a relatively moderate fashion: the Croatian ebullience over newly acquired independence, the Serbian wounded pride, the Bosnian newly found spirituality, the Slovenian sigh of relief. The Macedonians, as the saying in Bulgaria went, finally proved they were Bulgarian; they were the only ones that did not fight. But, as I was later enlightened, the Macedonians too were unhappy with their provenance: as good Darwinians, they knew that all people stemmed from apes, only the poor Macedonians from Bulgarians. I was feeling sorry for Yugoslavia, and the only people with whom I could calmly speak were the ones who described (and continue to describe) themselves as Yugoslav. But, by then, Yugoslavia was no more and the issue on the agenda was how to think of it now. There were numerous options on the table: a failed state doomed from the outset by the incompatibility between the principles of centralization and federalism, or between the constituent principles of the contending nationalisms (one based on ethnic self-­determination, the other on historical rights); or because none of the constituent elements was strong enough to dominate over the others and serve as the magnetic center (the Bismarckian model—Pašić’s hesitancy in 1917 may have been vindicated); or because it was not sufficiently democratic and so turned into a Serbian dictatorship; or, on the contrary, because it was excessively democratic and its constitution provided the logical blueprint for the ensuing\n\n34 My Yugoslavia: Personal Essays\n\nconflict; or, it was thought of as a mini-empire after the general demise of empires in the wake of the First World War, and Tito as the last Habsburg; or as one of the most successful federative experiments, or as one of the most successful socialist experiments, one that maneuvered deftly during the Cold War and made its citizens proud of its policy of nonalignment; or as a state that was not doomed at all, had it not been for the international conjuncture and the premature recognition of secession, and on and on. There is probably truth in all these contradictory assessments, when we take into account who pronounces them and why. Personally I am not interested in any of these verdicts but rather in the question of what is left of Yugoslavia. And I propose that the best way to approach this issue is in terms of historical legacies. Earlier, for the sake of making sense of the Ottoman empire, I developed the framework of historical legacies and then argued that it is the most appropriate approach to analyzing historical regions. Any region or other geographical entity (in this case, a nation-state) can be approached as the complex result of the interplay of numerous historical periods, traditions, and legacies. For purely cognitive purposes, I distinguish between legacy as continuity and legacy as perception. Legacy as continuity is the survival but also gradual waning of some of the characteristics of the entity immediately before its collapse. Legacy as perception, on the other hand, is the articulation and rearticulation of how the entity is seen at different time periods by different individuals or groups. These should not be interpreted, as perhaps is implied by the use of the terms continuity and perception, as “real” versus “imagined” characteristics. The characteristics of the continuity are themselves often perceptual, and perceptions are no less a matter of continuous real social facts. The better way to define the distinction is to say that in both cases the categories designate social facts but that these are at different removes from experience. In the instance of perception, the social fact is removed yet a further step from immediate reality and one can perhaps juxtapose the natural versus the cultural or textual status of the social interaction. Thinking in terms of historical legacies—with their simultaneity and overlap as well as their gradually waning effects—allows us to emphasize the complexity and plasticity of the historical process.16 I will now turn to a couple of concrete examples to show how the category can be applied. When political entities disintegrate, the first casualty is the institutional structure. When they disintegrate through a bloody war, as was the case of Yugoslavia, it is accompanied by major demographical\n\nMy Yugoslavia 35\n\ndiscontinuities. Indeed, one of the most significant breaks has been the final ethnic unmixing of populations that had lived side by side for centuries if not for millennia. Of course, here we see lurking the vestiges of two imperial legacies, the Ottoman and the Habsburg, and this already involves the territories of the former Yugoslavia in spaces that are larger than the entity we analyze. In fact, it was the demographic complexity that I once described as one of the two persisting Ottoman legacies as continuity (the other being popular culture) that "
