        "text": "Written by: Rahman Wortman\n\nAbout a year ago R&B singer Jacquees boldly made claim to being the King of R&B of his generation. Besides ruffling the feathers of many R&B vets, his statement sparked an interesting conversation amongst R&B singers and fans from the ’80s to now, of who exactly is indeed the true king.\n\nTwo things were agreed upon after the topic of discussion was over: there was more than one king of rhythm and blues genre, and the common names mention were R. Kelly…I agree he is a monster who doesn’t deserve to experience freedom but it is what it is, Usher, Trey Songz, and Chris Brown were the names commonly mentioned.\n\nR. Kelly and Usher being named king are understandable. From 2005 to 2012 Trey Songz built a respectable catalog of good R&B music, but throughout his entire career, his impact was never strong enough to be able to claim the throne. Chris, however, makes a stronger argument because of his longevity in making hit records. It’s somewhat crazy to see how the kid who came out with his debut single, “Run It” 14 years ago to later on in life be mentioned as one of the greatest entertainers around with a resume of hits that have dominated the charts over the past decade. But while Chris Brown has indeed been the biggest R&B singer from 2010 to 2019, he has not yet earned the title of king for his genre of music because he has never made a classic album.\n\nInitially, I believed that there were only two kings of R&B: R. Kelly and Usher, but after giving more thought to it if the conversation is based off R&B from over the past 40 years then there is the third king, just keep the last name Brown and put Bobby as the first. Say what you want about Bobby Brown, because I’m pretty sure a majority of is going to be hilarious, but his impact on R&B can’t be denied. He broke the mold of what an R&B singer was supposed to sound and look like.\n\nThe image and the sound of most traditional R&B singers in the ’80s were gentle and sensitive, including Bobby during his jerry curl days in New Edition to his first album King of Stage. After it failed, Bobby took a different route and turned the jerry curls melodies into a Gumby fade harmonies on his sophomore album, Don’t Be Cruel. By adding hip hop’s sound and attitude into his music he helped introduce the new sound of R&B called New Jack Swing. As far as the image he did to R&B what Run DMC did to Hip Hop by adding street culture to the music. On top of that, he was an amazing dancer, and for awhile was the best stage performer since Michael Jackson. Without Bobby Brown the world doesn’t get future R&B thugs like Jodeci, R. Kelly, Jagged Edge, Trey Songz, Chris Brown, Tory Lanez, etc. That alone makes him one of the Kings of R&B, society just forget because of his mistakes, his antics and it’s terrible habit of dismissing someone’s career because they’re no longer in the limelight.\n\nTo say that Chris Brown isn’t a king of R&B is no knock against the catalog of music that he’s built over the past decade. Consistency is everything and there’s something to be said about any music artist that shows the ability to continue to make hit singles for a long period of time, especially during a time when their genre of music was starting to die down. During the past ten years the image and sound of R&B had changed, being the smooth and sexy crooner was starting to fade from popularity so R&B singers started to fizz out.\n\nAfter his amazing performance at the 2010 Soul Train Awards, R. Kelly’s past sins started catching up to him causing his music to be exiled by many music platforms. Usher fans started to become embarrassed seeing one of the biggest R&B singers in history make that dreadful transition to pop music.\n\nEven some of Chris Brown’s peers who came out around the same time faded away; Mario, Lloyd, Omarion, Ne-Yo, Bobby Valentino, and Pretty Ricky. The only two that lasted from that early-mid 2000 era was Chris Brown and Trey Songz, and even Trey’s wave started to calm down around 2014. Chris Brown, however, was able to give people the best of both worlds and sometimes bring different genres into his world of R&B.\n\nWe saw first saw this with his single “Forever” off his sophomore album Exclusive, so it’s not shocking that the kid dancing in Spearmint Gum commercial 11 years ago would be able to go on and make hits like “Yeah x 3,” “Beautiful People,” “Turn Up The Music,” and “Don’t Wake Me Up” while at the same time still giving the people R&B hits such as “Strip,” “Back To Sleep,” “Privacy,” and “Undecided.” Pop music wasn’t the only music genre that Chris experimented with though. While the traditional sound of R&B was no longer in, he began adding different sounds to it such as pop, electro, synthpop, alternative R&B , disco, and funk, creating multiple hits like “She Ain’t You,” “Sweet Love,” “New Flame,” “Liquor,” and “Grass Ain’t Greener.” But the one genre that not only helped make Chris Brown the best R&B artist of the decade but also saved his career was hip hop.\n\nIf Chris’ Brown’s career had a theme song it would probably be Lupe Fiasco’s “Hip Hop Saved My Life.” The bad boy image that follows him to this day came immediately after the horrific domestic dispute between him and pop icon/ex-girlfriend Rihanna. He quickly went from America’s sweetheart to public enemy number one so for a while the world didn’t care for Chris Brown. It seemed like his career was going to be over before it had a chance to grow, that is if it wasn’t for rap music. This is not to say that adding hip hop to his music something new to Chris because he was doing that at the beginning of his career; “Run It” featuring Juelz Santana, “Gimmie Dat Remix” featuring Lil Wayne, and “Kiss Kiss” featuring T-Pain.\n\nHowever, in 2010 when it felt like the world was against him started making his own mixtapes In My Zone 1 & 2 and Fan of a Fan with rapper Tyga and shockingly they started to catch fire. No, the mixtapes didn’t make him a top 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 greatest rapper of his time, he doesn’t get credit for rapping better than rappers who admit they don’t care to be a skilled lyricist. Despite his average lyrical ability his fans loved his own writing and once he collaborated with rapper Tyga and hip hop producer Kevin McCall to make his comeback hit single “Deuces,” and after his heartfelt BET Award tribute to the King of Pop and his idol Michael Jackson the world would love him once again.\n\nSimilar to R. Kelly in the ’90s, Chris Brown has become the go-to guy rappers would seek out for the hot R&B feature for their records. Many artists such as Tyga, Twista, Fat Joe, Ace Hood, Big Sean, Nicki Minaj, Kid Ink, DJ Khaled, Lil Dicky and many more have benefited from this man lending his hit-making talents to their songs. For the past 10 years, Chris Brown has shown that he has the undeniable ability to make a hit record and also shares traits of R&B kings before him which helps make a strong argument for him being the biggest R&B artist of the past decade. Nonetheless, he has yet to show the ability to make an undeniable classic album and that alone is the reason why the crown can’t be placed on his head just yet.\n\nBobby Brown was the king in the ’80s because he changed the image and sound of R&B. R. Kelly, even though he lacks the ability to read, was the king in the ’90s because he wrote so many hits for not just himself but for other artists as well. In the 2000’s decade Usher grew to be the last king because during his run he became one of, if not the biggest, R&B artists to dominate the pop charts. Chris Brown created a plethora of hits in an era where the traditional sound of R&B was no longer in, but what separates him from the 3 kings of R&B is that they each have a classic album in their catalog and he doesn’t. There isn’t an album of Chris Brown’s discography that is strong enough to sit with classics such as Don’t Be Cruel, 12 Play, and Confessions. It’s not to say that all of his albums are bad or good because like most art, music is subjective and everyone has a different opinion based on how it makes them feel.\n\nHowever, if we’re strictly talking about the level of impact an album has to stand through the test of time, a lot of his albums haven’t come close to the level of the three albums mentioned. When it comes to music Chris Brown usually just keeps up with the times so his albums aren’t considered game-changers or models for the next generation of R&B singers, in fact, they often are very repetitive. As a whole, they’re usually good for the moment then onto the next one, which doesn’t help when he’s in an era that consumes music so fast that it’s become harder to fully digest an album. For the past 10 years Chris Brown fans usually know what they’re getting when he drops an album; a bunch of songs with a variety of stellar production but usually consist of a couple of songs that they deem worthy to put in their playlist, which works for him being in the digital streaming era where points are made by how many times people listen to your music instead of buying it.\n\nHowever, the amount of hits that he has created over his career doesn’t erase the fact that he has yet to make a classic worthy album. It’s not to say that Chris Brown can’t make a classic album, especially if he has made timeless hits like ‘Yo (Excuse Me Miss)” Poppin,” “Take You Down” “No Bullshit,” “Fine China,” and “New Flame” featuring Usher and Rick Ross. He just hasn’t done it yet and if he’s going to be called a king of R&B then he has to do or surpass what kings before him have done. Until then the biggest R&B singer of the past decade isn’t a king, he’s just another phenomenal warrior.\n\nPhoto Credit: Prince Williams"
