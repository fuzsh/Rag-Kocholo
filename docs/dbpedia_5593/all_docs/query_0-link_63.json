        "text": "Events on This Day\n\n1874 - Harry S. Parmelee of New Haven, CT gave us reason to relax and cool off on this hot summer day. Mr. Parmelee received a patent for the sprinkler head.\n\n1896 - Harvey Hubbell of Bridgeport, CT received a patent for the pull-chain, electric-light socket! Pull the chain, the light goes on. Pull it again, the light goes off. Pull it again and the chain comes off...\n\n1909 - The liner Arapahoe was the first American ship to use the radio distress call, SOS. The ship found itself in trouble off Cape Hatteras, NC and radioed for help. The call was heard by the United Wireless station at Hatteras. Morse code is no longer an internationally acceptable form of communication for ships at sea and most ships now use mobile phones, fax machines, and e-mail to communicate. The Global Maritime Distress and Safety system, which uses the satellite-based Global Positioning System, is the internationally accepted manner in which to transmit a shipâs exact location and problem ... instantly.\n\n1924 - The first presidential film -- with sound -- recording was made in Washington DC. The film featured a little speech by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge on the lawn of the White House.\n\n1934 - The first federal prisoners arrived at the prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, California.\n\n1941 - Glenn Miller and his Orchestra recorded Elmerâs Tune on Bluebird Records.\n\n1943 - Benjamin F. White became the first four-time winner of the Hambletonian. White rode Volo Song to the win in a field of 11 racehorses.\n\n1949 - General Omar Bradley was promoted to Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. Bradley was the first person to hold that position.\n\n1951 - WCBS-TV in New York City became the first station to televise a baseball game in color. And they didnât stop there. They were also the first station to broadcast two games in color, as this was doubleheader day at Ebbets Field between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Boston Braves. (The Dodgers won the first game 8-1; the Braves took the nitecap, 8â4.)\n\n1952 - Hussein bin Talal was proclaimed King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. He was known to his people as \"Al-Malik Al-Insan\" (the humane king).\n\n1954 - A formal peace became effective in Indochina, ending more than seven years of fighting between the French and Communist Vietminh.\n\n1958 - Elvis Presley received a gold record for the hit, Hard Headed Woman. The song was featured in the movie King Creole.\n\n1961 - Warren Spahn of the Milwaukee Braves got his 300th major-league victory as he and his team beat the Chicago Cubs, 2-1.\n\n1965 - Thirty-four people died, more than 3,000 were arrested and there was over $40 million in damage to property in the Watts area of Los Angeles. All of this was the result of a six-day riot which began on this day, and was caused by a minor confrontation between the California Highway Patrol and two young black men.\n\n1970 - Jim Bunning of the Philadelphia Phillies became the first pitcher since Cy Young to win 100 games in each of the two major leagues.

And the groupâs first single, My Sharona, topped the Hot 100. The Knack were an overnight sensation, but their fall from grace was almost as rapid. Attacked by critics as cynical fakes, the Knack was history by 1982.\n\n1984 - The Cincinnati Reds honored All-Star and Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench by retiring his uniform (#5) this day.\n\n1984 - U.S. President Ronald Reagan was preparing for his weekly radio broadcast when, during testing of the microphone, the President said of the Soviet Union, â...I have signed legislation today that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.â The remark was made during a time when technicians had the microphone open and the President didnât think he was being heard. He was just jesting as he was testing. Funny, actually, that this could happen to âDutchâ Reagan -- a former radio sportscaster for WHO in Des Moines, Iowa and other radio stations -- not to mention TV and film. The remark, literally, bombed ... though nothing more serious happened.\n\n1992 - The Mall of America opened in Bloomington, Minnesota.
