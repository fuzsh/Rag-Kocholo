        "text": "Many musicians secretly want to be actors â€” and most actors (not-so-secretly) want to be musicians. And for those thespians who donâ€™t start their own bands with words like 30 Odd Foot of Grunts or Bacon Brothers in their names, the next best thing is to play a real-life musical genius in a movie. If the subjectâ€™s story happens to have a great rags-to-riches arc, or include a dive into drug-fueled, near-death depths with redemptive rise, phoenix-like, included in the third act, great; if such dramatic recreations attract the attention of Oscar voters, hey, all the better. But the chance to belt out a greatest-hits collection of songs from rock stars, hip-hop legends and country-and-western crooners is too tempting to pass up for most folks. You may never be Elvis â€” but you can play him on TV. (If youâ€™re Eminem, however, you do get to play a barely fictionalized version of yourself. Itâ€™s complicated.)\n\nMusic biopics are a bona fide genre, and thereâ€™s no sign that their popularity is dimming in the slightest. Last yearâ€™s N.W.A origin story Straight Outta Compton was one of 2015â€™s biggest hits, and in the next month, weâ€™re getting not one, not two, but three biopics on big-time musicians: the Ethan-Hawke-as-Chet-Baker opus Born to Be Blue; the honky-tonkin,â€™ high-lonesome tale of Hank Williams I Saw the Light; and Don Cheadleâ€™s free-form look at several specific points in Miles Davisâ€™ life, Miles Ahead.\n\nSo weâ€™re counting down our choices for the best music biopics of all time. Some films werenâ€™t considered due to technicalities (the great Gilbert and Sullivan movie Topsy-Turvy is a better backstage film than a music biopic; The Rose features a Janis Joplin-like singer, but you canâ€™t say itâ€™s a Joplin biopic), while others fall in a weird interzone that helped them make the cut (the main jazz player in Round Midnight hews close enough to both its inspirational subjectsâ€™ lives that itâ€™s practically a dual portrait). But for us, these 30 titles are the ones that stay on tune as much as possible."
