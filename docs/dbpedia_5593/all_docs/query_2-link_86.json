        "text": "Our Picks for Must-See Musicians at French Quarter Fest\n\nThe 43 Artists We Can’t Wait to See by Day\n\nLast Updated: Wednesday, April 3, 2024 5:28 PM\n\nSure, we may be a bit biased, but when it comes to free festivals, it’s hard to find a more diverse, wide-ranging, and thoroughly enjoyable experience than our very own French Quarter Festival, which kicks off its 41st anniversary on Thursday, April 11 and runs through Sunday, April 14.\n\nWith over 270 performances by local and regional artists, there’s no shortage of options for hearing great live music on any day, at any of the 22 stages strategically placed throughout the French Quarter.\n\nBryce Ell, New Orleans & Company\n\nWe connected with our good friends at WWOZ (90.7 FM here in New Orleans), partners on our New Orleans Musician’s Database, and experts on all things New Orleans music, to identify some truly remarkable, can’t-miss acts slated to perform at the fest this year.\n\nWe can’t emphasize strongly enough that this was a nearly impossible task, because there’s so much excellent music every day, and you really can’t go wrong, no matter the day, time, or stage. Just make sure you find time to also enjoy some of the culinary delights, and cocktails being served up by more than 60+ local restaurants and bars.\n\nWith that, here’s a short list of artists we’re really excited about seeing at French Quarter Festival this year. And yes, many of them are playing at the same time, so you can catch a partial set of each, or enjoy one entire performance. Either way, you're sure to have a great time:\n\nJump To: Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday\n\nJusten Williams\n\nThursday\n\nRory Danger & The Danger Dangers\n\nAbita Beer Stage – 11:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m.\n\nRock/Rockabilly\n\nT Marie & Bayou Juju\n\nChevron Stage – 12:50 – 1:50 p.m.\n\nTraditional/Original Louisiana Music - T Marie plays fiddle\n\nJohnny Sansone\n\nJack Daniel’s Stage – 12:50 – 1:50 p.m.\n\nBlues - Johnny plays Harmonica & Accordion, sings\n\nThe Lilli Lewis Project\n\nAbita Beer Stage – 12:50 – 1:50 p.m.\n\nSoul-filled songwriting, piano, and vocals\n\nLos Güiros\n\nTropical Isle Hand Grenade Stage – 3:10 – 4:10 p.m.\n\nBlend of traditional folkloric dance rhythms of Colombia and the guitar/organ-driven sounds of Peruvian Chicha\n\nIvan Neville & Friends\n\nAbita Beer Stage – 6:40 - 8 p.m.\n\nMix of Funk, Jazz, R&B, Blues, Soul, Rock & Reggae - Organ/Keys driven\n\nBig Freedia\n\nChevron Stage – 6:45 – 8 p.m.\n\nBounce/Hip-Hop\n\nImage Courtesy of WWOZ\n\nFriday\n\nTuba Skinny\n\nNew Orleans & Company Stage – 11:15 a.m. – 12:25 p.m.\n\nTrad jazz, jug band music, spirituals, country blues, string band music, ragtime, and New Orleans R&B.\n\nShannon Powell Traditional All-Star Band\n\nNew Orleans & Company Stage – 12:45 – 2 p.m.\n\nTrad jazz\n\nBobbi Rae\n\nLouisiana Seafood Songwriter Stage – 1:30 – 2:25 p.m.\n\nR&B Singer-Songwriter\n\nSaxkixave\n\nJack Daniel’s Stage – 2:10 – 3:10 p.m.\n\nMulti-instrumental Hip-Hop duo\n\nCole Williams\n\nLoyola University Esplanade in the Shade Stage – 3:10-4:10 p.m.\n\nSinger-Songwriter Soul, World, R&B, Reggae\n\nHigher Heights Reggae Band\n\nTropical Isle Hand Grenade Stage – 3:10 – 4:10 p.m.\n\nReggae Band\n\nPeople Museum\n\nJack Daniel’s Stage – 3:30 – 4:40 p.m.\n\nElectro-Pop original music\n\nBon Bon Vivant\n\nLoyola University Esplanade in the Shade Stage – 4:30-5:30 p.m.\n\nSinger-songwriter Americana/pop/unique New Orleans sound/dark ballads to up-tempo indie dance music\n\nSunpie & The Louisiana Sunspots\n\nChevron Stage – 5-6:10 p.m.\n\nAfro-Louisiana music incorporating Blues, Zydeco, Gospel, Caribbean, and African influenced rhythms and melodies.
