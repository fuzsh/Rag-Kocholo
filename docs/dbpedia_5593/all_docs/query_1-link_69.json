        "text": "Real Housewife Drew Sidora made her entrance into the cast during Season 13, offering fans an intimate glimpse into her life. However, as viewers got to know her better, numerous facets of Drew’s personality and background began to raise questions. Her presence on the show introduced a sense of mystery, turmoil, and curiosity as fans wondered about the secrets and complexities that might be hiding behind the “glamorous” facade. Drew’s journey in the Real Housewives series revealed secrets and highlights about her that could never be imagined, which has led to the three main points of “Unwrapping Drew Sidora.”\n\nHer Marriage:\n\nDrew and Ralph’s marriage has been the talk of RHOA Twitter since Season 13. There were many moments throughout their time on the screen that raised cause for concern—a prime example being Ralph’s Tampa trip. As a woman, why are you staying with this man who is going on spontaneous trips without you, leaving without your knowledge for days, and you don’t know where he is? Then, when he comes back, he takes an entire season to tell you where he was! And for Ralph?! It’s so unbecoming. Speaking of Drew’s questionable marriage, that leads me to my next topic.\n\nThe Unbecoming of Drew as a Woman:\n\nThere are a few things that led me to have this topic about Drew. The first being the Tampa trip, but the next topic, we’re going to do a jump in the timeline—Drew singing to Ralph during the Season 15 reunion. Let’s have a moment of silence for the CRINGIEST moment to ever happen at a reunion.\n\n#InCaitsMind, I just feel like pitiful Ralph Pittman is not that great of a man to be going through the mud with! He’s so odd!! Next on the unbecoming list is Drew lying about kissing LaToya—or a woman, period. We see housewives kiss other women all the time. For my Orange County viewers, can we talk about Tamra and Braunwyn? Oh, okay. I know they kick it completely differently in the OC, but things would have unfolded differently if Drew and Ralph had a secure marriage and a mutual understanding. This didn’t work out in Drew’s favor because she’s actually attracted to women, Ralph is insecure and weird, their marriage did not have a strong foundation, etc. Then it’s also like, how are you going to lie about kissing LaToya when you did it… at a slumber party… with damn near all of the ladies present? UNBECOMING.\n\nDrew’s Singing Career:\n\nI don’t know WHERE this singing career spawned from—she says she has been singing since childhood, but maybe we should just focus on the acting. The only singing career I want to hear from Drew is when she played a singer on The Game… off-topic, but I wanted her and Derwin to be together #sorry. It definitely wasn’t a good idea to allow Ralph to not only produce your single that is essentially the world’s introduction to your singing career, but you also allowed him to be on the cover… and the song was ABOUT him. It just seems like launching the singing career was an attempt to save her marriage. Now, look Drew, both are down the drain.\n\nAll in all, Drew has had quite the storyline while holding her peach… let’s just wait and see if she’ll be holding one next season OR cousin Courtney.\n\nWHERE LIFESTYLE MEETS MY-STYLE"
