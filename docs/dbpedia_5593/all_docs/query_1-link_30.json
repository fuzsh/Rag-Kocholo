        "text": "Drew Sidora is not an artist who upon first glance would be considered a Hip Hop DIVA. But, take a closer look and you’ll see she embodies a DIVA and a pop princess. Let’s just call her our Pop DIVA. She is probably most famously known for her role as herself in WB’s “The Game”. Don’t get it twised though. She is not the boyfriend-stealing girl that tore Melanie and Derwin apart. But she is the beautiful and talented singer that was depicted in that role.\n\nDrew began studying music and theatre at the age of two, began dancing when she was four, and was the lead singer for a Chicago based R&B group, MO’ TEMPO a the age of 13. Upon high school graduation she moved to Los Angeles, signed to Babyface Entertainment, and wrote music for Edmonds Publishing. Her natural talent coupled with years of training has prepared her to become the first pop female vocalist signed to Slip-N-Slide Records. There’s gotta be a little DIVA in her to be able to hold her own on such a strong hip hop label. Not to mention, she loves Sweet Tee.\n\nDIVAS gotta give back and that’s exactly what Drew does. She is a spokesperson for Liz Claiborne’s Love Is Not Abuse Campaign which focuses on teaching high school students about the issues of dating violence. She is also a spokesperson for The Sickle Cell Disease Association of Illinois. When not speaking on these issues, Drew provides outreach programs and resources for young people interesed in entertainment industry careers. Not only is Drew an example of someone building a strong entertainment career, but she is an example of how that career can be used to inspire, educate, and assist others.\n\nShe knows and respects her Hip Hop DIVAS, she’s down with a hip hop label, and she gives back to her community. She may sing pop and R&B but we will know and love her as a true Hip Hop DIVA.\n\nCheck out Drew Sidora at www.myspace.com/drewsidora\n\nCheck out “Not Alone” featuring Atiba."
