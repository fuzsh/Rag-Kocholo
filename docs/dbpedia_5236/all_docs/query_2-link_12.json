        "text": "Feb 7, 2004\n\nFinal Stats\n\nPROVO, Utah (AP) - Two free throws by Mike Hall in the final seconds of the game handed Brigham Young a 64-61 victory over UNLV Saturday.\n\nHall blocked a 3-point attempt by Demetrius Hunter and was fouled during his scramble to retrieve the ball. The free throws sealed the Cougars' (13-7, 3-4 MWC) win, snapping their three-game losing streak, and evened their all-time series with the Runnin Rebels (12-7, 3-4) at 8-8.\n\nWith 41 seconds left in the game, UNLV's leading scorer Odartey Blankson hit two free throws to give the Rebels a 61-60 lead, their first lead since the nine-minute mark, when they led 12-11.\n\nBut Mark Bigelow countered with two free throws ten seconds later to give the Cougars the lead for good.\n\nComing off a 3-15 performance last week against Utah, BYU's Rafael Araujo turned around his shooting, hitting five of seven shots in the first half, including six points in a key 10-2 BYU run. He finished with game-highs of 18 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nLuiz Lemes had a career-high 10 assists.\n\nThe Rebels committed 21 turnovers, including 15 in the first half, but had near-perfect free-throw shooting and some key 3-pointers.\n\nBlankson, who was 6-6 from the free throw line, led the Rebels with 15 points and 12 rebounds."
