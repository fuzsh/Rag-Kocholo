        "text": "<font color=\"DimGray\">This assumes the Sonics get the 12th pick in the draft.</font>\n\nThe Sonics will enter this year's NBA Draft once again searching for a big man to fill their most glaring hole. The top post players (Emeka Okafor and Dwight Howard) of course won't fall to the 12th pick but here are some players that the Sonics may get to choose from.\n\nKris Humphries\n\n6'8 240 Minnesota\n\nKris is a little undersized but plays bigger. He is an excellent rebounder which is what Seattle direly needs. Big physical type with a mid-range game to compliment his play in the paint. He is still very young and could greatly improve his game with NBA coaches and trainers helping him along.\n\nAndris Biedrins\n\n6'11 240\n\nAnother European project with size and very raw ability. He's a blocking machine and is an all around good defender which once again is a need for the Supes. He is in my opinion the best foreign prospect in the draft.\n\nKosta Perovic\n\n7'3 240\n\nOnce again, a big Euro player but this guy is the opposite of Biedrins. His physical game is much more suspect than his offensive game. His size is his biggest draw but he also needs to add bulk to his 7'3 frame.\n\nTiago Splitter\n\n6'10 240\n\nThis guy is pretty much in the same mold as Biedrins, his defense is more deadly than his offense and he has an NBA body. He would be too much like Vladimir Radmanovic (SF playing out of position) if the Sonics drafted him because he plays the offensive end much better beyond the key.\n\nRafael Araujo\n\n6'11 280\n\nReally big and strong guy that is a scoring machine near the basket. He's like a younger Shaq because he uses power as his biggest asset in tormenting defenders.\n\nThoughts on the draft anyone?\n\nWell a lot of it depends on if the Sonics are aiming to make the playoffs next year, or are still trying to rebuild and get better. If they are going for the playoffs, I'd go for Humphries as he should bring the most immediate impact. Perovic and Biedrins have huge potential, but at this stage and are relatively unknown. They would be risky picks, but it could pay off well. Araujo is a horrible defender, and would pick up fouls quickly in the NBA.\n\nInteresting thoughts, tmac. I would shy away from Humphries to be perfectly honest - simply because we have Collison who is effectively a rookie next season. These two were both double double guys in college, and with Seattle likely to look for some post help via trade, I wouldn't really be looking at Humphries and Collison in the mix as well.\n\nThe two guys who intrigue me are Stanford's Josh Childress and Arizona's Andre Iguadola. They play SF and SG respectively, the two positions Seattle are stacked at. I would sacrifice Rashard or even Ray if it meant long term help inside, but these guys really do interest me. I doubt Iguoadola would be available where the Sonics are picking, but Childress is an outside chance, even if he doesn't fill a need.\n\nAnother guy who strikes a bit of intrigue with me is Rafael Araujo, although I'm not sold on him by a long shot. Has a lot of potential on offense, but his fitness and defense really do worry me. Now where have us Sonics fans heard that before??\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quote:</div><div class=\"quote_post\">Seton Hill University (Pa.) might produce one of the more interesting stories in this year's NBA draft. The school is only about 15 percent male, but it started a men's basketball program last year under Tony Morocco, who landed Ales Chan, a 7-1 Czech center, who averaged 17.0 points and 10.4 rebounds for a team that went 18-8 in its first NAIA season. Chan is a 270-pound senior whose athleticism and versatility were showcased in Morocco's wide-open offense. Morocco says Chan can shoot from the perimeter, has a terrific hook shot and is a good passer for a big man. He is fluent in five languages and scored a 720 on the math portion of his SATs. \"He is a well-rounded kid,\" Morocco says. \"Everything he does is very efficient. He works hard, and he is easy to coach. He is flying under the radar right now.\" That might not last long--the Suns and Bulls have shown interest in Chan. . . . </div>\n\n<font size=\"1\">Full Story courtesy of Sean Deveney and Yahoo Sports.</font>\n\nVery interesting...\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quote:</div><div class=\"quote_post\">BOULDER, Colo. (AP) ? Colorado center David Harrison will forgo his senior season and enter the NBA draft.\n\nThe 7-foot junior is the school's all-time leading shot blocker with 191 and was an honorable mention AP All-American this season.\n\nHe led the Buffaloes (18-11) last season in scoring (17.1 points), rebounding (8.8), blocked shots (2.9) and field goal percentage (.631).</div>\n\n<font size=\"1\">Full Story courtesy of USA Today.</font>\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quote:</div><div class=\"quote_post\">I'm excited for the next stage of my life,\" Harrison said. \"I thought I had a good season and have a great opportunity to get selected in the first round. The time is right for me to leave Colorado and I think I offer a lot to an NBA team with my size and physical ability.\"</div>\n\n<font size=\"1\">Full Story courtesy of Yahoo Sports.</font>\n\nI have heard of this fellow by name only. Can any College followers shed any more light on this guy? Where would he be expected to go, does he have an NBA game etc?\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quote:</div><div class=\"quote_post\">He's 7-5, 260 pounds, with a 8-foot wingspan. He turned eighteen less than a week ago. He?s a shot blocker with a soft shooting touch. He comes from Iran, and he can grab the rim flat footed and dunk on his tippy-toes!\n\nThe natural reaction to ?from Iran? is, ?So he can?t play, right?? But he can. He?s still raw but not as raw as you might imagine.\n\nJaber Rouzbahani has been playing basketball for less than four years. He played Yao Ming in an Asian Tournament last year and held him to 15 points. (About half of what Yao was averaging in the tournament.) He also played at the (19-under) World Junior Championships in Thessaloniki, Greece last summer in front of NBA scouts averaging 12 points and 8 rebounds per game and an eye opening 7 blocks, leading the entire tournament.\n\nJaber (pronounced JAB-er) has been working with Ansar Alameen, a (NBA skill development) coach since moving to America. Alameen said, ?His development since I?ve been working with him is like nothing I?ve ever seen. It really comes down to his attitude.?\n\nRouzbahani was brought over from Iran three months ago after acquiring the necessary visa. He is currently staying in the Bay Area and works out at Contra Costa College.</div>\n\n<font size=\"1\">Full Story courtesy of Aran Smith and NBA Draft Net.</font>\n\nThis guy sounds very, very interesting indeed. Maybe he's slipped under a few radars, but if that article isn't exaggerating the point, you would expect he would get quite a bit of attention as the draft draws closer. Here's his Draft Net profile.\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quoting Supersonic:</div><div class=\"quote_post\">I have heard of this fellow by name only. Can any College followers shed any more light on this guy? Where would he be expected to go, does he have an NBA game etc?</div>\n\nwell Harrison is a Tennessee cat so I followed him thru college..he is considered one of the best high school players in the history of Tennessee basketball....he's big and strong and a good defender, a real 7 footer. In college he was a good rebounder on both ends of the floor and had an instinct for shot blocking..moved extremely well up and down the court..decent offensive post game....but I have doubts about his intangibles and fundamentals...always seemed kinda raw in that sense. Always had trouble creating for himself too..but I think for what the Sonics need he may fill that niche.\n\nJust my two cents tho'...\n\nThanks NMG, found his profile on NBA Draft Net, located here.\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quote:</div><div class=\"quote_post\">Strengths: Extremely skilled and refined player on the low block. Has a variety of effective post moves and can use either hand equally around the basket. Solid footwork and very soft hands allow him to be quite fluid and the game comes naturally to him. Possesses excellent body control and the ability to finish after drawing the foul. He?s made more foul shots than any other player in the Pac-10 has attempted. Statistically, the best freshman post-player in the conference since Shareef Abdur-Rahim despite seeing relentless double and triple teams, as well as zone defenses designed to stop him. Excellent from the foul line at nearly 80%. Has an accurate and consistent jumper out to 18 feet and is very comfortable facing up. Ball skills are above average and his game is well-suited for the two-man pick and roll game that is so prominent in the NBA. Very cerebral player who understands his strengths and limitations and plays within himself. A throw-back type player with a very strong, solid body and a fundamentally sound game.</div>\n\nFrom reading the full profile (only his strengths posted on here), I would say he's a very exciting prospect, but needs another year or two at College. One to keep an eye on no doubt, but I don't think he's declared as he isn't listed in their mock draft.\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quoting Shard:</div><div class=\"quote_post\"><font color=\"DimGray\">This assumes the Sonics get the 12th pick in the draft.</font>\n\nTiago Splitter\n\n6'10 240\n\nThis guy is pretty much in the same mold as Biedrins, his defense is more deadly than his offense and he has an NBA body. He would be too much like Vladimir Radmanovic (SF playing out of position) if the Sonics drafted him because he plays the offensive end much better beyond the key.\n\nRafael Araujo\n\n6'11 280\n\nReally big and strong guy that is a scoring machine near the basket. He's like a younger Shaq because he uses power as his biggest asset in tormenting defenders.\n\nThoughts on the draft anyone?</div>\n\nThose two are who I'd be interested in, they have size and strength. That alone even if they didn't play defense could help disrupt shots. I've heard from Supersonic that Araujo isn't good on defense so because of that I'd rather take Splitter, I like the sound of him better. The term \"defense wins games\" is the mentality that comes to mind for me when I read about him."
