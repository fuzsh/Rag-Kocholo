        "text": "Araujo signs with Raptors\n\nThe Toronto Raptors announced Saturday they have signed first-round draft choice Rafael Araujo, a former BYU center. The Raptors selected Araujo with the eighth overall pick in the first round of the 2004 NBA Draft.\n\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nAraujo will see his first action as a member of the Raptors during the Minnesota Summer League at the Target Center in Minneapolis, which runs today through Saturday, June 10. The Raptors open play today against the expansion Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nAraujo played two seasons at BYU, averaging 15.1 points and 9.5 rebounds a game. He was also named Co-Mountain West Conference Player of the Year last season, a year in which he averaged 18.4 points and 10.1 rebounds per game.\n\nThe 6-foot-11, 290 pound center had his best game of his BYU career versus Final Four team Oklahoma State last December, scoring a career-high 32 points and grabbing 17 rebounds to lead the Cougars past the Cowboys, 76-71.\n\nKrzyzewski staying at Duke\n\nDURHAM, N.C. (AP) - Mike Krzyzewski is staying at Duke, ending talks with the Los Angeles Lakers about becoming their coach.\n\nThe school said Monday that Krzyzewski had informed the Lakers of his decision. An afternoon news conference was scheduled on campus.\n\nKrzyzewski, who has led Duke to three national titles in his 24 years at the school, met with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak on Thursday to discuss the team's coaching vacancy, one of the NBA's showcase positions. Even Lakers star Kobe Bryant was reportedly involved in trying to persuade Coach K to take the job.\n\nThe Lakers had no immediate comment Monday on the decision by Krzyzewski, who signed a lifetime contract with Duke three years ago.\n\nThe Lakers have been searching for a new coach since June 18, when coach Phil Jackson stepped down three days after an NBA Finals loss to Detroit.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN reported that Krzyzewski was offered the job, but Lakers officials had refused comment.\n\nKenny Randolph, father of Duke forward Shavlik Randolph, said Krzyzewski told him in a phone call late Monday morning that he would stay with the Blue Devils.\n\n'He just basically said the thing sort of ballooned out of proportion and that he appreciated our friendship and confidence, and that he'd remain at Duke,' Randolph said. 'And that's all that had to be said.\n\n'I told him, 'Gosh, coach. I've got chill bumps.' And he said, 'I do, too.''\n\nThe 57-year-old Krzyzewski has a 621-181 record at Duke, leading the Blue Devils to championships in 1991, 1992 and 2001. Under Krzyzewski, the Blue Devils have 10 Final Four appearances, eight Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championships and 10 conference regular-season titles."
