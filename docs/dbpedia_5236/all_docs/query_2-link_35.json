        "text": "The Mountain West has been playing basketball for 20 seasons and has developed dozens of NBA players, but who is the best of the best? After San Diego State alum Kawhi Leonard won his second NBA championship last week, I decided to put together a list. Here are the 13 best basketball players to hail from the MW. The only requirement to qualify for the list was the player had to log at least one season in the conference. I considered pro accomplishments in these rankings, probably more so than what the players did in college since proving yourself at the top level of your sport is the hardest thing to do. Without further ado, here's the list.\n\n13. Rafael Araujo, BYU\n\nAraujo is an interesting case. He had two All-MW seasons at BYU (after two junior-college seasons) in which he averaged 15.1 points and 9.5 rebounds per game while shooting 56.7 percent from the field. That was good enough to get the 6-11, 280-pound center selected eighth in the 2004 draft one spot pick ahead of future NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala (oops!). Araujo’s pro career did not go well as he posted minus-0.4 win shares in his 139-game career, one of three first-rounders that year to post a negative career win share total (Pavel Podkolzin and Sergei Monia were the others). But his BYU tenure and high draft selection – the third-highest draft pick in MW history – landed him on the list. You could make a case for UNLV alum Patrick McCaw, who has won three NBA titles in his first three seasons in the league, but he logged just 57 minutes in his three finals. You could make a case for UNLV alum Anthony Bennett, the No. 1 pick in the 2013 draft, but his NBA career was awful.\n\n12. Jordan Caroline, Nevada\n\nCaroline must forge some sort of NBA career to stay on the list, but his three-year run at Nevada warrants inclusion. The undersized power forward is the MW leader in career double-doubles, passing the top two players on this list this season, and is first in career rebounds. Caroline is a three-time All-MW pick (two first team, one second team) who averaged 16.6 points, 9.1 rebounds and two assists per game during his MW tenure while shooting 46.3 percent from the field. Caroline also was a driving force as Nevada three-peated as MW regular-season champs, only the third time in conference history that has been accomplished, and helped the Wolf Pack to three NCAA Tournaments, including one Sweet 16.\n\n11. Joel Anthony, UNLV\n\nAnthony has the distinction of being the only player to make this list without being named to an All-MW team, although he was the MW defensive player of the year in 2006-07. Anthony only had two active seasons at UNLV (plus a redshirt) as a JuCo transfer, and he didn’t do much to distinguish himself there, setting career highs in points (5.2), rebounds (4.1) and blocks (2.9) as a senior. But the 6-9, 245-pound center had one of the best NBA careers among MW players. He won two NBA titles, one of four league alums to win a crown. He was largely just a big body in the NBA, averaging 2.2 points and 2.8 rebounds in 490 games, but his 15.3 career win shares ranks fifth among MW players.\n\n10. Brandon Clarke, San Jose State\n\nA player from San Jose State made the list? Yes, a player from San Jose State made the list! Although he had to leave San Jose State to really blossom. Clarke spent two seasons in the Bay Area, including a great sophomore season that lifted the Spartans out of last place (SJSU finished eighth out of 11 teams that year, the only time it hasn’t been the MW cellar-dweller since joining the league in 2013). But Clarke saw a dead-end at SJSU, so he transferred to Gonzaga, where he led the Zags to the Elite Eight while earning third-team All-American honors after averaging 16.9 points, 8.6 rebounds, 3.1 blocks, 1.9 assists and 1.2 steals per game while shooting 68.7 percent from the field. He’s expected to be a first-round pick in this week’s NBA draft and it’d be a surprise if he doesn’t have a good NBA career.\n\n9. Marcus Banks, UNLV\n\nOne of three players on the list who began his journey in junior college, the Las Vegas native played for two years at Dixie College in St. George, Utah, before transferring to UNLV where he was a two-time All-MW pick (one first team, one second team) and the 2001-02 MW defensive player of the year. The 13th pick in the 2003 draft, Banks logged eight NBA season, averaging 5.9 points, 2.1 assists and 1.5 rebounds per game. While his defense didn’t rate highly in the advanced metrics, NBA star Allen Iverson said the 6-2, 200-pound Banks was the . Banks accumulated 6.6 wins shares in his pro career, which lasted 348 games with five teams.\n\n8. Jason Smith, Colorado State\n\nSmith spent three seasons in Fort Collins, earning the freshman of the year award followed by a pair of first-team All-MW selections. The 7-foot, 240-pound center averaged 14.7 points, 7.9 rebounds, two assists and 1.7 blocks per game in his college career, shooting 54.8 percent from the field. The 20th pick of the 2007 draft, Smith is still an active NBA player having just logged his 12th season in the league with stops with six teams. He’s averaged 6.1 points and 3.4 rebounds in the NBA while shooting 46.8 percent from the field and racking up 14.1 win shares. If we learn anything from this list, it's being a capably skilled 7-footer is a good way to carve out a niche in the NBA.\n\n7. Tony Snell, New Mexico\n\nTony Snell was a fairly unheralded three-star recruit coming out of high school who developed into a first-round pick during his time at New Mexico. Snell’s only All-MW honor was a third-team award in 2012-13, the year he also was the MW Tournament MVP, but his length (the 6-7 wing has a 7-foot wing span) and shooting ability (he hit 38 percent of his threes as a Lobo) made him the 20th pick of the 2013 draft following his junior season. Snell has been a rotation player during his six NBA seasons, averaging 6.2 points and 2.4 rebounds on 42.5 percent shooting, including 38.2 percent from three, in 442 games (218 starts). Snell hasn’t become a star, but he’s had a solid career for a 20th overall pick.\n\n6. Tyler Johnson, Fresno State\n\nPerhaps the most unlikely entry on this list, Johnson was a solid player at Fresno State who earned second-team All-MW honors as a senior with the Bulldogs. But few would have guessed he had an NBA future, especially one at the level at which he has played. Johnson went undrafted in 2014 but stuck with the Miami Heat as a key rotation player who just finished his fifth season in the NBA (he was traded to the Suns at this year’s deadline). While Johnson has put up solid numbers (11 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 2.5 apg), he’s more known for the gigantic contract he signed in the summer of 2016 when he inked a four-year, $50 million deal that makes him the fourth-highest-paid player on this list (behind our top three).\n\n5. Larry Nance Jr., Wyoming\n\nNance overcame a torn ACL that ended his junior season – not to mention he has Crohn's disease – to have a special career in Wyoming, which he led to a MW Tournament title and NCAA Tournament berth as a senior in 2014-15. Nance developed from a lightly used freshmen into a two-time All-MW first-team pick as a junior and senior when he averaged 15.8 points, 7.9 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.3 steals per game over those years. He was the 27th pick in the 2015 draft and has been good in his five NBA seasons (7.7 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 1.7 apg, 1.3 spg). His 16.4 career win shares in the NBA rank fourth among MW alums, and, barring injury, he still has a decade or so left in his career as a springy 6-9, 230-pound forward with a high basketball IQ.\n\n4. Jimmer Fredette, BYU\n\nIf we ranked solely off a player’s college career, Fredette would top the list. His name is the MW record book 86 times, and he had a ridiculous senior season when he won the Wooden Award and was a consensus All-American. The three-time All-MW first-team pick is the conference's all-time leading scorer and ranks fourth in assists. He averaged 28.9 points and 4.3 assists as a senior and has three of the top four scoring games in MW history, including the top two (52 and 49 points). He was the 10th pick in the 2011 draft, although his NBA success has been muted (6.0 ppg on 40.9 percent shooting over 241 games). After a successful stint in China, Fredette returned to the NBA this season, so his story isn’t over.\n\n3. Danny Granger, New Mexico\n\nAfter two years at Bradley, Granger transferred to New Mexico, citing discord with Braves coach Jim Les. Their loss was New Mexico’s gain as Granger was a two-time first-team All-MW pick, although he never won conference player of the year despite two highly productive seasons. He averaged 19.1 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.8 blocks while shooting 51 percent from the field, including 39.2 percent from three during his two years at New Mexico. Granger was the 17th pick of the 2005 draft and was a rising star until his knees gave out. Still, Granger is one of two MW players to become an NBA All-Star when he averaged 25.8 points per game with the Indiana Pacers in 2008-09. He capped his 10-year career with averages of 16.8 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game.\n\n2. Andrew Bogut, Utah\n\nBogut had a special two-year career at Utah where he averaged 16.6 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.6 blocks per game while shooting 60.3 percent from the field. He was the 2004-05 Wooden Award winner (one of two in conference history), was a consensus All-American (one of two in conference history) and was the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft (one of two in conference history). In 14 NBA seasons, Bogut has been named to the all-rookie team, the all-defensive team and was third-team All-NBA in 2009-10 (one of two in the conference to make the All-NBA squad). He won an NBA title with the Warriors in 2014-15 and holds NBA career averages of 9.6 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game.\n\n1. Kawhi Leonard, San Diego State\n\nWas there any doubt? There shouldn’t have been. Leonard is now an all-time NBA great who has worked his way onto the list of top-25 players in basketball history. He’s a two-time NBA Finals MVP, leading two different teams to a championship. He is one of three players to earn finals MVP honors with two franchises, joining LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Leonard was a top 50-ish recruit coming out of high school. At SDSU, he developed into a stud, earning All-American honors as a sophomore while leading the Aztecs to a No. 4 national ranking and a Sweet 16 berth. He was the No. 15 pick in the 2011 NBA draft and is a three-time All-NBA player and two-time NBA defensive player of the year. It will be tough for any future MW player to top Leonard.\n\n13 more considered: Derrick Jones, UNLV; Anthony Bennett, UNLV; Patrick McCaw, UNLV; Lou Amundson, UNLV; Caleb Martin, Nevada; Chandler Hutchison, Boise State; Malcolm Thomas, San Diego State; Alex Kirk, New Mexico; Cameron Bairstow, New Mexico; Britton Johnsen, Utah; J.R.
