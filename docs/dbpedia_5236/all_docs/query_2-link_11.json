The Utes then head to the Pepsi Center in Denver, Colo., for the 2004 Mountain West Conference Tournament, March 11-13.\n\nQuickly On Utah\n\nThe two teams tied for second place in the Mountain West Conference meet as Utah (20-7, 8-4 MWC) takes on Brigham Young (20-7, 8-4 MWC) on Monday at 10:00 p.m. (MST) at the Marriott Center in Provo, Utah. The game will be televised as a part of ESPN's \"Big Monday\" and broadcast on KALL-700 AM and the Utah Sports Network.\n\nThe Utes had their 15-game homecourt winning streak snapped last Saturday afternoon with a 59-57 loss to Air Force.

Two of the years the Utes failed to get 20 wins, Majerus did not coach the entire season. The last time Majerus missed games was in 2000-01 when Utah finished 19-12.\n\nUtah's 20-win seasons at Utah since the beginning of the 90s: 1990-91 (30-4), 1991-92 (24-11), 1992-93 (24-7), 1994-95 (28-6), 1995-96 (27-7), 1996-97 (29-4), 1997-98 (30-4), 1998-99 (28-5), 1999-2000 (23-9), 2001-02 (21-9), 2002-03 (25-8), 2003-04 (20-7).\n\nFrom The Training Room\n\nSophomore center Chris Jackson had surgery for a herniated disk in his back on Wednesday and is out for the rest of the season. Jackson reaggravated the injury during the team's shootaround before the Colorado State game on Feb. 14 and was unable to play in the last four games.\n\nScouting Brigham Young\n\nThe Cougars are 18-7 overall and tied for second place in the Mountain West Conference with an 8-4 record. BYU is 12-0 at home this season and has won 17 in a row in the Marriott Center, which is tied for seventh-best streak in the nation. The Utes handed the Cougars their last loss at home, 79-75 last season on Jan. 25.\n\nLast weekend the Cougars swept a pair of home games to draw even with the Utes in the MWC standings. BYU defeated New Mexico (88-71) on Saturday and Air Force (67-61) on Monday. BYU is riding a six-game winning streak-all in conference play-getting four of the six wins in the Marriott Center.\n\nSenior center Rafael Araujo (6-11, 280) is one of four players in the Mountain West averaging a double-double, ranking second in the conference in scoring (18.4 ppg) and third in rebounds (10.1 rpg). He also ranks ninth in the league in blocked shots (23), second in steals (40), sixth in field goal percentage (57.0) and 14th in free throw percentage (72.1). Senior forward/guard Mark Bigelow (6-7, 195) ranks 10th in the MWC scoring (13.7 ppg) and fifth in free throw percentage (80.0), and is second on the team in rebounding (3.7 rpg). Junior guard Mike Hall (6-3, 205) is 15th in the MWC in scoring (12.5 ppg), 11th in free throw percentage (75.7) and fourth in steals (37).

Last season, Cleveland guided BYU to a 23-9 overall record, the first round of the NCAA Tournament, and a share of the MWC regular-season title with an 11-3 mark.\n\nAfter two losing campaigns, he guided the Cougars to back-to-back 20-win seasons in 1999-2000 (22-11) and 2000-01 (24-9). In 2000-01 with a 24-9 overall record and a 10-4 mark in MWC play, Cleveland took BYU to its first NCAA Tournament since 1995, its first conference regular season title since 1993 and its first conference tournament championship since 1992. Cleveland has taken BYU to the NIT in 2000 (third round) and 2002 (second round).\n\nBefore taking over at BYU, Cleveland was the head coach at Fresno City College.\n\nUtah-BYU Series Notes\n\n* Utah and BYU meet for the 236th time on Monday. The Utah vs. BYU series ranks 10th among NCAA Division I rivalries in number of games played.\n\n* The Cougars are the Utes' oldest rivals in a series that dates back to a 32-9 win by BYU on Jan. 23, 1909 in Provo, Utah.\n\n* The Utes lead the all-time series 119-116, winning three in a row and 17 of the last 20 meetings. Utah took the first game this season, 64-56, on Jan. 31 in the Huntsman Center. The U. swept the season series in 2002-03, getting a 79-75 win on Jan. 25 in Provo, Utah, and a 71-64 win on Feb. 24 in Salt Lake City. In addition to the Jan. 31 victory, Kerry Rupp also led Utah to the win in Provo last season while Rick Majerus attended Andre Miller's stepfather's funeral.\n\n* In conference regular season play, Utah has a 116-110 edge.\n\n* In Provo, the Cougars lead 64-46. BYU had won two in a row over the Utes in the Marriott Center before the Utes recorded a 79-75 triumph last season on Jan. 25.\n\nLast Meeting\n\nAndrew Bogut scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half last to lead Utah back from a 17-point deficit and beat Brigham Young 64-56 on Jan. 31 in the Utes' first game without head coach Rick Majerus. Nick Jacobson also scored 21 for the Utes, hitting 5-of-8 three-pointers.\n\nJacobson, one of just two Utah seniors, dribbled out the clock and heaved the ball toward BYU's basket after the buzzer in celebration of Utah's 10th straight home win over the rival Cougars.\n\nThe Utes, playing for the first time this season under interim head coach Kerry Rupp, were erratic in the first half, then settled down in the second to outscore the Cougars 45-22. Utah held BYU to 3-of-8 shooting in the final 20 minutes.\n\nMark Bigelow led the Cougars with 22 points. Garner Meads added 10 points for BYU, which has not won at Utah since a 64-62 victory Jan. 8, 1994. The Cougars were heading toward snapping the 10-year skid with a 34-19 halftime lead, but Utah started hitting shots and outhustling the Cougars on the boards in a thrilling comeback.\n\nAfter falling behind 36-19 early in the second half on a layup by Mike Hall, the Utes used an 8-0 run to get back into it and revive the home crowd. Bogut hit a three-pointer, Richard Chaney tipped in a rebound and Tim Drisdom converted a three-point play to get Utah back within single digits.\n\nBogut took over from there, scoring eight straight for Utah to get the Utes to 40-34 with 14:31 remaining. He also had 12 rebounds. Jacobson's three-pointer after an offensive rebound made it 44-39, and the Utes kept cutting into the lead.\n\nBogut went 1-for-2 from the line after drawing Rafael Araujo's fourth foul with 8:59 remaining to trim it to 46-42, then put back an offensive rebound to make it a two-point game. Meads missed a free throw for BYU before Jacobson hit a long three-pointer with 7:16 remaining to give Utah its first lead at 52-50. Jacobson then added another trey and Drisdom followed with one from beyond the arc as the Utes pulled away for good.\n\nThe Old Oquirrh Bucket\n\nSaturday's game concludes the competition for the Old Oquirrh Bucket in 2003-04; however, the Utes have already secured the trophy for this season. The Old Oquirrh Bucket, named after the Oquirrh Mountains to the west of Salt Lake City, is the symbol of in-state basketball supremacy in Utah. The trophy is awarded every year to the in-state college team (Utah, BYU, Southern Utah, Utah State and Weber State) which has the best win-loss record against in-state competition.\n\nSo far this season Utah is 4-0, BYU is 2-2, Utah State is 2-1, Weber State is 1-3 and Southern Utah is 0-3. Including this season, Utah has won the Old Oquirrh Bucket 13 times since its inception in 1974-75, including the last two seasons. The Utes also claimed the trophy six years in a row from 1994-95 through 1999-2000.\n\nJacobson Stroking \"J\"s\n\nSenior guard Nick Jacobson (6-4, 206) has been named first team All-District 13 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) this season. He leads the Utes in scoring (16.3 ppg), hitting 44.3 percent (74-of-167) from beyond the arc and 84.3 percent from the free throw line. He has had eleven 20-point games this season.\n\n* In the NCAA statistical rankings released Feb. 24, Jacobson was 13th in three-point field goal percentage (44.3), 49th in free throw percentage (84.3) and 50th in three-point field goals per game (2.7).\n\n* He has scored in double figures in 11 of 12 Mountain West Conference games-including the first nine before getting eight points against Wyoming on Feb. 16. In the MWC league games only stats, Jacobson is averaging 18.8 points per game to rank third in the league, first in three-pointers made per game (3.00), ninth in three-point percentage (41.4) and second in free throw percentage (86.5).\n\n* Jacobson has scored at least 20 points in 10 of the last 18 games-including both games last weekend. His last 20-point game came with a career-high tying 28 points (11-17 FG, 6-11 3-FG) in 33 minutes against New Mexico on Monday. Jacobson also had 22 points (7-16 FG, 4-9 3-FG, 4-4 FT) in 40 minutes against Air Force last Saturday.\n\n* He established his career-high of 28 points against Weber State on Jan. 3, hitting 8-of-12 field goals, 5-of-7 threes and 7-of-7 free throws in 39 minutes.\n\n* Jacobson has already climbed into 13th place in career scoring at Utah with 1,513 points, ranking behind Michael Doleac (1,519 points). He is one of just 30 players in the 1,000-point club.\n\n* A prolific shooter from long range, Jacobson ranks first at Utah in both career three-pointers made (262) and attempted (610), passing Keith Van Horn for the top spot in both categories this season. His career three-point percentage of 43.0 ranks fourth all-time.\n\n* On the single season charts, Jacobson's 2003-04 numbers rank second in three-pointers made (74) and third in three-pointers attempted (167).\n\nBoasting Of Bogut\n\nFreshman forward Andrew Bogut (6-10, 233) has been named second team All-District 13 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) this season. Bogut is second on the team in scoring (12.6 ppg), and is first in both rebounding (10.0 rpg) and blocked shots (38). He is shooting 61.6 percent from the field.\n\n* In the NCAA statistical rankings released on Feb. 24, Bogut was eighth in field goal percentage (61.6) and 15th in rebounds per game (10.0).\n\n* In the last five games, Bogut has averaged 15.8 points and 10.2 rebounds per game with 16 blocked shots. He has also shot 63.0 percent from the field and 73.3 percent at the free throw line.\n\n* Bogut is one of four players in the Mountain West Conference averaging a double-double.\n\n* He has 13 double-doubles this season-including six in 12 conference games. Bogut has already broken the Mountain West freshman record of eight double-doubles set by Tom Bellairs of Air Force in 1999-2000. Most recently, Bogut doubled-up against New Mexico with 20 points and 14 rebounds. It was the third 20-point game of his career.\n\n* Bogut has 19 double-figure scoring games and 15 double-figure rebound games. He has scored in double-figures 15 of the last 20 games.\n\n* On the Ute freshman charts, Bogut ranks fourth in points (341), third in scoring average (12.6 ppg), second in rebounds (271), second in rebounding average (10.0 rpg), fourth in field goals made (141), first in field goal percentage (61.6) and second in blocked shots (38).\n\n* On the Ute single-season charts, Bogut is eighth in blocked shots (38).\n\nFrost Bouncing Back From Back Injury In Final Season\n\nSenior center Tim Frost (6-9, 244) established himself as a strong interior presence in his first season with the Utes, earning second team all-Mountain West honors in 2002-03. However, Frost has been dealing with a sore back since the start of fall training, missing the first month of practice and the first game of the regular season. He has missed four games in all due to the injury, but has started the last 12 games.\n\n* Currently, Frost is fourth on the team in scoring average (8.5 ppg) and third in rebounding average (4.3 rpg).\n\n* Frost has scored in double figures in nine of the last 18 games he's played. He most recently had 14 points (5-8 FG, 0-1 3-FG, 4-4 FT) and six rebounds in 29 minutes against New Mexico on Monday.\n\n* He had a season-high 19 points (7-11 FG, 4-6 3-FG, 1-2 FT) in 29 minutes against Wyoming on Feb. 16.\n\n* In Mountain West Conference games, Frost is averaging 9.5 points and 4.1 rebounds per game in 27.8 minutes.\n\nGame #27 Rewind\n\nNick Jacobson, the school's all-time leader in three-point shooting, made six shots from beyond the arc and tied his career-high with 28 points to lead Utah past New Mexico 73-43 Monday night in Salt Lake City.\n\nIn his final regular-season home game, Jacobson made three-pointers on three consecutive possessions in the second half to run his Utah record to 262. The fifth-year senior tied his season-high mark of six three-pointers in a game as the Utes (20-7, 8-4 MWC) reached 20 wins for the 12th time in the last 15 seasons.\n\nAndrew Bogut scored 20 points and had 14 rebounds and Tim Frost added 14 points as Utah shot 53 percent from the field, the Utes' best mark in their last 11 games.\n\nThe Utes completed their home schedule with a 15-1 record and avoided their first back-to-back home losses since 1989 after losing to Air Force 59-57 on Saturday.\n\nDespite playing his second straight subpar game, Danny Granger led the Lobos (13-11, 4-7 MWC) with 12 points as they dropped their 25th straight road game. Granger, the conference's leading scorer, had a season-low nine points at BYU last Saturday and was just 4-of-11 as the Utes seemed determined not to let Granger repeat his 28 point performance when the Lobos beat Utah 70-54 on January 24.\n\nJavin Tindall scored 10 points for New Mexico, which managed just 33 percent shooting and made just 7-of-17 from the line.\n\nJacobson capped a 12-2 run to end the first half with a layup and then left a lasting impression with his second-half marksmanship. The third of his three straight three-pointers gave Utah a 65-32 lead with 7:38 to play. He and Frost, the team's only juniors or seniors, came out of the game to standing ovations with over five minutes left.\n\nUte Items\n\n* Utah has shot 50 percent or better from the field in 11 games this season, going 10-1. The Utes had their best shooting percentage in the last 11 games against New Mexico on Monday, hitting 52.9 percent.\n\n* Utah ranked 20th in the NCAA in field goal percentage (48.2) as of Feb. 24. Utah has shot 48.9 percent from the field over the last 18 games.The Utes broke a string of 12 consecutive games of shooting at least 40 percent from the field against San Diego State on Feb. 7-it was the first game Utah won this season when being outshot (41.7 to 39.0 percent). Since then Utah hasn't shot under 43 percent in the last five games.\n\n* The Utes are 17-1 when scoring at least 60 points this season with their only loss coming to Wyoming (74-65) on Feb. 16. Utah is 14-1 when holding its opponents to under 60 points with its only loss coming to Air Force (59-57) on Feb. 21.\n\n* The Utes have lost back-to-back games three times this season. Utah has not lost three consecutive games since Jan. 20-29, 2001 when Dick Hunsaker was the acting head coach.\n\n* Against Air Force on Feb. 21, it was the first time this season Utah lost when leading at the half and with 5:00 remaining.\n\nGetting Defensive\n\nOne of the trademarks of a Utah team during the last 15 years has been a stifling half-court defense. Since 1989-90, Utah has ranked in the top 30 in the nation 11 times in scoring defense, nine times in rebound margin, eight times in field goal percentage defense and eight times in scoring margin.\n\n* In the NCAA statistical rankings released on Feb. 24, Utah ranked second in the nation in scoring defense (56.4 ppg), 33rd in field goal percentage defense (40.1) and fifth in rebound margin (+7.9 rpg).\n\n* The Utes have outrebounded 24 of 27 opponents this season and are 20-4 when they have the advantage on the boards. Utah had outrebounded 15 teams in a row before Wyoming posted a 37-33 advantage on the Utes on Feb. 16. The Utes have since outrebounded their last two opponents.\n\n* Utah has held 15 of its 27 opponents to lower than 40 percent shooting from the field and 13 teams to under 30 percent from three-point range. Savannah State shot 18.2 percent against the Utes on Dec. 13, which is the lowest mark for a Utah opponent all-time.\n\n* Only 11 of 27 teams have reached 60 points against the Utes and 10 opponents have been held to under 50 points this season.\n\n* Only four times has Utah allowed a team to shoot better than 50 percent from the field this season: UConn (62.3), New Mexico on Jan. 24 (53.5), Air Force (55.3) on Jan. 26 and Air Force (54.3) on Feb. 21.\n\n* Utah has not allowed an opponent to score 80 points in 122 consecutive games that have ended in regulation. The last team to score 80 points on the Utes in a 40-minute game was Wyoming (88) on Feb. 28, 2000 in Laramie, Wyo.\n\nFrom Beyond The Arc\n\nUtah has connected on at least 40 percent of its three-point field goals in 15 games this season-including 10 of the last 17-winning all of but one of them (Air Force on Jan. 26). Conversely, when the Utes shoot under 40 percent from beyond the arc, they are 6-6.\n\n* In the NCAA statistical rankings released on Feb. 24, Utah ranked 14th in three-point field goal percentage (39.7).\n\n* The Utes have hit at least half of their three-point tries six times this season: Southern Utah (57.9) with a season-best percentage, Colorado State on Feb. 14 (53.3), UNLV on Jan. 12 (53.8), Pepperdine (51.9) with a season-high 27 attempts, Colorado (50.0) and Stony Brook (50.0).\n\nUtah Highest Season\n\nThree-Point Percentage\n\n1. .440 1987-882. .410 1992-933. .405 2001-024. .404 1989-905. .397 2003-046. .396 1993-94\n\nUtah Under Kerry Rupp\n\nHere's a statistical breakdown of what Utah has done in seven games (5-2) under interim head coach Kerry Rupp.\n\nPPG FG% 3FG% FT% Rebs AS/TOUtah 67.7 47.0 37.7 76.1 37.0 1.0Opponents 59.9 39.4 32.5 71.0 28.0 0.9"
