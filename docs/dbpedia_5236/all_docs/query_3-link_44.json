        "text": "Araujo started his basketball career at Arizona Western College. He dominated during his 2 years at the junior college before transferring to Brigham Young University (BYU) for his junior and senior seasons. Araujo earned the Mountain West Conference Player of the Year award his senior season, averaging 18 ppg and 10 rpg.\n\nAraujo entered into the 2004 NBA Draft and was selected 8th overall by the Toronto Raptors. Araujo spent two disappointing seasons in Toronto, starting 75 games and averaging close to 3 points and 3 rebounds per game. In 2006, the Raptors traded Araujo to the Utah Jazz. Araujo did not fare any better while in Utah, posting only 2.5 ppg and 2.5 rpg in 28 games for the Jazz. The Jazz did not sign Araujo in the off-season and his NBA career was finished after only three seasons.\n\nIn 2007, Araujo signed a one-year deal to play for Spartak St. Petersburg in Russia. After one year in Russia, Araujo decided to try to get back into the NBA. He took part in the Minnesota Timberwolves training camp in 2008 but was waived before the start of the season. After failing to return to the NBA, Araujo returned to playing overseas. He signed with Flamengo in Brazil for the 2009 season. After one season with Flamengo, Araujo signed with another Brazilian team, Paulistano. He played one season for Paulistano before signing a two-year deal to play with his old team Flamengo. Araujo only played one season for Flamengo before he decided to forego his second season and instead signed with Franca Basquetebol Clube, also in Brazil."
