        "text": "Stephenie Meyer (née Morgan; ; born December 24, 1973) is an American novelist and film producer, best known for her vampire romance series Twilight. The Twilight novels have sold over 100 million copies, with translations into 37 different languages. Meyer was the bestselling author of 2008 and 2009 in the US, having sold over 29 million books in 2008, and 26.5 million in 2009. Twilight was the best-selling book of 2008 in the US.Meyer was ranked No. 49 on Time magazine's list of the \"100 Most Influential People in 2008\", and was included in the Forbes Celebrity 100 list of the world's most powerful celebrities in 2009, entering at No. 26. Her annual earnings exceeded $50 million. In 2010, Forbes ranked her as the No. 59 most powerful celebrity with annual earnings of $40 million.\n\nHarvey Fletcher (September 11, 1884 – July 23, 1981) was an American physicist. Known as the \"father of stereophonic sound,\" he is credited with the invention of the 2-A audiometer and an early electronic hearing aid. He was an investigator into the nature of speech and hearing, and made contributions in acoustics, electrical engineering, speech, medicine, music, atomic physics, sound pictures, and education.\n\nPhilo Taylor Farnsworth (August 19, 1906 – March 11, 1971) was an American inventor and television pioneer. He made many crucial contributions to the early development of all-electronic television. He is best known for his 1927 invention of the first fully functional all-electronic image pickup device (video camera tube), the image dissector, as well as the first fully functional and complete all-electronic television system. Farnsworth developed a television system complete with receiver and camera—which he produced commercially through the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation from 1938 to 1951, in Fort Wayne, Indiana.In later life, Farnsworth invented a small nuclear fusion device, the Farnsworth–Hirsch fusor, employing inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC). It was not a practical device for generating nuclear power, though it provides a viable source of neutrons. The design of this device has been the inspiration for other fusion approaches, including the Polywell reactor concept. Farnsworth held 300 patents, mostly in radio and television.\n\nEarl Wesley Bascom (June 19, 1906 – August 28, 1995) was an American painter, printmaker, rodeo performer and sculptor, raised in Canada, who portrayed his own experiences cowboying and rodeoing across the American and Canadian West. Bascom was awarded the Pioneer Award by the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 2016 and inducted into the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame in 1984.\n\nRoger Billings is a scientist known for his high-tech innovations in the fields of energy, computer networking, cybersecurity, and education. As a student in high school, he invented the hydrogen car.Billings is the creator of the Acellus Learning System, which has been described as a scholastic \"equalizer\" for students that are falling behind academically.Billings is also the CEO and Chairman of Billings Energy Corporation, a company focused on the development of hydrogen energy technologies. The company is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. The company plans to build upon privately funded research and development efforts conducted over the past ten years to bring to market commercial hydrogen energy applications. Billings is the author of two books on hydrogen energy technology, Hydrogen from Coal: A Cost Estimation Guidebook (1983) and Hydrogen World View (1991), and the co-author of a technical networking book, WideBand Networking (2000). He has also authored numerous technical papers on hydrogen energy and on computer networking, including reports on his nano-latency data transfer research and development projects in conjunction with the US military, published in the SPIE conference proceedings."
