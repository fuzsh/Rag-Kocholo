        "text": "Personal Statement\n\nI grew up in Norway swimming, not becauseÂ weÂ were a family of swimmers, but because we were not!â¯ My dad was close to drowning when he was very young and I think because of that I started in swimming at 6 years old.â¯ It quickly became my love and passion;â¯itÂ was a pleasure, to just beÂ swimming then and still today.â¯Â I remember my parents always had to drag me out of the water, they still do. â¯I just love swimming.â¯â¯Then when I was 10 years old a coach saw me in the water and considered my potential.Â Â That is when I started to seriously train for swimming.â¯â¯Â\n\nIn Norway we have schools for Top Athletes and that is the school I currently attend near Oslo, Norway.â¯ Unique is that my school combines special training and strong academics for bothÂ gifted athletesÂ andÂ goodÂ students. â¯â¯The training at the Wang School isÂ one reason I will make a great candidate for the USA colleges.Â Â â¯Â\n\nLike in the USA, I swim for a club team and my coach isÂ from Hungary, his name isÂ Istvan.Â From him I have learned a hard work ethic and he constantly pushes me to do better.Â Â I actually love swimming moreÂ nowÂ than as a youth.Â Â As a competitive swimmer, I have excellent technique and have always had good results.â¯Â\n\nAs a NorwegianÂ swimmer IÂ haveÂ revived manyÂ national medals.â¯ It is a great honor to have represented Norway in the Nordic Championships in 2015 and 2016 where IÂ won oneÂ individual bronze,Â twoÂ silver medals, and yet another bronze medal in the relay.â¯ I will soon have more metals as I continue to competeÂ for NorwayÂ in 2018.Â\n\nIn addition to my school and club training, I have beenÂ fortunateÂ enough to have had training from talented coaches all over the world including:Â\n\n- Four USA Peak Performance Swim camps with 1992 Olympic Swimming Coach, Nick Baker.Â\n\n- 2017 Monterey Bay swim club in Monterey, California for NCAA advanced training.Â\n\n- Team Pittsburgh Aquatic - Trees Pool, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Â\n\n- Trained with various coaches in Turkey,Â Spain, Sweden,Â Denmark, Hungary and here in Norway.Â Â\n\nThis global training has given me moreÂ vision,Â skill, love and a deeper passion for swimming.Â\n\nMyÂ currentÂ academicÂ goal is toÂ obtain aÂ BachelorâsÂ of Science degree in CriminologyÂ from a USAÂ CollegeÂ or University.â¯Â Â\n\nManyÂ teachers andÂ coachesÂ say that I have an ability to see what they are teaching and adapt quickly. â¯Since I am bi-lingual and have learned to understand and work with coaches, teachers and students from around the world - I feel I can quickly adapt to college life in the USA.Â Â No matter where I swim,Â my coachesÂ love to work with me because my desire to learn andÂ myÂ enjoyment of swimming infectious to my teammates.Â Â\n\nâ¯I want to swim fast so I can make my university, coach,Â team andÂ my country proud.\n\nCamilla R"
