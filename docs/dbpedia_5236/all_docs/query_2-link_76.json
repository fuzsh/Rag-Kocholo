        "text": "DENVER — The temptation was to snicker or scoff. Or perhapseven chuckle at the notion.\n\nThe San Diego State men’s basketball program limped to thefinish line, losing its final three regular-season games by acombined 37 points. Yet, there was Aztecs coach Steve Fisherearlier this week proclaiming that his beleaguered squad just mightdefeat Utah today in the opening round of the Mountain WestConference tournament at the Pepsi Center.\n\nYes, the same Utah team that obliterated the Aztecs at Cox Arenalast Saturday.\n\n“That’s 35 years in the business and believing in a group ofguys that I have seen play well,” said Fisher, explaining hisreasoning. “I have been with other teams that when the least isexpected, the most is given.\n\n“I’m hopeful that’s what we’ll see in Denver. This is not pie inthe sky. I genuinely believe that we’re going to play well and, byplaying well, we’ll have a chance to win. I will not guarantee awin, but we will have a chance to win.”\n\nHaving a chance will qualify as progress. The sixth-seededAztecs (14-15) are playing their worst basketball of the season ata time when teams need to play their best.\n\nThird-seeded Utah (21-8) couldn’t have asked for a betterfirst-round pairing. Not only have the Utes beaten the Aztecs twicethis season, but they have won 26 of the past 28 meetings.\n\nInterim Utah coach Kerry Rupp may be new to fielding questionsfrom the media but he sounds like a veteran when it comes totalking up an opponent.\n\n“This will be a very, very stiff challenge,” Rupp said. “They’rea very, very good team. We were very fortunate to win down there.It’s a new season and the beginning of the tournament is likestarting over again.”\n\nSomebody mention starting over? Now that’s something the Aztecswould like to do. They started the season by exceeding expectationsand once sat pretty with an 11-6 record.\n\nBut the shine has turned into scuff marks as the Aztecs havelost nine of their past 12 games.\n\nAt one point, an NIT berth appeared likely. Now the only routeto postseason play is to win the Mountain West tourney and claimthe league’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\n\n“Our backs are so much against the wall there is no more room toback up,” said Aerick Sanders, whose college career ends with theAztecs’ next defeat. “We are just trying to go out there taking itone game at a time. I don’t want to be remembered as a guy who wasgood but didn’t lead his team to postseason play.”\n\nWinning three games in Denver would rank as a monumentalachievement for the Aztecs. They have won only three games awayfrom Cox Arena all season; two in November’s Maui Invitational; theother at the University of San Diego on Dec. 3.\n\nThey went 0-7 on the road in conference play and have lost 10consecutive road games.\n\n“We haven’t been able to put a three-game winning streaktogether away from home,” said freshman forward Marcus Slaughter,”so if we are going to start one this would be the perfect time tostart.”\n\nThe winner of today’s contest plays the winner of the gamebetween No. 2 Brigham Young and No. 7 Wyoming. Air Force, ranked25th nationally, is the top seed. The Falcons are on the other sideof the bracket.\n\nTwo years ago, the Aztecs were a surprise winner of theconference tournament and advanced to the NCAA tournament. Thatsquad, led by Randy Holcomb and Al Faux, was playing the bestbasketball in the league heading into the tourney.\n\nThat’s not the case with this year’s Aztecs.\n\n“If you had to, with truthfulness, say who’s playing the bestand rank them one through eight, we’d be ranked eighth in terms ofwho’s playing the best right now,” Fisher said. “I’m more worriedabout who’s going to play the best on Thursday, and I believe we’regoing to play like gangbusters on Thursday.”\n\nMountain West Conference men’s tournament\n\nAt The Pepsi Center\n\nDenver\n\nFirst Round\n\nThursday\n\nUtah vs. San Diego State, noon\n\nBrigham Young vs. Wyoming, 2:30 p.m.\n\nAir Force vs. Colorado State, 6 p.m.\n\nUNLV vs. New Mexico, 9 p.m.\n\nSemifinals\n\nFriday\n\nUtah-San Diego State winner vs. Brigham Young-Wyoming winner, 6p.m.\n\nAir Force-Colorado State winner vs. UNLV-New Mexico winner, 9p.m.\n\nChampionship\n\nSaturday\n\nSemifinal winners, 7 p.m.\n\nMWC TOURNAMENT\n\nMountain West Conference men’s basketball teams, listed in orderof tournament seeding:\n\n1.

Expect the senior sharpshooterto be even more competitive in hopes of finally being part of aconference tournament championship team.\n\n> Why they’ll win: Big men Tim Frost and Andrew Bogut causedouble trouble.\n\n> Why they won’t win: No Rick Majerus.

NEW MEXICO\n\n> Coach: Ritchie McKay\n\n> Record: 14-13, 5-9\n\n> Key player: Danny Granger.

Relentless leader must be attop of his game and avoid early foul trouble.\n\n> Why they’ll win: Early-season success dictates that athree-game winning streak is possible when this team clicks on allcylinders.\n\n> Why they won’t win: It’s been three months since the Aztecslast won away from Cox Arena and that victory, against theUniversity of San Diego, didn’t even include a plane flight.\n\n7. WYOMING\n\n> Coach: Steve McClain\n\n> Record: 11-16, 4-10\n\n> Key player: Jay Straight. Athletic guard ranks amongconference’s top five in points, assists and steals.\n\n> Why they’ll win: Denver’s Pepsi Center, within drivingdistance of Laramie, Wyo., will provide a huge advantage for aprogram that regularly has traveled 5,000-plus fans to Las Vegasfor past conference tournaments.\n\n> Why they won’t win: Much better Wyoming teams have annuallycollapsed in the tournament.\n\n8. COLORADO STATE\n\n> Coach: Dale Layer\n\n> Record: 12-15, 4-10\n\n> Key player: Matt Nelson.
