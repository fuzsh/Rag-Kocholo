        "text": "Beginning in April 2024, BYU-Idaho and Ensign College will offer three-year bachelor's degrees through BYU-Pathway Worldwide! Students will be able to complete an online degree with just 90-96 credits. The new degrees, approved by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), preserve all required major and general education courses while eliminating elective credits. \"Students served by BYU–Pathway typically are first-generation college students who work full-time and often struggle to make ends meet,” said Brian K. Ashton, BYU-Pathway Worldwide president. “They need options that help them earn a degree as efficiently as possible. The new degree structure increases the likelihood of graduation while preserving all learning outcomes to prepare them for jobs and careers.\""
