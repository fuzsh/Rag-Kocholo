The Sao Paulo, Brazil, native averaged 31.5 points and 15.5 rebounds, while shooting 71.4 percent from the floor and 76.7 percent from the free-throw line in BYU’s victories at Boise State (75-69) and in the Delta Center against 25th-ranked Oklahoma State (76-71).\n\nCross Country\n\nBYU senior Michaela Mannova, ’04, was one of four female athletes nominated for the 2003–04 Cross Country Honda Sports Award. This award is given to top female athletes in Division I cross country programs who have demonstrated academic excellence, superior athletic ability, leadership, and service within their communities. In honor of Mannova’s accomplishments, American Honda donated $1,000 to BYU’s women’s athletic fund.\n\nFootball\n\nAfter 15 years as a member of BYU’s coaching staff, co–offensive coordinator Robbie Bosco, ’86, accepted a position in fund-raising with the Cougar Club. Bosco now reports to associate athletic director Thomas A. Holmoe, ’83, a former teammate in the early 1980s. Bosco will meet with prospective donors and assist with operations of the 5,000-member Cougar Club.\n\nWomen’s Volleyball"
