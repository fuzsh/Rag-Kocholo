        "text": "Muhammad Khaznadar\n\nthumb|Muhammad Khaznadar, left, with his father Mustapha Khaznadar Muhammad Khaznadar (1840–1929) was an early archaeologist in Ottoman Tunisia. He was the eldest son of Mustapha Khaznadar, a prominent Prime Minister of Tunisia who served from 1855 until 1873. Khaznadar was the first Tunisian to propose the founding of a museum, located in the Bardo Palace in the town of Manouba just outside Tunis.: \"He became the first Tunisian to propose the founding of a museum. At that point, no “public” museum existed in the regency of Tunisia, except for François Bourgade’s collection of antiquities in the enclosure of the Chapel of Saint-Louis in Carthage. Muhammad’s project thus represents a crucial moment in the history of collecting in Tunisia. Notably, the location intended for this museum was not Muhammad’s own house in Carthage, but rather the Bardo Palace, his father’s main residence located in the neighboring town of La Manouba.\" His collection was to form the kernel of the Bardo National Museum. Khaznadar's work also influenced the development of cultural policies in Tunisia in the years leading up to the establishment of the French protectorate in 1881. As a native North African at the forefront of archaeology during the time of European colonialism, he has been compared to the Ottoman Osman Hamdi Bey and the Egyptian Rifa'a at-Tahtawi. Early Life and Education Khaznadar was born into a wealthy family tied to the Tunisian ruling elite. His father, Mustapha Khaznadar, originally from the Greek island of Chios, had risen to become a leading figure in the Tunisian court. Muhammad received an education in Paris, where he was exposed to European culture, history, and archaeology. In Paris, he was a student of Ernest Desjardins. Archaeological Work and Collecting Antiquities After returning to Tunisia in 1865, Khaznadar became involved in the exploration and collection of antiquities. He was the first Tunisian to conduct modern archaeological excavations at Carthage, starting in 1866. His efforts led to the formation of a significant collection of antiquities, including Roman and Punic inscriptions, mosaics, and sculptures. Khaznadar established connections with European scholars and institutions. He communicated his discoveries to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in Paris. However, his growing collection also led to tensions with foreign archaeologists and the French colonial authorities. Parts of his collection were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1867) in Paris and the 1873 Vienna World's Fair. The Founding of the Bardo Museum One of Muhammad Khaznadar's key achievements was his role in the founding of what would later become the Bardo National Museum. In 1866, he proposed the creation of a museum to house Tunisia's antiquities, to be located at the Manouba Palace, the residence of the Tunisian bey. The collection that Khaznadar amassed, including the Khaznadar inscriptions, a notable Bacchus statue, and other significant artifacts, formed the core of the museum's early holdings. German traveller Heinrich von Maltzan described the excitement that had developed around the museum in the late 1860s, describing that it: \"in its specialty, Phoenician and Carthaginian antiquities, surpassed every other museum in the world\": von Maltzen noted that the museum contained more than 120 Punic inscriptions (2/3 Punic and 1/3 neo-Punic) found during Khaznadar's excavations in three different points around the ruins of Carthage. He complained about the limited public access to the museum, such that it had “acquired the mysterious reputation of containing the greatest rarities of pagan and Christian literature”. Khaznadar's refusal to allow scholars to copy the inscriptions was attributed to a concern that \"the value of his museum could be damaged by premature publication of his inscriptions\". Taher Ghalia, Chief Curator of the Bardo, wrote that the foundation of the modern national museum by decree, on 25 March 1885, followed from the 1876-77 “patrimonialization” policy of Hayreddin Pasha, who had succeeded Mustapha Khaznadar as Prime Minister. Hayreddin Pasha regulated archaeological work and ordered “the seizure of Mhammed Khaznadar’s private collection which was acquired fraudulently”.

It has aired since 2005 on TV Nova, and as of 2023 is the longest-running continuous version of Wife Swap in the world. The show follows a similar format to other Wife Swap versions, with two families swapping wives for ten days. LGBT families have also been included. It has caused controversy within the Czech Republic, with some critics saying it takes advantage of families who need the prize money. Notable episodes A 2009 episode swapped a wife from Brno with a wife from a Czech diaspora family in Paraguay. A 2015 episode prompted one of the families to be referred to social services after it was revealed that the children lacked basic hygiene habits such as teeth brushing and hand washing. A wife from a 2017 episode who brought a snake to the table meeting became highly recognizable after she told her partner \"Mačkáš mi hada, debile\" (\"You're squeezing my snake, moron\"). Another 2017 episode caused controversy for featuring a couple with a 17-year-old wife and 45-year-old husband. The pair had met when the wife was 14. The husband was called a \"pedophile\" by the other family's husband at the table meeting. Two episodes ended in brawls between husbands. The first, in 2013, came after one husband accused the other's wife of being lazy. The second, in 2020, involved an abusive husband who pushed around his substitute wife, and her husband attacked him upon hearing the news. Following a taping in 2020, one of the participants, a 42-year-old police officer from the Opava District, committed suicide. The officer's sons alleged that the producers of the show had tried to provoke conflict by repeatedly pressuring him to make racist comments.

History and formation The band Al-Thulathi Al-Marah presented a new style of singing that was admired and accepted by the audience, and their songs are still available to this day. Their songs were distinguished by being suitable for Egyptian occasions, even on a personal level, such as Egyptian weddings, birthdays, and social occasions such as the month of Ramadan. The fame of the funny trio was further enhanced by participating in several shows in collaboration with the Reda Show Troupe. The funny trio mourned many poets of that beautiful era such as Salah Jahin, Morsi Gamil Aziz, Saleh Goudat, and Abdel Fattah Mustafa. Many of the creators of that era composed for them, such as Ali Ismail who appeared in them, as well as Sayed Makkawi, Mohamed El Mougy, Helmy Bakr, Abdel Azim Mohamed, Helmy Amin, Munir Murad, Ahmed Sedky, Abdel Azim Abdel Haq, and from the compositions of the musician Mohamed Abdel Wahab, the trio participated in singing in the musical piece \"The Mamluks\". Band members The band consisted of; Wafaa Mohamed Mustafa. Safaa Youssef Lotfy. Sanaa El Barouni, sister of Sohair El Barouni. They are graduates of the Institute of Arabic Music. History They started to appear through amateur programs that were presented by the Egyptian Radio at that time to introduce new voices and give the opportunity to appear and introduce the audience and the great composers and writers to them. At first, Sanaa and Safaa started as a beautiful duo and worked together for a short period in the garden of the Music Institute where they studied. After that, they met Wafaa, who joined them to be the best trio in singing of this type of singing that they excelled in. From here came the idea to form a joint band that brought them together, as the composer Ali Ismail heard them and admired them and adopted them and called them (the Merry Trio). He is considered the one who composed this new style for them the most in the world of singing. She presented the first paragraph of many concerts, as she always creates an atmosphere of joy and optimism in the concerts she participates in, especially the singing concerts and Ramadan nights that the radio revives, and the late President Gamal Abdel Nasser listened to them more than once during these evenings. The biggest dream for any singer was to have their voice reach listeners through the radio, so Wafaa, Safaa and Sanaa applied to the radio listening committee to obtain a singing license, under the name (The Merry Trio), which is the first time this type of singing has appeared. Brilliance Most of the singing trios that appeared in Egypt were not successful and retired early because they were imitations and copies of the Merry Trio band, and the Merry Trio remained at the forefront and achieved successive successes. The band was dissolved after these years of success, but the trio will remainLathi Al Marah is remembered as the first to present this wonderful type of singing with a fun voice and a distinctive, fun performance that cannot be forgotten to this day. Stopping and retirement The members of the trio decided to retire while they were at the peak of their brilliance and fame, not because of a disagreement between them, but because of marriage. Wafaa went to work in teaching and then moved to an Arab country to work. As for Sanaa, she married the late great director Hassan Al Imam and preferred family stability. Safaa also married director Sami Abu Al Nour. Despite their cessation of continuing their artistic work, a strong friendship remained between them. Works Many musical bands used them and sang with them in several concerts at universities and at weddings. They participated in presenting many concerts in many Arab countries such as Iraq, where they sang several tunes in the Iraqi dialect, the most famous of which is the song \"The Happiest Day\" by the late Iraqi composer Reda Ali. Also, from the Libyan heritage, the band sang \"Ya El Enab\", \"Ya Sagheer Fi Sagheerna\" and \"Taal Yabouna\" recorded in Lebanon from the Libyan heritage. In the early seventies, the fun trio visited Jordan and gave a private concert, which was recorded in the Jordanian TV studios and included most of their beautiful songs. They participated with the brown nightingale Abdel Halim Hafez in the movie (A Day of My Life) in the song (Laughter, Play, Seriousness and Love) with the artist Abdel Salam Al Nabulsi and the artist Zubaida Tharwat. Although their names were not mentioned in the introduction to the movie, they added an atmosphere of vitality and fun to the song and the viewers really liked them. They performed the song (Television) in the introduction to the movie (Young for Love) by Souad Hosni in the mid-sixties. They participated in the (City Lights) concerts where the stage would be filled with applause when the announcer announced, live on air, the start of the (Fun Trio) segment. The merry trio was distinguished by the beautiful voice of each of its members, each one of them had a beautiful voice and this was confirmed by everyone who listened to them in private and family sessions, when Wafaa was humming Fairuz's songs and Safaa was reviving Asmahan's songs and Sanaa was singing Souad Mohamed's songs. Songs The merry trio was able to present many types of singing such as operettas, holiday songs such as Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, Mother's Day (they also sang for the father), Egyptian Radio Day, folk, rural, emotional songs, morning songs, children's songs, wedding songs, patriotic songs, religious songs, songs related to the historical connection between Egypt and Sudan, and songs for various occasions such as the occasion of signing the unity between Egypt and Syria, the anniversary of the July 1952 Revolution, and the occasion of building the High Dam.

It was formed on 6 November 1975, following the 3 November coup d'état led by Brigadier General Khaled Mosharraf, with the deposition of President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad and his supporting military officers who were behind the assassination of the nation's first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family. The country's first chief justice, Sayem was installed as the president. However, following the death of Mosharraf along with several military generals the next day during a counter coup in the aftermath of a civilian-soldier popular uprising, Sayem was left with the responsibility of CMLA (Chief Martial Law Administrator). With the 1st legislative term of the Jatiya Sangsad dissolved, the cabinet was composed of a military junta with the recently promoted chief of army staff war hero Ziaur Rahman, who was forced to resign and put under house arrest by Mosharraf but released and reinstated following the counter coup, chief of naval staff and chief of air staff as the CMLA's deputies. On 26 November 1975, at Bangabhaban the president administered oath to a newly formed council of advisers defacto headed by the junta. He promised a general election in February 1977 in a presidential speech addressed to the nation but in November 1976, with the country in a dire situation with no stability and security, indefinitely postponed it and relinquished his CMLA duty with Zia nominated to succeed. 5 months later on 21 April 1977, when Sayem retired on health grounds, with the office of the vice-president blank Zia took over as acting president. Forty days later he organised a nationwide presidential confidence referendum to legitimise his presidency. In June, the President's special assistant Abdus Sattar was promoted to the office of vice-president and on 9 December, the council of advisers was reorganized with three dismissals and seven new appointments. After coming to power, Zia immediately moved to restore law and order in the country by strengthening the police force, practically doubling its size and arranging for their proper training, as well as order in the armed forces and withdrew the ban on the newspapers inaugurating the free flow of news by making the information media free and without government interference. An ordinance allowing political parties to engage in open politics was promulgated putting an end to the one-party BaKSAL system imposed by Mujibur Rahman months prior to his assassination. Zia organised his own party in February 1978 called the Jatiyotabadi Gonotantrik Dol (\"Nationalist Democratic Party\"), or JaGoDol for short, and in the presidential election – the first direct election – that year, his candidacy was supported by his and five other parties of the nationalist \"Jatiyatabadi Front\".M.

It was fought between Croatia, and SAO Krajina which was supported by the Yugoslav People's Army. The battle ended with a Serbian victory and the taking over of Škabrnja. Timeline The JNA attacked Škabrnja at 7:30 on the morning of 18 November, prompting much of the civilian population to flee. The JNA ground attack commenced at 7:30, supported by SAO Krajina police and TO, as well as volunteers from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The overall commander of the operation was JNA Lieutenant Colonel Momčilo Bogunović of the 180th Motorised Brigade. The attacking force engaged in Škabrnja using tanks deployed to the northwest near the village of Zemunik Gornji, to the northeast near Smilčić and Gornje Biljane, as well as to the southeast along the road connecting Škabrnja and Benkovac. The initial attack involved 28 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and tanks, organized as one tank company, one mechanised company and two TO infantry companies. A part of the force successfully advanced south from Smilčić and had captured the hamlet of Ambar located on the western approach to Škabrnja by 11:30. The HV was forced to retreat towards the centre of the village, but several troops and civilians who stayed behind in the hamlet were captured. Those who managed to pull out from Ambar reported killings of civilians by the JNA. The artillery bombardment of Škabrnja ceased at 12:30, but the Yugoslav Air Force targeted it with cluster bombs, and airlifted elements of the 63rd Parachute Brigade, based at the nearby Zadar Airport, to the outskirts of the village. At 13:30, the HV abandoned Ražovljeva Glavica and retreated to Škabrnja. Until 16:30, the attacking force kept advancing from Ambar towards the centre of Škabrnja using captured civilians and prisoners of war as human shields, until the HV salient was cut off from Zadar. The JNA reported that four of its troops were killed and eight were wounded that day, and paused its advance until the morning. Overnight, the commander of the Škabrnja Independent Battalion, Marko Miljanić, sneaked out of the village and went to Zadar to request reinforcements. Failing to receive any, he ordered the battalion to abandon the village by 6:00. On the morning of 19 November, the JNA pressed on with its advance into the undefended eastern part of Škabrnja and reached Nadin from the west at 14:00. The Croats held out until the JNA captured Nadinska Kosa at 17:30. The SAO Krajina reported two wounded that day. Killings There was also killing of 62 Croatian civilians and five prisoners of war by Serbian Autonomous Oblast Krajina (SAO Krajina) Territorial Defence troops and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in the villages of Škabrnja and Nadin east of Zadar on 18–19 November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre occurred shortly after an agreement to evacuate Zadar's JNA garrison following an increase in fighting between the Croatian National Guard (renamed the Croatian Army in November 1991) and the JNA. Most of the killings were committed by SAO Krajina troops which followed the leading armoured JNA units fighting their way into Škabrnja on 18 November. During the initial attack, the attacking force employed a human shield of captured civilians forced to walk in front of armoured vehicles. Most of the civilian population fled the village and about 120–130 were captured by the JNA and detained in the village school and kindergarten. However, others who took shelter in basements were killed in or just outside their homes. A portion of those killed in the massacre were buried in a mass grave in Škabrnja, while dozens of bodies were turned over to Croatian authorities.

The building, which is the meeting place of Rothwell Town Council, is a Grade I listed building. History The building was commissioned by the lord of the manor, Thomas Tresham, whose seat was at Rushton Hall and who had a passion for strange and unusual buildings. As a recusant Catholic at a time of religious persecution, he spent long periods in prison for his beliefs. Unable to openly practise his faith, he encoded symbols of it into his buildings. The site he selected for the market house was a prominent location on the south side of Market Hill, where the annual Rothwell (or Rowell) Fair took place. The building was designed by John Thorpe in the neoclassical style, built by a local stonemason, William Grumbold, in ashlar stone and was largely completed in 1578. The stone was donated by the Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire, Sir Christopher Hatton. The building was laid out in the shape of a cross, a gesture to his religious beliefs, intended to recall the crucifixion of Jesus. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto Market Hill. The central bay, which was slightly projected forward, featured a round headed opening with imposts and an archivolt flanked by Doric order pilasters supporting an entablature; the bay was blind and flanked by Ionic order pilasters on the first floor. The bays on either side of the central bay originally featured round headed openings; these bays were fenestrated by mullioned and transomed windows on the first floor. A band at first floor level recorded in Latin that: \"This is the work of Sir Thomas Tresham, Knight. He did it for the sake of his beloved native land and county of Northampton but most of all on account of this his neighbouring town\". At roof level, there was an entablature, which was decorated with heraldic devices. There was a round tower in the southeast corner which was at the rear of the building. Although Tresham gave the market house to the town, it was left without a roof at that time, probably because he did not have the funds to complete it. In the late 16th century, Tresham commissioned the Rushton Triangular Lodge, which was laid out in the shape of a triangle, again a gesture to his religious beliefs, intended to recall the trinity. The market house was in a dilapidated state by the early 18th century and was restored in 1827. During the 19th century, the building was primarily used as a lock-up for petty criminals. Following significant population growth, largely as a result of its status as a market town, a local board was appointed in Rothwell in 1891. After the local board was succeeded by Rothwell Urban District Council in 1894, the new council instructed a local contractor, Margetts & Neal, to complete the building, to a design by local architect John Alfred Gotch. The building was finally roofed in 1895. The council then used the building to accommodate its council chamber and the local public library. The building ceased to be the local seat of government when the council moved to the Manor House in 1936. The market house continued to accommodate the local public library until the library service moved to a new building on the north side of Market Hill in 1986. Rothwell Preservation Trust, which was formed in 1985, took over the management of the building, which became the meeting place of Rothwell Town Council. Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester visited the market house and reviewed the work of the trust in 1989.

Local clubs and regional leagues have expanded participation at the youth level. The Germany baseball national team has improved in international play and is a regular European Baseball Championship participant, most recently earning 3rd place at the 2019 tournament. Baseball in the Netherlands The Netherlands is a Dutch baseball powerhouse and the history of baseball in their country goes back to when the sport was first being organized abroad, all way back since early 20th century. Dutch Honkbal Hoofdklasse Founded 1922 Continent Europe Official website of the Dutch baseball leagueikipedia. The Netherlands has produced multiple Major League Baseball (MLB) players with their national team being successful at the highest competition levels in European baseball, having won 24 times in the European Baseball Championship as of 2023. The nation also made history with a fourth-place finish in the 2013 World Baseball Classic as Panama has become an international baseball power. Baseball in Italy The country has a strong baseball tradition with the Italian Baseball League (IBL) as one of Europe's top pro leagues. Founded in 1948, the IBL has been home to many high-profile players both native and foreign. The Italian National Team has great success in international competition, having won the European Baseball Championship 10 times including most recently as late at 2012. Alex Liddi became the first player born in Italy to hit a home run at the MLB level in 2011. Emerging baseball scenes European baseball has picked up a good amount of steam in recent years, including places like the Czech Republic and Spain. They have shown rising grassroots participation and developed more powerful domestic leagues. Over in the Czech Republic, it was a momentous achievement for its national team to qualify for the 2023 World Baseball Classic; still considered nothing more than an adult mutant ninja turtle-y sort of Tom Jonesy sport. Spain has also improved, thanks in large part to an advanced youth development system that is sending many players on its current team overseas. European International Competitions In Europe, a number of international baseball competitions are held to help foster the growth of the game across this continent. The European Baseball Championship is the elite event on the continent, run by the Confederation of European Baseball (CEB) and featuring Europe's top national teams every other year. This tournament has developed the standard of teams across Europe, with particular growth in countries such as Germany and Spain who have been able to compete more effectively. Another major tournament is the Federations Cup, which brings together European club teams and offers many of these best clubs in Europe a stage to play at their level.

Released as a single, it reached the top 30 of the US country chart in 1960. It was among several recordings made by the duo but was their only charting song. The song received a positive response from music publications and authors following its release. Background Wynn Stewart was considered one of country music's \"leading figures\" in their California Bakersfield Sound sub-genre. His 1956 single \"Waltz of the Angels\" reached the US country top 20 but could not follow the success. Instead, he signed with a new record label from the help of songwriter Harlan Howard. Meanwhile, his wife, Jan Howard, had recently begun a recording career and the couple's friendship with Stewart led to the pair singing duets. Producer Joe Johnson at Challenge Records believed the pair could have success and started recording them. Among their duets was the song \"Wrong Company\", which had been written by Harlan Howard. Release, critical reception and chart performance \"Wrong Company\" was released as a single by Challenge Records in March 1960. It was distributed as a seven-inch vinyl single and featured a B-side called \"We'll Never Love Again\" (also a duet between the pairing). The song received a positive response by music publications following its release. Billboard magazine found the song to be \"an emotion packed reading\" while Cash Box called it a \"poignant, middle beat weeper\". In his book Country Music: The Rough Guide, Kurt Wolff wrote that \"Wrong Company\" was among Stewart's \"strongest\" recordings. \"Wrong Company\" made its debut on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart on May 30, 1960, and spent two weeks there, reaching the number 26 position there. It was the duo's only charting single together despite several recordings made.

Taxonomy It was formally described as a new species in 1805 by the Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, who originally classified it in the genus Patellaria. It has a long and extensive taxonomic history, having been shuffled to many different genera, and having been described several times under different names by different authors. In 1984, Hannes Hertel and Adolf Josef Schwab transferred it to the genus Porpidia, and it has largely been referred to that name since. Description Porpidia macrocarpa is a crustose lichen with a variable thallus, typically appearing (embedded in the ) to thin and continuous, but it can sometimes be thicker and become cracked () or divided into small sections (). The surface of the thallus is rough and web-like () with a colour range from pale grey to greenish-grey. It frequently shows patches or continuous areas of orange to rust-red due to oxidation. The medulla (internal tissue) does not react to iodine (I–). The (initial growth stage) is indistinct at the margins of immersed thalli but becomes wavy, black, and somewhat distinct at the margins of more superficial thalli. The apothecia (fruiting bodies) are up to 3 mm in diameter, usually (sitting directly on the thallus), abundant, and can be scattered or crowded together. They are constricted at the base with a thick, swollen (rim) that is persistent, black, shiny, and raised, ranging from entire to somewhat wavy (). The hyphae (filamentous fungal cells) measure 3–9 µm in diameter. The of the apothecia can be slightly concave to flat or convex, black or brown-black, with a or shiny finish, and sometimes covered with a grey powdery coating (). Larger apothecia often appear to divide through the formation of secondary margins within the disc. The (upper layer of the hymenium) is pale brown to olive-brown, and the hymenium (spore-producing layer) measures 80–100 µm tall. The (layer below the hymenium) and inner exciple may show a reddish tinge when treated with potassium hydroxide solution (K+). The are elongated, measuring 16–20 µm in length and 6–11.5 µm in width. The medulla reacts variably to chemical spot tests, sometimes showing a yellowish reaction with potassium hydroxide (K±) and an orange reaction with p-phenylenediamine (Pd±), indicating the presence of stictic and cryptostictic acids. Species interactions Lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi that have been recorded growing on Porpidia macrocarpa include Cecidonia xenophana, Endococcus propinquus, E. rugulosus, Muellerella pygmaea, and Sclerococcum australe.

Early life Agnes Crane was born in June 1852 in Thorney, near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. She was the only child of Edward Crane (18221901) and Jane Turnell. Crane lived in Thorney until 1866, when her father retired. They settled in Brighton in 1867, after travelling around Europe. Crane lived in Brighton for the rest of her life. Edward Crane was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1872, and became involved with the Brighton Museum in the 1870s, first assisting with the geological gallery, and later as a member and then chair of the museum committee. Writings on paleontology From the late 1870s, Crane had a deep interest in recent and fossil organisms, and wrote a number journal articles on fish, cephalopods and brachiopods. She had no formal university training, but corresponded with leading zoologists and paleontologists of the day, such as Albert Günther at the Natural History Museum, London, and presented her work or, had her work presented, to local scientific meetings, including the Brighton and Sussex Natural History Society. In Brighton, Crane was able to work with Scottish paleontologist, and brachiopod specialist, Thomas Davidson. Davidson lived in Brighton for many years, and in the 1870s was chairman of the Brighton museum committee, a role later taken on by Crane's father. After Davidson died, in 1885, Crane was invited by the Linnean Society to oversee the editing and final production of Davidson's monograph of recent brachiopods. Within the collections left by Davidson, Crane came across some samples of brachiopods that had recently been dredged from shallow waters offshore from Port Stephens, New South Wales by Australian malacologist John Brazier. Davidson had labelled the samples Atretia brazeri, in honour of the collector, but had not completed any formal description of the material. Crane examined and described the samples, and published the first technical description of this new species in a paper in April 1886. Subsequent work has shown that this species is part of a genus of brachiopods, Aulites, that are only found in Australian waters. In subsequent years, Crane wrote a number of book chapters, essays and technical papers on brachiopod anatomy and evolution. In addition to her writings on paleontology, Crane wrote more widely on topics including sea-level change and ancient Mexican heraldry; she also wrote a number of book reviews for scientific journals and contributed to discussions of papers on other topics. Travel Crane was well travelled and, among other things, published an extended account of a trip to the United States in 1881 and visits to a number of museums and collections. In August 1893, Crane was one of twelve women who presented papers at the Women's Auxiliary Branch of the World's Congress in Chicago. Crane died in September 1932, in Brighton.

It is the oldest recorded urban settlement in the interior of what is now Somalia, being first mentioned in the Nuzhat al-mushtāq of al-Idrīsī in 1154. It is also mentioned in the Kitāb al-jughrāfiyā of Ibn Saʿīd from 1270 and by Abulfeda, who relies on Ibn Saʿīd. It was still remembered as late as the fifteenth century, when ʿAlī ibn al-Ḥasan al-Khazrajī records in his al-'Uqud that a prominent Jabarti family emigrated from Badda to Zabīd in Yemen in the thirteenth century. Al-Khazrajī puts the location of Badda in the territory of the Adal Sultanate. According to al-Idrīsī, Badda was a journey of eight days from the coastal town of Baqday, probably modern Laasqoray. He describes it as a city lying in a sandy desert beyond the Equator at the edge of the known world.: \"madināt baṭṭa fi ṣaḥār ūa rimāl ḫalif ḫaṭṭ uasaṭ al arḍ\". That the actual city was north of the Equator is likely, since al-Idrīsī's map places it roughly in the same latitude as Lake Tana. Thus, proposed identifications with the ancient metropolis of Rhapta should be rejected. For al-Idrīsī, Badda borders the land of Barbaria. If the identification of Baqday is correct, then, based on the specified distance, Badda must have lain in the Somali interior between Sanaag and Nugaal. It may be identifiable with the ruins discovered at or possibly with those at nearby Xananley. The name of Badda, from Somali bad (sea, lake), may refer to Lake Cuun, a crater lake at Xundhurgaal. The name Cuun (forest) refers to the dense vegetation on its banks.. A discussion of Xundhurgaal, with photographs, is at pp. 251–255. It is a long lake, . Both proposed sites are in the vicinity of Garoowe, the capital of Puntland. , placing Baqday closer to Berbera, locates Badda further west, in the Abyssinian interior, near the bend of Africa formed by the Gulf of Aden. The date of Badda's founding is uncertain, but historical sources record the development of caravan routes in this region in the ninth and tenth centuries. Badda may have been the political centre of the early Muslim chiefs or sultans of the eastern region of Bari, judging by the presence of elite Muslim tombs in around Xundhurgaal. thumb|center|upright=2|Miller's modern reproduction of al-Idrīsī's world map with Badda at top centre Notes Bibliography Category:Archaeological sites in Somalia\n\n77,655,320\n\nTexas Air Museum - Stinson Chapter\n\nThe Texas Air Museum - Stinson Chapter is located on Stinson Municipal Airport (the second oldest continuous operating airport in the United States).

His younger brother, Domingo de Guzmán was the founder of the Order of Preachers, whom he helped in his reforming aims throughout his life. Biography Manés was the second son of Félix de Guzmán and Juana de Aza. He was educated by his parents and his uncle Don Gonzalo de Aza in Gumiel de Izán. He wanted to enter a Cistercian monastery in the region of Caleruega, but was rejected. When his brother founded the Order of Preachers, he joined them eventually becoming one of its first members; with an introverted and humble temperament, he helped his brother in the consolidation and expansion of the order. On 15 August 1217, Dominic ordered the friars of Prouille to disperse throughout Europe and settle there, growing the order, already confirmed by Pope Honorius III. He was sent to Paris with other Spanish friars and there collaborated in the foundation of the Convent of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. There he preached against the Albegensian heresy. Later on, his brother Dominic arranged for him, accompanied by Fra Miquel de Fabra, to make a trip to Spain in order to consolidate and strengthen the new houses of the Order in his country of origin. In 1219, his brother entrusted him with the care of the Dominican nuns of the Convent of Madrid. After the death and canonization of his brother on 3 July 3, 1234, Manés returned to Caleruega to promote the construction of a church in the birthplace of the new saint, which would later become a monastery for nuns. He died in the Monastery of San Pedro de Gumiel de Izán and was buried there, where some members of his family were already buried, including his mother, Juana de Aza. As he enjoyed a reputation for sanctity, he was buried with all kinds of honors. When the Dominicans began to venerate him, his relics were transferred from his family pantheon to the main altar, where they were exposed for public veneration, together with many others from other saints, brought from Cologne. He was beatified eventually on 2 June 1834 by Pope Gregory XVI; his feast day is either July 30 or August 18.
