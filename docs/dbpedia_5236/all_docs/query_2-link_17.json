        "text": "BOISE — For Rafael Araujo, October is a multimillion-dollar month.\n\nHe has more than perhaps anyone on the current Jazz roster to monetarily gain, or potentially lose, in this calendar page alone — a reality not at all lost on the former BYU big man.\n\n\"What I can control is to come to work every day, and practice hard, and try to do the best,\" the Brazilian-born Araujo said Thursday, the Jazz's third day of training camp on the campus of Boise State University. \"Contract stuff — I mean, whatever happens happens.\"\n\nAraujo's situation is this: The Jazz must decide by the end of this month whether they'll pick up the fourth-year option on the rookie contract of the No. 8 overall selection from the 2004 NBA Draft.\n\nDoing so would cost them $3,046,694 for Araujo's guaranteed services in the 2007-08 season, a hefty raise from the $2,395,200 he'll make this season.\n\nIf the Jazz don't pick up the option, the 26-year-old center would become a restricted free agent — and the team would retain the right to match any offer sheet he signs in the league's 2007 offseason shopping market.\n\nFrom one perspective, that amounts to both betting on a hunch they might be able to re-sign him for a lesser amount next summer. In a worst-case scenario — should Araujo not pan out this season — it gets them out from under a burdensome salary.\n\nFrom another perspective, keeping Araujo in the future could wind up costing more than $3 million — if, that is, he has a breakout year this season.\n\nIt's truly a tough call for a club that's faced several similar ones in recent Octobers gone by, leaving Jazz basketball operations senior vice president Kevin O'Connor and the organization's other decisionmakers plenty to ponder this month.\n\n\"And we'll use every day,\" O'Connor said.\n\nIt was not long ago that the Jazz had to make October-deadline decisions regarding contract options on a couple of first-round draft choices from years gone by, point guard Raul Lopez and center Curtis Borchardt.\n\nOne, Lopez, had already proven he could play — but had issues with a surgically repaired knee. The other, Borchardt, also had major injury issues — but he was unproven to boot.\n\nNot nearly as much money compared to Araujo's was in question, and the Jazz wound up exercising their options on each.\n\nNow, however, both are out of the NBA and playing in Spain.\n\nIf nothing else, the history lesson gives O'Connor cause for pause before making a final decision on Araujo.\n\nThere are other factors to consider:\n\nAfter two largely unsuccessful seasons in Toronto before the Raptors traded him to the Jazz this past summer for another lottery flop, forward Kris Humphries, consensus in Canada is that Araujo is grossly overpaid with salary pre-slotted for a No. 8 pick.\n\nQuality big men, on the other hand, are scarce in the NBA — and the Jazz are holding out hope they can develop Araujo into one.\n\nFor all practical purposes, Araujo — whom Utah would have taken with one of its two mid-first-round picks in 2004, had Toronto not gotten him first — remains a mystery to Jazz brass.\n\n\"We just don't know him,\" O'Connor said. \"I don't know what his value is. Let's go through these 30 days, and then make some kind of decision.\"\n\nEven then, the verdict may be split — perhaps prompting the franchise to hold off on a commitment beyond the coming season.\n\nBut so far, a few days into that monthlong window, at least one strong voice in Jazz affairs seemingly likes what he sees.\n\nHis basis of comparison is this past July, when rather than work with the Brazilian national team, Araujo — focusing on his NBA future — played for Utah's Rocky Mountain Revue club.\n\nHe didn't exactly tear up the summer league, leaving some wondering just how much someone who averaged 2.9 points and 3.0 points in 111 games with the Raptors can contribute to a Jerry Sloan-coached club.\n\nSince arriving in Boise, however, Araujo apparently has made a favorable impression in closed-to-the-media practices.\n\n\"He's running better. His decisionmaking is better. He hasn't taken as many tough shots,\" Sloan said. \"Having been here in the summer, I think, was terrific for him.\"\n\nNothing like an early taste of just what playing for Sloan takes.\n\nMoney matters?\n\nStakes indeed are high, even if the millions might seem like icing to someone who's already cashed his first few.\n\n\"The job is business. I come to the basketball court to work,\" Araujo said. \"To tell you I'm worried a little bit? Yeah ... But it won't be the end of the world if they don't (pick up the option).\""
