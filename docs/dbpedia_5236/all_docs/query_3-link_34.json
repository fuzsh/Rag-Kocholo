        "text": "I’ve been following BYU basketball ever since I was a young lad in the late 90s. I loved watching Mark Bigelow and Travis Hansen. Rafael Araujo elbowing Jerel Blassingame against my hometown UNLV Rebels was a fond memory. The Lee Cummard, Trent Plaisted, Jonathan Tavernari teams won a lot of games. Jimmer Fredette’s senior year is the most memorable BYU sports year of my life. The WCC years had great players with Brandon Davies, Eric Mika, Tyler and TJ Haws, and Yoeli Childs, to just name a few. Last year’s team that finished sixth in the Big 12 was beat all expectations.\n\nOutside of Jimmer’s senior year, I’m not sure there’s been this much buzz and excitement around the program in my life. Kevin Young has completely transformed what BYU can do in basketball. BYU’s NIL efforts have stepped up and made BYU among the best in the country. But, top players aren’t coming to BYU for any coach. BYU doesn’t have a track record for producing NBA guys and the honor code isn’t exactly enticing for most teenagers. Kevin Young has an incredible basketball reputation globally, and he is selling his NBA vision to recruits. This staff got started on the recruiting trail late, but landed two potential one-and-done players. The NIL absolutely helps, but BYU doesn’t get Egor Demin and Kanon Catchings with out Kevin Young and his basketball reputation and what he can legitimately promise players in terms of NBA development.\n\nThis mailbag edition dives into some of your questions. Thanks as always for supporting.\n\nNot to sound greedy lol...but who is BYU pursuing with that last scholarship?\n\nBYU has one scholarship available. I think most fans would say BYU should add another big, and I agree with that, but it’s not so simple.\n\nBYU has two scholarship players that play the five — Keba Keita and Fousseyni Traore. I’ve seen some say that Fouss is a natural four since he is 6-foot-6, but he absolutely is not. In an ideal world Fouss have the lateral quickness to guard multiple positions and consistently shoot the three ball, but that’s not who he is. He is an undersized five, but he is a dang good one. He was BYU’s second leading scorer last year after averaging 11 ppg and was top 10 in Big 12 play in both offensive and defensive rebound percentage. Keba and Fouss have different strengths and will be BYU’s main five men.\n\nIf BYU were to bring in another five, they are not getting minutes over Keita and Fouss. They would be there to strictly provide depth and play in case of injury. So while it would be great for BYU to add a seven-footer, that player isn’t really moving the needle at all unless Keba or Fouss get hurt — and we’ve seen Fouss hurt that hammy/groin the last few seasons.\n\nThat’s the first challenge to bringing in another big. Any good ones out there, whether it be from the portal or international ranks, would have to be good knowing they will just be a depth piece year one unless there is an injury. The days of a young big coming in and either redshirting or developing their first year are becoming increasingly rare; players want to play as soon as possible.\n\nSay you cross that first bridge and a player is fine with being that third big — how many are good enough that BYU would want to take? If BYU brings in a freshman, you want them to be good enough to get meaningful minutes as a sophomore. Frankly, there aren’t many bigs like that available.\n\nThirdly, BYU will likely bring in another big from the transfer portal after Fouss graduates to pair with senior Keba Keita in 2025-2026. Is a freshman big you bring in this offseason going to be better than someone else you can bring in from the transfer portal or international next year when Kevin Young and his staff have a full offseason to recruit? Based on what we’ve seen from their recruiting chops this offseason, I would say no. And if BYU brings in another big next year and a potential big BYU brings in this offseason has to sit behind Keba and new addition, he would probably hit the portal.\n\n6-foot-9 Snow College transfer Max Triplett was brought in to give front court and be that emergency big. Max is a walk-on, but he turned down other D1 scholarship offers to walk-on at BYU. He is a capable college basketball player that gives BYU additional depth down low.\n\nSo, who will BYU bring in with the last spot? Sources tell me that BYU is in on multiple international players and that is the most likely route BYU will go. BYU can be very patient and wait until August to bring in someone. International players often don’t sign until August, so BYU can be choosy. BYU is going with the “best player available” approach to fill the last spot.\n\nIf it was up to me, I would still target another big, whether that be an international player or someone with one year of availability remaining. Fouss has hurt his hamstring/groin every season or offseason at BYU, and while Triplett provides some depth, I would like to see BYU have another big body.\n\nBringing in a big that has just one year of eligibility left and would be fine providing depth would not be a bad strategy. Most guys want to play their last season, but having another big body that can play in a pinch and only takes a scholarship for one year wouldn’t be the worst thing.\n\nOne name I’ll throw out there that fits that mold is our old friend Mo Njie. Remember Mo? Mo took an official visit to BYU two years ago after transferring from Eastern Michigan. The 6-foot-11 big is LDS and made the All-Freshman team in the MAC. Mo chose SMU over BYU and played sparingly the last two seasons for SMU, playing in just 13 games and averaging 3.5 minutes this past season. He entered the transfer portal in April and is still looking for a school for his last season. BYU could absolutely get an international player better than Mo at another position. Mo would compete with Max Triplett for the number 3 big, and honestly I might give the edge to Triplett in that case. But BYU could do worse than adding a 6-foot-11 big with three years of college experience that is also LDS. BYU’s main core is already set, and adding one more big would give me some peace of mind.\n\nOutside of another big, BYU could use a little more shooting. Kevin Young has said that you can never have too much shooting, and getting another guy that can hit shots wouldn’t be a bad thing.\n\nTLDR; BYU will likely target the best available player and he will probably be from the international ranks.\n\nWith so many talented guys on the roster now, especially with the additions of Egor and Kanon, how do you think the minutes get distributed? Do Egor and Kanon start seeing as how they’re both projected 1st round picks next year?\n\nBYU has 12 talented scholarship players that are going to want minutes. Kevin Young is not going to play a 12-man rotation. Decisions will need to be made.\n\nFirst question is who does BYU start? It’s still so early to project this since we’re 4.5 months away from the start of the season, but I’ll give you my way-too-early thoughts. Dallin Hall will start at point guard. He’s a two-year starter and one of the team leaders. 6-foot-9 Egor Demin can play 1-3 comfortably and has point guard skills, and I think he’ll start in the backcourt next to Hall.\n\nAt the three spot, you have three main candidates — Richie Saunders, Mawot Mag, and Kanon Catchings. I’ll give the nod the Richie. It’s exciting to focus on the new guys coming in, but Richie Saunders is so good. He is 100% hustle and shot 37% from three in Big 12 play, highest among any BYU player. I expect his three-point shooting volume to go up, and if he can shoot in the high 30s he is going to compete for All Big 12 honors.\n\nAt the four Mawot Mag and Kanon Catchings are the two most likely options. Both will play both forward spots this season Mag is a fifth-year senior that is an incredible defender but an inconsistent shooter. Catchings is an incredible talented offensive player, but will need to get stronger if he wants to consistently compete at the four. This is one I can see going either way and it could be a situation where Mawot gets the nod to start the year and Kanon eventually overtakes him. Kevin Young’s ideal offense is to have a stretch for and KY is an offensive-minded coach, so for that reason I’ll side with Kanon.\n\nAt the five you could convince me for Keba or Fouss and I’d be thrilled with either. It won’t really matter who starts since they’ll end up with about the same amount of minutes, but I’ll give the nod to Keba since KY loves rim-running fives.\n\nIn my scenario, that gives this starting lineup:\n\n1- Dallin Hall\n\n2- Egor Demin\n\n3- Richie Saunders\n\n4- Kanon Catchings\n\n5- Keba Keita\n\nFor rotation, I think Brody Kozlowski and Elijah Crawford could find consistent minutes tough to come by. You can make the argument that Elijah Crawford is the backup point guard, and he could very well get some minutes there, but honestly I think Egor Demin will get minutes as the primary point guard. He’ll play some point guard even when him and Dallin are on the floor due to how KY runs his offense, but I think KY will also let Demin play some backup point guard when Dallin is on the bench to take advantage of Demin’s playmaking abilities and give BYU some lineup possibilities with incredible length on the floor. Think of the lineup possibilities if you run something like Egor, Richie, Mawot, Catchings, and Keba/Fouss. That is a of length and offensive and defensive versatility.\n\nTrevin Knell shot near 40% from three last season and is BYU’s best pure shooter, so he will factor into the lineup and get his share of minutes.\n\nSo in addition to the five starters above, the other main players in the rotation I see are Fouss, Mawot Mag, Trevin Knell, and Dawson Baker. Baker should be fully recovered from foot surgery, but foot surgeries are always a little tricky. He absolutely has the skill to be a big contributor, but it could take him a bit to really settle in.\n\nTrey Stewart, Elijah Crawford, and Brody Kozlowski could find consistent minutes hard to come by. Brody could get some minutes at the four if KY wants to play Mag and Catchings more at the three and Stewart and Crawford could find some backup point guard minutes, but at some point certain guys won’t get minutes every night. Playing Trey Stewart could give BYU a REALLY good defensive lineup if you went with Trey, Egor, Richie, Mawot, and Keba. I hope to see that lineup at some point just to see how many “kills” BYU could get.\n\nLot of other teams also leveled up, how does the Byu roster stack up against the top big 12 teams?\n\nThe Big 12 was once again rated as the best conference in the country last year according to KenPom. Even with that, it was still a “down” year for the league. The Big 12 had its lowest KenPom ranking since 2020-2021 and some of the top teams were down. Kansas was Preseason #1, but they had too many injuries and not enough depth to be a serious title contender. Baylor won a NCAA Tournament game and was a top 25 team, but they weren’t the national title contender of years past.\n\nThe Big 12 will be better this year. Kansas returns their top guys and added some elite transfers, Baylor looks the part of a national title contender again, Houston will be a top 10 team, Iowa State returns most of its core from a team that was a 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, Cincinnati lost some close games last season and returns most of its team, Texas Tech and Kansas State had a nice portal class, UCF returns its top scorers. And, oh yeah, Arizona joins the league.\n\nIf BYU finishes between 6 through 8 that will be a GREAT year. BYU has the talent to finish higher, but the Big 12 is on another level this year. If BYU is in the middle of the pack of a 16-team Big 12, they’ll be a single-digit seed in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNot to overlook the last scholarship spot this year, but how is BYU feeling about the guys they offered in 2026?\n\nThe 2026 class is players that just finished their sophomore year. BYU is on some really good players in the 2025 class, most notably AJ Dybantsa and JJ Mandquit, and most of the 2025 guys will commit in November.\n\nThe 2026 class is the first class this staff will have a FULL cycle to really recruit and buckle in. BYU is on some very talented 2026 guys. I have to start with Timpview’s Dean Rueckert. The 6-foot-6 wing is rated the #27 player in the 2026 class and one of the top LDS players in the last 25 years. He is the most no-brainer player to go after and grew up a BYU fan.\n\nOther top 100 players from Utah include Anthony Felesi and Junior County, both of whom BYU is recruiting. BYU has also offered the #1 player in the 2026 class Brandon McCoy, and one source told me that BYU is in as good of a spot as you could hope to be for a 2026 player at this point.\n\nOne player to keep an eye on is Finnish native Miikda Murrinen. The 6-foot-10 forward was offered by BYU recently and is a top 50 player in the class. Industry sources tell me that BYU has made an early impression with Miikka and is a school to watch.\n\nOverall, BYU is in great position to make a big splash in the 2026 class."
