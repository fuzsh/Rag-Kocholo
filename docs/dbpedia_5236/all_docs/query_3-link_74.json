        "text": "By Michael Mendenhall\n\nA month ago, many people said that the Toronto Raptors? made a mistake in drafting Rafael Araujo, but recent events have started to reverse this opinion.\n\nSince returning from the injured list late in December, Araujo has started the last six games for the Raptors. In a season filled with both excitement and disappointment, Araujo has found reason to celebrate.\n\nIn Sunday night?s game against Golden State Warriors, Araujo contributed 14 points and grabbed six rebounds to help the Raptors post a 109-87 victory.\n\nAlthough Araujo has lived the struggles of a rookie in the NBA including limited playing time and growing pains, he?s glad to play a larger role on the team after being put on the injured list for a few games last month.\n\n?He?s just learning right now,? said Walter Roese, BYU?s director of Basketball Operations and good friend of Araujo. ?He?s happy right now because he?s playing.?\n\nThis recent change has seemed to increase Araujo?s confidence. Since coming off the injured list, he has averaged 7.8 points and 6.8 rebounds in 17.1 minutes.\n\nOne of his best games recently came against the Sacramento Kings, where Araujo had a career-high 14 rebounds with seven coming on the offensive boards. Roese said that this performance made him happy, but he realizes there is still room for improvement.\n\nKnown for his work ethic, Araujo is trying to prove he can play on the professional level and knows this will not happen without hard effort. Frequently, he will be the first to arrive at practice and the last one to leave.\n\nPerhaps the main reason for Araujo?s effort is his love of basketball.\n\n?He loves the game,? Roese said. ?He works hard, so when he gets the opportunity, he?s ready.?\n\nIn mid-December, the Raptors moved Araujo to the injured list in order to make room for players Eric Williams, Aaron Williams and Alonzo Mourning, who were acquired in a trade that sent forward Vince Carter to the New Jersey Nets. However, Araujo only spent a total of five games on the injured list.\n\n?He was sad he couldn?t play,? Roese said.\n\nDespite his highs and lows in the NBA, Araujo hasn?t forgotten BYU.\n\n?Hoffa? still checks in to see how his alma mater is fairing this season and is thankful for the things BYU has done for him, Roese said."
