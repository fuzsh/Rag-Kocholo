Air Force's Jarvis Croff had eight against Utah in the 2002 semifinals.\n\n* Nick Jacobson's seven three-pointers tied the school record. Jacobson has set the mark twice (also vs. San Diego State, 7-of-10, on Jan. 14, 2002) and he shares it with Phil Cullen and Phil Dixon. His 11 three-point attempts also tied the third-best mark in Ute history. It is the fourth time Jacobson has attempted 11 threes.\n\n* Andrew Bogut had 12 rebounds against SDSU to tie the MWC Tournament freshman record (R.T. Gunn of New Mexico in 2000).\n\nUte Items\n\n* Utah has shot 50 percent or better from the field in 12 games this season, going 11-1.

The Utes broke a string of 12 consecutive games of shooting at least 40 percent from the field against San Diego State on Feb. 7-it was the first game Utah won this season when being outshot (41.7 to 39.0 percent). Since then, Utah hasn't shot under 40 percent in the last eight games.\n\n* The Utes are 19-1 when scoring at least 60 points this season with their only loss coming to Wyoming (74-65) on Feb. 16.

After shooting just 26.8 percent (11-of-41) from the stripe against Stony Brook, Texas Tech and UConn (getting losses in the later two games), Utah has shot 75.4 percent (318-of-422) in the last 23 games.
