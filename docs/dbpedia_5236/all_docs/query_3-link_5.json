        "text": "By Joseph Simmons\n\nDuring his time at BYU, Rafael Araujo established himself as one of the best basketball centers in the nation.\n\nIn the 2003-2004 season, he led the Cougars to a 21-9 record, averaged almost 20 points a game and took the team into the NCAA tournament. Scouts pegged him as a sure bet to be drafted into the NBA. Few of them though, projected him to go eighth overall to Toronto and be the first center taken in the draft.\n\nOvernight, the expectations for Araujo went through the roof. The Toronto Raptors wanted him to score for them in the NBA like he did at BYU. It was a lot of pressure.\n\nNow, almost three years later, Araujo is back in town and has the chance for a fresh start with one of the up-and-coming teams in the NBA-- the Utah Jazz-- and he''s happy to be there.\n\n'When I heard I was coming here, it was like the draft again,' Araujo said. 'I was really excited to be back, and to be able to work with coach (Jerry) Sloan.'\n\nJazz fans were divided about Araujo''s return. All could agree they were elated that the black hole that was Kris Humphries was gone, but how Araujo would fit in was a big question.\n\nTo say that Araujo was a failure in Toronto would be unfair. The coaches and fans expected so much from him, that when he didn''t perform immediately, he was put in the doghouse. In his first two seasons with the Raptors, Araujo averaged only 12 minutes per game, and averaged only three points per game. The coaching staff had little patience and, after just a few months, Araujo was worked out of the regular team rotation. Still, Araujo said, it was a learning experience.\n\n'I learned how to play in a difficult situation,' Araujo said. 'I learned that when things are hard, all I can do is continue to work hard.'\n\nAraujo sees his chance with the Jazz as a great opportunity, and he is showing that he will make the most of it. Araujo had a good showing last summer at the Rocky Mountain Revue, and coaches have praised his work ethic.\n\nBeing in Utah, Araujo said, has done great things for his morale.\n\n'I succeeded here in college, and people here know that I work hard,' he said. 'The players here make me a better player, and the energy here is good.'\n\nAraujo is beginning to be noticed by Sloan for his hard work. While currently on the inactive list, Araujo is spending hours every day working on his game. Even following last Monday''s victory over the Detroit Pistons, Araujo left the Delta Center to go to a two-hour practice session.\n\n'I think that Araujo is working hard,' Sloan said. 'He still has a lot to learn, but he''s a young guy. If he''ll be patient and learn the game without trying to force it, I think he''ll be a good player.'\n\nAraujo looks back on his time at BYU and on the Cougars'' basketball team with fondness.\n\n'I loved everything about it. I loved the friendships I had in class, and on the team,' Araujo said. 'I think they have a great coach now. Coach Rose deserved the job. The players work hard, and I wish them the best of luck.'"
