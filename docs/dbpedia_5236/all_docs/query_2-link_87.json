        "text": "Nov 27, 2003\n\nFinal Stats| Quotes\n\nBERKELEY, Calif. (AP) - Amit Tamir followed in his own miss with 5.8 seconds left to score and give Cal a 47-46 win over BYU at Haas Pavilion Wednesday night.\n\nTamir had struggled all night, and made just two of 13 shots, but his last one was good enough for the Bears first win of the season.\n\nFreshman Leon Powe led Cal with 18 points and 11 rebounds, but the Bears offense had gone scoreless for 5:50 before Tamir followed in his own miss in the waning seconds.\n\nCal head coach Ben Braun was pleased with the senior's performance despite his poor shooting.\n\n\"He rebounded well and defended well, and made the people around him better,\" Braun said.\n\nMike Hall, who led BYU with 17 points off the bench, had keyed a Cougar rally that erased an eight-point Cal lead. But Hall was the only Cougar in double figures, as 6-11 center Rafael Araujo fouled out with nine points after only 18 minutes.\n\nMark Bigelow, the other big gun for BYU (2-0), had only 7 points.\n\n\"We were in position to win the game,\" said BYU coach Steve Cleveland, \"but we just didnt get it done.\"\n\nNeither team shot better than 38 percent, and Cal was just 1-14 from three-point distance.\n\n\"People are going to look at this score in the morning and think it was a football game,\" said Braun, whose Bears shot just 24 percent in the second half. \"It was an ugly-type game. You wont get any style points for that.\"\n\nThe Bears built an eight-point lead, 43-35, with 9:14 to go in the second half, but three minutes later, it was a one-point game again, and when Hall gave BYU back the lead with a nifty inside move at 3:35, the Cougars led until the final sequence.\n\nCal got the ball back, trailing 46-45, after Mike Woodberry missed the front end of a one-on-one. With 15 seconds to go, Cal freshman Ayinde Ubaka set up for the last shot, and drove hard to the basket from the right side.\n\nHe missed, but the 6-10 Tamir got the rebound, but missed the follow shot. The rebound again fell into Tamir's hands, and this time he converted, with just 5.8 seconds remaining.\n\nAfter a timeout, BYU pushed the ball downcourt, but Terry Nashif turned the ball over, and Cal had escaped with the win.\n\nThe Golden Bears lost their first game in a similar manner, leading down the stretch, but giving up a follow shot with 5.8 seconds to go to lose by one to Cal Poly. This time, however, it was Cal that converted its final opportunity.\n\nCal's winning streak over BYU has now reached four games, and dates back to 1989. The Bears lead the all-time series 6-4."
