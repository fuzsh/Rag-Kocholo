The 6-foot-6 forward is one of 18 players invited to the camp in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n\"I'm really excited about this opportunity,\" said Tavernari, a native of Sao Bernardo, Brazil. \"It's something I've always dreamed of. I'll have the chance to play with the best players from my country and enjoy time with some of my country's big names in basketball.\"\n\nTavernari will play with former BYU center Rafael Araujo, who earned All-America and Mountain West Conference Player of the Year honors as a Cougar in 2004. Since graduating from BYU, Araujo has played in the NBA for three years with Toronto and Utah before playing in Russia this past season.\n\nBrazil will compete in the South American Championships in Puerto Montt, Chile, from July 1-6 before going to Athens, Greece, to play in the Acropolis International Tournament from July 7-9 in preparation for the 12-team FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament, also in Athens, from July 14-20."
