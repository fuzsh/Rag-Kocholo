        "text": "Jan 7, 2004\n\nBox Score?|? Photo Gallery\n\nBy JAY COHEN\n\nAssociated Press Writer\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. - Julius Hodge scored 23 points and Ilian Evtimov had 11 of his 13 in the first half of North Carolina State's 89-62 victory over Brigham Young on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Wolfpack (8-2) placed four players in double figures and forced 17 turnovers in winning their third straight game and improving to 40-4 against non-conference opponents at the RBC Center.\n\nMarcus Melvin finished with 15 points and nine rebounds for N.C. State, becoming the 37th player in school history to score 1,000 points.\n\nRafael Araujo had 23 points and 10 rebounds for BYU (10-3) and Mark Bigelow added 16. No other Cougar had more than five points.\n\nThe Wolfpack took control with a 15-2 run 4 minutes into the game. Hodge had two baskets and Evtimov made the first of his three first-half 3-pointers during the spurt.\n\nEvtimov hit consecutive 3s later in the first half, helping the Wolfpack build a 22-point lead.\n\nThe Cougars were within 48-34 at halftime but couldn't get any closer than 13 points in the second half before N.C. State pulled away. BYU committed 13 turnovers in the first half.\n\nHodge passed 1,000 career points earlier in the season in a win over Hartford. The junior swingman has scored in double figures in his last 15 games - the longest current streak of any Atlantic Coast Conference player.\n\nThe game was the first matchup between the schools since N.C. State won 95-81 on Dec. 21, 1955. The Wolfpack plays at BYU next season."
