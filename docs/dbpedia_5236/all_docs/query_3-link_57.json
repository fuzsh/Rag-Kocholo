        "text": "By Jared Lloyd\n\nPosition:\n\nCenter\n\nSize:\n\n6''11', 265 lbs.\n\nAwards:\n\nPlayed against NBA and other professional players on the Brazilian National Team at the 2002 World Basketball Championships in Indianapolis\n\nEarned second-team NJCAA All-America honors in 2001-02 as a sophomore at Arizona Western\n\n2002-2003 Stats\n\n10.8 points/game\n\n8.7 rebounds/game\n\n56.4 field goal percentage\n\n60.3 free throw percentage\n\nStrengths:\n\nBYU hasn''t had a dominating center since head coach Steve Cleveland arrived. Center Mekeli Wesley was good, but he was more of a forward playing the center position. Araujo has given the Cougars a legitimate threat inside and turned the Cougars into a dangerous, multi-faceted team.\n\nOne of Araujo''s biggest contributions has been is tenacity on the boards. He goes after missed shots on both ends of the floor with intensity and sheer force. His 8.7 rebounds per game give the team the confidence to get out in transition.\n\nFor his size, Araujo is also very agile. He''s had success against traditional low post players, as well as stepping out on screens and against players who go out to the perimeter. He often beats his man to the basket, resulting in easy shots. The crowd roars when he comes over the top to get a steal and a breakaway dunk.\n\nThere''s no doubt that the fans at the Marriott Center love watching Araujo. He gets the crowd into the game by playing with passion. His thunderous dunks, either on entry passes or out on the break, bring the spectators to their feet. When the Cougars need a play to really get them pumped up, Araujo does it better than anyone.\n\nAraujo transferred to BYU with two years of eligibility. This year has been a season of learning the game at a Division I level and honing his raw skills. He has unlimited potential that Cougar fans are excited to see develop in the next year.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nEarly in the season, the referees called Araujo for offensive fouls if the opposing player simply fell down. The frustration he felt at getting called if the other player flopped seems to have affected his inside game. He settles for turnaround jump shots instead of taking the ball strong to the basket. He needs to go back to getting fouled underneath and getting easy layups and dunks.\n\nBut Araujo needs to be more effective with foul problems. On one hand, he needs to be careful at each end of the floor and avoid getting that fourth foul early in the second half. On the other side, when he is fouled, he needs to hit more than 60 percent of his foul shots, especially as pressure-packed tournament play arrives."
