        "text": "By Ethan Thomas\n\nFormer BYU men?s basketball star Rafael Araujo is embracing his role and working on improving his game, while seeing increased minutes for the Carlos Boozer-less Utah Jazz.\n\nFollowing two rough seasons in Toronto, Araujo, the eighth pick in the 2004 NBA Draft, hopes that changes made since arriving in Utah will aid his development.\n\n?I have changed my body type and tried to be more athletic,? Araujo said. ?Coach Sloan likes the big guys to run the floor, so I have dropped 20 pounds, and I?m trying to adapt to that light weight with power and quickness.?\n\nChange is something that couldn?t hurt the third-year pro. Araujo became a target for fans of the struggling Raptors. As happens with many highly touted draft picks that underachieve early in their careers, the situation ended badly.\n\nUtah seemed to be the perfect place for Araujo to start over. While seeing sparse minutes throughout much of the season, Boozer?s absence due to injury has opened the door for Araujo to play a role in the Jazz?s frontcourt rotation.\n\n?I?ve just found my role,? Araujo said. ?I know I need to work hard and get better every day, and when I get the opportunity to come in the game, I play hard basketball.?\n\nHis hard work is not going unnoticed by the teammates he posts up with every day.\n\n?There are only a couple guys I know with his work ethic,? fellow Jazz center Jarron Collins said. ?We are all professional athletes, and we practice our craft religiously, but Rafa takes it to the next level.?\n\nFinding a way into Sloan?s rotation isn?t the easiest thing for any young player, but Araujo has gained his coach?s respect.\n\n?There is a lot expected of guys who are drafted real high,? Sloan said. ?Then if things don?t go well for them, I think there is a lot of frustration. He has gone through some of that, but he has been totally professional here.?\n\nChanneling some of that frustration has been a key to Araujo?s progress. He has found a way to embrace his role with the Jazz, whether he is on the floor or cheering from the bench.\n\n?Since I got in the league, I have just always tried to find my role,? Araujo said. ?If my role for the Jazz is to support my teammates, that is how I?m going to do it.?\n\nAraujo is averaging 2.1 points and 2.1 rebounds per game this season. While the numbers aren?t staggering, he has made progress. He has seen minutes against teams with tough post play and done well.\n\nThis includes a match-up with possibly the league?s best big man, Tim Duncan, on Jan. 31. In 19 minutes, Araujo scored seven points, pulled down five rebounds and constantly flustered Duncan with his physical play on the defensive end of the floor.\n\nAs the season goes on, the Jazz hope Araujo continues to progress with patience.\n\n?He has fit into our system because he has worked hard,? Sloan said. ?He has had to start over. Some of his expectations didn?t materialize, but he is regrouping, and we have patience.?\n\nAraujo is happy with the progress he has made and his role with the Jazz. As for the future, he just wants to get better and be ready for his opportunity.\n\n?I have worked my fundamentals with a lot of repetition,? Araujo said. ?I?m just trying to sharpen my skills and when I get the call, be ready.?"
