In his second year, Spoonhour guided the Rebels to an 11-3 non-conference record, including Sunday's loss to USC at the Thomas & Mack Center. They finished the first half of league play in a three-way tie for fourth place at 3-4 along with Colorado State and San Diego State. The Rebels are 9-4 at home this year, but have gone 1-3 in Las Vegas in their last four outings with a win over Colorado State and losses to Utah, Wyoming and USC. They won their last league game at home when they trounced CSU, 90-57. UNLV's other loss was a 77-66 defeat to Stanford during the Las Vegas Showdown. UNLV is 5-3 on the road, including a 2-2 conference road mark. Since entering Provo to open league play at 11-2, UNLV has gone 3-5 over the last eight games. The Rebels have two of the MWC's top seven scorers in the MWC, led by senior point guard Marcus Banks at 19.3 points per game. He is second in scoring behind only New Mexico's Ruben Douglas.

BYU extended its home-winning streak to 44 as the Cougars beat UNLV 85-77 Thursday. With their first Mountain West Conference game of the season, the Cougars are 1-0 in conference play and 12-4 overall. UNLV came into the game with the best overall record in the conference, but they dropped to 11-3 overall and 0-1 in the conference. BYU head coach Steve Cleveland said, Three BYU players scored 20 points or more for the first time under Coach Cleveland. Rafael Araujo led the charge with 22 points and 15 rebounds. Junior Mark Bigelow scored 21 and senior Travis Hansen marked up 20. In the first half, Bigelow knocked down four three pointers on five attempts. Bigelow's 140 career three pointers have brought him only one three-pointer away from tying BYU's individual career three-point record. Araujo lit up the crowd with several commanding dunks. On one UNLV possession, Araujo stole the ball under the Rebel's basket and then finished the play with a backboard-shaking slam. At the half, the Cougars led by 10 and maintained a solid lead throughout the second half until a pair of Marcus Banks' free throws brought UNLV within five, with three minutes remaining in the game. UNLV senior Dalron Johnson led all scorers with 25 points, including three treys. BYU's defense held Banks, who is second in scoring in the conference (19.0), to four points in the first half and only 5-for-14 field goals on the game. In his first game in the Marriott Center last year, Banks was held to 1-for-8 on field goals.\n\nWHAT COACH STEVE CLEVELAND HAD TO SAY AFTER THE FIRST MEETING THIS YEAR ...\n\n\"What pleased me most about tonight's game was that we took care of the basketball. We were unselfish with the ball, and we had as good an execution offensively as we have had all year. Whether on the road or at home, every game is going to be like this. I was happy with the improvement that I saw on the team, and that is the most positive thing about it all. To win the basketball game makes it all even better.\"\n\nLAST GAME IN VEGAS - COUGAR COMEBACK FALLS SHORT\n\nLAS -- BYU's comeback effort fell one shot short when UNLV's Vince Booker hit a three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Rebels a 73-70 win in Las Vegas. The Cougars (14-7, 4-4) fought back after being down by as many as 16 points to tie the game at 70 with 15 seconds remaining on a Jared Jensen layup. Jensen finished the game with 12 points and seven rebounds, continuing his consistent conference play. BYU forward Bart Jepsen played 22 key minutes to help the Cougars get back in the game. On the final play of the game, UNLV point guard Marcus Banks held the ball for 10 seconds before he drove to the basket, ultimately passing the ball out to Booker who then hit the game-winner. BYU shot 61 percent from the field in the second half but missed free throws at key points hurt the Cougars. Although BYU made 15-of-20 attempts, many of those misses were front-end shots on one-and-one opportunities. The Cougars fought back to bring the game within one, 54-53, after a Matt Montague drive and pass to Jepsen who finished the play with a dunk. UNLV (12-8, 4-4) then went on a 6-0 run before Eric Nielsen made a three-point play to bring BYU back within three. Nielsen was hit in the mouth, chipping his tooth and was briefly knocked out at the 4:13 mark. He left the game with a concussion after contributing 14 points on 6-of-10 shooting. The score was 69-66 before Hansen stole the ball and made two free throws after being fouled on the breakaway, making the score 69-68 with 1:20 remaining. Hansen finished with 21 points in 23 minutes as he spent much of the game on the bench in foul trouble. Jensen's put-back made it 70-70 before Booker's three-pointer dashed the Cougars' hopes of victory. Mark Bigelow finished with 13 points. The Rebels started the game with a hot and consistent hand, making the first five shots they took to build an 11-5 lead. By the time Las Vegas had built the lead to 21-6, the Runnin' Rebels were 9-for-11 while BYU was 2-of-13 on shot attempts. A three-point play by Hansen again brought the Cougars within nine, 32-23, but the Rebels then went on a run of their own to increase their lead to 16 points, 43-27. Jimmy Balderson made four consecutive free throws to bring the score to 43-31 at the 1:20 mark where it would remain for the rest of the half. The Cougars made only 11-of-31 shots (36 percent) compared to UNLV's 17-of-31 (55 percent) from the field in the first half.\n\nWHAT COACH STEVE CLEVELAND HAD TO SAY IN LAS VEGAS LAST YEAR ...\n\n\"To win on the road, you have to rebound and make free throws and those are two things we didn't do well in the last few minutes of the game.\"\n\nBYU'S LAST GAME -- COUGARS SWEEP FRONT RANGE WITH CSU WIN\n\nFT. COLLINS, Colo. (February 10. 2003) -- Travis Hansen scored a season-high 27 points to lead BYU to a 77-68 victory over CSU Monday. After winning at Wyoming Saturday, the victory gave the Cougars their first Front Range road sweep since 1992-93. The win is the first for the Cougars in Ft. Collins since the 1993-94 season. BYU improves to 17-5 on the season and atop the MWC standings with Utah at 6-1. The Cougars have a 6-1 conference record for the first time since 1994-95 in the WAC. That team started 8-1. CSU drops to 14-8 overall and 3-4 in the conference. \"This was a very satisfying weekend for us and we will enjoy it, but we need to get back to work and try to play the best we can every game,\" BYU head coach Steve Cleveland said. Back in the starting lineup for the second consecutive game, guard Kevin Woodberry had his best performance of the season and a BYU career-high with 17 points, including three treys, five assists and five steals. \"I just wanted to be solid on defense and be more aggressive on offense and that's what I did,\" Woodberry said. \"I felt comfortable and they left me open and I knocked them down.\" Mark Bigelow added 21 points on 5-of-16 shooting. Bigelow was 9-for-9 from the line and moved into BYU's top 20 in scoring all-time with 1174 career points. BYU broke a 33-33 halftime tie with a 14-1 run to open the final half, jumping out to a 13-point lead at 47-34 with 15:25 left. Hansen took over in the second half and sparked the run. The senior scored nine points during the stretch. BYU led by 12 on a three-pointer by Bigelow with just over 10 minutes to play, but CSU dropped a five-point play on the Cougars with a trey and foul underneath, adding two free throws, to cut the lead to 57-50. As in Laramie on Saturday, BYU stretched out to a lead against the Rams and then withstood every push the Rams made with big buckets. BYU held on to a nine-point lead with 6:06 to play when Araujo picked up his fourth foul. CSU stayed close on back-to-back threes by Andy Birley, bringing the Rams to within six with just under six minutes left. Moments later CSU center Matt Nelson scored and was fouled by Araujo sending him to the bench. Nelson's play cut the lead to four with three-and-a-half minutes left. Down the stretch BYU got stops when they needed them and knocked down clutch free throws to seal the game. BYU was 19-of-21 from the stripe (91 percent). The Cougars played great defense on CSU forward Brian Greene. With Hansen assigned to guard him, the Rams second-leading scorer (13.4 ppg) was not a factor as he spent most of the first half on the bench with two fouls and no points. Greene did not score until the 2:05 mark in the second half and finished the game with two points. Andy Birley led the Rams with 18 points on six treys. Nelson added 16 and Ronnie Clark chipped in 13. The Cougars managed to enter the locker room at halftime tied at 33 despite great shooting by the Rams. At one point CSU made 11 straight field goal attempts. That streak came to an end with 52.9 seconds left before the break on a missed jam by Ronnie Clark, who paced the Rams with 11 first-half points. BYU was out-shot 65 percent to 39 percent in the first half but capitalized on 11 Rams' turnovers to stay in the game. BYU big men Araujo and Jensen went just 1-for-4 from the floor in the opening half, scoring just two points between them on a layup by Jensen. The Rams shot 50 percent for the night, including 6-of-12 three-point shooting, while converting 66.7 percent from the line. The Rams had a 30-27 edge on the glass. BYU shot 46.3 percent from the floor, including 8-of-19 threes, along with a season-high 90.5 free throw shooting.\n\nCOUGAR BRIEFING\n\nLed by senior guard Travis Hansen, junior swingman Mark Bigelow and junior center Rafael Araujo, the Cougars (17-5) earned an 11-4 non-conference record and are tied for first with Utah atop the MWC standings at 6-1.
