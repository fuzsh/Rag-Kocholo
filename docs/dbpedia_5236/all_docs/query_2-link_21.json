        "text": "PRICE – Utah State Eastern Head Men's Basketball Coach Adjalma \"Vando\" Becheli is entering his eighth season leading the Eagles.\n\nWe caught up with Coach Vando to discuss his journey to Price and get to know him a little bit better.\n\nLast season Coach Vando eclipsed his 100 win of his career at USU Eastern and led his team to the Region XVIII Tournament semifinals.\n\nQ:This is going to be your eighth season as Head Coach, how would you describe your first seven seasons in the position?\n\nCoach Vando:\"The first couple seasons for me I gained a lot of experience and I learned how college basketball works in America. I made a lot of contacts with coaches and people who could help me with recruiting and I had to adjust my coaching style since I was dealing with kids again. Before this experience I coached ten years in Brazil at the professional league and I was familiar with grown men and here at the college level I had to be a teacher of the game and be a mentor to the young men on and off the court. After that I think that my network grew a lot and I was able to recruit better, and I was completed adjusted at the American way to play basketball. It's been a great journey for me working with the young men in my program and to have an opportunity to teach the game to them and make them become better players and most importantly help them be a better human being and have a chance to have success in life through basketball.\"\n\nQ:What are you most excited about for this upcoming season?\n\nCoach Vando:\"I am very excited about the next season because we will have high character kids who are willing to compete and represent the USU Eastern the best they can.I think that we will have a young but talented group and this is makes me very happy to compete this upcoming season.\"\n\nQ:What is your favorite part of coaching at USU Eastern? ​​​​​​​\n\nCoach Vando: \"USU Eastern is an awesome place to work because all the people who is involved with the college are great people and they are willing to help you as much as they can. The administration here loves athletics and for me as a coach that is very important. The fans here are one of the biggest reasons why I love to coach here at USU Eastern because they are very supportive and they come to the games and really give us a lot of energy.​​​​​​​\"\n\nQ:When you came to the United States, how did you end up in Price?​​​​​​​\n\nCoach Vando: \"I coached a few players who played in the NBA and one of them was Rafael Araujo who played for BYU and then was drafted by the Toronto Raptors and after two years there was traded to the Utah Jazz. He was teammate with former USU Eastern Coach Chris Craig and this is the connection. I meet Coach Craig when he played for the Arizona Western College with Rafael Araujo and Craig was supposed to play professionally for me in Brazil but it didn't work out. When Craig got the job here at USU Eastern as the head coach he contacted Araujo and asked him if I would have interest in coming to Price to be his assistant coach. After that I came here and have worked here since the 2008-2009 season.\"\n\nQ:What has been the biggest adjustment for you coming to United States? ​​​​​​​\n\nCoach Vando: \"I always had a dream to come to America and coach here so I think my biggest adjustment was to build my network here in America and build a trustable relationships with coaches at all different levels and prove to them that me as a Brazilian basketball coach knows what I'm doing. I want other coaches to trust me so they can send their players to play for me and recruit my players after I have coached them here at USU Eastern.\"\n\nQ: Who has had the most influence on your coaching career? ​​​​​​​\n\nCoach Vando: \"I have had some coaches that really influenced my coaching philosophy like a coach in Brazil who coached our Olympic team for years and I was blessed to be his assistant. The other one is Greg Popovich who is the actual the USA Basketball head coach and the San Antonio Spurs\n\nQ:Outside of basketball, what are some of your favorite hobbies?\n\nCoach Vando: \" I'm a family guy so I love spend time with my wife and my son. He is 18 months old and spending time with him is my favorite thing. I love to go and visit new places and I love to have a Brazilian barbecue in my backyard.\"\n\nQ:Someone once told us that you like shoes, what is your favorite pair of shoes?\n\n:\"Yes, I'm a shoeholic for sure. I love old school shoes, especially those ones that in certain time in my life I wore them. I have retro shoes that remind me of certain times of my life. Of course my favorite shoes are the Jordan IV's.\"\n\nQ:If there was a movie to be made about your life, what actor would play you? That's a great question because I love movies and I spend time at home watching all kinds of movies. If had to choose an actor to play me I would say Keanu Reeves. He is one of my favorite actors.\"\n\nQ: On long road trips what do you do to make the time go by better?\n\nCoach Vando:\"When I'm not driving, I like to sleep as much as I can. During the long road trips I can fall sleep very easy when I'm not driving."
