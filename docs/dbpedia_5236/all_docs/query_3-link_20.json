        "text": "By Zac Layton\n\nThe Enforcer is back in Utah.\n\nBYU fans remember the days. So do the University of Utah, UNLV, New Mexico, Wyoming and every other Mountain West Conference basketball program.\n\nGuards feared him. Centers despised him.\n\nThose were the days when a loveable, yet aggressive, big man from Brazil roamed the paint at BYU. That big man, affectionately known as Rafa, is former BYU star Rafael Araujo.\n\nA lot has happened since 2004 when Araujo was surprisingly picked No. 8 overall in the NBA draft by the Toronto Raptors, shortly after tearing apart college defenses for 18 points and 10 rebounds per game and being named the MWC Co-Player of the Year.\n\nSure he is richer, wiser and older now. But something happened in Toronto that he wasn''t used to. He was labeled a bust, a disappointment, a waste of a draft pick. The Toronto media loved to hate him and the fans hated to love him.\n\nBarely given a chance to succeed, Araujo averaged less than three points in 12 minutes per game. His shelf life with the Raptors had expired after only two tough seasons.\n\nRe-enter the Enforcer.\n\nAcquired by the Utah Jazz on June 8, 2006, Araujo was given a new lease on his NBA career.\n\n'I''m really happy to be back ,' Araujo said.\n\nApparently, Jazz management is happy he''s back too. Jazz assistant coach Scott Layden is pleasantly surprised with Araujo''s attitude and desire.\n\n'His attitude, in a word, is excellent,' Layden said. 'He''s been terrific. He''s excited to be here and he is willing.'\n\nThe word most often heard around the Jazz block in describing Araujo is conditioned. Gone are the layers of baby fat and extra weight he carried at BYU and Toronto. Araujo came into camp trim, resembling the Incredible Hulk minus the green.\n\n'You see how hard he''s worked on his body, the great shape he''s in -- he''s great,' Layden said.\n\nLayden isn''t the only one noticing.\n\n'He''s done a better job of getting in shape to play,' assistant coach Phil Johnson said. 'I think he really wants to play here because he''s worked hard with his conditioning.'\n\nThough the struggle in Toronto muffled his game, one aspect of Araujo''s game that hasn''t dwindled in the NBA is his aggressiveness. This, more than anything, delights the Jazz coaches. It''s been a while since Utah''s had a dominating presence inside. That presence was Karl Malone. Since Malone''s departure to the Los Angeles Lakers in search of the elusive championship ring, Utah has stuttered and stumbled its way through big men. Araujo is showing Utah he is as aggressive as NBA centers come.\n\n'I like his aggressiveness. He''s trying to play hard, trying to be physical and he''s trying to have a physical presence in the paint,' assistant coach Tyrone Corbin said.\n\nAraujo is just trying to do his job.\n\n'I just go over there and play hard, that''s how I play. I try to go over there and do my best,' he said.\n\nAraujo expects to lift the Jazz to the next level, the playoffs, by the little things that he is already doing.\n\nThough the collective feeling is positive, there is admittance by Jazz coaches that he has a lot of learning to do.\n\n'He simply has to learn to play within what we''re doing, and not worry about scoring so much. That''s going to be new for him,' Johnson said.\n\n'We like his aggressiveness, but he''s gotta learn what he can get away with. He''s gotta be a little smarter on the floor,' Corbin said.\n\nAraujo''s road to dominance in Utah may be long and tough, but he has prevailed through tough before.\n\nLayden has no doubts Araujo can be a great NBA player. Araujo''s passion, he said, will enable the Enforcer to excel in Utah."
