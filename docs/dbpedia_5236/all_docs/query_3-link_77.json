        "text": "By Chad Warren\n\nA capacity crowd came decked out in coordinating blue and white colors to witness the Cougar basketball team seal a perfect home record by defeating the University of Utah Runnin'' Utes in the Marriott Center Monday, March 1, 2004 70-57.\n\nMonday''s win over Utah lifts BYU to 9-4 in the Mountain West Conference (19-7 overall), and gives them a guaranteed No. 2 seed in next week''s MWC tournament. The victory also solidifies their advantage over Utah for a probable at-large berth in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe Cougars got the best of the Utes primarily on the immovable defense of Kevin Woodberry and the explosive play of Mark Bigelow and Mike Hall, who scored 19 and 21 points respectively. Rafael Araujo also gave BYU a needed boost by leading a 10-3 run early in the second half that would give the Cougars control of the game and the eventual win.\n\nEarly in the game Monday, the Utes got started shooting the ball well and going out in front by eight in the first minutes. The Cougars struggled to keep pace with the Utes, who built a 10-point lead with 9:38 remaining in the first half on an Andrew Bogut put-back.\n\nThat was before the Cougars took control.\n\nTo get the game back in reach, Bigelow first hit a three-pointer to get the momentum moving for Hall who scored six consecutive points for the Cougars capped with a steal from Ute Nick Jacobson that he finished with a two-handed dunk to tie the game at 17-17 with 6:14 remaining in the half.\n\nWith the game tied, the two teams fought for control of the game with the ball changing hands several times before Hall would again score to put the Cougars up 21-19 with 2:20 remaining in the half. BYU continued to carry the momentum until the end of the half, scoring five more to put the Cougars up at halftime, 26-19.\n\nHall and Bigelow carried the Cougar roster throughout the half, taking advantage of Utah''s 14 turnovers and combining for 17 points.\n\nIn the second half, the Utes managed to grab four quick points before the Cougars got moving again. Like in the first, Bigelow sparked the Cougar momentum when at 17:46, he drove for a lay-up that started a 10-3 BYU run that saw Rafael Araujo put up eight straight points for the Cougars.\n\nBYU would later extend their lead further, when, with 5:51 remaining, Garner Meads drove for a lay-up that put the Cougars up by 11 with the score, 50-39.\n\nThe determined Utes continued to challenge BYU''s lead in the remaining minutes of the half, but turnovers and solid defense allowed BYU to continue to maintain control and take the win.\n\nThe Utes ended with 23 turnovers on the night compared to BYU''s seven.\n\nLeading the Cougars were Hall and Bigelow, followed by Araujo who produced solid numbers for the Cougars, scoring 16 points and grabbing 4 rebounds.\n\nLeading the Utes was Jacobson with 14 points followed by Tim Frost with 11.\n\nThe Cougars managed to maintain control over freshman standout Andrew Bogut Monday who finished below his season average, scoring 10 points.\n\nMonday BYU honored its graduating senior squad members for their contributions to BYU basketball. The six honored Cougars included Rafael Araujo, Mark Bigelow, Ricky Bower, Luis Lemes, Jake Shoff and Kevin Woodberry.\n\nThe Cougars now look to grab their twentieth win in their last game of the regular season against UNLV, Saturday in Las Vegas."
