        "text": "A few years ago, a young friend of mine […] was on one of the college basketball teams in the state. He was a great young man and a very good ballplayer. But he wasn’t playing as much as he’d hoped he would. His particular talents and skills simply weren’t exactly what that team needed at that stage of their development, or his. That happens in athletics. We deal with it all the time.\n\nSo with the full support and best wishes of his coaches and his teammates, my young friend transferred to another school, where he hoped he might contribute a little more.\n\nAs fate would have it, things clicked at the new school and my friend soon became a starter. And wouldn’t you know it, the schedule–determined years before these events transpired–had this young man returning to play against his former team, in Salt Lake City in the then-named Delta Center.\n\nWhat happened in that game has bothered me to this day and I am seizing this unusual moment to get it off my chest. [laughter]\n\nThe vitriolic abuse that poured out of the stands on this young man’s head that night […] what was said, and done, and showered upon him and his wife and his parents, should not have been experienced by any human being anywhere at any time–whatever the sport, whatever the university, or whatever his personal decisions had been about either of them.\n\nBut here’s the worst part. The coach of that visiting team–something of a legend in the profession, actually–turned to him after a spectacular game, and said “What is going on here? You’re the hometown boy who’s made good. These are your people. These are your friends,” he said.\n\nBut worst of all, he then said, in total bewilderment, “Aren’t most of these people members of your church?”\n\nThe day after that game, when there was some public reckoning and call to repentance over the incident, one young man said, in effect, “Listen, we’re talking about basketball here–not Sunday School. If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. We pay good money to see these games. We can act the way we want. We check our religion at the door.”\n\nWe check our religion at the door?\n\nWe should NEVER check our religion at the door.\n\n[…]\n\nNo, someone in life, someone in all these situations has to live his or her religion. It’s easy to be righteous when things are calm and life is good and everything is smooth. […]\n\nWhen there is pressure and fatigue. Anger or fear. […] Will we be faithful then?"
