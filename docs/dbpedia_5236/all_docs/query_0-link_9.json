        "text": "PROVO — Ellen Oliveira makes it clear she is not a basketball fan. The Brigham Young University graduate student, and native of Brazil, readily admits that she has never watched her fellow countryman, Cougar star Rafael Araujo, play hoops. She has never even met the senior center.\n\nStill, for Oliveira, there is a strong sense of national pride, even if it is a little vicarious, knowing that a Brazilian is excelling at a sport at BYU that is so popular in the United States.\n\n\"Everyone talks about him, everyone knows him, even though I don't,\" Oliveira says. \"It makes you proud to be a Brazilian, knowing there is someone as good as he is. He's Brazilian and I'm happy for that.\"\n\nRafael Araujo (Hahf-igh-L awr-ruh-OO-zjoh) is one of two Brazilian starters on the BYU basketball team, along with guard Luiz Lemes. Oliveira figures it's about time she witness this phenomenon for herself. Told about today's basketball game at the Huntsman Center between BYU and arch-rival Utah at 1 p.m., she replied, \"I'll have to watch that (on TV).\"\n\nWhile Oliveira may learn a little about basketball because of Araujo and Lemes, the campus at large may be learning a little about Brazil because of the pair of players from Sao Paulo. (What's more, a trio of Brazilians helped lead the BYU men's volleyball team to the NCAA championship game last spring.)\n\n\"For sure, the prominence of Brazilian athletes has raised general awareness of Brazil and made it higher profile,\" said Christopher Lund, a BYU professor of Portuguese.\n\nMeanwhile, those who are fans of both BYU basketball and Brazil are relishing this serendipitous confluence of the two.\n\n\"It's cool how people are starting to pronounce (Araujo's) name right, finally,\" said Spencer Lythgoe, a math major who served an LDS Church mission to Brazil. \"At first, we heard all sorts of pronunciations. Now, everyone just knows him as 'Hoffa.' It seems like more people are becoming aware of Brazil now because he's in the spotlight.\"\n\nCertainly, the Brazilian influence on BYU's campus isn't limited to the basketball court. While there are only 74 Brazilian students at BYU, according to the schools International Students Office, 1,291 LDS returned missionaries who served in Brazil populate the student body — about nine percent of all returned missionaries on campus. About one in 10 LDS missionaries are called to serve in Brazil, which is home to 26 missions. \"Everyone you know knows someone who went to Brazil,\" Lythgoe says.\n\nWhenever Araujo ventures around campus — from the Marriott Center to the BYU Creamery or on his way to class — he is invariably approached by strangers who strike up a conversation with him in Portuguese.\n\n\"People always talk to me,\" Araujo says. \"They are excited. They are happy to have someone to talk to from Brazil.\"\n\n\"Everywhere we go, they speak Portuguese,\" Lemes says. \"People bring Brazilian flags to games, they stop us to practice their Portuguese. I love it. It's like everybody knows you. It makes you feel like you're home.\"\n\n\"You have to be careful speaking Portuguese around here,\" says Walter Roese, a Brazilian who was hired recently as BYU's director of basketball operations. \"It's incredible. The returned missionaries have so much love for Brazil.\"\n\nThere is no official Brazilian club at BYU, but given the high concentration of students who have lived in Brazil, the school probably doesn't need one.\n\n\"There's a huge Brazilian presence on campus,\" says Mike Lauritzen, who served a mission to Germany and is president of a campus club that participates in Capoeira, a Brazilian sport that blends elements of dance, music and martial arts. \"You can't go anywhere without hearing Portuguese.\"\n\nLund, who has taught at BYU since 1992, has noticed more Brazilian students now at BYU than ever before.\n\n\"I can't remember the last time I had native Brazilians in my upper division classes,\" he says. \"I have three right now. The last couple of years it's proliferated. It used to be we had a lot of Portuguese students. Now, they're being eclipsed by Brazilians. They're everywhere, not just in our department. There's definitely a clannishness there.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, because there are so many Portuguese-speaking students on campus, BYU boasts a renowned Portuguese curriculum. Oliveira is not LDS, but she was drawn to Provo because of that fact.\n\n\"They have one of the best Portuguese programs in the country here,\" she says. \"There are more graduate programs here than you have in Brazil. This is the place to be.\"\n\nStudents at BYU are more skilled with the language than their counterparts at other schools because they have spent considerable time in Brazil, says Eduardo Da Silva, another Brazilian graduate student.\n\n\"That's the unique situation here,\" Da Silva says. \"Last semester, I had a class with 28 returned missionaries. People want to talk to you because of where you are from, because they know your culture. They like the food, the music of Brazil. It's really nice. They know a lot about my county. It's really impressive. You won't find that at many other campuses.\"\n\nFor returned missionaries from Brazil, Portuguese courses allow them to hone their language skills, learn more about the Brazilian history and culture, and indulge their affinity for Brazil.\n\n\"My Portuguese is better now than it was when I came home from my mission because I've had the opportunity to take classes and speak with Brazilians,\" says Vanessa Swenson, a returned missionary and Portuguese major. \"Now that there are more Brazilians here, we have more of an avenue to celebrate Brazilian-ness. People call me half-Brazilian. I really do feel half-Brazilian. I listen to Brazilian music all the time. I've got movies in Portuguese. My friends and I, with or without Brazilians, will talk in Portuguese.\"\n\nSeeing Americans caught up in everything Brazilian is gratifying to Oliveira.\n\n\"So many people here are happy to talk about Brazil,\" she says. \"It's nice to see that people love it that much.\" For those who suffer from homesickness for Brazil, there are a few short-term cures short of purchasing an airplane ticket to Rio de Janeiro. A pair of restaurants in Utah County, Tucanos Brazilian Grill and Rodizio Grill, offer Brazilian-style barbecue cuisine.\n\n\"It's as close as you can get to Brazil. Not as close as you'd like it to be,\" Roese says. \"In Brazil, you go to a barbecue place and there's 30-40 different types of meat. Here, you get three or four. It's so much cheaper in Brazil.\"\n\nA popular Brazilian soft drink, Guarana, is sold at the BYU Bookstore, as well as at Latin stores and restaurants around Utah County. Sold in a can for about $1, Guarana is a beverage derived from a berry found in the Amazon.\n\n\"When you're homesick,\" Roese says, \"you go and get a drink of Guarana.\"\n\nThese days, it goes down well while watching BYU basketball games, too."
