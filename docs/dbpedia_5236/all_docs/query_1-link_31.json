        "text": "The development of the Poisson match as a model used in the prediction of the outcome of football matches is described. In this context, many interesting modelling projects arise that are suitable for undergraduate, final year students. In a narrative that discusses the author’s engagement with this model and other related models, the paper presents a number of these projects, their attractions and their pitfalls, and poses a number of questions that are suitable for investigation. The answers to some of these questions would be worthy of the attention of the administrators of their respective sports.\n\nIllustrated by examples of both good and poor practice, this paper makes a plea for sports historians to utilize more statistics in their studies. It accepts that some research is not amenable to a quantitative approach, but suggests that generally counting and basic statistical display can benefit the researcher. Numbers enable comparisons to be made, events to be put in perspective, and the typical to be distinguished from the unusual. However, statistical evidence needs to be rigorously checked for reliability and validity and in undertaking statistical research the quantitative sports historian must not neglect their skills as historians.\n\nSoccer matches are used to illustrate the interpretation of linear regression coefficients when the independent variable is dummy. By counting the number of goals in each game, creating a spreadsheet and estimating the model, students become actively engaged in learning process. Our framework is simply adapted for others sports and has no cost. In addition, the exercise is easily conducted by the instructor and highly enjoyable for the pupils. With this story we hope to help students not only enjoy learn statistics but also apply statistical reasoning in both academic and personal life.\n\nAbstract The need for knowledge as accurate and complete for the realities of sport performance, scientific basis of strategic decisions, tactical and operative organisation require an integrated system of means and methods for the collection, processing, analysis, storage and transmission of information related to all facets of the sport to those interested. The effective preparation of the team shall be subject to the development and implementation of programmes with an appropriate content in relation to the desiderata contained, to make these new operational information, extrapolating them from theory in the practice of athletic training."
