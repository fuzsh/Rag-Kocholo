What command, Lord, do you give your servants? \"Take my yoke upon you,\" you say. And what is this yoke of yours like? \"My yoke,\" you say, \"is easy and my burden light.\" Who would not be glad to bear a yoke that does no press hard but caresses? Who would not be glad for a burden that does not weigh heavy but refreshes? And so you were right to add: \"And you will find rest for your souls.\" And what is this yoke of yours that does not weary, but gives rest? It is, of course, that first and greatest commandment: \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart.\" What is easier, sweeter, more pleasant, than to love goodness, beauty, and love, the fullness of which you are, O Lord, my God?\" Is it not true that you promise those who keep your commandments a reward more desirable than great wealth and sweeter than honey? You promise a most abundant reward, for as your apostle James says: \"The Lord has prepared a crown of life for those who love him.\" What is this crown of life? It is surely a greater good than we can conceive of or desire, as Saint Paul says, quoting Isaiah: \"Eye has not seen, ear has not heard, nor has it so much as dawned on man what God has prepared for those who love him.\" - from On the Ascent of the Mind to God by Saint Robert Bellarmine\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-robert-bellarmine/\n\nSaint Hildegard von Bingen\n\nAlso known as\n\n• Hildegard Eibingen\n\n• Hildegard of Bingen\n\n• Hildegardis Bingensis\n\n• Sybil of the Rhine\n\nProfile\n\nAt a time when few women wrote, Hildegard produced major works of theology and visionary writings. When few women were respected, she was consulted by and advised bishops, popes, and kings. She used the curative powers of natural objects for healing, and wrote treatises about natural history and the medicinal uses of plants, animals, trees and stones. She is the first musical composer whose biography is known. She founded a vibrant convent, where her musical plays were performed. Interest in this extraordinary woman was initiated by musicologists and historians of science and religion. Unfortunately, Hildegard's visions and music have been hijacked by the New Age movement; New Age music bears some resemblance to Hildegard's ethereal airs. Her story is important to students of medieval history and culture, and an inspirational account of an irresistible spirit and vibrant intellect overcoming social, physical, cultural, gender barriers to achieve timeless transcendence.\n\nHildegard was the tenth child born to a noble family. As was customary with the tenth child, which the family could not count on feeding, and who could be considered a tithe, she was dedicated at birth to the Church. The girl started to have visions of luminous objects at the age of three, but soon realized she was unique in this ability and hid this gift for many years.\n\nAt age eight her family sent Hildegard to an anchoress named Jutta to receive a religious education. Jutta was born into a wealthy and prominent family, and by all accounts was a young woman of great beauty who had spurned the world for a life decided to God as an anchoress. Hildegard's education was very rudimentary, and she never escaped feelings of inadequacy over her lack of schooling. She learned to read Psalter in Latin, but her grasp of Latin grammar was never complete (she had secretaries help her write down her visions), but she had a good intuitive feel for the intricacies of the language, constructing complicated sentences with meanings on many levels and which are still a challenge to students of her writing. The proximity of the Jutta's anchorage to the church of the Benedictine monastery at Disibodenberg exposed Hildegard to religious services which were the basis for her own musical compositions. After Jutta's death, when Hildegard was 38 years of age, she was elected the head of the budding convent that had grown up around the anchorage.\n\nDuring the years with Jutta, Hildegard confided of her visions only to Jutta and a monk named Volmar, who was to become her lifelong secretary. However, in 1141 a vision of God gave Hildegard instant understanding of the meaning of religious texts. He commanded her to write down everything she would observe in her visions.\n\nAnd it came to pass...when I was 42 years and 7 months old, that the heavens were opened and a blinding light of exceptional brilliance flowed through my entire brain. And so it kindled my whole heart and breast like a flame, not burning but warming...and suddenly I understood of the meaning of expositions of the books...\n\nYet Hildegard was also overwhelmed by feelings of inadequacy and hesitated to act.\n\nBut although I heard and saw these things, because of doubt and low opinion of myself and because of diverse sayings of men, I refused for a long time a call to write, not out of stubbornness but out of humility, until weighed down by a scourge of god, I fell onto a bed of sickness.\n\nThough she never doubted the divine origin of her visions, Hildegard wanted them to be approved by the Church. She wrote to Saint Bernard who took the matter to Pope Eugenius who exhorted Hildegard to finish her writings. With papal imprimatur, Hildegard finished her first visionary work Scivias (\"Know the Ways of the Lord\") and her fame began to spread through Germany and beyond.\n\nThe 12th century was also the time of schisms and religious confusion when anyone preaching any outlandish doctrine could attract a large following. Hildegard was critical of schismatics, and preached against them her whole life, working especially against the Cathari.\n\nDeclared a Doctor of the Church on 7 October 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nBorn\n\n1098 at Bermersheim, Rhineland Palatinate (modern Germany)\n\nDied\n\n17 September 1179 at Bingen, Rhineland Palatinate (modern Germany) of natural causes\n\nBeatified\n\n26 August 1326 by Pope John XXII\n\nCanonized\n\n10 May 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI (equipollent canonization)\n\nVideo\n\nYouTube PlayList\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-hildegard-von-bingen/\n\nSaint Zygmunt Szcesny Felinski\n\nAlso known as\n\n• Sigimondo Felice Felinski\n\n• Sigismond Felix Felinski\n\n• Sigismondo Felice Felinski\n\n• Sigmund Felix Felinski\n\n• Zygmunt Szczesny Felinski\n\n• Zygmunt Szczêsny Feliñski\n\nProfile\n\nSon of Gerard Felinski and Eva Wendorff, the third of six childen in a proudly patriotic Polish family. Two of his siblings died as children, and his father died when Sigimondo was 11 years old. His mother was arrested and exiled to Siberia in 1838 for her pro-Polish politics and for working to improve the economic conditions of farmers.\n\nSigimondo studied mathematics at the University of Moscow from 1840 to 1844, and French literature at the Sorbonne and College de France from 1847. There he became friends with Polish emigres, writers and nationalists, and involved in the failed revolt of Poznan in 1848. Tutor to the Brzozowski family in Munich, Germany and Paris, France from 1848 to 1850. Entered the diocesan seminary of Zytomierz, Poland in 1851, and then studied at the Catholic Academy of Saint Petersburg. Ordained on 8 September 1855. Assigned to the Dominican parish of Saint Catherine of Siena in Saint Petersburg from 1855 to 1857. Spiritual director and professor of philosophy of the Ecclesiastical Academy. Founded the charitable group Recovery for the Poor in 1856. Founded the Congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary in 1857.\n\nArchbishop of Warsaw, Poland on 6 January 1862, arriving there on 9 February 1862. The city had been under a state of seige by the Russians since 1861, and the churches had been closed for months. On 13 February 1862 Sigismond reconsecrated the cathedral of Warsaw, and on 16 February he re-opened all the city's churches. Warsaw continued in upheaval with regular clashes between Russian and Polish nationalist forces. He reformed parish life in his see, revitalized charities, revamped the seminary teaching, worked to free imprisoned priests, helped start parochial schools and an orphanage, and though he worked for elimination of government meddling in the Church, the Russians circulated the rumour that Sigismondo was a spy, undermining his authority.\n\nFollowing the bloody repression by the Russians of the January Revolt of 1863, Sigimond resigned from the Council of State, wrote to Emperor Alexander II urging an end to violence, and protested against the hanging of the Capuchin Father Agrypin Konarski, chaplain of the \"rebels\". In return, he was deported to Jaroslavl, Siberia on 14 June 1863 where he spent 20 years in exile. In the refugee camps, he worked to organize the priests and charitable work among his fellow prisoners, even building a church.\n\nLengthy negotiations between Moscow and the Vatican resulted in Sigimondo being freed in 1883. On 15 March 1883, Pope Leo XIII transferred him to the titular see of Tarsus where he lived his final 12 years in semi-exile in southeastern Galizia at Dzwiniaczka ministering to Ukranian and Polish peasants, building a church, parochial school, and a convent for the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary.\n\nBorn\n\n1 November 1822 in Voyutin (Wojutyn), Poland (in modern Ukraine)\n\nDied\n\n• 17 September 1895 in Kraków, Malopolskie, Poland of natural causes\n\n• buried in Krakow on 20 September 1895\n\n• relocated to Dzwiniacza on 10 October 1895\n\n• remains translated to the crypt of the Cathedral of Saint John, Warsaw, Poland on 14 April 1921\n\nCanonized\n\n11 October 2009 by Pope Benedict XVI\n\nWorks\n\n• Conferences on Vocation\n\n• Faith and Atheism in the Search for Happiness\n\n• Memories (three editions)\n\n• Social Commitments in view of Christian Wisdom and Atheism\n\n• Spiritual Conferences\n\n• Under the Guidance of Providence\n\nReadings\n\nI am convinced that by keeping my heart uncontaminated, living in faith and in fraternal love towards my neighbour, I will not go off the path. These are my only treasures and are without price. - Saint Zygmunt\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-zygmunt-szcesny-felinski/\n\nBlessed Leonella Sgorbati\n\nAlso known as\n\nRosa Maria Sgorbati\n\nProfile\n\nYoungest of three children born to Carlo Sgorbati and Giovannina Teresa Vigilini; she was baptised almost immediately after birth at her parish church of San Savio. The family moved to Milan, Italy on 9 October 1950 when Leonella was 9 so her father could find work; he died less than a year later on 16 July 1951 when Leonella was 10 years old. She felt a call to religious life and missionary work in her mid-teens, but at her mother's request she waited until age 20 to make a final decision. She joined the Consolata Mission Sisters in San Fre, Cuneo, Italy on 5 May 1963, making her profession in November 1972, and taking the name Sister Leonella.\n\nShe studied nursing from 1966 to 1968.

Sister Leonella and her guard and driver, Mohamed Osman Mahamud, a Muslim father of four, were murdered four days later in retaliation for Pope Benedict XVI having quoted a 600-year-old text that dismissed the contributions of Islam, gunned down in the street as she walked from the children's hospital.

This Sister, who served the poor and the lowly in Somalia for many years, died with the words \"I forgive\" on her lips: this is the most genuine Christian witness, a peaceful sign of contradiction that demonstrates the victory of love over hatred and evil. â Pope Benedict XVI, Angelus Address, 24 September 2006\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/blessed-leonella-sgorbati/\n\nSaint Lambert of Maastricht\n\nAlso known as\n\n• Lambert of Liege\n\n• Lamberto, Lambertus, Landebertus\n\nProfile\n\nBorn to the nobility, the son of Aper and Herisplindis, he received a good, religious oriented education.
