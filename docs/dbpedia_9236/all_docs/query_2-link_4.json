        "text": "Germany’s roots can be traced to the 843 Treaty of Verdun, which partitioned the Carolingian empire founded by Charlemagne in 800.\n\nEra of Teutonic Prussia\n\nOriginally, the Teutonic Order created the Estate to appease the local citizens, but over time the relations between the Order and the Estates grew strained, as the Order of Knights treated the local population with contempt.\n\nDifferent Prussian holders of the privilege of coinage [among them the Order and some cities], actually committed to issue a Prussian currency of standard quality, because the currency had been debased and circulation expanded in order to finance the wars between Poland and Teutonic Prussia. However, this expansion disturbed the equilibrium of coins circulated by inflating all other prices.\n\nAs Prussia became increasingly tied economically and politically with Poland the wars became more and more devastating to the borderlands, and, as the policies and attitude of the King of Poland were more liberal towards the Prussian burghers and nobility than that of the Order, the rift between the Teutonic Knights and their subjects widened. At first, the estates opposed the Order passively, by denying requests for additional taxes and support in Order wars with Poland; but, by the 1440’s, Prussian estates acted openly in defiance of the Teutonic Order, rebelling against the knights and siding with Poland militarily.\n\nBrandenburg and Prussia: 1657 – 1701\n\nSince 1525 that part of Prussia on the Baltic, was a hereditary duchy belonging to the Hohenzollern family, held as a fief of the Polish crown. In 1618 the Hohenzollern line died out and the duchy passed to a cousin, the elector of Brandenburg. On the coast between Brandenburg and the elector’s new possession of ducal Prussia there lay another part of Prussia known as royal Prussia, it included the valuable harbor of Gdansk. Royal Prussia was fully integrated into the Polish kingdom.\n\nDucal Prussia, by contrast, was largely German as a result of German settlers being brought there in the 13th century to occupy the land and to control the pagan Prussians. This ethnic division, with a Polish region between two German ones, is one of the more disastrous accidents of history. The isolation of the Germans in ducal Prussia was irrelevant while Europe still had a patchwork of allegiances, but by the 17th century there was a trend towards independent states. Inevitably political pressure built up between Brandenburg and ducal Prussia particularly after Brandenburg acquired another long stretch of Baltic coast [eastern Pomerania] in 1648. The elector Frederick William of Brandenburg succeeded, through a well judged blend of warfare and diplomacy, in severing the feudal link between his duchy and the Polish kingdom. Poland was forced to concede its loss of ducal Prussia in 1657 and the international community recognized Prussia as an independent duchy. This achievement enabled Frederick William’s son, Frederick III to achieve the crucial next step. In 1700 the Austrian emperor, Leopold I, needed Frederick’s assistance in the War of the Spanish Succession. The sweetener for the deal was a significant new title. Apart from the Habsburg emperors’ kingdom of Bohemia, there were no German kings within the Holy Roman empire. Using the legal nicety that Prussia was outside the empire, Leopold allowed Frederick to call himself the “king in Prussia”, and was crowned as Frederick I of the Prussian dynasty, in Königsberg in 1701.\n\nGERMAN States 1679 Braunschweig-Lüneburg. Ernst August. Duke of Osnabrück, 3 Taler Zellerfeld mint\n\nThe new king in Prussia gained growing prestige and power during the 18th century from the reform of the administration and the army. Frederick William established a permanent system of taxation, thus removing from the estates general their main source of power; and spent a large slice of the resulting revenue on a standing army. This combination of an absolute monarch with a large and efficient army became characteristic of Prussia. By the time of the Great Elector’s grandson, the Prussian army numbered some 80,000 men, consisting of 4% of the population.\n\nThe system devised for keeping this many men under arms made it possible to maintain a highly trained citizen army without damage to the economy. Half the army was made up of foreign mercenaries. The other half was a shifting population of peasants from Brandenburg and Prussia. Each peasant was drafted into the army as a young man, but after completion of his training he went home to his everyday work for ten months of each year. Nobles served their turn in the army too, but the mercantile classes were exempt.\n\nBy means of a tightly controlled and lean bureaucracy, Frederick William I managed to combine this level of mobilization with healthy government finances. In 1740 he bequeathed to his son, Frederick II, a thriving economy, a large cash surplus and Europe’s best trained army. Better known as Frederick the Great, the son used these advantages to immediate effect beginning the real expansion of Prussian influence in both Germany and Europe.\n\nThe philosopher king: 1740\n\nFrederick, at the age of eighteen, laid plans with the help of a friend to escape from his father for a visit to England. The scheme was discovered and the prince is treated as a deserter. He was brought before a court martial and imprisoned in a fortress, where he was compelled to watch the execution of his friend. However, when Frederick II inherited the throne of Prussia, at the age of twenty eight, he was an exceptionally cultured young man. For four years he conducted a regular correspondence with Voltaire. He was an accomplished amateur musician, performing on the flute, composing sonatas and concertos. He authored political essays, including the Antimachiavell which proposed a blueprint for a ruler based on enlightened principles instead of the ruthless self interest admired by Machiavelli. Frederick seemed well equipped to undertake, more energetically than anyone else, the role of ‘enlightened despot’ which represented an 18th century ideal.\n\nCharles VI [Holy Roman Emperor] died unexpectedly in 1740 and less than two months later Frederick II astonished Europe by marching a Prussian army into the rich Habsburg province of Silesia. Louis XV, hearing the news, described the young Prussian as a madman. The new Habsburg ruler Maria Theresa [twenty three to Frederick’s twenty eight] was a woman of strong resolve, but Habsburg armies prove no match for Frederick’s Prussians. A series of three victories in 1745 displayed his military skill to such advantage that his contemporaries accorded him the title by which he is known to history, Frederick the Great.\n\nThe loss of Silesia [where silver was mined] naturally rankled with the empress Maria Theresa of Austria [she of the MT Thaler] and much of her diplomatic policy during the 1750’s was devoted to putting together an alliance which would enable her to recover her lost territory. But Frederick. in a preemptive strike, marched into Saxony with 70,000 Prussian soldiers. This sudden act of aggression launched the Seven Years’ War. In 1757 the Russians advanced into Prussia and seemed in a position to crush it, but mysteriously the Russian general withdrew.\n\nPrussia reformed: 1763 – 1786\n\nFrederick the Great used the years after the Seven Years’ War for a thorough revision of his kingdom’s administration. As with the reforms of Joseph II, his younger rival in Austria, the effect of Frederick’s measures was to centralize the machinery of government and to concentrate it ever more in the royal pair of hands. In the shattered Prussian economy after the war, Frederick used state subsidies to restore agriculture and to rebuild towns and villages. He funded these measures by much improved methods of tax collection and the establishment of state monopolies. Public reserves of grain were built up, so that the price of bread was kept down in years of famine. Standards of education were improved, with strict regulation of the part played by the religious orders and there was official encouragement for the sciences and the arts, and a new code of laws.\n\nThree partitions of Poland: 1772 – 1796\n\nOver a period of a quarter of a century Poland was dismembered and consumed by her neighbors. The first official annexation of Polish land was between Russia, Prussia and Austria. By the treaties of 1772 Austria acquired the region round Lvov with Frederick securing royal Prussia [with the exception of the port of Gdansk]. And Russia took a slice of northeast Poland. The next two partitions occurred when Russia found new excuses to intervene in Poland’s internal affairs. After a two month siege, and a massacre of Poles in the suburbs, Warsaw fell to a combined Russian and Prussian army. The second partition, agreed in 1793, Prussia received Gdansk and a swathe of land stretching south almost to Kracow. Russia took a vast slice of eastern Poland, greater than the territory which Poland retained, in a strip from the Baltic coast down to Kracow. A few years later the final Polish remnant was divided between the three predators.\n\nIn 1814 the Congress of Vienna established the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of 39 sovereign states. In 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War, the German Empire was proclaimed. This empire consisted of four kingdoms, 5 grand duchies, thirteen duchies and principalities, three free cities and one province. The German Empire was responsible for the issuance of coins valued at 1 mark or less. Each of the states had the right to issue gold and silver coins in larger denominations, and many did so. Their issues typically are found in coin catalogs under the heading “German States” [as opposed to “Germany”]. Coins listed under the heading “Germany” date from 1871. The German Empire lasted until 1918, when the monarchy collapsed near the end of World War I. The Weimar Republic [1919-33] arose from a national assembly tasked with writing a new constitution.\n\nCoins of the German States.\n\nTo properly understand German coinage, one must understand the history of Germany, the German States, and German cities. Before the Empire congealed under Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1871, dozens of autonomous German States and German cities issued thousands of different types of coins in many different monetary units. Inscriptions of DEUTSCHES [German], BUNDES [nation], or REICH [empire] indicate German origins. Further, German names often contain VON [meaning “of”] and you will see this annotation when a coin commemorates a particular German ruler.\n\nEarly German Gold\n\nThere are many different varieties of early German gold coins from the German States and German cities. No two are alike. All command high value from their gold content and intrinsic age and beauty. The dates after 1871 usually carry mark denominations, such as 10 mark and 20 mark. Before 1871 a variety of denominations appear in gold, such as the ducat, gulden, krone, and thaler.\n\nIn 1750 Prussia started a reform of their currency and created a new Reichsthaler, which remained in use until 1821. In an effort to find a common denominator, known as the Koventionsthaler [conventional Thaler], Austria and Bavaria reformed their currency. In 1761 the Rheinische Gulden was in the forefront of regional currencies. As a result of the widespread minting of gold guilders by the electors of Cologne, Mainz, Trier and the Electorate of the Palatinate (Rhine Minting Association), Rhenish guilders achieved significance in 15th century and became the base currency of the Rhine region. Due to a lack of gold there was a shortage of guilders in the 16th century, and they were minted with a gold content reduced by up to a half. Rhenish gold guilders were of central importance to the German monetary system until modern times. It developed into the most common long-distance trading coin in most of Europe; silver coins were valued according to their value in Rhenish guilders, and thus their rate (value) was set. The annual rent in the Augsburg Fuggerei is to this day a Rhenish guilder (€0.88 today). When the imperial minting ordinance was passed, the silver equivalent of the gold guilder became the standard coin. The Rhenish guilder was gradually replaced as a gold coin by the ducat. However it continued to be used as a coin, valued at 60 Kreuzer, until the 17th century.\n\nNapoleon changed everything he touched – in areas under his control, beginning in 1792, the Rheinische Gulden was replaced by the Kronenthaler, which remained in use until about 1840. After Napoleon met his Waterloo, Prussia began a new currency reform: the Prussian Thaler, equal to 30 Silbergroschen or 12 Pfennig. The Prussian Thaler was the dominant currency in northern “Germany.” In the south, it was the Rheinische Rechnungsgulden. equal to 60 Kreuzer.\n\nCoins of denominations between 1 Pfennig and 1 Mark were issued in standard designs for the whole Empire, whilst those above 1 Mark were issued by the individual states, using a standard design for the reverses [the Reichsadler, the eagle insignia of the German Empire] with a design specific to the state on the obverse, generally a portrait of the monarch of the kingdom or duchy; while the free cities of Bremen, Hamburg, and Lübeck each used the city’s coat of arms.\n\nThe German Empire was an industrial, military, and technological giant which dominated central Europe from 1871-1918. With natural strengths in coal, iron, and railways, a strong industrial base it operated as a scientific powerhouse, gaining more Nobel Prizes in science during its 47 years of existence than France, Britain, Russia, and the United States combined. The empire’s domestic and foreign policy was increasingly determined by two men: Kaiser Wilhelm I’s careful strategist Otto von Bismarck, and the king’s son, Wilhelm II. Guided by Bismarck, the empire slowly secured its political and military influence through a complex series of alliances. Through key, strategic alliances with Russia and Austria-Hungary, Bismarck secured Germany’s eastern frontier and eliminated the possibility of a disastrous two front war. In a position of economic and military strength as a result of Bismarck’s complex diplomacy, the German Empire saw slow, but consistent growth.\n\nOtto von Bismarck and realpolitik\n\nConsidered by modern Germans to be the “father of Germany”, Otto von Bismarck was instrumental in forging the German Empire. Although Wilhelm I was the Kaiser, Bismarck handled much of the kingdom’s foreign and domestic policy. He held a privileged place among the king’s advisers, wielding significant influence in the kingdom. A diplomatic genius, he invented a new political strategy called realpolitik based primarily on practical and material factors, rather than ideological notions. Instead of making decisions based on moral or ethical factors, Bismarck relied upon economic and military analysis of his foes. Bismarck’s actions were careful, calculated, and effective. Known for his domineering and aggressive personality, Bismarck pledged to conquer his neighbors under a policy of ‘blood and iron’. An ardent German nationalist, he sought to establish Prussia as the leader in a new, unified German nation.\n\nGerman wars of unification\n\nTo unify the German kingdoms, Bismarck engineered a series of wars to stir up nationalistic fervor. Under his leadership, Prussia led a coalition of German states against Denmark in 1851, defeating them and annexing territory. When Austria threatened to undermine Prussia’s control of the smaller German states, Bismarck defeated them as well.\n\nWith his borders secure and Prussia’s position as the principal German kingdom solidified, Bismarck turned his sights to unifying the individual kingdoms into a single empire. To do so, he cleverly created a diplomatic crisis with France, publishing a false note implying that Wilhelm I had insulted French dignitaries. When France responded by declaring war on Prussia, Bismarck played the victim to the other German states, who in turn pledged to support Prussia in the war. Led by the impressive Prussian military machine, the German coalition won a series of swift victories and decisively defeated France in just 9 months. Bismarck imposed harsh peace terms on the French, annexing the resource rich border territory of Alsace-Lorraine. Using the resulting surge of German nationalistic fervor created by the Franco-Prussian war, Bismarck declared the unification of Prussia and the other German states into the German Empire.\n\nThe German Empire\n\nUnified in 1871, the German Empire had significant natural resources, a large domestic workforce, and a highly organized society. With both the German states and Prussia’s military might combined, the German Empire was a formidable country that threatened to upset the balance of power in Europe. With Austria and France defeated and defanged by Bismarck, Germany had unprecedented economic influence on the continent. To consolidate their economic power, the German government heavily subsidized industrialization, increasing coal, steel, and iron production. Stressing the importance of high-speed, reliable transportation to stimulate economic and industrial growth, Bismarck ordered thousands of kilometers of railroads laid. From 1871 to 1913, the total length of German railroad tracks increased from 21,000 to 63,000 kilometers, making it the largest rail network in Europe.\n\n50 Pfennig Coins of 1878 through 1903. These old pieces from the German Empire command high value due to their low mintage. Earlier 50 pfennig coins are valuable also, but about one tenth value of those with dates 1878 to 1903. Further, 50 pfennig pieces with the following dates and mint marks can climb into the $100 range: 1875E, 1875H, and 1877H.\n\nIn addition to Germany’s rapid industrialization, Bismarck set out to redesign German society on the ideals of nationalism and efficiency. To encourage worker production and cultural unity, Bismarck turned the German Empire into the world’s first welfare state. He passed laws giving German workers health, accident, and maternity benefits, as well as a national pension scheme. Effective and popular among the working class, many of the social security systems installed by Bismarck are still used in modern day Germany.\n\nLeague of the Three Emperors\n\nWith the world’s strongest land army, an expansive railway transport system, and a fast growing industrial base, the German Empire was a serious contender for European hegemony. However the Germans were sandwiched in central Europe between hostile countries which if allied together, could encircle Germany. Bismarck realized that for national safety, the German Empire must always be allied with either France or Russia in order to eliminate the disastrous possibility of a two front war.\n\nBismarck solved the problem diplomatically, forming the League of the Three Emperors, a military alliance to be renewed every 5 years between Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary. Now, with this eastern and southern borders secure, the German Empire could focus on domestic concerns without the fear of a two front war. While Bismarck’s strategic League of the Three Emperors stood strong, traditional powers such as France and Britain were unwilling to provoke Germany.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II\n\nHowever, when Bismarck’s friend and sponsor Kaiser Wilhelm I died in 1888, his son Wilhelm II took the throne. An old conservative, Bismarck was the ideological antithesis of Wilhelm II, who opposed Bismarck’s careful foreign policy, preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to enlarge the German Empire. Instead of slow but effective diplomatic tactics, Kaiser Wilhelm II favored massive military investment and direct confrontation with Germany’s enemies.\n\nBismarck was politically marginalized by the king, and eventually forced to resign at the age of 75 after a lifetime of service. Bismarck wrote a blistering letter of resignation, claiming that Wilhelm II’s reckless foreign policy would endanger the empire. Expecting the worst, Bismarck made an ominous prediction:\n\n[Defeat] came twenty years after the death of Frederick the Great; the crash will come twenty years after my departure if things go on like this.\n\nOtto von Bismarck.\n\nGerman States 1902 Bavaria Otto German States 1904 Hamburg 10 Mark\n\nIn just a few decades, the German navy went from being a negligible force to the second most powerful in the world. But by creating and maintaining a large navy, Wilhelm II directly provoked the British. As world’s strongest naval power for centuries, Britain was shocked and intimidated by the rapid growth the German fleet. They saw the expansion of the German navy as a direct threat to their control of the Atlantic Ocean, crucial to their economic and domestic security. An Anglo-German naval arms race ensued, as Britain embarked on its own massive expansion to keep ahead of the Germans. Britain, desperate to contain the new continental power, appealed to their historical rival, the French, for support. On the mainland, France was wearily eyeing the expansive growth of their fearsome neighbor. Recently shamed in the Franco-Prussian war and frightened by Germany’s growing strength, France was quick to agree to the alliance.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II pursued an aggressive, militaristic foreign policy that provoked Germany’s neighbors. As a result Russia canceled their alliance with Germany and joined France and Britain instead. Adamant that it was Germany’s right to conquer central Europe, Wilhelm II continued to antagonistically expand despite his exposed borders. The conflict finally ignited in 1914, when the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated in Serbia. Austria-Hungary used the incident to assert their past claims to Balkan territory, demanding that Serbia agree to join the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nRussia, desperate to hold onto their regional influence in the Balkans and thwart their rival, pledged to support Serbian independence. Both Russia and Austria-Hungary appealed to their alliances for support, and within weeks the major powers were at war. In the resulting First World War, the German Empire was forced to fight a protracted, costly two front war against both France and Russia. Eventually the German army was worn down and defeated, resulting in the abdication of Wilhelm II and the dissolution of the German Empire.\n\nWhile Otto von Bismarck had brilliantly crafted the empire out of the divided German kingdoms and secured her borders, Wilhelm II’s reckless diplomacy led to the downfall of the nation. To pay for the large costs of the ongoing First World War, Germany suspended the gold standard [the convertibility of its currency to gold] when the war broke out. Unlike the French Third Republic, which imposed its first income tax to pay for the war, German Emperor Wilhelm II and the German parliament decided unanimously to fund the war entirely by borrowing. The government believed that it would be able to pay off the debt by winning the war, and it would be able to annex resource-rich industrial territory in the west and east. Also, it would be able to impose massive reparations on the defeated Allies. The exchange rate of the mark against the US dollar thus steadily devalued from 4.2 to 7.9 marks per dollar. It was after the war that the extreme hyperinflation occurred.\n\nThe strategy backfired when Germany lost the war. The new Weimar Republic was now saddled with a massive war debt that it could not afford. That was made even worse by the fact that it was printing money without the economic resources to back it up. The Treaty of Versailles further accelerated the decline in the value of the mark so 48 paper marks were required to buy a US dollar by late 1919. German currency was relatively stable at about 90 marks per dollar during the first half of 1921. Because the Western Front was mostly in France and Belgium, Germany came out of the war with most of its industrial infrastructure intact. It was, in fact, in a better position to become the dominant economic force on the European continent. The London Ultimatum in May 1921, however, demanded World War I reparations in gold or foreign currency to be paid in annual installments of 2 billion gold marks, plus 26% of the value of Germany’s exports.\n\nThe first payment was made, when it came due in June 1921. It marked the beginning of an increasingly rapid devaluation of the mark, which fell in value to approximately 330 marks per dollar. The total reparations demanded were 132 billion gold marks, but Germany had to pay only 50 billion marks. Since reparations were required to be repaid in hard currency, not the rapidly depreciating paper mark, one strategy that Germany used was the mass printing of bank notes to buy foreign currency, which was then used to pay reparations. That greatly exacerbated the inflation of the paper mark.\n\nEventually, some debts were reinstated to compensate creditors partially for the catastrophic reduction in the value of debts that had been quoted in paper marks before the hyperinflation. A decree of 1925 reinstated some mortgages at 25% of face value in the new currency, effectively 25,000,000,000 times their value in the old paper marks, if they had been held for at least five years. Similarly, some government bonds were reinstated at 2.5% of face value, to be paid after reparations were paid. Mortgage debt was reinstated at much higher rates than government bonds were. The reinstatement of some debts and a resumption of effective taxation in a devastated economy triggered a wave of corporate bankruptcies.\n\nThe cause of the immense acceleration of prices seemed unclear and unpredictable to those who lived through it, but in retrospect, it was relatively simple. The Treaty of Versailles imposed a huge debt on Germany that could be paid only in gold or foreign currency. With its gold depleted, the German government attempted to buy foreign currency with German currency, equivalent to selling German currency in exchange for payment in foreign currency, but the resulting increase in the supply of German marks on the market caused the German mark to fall rapidly in value, which greatly increased the number of marks needed to buy more foreign currency.\n\nThe German Weimar Republic issued several different 3 and 5 reichsmark pieces from 1925 to 1932 in 50 percent silver.\n\nThe German Weimar Republic of 1918 to 1933 issued a very few 50 reichspfennig pieces in aluminum/bronze and these are very valuable because of the low mintage. Other issues carry the same wheat pattern and are not nearly as valuable. There is a 50 rentenpfennig piece with a date and mint mark of 1923J that is about as valuable as the reichspfennig pieces.\n\nGoethe 5 Reichsmark: The 100th anniversary of the death of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a famous German writer, prompted the 1932 issue of a 5 reichsmark piece which is very valuable today. There is a 3 reichmark piece which looks similar, but is worth less.\n\nCommemorative 5 Mark Issues of 1952, 55, 57, and 64.\n\nStarting in 1952, the Federal Republic of Germany issued 5 mark pieces commemorating a long series of people, places, and events. Of the dozens of such coins issued, only specimens from 1952, 1955, 1957, and 1964 are valuable. These commemorate the Nurnberg Museum, Friedrich von Schiller, Ludwig von Baden, Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff, and Johann Gottlieb Fichte, respectively. The remainder of these 5 mark pieces, as well as 10 mark issues, command only a few dollars in value.\n\nThird Reich Military Issues of 1940 and 1941.\n\nMost of Hitler’s Third Reich coins with a swastika carry very little numismatic value. These military issues, minted in zinc, are an exception. The 5 reichspfennig has a hole. The 10 reichspfennig does not.\n\nThe Martin Luther 5 Reichsmark was issued by Hitler’s Third Reich in extremely low numbers and, because they are so rare, they command high value.\n\nGerman Occupation currency – Theresienstadt\n\nFrom 1942, the Nazis interned the Jews of Bohemia and Moravia, elderly Jews and persons of “special merit” in the Reich, and several thousand Jews from the Netherlands and Denmark. Theresienstadt thereafter became known as the destination for the “elderly transports” of German Jews, older than 65. Although in practice the ghetto, run by the SS, served as a transit camp for Jews en route to extermination camps, it was also presented as a “model Jewish settlement” for propaganda purposes. On November 11, 1943, commandant Anton Burger ordered the entire camp population, approximately 40,000 people at that time, to stand in freezing weather during a camp census. About 300 prisoners died of hypothermia as a result.\n\nDuring a 1944 Red Cross visit, and in a propaganda film, the Nazis presented Theresienstadt to outsiders as a model Jewish settlement, but it was a concentration camp. More than 33,000 inmates died as a result of malnutrition, disease, or the sadistic treatment by their captors. Whereas some survivors claimed that the prison population reached 75,000 at one time, according to official records, the highest figure reached in 1942, was less than 60,000. They were crowded into barracks designed to accommodate 7,000 combat troops.\n\nHimmler was obsessed with legends of the medieval order of Teutonic Knights which required Germanic racial purity for eight generations, the meaning of ancient Nordic Runes, and the Hindu and Buddhist idea of sacrificial detachment from the consequences of daily life. When he was given command of the SS, he molded his ‘Black Guards’ after a combination of all these.\n\nNestled on the banks of the Nogat river is one of the greatest castles of the middle ages. Built during the 13th and 14th century by the legendary Teutonic Knights, Marienburg not only served as the order’s principal fortress but during the Third Reich it was used as a Nazi shrine for mythical Germanic worship. Youth groups from all over Germany would descend on the castles to partake in a variety of ceremonies, rituals and theatrical pageants.\n\nThe leadership of the Reich found the strict military and monastic life style of the Teutonic order very conducive to the development and training the Führer’s rising generation. Within the shadows of the historic Teutonic fortress where the legendary knights ruled the Prussian lands five centuries before, the Junkers of the Third Reich completed their training just outside the wall of the lower castle.\n\nHimmler even claimed to have been the spiritual successor and reincarnation of Heinrich the Fowler, having established special SS rituals for the old king and having returned his bones to the crypt at Quedlinburg Cathedral. Himmler even had his personal quarters at Wewelsburg castle decorated in commemoration of his medieval predecessor.\n\nHenry the Fowler (876 – 2 July 936) was the Duke of Saxony from 912 and the King of Germany from 919 until his death. First of the Ottonian Dynasty of German kings and emperors, he is generally considered to be the founder and first king of the medieval German state, known until then as East Francia.\n\nAfter World War II, the Order began anew in Germany. Its possessions in Austria were returned. In Italy, the Order had changed little. A great deal of support for the care taking and missionary Order has been found in Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, and even in North and Central America. The Order’s headquarters, treasury, and archives are now located in Vienna, Austria.\n\nAfter Germany’s defeat in the Second World War, the four main allies in Europe – the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and France – took part in a joint occupation of the German state. With the original understanding that the country would eventually be reunified, the Allied Powers agreed to share the responsibility of administering Germany and its capital, Berlin, and each took responsibility for a certain portion of the defeated nation. This arrangement ultimately evolved into the division of Germany into a Western and an Eastern sector, thereby contributing to the Cold War division of Europe.\n\nAfter the victory over the Axis powers, however, the wartime cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union soon faded. In reality, mutual distrust ruled the relationship between the two countries, and nowhere was this more evident than in the difficulties over the occupation of Germany. The Allies agreed to a joint occupation, with each country taking charge of a larger zone and a sector of the nation’s capital, Berlin. Upon British insistence, France joined Great Britain and the United States in the occupation of West Germany and West Berlin, while the Soviet Union managed the affairs of East Germany and East Berlin.\n\nThe divided Germany was weak and dependent on the allies for goods and the differing approaches of the occupying powers served to establish what would become a stark contrast between the two Germanies.\n\nThe Soviet Union stripped its sector of manufacturing equipment in an effort to garner partial payment for wartime remittances, further stifling the reemergence of a strong German economy. In the western sector, military leaders from the United States soon grew concerned about the economic costs of a Germany completely dependent on the United States, and the United States began investing in German industries.\n\nIn 1946, the United States and Great Britain merged their occupation zones, and in 1947 the U.S. Government began a massive aid program under the Marshall Plan, which pumped dollars and goods into Europe to aid in recovery.\n\nCoins of the DDR.\n\nThe Soviet Union prevented the countries along the Soviet border in Eastern Europe, many of which had experienced the rise of communist leadership in the wake of the war, from taking part in the arrangement. Instead it offered the Soviet Union offered its own postwar program for economic aid and created the Iron Curtain.\n\nBy 1948, the Western Allies began the project of pulling their occupation zones together for the sake of rebuilding – a project that the Soviet Union, still worried about a Germany threat to its security, wished to prevent. Although the Western Allies made frequent suggestions for the terms under which the country might be reunified, usually involving the introduction of free and democratic elections and German autonomy for conducting its own foreign policy.\n\nThese proposals were never made in terms that the Soviet Union would consider accepting, so the continued division of the country was in many ways inevitable. In June 1948, the Soviet Union took action against the West’s policies by blocking all road access between West Germany and West Berlin, effectively cutting off the city’s occupation zones from the British, French, and American forces responsible for maintaining them. The administrators of the western zones had no agreement with the Soviet Union that required the latter to allow ground access to the city through Eastern Germany, but they did have an agreement on air access. As a result, the United States began an airlift of supplies to the stranded citizens of West Berlin.\n\nOver the course of the next eleven months of the blockade, the allies, supplied West Berlin entirely by air, landing planes filled with food, clothing, and coal for heat nearly every minute. Because it was a mild winter, they were able to keep ahead of the city’s requirements, and the extraordinary accomplishments of the Berlin Airlift became an early propaganda success for the West in the emerging Cold War.\n\nBoth East [Demokratische Republik] and West Germany [Bundes Republik], issued 5 and 10 mark commemorative coins starting in the 1960’s and continuing through modern times. These coins show dozens of different designs, and some were issued as proof coins some in silver, and some with fancy packaging."
