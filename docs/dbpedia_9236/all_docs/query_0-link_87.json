The entries cover people, places, and terms associated with points in world aﬀairs when human action has intersected with money. The reader will find individual entries on periods of monetary history (e.g., the Middle ages and renaissance) as well as on special monetary coinage (e.g., elephant tokens, drum money, papal coins) and an overview of world coinage. some entries tell the stories of particular coins, including the talent, shekel, manilla, Mercury dime, amulet coins, and susan b. anthony dollar. The text features coin artists—augustus saint-gaudens, Caradosso, benvenuto Cellini, and anthony de francisci—plus two dynasties of engravers, the Wyons of england and the roettiers of france. Throughout the entries, tables of monetary slang, shipwrecks, assay and mint marks, counterfeiters, world coinage, and shifting values of roman coins in the republic and empire provide a wealth of knowledge at a glance. translations of terms and inscriptions in foreign languages oﬀer a clearer understanding of the image or message that the coiner intended. entries in this book show how money figures in scripture, such as talmudic discussions of usury and biblical passages that mention the widow’s mite, Judas’s 30 pieces of silver, Jesus’s distaste for money changers in the temple at Jerusalem, and the price that abraham paid for sarah’s tomb. The overview covers writings by famous historical figures,\n\nsuch as benjamin franklin and Thomas Jeﬀerson, who wrote on the creation of a u.s. monetary system; and the works of authors amy tan, francis bacon, Mark twain, al-Kwarizmi, edgar allan Poe, Mary ann evans, l. frank baum, and fra luca Pacioli, creator of the doubleentry bookkeeping system. for readers seeking sociological details of monetary exchange, entries on blood money, gold rushes, Wells fargo, the gold standard, hoarding, deseret money, fibonacci’s democratization of the number system, and cocoa bean and coconut moneys illuminate particular needs and longings for money and the things that it buys. for readers looking for heroics in the history of money, entries on salvor Mel fisher, archeologist Peter Throckmorton, orator William Jennings bryan, statesman alexander Hamilton, numismatist franz seraph streber, and financier William Paterson summarize the lives of people endowed with vision and zeal. each entry lists source material gleaned from print and electronic media. i am grateful for the starting places— barrie J. Cook, gareth Williams, and Mariona archibald’s Coinage and History in the North Sea World; irvin b. tucker’s Macroeconomics for Today; richard abdy’s Late Roman Silver and the End of the Empire; and arthur l. friedberg, ira s. friedberg, and robert friedberg’s Gold Coins of the World—as well as the specialized reference works, notably, Cornelius vermeule’s Numismatic Art in America: Aesthetics of the United States Coinage; Patrick Mcanally’s The Economics of the Distributive Trades; Thomas J. sargent and francois r. velde’s The Evo-\n\n– 1 –\n\nlution of Small Change; Kristofer allerfeldt’s Crime and the Rise of Modern America: A History from 1865–1941; david sinclair’s The Pound; and george f. bass’s Ships and Shipwrecks of the Americas: A History Based on Underwater Archaeology. exceptional pictorial sources broadened my understanding of monetary history, particularly edward Thomas’s Numismata Orientalia, richard Platt’s Shipwreck, allen g. berman’s Papal Coins, and electronic picture stories at web sites entitled “tradesmen’s tokens,” “The bureau of engraving and Printing,” and “The u.s. Mint.” each of these sources points the way to more thorough studies of coin art and monetary history and lore. for the student, historian, teacher, researcher, general reader, and coin hound, the back matter of Coins and Currency includes a time line that places in chronological order some of the important events in monetary history, such as the placement of Christian symbols and islamic verses on coins, selma burke’s attempt to design a rosa Parks coin, treasure legislation prohibiting rifling of historic underwater shipwrecks, the development of fidel Castro’s interest in coin salvage, adolf burger’s assistance in locating nazi counterfeit banknotes, and the planning of the euro and afro as world currency. for quick reference to common coin terminology, a glossary supplies a definition of necessary terms (e.g., planchet, uniface, web press, plate money, bracteate) and a simplified explanation of such technological advances as archeomagnetic dating, siderography, and sonar profiling. The bibliography presents an exhaustive list of my sources.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction Money, a fact of life, energizes history as an exchange medium. Celtic coins awaited Julius Caesar’s legionaries when they arrived in britannia, bullet coins in circulation at the harbor market when anna leonowens reached Mongkut’s siam, and stone money already hacked free from quarries when Captain david o’Keefe first met the yap of oceania. The full panorama of rice money in southeast asia, playing card scrip in Canada, archeologists gathering encrusted rounds of gold from the deep waters around the sunken Atocha, and hands at the Paris Mint winding a screw press reminds the student of history that human endeavors refuse to fit neatly into categories. from a study of coins and currency, the reader learns that the many sides to human personalities intertwine the exploiter and the exploited, the greedy and the greathearted. as human action (like gathering whelk and snaring conies for dinner) moved toward interaction (like trading baskets for barley and ollas for plow points) it became necessary to standardize units of exchange—amber beads, knife blades, saw grass mats—and to create abstract transportable forms of wealth—feathered strips, shell fishhooks, lumps of bronze, and iron wheels. from marten and beaver skins, whale and dog teeth, and sea salt blocks to electrum and silver circlets, money advanced according to the demands of complex societies. greek coinage, the height of beauty and eﬃciency in the ancient world, preserved not only the silver drachmas with which shoppers bought samian wine and olive oil, but also extolled the images of athena\n\nand Zeus along with Hercules, the dolphin, and owls, cultural icons that particularized the greek value system. beyond their worth to economics and culture, early coins served their creators as tools of propaganda. across egypt, rome, Persia, and byzantium, portrait coins boasted of conquerors and governors—alexander iii the great, Julius Caesar, Constantine the great, and Justinian the lawgiver. other nations learned the intricacies of classic Mediterranean cash as camels bore coin pouches over the spice trade routes and lateen sails carried shippers and their stock of tetradrachmas to ports in arabia, Ceylon, and sumatra. far to the northwest, Celtic smithies emulated on potin the gestures and style of classic coinage. Though struck with lesser artistry than that of attica and syracusa, Celtic coinage displayed no less fervor. The intrusion of organized religion into coinage shifted emphasis from scepters and robes to holy fires and nimbate holy figures—ahura Mazda, siva, lakshmi, Christ, the virgin Mary, saint george, and angels—and audaciously pictured earthly satraps receiving coronets and blessings from heavenly beings. unlike Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Hinduism, and buddhism, the advance of islam produced a singular shift in coinage. basing their decisions on Koranic principles, which reject artistic representation of the Prophet Mohammed or of allah, rulers saladin and Jahangir of india abandoned past traditions of ego and self-adulation to embrace pictureless coins enwrapped in arabic script. The artistic side of islam found expression in\n\n– 3 –\n\nthe beauty of holy writ composed in flowing calligraphy and in the grandeur of the tughra, a signature compressed into a unitized figure as bemusing as a puzzle, as definitive as a knotted tassel. The spread of Muslims over the map altered coinage in the Middle east, across afghanistan, and into the indian subcontinent and, at the same time, west from Mecca over northern and central africa and into sicily and iberia. following Christopher Columbus’s world-changing voyage to the Caribbean, the lust for gold marked human endeavors in a new round of jealousy, perfidy, enslavement, and piracy. While peons in Central and south america struck ore into doubloons and maravedís so spain could wallow in cascades of gold and silver, envious rival nations awaited the transport across the atlantic of each season’s coinage. to rearrange the allotment of treasure, the bold Queen elizabeth i of england dispatched her privateers to rob the new issue and carry it to english coin smithies for counterstamping and adding to the treasury. licensed stealing on the spanish Main elevated men like Piet Heyn and george anson to national heroism and earned sir francis drake his knighthood. simultaneously, audacious thieves—blackbeard, William Kidd, Mary read, black bart roberts, anne bonny, and Henry Morgan—flew the Jolly roger in place of a national ensign. They took the same liberties with ownership, but omitted the counterstamp. reveling in cash from any source, pirates spread their largesse in buccaneer capitals over the Caribbean isles and up the atlantic coast, leaving behind a wealth of folklore.\n\n4 • Introduction While pirates frolicked in cash, for european colonists, specie of any type or provenance remained rare. as welcome as the trade goods and services they bought, a motley array of tuppences, sous, stuivers, écus, and cobs served settlers along the st. lawrence seaway, down the Mississippi valley, throughout new england, and south to the Carolinas. While individual wallets dwindled, the cash boxes of colonial entrepreneurs grew fat on the transatlantic circulation of pieces of eight, shillings, and guilders. Coins supplemented the more onerous iroquois wampum, rum, beaver fur baled by the coureurs de bois, georgia leaf tobacco hacked and bundled by african slaves, and various agrarian commodity moneys. in comparison to cash, crude and perishable trade and barter items sparked arguments and produced quandaries over transfer, evaluation, and storage. in subsequent decades, improvements in coin technology worked at the problems of badly worn pennies and small change shortages for everyday commerce as well as threats of counterfeit coinage and outright pilfering through sweating and coin clipping and shaving. gradually, elegant moneys enhanced national prestige with symbolism, fine crafting, and memorable inscriptions. The sophisticated ducat, dinar, koban, florin, and private specie generated by the papal Zecca replaced crude maul-hammered pieces from medieval forges. World travelers made the mental connection between the french and the franc, germany and its thaler, Japan and its oban, and the english with their long-lived crowns, shillings, and pennies. The cascade of louis d’ors, dirhams, pice, bahts, yen, and rupees from around the world filled the pockets of international merchants and enabled buyers and sellers from a mix of nations and cultures to meet on equal footing and contract business with confidence. The advance of banking from egyp-\n\ntian grain depots to the royal exchange, Paris bourse, and federal reserve bank moved money into new realms. Paper notes, scrip, and siege and fiat money produced new cautions in the minds of people who were accustomed to weighing coins on a balance beam scale and computing their worth based on the value of precious metals. unlike silver in the hand, promissory notes and bank-tobank trading required more knowledge and trust of economics and of the political alliances that bound country to country in peace and prosperity. World wars and border enmities kept the status quo in perpetual tilt, requiring embassies to iron out the details to keep commerce flowing. into the last decades of the twentieth century, money ranged free of die stamp and printing press to become functions of the stroke of a key, the swipe of a credit card, and trading in bitcoins. as the twenty-first century began, the incipient distribution of one currency for twelve european countries created a new wrinkle in international cooperation. backers of the euro shared a trust that reduction of the number of specie and note types would lessen errors in exchange that date back to the Mamluks and ionians swapping coppers at dockside. ironically, at the same time that moneyers have looked ahead to new alloys and security devices to ease diﬃculties in marketing and savings, designers have returned to the early greek, renaissance italian, and art deco touchstones of beauty, physical appeal, and intrinsic symbolism. in conclusion, the highs and lows of monetary history parallel the best and worst in human behaviors. like Marley’s ghost, the Mammon of past and present perpetually shadows the mores of the people who coin, print, and hoard money. The grand antoniniani of the roman empire, debased sestertii, Palestinian shekels, and glittering Maltese zecchini share space on the page with low-quality tympf,\n\npirate swag, brinks and Wells fargo robberies, and the Holocaust scrip cranked out on concentration camp printing presses. art, drama, literature, and film record the myriad faces of monetary ethics, lauding the epiphanies of daniel defoe’s robinson Crusoe, Charles dickens’s ebenezer scrooge, and george eliot’s silas Marner while holding up as warnings Jan vermeer’s procuress, robert louis stevenson’s long John silver, the Western scenario of butch Cassidy robbing the Katy flier, and William shakespeare’s stagy shylock, the embodiment of crude, destructive stereotyping of the Jewish moneylender. The story of currency in history spreads into the far corners of zeal and ambition—from the fevered hope of diggers of the money pit and panners of yukon streams to the religious fervor of the Knights Hospitallers and stuart kings stroking scrofulous patients with amulet coins; from the artisans who created santa Cruz feather money and african kissi pennies to the dreamers who envisioned moneyless utopias and the criminals who dabbed in money laundering, scams, and forgery. Currency, of itself, has no value beyond the paper and metal in its makeup. The human overlay of hope turns thin coins into an obolus on each sightless eye to pay the way for the deceased into the underworld; altruism and love of humankind organizes coins into a March of dimes to defeat polio and birth defects. oﬀsetting the anglosaxon bribery of viking raiders, irish swapping of slave women as cash, and bribes and hush money slipped from palm to palm, monetary history highlights the specie of old as treasure for the diver, metal detector, numismatist, and hobby coin collector. for the admirer and the curious, bright circlets on chains and watch fobs, or trays and cases of fine coins set aglitter under a museum’s bright lights bear testimony to the ceaseless allure of coins and currency.\n\nThe encyclopedia Admiral Gardner The 813-ton english cargo vessel Admiral Gardner sank in the english channel after setting sail from dover on January 25, 1809. on its sixth voyage to colonial india, the three-master, accompanied by sister ships Britannia and Carnatic, bore 54 tons of copper 10- and 20cash pieces for Madras, india, which coiners had struck in 1808 at the Soho Works in Birmingham. Brassware manufacturer Matthew Boulton intended them for the east india company as pay for workers in Bengal and Madras. each of the 86,515,344 coins bore the seal and motto of the British empire, the legend east india company, and the date 1808. Built on the Thames in 1796 by John Woolmore and named for alan Gardner, Member of parliament, the Admiral Gardner was one of a fleet of company ships that resembled Royal naval vessels in size and equipment. designed for shipping heavy loads, it carried 120 men and 36 guns, 60 percent of the usual crew and 72.2 percent of the arms that battleships required. captain William John eastfield was unable to maneuver the heavy craft in a freak gale off dover and grounded his ship off South Foreland on the Goodwin Sands. By dawn, his cargo was lost to the sea. on February 11, 1809, london publisher Thomas Tegg captured the event in a pamphlet illustrated with a dramatic view of the listing ship bashed by waves. ironically, during the industrial Revolution, it was Boulton, a respected philanthropist and industrialist honored as a fellow of the Royal Society, who solved some of england’s minting difficulties in meeting the empire’s demands for bronze coins. The issuance of privately minted\n\ncoins like Boulton’s enabled employers to pay laborers, who suffered the brunt of hard work rewarded by money deflated to half value. To ease the shortage in india, he had accepted a contract to supply coins and to ship minting machines to east india company field operations in calcutta and Madras. allied with inventor James Watt in 1768, Boulton had become a partner in the growing steam engine operation, which successfully drained the shafts of tin mines in cornwall and updated coinage from hand striking to a rapid, accurate mechanized process. The day after the loss of the Admiral Gardner, captain William John eastfield wrote a report to William Ramsey of india house from deal, Kent. eastfield expressed regret and recounted details of the ship’s departure on the flood tide at sunset. at 7:00 p.m., he summoned all hands to battle rain and northwesterly winds. Shortly before 11:00 p.m., he heard the pilot exclaiming that the ship had struck shore in five fathoms (30 feet) of water. The situation grew so desperate that the pilot lost two fingers in cutting away the sheet. The gallant struggle sapped the crew, who realized by 6:30 a.m. that the ship was lost. at 3:35 p.m. the next afternoon, as the ship filled with water, rescuers from deal saved all on board but one. The event appears to have ruined eastfield’s health. The remains of the Admiral Gardner gained new interest in 1984, when an english fisherman realized that the obstacle snagging his net four miles off shore must be the ship’s ruins. in June 1985, diving operations in 45–60 feet of water retrieved 1,250,000 coins from the hold of the hulk, which had dwindled to deck, frame, and ribs. Mounting squabbles with\n\n– 5 –\n\npreservationists over protecting the site slowed recovery of treasure. diver Richard larn of cornwall turned up copper ingots, iron bars, cannon balls, anchors, and barrels of uncirculated coins marked in Roman numerals as “X cash” and “XX cash.” The reverse of each coin displayed the etymology of “cash,” which derived from kasu, the Tamil word for “coin.” The incised latin motto of the east india company read “Auspicio Regis et Senatus Angliae” (“By authority of the King and the english parliament”). passed to a maritime official called the receiver of wreck, recovered items included one complete barrel of 28,000 coins, which preservers treated at portsmouth to prevent corrosion. To maintain the site as an historical treasure, the government curtailed salvage operations under the protection of Wrecks act of 1973. Journals, ledgers, and pay books housed at the U.K. national Register of archives supplied additional data. See also Matthew Boulton. SoURceS: platt, Richard. Shipwreck. london: penguin, 2005.\n\nAfrican money For four millennia after 10,000 Bce, the african economy lacked a standardized monetary system. Sellers depended on trade and barter in cash crops and jewels by hunter-gatherers and Berber herders before developing as legal tender such primitive currency as cowries, brass rings and rods, iron bars, gold ore, feathers, salt, slaves, ivory, and kola nuts. To the northeast in egypt as early as 6000 Bce, the use of bronze money rings strung on metal loops and worn as armlets and necklaces supplied shoppers at Tanis with small\n\n6 • African money change in debens. To substantiate value, merchants weighed them on balance beam scales. a social guarantee of security, the traditional dowry appears in egyptian writings from the 600s Bce. portable goods made up bridewealth, the massed gift of farm animals, household goods, and money that prospective husbands offered to future in-laws. Bridewealth, the focus of shep en sehemet (“marriage contracts”), a formal accounting of agricultural benefits, property, goods, and money, passed from groom to bride’s father, male to male, and implied a political union of families. among the gifts, families welcomed primitive media of exchange—lengths of cloth, copper bracelets and torques, wood and amber beads, hoes and knife blades, goats and sheep, and cattle. Some pledges proved so financially burdensome that they required years to fulfill. While the groom made payments on his debt, the obligation rewarded him with the patriarchal and social benefits of marriage and encouraged a stable relationship free from non-support, desertions, separations, and divorce.\n\nNation/Tribes Types of Money Bafia Bakwiri Bamileke Bamun Banaka This portrait coin from North Africa was minted in 322 BCE, a decade after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander III the Great of Macedon. (Guy Clark, Ancient Coins and Antiquities, Norfolk, Virginia)\n\nTo the south, an area never subjugated by Greece or Rome, sub–Saharan africans traded in goats and cattle and established a goat standard in Uganda and Tanzania and along the equator. Before manufactured coins and paper money reached the continent, in 300 Bce, black africa produced a wide range of folk currencies based on natural resources and artisanal crafting, especially in the congo and along the Gold coast. Shoppers used cowries, beads, brass or copper wires, and metal bars for small change and ironbladed knives, axes, sickles, and sabers for larger purchases. Style of trade items varied by locale and tribe:\n\nMedieval Coins The first genuine coins struck in africa appeared in libya around 500 Bce. in 470 Bce, native coiners created irregular pieces with a bold, bearded profile of Zeus wearing a ram’s horn headdress. Under ptolemy i in 323 Bce, egypt developed Greek style staters and tetradrachms based on those of alexander the Great. The egyptian king ptolemy Xii auletes abandoned impersonal and divine motifs for his own portrait coin rendered in the style of philip ii of Macedon and alexander. Greek design influenced numidian portrait coins of great kings, notably the vicious Jugurtha, whom the Roman general Sulla captured and the consul Marius marched in the streets of Rome before locking him in prison to starve in 104 Bce. in Mauretania, the coins of Juba ii honored the king and his first wife, cleopatra Selene, daughter of Mark antony and cleopatra. By the beginning of the reign of augustus caesar in 27 Bce, the numidian and Mauretanian kingdoms ceased to exist as Rome swallowed them up in an empire that ringed the Mediterranean.\n\nA profile coin from 25 BCE of Juba II of Mauritania, husband of Cleopatra Selene, the daughter of Cleopatra and Mark Anthony, bears the Latin inscription “REX IUBA” [King Juba].

Traders carried his portrait specie as far east as yemen, persia, and india. Until the 600s ce, coiners struck pieces from bronze, silver, and gold with symbolic grain heads and patterned sizes and legends on Roman originals. details from aksumite money written in ethiopic or Lessana Ge’ez (language of the free) have\n\nIn 330 CE, the African kingdom of Aksum, which introduced the first indigenous African coinage, produced this portrait piece, which traders carried as far east as Yemen. (Guy Clark, Ancient Coins and Antiquities, Norfolk, Virginia)\n\nenabled historians to study the periods and accomplishments of dynasties. in 300, King aphilas, endubis’s successor, introduced fractional coins and bimetallic shapes inlaid with silver and gold leaf. The most effective ruler, ezana, who came to power around 330, ruled from western ethiopia into southern arabia and exacted tribute from client chiefs and kings. after ezana’s conversion to christianity, perhaps by his teacher, the Syrian missionary Frumentius, aksumite moneyers replaced symbols of animism, fetishism, and polytheism with the first fiscal use of the christian cross. a pragmatic shift, the aksumite alliance with the prevailing religion of the Roman empire brought the nation into closer relationship with the Mediterranean world. in 610, the reduction of pure gold to some 40 percent ended the period of gold coinage and preceded the abandonment of aksum in 630.\n\nInland Moneys coastal countries first developed trade with the african heartland. in the 1000s, arab merchants entered Kenya bearing islamic coins to trade for ivory and slaves. For the first time, africans contemplated the religious markings that praised allah, the god of the Koran. The discovery of five early twelfth-century copper falus on the Wessel islands during World War ii increased speculation about late medieval trade between australian aborigines and Tanzania. in 1324, Mansa Musa, the grandnephew of Sundiata and emperor of Mali, made an obligatory hajj (pilgrimage) from his capital of nian on the Upper niger River to Mecca, arabia. For the first time, the outside world glimpsed his great wealth. Before Sultan al-Malik an-nasir at cairo and at Mecca, he passed in pro-\n\ncession in fine attire on horseback before stunned arabs, who marveled at his retinue of 60,000 retainers and 12,000 slaves uniformed in brocaded silk. loads of gold in the packs of eighty camels so flooded cairo’s market stalls that it depressed the gold market. in 1352, travel writer ibn Battuta, author of Tuhfat al-Nuzzar fi Ghara’ib alAmsar wa’Ajaib al’Asfar (On Curiosities of Cities and Wonders of Travel) (1354), visited Kilwa, a thriving port city in Tanzania that he described as beautiful, wellconstructed, and elegant. a commercial center, it allied trade between central africa and merchants from arabia and india. The city became the first in africa to have a mint, where sultans cast coins in six denominations. The harbor impressed portuguese explorer pedro alvares cabral when he visited in 1500. Battuta journeyed by caravan for 63 days south across the Sahara desert from Fez to Mali. he discovered that bilad alsudan (black africa) enjoyed a financial boom from the gold mines at Bambuk, Senegal, and Bure, ethiopia. Because christian governments in europe stabilized their treasuries with west african gold, Mali prospered. ibn Battuta discovered that the Malians could afford large armies to conquer neighboring fields and pastures, thus enlarging the tax base. amidst a wealth of gold, he observed that the Malians and Sudanese used as currency cowrie shells from the Maldives. as african trade with Muslim caravans imported islam, ready arab cash paid for the building of mosques and won african converts from paganism.\n\nCongo and Copper The congo prospered from its copper deposits in the Katanga region, where money first appeared as amorphous hunks of ore. at the beginning of the fifteenth century, workers formed copper into Xs and hs around ten inches high and weighing up to nine pounds. in sand molds, artisans shaped molten copper into perpendicular shapes called baluba crosses. as money, the crosses circulated in central africa or went back to the forge for reshaping. The bundling of slender wires answered the need for small change. in 1541, portuguese traveler duarte (or\n\nAfrican money • 9 odoardo) lopez (or lopes) wrote Relazione del Reame di Congo delle Circonvicine Contrade (A Report on the Kingdom of the Congo and Surrounding Countries), which explained the provenance of an unusual decorative currency from elephant country. natives lured or drove the beasts into blinds too narrow to allow the animals to turn around. daring pursuers followed and lopped off elephant tails, one of which would buy up to three slaves. From elephant hair, the hunters braided bracelets. a similar trade in giraffe tails threatened the animal’s survival until the east african governments banned the tails as legal tender. iron supplied material for hoe money, the generic name for implements, knives, and blades traded as currency and also as emblems of status and power at tribal ceremonies. iron became the choice for nuptial gifts among the Turumbu of the congo and central africa. They valued iron spear blades as a standard bride price, which established the economic class of the groom at the same time that it compensated parents for the loss of their daughter’s labor. if the marriage foundered, the bride’s parents could demand return of the blades, which became an insurance policy protecting women from penury when they fled abusive or adulterous mates or abandoned homes. The manilla, a bronze bangle bracelet, anklet, or torque shaped out of bar metal, blended jewelry with convenient storage of worth. in Mali, the display of thinbladed gold kwottenai (earrings) served a similar purpose as a reservoir of wealth and security for women and the daughters to whom they passed their jewelry. Beaten from gold ingots into crescents, these earrings bore human figures and images from nature that enhanced both the glamour and prestige of the wearer. like signet rings or pearl necklaces in the West, kwottenai became the woman-to-woman heritage that linked female geneologies. a variant on the concept of wearable currency the twisted copper wire bracelet or neckpiece often rounded at the ends to fancy knots. Worth hinged on length rather than weight, thus making exchanges easy to negotiate without scales. original to the Kissi people, the long kissi penny (also ghisi, gitzi, or gizzie iron)\n\nconsisted of iron rods from seven to twelve inches long and twisted into an anthropomorphic unit. Valued from the 1800s to around 1950 in Guinea, liberia, and Sierra leone, these unusual trade pieces carried a folk superstition that each humanoid shape held a soul. if the rods broke, the loss of the soul devalued the coin. only a shaman could regenerate the spirit.\n\nBritish Influence in the 1870s, British general charles George Gordon attempted to familiarize the Sudanese with the convenience of modern coins. To end the feudal system, he tutored chiefs in the value of money over beads, calico, and other trade items and acted out simple exchanges, such as two dollars for an ivory tusk and two bells for a dollar. Gordon explained that individual wealth would elevate the Sudanese from vassals to citizens. eventually, the experiment in offering both beads and coins to workers resulted in rejection of beads. peasants developed thrift and vowed to save their coins until they had enough to buy expensive items. in 1938, for the British Royal institute of international affairs, lord William Malcolm hailey devised a similar training system in African Survey: A Study of Problems Arising in Africa South of the Sahara. he intended to halt dependence on cattle for currency because pasturing too many animals depleted grass from the land and turned the region into a dust bowl. To save arable soil, hailey proposed that moneyers present coins stamped with the likeness of a cow or goat to make the psychological connection between actual and symbolic worth. The effort did not expunge centuries of exploitation of conquered people. a French cartoonist satirized the condescending British by depicting a colonial overlord turning the capstan of a screw press, which squashed the body of a black african slave while generating gold coins. a pompous church of england clergyman stands alongside the operation reading from a prayer book.\n\nAfrican-Style Cash as colonialism died out, by the 1900s, more sophisticated coinage appeared in\n\nangola, Ghana, liberia, and Sierra leone, where designers featured symbols relating to liberation and the end of the slave trade. a liberian copper penny pictured a dramatic scenario—an african male welcoming home former citizens freed from bondage. Modernization removed the nature-based imagery of the past. a 25-ghirsh coin struck on cupro-nickel in Sudan in 1968 pictured a suitably bureaucratic scenario, a postman with upraised staff hurrying his camel along a desert mail route. Throughout the twentieth century, african colonies tended to trade in the coin of the european overlord or in local coinage that imitated the mottoes and motifs of the parent country. Smaller, less affluent countries contracted their coinage from outside their boundaries, primarily from london’s Royal Mint while such large, prosperous nations as Ghana, Malawi, and Zambia established their own minting operations. Zambia struck a twelve-sided coin picturing an ear of corn in support of the United nations Food and agriculture organization. prosperity has not progressed unhampered. late in the 1980s, angola supported a failing economy by accepting imported beer as a substitute for the faltering kwanza. as trade on the Roque Santeiro (black market) plunged commerce into a primitive state, workers accepted company scrip in lieu of legal tender and converted it into cases of Beck’s, heineken, or Stella artois. in current times, african moneys have included the revived angolan kwanza as well as the ariary, birr, butat, cedi, cent, centavo, centime, dalasi, dinar, dirham, dobra, escudo, franc, lwei, khoum, kobo, kopek, kwacha, leone, lilangeni, lisente, loti, metical, millième, naira, nakfa, ngwee, ouguiya, pesewa.

The coins, minted in alberton, South africa, from 1998 to 2000, distinguished the continent with images on brass and silver from nature—a baobab tree, zebras, hornbills, petroglyphs of zebras, and abstract shields and face masks. edward J. Moschetti, founder and president of the World proof numismatic association, reasoned that africa’s rural underclass profited from a continental monetary standard to counter control by the american dollar, Japanese yen, and european euro. The fiscal future of africa promises greater profits from natural resources and hydroelectricity. To secure continental prosperity, the african currency Board proposes a coin called the Sheba and small change known as Moneta, the latin deity compounded with Juno, goddess of marriage.

Born around 1048, he came to power in 1081 before the organization of the First crusade. as financial and internal affairs tottered toward ruin, he shored up the military to secure his throne against two threats, normans and Seljuk Turks. in a letter imploring aid from the Germans against Robert the norman, alexius wrote in desperation, describing his dispatch of money: For surely God will never allow the scourge of sinners to fall upon his own inheritance to such an extent. The gifts our Majesty agreed to send to your mighty highness,\n\nto wit the 144,000 “nummi” … [consisting] of coins stamped with the head of Romanus and of ancient quality. and when your highness has accomplished the oath, the remaining 216,000 “nummi” as well as the stipend of the twenty dignities conferred, shall be sent to your highness by your trusty servant Bagelardus [“anna comnena,” Book ii].\n\nalexius gladly paid to strengthen his west coast during the First crusade, initiated by peter the hermit in 1096. To secure the state treasury, alexius resorted to dire measures. he superintended a debasement of gold scyphate nomismata, cup-shaped coins that he ordered struck with his likeness, and demanded the razing of public statues to be scrapped for their bronze. Many of the details of his reign survive in the Alexias or Alexiad (1148), composed by his daughter, historian anna comnena. in Book V, she lists the methods of procuring funds, beginning with the collection of gold and silver articles for melting at the imperial mint. She extols the example of her mother, the empress irene, who “deposited the sum that remained to her of her parents’ patrimony, hoping thereby to instigate others to do the same; for she was extremely anxious for the emperor, seeing the straits into which his affairs had fallen” (“anna comnena,” Book V). anna continues with a catalog of the donations of friends of the imperial family. When mercenaries clamored for pay and bonuses, in the absence of good will from Rome, alexius debated public and private schemes of fund-raising, then perused ancient laws concerning liquidation of church property. Because canon law sanctioned sale of sacred objects for the ransoming of prisoners of war, he began turning church vessels into coin. in anna’s words, leo, bishop of the church at chalcedon, “tore off the silver and gold ornaments on the doors of the church in chalcoprateia [istanbul]” (ibid.). in Book Vi, anna notes her father’s penalty for stripping the church and coining money to fund the military. When he returned from battle to his palace in constantinople, “The mutterings against him in the highways and byways did not escape his notice, and the hearing of them wounded his soul because the number of\n\nbackbiters railing against him had increased greatly although he had not committed any serious offence (ibid.).” She justifies the liquidation of private and church wealth as a last-ditch effort to acquire cash that he intended to pay back. She emphasizes that her father planned to readorn the churches at war’s end. When alexius died on august 16, 1118, of a heaviness of the chest that he had contracted in two years of combat, he left the Byzantine empire and its state church diminished and combat-worn, but fiscally and militarily secure.

Born in 770 at Keva on the oxus River in Uzbekistan, he came of age in Baghdad and apprenticed on the staff of Kalif al-Mamun. By mastering the hindu and Greek math of Brahmagupta and pythagoras, at the Baghdad house of Wisdom, he invented linear and quadratic equations, differential calculus, conics, and trigonometric tables for the sine and tangent functions. as an aid to star study, he compiled constellation tables that adelard of Bath and Gerard of cremona introduced to europe three centuries later in latin translations. anticipating the complex finance of inheritance, lawsuits, trade routes, and stock markets, al-Khwarizmi’s two math texts supplied classrooms into the 1500s. as overseer of seventy geographers, he pioneered a globe from a world map and introduced degree measurements for cartographers. he mastered mapping the heavens and publishing Hisab al-Jabr w-al-Muqabalah (The Science of Restoration and Reduction) (ca. 800), and handbooks to sundials, clocks, and astrolabes.\n\namulet coins • 11 along with the writings of italian theorist leonardo Fibonacci, who introduced arabic numerals in europe, these sophisticated number studies democratized business math, enabling moneychangers, bankers, and loan officers to express the complexities of cost, overhead, and interest and of changing money among currencies.

Bearing the mintmark eB, the defiant bird appeared on coppers that ephraim Brasher struck at Thomas Machin’s Mill in 1790 in newburgh, new york. called excelsiors or eboracs (yorks), they pictured the new york state seal and the american eagle grasping arrows and an olive branch in a star-decked pose that became the U.S. seal. The eagle that graced U.S. coins after 1855 derived from a real bird that nested in the philadelphia mint pressroom in the late 1840s. For six years, peter, the mint bird, welcomed staff attention as the facility’s pet and familiarized himself with the neighboring houses and children on the street. during operating hours, he perused the vault and observed the coinage machinery at close range, once getting too close to the flywheel and incurring a fatal injury. The staff hired a taxidermist to repair the broken wing and to stuff and mount peter for display in a glass case in the cabinet room. his noble plumage and defiant gaze, duplicated by a long line of mint artisans, remained fixtures of national specie. complaints from ornithologists suggested that the first coin sculptor stylized the bird. instead of a true image of peter, they claimed that the eagle’s wings suited his size, but the head looked like a hawk’s and the body like a dove’s. despite nit-\n\npicking, citizens approved the eagle as a symbol of american strength and resolve, thus carrying on a tradition of aquiline qualities that the ancient Greeks and Romans had admired. in 1916, adolph a. Weinman backed the Walking liberty half-dollar with a bold eagle, its legs emulating that of the striding lady liberty and its wings outstretched as though readying for flight. From the presence of peter’s likeness on large denominations, workers receiving their pay in cash remarked, “The eagle has flown.” See also Ephraim Brasher; Great Seal of the United States.

Families made protective medallions for their children from these biographical coins to bring good fortune. in the punjab, likenesses of the god Rama, his wife Sita, and hanuman, the monkey deity, adorned cup-shaped ramatankas (also rama-tenki, Rama coins). inscriptions of Ram nam (the name of God) indicated a sacred significance of these pieces at hindu temple ritual. according to local legend, at the court of abdul hassan Tana Shah, around 1650, Gopanna, a devotee of lord Rama, channeled tax collections from the state treasury to the temple for repairs. The courts found him guilty of misuse of royal moneys and sentenced him to a term in the dungeon of Golconda, a fortress west of hyderabad. Still devout, Gopanna prayed in his cell when lord Rama appeared and made restitution for the missing money with gold coins stamped with holy images. Tana Shah immediately freed Gopanna and reinstated him to his former rank. The sacred rama-tankas remained at the temple as proof of Gopanna’s piety. The anthems that Gopanna sang to Rama became classic hindu liturgical music.\n\namulet coins amulet coins, like other portable talismans, convince the gullible that objects contain protective and healing powers. The chinese made amulets from holy scrap metal. in the 900s, coiners melted down Buddhist statues to produce bronze tong bao patriot coins believed to heal the sick and comfort parturient women. The coins bore mottoes extolling health and prosperity. examples included Byzantine coins called monetae Sanctae Helenae (St. helena’s money) that parents revered for preventing epilepsy and the sixteenthcentury coin bearing christ’s profile and a hebrew inscription, which also purportedly warded off seizures. hindu amulet coins obtained protective powers both from precious metals and from the engraving of sacred figures and godly symbols. in nepal, a parturient woman could get relief during protracted labor by gazing on a rupee displaying the image, the divine protector. another indian application of amulet coins was to soak them in water and dispense the liquid to women in labor as a soothing elixir. Buddhists of the himalayas also put faith in the powers of Venetian sequins and, after 1837, coins picturing Queen Victoria. in northern india, amulet tokens from the coinage of akbar the Great around 1591 presented islam’s charyari (four friends), the four caliphs who succeeded Mohammed:\n\nChristian Amulets during the early christian era, pilgrims to the holy land obtained eulogiai, uniface good-luck tokens that conferred on the bearer ample blessings and protection\n\n12 • Anglo-Saxon coins from demons and the evil eye. Shaped out of clay to resemble Roman coins, the tokens may also have borne curative powers, a wise precaution for travelers passing through metropolitan territories rife with cholera and plague. Whatever their allure, christian patriarchs inveighed against such pagan practice. The golden-mouthed preacher John chrysostom of antioch, whom the emperor arcadius appointed archbishop of constantinople in 398, chastised audiences for wearing bronze amulet coins of alexander iii the Great on their heads and feet. The superstitious circumvented christian hardliners like John by incising on their alexandrine talismans the chi-rho, the monogram of christ, which looks like an X superimposed on a p, thus achieving protection from both new and old traditions. in later periods, gifts of quasireligious amulet coins picturing christ officiating at a wedding conferred blessing on newlyweds. Throughout the Middle ages, particularly for those people going on one of nine crusades waged between 1096 and 1291, the wearing of a coin or charm picturing St. George the dragon-slayer protected the bearer on journeys. The english and French touch coins of the late medieval period supposedly bore the magical power of a monarch who could cure scrofula, a tubercular condition of the neck glands. at the Slovakian city of Kremnitz (or Kremnica), hungary, minting flourished after a major gold strike in 1320. Within five years, the monarchs of Bohemia and hungary adopted a union money system to bypass the commercial dominance of Vienna. They based their coinage on the gold florin and the silver groat or groschen. Slovakian engravers created coins picturing biblical scenes, with old Testament and new Testament depicted on opposite sides. Soldiers preferred the coins of count david of Mansfeld or of Kremnitz as protection from wounds or from being unseated from their mounts in battle. after the Reformation, european engravers produced medals and medallions containing biblical phrases, symbols, and good luck wishes. The Viennese preferred amulets focusing on the life of christ, such as christmas disks showing the in-\n\nfant christ in a manger and easter coins featuring the pascal lamb. on the ducat and thaler appeared St. George, queller of a dragon, who supposedly warded off wounds. a cross entwined with snakes, taken from the Greek caduceus staff of hermes, guarded people during outbreaks of plagues. other coins pictured St. Roch, who healed italians in 1348 during the Black death; St. Rosalia, whose bones saved palermo from an epidemic; and St. Sebastian, who, in 286, survived multiple arrows shot by the soldiers of the Roman emperor diocletian.\n\nMagic Amulets other examples of superstition relating to coins involved numerous suppositions about magic. Shavings from the ducats of Matthias i, the king of hungary after 1457, warded off cramp for young children. German Jesus pennies prevented epilepsy. The German alchemist medal of the 1600s struck with mystic symbols served leonhard Thurneisser, a Basel healer, as an advertisement of his skill at transmuting base metal into a healing substance. late in the seventeenth century, the chinese made coin swords by suspending money from iron staffs to wave away evil and disease. although the bearer could spend the parts as cash, the sword bore more worth whole than broken down into individual coins. Beyond the Renaissance, amulet coins continued to comfort the superstitious. pilgrims to canterbury cathedral in Kent, england, or to the church of St. Wenceslas at prague, czechoslovakia, revered relic coins bearing images of the Virgin Mary or of Stephen and other christian martyrs. in France around 1700, subjects of louis XiV bought allegorical tokens for their protective power rather than their artistry. according to missionaries to oceania, the Maori of new Zealand transferred physical suffering to a coin, which could be tossed into a flame or the ocean.

The chieftain, called the ringgiver, distributed bounty, a virtue extolled in the prologue to Beowulf in which the noble ring-giving king Beo goes to his watery burial heaped with treasure. Ring money permeated the chronicles of the angles, danes, and Swedes. The presenter of rings held honor for dispensing the plunder that Beowulf, the oldest english epic hero, mentioned in his dying speech to hrothgar. The first genuine coins in circulation among anglo-Saxons date to the gold solidi the Romans brought during Julius caesar’s invasion on august 22, 55 Bce, and the Merovingian Gallic tremisses (crowns), which reached england after 550 ce. Following a 236-year hiatus of minting by the celts, anglo-Saxon england ended the long dry spell with coins struck by a churchman and medalist, Bishop liudard (or liudhard). he arrived from autun in east central France in 560 as royal escort to Bertha to wed ethelbert, the ten-year-old king of Kent and the first rex Anglorum (king of the angles). at the height of anglo-Saxon incursions in Britain, liudard resumed coin production in canterbury around 561. he identified his enthusiasm for minting with a medalet inscribed Eupardus Eps (liudard episcopus or Bishop). in 600, copies of French tremisses appeared from mints in Kent and londinium. artisans struck these pieces, called thrymsa (or thrimesa), from gold or silver ore at the value of one-third shilling or threepence each. during ethelbert’s long reign, Bishop Mellitus of london, an emissary from the anglo-Saxon throne to the papacy, began minting gold coins in london from 604 to 616. in 1939, the valuable Sutton hoo burial site excavated at Woodbridge, Suffolk, in southeastern\n\nAnglo-Saxon coins • 13 england turned up the remains of a king, perhaps Raedwald of east anglia. Buried in 624, he lay alongside his ship and horse, silver dishes, and bronze and gold-hilted sword and shield. The cache of gold tremisses in his leather money belt included pieces from 37 mints across France, providing historians with a glimpse of cash that migrated north during trade with Britain.\n\nCoins and Commerce By 630, Saxon mints hammered out a sizeable number of coins, which stimulated commerce. as quantity increased, quality suffered. in 675, the base shifted from gold and gold alloy to silver. The primitive sceat (also sceatta), a small, lightweight hammered coin of low quality silver, few inscriptions, and little artistic appeal, emerged in the late seventh century. exceptions to these uninspired disks, the royal issue of eadbert of northumbria after 738 and of Beonna of east anglia around 750 each bore a royal name. on January 18, 1999, a sixteen-member team of the ashington and Bedlington detector club unearthed a hoard of 162 Saxon styca (or sceatta) near Bamburgh, the ancient capital of northumbria and a strong fortress against invaders whom the celts called dinguaroy. This valuable store of low value coppers with a half farthing preserved for history the early everyday legal tender of the anglo-Saxons from 837 to 848. Scattered by years of plowing, the coins emerged in twos and threes and one find of 33 in a 210' × 120' expanse. in 752, when pepin iii (or pepin the Short), father of charlemagne, became sole Frankish monarch, he issued the first denier, a long-lived silver coin on which the english modeled their silver penny. around 765, heaberth of Kent issued the first of the english version of the denier. The penny supplanted the sceat in southern england and penetrated as far north as northumbria, where a royal issue of base stycas, the regional version of sceats, displayed the king’s name along with that of the moneyer. once circulated from church mints at canterbury and york as well as from state treasuries, the sceat gradually shifted from silver to bronze before disappearing from circulation in 800.\n\nThe Coins of King Alfred Greater demand on the treasury in 871 caused alfred the Great to establish eight new mints and to increase coinage. With the money, he paid mercenaries to garrison Wessex towns against danish insurgents. The terror continued until alfred overcame Guthrum, the danish monarch, at the battle of edlington May 6–12, 878, and freed england from Scandinavian invasions. To publicize his likeness and capital city, alfred issued a penny struck with his crowned head, Aelfred Rex (King alfred), and Londinia (london). he appears to have chosen a weight and design to satisfy the danes and enclosed in a peace treaty a specie conversion chart encouraging international trade. When alfred’s successor, edward the elder, came to power on october 26, 899, he and his sister ethelflaed (also aedelfleda) strengthened fortifications at Mercia, the vast buffer zone that separated londoners from the celts of Wales. To impress on Mercian subjects the importance of strong defenses, the royal siblings minted pennies picturing lookout towers. Flanking the architecture, two lines of lettering named the moneyer, eadmund. around 905, some six years after the death of alfred the Great, danish raiders attacking northern england appear to have seized jewelry, silver ingots, and 8,000 coins struck by alfred’s moneyers. on the run from pursuers, they buried their loot on the bank of the Ribble River at preston, a market center in lancashire. on May 15, 1840, workers repairing a wall discovered the stash, which historians call the cuerdale hoard. Gray mud that coated the remains of the wood chest preserved for over nine centuries the high quality of anglo-Saxon coin artistry, particularly 1,800 coins minted by eadmund and 3,000 pennies bearing the unidentified royal cipher of Cnut Rex Cunnetti (cnut, King of cnut’s people). The haphazard burial of the trove attests to unpredictable times for the anglo-Saxons after the loss of a strong king and protector.\n\nBuying Off the Vikings By September 4, 925, when alfred’s grandson athelstan (also aethelstan or ethelstane) came to power, he warded off\n\nViking raiders, earning for himself the title of Rex Totius Britannia (King of all Britain). a warrior-king much stronger than his father, edward the elder, athelstan earned a reputation in the united realm as the ring-giver, the ancient compounded title indicating his importance to men who fought wars for a share of the plunder according to the oxford illustrated history of the British Monarchy, coins aided the anglo-Saxons in their quest for control with “a system that enabled the king to exploit the wealth of a much enlarged kingdom. it made possible the great crusade against the Vikings, and it enabled english kings to raise very substantial sums of money indeed with which to bribe the Vikings” (cannon and Griffiths 1988, 68). Under concerted anglo-Saxon might, the danelaw, the northern, central, and eastern region of england colonized by Viking armies in the late ninth century, ceased to bleed athelstan’s subjects of their resources. The king’s crack troops also kept the danes from exacting punishments on those who withheld blood money by slitting their noses, the origin of the term “pay through the nose.” For his peaceful nation, athelstan stimulated trade, built a hospital, restored abbeys, and issued a national currency, which he legitimized under the Statute of Greatley in 928. as a result, england became the first european nation since the Romans to profit from a unified monetary system. at Jorvik (york), according to the Fagrskinna Saga (c. 1220), eric Bloodaxe, a battle-ready pagan hero, instituted a violent reign in the mid–900s that resonated in Scandinavian verse. exiled from norway by his father, King harold Fairhair, eric settled at northumbria, where he led the kingdom to independence from King eadred. To symbolize his strong-armed approach to governance, eric built a mint stamping militant silver pennies with a naked sword between two lines of lettering extolling himself as Eric Rex. Safety from bruisers like eric did not come cheap. Farther south, demands on mints from commerce and warfare forced athelstan and edgar, his successor, to beef up coining operations. athelstan decreed thirty state mints plus branch operations at outlying boroughs not named in his master scheme. Under edgar (or eadgar)\n\n14 • Appledore hoard the peaceful, a strong monarch and creative administrator crowned on october 1, 959, the english government upped the number of mints to forty.\n\nThe English Penny edgar’s silver penny presented a handsome crowned monarch in profile and a broad inscription proclaiming him Eadgar Rex Anglorum (edgar King of the angles). he standardized stamps and regulated the size, weight, uniformity, and quality of coinage, a monetary system that remained the model of fiscal administration for two centuries. in comparison with the crude, off-struck specie of eric Bloodaxe and of hywel ap cadell (also hywel dda or hywel the Good) of Wales, edgar’s pennies looked almost refined. From the royal mint at cambridge, he controlled monetary circulation and focused on trade as a central issue of his serene, civic-minded reign, which lasted until his death on July 8, 975. his economic savvy produced a six-year cycle by which the mint melted and restruck money to maintain its uniformity and to bolster the royal treasury. his uniform money system survived until the Royal Mint initiated decimal currency on February 15, 1971. edgar’s peace proved illusory. The resumption of Viking raids during the reign of ethelred ii the Unready (also aethelred the Unraedy) generated a new cry for cash. in 978, the king set in motion 75 royal mints—2.5 times the number athelstan required. Together, they produced 40 million pennies to pay the danegeld (dane tribute), a bribery system that decreased the Vikings’ need to plunder or to raise ransom by kidnap. To assure quality that would satisfy the danes, ethelred passed a law threatening capital punishment to the counterfeiter, shaver, or clipper of coins. From 24,000 tons of silver, ethelred began amassing a war chest of coins in astonishing amounts: Year Amount 991 993 1001 1005 1012 Total\n\n£22,000 £16,000 £24,000 £36,000 £48,000 £146,000\n\nduring the step-up in production, those citizens holding obsolete or worn pennies\n\ncould turn them in for new pence at any mint location. ethelred’s vigorous mint output spurred envy in the Swedish King olof Skottkonung, who, in 995, imported anglo-Saxon mintmasters to strike silver pennies at his Sigtuna forge north of Stockholm.\n\nand Ralph Griffiths.

With the help of the landowner and his wife, the two men scoured the area with metal detectors and watched their trove expand. The farmer plowed the field to further loosen the soil, enabling collins and douch to locate more of the subterranean stash. The collection, known as the appledore hoard, appeared to have been buried in a red terra cotta pot, which plowing obliterated over time. Under the Treasure act of 1996, the stash passed to the British Museum for analysis and evaluation. The coins dated from 1016 to november 12, 1035, the reign of danish king canute i, england’s first Scandinavian monarch, and into the 1050s. For their historic value, the government declared them an official treasure trove worth £750,000. Most of the coins pictured the expanding cross, issued from 1051 to 1052 during the reign of edward the confessor. They bore the names of southeastern mints in canterbury, dover, hastings, Romney, and Sandwich as well as northern sites in chester, lincoln, and york. at the time of their stamping, one silver penny would have paid a manual worker’s monthly wage. in proof of Gresham’s law, which declares that people tend to hoard attractive, high-quality coins, some pieces appear to have been new at the time of their collection. except for some damage from plowing, all survived in excellent condition. historical surmise, based on the AngloSaxon Chronicle, connected the trove with the rebellion of earl Godwin of Wessex and his wife Gytha and family, who fled england in September 1051, leaving daughter edith at Wilton abbey and\n\nKing ethelred relieved citizens of some of their savings by instituting the heregeld (soldier debt), a tax levied in 1012 to pay for additional mercenaries and ships to mount a militant front before the rapacious Vikings. Vast numbers of new coins, picturing ethelred in profile encircled by the legend Aethelred Rex Anglorum (ethelred King of the angles), circulated widely in Scandinavia, a testimony to the reign of a stoutly english king and to the bleeding of the english by their enemies. one handy piece, the clover coin, projected four leaves, each detachable at a value of one-quarter. The situation worsened the next year, when ethelred ceded his throne temporarily to the danish pirate king Sweyn Forkbeard and his son and heir canute i. From normandy, ethelred raised a force and fought his way back to power, but survived only a few years. an unprecedented stash of 5,251 silver pieces found in lenborough, Buckinghamshire, on december 21, 2014, attested to the continued productivity of forty english mints. The geld remained in effect until 1162, when the danes’ internal strife and encroaching German tribes lessened the danger of Viking raids on england. By the reign of edward the confessor, which ended on January 5, 1066, england satisfied the onerous tax off the productivity of 87 mints, extending from castle Gotha in the southwestern tip of cornwall north to york. To get the most out of his pennies, edward increased mint profits by halving the cycle of meltdown and reminting.

From 1544, all english silver carried a registration stamp recorded in london at Goldsmiths hall. historic assay marks carried authority and validity. From 1696 to 1727, one of england’s most prominent assayers, Sir isaac newton, as warden of the mint, performed meticulous examinations of precious metals in an iron muffle furnace and personally wrote reports on quality.

The bold eB set in an oval of american colonial assayer and metalsmith ephraim Brasher identifies coins commissioned after 1787 by president George Washington and the state of new york. The Brasher monogram appeared on the breast of the american eagle on his famous gold doubloon. For antiques specialists and numismatists, assay marks like those of Brasher and newton, like fingerprints, identify a par-\n\nticular item or coin with a specific time and place. From country to country, markings vary. They may incorporate symbols for place of assay, date of assay in letters or letters and numbers, maker’s mark, importation or exportation mark, and tax or duty mark, as with the guarantees on gold and silver assayed under coiner Matthew Boulton after 1772 in Birmingham, england. Violators who falsified hallmarks on buckles, knife handles, candlesticks, spoons, coffeepots, and sword hilts risked transportation to an offshore penal colony. confusing historians, the repetitions of edinburgh assay marks from 1784 to 1819 concealed the work of Robert Gray of Glasgow and Robert Keay of perth. Such faulty strikes also obscured the coinage of moneyers in Banff, dumfries, dundee, Montrose, and aberdeen. The assayer’s mark, like a mint mark, often hints at the provenance of recovered coins and treasure from early times. numismatist alfredo díaz Gámez used his knowledge of the assayer’s mark or stamp to trace a single silver coin from unidentified undersea wreckage from the caribbean. aided by carisub, the marine archeology division of cuba, divers recovered money from the reign of philip ii of Spain.

Republican icons replaced royal portraits as testimony of a successful revolution, but did not calm fears of a low supply of coins. Because of citizen hoarding, media mockery, and widespread counterfeiting, market inventories fell to a dangerous low in food, clothing and shoes, nails, leather, cloth, corn, fuel, wood, and medicines. The new assignats funded the interim government and maintained commerce from april 17, 1790, until april 1793, when the French parliament banned two-stage pricing in coins and assignats. The ornately bordered paper bills displayed the denomination, the date based on the republic’s new calendar, and a description, Hypothéqué sur les Domaines Nationaux (mortgaged on national domains). Moneyers at the Bruges factory defended their choice of thin paper as necessary pour arriver à leur dernière perfection (to reach their ultimate perfection). at the height of inflation in 1795, the treasury issued assignats valued at eleven billion livres. When the value of assignats fell to 1 percent of their face value, treasury printers went on strike, demanding that they be paid in loaves of bread rather than the\n\nflimsy paper money they despised. Tax collectors failed to extort moneys owed on property. on February 18, 1796, around 40 billion assignats shrank in value. officials of the revolutionary government burned 600 million notes and printing plates and presses in a dramatic public spectacle at the place Vendôme, an octagonal piazza surrounded by shops and stalls. Before disgruntled citizens, the five-man board of governors had to admit failure and suspend circulation of the despised assignats. To provide the French with currency, the French mint imported enough bullion to begin striking more coins. in March 1796, treasury officials created a new form of paper money, the mandat territoraux (land warrants), each worth 30 assignats. almost as rapidly as that of the previous paper bills, the value of the mandat depreciated by 2/3 to 10 assignats. By May 1796, the mandat held only 5 percent of its initial worth. Until the rise of napoleon Bonaparte and the return of metal coins on February 4, 1797, the French had no viable currency.

The illegitimate offspring of edward the elder and his mistress ecgwynn and the grandson of alfred the Great, the first great anglo-Saxon coiner, athelstan came from noble ancestry. after he merged Wessex with Mercia during his crowning on September 4, 925, at Kingston-upon-Thames, he had ample reason to relish the title of the first Rex Totius Britanniae (King of all Britain). exhibiting his pride, silver pennies showed him wearing a corona, a Mediterranean motif begun by philip ii of Macedon, father of alexander iii the Great. assuring the longevity of his realm, athelstan expelled the Vikings from northumbria and pressed his conquests west of the Wye River in central Wales. The height of the kingdom’s military suc-\n\ncess came in october 937 at the battle of Brunanburh, where he vanquished the combined irish, norse, Scots, and Welsh manpower under the command of constantine of Scotland. athelstan’s method of shoring up alliances required the betrothal of his five sisters to potential challengers. a founder of mints and a hospital at york in 936, athelstan worked vigorously toward modernization. he codified laws, rebuilt monasteries, and extended commerce through the circulation of silver pennies. he issued a chillingly uncompromising edict at the council at Grateley in 928 stating: That there be one money over all the king’s dominion, and that no man mint except within port. and if the moneyer be guilty, let the hand be struck off that wrought the offence, and be set up on the money-smithy but if it be an accusation, and he is willing to clear himself, then let him go to the hot-iron, and clear the hand therewith with which he is charged that fraud to have wrought. and if at the ordeal he should be guilty, let the like be done as here before ordained [“anglo-Saxon dooms”].\n\nat his death on october 27, 939, and burial at Malmesbury, the king left in operation a chain of mints, the first unified state monetary system since the Roman empire: Locations canterbury chichester exeter hampton hastings lewes london Shaftesbury Wareham Winchester Total\n\nNumber 4 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 8 2 2 6 33\n\nType royal bishop’s abbot’s royal royal royal royal royal royal royal royal royal 30 royal, 3 ecclesiastical\n\nathelstan allowed each of the remaining boroughs one minting operation. he obviously pinned his hopes for state survival in part on a unified english currency. his coins lacked esthetic grace, but maintained standards, probably because he set rigorous criteria of skill and strength for his moneyers.\n\nAtocha • 17 SoURceS : “The anglo-Saxon dooms, 560–975.” http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ source/560-975dooms.html. • Gannon, anna.

Security hinged on personal identification numbers (pin), plastic or metal tokens, and plastic cards equipped with chips or magnetic stripes. By 1971, iBM and lloyds progressed to online banking. Unfortunately for bank clients, the petite, clerkless machines incurred breakdowns during bad weather and gobbled cards. late night banking encouraged thieves to steal withdrawal tokens, skim cards, and blow up terminals with explosive gas. india met rural needs with solarpowered terminals, but, in Tinsukia, assam, staff found 500- and 2,000-rupee notes chewed by mice. although financial institutions limited the amount a patron could withdraw at one time, robbers parked near aTMs on dark nights and stole from the unwary. To stave off customer worries, banks pushed automated cash transactions with premiums and coupons, which drew a new wave of business in africa, china, Macau, hong Kong, and the Middle east. South american financiers looked to future demands that aTMs could supply—stamp purchase, mobile phone minutes, prepaid cards, fund transfer, account balance, and twoway video assistance. in 1984, the U.S. Supreme court declared aTMs outside the ruling on branch\n\nbanks. Technical advances resulted in greater standardization, bank-to-bank networking, and more off-premises locations. a variant, the independent automated teller deployer unbranded by a financial conglomerant made cash transactions available in retail malls, convenience stores, airports, rail and subway stations, and cruise lines. By 2015, the familiar robotic tellers performed 3.2 billion transactions annually that included ticket and gift certificate purchases. Simultaneously, debit cards and smartphone payments muscled in on aTM territory, reducing consumer need for cash and suppressing crime in europe and north america. in prague in May 2018, czech aTMs dispensed cryptocurrency in subway stations; at perth in June 2018, a cash machine named harry offered vouchers, free doughnuts, and sushi.

The Atocha’s end came swiftly beyond the Florida straits after the rudder broke, freeing the high-sterned vessel to slew around toward treacherous reefs of the lower Florida Keys. crew and passengers aboard the Santa Margarita watched the final moments of the Atocha before their own vessel suffered the same fate. of some 470 aboard the two galleons, only 72 managed to swim to shore. of the 123 crewmen, 82 soldiers, and 48 passengers aboard the Atocha, a sailor, two apprentice seamen, a slave, and a ship’s boy survived by tying themselves to the mizzenmast during the storm.\n\nSalvage Efforts The Spanish vowed to recover the newly minted pesos, but a second hurricane hampered salvage operations by scattering the wreckage and burying the Atocha in sand. The loss overwhelmed the treasury. To save Spain from financial ruin, in 1624, court administrator Francisco nuñez Melian returned to the spot where the mizzenmast protruded from the sea and dragged the bottom with grappling hooks to retrieve from the battered hulk bronze cannon, silver ingots, 600 pounds of gold, and 67,000 silver coins. Failing to locate the mother lode, he filed a report and map locating the wreckage. captain Juan de anuez worked until 1641 to recover more of the trove; however, seventeenth-century methods could not\n\n18 • Bailly bring enough of the haul to the surface to rescue Spain from an economic depression. U.S. treasure hunter Mel Fisher acquired Melian’s memorandum in 1970 and labored fifteen years to recover the Atocha. at length, he found a huge shelf of bars lying in place on the ocean floor atop the beams framing the hull. aided by archeologist R. duncan Mathewson, Fisher began deep-water salvage on July 20, 1985, and recovered for numismatists’ perusal some of the cobs, a coin in circulation from canada to the West indies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Seriously deteriorated and further compromised in the restoration process, the silver coins nonetheless exemplified the Spanish treasury’s monetary problems with stamped coins that lacked fine detailing and edging. The cache, valued at $400 million, constituted the world’s largest undersea recovery. in June 2011, the addition of an emerald ring increased the ship’s value by $500,000. The salvage prefaced an outcry from historians against plundering ancient shipwrecks and inaugurated a new academic discipline, underwater archeology.
