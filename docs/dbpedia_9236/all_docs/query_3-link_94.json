I really like the portrait on this one and it is in very nice condition. It will make a great addition to my historical figures collection.\n\nPlease post your coins of Cnut or the hammered coins. I know they are out there let us see them.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\n\n\"King Cnut the Great[2] (Old Norse: Knútr inn ríki;[3] c. 995[4] – 12 November 1035), also known as Canute, was King of Denmark, England, and Norway, together often referred to as the Anglo-Scandinavian or North Sea Empire. After his death, the deaths of his heirs within a decade, and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, his legacy was mostly forgotten. The medieval historian Norman Cantor said he was \"the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history\", though he was Danish and not a Briton or Anglo-Saxon.[5]\n\nCnut is popularly invoked in the context of the legend of King Canute and the waves, which usually represents him as a deluded monarch believing he has supernatural powers, contrary to the original legend which portrays a wise king.\n\nCnut's father was Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark (which gave Cnut the patronym Sweynsson, Old Norse Sveinsson). The identity of his mother is uncertain, although medieval tradition makes her a daughter of Mieszko I.[1] As a Danish prince, Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe. His accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together. Cnut maintained his power by uniting Danes and English under cultural bonds of wealth and custom, as well as by sheer brutality. After a decade of conflict with opponents in Scandinavia, Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in Trondheim in 1028. The Swedish city Sigtuna was held by Cnut.[6] He had coins struck there that called him king, but there is no narrative record of his occupation.\n\nThe kingship of England lent the Danes an important link to the maritime zone between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, where Cnut, like his father before him, had a strong interest and wielded much influence among the Norse–Gaels.[7] Cnut's possession of England's dioceses and the continental Diocese of Denmark—with a claim laid upon it by the Holy Roman Empire's Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen—was a source of great leverage within the Catholic Church, gaining notable concessions from Pope Benedict VIII and his successor John XIX, such as one on the price of the pallium of his bishops, though they still had to travel to obtain the pallium. Cnut attempted to gain concessions on the tolls his people had to pay on the way to Rome from other magnates of medieval Christendom, at the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor. After his 1026 victory against Norway and Sweden, and on his way to Rome for this coronation, Cnut, in a letter written for the benefit of his subjects, which only now exists in two twelfth-century Latin versions, deemed himself \"King of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes\".[8] The Anglo-Saxon kings used the title \"king of the English\". Cnut was ealles Engla landes cyning—\"king of all England.\"\"\n\nENGLAND. CANTERBURY, Royal mint, Cnut (1016-35), Silver Penny, 0.91g, 18mm, Short Cross type moneyer Wulfwig. North 790\n\nObv: Diademed bust left with lis sceptre, +CNVT - RECX:\n\nRev: Short voided cross, central annulet enclosing pellet, +PVLFPIGONCANT\n\nGood Very Fine, slightly creased and pecked\n\nStolen and long gone, but Cnut is a coin worth owning. I see yours has the classic pecks marks. This was mine. It has pecks in the upper left quadrant of the obverse.\n\nI don't remember where I dug up some of the history.\n\nANGLO-SAXON, Kings of All England. Cnut. 1016-1035. AR Penny (19mm, 1.15 g, 9h). Pointed Helmet type (BMC xiv, Hild. G). Winchester mint; Beorhtweald, moneyer. Struck circa 1024-1030. + CNVT: REX ΛNG, bust left, wearing pointed helmet; scepter before / + BRIHTPOLD ON PIN, voided short cross, limbs united at base by two concentric circles with pellet in center; in each angle, broken annulet enclosing pellet. SCBI 50 (Hermitage), 774 (same dies); Hild. 3719; BMC -; North 787; SCBC 1158. Good VF, bright surfaces, a few peck marks.\n\nCnut the Great (Old English: Cnūt; Old Norse: Knūtr inn rīki; Danish: Knud den Store or Knud II[1] c. 985 or 995 â€“ 12 November 1035), also known as Canute or Knut, was a Viking king of Denmark (Cnut II), England, Norway and parts of Sweden. As a statesman, with notable successes in politics and the military, and the importance of his legacy â€“ if now obscure â€“ Cnut seems to have been one of the greatest figures of medieval Europe. Until recently though, after the death of his heirs within a decade of his own and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, his achievements were largely lost to history.\n\nCnut was of Danish and Polish descent. His father was Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark (which gave Cnut the patronym, Sweynsson). Cnut's mother was the daughter of Mieszko I, the first ruler of Poland; her name is thought to have been Świętosława\n\nI am sorry to hear that your was stolen. It is a very nice example.\n\nFantastic coin! A very enviable acquisition."
