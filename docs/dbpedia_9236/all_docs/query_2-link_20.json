The letter reflects not only Kleist's state of mind at the time of his \"Kantkrise\" but also, whether or not it was an Aprilscherz, a recourse to mathematics as a means to pretend certainty and a command of factual reality. This ploy is not unusual in Kleist. The commentary on the letter involves consideration of the early nineteenth-century travel scene."
