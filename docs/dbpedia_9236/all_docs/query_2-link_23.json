(i) GENERAL SECTION. (a) INTRODUCTION. One of the characteristic features of the recent economic development of the world is the leading part taken byGerman industry and trade. Products of German labor are found nowadays on all the leading highways of world commerce. But even the younger German generation finds it difficult to realize that the present economic status of Germany is for the greater part the result of a development which has taken place during the comparatively short period of two decades. Except for temporary depressions, such as are observed in the economic life of all countries, the line of development during the period mentioned has been a vigorously ascending one. This is true particularly of the last decade, during which German economic activity has made extraordinary strides on the road of progressive development. A detailed account of the causes and results of this progress would exceed the compass of the present study. But the growth of German banking is so closely and organically interwoven with the general economic development of the nation at large that a brief sketch of this general development, made somewhat more plastic by the presentation of certain characteristic statistical data, would seem to be in place. 7 National Monetary Commission The war of 1870-71 had at last brought to Germany the political and economic union for which she had longed and labored for decades. The German name had all at once become honored and respected among the nations of the world. This change may be said to have given the first powerful impetus to German enterprise. The new movement was favored by the act of June 10, 1870, which abrogated the former obligation of obtaining a state concession for the forming of stock companies and limited liability corporations. The new law greatly facilitated the consolidation of capital. The flower which it brought forth was, however, short-lived. The period of splendor, known in the pages of German economic history as \" Granderjahre n (bubble era), ended finally in a severe crisis and a long-continued depression. The manifestations of unbridled enterprise and excesses of speculation were followed by a period of utmost depression and loss of all spirit of enterprise. The psychological factor of confidence, which must always be present in order to put economic forces into action, was missing. Such forces existed, on the one hand, in the natural resources of the country (treasures of the soil, etc.), and, on the other, in the living force of a rapidly increasing population. Particularly for the latter, however, there was little employment, and every year—as will be seen from the emigration statistics—Germany yielded of its best stock to the growing economic regions abroad, and particularly large numbers to North America. German transoceanic emigration during the years of 1872 to 1888 was as follows: 8 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking Total. 1872 125,650 103,638 1873 To the United States. 119,780 96, 641 42,492 1874 45.112 1875 30,773 1876 28,368 1877 21,964 18,240 1878 20,373 30,808 1880 24,217 33.327 106,190 1881 210,547 103,115 206,189 1882 193.869 189.373 1883 166,119 1884 143,586 1885 107,238 159.894 139,339 102,224 1886 79.875 99.712 75.591 95.976 103.951 94.364 1879 1887 27.834 22,767 The large increase of emigration in 1880, almost all of which was to North America, was probably for the greater part due to the vigorous economic growth of the United States, characteristic of those years, particularly to the energetic extension of the railroad systems which caused an increasing demand for workmen. This stimulation of the spirit of enterprise spread from America over the entire civilized world. In Germany the movement received a special impetus through the railroad nationalization started by Prussia. This raised hopes for a speedy extension of the railroad system and a prospective larger demand for the products of the mining and iron industries. Another factor working in the same direction was the revision of the customs tariff, undertaken in 1879 and based upon financial and economic considerations. The policy of free trade was abandoned and replaced by industrial and agricultural protective duties. Important 9 National Monetary Commission branches of industry expected that the change of tariff would prove an effective protection against foreign competition, which had made itself more and more felt owing to better and more extensive transportation facilities. Memories of the \"bubble era\" and of the bad consequences of the excesses of that time were sufficiently vivid, however, to restrain most people. And as at that time Germany's participation in the world trade was not very large, she was not greatly affected by the international stock exchange crisis which had its origin in the so-called \"Bontoux failure\" at the Paris Bourse. The general economic improvement which had started in 1875 continued slowly until 1888, and it was only about that time that increased activity became evident. In the field of economic legislation, besides the new customs tariff act of 1879, the act of 1884 concerning stock shares should be mentioned. The impetus for this legislative reform is to be found in the numerous abuses and fraudulent practices connected with the system of stock issues during the \"Griinder\" era. While the necessity of reforms was generally conceded, some apprehension was felt among numerous industrial classes, that the new law for the regulation of stock issues might completely stifle the spirit of enterprise in the country. This apprehension, however, proved entirely groundless. The act left sufficient scope for free and unfettered combinations of individual enterprise and capital, in the shape of stock companies. Thus it may be briefly mentioned that the number of stock companies annually formed increased from 70 with a capital of 53,000,000 marks in 1885, to 113 with a capital of 103,000,000 in 1886, 10 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking to 168 with acapital of 128,000,000 in 1887, to 184 with a capital of 194,000,000 in 1888, and to 360 with a capital of 403,000,000 marks in 1889. The year 1888 marks for Germany the beginning of a vigorous development in all fields of industrial endeavor. And it is for this reason that the present statistical study of the development of German banking commences with that year. Before entering upon the subject proper, a brief review of the general economic development of Germany, as expressed in a few striking figures, taken from official sources, may not be out of place. The population in Germany increased from about 47,000,000 in 1888 to 63,000,000 in 1907. Oversea emigration between the years 1888 to 1907 shows the following figures: Total. 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 189s 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 103,951 96,070 97,103 120,089 u6,339 87,677 40,964 37,498 33,824 24,631 22,221 24,323 22,309 22,073 32,098 36,310 27.984 28,075 3I.074 31,096 To the United States. 94.364 84,424 89,765 113,046 i n , 806 78,249 35.902 32,503 29,007 20,346 18,563 19,805 19,703 19,912 29,211 33.646 26,085 26,005 29,226 30,431 National Monetary Commission The statistics of the various trade associations (created by the Workmen's Insurance legislation) show a relatively larger increase of the number of industrial wage-earners than of the general population. The amount of horsepower represented by steam engines increased 128.3 P e r cent between 1895 and 1907. To this total must be added the amount represented by the other motive forces—gas, electricity, and water—which have been developed considerably, particularly during the last ten years. The result has been an important increase in the power of production. German foreign trade (special trade) amounted in 1889 to 7,343,500,000 marks; in 1907 to 15,597,600,000 marks. The figures prior to 1889 are not fairly comparable with those of the following years, as in 1888 Hamburg and Bremen joined the German Customs Union. The production of coal in the year 1888 was 63,390,000 tons, in 1907, 143,220,000 tons, the production of lignite in the year 1888 was 16,570,000 tons, in 1907, 62,420,000 tons. The production of pig iron amounted in 1888 to 4,180,000 tons, in 1907 to 13,050,000 tons. The consumption of coal per capita for 1888 was 1.24 tons, and for 1907, 2.21 tons; of lignite for 1888, 0.456 ton, and for 1907, 1.15 tons; of pig iron for 1888, 96.53 kilograms, and for 1907, 197 kilograms; of copper for 1889, 0.96 kilogram, and for 1907, 2.42 kilograms; of lead for 1889, 1.58 kilograms, and for 1907, 3.02 kilograms; of zinc for 1889, 1.71 kilograms, and for 1907, 2.82 kilograms; of tin for 1889, 0.18 kilogram, and for 1907, 0.25 kilogram. The German railroad system expanded from approximately 40,000 kilometers of line in 1888 to approximately 12 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking 56,200 kilometers of line in 1907. The number of tons of freight carried one kilometer on the German railroads increased in the same period from 20 to 48 billions. The tonnage of seagoing vessels arriving with cargo at German ports increased from 10,430,000 to 23,570,000 tons. The combined market value of securities, both domestic and foreign, issued on German exchanges and placed in Germany, between the years 1888 and 1907, represents a total of 37,323 million marks. It should be stated in this connection that the total value of foreign securities placed in Germany is estimated approximately, the exact figures not being available. The few figures given above illustrate the tremendous economic expansion of Germany during the twenty year period 1888-1907. They demonstrate a considerable increase and extensive circulation of capital. This movement of capital naturally passes through the banks and is brought about by them. As collectors and distributors of capital, the banks are, so to speak, the focal point of economic life. And if Hobson's saying, \"The whole industrial movement might be regarded from the financial or monetary point of view\" (Evolution of Modern Capitalism, p. 7), is correct in general, it is particularly so for Germany, as will be seen from the subsequent discussion of the German credit banks. (6) GENERAL SKETCH OF BANK AND CREDIT ORGANIZATION IN GERMANY. The present study deals with three kinds of credit institutions—the note banks (banks of issue), the credit banks, and the land credit institutions (mortgage banks and land 13 National Monetary Commission mortgage associations). This division gives at the same time a general idea of the credit system in Germany. The present organization of the note-bank system is based on the bank act of March 14, 1875, and the supplement to this act of June 7, 1899. Even previous to the founding of the German Empire the greater part of Germany had become united commercially through the formation of the Customs Union (Zollvereiri). Similar further movements toward union, however, had met with but little success in the domain of currency and with none whatever in that of banking. In the newly founded German Empire seven different monetary systems were in existence, and as all German States, with the exception of the free city of Bremen, were on a silver basis, there was above all a great want of a well regulated and adequate circulation of gold coin. The prevalence of paper circulation was felt in the most annoying manner. Thirty-two banks had the right to issue notes, and in the absence of adequate legislation, it was found on many occasions that the notes issued were not sufficiently secured. The first step which the Government took to improve these conditions was the act of December 4, 1871, concerning the coining of imperial gold pieces. The coinage act of July 9,1873, which proclaimed the gold standard for the Empire, formally completed the organization of the German currency system. It was recognized more and more that, in order to give effect to the gold standard, which for the time being existed merely on paper, and in order to regulate and supervise the entire currency circula- 14 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking tion, the establishment of a central bank was an absolute necessity. This consideration finally led to the establishment of the German Reichsbank, which came into being on January i, 1876, absorbing at the same time the Bank of Prussia (note bank). The bank act of March 14, 1875, realized the principle of the central bank as far as it could be reconciled with the rights of the existing 32 private note banks. For it must constantly be borne in mind that the German Empire is not a unitary state, but a mere federation of states, and it is because of this federal character of the Empire that every institution newly created by the Imperial Government always had and still has to take into account conditions and institutions as they exist in the different federated states. The predominance of the Reichsbank over the private note banks was secured through its considerably larger capital, further through the volume of its tax-free note contingent, which exceeded considerably the amount of all the other contingents, and which subsequently was to increase still more through the accretion of the contingents of the note banks which might renounce their rights of issue. The note circulation is subject to the limitations of the so-called indirect contingent. It must not exceed three times the cash reserve (bullion and specie, imperial treasury notes). Within this limit the issue of notes is not restricted. A note tax of 5 per cent per annum must, however, be paid to the Imperial Treasury on that part of the note circulation which exceeds the amount of cash is National Monetary Commission reserve (bullion and specie, imperial treasury notes, and notes of other banks) plus the tax-free note contingent. The tax-free note contingent of all the note banks amounted at first to 385,000,000 marks, 250,000,000 marks of which was the share of the Reichsbank. The tendency, which had existed from the beginning, to centralize the note issues more and more in the Reichsbank, was furthered in a great measure by the provision which authorized the Bank to establish branches all over the Empire. This authority was implied by the fact that it had absorbed the Bank of Prussia, with its branches. All the Reichsbank had to do was to further extend the network of branches in proportion to the increasing volume of business of the Bank and to the growing industrial development of the various parts of the country (the operations of the Bank of Prussia had naturally been restricted to Prussia). As far as its legal organization is concerned, the Reichsbank is neither a government institution proper, nor a mere private corporation. The capital, divided into shares, has been furnished by private individuals, and the shares are dealt in on the exchange; they circulate indorsed in blank; the Reichsbank acknowledges only those as share owners whose names are registered on its books. The shareholders, however, have no influence whatever on the management and administration of the Reichsbank. The Reichsbank is under the supervision and direction of the Imperial Government, which, however, is not liable for its business results. The direction is exercised by the Imperial Chancellor and under him by the 16 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking Reichsbank directorate. The governmental supervision is exercised by a bank curatorium, composed of the Imperial Chancellor and four other members, one of whom is named by the Emperor and three by the federal council. The Reichsbank directorate is the managing and executive board, representing also the Reichsbank in dealings with third parties. The president is the head of the directorate. The president, the vice-president, and the members of the directorate are appointed by the Emperor upon the recommendation of the Federal Council. The shareholders are represented by the central committee, which is, however, essentially an advisory rather than a decreeing board. At the principal branches of the Reichsbank advisory subcommittees have been formed, composed of local shareholders. The Empire participates in the profits of the Reichsbank. In order to make possible amendments which might be found advisable in the course of development, the bank act of March 14,1875, had reserved to the Empire the privilege of either liquidating the Reichsbank—the first date being January 1, 1891, and after that every ten years, with one year's notice—or of acquiring the total issue of shares of the Reichsbank at their nominal value plus their participation in half of the reserve fund. At the expiration of the first period of fifteen years the Empire deemed it sufficient to demand a larger share in the net profits of the Reichsbank. January 1, 1901, was the second term at which the privilege of the Reichsbank might have been withdrawn. Neither at that time did the Government deem it advisable to make fundamental 77267—10 2 17 National Monetary Commission changes in the charter of the Reichsbank. The combination of private capital and state management was found to work so well that the Government offered decided opposition to all efforts toward nationalizing the Reichsbank through the acquisition of the share capital by the Empire. But in view of the experiences of the past decade and the progressive economic development of the country it was deemed advisable to strengthen the given structure by increasing the operating funds of the Bank and to devise means of rendering more effective its discount policy as against that of the private banks of issue. Accordingly the principal provisions of the supplemental bank act of June 7, 1899, are as follows: The capital of the Reichsbank is increased from 120,000,000 marks to 180,000,000 marks. Of the total profits 3% per cent is first paid over to the shareholders; 20 per cent of the remainder is then transferred to the reserve fund as long as the latter has not reached the amount of 60,000,000 marks; of the remainder one-fourth goes to the shareholders and three-fourths to the Empire. In case the profits do not amount to full 3 K per cent on the capital, the deficit has to be made up out of the reserve fund. ° The tax-free note contingent of the Reichsbank, including the contingents of other note banks which had a According to the act of 1875 a dividend of 4 K per cent was paid the shareholders before any other allotment was made, then 20 per cent was to be carried to the reserve fund so long as this fund was less than onefourth of the capital; of the remainder one-half went to the shareholders and one-half to the Empire, so long as the total dividend of the shareholders did not exceed 8 per cent; of the excess the shareholders received onefourth, the Empire three-fourths. The supplemental act of December 18, 1889, left the mode of distribution essentially unaltered, but simply changed the above rate from 8 per cent to 6 per cent. 18 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking meanwhile accrued to it, is increased to 450,000,000 marks, while the total contingent of all the note banks then in existence is raised to 541,600,000 marks. Beginning with January 1, 1901, the Reichsbank must not discount below its official rate whenever this rate has reached or exceeded 4 per cent. Beginning with this date the private note banks are not permitted to discount below the official rate of the Reichsbank whenever the same has reached or exceeded 4 per cent. Moreover, their rate must not be more than one-fourth of 1 per cent below that of the Reichsbank whenever this rate is less than 4 per cent. In case the Reichsbank discounts at a rate below its official rate, at a so-called \"private rate,\" the rates of the private note banks must not be more than one-eighth of 1 per cent below that rate. In case a private note bank acts contrary to this provision, its privilege of issuing notes may be withdrawn by judgment of the court. , These are the most important provisions of the supplemental bank act of 1899. As stated above, their main purport is to increase the power of action of the Reichsbank and to strengthen its position as a central note bank, especially in the field of discount operations and discount policy. With the year 1910 another decade is about to expire and the questions of the renewal of the privilege and of an eventual amendment of the bank act are again discussed and to be decided. Owing to the extraordinary money stringency during 1907, which various circles attributed directly to defects in the German monetary 19 National Monetary Commission system and bank organization, these questions aroused great public interest. In view of this general interest the Government on its part as early as the spring of 1908 instituted an extensive bank inquiry, which covered also certain parts of the credit bank system. The commission of inquiry, composed of 23 members, heard experts from among the legislative bodies, industry commerce, agriculture, and scientific specialists, and is to digest and analyze the facts gathered during the inquiry. It has recently terminated its labors, but has not yet formulated its conclusions. It is left to the Government and the legislative bodies (Bundesrath and Reichstag) to utilize the results of this inquiry. The Government, however, emphasized from the start that it would not indorse any radical changes of the German monetary and banking system, nor of the fundamental organization of the Reichsbank, an institution which during its existence has rendered effective economic service to the country. The new bank bill, which has recently been presented to the Reichstag, is in accord with this general idea. It appears, therefore, that, just as in 1899, the task is one of perfecting the structure on its old foundation, in order to maintain the maximum standard of efficiency of the bank. For it goes without saying that in order to keep up with the growing financial and economic requirements, an institution of such preeminent economic importance as the Reichsbank must continue to be capable of development and improvement. The Reichsbank forms one of the principal supports of the German credit system and of German economic life at 20 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking large. In this capacity it has proved its value repeatedly, especially in the period of great depression at the beginning of the century. The collapse of a number of larger banks which until then had enjoyed a good reputation caused a profound shaking of confidence and threatened to precipitate a severe credit crisis. Such a crisis would have involved disastrous consequences for the entire business life of the country had not the Reichsbank at that time supported the tottering confidence by a liberal though at the same time prudent extension of credit. According to the bank act the Reichsbank's primary function is to regulate the money circulation throughout the Empire, to facilitate settlements, and to provide for the employment of available capital. In particular the bank act defines the sphere of operation of the Reichsbank as follows: i. To purchase and sell gold and silver in bullion and coins. 2. To discount, buy, and sell bills of exchange, running for not more than three months and bearing as a rule three signatures, but in no case less than two names of persons of well-known solvency. Furthermore, to discount, buy, and sell bonds of the Empire, of any German State or German municipal corporation, maturing at their face value within three months at the longest. 3. To grant interest-bearing loans for terms not longer than three months on transferable security (Lombard business), such as (a) gold and silver, coined and uncoined; (b) interestbearing bonds and other certificates of indebtedness, 21 National Monetary Commission made out to bearer by the Empire, German States, or German municipal corporations,, and maturing within a maximum term of one year; interest-bearing bonds and other certificates of indebtedness made out to bearer, on which interest is guaranteed by the Empire or by any of the Fede&ted States; fully paid-up stocks, common and preferred, and fir§t-mortgage bonds of German railway companies in actual operation; also mortgage bonds'of provincial, municipal, and other German land credit institutions subject to State control, or of German land mortgage banks, to an amount not exceeding threefourths of their market value; bonds of said institutions or banks made out to three bearers and issued by reason of loans to German municipal corporations or against acceptance of a guaranty by such corporations. (c) Interest-bearing bonds made out to bearer by nonGerman States, as well as foreign railroad prior-lien bonds guaranteed by the Government, in amounts not exceeding 50 per cent of their market value. (d) Bills of exchange bearing the signatures of parties of recognized solvency, after deducting at least 5 per cent of their market value. (e) On pledges of merchandise stored within the country, in amounts not exceeding two-thirds of its value. A. To buy and sell debentures of the kind designated in section 3 (6); the business regulations for the Reichsbank directorate to prescribe to what extent the funds of the Bank may be invested in such paper. 5. To undertake collections for the account of private individuals, employees, and official bodies, and upon prior 22 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking security to make payments and to issue drafts on or transfers to its branches or correspondents on their account. 6. To purchase for outside account securities of all kinds and bullion, after proper security has been given, and to sell the same again after delivery to the parties has been effected. 7. To receive for deposit and on transfer account {im Giro-Verkehr) moneys, which are or are not interest bearing; the total amount of interest-bearing deposits must not exceed that of the capital and surplus of the Bank. 8. To accept valuables in account and trust. With regard to the private note banks the bank act ordains that they may use their funds only for the transactions mentioned in sections 1 to 4, and as regards transactions mentioned in section 4 only to an amount not exceeding half the amount of their capital and surplus. At the end of 1907 the Reichsbank had established in the German Empire, outside of the central office in Berlin, a total of 497 branches (Reichsbank main branches, Reichsbank branches, and Reichsbank sub-branches). At the end of 1907 the books of the Reichsbank showed 18,616 shareholders. Of these 16,553 were German citizens, with 88,441 shares, and 2,063 foreigners, with 11,589 shares, in denominations of 3,000 marks each. Legislation has not occupied itself much with the organization and field of operations of the credit banks, also called security banks (Effektenbankeri), speculative banks (Spekulationsbanken), or flotation banks (Emissionsbanken). Repeated efforts to obtain legislative regulation 23 National Monetary Commission of the credit banks have caused some public discussion, but so far have met with no success. The close relation of the so-called regular banking business to that of the floating of enterprises, the trading in and the issue of shares is typical of the organization of the German credit-bank system. It is not my purpose to present an analysis of the structure and functions of the German credit banks, nor does space permit to attempt even a fairly complete sketch of the history of their development. What I propose is merely to indicate the general outlines of the credit organization and to emphasize those points of view which are necessary for the proper understanding of the statistical part. Although the above-mentioned combination of the business of floating enterprises, the issuing of and trading in securities is a common feature of this type of banks, and most pronounced in the case of the large credit banks (the so-called \"Grossbanken\"), neither their field of operations nor their business policy shows the same uniform character as is shown by the banks of issue. As a matter of fact, the various institutions show considerable variations in this regard, though it would be altogether impossible to point out these differences in detail in the present short sketch. The business of industrial financing and stock issuing had been made part of the program of the oldest Grossbanken, founded as early as the middle of the nineteenth century. The model for these institutions was the Paris Credit Mobilier, founded by Pereire Brothers, and it is 24 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking with good reason that the German institutions founded during those years are designated in banking literature as creations of the credit mobilier system. These adaptations, however, can not be regarded as mere arbitrary transfers of the French system, but originated in answer to the real demands of German economic development. The development of the railroad system beginning about the middle of last century, which caused a considerable demand for and circulation of capital, and the greater extension of state credit, induced the banks to turn to the flotation and issue business. The period following the founding of the German Empire, as mentioned before, witnessed a vigorous development of German industry, especially of the mining and (beginning with the nineties) of the electrical industries, which required a continuous inflow of new capital. At the same time German foreign commerce, particularly with oversea countries, kept on steadily increasing. Under such conditions the economic policy of the banks of placing the funds entrusted to them at the service of the new development must be regarded as perfectly proper. The banks furthered this development by forming stock companies, granting long-term credit, assuming shares and bonds, placing the new industrials on the stock market and selling them to the public. There is no doubt that but for their policy of furthering the industries, the economic development of Germany would have taken considerably longer than has been the case. It is true that the larger part of the increase in capital is the result of industrial production. But normally the 25 National Monetary Commission fresh increments of capital can be turned into industrial channels as reinvestments only through the medium of the banks. This is particularly so in case of a capitalistic organization of society, in which the joint-stock corporate form of enterprise predominates. The placing of capital in industrial investments proceeds as a rule as follows: The bank extends a certain amount of credit to the industrial corporation, which is used by the latter successively in proportion as its enterprise develops. Such \" investment\" credit, owing to its very nature and purpose, can not be refunded within a short time. It is granted from the start with a view to being converted into capital of the industrial corporation (through the increase of capital stock) or into long-term amortization credit (through bond issues). In order to repay its debt to the bank the industrial corporation issues new stock or bonds. The bank must for the time being take over the additional new securities by changing the '' book-credit'' into'' issue-credit.'' This, however, enables it to shift the risk, assumed by the granting of the original credit, to the wider spheres of the investing public, and to recover, above all, the invested capital. Only in this manner can the bank retain its power of action, and it must be admitted that as a general rule the German banks have operated in this regard with great skill and circumspection, so that they were able both to meet their own obligations and to satisfy the demands for short-term working credit. In order to obtain the means for granting industrial credit and to dispose of the enormous amounts of newly 26 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking created industrial securities, it was and is necessary to attract in as large a measure as possible the surplus funds of the community available for capital investments. For this purpose the joint-stock banks spread a network of deposit branches, destined to serve as reservoirs for the inflow of available funds, and at the same time as distributors for the industrial securities created. With the same end in view the large Berlin banks, either through the acquisition or exchange of stock (for permanent investment), entered into friendly alliances with the provincial banks. This latter development, representing a centralization of capital, though not of operation, is to be regarded as part of the general process of centralization applying to industry as a whole. It was particularly strong during the last decade, but seems to have abated somewhat during the last years. The banking industry more than any other possesses the elements of concentration, since it operates practically without technical tools, is not bound to certain localities, and does not require expensive plants. The concentration in the German banking system, the growth of the large joint-stock banks, and the extension of their sphere of interest by means of branches and deposit branches, and by their alliances with mediumsized and small banks in the provinces, was furthered by certain extraneous circumstances. One of these was the stock exchange act of June 22, 1896, which, by restricting trading in options, secured considerable advantages to the strong, large banks at the 27 National Monetary Commission expense of the weaker banks or private banking firms. It is probable' that this development received its first powerful impetus as early as 1891. At that time several private banking houses failed and these failures revealed, in a number of cases, the wrongful conversion of deposits. This caused deep commotion among wide circles. Public interest became aroused on the subject of bank deposits, and the amendment of the existing civil, criminal, and economic legislation was undertaken. The result was the bank deposit act of July 5, 1896. This did not, however, completely allay the suspicion once aroused, and the disastrous experience with small private bankers helped to no small extent to turn the confidence of the public more and more to the large joint-stock banks, which offer a much greater security for the money and securities entrusted to them. The most important factor, however, was the fact of the simultaneous ca'pitalistic evolution of industry proper, which necessitated a parallel development in the banking field. It goes without saying that this evolution, considered in its entirety, can not be ascribed to chance or the arbitrary action of individuals, but is largely the result of economic forces. Operation on a large scale is not only best fitted for the so-called \"heavy\" industries (i. e., mining and the production of partially manufactured materials from the products of mines), but becomes a prerequisite for the economical management of these industries. Careful investigation has proved that in mining, for instance, the tendency of diminishing returns is concomitant with 28 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking increased cost of operation, since the increasing depth of the shafts requires an increasingly large capital, and the spread of mining in a region raises both prices of land and wages of labor. But this tendency of diminishing returns is counteracted and even turned into the opposite direction by technical improvements made possible by the progressive concentration of capital. Technical and economic reasons were the cause which in the first instance led to the amalgamation of coal and iron works, particularly during the last years, and these same factors tend more and more to bring about the establishment of great consolidated works combining the production of the raw material with that of the halffinished and manufactured articles. This development would not be possible at all, or would meet with great difficulties, without a corresponding organization of the money and credit markets, i. e., without strong banks which are in a position to carry through the necessary financial transactions. Developments of industry and banking showed the same tendency and mutually influenced each other to a large extent. It can not be said that the banks created the industries, since the funds which are gathered by the banks in increasing volume are mainly the result of the increasing productivity of capital invested in industrial undertakings. It is true however that the creative power which in a comparatively short time placed German industry in its present commanding position took its origin with the men who put to practical use and in the interest of economic progress of the nation the achievements and inventions in the domain of science and technique. 29 National Monetary Commission It is the undisputed merit of the persons at the head of the banks that they appreciated those endeavors and supported them by advancing the requisite capital, oftentimes incurring great risks for the banks. The entire development was, moreover, vigorously furthered by a commercial and tariff policy favorable to industry, though it must be said that this policy was abandoned to a certain extent with the new customs tariff of 1902, the revision of the tariff and the renewal of our commercial treaties having been undertaken and carried out under the motto \" Greater tariff protection for agriculture.\" It is almost self-evident that the banks, which in carrying out their policy of furthering industry had often to assume considerable risks, have tried to secure, and in a large measure have succeeded in securing, a lasting and decisive control over industrial corporations. This decisive influence of the banks on the industries reaches further than the mere possession of shares of industrial undertakings would warrant, as it is an easy matter for the banks to procure for stock-holders' meetings proxies of the shares which their customers have deposited with them. The result is that in many cases, the banks appear to wield a controlling power over the industrial corporations. The close relationship between the banks and industries finds expression also in the filling of places on the supervisory boards of directors. As members of the boards of directors of industrial corporations the bank directors are at all times in a position to guard the interests of the banks, particularly by super- 30 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking vising the systematic and rational employment of the credit granted by the bank to the corporation. On the other hand, in order to create and maintain friendly relations between the banks and industrial corporations, the directors of the latter are given places on the supervisory boards of the banks. Such a condition of affairs may not reveal itself statistically to outsiders, but there can be no doubt that the bond between the bank and the industrial undertaking is thus made closer than by the mere stock control of the bank, which in most cases is not very large. The progressive industrialization of Germany and the large increase of its population caused on the one hand increasing imports of industrial and auxiliary materials as well as of foodstuffs, and on the other steadily growing exports of industrial products. As a result Germany's share in the world's commerce shows a rapid growth. Until the seventies of the last century the financial regulation of German foreign oversea trade had been almost exclusively in the hands of London banks. The establishment in 1870 of the Deutsche Bank at Berlin meant a turning point in this regard. The Bank in its charter adopted the following program: \" I t is the purpose of the corporation to do a general banking business, particularly to further and facilitate commercial relations between Germany, the other European countries, and oversea markets.\" The founders of the Deutsche Bank had recognized that there existed in the organization of the German banking and credit system a gap which had to be filled in order to render German foreign trade independent 31 National Monetary Commission of the English intermediary, and to secure for German commerce a firm position in the international market. It was rather difficult to carry out this program during the early years, the more so, because Germany at that time had no gold standard and bills of exchange made out in various kinds of currency were neither known nor liked in the international market. The introduction of the gold standard in Germany in 1873 did away with these difficulties, and by establishing branches at the central points of German oversea trade (Bremen and Hamburg) and by opening an agency in London the Deutsche Bank succeeded in vigorously furthering its program. Very much later the other Berlin joint-stock banks, especially the Disconto Gesellschaft and the Dresdner Bank, followed the example of the Deutsche Bank, and during the last years particularly the Berlin joint-stock banks have shown great energy in extending the sphere of their interests abroad. As regards the organization of the oversea business, the only foreign place where the banks have established agencies (apart from the branches in the German export cities, Bremen and Hamburg) is London. Agencies which the Deutsche Bank had established in Shanghai and Yokohama in the early seventies had soon to be liquidated by reason of considerable losses in exchange due to the depreciation of silver. For the express purpose of promoting foreign trade, the banks established subsidiary banks with the main offices in Germany (Berlin and Hamburg); these banks in their turn established agencies in oversea countries. The entire or almost the entire capital 32 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking stock of these subsidiary banks is in the possession of the parent banks. The Berlin joint-stock banks, moreover, have become permanently interested in foreign banks and banking houses; they have also founded transportation, mining, and industrial enterprises whose sphere of activity is mostly abroad, and in which they acquired a permanent interest by taking over part of the capital stock. The above account of the organization of the German credit-bank system, though somewhat sketchy in character, demonstrates, however, with sufficient clearness that the managers of the German credit banks, and particularly of the leading Berlin banks, have made constant and successful endeavors to place the banks in the service of German trade and industry and to accommodate the organization of the credit system to the variable and growing demands of national economic development. There can be no doubt that they have had a large share in raising German commerce and industry to its present world-wide commanding position. It is thought that the above brief sketch of the organization and operations of the joint stock credit banks has shown with sufficient clearness among which classes of the population and in which vocations are found the persons who apply for credit and whose demands for credit are met by the above-named institutions. Among the customers of the credit banks figure chiefly members of the commercial and industrial classes, who obtain from these banks both their long and short term credit, and in the second place holders of medium-sized and large agricultural property, who apply to them for short-term 77267—10 3 33 National Monetary Commission \"operation'' credit. The credit demands of the members of the small-farm class and of the small independent producers are generally met by the cooperative credit societies. The development of the system of cooperative societies has made great progress during the last decade. At the end of 1906 there existed in Germany 15,602 cooperative credit societies (Kreditgenossenschaften), which represented an extensive credit organization, with numerous unions and associative centers. These centers are: Die Preussische Central-Genossenschaftskasse, in Berlin; die Landwirtschaftliche Genossenschaftsbank, in Darmstadt; die Landwirtschaftliche Central-Darlehnskasse, in Neuwied; and der Allgemeine Verband der SchultzeDelitz'schen Genossenschaften, for which the Dresdner Bank, after absorption of the Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, acts as central office. In order to illustrate the volume of business and of credit operations transacted through the cooperative societies, it may be mentioned that the 5,685 cooperative societies which were allied with the Prussian Central-Genossenschaftskasse had, at the end of 1906, funds of their own to the amount of 54,000,000 marks and deposits to the amount of 758,000,000 marks which were available for credit transactions, and that 1,016 Schultze-Delitzsch societies at the close of 1906 had a membership of 598,314, a combined capital of 273,000,000 marks, and 983,000,000 marks of deposits; together 1,256,000,000 marks, of which 1,056,000,000 marks were loaned to members. It is only through the medium of the central offices mentioned that the classes of the population united in 34 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking the societies are able to come into business contact with the centers of the money and capital market. There can be no doubt that the cooperative credit societies have been of great benefit to these classes. As regards the credit on landed property there is hardly a country with an organization as perfect as Germany. The beginning of this organization dates back about one hundred and thirty years. The Prussian State had emerged from the storms of the Seven Years' war (17561763) as a recognized European power, but the sacrifices of the years of war had completely exhausted the country. The indebtedness of the landed gentry in Prussia had grown considerably, because payment of the old debts had been deferred for years past and every landed proprietor had, under the pressure of conditions, used the maximum of credit that it was possible for him to obtain. The debt burden had become even more pressing by reason of usurious exploitation of the plight of the debtors. As the landed nobility was then the principal support of the State and was so regarded by the Government, it became a matter of public interest to relieve the financial distress of the landed proprietors by enabling them to pay off systematically their mortgage debts. The efforts in this direction, in which the Prussian King, Frederick the Great, personally took an active part, led to the creation of the land-mortgage associations (Landschaften), which must be considered the first important step toward the organization of land credit. The provincial (landschaftliche) and landed proprietors' (ritterschaftliche) credit institutions, generally known by 35 National Monetary Commission the short term \"Landschaften,\" are associations endowed with the rights of a corporation and operating under state control. Their boards of directors have the attributes of official authority. They are autonomous institutions within the limits set by the state supervision. The general features of their organization are practically identical. As regards the basis of the land credit, it follows from the very cooperative conception that each member of the land-credit association is entitled to obtain credit within the limits fixed by the charter. At first these associations were composed exclusively of members of the landed nobility. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, however, when, among other numerous constitutional changes, the feudal dependence of the peasantry was abolished and they were enabled to acquire land in fee simple, the \"Landschaften\" gradually extended their operations so as to include the small peasant holdings or they organized for this purpose separate credit institutions (so-called \"Neue Landschaften\"). The Landschaften obtain the funds for the granting of credit through the issue of letters of mortgage or mortgage bonds—i. e., as a rule, the borrowers receive the loan in the shape of mortgage bonds of the association, and it is left to them to negotiate these bonds on the stock exchange. At first the letters of mortgage were made out on a certain estate (estate debentures). But as the purchaser of such letters of mortgage was forced to keep watch over the condition and management of the mortgaged estate—even though the association itself main- 36 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking tained permanent control of the debtor—the sphere of circulation and the ease with which these bonds could be sold were naturally limited. It was only when the issue of corporate mortgage bonds was started, the security of which was guaranteed either by the entire mortgage claims of the association or the collective responsibility of their members, and when these bonds were given a large market through their admission to exchange transactions, that the highest degree of mobilization was reached. The mortgage bonds are secured in the first place by the mortgage claims of the association, furthermore by the association funds proper as well as the guaranty or reserve funds, and the amortization funds or the equivalent book credits in favor of the debtors. In the case of the older associations the joint guarantee of the members is added, whose estates are jointly liable for claims against the association. In eastern and western Prussia, Silesia, and Pomerania all estates on which association mortgages may be obtained are jointly liable, no matter whether they are mortgaged or not. In Silesia the joint liability extends, moreover, to the state domains, and in eastern Prussia to the state domains and forests. Wherever the joint liability is not found, a substitute has been created through the forming of special guaranty funds. At any rate the land association mortgage bonds are considered first-class investment securities, which finds expression in the fact that they may be used for the investment of trust funds. The land-mortgage associations deserve this public confidence. During a period of more than one hundred 37 National Monetary Commission and thirty years the cooperative land-credit system has rendered effective service under very difficult conditions, proving of great benefit to the agricultural classes. The progress of industrialism in Germany during the last three decades of the last century caused a steadily growing influx of population into the industrial centers. Only the cities profited by the steady increase in population. The growing demand for dwellings was accompanied by a rapid rise in value of city grounds; hence the necessary construction of dwellings required larger amounts of capital than were at the disposal of the individual builders. It was mainly to meet the needs of credit on urban real estate that mortgage banks (Hypothekenbanken) were created, and thus a special organization of city real estate credit was formed. The greater number of the mortgage banks now in existence was founded during the decade 1862 to 1872; practically all the others were founded during the building boom of 1894-1896. Most of the mortgage banks cater exclusively to the demand for real estate credit; some others combine this specialty with other lines of banking. While the land-mortgage associations are based on the principle of cooperation and do not pursue a profit-making policy, the mortgage banks have been founded as jointstock companies. The capital stock serves as working capital as well as guaranty fund. Bonds are issued against acquired mortgages and secured by the latter. Almost all these banks issue their bonds to bearer, a privilege granted them by the State; 38 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking only two small institutions, which have not been granted this privilege, issue bonds in the name of individuals which are transferable by blank indorsement. The bonds of the mortgage banks are known legally as \" mortgage bonds\" {Hypothekenpfandbrieje), in contradistinction to the bonds issued by the land-mortgage associations. Inasmuch as the bonds are held in many cases by small investors, the State, in order to protect the interests of these bondholders, from the very beginning secured to itself the right of control, limiting at the same time the field of operation of these banks by certain legal enactments and regulations. No fault can be found with this policy, as a matter of principle. In the first decades, however, the development of the mortgage banks (particularly in Prussia) was greatly hampered by legal restrictions and was forced in a certain direction with disastrous consequences which were to be felt for a long time to come. In order to illustrate these legal provisions, it may be mentioned that until 1894 the Prussian mortgage banks, in appraising a piece of ground upon which a loan was to be granted, were bound to take as a basis the valuation for the land tax. This valuation in turn was based on the rentals during a period dating back ten to fifteen years, being consequently much too low. On the other hand, in the case erf new buildings, the valuation could be influenced by the credit-seeking landlord through exaggerated statements regarding the rentals. In the old quarters of a town, where values were stable, the Prussian banks subject to restrictive state regulation 39 National Monetary Commission could not, therefore, compete with other mortgage banks not subject to such regulations, whereas their loans in the outlying districts, where most of the new buildings were going up, were of necessity too high. In spite of every effort the mortgage banks subject to the Prussian restrictive provisions were unable to develop in the measure they might have without the fetters of official loan limitations or as was expected by the shareholders, bondholders, and the credit-seeking property owners. The defects of this system caused the failure of a number of these institutions even as late at 1901. Toward the end of 1893 the old restrictive provisions were at last abolished and replaced by new ones. The general effect of these new provisions was a much stricter regulation of the operations of the mortgage banks and a greater limitation of their field of activity. In spite of all this, the new provisions were much to be preferred to the former, for they comply with the practical results of mortgage-bank operations. The greatest improvement, however, over the older state of affairs was that the regulations provide a rational basis for the main function of the mortgage banks, i. e., that of ascertaining the value of and securing loans on real estate, instead of compelling them as formerly to use in a purely mechanical manner the oftentimes untrustworthy valuations of the tax authorities. As the increasing economic importance of the mortgage banks came to be recognized and appreciated, it was found that most of the German Federal States had not issued general enactments for the business operations of banks of that type and that the only regulations were 40 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking those contained in the charters of the individual banks. The imperial mortgage bank act of July 13, 1899, created accordingly a uniform legal basis for the business of the mortgage banks. Only the supervision of the mortgage banks was left to the various Federal States. In Prussia the highest supervisory office is the Ministry of Agriculture, Domains, and Forestry, and the actual supervision is exercised by bank inspectors, who continuously control the business affairs of the Prussian mortgage banks and report to the Minister of Agriculture. In the other German Federal States government control is exercised by a government commissioner appointed for each bank. These government commissioners, however, exercise their control as a secondary office only, whereas the bank inspectors' chief function is that of bank control. The imperial mortgage-bank act of July 13, 1899, debars the ordinary commercial partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, incorporated cooperative societies, and individuals from doing a mortgage-bank business, or from issuing mortgage bonds. Stock companies and limited joint-stock companies \"en commandite\" may engage in this business only with the sanction of the federal council. In case the charter of a mortgage bank provides that mortgage loans shall be granted only within the confines of the Federal State where the bank is located, the granting of the charter is left to the authorities of the respective Federal State. Besides the granting of mortgage loans and the issue of mortgage bonds the business of the mortgage banks is limited to the following transactions: 1. The acquisition, transfer, and grant of mortgage loans. 41 National Monetary Commission 2. The granting of loans without hypothecary security to public corporations within the country, or to third persons in cases where the loan is fully guaranteed by such corporation; also the issue of bonds based on such claims. 3. The granting of loans to domestic railroad enterprises of local interest (Kleinbahnunternehmungen) against hypothecation of the railroad, and the issue of bonds based on the claims thus acquired. 4. The purchase and sale on commission of securities, with the exception of \"futures\" (Zeitgeschdfte). 5. The acceptance for deposit of money or other objects, with the provision, however, that the total amount of the funds deposited must not exceed one-half of the paid-in capital. 6. The collection of bills, drafts, and similar paper. Those mortgage banks which, before the promulgation of the bank act, had been engaged in other lines of banking were permitted to retain this privilege. The mortgage banks may issue mortgage bonds up to fifteen times the combined amount of the paid-in capital and surplus. The latter is to serve exclusively to secure losses shown in the balance sheet or the claims of bondholders. Inasmuch as the issue of these bonds by the various banks prior to the bank act had been based upon various other principles, the actual ratio between capital stock and mortgage-bond circulation differs for each bank. The total amount of the circulating mortgage bonds must always be secured up to its nominal value through mortgages of at least equal amount and bearing at least an equal rate of interest. Loans may be made only on prop- 42 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking erties within the country and, as a rule, only in the shape of first mortgages. Loans must not exceed three-fifths of the value of the property. For loaning purposes the carefully ascertained market value of the property is taken. In ascertaining this value only the lasting qualities of the property are to be considered and the continuous revenue which the property is likely to yield to any owner under management of ordinary care. As regards mortgages on building sites and unfinished buildings which yield no revenue, it is provided that their combined amount must not exceed one-tenth of the total amount of mortgages on which bonds have been issued nor one-half of the paid-in capital. Moreover, mortgages on properties which do not yield a permanent revenue, particularly on pits and quarries, are excluded from being used as security for mortgage bonds. The mortgages destined as security for the mortgage bonds must be separately recorded by the bank in a register. Every mortgage bank has a trustee. The trustee (as a rule a higher government official) must see to it that the prescribed security for mortgage debentures is always on hand; but in so doing it is not his province to inquire whether the accepted value conforms to the actual value of the property, provided only that the value of the property offered for mortgage has been determined in the manner sanctioned by the supervising authorities. Every mortgage bond when issued must bear his certificate that it is properly secured and that the prescribed entry on the register has been made of the underlying mortgage or 43 National Monetary Commission mortgages. He has also the custody of the documents pertaining to the registered mortgages. In certain cases he may accept and register as additional security valuable paper other than mortgages. In case of failure of a mortgage bank, the bondholders have a prior lien upon the mortgages and other valuable paper recorded in the register. The mortgage-bank act of the year 1899 regulated the mortgage-bank system in a way that may well be considered exemplary. While leaving sufficient freedom to the mortgage banks in the discharge of their important economic task of meeting the demand for real-estate credit, it also affords adequate protection to the holders of the mortgage bonds. The result has been that confidence in the security of the mortgage bonds has become more general and deep-rooted, so that mortgage bonds are generally considered first-class investment securities, as may be seen from their exchange quotations. The failure in 1901 of a few mortgage banks was in the last instance due to defects which could be traced back to the old Prussian restrictive provisions. The confidence of the public in mortgage bonds has not been shaken thereby. The organization of real-estate credit in Germany, on the whole, may be considered completed. It litis proved its value and has made possible the achievement of important economic tasks. Next to the above-mentioned real-estate credit institutions (mortgage banks and land-mortgage associations) the savings banks and the insurance companies play an important role in the field of real-estate credit; moreover, the loans on mortgages granted by pri- 44 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking vate capitalists are by no means inconsiderable. The latter alone are estimated at 20 to 25 billion marks. The amounts in question are mostly entered as second liens after the mortgages in favor of land-mortgage associations, mortgage banks, savings banks, and insurance companies, since almost all of the institutions named make it a condition to have a prior lien and do not, as a rule, grant loans in excess of 60 per cent of the property value. Among the assets of the insurance companies mortgages represent by far the larger share. About 80 per cent of the premium reserves of these companies are invested in mortgages. (2) STATISTICAL SECTION. (o) GENERAL REMARKS REGARDING THE BASIS AND THE SCOPE OF THE STATISTICAL DATA. The statistical tables a illustrating the development of the German banks during the last twenty years are based on the annual reports, as well as on the balance sheets and the profit-and-loss accounts of the institutions in question. With the exception of the land-mortgage associations, whose legal constitution has been explained above, the banks considered are with a few exceptions stock corporations. According to the provision of the Commercial Code the board of directors of a stock company must, within three months, submit to the supervisory council a balance a The detailed tables referred to in the text are included in the volume of \"Statistics for Great Britain, Germany, and France\" published by the Commission. See especially \"Statistics for Germany,\" Part II, Tables 13-22. 45 National Monetary Commission sheet for the year past, also a statement of profits and losses, and a report showing the conditions of the funds and the general state of affairs of the institution. These documents accompanied by the written remarks of the council are then submitted at the stockholders' meeting within the same period. The charter of the company may state another term, but in no case must this term exceed six months. In the preparation of the balance sheet, the following general provisions have to be observed: Securities and merchandise having an exchange or market price must not be listed above their exchange or market price prevailing at the time the balance sheet is made up; in case this price exceeds the cost they must not be listed above this cost. Other assets may be valued at prices not higher than the cost of purchase or manufacture. Plants and other objects not destined for sale, but which are to be employed permanently for the operation of the businesss of the company, may be listed at cost of purchase or production regardless of diminution in value, provided an equivalent amount is deducted for depreciation or charged to the renewal fund. A reserve fund must be created in order to cover any possible losses shown in the balance sheet. This reserve fund is made up of the following items: i. An annual amount equal at least to one-twentieth of the annual net profits as long as the reserve fund does not exceed the tenth part of the capital or whatever higher proportion has been provided in the charter of the company. 46 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking 2. The premiums realized on the occasion of the foundation of the company or of the increase of its capital through the issue of stock at a price or prices in excess of the combined nominal value of said stock and the expense involved in such issue. 3. The amount of additional payments contributed by shareholders without increasing the capital—for the granting of preference rights to their shares, unless these payments are to be used for extraordinary sinking funds or to cover unusual losses. After approval by the stockholders' meeting the balance sheet, as well as the statement of the profit-and-loss account, must be published by the board in the periodicals mentioned in the charter of the company. This duty of publishing their reports devolves both on joint-stock companies as well as on limited liability companies doing a banking business. The limited liability companies, however, as well as the small joint-stock banks, fulfil these duties very often in a very unsatisfactory manner, the more so because the fines for the violation of the above rule are but slight. They do not publish annual reports proper, and very often even omit the required publication in the prescribed newspapers of the balance sheets and the profit-and-loss statements. Although considerable effort has been made to make the present study as complete as possible and every care has been taken to procure the required material, it is yet possible that, particularly for the more remote years, some smaller institutions may have been omitted. These 47 National Monetary Commission omissions hardly affect, however, the general outline, as the institutions in question are but small and unimportant. The corporate banks with a capital of 1,000,000 marks and over have all been treated in the statistics for the last twenty years, and beginning with 1895 all, even the smallest, joint-stock banks are included. The statistics for the issue banks, as well as for the mortgage banks, are also complete for the full period. 0 The tables present a statistical view of the development during the last twenty years of German banking in the form of joint-stock companies and limited liability companies. The compilation covers a wider scope than has ever before been attempted in Germany, although it does not include data regarding the business of private banking firms. The number of these firms for the country as a whole is still considerable (about 6,000), notwithstanding their continuous absorption by the joint-stock banks. There are only a few whose importance approximates that of a fair-sized joint-stock bank, and perhaps only two old Berlin banking houses (Mendelsohn & Co. and S. Bleichroeder & Co.) that have been able to retain a large clientele and which may be placed alongside the large joint-stock banks, particularly in the field of large financial and issue operations. The public is absolutely uninformed as to the amount of capital invested in these banking houses, as no reports have ever a At this point I desire to acknowledge the valuable assistance rendered by the economic department of the Deutsche Bank, particularly by its head, Doctor Fuchs, through the loan of voluminous older data, which it would have been very difficult and in some cases impossible to procure elsewhere. The detailed tabfes are to be found in the \"Statistics for Germany.\" See especially P a r t I I , Tables 13-22. 48 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking been published by them. This general reference to the existence of private banking houses and to their decreasing importance as compared with that of the joint-stock banks must therefore suffice; a statistical presentation is not possible. Finally, it must be mentioned that there are in existence a few communal and government banking institutions which have not been included in these statistics. The municipal and provincial banking institutions serve primarily the credit needs of their respective public corporations by underwriting and issuing their loans; they also devote themselves (as the Landesbank of the Rhine Province and the I^andesbank of the Province of Westphalia) to land-credit operations in the interest of the agricultural population of their territories. More important is the so-called Royal Maritime Trading Company (Konigliche Seehandlung), a state institution with a capital of 100,000,000 marks. About 4,500,000 marks of its capital is invested in industrial establishments, flour mills, linen weaving, and a loan office. Its principal activity, however, is in the field of underwriting, notably of state, imperial, and communal loans. Its special task is to regulate the exchange quotations of the Prussian state loans and of the imperial loans. The oftentimes considerable amounts entrusted to it by the Prussian and imperial financial administrations as well as by other public bodies are as a rule used by the Bank for private discount business or for term-loan operations (Reportgeschdft). 77267—10 4 49 National Monetary Commission (b) THE NOTE-ISSUING BANKS. As may be seen from the tables the number of the German note-issuing banks decreased from seventeen to five in the period from 1888 to 1905, since which date the number remained unchanged. The centralization of the note-issue system may be considered at present almost completed. This is in accord with the tendency which has been consistently pursued since the establishment of the Reichsbank. Immediately after the promulgation of the bank act twelve private note banks relinquished the right to issue notes. The tax-free note contingent of these banks amounted to a total of 21,589,000 marks. Pursuant to the provisions of the bank act the taxfree note contingent of the Reichsbank was on January 1, 1876, increased by this amount from 250,000,000 to 271,589,000 marks. Through the surrender of the issue privilege of thirteen more private note banks the contingent of the Reichsbank increased to 293,400,000 marks by January 1, 1894. The supplementary bank act of July 7, 1899, increased the contingent of the Reichsbank to 450,000,000 marks, and following the surrender of the note issue privilege by three additional private note banks the tax-free contingent of the Reichsbank increased to 472,829,000 marks by the end of 1905. Besides the Reichsbank, there are at present the Bank of Baden, the Note Bank of Bavaria, the Bank of Saxony, and the Note Bank of Wtirttemberg, whose combined taxfree note contingents amount to a total of 68,771,000 marks. Only the Bank of Saxony and the Note Bank 50 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking of Bavaria are of any importance, as they were able to maintain an extensive sphere of activity in the varied and intensive economic life of their regions. It is not likely that these institutions will renounce the right of note issue within the near future, or that at the pending revision of the bank act the note privilege will be withdrawn from the private note banks still in existence. The issuing of notes is the most important debit business of the note banks. As has been stated above, the issue of notes is subject to the limitations of the so-called \"indirect contingent,\" i. e., the note circulation which exceeds the tax-free note contingent is taxed at the rate of 5 per cent per annum. At least one-third of the amount of notes issued must be secured by current German metallic money, imperial treasury notes, and gold in bars or foreign coins. The purpose of these provisions is to compel the banks to maintain a sound ratio between cash reserves and note circulation, to prevent an excessive increase of unsecured notes and to insure the redemption of the notes. This same purpose is pursued by the provision that the part of the note circulation which exceeds the cash reserve must be secured by discounted bills maturing in not more than three months and for which as a rule three, but not less than two parties of known solvency stand sponsors. As may be seen from the tables below, the note circulation of all note banks, particularly of the Reichsbank, has steadily increased, while the cash reserves, and, as a result, the proportion of the cash reserves to note circu- 51 National Mon etary Commission lation, have been subject to large fluctuations. This proportion for the last twenty years was as follows: PROPORTION O F CASH R E S E R V E S TO N O T E CIRCULATION, I888-1907. Other note banks. Reichsbank.

For the latest years this ratio has been even lower for the Reichsbank than for the other banks of issue. This phenomenon is due to the fact that it is only the Reichsbank which maintains an intimate connection with the entire economic development of the nation by meeting both the currency demands for domestic use as well as the requirements for the settlement of international obligations. 52 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking The metallic reserves, which represent the greater part of the cash reserves, were composed as follows: COMPOSITION O P METALLIC R E S E R V E S OP REICHSBANK, I£ -1907.

Until 1905 the metallic reserve (gold excluded) consisted largely of silver thalers which were legal tender to the same extent as gold. But beginning with September 30, 1908, these coins have been withdrawn from circulation. Of late 3-mark silver pieces have been 53 National Monetary Commission coined, which are, however, mere subsidiary coins, like the other silver coins, and as such may be tendered in payment only to the amount of 20 marks. When the Reichsbank was established, not quite half of the German money circulation consisted of gold, the standard metal. Accordingly, the Bank had to assist in the general reform of the German currency. Its principal aim had to be to attract from abroad and to put into circulation the largest practicable quantities of gold. It has always been the Reichsbank's policy to satiate the channels of circulation with gold as much as possible, with the result that the per capita gold circulation in Germany is much larger than in any other country. It should be mentioned, however, in this connection that according to the findings of the bank commission a large quantity of German gold coins is melted every year for use in the arts. Only in recent years, owing in some degree to the money stringency, the contrary tendency has been noted. By issuing bank notes of small denominations (50 and 20 marks) the Reichsbank is endeavoring to draw gold from domestic circulation into its treasury in order to increase its efficiency, since, as mentioned repeatedly, it may issue notes to an amount triple the amount of its gold reserve. Gold imports from abroad are regulated by the balance of international payments and the prevailing exchange rate as its expression. The most important and, in the last instance, only efficient means which the Reichsbank has of encouraging gold imports and discouraging gold exports is its discount policy. Furthermore, it facili- 54 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking tates gold imports by interest-free advances to gold importers. The notes which are not secured by cash form the elastic portion of the currency circulation, and the changes and fluctuations of that part of the note circulation which is not secured by cash reflect best the fluctuating demands of currency made upon the note banks. The following table shows the change in the note circulation of the Reichsbank which is not secured by cash: UNCOVERED N O T E CIRCULATION OF R E I C H S B A N K , 1888-1907.

It may be seen from the above table that the unsecured note circulation of the Reichsbank has increased almost 55 National Monetary Commission year by year. This increase has been continuous for the last ten years and it may be said that the credit demands made upon the Bank had to be met to an increasing extent by issues of unsecured notes and the fuller utilization of its cash reserves; the maximum in this regard was reached in 1907, when as the result of the general stringency in the international money market the circulation issued by Reichsbank very nearly touched the one-third cash limit fixed by law. The above remarks on the note circulation and the legal cash reserve do not give a correct picture of the actual position of the note banks. The \" daily maturing liabilities\" made up of non-interest-bearing commercial deposits on transfer {giro) account considerably change the picture. These constitute the bulk of deposits with the note banks. The relative importance of the interestbearing deposits, which may be withdrawn only on preliminary notice, is of some account only in the case of a few private note banks. The ratio between cash on the one hand and notes and deposits on the other developed as follows: P E R C E N T AGE OF CASH TO N O T E S AND DEPOSITS, 1888-1907.

For the more recent years particularly this ratio has been lower for the Reichsbank than for the private note banks. There is, of cour'se, the theoretical possibility of a simultaneous withdrawal of all giro deposits, but in practice such a case may be considered out of question even in case of war. In the latter case the need of the Reichsbank ,to business men would be larger than ever and the latter are not likely to withdraw their deposits beyond the stipulated minima, as this would be tantamount to the closing of the transfer accounts. The combined amount of these minimum deposits is unknown-, at all events, it is much lower than the total daily demand liabilities. The latter contain also the credit balances of the financial administrations of the Empire and the Federal States, which at times represent very large amounts, and are estimated to constitute approximately 30 per cent of all the deposits. 57 National Monetary Commission Statistical investigation demonstrates a considerable increase in the volume of transfer transactions within the more recent years, accompanied by a larger use of the deposits on the part of the giro depositors. It appears particularly that the average of balances on giro account has increased far less than the average volume of transfers from and to these accounts. The Reichsbank, therefore, during the fall of 1906 felt compelled to adopt new requirements for its minimum deposits. It was proven that while the average amount of giro deposit had increased 34 per cent within the decade 1898-1907, the volume of transfers on account of these deposits had grown 88 per cent during the same period. It is true that the Bank pays no interest on these deposits, regarding the free use of the deposits as the equivalent for the expense caused by the transfer operations on account of these deposits. But with the growth in volume of these operations the expenses of the Bank also increase, and the requirement of the Bank of an adequate minimum limit of deposits seems therefore fully justified. Another, though less important, reason which made the change desirable was that by increasing these minimum requirements the operating basis of the Bank was strengthened, in the sense that an increase of giro deposits was tantamount to a strengthening of its cash reserves, which in turn enabled it to increase its note circulation by the threefold amount of such increase. It is but proper to mention in this connection that the giro accounts need not be fully made in the form of specie. As a matter of fact, these accounts quite often are the result of credit operations, in case, for instance, the values of discounted bills or of loans upon collateral are not 58 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking paid in cash, but merely credited to the respective accounts. The total volume of bank transfers (giro transactions) effected by the Reichsbank shows the following development: TRANSFER TRANSACTIONS OP REICHSBANK, I888-1907.

The largest participant in the giro transactions of the Reichsbank is the banking world. On March 31, 1908, the distribution of the giro accounts of private concerns was as follows: Industry and trade, 27 per cent; commerce, transportation, and insurance, 13.8 per cent; money and credit (banks, private bankers, etc.) 52.6 per cent (the per cent share of banking corporations alone was 36.1 per cent); corporate bodies, foundations, private individuals, etc., 6 per cent; agriculture and allied industries, 0.8 per cent. The total amount of deposits held by the private note banks has changed but little during the twenty-year period. At the close of 1907 this total amounted to but 55,500,000 marks. Of this amount 32,310,000 marks were held by the Saechsische Bank, half of which were interescbearing deposits subject to notice of withdrawal. As compared with deposit accounts the credit accounts of the note banks are of secondary importance. The only note banks which do an extensive current-account business with creditors are the note bank of Bavaria, and particularly the Bank of Saxony. 61 National Monetary Commission As regards the credit transactions of the note banks, the investments in bills of exchange and in loans on collateral show the following development: DISCOUNTS AND LOANS OP N O T E - I S S U B B A N K S , I888-1907.

The amount of circulating notes must be fully secured by a reserve of gold, specie, and bills maturing within a maximum term of three months. At the close of 1907 the holdings of cash and bills of exchange in all banks amounted to 2,507,180,000. marks, while the note circulation amounted to only 2,052,500,000 marks. Thus, 454,680,000 marks of notes might have 62 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking been issued in addition. Even then the cash security of the note circulation would have been a little more than 34 per cent. The chief credit business of the Reichsbank is that of discounting bills; and in times of increased business activity, when larger amounts of currency are wanted, the Reichsbank normally handles a larger percentage of the total bill transactions than in times of economic depression, when business is transacted more largely on a cash basis. Thus the bills purchased (local bills, drafts on outside places) amounted in 1902 to 7,437,540,000 marks, in 1905 to 8,946,710,000 marks, in 1906 to 10,213,760,000 marks, and in 1907 to 11,882,300,000 marks. Of the total amount of bills held by all the note banks at the close of 1907 only 147,960,000 marks fell to the share of the private note banks, and of this amount 48,610,000 marks in turn was the share of the Note Bank of Bavaria and 63,130,000 marks that of the Bank of Saxony. The Reichsbank's average holdings of domestic bills show the following distribution as regards the vocation of the clients in favor of whom the bills were discounted: CLASSIFICATION OF REICHSBANK CUSTOMERS.

This, however, does not imply that the bills presented to the Reichsbank for discounting by money and banking circles had their origin in all cases in the field of finance and banking. The general rule of the Reichsbank is to discount only such bills of exchange as are in fact genuine mercantile bills of exchange and to exclude from its portfolio the so-called credit and financial bills—that is, bills which are not based on bona fide business transactions. There is a very good reason for this. The bill based upon a real money claim is in a measure a security in itself. It is secured ultimately by business capital already in existence, and through being discounted it discharges the economic function of liquidating the portion of the producer's capital contained in the sold goods. By means of bills the capital fixed in economic goods is released and becomes available for fresh use, beginning with the time when these goods are transferred from the producer to the consumer or the manufacturer. The difference between a \"mercantile\" and a \"financial\" bill of exchange is, however, not sufficiently patent to preclude any mistake in individual cases. It was only about a year ago that the Reichsbank began to make special efforts to eliminate from its holdings all bills which could not be properly classed under the first head. For the rest, the large share of discounted bills credited 64 Miscellaneous Articles on German Banking to \"finance and banking\" is accounted for by the fact that the great majority of bills are discounted by the Reichsbank after having been handled first by the credit banks. The proportion of foreign bills of exchange to the total bill holdings of the Reichsbank is shown in the following table: PROPORTION OP F O R E I G N B I L L S H E L D BY REICHSBANK, I 888-1907.
