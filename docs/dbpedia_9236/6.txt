The Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, also known as Archbishopric of Bremen was a Prince-Bishopric (Theocratic Principality) in the northern most region of Lower Saxony.

The city of Bremen became independent from the Prince-Bishopric in 1186 (de facto), and 1646 (de jure). Since independence, Bremen became a Free City in the Holy Roman Empire.
