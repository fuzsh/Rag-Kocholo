Although only one woman – Yvonne-América Truque – was among the five writers attending the conference and only two women writers – Shirley Campbell and Aida Cartagena Portalatín – were the subjects of papers, I realised that we were witnessing, in the early 1990s, the emergence of a tradition of Black women writing in the Spanish Americas. That same feeling – that we were on the cusp of a significant cultural phenomenon – prevailed at Howard University in the early 1970s, when students and professors were reading and writing about Nicolás Guillén, Manuel Zapata Olivella, Nelson Estupiñán Bass, and other male hispanophone writers of African descent. That cultural movement led to the publication, in 1977, of Blacks in Hispanic Literature, a collaborative work intended to chart the early history and evolution of Afro-Hispanic literature. The 1970s also marked the advent of another cultural movement: a literary tradition forged by African American women writers and scholars. The publication of The Bluest Eye, Revolutionary Petunias, and The Black Woman in 1970 was later reinforced by the publication of two studies – Sturdy Black Bridges: Visions of Black Women in Literature, one of the first anthologies to include African and Caribbean women, and All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave, an early product of Black feminist scholarship – which solidified the field of Black Women’s Studies as a discipline with both a creative and scholarly foundation. Literary critics cannot underestimate the importance of North American writers such as Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Audre Lorde in inspiring other women of colour throughout the world to add their voices to the literary discourse of their countries. As the editors of Breaking Boundaries: Latina Writings and Critical Readings point out, Black women writers ‘provided a female context. To this day, Latina writers may express a debt to Black women writers’. I also owe a debt to Black women writers and scholars who have had a significant impact on my own personal and intellectual development, particularly during the 1980s when I was teaching xi\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n11\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nand writing at a small, historically Black college in the South. In 1983, a grant from the United Negro College Fund enabled me to spend a year at libraries throughout the country doing research on early African American women writers. That experience gave me an insight into the writers’ lives and literature: their self-representation and social construction; their language and style, omissions and silences. That experience was also invaluable to me in the 1990s, when I began teaching and writing about Black hispanophone women writers in the Americas. The past decade has marked the emergence of women writers as a new and powerful voice in Afro-Hispanic literature, so much so that it is possible to speak of the mujerización (womanisation) of that literature. The gender shift is evident in two phenomena: the proliferation of publications by women and an increase in scholarship on women writers. In the past ten years, for example, Luz Argentina Chiriboga has published eight books: Nancy Morejón, four poemarios; Soleida Ríos, three collections of verse and an edited volume; Marta Rojas, an edited text and two novels, with a third in press; Excilia Saldaña, two works of poetry; and Mayra SantosFebres, a novel, short story collection and three volumes of poetry. The decade also witnessed the production of important scholarship on these writers, as literary critics produced translations, wrote essays, published books and organised conferences. Since 1990, four major works have been translated into English – Argentina Chiriboga’s Drums Under My Skin, Aida Cartagena Portalatín’s Yania Tierra and Mayra Santos-Febres’ Urban Oracles – while a collection of Excilia Saldaña’s poetry, in translation, was recently published and a bilingual edition of Nancy Morejón’s complete works is in production. The essays and bibliography in this volume indicate the scope and depth of recent scholarship on Afra-Hispanic writing. Literary critics such as Caroll Mills Young, Gabriel Abudu, Elba Birmingham-Pokorny, Claudette M. Williams, Aida Heredia, and Flora M. González have made women’s writing the primary focus of their research, while Ian I. Smart, Dellita Martin-Ogunsola, M’Baré N’Gom, and Donald K. Gordon have examined the texts of women writers within other critical or geographic contexts. The first conference dedicated to the work of a single Afra-Hispanic writer, Nancy Morejón, was held at the University of Missouri, Columbia in 1995, and the papers from that conference appeared in a special issue of the Afro-Hispanic Review. In 1999, the Howard University Press published Singular Like a Bird: The Art of Nancy Morejón, the first book devoted to the writing of a single author. Daughters of the Diaspora will continue the archaeological project of excavating, preserving and disseminating the writing of African-descended xii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n12\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nP R E F A C E\n\nwomen by examining their work within a critical context. The collection contains the creative writing (poetry, fiction, essays and personal narratives) of 20 Spanish-speaking women, as well as interviews and interpretive essays by fifteen scholars from Africa, Canada, the Caribbean, and the United States. Its objectives are to give voice to writers from the Spanish Americas, to provide English translations of representative texts, to give information on the lives and works of writers, to trace the historical evolution of a literary tradition and to offer critical contexts for understanding and interpreting the literature. This volume will contribute to the literary history of women throughout the Americas by recovering the texts of forgotten or neglected writers such as Virginia Brindis de Salas and Carmen Colón Pellot, by focusing attention on emerging writers like Cristina Cabral and Mayra Santos-Febres, and by placing established writers such as Julia de Burgos and Aida Cartagena Portalatín within a wider discursive tradition. Reflecting upon issues of ethnicity, sexuality, social class, and self-representation, these writers shape a revolutionary discourse that questions and subverts historical assumptions and literary conventions. Unfortunately, many accomplished writers such as Cuban Cristina Ayala, Latina Sandra María Esteves, and Puerto Rican Angela María Dávila had to be excluded because of time and space restraints, but information on these writers appears in the introduction. It is hoped that this survey of Afra-Hispanic literature will stimulate more extensive and sustained research on these writers and others who have been omitted – except for the token one – from anthologies, biographies and critical studies of Afro-Hispanic literature (where ‘all the Blacks Are Men’) and of Latin American women’s literature (where ‘all the Women Are White’). Daughters of the Diaspora is intended for anglophone readers who enjoy the literature of other countries, for students who want to expand their cultural horizons, for teachers intent on enriching the experiences of their students and for scholars who are open to new and challenging research opportunities.\n\n* The term ‘Afra-Hispanic’, an adjective that characterises hispanophone women of African descent, is adapted from the term coined by Joanne M. Braxton and Andrée Nicola McLaughlin in their anthology Wild Women in the Whirlwind: Afra-American Culture and the Contemporary Literary Renaissance. This form is particularly appropriate in a gendered language such as Spanish, in which the vowel endings of nouns and adjectives often denote gender. xiii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n13\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nMany thanks to the writers, literary critics, and translators – friends and colleagues all – whose patience and encouragement sustained me through the long period of this anthology’s gestation. Donald Gordon was the first to answer the call, and with such grace and generosity of spirit. Cuban poet Nancy Morejón has lent her support throughout, introducing me to Excilia Saldaña and Marta Rojas, providing information on Cristina Ayala, and sending a book of Rafaela Chacón Nardi’s poetry. I could not have completed this collection without Marta Rojas’ detailed letters and frequent e-mails or without the blessings of Soleida Ríos who communicates with Ochún and Yemayá. Aché! My circle of friends fully embraced this project: Janet Hampton read manuscripts and solved computer glitches, Marvin Lewis answered every urgent cry for help, Dellita Martin-Ogunsola was a sister scholar in every way, Edward Mullen sent copies of Juana Pastor’s poetry, James Davis shared his research on Afra-Dominican writers, and Caroll Young provided information on Afra-Uruguayan writers and introduced me to Cristina Cabral and Beatriz Santos. I am so grateful to Cathy Jenkins for her computer expertise and to J. Rolando García for handling communication with María Nsue Angüe. Other generous amigos y compañeros – Elba Birmingham-Pokorny, Gabriel Abudu and, especially, Antonio Olliz Boyd – never refused a request to translate into English just one more poem or essay. Elba introduced me to the work of Mayra Santos-Febres, while Gabriel put me in touch with Soleida Ríos and sent copies of Cristina Ayala’s poetry from Havana’s Biblioteca Nacional. William Luis and Rosemary Geisdorfer Feal, who have supported my work in many ways, read submissions, wrote evaluations, and even edited a manuscript or two. I am also indebted to Mariela Gutiérrez for her early contribution, to Khara Cannon for translating an essay on Angela María Dávila, to María Zielina Limonta for her article on María Nsue Angüe, and to Dolores ‘Lola’ Aponte-Ramos whose research on Puerto Rican writers was invaluable. Other scholars helped along the way: Herbert Rogers of Baltimore’s Pratt Library kept me abreast of new web sites and recent publications; Clementina Adams gave me a copy of Common Threads, her study of Black women writers; Franklin Gutiérrez xiv\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n14\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nA C K N O W L E D E G M E N T S\n\nsent me Evas terrenales, his bibliography of Dominican women writers; and Patricia Bell-Scott kept me focused on my research and centered in my writing. My thanks also to Ballard Gilmore who braved the chill of a Washington spring, to photograph a very reluctant subject. I am grateful to the president and dean of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who approved a fall 1999 sabbatical leave that enabled me to complete some of the initial groundwork for this anthology. I am especially indebted to my friend and colleague Acklyn Lynch, former Chair of the Department of Africana Studies, who has always supported my scholarship and who suggested that I contact Ian Randle about publishing this collection. I am most appreciative of the efficiency, professionalism and seriousness of purpose with which he and his staff, particularly Lisa Morgan and Dahlia Fraser, have treated this project. When I received a note card from classmate Patricia Theiss, I realised that Bermuda artist Shan Kelly-Cecilio’s depiction of African-descended women as proud and confident agents of their own destiny captures the vision that inspired Daughters of the Diaspora. Finally, I am so blessed to have a family – mother, son, three daughters, and seven grandchildren – who forgive my failings and understand my commitment to research on the rich heritage and inspiring history of our people.\n\nxv\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n15\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nIntroduction ‘This Voyage Toward Words’: Mapping the Routes of the Writers Miriam DeCosta-Willis\n\nWords are the medium through which I understand the worlds I inhabit, visit or dream about. Therefore, when I write I take notes, draw maps of departures and destinations, find my routes into the page. Mayra Santos-Febres\n\nWomen Writers and Literary Production In her short story ‘La escritora’ (‘The Woman Writer’), Puerto Rican poet and novelist Mayra Santos-Febres examines the possibilities – the routes – open to the female artist who must navigate the tenuous straits between survival, on the one hand, and creativity, on the other. In her reflections on the creative process, Santos-Febres constructs a metafiction, a story within a story, that examines and interrogates itself through the words and actions of three characters, all women writers: the writers/characters in the two stories and the writer/narrator (Santos-Febres’ alter ego) who comments on the text. Through this fictional guise, Santos-Febres examines the social, economic, and physical conditions under which women produce literature. The protagonist of the internal story (whose narrative is in italics) is a pregnant college student who quits her lover, plans an abortion, and puts her writing on hold. The other writer (whose text is in roman letters) is a divorced graduate student and office worker who has to ‘cook, iron, mop, and take care of the kids’ while trying to complete her short story. She lists the reasons for her writer’s block – children, work, bills, and divorce – but then concludes that she is responsible for her failure. Through such fictional characters, Santos-Febres illustrates the material obstacles to writing such as overwork, family responsibilities sexual needs, personal relationships, and isolation (‘long nights in a monastic habit’). However, in her narrative asides (enclosed in parentheses), she explores the psychological and xvi\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n16\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\ntechnical demands of the ‘voyage toward words’: self-revelation, anxiety of influence, limited narrative control, and duplicity (assuming characters’ voices, using literary tricks of the trade, and playing games with allusions and metaphors). The narrator, in her view, is a conjuror or trickster, a liar who creates a ‘portrait of a life so different from my own. I, who have never been divorced, who doesn’t know what it’s like to be pregnant’ (Urban Oracles). The challenges facing the woman artist, which Santos-Febres examines in ‘La escritora’ are all too evident in the ‘life portrait’ of another Puerto Rican writer whose personal experiences are paradigmatic of the struggle between creativity and survival. The figure of Julia de Burgos haunts the pages of contemporary writers such as Angela María Dávila, Sandra María Esteves, and Sherezada ‘Chiqui’ Vicioso, who pay homage, in their essays and poems, to their literary foremother. ‘She [Julia] fashioned herself into an untamed bird,’ writes Dominican poet Vicioso, ‘oblivious to any type of restriction in its search for life and love’ (Julia). But for these writers, the life of Burgos – that daughter of a ‘sensitive mulata woman’, that jíbara who studied French and Greek and Latin and Portuguese, that uppity coloured woman who defied conventional views on race and class in lines such as ‘Ay, ay, ay, I am black, pure black, / kinky hair and Kaffir lips / and flat Mozambican nose’ is something of a cautionary tale: How to survive in a world that refuses to recognise its brilliant, gifted daughters. Burgos’ writing could not sustain her or save her mother’s life. In 1938, the twenty-four-year-old writer travelled throughout Puerto Rico in carros públicos, trying to sell a collection of self-published poems to pay for the medical treatment of her mother, who was dying of cancer. But the books did not sell and her mother died anyway. Today acknowledged as one of Puerto Rico’s greatest poets, Burgos could barely make a living teaching in rural schools, distributing free breakfasts to children, and working in New York garment factories and newspaper offices before dying – at age thirtynine – of pain and poverty and pneumonia on a street in Harlem. Burgos made the mistake of trying to live from her writing. Contemporary women are not so naive; they know that coloured folk will not get paid to sit and write. University-educated by and large, the twenty writers in this volume are also teachers, editors, professors, journalists, administrators, social workers, radio/television commentators, performers, media specialists and independent consultants. Some have even worked in blue-collar jobs – two as domestics and two others as factory workers. Only a few are ‘married with children’, while the others – divorced, widowed, or single by choice – lead active, non-traditional lives, totally committed to xvii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n17\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\ntheir work, honing their craft and plying their trade in the literary marketplace. This is not to say that they are not ‘human’ or ‘womanly’. They are incredibly adventurous women, always on the move – from Costa Rica to Zimbabwe and Bogotá to Barcelona – reciting poetry to music, attending conferences and organising for peace and justice. Even so, life for them ‘ain’t been no crystal stair’. Several have migrated or been exiled; one was born in prison and another was taken from her mother at birth; one has survived cancer and radiation; some have lost children or lovers; and others, like Julia and Lourdes and Excilia, died young of asthma, pneumonia, and liver failure. But . . . they wrote, always. Four months before her death, Burgos penned a wistful letter to her sister Consuelo from the hospital on Welfare Island where she had been committed: ‘I want to look at my river again’, she wrote wistfully, ‘with the same peaceful, longing eyes that I did when I was its sweetheart’. These details of their lives suggest that the Afra-Hispanic writer needs more than a ‘room of her own’ (with lock and key) and money to support herself; to write, she also needs support from the literary establishment, including editors, publishers, distributors, and reviewers. Literary production is difficult in countries where there is a small publishing industry or where the works of women and Blacks are not priorities in the literary marketplace. Laurence Prescott notes: Generally published at the author’s expense in limited print runs and by modest presses, [the works of Afro-Colombian women] do not receive commercial publicity nor newspaper reviews by the literary establishment which could evaluate, edit and stimulate the writers. (191) Many early writers such as Juana Pastor and Cristina Ayala of Cuba and Virginia Brindis de Salas of Uruguay, like their nineteenth-century African American counterparts, published their poems in the periodical press. Important in this regard is the emergence of Black periodicals such as Rumbos, Nuestra Raza, Revista Uruguaya, La Conservación, and Mundo Afro in Uruguay; Letras Nacionales in Colombia; and Africa 2000 and El Patio in Equatorial Guinea. These journals were founded and edited by Black male writers such as Pilar Barrios, Manuel Zapata Olivella, and Donato Ndongo-Bidyyogo who encouraged women to submit their work for publication. In the past twenty years, African American journals such as the Afro-Hispanic Review, Black Scholar, Callaloo, and PALARA (Publication of the Afro-Latin American Research Association) have published literature by and about Afra-Hispanic writers such as Nancy Morejón, Julia de Burgos, xviii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n18\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nArgentina Chiriboga, Excilia Saldaña, and others. A few Black women writers have also been involved in the publishing business. Aida Cartagena Portalatín founded the Dominican journal La Poesía Sorprendida and the publishing house La Isla Necesaria, while Yvonne-América Truque co-founded, with her French-Canadian former husband, CEDAH (Centre d’Études et de Diffusion des Amériques Hispanophones). Given the effort, time, and expense of operating such institutions, however, most of these journals and presses were short-lived. Afro-Hispanic writers, in general, and Black women writers, in particular, have faced daunting problems in the publication and dissemination of their works. Julia de Burgos self-published her Poema en veinte surcos, but her Poemas exactas a mí misma, for which she was unable to find a publisher, has been lost. Brindis de Salas’ Pregón de Marimorena and Cien cárceles de amor have been out of print for many years, and the manuscript of her Cantos de lejanía has disappeared. Although more publishing opportunities exist in cities such as Havana, Santo Domingo, San Juan, Quito, and Bogotá, economic conditions and political considerations often determine which texts are published or reprinted. In the past decade, works by or about Afra-Hispanic writers, some in English translation, have been published in the United States by small (often minority-run) presses such as the AfroHispanic Institute, Azul, Arte Público, Black Scholar, Howard University, and Lumen. For some writers, however, publication in that country is problematic for personal and political reasons. Sherezada Vicioso explains: ‘I never thought of publishing in the United States because as a Latina, I felt unable to deal with the publishing establishment in that country’. Cuba, where literary production has been a priority of the revolutionary government, provides an illuminating example of the ways in which economic and political vicissitudes have affected writing and publishing. In spite of institutional support for its publishing industry and the strength of such publishers as Ediciones Unión and Editorial Letras Cubanas, the early works of Nancy Morejón, Soleida Ríos, Georgina Herrera, and Excilia Saldaña are out of print. A major obstacle to publication in Cuba has been the shortage of paper in the past decade. Marta Rojas recently wrote that, although her third novel El haren de Oviedo has been accepted for publication, its production this year or next depends upon the availability of paper. During the ‘special period’ following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuban publishers produced a limited number of plaquettes or handmade chapbooks, such as Morejón’s Balada de un sueño and El río de Martín Pérez y otros poemas, which are noted for their originality and artistic beauty. Another problem in Cuba and other small countries is the xix\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n19\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\ndistribution of books and access to the media. For example, only one of Soleida Ríos’s eight books has been reviewed in a literary or cultural journal in spite of the fact that she was singled out as a ‘new voice’ in poetry of the post-Revolution.\n\nGenres and Themes Although they also write prose, thirteen of the twenty writers included in this volume are poets, partly for cultural reasons, because in Latin America poetry is a popular art form, rooted in a rich, oral, Afro-Indo-Hispanic tradition. Nuyorican poet Sandra María Esteves underscores the appeal that this urban ‘poetry for the people’ has had in her Latino community, particularly during the 1960s. We mingled and read poems to each other, in our houses, on university tours, at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and the New Rican Village, at a political rally in Chicago, in the Central Park Delacourt Theater, at the gates of the White House, in schools, community centers, and other multi-purpose locations, indoors, outdoor, on buses and trains… (‘Letter’ 119) Poetry can be performance art at its best: Eulalia Bernard in African robes giving a spirited interpretation of ‘My Black King’; singer Marta Valdés and Nancy Morejón performing the poet’s ‘Polished Stone’ in Mexico; and Yvonne-América Truque accompanied on the drums by Diego Marulanda at Toronto’s Mixed Art Festival. Poetry can touch the mind and the spirit. In Cartagena Portalatín’s ‘A Woman is Alone’, it raises philosophical questions about the human condition, and in Edelma Zapata Pérez’s ‘Ancestral Fears’, it invokes the power and presence of the gods. Because poetry has such different functions, contemporary women writers use varied forms: free verse with its multiple rhythms and tempos but also traditional, primarily Hispanic, verse forms, such as baladas, romances, sonetos, sones, tangos, cantos, elegías, and elogios. Except for Dominican Cartagena’s poetic Escalera para Electra (1980) and Ecuato-Guinean María Nsue Angüe’s Ekomo (1985), most first novels by Afra-Hispanic writers have been published in the past decade. These include Bajo la piel de los tambores (1991) by Argentina Chiriboga, El columpio de Rey Spencer (1993) by Marta Rojas, and Sirena Selena vestida de pena (2000) by Mayra Santos-Febres. The most innovative of these in its form, language, and characterisations is Sirena, a remarkable tour de force by one of Puerto Rico’s most gifted prose stylists. The narrative, about a young singer and an aging transvestite, captures the textures and xx\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n20\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nrhythms of dimly-lit gay bars, where men and women deal with their ambiguous sexuality in a vibrant and tactile language that bips and bops across the page. Santos-Febres’ short story collection, Pez de vidrio (Urban Oracles in the English translation) is also a ground-breaking work, similar in its inventiveness to Cartagena’s Tablero, a volume of stories published in the Dominican Republic in 1978. Mayra Santos-Febres and especially Excilia Saldaña of Cuba draw on Afro-Latin American oral prose forms such as proverbs, tales, myths, antiphonal patterns, and patakínes (Yoruba legends) to create folk tales that express the beliefs and customs of their communities. But the essay is the prose genre to which many of the Daughters are attracted; two of the most important collections of essays are Chiqui Vicioso’s Algo que decir (1991), which contains critical studies of women’s literature, and Nancy Morejón’s Fundación de la imagen (1988), essays on literary and cultural criticism. The most significant nonfiction writer, however, is Marta Rojas, a prolific Cuban journalist whose articles, essays, and novels are exceptional for their language, fictive devices, and stylistic innovations. It is curious that first-person narratives (diaries, memoirs, testimonials, and autobiographies), which are so important in Afra-American literature, are seldom the genre of choice of Black Hispanic women. In fact, Sherezada Vicioso’s ‘An Oral History’, Sandra María Esteves’ ‘Open Letter to Eliana’, and Edelma Zapata Pérez’s ‘Coming to Consciousness’ were requested by editors, while the narratives of Shirley Campbell, Soleida Ríos, and Marta Rojas were written for this anthology. Other genres that have received little attention by writers and even less attention by literary critics are radio/ television scripts, including those written by Georgina Herrera of Cuba and Uruguayan Beatriz Santos – both of whom work in that media – and dramatic works such as Vicioso’s Wish-ky Sour and Morejón’s short, poetic Pierrot y la luna. Although Chiriboga, Herrera, and Saldaña have written awardwinning books for children, Saldaña points out in ‘Reflections on My Poetic Work’ that the writers of children’s literature have to deal with publishing delays, lack of promotion, and the absence of critical studies. Her essay reveals that many creative writers are also exceptional literary critics who demonstrate in their self-reflective essays a broad knowledge of literature, an awareness of intertexuality in their writing, and a clear sense of the thematic, stylistic, and ideological direction of their work. Examples of critical reflections include ‘Las poéticas de Nancy Morejón’, as well as two interviews in this volume: Georgina Herrera’s ‘The Lion’s Version of the Jungle’, and Mayra Santos-Febres’ ‘The Page on Which Life Writes Itself’. Evident in both the critical and creative work of Afra-Hispanic writers is their commitment to social and political change in their countries. xxi\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n21\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nSometimes overtly but more often subtly, their poetry and fiction focus on issues about which they are deeply concerned: Sherezada Vicioso on discrimination against Dominican immigrants, Lourdes Casal on tensions between Cubans and Cuban-Americans, Eulalia Bernard on racial prejudice in Costa Rica, Argentina Chiriboga on the erasure of Black women from Ecuadorian history, and Cristina Cabral on sexism in Uruguay. One of the most powerful political pieces – similar to David Walker’s Appeal in its passion and stylistic innovations – is Aida Cartagena Portalatín’s Yania Tierra, a long, epic poem that lays bare the bloody pages of Dominican history. Her cryptic rewriting of history is heightened by fictive devices – intercalation of songs and poems, contrapuntal alternation of lyrical and dramatic passages – that make Yania a beautiful work of art rather than a didactic treatise. Committed writers such as Cartagena would probably agree with Santos-Febres, who explains: My work reflects all of that [abhorrence of racism, violence, and homophobia]. But a literary text will always be more than politics. It has to be. Because literature is about imagination and freedom of expression; it can serve political purposes, but it is fueled by struggles of the soul. In spite of this caveat, her political views are evident in the dedication of a short story to ‘all the Puerto Rican political prisoners jailed in federal prisons by the US government since 1960’. One of the most important social and political questions that Caribbean and Latin American writers of African descent raise is that of race: What does it mean to be a negra or mestiza or mulata in a country that defends and validates European colonisation and acculturation? Race is a major component of identity for many writers, particularly those from Cuba, Costa Rica, Uruguay, and other countries where pride in the African cultural heritage is valued in the casa and the barrio. Cuban writers Cristina Ayala, Marta Rojas, Georgina Herrera, Excilia Saldaña, and Nancy Morejón underscore the significance of African culture in the formation of national identity. Supported by the proAfrica discourse of the Revolution, the Afro-Cuban cultural tradition is evident in every facet of Cuban life, particularly in its art, music, and literature. Georgina Herrera wrote ‘First Time in Front of a Mirror’ after seeing her face reflected in an African mask, and the female persona of her ‘Sedi Ibu’, a poem full of African allusions, proudly maintains, ‘I never forget / who I am, from whence I came, to whom I’m indebted’. In ‘The Lion’s Version of the Jungle’ Herrera says, ‘I always liked being Black, having this tranquility. I was proud of our large mouths and our wide noses’. Uruguayan Virginia Brindis de Salas xxii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n22\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nexpressed the same pride and self confidence in the 1940s – before the Black-is-beautiful vogue – when she wrote: ‘I’m a Black woman, / because I have black skin’. In her poems, interviews, and narratives, Costa Rican Shirley Campbell expresses the significance of race in her self-image. She writes: I accept myself unequivocally free unequivocally black unequivocally beautiful Race, however, is not unproblematic. Some writers question the blackwhite dichotomisation of race in the United States. They deal, instead, with the nuances and subtleties of mestizaje (racial and cultural mixing) or hybridisation in the Spanish Americas, where the mixing of Natives, Africans, and Europeans has produced a lexicon of ethnicities: pardos, mestizos, zambos, mulatos, morenos, et cetera. In spite of real differences in racial definitions in the Americas, what is undeniable is the denial of race by some individuals and countries that have internalised the racist ideology of the dominant culture. Mental colonisation is the subject of Frantz Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks, a seminal study of the psychological effects of European colonisation. In her essay ‘Oh Lord, I Want to be White’ and her book-length study Charcoal and Cinnamon, literary critic Claudette Williams examines Carmen Colón Pellot’s rejection of blackness and internalisation of racist values. In her collection of poetry, Ambar mulato (1938), the Puerto Rican poet depicts a mulatto woman ‘in the throes of a crisis of racial identity’ (100). Williams demonstrates that mulatto identity depends upon a denial of blackness and that mulattoes are often complicit in their racial erasure. The denial of race and creation of ‘raceless’ poetry were more prevalent among early writers, who held precarious positions in plantation society. The legacy of that reductive mentality is evident in countries where the myth of European origin still prevails, where people of colour are called indios (Indians) or trigüeños (light-skinned people), and where dark-skinned people are considered Haitians in disguise. In ‘The Journey Inward’, for example, scholar Aida Heredia explains: ‘The Dominican Republic suffers from a politics of social and cultural identity informed by a concept of a nationalism that is rooted in the supposed ideal of a Spanish origin’. Dominican poet and essayist Sherezada Vicioso elaborates: In Santo Domingo, the popular classes have a pretty clear grasp of racial divisions, but the middle and upper-middle classes are very xxiii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n23\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\ndeluded on this point. People straighten their hair and marry ‘in order to improve the race’, etc., etc., and don’t realise the racist connotations of their language or their attitude. In the United States, there is no space for fine distinctions of race, and one goes from being ‘trigüeño’ or ‘indio’ to being ‘mulatto’ or ‘Black’ or ‘Hispanic’. (‘An Oral History’) (Yet, when one examines the photographs in Franklin Gutiérrez’s Bibliography of 150 Dominican Women Writers, it is evident from their skin colour, hair texture, or facial features that many writers are of African descent.) Coming to terms with one’s racial identity and accepting one’s difference can be a difficult process, according to Colombian poet Edelma Zapata Pérez. In ‘The Consciousness-Raising of an Afro-Indo-Mulatto Woman Writer’, she writes: ‘My life in the capital marked the discovery of my blackness – a slow, painful, and anguished road toward my origins’. It is ironic that the experience of living in the United States, where the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements radicalised so many Blacks, forced some Afra-Hispanic writers to confront, for the first time, their own identity as women of African descent. Sherezada Vicioso explains in ‘An Oral History’ how her experience of racism in the United States forced her to confront and to adopt the ‘Black identity as a gesture of solidarity’. Before her ‘enlightenment’, Cuban-American poet and college professor Lourdes Casal called herself a mulata. ‘[A] Cuban of mixed ancestry (white, black and Chinese)’, she reflects, ‘I considered myself to be like Cuba – a mulatress in an essentially mulatto country’. But her participation in the US freedom struggle made Casal aware of her blackness, of the significance of her colour and hair texture. In the view of many Black women writers such as Shirley Campbell, identity is anchored in gender as well as race. In a recent poem, ‘Persona’, Nancy Morejón writes : ‘Who is that woman / who is present in all of us fleeing from us, / fleeing from her enigma and her distant origin?’ That woman wants to distance herself from other women, from her problematic and enigmatic self, and from her (African? slave? illegitimate?) roots. She chooses the easy way out – flight – because the search for the female self is too hard, too painful, and too complicated. That woman represents all of us who are caught in the struggle between flight and the difficult journey within to self-knowledge. In their poems and short stories, their essays and novels, the Daughters explore gender – sexual identity and its associated social and cultural characteristics – as it has been constructed by the society in which they live. Although their writing sometimes xxiv\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n24\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nrepresented women in traditional roles as wives and mothers, early writers often wrote ‘genderless’ poetry on neutral subjects such as nature and God in an effort to erase their female identity and gain acceptance by the male literary establishment. But not Burgos, who rejected the feminine (passive, submissive, frivolous) self in her powerful ‘To Julia de Burgos’. You are only the ponderous lady very lady; not me; I am life, strength, woman. You belong to your husband, your master; not me; I belong to nobody, or all, because to all, to all I give myself in my clean feeling and in my thought. That poem is probably the first feminist manifesto written in Spanish by a woman of African descent. Many of these writers, however, do not call themselves feminists, because they do not want their work pigeonholed by labels (‘feminist’, ‘black’, or ‘communist’) and because they consider feminism a EuroAmerican ideology that is exogenous to their culture. Nancy Morejón voices this attitude in an often-quoted interview. She says, ‘I think that the task of a womanist (let’s talk with Alice Walker’s term which I love very much) in our region should be something related to our society and to our history’ (‘Womanist’ 266). In spite of such disclaimers, there is a decided feminist consciousness in the works of many contemporary Afra-Hispanic writers, who create strong and independent female characters; rewrite national history through their portraits of revolutionary women; describe grandmothers, othermothers, and literary foremothers who have shaped their work; support a female culture of artists and workers; examine women’s inner worlds (their psychology and spirituality); underscore in their lives and works the importance of female deities such as Yemayá, Ochún, and Oya; write an ‘autobiography of the body’ that explores sexual desire and the female body; question femininity and women’s traditional roles in patriarchal societies; examine the effect that silence, isolation, and invisibility have on female agency and creativity; and expose both private and public acts of violence and discrimination against women. In the novel Jonatás y Manuela, for example, Ecuadoran Argentina Chiriboga creates a fictional character with historical roots, who is the prototype of the New Black Woman: she is creative, political, courageous, aware, intelligent, militant, and self-directed. A homely, cross-dressing woman, she is also the antithesis of the beautiful, half-white, hip-shaking rumba dancer who peopled the pages of negrista poets for decades. We see xxv\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n25\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nreflections of the Jonatás prototype in other Black female protagonists: Rojas’ Lucila Mendes, Morejón’s Mujer Negra, Cabral’s Warrior Woman, Cartagena’s Yania, and Truque’s Mujer Batalla. Such characters originate in a revisionist ideology in which women are the subjects – rather than objects – of national history. The fictional personae are often based on figures who have been erased from Latin American history, such as Jonatás, an enslaved Ecuadoran who liberated slaves and fought for independence from Spain, as well as María de la Luz Sánchez and María Rita Armand, nineteenthcentury leaders of Cuba’s antislavery movement. Many fictional characters, such as Lunda Uyanga in Bajo la piel de los tambores and Ba-Lunda in Jonatás y Manuela, are also based on ancestral figures, particularly grandmothers, life-giving and -affirming culture bearers who pass on creative gifts – African songs, tales, myths, beliefs, and deities – to a long line of coloured daughters and granddaughters. Cuban novelist Marta Rojas, for example, is indebted to her grandmother, Cecilia Martínez, whose stories about slavery have enriched her novels. In countless poems, Excilia Saldaña pays tribute to her grandmother, Excilia Saldaña Bregante, who nurtured her body and creative spirit. She writes: ‘I discovered in my blood / with suddenness a grandmother / a female / and an extended line / of mothers singing’. It is likely that neither their grandmothers nor their mothers would have approved of the openness with which contemporary writers deal with sexual desire and the female body. As usual, Julia de Burgos was the first to break the silence, writing lyrical, sensual and passionate poetry to her lover, the Man River of Loiza. ‘Coil yourself’, she urges, ‘upon my lips and let me drink you, / to feel you mine for a brief moment’. The erotic poetry of contemporary Afra-Hispanics is more explicit, and they describe female pleasure in various forms. Uruguayan Beatriz Santos writes: ‘Your semen’s burning lava / begets butterflies / in my dark womb’. Cuban novelist Marta Rojas uses irony and erotically-charged language to evoke the protagonist’s womanliness and to satirise the slaveowner’s lechery in Santa lujuria o papeles de blanco (Holy Lust or White Papers). The most daring and radical writer, in terms of her fictive depiction of eroticism and sexuality, is thirty-something Mayra Santos-Febres, whose novel and short stories deal, on occasion, with fellatio, masturbation, pedophilia, transvestism, voyeurism, necrophilia, and homoeroticism (in fact, she is the only AfraHispanic writer to portray gays and lesbians in her work) – not to titillate but to explore, artistically and empathetically, the depth and diversity of human beings. Her fictional characters, even the adolescents, prisoners, and sex workers who are preyed upon by dirty old men, prison guards, xxvi\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n26\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nand johns, maintain control over their bodies, which become sites of power and resistance. Santos-Febres describes, for example, Dulce M, who was imprisoned for her support of Puerto Rican independence. ‘She put her finger in where occasionally the guards searched her, and she said, “This is mine and it doesn’t matter if in a few minutes they come to take it away from me, for now it’s still mine, mine.”’ She then takes possession of her own body in a deliberate act of defiance.\n\nEvolution Of A Literary Tradition The Spanish Caribbean: ‘Five Centuries of Rains and Moons’ The earliest Afra-Hispanic writers emerged in the Spanish Caribbean, where their poetry and prose describe their lived experiences, their literary models, the periods in which they lived, and particularly, the social and historical contexts of their work. The Spanish conquest and colonisation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Santo Domingo led to the slaughter of natives, importation of enslaved Africans, and creation of a plantation society. It is estimated that between 1502 and 1870, approximately two million Africans were brought to the Spanish colonies (Palmer 66), and, although they contributed substantially to the culture and economy of the region in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, they were far from willing participants in the colonisation of the New World. The Africans’ resistance to slavery through rebellions and insurrections, through flight and marronage, was intensified after the Haitian Revolution of 1790–1804, when slave rebellions – in which Black women often played prominent roles – erupted throughout the Caribbean. The nineteenth century was marked by the struggle for emancipation, which lasted from 1824 to 1886, and by wars of independence in which the colonies struggled for freedom from European domination. The postcolonial period has also been marked by turbulence: civil wars, revolutions, dictatorships, economic recessions, and military occupation by the United States. It is against this historical background of displacements and disjunctures that the literature of African-descended women in the Spanish Caribbean must be examined. Their literature is fragmentary and discontinuous; it is characterised by silences and lagunas – what Cocco de Filippis calls ‘Feminine Parentheses’ (26) – in its evolution. Three early poets – Juana Pastor, Salomé Ureña de Henríquez, and Cristina Ayala – are paradigmatic in the archaeological reconstruction of this literary tradition because they reveal, in different ways, how women artists and intellectuals xxvii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n27\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\ndealt with their creative gifts. The life of the first known Afra-Hispanic writer is shrouded in mystery, but we hear her voice, however faint, echoed in rare books and the pages of a few scholarly papers. Juana Pastor, described as a free parda or brown-skinned woman, was born in the 1700s in Havana’s Jesús María barrio. Like her contemporary, African American poet Phillis Wheatley, she may have been taught to read and write, study geometry and grammar, compose poetry, and recite Latin (in all of which she excelled) by a former slaveowner; or she may have attended one of the small schools for free coloured and white children that sprang up in colonial Havana; or she might have been an autodidact, like the nineteenth-century Afro-Cuban poet Plácido. At any rate, she stood out in that community of wealthy Creoles, European immigrants, and upwardly-mobile mulattoes. She became ‘a teacher of the most distinguished ladies of her time’ (López Prieto liv), and she wrote flawless prose and poems full of Christian piety and patriotic zeal. But we can only wonder what her life must have been like in that colony of planter elites, where Cubans of African descent, including slaves and free Blacks, made up 44 per cent of the population by 1775 (García Agüero 358). Later called the ‘Black Avellaneda’ (an allusion to the nineteenthcentury Cuban novelist Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda), Pastor inhabited the tenuous terrain of the mulatto in a race-conscious society that was becoming increasingly Black in spite of attempts to hide its nappy roots. Did she recite her poetry at tertulias or literary salons? Was her work published in broadsides and newspapers? Was she proud of her dark skin? Did she embrace her identity as a woman of African descent? Like other colonial writers, Juana Pastor took themes from classical or biblical texts, composing formal, derivative verses – the same ‘stiff, struggling ambivalent lines’ that, according to Alice Walker, characterised Wheatley’s poetry (200). Although she did not publish a book and most of her poetry is not extant, a few of her décimas (poems of ten-line stanzas) have survived in the introduction to an 1881 anthology. According to Antonio López Prieto, Pastor improvised the following poem on November 27, 1815: I pity the godless, Lament the inept, Flatter the favorite, And laugh at the haughty. Wise, I also spurn The coarse knave Who dares violate my honor, xxviii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n28\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nBut I always know, by Faith, that I am his rib, And that I must love him. (liv-lv) Pastor imitated European models because her readers undoubtedly came from the small circle of Cuba’s intellectual elite, which included few women and even fewer Blacks. She would have disdained the rich folk tradition of the barrio and the slave plantation, where, according to Esteban Montejo, Afro-Cubans danced the zapateo and tumbandera, ate masango and ochinchín, worshipped the orishas, played guïros and timbales, and sang ‘Toma y toma y toma caringa / pa’ lo viejo palo y cachimba’ (Barnet 71). Like Juana Pastor, the Dominican poet Salomé Ureña de Henríquez (1850–1897), ‘whose features clearly showed her grandmother’s African descent’ (Grossman 12), ignored her country’s vernacular tradition (as did most nineteenth-century writers) in favour of neoclassical verses about nature, nationalism, and nurturing. Although the two poets used similar themes and styles, Ureña, who has been called the ‘founding poet’ of the Dominican Republic, achieved the fame that eluded Pastor. Ureña may have been the better poet (too little of Pastor’s work remains to judge), but she also enjoyed privileges – a superior education, professional opportunities, and publication of a book – as the daughter and wife of educated, upper-class men. She was taught by her mother and grew up surrounded by books in a house frequented by literary figures. (Apparently, her racial origin was not problematic in a country that denies its African roots. Although it is estimated that one-quarter of the population is Black and two-thirds is mulatto, Dominicans with money and/or education are classified as ‘White’.) In 1880, Ureña published Poesías, a collection of thirty-three poems that includes ‘Anacaona’, which is based on legends about the Taino queen who was killed by the Spanish conquistadors. It is significant that this educator and poet sought the ethnic origins of her country in its indigenous population, whose culture was virtually eradicated, while she ignored the Afro-Dominican culture that was quite visible. Ureña, described as a militant advocate of national independence and women’s rights, also founded the Instituto de Señoritas, the first secondary school for women in the Dominican Republic. Although she is hailed ‘for her dedication to the struggle for a better society in which women would be a vital and integral part’ (Cocco de Filippis 19), the ‘better society’ that she envisioned did not include Afro-Dominicans. xxix\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n29\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nThe first Afra-Hispanic writer to break the silence about race was Cristina Ayala, who was born in 1856, six years after the birth of Salomé Ureña de Henríquez, in the small town of Güines, Cuba. Perhaps because of her humble origins (for her mother was a slave), or because she lived in the country, where campesinas tended to be more race-conscious, or because she matured during the struggle for emancipation and independence, Ayala wrote openly about race in carefully crafted, didactic poems full of pain and moral indignation. She wrote ‘A mi raza’ (To My Race), for example, in response to a pamphlet entitled ‘Cuba y su gente’ (Cuba and Its People) in which Blacks, especially women, were denigrated. Written in 1888, two years after the abolition of slavery in Cuba, her poem is both a defence and an apologia. It is not the black race, no; although some people say so, who is responsible for ‘that time now passed’. ‘That time’ probably alludes to slavery because one of the ironies of postemancipation racism was blaming the victim (the slave) for his own bondage. The poet continues by exhorting Afro-Cubans to strive for education and moral perfection in order to erase the stigma that society has placed on them. To women, she writes: And, we women carrying out our mission have the obligation to understand our duties. Little is known about Cristina Ayala, the subject of a study by Carlos Alberto Cervantes and a short tribute by Nancy Morejón, who considers Ayala her literary foremother. Like Esteban Montejo, Ayala was taken from her slave mother to be raised by a madrina or godmother until she was five years old, at which time she was reunited with her mother. As a child, she attended a poor neighbourhood school where she learned little, but she loved literature and became an avid reader. She began writing poetry when she was only seven years old and published her first poem ‘Al Valle de Güines’ (To the Güines Valley) in 1885. She wrote extensively between 1885 and 1920, and gave poetry readings, including one at the Sociedad Gran Maceo de Santa Clara in 1911. Her ballads, sonnets, and poetic tributes to Plácido xxx\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n30\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nand José Martí appeared in more than twenty local newspapers and journals, including El Pueblo Libre (Free People) and El Sufragista (The Suffragist). The titles of these periodicals suggest that she participated in the social and political movements of the period. As Morejón notes, ‘Cristina wrote and struggled against slavery, against social inequality based on race or gender, as well as in support of national independence for Cubans of all types, origins, and colors’ (7). In 1926, perhaps as a tribute to the poet on the occasion of her death (date unknown), a volume of her collected poetry, Ofrendas mayabequinas, was published in Güines with a prologue by Valentín Cuesta Jiménez. This volume, however, is extremely rare: there is a copy in Cuba’s National Library and another in the Fondo Antiguo de la Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País in Güines. Morejón points out: ‘The country’s literary history does not record, in any of its major sources, the important work of this Black, rural, feminist and woman poet and journalist’. Gabriel Abudu noted in a letter to this editor that ‘[a]nother important Afro-Cuban writer of the early 20th Century was María Dámasa Jova, who published a fine collection of poetry in 1927’. In the two decades that followed publication of Cristina Ayala’s and Dámasa Jova’s poetry, two major writers emerged in the Spanish Caribbean – Julia de Burgos in Puerto Rico and Aida Cartagena Portalatín in the Dominican Republic – to open up new routes to the page. (Although Carmen Colón Pellot published her Ambar mulato with its self-rejecting ‘Oh Lord I Want to be White’ at the same time, her work harkened back to an earlier period when women produced timid, tentative verses that reinforced their precarious status in racist, patriarchal societies.) Burgos and Cartagena – through both their innovative works and their unconventional lives – struck out for the high seas. Following in their wake came a long line of talented island women: Dominican Sherezada Vicioso; Puerto Ricans Angela María Dávila and Mayra Santos-Febres; Cubans Marta Rojas, Rafaela Chacón Nardi, Georgina Herrera, Nancy Morejón, Excilia Saldaña, and Soleida Ríos. Although Chacón Nardi and Angela María Dávila are not included in this volume, they have gained recognition for their writing. Chacón was born in Havana in 1926 to a Martinican mother and a Cuban father. A prizewinning poet and an educator with a doctorate in pedagogy, she has published twenty books, including the following poetry collections: Viaje al sueño (Voyage to the Dream) in 1948, Del silencio y las voces (Of Silence and Voices) in 1979, and Una mujer desde su isla canta (A Woman From Her Island Sings) in 1994. Gifted with a lilting, lyrical voice, she writes about her island’s beauty, music’s birth, and a soldier’s song. Angela María Dávila (1944) has published only two collections of poetry: Homenaje xxxi\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n31\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nal ombligo (Tribute to the Belly Button) in 1967, written with José María Lima as a kind of erotic dialogue, and Animal fiero y tierno (Animal Fierce and Tender) in 1977. She has been acclaimed as one of Puerto Rico’s most inventive poets for her linguistic innovations and use of vernacular language. A new generation of Afra-Hispanic writers has emerged in the Dominican Republic, but they seldom write about race; instead, they examine issues relating to class and gender in a patriarchal society. Her experiences in the US made Sherezada Vicioso aware of problems in her own country: ‘Like racism, for example. Class differences. Santo Domingo is a very societally structured city. The situation of women is atrocious’. Vicioso and others of her generation are college-educated academics and writers who belong to workshops and groups such as the Círculo de Mujeres Poetas (Circle of Women Poets). University professor Jeanette Miller (b.1944), for example, has gained critical acclaim for her poetry, plays, movie scripts, and nonfiction. In poems such as ‘The Woman Whom I Know’ from Fichas de identidad (Identity Papers), she examines the weaknesses and pretensions of Dominican women: ‘The woman whom I know / wields invisible fingers / diffused voice / and straightened hair’. An educator, labour lawyer, and poet, Ida Hernández Caamaño (b.1949) reveals how domesticity thwarts the woman artist when she asks, in a poem from Viajera del polvo (Dust Travelling Woman): ‘How is poetry possible from hands busy with detergent, spices and heroics?’ Also born in 1949, Josefina de la Cruz Martínez is the only novelist of this group. Besides Una casa en el espacio (A House in Space), she has published four collections of poetry and a book of literary criticism based on her doctoral dissertation. Dulce Ureña (1960) has represented her country at literary events in the Caribbean and Latin America, and poetry from her Preámbulo and Babonucos has been anthologised in Common Threads and Sin otro profeta que su canto. Between 1985 and 1999, Angela Hernández Nuñez (b.1954) has published four books of poetry and five collections of short stories. A chemical engineer, educator, and political activist, she has, according to Franklin Gutiérrez, made a major contribution to feminism in the Dominican Republic through her activism and scholarship (92). A member of the Generation of 1980, Carmen Sánchez Aponte (b. 1960) published two poetry collections before winning the National Poetry Prize in 1996 for Demando otro tiempo (I Demand Another Time) in 1996. Another young writer, Aurora Arias Almánzor (b.1962), has degrees in art education and clinical psychology and has edited several magazines and newspapers, including one for the Center of Investigation for Women’s Action. Her publications include two collections of poetry and two of short xxxii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n32\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nstories. One of the most prolific and accomplished writers is Ylonka NaciditPerdomo, who has published six books of poetry and four works of literary criticism in the past decade. Although a lawyer by training, she has worked as a journalist and librarian to promote Dominican culture and literature.\n\nCentral America: ‘Memorizing the Map of Your Scars’ Although the European conquest and colonisation of Central America follows the same pattern as does that of the Caribbean, there are significant differences in its ethnic history, in its ‘map of scars’. The indigenous population was reduced but not eradicated by wars and massacres; free and enslaved Africans were ‘disappeared’ through assimilation into the majority Indo-Mestizo-European population; a second diaspora of Blacks from the British West Indies occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; Afro-Anglo-Hispanics are fewer in proportion to the majority Mestizo population; and most of these descendants of West Indians live along the Caribbean coast. Many North Americans find it difficult to believe that there was or is a visible Black presence south of the Río Grande, but it is estimated that approximately 0.2 million enslaved Africans were imported into Middle America (Palmer 70). Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán reports that in Mexico, for example, there were 20,569 Blacks by 1570 and 35,089 by 1646, but he concludes, ‘What is the significance of 15, 20 or 35 thousand Blacks diluted by 50 million Mexicans?’ (198). Luz María Martínez Montiel, a Mexican anthropologist of African descent, has also documented the African presence in Central America in a series of articles and books (Adams 210–16). Descendants of enslaved Africans – visible in the dark skins, wide noses, and coarse hair of Afro-Hispanics in rural towns and coastal cities – are called ‘Colonial Blacks’ to distinguish them from West Indians who later migrated to Central America to work on railroads, banana plantations, and the Panama Canal. According to Lourdes Martínez-Echazábal, ‘Colonial Blacks assimilated the language, religion and customs of the Spanish colonizer . . . [and] they identify with an (Afro)Hispanic, rather than with an (Afro)British cultural tradition’ (126). In his Central American Writers of West Indian Origin: A New Hispanic Literature, Ian Smart was one of the first scholars to document the emergence of an hispanophone literature by writers of Anglo-Antillean descent. Included among the writers is Eulalia Bernard, one of Central America’s first Black women writers, who published her first collection of poetry, Ritmohéroe, in 1982. Since then, other women writers, such as Shirley Campbell (Costa Rica), Juanita Mitil (Panama), June Beer and Mariana xxxiii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n33\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nYonüsg (Nicaragua), and Mirma Martínez (El Salvador) have added their voices to the literary discourse. Both Bernard and Campbell have now published several books and, through reviews, translations, and scholarly critiques of their work, are gaining an international reputation. The other writers are little known outside of their countries, although some of their poems have been anthologised and/or translated into English. The poetry of Juanita Mitil, for example, has appeared in the Afro-Hispanic Review and Erotique Noire / Black Erotica. A poet and journalist, she is active in the women’s movement and serves on the board of the Acción Reivindicadora del Negro Panameño (ARENEP). The anthology Ixok Amer-Go: Central American Women’s Poetry for Peace includes the works of other African-descended writers from Central America. Poet and painter June Beer (1935–1986) lived on Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast, where she supported Sandinismo, promoted cultural activities, and served as contributing editor to the bilingual newspaper Sunrise. In poems such as ‘La parcela’ (Land Plot) and ‘Vacacionej en Cornailan’ (Vacations on Corn Island), she recounts, in the dialect of Anglo-Caribbean immigrants, the social and economic difficulties of coastal dwellers. At the end of ‘La parcela’ she writes, ‘Peruese gerente de sonrisa guabinosa / mi dio sólo rialej paembarcarme y despuej qitarme la parcela’ (But that banker with the fishy smile / gave me just enough money to get in debt / and then took my land). Mariana Yonüsg was born in Venezuela but, since 1978, has lived in Nicaragua, where she participated in the freedom struggle. In 1985, she won the Gregorio Aguilar Barea Prize for Poetry, and her work has been published in Nuevo Amanecer and La Chachalaca, the magazine of Nicaragua’s Ministry of Culture. A medical specialist in cervical cancer and oral rehydration, she writes lyrical and militant poetry dealing with the complexities of love and the horrors of war, hunger, and poverty. In ‘Remembering Guillén: Affirmations to Explain the Death of a Child’, she writes: [This child] died from crossing, barefoot and alone, the long sadness, died from having centuries of hunger and cold, died from not having crayon-painted dreams, died not knowing a smile nor the brevity of Sundays nor what is hidden beneath the circus tent. (Anglesey 420) Mirma Martínez was born in 1966 in El Salvador, where she coordinates the cultural publication of the Salvadoran Art and Cultural Workers Association. xxxiv\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n34\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nShe has completed a collection of her work, Paralelo a su ausencia (Parallel to Your Absence), and her poetry has been published in such literary magazines as El Pregón, Códices, and the cultural supplement of El Mundo.\n\nSouth America: ‘Placentas Buried in This Land of Musicians and Poets’ Like the descendants of enslaved Africans in Central America, the Black populations of many South American countries have disappeared or been absorbed by the mestizo population. In a compelling article, ‘Racism: “Original Sin” of Argentine National Identity’, an Afro-Argentine reports that in 1778, 40 per cent or 80,000 of the 210,000 inhabitants of the Río de la Plata region were ‘negros, mulatos y zambos’ (Molina 50–51), but that the official policy of blanqueamiento or whitening, introduced in the midnineteenth century, resulted in the ‘disappearance’ of Blacks. It is estimated that from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, half a million slaves were brought to Spanish South America to work in the mines and on sugar and coffee plantations (Palmer 70). They were sold at slave auctions in colonial cities such as Cartagena, Maracaibo, Buenos Aires, and Montevideo, where they served as domestics and artisans. The majority, however, were sent to the grasslands and coastal plains of New Granada, where they established majority-Black enclaves in such places as Chocó, Colombia and Esmeraldas, Ecuador. It was in these enclaves and in the coastal cities that Afro-Latin American culture began to flourish. The first writers emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and they founded newspapers to publish their writing. None of these pioneering writers, however, was female. The founding mother of Afra-Uruguayan literature and one of the first Black women writers in Latin America is Virginia Brindis de Salas, who published two slender volumes of poetry in the 1940s and then disappeared from letters and life, leaving few traces of her existence. The newest star on that country’s literary horizon is poet and essayist Cristina Cabral, who wrote a great deal but published little before coming to the United States to pursue doctoral studies in Latin American and Afro-Hispanic literature. Another emerging writer is performing artist Beatriz Santos, whose essays and books on Afro-Uruguayan society, particularly the role of women, have helped to preserve her country’s African legacy. In his anthology of Black Uruguayan poets, Alberto Britos Serrat provides poems by and biographical sketches of three Black women writers, including Cabral. Britos also cites the work of poet and painter Clelia Nuñez Altamiranda, who was xxxv\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n35\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nborn in Montevideo in 1906. Beginning in 1960, she published poems in local newspapers and gave readings from her unpublished collection Esencia y voz del pensamiento (Essence and Voice of Thought). Two of her most interesting poems include ‘A Nicolás Guillén’, an ode to the Cuban poet on his visit to Uruguay, and ‘Canto negro’ (Black Song), which highlights the cultural and historical contributions of Africans in the Americas. Myriam Tammara La Cruz Gómez, born in Montevideo in 1951, pursued graduate studies in physics and medicine after completing her bachelor’s degree. Her sentimental poems, such as ‘Black Woman’, ‘Your Eyes’, and ‘Homeland’, treat love, motherhood, and nationalism in traditional styles and forms. In a conference paper, literary critic Caroll M. Young examined the writing of Sara Prieto and María Julia Bicca, two emerging writers; and in ‘The New Voices of Afro-Uruguay’, Young cites other Afra-Uruguayan writers, including Marta Gularte, América Ribero, and Beatriz Ramírez. Of particular significance, according to the critic, is Maruja Pereira, a contemporary of Virginia Brindis de Salas and founder of the first Black women’s political party, the Comité de Mujeres Negras Por la Paz y Contra el Fascismo. Little, however, is known about Pereira’s life and work. The best known Afra-Colombian writer is poet and essayist YvonneAmérica Truque, whose bilingual Spanish-French Proyección de los silencios was published in 1986. She migrated to Canada in the 1980s and is critical of political corruption and exploitation of the poor, themes that figure prominently in her work. Both of her sisters – Sonia and Colombia – are writers, following in the footsteps of their father, Carlos Arturo Truque (1927–1970), the distinguished Afro-Colombian poet and short story writer. Born in Buenaventura, Colombia, Sonia Nadhezda Truque edits an international, bilingual (Spanish-French) poetry journal, and she writes articles and book reviews. Her publications include an anthology of children’s poetry, a book of verse, and several collections of short stories. Colombia Truque has also published poetry as well as a book of short stories, Otro nombre para María y otros cuentos (Another Name for María and Other Stories). Edelma Zapata Pérez, daughter of Colombian poet and novelist Manuel Zapata Olivella, is also a writer, who recently published her first collection of poetry, Ritual con mi sombra. In Common Threads (27–34), Clementina Adams describes the work of Eyda María Caicedo Osorio, an emerging writer, who was born in Chocó, a coastal province of Colombia with a substantial Black population. Caicedo has published a novella, La hija del aguijón-I (The Sting’s Daughter-I), which deals with discrimination against poor Blacks by religious leaders, corrupt politicians, and wealthy professionals. Laurence Prescott describes xxxvi\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n36\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nfour other Afra-Colombian women writers, including poet María Teresa Ramírez, Luz Colombia de González, whose first book was cited in El Tiempo, Maura Valentine González, whose Poemas de la vida (Poems About Life) was published under the pseudonym ‘Ebony Pearl’, and Teresa Martínez de Varela Restrepo (b. 1914). According to Adams, Martínez de Varela is a poet, novelist, essayist, and biographer, who was born in Quibdó, Chocó but who lives in Bogota, where she has worked as a teacher and administrator. Sometimes writing under the pseudonym Lisa de Andráfueda, she has published the biography of an Afro-Colombian hero, an historical novel Guerra y amor (War and Love), and sentimental poems such as ‘My First Love’ and ‘Trilogy of a Kiss’. Although two Afra-Hispanic writers – Martínez de Varela and Brindis de Salas – published collections of poetry in the 1940s, Black women did not produce a body of literature until the 1980s and 1990s. One of the most prolific of these writers is Argentina Chiriboga of Ecuador, who has in the past decade published a children’s book, an anthology, two collections of poetry, and three critically acclaimed novels.\n\nNorth America: ‘No Promised Land, Nor Paradise’ Many Afra-Hispanic writers who were born in or have migrated to North America in search of education and employment have ambivalent feelings about that region. Some like the security and stability that they experience in the North; others feel disoriented and displaced in a land that is alien to them in language and culture; and still others superimpose the history of northern exploitation on their memories of home. Colombian-Canadian Yvonne-América Truque writes: There is no promised land, nor paradise No homeland to cling to After the long voyage And a seedless return. Lourdes Casal (1938–1981), who migrated to the United States from Cuba because she could not accept its revolutionary ideology, represents in her life and work the paradigmatic experience of the Latina. In ‘For Ana Veldford’ she voices contradictory feelings about her adopted country, proclaiming, ‘And still New York is my home. / I am ferociously loyal to this acquired patria chica’ but also lamenting, ‘I will always remain on the margin, / a stranger among the stones’. Lourdes wrote in both English and Spanish; she xxxvii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n37\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nwrote nonfiction in English because her scholarly writing was intended for US academics, but her poetry and prose were written in Spanish, her native tongue. Cuban-born Beatriz Rivera (b.1957) also lives in New York, where she is completing a doctorate in Spanish after receiving a master’s in philosophy from the Sorbonne. Her two novels, Midnight Sandwiches and Playing with Light, and her collection of short stories, African Passions, are written in English with occasional Spanish words and phrases. This writer alludes at times to Cuban cultural myths, and she deals with personal rather than political issues. Perhaps Rivera and Casal reflect their generational differences: Lourdes was radicalised by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, while Rivera was shaped by the pop culture of the 1980s. Similar differences are apparent in the themes and preoccupations of two Dominican-Yorks. Loida Maritza Pérez (1963) recently published her first novel, Geographies of Home, which deals with a young New York woman who feels trapped in the stifling immigrant culture of her conservative and religious Dominican parents. The protagonist is more concerned, almost narcissistically so, with personal questions about identity and place rather than with the deeper social and political problems that Caribbean immigrants encounter in a hegemonic, White, Anglo society such as the United States. Like Lourdes Casal, Sherezada Vicioso lived in New York during the 1960s and ’70s and participated in the freedom movement. Her poems and essays, therefore, reflect her pain and outrage at the plight of poor immigrants in that country. ‘If you stay in New York too long’, she writes, ‘you begin to get worn down by it. Anyone who is in the least sensitive can’t help but feel bruised by the destruction of our people’. Eventually, she became ill and retreated into silence. Finally, she returned home. Social and political issues also inform the writing of Puerto RicanDominican-Latina writer Sandra María Esteves. The titles of poems such as ‘For Lolita Lebrón’, ‘Anonymous Apartheid’, and ‘For Fidel Castro’ underscore her commitment to racial equality, Puerto Rican independence, and revolutionary politics. One of the best known and most acclaimed Latina writers, Esteves is an award-winning poet, essayist, performer, graphic artist, and producer, who became director of the African Caribbean Poetry Theater, an arts organisation that presents poetry readings and theatre productions. She recounts the emotional experience of attending a reading at the National Black Theater in Harlem, where she heard ‘nontraditional, nonclassical, free-form poetry that addressed itself to the immediate issues of our collective existence’. Her publications include three volumes of poetry: Yerbabuena (1980), which is said to have established an urban Latina xxxviii\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n38\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\naesthetic and thematic; Tropical Rains: A Bilingual Downpour (1984); and Bluestown Mockingbird Mambo (1990). The dynamic and revolutionary spirit that infuses her work is apparent in this definition: ‘A poem’, she writes, ‘is a simple truth that blows up like a bomb in your head’.\n\nAfrica: The Motherland The Republic of Equatorial Guinea, which gained its independence from Spain in 1968, after more than 150 years of colonial domination, is the only Spanish-speaking country in sub-Saharan Africa. Its colonial legacy is apparent in the social, political, and economic problems that have beset the country since independence. During the brutal dictatorship (1968– 1979) of Francisco Macias Nguema, for example, one-third of the population, including most intellectuals and professionals, went into exile in Gabon, Cameroon, or Spain. Although two autochthonous writers, both males, published their novels during the final years of Spanish hegemony, a national literature did not emerge until the end of the Macias regime, when EcuatoGuineans published their writing, founded journals, and organized cultural centers in Malabo, the capital. These organisations supported the writing of women such as Raquel Ilombe (1939–1992), pseudonym of Raquel Del Pozo Epita, who produced a book of poems, Ceiba, in 1978. Called ‘poet of the rain, poet of the sun’ by another writer, she was born on the island of Corisco to a Spanish father and Bantu mother but was raised in Spain. She also published Leyendas guineanas (1981), traditional stories for children, completed an unpublished book of poetry, Nerea, Ausencia, Amor, Olvido, and was writing 20 años de ir y venir a Guinea a year before her death. María Nsue Angüe, the best known woman writer of Equatorial Guinea, has lived most of her life in Spain, where she published Ekomo, based on the cultural traditions of the Fang, the largest ethnic group in her homeland. Emerging authors also include Ana Sohora, Caridad Riloba, Mercedes Jora, and Trinidad Morgades Besari, who began writing while attending the Universidad Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial. Morgades Besari has published essays and short stories in the country’s two literary magazines El Patio and Africa 2000, but she is best known for the play Antigona, which uses African cultural elements (dance rhythms and drum beats) to reinterpret Greek drama. The ‘long journey’ of writers María Nsue Angüe and Raquel Ilombo from their African Homeland to an Otherland – that is, perhaps, strange and distant – is emblematic of the many diasporas about which AfraHispanic Daughters write. The most traumatic, of course, was the African xxxix\n\nFront MatterD.pmd\n\n39\n\n01/30/2003, 3:18 PM\n\nDaughters of the Diaspora: Afra-Hispanic Writers\n\nDiaspora, when entire nations, after enduring captivity and enslavement, were subjected to a perilous journey across the Atlantic to the Americas, where they were sold at auction and forced to labour on sugar, cotton, and coffee plantations. The experience of that first ‘scattering of people far from their ancestral homelands’ is embedded in the cultural memory of the Daughters, whose poetry and prose remind readers of a shared myth of origin and of a shared history and culture. Curiously, some writers have retraced their ancestors’ steps and made the journey back to their roots. That journey has often been unsettling but also transformative. There have been other diasporas, other dislocations and disjunctures, that have shaped racial, cultural and national identity: the Afro-Antillean diaspora of Englishspeaking West Indians to the coasts of Central and South America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the self-exile and dis-exile (return home) of Cubans after the Revolution, the migration of Dominicans to the United States, the movement of Puerto Ricans from the island to the US mainland, and the flight of Ecuato-Guineans to Spain. Diasporas have profoundly affected the writing of Black Hispanic women because these movements mark imaginary spaces of dislocation and discontinuity. YvonneAmérica Truque writes of the ‘long voyage’ away from home and of the ‘seedless return’ to a country that no longer feeds the spirit. Writers who have crossed borders between countries, cultures, and languages into strange and alien Otherlands reveal feelings of displacement, isolation, and despair, but, ironically, this estrangement, this defamiliarisation, makes them look at themselves with new eyes. Afra-Hispanic literature has thus been enriched by the migratory and exilic experiences of writers who have had to reexamine identities, revision their patria, and chart radically different routes to the page.\n\nWorks Cited Adams, Clementina R.

Highly acclaimed by the AfroUruguayan community as a writer and intellectual, Brindis de Salas was the first Black woman writer in South America to publish two books, and, according to poet Gabriela Mistral, she was the first Afro-Uruguayan literary figure to gain international attention. Although she was said to have been born in Montevideo, the daughter of José Brindis de Salas, she published her first poem ‘Mi corazón’ (My Heart) in the journal Acción under the name Iris Virginia Salas. By 1946, when her first collection of poetry was published, she had appropriated the name Virginia Brindis de Salas as well as a relationship to a noted Black family. Indeed, the editors of Acción, who took credit for introducing ‘Iris’s’ poetry to the literary world, wrote that she was the ‘descendant of a family of great renown in intellectual circles’. In ‘Mis dos tíos ilustres’ (My Two Illustrious Uncles), a speech delivered in Buenos Aires and published in her second volume, she claims a familial relationship to Claudio Brindis de Salas, the great Cuban violinist, and Gabino Ezeiza, the famous Argentine payador or guitarist-singer from the River Plate region. Described by her contemporaries as a shy, quiet woman, Virginia Brindis de Salas is depicted in a photograph as a pensive intellectual with a penchant for books. She belonged to the Circle of Black Intellectuals, Artists, Journalists, and Writers (CIAPEN), which included such important literary figures as Pilar Barrios, Juan Julio Arrascaeta, and Carlos Cardoso Ferreira, and she was a founder and contributor to Nuestra raza (Our Race), a Black journal published in Montevideo from 1917 to 1950. Her first collection of poetry, Pregón de Marimorena (Brown Mary’s Street Call), is considered the first major publication by a Black Uruguayan writer.

In 1949, she published Cién cárceles de amor (One Hundred Love Laments), but a third volume, Cantos de lejanía (Faraway Songs), remained unpublished and is probably now extant. A race woman in every sense, she traces in her poetry the African roots of Uruguayan culture and describes Black popular culture – the songs, ritual dances (tango and conga), ancestral drums, and ceremonies such as Candombe, as well as Black archetypes and culture-bearers such as the gramillero or male ancestral figure; and she protests political, economic, and social conditions such as Yankee imperialism, racial oppression, and poverty in Montevideo’s slums. In spite of the poet’s accomplishments, there has been a one-man ‘campaign to write Virginia Brindis de Salas out of Uruguayan literary history’, according to Marvin A. Lewis.
