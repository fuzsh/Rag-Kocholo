        "text": "Cara Maisonette was an ER nurse and Bode's ex-girlfriend who initially returned to Edgewater to help her mother move but ultimately decided to stay in town and continue her nursing from Edgewater Memorial Hospital, at which point, she began to develop a romantic relationship with Jake.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nCara grew up in Edgewater, where she and her family lived next door to the Leone family. Cara and Bode became particularly close over the years and eventually began dating; they were high school sweethearts and would often sneak out during the late hours of the night. In fact, Sharon and Cara's mom used to joke that they were Romeo and Juliet. In addition to Bode, Cara was also quite close with Sharon. She'd even come over for family dinner on Sundays. However, after Bode's injury, Bode broke up with her, and Cara moved away.[1]\n\nAt 19, Cara got pregnant, and her mother helped her hide the pregnancy by claiming the baby as her own, leading town folk of Edgewater to believe that Genevieve is Cara's younger sister, when in actually, she is her daughter.[2]\n\nReturning to Edgewater[]\n\nYears later, Cara returns to town to help her mom pack up her childhood home, which they are putting up for sale. However, a power outage in the area results in Cara suffering an electrical burn and cardiac event, which Sharon helps her treat until an ambulance can arrive, even performing CPR. As Sharon treats Cara, she reveals that she didn't break up with Bode after his injury, as he had claimed. In fact, he broke up with her. Additionally, she reveals that she's training to become an ER nurse, following in her mother's footsteps, which proves useful when Sharon passes out from the heat and the inability to take her dialysis due to the power outage. Fortunately, Vince arrives soon thereafter, followed by the ambulance.[1]\n\nAfter bumping into Jake at Smokey's Tavern during Sharon's kidney donor event, Cara finds herself coaching him through a needle thoracostomy on the side of the road following a brutal motorcycle incident, in which Sharon's brakes were cut and Dolly and Paulie were severely injured. Dolly specifically is suffering from a deviated trachea. With Cara at his side, having performed the procedure before in ER, she instructs Jake step-by-step on how to save Dolly's life. Afterward, they head to Smokey's for a drink, where she reveals her plan to remain in Edgewater and begin her rotations at the local hospital.[3]\n\nAfter she begins dating Jake Crawford, she later reveals to him that her 'sister' Genevieve, is her biological daughter and that it is unknown if Bode is her father.[2]\n\nSix months pass since Bode returns to prison and in that time, Genevieve is told that Cara is her mother. [4]\n\nCara's death[]\n\nCara is impaled by a steel rod after an ambulance with Bode, Diego, and herself is knocked off the road by a fallen tree during a fire tornado. Her pupils are blown, and they discover that she's suffering from epidural hematoma, or plainly put, bleeding of the brain, due to the crash. With the hospital five miles away and them being unable to move her due to Cara having also been impaled, Bode and Diego attempt to keep her alive until backup can arrive. However, she eventually succumbs to her wounds, though in her final moments, she makes Bode promise that he will look after Genevieve in her absence, and the last words she hears are those of Jake telling her that he loves her.[5]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nSharon Leone[]\n\nHaving grown up next to the Leones during her adolescence, Cara became very close with her neighbors, especially Sharon, with whom she used to make inappropriate jokes with during family dinner on Sundays. Sharon even took Cara to get her IUD when her mother was busy working. However, at some point, the nature of their relationship changed, with Sharon being polite towards Cara, treating her as if she was anybody else in town. As it turned out, this was due to the fact that Bode told Sharon that Cara dumped him after he suffered his baseball injury. However, in actuality, it was Bode who dumped Cara, much to Sharon's surprise. In spite of any misunderstanding, the two of them still care deeply for one another and took turns treating each other during the power outage.\n\nBode Leone[]\n\nCara and Bode grew up together in Edgewater. They were next door neighbors, and even their parents were close. At some point, they began dating and were high school sweethearts. However, Bode broke up with Cara after his baseball injury; she was heartbroken. Baseball was his entire identity, and losing it killed his confidence, as baseball was the quickest way to Vince's heart, and Bode simply wanted his father to be proud of him. Going for Cal Fire was too loaded, whereas baseball came naturally to Bode. The two of them reunite for the first time after years apart at the site of Dolly and Paulie's crash. Unbeknownst to Bode at the time, Cara was pregnant when they broke up and gave birth to a daughter, who she named Genevieve and was raised by Cara's mother.\n\nJake Crawford[]\n\nMuch as the case with her relationship with Bode, Cara grew up in Edgewater with Jake, though the two were merely friends at the time as she was with Bode, and Jake was known as a player. It wasn't until she returned to Edgewater years later to help her mom sell her house that the two would rekindle their friendship, which quickly developed into a romantic relationship despite Cara's past with Bode. Despite Jake's previous persona and baggage, she seeks to further pursue a potential romance. After crossing paths at Smokey's Tavern, the two of them would find themselves working together on the side of the road to save Dolly's life after she was involved in a motorcycle accident. After Cara reveals that she intends to stay in Edgewater, the two would go on their first date at the fair, which was interrupted when one of the rides go haywire, though the night ends with a kiss. From there, their relationship grows, with Cara trusting Jake with a truth that few knew, that being her sister Genevieve is actually her daughter, who she allegedly conceived with Bode when they were high school sweethearts.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nGet Your Hopes Up\n\nMama Bear\n\nA Fair to Remember\n\nWatch Your Step\n\nI Know It Feels Impossible\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nSomething's Coming\n\nLike Breathing Again\n\nToo Many Unknowns\n\nThis Storm Will Pass\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nCara Maisonette is portrayed by Sabina Gadecki.\n\nGallery[]"
