        "text": "Vesper Hunt is an online game on The 39 Clues website.\n\nGame play[]\n\nThe main goal of the game is to capture Vespers around the world. You will be given a list of suspects and your first location. You will play a minigame and once completed, you will be given a hint to your suspect's identity, and a hint to your next location. When you are given a hint to the Vesper 's identity, click on the tab where the hint might be related to e.g. Suspect has left (color) hair on a brush. thus click the Hair tab and click on the color indicated. You will then be shown a holographic globe (possibly the Gideon, the Cahill Satellite) to choose where your next location be, using the hint given. This routine will continue until you get the identity of the Vesper. Once you nailed down to one suspect, the location you're going will be where the suspect's located.\n\nIf in the case you get the location wrong or suspect not found, you must wait until \"Cahill Command re-finds the suspect's track\" or use \"Backups\". Once the waiting period is over, you must click on the correct location.\n\nYou can also share backups with other agents. To do this, go under \"Backups\" and under your agent card click \"Share\". Then you will be given a list of your allies, and you can pick who you want to share it with.\n\nAlso, the waiting time between new assignments will increase with the more assignments you complete and medals you obtained.\n\nMinigames[]\n\nThere are three minigames.\n\nMatching Game[]\n\nYou will have to match the circuits on both sides of the same colour within the time limit of 1 minute and 30 seconds.\n\nCircuit Game[]\n\nYou will have to connect the wires to the power source to light up the message within a time limit of 1 minute and 30 seconds.\n\nNumber Game[]\n\nYou will have to find your target file and save them by pressing the Spacebar within a time limit of 1 minute and 30 seconds. Be careful! Don't land on the file passed by lasers, or else fail. If you save the wrong file, the file will have a bug picture, and you have to remove it by saving files again.\n\nSUSPECTS (Name and Birth Place)[]\n\nAurora Swenson - Stockholm, Sweden\n\nCarlo Aquino - Bacolod City, Philipines\n\nCarlos Alvarez - Santiago, Chile\n\nCarrie Cumberbatch - Durham, United Kingdom\n\nChase Fender - Zanzibar, Tanzania\n\nDora Harrison - Chicago, USA\n\nEstelle Le Noir - Port Louis, Mauritius\n\nFrederico Reale - Milan, Italy\n\nHannah Grimm - Auckland, New Zealand\n\nIvars Ozols - Riga, Latvia\n\nJason Villa - Salvador, Brazil\n\nMadeline Vega - Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nMercer Prince - Berlin, Germany\n\nMoxie Chang - London, UK\n\nOonagh Flannigan - Galway, Ireland\n\nStorm Wu - Takau, Taiwan\n\nTed Winters - Dallas, USA\n\nTessa Quicksilver - San Fransisco, USA\n\nUlrich Von Breton - Papsdorf, Germany\n\nViktor Vokov - Minsk, Belarus\n\nWilliam Lafayette - Paris, France\n\nThe list of suspects never changes.\n\nLocations[]\n\nNew York\n\nRio de Janeiro\n\nTokyo\n\nSydney\n\nMumbai\n\nCairo\n\nAthens\n\nMexico City\n\nLondon\n\nBangkok\n\nMoscow\n\nSantiago\n\nShanghai\n\nBuenos Aires\n\nMadrid\n\nCape Town\n\nParis\n\nBeijing\n\nMontreal\n\nFrankfurt\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIt is also an app, thus making it the second 39 Clues app after Madrigal Maze.\n\nIn the app, there are aditional two suspects\n\n1.
