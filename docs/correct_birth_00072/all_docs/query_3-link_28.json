        "text": "Register for this Event\n\nMeet the Author, Cara Black!\n\nJoin the Virtual Cambrian and Pearl Mystery Club for a special virtual author visit from Cara Black on Wednesday, June 26, 2024!\n\nSpecial thanks goes to Pam Crider, the leader of the Cambrian and Pearl Mystery Book Club.\n\n-\n\nVolunteer Pam Crider Loves Reading Mystery Books!\n\nA former San Jose Public Library Branch Manager, Pam retired after thirty years and \"wanted to connect with others by joining a book club in my community.\" She regularly attended Cambrian's Mystery Book Club before the pandemic and started to facilitate the Club virtually during the pandemic. The Club still meets virtually.\n\nAfter reading one of Cara Black's novels previously, Pam and the members were pleased to find out that Cara Black was offering to meet with book clubs to talk about her new book, Murder at la Villette.\n\nPam enjoys the many friendships and community connections that she has cultivated. She says,\n\n\"It is also a way for me to stay connected to the library which was part of my life for so many years. I always enjoy participating in the library's Silicon Valley Reads program and am glad that I have the opportunity to support another adult program that promotes building commuity through books. Besides volunteering with the mystery book club, I am a member of several other library book discussion groups at a variety of branches.\"\n\nOne mystery book that she found particularly engrossing was Killers of a Certain Age by Deanna Raybourn. She says that the Club reads a \"variety of mystery authors and genres.\"\n\nPam hopes that book club members\n\n\"enjoy connecting to others through stimulating, literate discussions with other readers who enjoy mystery books. In particular, during the pandemic, I think the book club helped readers remain connected with the community during a period which was so isolating.\"\n\nPlease Join Us at Cara Black's Author Visit!\n\nWho: Author Cara Black\n\nWhat: Virtually visits the Cambrian and Pearl Mystery Book Club on Zoom to discuss her book, Murder at la Villette.\n\nWhen: Wednesday, June 26 from 6:00-7:00 p.m.\n\nHow to Register: Click on this link and register!\n\nHow to Receive Zoom Link: After you register, we will email the Zoom Link about one hour before the program.\n\nFormat: Cara Black will talk about the book and read a passage. She will then answer some author-previewed questions.\n\nRegister for this Event\n\nFuture Book Club Titles:\n\nJuly 24, 2024 - I Will Find You by Harlan Coben\n\nAugust 28, 2024 - The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura David\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!"
