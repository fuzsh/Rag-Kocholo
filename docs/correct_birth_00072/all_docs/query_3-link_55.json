Or bring your own books to be signed!ABOUT THE AUTHORCara Black is the author of twenty-one books in the New York Times bestselling Aim&eacute;e Leduc series as well as the thrillers Three Hours in Paris, a national bestseller, and Night Flight to Paris. She has received multiple nominations for the Anthony and Macavity Awards, and her books have been translated into German, Norwegian, Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, and Hebrew. She lives in San Francisco with her husband and visits Paris frequently.&nbsp;ABOUT THE BOOKParisian private investigator Aim&eacute;e Leduc has been framed for the murder of her daughter&rsquo;s father&mdash;now she&rsquo;s on the lam, and must find the real killer to clear her name in this thrilling 21st installment of Cara Black&rsquo;s New York Times bestselling mystery series.Parisian private investigator Aim&eacute;e Leduc doesn&rsquo;t know that her life is about to be upended. Her ex, Melac, has been hounding her to move their daughter, Chlo&eacute;, to Brittany. Aim&eacute;e is fed up with his threats to take her to court and has stopped answering his calls. Which is why she doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s waiting for her by the Bassin de la Villette as she leaves a client&rsquo;s office late one night. When she finds him there, bleeding in the canal, he has just been stabbed by an assailant, who knocks Aim&eacute;e unconscious and plants the bloody knife in her hands.Now Aim&eacute;e is in police custody, debilitated by a concussion, with overwhelming evidence pointing to her as Melac&rsquo;s killer. She must figure out who murdered Melac&mdash;not an easy job, given the target on his back as a former homicide investigator. Cut off from her typical network and forced to operate under multiple layers of cover, Aim&eacute;e must go deep into the underbelly of Paris&rsquo;s 19th arrondissement, where she rubs shoulders with biker gangs, paranoid journalists, grieving parents, and frustratingly tight-lipped ex-cops on her hunt for justice.
