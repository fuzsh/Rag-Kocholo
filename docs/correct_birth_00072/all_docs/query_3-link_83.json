        "text": "Oh Wow! This popular youtuber showed up on my channel, but I have never heard of her until now. I did not know that Irene Cara was also part Cuban. Her father is a Black man from Puerto Rico and her mother is cuban. Irene Cara was born in the Bronx, New York, so I just learned about a new term that I've never heard of until now regarding Puerto Rican people who whom were born in New York and thereabouts. They have been referred to as \"Nuyorican\". Interesting. My step-brother is from Buffalo, New York, however, I've never heard him say anything about this. I did not hear of this on this channel but there are a lot of videos now about Irene Cara and this one seems interesting.\n\nAnyway, she posted some information about Irene Cara and some other interesting tidbits. I recently heard about the Byron Allen award show and she also said it was a great event. So now, I like this youtuber and plan on listening in on her again. Her name is Patty Jackson, maybe someone has heard of her before. At any rate, I am posting this first video that I have come across. She also said that at the same time the Griot Awards show aired, the Soul Train awards show also aired.\n\n13 hours ago, ProfD said:\n\nThe term Nuyorican has been around for a couple decades now.\n\nI'm not sure why you mention this (I did not watch the video), but \"Nuyorican\" has been around a lot longer than 20 years -- I can recall the term for most of my life. @Delano you may be familiar with the Nuyorican Poets Cafe -- that goes back ... what 50 years?\n\nHummm I thought Aretha Franklin sang all those songs from Sparkle. I also remember Irene from the TV series Fame (she was in that right?). Sorry to hear she was Blacklisted I just assumed that she aged out, failing to stay relevant in a rapidly changing industry... Did she have any hit records?"
