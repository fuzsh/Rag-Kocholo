        "text": "Lemon juice, bleach, and oil on black canvas. 16x20in. 2024\n\nWhat makes a matriarch so strong? Is it in the strength of her hands? Is it in the strength of her loins that have birthed generations? Is it in her resounding voice which has sang many a lullaby, a praise,and a hymn? Is it within her warm loving voice that broke in screams and in tears through the struggle of a lifetime? Is it through the struggle of her people? Is it within the struggle to be alive? She knows struggle. She continues to provide. She will not be moved. She is still here today.\n\nLemon juice and oil on raw canvas, 16x20in. 2024\n\nI will never forget the story of how my grandmother died. She was always so beautiful in every picture that was ever taken of her. Sometimes when I look into the burning glow of her stare, her eyes that twinkled as if they emitted their own light, I see my mother, my sisters, myself. It’s hard to think that at this point we are all older than she lived to be. But without her existence none of us would be here. My mother said that when she was five years old, my grandfather came to her one morning slowly and calmly. He said “Your mother is dead”. He said this knowing that She had passed in her sleep. My young mother looked up at my papa and smiled…then she started to laugh. “Stop playing, daddy, no she’s not… Where is she?” He just stood there for a while, and then he started to cry. That’s when she knew. She was gone. Celebrating her memory that continues to live…\n\nLemon juice and oil on canvas, 14x18in. 2024\n\nIt is a memory that my mother says she recalls as if it was yesterday…a memory passed down to me through this story that I’m telling you now. Everyone was there at my Aunt Rose’s house that day: my grandfather, my step grandmother, some neighbors and other family friends. My mom says that Aunt Rose would always play the piano for her students within her class and when family would gather. She says that she would always play the same lively tune but she can’t remember the name of the song…she could still picture her hands scattered across the keys, her flowing dress printed with hot pink flowers and giant bright green leaves. Many years later she would pass due to dementia, but that night, my uncle Darald, my mother and uncle ray got to pose for a lovely family photo on Rose’s decorative piano bench.\n\nlemon juice, ink and white texture paste on paper, 16x20in. 2022\n\nInspired by the sculpture of Pandora releasing chaos in the world, this work makes contact with black history after being isolated in a white hegemony. The growth that I have experienced moving from Atlanta to Detroit, vibrates and echoes around me, exposing the zones of color that have been historically mapped and sustained through redlining and discrimination. Through decolonizing my mind and walking through these spaces, I am able to grow and make contact with my true self, even exposing the very roots of my hair and parts of my being that were forcefully hidden from me for a certain period of time.\n\nlemon juice, oil, and texture paste on paper. 30x40in.\n\nBeing often unable to afford things in Bronze, Savage would cover her plaster works with a layer of shoe polish mixed with brown paint as it revealed a very similar luster to Bronze. As an artist, I have always admired the intuitive connections that we make with materials, especially those that we create ourselves…this becoming a conversation of alchemy. Despite the financial and social struggles within Savage’s career, her prolific studio cultivated much life, seeking to find equal rights for African Americans in the arts.\n\noil, lemon juice, and ink on paper, 16x20in. 2022\n\nThis work is inspired by the photography of Benedict J Fernandez and the funeral procession for Martin Luther King Jr. imagining the intensity of seeing his wake in a civil awakening of confronting racism. This bring up a multitude of emotions and the symbol of the white rose acts as a mean to pacify but also allow the audience to dream of their past, present, and future as Dr. King always shared.\n\nColor in White, oil and lemon juice on canvas, 30x40in. 2022\n\nGrowing within a landscape plagued by white supremacy, how can the black body be visible and free of its residue ? Seeing the color in white, and seeking to trace the diaspora through the earth and the freedom of movement to connect these communities together. One body is lemon juice and the other oil paint. In the conversation of the museum, how have we dealt with engaging with hidden histories of the Bipoc community and how have we sought to memorialize them as well. What have we learned from the black community through its face as viewed within the museum? Are we making contact with this face at all?"
