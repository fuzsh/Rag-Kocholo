        "text": "April 20-25, 2025\n\nContact Meg at whalenmj55@gmail.com to learn more about this exclusive trip.\n\nThe information below is for the April 2024 trip. It will be updated with details for 2025 shortly.\n\nWant to join me for APRIL IN PARIS?\n\nAnyone up for another trip with me in Paris?\n\nYou’re invited once again to join me, other mystery lovers and Francophiles for an exclusive week in Paris.\n\nWe will again be exploring memorable scenes associated with the cases my private investigator has solved in my Aimée Leduc series. We will also visit scenes from my second WW2 thriller, Night Flight to Paris. And have you ever dreamed of having a Chanel bag of your own, like Aimée?\n\nThis APRIL IN PARIS adventure is beginning to take shape, an interest list is already forming.\n\nIf you are interested or have questions, please contact Meg—our trip organizer—ASAP at whalenmj55@gmail.com, as we are confirming our activities and moving forward.\n\nThe dates: April 28-May 4, 2024.\n\nThe cost: $2,100.\n\nThis will/may include, barring unforeseen circumstances:\n\nNavigo Pass for the week\n\n3 Walking Tours, two Aimée Leduc-related, one Kate Rees WW2-related\n\nA food event with a local chef\n\nA canal excursion\n\nA textile event, making a handbag from Chanel remnants (not confirmed yet)\n\nNightly aperos @ 6 PM in the Relais Monceau hotel to revisit the day (optional)\n\nNot included:\n\nAirfare\n\nLodgings\n\nMeals (breakfast included @ the Relais)\n\nHotel rooms are currently reserved at the Relais Monceau, our favorite hotel, for 181 Euros/single occupancy, plus 3.13 Euros per adult per day for City tax. Full breakfast is included.\n\nIf you wish to book, please use APRIL IN PARIS/CARA BLACK TOUR and reserve a room directly with the hotel front desk (m.boyer@designhotelst.com). We have 12 rooms reserved at this rate. Cancellation policy per the hotel: Credit card required at time of booking. Cancellation free of charge until April 18; first night will be due in case of late cancellation. No show will be complete charge.\n\nOur boutique hotel is located in the Paris neighborhood described in my book, Murder in Clichy, in the 8th arrondissement. We will meet in the hotel salon each evening to sample French wines and discuss the day’s events, with a bit of book talk thrown into the mix.\n\nYou are also welcome to choose your own accommodation and meet up with us nightly in the salon if you prefer.\n\nPlease note that this itinerary may change, depending on time or availability of some of our venues, or a venue change due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nRain or shine, we will hit the cobblestones every day.\n\nThis adventure will require a modicum of self-reliance in terms of getting around, but it should nonetheless be a grand adventure. It will not be a hike, but you will need to be prepared to walk every day.\n\nWe will be using the Metro (stairs included) and buses. Meg is already breaking in new shoes; her pair last trip didn’t pass muster. You will also have plenty of time to explore on your own if you so desire. Be prepared for a different kind of visit. We are not a formal tour company, we are friends sharing an adventure! Our liability is strictly limited to include only what is previously stated in this newsletter.\n\nSpace will be limited, so please submit a non-refundable deposit of $500 to Meg by 11/1/23. Receipt of your deposit confirms your reservation and acceptance of all terms of travel and costs as stated.\n\nThe remainder of the balance ($1600) is due by 2/14/24. Meg will accept checks, or Venmo. Any questions, please contact Meg at whalenmj55@gmail.com."
