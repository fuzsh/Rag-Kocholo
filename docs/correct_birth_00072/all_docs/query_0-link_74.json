This may be relevant to understanding the relationship between early life environment and body size and proportions. We investigated associations between birth month and anthropometry among rural highland (nâ=â162) and urban lowland (nâ=â184) Peruvian children aged 6 months to 8 years. Stature; head-trunk height; total limb, ulna, tibia, hand, and foot lengths; head circumference; and limb measurements relative to head-trunk height were converted to internal age-sex-specific z scores. Lowland and highland datasets were then analyzed separately for birth month trends using cosinor analysis, as urban conditions likely provide a more consistent environment compared with anticipated seasonal variation in the rural highlands. Among highland children birth month associations were significant most strongly for tibia length, followed by total lower limb length and stature, with a peak among November births. Results were not significant for other measurements or among lowland children. The results suggest a prenatal or early postnatal environmental effect on growth that is more marked in limb lengths than trunk length or head size, and persists across the age range studied. We suggest that the results may reflect seasonal variation in maternal nutrition in the rural highlands, but other hypotheses such as variation in maternal vitamin D levels cannot be excluded.

Our study compared the head circumferences of neonates who were later diagnosed with ASD with a control group. Additional comparisons on morphological disproportions at birth included the head circumference-to-height and head circumference-to-weight ratios. We recruited 422 children with ASD and 153 typically developing children. Head circumference, body length and weight at birth were collected and standardized as percentile scores according to gestational age and gender. Our results revealed that genuine macrocephaly was significantly higher in children with other pervasive developmental disorders compared with the control group. This difference was not observed with regard to genuine microcephaly. Relative macrocephaly and relative microcephaly were significantly more frequent in children with autism disorder compared with the control group with regard to body length. The differences in relative macrocephaly and microcephaly, as well as in other parameters, between diagnostic subgroups suggest that the presence of several neurological mechanisms plays a role in the later expression of different phenotypes. An increased head circumference-to-body length ratio in newborns may be a factor to follow that could be related to ASD. Â©2013 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

The previous reference curves from Indonesia, approximately 8Â years ago, were based on the data collected from teaching hospitals only with limited gestational ages. The aims of the study were to update the reference curves for birth weight, supine length and head circumference for Indonesia, and to compare birth weight curves of boys and girls, first child and later children, and the ones in the previous studies. Data were extracted from the Maternal-Perinatal database between 1998-2007. Only live singletons with recorded gestational ages of 26 to 42Â weeks and the exact time of admission to the neonatal facilities delivered or referred within 24Â h of age to Sardjito Hospital, five district hospitals and five health centers in Yogyakarta Special Territory were included. Newborns with severely ill conditions, congenital anomaly and chromosomal abnormality were excluded. Smoothening of the curves was accomplished using a third-order polynomial equation. Our study included 54,599 singleton live births. Growth curves were constructed for boys (53.3%) and girls (46.7%) for birth weight, supine length, and head circumference. At term, mean birth weight for each gestational age of boys was significantly higher than that of girls. While mean birth weight for each gestational age of first-born-children, on the other hand was significantly lower than that of later-born-children. The mean birth weight was lower than that of Lubchenco's study. Compared with the previous Indonesian study by Alisyahbana, no differences were observed for the aterm infants, but lower mean birth weight was observed in preterm infants. Updated neonatal reference curves for birth weight, supine length and head circumference are important to classify high risk newborns in specific area and to identify newborns requiring attention.\n\nAssociation between patterns of maternal substance use and infant birth weight, length, and head circumference.\n\nPubMed\n\nShankaran, Seetha; Das, Abhik; Bauer, Charles R; Bada, Henrietta S; Lester, Barry; Wright, Linda L; Smeriglio, Vincent\n\n2004-08-01\n\nTo determine the effects of patterns of drug use during term pregnancy on infant growth parameters at birth. Histories of cocaine, opiate, alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use during the 3-month period before pregnancy and the 3 trimesters of pregnancy were recorded at the infants' 1-month visit. Patterns of use were categorized as consistently high, moderate, or low/none or increasing/decreasing, and effects on growth parameters were analyzed in multivariate linear regression analyses, with adjustment for clinical site, maternal age, prepregnancy weight, multidrug use, and socioeconomic status. A total of 241 cocaine-exposed women and 410 non-cocaine-exposed women participated in the study. In the cocaine-exposed group, 75% used alcohol, 90% used tobacco, and 53% used marijuana; in the non-cocaine-exposed group, 57% used alcohol, 34% used tobacco, and 19% used marijuana. Birth weight, birth length, and head circumference were significantly greater among infants born to women who used no drugs, compared with women with any cocaine, opiate, alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana use, and were greater among infants born to cocaine nonusers, compared with cocaine users. With adjustment for confounders, birth weight was significantly affected by cocaine (deficit of 250 g with consistently low pattern) and tobacco (deficits of 232 g with consistently high pattern, 173 g with consistently moderate pattern, 153 g with decreasing pattern, and 103 g with consistently low pattern). Head size was affected by cocaine (deficit of 0.98 cm with consistently moderate pattern) and tobacco (deficits of 0.72 cm with consistently high pattern and 0.89 cm with consistently moderate pattern). Birth length was affected by tobacco use only (deficits of 0.82 cm with consistently high pattern and 0.98 cm with decreasing use). Patterns of tobacco use during pregnancy affect birth weight, length, and head circumference, whereas cocaine affects birth weight and head size, when adjustments are made for\n\nMaternal seafood consumption and infant birth weight, length and head circumference in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrantsÃ¦ter, Anne Lise; Birgisdottir, Bryndis Eva; Meltzer, Helle Margrete; Kvalem, Helen Engelstad; Alexander, Jan; Magnus, Per; Haugen, Margareta\n\n2012-02-01\n\nResults from previous studies on associations between maternal fish and seafood intakes and fetal growth are inconclusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate how maternal intakes of seafood, subtypes of seafood and supplementary n-3 fatty acids were associated with infant birth weight, length and head circumference in a prospective study in Norway. The study population included 62Â 099 participants in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. The mothers answered an FFQ in mid pregnancy. The FFQ comprised detailed questions about intake of various seafood items and n-3 supplements. Data on infant birth weight, length and head circumference were obtained from the Medical Birth Registry. We used multivariable regression to examine how total seafood, various seafood subtypes and supplementary n-3 intakes were associated with birth size measures. Total seafood intake was positively associated with birth weight and head circumference. Lean fish was positively associated with all birth size measures; shellfish was positively associated with birth weight, while fatty fish was not associated with any birth size measures. Intake of supplementary n-3 was negatively associated with head circumference. The relative risk of giving birth to a small baby (Â <Â 2500Â g) in full-term pregnancies was significantly lower in women who consumed >60Â g/d of seafood than in women who consumed â¤Â 5Â g/d (ORÂ =Â 0Â·56 (95Â % CI 0Â·35, 0Â·88). In conclusion, maternal seafood consumption was positively associated with birth size, driven by lean fish intake, while supplementary n-3 intake was negatively associated with infant head circumference.\n\nCreation and validation of the Singapore birth nomograms for birth weight, length and head circumference based on a 12-year birth cohort.\n\nPubMed\n\nPoon, Woei Bing; Fook-Chong, Stephanie M C; Ler, Grace Y L; Loh, Zhi Wen; Yeo, Cheo Lian\n\n2014-06-01\n\nBoth gestation and birth weight have significant impact on mortality and morbidity in newborn infants. Nomograms at birth allow classification of infants into small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) categories, for risk stratification and more intensive monitoring. To date, the growth charts for preterm newborn infants in Singapore are based on the Fenton growth charts, which are constructed based on combining data from various Western growth cohorts. Hence, we aim to create Singapore nomograms for birth weight, length and head circumference at birth, which would reflect the norms and challenges faced by local infants. Growth parameters of all babies born or admitted to our unit from 2001 to 2012 were retrieved. Following exclusion of outliers, nomograms for 3 percentiles of 10th, 50th, and 90th were generated for the gestational age (GA) ranges of 25 to 42 weeks using quantile regression (QR) combined with the use of restricted cubic splines. Various polynomial models (second to third degrees) were investigated for suitability of fit. The optimum QR model was found to be a third degree polynomial with a single knotted cubic spline in the mid-point of the GA range, at 33.5 weeks. Check for goodness of fit was done by visual inspection first. Next, check was performed to ensure the correct proportion: 10% of all cases fall above the upper 90th percentile and 10% fall below the lower 10th percentile. Furthermore, an alternative formula-based method of nomogram construction, using mean, standard deviation (SD) and assumption of normality at each gestational age, was used for counterchecking. A total of 13,403 newborns were included in the analysis. The new infant-foetal growth charts with respect to birth weight, heel-crown length and occipitofrontal circumference from 25 to 42 weeks gestations with the 10th, 50th and 90th were presented. Nomograms for birth weight, length and head circumference at birth had significant impact on neonatal\n\nAmniotic Fluid Arginine from Gestational Weeks 13 to 15 Is a Predictor of Birth Weight, Length, and Head Circumference.\n\nPubMed\n\nBjÃ¸rke-Jenssen, Astrid; Ueland, Per Magne; BjÃ¸rke-Monsen, Anne-Lise\n\n2017-12-14\n\nArginine is a constituent of proteins and a precursor for polyamines and nitric oxide, and is essential for placentation, angiogenesis, and growth. Maternal plasma arginine concentrations are found to be lower in pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction, and arginine supplementation in later pregnancy is reported to increase birth weight. We measured arginine and the metabolites asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in the amniotic fluid obtained in pregnancy weeks 13 to 15 from 363 pregnancies with a documented normal outcome and related the concentrations to birth weight, length, and head circumference. Arginine was higher in the amniotic fluid from female (mean 40.8 (SD 10.6) Âµmol/L) compared to male fetuses (37.4 (SD 11.2) Âµmol/L, p = 0.003). Despite the gender difference, arginine in the amniotic fluid from gestational weeks 13-15 was the strongest predictor for birth weight, length, and head circumference. ADMA was a strong predictor for birth weight and length, SDMA for birth weight, while Arg/ADMA and Arg/SDMA only predicted head circumference in multiple linear regression models. Due to increased arginine demands, pregnancy is considered a state of relative arginine deficiency. Our findings reflect the importance of a good maternal arginine status in early pregnancy, an observation that should be evaluated in an intervention study.\n\nBirth weight and optic nerve head parameters.\n\nPubMed\n\nSamarawickrama, Chameen; Huynh, Son C; Liew, Gerald; Burlutsky, George; Mitchell, Paul\n\n2009-06-01\n\nTo assess the relationship of birth weight, birth length, and head circumference as proxy markers of intrauterine growth, cup/disc ratio, and other optic disc parameters measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Population-based cross sectional analysis. The Sydney Childhood Eye Study examined 2353 primarily 12-year-old children from 21 randomly selected secondary schools during 2003 to 2005. Of 2353 children examined, 2134 (90.7%) had OCT scans (Zeiss Stratus OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) and are included in this study. The \"fast\" optic disc scan protocol was used. Birth weight, birth length, and head circumference were ascertained from health records. Height and weight were measured using standardized protocols, body mass index (BMI) was defined as weight (kilograms)/ height squared (meters), and sociodemographic information was collected in a questionnaire completed by parents. Low birth weight was defined as birth weight birth weight had decreased vertical disc diameter, increased cup diameter, and increased cup/disc ratio by 30 microm (P = 0.009), 44 microm (P = 0.004), and 0.03 (P<0.0001), respectively. After adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, height, axial length, and BMI, birth weight remained positively associated with vertical optic disc diameter and inversely associated with both vertical optic cup diameter and vertical cup/disc ratio (each kilogram increase was associated with a 0.0133-mm larger mean disc diameter; P = 0.04; a 0.0203-mm smaller mean cup diameter; P = 0.02; and a 0.0136 reduction in mean cup/disc ratio; P = 0.002). These associations were not present in children with gestational age less than 33 weeks. Smaller birth length and head circumference were similarly associated with larger cup/disc ratio.

The objective of the study was to compare birth characteristics in singleton newborns delivered by women previously treated for Graves' disease (GD), toxic nodular goiter (TNG), or nontoxic goiter (NTG). This was a nested case-control design within a national cohort registry study from 1950 through 2006. The study was conducted at a university and a hospital center in collaboration. The birth characteristics of newborns (n = 3421) delivered in a cohort of 43 633 women treated for GD or toxic nodular goiter by radioiodine or surgery (exposed group) at least 1 year prior to pregnancy were compared with newborns (n = 2914) of 45 655 mothers, previously operated for NTG (unexposed group). The primary outcome was birth weight, length, and head circumference. The secondary outcome was malformations, gestational age, and type of hyperthyroidism. The birth weight of exposed children was 3431 Â± 607 g (mean Â± SD) compared with the unexposed, 3520 Â± 641 g (P < .001). The cumulative odds ratio (OR) for lower birth weight was 1.29 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.43]. The average birth length for the exposed children was 50.0 Â± 2.7 cm compared with the unexposed of 50.4 cm Â± 2.6 cm (P < .01) [cumulative OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.13-1.37)]. The head circumference was 34.5 Â± 1.9 cm among exposed and 34.7 Â± 1.8 cm, respectively (P < .001), with an OR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.13-1.35). No differences in birth characteristics were observed between children born after maternal GD or toxic nodular goiter. Previous GD or TNG may influence the birth characteristics several years after radioiodine or surgical treatment.\n\nMaternal urinary iodine concentration up to 1.0 mg/L is positively associated with birth weight, length, and head circumference of male offspring.\n\nPubMed\n\nRydbeck, Filip; Rahman, Anisur; GrandÃ©r, Margaretha; EkstrÃ¶m, Eva-Charlotte; Vahter, Marie; Kippler, Maria\n\n2014-09-01\n\nAdequate iodine status in early life is crucial for neurodevelopment. However, little is known about the effects of maternal iodine status during pregnancy on fetal growth. The present study investigated the potential impact of maternal iodine status during pregnancy on offspring birth size. This large prospective cohort study was nested in a Bangladeshi population-based randomized supplementation trial in pregnant women [MINIMat (Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions in Matlab)]. Urine samples obtained at 8 wk of gestation from 1617 women were analyzed for iodine and other elements, such as arsenic and cadmium, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Anthropometric measurements at birth included weight, length, and head and chest circumference. Maternal urinary iodine concentrations (UICs) ranged from 0.020 to 10 mg/L, with a median of 0.30 mg/L. Below â¼1.0 mg/L, UIC was significantly positively associated with birth weight and length. Birth weight and length increased by 9.3 g (95% CI: 2.9, 16) and 0.042 cm (95% CI: 0.0066, 0.076), respectively, for each 0.1-mg/L increase in maternal UIC. No associations were observed between UIC and head or chest circumference. When we stratified the analyses by newborn sex, the positive associations between maternal UIC (<1 mg/L) and measurements of size at birth were restricted to boys, with no evidence in girls. Among boys, the mean weight, length, and head circumference increased by 70 g (P = 0.019), 0.41 cm (P = 0.013), and 0.28 cm (P = 0.031) for every 0.5-mg/L increase in maternal UIC. Maternal iodine status was positively associated with weight, length, and head circumference in boys up to â¼1 mg/L, which is well above the recommended maximum concentration of 0.5 mg/L. The associations leveled off at UIC â¥ 1 mg/L. Our findings support previous conclusions that the advantages of correcting potential iodine deficiency outweigh the risks of excess exposure.

The early identification of Low birth weight (LBW) neonates is essential for any comprehensive initiative to improve their chance of survival. However, a large proportion of births in developing countries take place at home and birth weight statistics are not available. Therefore, there is a need to develop simple, inexpensive and practical methods to identify low birth weight (LBW) neonates soon after birth. This is a hospital based cross sectional study. Four hundred twenty two (422) live born neonates were included and anthropometric measurements were carried out within 24Â h of birth by three trained nurses. Birth weight was measured by digital scale. Head and chest circumference were measured by using non extendable measuring tape and foot length with hard transparent plastic ruler. Data was entered into SPSS version 20 for analysis. Characteristics of study participants were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequency and percentage for categorical data and mean and standard deviation for continuous data. Correlation with birth weight using Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression were used to identify the association between dependent and independent variables. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate accuracy of the anthropometric measurements to predict LBW. The prevalence of low birth weight was found to be 27%. All anthropometric measurements had a positive correlation with birth weight, chest circumference attaining the highest correlation with birth weight (râ=â0.85) and foot length had the weakest correlation (râ=â0.74). Head circumference had the highest predictive value for birth weight (AUCâ=â0.93) followed by Chest circumference (AUCâ=â0.91). A cut off point of chest circumference 30.15Â cm had 84.2% sensitivity, 85.4% specificity and diagnostic accuracy (Pâ<â0.001).

Although Lubchencoâs references are still used in many neonatal care units, we believe that there is a need for up-to-date intrauterine growth references specific for different populations. To develop gestational age-and gender-specific national references for birth weight, birth length and head circumference. Methods: Data were collected from neonatal records of perinatology services of eleven hospitals from January to December 2009. The anthropometry of a total of 4750 singleton live births born between 28 and 41 weeks of gestation were recorded. Means and standard deviations were calculated, and percentiles for each gender and gestational week were produced using the LMS program. The results were compared with US infants and also with local data. Results: Gestational age- and gender-specific 3rd, 5th, 10th, 15th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 85th, 90th, 95th and 97th percentile values were produced. Comparison of the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile values showed that the boys were heavier and longer than the girls. Head circumference values were also higher in the boys. Proportions of small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) infants in the sample were 10.1%, 79.1% and 10.8%, respectively. Conclusion: These gender- and gestational age-specific references will be of use in clinical practice and also for research purposes until more comprehensive, reliable and accessible national data pertaining to the intrauterine growth of Turkish infants are produced.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Zona da Mata, Pernambuco State, Brazil, with 915 term infants. Infants' anthropometric measurements and data on prenatal care, smoking during pregnancy, family income, and maternal schooling and nutritional status were collected in the first 24 hours after birth. Infants were classified as proportionate (weight/head circumference ratio â¥ 0.90) versus disproportionate (< 0.90). Lower mean weight/head circumference ratio was associated with maternal smoking, younger age, inadequate prenatal care, and low BMI, height, and triceps skinfold thickness. Mean weight, length, head and chest circumference, arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness were lower among infants with disproportionate weight/head circumference ratio, independently of sex. In conclusion, weight/head circumference ratio and birth weight are important indicators of fetal growth.\n\nBirth weight, length and head circumference: Progression and impact over the outcome of patients with congenital heart disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilveira, DaniÃ©lle Bernardi; da Rosa, Ernani Bohrer; Correia, Jamile Dutra; Trevisan, PatrÃ­cia; Fiegenbaum, Marilu; Oliveira, Ceres AndrÃ©ia; Grapiglia, Carolina Geitens; Nunes, Mauricio Rouvel; Rosa, Rosana Cardoso Manique; Zen, Tatiana Diehl; Zen, Paulo Ricardo Gazzola; Rosa, Rafael Fabiano Machado\n\n2017-09-15\n\nThere are few studies assessing the birth measures of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Our aim to evaluate their progression and impact over the outcome. The cases consisted of patients with CHD during their first hospitalization in a reference cardiac and pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) from Southern Brazil. Controls were composed of patients with no clinical evidence of CHD hospitalized soon after cases. The cases underwent high-resolution karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 22q11 microdeletion. We analyzed birth weight, length and head circumference of patients of both groups. For CHD patients, we evaluated their progression and impact until hospitalization at ICU. Our sample was composed of 198 cases and controls. We observe a difference in birth weight of CHD patients only in relation to general population. There was a significant increase in children with CHD and weight below the lower limit from birth until the hospitalization at ICU, and this occurred more in those without complex CHD. Syndromic patients and with an extracardiac malformation also presented a greater difficulty to maintain not only the weight but also the length/height until the hospitalization. Individuals with weight below the lower limit at hospitalization who died had a tendency to present longer stay at ICU. Some CHD patients, especially without complex defects, and with syndromic aspect and a major extracardiac malformation, present a higher difficult to maintain their weight and growth, and, therefore, may be at risk and should be more closely monitored.

Times series were constructed of births, weight and length at birth, and low weight and length at birth. The trend was modelled with linear and logistical regressions using splines to represent breaks in the trend by decade. The series includes 17,574 births. There was an increase in births per year in the 1970s (30/year) and declines in them to 17 and 22 births/year in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively (P<.001), with no significant trend thereafter. Newborns from 2000 to 2011 weighed 266 grams more than those in the 1970s (P<.001), and have now reached a mean weight of 3,530 g. Low birthweight fell from 8% in the 1970s to 1.1% after 2000. Birth length increased by 1cm in the 37 years studied, with a reduction of low birth length from 7.6% to 2.1% during the period. Live births in the Limache Hospital declined, and anthropometric measurements at birth improved in the years analysed. This information is useful in developing interventions, taking into account the possible selection biases that could distort these estimates and their interpretation.

To assess neonatal SPL on the basis of gestational maturity and anthropometric parameters at birth. A cross-sectional observational study of SPL was conducted on stable newborns at a referral teaching hospital in north India between January and June 2012. Gestational maturity, SPL and anthropometric parameters (weight, length, head circumference and foot length) were recorded within 24 hours of birth. Variation of SPL in relation to gestational age and anthropometric parameters were evaluated using multiple linear regression models. The equation using lower confidence limits of 95% confidence intervals for the correlation coefficients provides cut-off points to define a small penis. Data from 1249 newborns demonstrated that penile growth follows the pattern of increase in body dimensions in newborns. SPL can be predicted best in relation to body and foot length taken together. SPL should be interpreted in relation to anthropometric parameters in newborns, particularly body and foot length.\n\nGenetic Mutations, Birth Lengths, Weights and Head Circumferences of Children with IGF-I Receptor Defects. Comparison with other Congenital Defects in the GH/IGF-I axis.\n\nPubMed\n\nEssakow, Jenna Lee; Lauterpacht, Aharon; Lilos, Pearl; Kauli, Rivka; Laron, Zvi\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIn recent years more and more genetic defects along the GHRH-GH-IGF-I axis have been reported. Mutations of the IGF-I receptor (R) are a rare abnormality of whom only the heterozygote progenies survive. To summarize, from the literature, data on birth length, weight and head circumference of neonates with IGF-I-R mutations, and to correlate the data with that of other types of mutations in the GH/IGF-I axis. Sixty seven neonates from 24 published articles were included and forty seven different mutations of the IGF-I (R) located on chromosome 15 have been identified. Mean (Â±SD) birth length (BL), available for 26, (10 M, 16F) neonates with a gestational age of 34-41weeks, was 44.2Â±4cm; one was premature (30cm at 31 weeks). There was a significant correlation between birth length and gestational age (GA) r=0.71 (p>.001). Mean birth weight (BW) of 41 neonates (18M, 23F) was 2388Â±743gr. Two premature neonates weighed 650gr and 950gr respectively. The BW correlated significantly with gestational age, (males: r=0.68; p=0.007, females: r=0.49; p=0.024). The BMI of 25 neonates ranged from 6 to 13. In 22 records marked microcephaly was ascertained or stated. Nine of 16 mothers were short (133 -148cm), mÂ±SD = 150.5Â±7.3cm.

However, incense smoke contains particulate matter and gas products such as carbon monoxide, sulfur, and nitrogen dioxide, which are potentially harmful to health. We analyzed the relationship between prenatal incense burning and birth weight and head circumference at birth using the Taiwan Birth Cohort Study. We also analyzed whether the associations varied by sex and along the distribution of birth outcomes. We performed ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regressions analysis on a sample of 15,773 term births (> 37 gestational weeks; 8,216 boys and 7,557 girls) in Taiwan in 2005. The associations were estimated separately for boys and girls as well as for the population as a whole. We controlled extensively for factors that may be correlated with incense burning and birth weight and head circumference, such as parental religion, demographics, and health characteristics, as well as pregnancy-related variables. Findings from fully adjusted OLS regressions indicated that exposure to incense was associated with lower birth weight in boys (-18 g; 95% CI: -36, -0.94) but not girls (1 g; 95% CI: -17, 19; interaction p-value = 0.31). Associations with head circumference were negative for boys (-0.95 mm; 95% CI: -1.8, -0.16) and girls (-0.71 mm; 95% CI: -1.5, 0.11; interaction p-values = 0.73). Quantile regression results suggested that the negative associations were larger among the lower quantiles of birth outcomes. OLS regressions showed that prenatal incense burning was associated with lower birth weight for boys and smaller head circumference for boys and girls. The associations were more pronounced among the lower quantiles of birth outcomes. Further research is necessary to confirm whether incense burning has differential effects by sex.

These low-birth weight newborns are at increased risk of neonatal morbidity such as hypoxia and hypoglycaemia. In later life, they are at higher risk of several age-related diseases such as cardiovascularÂ and metabolic disorders and dementia. As having short telomeres is also associated with these diseases, we tested if these newborns might already start with shorter telomeres at birth. Relative telomere lengths were determined using quantitative real-time PCR in cord blood samples from 195 newborns of Chinese ancestry. Based on the telomere length normalised to a single copy gene and a reference DNA sample as internal control, we found statistically significant correlations between relative telomere length and both unadjusted and gestational age-adjusted birth weight, with the lighter newborns having shorter telomeres. The SGA birth weight group comprising the bottom 10% of the samples also had the shortest telomeres compared to the medium and heaviest birth weight groups. Our results indicate that there is reduction of cord blood telomere length for newborns with lower birth weight.\n\nAccuracy of birth certificate head circumference measurements: Massachusetts, 2012-2013.\n\nPubMed\n\nSomerville, Nicholas J; Chen, Xiaoli; Heinke, Dominique; Stone, Sarah L; Higgins, Cathleen; Manning, Susan E; Pagnano, Sharon; Yazdy, Mahsa M; Anderka, Marlene\n\n2018-03-15\n\nZika virus has recently emerged as a novel cause of microcephaly. CDC has asked states to rapidly ascertain and report cases of Zika-linked birth defects, including microcephaly. Massachusetts added head circumference to its birth certificate (BC) in 2011. The accuracy of head circumference measurements from state vital records data has not been reported. We sought to assess the accuracy of Massachusetts BC head circumference measurements by comparing them to measurements for 2,217 infants born during 2012-2013 captured in the Massachusetts Birth Defects Monitoring Program (BDMP) data system. BDMP contains information abstracted directly from infant medical records and served as the true head circumference value (i.e., gold standard) for analysis. We calculated the proportion of head circumference measurements in agreement between the BC and BDMP data. We assigned growth chart head circumference percentile categories to each BC and BDMP measurement, and calculated the sensitivity and specificity of BC-based categories to predict BDMP-based categories. No difference was found in head circumference measurements between the two sources in 77.9% (nâ=â1,727) of study infants. The sensitivity of BC-based head circumference percentile categories ranged from 85.6% (<3rd percentile) to 92.7% (â¥90th percentile) and the specificity ranged from 97.6% (â¥90th percentile) to 99.3% (<3rd percentile). BC head circumference measurements agreed with those abstracted from the medical chart the majority of the time. Head circumference measurements on the BC were more specific than sensitive across all standardized growth chart percentile categories.

To highlight the occurrence of non-birth trauma related neonatal head injury, and evaluate the causes and outcome of treatment. A 3 year retrospective review of neonatal patients with head injury from two tertiary hospitals in South-East Nigeria between July 2009 and June 2012 (n-37). Data was collected from patients' birth and medical records. Data was analyzed using the SPSS version 15. Among the one hundred and seventy-six cases (11.78)% pediatric head injury cases seen, thirty seven (2.48)% occurred in neonatal patients. The most common cause of head injury was fall 22 cases [59.5%]. Children of mothers with low educational qualification were more likely to sustain falls 22 cases (59.5%). Road traffic accident (n = 15) was associated with more severe injuries and poorer outcome. Operative treatment was associated with increased mortality (two of three cases). The mortality rate in our series is 8.10%. Reduction of neonatal head trauma could be achieved through improved maternal education.\n\nThe influence of birth size on intelligence in healthy children.\n\nPubMed\n\nBroekman, Birit F P; Chan, Yiong-Huak; Chong, Yap-Seng; Quek, Swee-Chye; Fung, Daniel; Low, Yen-Ling; Ooi, Yoon-Phaik; Gluckman, Peter D; Meaney, Michael J; Wong, Tien-Yin; Saw, Seang-Mei\n\n2009-06-01\n\nBirth parameters have been hypothesized to have an influence on IQ. However, studies within the range of normal birth size have been sparse. With this study we examined the associations between birth length, birth weight, head circumference, and gestational age within the normal birth size range in relation to childhood IQ in Asian children. A cohort of 1979 of 2913 Asian children aged 7 to 9 years, recruited from 3 schools in Singapore, were followed yearly from 1999 onward. Birth parameters were recorded by health personnel. Childhood IQ was measured with the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices at ages 8 to 12. The mean IQ score across the sample (n = 1645) was 114.2. After controlling for multiple confounders for every 1-cm increment in birth length, 1 kg in birth weight, or 1 cm in head circumference, there was a corresponding increase in IQ of 0.49 points (P for trend < .001), 2.19 points (P for trend = .007) and .62 points (P for trend = .003), respectively. These associations persisted even after exclusion of premature children and children with extreme weights and head circumferences. Longer birth length, higher birth weight, or larger head circumferences within the normal birth size range are associated with higher IQ scores in Asian children. Our results suggest that antenatal factors reflected in altered rates of growth but within the normative range of pregnancy experiences play a role in generating cognitive potential. This has implications for targeting early intervention and preventative programs.\n\nSmall head circumference at birth and early age at adiposity rebound.\n\nPubMed\n\nEriksson, J G; Kajantie, E; Lampl, M; Osmond, C; Barker, D J P\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe adiposity rebound is the age in childhood when body mass index is at a minimum before increasing again. The age at rebound is highly variable. An early age is associated with increased obesity in later childhood and adult life. We have reported that an early rebound is predicted by low weight gain between birth and 1 year of age and resulting low body mass index at 1 year. Here, we examine whether age at adiposity rebound is determined by influences during infancy or is a consequence of foetal growth. Our hypothesis was that measurements of body size at birth are related to age at adiposity rebound. Longitudinal study of 2877 children born in Helsinki, Finland, during 1934-1944. Early age at adiposity rebound was associated with small head circumference and biparietal diameter at birth, but not with other measurements of body size at birth. The mean age at adiposity rebound rose from 5.8 years in babies with a head circumference of â¤33 cm to 6.2 in babies with a head circumference of >36 cm (P for trend = 0.007). The association between thinness in infancy and early rebound became apparent at 6 months of age. It was not associated with adverse living conditions. In a simultaneous regression, small head circumference at birth, high mother's body mass index and tall maternal stature each had statistically significant trends with early adiposity rebound (P = 0.002, <0.001, 0.004). We hypothesize that the small head size at birth that preceded an early adiposity rebound was the result of inability to sustain a rapid intra-uterine growth trajectory initiated in association with large maternal body size. This was followed by catch-up growth in infancy, and we hypothesize that this depleted the infant's fat stores. Â© 2013 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

Few studies have investigated the contribution of maternal vitamin A deficiency to these outcomes. In rural northwestern Bangladesh, we examined the effects of weekly antenatal vitamin A and Î²-carotene supplementation on birth weight, length, circumferential body measures, and length of gestation. With the use of a cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled trial design, pregnant women were enrolled in the first trimester and began receiving their allocated supplements (vitamin A, Î²-carotene, or placebo) weekly until 3 mo postpartum. Birth anthropometric measures were made at home. Of 13,709 newborns whose birth weight was measured within 72 h of birth, mean (Â±SD) weight was 2.44 Â± 0.42 kg, the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) was 54.4%, and that of small-for-gestational age (SGA) was 70.5%. Birth weight, length, and chest, head, and arm circumferences did not differ between supplementation and placebo groups nor did rates of LBW and SGA. Mean gestational age at birth was 38.3 Â± 2.9 wk, and 25.6% of births occurred before 37 wk. Neither gestational age nor preterm birth rate differed with vitamin A or Î²-carotene supplementation. In this rural South Asian population with a high burden of LBW and preterm birth but modest levels of maternal vitamin A deficiency, antenatal vitamin A or Î²-carotene supplementation did not benefit these birth outcomes. Other nutritional and nonnutritional interventions should be examined to reduce risks of these adverse outcomes in rural South Asia. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00198822.\n\nInfant head circumference growth is saltatory and coupled to length growth.\n\nPubMed\n\nLampl, Michelle; Johnson, Michael L\n\n2011-05-01\n\nRapid growth rates of head circumference and body size during infancy have been reported to predict developmental pathologies that emerge during childhood. This study investigated whether growth in head circumference was concordant with growth in body length. Forty infants (16 males) were followed between the ages of 2 days and 21 months for durations ranging from 4 to 21 months (2616 measurements). Longitudinal anthropometric measurements were assessed weekly (n=12), semi-weekly (n=24) and daily (n=4) during home visits. Individual head circumference growth was investigated for the presence of saltatory patterns. Coincident analysis tested the null hypothesis that head growth was randomly coupled to length growth. Head circumference growth during infancy is saltatory (p<0.05), characterized by median increments of 0.20 cm (95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.30 cm) in 24-h, separated by intervals of no growth ranging from 1 to 21 days. Daily assessments identified that head growth saltations were coupled to length growth saltations within a median time frame of 2 days (interquartile 0-4, range 1-8 days). Assessed at semi-weekly and weekly intervals, an average 82% (SD 0.13) of head growth saltations was non-randomly concordant with length growth (pâ¤0.006). Normal infant head circumference grows by intermittent, episodic saltations that are temporally coupled to growth in total body length by a process of integrated physiology that remains to be described.

However, few studies demonstrate the interaction effects of maternal/paternal smoking, and birth outcomes other than birth weight have not been evaluated. The present study examined individual effects of maternal/paternal smoking and their interactions on birth outcomes. A follow-up hospital-based study from pregnancy to delivery was conducted from 1997 to 2010 with parents and newborn infants who delivered at a large hospital in Hamamatsu, Japan. The relationships between smoking and growth were evaluated with logistic regression. The individual effects of maternal smoking are related to low birth weight (LBW), short birth length and small head circumference. The individual effects of paternal smoking are related to short birth length and small head circumference. In the adjusted model, both parents' smoking showed clear associations with LBW (odds ratio [OR] = 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-2.27) and short birth length (-1 standard deviation [SD] OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.07-1.79; -2 SD OR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.84-4.10). Maternal smoking was significantly associated with birth weight and length, but paternal smoking was not. However, if both parents smoked, the risk of shorter birth length increased.

A structural equation analysis of Filipino infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nBollen, Kenneth A; Noble, Mark D; Adair, Linda S\n\n2013-07-30\n\nThe fetal origins hypothesis emphasizes the life-long health impacts of prenatal conditions. Birth weight, birth length, and gestational age are indicators of the fetal environment. However, these variables often have missing data and are subject to random and systematic errors caused by delays in measurement, differences in measurement instruments, and human error. With data from the Cebu (Philippines) Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, we use structural equation models, to explore random and systematic errors in these birth outcome measures, to analyze how maternal characteristics relate to birth outcomes, and to take account of missing data. We assess whether birth weight, birth length, and gestational age are influenced by a single latent variable that we call favorable fetal growth conditions (FFGC) and if so, which variable is most closely related to FFGC. We find that a model with FFGC as a latent variable fits as well as a less parsimonious model that has birth weight, birth length, and gestational age as distinct individual variables. We also demonstrate that birth weight is more reliably measured than is gestational age. FFGCs were significantly influenced by taller maternal stature, better nutritional stores indexed by maternal arm fat and muscle area during pregnancy, higher birth order, avoidance of smoking, and maternal age 20-35âyears. Effects of maternal characteristics on newborn weight, length, and gestational age were largely indirect, operating through FFGC.

Between 1985 and 2005, average increases in body weight (BW), body length (BL), ponderal index (PI), and head circumference (HC) of newborns were statistically significant: 107g, 0.2cm, 0.6kg/m(3) and 0.4cm, respectively. The relative increase in BW was more than that in BL (3.4% vs 0.4%) in the last two decades, leading to an increase in PI. The distribution of birth size shifted slightly to the right, and the proportion of macrosomia increased from 3.2% in 1985 to 3.4% in 1995 and to 4.3% in 2005. The increases in BW and PI and the increase in rate of macrosomia are concerns from public health perspectives. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the horse, long day photoperiod influences the onset of ovulation and cyclicity, shedding of the heavier winter coat and the timing of parturition. In this compilation of studies, conducted across three breeding seasons and two countries, the impact of artificially extended day length was investigated on gestation length, foal birth weight and foal hair coat at birth. The light therapy was administered to pre-partum mares via mobile head worn masks which provided short wavelength blue light to a single eye. In Study 1, reductions in gestation lengths were observed following administration of artificially extended day length (124.8Â Â±Â 15.11 days) in the final months of pregnancy to a group of Thoroughbred mares compared to controls (PÂ <Â 0.05; 339.7Â Â±Â 9.56 days vs 350.6Â Â±Â 9.13). Study 2 revealed that pre-partum exposure to artificially extended day length (104.6Â Â±Â 9.89 days) increased foal birth weight compared to controls (47.13Â Â±Â 2.93Â kg vs 43.51Â Â±Â 6.14Â kg; PÂ <Â 0.05) in mares bred early in the year. In Study 3, artificially extended day length (87.53Â Â±Â 19.6 days) administered to pre-partum mares affected the coat condition of foals at birth with respect to hair weight (PÂ <Â 0.0001) and hair length (PÂ <Â 0.0001) compared to controls (0.34Â Â±Â 0.20Â Î¼g vs 0.59Â Â±Â 0.12Â Î¼g and 1.93Â Â±Â 0.56Â cm vs 2.56Â Â±Â 0.32Â cm, respectively). Collectively, these studies serve to highlight the influential role of the circa-annual changes in photoperiod length on the pre-partum mare for normal foetal development during the natural breeding season. It also emphasizes the potential that exists to improve breeding efficiency parameters by artificially simulating this important environmental cue in the latter stages of gestation against the backdrop of an economically driven early breeding season.

Previous studies of head circumference in pre-schizophrenia were limited to measures at birth. The use of growth acceleration of head circumference (defined as the rate of change in head circumference) provides a more informative representation of the maturational landscape of this measure compared to studies based on static head circumference measures. To date, however, no study has examined whether HC growth acceleration differs between pre-schizophrenia cases and controls. In the present study, we employed a nested case control design of a national birth cohort in Finland.

Longitudinal data were obtained on head circumference from birth through age 1. Data were analyzed using a new nonparametric Bayesian inversion method which allows for a detailed understanding of growth dynamics. Adjusting for growth velocity of height and weight, and gestational age, there was significantly accelerated growth of head circumference in females with schizophrenia from birth to 2 months; the findings remained significant following Bonferroni correction (p < 0.0125).

The thrifty phenotype hypothesis assumes that reduced fetal growth impacts some organs more than others. However, it remains unclear how birth weight relates to different body components, such as circumferences, adiposity, body segment lengths and limb proportions. We hypothesized that these components vary in their relationship to birth weight. We analysed the relationship between birth weight and detailed anthropometry in 1270 singleton live-born neonates (668 male) from the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (Brisbane, Australia). We tested adjusted anthropometry for correlations with birth weight. We then performed stepwise multiple regression on birth weight of: body lengths, breadths and circumferences; relative limb to neck-rump proportions; or skinfold thicknesses. All analyses were adjusted for sex and gestational age, and used logged data. Circumferences, especially chest, were most strongly related to birth weight, while segment lengths (neck-rump, thigh, upper arm, and especially lower arm and lower leg) were relatively weakly related to birth weight, and limb lengths relative to neck-rump length showed no relationship. Skinfolds accounted for 36% of birth weight variance, but adjusting for size (neck-rump, thigh and upper arm lengths, and head circumference), this decreased to 10%. There was no evidence that heavier babies had proportionally thicker skinfolds. Neonatal body measurements vary in their association with birth weight: head and chest circumferences showed the strongest associations while limb segment lengths did not relate strongly to birth weight. After adjusting for body size, subcutaneous fatness accounted for a smaller proportion of birth weight variance than previously reported. While heavier babies had absolutely thicker skinfolds, this was proportional to their size.

Skinfolds accounted for 36% of birth weight variance, but adjusting for size (neck-rump, thigh and upper arm lengths, and head circumference), this decreased to 10%. There was no evidence that heavier babies had proportionally thicker skinfolds. Conclusions Neonatal body measurements vary in their association with birth weight: head and chest circumferences showed the strongest associations while limb segment lengths did not relate strongly to birth weight. After adjusting for body size, subcutaneous fatness accounted for a smaller proportion of birth weight variance than previously reported. While heavier babies had absolutely thicker skinfolds, this was proportional to their size.

The study purpose was to compare the sociodemographic characteristics and readiness for discharge of new mothers and their newborns at 3 discharge time intervals, and to determine which variables were associated with postpartum length of stay. The study sample comprised 1,192 mothers who were discharged within 2 postpartum days after uncomplicated vaginal birth at a tertiary perinatal center in the midwestern United States. The sample was divided into 3 postpartum length-of-stay groups: group 1 (18-30 hr), group 2 (31-42 hr), and group 3 (43-54 hr). Sociodemographic and readiness-for-discharge data were collected by self-report and from a computerized hospital information system. Measures of readiness for discharge included perceived readiness (single item and Readiness for Discharge After Birth Scale), documented maternal and neonatal clinical problems, and feeding method. Compared with other groups, the longest length-of-stay group was older; of higher socioeconomic status and education; and with more primiparous, breastfeeding, white, married mothers who were living with the baby's father, had adequate home help, and had a private payor source. This group also reported greater readiness for discharge, but their newborns had more documented clinical problems during the postbirth hospitalization. In logistic regression modeling, earlier discharge was associated with young age, multiparity, public payor source, low socioeconomic status, lack of readiness for discharge, bottle-feeding, and absence of a neonatal clinical problem. Sociodemographic characteristics and readiness for discharge (clinical and perceived) were associated with length of postpartum hospital stay. Length of stay is an outcome of a complex interface between patient, provider, and payor influences on discharge timing\n\nShort-term growth in head circumference and its relationship with supine length in healthy infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaino, Silvia; Kelmansky, Diana; Adamo, Paula; Lejarraga, Horacio\n\n2010-01-01\n\nDaily changes in height have been found to be a non-linear process. Its exact pattern is still controversial. In previous studies on 34 healthy children aged 0.32-12.99 years, we found that growth is a tri-phasic process: stasis, steep changes (or saltation) and continuous growth. There is very little information in the literature about daily changes in head circumference. The present study analysed growth in head circumference and supine length in eight healthy infants. Supine length and head circumference was measured five times a week during 151 days. Mean intra-observer technical error of measurement (TEM) for head circumference and supine length were 0.10 and 0.15 cm, respectively; smoothing techniques used were based on the TEM with a hard rejection criterion. The three types of events previously found in supine length are also present in head circumference. The number of steep changes was greater in supine length than in head circumference. Growth is a discontinuous and irregular process, present not only in long bones but also in skull bones. Although long-term growth curves of head circumference and supine length are different, when measured on a daily basis findings suggest that skull and long bones have a common pattern; the physiological basis needs future research.\n\nFree testosterone levels in umbilical-cord blood predict infant head circumference in females.\n\nPubMed\n\nWhitehouse, Andrew J O; Maybery, Murray T; Hart, Roger; Sloboda, Deborah M; Stanley, Fiona J; Newnham, John P; Hickey, Martha\n\n2010-03-01\n\nFetal androgens influence fetal growth as well as postnatal neurocognitive ability. However, to our knowledge, no published study has prospectively examined the impact of early-life androgens on infant brain growth. We report the association between circulating fetal androgen levels, measured from umbilical-cord blood at birth, and a proxy measure of brain growth: head circumference. Participants were 82 unselected female infants from a large representative birth cohort (mean gestational age 39.4 wks, SD 1.7). Umbilical-cord blood was obtained at birth and analysed for androgen concentrations (total testosterone, androstenedione, dehyrdroepiandrosterone, and its sulphated metabolite). Head circumference and two other measures of growth - weight (mean 3311.4 g, SD 461.3) and length - were measured within 3 days of birth and again at approximately 1 year of age (mean age 13.1 mo, SD 1.1). Multivariate linear regressions found an inverse association between levels of free testosterone and growth in head circumference (correlation=-.24), even when adjusting for sociodemographic/obstetric covariates and head size at birth. Growth in weight and length could not be predicted by free testosterone concentration. This is the first report of an association between prenatal androgen levels and postnatal growth in head circumference. These findings suggest that early-life androgens may impact brain development during infancy.\n\nHead circumference, leg length and its association with dementia among older adult population in Singapore.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Sherilyn; Ong, Hui Lin; Abdin, Edimansyah; Vaingankar, Janhavi Ajit; Jeyagurunathan, Anitha; Shafie, Saleha; Mahendran, Rathi; Subramaniam, Mythily; Chong, Siow Ann\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHead circumference and leg length serve as reliable proxy indicators of early-life environment. Research studies have shown that these anthropometric measurements are associated with cognitive impairment and dementia among older adults. The aim of the present study was to assess the associations between dementia with head circumference and leg length among the older adult population in Singapore. This study also aimed to examine the sociodemographic correlates of these anthropometric measurements. Data were collected from 2565 older adults aged 60âyears and above, in a population study on the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly. Head circumference and leg length measurements were obtained, and sociodemographic information was recorded. Dementia diagnosis was made using the 10/66 dementia algorithm. Anthropometric measurements were first stratified into quarters, and then logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with head circumference and leg length, as well as to examine the association between dementia with these measurements. Sociodemographic correlates of head circumference and leg length include age, gender, ethnicity and education level. Smaller head circumference was independently associated with higher odds of 10/66 dementia (ORâ=â2.173-2.709). When the regression analysis was stratified by gender, the association was found only in the male sample. Leg length was not significantly associated with dementia after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Smaller head circumference is independently associated with dementia among older adults in Singapore. Findings from this study suggest that risk factors for dementia begin their influence in early life. Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

BIRTH COHORT STUDY IN POLAND\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJedrychowski, Wieslaw; Perera, Frederica P.; Tang, Deliang; Stigter, Laura; Mroz, Elzbieta; Flak, Elzbieta; Spengler, John; Budzyn-Mrozek, Dorota; Kaim, Irena; Jacek, Ryszard\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe previously reported an association between prenatal exposure to airborne PAH and lower birth weight, birth length and head circumference. The main goal of the present analysis was to assess the possible impact of co-exposure to PAH-containing of barbecued meat consumed during pregnancy on birth outcomes. The birth cohort consisted of 432 pregnant women who gave birth at term (>36 weeks of gestation). Only non-smoking women with singleton pregnancies, 18-35 years of age, and who were free from chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension were included in the study. Detailed information on diet over pregnancy was collected through interviews and the measurement of exposure to airborne PAHs was carried out by personal air monitoring during the second trimester of pregnancy. The effect of barbecued meat consumption on birth outcomes (birthweight, length and head circumference at birth) was adjusted in multiple linear regression models for potential confounding factors such as prenatal exposure to airborne PAHs, childâs sex, gestational age, parity, size of mother (maternal prepregnancy weight, weight gain in pregnancy) and prenatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The multivariable regression model showed a significant deficit in birthweight associated with barbecued meat consumption in pregnancy (coeff = â106.0 g; 95%CI: â293.3, â35.8); The effect of exposure to airborne PAHs was about the same magnitude order (coeff. = â164.6 g; 95%CI: â172.3, â 34.7). Combined effect of both sources of exposure amounted to birth weight deficit of 214.3 g (95%CI: â419.0, â 9.6). Regression models performed for birth length and head circumference showed similar trends but the estimated effects were of borderline significance level. As the intake of barbecued meat did not affect the duration of pregnancy, the reduced birthweight could not have been mediated by shortened gestation period. In conclusion, the study results provided epidemiologic evidence that\n\nPaternal age at birth is an important determinant of offspring telomere length.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Meyer, Tim; Rietzschel, Ernst R; De Buyzere, Marc L; De Bacquer, Dirk; Van Criekinge, Wim; De Backer, Guy G; Gillebert, Thierry C; Van Oostveldt, Patrick; Bekaert, Sofie\n\n2007-12-15\n\nAlthough evidence supports the function of telomere length (TL) as a marker for biological aging, no major determinants of TL are known besides inheritance, age and gender. Here we validate and, more importantly, assess the impact of paternal age at birth as a determinant for the offspring's peripheral blood leukocyte TL within the Asklepios study population. Telomere restriction fragment length and paternal age information were available for 2433 volunteers (1176 men and 1257 women) aged approximately 35-55 years old. Paternal age at birth was positively associated with offspring TL (offspring age and gender adjusted, P < 10 (-14)). The increase in TL was estimated at 17 base pairs for each supplemental year at birth and was not statistically different between male and female offspring. The effect size of paternal age outweighed the classical TL determinant gender by a factor of 2, demonstrating the large impact. Maternal age at birth was not independently associated with offspring TL. The peculiar interaction between paternal age at birth and inheritance might explain a large part of the genetic component of TL variance on a population level. This finding also provides further proof for the theory that TL is not completely reset in the zygote. Furthermore, as paternal age is subject to demographic evolution, its association with TL might have a substantial impact on the results and comparability of TL within and between epidemiological studies. In conclusion, paternal age is an important determinant for TL, with substantial consequences for future studies.\n\nPost term dietary-induced changes in DHA and AA status relate to gains in weight, length, and head circumference in preterm infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan de Lagemaat, Monique; Rotteveel, Joost; Muskiet, Frits A J; Schaafsma, Anne; Lafeber, Harrie N\n\n2011-12-01\n\nPreterms need supplementation with docosahexaenoic (DHA) and arachidonic (AA) acids to prevent steep postnatal declines. Associations between growth and erythrocyte (RBC) DHA and AA were studied in 139 preterms (51% male, gestational age 30.3Â±1.5 weeks, birth weight 1341Â±288g) fed human milk with breast milk fortifier or preterm formula until term, followed by postdischarge formula (PDF; n=52, 0.4% DHA, 0.4% AA), term formula (TF; n=41, 0.2% DHA, 0.2% AA), or human milk (HM; n=46). At six months, PDF resulted in higher RBC-DHA than TF and HM, while RBC-AA was higher than TF, but similar to HM. There were no between-group differences in growth between term and six months. RHC-DHA related positively with gain in weight and length and negatively with gain in head circumference. RBC-AA related positively with gain in head circumference and negatively with gain in weight and length. In conclusion, PDF with higher DHA and AA than TF may promote postnatal growth of preterms.

On one hand, fish is a good source of protein, low in fat and a rich source of other nutrients all of which have presumably beneficial effects on developing embryos and fetuses. On the other hand, consumption of fish contaminated with environmental toxicants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been associated with decrements in gestation and birth size. Methods 2,716 infants born between 1986â1991 to participants of the New York State Angler Cohort Study were studied with respect to duration of maternal consumption of contaminated fish from Lake Ontario and its tributaries and gestation and birth size. Hospital delivery records (maternal and newborn) were obtained for 92% of infants for the ascertainment of gestation (weeks), birth size (weight, length, chest, and head circumference) and other known determinants of fetal growth (i.e., maternal parity, history of placental infarction, uterine bleeding, pregnancy loss or cigarette smoking and infant's race, sex and presence of birth defect). Duration of maternal fish consumption prior to the index infant's birth was categorized as: none; 1â2, 3â7, 8+ years, while birth weight (in grams), birth length (in centimeters), and head and chest circumference (in centimeters) were left as continuous variables in multiple linear regression models. Birth size percentiles, ponderal indices and head to chest circumference ratios were computed to further assess proportionality and birth size in relation to gestational age. Results Analysis of variance failed to identify significant mean differences in gestation or any measure of birth size in relation to duration of maternal lifetime fish consumption. Multiple linear regressions identified gestational age, male sex, number of daily cigarettes, parity and placental infarction, as significant determinants of birth\n\nHead circumference at birth and childhood developmental disorders in a nationwide cohort in Denmark.\n\nPubMed\n\nAagaard, Kristina; Bach, Cathrine Carlsen; Henriksen, Tine Brink; Larsen, RenÃ© Tidemand; Matthiesen, Niels BjerregÃ¥rd\n\n2018-06-08\n\nEarly markers of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may improve the understanding and early recognition of these disorders. We aimed to estimate the association between head circumference at birth, a measure of cerebral size at birth, and the risk of ADHD and ASD. We present a register-based cohort study of all Danish singletons born alive between 1997 and 2013. Cox proportional hazards regression was used for the statistical analyses. Sibling-matched analyses were performed to account for unmeasured confounding shared by siblings. The analyses included 986Â 909 new-borns. Compared to normocephalic children, microcephaly was associated with an increased risk of ADHD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12, 1.32). Macrocephaly was associated with a decreased risk of ADHD (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82, 0.99). Neither microcephaly nor macrocephaly were associated with ASD (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94, 1.19 and 1.03, 95% CI 0.90, 1.19). The largest difference was found within the normocephalic children. A head circumference at the lower limit of normocephaly compared to a head circumference at the upper limit was associated with an increased risk of ADHD (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.43, 1.63). The sibling analyses confirmed the increased risk of ADHD with decreasing head circumference in the normocephalic children. No other clear associations were present in the sibling analyses. Within normocephalic children, smaller head circumference at birth was associated with a higher risk of ADHD. Restricted foetal brain growth may be a risk factor for the development of ADHD but not ASD.

Pregnant women at 8-16 weeks of gestation were interviewed using a semi-quantitative questionnaire to assess sleep duration. Birth weight and birth length were measured by a midwife in the delivery room at birth; low birth weight (LBW) was defined as birth weight <2500Â g and small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as <10th customized centile. The average age of participants was 28.21Â Â±Â 3.38 years old. The mean sleep duration was 8.39Â Â±Â 1.13Â h/day. A total of 1290 women sleeping â¥9Â h/day, 1563 sleeping 8 to <9Â h/day, 550 sleeping 7 to <8Â h/day, and 164 sleeping <7Â h/day. Compared to the sleeping 8 to <9Â h/day group, birth length and birth weight of the sleeping <7Â h/day group decreased by 2.42Â mm (95% CI:Â -4.27,Â -0.58, pÂ =Â 0.010) and 42.70Â g (95% CI:Â -103.02, 17.62, pÂ =Â 0.165), respectively; and risk of LBW and SGA of the sleeping <7Â h/day group increased by 83% (95% CI: 0.59, 5.73, pÂ =Â 0.297) and 56% (95% CI: 0.84, 2.92, pÂ =Â 0.159), respectively; birth length of the sleeping <7Â h/day group was decreased more in male babies, and among mothers without a midday napping habit or with a history of abortion (all p for interaction <0.05). Shorter sleep duration in early pregnancy was associated with birth length. Our findings indicate that midday napping may be a protective factor for birth length among pregnant women with shorter sleep duration. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, Lilacs, and Medion (all from inception to June 30, 2015), bibliographies, Google scholar, and conference proceedings. Cohort or cross-sectional studies reporting on the predictive accuracy for preterm birth of changes in cervical length over time. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted the data. Summary receiver-operating characteristic curves, pooled sensitivities and specificities, and summary likelihood ratios were generated. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 7 provided data on singleton gestations (3374 women) and 8 on twin gestations (1024 women). Among women with singleton gestations, the shortening of cervical length over time had a low predictive accuracy for preterm birth at <37 and <35 weeks of gestation with pooled sensitivities and specificities, and summary positive and negative likelihood ratios ranging from 49% to 74%, 44% to 85%, 1.3 to 4.1, and 0.3 to 0.7, respectively. In women with twin gestations, the shortening of cervical length over time had a low to moderate predictive accuracy for preterm birth at <34, <32, <30, and <28 weeks of gestation with pooled sensitivities and specificities, and summary positive and negative likelihood ratios ranging from 47% to 73%, 84% to 89%, 3.8 to 5.3, and 0.3 to 0.6, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the predictive accuracies for preterm birth of cervical length shortening over time and the single initial and/or final cervical length measurement in 8 of 11 studies that provided data for making these comparisons. In the largest and highest-quality study, a single measurement of cervical length obtained at 24 or 28 weeks of gestation was significantly more predictive of preterm birth than any decrease in cervical length\n\nAction-oriented colour-coded foot length calliper for primary healthcare workers as a proxy for birth weight & gestational period.\n\nPubMed\n\nPratinidhi, Asha K; Bagade, Abhijit C; Kakade, Satish V; Kale, Hemangi P; Kshirsagar, Vinayak Y; Babar, Rohini; Bagal, Shilpa\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFoot length of the newborn has a good correlation with the birth weight and is recommended to be used as a proxy measure.

To evaluate the influence of length of antepartum hospital stay on maternal stress after the birth of a preterm infant. A prospective two-centre pilot case-control study was performed at two tertiary level Neonatal-Intensive-Care-Units (NICU). Mothers of preterm infants <36 +0 weeks of gestation admitted to the NICUs were included. The stress of mothers with length of antepartum hospital stay <12h (n=20) were case-matched and compared to that of mothers with length of antepartum hospital stay â¥12h (n=20). Maternal stress was assessed within three days after birth with the Parental-Stress-Scale:NICU (PSS:NICU) questionnaire measuring three scales: \"relationship and parental role\", \"sights and sounds\", and \"baby looks and behaves\". Maternal socio-demographic data were collected by questionnaire administered at the same time. Both groups of mothers had similar socio-demographic data. Stress scale of \"sights and sounds\" was significantly increased in mothers with antepartum stay â¥12h (2.48Â±0.69) compared to mothers with antepartum stay <12h (1.95Â±0.73) (p=0.024). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the \"looks and behaves\" (2.73Â±0.80 vs. 2.72Â±0.91; p=0.962) and \"relationship and parental role\" scales (3.31Â±1.08 vs. 3.58Â±1.18; p=0.484). Our study demonstrated higher levels of maternal stress after preterm birth in mothers, who had been admitted to hospital for longer periods of time before delivery. Interventional programmes starting in the antepartum period should be established in order to reduce the burden of stress and to improve parental-child interaction.

Its residues are found in the environment, major crops, and food items that humans, including pregnant women, consume daily. Since GLY exposure in pregnancy may also increase fetal exposure risk, we designed a birth-cohort study to determine exposure frequency, potential exposure pathways, and associations with fetal growth indicators and pregnancy length. Urine and residential drinking water samples were obtained from 71 women with singleton pregnancies living in Central Indiana while they received routine prenatal care. GLY measurements were performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Demographic and survey information relating to food and water consumption, stress, and residence were obtained by questionnaire. Maternal risk factors and neonatal outcomes were abstracted from medical records. Correlation analyses were used to assess relationships of urine GLY levels with fetal growth indicators and gestational length. The mean age of participants was 29Â years, and the majority were Caucasian. Ninety three percent of the pregnant women had GLY levels above the limit of detection (0.1Â ng/mL). Mean urinary GLY was 3.40Â ng/mL (range 0.5-7.20Â ng/mL). Higher GLY levels were found in women who lived in rural areas (pÂ =â0.02), and in those who consumed >â24Â oz. of caffeinated beverages per day (pÂ =â0.004). None of the drinking water samples had detectable GLY levels. We observed no correlations with fetal growth indicators such as birth weight percentile and head circumference. However, higher GLY urine levels were significantly correlated with shortened gestational lengths (râ=â-â0.28, pâ=â0.02). This is the first study of GLY exposure in US pregnant women using urine specimens as a direct measure of exposure. We found that >â90% of pregnant women had detectable GLY levels and that these levels\n\nRelationship between the surrogate anthropometric measures, foot length and chest circumference and birth weight among newborns of Sarlahi, Nepal.\n\nPubMed\n\nMullany, L C; Darmstadt, G L; Khatry, S K; Leclerq, S C; Tielsch, J M\n\n2007-01-01\n\nClassification of infants into low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g) or very low birth weight (VLBW, <2000 g) categories is a crucial step in targeting interventions to high-risk infants. To compare the validity of chest circumference and foot length as surrogate anthropometric measures for the identification of LBW and VLBW infants. Newborn infants (n=1640) born between March and June 2004 in 30 Village Development Committees of Sarlahi district, Nepal. Chest circumference, foot length and weight (SECA 727, precise to 2 g) of newborns were measured within 72 h after birth. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for a range of cutoff points of the anthropometric measures were estimated using the digital scale measurements as the gold standard. Among LBW infants (469/1640, 28.6%), chest circumference measures <30.3 cm were 91% sensitive and 83% specific. Similar levels of sensitivity for foot length were achieved only with considerable loss of specificity (<45%). Foot length measurements <6.9 cm were 88% sensitive and 86% specific for the identification of VLBW infants. Chest circumference was superior to foot length in classification of infants into birth weight categories. For the identification of VLBW infants, foot length performed well, and may be preferable to chest circumference, as the former measure does not require removal of infant swaddling clothes. In the absence of more precise direct measures of birth weight, chest circumference is recommended over foot length for the identification of LBW infants.\n\n[Nutritional status of pregnant women and birth outcome].\n\nPubMed\n\nKaim, Irena; Sochacka-Tatara, Elzbieta; Pac, Agnieszka; Basta, Antoni; Jedrychowski, WiesÅaw\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to determine whether nutritional status of pregnant women influences the birth outcome. A prospective study, conducted in Krakow, in 382 non-smoking, no obese pregnant women between the ages of 18 - 35. The course of pregnancy was uncomplicated, finished with natural labor, in biological time limits. The impact of mother's nutritional status before pregnancy and weight gain on newborns weight, length and head circumference was estimated by multivariate linear regression. The infant birth weight depended on mothers nutritional status before pregnancy and was lower in the group of underweight subjects (3381.6 g vs. 3479.9 g, p = 0.022). Women with low increase in body mass during pregnancy delivered newborns with lower anthropometrics parameters. The increase in body weight of one category resulted in statistically significant increase of birth weight by 140.9 g, increase of length by 0.51 cm and in head circumference by 0.27 cm. Increase in body mass during pregnancy is particularly important in the group of women underweight before pregnancy. Change of nutritional habits before and in the course of pregnancy may have beneficial effects for intrauterine fetal development.\n\nThe influence of birth weight and length on bone mineral density and content in adolescence: The TromsÃ¸ Study, Fit Futures.\n\nPubMed\n\nChristoffersen, Tore; Ahmed, Luai A; Daltveit, Anne Kjersti; Dennison, Elaine M; Evensen, Elin K; Furberg, Anne-Sofie; Gracia-Marco, Luis; Grimnes, Guri; Nilsen, Ole-Andreas; Schei, Berit; Tell, Grethe S; Vlachopoulos, Dimitris; Winther, Anne; Emaus, Nina\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe influence of birth weight and length on bone mineral parameters in adolescence is unclear. We found a positive association between birth size and bone mineral content, attenuated by lifestyle factors. This highlights the impact of environmental stimuli and lifestyle during growth. The influence of birth weight and length on bone mineral density and content later in life is unclear, especially in adolescence. This study evaluated the impact of birth weight and length on bone mineral density and content among adolescents. We included 961 participants from the population-based Fit Futures study (2010-2011). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to measure bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) at femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH) and total body (TB). BMD and BMC measures were linked with birth weight and length ascertained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Linear regression models were used to investigate the influence of birth parameters on BMD and BMC. Birth weight was positively associated with BMD-TB and BMC at all sites among girls; standardized Î² coefficients [95% CI] were 0.11 [0.01, 0.20] for BMD-TB and 0.15 [0.06, 0.24], 0.18 [0.09, 0.28] and 0.29 [0.20, 0.38] for BMC-FN, TH and TB, respectively. In boys, birth weight was positively associated with BMC at all sites with estimates of 0.10 [0.01, 0.19], 0.12 [0.03, 0.21] and 0.15 [0.07, 0.24] for FN, TH and TB, respectively. Corresponding analyses using birth length as exposure gave significantly positive associations with BMC at all sites in both sexes. The significant positive association between birth weight and BMC-TB in girls, and birth length and BMC-TB in boys remained after multivariable adjustment. We found a positive association between birth size and BMC in adolescence. However, this association was attenuated after adjustment for weight, height and physical activity during adolescence.\n\nPrenatal Exposure to Organophosphorous Pesticides and Fetal Growth: Pooled Results from Four Longitudinal Birth Cohort Studies.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarley,"
