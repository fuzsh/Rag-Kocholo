        "text": "She’s spent her life on the periphery of humanity.\n\nBree Geissenger lives by one mantra: You’re only as good as your latest creation. Tucked away in laboratories, always wanted for her brains, she’s been safe. Unseen. But the new life she has at The Arsenal has upended her carefully constructed world. Unable to cope with the threats against her friends, she fractured. Determined not to be the weakest link, she fled the safety of The Arsenal compound to heal. Regroup. Hunt.\n\nThose she loves will no longer be prey. She’ll ferret out everyone who’s a threat to those she loves, no matter the cost. There’s no sacrifice too great in war. A smart soldier doesn’t work alone, though, which means she must work with the operative she wants more than anything.\n\nHe ran from a past he’s swore to never delve into.\n\nRamon Zapata escaped the underground, clandestine world his parents deemed his birthright. Military life honed him into the weapon he swore to never become and gave him the only true family he’s ever known. Life at The Arsenal was everything he’d wanted, including the brilliant, beautiful scientist who blew his world wide open. To save his new family and the woman he loves, he must reconcile his past and work with the black ops organization who spent years hunting him like an animal.\n\nFailure isn’t an option. Never quit. Never surrender.\n\n**Author's Note: While this book can be read as a standalone, there are numerous plot threads that continue from previous books. Reading in order will provide a better reading experience. **\n\nDo whatever it takes to survive…\n\nAddy Rugers survived a treacherous, brutal upbringing after her parents died. Trained for death and seduction and forced to work for her brother’s covert ops organization, she learned to rely only on herself and chameleon her way through every mission. With him dead and his organization dismantled, she now has a new life at The Arsenal—one where she can shed her personas and be herself. Now, she must immerse herself in the nightmarish world she fled and trust the one man with the power to destroy her.\n\nTo slay a monster, you must become one…\n\nKristof Lavrov sank into the criminal underworld two decades ago with one objective—revenge. The sacrifices made are only outnumbered by the atrocities he’s committed under the banner of vengeance. What little of his humanity remains is now under fire when he agrees to help the one woman that he’d sacrifice anything to protect. Their lives have intersected more than once, and he’s always had the strength to walk away.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThey must work together to save those they love, but the real war is one neither of them is prepared to wage.\n\nShe’s a magnet for trouble…\n\nAfter they saved her from a violent marriage years before, Bea Stanz made a vow to fix her own problems and not rely so much on her brother and his fellow operatives at Counterstrike. Her newfound independence has been far from easy, but Bea 2.0 is determined to handle whatever comes her way. When a simple errand exposes a dangerous international kidnapping ring, she turns to the one man who’s taken her protection as a personal mission.\n\nHe swore to keep her safe…\n\nJoe “Hazard” Santos left military service and joined Counterstrike after they rescued his sister. Protecting innocent women and children is his new mission, one he won’t fail. The beautiful, impulsive, and passionate little sister of a fellow operative is a task—one who blew into his life like a hurricane. He’ll do whatever it takes to keep her safe, even if she doesn’t want his help.\n\nThey will need every resource at their disposal to face this threat, but will all of Counterstrike and a Delta team be enough to succeed?"
