        "text": "Dr Ian Player (born March 15 1927, died November 30 2014).\n\nIan Player died in November 2014, aged 87. The older brother of professional golfer Gary Player became involved in conservation in the 1950s as a game ranger on the Hluhluwe uMfolozi Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, Africa’s oldest official nature reserve. When it was established in 1897, there were only about 50 southern white rhinos left in the world, all of them on this reserve. By the time Player began working there in 1952, the population had recovered somewhat to under 500; by 1960 Umfolozi’s population of white rhinos had grown to 600. Player realized that it was dangerous to keep them restricted to one small park, so he convinced his reluctant superiors into allowing to move some of the animals to other protected parts of their former habitat. The resulting Operation Rhino became one of the most successful wildlife translocation programs ever. The southern white rhino became the first animal to be removed from the IUCN endangered species list and has been reestablished from Zululand over much of its former range in South Africa with a population estimated at over 20,000 today. Player eventually retired from the Natal Parks Board in 1974 as chief conservator in Zululand to devote more time to the wilderness movement.\n\nIan Player learned his belief in the spiritual value of wild places and the principles of inhlonipho (respect) and ubuntu (compassion) from his fellow ranger Magqubu Ntombela, a charismatic Zulu of royal blood with whom he started working in 1958. “I was steeped in the racial prejudice of my country and Magqubu transformed me,” Player recalled. In 1963 Player and Ntombela founded a Wilderness Leadership School with the aim of taking young people with leadership potential into the wilderness to encourage them to “question their place in the great scheme of things”. The success of the project eventually led Player to establish an International Wilderness Leadership Foundation in 1974, followed three years later by the World Wilderness Congress, the world’s longest-running public environmental forum.\n\nWith his practical approach to conservation, Player influenced numerous crucial developments in the conservation field and was honored with honorary doctorates and awards from around the world. More recently, he came out of retirement to campaign for a relaxation of the ban on the trade in rhino horn following the present surge in rhino poaching. Player believed that government-controlled trading in horns from animals that died naturally could force prices down, undermine the illegal trade and provide a source of revenue for conservation. South Africa’s natural heritage is richer for his contribution and we thank his family for sharing him with us.\n\nCourtesey Gerhard R Damm, africanindaba.com\n\nDr Anthony Hall-Martin - world authority on African elephants and black rhinocerous.\n\nIt is with profound sadness that African Parks’ relays the news that Dr Anthony Hall-Martin, our co-founder and conservation director, passed away yesterday (Wednesday 21 May 2014) after a prolonged struggle with cancer. He was 68 years old and is survived by his wife Catherina and daughters Vega and Cate.\n\nAnthony had a distinguished conservation career of nearly 50 years and his loss will resonate throughout the continent. During his lifetime he tirelessly championed the cause of wildlife conservation, raised millions of dollars for its benefit, and was responsible for the establishment, expansion or management of dozens of protected areas. He was particularly renowned as a world authority on the African elephant and black rhinoceros and was the author of more than ten books and 80 published scientific papers. During his lengthy tenure at South African National Parks, he was directly responsible for the establishment of six new national parks including Table Mountain National Park, Agulhas National Park, Namaqua National Park and Mapungubwe National Park. He was also responsible for the significant expansion of several national parks adding an additional 400,000 hectares to amongst others, Addo National Park, Augrabies National Park, Mountain Zebra National Park, Karoo National Park and Marakele National Park. Anthony also had the foresight to de-proclaim the compromised Vaalbos National Park which was then replaced with the bio-diversity rich Mokoala National Park. He was a pioneer in the establishment of transfrontier conservation areas and was responsible for the conclusion of the agreement between Botswana and South Africa that gave rise to the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. During his career he was responsible for the introduction of elephant and rhino to national parks and wildlife reserves across Africa, contributing greatly to the conservation of these species. Today, Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania have populations of black rhino as a direct result of his interventions.\n\nAs co-founder of African Parks in 2000, Anthony had the foresight to realise that a pragmatic new model was required to address the looming conservation crisis in many parts of Africa. As the Conservation and Development Director at African Parks, he championed the organisation’s entry into Malawi, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Zambia, and negotiated with dozens of African Governments to advance the conservation of protected areas across the continent. One of his notable success stories was the transformation of Majete Wildlife Reserve in Malawi from a totally depleted park to a thriving conservation success involving an initial restocking of over 2,500 animals including elephant, black rhinoceros, buffalo, sable antelope, zebra, lion and leopard. At the time of his death, Anthony was a board member of Majete Wildlife Reserve in Malawi, Liuwa Plain National Park in Zambia and Akagera National Park in Rwanda. He continued to work tirelessly to secure more protected areas across Africa until literally days before his death.\n\nAnthony was a founder of the IUCN African Rhino Specialist Group and co-founder of the Rhino and Elephant Foundation. He was a trusted advisor to many conservation organisations, including the IUCN, WWF, Endangered Wildlife Trust and Peace Parks Foundation, and received a number of awards for his contribution to conservation, including the British Council for Zoology Award, the Bruno H Schubert Prize in Germany, the Senior Captain Scott Medal from the South African Academy of Science, and the National Geographic Society Award.\n\nAs tributes pour in from the conservation world, those who knew Anthony have described him as a conservation giant whose impact was felt throughout the African continent. At African Parks,Anthony was a mentor, friend and inspiration to his many colleagues who valued and benefitted from his wisdom, wit and guidance. He has left a significant conservation legacy for the world and he will be sorely missed by all who knew, respected and loved him.\n\nCourtesey Peter Fearnhead, Chief Executive Officer African Parks Network\n\nAnthony King (18 March 1968 - 24 February 2013), who has died in an air crash aged 44, was a leading campaigner for wildlife conservation in Kenya. For more than 20 years King and his wife Delphine contributed to the work of numerous conservation organisations and programmes in East Africa, including the African Wildlife Foundation, the UN Environment Programme, the African Conservation Centre, the Mpala Wildlife Foundation and the Kenya Land Conservation Trust. But King became most closely associated with the Laikipia Wildlife Forum (LWF), of which he was executive director from 2005 to 2011. Anthony King was born in Nairobi on March 18 1968. His father, Professor John King, was veterinary officer and head of the capture unit of the Kenya Game Department, and led early conservation work on rhinos and elephants in the 1960s. The first few years of Anthony’s life were spent in the Nairobi National Park. He also played a role in the development of a national association for community and private land conservation areas — the Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association — and in the drafting of the Kenyan government’s recent Wildlife Act.\n\nKing was killed when the light aircraft he was piloting crashed in Mount Kenya Forest during bad weather on the morning of Sunday 24th February 2013. A passenger also died. Anthony King is survived by his wife and their two sons.\n\nBorn in England, Phil Hockey (8 March 1956 – 24 January 2013) came to the FitzPatrick Institute in 1976 to assist with a study of White-fronted Plover breeding biology at Langebaan Lagoon. Preferring conditions here to counting sea ducks in winter from freezing Scottish shores, Phil moved to South Africa in 1979 to study African Black Oystercatchers for his PhD. After graduating in 1983, Phil stayed on at the Fitztitute as a contract researcher, and then as a lecturer. Although most of his early research focused on coastal and estuarine bird ecology, Phil was involved in setting the guidelines for the first southern African bird atlas, and was lead author on the bird atlas of the Southwestern Cape. Phil’s focus on coastal waders and interactions with their food supplies took him to tropical Africa and islands in the Indian Ocean, South America, the Canary Islands and the Middle East. He was soon recognised as the authority on African waders and in 1995 he published the monograph 'Waders of Southern Africa'. Together with Ian Sinclair and Warwick Tarboton he also wrote the best-selling regional field guide 'Sasol Birds of Southern Africa'.\n\nAs Phil’s career developed, he broadened his fields of interest to include bird movement and migration, avian life history evolution and the ecology of rarity. He also extended his horizons inland, taking charge of the Fitz’s Karoo ecosystems project. By the end of the 1990s, Phil was one of the most experienced ornithologists in southern Africa, and a natural choice to lead the revision of 'Roberts’ Birds of Southern Africa'.\n\nPhil was appointed the Institute's Director in 2008 and has led the DST/NRF Centre of Excellence using ‘Birds as Keys to Biodiversity Conservation’ to new heights. During his career, he graduated 18 PhD and 33 MSc students, and supervised eight Post-doctoral Fellows and some 30 honours projects. In addition to more than 120 scientific papers, Phil published over 150 semi-popular articles and 12 books and book chapters. He was passionate about the need to disseminate the science of birds, and their conservation, to a wide audience, and frequently presented public lectures, radio and television interviews. His contribution in this regard was recognised by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research who named him ‘Marine and Coastal Communicator of the Year’ in 2000 and he was awarded the Stevenson-Hamilton Medal by the Zoological Society of Southern Africa in 2008 for contributions to the public awareness of science.\n\nPhil’s impact and leadership in ornithology has been exemplary and he will be remembered through his vast contribution to the avian literature, both scientific and popular. Phil touched the hearts and lives of many people, from deeply insightful discussions about birds to warm interactions on life itself. He was a deeply caring person with an open heart and will be sorely missed by many.\n\nLawrence Anthony (September 17 1950, died March 2 2012), a legend in South Africa and author of 3 books including the bestseller, The Elephant Whisperer. He bravely rescued wildlife and rehabilitated elephants all over the globe from human atrocities, including the courageous rescue of Baghdad Zoo animals during US invasion in 2003.\n\nOn March 7, 2012 Lawrence Anthony died. He is remembered and missed by his wife, 2 sons, 2 grandsons, and numerous elephants. Two days after his passing, the wild elephants showed up at his home led by two large matriarchs. Separate wild herds arrived in droves to say goodbye to their beloved 'man-friend'. A total of 31 elephants had patiently walked over 12 miles to get to his South African house. Witnessing this spectacle, humans were obviously in awe not only because of the supreme intelligence and precise timing that these elephants sensed about Lawrence's passing, but also because of the profound memory and emotion the beloved animals evoked in such an organized way: Walking slowly, for days, making their way in a solemn one-by-one queue from their habitat to his house.\n\nLawrence 's wife, Francoise, was especially touched, knowing that the elephants had not been to his house prior to that day for well over 3 years! But yet they knew where they were going. The elephants obviously wanted to pay their deep respects, honouring their friend who'd saved their lives - so much respect that they stayed for 2 days 2 nights without eating anything. Then one morning, they left, making their long journey back home.\n\nLawrence Anthony made world headlines in 2003 when he arrived in war-torn Baghdad to rescue the animals in Saddam Hussein’s zoo. He told the story of the elephants in The Elephant Whisperer (co-written with Graham Spence). Baghdad was not Anthony’s only experience of working in war zones. In 2006 he convinced the leaders of The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), which has been involved in a bloody struggle with the Ugandan government for more than two decades, to sign up to a conservation project to save the northern white rhino, one of the world’s rarest animals."
