        "text": "Personally signed by George Zebrowski on the special limitation page.\n\nEaston Press. Norwalk, CT. 1989. George Zebrowski \"Stranger Suns\". Personally signed by George Zebrowski. Signed First Edition. The Signed First Edition of Science Fiction collection. Beautifully illustrated and luxuriously bound in full genuine leather. As new, sealed without any visible flaws.\n\nAbout the book\n\nThe orbiting tachyon detector was designed by physicist Juan Obrion to identify life in other star systems, but even though he expected to find some signs of life, he certainly didn't expect to find any life on Earth. When Obrion discovers that a culture has been concealed for many years far below Antarctica, he ventures out as part of a four-man team to explore the unknown. Juan, Lena, Malachi, and Magnus are awestruck when they discover a myriad of portals to parallel lands, but the maze they fall into makes them wonder if their journey will ever come to an end.\n\nAbout the author\n\nGeorge Zebrowski (born December 28, 1945) is an American science fiction author and editor who has written and edited a number of books, and is a former editor of The Bulletin of the Science Fiction Writers of America. He lives with author Pamela Sargent, with whom he has co-written a number of novels, including Star Trek novels.\n\nZebrowski won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1999 for his novel Brute Orbits. Three of his short stories, \"Heathen God,\" \"The Eichmann Variations,\" and \"Wound the Wind,\" have been nominated for the Nebula Award, and \"The Idea Trap\" was nominated for the Theodore Sturgeon Award.\n\nFeatures"
