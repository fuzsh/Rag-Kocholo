        "text": "Swift Thoughts\n\nGeorge Zebrowski\n\nOpen Road logo\n\nFor Ian Watson\n\nConteur Splendide\n\nand my friend\n\nThe Writer as Philosopher\n\nI have long thought of George Zebrowski as our most European science fiction writer. Specifically Eastern European, though he is in fact an American who has lived here nearly all his life. And that is why you should read him.\n\nHis Polish ancestry probably greatly influenced the young George, growing up in a typical immigrant New York community, and indeed, perhaps his greatest influence is Stanislaw Lem, the great Polish SF writer. George’s earliest memories are of a stormy night in a small English town, where his parents paused in their exodus. He learned English from doctors and nurses while he recovered from a hip operation. He didn’t reach America until 1951.\n\nBut there’s something more than cultural currents at work here. You should read Zebrowski because he is a bracing writer, one who sends us back to the basic questions time and again. His sense of discipline and logic as prime requirements in science fiction differs utterly from the usual writers-workshop talk of the techniques of character, plot and pacing. Like Lem, Zebrowski is a philosophical writer in the classic European mode. He took his BA in philosophy of science, but chose to pursue this interest into the swamp of a writer’s career, rather than the comfy but dry plains of academe.\n\nIn his hands philosophy lives particularly through its debt to mathematics—and there is nothing harder to write than science fiction about mathematics (take it from one who has tried). Even practicing mathematicians, or mathematical physicists like me, find the deeper issues visible only as a distant mountain range, seldom climbed. To fully appreciate Zebrowski you must see what he thinks are the really big problems. Permit me to give some background that will help approach his perhaps most characteristic short story, Gödel’s Doom.\n\nIn the past century or two, philosophy has taken quite a few lumps from mathematics. Kant held the truths of geometry to be synthetic a priori—things we know from prior knowledge, the basics. But then relativity and Riemann came along, and now even little children in the streets of Göttingen know that geometry is in Kant’s terms a synthetic a posteriori category, a checkable fact. And we do not live in a Euclidean universe, either, as Kant imagined, but rather a space-time curved by gravity. So much for metaphysics.\n\nIn dogged pursuit of some sort of certainty, the thrust of mathematical philosophy ever since this Kantian shipwreck has been toward arithmetization, the simplest of logical structures we know, only slightly above the level of a tic-tac-toe game (which is, after all, about rectangular rigidities). The logical weight of the entire edifice rests on mere arithmetic, from which the remainder of mathematics can be built up, as Bertrand Russell and Lord Whitehead showed in 1913. All analytic philosophy, in turn, rests on analogies with the truths of arithmetic. And you thought that arithmetic was just a set of tricks for doing the books!\n\nBut professional philosophers worry about central matters, such as: Are the axioms of arithmetic consistent and complete? In the early 1900s David Hilbert set out to prove this (that is, the absolute consistency of arithmetic, and thus mathematics) and became the father of the formalist school. The Dutchman L. E. J. Brouwer, on the other hand, championed the intuitionist school. The collision between these views led the great Gödel to show in the 1930s that the question addressed by Hilbert was not answerable: that is, proof of the absolute consistency of mathematics could never be given—it was a fundamentally undecidable proposition.\n\nThe famous Barber Paradox of Russell illustrates this point: Barrett the Barber put a sign in his shop window saying Barrett the Barber is willing to shave all, and only, men unwilling to shave themselves. The paradox arises when one asks, Who will shave Barrett? This question is undecidable within the limited language of the sign. We therefore need a new sign to take care of Barrett (Exclude Barrett from the above). This change fixes the problem, essentially by putting a patch on it. Band-Aid philosophy. It didn’t hold.\n\nGödel soon showed that, in arithmetic, the added signs can be put into another, larger arithmetic language, and that this larger language also must include undecidable statements. Thus, if model building in science seeks to make a formalistically exact statement, it must fail, for there is no way to prove self-consistency.\n\nThis discussion may seem like employing a philosophical howitzer to slay a literary mouse, but it is important to realize that Gödel’s proof—which many consider the most important development in philosophy in the twentieth century—means that we have to ask whether it applies to everything we know, not just how to add and subtract. Enter the science fiction writer.\n\nIn Gödel’s Doom, Zebrowski says, So why not ask, just to see; human beings have always been suspicious of mere reasoning, no matter how powerful. If one could only show that the universe where people actually live is not a place where Gödel’s proof works, then as Zebrowski says, we’re automatons!—because the rules are complete, and there is nothing in our world that can’t be dictated by the laws that govern it (whether we know those laws or not).\n\nHeady stuff. Only Zebrowski would have the notion of proving this by having an artificial intelligence run a super-duper test of arithmetic. It should keep running forever, if Gödel is right, but… well, you’ll have to read the story. Suitably, it ends on a note of uncertain promise. I’ve always thought the tale could have a big, gloriously imaginative sequel—What does the world outside really look like, once we know such truths?—but so far, George resists the notion.\n\nOthers liked this characteristic, utterly Zebrowskian story quite a bit. It gained publication first in Popular Computing, then F&SF, and finally on to the journal of the Bertrand Russell Society, which had never published any fiction before. It has also been reprinted by Rudy Rucker in his notable Mathenauts. Good company, indeed.\n\nFrom such airy vaults Zebrowski does descend to the jungles and deserts of the human soul, and his short stories gathered here reflect a concern with our frailty, as well. You have some wrenching treats in store in Lenin in Odessa, an alternate history story I edited, or The Eichmann Variations. His two stories (The Last Science Fiction Story of the 20th Century and Catch the Sleep Ship: The First Science Fiction Story of the 21st Century) bracketing the passage of the millennium are stimulating, too. My favorite is also the admirably compact The Holdouts, which he published in the august scientific periodical Nature. It looks forward to a time when absolute certainty is still not within our grasp, but we have made much more of our universe than now. I gave copies to several particle physicist friends, and they loved it. All that, in under a thousand words.\n\nPerhaps in this story lies Zebrowski’s central message—we should expand human horizons, gaining power over our lives and over the world… but the pursuit of rigid sureness is an illusion, however tempting, whether in the hands of science or religion.\n\nHis stories are compact, austere, rigorous. In his novels he relaxes a great deal. (George has even written a Star Trek novel!) His recent Brute Orbits, for example, is a science fictional Crime and Punishment. This volume of his short work reveals an austere intellect, preoccupied with big questions, but sensing how surely these make our pulses pound when cast into the framed realm of fiction. Doing heavy-duty thinking in fiction is indeed, as he puts it in one of his afterwords, finding the lie necessary to the task.\n\nGregory Benford\n\nJuly 2001\n\nThe Word Sweep\n\nThe words on the floor were as thick as leaves when Felix arrived at the party. At five past eleven, the room should have been silent.\n\nQuiet! he shouted, unable to hold back.\n\nThe word formed in the air and floated to the floor at his feet. A deaf couple in the corner continued talking with their hands. Everyone was looking at him, and he felt his stomach tighten. He should have motioned for silence instead of speaking.\n\nA small woman with large brown eyes came up to him and handed him a drink. He sipped. Vodka. It was her way of saying, yeah, we know you’ve got a lousy job policing the yak ration. Pooping parties for a living can’t be fun, you poor bastard. We know.\n\nHeads nodded to show approval of the woman’s gesture.\n\nFelix tried to smile, feeling ashamed for losing control. Then he turned and went out again into the cool October night.\n\nAt the end of the block, the compactor was waiting for the sweeps to clean out the corner house. He was glad that he did not have to work in the inner city, where control was always slipping, where the babbling often buried entire neighborhoods to a depth of four or five feet.\n\nHe took a deep breath. Watching out for five suburban blocks was not so bad, especially when his beat changed once a month. He couldn’t grow too friendly with the homeowners.\n\nThe tension in his gut lessened. At least this party had not given him any trouble. He could see that the guests had tried to be sedate, speaking as little as possible during the evening, priding themselves on their ability to hold words and liquor. He had not seen any babblers sitting on a pile of verbiage. This was a good block, much better than last month’s section.\n\nA dog ran by in the empty street. Felix noted the muzzle. No problem there.\n\nHe started a slow walk home, passing the compactor as it turned on its light and started silently down the next block. Two streets down, he turned to avoid going through the district square, where they were still cleaning up after the political rally.\n\nThere was a message for him on the phone screen:\n\nLet’s ration together after\n\nyou get home. I’ll save\n\nmine. Love, June\n\nThe words angered him, bringing back the tension in his stomach. He cleared the screen, resenting the message because it ruined the calming effect of his long walk home.\n\nHe went into the bedroom and lay down. When he tried, he could almost remember the time when words did not materialize. He must have been four or five when it happened for the first time. He remembered wafer-thin objects, letters joined together in as many differing styles as there were speakers.\n\nAt first it had been a novelty, then a perpetual snowstorm. Cities had to clean up after a daily disaster, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, trucking the words to incinerators and landfills. The words would burn only at high temperatures, and even then they would give off a toxic gas which had to be contained. There had been a government project to find a use for the gas, but it took too much energy for the burning to make it worthwhile; later the gas was found to be useless.\n\nPsychiatric treatment came to a halt, then shifted to computer printout and nonverbal therapies. Movies had gone back to silent and subtitled versions; only the very rich could afford to truck away the refuse after each talkie showing. Opera was performed in mime and music-only reductions….\n\nFelix opened his eyes and sat up in the darkness. Somewhere far away, a deviant was running through the streets. He could just barely hear the screaming, but it was loud enough to remind him of the time he had been a deviant.\n\nUnable to control himself, he had almost buried himself in words one night, under a giant elm tree near the edge of town. The words had poured out of him as if they were trying to outnumber the stars, while he had held his stomach and screamed obscenities.\n\nBruno Black, who had been fully grown before the world had changed, had explained it to him later. It had been the silence, the prolonged, thought-filled silence that had broken his control, as it had broken the resolve of countless others. The need to speak had come uncontrollably into him one day, ridding him of cogency, sweeping through him like a wind, bestowing the freedom of babble, taking away wit and limit, making his mouth into a river, out of which words had flowed like wars… in the end a wonderful nonsense had cleansed his brain.\n\nNow, as he listened to the distant deviant howling in the night, he again felt the trial of terse expression; the jungle was growing in around him, threatening to wipe away all his control when he fell asleep, enticing him with pleasures stronger than the silence….\n\nHe looked around the dark room. The closed bedroom door stood in the corner, a sly construction, suggesting an entire world on the other side….\n\nThe distant sound stopped. They had caught him. Samson, Winkle, Blake—all the block watchers had converged on the explosion to squash it. The word sweeps were already clearing up, compacting, driving away to the landfills.\n\nFor a moment he wondered if it might have been Bruno, then rejected the idea; Bruno’s voice was much lower than that. It might have been a woman.\n\nFelix relaxed and lay back again.\n\nHe woke up in the night, got up and went to his desk. He saw the phone screen glowing and remembered June’s message. The new message read:\n\nYou bastard! Answer for\n\nChrist’s sake. Is Bruno\n\nwith you again? What\n\ndo you two do together?\n\nHe cleared the screen and turned on the desk lamp. Then he sat down and took out Bruno’s journal. He looked at it under the light, remembering how much relief it had given him through the years. His fingers were shaking. Inside its pages were all the things he had wanted to say, but Bruno had said them much better. Bruno had written them down.\n\nOpening at random, he looked at the neat handwriting. Bruno was not verbose, even on paper, where it would have been harmless. The very letters were well-formed, the sentences thoughtful and clear. If read out loud, they would not exceed anyone’s daily ration.\n\nHe read an early entry:\n\n23 July 1941\n\nWhen the words started materializing, the difference between language and physical reality was blurred. The appearance of spoken words in all shapes and sizes, depending on the articulation of the speaker, imposed a martial law of silence, enforced at first by a quietly administered death penalty in some parts of the world. The rate of materialization had to be cut down at all costs, lest the world be thrown into a global economic depression….\n\nThe depression had come and gone, leaving behind a new code of conduct, the word sweeps, the compactors, and the block watchers—and a mystery as great as the very fact of existence. Bruno was certain that there had to be an answer; his journal represented twenty years of speculation about the problem. The possibility of an answer, Felix thought, is all that keeps me together. I don’t know what I’ll do if Bruno doesn’t come back.\n\nSomeone started pounding on the front door. Felix stood and went out to check.\n\nHe opened the door and June barged in, marching past him into the living room, where she turned on the lights.\n\nHe closed the door and faced her.\n\nYou treat me like I don’t exist! she shouted.\n\nThe you was a flimsy thing; it broke into letters when it hit the carpet. Treat seemed to be linked like a chain as it clattered onto the coffee table, where it produced a few nonsense-masses before it lay still. Me whipped by him like a sparrow and crunched against the wall, creating more nonsense-masses. Like settled slowly to the rug; I knifed into the pile next to it. Don’t and exist collided in midair, scattering their letters.\n\nFelix spread his hands, afraid to speak, fearful that at any moment his deviancy would slide up out of the darkness within him and take over. Didn’t she know how hard a life he led? He’d told her a hundred times. A look of pity started to form on her freckled face, reminding him of the brown-eyed woman who had given him a drink; but it died suddenly. June turned and started for the door.\n\nWe’re finished! she shouted as she went out. The words failed to clear the door as she slammed it behind her, and dropped next to the coat rack. He looked at the nonsense-masses that her pounding had created, grateful that the door was well cushioned.\n\nHe let out a mental sigh and sat down in the armchair by the lamp. At least there would be no more pressure, however much he missed her. Soon, he knew, he would have to go looking for Bruno.\n\nThe clock over the fireplace read four A.M.\n\nHe turned on the radio and listened to the merciful music. The notes formed, evaporating one by one. A harpsichord came on, the notes lasting a bit longer before winking out. He watched them come and go for a long time, wondering, as Bruno had done so often in his journal, what kind of cosmic justice had permitted music to remain. As the Scarlatti sonata rushed toward its finale, the crystalline sounds came faster and faster, dusting the room with vibrant notes.\n\nJune had simply never liked Bruno; there was no darkness in her. Like those who were forgetting the self-awareness created by speech, she did not need to speak.\n\nHe turned off the radio and wondered if Mr. Seligman next door was burying himself in sleeptalk. How many children were sleeping with their training muzzles on, until they learned self-control?\n\nHis hands started shaking again. The pressure to speak was building up inside him, almost as strongly as during his deviant days. June’s visit had triggered it; the loss of her had affected him more than he realized.\n\nJune, he said softly, wanting her.\n\nThe word was round, the letters connected with flowing curves, as it drifted to the rug. He reached down, picked it up and dropped it into the felt-lined waste basket next to the armchair.\n\nHis hands were still shaking. He got up and paced back and forth. After a few minutes he noticed that his screen was on in the bedroom. He walked through the open door, sat down at the desk, and read:\n\nDisturbance reported at the\n\nlandfill. Check when your shift\n\nbegins this morning. Webber\n\nOne of the others has gone nuts, he thought, and they want me to bring him home.\n\nFelix changed his shirt and shoes and went outside. He unlocked the bicycle from its post, mounted the cracked leather seat, and pushed out into the empty street.\n\nCool, humid mists rose around the one-story suburban houses. Only every fifth streetlamp was on, and these began to wink out as the sky grew brighter. He estimated that it would take him half an hour to reach the landfill.\n\nHe remembered it as a plain of dry earth being blown into dust clouds by the wind. The place would soon be incapable of accepting any more words, or garbage; it was full, except for an occasional hole. A new site would have to be found.\n\nAs Felix neared the landfill, he noticed the strangeness of the grass on both sides of the road. The sun cleared the horizon in a clear blue sky; and the grass suddenly looked like matted animal hair, growing up from a red skin. There was a pungent, lemonlike odor in the air as he stood up on the bicycle to climb a hill.\n\nHe reached the top and stopped.\n\nThe landfill was covered with trees, looking like fresh moss, or tall broccoli. The sharp smell was stronger.\n\nHe got back on the seat and coasted downhill.\n\nA stillness enveloped him when he reached bottom, as if he had entered the quiet center of the world. As the forest came closer, he considered the possibility of a massive planting program but realized that it would not have been possible in so short a time.\n\nHe passed the first trees. They appeared very fresh, like the limbs of young girls, bent upward, open in inviting positions; soft yellow-green moss had grown between the branches.\n\nHe pedaled forward, growing anxious, but the stillness was restful, calming him. The lemon scent of the trees cleared away the sleepiness in his head.\n\nSuddenly he rolled into a small clearing and stopped short at the edge of a large hole. Bruno Black sat at the bottom, talking to himself as the words piled up around him.\n\nHello, Bruno. The words formed and slid down the sandy slope.\n\nThe blond-haired man looked up. Come down. The words popped away from his mouth and landed on the pile.\n\nFelix started down.\n\nIt’s safe here, Bruno shouted, we can talk all we want.\n\nWhen he reached the large, seated figure, Felix noticed that Bruno’s clothes were torn and dirty.\n\nYou’ve got to let me get you out of this, Felix said.\n\nOnly the first three words formed, falling at his feet.\n\nNotice that?\n\nWhat’s going on here, Bruno?\n\nNo words formed this time, as if the effect was beginning to die away.\n\nIt’s only here, Bruno said, nowhere else.\n\nFelix sat down next to the ruddy-faced man and looked at him carefully.\n\nBruno—you know me?\n\nOf course, Felix, don’t be stupid. You’re my friend.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nI think I’ve figured it out—all of it, why it happens, and why it fails here. The last three words formed, wretched little gray letters floating in the air like smoke.\n\nBruno brushed them away with a bearlike swipe.\n\nFelix, I may really know. I’m not crazy.\n\nFelix heard a wind rushing above the hole, as if something were growing angry. He remembered a schoolyard, many years ago, with children playing volleyball, silently.\n\nHave you got a shovel?\n\nNo, Felix said, but I can get one.\n\nAgain no words. Bruno was watching him.\n\nWonderful, isn’t it?\n\nBruno—how long has all this been here?\n\nAbout a month.\n\nAll this grew in a month?\n\n\"The trees grew out of the buried words, Felix, pregnant words they were….\"\n\nThe silence was clear between them, devoid of words.\n\nIt comes and goes, Bruno said. All the words appeared, letters deformed, as if they were gnarly tree branches, and fell into Bruno’s lap.\n\nThere’s something that does this, he said as he brushed them away. We can bring it all to an end, when we find it. The shovel is the key to the whole business.\n\nIt all made a peculiar sense.\n\nThere’s a utility shed at the fork in the road, Felix said, but are you okay?\n\nI just look bad.\n\nThere were no words. Felix marveled as he scrambled out of the hole. Bruno was definitely on to something.\n\nBruno was digging with his hands when Felix came back with two shovels. He threw them into the hole next to Bruno, and clambered down.\n\nIt couldn’t be natural, what happened to the world, Bruno said as he picked up a shovel and started digging. Felix grabbed the other one and they dug back-to-back.\n\nWhy not natural? Felix asked.\n\nMaybe it could—some twist in the geometry of space forms words in response to our sounds. I assumed it wasn’t natural and went looking for spots where it wouldn’t happen.\n\nWhy did it all start?\n\nMaybe it was a political thing, Bruno said. Somebody was planning a form of thought control, but it got out of hand. A while back, I think, our politicos contacted an alien civilization in some far space, a mind contact maybe, and learned how to construct… certain devices. Perhaps the alien culture thought it would help us think more concisely. He laughed. It’s more than poetic prankery, you see. Language, as much as toolmaking, is directly responsible for the growth of our intelligence and self-consciousness. We’re as smart, or stupid, as our skillful use of words. It’s the automatic programs, the habits, that deaden the mind, the dogmatic mazes….\n\nHe paused. Not this hole, we’ve got to try elsewhere.\n\nBruno might simply be crazy, Felix thought, nothing more.\n\nIf you wanted to affect a culture, Bruno continued, put a restriction on its use of language and watch native ingenuity increase, like the improvement of hearing in the blind.\n\nFelix climbed out of the hole and gave Bruno a hand up.\n\nA wind blew across the landfill, soughing through the strange trees as if it were slowly becoming aware of the intruders. Leaves lay strewn everywhere. Some seemed to be stained by decay, like old misshapen coins; others were curling into small tubes. The wind gusted, swirling them into disarray, imparting its energy of motion to raise them into the air. Again Felix had the sensation of standing at the edge of the world. He wondered what June would think if she were to see him here with Bruno.\n\nThen he noticed that the trees seemed to be shaped like letters, bent and distorted, echoing the millions of words buried in the ground.\n\nLet’s dig by one of the trees, Bruno said. The seven words flew out of his mouth and were lifted by the wind, which deposited them in the branches, where they sat like blackbirds.\n\nFelix went up to the nearest tree and started digging. Bruno joined in. The sun climbed toward noon.\n\nTesting, Bruno said. No word appeared. Maybe something in our minds was altered, to form the words when we speak….\n\nYou mean there may be no machine?\n\nWhat’s that? Bruno asked, pointing.\n\nA crystalline rod protruded from the dirt. Felix stepped into the hole and continued digging while Bruno rested. Slowly, Felix uncovered a complex mechanism, a cubelike shape of glassy-metallic connections, a maze of shiny pipes and joints, mirror surfaces and solid figures.\n\nIt’s… like a large piece of jewelry, Felix said.\n\nI was afraid of this, Bruno said. \"I thought there might be a relay device, a generator, something that changed speech into solid objects working worldwide.\"\n\nWell, what’s this then? A local station in the net?\n\nSuddenly, Bruno clutched at his chest and fell forward, easing himself down with the shovel.\n\nYou’re ill, Felix said, squatting down next to him.\n\nMy heart… but listen. I may die, but you have to listen….\n\nA demented stare came into Bruno’s face, as if he knew that his understanding of the truth was superior to all the deceiving forces around him. He pulled himself backward on the ground, until he was sitting up against the tree, one foot in the hole.\n\nTry not to move, I’ll get help, Felix said.\n\nListen! He raised his hand to his eyes and rubbed them. Then he stared at the alien artifact and spoke, his voice a low, silken tenor. Humankind fell into a dream. Maybe it was the result of some massive failure, brought on by the straining of psyches long overworked with the yoke of metaphor and simile, paradigm and tautology—in a creature that longed to know the universe directly, tired of sense-show charades, the shadows of real things projected through the dirty windows of the eye, the noisy avenues of the ear….\n\nHis voice grew plaintive and sad. \"We grew discouraged by the blindness of touch, the lie of taste and smell, disappointed by the children’s universe of not-too-little and not-too-much, of knowing and not knowing, of anxious flight from ignorance into only relative knowledge, stretched tightly between the extremes of sufficiency and insufficiency, between the great and small. We would never be all-knowing, yet we were not nothing. The hopelessness was too much, driving us into this common delusion.\" He closed his eyes and Felix saw tears in his friend’s face.\n\nBut maybe it is an alien yoke, Felix said.\n\nI would prefer that, but this silly machine….\n\nHe coughed and clutched his chest.\n\nBruno!\n\nFelix picked up the shovel and struck the ornate machine. It was a blow for objectivity, forging a way into a universe outside delusion, for an end to the torment of the brute words struggling to break out of him. He hit the machine again; maybe the blow would alter something in the human mind.\n\nEven if we end this, Bruno whispered loudly, we don’t know what else we may awaken into.\n\nFelix struck the machine a third time.\n\nIt’s only a projection of our wish, Felix, to find an answer….\n\nThe world darkened and the wind threw branches onto them and the machine. The device shimmered and disappeared. The branches were like snakes as Felix struggled to free himself. There was a horrible sound from Bruno. Felix crawled toward him and looked into his face. Bruno’s eyes were glassy, like the crystal of the machine, staring into an abyss.\n\nI see it, Bruno croaked, his words trembling.\n\nFelix looked around. A black bag had been pulled down over the world.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nI see it all! The words vibrated, but did not form.\n\nI don’t see anything. The blackness was impenetrable.\n\nSenseless… blind, nothing there for us, Bruno muttered.\n\nFelix strained to see. The dark shimmered. He heard a howling in his ears; his eyes rushed forward through a confusion of colors; he expected to collide with a wall at any moment.\n\nNothing for us, Bruno was saying, only constraints, humiliating chains for a will that can expand to infinity or focus into smallness…\n\nThe continuum tilted and Felix was falling. Chaos crept into him. Not the sense of chance or statistical disorder obeying its own laws, but mindless, unpredictable fluidity, cruel, unrestrained and unredeemable—the pulsing substratum of reality. He perceived it in the only way possible, with the narrow gauge of finite senses—a gray, alien mass at the center of time, at the heart of mind, enveloping all space, a cosmic jack-in-the-box always ready to give the lie to all pretense, a centrality which could never be defeated, only held in degrees of check.\n\nBruno! he called, but the word came out as nonsense.\n\nThe darkness faded and he saw Bruno sitting up against the tree.\n\nYou’re okay! Felix shouted in relief.\n\nBruno looked up, but he seemed to be on the other side of a barrier. Wic wore tos repelton, he said, smiling.\n\nWhat?\n\nRepelton, tos?\n\nThey stared at each other as the last quantum of information slipped across the bridge of silence, revealing the situation to them.\n\nFelix took a step forward, but Bruno seemed to retreat, as if there were a frame around him and something had moved him back.\n\nCages, Felix realized. We’ll die alone unless we can reach each other. He would never touch June again, or even speak to her; they would look at each other through the wrong end of a telescope, trying to rename the simplest things with gibberish. Our illnesses, our desire to transcend the world, have deformed everything.\n\nBruno was waving at him. Tos? Wixwell, mamtom ono! He shrugged. Prexel worbout it, he added.\n\nFelix cursed, but the word was indecipherable as two copies appeared and settled to the ground near his feet.\n\nAuthor Notes to\n\nThe Word Sweep\n\nPeople talk too much. And of the making of books there is no end. I don’t know if these thoughts were in my mind when I wrote this story, but I was imagining what it would be like, socially, if words appeared physically whenever someone spoke. Of course, the story can’t help but resonate with satirical conceits, however pure my what if motive was at the time.\n\nI received one response which credited the purity of my intent, from Howard Waldrop, who wrote that it is one of those stories we all wish we’d written, only George did it first and (unlike many who write great idea stories) did it right. There’s no room left for improvement. And Ian Watson commented that the story stands out for its originality and power, as an excellent enigmatic metaphor.\n\nThe French translated it as Piles de Mots in Fiction, which sounded right to me. You might guess that I had a lot of fun writing it.\n\nStarcrossed\n\nVisual was a silence of stars, audio a mindless seething on the electromagnetic spectrum, the machine-metal roar of the universe, a million gears grinding steel wires in their teeth. Kinetic was hydrogen and microdust swirling past the starprobe’s hull, deflected by a shield of force. Time was experienced time, approaching zero, a function of near-light speed relative to the solar system. Thought hovered above sleep, dreaming, aware of simple operations continuing throughout the systems of the sluglike starprobe; simple data filtering into storage to be analyzed later. Identity was the tacit dimension of the past making present awareness possible: MOB—Modified Organic Brain embodied in a cyborg relationship with a probe vehicle en route to Antares, a main sequence M-type star 170 light-years from the solar system with a spectral character of titanium oxide, violet light weak, red in color, 390 solar diameters across…\n\nThe probe ship slipped into the ashes of other-space, a gray field which suddenly obliterated the stars, silencing the electromagnetic simmer of the universe. MOB was distantly aware of the stresses of passing into nonspace, the brief distortions which made it impossible for biological organisms to survive the procedure unless they were ship-embodied MOBs. A portion of MOB recognized the distant echo of pride in usefulness, but the integrated self knew this to be a result of organic residues in the brain core.\n\nDespite the probe’s passage through other-space, the journey would still take a dozen human years. When the ship reentered normal space, MOB would come to full consciousness, ready to complete its mission in the Antares system. MOB waited, secure in its purpose.\n\nMOB was aware of the myoelectrical nature of the nutrient bath in which it floated, connected via synthetic nerves to the computer and its chemical RNA memory banks of near infinite capacity. All of Earth’s knowledge was available for use in dealing with any situation which might arise, including contact with an alien civilization. Simple human-derived brain portions operated the routine components"
