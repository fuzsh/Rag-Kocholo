We queue up to be the first to own the latest smart phone. You’re either The Next Big Thing or you’re yesterday’s news.\n\nBut many things improve with age – fine wines, objets d’art and – as Paul Di Filippo reminds us – books. Or, more precisely, the reputation and importance of certain books.\n\nGeorge Zebrowski published three books from 1977 through 1983 which were collected in that latter year as The Omega Point Trilogy. All that publishing history happened from forty to thirty years ago, far enough back for us to finally perhaps say something really solid about them. The three books of the trilogy were Ashes and Stars; The Omega Point; and Mirror of Minds.\n\nTogether, I think, they constitute one of the highpoints of that era in our genre, a late-period exfoliation of recomplicated Golden Age space opera, and should be properly invested as such . . ."
