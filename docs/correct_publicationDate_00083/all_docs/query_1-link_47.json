His only lead—an attractive landlady—becomes more than a lead and drives him into a world of terror, where his sanity is questioned and he must stop the monster before she does more evil. Or should he join her? Does he even have a choice, or will he just be driven by terror?(Publisher). Very good / very good. Item #14954\n\nISBN: 1930846592"
