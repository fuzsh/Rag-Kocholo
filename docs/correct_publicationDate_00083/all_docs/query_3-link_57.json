        "text": "Subtitled \"A Mobile Utopia\", this pioneering novel about the meaning of space habitats for human history, presents spacefaring as no work did in its time, and since.\n\nA utopian novel like no other, presenting a dynamic utopian civilisation that transcends the failures of our history. Epic in scope, \"Macrolife\" opens in the year 2021. The Bulero family owns one of Earth's richest corporations. As the Buleros gather for a reunion at the family mansion, an industrial accident plunges the corporation into a crisis, which eventually brings the world around them to the brink of disaster.\n\nVilified, the Buleros flee to a space colony where young Richard Bulero gradually realises that the only hope for humanity lies in macrolife - mobile, self-reproducing space habitats. A millennium later, these mobile communities have left our sunspace and multiplied. Conflicts with natural planets arise. John Bulero, a cloned descendant of the twenty-first century Bulero clan, falls in love with a woman from a natural world and experiences the harshness of her way of life. He rediscovers his roots when his mobile returns to the solar system, and a tense confrontation of three civilisations takes place.\n\nOne hundred billion years later, macrolife, now as numerous as the stars, faces the impending death of nature. Regaining his individuality, but falling away from a highly evolved macrolife, a strangely changed John Bulero struggles to see beyond a collapse of the universe into a giant black hole. Inspired by the possibilities of space settlements, projections of biology and cosmology, and basic human longings, \"Macrolife\" is a visionary speculation on the long-term future of human and natural history. Filled with haunting images and memorable characters, this is a vivid and brilliant work.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nPaperback, good condition. Some wear to cover edges, slight foxing on pages.\n\nPublished by Futura, 1980.\n\nISBN: 0708880606"
