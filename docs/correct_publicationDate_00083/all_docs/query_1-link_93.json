One of these fans is Thomas N Scortia, who writes in the introduction to this volume: \"I have watched George Zebrowski's body of work grow for five years. The distance he has travelled in half a decade is impressive. The rate at which his talent is growing makes me impatient to see the product of his talent twenty years from now. I have watched Zebrowski grow artistically to become one of the leaders of the new generation of science fiction writers:- (original cost $1.50).\n\nMass Market Paperback. Condition: Good. P/B 170 pages, condition is good, remainder marks to the edge of the pages. The Isolation Station and Preserve on Antares IV had only one prisoner, a three foot tall gnome like biped with skin like creased leather and eyes like great glass globes. His hair was silky white and reached down to he shoulders, and he usually went about the great natural park naked. The gnome was very old, but no one had yet determined quite how old. And there seemed no way to find out. The gnome had never volunteered any information about his past. In the one hundred years of his imprisonment he had never asked the caretaker anything. The small staff of Earthmen and humanoids generally avoided him. sometimes they would watch his small figure standing looking up at the giant disk of Antares hanging blood red on the horizon, and they would wonder what he was thinking. The most important fact about the alien was that sometime in the remote past he had been responsible for the construction of the solar system and the emergence of intelligent life on earth."
