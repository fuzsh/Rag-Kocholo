        "text": "What to know before purchasing an ePub\n\nAn ePub is an open industry format known for its compatibility across e-readers and other devices, though accessing this file type does require an app or software to read. This file type is not a one-click reading experience such as a PDF or similar. View our ePub Guide to learn more. Once you purchase and then download your file from your confirmation email from us, you will not be able to immediately open and read it without one of these apps or services.\n\nNote: Kindle readers can and should purchase ePub files to read on their Kindle devices or via the Kindle app. As of August 2022, Amazon no longer supports mobi files.\n\nGeorge Zebrowski’s more than 40 books include the Campbell Award winner for best novel of the year, Brute Orbits; the classic Macrolife and its companion Cave of Stars; various anthologies edited with Isaac Asimov, Gregory Benford, Jack Dann and Thomas N. Scortia; and the five volumes of the legendary Synergy series. His award-nominated short fiction has been collected in the Publishers Weekly-starred Swift Thoughts, in In the Distance, and Ahead in Time and in Black Pockets (Golden Gryphon). A new edition of Macrolife (with an introduction by Ian Watson and an afterword by the author) has been published by Pyr, a division of Prometheus Books."
