        "text": "Which books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. The Shockwave Rider, John Brunner (1975)\n\nFrom the back cover: “Future shock!\n\nIn the obsessively technological, paranoidally secretive and brutally competitive society depicted by John Brunner, even personal identities are under threat. But one man has made it his mission to liberate the mental prisoners, to restore their freedom in a world run mad.\n\nNickie Haflinger, the only person to escape from Tarnover–where they raise hyper-intelligent children to maintain the political dominance of the USA in the 21st century–is on the run, dodging from loophole to crevise to crack in the computerised datanet that binds the continent like chains. After years of flight and constant changes of identity, at the strange small town called Precipice he discovers he is not alone in his quest. But can his new allies save him when he falls again into the sinister grasp of Tarnover…?”\n\nInitial Thoughts: I read John Brunner’s The Shockwave Rider (1972) before I started my site–along with his other masterpieces Stand on Zanzibar (1968), The Sheep Look Up (1972), The Jagged Orbit (1969), The Whole Man (196), etc. Of his best known novels, I remember the least about The Shockwave Rider. However, I cannot find my copy for a rare reread! For all I know I gave it to a friend or lost it in a move. I sought out this UK edition due to the intriguing urban arcology background of the cover.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhich books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Macrolife, George Zebrowski (1979)\n\nFrom the inside flap: “A novel of epic scope, Macrolife opens in the year 2021. The Bulero family owns one of Earth’s richest corporations. As the Buleros gather for a reunion at the family mansion, an industrial accident plunges the corporation into a crisis, which eventually brings the world around them to the brink of disaster. Vilified, the Buleros flee to a space colony where the young Richard Bulero gradually realizes that the only hope for humanity lies in macrolife—mobile, self-reproducing space habitats.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis anthology contains the 4th post in a loose series on SF short stories that are critical in some capacity of space agencies, astronauts, and the culture which produced them. I decided to review the entire anthology!\n\nPreviously: William Tenn’s “Down Among the Dead Men” (1954).\n\nUp Next: Theodore Sturgeon’s “The Man Who Lost the Sea” (1959)\n\n3/5 (Collated rating: Average)\n\nRobert Hoskins “resurrected” Infinity Science Fiction magazine (1955-1958) as a five volume anthologies series between 1970-1973. The first volume, Infinity One (1970), contains sixteen original stories and one reprint from the original magazine–Arthur C. Clarke’s “The Star” (1955). SF Encyclopedia describes the anthology series as “a competent but not outstanding series.”\n\nEight of the seventeen stories fall into the “good” category. While none are masterpieces, Robert Silverberg, Arthur C. Clarke, Barry N. Malzberg co-writing with Kris Neville, Katherine MacLean, Gene Wolfe, and Poul Anderson Continue reading →\n\n(Paul Alexander’s cover for the 1977 edition)\n\n2.75/5 (collated rating: Vaguely Average)\n\nA while back I picked up a copy of George Zebrowski’s The Monadic Universe (1977) for my friend 2theD at Potpourri of Science Fiction Literature to supplement his suitcase of SF books he buys every year before heading back to Thailand. Before I sent it to him I read a single story “The History Machine” (1972) and was intrigued enough to buy the collection for myself.\n\nBluntly put Zebrowski’s post-apocalyptical, polluted, environment going to hell futures are dull and resort to random violence, sinister women characters, and lengthy information dumps. The stories containing metaphysical thought-experiments are slightly more successful although the lack of articulate prose weakens their power. I only recommend three Continue reading →"
