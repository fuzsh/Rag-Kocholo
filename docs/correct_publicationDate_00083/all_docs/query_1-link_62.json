        "text": "Illustrated Color Frontispiece by Bob Eggleton\n\nIntroduction by Gregory Benford\n\nEaston Press, Norwalk CT. 2002 George Zebrowski \"Swift Thoughts\" Signed First Edition of only 1075 signed and numbered copies, this being number 404.\n\nGet your thinking caps on. George Zebrowski's Swift Thoughts is full of science fiction stories that will leave you questioning both yourself and the world around you. And since this is SF, it will leave you wondering just what it is that the future holds for us.\n\nThere is also fun to be had. \"The Word Sweep\" leads off the collection with a metaphorical world in which spoken words have become actual objects, leaving city streets cluttered with piles of spoken clutter. Another fun one is \"Stooges\", which, in a manner very reminiscent of Howard Waldrop at his best, manages to connect Curly Howard with a strange tale of alien contact. It's a treat for Three Stooges fans everywhere.\n\nAbout the author\n\nGeorge Zebrowski (born December 28, 1945) is a science fiction author and editor who has written and edited a number of books, and is a former editor of The Bulletin of the Science Fiction Writers of America. He lives with author Pamela Sargent, with whom he has co-written a number of novels, including Star Trek novels.\n\nZebrowski won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1999 for his novel Brute Orbits. Three of his short stories, \"Heathen God,\" \"The Eichmann Variations,\" and \"Wound the Wind,\" have been nominated for the Nebula Award, and \"The Idea Trap\" was nominated for the Theodore Sturgeon Award."
