        "text": "This pioneering novel about the meaning of space habitats for human history presents spacefaring as no work had in its time - or has since. A utopian novel like no other, presenting a dynamic utopian civilization that transcends the failures of our history.\n\nEpic in scope, Macrolife opens in the year 2021. The Bulero family owns one of Earth's richest corporations. As the Buleros gather for a reunion at the family mansion, an industrial accident plunges the corporation into crisis, which eventually brings the world around them to the brink of disaster. Vilified, the Buleros flee to a space colony where young Richard Bulero gradually realizes that the only hope for humanity lies in macrolife - mobile, self-reproducing space habitats.\n\nA millennium later, these mobile communities have left our sunspace and multiplied. Conflicts with natural planets arise. John Bulero, a cloned descendant of the 21st century Bulero clan, falls in love with a woman from a natural world and experiences the harshness of her way of life. He rediscovers his roots when his mobile returns to the solar system, and a tense confrontation of three civilisations takes place.\n\nOne hundred billion years later, macrolife, now as abundant as the stars, faces the impending death of nature. Regaining his individuality, but falling away from a highly evolved macrolife, a strangely changed John Bulero struggles to see beyond a collapse of the universe into a giant black hole."
