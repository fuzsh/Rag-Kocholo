        "text": "French impressionism in cinema it replaced industrial film in France in the 1920s. The production of French films in the 1920s decreases drastically. Cinema is produced much more in the United States and Germany.\n\nPathè and Gaumont, which had been the first industrial film production companies in history, dedicated themselves to the distribution and production of technical materials, abandoning film production.\n\nThey had replaced the artistic cinema of Melies and the other artisans of the early cinema, had established themselves on the market with arrogance to produce films for the general public. But things hadn’t worked out as they thought.\n\nIndustrial films often had very high costs and financial failures were frequent. Executives of Pathé and Gaumont had realized that they could risk much less by dedicating themselves to distribution than by making new films.\n\nAlthough in the mid-1920s France produced only about fifty feature films and the United States 729, there was great cultural ferment on the streets of Paris and other cities. More film clubs were born than in any other part of the world. There was the possibility of attending debates, film reviews, magazines were born avant-garde.\n\nThe France that had invented cinema continued to love it above all as an art form. The French were interested in discovering cinema and establishing a link between this art and the intellectual world.\n\nImpressionism and French Art Cinema\n\nFrench cinema takes the form of new avant-gardes such as impressionism. The first films reflecting on cinema from a theoretical and artistic point of view are made. Cinema is conceived as an art of research and experimentation, directors are not mere craftsmen but develop a theoretical and critical awareness of their art.\n\nThe impressionists French directors are the creators of the most original and avant-garde ideas of the 1920s. Cinema is conceived as a mix of other arts such as music and painting, while the connection with the theater is rejected. The art what most resembles cinema is music because it is a temporal and rhythmic art. Instead of musical notes, he lives on figurative rhythms, creative combinations of multiple elements, dynamic rhythms of light and images.\n\nImpressionist Cinema as a Symphony\n\nHuman bodies, sets, objects, camera movement move in the film. All these elements intertwine and add up to produce a coherent show across the spaces of the image. Cinema is a great symphony, to be built with rhythm and musicality. The music of the montage and within the individual shots. Rhythm of sequences, scenes and shots that make up the symphony of the entire film. But also the rhythm and temporal scansion of the stories told.\n\nAbel Gance gives a very significant definition of cinema. He says: “it is the music of light”. A definition on which the greatest directors of the cinema history also in the following years. Director Delluc instead theorizes that the main quality of cinema is photogenic. He defines photogenic any character, object or landscape that enhances its moral quality through the reproduction of the cinematic image. A way of filming a subject in its immediacy and deepest authenticity.\n\nImpressionism and the Nineteenth-Century Tale\n\nThe cinematic impressionism of French directors deals mostly with nineteenth-century stories told in a traditional and romantic way. Fairly formulaic stories able to reach a large audience. These are dramas that tell of social constraints, moralisms that cause personal dissatisfaction and the inability to achieve one’s desires.\n\nThese are films that today appear very dated such as The Rose of the Rails, by Abel Gance, the story of the incestuous passion of a railway worker for a young woman. Or Futurism by l’Herbier, which tells the story of a deceitful and manipulative woman. Films superficially inspired by popular novels and decadent literature.\n\nOther works are more successful, such as Fever from 1921, and The smiling Madame Beudet, from 1937, both by Delluc. The Fall of House Usher, 1928, by Jean Epstein, based on the short story by Edgar Allan Poe. Other films focus on the cinematic potential to investigate the psyche and the inner world of the characters. Like the experimental film The Madness of Doctor Tube, from 1916, by Abel Gance or Eldorado by L’Herbier.\n\nThe Impressionist Cinema of Abel Gance\n\nSome directors like Abel Gance claim a more original personality. Gance creates large frescoes, expensive films from a production point of view, which experiment with new languages ​​and new potential of cinema. For example, the accelerated assembly of mechanical components in action in the film The Rose on the Rails. The director focuses on rhythm and movement with shots of contraptions in action.\n\nA cinematographic montage made up of ever shorter shots and a fast pace. Napoleon, from 1927, is the most expensive blockbuster of the time in France. The film chronicles Napoleon’s military conquests with a focus on his individual story. There are also flashbacks from his childhood that delve into the emperor’s psychology.\n\nScenes dedicated to the French Revolution mix with the character’s narrative, culminating in grandiose battle scenes. Despite being a film that tells a piece of French history in the traditional way, there are a long series of directorial techniques and inventions in it. It is one of the peaks of experimental cinema in the history of cinema. Perhaps the film that experiences best in the silent cinema period. Abel Gance’s camera is extremely dynamic his movements are more elaborate than in any other film seen before. For the first time we see the split screen used in an exemplary way: the projection is divided into three screens simultaneously.\n\nMarcel L’Herbier\n\nAnother very interesting director of French impressionism is Marcel L’Herbier. His cinema is a search for complex images that are enriched with models taken from other arts. In your film Futurism there is a sequence in which you tell a science fiction experiment that allows the resurrection of the protagonist.\n\nThe accelerated editing gives the scene a hyper-modern style that connects to technological processes. Images of mechanical equipment in the laboratory in a crescendo of visual effects of great rhythmic intensity. Images, details, lights and chromatic effects that show great expressive and dynamic strength. Sci-fi and modernist sets that represent the future perspective of the film. A universe stimulated by the artistic innovations and modern taste of Paris in 1924, where a major exhibition dedicated to innovative arts is held.\n\nThe sets of the film seem to take us into a large art gallery. There is a variety of architectural styles influenced by art deco, futurism and rationalism. In 1929 L’Herbier made “Money”L’Argent”, a very expensive film that recounted the mechanisms of economic power and its conflicts. Filmed in huge spaces with images of great breadth and spectacularity, L’Herbier concentrates more on narrative effects and the dynamism of the camera than experimenting with editing. Modernist shots that develop an idea of ​​cinema inherited from Futurism, composing complex and rigorous figures.\n\nThe Impressionism of Epstein, Kirsanoff, Cavalcanti\n\nJean Epstein, on the other hand, alternated his activity as a director with that of a theorist and writer. His cinema is a search for states of mind, for fleeting impressions, for the mutation of feelings that follow the psychological dynamics of the characters.\n\nAn impressionism that focuses on the flow and becoming of things, with a light touch, investigating human feelings and sensations. Absolutely special films dedicated to mysterious characters, their psychological crises and their inner changes.\n\nLike Faithful Heart, from 1923, a film with images and close-ups of rare beauty. The woman the protagonist of the film is in love with is forced to be married off by an overbearing drunkard. The protagonist ends up in prison and when he gets out he finds the woman he loves with a newborn baby. The two lovers dream of changing their lives but the bully controls the woman’s life with violence. A melodrama set in Marseille, in a port where gigantic ships and fishing boats move behind the characters. Masterful framing and editing, full of inventions and poetry, sudden bursts of rhythm. A poignant and melancholy visual symphony, a masterpiece of French impressionism, made with very few means and enormous inspiration.\n\nJean Epstein also made The Beautiful Nivernese, from 1924. The three-faced mirror from 1927 presents us with the protagonist with 3 different images through the gaze of three women with exceptional narrative ability.\n\nHis other films such as Finisterre of 1929, and The Sea of Crows of 1929, are instead poems about nature and the sea that go beyond the simple documentary. These films transform the image into a search for truth. Directors who develop a similar style are, for example, Cavalcanti and Kirsanoff, who are committed to creating a cinema in balance between documentary and fiction, mixing reality and staging, acted materials and documentary films, to create extraordinary visual symphonies. A style that many years later would be developed in a different form from independent filmmakers like Italian Franco Piavoli.\n\nKirsanoff makes astonishing visual poems. He transforming reality into musical rhythms. In the 1925 film Menilmontant, for example, he rigorously searches for the invisible, giving up telling any story to concentrate on experimenting with optical effects. In a similar way, Alberto Cavalcanti, in the 1926 film En rade, mixes micro-stories and searches for rhythms and visions to make cinema a revealing tool of reality.\n\nWith Rien que les heures of 1927, he created a visual symphony dedicated to the city of Paris. Fragments of metropolitan life, real situations, apparently random heterogeneous images, scraps, fragments of stories connected to each other to tell a story of chance and fatality. Cavalcanti prefers secondary images and little frequented itineraries. A narrative and avant-garde, experimental cinema, characterized by great research which, however, did not meet the success of the public, remaining forgotten for a long time.\n\nImpressionist Films not to Be Missed\n\nHere is an exhaustive list of all the best impressionist films that every cinephile and lover of avant-garde cinema shouldn’t miss.\n\nThe Madness of Doctor Tube (1916)\n\nThe Madness of Doctor Tube is a 1916 silent film directed by Abel Gance.
