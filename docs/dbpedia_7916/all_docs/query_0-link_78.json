        "text": "Over the years, the Hindi film industry has given us some meticulously crafted Oscar-nominated Indian movies that spoke to a global audience and will remain favourites for years to come. While there is a long list of diverse submissions from the nation for the annual Academy Awards, only a few have made it to the final nominations list so far. Ahead of the 95th Academy Awards, scheduled for March 13, 2023 at 5:30 AM IST, we take you through the list of iconic Bollywood and Indian films that have made the cut over the years.\n\nMother India (1957)\n\nOne of the most expensive Bollywood productions of its time, Mother India earned the highest revenue for any Indian film up until the release of Mughal-e-Azam (1960), and was nominated under the Best Foreign Language Film category. This epic drama film, directed by Mehboob Khan, starred Nargis, Sunil Dutt, Raaj Kumar, and Rajendra Kumar. The story portrays a post-independence rural India through the lens of a poverty-stricken family.\n\nThe House That Ananda Built (1969)\n\nThis short documentary film, directed by Fali Bilimoria, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. The narrative takes you through the life of a typical Oriya family in rural Nagpur, spotlighting the life of a peasant and his relationships with his family members.\n\nAn Encounter with faces (1979)\n\nThe visionary director Vidhu Vinod Chopra manages to leave an indelible mark with his short documentary film, An Encounter With Faces. It revolves around a group of children in an orphanage, capturing their experiences and their socio-economic plight, through the lens of the children themselves. The film was nominated in 1978 for an Academy Award under the category of Documentary Short Subject.\n\nSalaam Bombay! (1989)\n\nThis critically acclaimed movie was rewarded with a nomination in the Best Foreign Language Film category in 1989. Directed, co-written, and co-produced by Mira Nair in collaboration with Sooni Taraporevala, the film gives you a deep insight into the world of drugs, prostitution and child labour in the slums of India.\n\nLagaan: Once Upon a Time in India (2001)\n\nBeing one of the most popular Oscar-nominated Indian movies, Lagaan needs no introduction. Both critically and commercially acclaimed, this fiction period drama has long been a favourite among Indian audiences. The Aamir Khan-starrer follows a small group of village folk, who challenge a newly imposed land tax by competing against British rulers in a cricket championship. It was nominated under the Best Foreign Language Film Category.\n\nLittle Terrorist (2004)\n\nCritically acclaimed film Little Terrorist was written, directed, and produced by Aswin Kumar, son of fashion designer Ritu Kumar, and was nominated in the Best Live Action Short Film category at the Academy Awards. Jamal, a 12-year-old Muslim Pakistani mistakenly crosses the Indian border and befriends a Hindu Brahmin, Bhola, and the short film revolves around his beautiful journey.\n\nThe White Tiger (2021)\n\nThis 2021 drama film, written and directed by Ramin Bahrani, stars Adarsh Gourav, Priyanka Chopra (co-producer), and Rajkummar Rao. The movie—a commentary on classism and casteism in India—follows the protagonist Balram Halwai (Gourav) on his escape from poverty to become a successful entrepreneur in modern-day India. Last year, The White Tiger was nominated in the Best Adapted Screenplay category.\n\nWriting with Fire (2021)\n\nEarning a well-deserved nomination in the Best Documentary Feature category for the highly-anticipated 94th Academy Awards is the gritty Writing with Fire, which sheds the light on a group of strong female journalists who belong to the Dalit community. The documentary follows chief reporter Meera's tumultuous journey as she paves her way in a male-dominated news landscape.\n\nAll That Breathes (2022)\n\nNominated under the Best Documentary category at the Oscars 2023, Shaunak Sen’s All That Breathes follows the lives of brothers Nadeem and Saud, and their assistant Salik, who’ve dedicated their lives to rescuing black kites even as AQI levels climb and sectarian violence intensifies in the capital city of India. With its observational tone and built with the patience of a bird-watcher, the documentary is a compelling watch, not just for its subject, but also for the breathtaking imagery.\n\nThe Elephant Whisperers (2022)\n\nKartiki Gonsalves’s The Elephant Whisperers takes us deep inside the 140-year-old Theppakadu elephant camp in Tamil Nadu to meet Bomman and Bellie, who lovingly rear baby elephants that have strayed from their tribe. Nominated for Best Documentary Short at the Oscars 2023, it presents a poignant portrayal of how human intervention changes an animal’s life but also highlights the profound effect that animals have on humans.\n\nRRR (2022)\n\nSS Rajamouli’s masterpiece RRR, although hopeful of a best picture nom, scored one for best original song for MM Keeravaani’s composition “Naatu Naatu” (which already has a Golden Globe under its belt). Set in the 1920s, the film follows the unlikely friendship of Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.), two Indian freedom fighters who come together to revolt against the British Raj. The high-octane “Naatu Naatu” appears as a sequence in the movie when Bheem’s dancing capabilities are ridiculed at a royal party, leading to an electrical dance-off between the protagonists. The dance number will also be performed live at the Oscars 2023 ceremony.\n\nSpecial mention: Chhello Show (2022)\n\nIndia’s official entry to the Oscars 2023, the Chhello Show is the heartwarming story of Samay, a young boy in rural Gujarat who is enraptured and captured by the power of cinema when his father takes the family to watch a movie called Goddess Mahakali. The year is 2010; movies were still shot using film cameras and played through a film projector back then, and the protagonist instantly becomes enamoured by the magic of celluloid and desires to pursue it as a career. Sadly, it did not make the noms cut but is, regardless, a film that merits a watch.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHow to win an Oscar\n\nPriyanka Chopra opted for bohemian waves for the South Asian Excellence celebration ahead of Oscars 2023\n\nThe Oscars 2023: India’s nominations reflect a heightened empathy for wildlife\n\nThe 51 best Oscars red carpet dresses of all time"
