Depending on who you ask, some individuals have never given \"Old Hollywood\" a chance because they believe the films to be boring, slow, and less technical compared to what we're getting now. That's well within their right to think that as we all have our preferences, but I want to encourage a different outlook. The early decades of film are an example of literally doing the best with what you've got as there was limited resources and no prior to examples to pull from. As such, I do believe from a creativity and storytelling standpoint that we got some of the most innovative creations during the early decades, and that's part of what makes the era so fascinating in my opinion. Also, if you look hard enough, it won't take you look to find the original versions of some of your favorite films/film franchises (Dracula for example), and it can be fascinating to witness the evolution over time. To that point, we've put together a list of the best movies of the 1920s to add to your watchlist.\n\nThe 1920s aka the \"Roaring Twenties\" film-wise were a mixture of silent films and the introduction of \"talkies\" (movies where you could actually the hear the dialogue between actors) towards the end of the decade. These movies are some of the best from that time period to get you started. Scroll down to check them out.\n\nRELATED: How the Last Blockbuster Store Became a Tourist Location\n\nHow did we pick the best movies of the 1920s?\n\n1. \"The Winning of Barbara Worth\" (1926)\n\nThe Samuel Goldwyn Company\n\nDirected by: Henry King\n\nStarring: Ronald Colman, Vilma Bánky, Gary Cooper\n\nIMDB Rating: 7\n\nWatch it if you like: La La Land\n\nWhat it's about: A young woman caught between the affection of two men\n\nStarring Ronald Colman, Vilma Bánky, and Gary Cooper, The Winning of Barbara Worth is a silent Western film that focuses on the story of a young woman named Barbara (Bánky), who has always dreamed of irrigating the desert.

His fiancee (McGuire) gets robbed by a thief and unfortunately for the projectionist, he gets framed by the robber for the crime. Now, the poor projectionist must use a detective skills to track the thief, but it doesn't work out. So what does he do next? Well, he falls asleep and dreams that he becomes Sherlock Holmes. Interesting response, but one that entertains us viewers.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n4. \"The Pony Express\" (1925)\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nDirected by: James Cruze\n\nStarring: Ricardo Cortez, Betty Compson, Wallace Beery\n\nIMDB Rating: 5.9\n\nWatch it if you like: Dead for a Dollar\n\nWhat it's about: A manipulative senator that wants to get his way\n\nThere's always been a lot of interest surrounding the Pony Express, so in 1925 a silent western was created to explore the concept even more.

Maggie becomes interested in Joe, but things start to get messy when she finds out Joe not only has a significant other but is also engaged (how nice of him to not tell her). Maggie leaves the relationship (and rightfully so), but Joe is determined to win her back. Does he succeed? You'll have to watch the film for that, but we will say that somebody gets their heart broken.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON YOUTUBE\n\n6. \"Nosferatu\" (1922)\n\nFilm Arts Guild\n\nDirected by: F.W. Marnau\n\nStarring: Max Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, Greta Schroeder\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.9\n\nWatch it if you like: Dracula\n\nWhat it's about: A creepy rich guy that's really a vampire\n\nWhile Nosferatu was originally loosely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, it has since taken on a life of its own when it comes to classic horror films. Starring Max Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, and Greta Schroeder, the eccentric Count Orlok (Schreck) summons a man ( von Wangenheim) to his remote Transylvanian castle. From there, he decides to buy a house near and the man and his wife, proceeding to reveal he's a vampire and causing the couple terror. Nosferatu was directed by F.W.

You can thank The Man Who Laughs for that which is about a man who was disfigured by a king when he was a child. As a result, he becomes a clown traveling as part of a traveling carnival. The man is actually referred to as a \"freak show,\" but that's kind of mean don't you think? Well, at least he's able to find somebody who loves him just the way he is, which is an important lesson about not prioritizing and judging the physical over what's on the inside. The lesson sounds cliche, but it seems we've been missing the mark as of late in a lot of different areas.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n8. \"The Cat and the Canary\" (1927)\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nDirected by: Paul Leni\n\nStarring: Laura La Plante, Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.1\n\nWatch it if you like: Boiler Room\n\nWhat it's about: A woman that inherits a wealth man's estate\n\nAnother 1920s horror film, The Cat and the Canary is about a group of relatives that gather at the estate of a recently deceased loved one to discuss his will.

The movie tells the story of Prince Achmed's magical adventures, and is regarded for its usage of silhouette animation technique. For those wondering, silhouette animation technique is where cut out figures come to life through color prismatic manipulation. The result is a relatively \"shadowy\" look of the characters where you can only see their black silhouette against a colorful background. By the way, does this remind you of a certain legendary Disney movie? We'll help you—The Lion King. See why we said earlier studying older films are fascinating?\n\nWhile the movie isn't available on streaming, and you watch certain clips through places like YouTube.\n\n10. \"Three Bad Men\" (1926)\n\n20th Century Studios\n\nDirected by: John Ford\n\nStarring: Tom Santschi, J. Farrell MacDonald, Olive Borden\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.5\n\nWatch it if you like: Three Men and a Baby\n\nWhat it's about: Two outlaws that become the guardians to a young girl who's father is murdered\n\nConsidered to be one of John Ford's best works, Three Bad Men is about three outlaws that come to the rescue of a young girl when her father gets brutally murdered. Two of the outlaws end up becoming a guardian to the young girl, leaving behind their criminal pasts to take care of her completely. A heart tugging story that's sort of an early prelude to films like Three Men and a Baby. The movie was released in 1926, and still receives high praise to this day.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n11. \"The Circus\" (1928)\n\nUnited Artists\n\nDirected by: Charlie Chaplin\n\nStarring: Charlie Chaplin, Allan Garcia, Merna Kennedy\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.1\n\nWatch it if you like: The Greatest Showman\n\nWhat it's about: A man on the run from the police who joins the circus\n\nA Charlie Chaplin production, 1928's The Circus is considered to be one of his best films from both a directorial and acting standpoint, as he stars as a man wrongfully accused of being a criminal. The chase from the police leads him into a big top where he begins entertaining circus goers by just simply being himself (not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing by the way). This leads to the man getting employed by the circus and falling in love along the way. Classic Charlie Chaplin.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n12.

She then decides to go to Paris anyway, where she meets and becomes a mistress to wealthy man (Menjou). Roughly a year later, her former fiancee shows up again, and now the woman is forced to choose between her old love and her new one who's...taken. Kind of messy but whatever.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n13. \"Napoleon\" (1927)\n\nMGM\n\nDirected by: Abel Gance\n\nStarring: Albert Dieudonne\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.2\n\nWatch it if you like: The Last Duel\n\nWhat it's about: The life of Napoleon Bonaparte\n\nDirected by Abel Gance, 1928's Napoleon is about the early life and beginnings of Napoleon Bonaparte. Albert Dieudonne stars as the titular character, with the film spanning from his childhood to the end of military campaign in Italy. Full of great cinematic shots and a haunting score, Napoleon is very much a film that was ahead of its time in many ways. Unfortunately the movie isn't available on streaming, but we're hoping that's something that changes soon.\n\n14. The Ten Commandments (1923)\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nDirected by: Cecil B. DeMille\n\nStarring: Theodore Roberts, Charles De Roche, Richard Dix, Rod La Rocque, Edythe Chapman\n\nIMDB Rating: 6.8\n\nWatch it if you like: 13 Commandments\n\nWhat it's about: Moses and a contractor that's living a life of sin\n\nReleased in 1923, The Ten Commandments actually tells two different stories within its 2hr and 16 min runtime.

When the contractor's mother passes away, it leads to him wanting to live a life of redemption. Unfortunately for him he's just a bit too late and has more consequences coming as a result of his actions.\n\n16. \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928)\n\nSociété Générale des Films\n\nDirected by: Carl Theodore Dreyer\n\nStarring: Renee Falconetti, Eugene Silvain, Jean d'Yd\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.1\n\nWatch it if you like: Joan of Arc (2019)\n\nWhat it's about: The story of Joan of Arc\n\nAnother 20s classic considered to be among the best released during the decade, The Passion of Joan of Arc stars Renee Falconetti, Eugene Silvain, and Jean d'Yd and is about a 15th-century teenager (Falconetti) on trial and subjected to torture due to claiming that she's spoken to God. While the teen changes her story at first, she then decides she's no longer going to be bullied and goes back to her original claims, which ultimately leads to her being executed and turned into a martyr. A sad story for sure, but still renowned for its storytelling and visuals.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n17.

Gray is now forced to chase after them in order to get his fiancee back. Slightly military and slightly romantic, The General is truly a great film that deserves more recognition across the board.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n20. \"Faust\" (1926)\n\nMGM\n\nDirected by: F.W.

Innovative camera shots are at the forefront of this film, with the doc being solely centered on the city. There's no titles, narration, or characters, it's just simply the city and its respective sounds. The camera shots are stunning and frankly way beyond its 1929 release date. We understand if these types of films aren't exactly your thing, but you should definitely give this one a shot.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON APPLE TV\n\n22. \"Safety Last\" (1923)\n\nPathé Exchange\n\nDirected by: Dziga Vertov\n\nStarring: Fred C. Newmeyer, Sam Taylor\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.1\n\nWatch it if you like: Bringing Up Baby\n\nWhat it's about: A man that needs to make money to survive in NYC\n\nSafety Last is admittedly slightly idiotic and full of not-so-great choices, and that's what makes it so funny. The film stars Harold Lloyd as a young man who moves to NYC to support his girlfriend, and quickly figures out that moving to the city ain't exactly cheap. One day he overhears where a store manager is willing to pay $1,000 to anyone who can draw customers to his store. This leads to the man deciding to become \"the human fly,\" which consists of him climbing and hanging from a building like a fly. Like we said, slightly idiotic and full of not-so-great choices. He does draw attention though so maybe we're the ones who aren't that smart.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n23. \"Underworld\" (1927)\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nDirected by: Josef von Sternberg\n\nStarring: George Bancroft\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.5\n\nWatch it if you like: Casino\n\nWhat it's about: A gangster trying to rehabilitate his lawyer\n\nA drama/comedy, Underworld stars George Bancroft as the a gangster kingpin Bull Weed taking on the task of trying to rehabilitate his lawyer who has a drinking problem. He's rather unsuccessful in his quest, but things get even more complicated with the lawyer begins falling for Bull's girlfriend. Something tell us it's probably not a good idea to hit on the girlfriend of a gangster. Just our intuition talking to us a little bit.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON TUBI\n\n24. \"High and Dizzy\" (1920)\n\nPathé Exchange\n\nDirected by: Hal Roach\n\nStarring: Harold Lloyd\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.5\n\nWatch it if you like: Cycles South\n\nWhat it's about: A drunk doctor trying to save one of his patients\n\nIf High and Dizzy sounds like a film full of chaos, that's because it is a film full of chaos. A comedy short starring Harold Lloyd, High and Dizzy is about a doctor who gets drunk on... homemade liquor. So he goes on about his drunken day and finds one of his patients sleepwalking on a ledge that is almost certainly high enough to kill her if she falls. Now the doctor has to figure out a way to save her, but once again, he's...drunk. Chaotic.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n25. \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1925)\n\nChadwick Pictures\n\nDirected by: Larry Semon\n\nStarring: Dorothy Dwan, Frank Alexander, Joseph Swickard\n\nIMDB Rating: 4.9\n\nWatch it if you like: Emerald City\n\nWhat it's about: Dorothy and the gang going to the magical kingdom of Oz\n\nThey're off to see the Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz! Before Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, you had Dorothy Dwan as, well, Dorothy. The 1925 version of The Wizard of Oz sees the Kansas farm girl leading the three farmhands to the magical kingdom of Oz. You might be spoiled from the 1939 version which includes wonderful visual and fun music, but there's value to be found in the short film version as well.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n26. \"Love\" (1927)\n\nMGM\n\nDirected by: Edmund Golding\n\nStarring: Greta Garbo, John Gilbert\n\nIMDB Rating: 6.9\n\nWatch it if you like: The Notebook\n\nWhat it's about: A married woman that falls in love with a soldier\n\nThe 1920s weren't complete without the works of Greta Garbo. One of her most popular films from the era is 1927's Love, where she portrayed Anna Karenina, the wife of a Russian nobleman who falls in love with a young soldier named Vronsky. Obviously a situation like this is going to present challenging dynamics, societal issues, and family drama. The only question is how does it end up turning out? Does she leave her husband? Does she decide the relationship with the soldier isn't worth leaving her marriage? Does the husband find out about the affair and end up leaving her? All great questions that you'll have to watch the movie for.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n27. The Flapper (1920)\n\nSelznick Pictures\n\nDirected by: Alan Crosland\n\nStarring: Olive Thomas\n\nIMDB Rating: 6.4\n\nWatch it if you like: Easy A\n\nWhat it's about: A wild young woman and her adventures\n\nThe Flapper is kind of like the 1920s silent film version of Easy A. In it, Olive Thomas stars as a \"wild\" (the 20s definition of wild at least) young woman named Ginger who gets sent away to a boarding school for flirting with a guy. She arrives at the boarding school and ends up...flirting with more guys. Then she ends up being the fall guy for a robbery. Needless to say, Ginger's life and decision making is just a little crazy. Fun, but crazy.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON SLING\n\n28. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923)\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nDirected by: Wallace Worsley\n\nStarring: Brandon Hurst, Patsy Ruth Miller, Lon Chaney, Norman Kerry\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.2\n\nWatch it if you like: Into the Woods\n\nWhat it's about: A hunchback that falls in love with a woman\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame but as a silent short perhaps? Set in 15th-century Paris, the film stars Lon Chaney as a Hunchback commanded by Jehan, the evil brother of the archdeacon (Hurst) to capture a woman he's in love with for him. The only problem is that the Hunchback and the woman end up falling for each other which as you can imagine displeases Jehan greatly. So what does he do? Well, he frames the woman for murdering somebody else that was also interested in courting her. He framed the woman he \"loved\" because he was mad bro. Yikes.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n29. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920)\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nDirected by: John S. Robertson\n\nStarring: John Barrymore, Brandon Hurst, Nita Naldi\n\nIMDB Rating: 6.9\n\nWatch it if you like: The Invisible Man\n\nWhat it's about: A doctor who creates another personality for himself\n\nLet's take it back to the 1920 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde shall we? With John Barrymore starring as both Jekyll and Hyde, the movie is about the rather uptight and serious Dr. Jekyll who gets \"inspired\" to create another identity for himself after getting aroused at a show he attends with his friend Sir George Carew (Hurst). He succeeds as creating the alternate persona Mr. Hyde, but Mr. Hyde doesn't just come out lustful, he comes out flat out evil. Barrymore's switching of personalities is rather masterful we have to say.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n30. Seven Chances (1925)\n\nMGM\n\nDirected by: Buster Keaton\n\nStarring: Buster Keaton, Ruth Dwyer\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.8\n\nWatch it if you like: The Hangover\n\nWhat it's about: A man that needs to get engaged to receive his inheritance\n\nAnother great Buster Keaton film is Seven Chances, which is also quite chaotic when you think about it. Keaton portrays stockbroker Jimmie Shannon who on the eve of his 27th birthday finds out that he's due to inherit $7 million dollars. However, he only gets that money if gets married before 7pm on the day of his birthday. He asks the woman he's been longing for his whole life (Dwyer) to marry him thinking that the money will entice her, but she turns him down. Undeterred, he sets out to find somebody random who will agree to the terms and conditions.
