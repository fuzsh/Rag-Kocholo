        "text": "Once movies hit the mainstream as popular and respectable middle class entertainment, it was inevitable that someone would start rounding them up into “Best of” lists. Photoplay magazine launched its own award, the Photoplay Medal of Honor, and asked readers to vote via mail-in ballot.\n\nSince we’re celebrating the films of 1920 this month, I thought it would be nice to provide you with a handy viewing list of what Photoplay’s editors thought were the best the movies had to offer. It was an American publication and so the selections were based on what was released in the USA. Also, release dates were a bit fluid back in the silent era so some films may be listed with different years attached to them in reference materials.\n\nThese films were not formal nominees but suggested titles that Photoplay published alongside the ballot. While readers were encouraged to write in whatever they liked, this list surely had some influence and so we are going to study it a but.\n\nFor easy reference, I have divided the list into three sections: on home media, surviving but not yet available to the public, and missing and presumed lost. All films are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nBut first, let’s start with the eventual winner. Two million ballots were cast but only one film could win.\n\nThe Photoplay Medal of Honor went to: Humoresque!\n\nPathos was big and so the choice of Humoresque is perfectly in keeping with the taste of the era. It was given a full melodramatic remake in 1946 with Joan Crawford in the lead but this version leans deeply into American Jewish culture. An early hit for Frank Borzage, who had pivoted from acting to directing, and an example of the continued success of screenwriter Frances Marion.\n\nReleased on DVD.\n\nThe Survivors\n\nThey’re here, they survive, we can see them any time we want.\n\nBehind the Door is a lean, mean, nasty piece of work with a justly famous finale that still shocks with its brutality. I won’t give the game away entirely but the hero is a taxidermist and his wife was murdered by his enemy. You do the math.\n\nRead my review here.\n\nReleased on DVD and Bluray.\n\nDinty follows the adventures of the young son of an Irish immigrant as he tries to support his mother (Colleen Moore) and also bust a Tong smuggling ring, as one does.\n\nAvailable on DVD and Bluray.\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is, well, you know. It was actually one of two adaptations released in 1920 but the Barrymore version is renowned for its innovative makeup and Barrymore’s enthusiastic performance.\n\nRead my review here.\n\nReleased on DVD and Bluray.\n\nEyes of Youth was a vehicle for star Clara Kimball Young but most people know it today as an early showcase for Rudolph Valentino, who played a ruthless gigolo.\n\nReleased on DVD and Bluray.\n\nThe Garage was a two-reel comedy from Arbuckle and Keaton and is one of the rare shorts on this list.\n\nReleased on DVD and Bluray.\n\nHeart o’ the Hills was a rural drama starring Mary Pickford and a young John Gilbert.\n\nReleased on DVD.\n\nThe Idol Dancer… I think my only response to this nomination is “lol, no.” While Clarine Seymour is an appealing star and Richard Barthelmess tries his best, the film is absolutely ridiculous and sloppily made to boot.\n\nRead my review here.\n\nReleased on DVD.\n\nThe Love Flower… Double lol here. You’re pulling my chain, Photoplay magazine. I mean, as an example of accidental hilarity, this is a masterpiece. But best of 1920?\n\nRead my review here.\n\nAvailable on DVD.\n\nThe Mollycoddle was the second-last of Douglas Fairbanks’ modern adventure-comedies. He next film was The Mark of Zorro and after one more modern picture, he dedicated the rest of his silent career to the costumed swashbuckler. Ironically, Zorro didn’t make the cut on this shortlist.\n\nReleased on DVD.\n\nPassion is an interesting one. It is technically the American release of Madame du Barry, the Ernst Lubitsch epic, but it was extensively cut and re-titled for the American audience and can almost be considered its own film. Both versions survive.\n\nYou can get the American release here and the original German cut here.\n\nPollyanna was another Mary Pickford vehicle and an adaptation of the popular story.\n\nAvailable on an out-of-print DVD.\n\nSomething to Think About was written around leading man Elliott Dexter’s recovery from a stroke. Cecil B. DeMille directed and Gloria Swanson was the leading lady.\n\nReleased on DVD.\n\nSuds is another Mary Pickford film, this one about a laundress who falls for a wealthy customer. Pickford was on fire in 1920, wasn’t she?\n\nReleased on DVD.\n\nThe Toll Gate was a return to form for William S. Hart. He had been experimenting with settings and pathos but this one was a dark tale of bloody revenge. Vengeful Hart is the best Hart and this is one of his finest pictures.\n\nRead my review here.\n\nAvailable on DVD.\n\nTrumpet Island was a late release from the once-dominant Vitagraph film company. An abridgement intended for home viewing survives.\n\nAvailable for digital purchase.\n\nWay Down East was another return to form with D.W. Griffith abandoning the South Seas in favor of ice floes.\n\nRead my review here.\n\nReleased on DVD and Bluray.\n\nWhy Change Your Wife? was a saucy bedroom farce from Cecil B. DeMille and it is an utter delight from beginning to end. The costumes, particularly the lingerie and swimwear, are worth the price of admission by themselves.\n\nRead my review here.\n\nReleased on DVD.\n\nThose are the films available for viewing. For your convenience, I will now list the unreleased and lost movies. Here’s hoping more of them are released to the public or found!\n\nThe Vaulties\n\nThey survive and may be screened at festivals but there’s no home media release. Still, they exist so here’s hoping!\n\n(I’ve had this issue come up before, so I should note that I do not link to online videos unless the channel is operated by an archive or a reputable collector. I don’t need to have my site flagged as an aggregator for pirated content. While a film may be in the public domain, music and some aspects of a restoration may not be and I don’t have time to vet every link. This isn’t personal, it’s simple self-preservation.)\n\nThe Copperhead\n\nA Cumberland Romance\n\nThe Dancin’ Fool\n\nDollars and the Woman\n\nEarthbound\n\nHuckleberry Finn\n\nIn Search of a Sinner\n\nJes’ Call Me Jim\n\nJubilo\n\nMadame X\n\nThe Overland Red\n\nOver the Hill to the Poorhouse\n\nThe River’s End\n\nThe Scoffer\n\nScratch My Back\n\nThe Virgin of Stamboul\n\nThe Lost\n\nCheck your attics and local Soviet archives.\n\nThe Branding Iron\n\nThe Devil’s Pass Key\n\nThe Gay Old Dog\n\nGreat Redeemer\n\nLuck of the Irish\n\nMan Who Lost Himself\n\nOn With the Dance\n\nThe Prince Chap\n\nRemodelling Her Husband\n\nThe Right of Way\n\nRomance\n\nThirteenth Commandment\n\n39 East\n\nTreasure Island\n\nThe Wonder Man\n\nThe World and His Wife\n\nSo, what do you think? Of the surviving films of 1920, which one deserved the medal in your opinion?\n\n☙❦❧\n\nLike what you’re reading? Please consider sponsoring me on Patreon.
