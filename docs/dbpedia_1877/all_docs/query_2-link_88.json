On 17 November 2005, her keel was laid down, and she was christened on 19 May 2007. The ship’s sponsor was Michelle Sterett Bernson, a familial descendant of Andrew Sterett, who himself had no children.\n\nHer commissioning took place in Baltimore, Maryland, Andrew Sterett’s birthplace, on 9 August 2008. The ship’s home port is Naval Base San Diego.\n\nThe ship was attacked without warning by Somali pirates using rocket-propelled grenades on 22 February 2011, during negotiations with the pirates for the release of four U.S. hostages, who were eventually killed."
