        "text": "(2 of 4)\n\n\"Go Tell the Bashaw.\" They learn pride bordering on arrogance. Daily they are reminded of the words and deeds of the U.S. NavyÂ—words like those of Lieut. Andrew Sterett, posted for their edification in Luce Hall: \"Go tell the Bashaw of Tripoli and the people of your country that in the future they may expect only a tribute of powder and ball from the sailors of the United States.\" They get the idea.\n\nThe best they learn is implicit in the vow they take, \"that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ... so help me God.\" The history of World War II is filled with the names of men who died in fulfillment of that solemn oath.\n\nThe Academy still turns out iron men. gentlemen and heroes.\n\nIn these matters Academy men felt no embarrassment last week. It was in the field of academics and of professional training for the future defense of the U.S. that they worried. Even before the atomic bomb, World War II had changed things.\n\nLock Step. The faculty had been strengthened with topnotch men drafted from civilian colleges. In 1941 the Academy had gathered unto itself J. Buroughs Stokes, a young educator with a doctor's degree from Harvard, had given him a commission and made him Assistant Secretary of the Academic Board.\n\nAs the draft hooked other educators, J. B. Stokes gaffed them and landed them on the Academy staff. Heads of departments remained, as always, regular Navy officers. But reserves and civilians took over the heaviest teaching load. The effect was refreshing. The difficulty the Academy now faces is keeping them on its staff. Many of them will go back to civilian colleges at the first chance.\n\nOne reason: the Academy's lock-step method of teaching. Daily, across the Yard, in & out of Luce, Dahlgren, Isherwood, Maury Halls, squads of midshipmen march to get their marks, file into class, sit down, open books, stand up, recite, sit down, stand up, march to the next class. The question (said Annapolis' critics on the inside) is not what they know but what they momentarily remember.\n\nHow Broad Is \"Broad\"? The Academy's rationalization of the system is that in no other way could midshipmen be crammed with all that is thought necessary. In four years of about 3,200 hours they are required to get satisfactory marks in seamanship, navigation, ordnance and gunnery, marine engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, one language (the only chance for an elective) and an abbreviated course called English, History & Government.\n\nHow well \"broad professional skills\" are developed is a question. Whether the content of courses is realistic in a modern day of atomic power is still another question. Even in its self-searching, the Academy, for the moment at least, rests its case with these words: \"When you're climbing rigging you don't let go one handhold until you've got another.\"\n\nOne Week for Air. In aviation, the Academy said, its mission is not to teach men to fly. Its mission is simply to familiarize midshipmen \"with the potentialities and limitations of air power.\""
