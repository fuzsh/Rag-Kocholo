        "text": "Men's Swimming\n\nFINAL SCHOOL RECORDS\n\nThe Illinois men’s swimming team competed from 1910-1993. Illinois won the Big Ten conference championship three years in a row in 1911, 1912 and 1913, which were the first three years the sport was recognized by the Big Ten Conference. During that three-year championship run, the team was led by swimmer Bill Vosburgh who won 10 individual conference championships and swam on two relay winners as well, setting conference records. Vosburgh’s best season is arguably the 1912 season when the Illini won their second straight Big Ten title. Vosburgh won four individual titles as a junior in the 40, 100, 220, and 440-yard events. In the final years of the program’s existence, Illinois was led by coaching legend and Illinois Swimming Hall of Famer, Don Sammons. During Sammons’ 22 years at Illinois every school record in men’s swimming was broken. Sammons coached seven All-Americans as well as seven Big Ten Conference champions. In 1974, Sammons was awarded the Illinois Swimming and Diving Association’s John Newman Award, which is the highest honor awarded in Illinois aquatics. One of the star swimmers that Sammons coached was Graeme McGufficke, who was a three-time Big Ten champion and three-time All-Big Ten honoree. McGufficke holds five varsity records including the 200, 500, 1000, and 1650 freestyle, as well as the 200 fly record. Another Illini swimming great was Joe Hunsaker, who was a two-time All-American and NCAA champion in the 1958 200-yard individual medley, and set the world record in the event prior to his senior season. During his senior year, Hunsaker set the American record. He also won two AAU national championships. Illinois’ other national champion was Jim Spreitzer, who won the 1963 NCAA title in the 220-yard freestyle.\n\nMen's Swimming Year-by-Year Records\n\nYear Dual Meet Big Ten Head Coach 1910-11 2-1 1st George B.

This list reflects the cumulative information contained within UI’s sports summary books for programs that have been retired. Team managers, who often earned varsity letters, have not been included due to inconsistent information. Female athletes are listed by their maiden names. As with any list of this magnitude, there could be inadvertent errors or omissions. Please contact the UI Athletic Public Relations office should you discover a mistake."
