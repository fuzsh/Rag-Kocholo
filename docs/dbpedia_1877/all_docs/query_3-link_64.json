        "text": "<< Click on the map to find your Division and Response Area.\n\nThe Response Area Team is designed to strengthen ownership and accountability for crime reduction and community safety. It enables officers to become more familiar with the people who live and work there, patterns of crime and suspect behaviors, and community resources that may be leveraged to address crime and quality of life issues.\n\nIf you want to report a crime and need police assistance in an emergency, dial 911.\n\nIf you want to report a crime or other information that does not require the police to respond to you or your location, please dial 311 (non-emergency crime reporting) or the Division Office line.\n\nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department jurisdiction is divided into 13 patrol divisions. Deputy Chief David Robinson oversees the Field Services Patrol Groups, including: Patrol Northeast - the University City, North Tryon, and Hickory Grove Divisions, Patrol Northwest - the Freedom, North and Metro Divisions, along with the Airport corridor, Patrol Southeast - the Central, Providence, Independence and Eastway Divisions, and Patrol Southwest - the Westover, Steele Creek, and South Divisions."
