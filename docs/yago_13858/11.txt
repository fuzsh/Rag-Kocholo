Bryce Dallas Howard took to social media this week to celebrate 21 years together with her husband Seth Gabel.

The actress, 40, shared two posts to Instagram which highlighted her man, 40.

The first showed her better half lying on his back in a gray t-shirt with a black face covering on.

Their small cat, Lily, sat upon his chest with its arms folded underneath it. Its eyes nearly closed.

She captioned the photo, 'Happy 21st First-Date-iversary to my love @stealthgabel.'

The Jurassic World star followed that first post up with a second one in which she was pictured planting a kiss on her better half's right cheek.

She wore a dark green dress with a floral pattern on it. The dress had long sleeves and the collar was high on her neck.

Howard met her future husband while the two were attending New York University. They dated for five years before marrying in 2006.

The couple have two children together: Theodore Howard-Gabel, 15, and Beatrice Howard-Gabel, 10.

Despite her busy personal life, the star has still been hard at work on her career in recent years.

She's completed filming on Jurassic World Dominion, the third installment in the Jurassic World trilogy.

Howard will reprise her role as Claire Dearing, the former park operations manager of Jurassic World.

Her other upcoming film, titled Argylle is currently in post-production. Argylle centers around a spy of the same name as he travels all over the world on a mission.

Howard will star in the film alongside Henry Cavill, John Cena and Samuel L. Jackson.
