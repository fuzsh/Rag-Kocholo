        "text": "I never thought my little Fringe family could get more lovable. Between Olivia, Peter and Walter, my little TV heart was content. But surprise! Lincoln Lee, played by the adorable Seth Gabel, managed to burrow his way in. I kind of blame J.J. Abrams and his wonderful characters and story lines. Talented bastard. But I digress. How cute is this boy with his little nerdy glasses and suits? And as if he wasn’t cute enough on his own, he’s married to the adorable Bryce Dallas Howard. I’m pretty sure they could make it on an entry of Cute Overload, but that’s just me. I’ll allow you all to make your own decision after the jump!\n\nOK, so I don’t usually include my hump’s real-life spouses (such a buzz kill), but you have to admit, aren’t these two just the cutest???\n\n*All images found via Google Images & Tumblr"
