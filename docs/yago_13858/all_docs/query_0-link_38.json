        "text": "Bryce Dallas Howard and Seth Gabel’s love story is a testament to enduring romance and shared passions. Meeting at New York University Tisch School of the Arts in 2001, the couple embarked on a journey that led to marriage in 2006, and they recently celebrated 22 years together.\n\nBoth accomplished actors, Seth Gabel has appeared in various shows, including Sex and the City, Salem, and American Horror Story. Gabel’s love for acting began in childhood, and he attended the Tisch School of Arts, mirroring Bryce’s own educational path.\n\nTheir friendship circles include longtime friend Josh Gad, the godfather of their children, and a connection that traces back to kindergarten. The couple shares two children, Theodore Norman and Beatrice Jean, emphasizing the importance of a grounded upbringing amidst Hollywood’s glamour.\n\nBryce Dallas Howard’s father-in-law, renowned filmmaker Ron Howard, serves as a role model for Gabel, teaching the value of humility and kindness in the entertainment industry.\n\nThe couple’s love story began with Bryce experiencing love at first sight, pursuing Seth until he realized his deep feelings for her. Their wedding in Greenwich, Connecticut, five years later, marked the start of their family life.\n\nIn 2022, the family relocated to Los Angeles, infusing their home with personalized touches inspired by their favorite films, including Star Wars and My Neighbor Totoro. Their residence reflects a love for Amsterdam, portrayed through tulip-filled guest rooms, and a kitchen adorned with a Baby Yoda garlic holder.\n\nAs they continue to navigate their journey through life, Bryce Dallas Howard and Seth Gabel stand as a beacon of enduring love, creative collaboration, and a commitment to a grounded family life in the midst of Hollywood’s allure."
