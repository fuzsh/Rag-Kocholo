        "text": "Bryce Dallas Howard has revealed she kept her last name a secret while a student at New York University because of her famous dad, director Ron Howard.\n\n“I was insecure about that when I was younger,” she told the LA Times about her insecurity about her last name. “When I went to NYU, I wouldn’t tell anyone my last name and I was like, ‘No, Dad, you can’t come see my play because people might recognize you.’”\n\n“For me to be weird about something that, honestly, really doesn’t have anything to do with me — I just realized, that’s just shortsighted,” she continued. “So many of my peers at NYU had parents who were really not supportive of them being artists in any way, shape or form, which totally made sense because they were scared for them.”\n\nBryce added, “I had parents who were emotionally supportive of me. … There wasn’t a lot of baggage that I inherited from them in that way. Have you met my dad? He’s sweet, isn’t he?”"
