        "text": "According to Bryce Dallas Howard, the veteran actor and director best known for her roles in Jurassic World and the Twilight series, she and her husband, fellow actor Seth Gabel, had one place in mind when envisioning how their new home would look. “We had the chance to visit Mia Farrow once,” she says, recounting in awed reverence the heirloom-packed Connecticut farmhouse of the Rosemary’s Baby actor. “And it was the most magical place. Her house was full of stories and treasures, mementos of such a legendary life. Seth and I left thinking, ‘This is what we aspire to. This is what we want our home to be like.’”\n\nOf course, Howard is no stranger to legendary lives. As the daughter of Academy Award–winning director Ron Howard and an actor herself since childhood, she has certainly witnessed her share of Hollywood history, which is precisely why she chose to take a more personal approach when designing her home. She called on family friend Claire Thomas to mastermind the decoration of the four-bedroom, two-story new-build in Los Angeles, where her family of four recently relocated to after decades of living in upstate New York. “Seth calls Claire ‘the bippity boppity boo lady,’” jokes Howard, referring to Cinderella’s problem-solving fairy godmother. “She’s just one of those creative people who has ideas and makes them happen.” Thomas, in addition to being an interior designer, is a successful commercial film director and co-owner of Los Angeles’s Sweet Laurel Bakery.\n\nUnsurprisingly, creative ideas were in no short supply. “Bryce and I share a passion for old Hollywood storytelling,” Thomas says, describing her cinema-inspired approach gleaned from years behind the camera. “So when I started this project, I imagined them as characters on a set. And since I’ve known them for such a long time, it was really fun to interpret their personalities.” For the couple, who met over 20 years ago while studying acting at NYU, that naturally meant a lot of bright color, dramatic flourishes, and references to their favorite films and television shows.\n\nIn developing the project, Howard and Thomas collectively dubbed their working style “organic glamour,” meaning a playful mix of old Hollywood influences, lively vintage pieces, and easygoing Californian vibes. “We immediately knew that the core color palette for the house was going to be pink and green,” Thomas says. “I always joke that I only use redhead colors—that is, colors that redheads look great in. I’m a redhead and Bryce is a redhead so it works.” Most rooms are dominated by those shades: A mint-toned kitchen island is flanked by baby pink cabinets, which match the custom terrazzo breakfast table by Concrete Collaborative; a bubblegum media center in the living room faces a U-shaped Joybird sofa in a darker rose tone; a tranquil sage green guest bedroom has fluted wooden detailing on the wall; a fuchsia dinosaur-printed wallpaper charms next to the vanity in the powder room; and an olive-colored soaker tub is set atop rosy Venetian flooring in the primary bathroom. “Obviously you don’t want it to look like an Easter basket,” Thomas explains, “So we did it in a way that feels elevated and chic—yet so fun.”\n\nDespite the home’s overall sunny demeanor, there was still plenty of space left for drama. In the dining room, Thomas folded in touches of fantasy which, she says, really speak to Howard and Gabel’s shared passion for cinema. “Bryce calls it her Miyazaki room,” she explains, referring to the revered Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Thomas lined the walls with a mural-like wallpaper from Schumacher, which depicts a starry woodland scene which Howard says reminds her of the mystical forest setting in My Neighbor Totoro, her favorite Miyazaki film. On the ceiling, Thomas tapped artist and designer Cooper Reynolds Gross to install reflective brass panels that wash the entire room in a luminous, golden glow. “We love this room because it reminds us of the kind of magical world that we get to live in for our work,” Howard says.\n\nThe film references, however, don’t end there. Thomas incorporated nods to Star Wars and Star Trek for Howard and Gabel, who are die-hard fans. (Howard has directed several episodes of the first franchise’s latest iteration, The Mandalorian.) For instance, on the home’s rear facade, Thomas commissioned a mural featuring two suns rising from the horizon—an homage to protagonist Luke Skywalker’s fictional home planet Tatooine—while a novelty Baby Yoda garlic holder, from the aforementioned reboot, stands watch over the kitchen.\n\n“Both Bryce and Seth also love Star Trek: The Next Generation and that kind of retro-futuristic look,” Thomas adds. She loosely incorporated that inspiration in the primary bedroom, where curving lines (in the form of a gently rounded chaise and a plush, upholstered headboard), flea market finds, and a muted palette of dusty rose channel just the right amount of ’80s kitsch. “I remember growing up being like, ‘I would love to live on the Starship Enterprise,’” Howard reminisces. “There’s a softness to the futurism of [director] Gene Roddenberry’s world that feels so enticing.”\n\nThere are also many sentimental objects and references throughout the home. For example, tulips, from the summer they fell in love in Amsterdam—Howard had hosted Gabel in her dorm room while enrolled at a Dutch acting workshop—now bloom on the walls of the guest bathroom. Or the small canvas Thomas had made for Howard for her 40th birthday, embroidered with her and Gabel’s nicknames from their children. “It’s like a jewel box,” Howard playfully quips. “A jewel box and a sandbox all in one.”"
