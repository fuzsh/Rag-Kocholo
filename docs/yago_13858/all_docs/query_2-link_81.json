        "text": "Sarah Sutherland Is Kiefer Sutherland’s Daughter\n\nSarah Sutherland is best known for playing the daughter of vice-president Selena Meyer in HBO’s comedy “Veep,” starring Julia Louis Dreyfuss. In real life, she is the daughter of Kiefer Sutherland. Kiefer is himself the son of Donald Sutherland, the Canadian actor who became a Hollywood star in the 70s with films like “The Dirty Dozen,” “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” “Klute” and “Ordinary People.”\n\nSarah’s father first gained fame in the '80s and early '90s with roles in movies like “Stand By Me,” “The Lost Boys,” “Young Guns” and “Flatliners.” He later reinvented himself as a TV star starting with the show “24,” in which he played special agent Jack Bauer.\n\nCharlie Hall Is Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s Son\n\nAfter her breakout role in 1989 as the hilarious Elaine Benes in “Seinfeld,” Julia Louis-Dreyfus has been one of Hollywood’s most talented and successful stars. Her leading roles in shows like “The New Adventures of Old Christine” and HBO’s “Veep” have kept Dreyfus busy in the last few decades.\n\nAnd apparently, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, since her son Charlie Hall, whom she has with her husband Brad Hall, another actor, has a celebrity career of his own. At his young age, Charlie has already starred in Netflix’s teen drama “Moxie,” the sitcom drama “Bel-Air,” HBO’s “The Sex Lives of College Girls,\" and Disney’s comedy show, “Single Drunk Female.”\n\nGwyneth Paltrow Is Blythe Danner’s Daughter\n\nAmerican actress Blythe Danner had two children, Gwyneth and Jake, with producer and director Bruce Paltrow. Danner started out in the theater, earning a Tony Award in 1970, and appearing in a variety of films since, such as “1776,” “The Prince of Tides” and “Alice.” More recent credits include that of Dina Byrnes in the Robert de Niro and Ben Stiller blockbuster “Meet the Parents” and its sequels.\n\nHer daughter Gwyneth followed in her footsteps. Gwyneth Paltrow came to prominence in the 90s with starring roles in “Emma,” “Sliding Doors” and “Shakespeare in Love,” which won Best Picture at the 1998 Oscars. She has also become known for her role as Pepper Potts in the “Iron Man” and “The Avengers” movies, as well as for founding the multimillion-dollar health and wellness company Goop.\n\nDrew Barrymore Comes From a Hollywood Dynasty\n\nDrew Barrymore was little more than a baby when she became famous after appearing in Steven Spielberg’s critical and commercial blockbuster “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.” As a young woman, she made her way through Hollywood starring in hits like “The Wedding Singer,” “Never Been Kissed,” and “Charlie’s Angels.” She also bagged her own daytime variety talk show, “The Drew Barrymore Show,” on CBS.\n\nNot only were Drew’s parents both actors, but every one of her maternal and paternal grandparents was also in the acting profession. John Barrymore, her grandfather on her dad’s side of the family, was the most famous actor in the world during the turn of the 20th century and nearly up until his death in 1942.\n\nHarley Quinn Smith Is Kevin Smith’s Daughter\n\nOne of the stars of “Tusk” and “Cruel Summer,” Harley Quinn Smith is none other than famous director Kevin Smith’s daughter. And when you consider the following fact, it makes absolute, perfect sense. After all, Kevin is a known comic book fanatic.\n\nThe director of 90s cult classics like “Clerks,” “Mallrats,” “Chasing Amy,” and of course, in 2001’s “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,” Kevin Smith became the indie hero of a generation. And it seems his young daughter with actress Jennifer Schwalbach, Harley Quinn has followed in her parents’ footsteps. In 2022, Harley acted in her father’s long-awaited comedy “Clerks III.\"\n\nJason Ritter Is John Ritter’s Son\n\nSweetheart actor Jason Ritter is known for his work in TV shows like “Joan of Arcadia,” “Parenthood,” “A Million Little Pieces,” and the sci-fi series “Raising Dion.\" He also gained recognition for doing the voice of Dipper Pines, in the hit 2012 animated family series “Gravity Falls.” It seems that Jason’s sweet personality on screen carries over into his real life, much like his father’s, famous actor John Ritter.\n\nJohn Ritter made his acting breakthrough on the 1977 sitcom “Three’s Company” and kept gracing our screens in hit shows like “8 Simple Rules,” and classic 90s comedy films like the “Problem Child” series. Jason says his late dad was “very loving and supportive,” and we believe every word of it.\n\nLaura Dern Is Bruce Dern’s Daughter\n\nBruce Dern is an intense performer often cast as a villain or troubled character. His career took off in the late 60s and he has collaborated with seemingly all of Hollywood. Classic movies he has been in include “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?,” “Coming Home” and “Posse.” In 2015, he appeared in Quentin Tarantino’s “The Hateful Eight” and the film where he has arguably given his best performance, Alexander Payne’s “Nebraska.”\n\nLaura Dern has followed in her father’s footsteps, becoming a beloved and successful performer known for appearing both in arthouse and commercial films. A favorite of director David Lynch, she’s acted in a number of his films like “Blue Velvet” and “Wild at Heart,” while also appearing in massive hits like “Jurassic Park” and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.”\n\nRumer Willis Is Demi Moore and Bruce Willis’s Daughter\n\nAmerican actress Rumer Willis made her silver-screen debut at seven years old, in “Now and Then,” a coming-of-age film in which she co-starred with her mother, Demi Moore. And seeing as her father is none other than Hollywood legend Bruce Willis, it seems Rumer was primed for stardom from an early age.\n\nRumer kept on acting as a kid, playing Demi Moore’s daughter in 1996’s “Striptease,” and then acting alongside her father in the 2005 thriller film, “Hostage.” Throughout the years, Rumer went on to act in several films and TV shows, taking after her talented parents. In 2019, Rumer played swinging 60s actress Joanna Pettet in Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"\n\nChris Pine Is Robert Pine’s Son\n\nChris Pine made his acting debut with lighthearted romcoms like “The Princess Diaries 2” and “Just My Luck,” but as time went by, he became one of the most sought-after actors in Hollywood. In 2009 he landed one of his best-known roles as Captain Kirk in the “Star Trek” reboot film series, and he’s gone on to star in high-grossing blockbusters like the “Wonder Woman” film series, “Hell or High Water,” and “Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.”\n\nHis father, a known Hollywood star from the 70s, Robert Pine, made his fame by starring in the hit sitcom “CHiPs,” in the role of Sergeant Joseph “Joe” Getraer. He went on to act in hundreds of made-for-TV movies and shows throughout his 40-year-plus career.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis Is Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis’s Daughter\n\nJamie Lee Curtis' career has shown resilience through the decades. She began as a scream queen in John Carpenter’s genre-defining and very long-running “Halloween” franchise, then graduated to a variety of roles in several great movies, like the 80s comedy “A Fish Called Wanda.” Curtis made her roles come to life in what should have been boring side characters in flicks like “True Lies,” back when Schwarzenegger dominated the box office.\n\nAnd to top it all off: she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” in 2023. Jamie Lee’s parents, Tony Curtis, and Janet Leigh, became established Hollywood stars in the 50s and early 60s; during their marriage from 1951 to 1962, they formed their independent production company, Curtleigh Productions.\n\nSam Levinson Is Barry Levinson’s Son\n\nChances are you’ve seen the hit HBO series “Euphoria,” and so, you’ve become familiar with its creator, Sam Levinson. Apart from the infamous show, Levinson has also directed the hit indie film “Malcolm & Marie,” the thriller “Assassination Nation,” and the current HBO show “The Idol.” He also co-wrote the thriller “Deep Water,” with Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas.\n\nAlthough it’s safe to say that Sam has become a creative powerhouse in his own right, the fact that he’s Academy-Award-winning director Barry Levinson must have also come in handy. Barry is known for directing classics like “Rain Man,” “Wag the Dog,” “Sleepers,” “Good Morning, Vietnam,” and dozens of others. Guess the apple really doesn’t fall far from the tree when it comes to the Levinsons.\n\nMiley Cyrus Is Billy Ray Cyrus’ Daughter\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus reportedly never wanted the celebrity lifestyle for his daughter Miley but a private life wasn’t in her cards. Miley (born Destiny Hope) went right towards acting and singing. She became a child star in Disney’s “Hannah Montana,” where she played a normal teenager moonlighting as a famous pop idol.\n\nThe show also launched her music career, which has gone from teenager-pop song “He Could Be the One” to more grown-up hits like “Wrecking Ball” and “Flowers.” Billy Ray Cyrus is a multiplatinum-selling country singer-songwriter, best known for his 1992 single “Achy Breaky Heart,” featured in “Some Gave All,” which is still the best-selling album of all time for a debuting solo male artist.\n\nDakota Johnson Is Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson’s Daughter\n\nDakota Johnson became a celebrity after being cast in the starring role of the “Fifty Shades of Grey” films, which were based on the book series of the same name. Though the films were never the darlings of the critics, they made bank at the box office, and their success allowed Johnson to keep pursuing roles in film projects like “Persuasion,” “Cha Cha Real Smooth,” and the Marvel movie “Madame Web.”\n\nDakota’s parents know a thing or two about fame and acting. Her father is Don Johnson, whose starring role in the TV show “Miami Vice” made him a sex symbol in the 80s. Her mother is actress Melanie Griffith. Griffith, known for her marriages to Johnson and later to Antonio Banderas, built an impressive resume on-screen with films like “Working Girl,” “Body Double,\" “Celebrity,” and many more.\n\nCharlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez Are Martin Sheen’s Sons\n\n“The West Wing” and “Apocalypse Now” star Martin Sheen has been acting since the 60s and has had a stellar career up to this day. Two of his sons, Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez also got the acting gene and became prominent actors in their own right. The infamous Charlie Sheen, despite the unwanted media attention and gossip, remains a very good actor and has stellar performances under his belt, like his roles in “Wall Street” and “Platoon.”\n\nHis equally talented brother, Emilio Estevez, stuck to more indie projects like “The Breakfast Club,” “The Mighty Ducks,” “The Outsiders,” “St. Elmo’s Fire,” and others. Fun fact: Martin and Charlie adopted ‘Sheen’ as a stage name, but the entire family’s actual last name is ‘Estevez’, and they are of Spanish descent.\n\nStella McCartney Is Paul McCartney’s Daughter\n\nRevered fashion designer Stella McCartney has long been lauded as a fervent animal rights activist and humanitarian, who has always included her principles in her work. Apart from her use of animal-free and vegetarian alternatives when designing high-end fashion, Stella has also collaborated with major brands and celebrities – Adidas, Taylor Swift, Disney, etc. But Stella’s creativity and firm beliefs in animal rights didn’t appear out of the blue.\n\nShe is ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and late photographer and activist Linda McCartney’s middle child. Stella grew up traveling the world with her parents’ band, Wings. In fact, as Paul McCartney tells the story, the name ‘Wings’ came from Stella’s difficult birth, as she had to be delivered by emergency cesarean and meanwhile, the ex-Beatle prayed she would be born safely “on the wings of an angel.”\n\nZoe Kravitz Is Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet’s Daughter\n\nIf you have followed Zoey Kravitz's career you may have asked yourself how she looks so good. Well, It’s not difficult to see that a big part of the answer is her parents, Lisa Bonet and Lenny Kravitz. Bonet, who first rose to fame as Denise Huxtable on “The Cosby Show,” and Kravitz, whose been rock royalty since the 90s, divorced in 1993 but have remained close since.\n\nZoe has been in several big movies and TV shows in the past few years. Her biggest projects are arguably “The Batman” with Robert Pattinson, along with the HBO show “Big Little Lies,” which also starred Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, and other big-name actors.\n\nDomhnall Gleeson Is Brendan Gleeson’s Son\n\nDomhnall Gleeson has become a familiar face in the past decade. He has appeared in hits like “Ex Machina” with Oscar Isaac and opposite Rachel McAdams in “About Time,” and become part of the Star Wars universe by playing the memorable General Hux. His big acting break came with his role as one of Ron Weasley’s brothers in the final two “Harry Potter” movies.\n\nHis father is the Irish actor Brendan Gleeson. A successful theater and television actor in the UK during his youth, he earned the acclaim of audiences in the USA with roles in films like “Braveheart,” “Michael Collins,” “Gangs of New York,” “In Bruges,” the “Harry Potter” franchise and the Academy-Award nominated movie “The Banshees of Inisherin.” Gleeson is one of those actors whose performances, however small or imposing, usually steal the show.\n\nJack Quaid Is Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan’s Son\n\nJack Quaid has had some good roles over the years, starring in the hit satirical superhero series “The Boys,” which is filled with fantastic characters like Karl Urban’s fiery Billy Butcher and Anthony Starr’s sociopathic Homelander. Quaid also starred in the fifth “Scream” film as Richie Kirsch, the funny and perhaps homicidal requisite boyfriend of the main character.\n\nHis father is Dennis Quaid, a real Hollywood veteran with an extremely long list of credits, from 1979’s “Breaking Away” to playing the former president in the biopic “Reagan.” Quaid was married for ten years to Meg Ryan, a proclaimed America’s Sweetheart of the 80s and 90s with films like “Sleepless in Seattle,” “When Harry Met Sally,” “French Kiss,” and “You’ve Got Mail.”\n\nMason Gooding Is Cuba Gooding Jr.’s Son\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. hit the peak of his career in the late '90s, shouting at Tom Cruise as the loudmouthed pro footballer Rod Tidwell in “Jerry Maguire.” This role earned him a Supporting Actor Oscar. You may also remember him arguing with Jack Nicholson on the James L. Brooks comedy “As Good As It Gets.” Those early successes were followed by a long career of hits and misses.\n\nHowever, his son, Mason Gooding, was already interested in acting in high school, and has appeared in several television series like “Ballers” and “Love, Victor.” More recently, he’s appeared in Olivia Wilde’s comedy “Booksmart” and as part of the ensemble cast in the fifth and sixth “Scream” movies.\n\nMelanie Griffith Is Tippi Hedren’s Daughter\n\nBorn Nathalie Kay Hedren, “Tippi” started out as a model on the cover of Glamour and Life magazines and went on to become a Hollywood superstar after her leading role in Alfred Hitchcock’s “The Birds.” Hedren then went on to star in over 80 films and shows, becoming a staple in Hollywood’s A-list. In 1952, she married her third husband, ad executive Peter Griffith, with whom she had the famous actress Melanie Griffith.\n\nMelanie grew up surrounded by Hollywood royalty and went on to have a stellar career herself during the 80s and 90s, starring in hit films like “Working Girl,” “Lolita,” “Buffalo Girls,” and dozens more. Her famous marriage to Antonio Banderas, and then Don Johnson, with whom she had famous actress Dakota Johnson, has kept her in the celebrity spotlight.\n\nEmma Roberts Is Eric Roberts’ Daughter and Julia Roberts’ Niece\n\nEmma Roberts's father, Eric Roberts, is an Oscar-nominated actor who has been around the block, appearing in over 700 different movies and TV shows over the years. From indie classics to cheesy shows to big blockbusters, he’s been in “The Pope of Greenwich Village” to “The Dark Knight” to “Ape vs Monster.\" He is Julia Roberts’ brother, making Emma the niece of the bona fide star.\n\nEmma Roberts has been everywhere for the past decade or so, first in teenage movies like “Nancy Drew” and “Aquamarine,” and then in indie projects like “Palo Alto,” raunchy comedies like “We’re the Millers” and cheesy rom-coms like “Maybe I Do.” Her TV work includes, most memorably, the “American Horror Story” series and “Scream Queens.”\n\nMaude and Iris Apatow Are Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann’s Daughters\n\nMaude and Iris Apatow are the daughters of longtime comedy power couple Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann. Apatow made “Freaks and Geeks” in 1999, and success with a string of movies and shows followed. Apatow’s work as a producer, writer, and director has launched many careers, including those of Seth Rogen, Dannie McBride, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, and others.\n\nLeslie Mann has had memorable roles in comedies like “Big Daddy,” “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” “Knocked Up” and “Rio.” Their daughter Maude worked with her parents in “This Is Forty” and has appeared in the HBO show “Euphoria” and the Pete Davidson movie “The King of Staten Island.” The younger Iris also appeared in “This Is Forty” and other of her dad’s films like “Knocked Up” and “Funny People.”\n\nZoey Deutch Is Lea Thompson’s Daughter\n\nEven though she’s been acting since the mid-2000s, actress Zoey Deutch made her claim to fame with the 2016 film “Everybody Wants Some!!” and the Netflix rom-com “Set It Up.” She’s also played leading roles in Netflix’s comedy series “The Politician” and starred alongside Bryan Cranston and James Franco in the comedy film “Why Him?”\n\nBut this up-and-coming actress is also known for being the daughter of famous actress Lea Thompson, and director Howard Deutch. Lea Thompson is best known for her role as Lorraine McFly, Marty’s mother, in the “Back to the Future” film saga. Her husband, Howard Deutch, is known for directing John Hughes’s famous screenplays for “Some Kind of Wonderful” and “Pretty in Pink.”\n\nDan Levy Is Eugene Levy’s Son\n\nDespite Eugene Levy's varied and successful acting career, many of us will first and foremost remember him as the well-intentioned, hilariously awkward dad who walks in on his teenage son making love to an apple pie in the family kitchen. “American Pie” became a comedy classic soon after its release in 1999, by which time Levy already had a standout comedy career.\n\nHe appeared in movies like “Splash” and Christopher Guest comedies like “A Mighty Wind” and “Best in Show.” His son, Dan Levy, made it big working with his father and the talented cast of “Schitt’s Creek,” the hit sitcom that also stars Catherine O’Hara and Annie Murphy. Dan Levy ended up landing a role in the HBO series “The Idol.”\n\nTatum O’Neal Is Ryan O’Neal’s Daughter\n\nTatum O’Neal still holds the record for the youngest person to ever win an Oscar. It was for her performance in 1973’s “Paper Moon,” which she co-starred in with her father Ryan O’Neal, when she was just ten years old. The story, set in depression-era Kansas, follows the senior O’Neal as a small-time conman working in cahoots with a young kid named Addie.\n\nIt is considered by many to be his best acting performance, surpassing his roles in Stanley Kubrick’s “Barry Lyndon” and the early 70s smash hit “Love Story.” Tatum starred in several big films in the following years, including “The Bad News Bears” and “International Velvet,” but took on fewer roles as time went on. Offscreen, Tatum became known for her public marriage and divorce to tennis star John McEnroe.\n\nLena Dunham Is Laurie Simmons’s Daughter\n\nLena Dunham became a household name with “Girls,” the HBO show she created, wrote, directed, produced, and starred in. Don't worry, there were other people involved too: Allison Williams, Adam Driver, and Jemima Kirke were part of the large cast. The hit show followed the lives of a group of friends in their 20s in Brooklyn.\n\nShe has since directed the films “Sharp Stick” and “Catherine Called Birdie,” and written a book, “Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She’s ‘Learned.’” Her mom, Laurie Simmons, co-starred along with her brother Cyrus in Dunham’s first low-budget movie “Tiny Furniture,” which put her on the map. Her mother Laurie was a famous artist back in the 1970s, experimenting with photography and filmmaking and working with some of the most famous creative minds of the era.\n\nJohn David Washington Is Denzel Washington’s Son\n\nFrom his Academy-award-winning roles in 1989’s “Glory” and 2001’s “Training Day,” Denzel Washington has proven himself to be one of cinema history’s most brilliant actors. Movies like “Philadelphia,” “Malcolm X,” “Inside Man,” and at least a dozen more, have become cinematic masterpieces where Denzel has astonished audiences worldwide.\n\nBut we bet if you ask him, one of his greatest accomplishments is his son, famous actor John David Washington. A former professional football player, John David got his acting breakthrough with his role as Ron Stallworth in Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman.” Since then, he’s starred in major blockbusters like Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet,” Sam Levinson’s “Malcolm & Marie,” and David O. Russell’s “Amsterdam.”\n\nLouisa Jacobson Is Meryl Streep’s Daughter\n\nLouisa Jacobson has been modeling for years, but her big acting debut came with her role as Marian Brook, in HBO’s hit series “The Gilded Age.” Jacobson might play a rural young woman who arrives in New York without a family or possessions, but in real life, Louisa is the daughter of Hollywood queen Meryl Streep and prominent sculptor Don Gummer.\n\nYes, this means that she is the sister of famous actresses Mamie and Grace Gummer. Honestly, it might be a shock at first, but if you look at her, you’ll see the astonishing resemblance. Louisa goes by her middle name, Jacobson, to attract less media attention, but now that the cat’s out of the bag, we wish her luck with anonymity!\n\nElle King Is Rob Schneider’s Daughter\n\nElle King is a singer, songwriter, and actress whose debut album, “Love Stuff,” came out in 2015. She has since released four other albums—mostly centered on rock, blues, and country—and has racked up four Grammy nominations. Her father is comedian Rob Schneider, beloved as an \"SNL\" cast member in the early 1990s, the same generation as alums like Adam Sandler, David Spade, and Chris Farley.\n\nHe’s had numerous small but rewarding roles in Adam Sandler comedies like “The Waterboy” and “Mr. Deeds,” as well as starring roles in various Hollywood comedies like “Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,” “The Animal,” and “The Hot Chick.” He has also appeared on numerous TV shows and made several stand-up comedy specials. He had his daughter Elle with former American model London King.\n\nElizabeth Olsen Is a Sibling of the Olsen Twins\n\nWhile her sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley became sitcom superstars in the 90s with “Full House,” Elizabeth Olsen has become a solid leading lady in today’s movie and television industry. She’s Wanda Maximoff, a.k.a. the Scarlet Witch, in the Marvel cinematic universe, starring in big movies like \"Avengers: Endgame,” “Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” and the TV show “WandaVision.”\n\nShe has also starred in the 2023 HBO hit show “Love and Death,” a limited series from HBO about a real-life case of infidelity and murder in a small Texas town. Elizabeth’s mother, Jarnette, was an actress and dancer who played a big role in her twin sisters’ path to child stardom.\n\nAngelina Jolie Is John Voight’s Daughter\n\nAngelina Jolie and John Voight both achieved fame in their own eras and have had a complicated father-and-daughter relationship through the years. Voight made his fame in movies like “The Champion Franco Zifirelli,” “Midnight Cowboy,” “Heat,” and “Anaconda.” He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for playing a Vietnam vet in 1978’s “Coming Home.”\n\nThough Voight acted in Angelina Jolie’s big-budget “Lara Croft: Tomb Raider” in 2001, they apparently had no contact from 2002 to 2007 and were first seen together in public in 2010. Jolie, who had built up a strong acting resume in the 90s, exploded in popularity around the time of “Tomb Raider” and “Girl, Interrupted,” for which she won a supporting actress Oscar.\n\nPatrick Schwarzenegger Is Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Son\n\nYou can’t really hide being Arnold Schwarzenegger’s son with a last name like that, not that you would ever want to. Patrick Schwarzenegger is the middle child of celebrity actor, bodybuilder, and ex-governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Kennedy family socialite, Maria Shriver.\n\nPatrick has been busy since 2018, landing major roles in films like “Midnight Sun,” “Moxie,” “The Terminal List,” “Daniel Isn’t Real,” and the hit Netflix series “The Staircase.” As for his father, Arnold really needs no introduction, as he has built an amazing career in entertainment and politics for the last three decades. These days, you can catch him in Netflix shows like \"Fubar.\"\n\nJennifer Aniston Is John Aniston’s Daughter\n\nJennifer Aniston's dad was a big deal on Daytime TV. John Aniston starred in “Days of Our Lives” for nearly 40 years. He first appeared in the well-known soap opera in 1985, which chronicles the lives and loves of families in the town of Salem. The show ended its run after 57 years, making it one of the longest-running scripted television programs in history.\n\nThe younger Aniston made her own larger mark on television as Rachel on the hit show “Friends.” Few programs in the past fifty years were bigger moneymakers and culture setters than “Friends,” which is still endlessly rewatched and replayed on TVs and laptops all over the world. An impressive movie career followed, with roles in action and comedy films like “Murder Mystery,” “We’re the Millers,” “The Bounty Hunter,” “Bruce Almighty,” and “The Breakup.”\n\nJane Fonda Is Henry Fonda’s Daughter\n\nThe Fondas are a known Hollywood family, both for their incredible talent and their hereditary good looks. The patriarch of the Fonda family, Henry Fonda started acting in 1928 and had a stellar career for over five decades, starring in classics like “12 Angry Men” and “Once Upon a Time in the West.” Henry and his second wife, socialite Frances Ford Seymour had Jane and Peter Fonda.\n\nJane Fonda rose to prominence in the 60s, with hit films like “Barbarella,” and then in the 80s with classics like “Fun With Dick and Jane” and “On Golden Pond,” in which she co-stars with her father. In the 80s, Jane Fonda’s exercise videos became a massive commercial success, an enterprise she kept going for 13 years. Today, this amazing woman is still acting and still a fierce human rights activist.\n\nScott Eastwood Is Clint Eastwood’s Son\n\nClint Eastwood is an American icon with a stellar career of over seven decades, having defined the spaghetti western with Sergio Leone, perfected the tough city cop persona, and made forays into all kinds of genres behind and in front of the camera. His son, Scott, has followed in his father’s footsteps.\n\nOne of his earliest roles was as a small-time thug in \"Gran Torino,\" another of his father's strong directorial projects from the 2000s.

She’s been in countless hit films, like “Idiocracy,” \"Grown-Ups,” “Bridesmaids,” “Away We Go,” “Forever,” and in the hit Apple TV show, “Loot.”\n\nBut Maya was never a stranger to fame, being the daughter of iconic 70s soul singer, Minnie Riperton, and singer-songwriter Richard Rudolph. Maya and her brother Marc grew up surrounded by music, with her mom being revered as the “Queen of the Whistle Register.” This is the highest register of the human voice, and Minnie dominated it like no one else in the industry.\n\nNicole Richie Is Lionel Richie’s Daughter\n\nReality TV star Nicole Richie became somewhat of an “it” girl back in the early 2000s after appearing in “The Simple Life” show with friend and socialite Paris Hilton. Richie went on to land several gigs in popular projects, like “Chuck,” “8 Simple Rules,” and “Candidly Nicole.” But few people know that Nicole is actually the daughter of famous singer Lionel Richie.\n\nThe 80s singer rose to stardom with hits like “All Night Long,” and “Hello,” and has enjoyed a career of fame and fortune for decades. Nicole tells the story of how her dad wanted to sing at her wedding with Good Charlotte singer Joel Madden, but she firmly opposed it!\n\nMariska Hargitay Is Jayne Mansfield’s Daughter\n\nMariska Hargitay was well acquainted with the shiny life of Hollywood long before her breakthrough role as Olivia Benson in “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.” She is the daughter of famous 50s actor and bodybuilder Mickey Hargitay, and bombshell actress and Playboy Playmate Jayne Mansfield.\n\nMansfield became a symbol of the 50s and 60s, and her tragic passing in 1967 left a deep scar in the entertainment industry. Mariska and her two brothers were in the car when the fatal accident happened, and she has spoken about the trauma in interviews decades later, saying how losing her mother “is the scar of my soul.” Hargitay has made an incredibly successful career for herself, though, independent of her mother’s legacy.\n\nSosie Bacon Is Kevin Bacon’s Daughter\n\nYou might know her as Carrie Layden in “Mare of Easttown,” or as Rose Cotter in the horror film “Smile,” but Sosie Bacon has been acting since she was 10 years old. Her first role was in the movie “Loverboy,” which was directed by her father, Kevin Bacon, and starred her mother, actress Kyra Sedgwick.\n\nIt seems Sosie has the acting gene from both sides, seeing as the “Footloose” star Kevin Bacon has had a very successful Hollywood career since the 80s. Her mother Kyra is also a successful actress, most well-known for her leading role in “The Closer.” Apparently, Keving and Kyra have one of the longest and most successful marriages in Hollywood.\n\nBen Stiller Is Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara’s Son\n\nBen Stiller was interested in acting from an early age and had a direct line to that kind of life through his parents.

Grace also had success in the theater, acting opposite Helen Hunt in a production of “Much Ado About Nothing” and with John Lithgow on Broadway in “The Columnist.”\n\nIn 2021, she married record producer and musician Mark Ronson, best known for his work with Bruno Mars in the single “Uptown Funk.” Grace’s mom is the most nominated actor in Oscar history, with 21 and counting, including three wins: “Kramer vs. Kramer,” “Sophie's Choice,” and “The Iron Lady.”\n\nKaia Gerber Is Cindy Crawford’s Daughter\n\nSupermodel Cindy Crawford achieved worldwide fame back in the '90s. There wasn’t a runway or cover of a magazine she hadn’t been on. As the spitting image of her mother, why wouldn’t Kaia Gerber also pursue the world of modeling for herself? When she was no older than 21 years old, Cindy Crawford and businessman Rande Gerber’s youngest daughter Kaia had already been on the runway of the world’s most famous fashion houses.\n\nShe’s modeled for Prada, Chanel, Burberry, Louis Vuitton, and dozens of others. Her brother, Presley Gerber, is also a model. And honestly, with genes like that, why wouldn’t they be? Gerber certainly has a bright future ahead of her.\n\nAbby Elliott Is Chris Elliott’s Daughter\n\nThe talented and hilarious Abby Elliott made her debut in 2008 when she joined the cast of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” She stayed as a regular on the show until 2012, and had an incredibly successful run, all the while doing stand-up and appearing in film and television shows, such as 2022’s “The Bear.” Abby wasn’t the first Elliott to become a part of “SNL.”\n\nHer father Chris Elliott was also a member of the cast back in the 80s. He’s also known for his appearances in comedy sketches on “Late Night with David Letterman” and for quirky roles in “Scary Movie,\" “Groundhog Day,” “There’s Something About Mary,” and the show he created and starred in back in the '90s, “Get a Life.” Family dinners at the Elliott household must be quite entertaining.\n\nBryce Dallas Howard Is Ron Howard’s Daughter\n\nBryce Dallas Howard has appeared in a fair number of big Hollywood franchises: she played Gwen Stacy in Sam Raimi’s “Spider-Man 3,” appeared in “Terminator: Salvation” and is in the latest “Jurassic Park” trilogy starring opposite Chris Pratt. Some of her numerous other movies include the M. Night Shyamalan hits “The Village” and “Lady in the Water,” the Elton John biopic “Rocketman” and the hit drama “The Help.”\n\nHer father is one of the most successful movie directors in Hollywood: Ron Howard.

Francis’s brother, August, was also in the arts, as a film executive and author. He and his first wife, dancer Joy Vogelsang had three children, one of them was Nicolas Coppola, a.k.a. Nicolas Cage. That’s right, the star of “Con Air,” “Lord of War,” “National Treasure,” and other of Hollywood’s most memorable films.\n\nNicolas Cage is the nephew of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola. He gained serious recognition after his role in the 1987 film by Joel Cohen, “Raising Arizona.” Then in 1995, Cage won an Academy Award for his role in “Leaving Las Vegas.” Family connections might have helped, but Nicolas has definitely proven his talent far beyond his family name.\n\nCooper Hoffman Is Philip Seymour Hoffman’s Son\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman’s son, Cooper, made his big screen debut in the 2021 film “Licorice Pizza,” a Paul Thomas Anderson gem. You can add this project to his other classics like “Boogie Nights,” “Magnolia” and “The Master.” Hoffman plays Gary opposite Alana, played by Alana Haim (of the rock band HAIM), in a love story set in the backdrop of 1970’s San Fernando Valley, California.\n\nHis father, Philip Seymour Hoffman, passed away in 2014, leaving a rich acting legacy and undisputed reputation as one of his generation’s best actors. Some career highlights include starring in “Capote,” “Synecdoche, New York” and “Doubt.” Seymour Hoffman was just as memorable in small roles with staying power, as evidenced in “The Big Lebowski,” “Almost Famous,” “Scent of a Woman,” “Along Came Polly” and others.

In 2021, Michael reprised the iconic role of his late father, playing Tony in “The Many Saints of Newark.” But Michael has been appearing everywhere since then – in 2021’s “Cherry,” 2022’s “The Offer,” and in Ari Aster’s “Beau Is Afraid” in 2023. Certainly, when it comes to talents and looks, Michael is the spitting image of his beloved father.\n\nKatherine Waterston Is Sam Waterston’s Daughter\n\nSam Waterson’s best-known role is that of district attorney Jack Mckoy in “Law and Order,” the long-running series created by Dick Wolf. His notable career extends to a good number of movies as well, such as “The Killing Fields,” “Crimes and Misdemeanors,” and the more recent “The Dropout,” “Miss Sloane,” and “Grace and Frankie.”\n\nWaterson’s daughter, Katherine, has been building up the resume of a serious and adaptable actress who can work with drama, terror, or fantasy.

She had a memorable role as a love interest in the second season of the HBO show “Perry Mason” and was cast in the Blumhouse horror film “They Listen.”\n\nLiza Minnelli Is Judy Garland’s Daughter\n\nThe incomparable Liza Minelli is one of the world’s most famous performers, and one of the few to be awarded an EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony awards). Her stage presence and vocal talent are one of a kind, and it’s no wonder, seeing as she’s the daughter of legendary actress Judy Garland and theater and film director Vincente Minnelli.\n\nJudy Garland was one of the most iconic Hollywood actresses of the 40s and 50s, best known for her role as Dorothy in the classic film “The Wizard of Oz.” Liza was always adamant about building a career for herself on her own, and her mother was always the first to support her – the two were very close when Liza was growing up.\n\nColin Hanks Is Tom Hanks’ Son\n\nColin Hanks’ first big movie was “Orange County.” It is a light comedy whose best part is Jack Black — back then at the peak of his career — as the whacky brother to Hanks’ straight man Shaun, who desperately wants to get into Stanford.

He first burst into the scene acting opposite his father in the critical and commercial hit “The Pursuit of Happyness,” where his affecting and bright performance at just eight years old turned a lot of heads.\n\nThe father and son’s other work together after a few years, “After Earth,” directed by M. Night Shyamalan, was also well received. Jaden's parents are well known: Will Smith for his long and successful acting career since his debut in “The Fresh Prince” and Jada Pinkett Smith for her acting and most recently her talk show, “Red Table Talk.” Will won his first Oscar for best actor in 2021 for “King Richard.”\n\nBill Skarsgard Is Stellan Skarsgard’s Son\n\nStellan Skarsgard is an accomplished and versatile Swedish actor who has appeared in just about every kind of production, from lighthearted musicals like “Mama Mia!” to serious sci-fi epics like “Dune.” Four of his eight children are actors, with Alex and Bill being the highest-profile ones. Bill Skarsgard left a lasting impression as the terrifying Pennywise in the “It” movie remakes.\n\nHe has also displayed his intense performance skills in films like “John Wick: Chapter Four,” “Barbarian” and “The Devil All the Time.” His list of upcoming projects is even more impressive: the title role in Dave Eggers' “Nosferatu,” as Nicolas Cage's son in the sequel to 2005's “Lord of War,” and in the remake of the 90s classic “The Crow.”\n\nZosia Mamet Is David Mamet’s Daughter\n\nWe will never forget the naïve and ditzy Shoshanna Shapiro from the hit series “Girls,” who starts out as Jessa Johansson’s (Jemima Kirke) clueless cousin and develops her character into an assertive, independent young woman. Zosia Mamet, who played Shoshanna throughout the series, proved her talent and went on to land several gigs after the show ended in 2017.\n\nMamet starred in the romantic drama film “The Boy Downstairs,” and in HBO’s hit series “The Flight Attendant.” But even though her first major acting gig was in her early 20s, Zosia grew up in the spotlight, seeing as she’s the great David Mamet’s daughter. David is a legendary, Pulitzer-prize-winning playwright, author, and filmmaker, who wrote and directed “Heist,” “The Untouchables,” “Hannibal,” and dozens more. One of his most acclaimed works is his 1984 play, “Glengarry Glenn Ross.”\n\nBessie Carter Is Imelda Staunton’s Daughter\n\nYou might not recognize her name at first, but you will immediately know her character on Netflix’s hit series “Bridgerton.” Bessie Carter plays the posh Prudence Featherington, and she does it amazingly. Before landing the big gig as Prudence, Bessie made her acting debut in the BBC show “Howards End,” and then in the hit English series “Beecham House.”\n\nThis English rose didn’t just stumble upon acting, as she probably got the itch for it by watching her very talented parents, actors Jim Cramer and Imelda Staunton. Staunton plays the memorable Dolores Umbridge in the “Harry Potter” film franchise, and Queen Elizabeth II in the hit series “The Crown.” Jim Cramer is the one and only Mr. Bates from “Downton Abbey!”\n\nTracee Ellis Ross Is Diana Ross’s Daughter\n\nTracee Ellis Ross found fame starring opposite Anthony Anderson in “Black-Ish,” the sitcom that ran from 2014 to 2022 on ABC. Before then, she had starred in the less-known but widely loved show “Girlfriends.” Her Christmas comedy “Candy Cane Lane,” in which she co-stars with Eddie Murphy is something to add to your watchlist.\n\nEllis Ross is the daughter of Motown legend Diana Ross. Diana rose to fame as the lead singer of The Supremes, who over fifty years after forming still remains the female-led group with the most music chart hits in history. After leaving that group in 1970, Ross continued on with success as a solo artist with big albums and record-breaking live tours.\n\nEve Hewson Is Bono’s Daughter\n\nYou probably remember Irish actress Eve Hewson from her role as Mary in the 2011 comedy, “This Must Be the Place,” by Paolo Sorrentino. But Hewson has starred in several hit shows and films since, such as Steven Soderbergh’s “The Knick,” “Bridge of Spies,” “Papillon,” and the hit Netflix series, “Behind Her Eyes.” Well, this talented beauty is actually the daughter of none other than U2 rockstar Bono.\n\nEve is one of four children born to Bono and his wife Ali Hewson, an Irish activist. It seems that when it comes to this famous lead singer’s family, everyone has inherited an artistic gene – one son is a comedian, the other a singer, Eve is an actress, and the eldest daughter is a famous tech activist in Ireland. It seems that Bono did far more than just rock the world with his music throughout the 80s and 90s.\n\nMaya Hawke Is Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman’s Daughter\n\nMaya Hawke became famous as Robin Buckley from “Stranger Things,” the 1980s nostalgia-terror coming-of-age sci-fi hit from Netflix, and she has been busy taking acting gigs since. Her mom, Uma Thurman, has had an impressive acting and modeling career. She'll likely be most remembered for her work with Quentin Tarantino as the sultry Mia Wallace in “Pulp Fiction,” and as elite assassin Beatrix Kiddo out for revenge in “Kill Bill.”\n\nMaya's father, Ethan, has been pulling out great performances with his boyish looks and strong presence for decades. He starred in big 90s classics like “Dead Poets Society,” “Reality Bites,” “Gattaca” and “Before Sunrise.” His later hits include \"Training Day” and “Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.” Some of his more recent projects are “Boyhood,” “First Reformed,” “Sinister” and “The Black Phone.”\n\nNatasha Richardson Is Vanessa Redgrave’s Daughter\n\nActress Natasha Richardson made her big acting breakthrough in the 1986 horror film “Gothic,” and then landed important roles in epic films like “Patty Hearst,” “Fat Man and Little Boy,” and the 1990’s film “The Handmaid’s Tale.” She then continued to appear in several 90s and early 2000s classics, like “Nell,” “The Parent Trap,” “The White Countess,” “Maid in Manhattan,” and more.\n\nAs the daughter of award-winning actress Vanessa Redgrave, this beautiful talent was exposed to fame and fortune well before her first acting role. Redgrave had a stellar career in the '60s, '70s, and '80s, starring in classics like “Blowup,” “Camelot,” “Howards End,” “Atonement,” and hundreds more.

Spielberg is the most well-known and commercially successful director of all time.\n\nKate Hudson Is Goldie Hawn’s Daughter\n\nKate Hudson comes from Hollywood royalty on both sides of the family. She busted into Hollywood the old-fashioned way: with one big performance in one of 1998’s unlikeliest breakout hits, “Almost Famous,” Cameron Crowe's ode to 1970s rock and Rolling Stone journalism. Hudson played the archetypical hippie chick Penny Lane — cool, collected, fun, and wrapped around a tragic interior.\n\nHer specialty since has mostly been in romantic comedies and breezy action movies. Hudson grew up in Hollywood with her mother Goldie Hawn and stepfather Kurt Russell, both major stars through the 70s, 80s, and 90s. The longtime partners—together since 1983—have appeared in several films together, including “Swing Shift” and “Overboard.”\n\nAllison Williams Is Brian Williams’s Daughter\n\nWe all had a love-hate relationship with Marnie in HBO’s “Girls,” which means that actress Alison Williams did a very good job with the character. Williams made her debut in the hit show, but she has gone on to land big roles in Hollywood hits like “Get Out” and “M3GAN.” But before she proved her talent, she was mostly known as famous NBC news anchor Brian Williams’s daughter, which she admits really bothered her.\n\nNowadays, Alison states that she has “formed my own thing, and now I get people who are surprised to find out he’s my dad.” Brian Williams is a very successful TV news anchor and journalist who started his career as a correspondent for NBC’s Nightly News back in 1993.

Liv eventually came to have a close relationship with her biological father Steven, the lead singer of the famous rock band Aerosmith.\n\nAfter early breaks in the memorable indie hit “Empire Records” and Bernardo Bertolucci's “Stealing Beauty,” Liv starred in turn-of-the-century hits like Michael Bay's “Armageddon” and Peter Jackson's “The Lord of The Rings” trilogy. Most recently, she's starred in HBO's “The Leftovers,” the film “Ad Astra,” and more.\n\nO'Shea Jackson Jr. Is Ice Cube’s Son\n\nO'Shea Jackson played his father to perfection in “Straight Outta Compton.” The movie follows the rise and breakup of the rap supergroup NWA, which O'Shea Jackson Sr, a.k.a.

The latter was played by Corey Hawkins in the film.\n\nO’Shea Jackson Jr. has also appeared in “Just Mercy,” “Den of Thieves,” and “Long Shot.” Ice Cube's commercial success and artistic growth continued into his solo career, coming out with hits like “It Was a Good Day.” He also built himself a successful career as an actor, beginning with the low-budget hit “Friday,” which also launched Chris Tucker's career, and its many, many sequels.\n\nDamon Wayans Jr. Is Damon Wayans’s Son\n\nThe Wayans are a celebrity family that has conquered Hollywood, particularly Damon Wayans.

An up-and-coming star, Wayans Jr. has starred in “Happy Endings,” “How to Be Single,” “The Other Guys,” “Happy Together,” and dozens of other shows and movies. The way things go in the Wayans family, we suspect it’s just a matter of time before his daughter becomes a celebrity too.\n\nZoe Kazan Is Elia Kazan’s Granddaughter\n\nThe beautiful and brilliant actress Zoe Kazan made her acting debut in the 2003 film “Swordswallowers and Thin Men” and has since appeared in major films like “Revolutionary Road,” “The Big Sick,” “The Savages,” “It’s Complicated,” and in the hit 2022 film “She Said.” The sweet Zoe is not only the daughter of famous screenwriters Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord, but she is also the granddaughter of famous director Elia Kazan.\n\nElia Kazan directed some of Hollywood’s most revered classics, like “On the Waterfront,” “East of Eden,” “A Streetcar Named Desire,” and others.

He went on to win Grammys himself and top music charts around the world back in the 90s. Enrique is in a relationship with world-famous tennis player Anna Kournikova, with whom he has three children.

The “Rushmore” and “Darjeeling Limited” actor is the son of Talia Shire, sister of Francis Ford Coppola. So, this means that Jason is Francis’s nephew, and Sofia Coppola and Nicolas Cage’s cousin – talk about Hollywood royalty.\n\nJason has starred in dozens of Wes Anderson films, including “Moonrise Kingdom,” “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” and “The Fantastic Mr. Fox.” He also starred in HBO’s hit series “Bored to Death.” To top things off, Jason’s brother, Robert Schwartzman, is the cute introvert who ends up dating Mia in “The Princess Diaries.”\n\nRiley Keough Is Elvis Presley’s Granddaughter\n\nThe star of the hit series “Daisy Jones & the Six,” Riley Keough comes from the highest of celebrity royalty. She is the granddaughter of the “King of Rock and Roll” himself, Elvis Presley. Daughter of Elvis and Priscilla Presley’s only child, the late singer-songwriter Lisa Marie Presley, Riley has made a name for herself since her acting debut in the musical biopic, “The Runaways.”\n\nRiley is Lisa Marie and musician Danny Keough’s first child. Since 2010, Riley has been climbing the Hollywood ladder, starring in hit horror films like “The Lodge,” crime films “Logan Lucky,” and “Zola,” and “Mad Max: Fury Road,” alongside Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy.\n\nSofia Coppola Is Francis Ford Coppola’s Daughter\n\nThe Coppolas are a large Italian-American family with a long history of working in show business.

Director and writer Sofia Coppola is Francis' daughter, and he was there at the 2004 Oscars to hand her the award for best screenplay for “Lost in Translation.”\n\nThat beloved movie made Scarlett Johansson a star, gave fresh life to Bill Murray's career, and established Sofia as a director with sway in Tinseltown. Some of her more recent projects include “The Beguiled” and the biopic “Priscilla,” about the life of Priscilla Presley.\n\nTori Spelling Is Aaron Spelling’s Daughter\n\nTori Spelling became a household name for young audiences as Donna Martin on “Beverly Hills, 90210,” which became a pop culture phenomenon and lasted for ten seasons starting in 1990.
