I still own the sweater I wore that night because I JUST KNEW.⁣”\n\nSo, who is Bryce Dallas Howard’s husband? Here's everything to know about Seth Gabel and his relationship with the actress.\n\nGabel is an actor\n\nLike his wife, Gabel is also a working actor. He has appeared in shows like Sex and the City, Salem, Big Sky, American Horror Story and more.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Anthem Magazine, Gabel revealed his passion for acting began as a child.\n\n“When I was 11, my friend Josh Gad — he’s also an actor now — asked me to check out an acting camp with him, just to try it out for a day,” he said. “I loved being there. I spent the summer there and starred in a couple of plays. I started to fall in love with the process of acting.\"\n\nHe continued attending camp for years and eventually enrolled in the Tisch School of Arts at New York University. His passion for acting has grown throughout the years.\n\n“I remember my first play, a Western, and trying to figure out how to sound like a cowboy. It was going well and I could feel myself transforming into someone else,” Gabel said. “I loved that I could bring something from myself to that kind of character and gain insight. That’s the part of the acting process that I’m really hooked on. You can learn a lot about yourself from that experience.”\n\nGabel is childhood friends with actor, Josh Gad\n\nThe couple are surrounded by big time entertainment talent. Outside of Dallas Howard’s famous father, Frozen’s Josh Gad has been friends with Gabel since childhood. The two grew up together in Florida, and their friendship has continued to grow over the years.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Gabel shared that Gad is the godfather of Dallas Howard and Gabel's children.\n\n“I’ve known Josh Gad since kindergarten. We’ve been best friends since then. He got me into acting…It was so trippy, because I took my son to see Frozen and was explaining, Josh is his godfather, and so I was explaining your godfather is the voice of Olaf. He was just so starstruck by it,” he detailed.\n\nDallas Howard and Gabel met at New York University\n\nThe couple studied at NYU, and according to Dallas Howard, it was love at first sight — at least on her end.\n\n“The second I saw him on campus at New York University I broke into hives,” she told The Guardian in 2011. “That night I wrote in my journal: ‘Today I met the man that I'm going to marry.’ It was love at first sight — but not for him.\"\n\nDallas Howard continued, \"I pursued him for months and months, and there was no interest. Then I called him at an insane hour of the night and asked him out for coffee. He agreed, we went out and he called one of our friends afterwards and said: ‘The tables have turned. I am so nervous she doesn't like me anymore and I really like her!’ ”\n\nDallas Howard and Gabel married in 2006\n\nFive years later, the couple married in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nWhile the pair haven't revealed many details from the day, she has shared photos of her Zac Posen wedding gown in the past.\n\nGabel has learned important lessons from his father-in-law, Ron Howard\n\nGabel credited Academy Award-winning filmmaker and father-in-law Ron Howard with some of the best advice he has ever received in a 2017 interview with Larry King.\n\nThe advice came from his actions rather than words. “Just by example, my father-in-law Ron,” Gabel shared. “Just him being a good person.”\n\nBeyond his kind example, the Salem star also learned the importance of humility. “I very quickly learned there’s no point in having an ego in this business,” Gabel said.\n\nDallas Howard and Gabel share two children\n\nThe pair have two children, a son, Theodore Norman and a daughter, Beatrice Jean. The Twilight alum grew up with a famous father, and she decided she wanted to give her children the same low-key upbringing her parents prioritized.\n\n“What my parents did that was great was they exposed all of us to movie sets and making movies and the crew,” she told PEOPLE in 2020, “We had a very deep understanding of the kind of work that my dad did.\"\n\nHowever, she wasn’t exposed to the glamor present in Hollywood. “We were completely sheltered from that,” she added, “I think that that was a good call.”\n\nDallas Howard and Gabel moved from the East Coast to Los Angeles\n\nDallas Howard and Gabel have ties to the East Coast, and they lived there with their family for years.\n\nIn 2022, the family relocated to Los Angeles. At the time, the Spiderman actress hired her family friend, Claire Thomas, to decorate their new home.\n\n“Seth calls Claire ‘the bippity boppity boo lady,’ ” Howard told Architectural Digest, referring to Cinderella’s fairy godmother, “She’s just one of those creative people who has ideas and makes them happen.”\n\nThey are \"die-hard\" Star Wars and Star Trek fans\n\nThe couple’s L.A. home is full of references to their favorite films and destinations. Their guest bedroom is filled with pictures of tulips in homage to their love of Amsterdam, and the wallpaper in their dining room is reminiscent of the mystical forest in the movie My Neighbor Totoro, one of Dallas Howard’s favorite films.\n\nDallas Howard and Gabel love both Star Wars and Star Trek, and in their 2022 interview with Architectural Digest, they described themselves as “die-hard fans.” Their home’s rear facade shows a mural with two suns rising from the horizon, and their kitchen includes a Baby Yoda garlic holder."
