        "text": "On Sunday night, Bryce Dallas Howard arrived at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in a ruby sequined dress by the cannily named Dress the Population. But while most of the attendees were engaged in that old tête-à-tête of name-dropping the designer of a dress their savvy stylist helped them borrow, Howard’s ensemble had a much simpler origin story.\n\n“It’s a dress that I ordered late last year from Nordstrom,” Howard told Vanity Fair, via phone from Los Angeles earlier this month, “and I wasn’t sure exactly what I was necessarily going to use it for.” She was waiting for the right event, and Sunday’s ceremony, where she is nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie for Black Mirror, was it. She paid $308.\n\nHoward’s habit of buying her own, often very affordable, red-carpet apparel has minted her an everywoman fashion icon. Indeed, she is something like the Mrs. Dalloway of celebrity style: Bryce Dallas Howard said she would buy the red-carpet dress herself! The blood-red lace Alexis cocktail dress with cutout shoulders she wore to the Moet Moment Film Festival in January? It cost $497, and she bought it on fwrd.com.\n\nHer neon Greek-goddess gown at December’s Critics’ Choice Awards? A $240 Topshop cheapie (in red-carpet fashion terms, at least) from Nordstrom.com.\n\nThe same goes for the black jersey plunge-neck dress she wore to last year’s Critics’ Choice Awards—Balmain, fwrd.com, marked down to $845 from $1,300—and her 2016 Golden Globes dress—a $4,800 glitzy, fitted lace column sheath by Kate Middleton favorite Jenny Packham, bought in-store at Neiman Marcus.\n\n“It goes back to this thing of how you get ready for prom,” Howard said. “You go shopping with your girlfriends, and you try everything together.”\n\nThe idea that an adult woman buys her own clothing is somehow revolutionary—especially in these “stars are just like us” times—may sound condescending. (Howard is the star of the recently rebooted Jurassic Park franchise, starred in an episode of the cult show Black Mirror for which she is nominated at the SAGs, and has directed several short films and television episodes—of course she can pick out her own clothing.) But Howard’s red-carpet statement, as it were, is a small rebellion against the machinery of stardom that lately dictates complex collaborations between actors, stylists, and designers who are willing to shell out big bucks to get stars into their clothes.\n\nSo instead of Pinteresting mood boards with guru stylists, scouring runway shows from the front row, and negotiating complex deals with Paris fashion houses, you can find Howard scrolling through the Web sites of Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Net-a-Porter, Moda Operandi, and Asos.\n\nHoward had a style awakening, as it were, around the time of her Jurassic World press tour, in early 2015. She recognized that the samples available to borrow from fashion houses are limited in size, and, she said, “I am not sample size, I have never been sample size, I will never be sample size.” She had given the traditional stylist route a go, but “there were these two giant bills right around the time when I was having my first child that sent me into a tailspin,” she said, because on top of buying her clothing, she had to have them tailored, and then pay a stylist fee, which the studio graciously covered.\n\n“I realized that I needed to stop trying to have a conversation with fashion,” said Howard, who has perhaps the most chipper demeanor in Hollywood. “That I just needed to get back to having a conversation with myself, in what just looks and feels best for this thing that I’m going to tonight.\n\n“It’s not a huge existential thing: you look in the mirror. Do you feel good? Do you look good?” Howard mused. “Go to the party, enjoy yourself—you don’t have to think about it much more than that!”\n\nSo Howard and her agent conspired that shopping for her own press-tour wardrobe, rather than working with a power stylist and struggling to find available samples, would be “so much more fun.” The studio handed over the budget they would have used to pay the hefty stylist fee—a relief, Howard says, “because honestly, before these kind of press-related style interventions, I would spend an average of $200 a year on clothes”—to furnish her wardrobe. She now relies on a system of girlfriends to shop with her, look through possibilities online, and weigh in on what they like and don’t like, what works and what doesn’t. (She also discovered Spanx: “It’s like a hug!” she said, and cackled.)"
