Together Bryce and the ‘Nip/Tuck’ star have two kids; 15-year-old Theodore and 10-year-old Beatrice and were married in June 2006.\n\nThis is not the first time that Bryce has celebrated her husband in a public setting as she enthused about his “remarkable” parenting of their two kids.\n\nShe said: \"I was just in awe of him. Totally in awe,\" she said. \"He was really generous and selfless. And he was 24 when we had our first kid.\"\n\n\"That has continued and he's just a really engaged, devoted father. What we struggle with most is being like, 'Seth, make sure that you have boundaries for yourself and you take time for yourself. You're not just at the beck and call of the kids 24/7.' He's a best friend to them,\" Howard continued. \"He's a playmate to them. He's an incredible role model. He's a guide. He's just awesome. I'm so grateful to have the family that I do.\"\n\nLast month, Bryce gushed about her daughter’s “incredible kindness on her birthday.\n\nShe wrote: \"To watch Beatrice come into herself — a person with incredible kindness, sparkling wit, and genuine love for others and the world around her — is one of the greatest privileges in my life. Happy Birthday, Beatrice! Welcome to double digits!!\"\n\nLast week, The ‘Jurassic World’ star also had kind words to say for her son on his birthday: \"Theo, today you turn 15, but to your mumsie, you'll forever be my baby boy. Happy Birthday 'lil T-man, I love you so much.”"
