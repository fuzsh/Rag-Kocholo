The need for the will-they-won't-they sexual chemistry does not fall on us in this film. It's Laura [Dern] and Samn [Neill].\"\n\nTheir love for each other did not stop there, with Bryce - who has been married to Seth Gabel for more than 21 years and has 15-year-old son Theo and 10-year-old daughter Beatrice with - confessing that she is very “compatible” with Chris professionally.\n\nShe said: \"Chris is someone who I respect and admire and who I have a blast with, and we're just very compatible. Getting to have a friend like [that] in my life is absolutely amazing. And that doesn't go away, which is good.\"\n\nChris - who is married to Katherine Schwarzenegger, who is currently expecting their second child after she gave birth to their daughter Lyla in August 2020 and has nine-year-old son Jack with his ex Anna Faris - responded: \"Bryce is actually the secret weapon. If you're making a movie and you have the opportunity to have her involved in any way, you absolutely do it. And you'll be better in the end 'cause she was involved.\""
