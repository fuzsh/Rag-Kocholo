        "text": "I like the house - very cool light fixtures - but actually seems like a home.\n\nIs it just me or does the husband seem gay?\n\nThey are a charming couple, but the house is just ugly. The lamp fixtures all look like someone's particularly clumsy school project, the decoration is mostly art d√©co and 1960s with quirky touches that are just infantile (the kitty lamps in the living room, the dinosaur wallpaper and the dining room that looks like a cross between a playroom and a hotel's reception, the hideous \"momsie and whoopsie\" embroidered picture, etc). It's positive that they have not gone down the route of neo-rococo garishness, oversized McMansion tackiness or lifeless futurism that most celebrities seem to favour, but it's still rather chaotic and tasteless.\n\nI do like the abundance of plants, though and, as I have already mentioned, they appear to be a truly lovely couple.\n\n[quote]but it's still rather chaotic and tasteless.\n\nI kind of agree with you in that it looks like those two have a lot of time & money on their hands & a designer indulging their every whim, on the other hand, it seemed like the items in the house had a lot of meaning to them & they loved it, which seems like a better option than \"my designer picked everything out & made my house look like the lobby of the Four Seasons, Dubai\"\n\nI still like the light fixtures, but combined with the other \"stuff\", I can see where it becomes too much at some point.\n\nI would like to stay at the house, but not live in it - it would get real old, real fast for me. And I agree, her husband seems gay, so of course I looked him up and then realized he played Ava's son who stabbed himself in the liver on the final episode of season 2 of Nip/Tuck. He's cute. I did like Kendall Jenner's house on the same channel though which is much more my style of Spanish revival."
