He began his screen career doing guest spots on several well-known series, including \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" (NBC, 1999- ) and \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" (CBS, 2000-15). Moving quickly up the ranks, he had a meaty role as a Russian mobster running a crime family's Los Angeles-based prostitution ring in an episode of \"The Closer\" (TNT, 2005-12)."
