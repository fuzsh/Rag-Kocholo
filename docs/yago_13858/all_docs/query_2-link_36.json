        "text": "Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard, wanted to pursue acting from a young age and graduated from NYU’s Tisch School of Arts in 2003. She appeared in a several films including M. Night Shyamalan’s \"The Village.\" In 2009, she agreed to play Victoria in the third \"Twilight\" film.\n\nA year after graduating NYU, Howard's film career rolled forward, first in a supporting role as Heather in \"Book of Love,\" and then as a young blind girl in the M. Night Shyamalan thriller, \"The Village.\" Two years later she appeared in a second Shyamalan project, \"Lady in Water.\" Her other credits include \"Manderlay,\" \"As You Like It,\" \"The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond\" and \"Terminator Salvation.\"\n\nLike her father, Bryce Dallas Howard, who sometimes goes by the nickname of Bry, isn't shy about working on big-budget Hollywood films. In 2007 the actress, playing Gwen Stacy, was one of the stars in the third \"Batman\" movie. Then, in the summer of 2009, Howard's name bounded across the Internet and in movie publications when she was tapped to replace Rachelle Lefevre to play the villain Victoria in the upcoming third installment of the \"Twilight\" franchise.\n\nHoward became more recognizable to audiences as Gwen Stacy in \"Spider-Man 3.\" Her most recent films are \"The Help\" in 2011 and \"50/50\" also in 2011, both of which were critical and box office successes.\n\nHoward admitted to suffering from post-partum depression. Howard had difficulty breast-feeding, which she found to be more painful than experiencing natural child birth and would often cry in the shower. Rather than refer to her son by his name, she would call him \"it\". Feeling overwhelmed and unable to make decisions, Howard also felt not only disconnected from her husband and baby, but herself as well. With the combination of homeopathic treatments and sessions with a physician and a therapist, she overcame the depression, which lasted for about 18 months."
