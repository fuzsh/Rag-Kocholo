Growing up in Connecticut and falling in love with her husband at NYU, the East Coast is full of happy memories for the Argylle star, so it made perfect sense as a retreat from the LA working life. The couple had their hearts stolen by a quaint 18th-century replica cottage. Inspired by legends Jane Austen and Wes Anderson, Howard enlisted the help of designer and family friend Claire Thomas to brighten the previously dark interiors, injecting each room with vibrant colors and fabrics. But what makes the home truly special are the familial touches, from her grandmother’s extensive depression glassware collection to the piano she learned to play as a child. “In the end it became so much less about aesthetics and more about the place we spend our lives…It’s beautiful to be in a space where I’m able to dream about a future.”See more of Bryce Dallas Howard's charming cottage here.",

        "text": "Hello AD, I'm Bryce Dallas Howard,\n\nand welcome to my New York home.\n\nCome on inside, lemme show you around.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWe are in the living room right now.\n\nAbout six years ago, my husband and I and my children\n\nwere moving to New York\n\nand we knew that we wanted to live in this area.\n\nAnd so we kept driving around\n\nand my husband kept pointing at this house\n\nand he kept saying, Oh, I wish that house was for sale.\n\nJust a few days later, someone called us and said,\n\nWe saw that you were visiting houses in the area,\n\nthere's a house that's not in the market yet\n\nand we wanted to see if you would be interested,\n\nand it was this house.\n\nThis house was built in 1937.\n\nBut what I love about it is that it's actually a replica\n\nof an 18th century home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania,\n\nit's actually where I filmed my first movie,\n\na movie called The Village, over 20 years ago.\n\nSomething that was very important to preserve\n\nwas actually the wood on the ceiling and the floor.\n\nIt's very unique, the wood is over 90 years old\n\nand it is very important to preserve it.\n\nIt's one of the only houses\n\nwith this kind of wood left intact.\n\nAnd so in a way, the choices that were made in this room\n\nwas to showcase that wood\n\nand really celebrate the character of the house.\n\nThe curtains, they're Morris & Co,\n\nand it's actually called the Strawberry Thief.\n\nAnd if you look closely,\n\nyou can see that there are strawberries being stolen.\n\nBut we're okay with that.\n\nPretty much everything in this room is by Rejuvenation,\n\nwhich is a company I love so much.\n\nThis is my favorite chair on planet Earth\n\nand I'm gonna demonstrate what's so great about this chair.\n\nI just think this is so comfy, cozy.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWhen we got the house, this was like one of the rooms\n\nthat I fell in love with immediately,\n\nand there were already so many incredible qualities\n\nabout it.\n\nThe floors, this epic stove,\n\nI just found it to be so, so, so, so, so beautiful.\n\nWe added this island here and these bistro chairs,\n\nthey're from Serena and Lily.\n\nThere's sort of, they bring kind of like a Parisian vibe\n\nto the entire room.\n\nAs you can see over here,\n\nthere is a ton of depression-ware everywhere in this house,\n\nthis all belonged to my grandmother, my dad's mom.\n\nAnd she collected this depression-ware.\n\nAnd actually, I had it for years and years and years\n\nhidden behind doors and cabinets and whatnot.\n\nAnd the moment that Claire Thomas saw this, she was like,\n\nOh my gosh, this is the inspiration for the entire house.\n\nSo that's really beautiful.\n\nI also, I should say that I love this sink,\n\nyou shouldn't look inside of it, but it is so deep,\n\nI will demonstrate it with my hand.\n\nSo I'm now at the bottom of the sink.\n\nSo it's a very deep sink, which is fantastic\n\nbecause you can put a lot of dishes in there\n\nand you don't have to deal with it\n\nuntil it's peeking out of the top.\n\nDon't tell my kids I said that\n\n'cause I would never let them get away with that,\n\nbut definitely a selling point.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThis is the dining room,\n\nwhich can also be called the sunroom.\n\nI love this room.\n\nWe built this room,\n\nwe added it onto the house when we first moved in here.\n\nYou can see here the original stone exterior of the home.\n\nIt's a detail that I absolutely adore.\n\nWhen Claire was designing the house,\n\nI don't know why, but I just kept being really obsessed\n\nwith Sense and Sensibility and we were just\n\nleaning way into Jane Austen world.\n\nAnd so there's a kind of like light antique quality\n\nthat existed in all of the adaptations of her books.\n\nAnd so there's something just about this room in particular\n\nthat reminds me a lot of Sense and Sensibility.\n\nThis table here is a table that's been in my family\n\nfor a long time and it's great because it's big\n\nand I have a big giant family.\n\nThis is a lovely tablecloth that was custom made.\n\nAnd just a little detail here, tulips,\n\nmy husband and I fell in love in Amsterdam.\n\nAnd so there's always kind of like a tulip motif happening\n\nin our life.\n\nSomething to mention here, Morris & Co, again.\n\nAnd these drapes are actually very special,\n\nthey're called Willow Bow,\n\nand as you can see they're embroidered.\n\nBut it's this idea of bringing nature inside of the home.\n\nAnd this is a mint green after green depression ware\n\nthat my grandmother gave to me.\n\nThere's so much of it and it's absolutely so beautiful.\n\nThere's a piano, it's my family's piano,\n\nthey've made a point of telling me\n\nthat I do not own the piano,\n\nthat I am just borrowing the piano,\n\nbut this is a piano that I took lessons on\n\nwhen I was a kid and everything,\n\nand so it's great to have it to here.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThis is the office,\n\nwe actually used this room primarily as a classroom\n\nduring the pandemic, and since then it is my office.\n\nMost of the furniture is from Denver Modern,\n\nanother fantastic company,\n\nheirloom quality furniture, American made.\n\nOne of my favorite filmmakers is Wes Anderson\n\nand he has such a signature style.\n\nSo this room in particular is very Wes Anderson inspired,\n\nthere are vignettes and tableaus\n\nand all of that kind of everywhere.\n\nThere's a kind of playfulness about his filmmaking\n\nand his visuals that I really wanted to embrace,\n\nand yet it's also incredibly sophisticated.\n\nThis is the wallpaper.\n\nThe colors here, this kind of like dusty rose\n\nI just found to be really beautiful,\n\nit's bringing nature inside\n\nand it's really reminiscent\n\nof that kind of 18th century, kind of powder color palette.\n\nThe paint colors, again, it's that pink and mint green,\n\nit's from Claire Paints, but the actual name of the paints,\n\nthe pink is called Meet Cute,\n\n'cause this is a rom-com that's happening right here,\n\nand the mint green is actually called Two Scoops.\n\nSo it's adorable, absolutely adorable.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWelcome to the primary suite.\n\nThis room I adore, it feels like joyful springtime,\n\nand there's a reason why it feels joyful,\n\nit's because all the furniture in this room\n\nis from Joybird,\n\none of my favorite, favorite, favorite companies.\n\nI work out of my room 100% of the time, pretty much.\n\nI feel very cozy, very focused,\n\nand just for whatever reason,\n\nthe vortex that is my room is ideal for work.\n\nAnd so what that means is that I need a place to work.\n\nI don't love desks, but I do love giant, giant chairs.\n\nAnd this is called the Bryant Chair and a Half.\n\nI curl up on this and spend the entire day here,\n\nit's really an amazing chair.\n\nWhen I originally moved in here, we put a sofa in this room,\n\nbut it was kind of overwhelming the room,\n\nit wasn't really right.\n\nAnd so this bench was bought for $100 in auction\n\nin Hudson Valley.\n\nIt was just a fantastic solution\n\nbecause as you can see, I kind of use it to, you know,\n\nwhere I put my art books and some pottery and all of that.\n\nBut when folks come into the room,\n\nI can easily set these things aside\n\nand there's plenty of seating area.\n\nThis is a limited edition print\n\nfrom a Polish American artist named Maja,\n\nwho's based out of Los Angeles.\n\nAnd I found it really gorgeous.\n\nOh, Grandma Jean, Grandma Jean.\n\nSo this is the most important person,\n\nthis is my grandmother, my Grandma Jean, my dad's mom.\n\nShe was an actress and absolutely a total ham,\n\nshe was very hilarious.\n\nAnd so much of this house has really been inspired by her,\n\nand so the house is pink and green, thanks to her.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThis is the guest room, it's cold,\n\nI'm gonna legit light a fire.\n\nI love this room because it is a place that I love to go\n\nand like hang out, light of fire.\n\nBut because it's not the living room, I can shut the door.\n\nThere we go, this will heat up really soon.\n\nSomething that we did with this room\n\nwas we really repurposed and kind of zhuzhed\n\na lot of our vintage pieces\n\nthat we had gotten from Rubbish Interiors in Los Angeles.\n\nThis desk we've had for, gosh, almost 20 years.\n\nWe've had this lamp forever, we love this color green.\n\nAnd so it really inspired this Morris & Co wallpaper.\n\nLike when we saw this wallpaper, we were like,\n\noh my gosh, we know what room that wallpaper is going in.\n\nThe bedding, okay, this bedding is from Parachute Home\n\nand it's called a Cloud Duvet, feels like a cloud.\n\nMy husband has a very serious record collection.\n\nHere's a nice old record player here,\n\nand here are his records.\n\nAnd we hardly ever see him when he's in this room.\n\nSo this Claire also got on an auction\n\nand when you're bidding at an auction,\n\nthey give you a sense of the size,\n\nbut maybe it's an estimation,\n\nmaybe you're not actually reading it.\n\nBut this is meant to be a vase for flowers,\n\nit's actually an umbrella holder,\n\nbut it's super cool, super, super cool\n\nand works perfectly for flowers.\n\nSo this little vase is another tremendous example of scale.\n\nAnd when you bid for things online,\n\nyou might not have a sense of the size.\n\nAnd so this we thought was gonna be size of a regular vase.\n\nAnd it's a little itty bitty baby vase and I love it.\n\nSo we've got the very big asparagus umbrella holder\n\nthat holds flowers and we have the very mini little\n\nkind of Grecian vase.\n\nWe mis-assessed and we love it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThis is my daughter's room.\n\nMy daughter's favorite color is blue, so this room is blue.\n\nThis here, we actually had this built for her\n\nso that she could have a desk in her room\n\n'cause it's not a super giant space\n\nand there's a radiator under there.\n\nAnd so she gets to keep her legs very warm\n\nwhile she's doing her homework and whatnot.\n\nMy grandmother made this for me,\n\nshe used to sew a lot and she would make dolls for me\n\nand my Halloween costumes and all of that,\n\nand there are reminders of her everywhere.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAll right, this is the guest house.\n\nThis used to be an attic.\n\nAnd when I first came and looked at the house,\n\nit's actually above our garage.\n\nAnd I remember seeing this window and just thinking like,\n\nhuh, if there's a window,\n\nthen there must be some space up there.\n\nAnd so sure enough, we came up here\n\nand there's very, very low ceilings, admittedly,\n\nbut it was very obvious that this could be a usable space.\n\nMy husband's grandmother absolutely loved yellow,\n\nwe would always like\n\nfor her birthdays and Hanukkah and everything,\n\nwe would always get her something that was yellow.\n\nAnd so this space is an ode to her.\n\nParachute Home makes such great bedding,\n\nbut they also have come out with a furniture line.\n\nAnd so we've got this piece here, white oak coffee table,\n\nit's really nice, it really completes the space.\n\nI love to sit here, I love this little alcove,\n\nit's just the best.\n\nAnd I get to look out and be on my laptop\n\nand watch my neighbors walk by.\n\nIt's great, it's a great community.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nBye AD, thank you so much for coming,\n\nI'll see you next time.\n\n[upbeat music]"
