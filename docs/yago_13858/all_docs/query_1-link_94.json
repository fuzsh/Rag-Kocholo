        "text": "The life story behind writer/director M. Night Shyamalan is unlike that of any other major filmmaker working today. Born in India but brought to the United States when he was only six weeks old, Shyamalan wanted to become a filmmaker ever since he got his first Super 8 camera as a child. He had released two little-seen features when in 1999, he made “The Sixth Sense,” a psychological thriller that was successful beyond his wildest dreams, earning over $672 million and bringing him critical acclaim, including nominations from BAFTA, the Golden Globes, Writers Guild, Directors Guild, as well as two Academy Award nominations.\n\nShyamalan’s box office roll continued with his next two films, 2000’s “Unbreakable” and “Signs” in 2002. But with 2004’s “The Village,” critics began to turn on the filmmaker, citing their disappointment with his plot twist in that movie, a discontent that continued through 2006’s “Lady in the Water” and 2008’s “The Happening.” But Shyamalan never gave up.\n\nHe kept making movies, and audiences continued showing up in theaters, until Shyamalan finally returned to critical favor with 2016’s “Split.” Better reviews followed, with much praise also being lavished on his actors, including Dave Bautista in 2023’s “Knock At the Cabin” and Josh Hartnett in “Trap” (2024).\n\nSo, in honor of the continuing comeback of M. Night Shyamalan, let’s raise a glass and celebrate by counting down and ranking his 12 best films. Scroll through our best and worst rankings in the photo gallery below."
