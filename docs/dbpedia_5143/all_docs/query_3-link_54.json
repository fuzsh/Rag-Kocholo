        "text": "The General Intelligence Directorate is formally subordinate to the Syrian Ministry of Interior. All the same, in practice, it directly follows the President of the Republic, under the designation \"Unit 1114\", without passing by any service or ministry except when coordinating with the National Security Bureau. It has branches operating in all governorates with departments for parties, religions, the economy and others. The General Intelligence Directorate is US-sanctioned and EU-sanctioned, and it was added to the UK sanctions list on 24 August 2011."
