        "text": "Here’s my newest cartoon – another cliche cartoon about the military guy showing off and explaining his medals, regarding the recent sexual assault and harassment issues in the military.\n\nMy buddy, Milt Priggee did one of these today also, on the same topic, but Milt’s was a bit harsh and I don’t think it will get reprinted much.\n\nHere’s one I did recently when the military finally allowed for equal treatment of women in combat.\n\nI did this one when the military struck down “don’t ask, don’t tell.”\n\nHere’s one from when Hillary Clinton was running for president, arguing that she would be a great commander-in-chief.\n\nI did this one with the General Petraeus scandal.\n\nHere’s another nice medals cartoon by John Darkow, about the Petraeus scandal.\n\nCartoonists are so crazy-motivated to get awards, I think the cartooning awards should all come in the form of medals the cartoonists can wear to show off how much better they are then each other – kind of like peacocks flaunting their plumage. it would make our conventions more fun.\n\nHere are my new cartoons! The most recent one is about Obama’s response to the crisis in Syria. Drawing Arabs as dogs is deeply insulting – I suppose that just puts dogs onto cartoonists’ palettes of cliches. I may get some angry mail for this one. I’m annoyed by Obama’s worthless response to Syria, at the same time, I’m happy that Obama isn’t jumping in to chew it up in this Syrian dogfight when both sides look to be bad guys.\n\nThis one is a drawing of Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He’s a pretty easy caricature, and I think I nailed him.\n\n… still, I hate to put labels in cartoons – particularly when the label is to identify someone who is drawn with an identifiable caricature, something lousy cartoonists do when they can’t draw good caricatures. Sometimes I just can’t depend on the readers to know what the guy will look like and I have to put in a label – still I hate it, so I distributed a second version of this one without a label. I suppose this would work as an illustration for an op-ed piece about the turbulence in Turkey. He’s a fun guy to draw. I love the shape of his head. I also like his middle name – it sounds like something Paris Hilton’s dog would say.\n\nThis one is about the split in the Republican party on immigration Reform. I suppose we’ll see if any reform-candy comes out of that pinata next week.\n\nThe next one is a Muppet cartoon, with Cookie Monster the Republican enjoying all the White House scandals.\n\nRegular readers here know that I worked for the Muppets for the first half of my career and I’m a big Muppet fan. I draw a Muppet themed cartoon about once a year – this is a good excuse to show a few more …\n\nI drew this one back in the George W. Bush days when we were all talking about torture and water-boarding.\n\nI once illustrated a whole childrens’ book about Elmo – who claims a permanent space in my brain – oh! I hear the voice! I drew the one below when we got the news about the CEO of Chick-fil-A opposing gay rights, and the Muppets spoke out against it and in favor of gay rights – makes me proud of my Muppet roots.\n\nThis one was when congress was threatening to cut funds to public broadcasting – and Sesame Street.\n\nWhen the Sesame Street people decided to make Cookie Monster love vegetables, and made cookies a “sometimes food” I drew this one.\n\nI drew this one when there was a scandal at Goldman Sachs, and it was revealed that greedy, Wall Street types derisively call their clients “Muppets.”\n\nHere’s my weekly blog about my latest cartoons! The last two are about the drop in the stock market and rise in interest rates after remarks by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Here’s another take on the Wall Street bull.\n\nAnd here is Bernanke, trimming rates, only to see a little sprout of the economy bloom.\n\nBernanke, and Greenspan before him, have been trimming rates for a long time. This cartoon adds sprouts to a three year oldie (right). This one amuses me because it is the kind of thing our editorial cartooning professional organization will be discussing next week – whether to ban editorial cartoons that consist of alterations to previously drawn cartoons. The cartoon police may come down on me for ethical infractions like this one. Cartoonists are a humorless bunch, when it comes to “cartoon ethics.”\n\nThe previous cartoon was about the NSA eavesdropping scandal. Presidential ears tend to grow over the years in editorial cartoons, and Obama’s big cartoon ears have become absurdly huge among my colleagues. I once met Obama’s buddy, Susan Rice when she was UN Ambassador, and all she wanted to talk about was why I draw Obama’s ears so big. I didn’t have a good answer, except for “peer pressure.” I may keep drawing Obama’s ears small. Maybe the cartoon police will cite me for a small ears infraction too.\n\nThe next cartoon is about “Value Added” testing of teachers. This cartoon is just a list of the bad things value added testing encourages teachers to do. There have been lots of testing scandals around the country featuring these abuses, among others. I got an interesting response to this cartoon from defenders of teachers, who saw the cartoon as “teacher bashing” rather than testing bashing.\n\nIt has been too long since I have posted new cartoons here! I took time away for the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists convention in Salt Lake City. (You can see me opine on the convention with Rob Rogers and Pat Bagley here.) Then it was the end of the quarter and I had to pay the cartoonist royalties, another three days lost. So I’m late. But here are the missing cartoons!\n\nI drew this one of Edward Snowden a couple of weeks ago.\n\nIt wasn’t long before Ecuador was no longer talked about as a possible asylum for Snowden, so I drew a revision.\n\nToday it looks like Venezuela will be the lucky winner in the Snowden derby.\n\nThe next one is Obama sweeping some crud under the constitution rug. I thought about labeling the crud “NSA,” and I could have labeled it “Guantanamo,” but I decided labels are for sissies. Given the e-mail I get from readers, I probably should have labeled the constitution also.\n\nNext is Mohammad Morsi in his prison garb.\n\nThis one is actually in response to a reader comment. I had posted this oldie of Morsi on my blog …\n\nThanks to Cheryl Akins, who posted a comment that I should draw Morsi in prison garb now – and, of-course, she was right. I made his face a little cuter the second time around. I probably should have stuck with the uglier version.\n\nWith Egypt falling into chaos, I reposted one of my favorites from earlier this year.\n\nWhich brings us back to the Supreme Court’s DOMA and Prop 8 decisions. I drew this one.\n\nWe had a nice bunch of DOMA decision cartoons, but the best one came from by buddy Nate Beeler, who drew this big wet kiss that went viral on Facebook.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen an outpouring of love for a cartoon as I witnessed for this Beeler beauty. Nice work, Nate.\n\nHere is my weekly post on my new cartoons. My most recent cartoon, on George Zimmerman’s acquittal, was a quickie. Here is my rough sketch – I took a scan of the Community Chest Get Out of Jail Free card, made it light in a print out, and did a rough sketch on top.\n\nThen I dropped in the color. I had it all done in ten minutes, a new record for me. If only all of the cartoons were so quick and easy. Usually I muddle and fiddle for a long time with each cartoon. This one got a lot of attention in social media because it was fast.\n\nThe previous cartoon was Obama in the Arab Spring bathtub, with lots of dangerous appliances. Don’t stick a fork in the toaster! Here is the rough sketch – this one took some muddle and fiddle time to get the position and appliances to be the way I wanted them.\n\nThen I did the finished line art, and added a bit of gray to make it read a bit more clearly. The black and white image is what more readers see in the newspapers.\n\nAnd here is the color that you see on our site, and the newspapers that print in color. I had fun with this cartoon.\n\nThe previous cartoon was about the one year postponement in the employer mandate on Obamacare. Republicans “jumped on this” as evidence of Obamacare’s “failure” and “chaos.” Here is the rough sketch.\n\n… And here is the line art, that most people will see in the newspapers that print black and white. I always like to black and white version better. There is something more elegant about black and white. Readers always tell me that color is better.\n\nAnd here is the color. I did this one a little differently, with quick, transparent colors. I think I’ll probably do messier color like this going forward. I really like Pat Bagley’s sponge texture – that’s the next thing I’ll try.\n\nHere’s my weekly batch of new cartoons. The first one is my “Stand Your Ground” cartoon. Any cartoon about guns gets a lot of crazy response – as this one did. People are such nuts. Here is the rough pencil sketch.\n\nNext I did the finished line art. I dragged three different speech balloons into position in a layer in Photoshop, rather than actually drawing all the speech balloons.\n\nI had mixed feelings about whether to leave it as line art for the black and white version. There is something elegant about line art with no tone – but I couldn’t make up my mind, so I did a gray version, and I made both versions available to the syndication customers. Interestingly, half of the editors downloaded the line version, and half went for the gray version. Go figure.\n\nHere it is in color. I added some subtle texture to the ground.\n\nHere is how it looked the next day in my local newspaper, the Santa Barbara News-Press.\n\nLots of cartoonists were drawing cartoons that were critical of the media attention paid to the new baby future king of England. I thought I would go with cute rather than critical. I don’t have any angry feelings about this subject. Cute is fine with me. Here is the line art that most people will see in the newspaper.\n\nAnd here’s the color. I’m trying to do more color that looks like I’m using a sponge, as I used to do back in the days when i painted with gouache.\n\nWe almost saw the “Nuclear Option” happen in the Senate, when Senator Harry Reid threatened to get rid of the filibuster rules that Republicans were using to block Obama nominees. There was a compromise, but I suspect we’ll see this Nuclear Option thing happen again soon. Here’s the gray version, with sponge texture (the line art was too spare on this one, it needed gray tone).\n\nYes, that’s a very Herblockian “Mr. A-Bomb.” Gotta love Herblock. Here’s the color version, with spongy texture.\n\nMost of the country had a crazy heat wave last week, which is always a good excuse for a trite, Global Warming cartoon. This one was fun to draw, and I went with the line art – no gray tone for the black and white version of this one.\n\nAnd here’s the color version …\n\nThat’s it! I think I’ll draw Detroit tomorrow.\n\nHere are my three most recent cartoons! I just finished this one on the Republicans’ 40th vote against Obamacare and their recent attempt to shut down the government over Obamacare. They will be run over each time. They don’t learn.\n\nSince you folks like to see my messy, rough sketches, here you go …\n\nThe next one is the Arab Spring in Egypt. Here is the line art that most people will see in the newspapers.\n\nI try to do enough line work in these that I get some dark and medium areas to anchor the composition. I wouldn’t worry so much about that if I knew it would only run in color. The color version is below. I’m trying to use more texture in my color now, mostly with a rubber stamp pattern in Photoshop that looks like a sponge.\n\nAnd I did this cartoon about teachers, then and now …\n\nThis is a refurbished oldie which has been a big seller in pay-per-use. I noticed another nice book sale on this one in our system last week, and I thought the cartoon needed to be freshened up. Here’s the original …\n\nI always tell cartoonists not to put the year in their cartoons. For some reason artists like to put the year after a copyright circle ©, which just makes the old cartoons, that should sell as evergreens, suffer for their age. Now this cartoon isn’t dated, and I think it is greatly improved with the black and white in the first, 1960 panel.\n\nI noticed after I posted this last week that almost every newspaper subscriber was downloading it, even though I marked it as a revision. Some cartoons strike a chord. I got this idea from my Israeli cartoonist buddy, Uri Fink. Thanks again, Uri.\n\nI’ve been off the grid for a few days, driving my car to Nashville, Tennessee, which is a pretty foreign place. I’m struggling to set up my apartment here. My wife got a teaching job at Vanderbilt University and I’m coming along as a good spouse. I can draw cartoons anywhere. Here are some first reactions to Nashville …\n\nThe newspaper, Gannett’s “The Tennessean” is little, light and slight – like a ghost of what it surely once was. I can crumple the whole newspaper into a little ball with one hand. I saw bigger, thicker, healthier looking newspapers in smaller towns on the drive out. On newstands I see an altie paper called, “The City Paper” with a black front cover and reversed type displaying the headline “Why Nashville Needs Newspapers.” I arrived for “The City Paper’s” angst-filled last issue as they are going out of business.\n\nI’m in a giant apartment building in “Germantown” which is near downtown, and seems to be newly gentrified with yuppies and lots of construction of other, giant apartment buildings like mine. There are plenty of payday loan/check cashing stores, bail bondsmen, fast food fried chicken and a dearth of supermarkets here, so the gentrification has a way to go. I guess it’s fine.\n\nMy apartment has a view of a truck yard with rusty roofs and burly men who work very hard washing and loading heavy construction equipment onto trucks. It is a view I would have enjoyed when I was five years old.\n\nI also have a view of impressive thunderstorms, which seem to pass through here every day. As I write this, there are booms of thunder. The humidity is fantastic; I feel like I’m swimming everywhere. And the plants are all healthy. Even the weeds that battle with the concrete and asphalt are a healthy, bright green. When the zombie apocalypse comes, the plants will claim Nashville back from the concrete in just a few months.\n\nIn California, the weeds look unhealthy. When I neglect my lawn in California, it turns into a blotchy beige. Here, when people don’t tend their lawns, the lawns just get bigger and bushier and even more bright green. This place really wants to grow. I’ve read that this is the worst place in America for hay fever.\n\nI’ve spent my life as an urbanite living around New York or Southern California, so there is some culture shock. People here are unusually friendly. There seems to be a lot of smokers here. There are certainly a lot more trucks and ads for gun shows. Everyone wants to recommend restaurants to us, and the recommended restaurants are really quite good.\n\nThere is a music theme to this place, with guitar logos everywhere. There’s a huge, ugly, convention center that looks like it is styled after a colossal guitar. The music is a part of the culture that I don’t really understand or appreciate, but I can ignore the music. I guess I can ignore the truck yard too. It is harder to ignore the fried chicken.\n\nHere I sit in my new Nashville, Tennessee apartment, trying out a new restaurant for every meal, and finally drawing cartoons. I finished my second cartoon in Nashville today – a busy, crowd scene cartoon about Obama and foreign aid to Egypt. Here is my rough pencil sketch.\n\nI drew this first with a light, hard, #5 pencil to get the people in the crowd into the right composition, so they are interacting with each other, have expressive body language, their faces aren’t obscured, the feet and arms are on right … all those details need to be thought through for each figure; better to do it in a sketch than on the fly in in finished art. The line art is below. I debated whether to go with just line for the black and white version that most people see in the newspaper.\n\nHere is the gray-scale version. I thought it read a bit better with tone. I do the gray-scale separately. It isn’t just a gray version of the color cartoon.\n\nI usually avoid doing crowd scenes. When I was an illustrator, I used to do a lot of crowd scenes. I think art directors would sit in a brainstorming meeting and come up with a list of too many things that they needed to put in an ad – so they would call a cartoonist to jam it all into one piece of art. Cartoonists get these jobs because the lists are too long, so the art has to be crazy. In fact, crowd scenes are usually not very effective compositions. The most effective compositions show powerful character and expression, which is better done with large figures and faces. With too many little figures in a crowd, the power of the expressions and body language are lost to tiny details. That said, I hate to admit that sometimes a concept calls for a crowd scene.\n\nHere’s the color cartoon …\n\nThis one suffers from low resolution on the web, and will look much better in print, with crisp lines and texture in the tiny characters. Here is a detail.\n\nOne funny thing about cartoon crowd scenes; when readers send me unsolicited ideas for cartoons, the ideas are almost always for crowd scenes. The reader wants to say so much in his cartoon idea, that he comes up with a list of junk to include, just like the sloppy advertising art directors. Some ideas I get start with, “draw an army on the left, and another army on the right …” or the reader will write, “fill the sky with helicopters …” Not only am I too lazy for this, all the tiny details would be ineffective in the composition, and the cartoon would be lousy. For people who think in words, not images, these list-cartoons make perfect sense; to cartoonists, they are nonsense.\n\nThe previous cartoon is another Egypt/Arab Spring drawing. Here’s the rough pencil sketch. Notice that I drew Obama too low and made a note to move him up. I make lots of mistakes. Mistakes are easy to fix. Better to make lots of mistakes and have no fear of mistakes – at least in cartoons. I wouldn’t give that advice to my dentist.\n\nHere is the line art version that most people will see in the newspapers. No gray version for this one. I like to keep them as line art if possible – there is something more elegant about not having to rely on tone.\n\nAnd here is the color …\n\nThis cartoon is similar to one I drew a week earlier, with Obama and the Republicans. I like the yellow ochre texture background for dirty fighting scenes.\n\nObama doesn’t actually wear pinstripe suits. He wears plain black and blue suits, which are no fun to draw. So I take some artistic license. This recent Detroit-in-the-toilet cartoon also uses the yellow ochre, grungy theme that I’m fond of right now.\n\nAnother recent one I neglected to post is this one about the chilly relations with Russia – not much of a cartoon, just an illustration of chilly relations.\n\nSorry, with the move to Nashville I’ve fallen behind. I’ll catch up soon.\n\nNashville is starting to grow on me. I’ll get used to it soon – when it cools off and the humidity goes down.\n\nHere are my new cartoons! The big news the past couple of weeks has been the run up to war, and the run down from the rup up to war with Syria. Obama pitched the idea as hard as he could to a war-weary nation.\n\nWhen the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\n\nPutin saw an opportunity to jump in with a plan to get Syria to give up their chemical weapons, putting a damper on Obama’s bombing plans.\n\nI see that I have fallen behind on posting these. I’ll try to do better … so, there was a lot of Putin this week. Putin is fun, he’s easy to draw and he’s a funny character with his shirtless macho swagger that reminds me of Miley Cyrus’ twerking.\n\nA lot of pundits were talking about how Putin and Russia had “put America into a box.” which reminded me of Marcel Marceau.\n\nPutin looks pretty French in this cartoon, huh? Here’s Putin and Assad as the “Alien” from the “Alien” movies.\n\nI notice whenever the cartoons are about foreign news, our traffic goes down. We need more Miley Cyrus. Here’s my most recent cartoon, about the budget showdown in Congress, that hasn’t been getting as much news as it would if other things weren’t always happening.\n\nThis one is a little surreal, a little disturbing, and a little stinky. The last one is an oldie that I drew fifteen years ago when I was a local cartoonist in Hawaii, and there was a controversy about how gifted kids were treated in schools – as conscripted labor because they “didn’t need to study with the others.” This is something I recall with my gifted daughter, Susie, who was often put to work tutoring other students, by her lazy public school teachers.\n\nThat’s it for this week. Now I’m back to life in Nashville. For a guy who doesn’t go to church, doesn’t like football, doesn’t care about music and shouldn’t eat too much bacon – remind me, why am I in Nashville again?\n\nI will crawl out of my spider hole for two events! Come see me!\n\nI’ll be speaking, and giving a Powerpoint presentation, to the Southeast Chapter of the National Cartoonists Society (NCS) in Knoxville, TN on Saturday, October 26th, at about 11:00am, at the Crowne Plaza Knoxville (University), in Salon B on the mezzanine level. The NCS chapter folks tell me that anyone can come, so here is your chance to tell me off face to face, no hiding behind those nasty e-mails.\n\nI’m impressed with the NCS Southeast Chapter, they put on an ambitious gathering and have a lot of cartooning luminaries in their ranks. I’m looking forward to it.\n\nNext week I’m going to the big, international, editorial cartooning convention in St. Just le Martel, France. This is a little town that has decided that they love editorial cartoons – they built an impressive cartoon museum and the whole town comes out in wholehearted support of our troubled art form. They also love cows; this is French cow country, down by Limoges.\n\nThree of the cartoonists I syndicate are coming along, Pat Bagley of the Salt Lake Tribune, Steve Sack of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, and Bob Englehart of the Hartford Courant. I think this will be the biggest American turnout that little St. Just has ever had. And none of us speak French. Here is a list of all the attending editorial cartoonists, and the days that they will be in attendance.\n\nSo, if there are any editorial cartooning fans in France who want to visit with some obscure, American editorial cartoonists, the four of us will be hanging with all the other world cartoonists at the cartoon museum the second weekend of the Salon, October 4th, 5th and 6th.\n\nI just got back from the grand editorial cartooning festival in St. Just le Martel, France where I won the grand prix, the “Prix de l’humor Vache” award, which was an actual cow, named Josette.\n\nThe “Salon de St. Just, ” in its 32nd year, draws cartoonists from around the world to a tiny town near Limoges. The townspeople have adopted the cartoonists and hold a party that stretches over two weekends, in a grand cartoon museum they built in the middle of cow country. Most of the cartoonists stay in the homes of volunteer villagers – the entire event is put together by townpeople Cartoonists usually come for only one weekend of the festival, splitting the crowd between what becomes two different weekend groups of roughly 120 cartoonists each.\n\nThis was my second “Salon,” last year I went with our knuckle-dragging, conservative, “Tea Party” cartoonist, Eric Allie, who was a strange beast to the French. This year I went with three liberal cartoonists, Pat Bagley of the Salt Lake Tribune, Steve Sack of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, and Bob Englehart of the Hartford Courant for three days of open bar and schmoozing with our international colleagues.\n\nMy festival friends tell me that a cow is usually a placid animal, but sometimes the cow will get annoyed and give a swift, painful kick as a surprise to an unlucky bystander; this contributes to the idea that the cow is a little sneaky, nasty and unpredictable. The “Prix de l’humor Vache,” the grand prize they gave me, is described as an award for “caustic humor.” “Humor Vache” (funny cow) rhymes with “Amour Vache” (love cow, or more accurately “rough love”) a French idiom for a love affair that is nasty, consisting of harsh words and arguments. In France, to refer to someone as a “vache” (cow) is a little bit nasty. In contrast, on the first Saturday of the Salon, they give out the “Humor Tendre” (Tender Humor) award, which is a sheep, given to a sweet cartoonist such as a children’s book illustrator.\n\nThe Limoges area is proud of their cows, which are raised for beef and are all a warm brown color. The cow is the symbol and mascot of the Salon. Every year, the “Prix de l’humor Vache” cow is named “Josette” and is actually given to the winning cartoonist. At the ceremony, the mayor of St. Just, Gerard Vandenbroucke, awarded Limoges porcelain cows to my three American compatriots, dubbing them “Cagle’s cowboys.” Bob, Pat and Steve, who can also claim to have won cows (although, not real cows) took their little cows around to all the other cartoonists at the Salon to sign; it was charming.\n\nTypically, the winning cartoonist is expected to take a cash award (I still don’t know how much) in lieu of actually taking delivery of the real Josette, who would be difficult to check on a plane and would likely be an unpleasant roommate in my tiny, Nashville apartment. But, they make it clear that the cartoonist really won a cow and could actually take the cow if he or she chooses to, and there are stories of cartoonists in past years choosing to take the cow. I’m told that are some amusing movies of a past winner taking his cow to Paris, trying to bring the cow on the Metro, and taking the cow up the Eiffel Tower. If anyone can find these movies online, I’d love to take a look.\n\nPart of winning the grand prize cow is the obligation to do the art for the poster for the next Salon. The poster this year featured a lovely Degas-like ballerina cow. The festival people then dress a cow sculpture, in the entry to the museum, to match the cow on the poster. My plan is to give the cow on next year’s poster a very elaborate costume that will be a unique challenge for a St. Just volunteer to create for the cow statue. Right now, I’m thinking of doing the poster cow as Marie Antoinette with a huge, elaborate, flowing gown.\n\nThe whole event in St. Just is a lovely boost for our beleaguered editorial cartooning profession which is suffering in France as it is here and around the world with newspapers declining everywhere. I’d love to see some of the great French attitude about the value of editorial cartooning rub off on other parts of the world, like America, which treats cartooning as a second class art form. I can’t imagine a whole town in the USA choosing to build a municipal cartoon museum, opening their homes, and pitching together to cook dinner for hundreds of editorial cartoonists – and, of-course, a nine day open bar would be unthinkable in America.\n\nBelow is a scan of the Limoges newspaper front page and interior story from the day after I had a cow."
