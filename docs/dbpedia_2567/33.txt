Super Dave Osborne died. He was mortal!!! We saw him get run over and crushed a hundred times and fall off the CN Tower, and none of it really led to anything worse than a foul mood. It took leukemia, apparently, to finish him off. That’s how things go, I guess.

Super Dave was Bob Einstein (1942-2019), a performer and producer who was steadily before the public in various lightly worn guises for 50 years. Older readers will remember Einstein as Officer Judy, the policeman who would sometimes arrest the Smothers Brothers or their guests on a controversial CBS variety show (1967-69). Younger ones will know him mostly from brilliant recurring parts on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Arrested Development. He was, in the Osborne getup, a staple of David Letterman’s talk shows — practically a member of Dave’s repertory company, along with Charles Grodin and Kamarr the Discount Magician.

He was often introduced on talk shows as Super Dave even when he wasn't in character

To my generation, and to Canadians in particular, he was Super Dave. This alter ego was so popular that he was often introduced on talk shows as Super Dave even when he wasn’t in character. Friends like Norm Macdonald (whose forgotten sitcom had a wonderful Einstein guest shot) would address him as “Super.” In fact, this has reminded me to check Norm’s Twitter feed, and I see he has made this point himself: “I knew him for 30 years and never called him Bob. People forget how incredibly funny the name itself is. ‘Super Dave.’ Think about it.”

It is no coincidence that Norm and Super were close. Norm is a great exponent of minimalism in comedy, and as a performer Bob Einstein might have been comedy’s answer to Philip Glass. He had about three different moves, the main one being an icy stare of baffled contempt. And the Super Dave character is, forgive me, pretty much one gag. He also loved filthy jokes, the older and bluer the better: I am sure he chose the hair-raising one that Marty Funkhouser tells Jerry Seinfeld in the Curb episode “The Table Read.”

As a performer Bob Einstein might have been comedy's answer to Philip Glass

He turned these tools into a career full of exquisite acting highlights in the way Schubert used the notes of the scale. It might be argued that he had a greater oeuvre, at least as a performer, than his brother Albert Brooks. Perhaps it seems ludicrous to compare an auteur-philosopher like Albert to the galoot who played Super Dave. But you must remember that Bob Einstein was, in his early 20s, the big sahib at one of television history’s headwaters: the Smothers Brothers writing room that also featured Steve Martin, the Einsteins’ childhood pal Rob Reiner, and a half-dozen other people who would go on to shape American comedy.

If you’re one of those people who thinks everything is worse now politically than it has ever been, you should learn the story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, a shockwave ratings hit that was yanked off the air as a virtually unapologetic act of political censorship. The turmoil over the Smothers Brothers show probably played a part in steering Super Dave toward Canada, a second home he loved and was loved in.

One of the writer-producers in the Smothers shop was a Winnipeger named Allan Blye: there’s a street named after him there now. Blye and Einstein formed a long-lasting creative partnership and spent the ’70s making variety shows for stars like Sonny and Cher and Redd Foxx. (The Super Dave character emerged somewhere from that series of programs, though no one seems certain of his exact genesis. Einstein has said he created the bit out of restlessness — he just wanted to escape the studio and make something — although Super Dave segments seem a little expensive for such a story to hold water.)

Turmoil over the Smothers Brothers show probably played a part in steering Super Dave toward Canada

In 1979 Blye and Einstein made a pilot for ABC, a risqué sketch-plus-variety show called Bizarre. The pilot, believe it or not, starred Richard Dawson. Some say it worked, some say it didn’t. The network balked. But this was ’79, not ’69: Einstein and his Canadian pal had options. They turned to the fledgling cable channel Showtime. Showtime liked the concept but couldn’t offer much of a budget.

Thus, Plan C, C for Canada: move to Toronto, hire the funnier John Byner in place of Dawson, and use inexpensive Canadian actors and crew to make two versions of the show. (Viewers may remember that Bizarre also relied heavily on what media companies call “contra”: the Royal York Hotel got a big fat plug at the end of each episode in exchange for discounted accommodations and shooting locations. Accountants love contra.)

The Showtime-friendly Bizarre had nudity and profanity; the sanitized version aired on Canada’s CTV in prime time, back when most of us received two or three channels, and marched on to international syndication. It also spawned Canadian-made Super Dave specials and videocassettes that Letterman appearances helped sell to Americans who didn’t have cable. “The Canadian dollar at that time was 12 cents,” Einstein recalled in a 2007 interview with the comedy historian Kliph Nesteroff. “So it was very, very fortunate.”

As Canadians, we are prouder of dumber things than this. (No mere comedian would ever be made an “honorary citizen.” Not officially.) Much of the innovative legacy of Bizarre has been lost to time, and what survives on YouTube has not aged well, but Einstein’s stuff remains perfect. Einstein, when not in Osborne garb, was often on stage portraying an angry producer, “Bob Einstein,” who would cut flagging sketches short and give Byner that flat, lethal stare.

It would be an understatement to say the show broke the “fourth wall” often: it annihilated it routinely, in a way that less farcical and bosomy programs would later be celebrated for. I have given only the lightest overview of Super Dave’s comic, commercial, and technical accomplishments here, but I hope you will pass on from this column with one thought: “Damn, that Einstein guy was brilliant.”
