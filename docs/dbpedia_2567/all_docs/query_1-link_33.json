        "text": "On Wednesday, actor and comedian Bob Einstein passed away at the age of 76. Einstein was most widely known for his creation and portrayal of goofy stuntman Super Dave Osborne, as well as his roles on shows such as Curb Your Enthusiasm and Arrested Development.\n\nPeople will remember for Einstein, a two-time Emmy winner, for a wide range of his roles and other reasons, but Super Dave holds a special place among them. Today, we’re thinking of some of his best and most memorable stunts and skits.\n\nOf course, we would have to start with his wrecking ball stunt, when the daredevil was wrecked for our entertainment.\n\nEinstein’s first variety show with the Super Dave character got its start in Toronto. He endeared himself to Canadians very quickly with his jump from the top of the CN Tower.\n\nThe guy loved his jumps.\n\nThe piano on the top of the truck stunt is a classic. This had maybe one of the best twists to any Super Dave stunt ever!\n\nThis archery stunt had us all holding our breaths for real.\n\nSuper Dave even roped Mr. T into one of his crazy stunts, and it was everything that we could’ve hoped for.\n\nSuper Dave loved his motorsports too, of a sort. First, he roped a demolition derby car into a ridiculous stunt — and then, he would one-up himself by bringing in monster trucks.\n\nHow could we forget the balloon ball stunt? This led to some of the most memorable Super Dave imagery that we can recall.\n\nRest in peace, Bob Einstein.​"
