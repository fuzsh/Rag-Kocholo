        "text": "From the team behind HBO’s If You’re Not In The Obit, Eat Breakfast and The Bronx, USA, The Super Bob Einstein Movie celebrates the life and legacy of the late actor, writer, and producer Bob Einstein. The film features some of Einstein’s greatest comedic contributions, including his iconic alter-ego \"Super Dave Osborne,\" his work both behind and in front of the camera on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, and his defining role as the unforgettable Marty Funkhouser on Curb Your Enthusiasm. The documentary explores Einstein’s unlikely discovery and enduring career, exploring the many layers of Einstein’s comedy from the people that knew him best.\n\nIn addition to a slew of archival clips, Einstein’s unique sensibility is remembered by his family, friends and fellow comedians, including Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, Susie Essman, and many more. In keeping with Einstein’s wry joke-telling and daring physical comedy, The Super Bob Einstein Movie is a celebration of Einstein’s uncanny commitment to his work and a moving, fittingly-funny tribute to a beloved pillar of the comedy community who had a lasting impact on generations of legendary comedians.\n\nThe Super Bob Einstein Movie is written, produced and directed by Danny Gold, and produced George Shapiro and Aimee Hyatt. Michael Mayhew serves as writer, editor, and consulting producer; Robert Bader and Berta Einstein also serve as consulting producers. Featuring music by Barenaked Ladies."
