        "text": "Super Dave has been accused by Business week of selling himself out. Super attempts to dispel this by showing how fair the prices are on all his merchandise, and how he is willing to set a limit. Ronn Lucas shows how to make a puppet with old socks, creating a lady puppet and a turtle. Super Dave gets strapped into a chair and attempts to hold on to the back of the Super Dave pickup truck for 30 seconds while Fuji tries to drive it away. However, he only manages to hold on for 29 seconds and calls it quits."
