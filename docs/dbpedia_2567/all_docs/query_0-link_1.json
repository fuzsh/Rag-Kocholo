Ronn Lucas shows how to make a puppet with old socks, creating a lady puppet and a turtle.

Super Dave has also been accused by Time Magazine of keeping a three million dollar satellite dish for himself rather than using it for the show. He attempts to denounce THIS by having the Smothers Brothers all the way from Los Angeles on the monitor. They sing \"Boil That Cabbage Down\" and get messed up when Tom misses his cue. At the Super Dave Tarmac, Fuji helps Super perform the \"Chair Ski Ride to Death\" stunt, where Super will sit on a chair with skis, and a rocket powered truck will pull him and make him go up a kick ramp and jump a bus.\n\nSuper introduces Roy Firestone from ESPN, who does impressions of celebrities singing the national anthem (with a huge portrait of himself in the background). The studio has taken two people at random, Eric and Amelie, from the audience and given them makeovers and new outfits, and they also perform a dance act. Super and Donald give a tour of the new Super Dave Special Effects Studio, demonstrating driving through a fake concrete wall, a fake gunfight, and finally the rain room, where a pipe grid overhead simulates a rainstorm.\n\nSuper Dave shows how insulting it is that \"Eye on the City\" programs simply use beautiful women to attract viewers. Ronn Lucas brings a kazoo and a microphone to life, and performs with Buffalo Billy the cowboy singing \"The Auctioneer\" by Leroy Van Dyke.

He rounds off the tour with the Super Dave Haunted House Ride, which has \"Monster Mash\" by Bobby Pickett and the Crypt Kickers playing.\n\nCandi and the Backbeat sing \"The World Keeps on Turning\". At the new Super Dave Ace Award hall of fame, Super has won his own Ace Award Ceremony after waiting so long for it. Fuji and Super give a tour of Super Dave memory lane. We see caricatures of guest stars, Super's outfits, and Super Dave memorabilia. You can even watch video clips of his stunts and check out the actual Ace Award ceremony. Super then dedicates the whole building by signing his name in wet cement in the middle of the building, which will then be sealed up.\n\nSuper tries to hold a contest where viewers guess how many bulbs are in the \"SD\" shown on the billboard, but he is once again interrupted by Michel Lauziere trying to impress the audience with his tricks. On the Super Dave Super Barge SS Super, Fuji helps Super to perform his big stunt to get into the Guinness book of records, where Super will be put in a straitjacket, locked in a safe, put underwater, and will solve a Rubik's cube in two minutes. As an added precaution, explosive charges and communications have been rigged into the safe in case of emergency. Back in the studio, Clarence Clemons performs with his band.\n\nAt the Super Dave Rolling Green Acres Memorial Golf Course, the 18th hole has just been finished. As Super plays the hole, Fuji then reveals what the land the final hole is on used to be. In the studio, Super brings a young man, Tony Ford, up on stage for his \"Place the Face Contest\", where he has to identify photos of celebrities, then play Jerry Lee Lewis' \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" on the piano. At the Super Dave test track, Fuji helps Super demonstrate the \"Ultimate Safety Vehicle\". A semi goes through and mows the vehicle down, and Super analyses the collision on his computer to see how much impact each part got in order to improve the safety features. He intends to send the truck through again, but he reads a glitch in the system, and orders the truck not to hit the car.\n\nFuji and Super open up the new \"Super Dave Autograph Pavilion\" by having Super sign autographs for little children and asking them their favourite stunt. Super then gives a heartfelt speech about not charging for autographs. Billy Vera sings \"At This Moment\". At the Super Dave Car Show of the future, Super shows off several cars powered by alternative energy sources, as well as some fancy bicycles. Fuji demonstrates his own invention, the \"Friend\", which is a car that responds to the owner's requests by tapping a secret code on the surface of the vehicle.\n\nTime once again for the best of Super Dave! As per audience requests, we see the \"Star Car\", the Super Dave Golf video, the blooper tape of the girl throwing it to Mike Walden, the Senior's amusement park's haunted house, and the Home Alone house. Tony Cox is unable to attend the show, but he sends in his request, for Country and Western days."
