        "text": "By Iain Blair\n\nNow in its second season, Life & Beth is a semiautobiographical dramedy created by comedian Amy Schumer that explores the ups and downs of the growing relationship between her alter ego, Beth, and boyfriend, John (Michael Cera). As they get more serious about their future together, Beth begins to examine the possibilities of marriage and having a family as she and John seek answers for their communication problems.\n\nIn addition to creating and starring in the Hulu series, Schumer also writes, directs and executive produces. I recently spoke to her about making the show and her love of post and editing.\n\nYou’re involved in almost every aspect of production and post on this. What’s the most enjoyable part for you?\n\nThe writing and the editing are probably my favorite parts. Not to make it sound like we don’t have a joyful experience on-set, but I love writing, and then I love the experience of cutting it together and that whole new world, that iteration of the project.\n\nWhat’s the part you dread that’s the most stressful?\n\n(Laughs) I don’t like getting hair and makeup done. I think performing is probably the most stressful, and I like performing, but it’s just the least enjoyable of the other things because I enjoy all those so much.\n\nWho is your showrunner?\n\nDan Powell on this season. Colleen McGuinness was showrunner on the first season.\n\nYou’ve directed several episodes for both seasons. Talk about directing, and how you prepared.\n\nThat’s my favorite. I’m a student, and I’m trying to get better. I studied at NYU in its grad department for directing. I was pregnant, and I just tried to learn about each of the different jobs that you all collaborate on for a film or show like this.\n\nIt’s so helpful to know what everyone does on a production and understand their jobs. This way you can empathize and help them do it better. It makes you a better writer, director, performer, everything… and more efficient.\n\nTell us about your approach to directingAnd how do you collaborate with your DP when you direct?\n\nWe shoot in New York, and for the first season, our DP was Jonathan Furmanski. We talked a lot about not using typical coverage and not wanting to use the sort of shots that comedies generally rely on. We wanted to be really specific about what we said with each shot and camera move and what we wanted to create. We carried that into the second season, where our DP was Rob Barocci. I would say we were very open-minded with what we wanted for each scene. We did a scene in this last season — it was either Episode 7 or 8 — where Michael Cera and I are fighting, and I’m pregnant and we can’t connect. We are just so disconnected. And I remembered this scene in Shortcuts, the Robert Altman film, where Julianne Moore is bottomless — of course, we all remember this — and she’s blow-drying her shirt.\n\nI kept thinking of that scene, so I rewatched it and realized they’re never in each other’s coverage. So we filmed that scene on Michael’s side and then on my side; we were never together. Then, in the last couple frames of that scene, we come back together. We were trying to be intentional with all of the moves and all of our decisions on how to film stuff, hoping the viewer wouldn’t notice any decisions we made as filmmakers.\n\nWe, of course, are going to be more in tune with that stuff, but if I, as a viewer, can watch something and really get lost in the story and not notice more than just, “Oh, that’s a cool shot,” or “I think that was all one shot,” then that’s a real success — not noticing all that stuff and just going on a ride.\n\nLet’s talk about post. Where did you do it all?\n\nAt Great City Post in New York, and we used to do a lot of stuff at Running Man Productions. Aimee Roth was our post supervisor, and we had three editors: Nathan Floody, Casey Brooks and Laura Weinberg. They all work well together. Sometimes they worked remotely, but they were mostly in rooms next to each other. We talk and discuss cuts while they’re editing, especially depending on who’s cutting the episode, but I really like to let them breathe and have them tell their own story so that they don’t feel too handcuffed. I let them do their thing because they’re so talented.\n\nTalk about working with the editors on the episodes you’ve directed.\n\nLaura Weinberg was the lead editor on all the episodes I’ve directed. We worked together on my sketch show as well, so we’ve known each other for a long time and have a good vocabulary with each other. We are friends too. We enjoy the same reality shows and whatever, and so we’ll be laughing about a certain look that Yamaneika Saunders, who plays Maya, gave, and we just feel very safe around each other and protected as women and the story we’re telling.\n\nShe has incredible vision and understands how to capture these nuances and knows to let go when something’s not working. We’ve had a really great, easy time communicating. I try to work with her on everything and with Nate Floody and Casey Brooks too, but Laura just always edits my specific episodes, and we do all the editing at Great City.\n\nThe sound and music are a big part of the show. Tell us about that.\n\nWe actually created a band and recorded them at Electric Lady Studios. Our composers, Ray Angry and Timo Elliston, gave each character its own sound, its own composition for when it comes in, and a vibe. We used needle drops, of course, but forming a band was part of it to help create the mood.\n\nI’ve done a lot with Ray and Timo, who I love. They composed music for other projects I’ve done, and they’re extremely accomplished musicians. Ray has collaborated with everyone — artists like Lauren Hill — and he’s kind of in The Roots. And I love going to Electric Lady Studios, which is amazing.\n\nWe experimented this season with some opera and seeing how different instruments work for a moment or a character and discovering that together — just being open to what they’re feeling and where they’re at musically and creating a world for this show. This show is a very musical experience, and we had a lot of free jazz in the first season, a lot of experimental jazz. Then, in the second season, we went into more orchestral and operatic stuff.\n\nIt sounds like you enjoy the whole post process, especially working with the editing and all the sound and the music, right?\n\nAbsolutely. That’s my favorite part of post. Then I love doing little screenings with my collaborators, getting to watch a cut with the musicians, with the editors and producers and some of the writers. We watch together and celebrate what we worked so hard on and have some margaritas and food.\n\nThat must affect the final cut, if you take into consideration people’s thoughts about the previews. Do you go back and rework something if you’re not sure about it?\n\nOh, yeah. As a standup comedian, the audience is king. It’s all about the people’s experiences. I can have an intention, but if that intention is not translating, I want to address it. And it’s been interesting. I just filmed a movie for Netflix, Kinda Pregnant, with Adam Sandler producing for his Happy Madison Productions. It is a woman’s story, and women and men will feel — I don’t think this is shocking — differently about something. So polling both men and women, we were like, OK, this is a female comedy. We’re going to go with the choice that resonated with the women.\n\nThe show has a lot of surreal moments with quite a few visual effects. How involved are you in that part of post?\n\nI’ll have the idea for the visual, and I love working with all the VFX and figuring out that vocabulary of how to make it work. For instance, I’ll be like, “I want this branch to break and fall, so how do we make that work?”\n\nVFX supervisor Ed Munday, who co-founded Pig Apple, did all of them. He did all the VFX on Inside Amy Schumer as well, and he’s so helpful, experienced and great at translating my ideas.\n\nI’m assuming that in postPerspective’s audience there are a lot of aspiring or working filmmakers, and my advice is not to worry about how to get the language perfect. Do not be embarrassed because you’re not a visual effects person. I’m not in visual effects, but I can do my best to describe what I want to see and can collaborate in that way and get to a solution because I always like to work with some magic realism and have some surreal moments.\n\nThat was a big thrill for me in the first season, like the scene where Ann, my sister’s character, played by Susannah Flood, winds up swimming in a bathtub with a goldfish. It was just the most joyful thing to film and to watch come together with all the VFX.\n\nWhat about the color grade and working with the colorist? Are you involved in that?\n\nI’m usually there for the sound mix and the color correction, but I’d say that producers Dan Powell and Ryan McFaul take the lead on those sessions. Then I usually watch a cut or two and give some feedback to them and our colorist, Anthony Raffaele. Sometimes I’m in the color correction, but not for every episode. I love all the parts of post.\n\nAre you thinking about Season 3 yet?\n\nI’m thinking about it. I don’t know if Hulu is, but we have a phone call in a few days, so wish me luck!\n\nIndustry insider Iain Blair has been interviewing the biggest directors in Hollywood and around the world for years. He is a regular contributor to Variety and has written for such outlets as Reuters, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe.\n\nBy Iain Blair\n\nCreated by Steve Martin and showrunner John Hoffman, Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building stars Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez as three New Yorkers with a shared interest in true crime podcasts. They become friends while investigating suspicious deaths in their affluent Upper West Side apartment building and producing their own podcast about the cases.\n\nRecently renewed for a fourth season, the Emmy-nominated show features the work of editor Shelly Westerman, whose credits include Nora Ephron’s You’ve Got Mail and Julie & Julia, HBO’s The Wire and American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace. She was an ACE and BFE nominee for her editing on Only Murders in the Building, Season 2.\n\nI spoke with Westerman, who has an Emmy nomination for her work on Versace, about the challenges and workflow.\n\nWhat’s your collaboration with John Hoffman like?\n\nWe start very early on… when we first get the scripts. Then there’s casual conversations between him and the editors, about what’s coming, and then there is a full schedule of meetings. We do a concept meeting with the production designer and costumer designer and all the departments, which allows us to get an idea of the episodes. Then we have a separate meeting with the directors, editors and John, with a lot of discussion about how each scene is going to play out. We also listen in on all the production meetings so we can figure out the logistics of how the episode is going to go down.\n\nAll of those components give us a really good idea of what we’re stepping into, and once we get the footage, we go through the process of the editor’s cut and the director’s cut. Then we send it out to John and EPs Dan Fogelman and Jess Rosenthal to get their feedback, and then we start our one-on-one work with John to dig into the episode.\n\nHe’s on-set or watching on a monitor in his office, so he’s very familiar with the material. He and I developed a relationship in Season 2, so we were more prepared for Season 3. The editors knew his likes and dislikes. We’d often prepare alternative sequences to have ready to show him, so there’s a lot of background prep work going into the actual work process with him. He’s usually very busy shooting, so it’s late at night or on the weekends when we get time with him during production.\n\nHow many episodes have you cut on the show?\n\nI began on Season 2 and cut Episodes 2, 5, 8 and 10. I also cut Episodes 2, 5, 8 and 10 on Season 3. And I got co-producer credit on Season 3.\n\nDid that involve a lot of extra work?\n\nIt did, but it was good since I have a side of my personality that serves me well with the work. And coming from feature films, where editors are very much involved in the whole post process from start to finish, it was a bit of a shock when I transitioned to TV, where you have a much bigger post staff that takes over some of those duties. So it was more work, but it was worth it to be involved with the process and be able to see things through.\n\nWhat were the main challenges of editing this show?\n\nThe hardest part is always balancing the comedy with the dramatic and the more poignant emotional moments without getting lost in them. We have a great team of collaborators, like composer Siddhartha Khosla, who always has my back. I might cut a scene and use some really dramatic music. Then I’ll show Sid and he’ll go, “Shelly, we’ve got to pull that back. Let the actors do their thing.” And he’s usually right… but sometimes he’s not, and I love that back and forth. It’s the same with [re-recording sound mixer] Mat Waters, who’s in charge of our sound department. I’ll show him something and ask for his opinion, and if we need some texture in the background, he’ll jump in with some sound effects. It’s also about our core trio of actors and making sure we’re focusing on them and tracking their relationships.\n\nWhat was the most difficult scene to cut and why? And how involved is John in the problem-solving process?\n\nIt’s been very interesting because. John’s a great showrunner in that he also thinks like an editor, and he’ll almost always patch a difficult cut.\n\nI was having trouble with a cut in Season 2 in a scene with Steve Martin and Shirley MacLaine. The rhythm wasn’t right, and I couldn’t figure it out. Sure enough, he looked at it and said, “Everything’s great about the scene except that one cut,” and it was the cut I was struggling with. He suggested trying a few more frames on Steve’s side of the cut. I did that, and it was perfect. It’s so fun to be free, knowing that if something’s not OK as is, you’re going to work on it together. That alliance you build with someone who sees things the same way you do is really special.\n\nAnother example is Episode 10, the finale of Season 3. It was quite challenging because we had to find a way to tell the story visually, and there was a lot of intercutting between Martin Short and Paul Rudd’s characters, which was very tricky. We had Paul for the entire song sequence, and he shot with Meryl Streep for two months before we shot the scene, as he had to leave. Then we shot the whole thing with Marty and then had to figure out how to match the cuts. In addition, we had to trim out some of the song for time, which affected our storytelling and where people were geographically.\n\nI assume you must have used a lot of temp sound?\n\nYes, and we chose scenes very early on for Sid. He starts composing while we’re still shooting. If we had a longer schedule or more time, he might not get the episode until a director’s or producer’s cut is ready, but since we move so fast, he’s often doing sketches of scenes and writing stuff very early on.\n\nNow we have a lot of his music stored, so we can go and pull from old cues and edit those together to give us some idea. He’ll give us his score material in stems, so sometimes I’ll cut and patch, take a piano from here and woodwinds from there to create a temp.\n\nDid you use any temp VFX shots?\n\nYes. We had an on-staff VFX artist, Josh Bryson, this season, who helped us with temps in addition to our VFX editor. Our assistants do great temps too. Our VFX editor did some of that technical work and also managed all the VFX shots. Our main VFV vendors were Molecule, who did the bulk of the work, and Ingenuity. We also had Atlanta VFX in Atlanta and AB Studios in India.\n\nTell us about the post workflow and the editing gear you used.\n\nThe show’s shot on the Sony Venice 6K at 1:85. Pacific Post was our fabulous Avid vendor. We used Avid 2018 with Nexis storage, and we were fully remote using Jump Desktop. We reviewed cuts using PacPost.live, which is similar to Evercast.\n\nPicture Shop processed our dailies in New York City, then sent them to LA for color timing. Our media was transcoded to Avid DNxHD 36. Dailies media was pushed to our Nexis storage. All final color timing was done in LA by colorist Timothy Vincent. We used Formosa for sound, and Mat Waters and Lindsey Alvarez were our sound mixers.\n\nHow would you sum up the whole experience?\n\nIt’s so much fun. John always brings such a sense of joy to it all. And I’d previously worked with Payton Koch and Peggy Tachdjian — the other editors this season — on other shows, so we had a great shorthand. The show was just renewed, so we’re all excited about Season 4.\n\nIndustry insider Iain Blair has been interviewing the biggest directors in Hollywood and around the world for years. He is a regular contributor to Variety and has written for such outlets as Reuters, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe.\n\nBy Iain Blair\n\nReasonable Doubt, from executive producer and director Kerry Washington, is a new crime drama from Hulu and Onyx Collective. The series is centered on a high-powered female criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles, Jax Stewart (Emayatzy Corinealdi), who uses her questionable moral compass to guide her through the policies and laws in the LA legal system.\n\nCinematographer Robert E. Arnold shot the show as a first-time alternating DP with co-DPs Kira Kelly, ASC, and Michael Negrin, ASC.\n\nI talked with Arnold — whose credits include TV series Astronomy Club and The Tam and Kevin Show as well as the film Gun and a Hotel Bible — about shooting the show and how he collaborated closely with the post team on the visual effects.\n\nHow many episodes did you shoot and can you describe the look of the show?\n\nI shot episodes 3, 4, 7 and 10, which is the finale. I also operated on the pilot, before I was awarded the alternating DP position, so I had a good idea of what the look was going to be before I began shooting. Since I was there at the inception, it wasn’t too hard to maintain the look.\n\nDuring the pilot, the two major references were the George Clooney legal thriller Michael Clayton and Licorice Pizza, and I was fortunate enough to have Licorice Pizza gaffer Justin Dixon as my gaffer. We’ve worked together on various projects in the past, and on this one we went for a very artistic, cinematic look centered on an almost architectural composition in some ways — though things shifted when we were on location.\n\nThe goal wasn’t to have a ton of key-stoning and buildings. We also wanted to stress the contrasts levels without making them too heavily rooted in our references so we could make the overall look our own.\n\nThere are two other DPs, so how does that work in terms of continuity of look?\n\nI already knew Kira Kelly, who brought me on to operate for her on the pilot, and we had at least two meetings where we discussed creating the look in detail and how we’d approach the pilot, which was directed by Kerry Washington.\n\nThen Michael Negrin, the other alternating DP when we went to series, actually ended up having to defer to me, as I was there for the pilot. And along with Raamla Mohamed, the showrunner, I’d adapted the pilot look for the series. The main thing was not to let it get overlit and too bright, like a sitcom.\n\nTell us about collaborating with Kerry.\n\nShe’s definitely an actor’s director in the way she works and approaches a scene. She knows exactly what she wants, and she trusts the DP to get her there.\n\nHow did you decide on the camera and lenses?\n\nWe shot the pilot on the Sony Venice 1 and kept using it for the whole series. The thing that changed was the lenses. We began with large-format Panavision Primo lenses and then switched to Zeiss Supremes. I’m a big Panavision lens fan, but for various reasons, we made the switch to Zeiss Supremes and Falcon Gekkos.\n\nFor most of my episodes I stuck to the Supremes because I like their contrast, the lens flare and the way they perform. I didn’t use the Gekkos much.\n\nWhat about the lighting?\n\nThe goal in paying homage to Michael Clayton and Licorice Pizza was to make it all look as natural as possible, and that’s always a challenge when you have a variety of your work on-stage versus at practical locations. On a nine-day shooting schedule, we were on-stage for about three to four days, and I always aimed for natural realism. I added a bit of haze in a room whenever I could for some diffusion and to get that atmospheric look along with a hard light pounding through a window.\n\nMy gaffer Justin Dixon also introduced me to the Cineo Reflex R15 lights, which I really liked. When he had to move on to another show before I shot the finale, the new gaffer, Mike Cruz, introduced me to the Fiilex Q8s & Q10s, which I loved. They’re sort of what you’d get if a Leko and Source 4 Joker had a baby…and great for creating hard flashes of light or contrast.\n\nDid you work with a colorist in prep on the LUTs?\n\nNo, we went with the preset LUT from the pilot, and then the colorist, Gareth Cook at The Foundation, and I just refined it.\n\nTell us about shooting the season finale. I heard you used a device by Camtec called the Color-Con. How did that influence your approach for the season finale.\n\nOne of my favorite films was Se7en by David Fincher, and back in the day when people still shot film, flashing film was a look I really loved. Color-Con basically gives you the digital version of that look, as it adds light into the shadows, and I wanted that for some of the scenes. It lifts the blacks so that when you crush them in post, it gives you this milkier black, almost like overexposing it and pulling the film down.\n\nI discovered it last year when I was operating on the Ryan Murphy show Monster and fell in love with it. Then I found out that one of my idols — DP Matthew Libatique — had used it on various projects. If it had been up to me, I would have used it for the whole show. I also used the Camtec Falcon lenses, which were used on the last but one Star Wars for the finale flashback. I wanted a grittier lens in the large-format family that would give me more of a vintage look. The finale climax scene in an auto body shop was my favorite to shoot, as it was the payoff from the pilot. I used smoke and peppered color in with the Color-Con to amplify the softness and push light into the shadows.\n\nThere are some VFX. How involved were you?\n\nI worked pretty closely with post supervisor Bob Dussault and VFX supervisor Chris Hagerthy and his team at Big Lazy Panda. Sometimes they’d get footage where I’d used the Color-Con and think something had gone drastically wrong with the camera, or they’d have to deal with a plate for something we hadn’t necessarily discussed in prep.\n\nWe also shot a lot of bluescreen for all the car-driving scenes because we didn’t have the budget to go out on a process trailer. We also had some VFX for the occasional office scene, replacing backgrounds in sets, and of course all the usual clean-up.\n\nTell us about the DI. How involved were you?\n\nI’m very involved, and I went to pretty much all the sessions with Gareth and the showrunner, except for the finale, when I was out of town. It was mainly about dialing in one scene to the next and making sure that if some color temperature was off or if some VFX shot was a little bit off color-wise, it all looked seamless in the end. We wanted it to look rich without being too saturated, and we were very meticulous.\n\nFinally, what were the main challenges of shooting this series?\n\nTV shows are almost always tough in terms of budget and time, and we also had heavily loaded scripts, so there was a lot on paper but not necessarily enough time to shoot it all.\n\nHaving a second unit would have helped a lot. Actor availability was also a challenge sometimes, and we didn’t have the budget for some gear I would have liked. It was a case of champagne taste with a beer budget (laughs).\n\nIndustry insider Iain Blair has been interviewing the biggest directors in Hollywood and around the world for years. He is a regular contributor to Variety and has written for such outlets as Reuters, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe.\n\nTo watch (or listen) to our interview with the editors, click here, and read our story below.\n\nBy Randi Altman\n\nFX/Hulu’s The Bear has become a classic after only eight episodes. The story of Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), an elite chef whose late brother willed him his Chicago restaurant, is frenetic, gritty and real. And the show’s editors — Joanna Naugle and Adam Epstein, ACE — were tasked with creating that feeling in the cut.\n\nNaugle is senior editor/co-owner of New York’s Senior Post, whose partner Josh Senior is an executive producer on The Bear. She has cut shows including Ramy, Human Resources and John Krasinski’s Some Good News. Epstein’s long roster of work includes SNL, The Other Two and Documentary Now!\n\npostPerspective recently chatted with the two to discuss their process and the challenges of working on the show, created by Christopher Storer and co-run by Joanna Calo. Naugle had worked with Storer on the series Ramy, so her cutting his new show just made sense. “I loved working with Chris,” she says. “He’s a great director with a very specific vision, but he still leaves so much room for collaboration.”\n\nAfter the show was greenlit for eight episodes, the team knew they needed another editor to make it work. “The first person we wanted to ask was Adam,” explains Naugle. “We had worked with him on a couple of projects and knew he was suited for The Bear’s style, which was going to be a bit fast and crazy. We knew Adam could handle that after so many years at SNL.”\n\nLet’s dig in a bit deeper on how they cut The Bear’s Carmy, Richie, Sydney and the rest of the strong personalities who work at The Beef…\n\nWhat were you told about pace? It’s a really frenetic show. How was that described to you?\n\nJoanna Naugle: When we were cutting the pilot, Chris said it should feel like you are drowning — like you were thrown into the deep end of a pool, and it’s sink or swim.\n\nThe pilot was scripted with the opening having a lot of different scenes back to back, and as we were cutting, Chris said we needed to get to the chaos faster. So we just kept condensing and condensing and turning the first 10 minutes into this crazy montage of Carmy cooking, selling his jeans, trying to get the meat for the sandwiches —introducing all this information at once — and setting the scene for Chicago.\n\nI never got the note “make it crazier” before, but I just kept getting that note, which was so fun as an editor because a lot of times, if we’re doing our job right, you’re not paying attention to the editing because everything is happening seamlessly. This show was just the opposite. It was like, “make it loud, make it in your face, jump cuts, cross fades,” all sorts of things. So it was really cool to have that freedom to intentionally make things feel intense. Doing things that might feel jarring and wrong in another show actually had a place here, which was great.\n\nAdam, when you came on, the frenetic and chaotic pace was already established. How did it feel to edit that way?\n\nAdam Epstein: It was great, and I was lucky to have this as a jumping-off point from the pilot. When I started talking to Chris about it, he said — especially about the first episode — that he wanted people’s reaction to be either “I love this so much” or “Oh my God, I can’t do this. Get away from me.” So having that as a reference point was incredibly helpful.\n\nThroughout the series, there were moments that were incredibly intense — the entirety of Episode 7, pockets of Episode 5 and the opening of Episode 2 — but they were really smart as far as the evolution of the anxiety.\n\nThe pilot kind of stands alone… you’re clueless about everything, and you don’t know who any of these people are. And while the pace might maintain throughout the series, the pilot establishes the backstory, and you get used to the rhythm of it.\n\nHow did you tackle all of that?\n\nEpstein: I tried to use what Joanna established in the pilot, and then I spoke with the directors and EPs about how we evolve it so it’s not just repeating the same moves over and over. It was a constant discussion and push and pull on how crazy we wanted things to be. How contemplative and introspective should the like scenes be? Where do we break from the madness?\n\nHow were you sharing your cuts? I’m assuming everybody worked remotely?\n\nNaugle: Strangely enough, we didn’t have a lot of remote-attended edits. We were working independently in our own apartments or houses, and then we would share cuts, mostly in Frame.io. Chris would watch them, and then we’d have a phone call or talk to Josh Senior because he was talking to Chris.\n\nIt was cool because Chris had so much trust in us — he wasn’t sitting over our shoulders and getting into the nitty-gritty editing notes. He was giving us more emotional notes for the scenes — “This should be where Sydney gains her confidence” or “This should be the scene where Richie’s at a breaking point” or “How can we make this feel lonelier?” As an editor, I love those notes because it’s like a puzzle to solve as opposed to just checking things off a list.\n\nWe all had the media remotely on LucidLink, and we were all working with Adobe Productions.\n\n(To watch our full interview with the editors of The Bear, click here.)\n\nWhat about the flashbacks to how life was when Carmy’s brother was alive? How did the feel change, if at all?\n\nEpstein: I did Episode 6, which is where we have that main flashback scene with Mikey (Jon Bernthal). The direction I got was to make the audience understand what it would mean to lose someone with this much magnetism and charisma, so it was about playing him up as big and as loud as possible. It was also a little dreamy as far as cutting between the golden shots of the food being made and the lights flooding in from the windows, and everyone’s smiling and happy. We needed to get that golden moment in contrast with the chaos, so it was probably a bit of heightened reality. Was it really that beautiful and that happy in the moment? Maybe not, but in the memory, it plays that way.\n\nIt was also about leaning on the actors, who were really good, and letting their performances shine through. That was kind of the North Star on that chunk of the show. But also, stylistically, it felt a little more linear than the chaos of the rest of the show. I had initially built that scene to be a little slower, and then toward the fine cut and close to lock, Josh Senior said, “This is great. Let’s keep it chop, chop, chop and moving, moving, moving so that when we get to the break, you see Richie in an awkward and slower environment.” It makes the switch between the happy old times and the shit of the present that much more deliberate.\n\nWhat about the flashbacks when Carmy is being abused by his boss at the restaurant? That must have been an intense scent to cut.\n\nNaugle: That was the start of Episode 2, and it was one of the toughest scenes for me to edit because we wanted it to feel different than The Beef. Everything at The Beef is so fast, and this restaurant should also feel fast, but in a very different way. Everything is so choreographed, and there’s a coldness and fear, because there’s this tyrant looming over them.\n\nJoel McHale, who plays the abusive boss, had so many horrible but great improvs just destroying Carmy. So part of the editing struggle was choosing the meanest ones without going overboard. And the shots are so close to his face; it feels so invasive and aggressive, and you can feel him breathing down your neck. Jeremy Allen White has such sad eyes; he’s working at the top place in the world, but he’s clearly so broken and empty.\n\nThat scene was setting up something that’s totally the opposite of The Beef in that it was so clean and organized, but also very soulless. The Beef is filled with problems, and it’s dirty and messy, but there is heart there, something that’s binding them all together. So we really wanted to emphasize the difference between those two restaurants.\n\nIn Episode 7, when an uglier side of Carmy comes out, it’s hinting at who he could become if he wasn’t checking himself and finding that balance with his employees. Anytime he had a panic attack or a nightmare, we tried to sneak in some of the audio from that scene — a flashback to the trauma that’s playing in the back of his head and influences who he wants to be as a chef.\n\nThe people are the heart of The Beef, and there is the evolution of those relationships. How did you guys play that in the edit?\n\nEpstein: The scripts were so great and had lots of natural character arcs, which is really impressive in a first season. The amount of development and growth across multiple characters in just an eight-episode season was like three seasons’ worth of development and growth.\n\nSometimes we would talk about how we hadn’t seen a certain character in a while. So even if it wasn’t necessarily scripted, we were lucky enough to have lots of b-roll of, say, Marcus working on cakes or Sydney prepping onions and carrots. We could place them in to reset the mood or to remind people of the journey that person was on. Again, it was leaning on great acting and finding the balance between the naturalism and the stylistic embellishments.\n\nDo you feel the same, Joanna?\n\nNaugle: It really is an amazing ensemble, and the writers did a great job giving even the minor characters moments to shine or to be funny. It makes it feel like a real kitchen when there are so many different voices and people.\n\nLike Adam said, adding some b-roll of Sydney working on her short ribs, for example, just made it feel very lived in, like everyone was moving through the space very naturally.\n\nDid you have a lot of coverage?\n\nNaugle: The shoot itself was pretty fast, and most of the time it was four angles or whatever you would need to cover the scene. Chris and Joanna had a clear idea of what they wanted, but there was a ton of b-roll, which was really great. Our assistant editors — Josh Depew and Megan Mancini — did an awesome job of organizing that.\n\nWe had footage of the interior of The Beef clean, the interior dirty, outside The Beef. Everything was well-organized, so we could choose b-roll for the arc of them getting their act together. The dirtiest stuff went in the earlier episodes, and as they were starting to organize, we saw that the shelves were more in order and there were clean dishes. Those b-roll shots helped to reinforce everything coming together and starting to look more professional.\n\nJoanna had mentioned the Joel McHale scene as one of the most challenging. Adam, do any stick out for you?\n\nEpstein: In Episode 5, the one where Marcus blows the fuse, there is a conversation between Carmen and Richie that was written as a slow, deliberate scene. We used that as a base and then wove in Marcus flipping out because he’s behind on cakes. That leads to Sydney prepping a dish, which we pulled from another episode because Josh said we should get Syd in there and show how everyone’s in chaos and in their own world at the same time. Then we had to figure out a way for all three of those situations to come to a head at the same time. Hence the power outage. That took a while from a technical perspective and figuring out the right rhythms.\n\nAnother one that was challenging to cut was actually a pretty slow scene. Carmy and his sister (Abby Elliott) were in Carmy’s office looking for some papers. It was just them talking about the history of the restaurant and how she feels like he never asks about how she’s doing. Carmy has a great quote — something like, “I never know how I feel, so the thought of asking someone how they feel sounds insane.”\n\nIt’s a slow dialogue scene, but there are a lot of time jumps and hidden jump cuts within it. For example, someone would be reaching over, so that meant covering the person’s mouth so I could use a line from 40 seconds later to then be able to jump to the next part — cheat stuff like that. The challenge for me was finding the right balance of that deliberate pacing, but I really like how that scene came out.\n\nNaugle: Yeah, that scene turned out so well. It’s such a nice intimate moment of them connecting for the first time in the season. I feel like there are so many good shots of them just looking at each other too. They are finally seeing each other for real.\n\nEpstein: That was a great example of the coverage too. The DPs — Andrew Wehde (Episodes 2-8) and Adam Newport-Berra (pilot) — and camera operators on this show did such a great job. There would be two cameras running, a master setup and then a wandering B camera, but it was never haphazard.\n\nIn that scene, there was a great move where the camera is coming down off Carmy’s face, and you see that he can’t stop bouncing with his hands or playing with his spoon. He is always shaking a bit, and you can tell he is nervous. It was just great texture that plays into the themes and vibe of the scene while also, from a technical perspective, being great glue to let you cover large cuts or make time jumps or stitch things together without it being obvious.\n\nLet’s talk gear. It was shot on ARRI Alexa Mini, and you edited on Adobe Premiere, which is interesting because often TV shows are edited in Avid Media Composer.\n\nNaugle: I’ve worked almost exclusively in Premiere the past few years. Not even intentionally, it just seems that’s what my projects have been. This was my first time using Adobe Productions, which was really cool because it made things so much easier for us working remotely.\n\nWe’ve commiserated about what a rough time it was transitioning to at-home work at the beginning of 2020 and how nobody had quite figured it out. Everyone had their local hard drives, and if you downloaded something, you had to make sure everybody else was mirroring their hard drive, and you lost so much time drive-syncing. Now, two-plus years into the pandemic, having the media on LucidLink made it such a seamless process.\n\nEveryone was working within the same production, so I could see that Adam was in a certain episode folder, for example. Our assistant editors could organize things in a way that was easy to find. It would’ve been so much more difficult if we hadn’t all been accessing that same master project. We were all able to operate within the same footage, sharing b-roll, music, sound effects, all that stuff.\n\nEpstein: I’m probably 60/40 Media Composer/Premiere these days. Before The Bear, I had Avid projects back to back for like a year and a half. Then The Bear was Premiere, and the feature I’m doing now is Premiere, but then the next show I’m doing is Avid. So I’m pretty agnostic. They each have their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFor a show like this — where the offline edits were so much more audio-centric and sound-design-heavy than for strictly dialogue-based shows — Productions worked great because it took what people think of as the main multi-user advantage of Avid Media Composer and put it into a Premiere environment.\n\nDealing with multiple sound layers and selecting things while you’re playing and getting feedback in real time is way more dynamic in Premiere than it is in Media Composer. You can do much quicker and more drastic audio work. Not that you can’t do it in Media Composer, it’s just leaner and cleaner to do it in Premiere. But as far as the actual cutting itself, they are pretty similar. You know, cuts are cuts.\n\nIs there anything I haven’t asked that you feel is important about your experience on the show?\n\nNaugle: As an editor, it was such a blast to get to do something that called so much attention to the editing. And we got to use techniques that might not have translated so easily into other projects. A lot of what they filmed was long takes of everybody yelling at each other in the kitchen, so that energy was already coming through in the footage, but it was just such a fun challenge to keep track of where everyone was in the kitchen. It should feel overwhelming when they’re all yelling over each other. We basically had that starting point of complete chaos and grew it from there.\n\nEpstein: So often you work on something, and even though the end product is good and people like it, the process was draining. But that was not at all the case on this show, which I think is kind of funny considering the intensity of the subject matter. It is a very intense and emotional sort of show, but this was one of the most pleasurable, seamless shows I’ve worked on — truly smooth sailing pretty much throughout the whole thing. Everyone said this was the most chill set, and everyone was happy and supportive. I feel that carried through to post. If everyone is enjoying what they’re doing, then theoretically the end product will reflect that.\n\n(To watch our full interview with the editors of The Bear, click here.)\n\nRandi Altman is the founder and editor-in-chief of postPerspective. She has been covering production and post production for more than 25 years.\n\nVeteran picture editor Sandra Montiel, ACE, recently received a 2022 ACE nomination in the Non-Theatrical Feature category for the movie Kate, starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Woody Harrelson. Montiel also cut the currently streaming Hulu feature The Valet, which follows Olivia (Samara Weaving), a famous actress, who faces a PR disaster when a paparazzi takes a photo of her with her married lover, Vincent (Max Greenfield). A valet, Antonio (Eugenio Derbez), accidentally appears in the same photo and is enlisted to pose as Olivia’s new boyfriend as a cover-up.\n\nShe has also edited a lot of episodic work, but more on that later.\n\nCan you talk about what being a picture editor entails?\n\nI assemble the footage creatively and seamlessly. Then I manipulate the plot, score, sound and graphics to refine the overall story into a continuous and enjoyable experience.\n\nWhat would surprise people the most about what falls under that title?\n\nMost people think I only get one take and put it together easily. They don’t know I choose the performances of the actors. Probably the biggest surprise to people is how much an editor is also in charge of the music. I was lucky with The Valet because I had a great music editor, but in most cases, I am also the music editor.\n\nLet’s talk about The Valet. Can you describe the pacing?\n\nThe Valet’s pacing is like if you went to a dance party where there are some fast songs and some slow songs, and you go from one to the other. The movie is quick where it needs to be, and it slows down in the scenes when a connection happens between the characters. It creates a flow that lets you enjoy a ride that’s just not all slow or fast. It’s a good ride.\n\nAny challenges in editing the movie?\n\nThere were a few challenges in cutting The Valet but nothing major. If I had to pick one, I would choose the scene where Vincent (Olivia’s rich boyfriend) is looking at a model of a new building he is going to build in the Pico-Union neighborhood of LA. That scene had its own pace. Vincent tries to keep his composure after seeing a video of his girlfriend sleeping with another man (even though she didn’t). The scene worked well by itself, but it wasn’t a good progression to the next one. Therefore, we decided to cut the scene a lot to allow room for him to get more exasperated in the following scene — when Max hits the valet, Antonio.\n\nWhat is the scene you are most proud and why?\n\nWell, first, I am very proud of all the scenes in this movie. But the one I am most proud of, which was also challenging, is the one when Olivia wakes up in Antonio’s bed the following day after getting drunk at a party. When they come out of the bedroom, his entire family, plus a few neighbors, are waiting for them. The director shot the scene over four different days and with many people in it, which makes a scene more difficult to cut.\n\nI had four different bins, so I had to go back and forth, and my monitor couldn’t handle all of them at once by a certain point. I decided to go in on a Saturday to work on it with a clear head and no interruptions. What was satisfying about the scene was that it came across in the way it was supposed to. Even when we did test screenings and asked the audience to tell us their favorite scene, it was that one that almost everyone unanimously chose.\n\nOK, let’s talk about your favorite part of the job.\n\nI have many favorite parts, but if I had to choose one, it would be when I first open a bin. I get to look at the material for the very first time to see what I have to put a scene together. It is very exciting for me. It is the first challenge of a project. I love it.\n\nWhat’s your least favorite?\n\nThere isn’t much I don’t like but probably when there is a lot of back and forth with contradicting notes.\n\nWhat is your most productive time of day and why?\n\nI love the mornings. I am a morning person, and I usually go for a run before work. It sets the tone for my day, so I feel great when I start.\n\nIf you didn’t have this job, what would you be doing instead?\n\nI would eternally be on vacation traveling the world, but I don’t have the money to do that! But honestly, I can’t imagine myself doing a different job. I love what I do, and I am very fulfilled when I am working.\n\nHow early did you know this would be your path?\n\nSince I was 13 years old! I grew up in Peru, and my uncle, a filmmaker, visited when I was 13. He read me a script, and I became fascinated by how a story could be told so compellingly in 90 pages. I knew then that I wanted to be a filmmaker and vowed to pursue it when I went to college.\n\nCan you name some recent jobs?\n\nI did a lot of TV before switching to features films. I edited Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Happy Endings, Atypical and The Good Doctor. My recent features are Uncorked, Kate and The Valet.\n\nDo you put on a different hat when cutting for a specific genre?\n\nI really don’t. The hat is the same no matter what the genre is. I look for the best pieces to tell the story I am trying to convey, so whether I need to make you cry, laugh or be scared, it’s all the same. I just look for the different pieces I need to do it.\n\nAssuming you were still working during the height of COVID. Can you describe that experience?\n\nI did edit during COVID, and it was very lonely. I love people, and I like the feedback I get from my team. That was missing from my process over the last couple of years. When I cut The Valet, we were in a different period of the pandemic; we had the vaccines. We worked in a hybrid way, either from home or in a private suite at Hula Post, and it was almost as if COVID didn’t exist. But in terms of getting the job done, with the help of technology, it all went very smoothly.\n\nDo you expect these workflows to stay with us going forward?\n\nI expect to have the ability to show things to producers or other parties via Zoom, Millicast and Evercast. I also think that people will want the option to work remotely or in an office environment, particularly as we see variations of COVID popping up, which doesn’t seem to be going away.\n\nWhat system do you edit on?\n\nI always use the latest version of Avid Media Composer, usually provided by whichever rental facility a particular project uses. For my last two features, I used Media Composers that were rented from Hula Post.\n\nDo you have a favorite plugin?\n\nIt’s not an actual plugin, but a subscription/license that comes with Media Composer called ScriptSync. I like it because in comedies there can be a lot of improv, so having the lines scripted lets me work with the director in a much faster way. Also, because there are so many options with jokes, I am constantly going back and forth to figure out what works best, so ScriptSync helps me move around easier.\n\nAre you often asked to do more than edit (or music editor)? If so, what are you asked to do?\n\nSomething I find myself doing, whether asked or not, is being a mediator. Usually, it’s between the studio, the producers and the writer. Sometimes if they all have different opinions (and personalities), we have to go back and forth a few times before settling on a note. Of course, I have to ensure everyone feels heard during that process, especially if I know the note is controversial. But on the other hand, I know what my director wants, so I have to manage all the input others give me.\n\nWhat are three pieces of technology you can’t live without?\n\nMy Avid, ScriptSync and texting.\n\nThis is a high-stress job. What do you do to de-stress from it all?\n\nSleep. Seriously, I make sure I get enough hours when things are going to be very hectic. And as I mentioned earlier running. That also helps me de-stress.\n\nBy Iain Blair\n\nElisabeth Moss, who stars as June Osborne in the multi-Emmy Award-winning Hulu series The Handmaid’s Tale, has made her directing debut in the show’s fourth season. The series tackles very dark themes, including woman as slaves, civil war, economic chaos and power-crazed leaders.\n\nWith a large ensemble cast headed by Moss and Joseph Fiennes, the show is based on the dystopian and prescient 1985 novel by Margaret Atwood; the author has noted that everything she wrote about 36 years ago has now happened somewhere in the world today.\n\nI spoke with Moss, who also stars in the upcoming Wes Anderson film The French Dispatch and Taika Waititi’s Next Goal Wins, about directing the show, post production and visual effects.\n\nDid you always want to direct?\n\nNo, not at all. I thought maybe one day I would, if I found a story I knew really well — and it gradually hit me that this was exactly that. Because I’ve been so connected to the show and material for three years, I’ve had three years of prep as a director. Then I did my first episode and realized I’ve been thinking like a director for years. I’ve always thought about camera placement, editing, post, sound — all of it. Originally, I was only meant to do the one episode — Episode 3 — but I enjoyed the experience so much that I thought I should really push myself, especially since everyone really loved it. So when the opportunity came up to also direct Episodes 8 and 9, I just went for it since they’re so different from the first one I directed.\n\nHow did you prepare? Did you ask for advice from other directors you’ve worked with? Did The Handmaid’s Tale showrunner Bruce Miller help?\n\nI’ve been studying how they do their job for years, and I’ve worked with so many different kinds of directors. On this show alone you get to work with so many, and I get to see what works and what doesn’t. I did ask Wes Anderson, Ben Stiller, Taika and anyone I could think of for advice, and they all gave pretty similar answers —be super-prepared but also be open to every idea and be prepared for the unexpected.\n\nLike the COVID crisis in the middle of Season 4?\n\nExactly. We’d started shooting and then had to shut down, and then all the post had to be done remote. I did it from my living room, and it was fine. All the technology, like ClearView, makes it pretty efficient. The bummer is, you’re not in the room with the editor or VFX team, so it’s just different.\n\nActors spend a lot of time with directors on set, so the move to directing is a trip into fairly familiar territory, but post is a very different process. Was it a steep learning curve?\n\nYou’re so right about actors and post, but because I’ve been doing a lot of producing I had a bit more experience with the whole post process. I’ve been involved with post on this show for three years, and I’ve also produced a couple of films, so I’m very familiar it — and I absolutely love it. I love shooting too, but post is probably my favorite part, especially the editing process and working on the sound and then all the VFX.\n\nWe do all the post at Take 5 Productions in Toronto, which is also where we shoot, and we have a great team of post people. I worked very closely with post supervisor Corrie Gudgeon and post EP Sheila Hockin. It’s like a well-oiled machine.\n\nWe do Foley at Footsteps, audio post at Sim Toronto and the DI at Company 3 Toronto. I love the DI process and playing with the look, but I don’t really mess with that too much. The DP works closely with the colorist, Bill Ferwerda, and I have notes, but I rely on their expertise and sign off on that.\n\n[Editor’s Note: We reached out to Ferwerda to find out more. “She has an excellent eye and picks up on some tiny details,” Ferwerda says of Moss. Ferwerda worked closely with Stuart Biddlecombe, who shot a portion of Season 3 and all but one episode of Season 4. “She definitely had a sense of what she wanted visually and communicated her ideas with the cinematographer. After he and I would complete our color passes, she would occasionally ask us to take another look at a shot or scene if something was just not sitting right with her.”]\n\nCan you talk about the editing process?\n\nIt’s a very tight schedule on our show, so I’m shooting and editing at the same time. I worked with two amazing editors — Wendy Hallam Martin, who cut Episode 3 and Episode 8, and Chris Donaldson, who cut Episode 9. When Wendy handed me her assemblies, I was like, “Wow! You could just air them as is.” I had some notes, but they’re both so good and experienced and know the story inside out.\n\nChris is a very different kind of editor, much more exploratory, and the way he cut the final scene in Episode 9 was like he’d gone into my brain. It was exactly how I’d pictured it and wanted it to look, with all the jump cuts and the distorted sound — although in the end, we pulled it back a bit.\n\nOn Episode 3, I had storyboarded a lot of it because of all the VFX, and I’d cut a lot of it in my head before we even got to post and the edit, and Wendy was so good at being able to see what I wanted to do from the coverage I gave her. That whole process truly opened me up to all the possibilities, and to see how you can develop a scene purely in the edit.\n\nThere are quite a few VFX, and some are really big. How steep was the learning curve for you?\n\nThat was a steep learning curve, even though we don’t usually use a ton of VFX on the show. Mavericks VFX does them all, and I worked very closely with our VFX supervisor Stephen Lebed. Also, we had a VFX on-set supervisor, Brendan Taylor, for all that to make sure it ran smoothly.\n\nWe augment a lot of shots and do a fair amount of cleanup and fixes, but we don’t usually do huge VFX set pieces. But this year we did some really big VFX stuff, especially in Episode 3, and that was a first for me. I storyboarded this whole rooftop sequence, and we used a lot of previz with Brendan. I love that part because you can look at all the camera angles and really plan the sequence out. And Lebed, as we call him, was phenomenal and so helpful, considering I’d never shot or directed anything with really heavy VFX before.\n\nDid you like working with VFX?\n\nI loved it! It’s super-intense but so much fun, and you can create anything you want. I love that it’s so available now and not just for huge superhero movies or Star Wars-type films. You can use them to create Fenway Park in Boston, as we did earlier on this show, or Chicago or some war-torn scene. I loved learning about all the tools and software and bluescreen and creating set extensions and combining plates with CGI. I had an almost 360-degree bluescreen for the rooftop sequence. It was awesome to walk on the set and see how massive it was.\n\nFair to say that Atwood’s book and its themes seem timelier than ever?\n\nI’d say so. She kept connecting the global and political to the personal, and we have this whole backdrop, but we’re looking at it through the eyes of a mother, a wife, a husband, a friend. It’s always through a personal lens, and that lets us stay relevant and timely.\n\nDo you want to direct more now?\n\nAbsolutely, I’d love to direct more — and not just on this show, but maybe a movie or another TV project.\n\nHow’s it going with your production company, which has the awesome name of Love & Squalor Pictures?\n\nIt’s going great. We’re in development on a number of projects, including Shining Girls, a metaphysical thriller series at Apple TV+, which is just about to start shooting in Chicago. We’ll probably do all the post for that in LA.\n\nIndustry insider Iain Blair has been interviewing the biggest directors in Hollywood and around the world for years. He is a regular contributor to Variety and has written for such outlets as Reuters, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe.\n\nMusic and sound are important to every film, but when a film is about the importance of music and sound, it’s paramount. Bennett Lasseter’s film, The Ultimate Playlist of Noise, tells the story of a high school senior named Marcus who is obsessed with making playlists for friends and recording sounds. After finding out he has a tumor that when removed will render him deaf, he sets off on a roadtrip across the country to collect as many sounds as he can. Along the way, he meets a girl, gets pulled out of his comfort zone and realizes that the world won’t end when his hearing does.\n\nTackling this Hulu film’s score was composer Erick Schroder. We spoke to him about how he got into composing, his work on this film and his process on other projects.\n\nThe Ultimate Playlist of Noise isn’t your first project with director Bennett Lasseter. What is it about his projects that mesh with your musical sensibilities?\n\nBennett has a huge appreciation for music and how music affects, alters and changes scenes and helps them pop and come to life. Being such a collaborative person, it’s fun to work with him. On this project he was very open to musically experimenting with new things and really gave me the freedom to explore.\n\nCan you describe the score of the film and how you started the process?\n\nInitially everything was composed at the piano, but as my involvement progressed with the film we went with a less-is-more approach. That’s how synths came into play, to provide some ambience and padding, especially when there were elements of sound design. From there, as the characters’ friendship progresses, the music ebbs and flows to mirror and dance with them as they go through that.\n\nCan you share a note or two that you got from Bennett and how you addressed those notes?\n\nAs I just mentioned, we talked about a less-is-more approach and not being heavy-handed in the delivery we wanted. The acting was so strong, so we wanted the actors to have space to do their thing without forcing the music to be overhanded.\n\nThe bowling scene took about 15 revisions. Even though the scene had been cut a couple different ways, that was the hardest because sometimes my score felt a little rom-com-ish, which did not fit the tone of the film. So we revised that one quite a bit.\n\nThe Ultimate Playlist of Noise centers on music. Did you feel that your score was highlighted even more because of this?\n\nI didn’t. I felt that the intention of the score was to support the scenes and the characters. The most important thing was some of the sound design elements because as Marcus goes on this journey, it’s his last hurrah to hear these sounds. This is why he is making this playlist and capturing it for other people to experience once his hearing is gone. The sound design was the most important thing because of the story, but within that there was often some score under those elements. So I felt my job was to help usher the audience through this journey as Marcus is creating this playlist of noise.\n\nWho did the sound design?\n\nRussell Topal did the sound design, and the sound mix was done at Formosa Group.\n\nDid the pandemic have any effect on how you scored The Ultimate Playlist of Noise?\n\nTimewise, I had a lot more of it. Because of the pandemic, shooting got delayed, so having the extra time was definitely fruitful. My wife had COVID right before I started the film, so that was very stressful. Bennett and the production company were very supportive and gave me all the time off I needed as she went through that.\n\nGoing on that journey with her helps me appreciate the little things more and also somewhat parallels Marcus’ journey in the film. Marcus has a greater sense of gratitude and appreciation when it comes to sound and the things we take for granted. I was able to relate to the story on another level because of my experience.\n\nWhat tools did you use with at home while working on this film?\n\nI write in Logic, record in Logic and mix in Pro Tools. For this film, I used a variety of soft and hard synths. There is a new sound library that I used a lot called Guitar Reveries from a company called Valiant Samples.\n\nI also used U-he’s Diva and Bazille for some of the other soft synths. A lot of it, when it came to making pads, I made my own. So using the guitar, brushing the strings, running it through a variety of amps and pedals just to give it that organic quality. That was a big bulk of where those synth elements came from … taking guitar tones and twisting them into their own kind of playable instruments to use as synthetic textures.\n\nYou have scored everything from horror films to dramas. Does your creative process differ based on the type of film you’re scoring?\n\nThat’s a tricky question because every film is so different. If it’s something in the thriller/horror genres, there are no rules. You can go crazy when it comes to sound design elements and experimenting with funky instruments and banging/clanging on all sorts of objects. Whereas in a drama, you probably would not want to do that. If it’s a traditional drama, with strings and piano, there is a bit more structure rather than organized chaos.\n\nWhat instruments do you play, and which one do you typically use to start off the writing process?\n\nI play the piano and always start there. From there, I will move over to my computer and keyboard. I always feel like sitting down at a real piano. There is something that comes from that and something really resonates. You get a response from a piano that you don’t get from samples.\n\nWhat should the composer’s main goal be on a film?\n\nThe main goal is just to support the characters and support the scene. It’s often easy to force music in there because you fall in love with what you write, but it’s only when you step back to see what the scene needs that you can really fine-tune it. You never want to overscore something. Overscoring is probably the worst thing you can do.\n\nHow do you know when you have overscored something?\n\nUltimately, it comes down to taking time away from the project and revisiting it a week later. There have been times when I think the score is great, but when I revisit it later, I realize I totally missed the boat because I overdid it or maybe underdid it. The ability to watch the film more and more helps. The further you work into the film and the more experience you get with it — with the characters, backstories, settings — the more it can really help to influence some of the earlier stuff that was created. Overall, time spent with the film and developing a relationship with it helps you know when it’s right. It just takes time.\n\nWhat else is happening in your world workwise?\n\nI just wrapped up the Laurence Fishburne film Under the Stadium Lights, which is coming out soon. And I’m about to start a film called Adeline, which is based on the true story of a therapy horse. I have a few other projects that are also wrapped. We are just waiting to hear their release dates.\n\nLet’s take a step back to the beginning. What role did music play in your life when you were growing up?\n\nMusic was something I gravitated toward, especially in the musical theater world. I grew up attending theater performances and from there started accompanying theater productions. I also took piano lessons and general music theory classes, so music was always around me.\n\nWas there a specific film score or composer that made you want to get in the business?\n\nYes, Thomas Newman’s Meet Joe Black score. Being a pianist and hearing the interplay between the piano, strings and oboe is something that immediately hooked my ear. It was such an emotional score. Being a pianist, I gravitated toward it and wanted to dissect it and play those songs and figure out why it sounded the way it did. That got me started on the journey of really exploring other film composers and wanting to pursue it as my future.\n\nBy Patrick Birk\n\nI think it’s fair to say that America is divided… and changing. But with the perfect storm that has been 2020 thus far, polarization has hit a fever pitch many have not seen in their lifetime. It may be apt, then, that FX and Hulu would release Mrs. America, a limited series depicting the fierce struggle that erupted in the US surrounding the movement to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nSet in the 1970s, the show explores one of the most contentious elements of the culture war and tells the stories of Phyllis Schlafly (Cate Blanchett) — a conservative activist who led the charge against the women’s liberation movement — and feminists such as Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne), Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba), Jill Ruckelshaus (Elizabeth Banks) and Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman).\n\nScott Gershin was the supervising sound editor and designer for the series. His long list of credits includes Nightcrawler, American Beauty, Pacific Rim, Team America, Hellboy II, JFK, The Doors, Shrek and The Book of Life. The methods Gershin and his team put together to complete the show during quarantine give me hope for those of us in the arts during these clearly changing times.\n\nGershin and his editorial team, part of Sound Lab (at Keywords Studio), partnered up with walla group The Loop Squad to record Episodes 1 through 8 at the Todd-AO ADR stage in Los Angeles. The show was mixed at Burbank’s Westwind Sound with a team that included mixers Christian Minkler (dialogue and music) and Andrew King (sound effects).\n\nMrs. America takes place throughout the ‘70s. Do you enjoy working on period pieces?\n\nI love it. You have to research and learn about the events of that period. You need to be able to smell it and hear it. I believe that we captured that time, its tone and its vernacular. A lot of it is very subtle, but if we did it wrong, you would notice it.\n\nThe subtlety in the sound design served the show well. You never get the impression that it was there for its own sake.\n\nI have worked on a range of projects. On the quiet side is American Beauty. On the loud side is Pacific Rim. In both cases, nobody should know I exist. If the illusion is correct, you enjoy the story, you buy the illusion. Interestingly enough, there was so much design in American Beauty that nobody knows about. An example is the use of silence; it was done strategically to create an aural contrast to support the pace and the actors’ performances. We recreated subtle sounds, such as when they were eating at the table. It was all manufactured to match the dialogue’s ambience in that scene. As the audience watches a show, they should think that everything they’re hearing was recorded at that time, whether it’s fanciful and sci-fi, or it’s realistic.\n\nWhat’s an example of what you thought this show needed?\n\nI come from movies, so a major goal was to make sure this show could have the same level of detail that I would put into a film, despite budgetary limitations. The first thing I did was to go into my library, which is pretty big. I realized I had no women-only crowd recordings, so I called some fellow sound pros. They had men and women, and the occasional solo woman laughing or crying, but not crowds of women. That’s when I realized I had to create it myself. While I do this often on my films, I had to find a way to accomplish this within the budget I had and across nine episodes.\n\nThat was the fun — trying to capture that variety of accents, the vernaculars, in which different cultures and areas within the United States communicated during that time. Then there was capturing the acoustical spaces needed for the show, thinking about the right microphones to use, where they should be placed and how I could combine them with certain sound effects to help the illusion of very large venues, such as rallies or political conventions.\n\nLike during the Reagan-era toward the end?\n\nYes. In a couple of episodes, there were chants and singalongs. I combined walla group recording (which was somewhere between six to 15 female actresses, depending on the episode) with concert crowds, which I had to manipulate to sound like women. I’d envelope ( a form of precision blending) those crowds against the recorded walla group to give the illusion that a convention hall of women was chanting and singing, even though they weren’t.\n\nWe created a tickle of a certain sound to give it that reverb-y, mass-y kind of thing. It’s a lot of experimenting and a lot of “No, that didn’t work. Ooh, that worked. That’s kind of cool.” Then occasionally we’d be lucky that music was in the right place to mask it a little bit. So it’s a bit of a sonic puzzle, an audio version of smoke and mirrors.\n\nIt’s like being a painter. I love minimalism for the right shows and rocking the room for others. This show wasn’t about either. In discussions with Dahvi Waller (writer and showrunner), Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (directors and executive producers), Stacey Sher (executive producer) Ebony Jones (post producer) and the picture editors for each episode (Todd Downing, Emily E. Greene and Robert Komatsu), we agreed on dense textures and details. We didn’t want to go the route of dialogue, music and six sound effects; we wanted to create a rich tapestry of details within the environments, using Foley to enhance (while not interfering with) the actors’ performances while hearing the voice and the sound of the times. (Check out our interview with Mrs. America‘s editors here.)\n\nWhen you did need more specific varieties and dialects to come through in crowds and walla, how did you go about it?\n\nI get very detail-oriented. For instance, when we talk about capturing the language of the time, a lot of this was embellished with The Loop Squad, our walla group. I wanted to make sure we were accurate. We didn’t want typical accents that are sometimes associated with conservatives or liberals; we wanted to capture the different tone and dialects of the region each group was from. The principal actresses did an amazing job portraying the different characters, so I wanted to follow suit and continue that approach.\n\nFor example, the scenes with Shirley Chisholm and the members of the Black feminist movement at the party. All the times you saw people’s mouths moving, there was no sound (the whole show was shot this way). It was all reproduced, so I wanted to make sure that we had the right vernacular, the right sonic style, the right representation – capturing the voice and sound of the times, the region, the culture.\n\nSo an emphasis on respectability politics?\n\nAbsolutely. At the party, there was a combination of different issues within the black community. In addition to women’s rights, it was about black rights and lesbian rights, and there were conflicts within that group of women.\n\nPatty Connolly and Mark Sussman of The Loop Squad and I had to do a lot of research. It was important to find the right (loop) actresses who could portray that era, that time and culture, and come up with what the issues were that were being discussed within the different timelines that were covered in the show.\n\nWe had the opportunity to record a political rally held in LA. For the scene where Phyllis shows up in DC, and there’s a large group of women activists in front of the government building, the Bernie Sanders rally provided the exterior spatial perspective I needed. Adding in the walla group made it feel like it was all women discussing the issues of that time period.\n\nWhat recording methods did you use?\n\nBecause I didn’t have a massive budget to record enormous amounts of people, I had to create hundreds of people with a small group of actors and actresses. For Mrs. America, I grabbed the big ADR room at the old Todd-AO building. Working with our ADR mixer, Jeffrey Roy, I brought in a bunch of my own mics and placed them in different places within the room. Traditionally, ADR stages use shotgun microphones to get rid of any ambience or size of the room. I didn’t do that at all. I wanted to use the acoustics of the room as an important component of the performance.\n\nIn using the room, I had to position the actors in strategic places within the room to accomplish a given scene. To get another perspective, I had them stand facing the wall one or two feet away, or in the middle of the room facing each other, or back to back in a line.\n\nIn Episode 3, when all the men were running to take back their seats in the convention center, I had them (the loop actors) running really fast in two opposing circles to try to create the feeling of motion and energy. By combining these perspectives and placing them in different speakers during the mix, it gave the scene a certain “spatial-ness” and energy. I loved using the acoustics of the room as a color and a major part of the illusion.\n\nWhat mics were you using, and did you use any shotgun mics despite not relying on them?\n\nThe stage had a Sennheiser MKH 416 shotgun for specific lines, but I prefer using a Sennheiser MKH 800 more often than not. I like the midrange clarity better. For spatial effect, I used a pair of MKH 8040s in ORTF pattern in front (with the MKH 800 in the middle), while in the back I used the Sanken CSS-5 or the DPA 5100, which I moved around a bunch. This gave me the option to have a 5.0 perspective or to use the rear mics for an offstage or defocused perspective.\n\nEach mic and their placement served as a kind of paint brush. When I sent my tracks to effects mixer Andy King at Westwind, I didn’t want to just bathe it in reverb because that would smear the spatial image. I wanted to preserve a 5-channel spatial spread or ambience of the room, so the left was different from the right and the front was different than the back, giving a kind of a movement within the room.\n\nDid quarantine affect the post process?\n\nHalfway through the mix, the virus hit. So little by little, we didn’t feel comfortable being in the same room together for safety reasons. We looked at different streaming technologies, which we had to figure out quickly, and decided to go with Streambox for broadcasting our mix in real time.\n\nWe ended up broadcasting privately to the showrunner, the producers and the picture editors. Our music editor Andrew Silver and I were online most of the time. At the end, the only people on the stage at Westwind were our two mixers, with our mix tech Jesse Ehredt in a room next to the dubbing stage and our first assistant Chris Richardson in his edit room down the hall. Everybody else was remote.\n\nDoug Kent introduced us to Flemming Laursen and Dave Weathers of Center Point Post who supplied us with Streambox. We came up with something that worked within the bandwidth of everyone’s download speeds at their houses, since the whole country was working and going to school online. This challenged everyone’s capabilities. When picture and audio started to degrade, Flemming and I decided to increase the buffer size and decrease the picture quality a little bit, which seemed to solve a lot of our issues during peak usage times.\n\nWe used Zoom to communicate, allowing us to give each other notes in real time to the stage. I’ve got a similar setup at my home studio to what I have in Burbank, so I was able to listen in a quality environment. At the end of the day, we sent out QuickTimes in both 5.1 and stereo for everyone to listen to, which supported their schedules. Also, if a streaming glitch happened while we were Zooming or streaming, we could verify that it wasn’t in the mix.\n\nIt added more time to the process, but we still got it done while maintaining the quality we strived for. Being online made the process efficient. Using Zoom, I would contact dialogue editor Mike Hertlein, who was working from home, for an alternate line or a fix during the mix (with clients on Streambox). Fifteen minutes later we had it in the session and were mixing it.\n\nDid you record walla groups remotely?\n\nYes, for some of Episode 8 and all of Episode 9. I’d normally record 10 to 15 actors at a time, recording five to eight takes of those 10 to 15 actors, each with a different acoustical perspective. Since Todd-AO was closed due to the pandemic, I had to come up with a different solution. I decided to have all the actors record in their closets or booths if they had them. They recorded into their own recording systems, with each actor having his or her own unique setup. The first thing I had to do was teach a number of actors how to record (basic audio and delivery).\n\nI used Zoom to communicate and direct them through the different scenes. I could hear well enough through group chat on Zoom, and I was able to direct them and provide them with picture by sharing my second screen, like we do on an ADR stage. They would all record at once. From that point, I could direct an actor, saying, “You’re doing too much of this” or “You’re too loud.” I needed to maintain what we had done in previous episodes and keep that blended feel.\n\nCan you talk about benefits and negatives to working this way?\n\nA benefit was that every actor was on a separate track. When I record everybody in a group at Todd-AO, if one person’s off, the whole recording had to be scrapped. Separation let me choose whether I would use someone’s take or not. They didn’t pollute each other’s performances.\n\nWhen it came to editing, instead of being five or six tracks (each containing eight to 15 actors), now it was 100 tracks. I had five to eight takes of each actor, so when combined, it made for a lot of tracks. Editing those took quite a bit more time. I had to EQ and clean up each actor’s setups, using different types of reverbs to fit the room (which Andy King and Christian Minkler did as well). We had created such cool sounds from previous episodes; the goal was to see if we could match them. It was a bit of a white-knuckle ride. We honestly weren’t sure we could pull it off. But when we were finished, Dahvi let me know she really couldn’t hear a difference between Episode 9 and the previous episodes.\n\nHow did you approach the scene in Episode 8, where Alice mixes cocktails with a “Christian pill” and ends up sharing a meal with a group of lesbian feminists? Did you consciously lean toward the surreal given how much time it took to make the home recordings blend naturally?\n\nWe had lots of discussions. At first, we wanted to try doing something a little out there. Basically, “How does Alice hear this?” We wanted to be consistent, but we wanted to be able to tell the story. Sarah Paulson did such a great job of portraying being drugged that we thought maybe we should take a step back and let her run with it a little bit, rather than trying to make something that we don’t see. Picture editor Todd Downing did a fantastic job of editing, which enhanced Sarah’s performance — giving it a psychedelic feel without going way over the top\n\nWe wanted to stay organic. We manipulated the mother’s voice on the phone a little when Alice’s pill started to take effect. For that scene, we recorded Alice’s mother’s lines on a phone during quarantine, and it worked out because the futz coming from recording on a phone translated quite well. To keep it organic, I did some subtle things: slowed down the crowds without affecting pitch and inserted backward and forward voices and blended them together so they would sound a little odd.\n\nDuring the scene with the nun, at a certain point we replaced the nun’s voice with Cate’s voice, so she heard Cate’s voice talking through the nun’s performance. We did a number of other things and supported the hard cuts and time travel feel.\n\nOverall it seemed like half my job was coming up with ways to keep working, creating new workflows, dealing with constant change. You’d have an hour’s notice to come up with plan B, plan C, plan D, and “How do we do this?” We’d all talk about it and say, “Let’s try this.” If that worked, cool. On to the next challenge!\n\nPatrick Birk is a musician, sound engineer and post pro at Silver Sound, a boutique sound house based in New York City.\n\nBy Patrick Birk\n\nNormal People, a new Hulu series based on Sally Rooney’s 2018 novel of the same name, details the intense yet strained romance between Marianne Sheridan (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell Waldron (Paul Mescal). The athletic and popular Connell and the witty and socially outcast Marianne attend the same high school in County Sligo, Ireland. When the wealthy Marianne reveals her feelings for Connell — whose mother works as housekeeper for Marianne’s family — he begins a relationship with her on the condition of it being a secret. After a turbulent final year in their hometown, the two reconnect at Trinity College Dublin, where the tables have turned socially.\n\nThe series was written by Rooney, Alice Birch and Mark O’Rowe and directed by Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald. (You can see our interview with director/EP Abrahamson about the series here.)\n\nI had the pleasure of chatting with Steve Fanagan (Game of Thrones, Room), who was the supervising sound editor, sound designer and re-recording mixer on the series. Fanagan also contributed to the source music on Normal People, which seamlessly interacts with both the design and a phenomenal licensed soundtrack. From Ireland but now based in London, Fanagan had a lot of knowledge to share on building the soundscape of this world.\n\nFanagan began his process working on the sound design and editorial at his studio in London before heading to Dublin to mix at picture and sound house Outer Limits, which is owned by Abrahamson’s longtime colorist Gary Curran. Fanagan finds that coordinating with the picture editors prior to the shoot is often helpful. In the case of Normal People, second director Macdonald worked with her editor, Stephen O’Connell, in London. Abrahamson worked with his editor, Nathan Nugent, in Dublin at Outer Limits. O’Connell assembled at Outer Limits then came over to London for the fine cutting.\n\nLet’s find out more from Fanagan, how he works with the picture editors and his workflow on the series.\n\nLet’s talk about working with picture editors. In Episode 5, there’s a shot where the music stops with a sudden cut to Jamie cracking a pool ball with his cue, right on the transient. I’ve met a few sound designers that use transients on cuts as a technique.\n\nIt’s a funny thing there. I have to put my hands up and say all credit goes to Nathan Nugent, who cut that episode. That was very much his design. In editorial and then in the mix, we worked on enhancing and expanding on that idea. One of the lovely things about working with a film editor like Nathan is that he is really sophisticated with sound and music.\n\nThe way I tend to work is to get my hands on the script at the beginning of the process, which always happens on Lenny’s projects. I then build a library of stuff I think will be useful. I might start mocking up some tonal, more abstract sound design, but I’m also thinking about all the fundamentals: room tone, wind or whatever environmental material they might need. I always make sure to give that to the editor in advance. Then, as the cutting begins, there is a library to pull from rather than the editor having to go search for things. Hopefully, in doing that, we’ve begun a bit of a conversation, and, hopefully, it means the editor is using stuff that I think is useful.\n\nThere’s something about a guide track that can become very loved because it’s working as they assemble a cut. It’s also a good way around copyright issues with temp effects while supplying the cutting room with high-quality material. I also always try to go and record material specifically for the show. For this series, I spent four days at the locations and got access to all the different houses, to the school, to parts of Trinity College.\n\nA lot of the extras are actual Trinity students?\n\nYes, absolutely. They had about 130 extras, and from what I know, a bunch of those were actual Trinity students. That meant that I got some really good crowd material with that specific crowd, but I also got to just wander around the campus freely with my recording equipment, which you wouldn’t ordinarily be allowed to do.\n\nOn Connell’s first day in Trinity, he comes off Dame Street, which is a busy front road. He walks through the front arch into the front square, and there is something quite magical about leaving this busy city street. As you go through the front arch, it’s an echo-y space, and there’s quite a lovely acoustic to that. There’s always life in it. And when you come into the front square, a lot of the city disappears. Those three locations have such different acoustic properties to them. To be able to record a whole lot of options for those and build a piece that hopefully does that experience justice felt like a real gift.\n\nI noticed a lot of character in the reverbs on each of the voices. Did you take impulse responses of the spaces?\n\nI did. We started to do that with Lenny on his last film, The Little Stranger, and it worked really well. For Normal People, I captured an impulse response from every location I went to. Sometimes they work brilliantly, and sometimes they give you a really good idea of the kind of reverb you’re looking for. So reverb on this series is very much a mixture of Altiverb and those impulse responses, plus Exponential Audio PhoenixVerb for interiors. I’d also used Slapper from The Cargo Cult for exteriors and Avid’s ReVibe as another option on the buss. I try not to be purist about anything.\n\nWhen you get to hang out in the places where they’re shooting, you have a bit of a feel for how they sound. And you remember that if you were speaking at that level in that space, there would be a kind of this size reverb on it. If I’m quieter or louder, that changes.\n\nHow else do you prepare for a project, apart from building that ambience library?\n\nI love building a session template with plugins that I think will be appropriate for the show. With this, it was like, what do I think will be useful to us across all 12 episodes? For the noise reduction, dialogue/ADR supervisor Niall Brady is an iZotope RX wiz, and he used a lot of that on the dialogue track. I tend to use a mixture of Cedar and Waves WNS. I really love FabFilter Pro-Q 3 as an EQ. I love the versatility of it. If I want to put an extra notch or something in there, I can just keep adding to it. I also love their de-esser.\n\nI always have some sort of compression available, but I don’t have it turned on as a default. In this case, I was using Avid Pro Compressor and more often than not, that’s turned off. I love the idea of trying to figure out the simplest approach to the cleanup and to the EQ end of things, and then trying to figure out what I can do with volume automation. After that, it’s just about figuring out if there’s a little bit of extra polish that’s needed through compression.\n\nI always have multi-band compression available to me. On my dialogue auxes, I’ll have some extra compression or de-essing and limiting available if I need it. The one thing that I might leave on the buss is a limiter, but it’s doing almost nothing except managing the peaks. I keep all of my plugins and inserts bypassed and only enable them as I feel I need them.\n\nHow did you handle metering?\n\nWhat’s interesting with the BBC spec is that they don’t just want, for example in our case, a -23 LUFS with a -3 dB true peak. They also want to make sure that the internal dynamic of that spec isn’t too broad for broadcast television — to make sure that at no point are you really hammering music at a very high level or allowing the quiet scenes to be so quiet that people volume surf. We worked hard to keep a good dynamic within that spec. I use VisLM to do those measurements because I quite like the Nugen interfaces. I also use their LMCorrect.\n\nDynamic range was used to great effect in Normal People. In a show like this where so much of the drama is unspoken, when explosions happen — like Marianne’s brother becoming physically abusive happened — they rocked me.\n\nI think it’s that beautiful idea in sound — quiet and loud are always relative. If something needs to feel loud, then if you can have near-silence before it, you’ll get more of that jump in the moment when the loud bit happens.\n\nIt’s also true with the quiet stuff. An example of this in the series is their first kiss in Episode 1. It begins as a normal scene, wherein we’re hearing the ambience outside and inside Marianne’s house. The room tones and that environment are all very live and present, but as the actors lean into each other, it feels natural to start to pull that material away to create some space. This allows us to focus on their breathing and tiny movements because, if you were in that situation, you’re not going to be thinking about the birds outside. I can’t really overstate how much of a joy it was to work on this because all of that material is there. You’re working with this beautiful source material and the book — these beautifully realized scripts — and with directors who’ve really thought that space out. And they’re working with these actors, Paul and Daisy, who just are those characters.\n\nThere’s a beautiful moment, the morning after Marianne meets Connell at Trinity. She’s in her boyfriend’s flat and he gets up and asks her if there’s coffee. The look she gives him, you know he’s a dead man walking. It’s just that idea of being allowed to sit in people’s space, being trusted in a lot of ways as an audience member to observe and to infer rather than sort of being hammered over the head with exposition.\n\nThe screeners I received for this interview were not finalized in terms of picture or sound. As a sound designer I was grateful, because I could see behind the curtain and get insight into your process. It was like hearing a song you can already tell is good before the final mix. Apart from building ambience banks and templates at first, how do you whittle down a project to its final, most polished form?\n\nWhat you’re always trying to do is to be open to the project that’s in front of you. Obviously, the sound work is always a team effort, so Niall Brady, our dialogue and ADR supervisor, is very involved in this as well.\n\nI really love sound but also cinema and storytelling. The work that we get to do as sound designers is an amazing alchemy of all of those things. As you approach the work, you’re just trying to find the way into a scene or a character. If you can find small sounds that help you begin that process, some simple building blocks, then hopefully you can go on a journey with the sound work that will help your director realize the vision that he or she has for the work.\n\nA lot of the time, that can be about really subtle stuff. At times it’s adding things like breath and very close-up breath and nonverbal utterances. The impetus for this in Normal People is intimacy — the idea that these characters are so close together and so inhabiting each other’s space that you’d hear those kinds of noises. A really lovely thing about sound is that it’s a very subconscious experience in a funny way.\n\nOften, the moments where we become aware of sound in film is when it’s not working. So you’re trying to find the things that feel natural, honest and true to what you’re watching. Here, that began with trying to figure out what the environments might sound like. You’ve got this lovely contrast that is a real feature of the book and the series, which is that these two people have quite different backgrounds and quite different home lives.\n\nThe Foley crew that worked on this was Caoimhe Doyle and Jonathan Reynolds, and their work is incredibly specific in that way as well. From trying to pick the right shoes for a character to the right surface to miking techniques, all so that the right acoustic is on that sound.\n\nThis exploration is also facilitated by the collaboration that you have with the entire production. In this case, the collaboration is very much led and directed by Lenny, who has an amazing insight into everything that we’re working on, and his editor Nathan Nugent, who always has a really clear sound and music pass done on an episode. We always have a very interesting place to start. A lot of the time, rather than doing formal spotting sessions, we’ll have conversations. Lenny likes to talk to us in preproduction. I was in touch with the location sound mixer Niall O’Sullivan, who also worked on Lenny’s film Frank, to get ahead of any challenging shoot locations.\n\nThen, what begins to happen is that Lenny and Nathan will share some of the picture with us, whether it’s some scenes that they’ve assembled or full episodes that are work in progress, and we tend to just start working on them. We’ll send some dialogue, music and effects bounces to them, so we’re starting to build the track a little bit. I’m always mixing as I cut because I feel like it’s the best way for me to present the work and figure out what it is. So we’re developing the mix from the beginning of editorial through to the end of the final mix. Sometimes you’re having conversations with them about what they liked or didn’t like, and sometimes you’re getting the next version of the cut back, and you can see from their AAF what they’ve used or haven’t used.\n\nAlso, as you’re watching the cuts, you’re looking for those notes from them that may appear on a card or a subtitle on the screen. So it’s a really helpful way to work.\n\nPatrick Birk is a musician, sound engineer and post pro at Silver Sound, a boutique sound house based in New York City.\n\nBy Iain Blair\n\nEgyptian-American comedian and writer Ramy Youssef created, produced and stars in the Hulu show Ramy. Part comedy, part drama, the show immediately endeared itself to audiences and critics for its thoughtful, non-stereotypical take on the American Muslim community, as well as its humorous take on the millennial experience.\n\nRamy follows its titular character, Ramy Hassan (played by Youssef), a first-generation Muslim-American who is on a spiritual journey in his politically divided New Jersey neighborhood. The show brought a new perspective to the screen as it explores the challenges of what it’s like being caught between a Muslim community that thinks life is a moral test and a millennial generation that thinks life shouldn’t be taken quite so seriously.\n\nThe series, produced by A24 won an SXSW Audience Award and a 2020 Golden Globe for Youssef. Ramy Season 2 premiered on May 29.\n\nI recently spoke with showrunner Youssef, whose credits include roles on See Dad Run and Mr. Robot as well as his HBO one-hour comedy special Ramy Youssef: Feelings, about making the show and his love of editing and post.\n\nThis show definitely broke new TV ground. How hard a sell was this show when you started?\n\nI had the idea for the show for years, probably since 2012, and I found back then that people weren’t so receptive to a show built centrally around an Arab Muslim cast. People would suggest adding a neighbor, or having it just be a “B” story in a larger story. That was the initial temperature in Hollywood for a while, but then we got more specific and focused with the story and zoomed in on the characters. By the time I got the pitch going, places were open and receptive. We took it to seven networks and got three offers, which is a pretty good ratio.\n\nYou play a “semi-autobiographical” version of yourself as a millennial Muslim living at home in New Jersey. How much of Ramy is in TV Ramy?\n\n(Laughs) A fair amount, but I was very lucky growing up to have the resources around me to help me with the questions I had and to find answers. I was very lucky to find a creative outlet to help me express myself. But the Ramy I play is different from me since he hasn’t found his outlet yet. And he has a family that doesn’t talk about things as much as my real family does. So he’s a bit more stuck and doesn’t have the answers yet. He’s still going in circles.\n\nSeason 2 has expanded the characters and widened the scope. What can you tell us about it, considering a second season wasn’t a sure thing?\n\nIt wasn’t, you’re right. For me, Season 1 was very much about the character asking, “Who am I?” and seeing Ramy trying to figure that out in a more abstract way. Season 2 is him trying to deal with who he actually is and a lot of the problems he has. We see that with everyone in the family. We get far deeper into the things that are bothering them and into the secrets of the characters, so we understand more about what they’re dealing with privately in a more open way.\n\nDo you like being a showrunner?\n\nI do, but it wasn’t even a case of liking or disliking it — it had to happen with this show because it’s so close to me. I don’t think anyone else would feel comfortable having to make certain choices for the show. It’s a really interesting question because I began shooting things in high school, before I was ever on camera.\n\nWe had a really great TV program back then — we put on the morning news for the school, and I learned so much about production. I even got certified as an Apple Final Cut editor while I was still at high school, and all that continued through college. So now, 10 years later, I can walk onto a set and all the small things I learned back then are really useful. It’s just scaled up from what I used to do with no budget at all. I do enjoy the job, though it’s very stressful.\n\nWhere do you post?\n\nWe do all the editing at Senior Post in Brooklyn. We do audio post at Sound Lounge, and video playback services are done by Visual Alchemy. I’m least involved in the DI, as I have a color deficiency, so I leave the grading to the colorist, Light Iron’s Steve Bodner (using Blackmagic Resolve), and DP Claudio Rietti. I love post, and it’s the realest part of the whole process for me. Writing is imaginative, but in post it’s like, “OK, this is reality.” And the first time I watch a cut of any episode, my barometer is, “Am I fully depressed? Or am I just mildly depressed?” If it’s the latter, I feel it’ll be a good episode.\n\nPost is very emotional for me because I have to watch my face all the time, and I sit in on every edit. Right now, because of COVID-19, I’m doing remote editing and typing up 15 pages of notes per cut, with timecode and everything. The great thing with post is that you’re sitting there and you can make it all happen, and I love writing and then re-writing in post.\n\n[Says Light Iron’s Bodner: “For Ramy Season 2, the DP and I sat down before principal photography, played with his test footage and started discussing the look. Claudio wanted to go with more of a natural look and feel for Season 2 as Ramy seems to be finding himself this season. We did that with reduced contrast and natural color saturation compared to Season 1. In Season 1, Ramy was still trying to find himself, so Season 1 DP Adrian Correia and I went with a more stylized look with some pushed colors and contamination in the low lights. We finished all the color for Season 2 remotely during the pandemic. I was working from home and sending files to Claudio for notes and color sign-off. We hit a groove, and it actually worked out very well in the end. Claudio shot some really beautiful footage for me to work with.”]\n\nYou have several editors, I as"
