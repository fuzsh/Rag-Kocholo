        "text": "Johnny Sablan \"Chamorro Country\" (Hafa Adai Recordings, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Johnny Sablan)\n\nMicronesian singer Johnny Sablan was a native of Guam who dedicated his music to the preservation of the hyper-local Chamorro language, often mixing Chamorro and English in a variety of musical genres. Legit country music was a significant part of his repertoire and he often created bilingual versions of country standards, although most of his records featured original pop or soul numbers he wrote or solicited from his fellow Guamanians. Born in 1947, Johnny Sablan moved to the US mainland with his parents in the early 'Sixties, where he came to the attention of record execs at Columbia, who signed him to cut a handful of teenpop singles and booked him to tour with their other artists. After living in Los Angeles for a couple of years, he returned to Guam in '63 and kept a fairly low profile while finishing school, but in 1967 he entered a music contest that explicitly celebrated Chamorro culture, which inspired his lifelong mission to record and promote Chamorro music. He recorded the first all-Chamorro album, Dalai Nene, in 1968 and started his own record label in 1971, and though he moved back to California for the rest of the decade, he continued to discover and promote younger artists from Guam. This is one of his more country-oriented albums, a stylistic interest that's probably not so surprising considering all the American servicemen stationed on the island.\n\nJohnny Sablan \"Johnny Sablan Sings...\" (Hafa Adai Recordings, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Johnny Sablan)\n\nOn this album Johnny Sablan included adaptations of classics such as \"Release Me,\" \"Your Cheatin' Heart\" and, perhaps most appropriately, a version of the already-bilingual Freddy Fender hit, \"Before The Next Teardrop Falls.\" There also some pop standards, like \"Makin' Whoopie\" and \"Pearly Shells,\" while Side Two of the album is given over to all-Guamanian material, mostly original material composed by Mr. Sablan. Some of his other albums had country themes as well, though I think not all of them... It might take a while to sort it out.\n\nSacramento Fiddlers \"Sacramento Fiddlers\" (Sacramento Fiddlers, 1968-?) (LP)\n\nAlthough this sounds like it would be a compilation album, \"Sacramento Fiddlers\" seems to be the name chosen by this informal old-timey/bluegrass stringband drawing on talent from California's Central Valley. Side One showcases the fiddling of Delbert McGrath, who won the 1967 state fiddling championship, while Side Two features Frank Gunn, who had a more local profile. Also on board is old-timey elder Mike Bibby, a seventy-one year old fiddler who adds a few licks on the closing tracks of both sides. Although various musicians on this album competed in state championships, the Sacramento Fiddlers group remained independent from the official California State Old Time Fiddlers Association, preferring laid-back jam sessions to the more intense competitive model. As far as I know this was the group's only album, though Gunn and McGrath's performances in a 1967 competition are included on an album documenting the 1967 state competition which was won by McGrath.\n\nThe Saddle City Band \"Bareback\" (Carte Blanche Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Cashman & Rick Nuttall)\n\nThis Tucson, Arizona twangband upholds a long tradition of longhaired desert country artists playing jaunty, uptempo music fronted by fairly jittery, plainspoken lead singers. I dunno, I guess it's just an Arizona thing...(?) Anyway, this band came at the tale end of the whole 'Seventies outlaw scene, and while their more rollicking numbers seem anchored in the western swing/roadhouse revival, the album feel a little too slick with slightly antiseptic production, with half an eye towards commercial airplay. Some tracks are really terrible, though this still has some fairly rootsy material, and is notable for the democratic spotlighting of several different bandmembers as lead vocalists. The strongest and most \"country\" soloist was pianist Duncan Stitt, who'd also released a solo album a few years earlier. They seem to have been aiming for a middle-of-the-road, Oak Ridge Boys/Alabama top forty sound, which I imagine was a disappointment to some of their local fans, but this is still worth a spin.\n\nThe Saddle City Band \"The Lights Of Tucson\" (Art Attack Records, 1988)\n\nI haven't heard this follow-up album yet, but look forward to tracking it down. As fate would have it, Saddle City was a remarkably successful local group, playing shows right through the 1990s, 2000s and beyond.\n\nDan Sadowsky & The Ophelia Swing Band \"Swing Tunes Of The '30s & '40s\" (Biscuit City Records, 1977) (LP)\n\nA lively set of retro-novelty swing'n'jazz from a band that could be considered Colorado's answer to Dan Hicks & The Hot Licks, though perhaps with a more straightforward jazz orientation. Good stuff! Ray Bonneville and Tim O'Brien are among the guest performers, showing some links to the folk'n'bluegrass scene... Worth a whirl if you can track it down.\n\nDan Sadowsky & The Ophelia Swing Band \"Spreadin' Rhythm Around!\" (Biscuit City Records, 1979) (LP)\n\nBilly Sage \"When The White Azaleas Are Blooming\" (Kasa Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nBilly Sage \"Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall\" (Cannassee Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Wood)\n\nA later release from New Jersey hillbilly singer-picker Billy Sage, who released a string of 45s in the 'Sixties, including several duets with his musical partner and co-composer, a Rose Maddox-y gal named Kookie Kay. Although he was a Garden State artist, Billy Sage hoofed it down to Nashville to cut this good-natured set, with backing from an all-star crew that included D.J. Fontana, Greg Galbraith, Doug Jernigan and Bunky Keels, and some gut string guitar from producer-arranger Bob Wood. So okay, let's be honest, Billy Sage didn't seem to have the biggest range -- maybe his voice was more supple when he was a kid -- and, yeah, and maybe his relationship with pure pitch is a little remote -- but he seems well aware of his own limits, and is just plain having fun singing his songs. Which, by the way, are his own originals, and are pretty darn good. It's kind of like if Moe Bandy was some guy you'd actually want to hang out with. I'm sure this is an album that many would make fun of, but I really like it. Mr. Sage has a hangdog authenticity that, once you get on his wavelength, is pretty hard to to resist. Alas, I wasn't able to uncover much biographical info about Mr. Sage, though he was definitely a stalwart figure on the East Coast country scene, with plenty of show notices in Jersey and environs, particularly in the late 'Sixties.\n\nThe Sage Brothers Band \"Got This Feeling...\" (Ravin' Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jamie Goldsmith)\n\nA country bar-band from Boscobel, Wisconsin, led by singer-guitarist Jim C. Berlin, who wrote all the songs. The rest of the group included Dan McCauley (bass), Butch Ortman (lead guitar), and Paul Roberts on drums. This is pretty fresh-sounding a a bit raw, with dense, sharp electric guitars, perhaps anticipating the rock-adjacent \"Americana\" scene of the late '80s and early '90s. Definitely worth a spin.\n\nThe Sage Brothers Band \"Still Beating The Brush\" (Ravin' Records, 1984) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jim C. Berlin, Ray Cherie & Chet Puscarz)\n\nAs on their first album, all the songs are credited to Jim Berlin, including two songs -- \"Angel In The Morning, Devil At Night\" and \"Ballad Of White Cloud\" -- which were released as a single a couple of years later in 1986 on the Kansas-based Comstock label. The lineup for this album is pretty much the same, with the additions of a new drummer, Doug Hayes, as well as Bob Lilley on steel guitar.\n\nDoug Sahm (and The Sir Douglas Quintet) -- see artist profile\n\nSailcat \"Motorcycle Mama\" (Elektra Records, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Pete Carr)\n\nQuintessential one-hit wonders, Sailcat was a band formed by two veterans of the Alabama rock-soul scene, John Wyker and Court Pickett, along with a bunch of Muscle Shoals-ian hired hands. The album is a mix of soft Southern rock and even softer, airy acoustic prog, with a teeny bit of twang, though the country-rock association is pretty iffy... The title track was almost a Top Ten hit, but the band broke up shortly after the album came out -- but Southern rock fans looking for something a bit mellower than usual might like this one. The original LP is also notable for the album art by Mad magazine cartoonist Jack Davis, who provided the front cover and a big spread in the gatefold that illustrates the album's supposed \"concept,\" of an Easy Rider-lookalike biker who first dreams of, then hooks up with an ideal hippie-biker babe. At first things are wild and wooly, then they spend time apart, and then we see them singing onstage at the Opry, and finally motorcycle dude is kicking back on his front porch, living the quiet life at last. Not bad for a jam-band record that's half-instrumentals!\n\nRonnie St. Charles & And The Sounds Of Country \"My Way\" (Mountain Valley Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jim Evers & Max Stroup)\n\nA live recording from a show held at Elks Lodge 2168, in Howell, Michigan, a couple of miles down the road from Fowlerville, the home of bandleader Ronnie St. Charles. This is a good one for folks who enjoy warts-and-all \"real people\" private press albums: the sound quality is a little muffled, though band is pretty competent albeit with a few rough edges, while the vocalists tend to ham it up a bit. The band included two lead singers, Ronnie St. Charles and Tom Deladurantaye (who are also the guitar players) along with Barney Delkman on bass, and drummer Tim McPherson. No date on the disc, but the inclusion of cover songs such as \"Leroy Brown,\" \"Lucille\" and \"Luckenbach, Texas\" suggests sometime around 1978-79. Honestly, not a great record, but an honest snapshot of a perky local band.\n\nWes St. John \"Oilfield Cowboy\" (Star-Key Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gene Lawson & Wes St. John)\n\nOh, yeah. There's a story behind this one. Ten songs all about working the oil fields, all written by Mr. Wes St. John, who was a native of Tilghman, Maryland. \"Oilfield Cowboy,\" \"Oilfield Trucker,\" \"Oilfield Trash And Proud Of It!,\" and perhaps most delightfully, \" The Story Of The Derrick Man, Toolpusher, Roustabout, Driller And The Company Man.\" You detect a pattern here? Amazingly, Mr. St. John was not actually an oil worker; he just got into the topic when he was down in Louisiana hanging out at and performing in roughneck bars, and decided to write a bunch of \"oilfield\" songs because he saw a gap that needed to be filled. (Apparently he wasn't familiar with Alex Zanetis's similar efforts from a couple of decades earlier...) It turns out he wasn't a complete monomaniac, though: Mr. St. John also released a single that had no thematic links to the petroleum industry -- \"The Ballad Of E.T.\"/\"I've Got A Friend\" -- although years later he returned to petro-twang, and recorded three more oilfield albums in the digital era. Although he gives a home address in Tilghman, Maryland, St. John went to Nashville to record these sessions, with backing by studio pros such as Vic Jordan, Benny Kennerson, Bruce Watkins and Gene O'Neal on steel guitar, and a modest horn section to boot.\n\nPhil St. Pierre \"John Jawad's Pioneer Inn Presents: Phil St. Pierre Just For You\" (19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Lori Stewart Shirley & John W. Onzo)\n\nA souvenir album of the Pioneer Inn, a popular steakhouse located in the Bay Area town of Clayton, California, near the city of Concord. Housed in a historic building that dates back to the Gold Rush days, the Pioneer Inn was a former stagecoach stop that went through a number of changes before becoming the restaurant known as Chubby's, which was sold to longtime owner John Jawad in the early 1960s. Jawad ran the Pioneer Inn until retiring in 1990, and one of his regular entertainers was \"gut-bucket\" guitarist Phil St. Pierre. This double LP spotlights St. Pierre on a couple of dozen low-key, solo acoustic performances, just him his guitar, singing a bunch of country classics (stuff by Eddy Arnold, Hank Williams, and others) along with numerous 1970s AOR hits, such as \"If\" and \"Country Roads.\" To be honest, it's all a bit underwhelming -- he croons in a relaxed manner, and strums along in an amiable though un-virtuosic way, reminiscent of the '60s coffeehouse folk scene. Still, it's authentic as all getout: you can easily imagine having a few drinks and ordering a burger while he sang unobtrusively on a small corner stage. In fact, I'll have another round!\n\nJim Salestrom \"Limited Edition\" (1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Kris O'Connor, Dugg Duggan & Steve Avedis)\n\nOriginally from Omaha, Nebraska, songwriter Jim Salestrom formed the country-rock band Timberline with his brother Chuck while still in his teens; the group released one album in 1977 then disbanded the following year. Salestrom landed on his feet, though, landing a decade-long gig playing in Dolly Parton's band, while also recording a string of solo albums, and even performing the opening number in the movie Best Little Whorehouse In Texas. He became a Colorado-based artist, blending country and folk, and years later formed the band Wild Jimbos with erstwhile Nitty Gritty bandmember Jimmy Ibbotson. As far as I know, this was his first solo album, and was issued with two different covers, one white, the other black, though the content was the same on both versions. This album features all-original material written by Jim Salestrom, with one song co-written by producer Kris O'Connor. The band included Jim Salestrom on banjo and guitar, Dugg Duggan (electric guitar), Jerome Gilmer (accordion), Rich Hallam (bass), Andy Peake (drums), and Salestrom's brother Chuck Salestrom, sitting in on bass.\n\nJim Salestrom \"Blue River Dreamin' \" (1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Kris O'Connor & Ronny Light)\n\nJim Salestrom \"Genuine Colorado\" (1984)\n\n(Produced by John Macy & Jim Salestrom)\n\nJim Salestrom \"Look Through Any Window\" (Rebecca Records, 1986)\n\n(Produced by John Macy)\n\nSalinas \"Salinas\" (Trapp Records, 1978) (LP)\n\nA mystery band on an anonymous label, but definitely country, or at least country-rock. This album includes covers of songs by the Dead (\"Casey Jones,\") Creedence Clearwater Revival (\"Down On The Corner\") and the doper's novelty classic, \"Henry,\" by the New Riders Of The Purple Sage, along with some 'Seventies soft-rock and Top Forty twang from the likes of Kenny Loggins and the Eagles. One song may have been an original, \"Sister Sue\" -- credited to Tichy, Barton, Farlow and Stern, a trail I followed that produced no additional info. I dunno if these folks were actually from Salinas (California, I'd assume) but this was recorded in Nashville.\n\nSaloon Music \"Saloon Music\" (Sounds Unlimited, 1973) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Mark Dutill & Roy Youngmark)\n\nThis album appears to have been a side project of Michigan folk-rocker Brad Thrower, a bass player and guitarist from Swartz Creek, MI, who was in a series of late 'Sixties/early 'Seventies bands with his hometown buddy, guitar picker Jim Spillane. Apparently Saloon Music came about when Spillane was recuperating from an accident in which he broke his arm, and a restless Brad Thrower recruited several other dudes from the Flint/East Lansing region to form a temporary new band and record some of the groovy music swirling around in his head. The group included Thrower on bass and electric guitar, along with Jack Hamilton (guitar), Frank Schultz (guitar), Nelson Wood (steel guitar), with Rod Clouthier pinch-hitting on bass and drums on a few tunes. Thrower and Spillane continued to work together on a variety of projects, including a group called Bluejohn, whose 1975 album, Boots And Bottles, was more explicitly country-oriented.\n\nSalt Creek \"Salt Creek\" (Audio House, 1977-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Larry Miller)\n\nNot sure where these three guys were from, but I can tell where their hearts lay: tons of covers of hard country/outlaw tunes by folks like Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, and Hank Williams, as well as a few softer ballads such as \"Statue Of A Fool,\" and even a version of \"Kansas City.\" There are no song credits, but I'd imagine \"Salt Creek Boogie\" was an original of their own devising. The group consisted of Guy Chizek (guitar & vocals), Ed Glenn (bass) and Terry Baxa (drums)... I couldn't find any info about them online, so I'd guess they didn't really play many gigs, and that this was their only album; it was pressed by the Audio House custom label in Lawrence, Kansas, so they were probably from the Midwest.\n\nSalt Creek \"Just About Due\" (MT Records, 1977) (LP)\n\nA very intriguing album. One of several different bands called Salt Creek, this Lansing, Michigan country-rock group was led by songwriters Bernie Nelson and Dan Tripp, who penned most of their material, singing and picking guitar with all-local backing from Chris Amos on bass, Mike Brush (piano), Billy Clark (pedal steel), Kathy Ford (vocals), Dave Giegerich (dobro), and Bob Grunder on drums. At first blush, the album may sound amateurish and poorly recorded, but it grows on you. Highlights include cover tunes such as their version of Toy Caldwell's \"Can't You See,\" along with a swell take on Tom Waits' \"Old '55\" and an equally evocative rendition of John Sebastian's \"Stories We Could Tell.\" Though perhaps not as punchy or cohesive as many of their country-rock contemporaries, heard from decades away, these guys actually sound ahead of their time, anticipating the poetic indie-rocker twang of folks such as Ryan Adams or the Old 97s, et.al., music that to find its country bona fides while also paving a path to a new musical dialectic. Several tracks have a dreamy, reflective feel, though they weren't averse to a novelty number or two, as heard on the album's closer, \"Toilet-Huggin' Drunk Again.\" There's really only one stinker on here, a bad cosmic folk tune with religious overtones, called \"Chosen One,\" but other than that, this is a pretty appealing set. I'm not sure when this band first formed, but they were still together through the end of 1979, when they were touring as far away from home as Saint Louis, and planning a trip out to California, performing as a trio with bassist Randy Boudreau. Reading between the lines, a lengthy profile piece in the Lansing State Journal paints a fairly glum picture of a struggling local band swimming against the tide of an increasingly corporatized music business. I think they gave up not long after that, got jobs and settled down, but as obscuro indie-twang albums go, this disc is certainly a fine legacy.\n\nSalt Creek \"Livin' On The Bayou\" (Atchafalaya Music, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Don Kendrick, Gene Foster & Salt Creek)\n\nThese younger, slightly scruffy-lookin' fellas were a cajun roots-twang band from Louisiana, featuring Sam Alfano on drums, Rob Haines (dobro, mandolin & steel guitar), Dick Hughes (accordion and guitar), Don Kendrick (drums), and Randy Rea playing fiddle and guitar. All the songs were Hughes/Rea originals, most with local and regional themes, and some with bilingual French-English lyrics. Not sure where they were from, though the album was recorded at a studio in Bogalusa.\n\nThe Salt Creek Band \"Gamblin' Fool\" (The Good Music Agency, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dave Hanson)\n\nThis was a band from Excelsior, Minnesota, recorded live at a place called the Zodiac Lounge... The group included Shawn O'Neill, Mark Crocker, Tim Docheff and Jim Henkemeyer on bass.\n\nThe Salt Creek Band \"Barn Dancin' \" (CBO Records, 1986) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ben Ewings & Steven Chandler)\n\nThis edition of the band was still a four-piece, but with a big change in lineup: Chris Thomas Becker (guitars, piano, pedal steel), James \"Henk\" Henkemeyer (drums and vibraphone), Dave Hutcheson (bass), Shawn O'Neill (fiddle, guitars, harmonica), with special mention below going to keyboardist Bob Blackford and Sam Mineer on banjo... Looks like all-original material, with tunes like \"Best Of Two Evils,\" \"Split Decision\" and \"Tennessee TNT.\"\n\nSalt Lick \"Rural Lust & Urban Rust\" (Tex Brass Records, 1980) (LP)\n\nA twangy acoustic crew from Fort Worth, Texas with a sly, satiric bent, wed to a slightly slurred stringband sound, landing them somewhere between the Red Clay Ramblers and the Asylum Street Spankers, style-wise.\n\nSalt Lick \"Daynce Of The Peckerwoods\" (Tex Brass Records, 1982) (LP)\n\nSalt Lick \"Salt Lick Sockeroos\" (Tex Brass Records, 1985) (LP)\n\nMickey Salter \"...Sings Nashville\" (American Eagle Records, 1975-?) (LP)\n\nThere's no date on this album, but the liner notes mention Salter's appearance in the Burt Reynolds movie, W. W. And The Dixie Dancekings, which came out early in 1975, and the most contemporary songs on here are early 'Seventies hits, such as \"Country Roads,\" \"For The Good Times\" and \"Help Me Make It Through The Night,\" so '75 or possibly '76 seems like a good bet. Also at the time, Salter had a gig at the now-defunct Albert Pick Motor Inn in Nashville, which is mentioned on the back cover... Salter lived in Nashville throughout the early 1980s, moving to McCausland, Iowa mid-decade, where he worked as an entertainer on the Queen Of Hearts riverboat in the \"Quad Cities\" region. In the early 1990s, he moved with his family to Florida; his son, Joe Salter lives in Pensacola and got a bunch of press a few years back for trying to set some kind of record for \"joggling\" (juggling while jogging... I guess it's a thing?) Apparently his dad taught him how: Mickey Salter had worked juggling into his act during his riverboat days... Sounds nice... kinda wish I'd been on board, ice tea in my hand...\n\nMickey Salter \"This Country Boy Loves You\" (American Eagle Records, 1979) (LP)\n\nMickey Salter \"Third Album\" (1982) (LP)\n\nMickey Salter \"Live!\" (Mickey Salter Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Sam Pugh)\n\nA live set, recorded at The Cannery, in Nashville...\n\nEd Samons & The Kentucky Mountain Boys \"Sacred Sounds Of Bluegrass\" (Gloryland Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jack Casey & Marvin Jones)\n\nWell, I'm always a sucker for good country gospel, especially all that backwoods stuff from the Ohio/Kentucky axis where all the hillbillies hung out. Plus, I have a weird fascination with the \"beach\" stock-art album covers, of which this is a fine example. Mandolin picker Edmond Samons recorded several albums of straight-up, premium bluegrass gospel, as well as numerous indie-label singles. He grew up in Wayland, Kentucky, though he'd moved to Ohio by the time his recording career kicked into gear, and ran his own recording studio on the outskirts of Columbus. Mr. Samons worked with the same group of musicians near over the span of a decade or so: fiddler Eldon Allen, Leslie Gillam on banjo, Joe Martin on guitar, and bass player Starr Orr. They had a pleasantly round-toned, melodic sound that integrated several different strands of classic bluegrass -- Samons' own brisk solos echoed Bill Monroe, while the bright, assertive banjo riffs had more of a Flatt & Scruggs feel. Over it all, though, is a sweet, soft feel more reminiscent of the Stanley Brothers. So, if you're a truegrass fan, this should really rock your socks off.\n\nDon Sampson \"American Songs\" (Revolver Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Don Sampson)\n\nWhile living in Hoodsport, Washington, country-folkie Don Sampson rounded up some primo talent, including super-picker Frank Reckard of the Emmylou Harris Hot Band, and drummer Don Heffington (who was also playing with Emmylou, and later co-founded the band Lone Justice). This was Sampson's first album, and he would continue to work with many of these same musicians, including the backing singers, for several years. He later went by his full name, Don Michael Sampson, and has re-released this album and others under that name.\n\nDon Sampson \"Coyote\" (Revolver Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Don Sampson)\n\nThis one's more on the folkie side of the spectrum, but with enough country twang to merit notice here... Recorded in LA, this album boasts a studio crew of considerable heft, with Frank Reckard and Don Heffington rejoining Sampson in the studio, as well as Bill Keith playing on a couple of tunes, and a rhythm section that included a pre-Chris Isaak Roly Salley on bass. I gotta admit, Sampson doesn't quite do it for me as a vocalist, but he sure did roll with the right kinda people.\n\nSan Francisco Medicine Ball & Friends \"On A Slow Boat To China\" (Real Turkey Records & Tapes, 1976)\n\n(Produced by David Sturdevant, Jack Converey & Brian Van Der Mueler)\n\nFor some reason, the 1970s San Francisco independent music scene was a longtime home to neo-trad Dixieland and jazz revivalists... I guess as an outgrowth of the tourist trade's romanticization of the old \"Barbary Coast\" saloons and brothels, which were represented decades later by various Dixieland acts in the '50s, '60s and '70s. The SF Medicine Ball was one of the last bands in this tradition, and despite the groovy, acid test-looking, hippiedelic artwork, this was a pretty straightforward trad-retro set, with compact arrangements that mostly showcased the fast but not too fancy banjo picking and a few vocals as well. Not all that twangy, but worth mentioning anyway...\n\nCarlo San Paolo \"My Raggedy Ann\" (Lark Ellen Records, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Arlene Buckner, Erwin E. Buckner & Fern Doral)\n\nA questionable entry, though there are country threads... Multi-instrumentalist Carlo San Paolo (who also went by the simple mononym \"Carlo\") was originally from Saint Louis, Missouri and seems to have had a pop-oriented background, touring as a teen with a rock group called Illustrated Sounds, which cut a couple of singles circa 1969. He met his muse, lyricist Arlene Buckner, while performing in New Orleans and at some point they both wound up in Los Angeles, where Carlo joined Paul Foster's country band, The Hand Me Downs, which cut an album on Lark Ellen Records in 1974. Apparently he quit that group when they went on tour up in Alaska, stayed in LA and recorded this disc, which has a less overtly country tone than Foster's disc.\n\nFrankie Sanchez \"Let's Walk Through The Ruins\" (Charta Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Charlie Fields & Kevin McManns)\n\nTo be honest, this is a fairly torturous album... If you're really into overripe countrypolitan, you might dig this, but it'll be rough going for a lot of listeners. Singer Frankie Sanchez was originally from Guam, though he lived stateside in the 1950s and '60s, and played in a couple of California-based bands called the Velvetones and the Coming Generation before moving back to Guam in 1971. As far as I can tell, this was a songwriter's demo album, with a couple of songs credited to producer Charlie Fields, a couple more to Dennis East and one by Frankie Sanchez, \"Love, Love Me Tonight,\" as well as a slew of one-offs by various folks I've never heard of... Sanchez invariably tackles them in the same spirit, imbuing the lyrics with as much emotive schmaltz as he can muster... The Nashville backing band includes pros such as Gregg Galbraith, Sonny Garrish and Bruce Watkins -- all of whom seem to be going through the motions -- as well as keyboardist John Propst, who also provides the lush string arrangements. Again, fans of the '70s sound might like this -- although I believe it was released in '79, it sound like music from a much earlier era, i.e. the late '60s and early '70s.\n\nDon Sanders \"Don Sanders\" (Mean & Low, 1972) (LP)\n\nThis is really more of a folkie thing, but definitely deserves a place in the annals of Texas indie-twang. Don Sanders was a Houston-area folkie who helped co-found the noncommercial KPFT radio station (part of the Pacifica network) and was one of its original cadre of DJs. He's released a bunch of albums over the years, but this was his first, and is a sterling example of uber-DIY musicmaking, originally released in basically a generic white jacket, with a die-cut center hole that reveals the simple geometric design on the disc itself. Good record, though -- a bit grittier and wittier than your standard-issue folkie fare. Some extra tracks from the same session were later released as the Mean & Low (EP) in 1973...\n\nEd Sanders \"Sanders' Truckstop\" (Warner Brothers, 1970) (LP)\n\nThe first solo album by East Coast poet-activist Ed Sanders, co-founder of the confrontational avant-garde yippie folk group The Fugs. After they disbanded, Sanders continued his satire of American culture with a pair of country-tinged albums that reflected the divide between \"straights\" and weirdos like hippies and queers. Perhaps the best-known song is the blithe yet belabored recitation song, \"Jimmy Joe, The Hippybilly Boy,\" surrounded by tunes like \"The Iliad\" (about rednecks beating up gays) along with myriad hippie-druggie references. The broad, blunt humor and caustic lampooning of small-town prejudice may seem a bit over-the-top now, but in Sanders' defense, folks nowadays might not realize that there was a lot of truth to the pictures he painted: rebels and longhairs really did get their asses kicked by rednecks and frat boys in the '60s and '70s, and this albums reflects the tensions of the time, albeit in a strident, assertive style. Like the old Fugs records, it's not exactly the kind record you'd put on for relaxation, or really need to hear more than once, but it is an significant roadmark in early '70s alt-country, even if Sanders didn't take the \"country\" part of it seriously, other than as a target for parody. (He did have real roots in the New York folkie-bohemian scene, with ties to the Holy Modal Rounders and other avant-folk musicians, many of whom play on here, but that crowd definitely saw Nashville as playing for the other team...) Anyway, this is a semi-funny, rather acerbic album, worth checking out for its political content, though I doubt you'll cherish it forever and ever.\n\nEd Sanders \"Beer Cans On The Moon\" (Warner Brothers, 1973) (LP)\n\nSanders (and everybody else in America) got weirder and weirder as the '70s went along, and 1973 was a peak year for weirdness and general tension in the culture. This more rock-oriented album still has its country touchstones, like \"Yodeling Robot,\" a song about an automaton that falls in love with Dolly Parton, but it also has many more pointed political references, in songs such as \"Nonviolent Direct Action\" and \"Henry Kissinger,\" which reflect the simmering frustrations of the Watergate era, when \"the system\" really seemed to have collapsed, but not in a particularly good way. Less fun and way more grind-y than Truckstop, but also groovy in its own bizarre, historical way. If you're looking for hard-left anarcho-hippie country music, this is about as extreme as it gets. But it is pretty blunt, and it sure ain't easy listening.\n\nGeorge Sanders \"Country Mornin' \" (George Sanders, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by George Sanders & Gary Holmes)\n\nWith a local band behind him this fella from Jacksonville, Florida, plays a mix of straight-up bluegrass (tunes like \"Blackberry Blossom\") and more folkie/country material, including a handful of his own original songs. He also covers John Hartford's \"Skippin' On The Mississippi Dew,\" (and that alone has got me interested...!) as well as Austinite Mike Williams' \"Blue Skies And Teardrops,\" along with various other songwriters. The musicians seem to be all Florida locals, including Gordon Burt on fiddle, Eddie Criminger (bass), Gary Holmes (guitar), Bobby Horton (banjo and dobro), Jerry John (pedal steel), Mac McCormack (drums), and Terry Ryan on guitar, led by George Sanders on vocals and guitar.\n\nHarlan Sanders \"Off And Running\" (Epic Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ben Tallent & Nick Palladino)\n\nWell, this guy sure had an interesting story: an ex-convict who was championed by Johnny Cash, Sanders made his mark as a rootsy honkytonk songwriter in the early 1970s, penning his first hits while still in prison. Cash helped both Sanders and his writing partner Glen Sherley get paroled, then hired them as staff writers for his own \"House Of Cash\" publishing company. In 1973, Sanders started his own company and had a number of his songs covered by a variety of artists, including one of my all-time faves, George Jones' 1982 hit, \"If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will).\" This was his first album, and the only one for a major label, and there's some interesting stuff on it. Side One is kind of mainstream sounding, with a hefty dose of Waylon-ish outlaw ruggedness; on Side Two he loosens up a bit and gets a little more creative with the arrangements and material. At first his voice might not wow you -- he's got a good, deep baritone, but his delivery isn't super-charismatic... There's a level of confidence or panache that he doesn't quite hit, the difference between a songwriter and a star, I guess. But as a cult artist, he's kind of cool, and his low-key voice will definitely grow on you. (BTW, as far as I can tell, he was not related to Col. Harland Sanders, of KFC fame, though I did try pretty hard to find out if he was...)\n\nHarlan Sanders \"The Arizona Whiz\" (Brylen Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Pete Drake & Harlan Sanders)\n\nThis indie outing was Sanders' second full-length release though he also recorded a bunch of as-yet uncollected singles. Apparently the rights to this disc are more accessible than the stuff on Columbia, as this album has been reissued numerous times, including the K-Tel and Jukebox editions below...\n\nHarlan Sanders \"His Best\" (K-Tel Records, 2006)\n\nHarlan Sanders \"Somewhere In Texas\" (Jukebox Entertainment Records, 2008)\n\nMack Sanders \"...And His Swing Band\" (Mercury Records, 1964) (LP)\n\nBandleader Mack Sanders (1923-2003) was a deejay from Kansas who cut a few singles in the '50s, and a couple of LPs in the '60s, also recording under the name Johnny Bozeman. Working at a variety of stations, Sanders was a pioneering figure in Midwestern country music broadcasting, establishing Wichita's first full-time country station. With country star Webb Pierce as his business partner, Sanders purchased a string of radio stations throughout the Midwest, as well as a foothold in Nashville. He was married to singer Sherry Bryce, up until his death in 2003. This album features vocals from Sanders as well as Gene McCoy and Jeanie Pierson, a female singer with a very rough, rugged vocal style (who I believe may have been Sanders' first wife...) The music is a nice mix of easygoing honkytonk and country swing, similar to the Hank Thompson sound. It's not top flight, but it is pretty good -- the fiddle and steel guitar are particularly nice. Definitely worth a spin!\n\nMack Sanders \"Tonkin' The Blues\" (Pilot Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tommy Allsup, Sherry Bryce Sanders, Terry Skinner & Tom Sparkman)\n\nA flashy set of latter-day western swing, with an all-star cast that included studio heavyweights such as steel player Curly Chalker, pianist Bill Purcell, as well as Leon Rhodes, Hargus Pig Robbins, Buddy Spicher, and Jerry Wallace, and perhaps most intriguingly, twang-bar king Travis Wammack on lead guitar. The album was recorded in separate sessions in Nashville and Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and co-produced by Sanders' wife, singer Sherry Bryce, who also helped manage their string of radio stations. She penned three songs on this album, \"Close Down the Honky Tonks,\" \"Honky Tonk Bands\" and \"Sometimes Bad, Sometimes Good, Sometimes Gone,\" while Sanders contributed two others, \"Sweet Country Girl\" and the title track, \"Tonkin' The Blues.\"\n\nVernon Sandusky \"Vernon Sandusky\" (GBS Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Vernon Sandusky)\n\nA hotshot guitarist who grew up near Coffeyville, Kansas right on the border with Oklahoma, Vernon R. Sandusky (1939-2020) had a truly remarkable career, beginning when he was in high school and picking up steam throughout the 1950s, '60s and '70s. His first big gig was as lead guitarist for Bobby Poe & The Poe Kats, a group that became Wanda Jackson's backing band; soon after he formed a partnership with a guy named Johnny Dubas, working first as the country duo Johnny & Vernon, then forming the rock band The Chartbusters which supposedly was the inspiration for the greatest movie of all time, the Tom Hanks-directed documentary, That Thing You Do. In 1969 Vernon Sandusky joined Rodney Lay's Wild West, which later became the backing band for Hee Haw star Roy Clark, a gig that lasted over twenty years, including performances at the Hee Haw revue in the Roy Clark Theater in Branson, Missouri. He later retired to southern Kansas, where he played in a local gospel group as well as joining the cast of the Grand Grove Opry, located in Grove, Oklahoma. As far as I know this was his only solo album, recorded and self-released sometime in the early 1980s.\n\nGil Sandoval \"Long Road To Nashville\" (Westbend Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gil Sandoval & John Bonham)\n\nFrom Salt Lake City, Utah... and that's a long way from Nashville, my friends!\n\nSandy & The Sweetbriar Band \"Just The Beginning\" (Black Canyon Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Santo BamBoci & Roy Peters)\n\nTip Sanford & Friends \"Cotton Patch Pickin' \" (Bow Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by John Fletcher & Ken Pritchett)\n\nReal-deal, old-timey fiddling by Northport, Alabama's Floyd \"Tip\" Sanford, who competed and placed in numerous competitions in the South. He's backed here by locals Gordon Galbreath (guitar), A. D. Hammer (bass), Bryce Johnson (guitar), and Warren Sellers on mandolin. It's not clear whether he had a regular band, though Mr. Sanford was still competing in music contests as recently as 1999, although he is mentioned in his brother Ivy's 2003 obituary as having already passed away.\n\nSanta Fe \"Santa Fe\" (Ampex Records, 1971) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Herb Newman)\n\nA lively hippie-rock album, heavily influenced by the San Francisco sound, particularly the vocal high harmonies of the Grateful Dead and the Bay Area version of the new country-rock sound. Fans of the Dead -- and more particularly of their twangier cohorts, the New Riders Of The Purple Sage -- will find a lot to like in this album. Santa Fe definitely could rock out (by the standards of the day) although they stuck to the rougher, more bar-bandy end of the spectrum, with a thumpy, gallumphing rhythm and plenty of nasal twang. The songs are all originals, written solo or collaboratively by singer-guitarists Woody Minnich and Joe Saputo, with a couple also credited to lead guitarist Rob Riggs... And there's some fun stuff! This is a rough-edged record, but that's probably what makes it most appealing... Apparently Ampex relicensed the record to RCA -- my copy has the Ampex artwork, but I've seen pictures of the other version as well. Anyway, if you're looking for obscure proto- country rock, this disc is definitely worth tracking down. (BTW: anyone know more about these guys? I assumed they were desert dudes, but apparently they were Southern California kids... In the late '60s, Woody Minnick played guitar in a rock band called The Humane Society, which wound up on one of the early Nuggets albums... Other than that, I haven't learned much about these guys.)\n\nSanta Fe \"The Good Earth\" (RTV Records, 1972) (LP)\n\nSarah \"Breakin' Rules\" (Hub Records, 1987) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Summers)\n\nSarah Lou Vogt was a Southern California singer from Studio City, a Los Angeles suburb up in the hills... She recorded at least two albums of glossy, '80s-style pop-country with the backing of her husband, H. L. Vogt, who owned the Hub Records label. They made a real go of it, attending music industry industry gatherings, hiring a publicist and getting mentions in some of the trade publications, all at a time when the corporate model was starting to aggressively freeze out independent artists. On this first album, Sarah wrote all songs, though the next album had a mix of material. Unfortunately, neither record mentions the backing musicians, though they appear to have been recorded locally in LA, so any number of SoCal twangsters may have been involved.\n\nSarah \"Sarah, Too\" (Hub Records, 1988) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Summers)\n\nSaratoga \"What Tomorrow Brings\" (KBK Custom Records, 1976-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dave Hilgendorf & Jim Lake)\n\nA quintessential \"private\" album, made by two folks from Saint Louis -- Cindy Burger who sings and plays tambourine, and multi-instrumentalist Dave Hilgendorf (1947-2018) who did everything else. Seriously: he played bass, guitar, harmonica, tambourine and piano, as well as singing lead and harmony vocals. The repertoire is mostly cover songs, including a hefty dose of soft rock stuff, tunes like \"Danny's Song\" and \"Homeward Bound,\" though also country stuff like \"By The Time I Get To Phoenix.\" In the liner notes they thank another lounge duo, Burns & Bono, who they cite as their inspiration and who recorded their own LP a couple of years earlier, also at KBK Studios. Like a lot of Midwestern lounge bands in the 'Seventies, Saratoga incorporated more country material into their act, as seen on their second album, below.\n\nSaratoga \"By Special Request... Saratoga Live\" (KBK Custom Records, 1979-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dave Hilgendorf & Jim Lake)\n\nThis disc captures the duo live in concert at a checkered-tablecloth joint called Jacks Or Better, playing contemporary crowd pleasers and oldies such as \"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue,\" \"East Bound And Down\" and \"Six Days On The Road,\" as well as ballads like \"Love Me Tender\" and \"You've Got A Friend.\" They were joined for several songs by a guy named Russ Bono, who was in a more rock-oriented duo called Burns & Bono, with Mary Burns. Dave Hilgendorf later led a band called Those Guys, as well as a group called New Saratoga, which I assume had a different singer(?).\n\nSaratoga Red \"The Album\" (Blanco Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n\"Saratoga Red\" was the nom de twang of Texas country singer James Daniel (\"Dan\") Blanchard, who was formerly in the Pettigrew & Blanchard Band, a duo that played regionally around Dallas in the late '70s...\n\nDick Sargent \"...Sings I Kissed An Angel\" (Dana Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jack Logan)\n\nNot to be confused with the actor who played Darrin on the TV show Bewitched, this Dick Sargent was a young guy apparently from West Virginia, though recording on a label from Sandwich, Illinois, a small town just outside of Chicago... He was at least partly backed by his own local band -- drummer Robert Casdorph, saxophonist Ernie Dunlap, and Pat Miller on bass and piano -- though the sessions were recorded in Nashville, so a few uncredited studio pros are also likely. The title track, \"I Kissed An Angel,\" was his own original, while most of the album features cover songs such as \"Behind Closed Doors,\" \"Like Old Times Again,\" \"Proud Mary\" and \"Rhinestone Cowboy,\" with the last songs possibly dating this one to around 1975 or '76. The liner notes say that Sargent and Dunlap grew up together in West Virginia, and Dunlap also recorded a few singles and at least one album under his own name, specializing in country-flavored material, but also dipping into pop/jazz standards. (Nicknamed \"the double sax man,\" Dunlap did some Rashaan Roland Kirk-style trick playing, blowing two saxes at the same time...)\n\nJunior Sasnett & The Tennessee Ramblers \"Saviors Hand Holding Mine #2\" (Junior Sasnett Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Junior Sasnett)\n\nAccording to the liner notes, Junior Sasnett was born and raised in Brent, Florida and was living in Las Vegas when he cut this disc. As a teenager he played guitar in a traveling tent revival show, though later when he formed a band with his siblings, he played and wrote secular honky-tonk music. Sasnett made his way out west to LA, where he worked odd jobs and finally moved to Las Vegas where he played a few country bars and self-released at least three albums of very twangy gospel material. (This appears to have been his first record, although the title is confusing: the \"number two\" is part of one song's name, while a small note in the corner says this is \"volume one\" of a series. Backing Sasnett is a group including Drake Day on drums, Dusty Henson (bass), Emmett Jones (mandolin), Ned Ketchum (accordion), Ray Kiper (guitar), Loyd Lass (steel guitar) and Buddy Streight on fiddle. These guys were a mix of young'uns and old-timers from all over the country... Several of guys were from California, including the son of fabled Bakersfield TV host Cousin Herb Henson, bassist Keith \"Dusty\" Henson (1953-2017), who tragically was paralyzed in an accidental shooting in 1982 but previously led a Vegas-based group called the Back Porch County Band.\n\nJunior Sasnett & The Tennessee Ramblers \"Volume Two: The Bus Drivin' Blues\" (Junior Sasnett Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Junior Sasnett)\n\nIncluding the title track, about half the songs on here are Sasnett originals, paired up with a bunch more Hank Williams covers and a version of Jimmie Davis's \"You Are My Sunshine.\" Unfortunately the musicians backing him aren't identified, although the liner notes do give us some more biographical detail about Mr. Sasnett's younger days and the two years he spent as part of Rev. Billy McGee's tent revival show, and also informs us that one of the three albums he put out in the late 'Seventies was actually a reissue of earlier material.\n\nJunior Sasnett & The Tennessee Ramblers \"Good Old Gospel Time, Volume III\" (Junior Sasnett Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Junior Sasnett)\n\nAll but four of the songs on here are Hank Williams covers while the others are gospel and country gospel standards such as \"Where Could I Go But To The Lord\" and \"Life's Railway To Heaven.\" Sasnett apparently released a few hard-country singles in his youth, though I don't know if they've been gathered or reissued anywhere.\n\nLarry Sasser \"Sassy Country\" (Step One Records, 1990) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Kevin McManus, Ray Pennington & Larry Sasser)\n\nOriginally from Georgia, steel player Larry Sasser worked in Nashville as a session player and, like all good steel guitarists, when the chance arose, he cut his own instrumental album. Plenty of Nashville pickers on this one -- Hoot Hester, Bunky Keels, Fred Newell and others -- and a nice mix of standards and originals, including the opening track, \"Sassy Frassin,\" along with three others penned by Sasser. It's possible this was his only full album, though he played on quite a few albums by other folks.\n\nRonnie Satterfield \"All Alone\" (JJ Records, 1985) (LP)\n\n(Produced by James Tuttle & Stephen J. Mendell)\n\nA demo album by singer-guitarist Ronnie Satterfield, whose day job was as an entertainer on Carnival Cruise Line ship... This set, which was recorded at Cedar Creek Studios, in Austin, Texas, is standard lounge fare, mostly covers of AOR and country-ish hits that were doubtless crowd pleasers: \"Margaritaville,\" Don McLean's \"American Pie,\" Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless America,\" as well as stuff by Dan Fogelberg and Kenny Loggins... There are also three songs written by Satterfield: \"All Alone,\" \"Back To Carolina\" and \"If I Only Had A Girl Like You\" and another original, Chris Kingley's \"Who'da Believe,\" using the same publisher (Texas Crude Publishing). The studio crew include musicians such as steel guitarist Jimmy Day, fiddler Johnny Gimble, Stephen Mendell on bass, as well as Lonnie Mack and Ronnie Satterfield playing guitar.\n\nSavanna \"Straight At The Sun\" (Adventure Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Steve Escallier & Savanna)\n\nThis one might be added more as a warning than a recommendation. Yeah, I guess there is some legitimate country-rock twang on a few tunes, and kind of a rural vibe underneath a lot of these songs, but mostly this Oklahoma trio was more on a '70s soft-rock meets starry-eyed folk trajectory. Several songs are pretty gooey and mildly insufferable, though others have some country-ish vigor, so it's kind of a tossup whether to include this one here or not. Probably appeals more to fans of Stevie Nicks and Seals & Crofts than to twangsters, but it's probably worth having on the radar, especially if you're scouring the Midwest for obscure entries into the country-rock annals.\n\nSavannah \"Breakin' My Heart\" (Savannah Productions, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dick Butler)\n\nRoosevelt Savannah \"Everything's Coming Up Rosey\" (Roseway International, 1976-?) (LP)\n\nOne of the notable African American country singers to come in the wake of Charley Pride's national success, Roosevelt Savannah hailed from Seattle, Washington and recorded his lone LP at the fabled Ripcord studios in nearby Vancouver, WA. He had cut a few singles earlier, including an early version of \"Pretty Girl, Pretty Clothes, Pretty Sad\" on the semi-major GRC label, but chart success wasn't in the stars, although he really plugged away for a few years in the early '70s. This album is mostly made up of cover tunes, including some gospel and stuff by Marty Robbins and Hank Williams. There's also another version of \"Pretty Girl, Pretty Clothes,\" as well as one called \"The House I Live In (That's America To Me),\" a patriotic number that might place this (undated) album as a Bicentennial release.\n\nBob Saver \"...Sings From The Hills Of Home\" (Arzee Records, 1976-?) (LP)\n\nRecording for Pennsylvania cowpoke Rex Zario's independent Arzee label, Bobby Saver initially took on a rock'n'roll persona, recording some good old, greasy, sloppy teenybopper garage rock as \"Count Drac,\" back in the mid-1960s. A decade or so later he was in a country mode -- singing, yes, but perhaps more importantly playing some plangent, echo-y electric guitar, in a vaguely surfin' mode, despite the rural-sounding album title. Although his more rock-oriented recordings been anthologized on several collector-label reissues, there doesn't seem to be much biographical info about Mr. Saver out there... Presumably he was from Philly, since the Arzee label was fairly hyper-local, but other than that, a bit of a mystery\n\nGrizz Sawbuck \"Meet The Mountain Man: Grizz Sawbuck Sings One More Memory\" (Simbuck Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Sims & Sawbuck)\n\nThis strapping young fella from Hebron, Ohio lays it on pretty thick, what with his beaver-fur cap, buckskin jacket and boots -- a whole Daniel Boone vibe which is only mildly undercut by how new and clean everything looks. But if that's really his own big, bushy beard, well then more power to him! This was apparently the nom du frontier of Ohio country singer Edward Daniel Adams (1947-2013) who was kin to a whole slew of country music Adamses, including Arnie Adams, Darrell Adams, Farrell Adams, Gary Adams and most notably solo artist Don Adams, a bunch of brothers who had a hometown band called The Boys and who functioned as George Jones' tour band at various times, as well as backing Johnny Paycheck and various other Nashville stars. Anyway, \"Grizz\" was their cousin, and at the time of this album's release he claimed twenty years experience in the country music scene. This album is interesting for its selection of \"deep cuts,\" relatively obscure songs from the likes of Buck Owens, Ray Pennington, Billy Sherrill and others that are pretty far from the standard-issue chart-toppers that populate most cover-song albums. Unfortunately, there's no info about the backing musicians; the only clue about who he was hanging out with when he cut this album is the last name of his co-producer, Sims, which still leaves a lot to learned. For many years, Adams worked for Little Jimmy Dickens and appears to have moved to Nashville after cutting this album; he is said to have been buried at Woodlawn Memorial Park, right near George Jones.\n\nSawmill Creek -- see artist profile\n\nRay Sawyer \"Ray Sawyer\" (Capitol Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ron Haffkine)\n\nThis is one of those only-in-the-Seventies, off-the-radar albums that has about a zillion-to-zero chance of ever being reissued... In this case it's not because it's a golden gem that the Nashville fatcats were too lame to appreciate, but really because this is a third-string production, with some Nashville studio dudes backing up Ray Sawyer -- the eye-patched frontman of the rock band Dr. Hook -- providing lush, oversized arrangements to his thin-voiced, almost whiny performance. There is some interesting stuff on here, though. mainly a handful of well-sculpted Hazel Smith songs that include the issue-oriented \"Crazy Rosie\" (about a teen pregnancy that results in the baby being murdered by its uptight, status-obsessed grandfather, which in turn drives the mother insane...) Equally over-the-top is \"(One More Year Of) Daddy's Little Girl,\" wherein a small child is dying from an undisclosed terminal illness... and her daddy tries to enjoy her final days... The other primary songwriter here is someone named Joel Jaffe, who I've never heard of. Mostly Jaffe's stuff doesn't do much for me, though \"Maybe I Can Use That In A Song\" is a nice slow, sad shuffle. This ain't great, but it has its moments.\n\nShane Sawyer \"Send Me All Your Coors\" (C.A.S. Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by B. J. Cornwell)\n\nSongwriter Shane Sawyer did some time in Nashville, moving there in the late 1960s before decamping to Texas, where he established himself in the Dallas country scene. Sawyer had some kind of deal with Mel Tillis' production company and was pitching himself as an outlaw at the time this album came out. According to his Facebook page, Sawyer wrote over three hundred songs, with several recorded by noteworthy artists, including Merle Haggard, Alan Jackson, Floyd Tillman and Whitney Houston(!). He also seems to have dipped his toes into the southern gospel scene, working with artists such as The Blackwood Brothers, Lulu Roman and Naomi Sego... (I haven't tracked down any of these song credits, so for now we'll just have to take his word for it... ) A Coors-themed single was also released from this album, though I'm not sure what other records Sawyer has to his name...\n\nRocky Saxon \"Butterfly Dreamin' \" (Banner Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Triche & Rocky Saxon)\n\nJim Sayre \"From My Heart To Yours\" (Revelation Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Olszewski)\n\nA folk-country auteur from Zanesville, Ohio, songwriter Jim Sayre was born blind and devoted his professional career to helping others. He got an advanced degree in vocational rehabilitation counseling in 1969, and worked for a variety of private charities and state-sponsored agencies, mostly targeted at helping people with visual impairments. According to the liner notes, Mr. Sayre began singing in public at age two, and played a variety of instruments, including drums, guitar, clarinet and saxophone. He wrote all but two of the songs on this album, including a couple that seem autobiographical, \"Blindness Of The Mind\" and \"They're Laughing At Me,\" as well as some regionally-themed numbers, \"My Heaven On Earth\" and \"Muskingum Roll On,\" written about the Muskingum River, which is pictured on the front cover in an aerial photograph showing the confluence of the Muskingum and Licking River, where the Y-Bridge spans both rivers. The front cover tells us that Sayre wrote the songs on this album while inspired by the Muskingum, though it's not the sole focus of the album. In addition to his own songs, he also covers Kris Kristofferson's \"Why Me Lord,\" and a medley of patriotic tunes, \"America The Beautiful\" and \"God Bless America.\" Backing him are local musicians Larry Cook (bass), Harold Fogle (pedal steel), Amos Searan (guitars), who all did session work for regional labels, including the Appalachian Sound Studio in Chillicothe, where this was recorded; the studio's owner, singer-songwriter Joe Waters, also adds a brief liner note praising Sayre's work.\n\nRocky Saxon \"Butterfly Dreamin' \" (Banner Records, 1983-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Richard Reames, Rocky Saxon & Bill Triche)\n\nColor me very skeptical. I mean, sure, these guys look all leather-vest wearin' Waylon-esque and everything, but what country musician other than Dolly Parton is going to make a record with the word \"butterfly\" in the title? On the other hand, this does have some pedal steel, and songs like \"Sand Dollar Dancin',\" and \"Time For The Cowboy To Go Home,\" so maybe I shouldn't judge a disc by its cover. Apparently this project involved singer Rocky Saxon putting to music the poems of a fella named Richard Reames, with Saxon playing guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone, backed by a band that included Larry Capello (guitar), Jerry Decker (bass), Joey Farris (drums), Art Mitchell, (banjo), Randy Russell (guitar), Royce Tarver on steel guitar, and others. Saxon had been a figure on the Baton Rouge pop and rock scene for many years, leading a band called the Pharohs way back in the early 'Sixties, and was still doing local events as recently as early 2023(!)\n\nBeth Scalet \"It's A Living\" (J-Bird, 1981)\n\n(Produced by Beth Scalet, Chris Bauer & Caren Prideaux)\n\nA veteran folk singer from Lawrence, Kansas, Beth Scalet (1948-2014) performed extensively in the 1970s before recording this early '80s album. There's some subtle, pedal steel-propelled twang on here, but mostly this is soft, soulful bluesy pop, reminiscent of Phoebe Snow or a slicker-sounding Tracy Nelson, more of an adult-alt kinda thing in a mellow, poppish mode. Includes a cover of Procol Harum's \"Whiter Shade Of Pale,\" but otherwise it's all original material.\n\nKate Scates \"From Katie With Love\" (Oak Leaf Records, 1972-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by John Taylor)\n\nI'm not sure where Kate Scates was from, but this set was produced at Handy Recording Studio in Knoxville, Tennessee, with backing from Luke Brandon (guitar), Jack Cate (bass), Chet Hedecoat (drums), Bob Oakes (piano), Jerry Moore (fiddle), Ed Wing (rhythm guitar). Ms. Scates seems to have been a guitarist, pictured on the back with a twelve-string, which may indicate some kind of folk music background. The set list is pretty diverse, with covers of early 'Seventies country-pop standards such as \"Snow Bird\" and \"For The Good Times,\" as well as a pair of John Denver tunes (\"Country Roads\" and \"Follow Me\") as well as a couple by Carole King. Anyone know more about this gal?\n\nLarry Schacher & Melody Funk \"First Time Out\" (Ripcord Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Blaine Allen & Gene Breeden)\n\nNot totally a country album, but it came out on Ripcord Records, so that's reason enough to keep it on the radar. Aside from a Randy Newman song and a couple of Harold Arlen covers, this album is mostly original material written by either Larry A. Schacher or Melody F. Funk (with several songs co-written by Eric Funk). Mr. Schacher appears to have grown up in tiny, rural La Grande, Oregon while Ms. Funk may have been from Enumclaw, Washington, though at some point they were drawn into the orbit of metropolitan SeaTac... Larry Schacher became a Christian music artist, though this is a secular set, with Eric Funk on bass and drums, Melody Funk on vocals and bass, Larry Schacher playing piano (and a couple fo other instruments), producer Gene Breeden chiming in on guitar and a few other friends and relations such as Fred Schacher, who adds a few banjo riffs. Not sure if this couple played live shows, but if I get more information, I'll let you know.\n\nRon Schmeck \"Easy Living -- The American Way\" (Valley Records, 197?) (LP)\n\nThere's an entire album devoted to the joys of RVs? Yes, sirree! You bet there is! Ron Schmeck was a car dealer from Sacramento, California who was so fired up about mobile homes that he wrote and recorded a whole album's worth of songs on the subject. Well, okay, there are a couple of songs on other topics, like how mobile home drivers made great Good Samaritans (Schmeck was also a member of the Good Sam club) but mostly this is a sincere song of praise for living the free life on the road. The musical end was actually pretty good -- Schmeck also hosted a local country TV show (called \"The Easy Life\") and though he wasn't a very good singer, he got some decent talent to back him up here -- an iffy lead guitarist, but good pedal steel and a solid piano player and rhythm section, pumping out music that was solidly in the uptempo West Coast style. You probably won't need to listen to this disc all that often, but it's a funny, genuine oddity, for sure. By the way, anyone know more about these sessions, or even what year the record came out? I tried finding out online, but no one seems willing to post a specific date. I'm guess 1976-ish...(?)\n\nJohn Schmid \"With Love\" (Operation Appreciation, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Ernspiker)\n\nA half-country, half contemporary Christian album, recorded by a guy from Louisville, Kentucky as part of something called \"Operation Outreach,\" which had a mission statement about showing support for the folks in the armed forces. The project seems to have been sponsored by Asbury University, a private Wesleyan religious school where Mr. Schmid was enrolled. Side One of the album features covers of classics such as \"The Auctioneer,\" \"City Of New Orleans\" and \"I've Been Everywhere,\" while Side Two is gospel music, and looks like mostly original material, though there are no songwriter credits to be found. The other musicians included pianist Ronn Bredenbaugh, Jack Brengle (guitar), Duke Marsh (bass), and Dave Maxwell on drums; presumable they were all Asbury students as well.\n\nLee Schmidt \"Saturday Night, Sunday Morning\" (Alert Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Merl Olds)\n\nLee Schmidt (1930-2013) was a farm kid from rural Missouri who made his name in the Saint Louis country nightclub scene, but it was as a square dance caller that he would become known nationally... On his non-squaredance debut he picked some unusual selections (like Harlan Howard's \"Too Many Rivers To Cross\") and following the Saturday sinner/Sunday saint motif, he sang a bunch of gospel standards, in a Red Foley-esque style. Schmidt only penned one of these songs, \"Lonesome Too,\" but I think there were a couple other songs from local artists. Prior to this, Schmidt was mostly known for doing square dance records; this was his first album of straight-up country songs.\n\nLee Schmidt \"I'll Come Back As Many Times As You Need Me\" (Marilee Records, 1974)\n\nNeal Schmidt \"Dreamer's Paradise\" (Trick Horseman Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rue Barclay & Hal Southern)\n\nGreat album art. On the front, there's Mr. Schmidt, riding \"Roman style,\" astride two separate horses, spinning his lasso and smiling from ear to ear; on the back cover you can see him jumping his horse through a ring of fire, and an action shot of the two-horse trick being performed at a rodeo. A trick rider from Crawford, Oklahoma, Neal Schmidt built his reputation in the 1960s and '70s working the rodeo circuit throughout the South, the Midwest and the mountain states. One year his wife Eileen packed him off to LA, where he recorded this album with old-school singing cowboy Hal Southern and a Hollywood studio band that included Joe Dennis on drums, Harold Hensley (fiddle), Roy Lanham (guitar), Junior Nichols (drums), Gene Ridgeway (bass) and Doug Vaughn (steel guitar). The set includes a few cowboy oldies, such as \"Back In Saddle Again\" and Jack Guthrie's \"Oklahoma Hills,\" though it's pleasantly heavy on newer material, including a couple of originals by Allen Johnson, \"Footprints,\" and the title track, \"Dreamer's Paradise.\" I'm not sure if Mr. Schmidt made any other records, but this one's a doozy.\n\nPaul Schmucker \"Rainy Days And Rainbows\" (Star Fox Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Troy Shondell & Paul Huliba)\n\nA very-independent album recorded at Star Fox Studios in Fort Wayne, Indiana.. The liner notes inform us that singer Paul Schmucker was raised in a traditional Amish community, without worldly distractions such as radio and TV, so where he got his love of country music is anyone's guess. This seems to have been a songwriter's demo set with all the songs published by producer Troy Shondell, a former teen idol who also took composer credit on over half the songs. The studio musicians, alas, were uncredited, although backup singer Joanie Dolson gets a mention, and Mr. Shondell's songwriting partner George Weber is credited for his \"special musical assistance,\" and presumably played n the sessions. Other than that, this is a real mystery disc. Also: inquiring minds want to know if this album was the product of Mr. Schmucker's rumspringa -- the period when Amish youth get to go out in the secular world and test their religious faith? If so, who did he give copies of the record to, if all the folks back home were still abstaining from electricity? Just asking.\n\nJack Schorn \"Jack Schorn's Country Show\" (1979-?) (LP)\n\nA delightfully, deliciously amateurish album by a clompy trio from River Falls, Wisconsin, this is the very epitome of a vanity album... and I mean that in a good way. I'm guessing their \"country show\" mostly played in various bandmembers basements and rec rooms, but apparently Schorn was from a musically-inclined family and had played local gigs with his siblings for many years before this late '70s album came out. He's backed by bassist Tom Gardner and Mike Kullman on drums; the liner notes say Kullman had played with Schorn since 1968. This is a goofy but heartfelt record, packed with cheerful but lackluster renditions of the band's favorite country songs. Fun tunes, too: it's always nice to hear tunes like Billy Joe Shaver's \"Georgia On A Fast Train,\" Wayne Carson's \"Drinkin' Thing,\" or Ronnie Milsap's \"Day Dreams (About Night Things)\" and oh my gosh, who can resist a few wannabee good ol' boys singing \"Afternoon Delight\"? Not me. And of course they cover \"Up Against The Wall, Redneck Mother...\" (Man, was that song popular!) Okay, I admit it... I'm totally kitsched-out on this one, and in a way that I normally resist, but I just can't help it. This is just such an endearingly flawed, honest album -- it really is just three dudes singing a few groovy tunes they like, thumping away down in someone's basement studio, with iffy vocals and modest instrumental heft. The sound is stripped down and strictly non-professional, and real. Really, really real.\n\nBill Schott \"Country Fever\" (Sentry One Records, 1985-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Schott & Mick McTee)\n\nThis handsome young fella from Aberdeen, South Dakota kinda reminds me of someone... Let's just flip the record over to the back cover and -- oh, yeahhhh...!! -- Man, he sure looks like Elvis! And sure enough, that was Bill Schott's claim to fame: starting around 1980, he worked steadily as an Elvis imitator, apparently working regional venues and entering numerous Elvis-a-like competitions. This croony country set ends with a Presley tribute track, though the rest of the tracks draw from many other sources, with countrypolitan ballads, some George Jones material, a little \"Green, Green Grass Of Home...\" Recorded at a studio in Saint Cloud, Minnesota, this features backing by Barry Carlin on keyboards, Scott Tait (bass) and Scott Wenner (steel guitar), backing vocals by Tammy Carroll, Cindy Johnson and Pam Quance, and a lead guitarist named John Hammond, who might have been the fabled blues/folk picker doing some session work, or maybe just another guy with the same name. As far as I know, this is Mr. Schott's only album, though he has led several bands over the years, including the Fuzzy Dice and the Beachcombers, so he may have self-released a CD or two.\n\nJoe Schultz & The Journeymen \"Statue Of A Fool\" (IGL Records, 1972-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Denny Kintzi & John Senn)\n\nThis is the first album by a Minnesota-based trio that included bassist/lead singer Joe Schultz, steel player Stan Horswell and longhaired drummer Orv Buttrey Jr. (who wasn't related to Nashville superdrummer Kenny Buttrey, as far as I know...) They made the trek to the legendary IGL label, located in Milford, Iowa -- best known for recording garage bands in the '60s and early '70s -- and recorded this set of country covers, which included versions of Mel Street's 1970 hit, \"Borrowed Angel\" and Freddie Hart's \"Easy Lovin',\" which points to a 1971-72 release date. These guys were a little clunky, but it's still fun to hear another \"real folks\" album -- some of the tracks have a rawer, slightly garage-rock feel: possibly they were earlier recordings, or even singles on IGL? I'll update you if I ever find out for sure...\n\nJoe Schultz & The Journeymen \"Tears Falling From My Eyes\" (IGL Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nTex Schutz \"Keepin' It Country\" (Red Dog Country Music, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Blake Etheridge & Frank Green)\n\nThis was the first album from multi-instrumentalist Richard L. (Tex) Schutz and his wife, vocalist Mary Neal Schutz, who at the time were living in Bennett, Nebraska, just outside of Lincoln. Though recorded in Nashville, this seems to feature their own band backing them or at least a bunch of lesser-known session players. Mr. Schutz plays lead guitar, along with Alex Austin on drums, Karl Brandt (bass), Ben Cowling (guitar), Frank Green (bass), Tim Murphy (fiddle and piano), Doug Sullivan (drums), and Bob Tripp playing dobro. A lot of cover songs on there, including \"Green, Green Grass Of Home\" and \"Today I Started Loving You Again,\" though the album kicks off with a Tex Schutz original, \"Put the Country Back in the Music,\" (a novelty number built around the great couplet, \"Put the country back in the music/Put the rock back in the ground\"); a second song, \"Forty Miles Of Bad Road\" is also credited to Mr. Schutz, although it's a pretty old theme. The Schutzes founded a couple of music festivals, the first being held at their own Prairieland Park venue in Firth, Nebraska, from 1988-97, when they closed the auditorium. They also founded a second traditionally-oriented country music concert called the \"Miles Of Memories Country MusicFest & RV Rally,\" held annually in Hastings, Nebraska for twelve years up until 2015, when Mr. Schutz had to retire due to health issues. At some point, they moved to Streetman, Texas, and took their Red Dog label with them, recording well over a dozen albums together, giving their final concert together for fans in Nebraska in 2014.\n\nScissors Band \"You Make My Dreams Come True\" (Brylen Records, 1982) (LP)\n\nAlthough the Brylen label had some chart success in the early-'80s, during the last gasp of country indies, this band from Signal Mountain, Georgia seems to have slipped between the cracks. Nothing charted from this covers-heavy LP, featuring lead singer Dave Cacrino on songs like \"Fancy Free,\" and \"Old Flame.\" Try as I might, I couldn't find much info on these guys. Anyone?\n\nBill Scott \"For My Friends\" (Audio By DeVir, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by J. Frederic DeVir)\n\nA young guy doing covers of oldies, stuff like Bob McDill's \"Amanda,\" an old Jim Reeves ballad, and even some Depression-era tunes by Jenny Lou Carson and the Carter Family. There were also some originals, including \"When You're As Lonely As I\" and \"Home To Stay.\" This album was recorded in Saint Paul, Minnesota with backing from an all-local crew. Notable among the musicians are Tom Elliott on bass and Honey Lou singing backup vocals -- this husband-wife duo also recorded an album of their own a few years earlier -- with fiddle by Wayne Kreidler and steel guitar by Larry Rose and Art Douvier.\n\nBob Scott \"At Leah's Gate 2\" (Blue Chip Records, 196--?) (LP)\n\nWell, my bad. I assumed this was the same as gospel guitarist Bob Scott Frick (who also recorded as \"Bob Scott\") though this appears in fact to be a latter day pop-vocals crooner from LA who does a more-than-passable imitation of Bing Crosby, with a slight hint of Dean Martin in the mix. Although he does sing a couple of fully legit country tunes -- \"Red Roses For A Blue Lady\" and \"Send Me The Pillow That You Dream On\" -- the rest of the record is pure Squaresville pop, with a little hint of tad-jazz dixie in there as well. He's joined on these nominally live performances by drummer Chuck Ault, saxophonist Mike Chase, organist Bob Wetherbee and Ric Vallese, a reputable West Coast trumpet player who worked with Dave Cavanaugh, Jack Teagarden, George Van Eps and many others. The same basic combo backed Scott on the \"more\" album below. Though there's no remaining trace of it physically or online, Leah's Gate 2 appears to have been a nightclub/lounge in Inglewood, California; according to this album's liner notes, Bob Scott had been playing there \"nitely\" for eight years prior to recording this album.\n\nBob Scott \"More Leah's Gate 2\" (Blue Chip Records, 196--?) (LP)\n\nSame formula as on the album above: low-intensity Bing Crosby-style crooning, with a few country tunes in the mix, though not much stylistic variety in the performances. He covers \"Bumming Around\" and \"Are You Lonesome Tonight,\" as well as \"Melancholy Baby\" and several other nondescript pop tunes. Same band as above, with the addition of sax player Artie Lyons. I guess this is just one of those I-took-one-for-the-team reviews; nothing special here, really.\n\nCharlie Scott \"Lawman\" (1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Cal Miller & Jim Rhodes)\n\nCops do love to make country albums... Or, at least, some of the cops who do make 'em love to talk about it! Charlie Scott (1957-2009) is notable for having written half the songs on this album (which includes several other originals, not just his stuff...) Also, check him out on the back cover -- the dude was ready for his own TV show! The weird thing is, though, he didn't actually tell us where he's from. Lots of info about the Nashville recording sessions, but no address or anything... Well, Scott did credit Sgt. Randy Orondorff for the album design, so that got me started... Turns out Orondorff was a thirty-plus year veteran of the Tulsa PD, and an instructor at their academy, so I put two-to-five together and figured out that Scott was on the Tulsa PD as well... Sure enough, that's the guy. In addition to his job on the force, Scott was a major player on Oklahoma's early '80s country scene, headlining a place called Duke's Country and penning the song \"Oklahoma Rain,\" which became a regional hit. He later placed a couple of singles into the Country Back Forty, but that was about it as far as breaking through nationally. Apparently the Tulsa police chief demanded Scott choose between traffic stops and twang, so he ditched his squad car for a dive bar, opening a place called Charlie's Bus Stop in nearby Skiatook. He ran the bar for a year or two, then went back into law enforcement, working as a parole officer in the state corrections department. This album includes the song \"She Loves Me Most Of All,\" which was released as a single, as well as his version of the Marty Robbins oldie, \"Big Iron.\"\n\nCharlie Scott \"The Man In Blue\" (NSD Records, 1986) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jimmy Payne)\n\nOn his second album, Scott recorded the first half in Nashville, and the second side in Tulsa, with help from producer Jimmy Payne, who also steered a couple of tunes his way, including his own \"What Time Is It In Your World (When It's Crying Time In Mine)?\" and one called \"Ugly Women And Pickup Trucks,\" which rounds out the album. Other than a cover of Sammy Johns' old hit, \"Chevy Van\" and Keith Durham's regional pride number, \"Blue Skies Over Tulsa,\" all the other tracks were written by Charlie Scott. Sadly not included is his 1984 single, \"Maybe I'm Crazy,\" a tune written by Bill Caswell that got some traction regionally but seems to have slipped through the cracks between albums. Caswell also wrote the title track to Scott's 1989 4-song cassette EP, Someone To Care, which may have been Mr. Scott's last official recording.\n\nClive Scott & The Skywegians \"Best Of Country And Western\" (Deacon Records, 1970) (LP)\n\nA fun set of authentic-sounding Euro-British pub-country... Clive Scott was apparently an English expat who grew up in England and in Malaysia, and wound up marrying a Norwegian gal and moving to Norway. This band, which was made up of Clive Scott, his daughter Claudia Scott and a whole slew of Scandinavians, had been touring the UK for a couple of years by the time this album came out, and thus found a London label to record with. And it's pretty good. A strong, thumping beat, plenty of twang, good song selection (Johnny Cash, George Jones, Buck Owens) and a nice, upbeat vibe... Methinks this is an accurate reflection of what '60s country bands sounded like in the pubs -- pleasantly rough around the edges, but also played with confidence and authority. Recommended!\n\nDarrell Scott \"Darrell Scott\" (Ky-O-Te Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Wayne Scott)\n\nIt's funny: I didn't recognize the names at first, but Darrell Scott and his father Wayne have been on my radar for years. Multi-instrumentalist Darrell Scott rose up through the ranks of the 1990s \"Americana\" scene and recorded several CD-era albums I enjoyed, notably working with bluegrasser Tim O'Brien, and also had a great career as a Nashville songwriter, penning a string of successful hits for folks like the Dixie Chicks, Sara Evans and Brad Paisley, and others. In 2005 he shone a light on his dad, Wayne Scott, producing an album called This Weary Way, an understated gem that included guest appearances by Guy Clark, Verlon Thompson, and Dirk Powell, which gives a sense of the class of musicians they were hanging out with. Turns out this was not their first rodeo, and that years earlier the father-son duo had released at least two albums, sometime in the '80s, from the looks of it.\n\nDewitt Scott \"Keepin' It Country (Almost)\" (Mid-Land Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rusty Thornhill)\n\nA steel guitarist from Midland, Missouri, Dewitt Scott also worked as a producer for several albums of other steel players, including Zane Beck, Julian Tharpe, Curly Chalker, and others. On this album he's backed by Doug Jernigan (playing dobro), Lloyd Green, Tharpe, Chalker, Buddy Emmons, and Russ Hicks... As implied by the title, most of these tracks are country, stuff like \"Drivin' Nails In My Coffin\" and \"Cold, Cold Heart,\" but a few are old pop standards, such as \"Golden Earrings,\" \"Harbor Lights\" and \"Misty.\"\n\nHelen Scott & Billy Scott \"Songs You've Requested\" (Chance Records, 1967-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dean Richards)\n\nA thoroughly charming album from a husband-wife duo, neither of whom were particularly strong vocalists, but they really put their hearts into it. Originally from Indiana, the Scotts established themselves as a country duo in Columbus, Ohio, performing on the Jamboree USA radio program and the syndicated Hayride TV show... This album has a bunch of cover songs on the softer side of things, including contemporary country songs like \"There Goes My Everything\" and \"Tippy Toeing,\" as well as perky, twanged-up versions of two folk hits, \"Pack Up Your Sorrows\" and Tom Paxton' \"Last Thing On my Mind.\" A couple of songs may have been originals -- \"Demolition Derby\" and \"The Ego Of My Mind,\" though I couldn't find any songwriter's credits. Musicians include steel player Chuck Rich and electric guitarist Wally Proctor, who add lots of fun, bouncy, '60s-style pop-country twang. I couldn't track down the year this came out, but would definitely appreciate any info folks could share... (\"Tippy Toeing\" was a hit in 1967, so it's sometime around then...) Anyway, I honestly find them completely charming -- kind of a lower-tier version of folks like Jonie & Johnny Mosby, or even earlier forebearers such as Texas Ruby & Curly Fox. Plus she yodeled... in 1967! How cute is that??\n\nHelen & Billy Scott \"My God And I\" (Jewel Records, 1976) (LP)\n\nHelen & Billy Scott \"Good Times\" (Jewel Records, 197-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Rusty York)\n\nThis one's definitely much later -- they cover \"Help Me Make It Through The Night,\" \"Rose Garden\" and \"Bobby McGee,\" so maybe '73, '74 or so? Anyway, it's hard to know what to make of this one, especially given my enthusiasm for their earlier work in the 'Sixties. To put it simply, this really isn't a very good record, or to be more precise, the vocals are pretty bad. Now, I'm not a guy who's big on the whole snarky, cynical, make-fun-of-bad-records thing, but I think it's fair to say that this is the kind of album that can give you an appreciation for the quality level of other private-label records, because, yes, sometimes they do sound like this. On this disc, the (unidentified) backing band play quite well, and were presumably some of the best session players in Rusty York's orbit -- their arrangement of \"Rose Garden\" closely mimics the Lynn Anderson original, and generates an impressively large sound for a small regional studio. But the Scotts themselves are off their game -- Billy Scott comes through as an understated average-guy vocalist, but Helen Scott is horribly off-key for most of the record, and sounds like somebody's grandma who got drafted to do a memento album for the kids. I'm not sure what the deal was, but while I honestly enjoyed their earlier album, I found this one pretty painful. Cynics looking for mockable, Mrs. Miller-ish records in the country field may delight in this disc... I'm just gonna file it away for future reference.\n\nHugh Scott \"Sings Country At The Chamberland Club\" (Banff Records, 1967) (LP)\n\nMixing old, old-school country, honky-tonk and rockabilly, in the late 1960s Ottawa, Canada's Hugh Scott led the house band at the Chamberland Club, as heard on this live recording. There's some stuff you've heard elsewhere, and some that maybe you haven't, songs like \"Don't Let Her Get The Best Of You,\" \"You're The Least Of My Worries,\" \"Sea Of Booze\" and \"After You Leave.\" Scott's compact band included bassist Marcel Amyot and Wilf Arsenault on lead guitar. Nice stuff, although I wasn't able to find much information about Scott online...\n\nHugh Scott \"Mr. Versatile\" (Banff Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nHugh Scott \"Now... And Then\" (Snocan Records, 1979-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Barry Brown, David Dennison & Ralph Carlson)\n\nA good-natured honkytonk-meets-rockabilly set, remincent of the more robust offerings of guys like Roy Head and Joe Stampley, with one foot in the world of rock, but a full commitment to country twang. The album includes a fun version of Dick Damron's \"Good Old Timey Country Rock'N'Roll,\" sort of a statement of purpose, along with various cover songs, including a couple of old Elvis Presley hits. Three songs are Hugh Scott originals: \"Here I Am,\" Behind These Lonely Prison Walls\" and the forlorn, sad-sack \"I'll Give My Heart (To Anyone Who Wants It).\" Not sure when this one came out, though I'm guessing 1979 from his groovy 'Seventies get-up on the cover, and by the album's matrix number (WRC1-79-1). The sessions were recorded at Snocan Studios in Ottowa, with Bob Boucher on lead guitar, Al Bragg on piano and pedal steel, Al Cherney on fiddle, and several other local players. Nice, low-key outing by a veteran player who was still having fun.\n\nJerry Scott \"I Feel Love For You\" (Alpha Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jerry Scott)\n\nThis one is more of a friendly warning... Private press? Yes, very. Country? Mmmmaybe not so much... While there is a southern-rural, Tony Joe White-ish kind of vibe, this has more of a weird AOR/soul/roots feel... Very 'Seventies and kind of like a white guy doing a Bill Withers impersonation... While twangfans can probably skip it, this album is exactly the sort of spacey, self-indulgent, over the top vanity project that people are looking for in the private-press-o-sphere, and also may have been one of those \"tax scam\" write-off records that music bloggers love to talk about. The album art certainly supports this theory, as there is no label address, no producer info, and alas, no information about the musicians backing Mr. Scott, although they do sound pretty competent. There's no concrete info about Jerry Scott, either, although one song is entitled \"Louisiana, I'm Coming Home,\" so, okay, maybe he was from down there, maybe not. Also, all of the tracks are original material, with most songs co-written with a person identified only as \"E. Martin,\" and thank goodness for the Library of Congress copyright office, which informs us that Martin's real name was Edwin Martin Fruge, and that he was also credited with arranging several songs, while Jerry Scott is revealed to be a pseudonym for Gerald Lee Dubon, with one other co-writer, David McBane, credited on a song called \"Loving You Is All I Need.\" So hurray! Mystery solved, right? Well, not quite: I just had to keep scratching and as it turns out, there is nothing online about Dubon or Fruge, other than those copyright entries, and an earlier trademark application by Mr. Fruge, to register a band called Southern Comfort, back in 1974. So... perhaps those names were fakes as well? Or maybe it's the other way around? Anyway, now your guess is as good as mine. But I'm still not convinced anyone needs to spend fifty bucks to pick this one up, hilarious as it may sound to our jaded modern ears.\n\nJug Scott \"Memories Of Hank Williams\" (Design Records, 1957-?) (LP)\n\nA purty durn good Hank Williams cover set, recorded not that long after Williams untimely demise. \"Jug Scott\" was one of many aliases used by Kentucky hillbilly singer Delbert Barker during his long career as a \"soundalike\" singer. A fine country singer in his own right, Barker quite broke through as a solo star (though several fine collections of his work have come out over the years). He had a healthy sideline as a covers singer, including this fine album which is unusually generously programmed, with fourteen(!) songs, all of them delivered with a solid, compact backing band and confident vocals by \"Jug.\" The liner notes are atypical as well, readily admitting that \"Jug does not attempt to imitate Hank in these recordings, rather, he sings Williams songs in his own honest, forthright manner. Nevertheless, the resemblance is frightening.\" I mostly agree with that: as a true-blue, dyed-in-the-wool hillbilly singer himself, Barker matches much of Hank's musical intensity, though with little of the spooky vibe Williams gave off. Tonally, he sounds more like Lefty Frizzell on many of these tracks, but there ain't nothing wrong with that. Nice stuff; apparently reissued a time or two, possibly under some of his other pseudonyms.\n\nKenny Lee Scott \"Down On My Luck\" (Nation Records, 1986-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bobby Rich, Fred Cameron & Steve Hembree)\n\nA nice record, with an unusual mix of influences. Kenny Lee Scott was apparently the stage name of Ken Huens, who wrote all but two of the songs on this album. Huens also released at least one single under his own name, though those songs are not included on this album. Anyway, I like the overall vibe of this album, which is slick but rootsy at the same time, well-produced yet not goopy. Don Williams comes to mind, although there's a hint of Delbert McClinton-esque roadhouse roots bubbling underneath the surface, which works well with his voice, which sounds a bit like Russell Smith of the Amazing Rhythm Aces. Nice, mellow modern country stuff, overall. This was recorded in Nashville, and I think Huens lived there as well, although he may have originally been from Indiana: the genesis of this album was a song called \"Knight Time In Indiana,\" which was an homage to basketball coach Bob Knight, who led the Hoosiers on a remarkable hot streak during the 1970s. The album was produced by Bobby Rich, the bass player for the Stonewall Jackson band, who also contributes liner notes.\n\nLarry Scott \"Keep On Truckin' \" (Alshire Records, 1973) (LP)\n\nAn enthusiastic set of trucker tunes from Los Angeles-area DJ Larry Scott, who hosted a primetime show on KLAC, a top country station of the era. Scott himself won a Billboard award as DJ Of The Year for 1972, so one assumes he was pretty well connected, and influential. That may help explain the lineup of top talent backing him here, including steel player J. D. Maness and superpicker James Burton and pianist Glen D. Hardin, from Elvis Presley's fabled TCB Band. Scott wasn't a great singer, by any means, but his rugged approach was perfect for the trucker song genre -- hell, if Dave Dudley and Red Sovine could have hits, why not this guy? The set list is a mix of covers, such as \"Six Days On The Road\" and \"I'm A Truck\" to oddball originals, including three by a guy named Joe Bob Barnhill. Highlights include \"My Truck's The Other Woman In My Life\" and \"Truck Drivin' Nightmare,\" where our hero gets roped into hauling a load to a government missile site, with unpredictable, over-the-top results. So did he have any hits? Well, no... but it does sound like he had some fun making this album, and if you're into trucker songs, this one adds some nice ones to the list.\n\nLois Scott \"...And Back Up And Push\" (Green Dolphin Records, 1982-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Roy Nickels)\n\nLois Scott was a country singer from New Brighton, Pennsylvania, whose father, Ramblin' Roy Scott, was a well-known local fiddler who performed regularly at the WWVA Wheeling Jamboree. In the late 'Seventies she formed a band called Back Up And Push that included her then-fiancee, drummer Roy Nickels, as well as Bob Crafton on pedal steel and dobro, bass player Paul Rodl, and lead guitar by Bryan Rubican, who also wrote most of the songs on this album. According to a lengthy profile in West Liberty College's student paper, The Trumpet, Nickels and Scott met around 1978 while working together at local used car lot, and they struck up a relationship based partly on their love of country music: Mr. Nickels had been in a few rock bands as a kid, and Ms. Scott had plenty of experience working with her dad, starting back when she was just eight years old. Back Up And Push came together around 1980 with Bryan Rubican as their primary songwriter. They initially put out a single in '81, although the lineup had almost completely changed by the time this album came out. As far as I know this was their only LP, though Scott and Rubican later led a band called Plum Loco, and were still playing together at least as recently as 2008, including some live gigs with her dad; Lois Scott also formed a trio called Harmony Scott with her sisters Jan and Lori, who had all been child performers working with their dad, back in the old days.\n\nTommy Scott -- see artist profile\n\nWayne Scott \"I'Am Singin' Your Song\" (Westwind Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Wayne Scott)\n\nThe Scragg Family \"Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out\" (Sonyatone Records, 1973) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Peter Feldmann & Wayne Yentis)\n\nThis acoustic trio from Santa Barbara, California -- Peter Feldman playing mandolin, Kasja Ohman on banjo and vocals, Gene McGeorge on violin -- was founded in 1962 and was a mainstay of the coastal bluegrass scene. On their first album, they played a mix of old-timey mountain music and stringband-ified Depression-era blues. The album opens on a rocky note, with Ohman going a little overboard with some Mamie Smith-style blues mama vocalizing... But when she settles into a more comfortable mode, singing some hardcore Appalachian ballads, she nails the whole keening, Hazel Dickens shape-note sound. Nice stuff!\n\nGove (Scrivenor) \"Heavy Cowboy\" (TRX Records, 1971) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Don Gant & Mike Weesner)\n\nAlthough he became known as a freewheeling, genre-morphic 'Seventies folkie (see below), Scrivenor's first big music gig was, almost improbably, working for Nashville mega-mogul Wesley Rose, cutting this debut disc for the TRX imprint, which was sort of a youth-market label, catering more to pop and soul music than the usual country fare that Rose was famous for. Nonetheless, even with the hippie-esque veneer, Scrivenor got backing from a slew of top country talent, Nashville heavyweights such as David Briggs, Danny Flowers, Weldon Myrick, Hank Strzelecki, Chip Young and the like. Perhaps not surprisingly he became pals with John Hartford, who had a similar start as a major-label odd-man-out over at RCA, and followed Hartford over to the more comfy confines of the upstart folk/bluegrass label, Flying Fish Records. On this album he went all mononymic, just calling himself \"Gove,\" though later on he added his surname to his records... I'm sure his folks were proud!\n\nGove Scrivenor \"Solid Gove\" (Rounder-Flying Fish, 1998)\n\nThis is a handy compilation of two late '70s albums by multi-instrumentalist Gove Scrivenor, one of those eclectic acoustic folkies like George Gritzbach who mixed a love of bluegrass and blues with a funky sensibility... Of the two original records, Shady Gove is certainly the better, with some melodic blues tunes, such as \"Black Cat Bone,\" that are nice, and plenty of sweet picking from his pals, including folk-bluegrass luminaries such as John Hartford, Marty Stuart and Doc Watson. Although I heard a lot of these songs on KFAT, back in the day, there are two songs I liked best and would still recommend: the jaunty \"Walkin' My Blues Away\" and \"Going To The Country.\" His next album isn't that great, with decent material given flowery arrangements, amid an overly-serious folk scene experimentalism. Not my cup of tea, though I guess if you're into mainstream folk, this might be worth checking out. I kinda hate to say it, but this might be a record where a couple of quick downloads would pretty much cover it. Scrivenor also did a lot of work as a session musician, and many years later recorded a couple more albums.\n\nThe Earl Scruggs Revue -- see artist profile\n\nGary & Randy Scruggs \"All The Way Home\" (Vanguard, 1970) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Charlie Daniels & Neil Wilburn)\n\nOn their way to helping anchor the Earl Scruggs Revue with their uber-famous dad, siblings Gary and Randy Scruggs tuned in and turned on their amplifiers for this slightly kooky, ultimately clumsy electrified rock-country record. I'm putting the \"rock\" part first because the super-thumpy, fuzzed out hard rock riffs drown out most of the twang, echoing the proto-metal of hippie-era bands such as Cream and Iron Butterfly. The country elements come partly in picking, but mostly in the repertoire, which is packed with folk and folk-rock classics by Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Tim Hardin and Joni Mitchell. The overall sound is pretty sludgy and slow, with the Scruggs brothers apparently struggling with the demands of studio multi-tracking and playing electric. The project was a nice idea, but it doesn't really work out too well, at least not this time around. The up-and-coming Charlie Daniels co-produced the album and is also credited as a musician; also nice to see brief, noncommittal liner notes written by hippie-twang guru John Hartford, who was camping in Yosemite at the time. A few tunes are okay, but mostly this album is a real mess: the best track on here is an instrumental, a pumped-up version of \"Earl's Breakdown,\" with Randy Scruggs cutting loose with some nice banjo riffs, riding atop a grungy rock rhythm, but at least you can hear the melody!\n\nThe Seabird Band \"The Seabird Band\" (Waylon Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Guy Burlage)\n\nBrothers Guy and Denis Burlage anchored the easygoing Seabird Band, a regionally popular group from Virginia Beach, VA that mixed '70s soft-pop and a bit of country twang, particularly with Guy Burlage playing pedal steel guitar... They got some traction nationally, but eventually Guy Burlage moved up North to Vermont and \"went solo,\" recording and performing under his own name. These guys are often mentioned as pioneers of the so-called \"Virginia Sound\" that Bruce Hornsby brought into the pop mainstream in the early '80s... At first it's hard to hear, as this disc kicks off with a solid set of classic-sounding country-rock, in the New Riders/Eagles mode, but by the third track, pianist Victor Paul's delicate, tinkling keyboard riffs assert themselves on \"Memory Of You,\" and indeed, will have a familiar feel to Hornsby fans. Country fans won't be disappointed by this disc, which is definitely anchored in twang, but has a mellow rock undercurrent.\n\nJim Seal \"Sings\" (197--?) (LP)\n\nGreat record, though there's a real blank slate on this guy... No producer or musician information, no release date, not even a label name, for pete's sake... From the somewhat vague liner notes contributed by a fella named George Healy, we learn that Jim Seal -- not to be confused with the 'Seventies soft-pop superstar Jim Seals of the duo Seals & Croft -- was born in Huntington Beach, California and performed at some (unidentified) venues in Los Angeles and Orange County. Healy implies that the album was funded by Jim and Jessie Minor, a ranching couple from Riverside who he mysteriously refers to in quotation marks as \"farmers\" -- though why, I dunno. Anyway, this is a fun record, with a easygoing but confident vibe very similar to Dick Feller's albums of the same era, solid picking, robust vocals, a little bit of a novelty vibe. Half of the eight tracks are credited to the Songmaker publishing company, which I assume was Seal's own imprint, and the only two that seem to be covers are a pair of Jim Reeves covers, \"Four Walls\" and \"He'll Have To Go.\" (These are musically weaker than the rest of the album, and were probably from a previously-released single.) One of the album's oddest songs, \"I'm Not The Man I Used To Be,\" is a tall-tale novelty number about some poor guy who can't keep up with the sexual voracity of the gals in the women's liberation era, who apparently fling themselves at him nonstop, and simply wear him out. He makes the most of it, though, despite the hardship. These sessions were recorded in Nashville at an unknown studio with an unidentified band... It seems likely that this was the same Jim Seals who cut a few singles for the Nashville-based NSD Records, including one of his own tunes, \"Empty Tables,\" though mostly he seems to have been demo-ing stuff written by folks like Roger Bowling and producer Byron Hill. Mostly, though, his biography remains elusive, and this one's a little more of a mystery disc than most.\n\nJoyce Seamone \"Testing, 1-2-3\" (Marathon Records, 1972) (LP)\n\nNova Scotia's Joyce Seamone had a breakaway hit with her independently produced single, \"Testing, 1-2-3,\" which topped the charts in Canada and led to several albums on the Marathon label. This debut disc also includes several \"girl\" singer classics, including covers of \"L.A. International Airport,\" \"One's On The Way,\" Cotton Jenny\" and \"Help Me Make It Through The Night.\" After several years in the spotlight, Seamone quit touring, though she continued to perform locally and started her own label, Gemini Records, after moving back to Nova Scotia in 1987.\n\nJoyce Seamone \"Merry Christmas From Joyce Seamone\" (Marathon Records, 1972) (LP)\n\nJoyce Seamone \"Stand By For A Special Announcement\" (Marathon Records, 1973) (LP)\n\nJoyce Seamone \"I Can See It In His Eyes\" (Boot Records, 1976) (LP)\n\nJoyce Seamone \"The Other Side Of Me\" (Gemini Records, 1987)\n\n(Produced by Georges Hebert)\n\nSeatrain \"Seatrain\" (A&M Records, 1970) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Henry Lewy)\n\nThis is the debut album from the folk-prog fusion band Seatrain, founded by fiddler Richard Greene, who was in the Bill Monroe band at the same time as Peter Rowan, and who remained a close collaborator over the years. I don't think Rowan was onboard for this first record, though Greene was for sure, adding both lofty violin passages and tasty fiddle licks (one of the few highlights from an otherwise frantic stoner set. Seatrain started out in the SF Bay Area, recording several albums before various members spun off into other bands, including twang-oriented projects such as Greene and Rowan's legendary bluegrass band Muleskinner.\n\nSeatrain \"Seatrain\" (Capitol Records, 1970) (LP)\n\n(Produced by George Martin)\n\nSeatrain \"The Marblehead Messenger\" (Capitol Records, 1971) (LP)\n\n(Produced by George Martin)\n\nSeatrain \"Watch\" ("
