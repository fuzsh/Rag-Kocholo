        "text": "Frank Peppiatt and John Aylesworth began their legendary careers as writing partners in the advertising business. A reputation as industry jokers quickly transitioned to a role at the burgeoning CBC, writing and producing the first Canadian televised comedy series, After Hours.\n\nThe pair went on to write and star in two more CBC series, the musical variety show On Stage and The Big Revue, both of which were directed by future Oscar winner and Peppiatt’s University of Toronto classmate Norman Jewison, before heading south to pursue opportunities working on a series of popular variety programs including The Judy Garland Show, The Sonny and Cher Show and The Julie Andrews Hour.\n\nA decade after leaving the CBC, Peppiatt and Aylesworth created the legendary country-comedy variety series Hee Haw, which ran as a ratings juggernaut at CBS for twenty years.\n\nIn 1995, Peppiatt & Aylesworth were inducted into the CBC Comedy Hall Of Fame and, a year later, the pair reunited to pen new sketches for a CBC tribute show in their honour.\n\nIt’s been said in Canada there are only three certainties: Death, Taxes, and Wayne & Shuster.\n\nThe comedy team of Johnny Wayne and Frank Shuster became a comedy institution through the ‘40s, ‘50s and ‘60s, appearing on the The Ed Sullivan Show a record-breaking 67 times, but it’s their sheer endurance on the CBC up until the 1990s which makes them a pillar of Canadian culture.\n\nIt’s not an exaggeration to say for most intents and purposes, Wayne & Shuster are Canadian comedy for those that grew up with the concept.\n\nHoning their skills first at the University of Toronto, then as performers for the troops during the Second World War before landing on CBC Radio, the post-vaudevillian pair had a reputation for classy, literary-themed sketch comedy. Or, as the New York Times described them, “the harbingers of literate slapstick.” But it’s the duo’s unimpeachable Canadianism which is perhaps their most defining feature – they never made an American series, preferring to keep their egghead puns and punchlines on the CBC (and Sullivan). Despite this, many of Canada’s comical exports, from SCTV to Saturday Night Live, can be traced back thematically to such Wayne & Shuster pop-culture-meets-litcom staples as ‘Western Hamlet.’\n\nThough it only ran for two seasons, the Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour is perhaps most notable for inspiring star Lorne Michaels to create Saturday Night Live. The variety show aired as part of CBC’s Sunday at Nine anthology, where its quick sketches, irreverent spoofs and mockumentaries were shown alongside dramas and other “light entertainment.”\n\nModeled on Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In, where straight-man Michaels and funny-man co-star Hart Pomerantz worked before returning to Canada, the series mixed sketch and musical guests and starred, amongst others, Dan Aykroyd.\n\nFour years after Terrific Hour went off the air, Michaels would create and produce Saturday Night Live for NBC.\n\nSet in and around the only station in the fictional town of Melonville, SCTV‘s constraints were only that of the televised universe. The result, as with Candy’s minor celebrity Johnny LaRue, Levy’s showbiz-hack Bobby Bittman, or Short’s Jerry Lewis, were biting and timeless skewing of a previous generation by a wild new one. Both idol-killing and timeless, SCTV ultimately struggled to find a steady home both in Canada and abroad, though unsurprisingly it remains a rerun juggernaut.\n\nCurrently in the works is a Netflix-produced documentary directed by Martin Scorsese, which saw the cast reunited at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto.\n\nSmith & Smith was huge for me, as a kid who wanted to get into comedy, and who was living in rural Canada. I only had two channels. I don’t know what it is that made me want to get into show business or comedy, but anything that was borderline comedy on Canadian TV, I’d watch it. When the show Smith & Smith came on, I wasn’t expecting much. I knew it was a low-budget Canadian sketch variety show, but I found it to be very funny and very smart.\n\nI became very enamoured with that show. It just kind of helped solidify the notion that this was maybe a possibility, of doing comedy on TV in Canada. Seeing this couple out of Hamilton make this show that I thought was very good on a limited budget, made it seem real. When you see big, glitzy, flashy American shows… you don’t think yourself that you can get there. Smith & Smith was the first show that made me think, maybe this is possible.\n\nI remember him telling us back then at the time he started You Can’t Do That on Television, a lot of kids on TV shows were put up on pedestals and were in these kinds of great situations so his theory was that it made the kids at home who were dealing with very real struggles like divorce and crappy parents, being bullied by a friend or any of the stuff that kids go through, he felt like the shows of the time weren’t reflecting [that] and were actually having the impact of making kids feel worse.\n\nHis idea was to start a series in this kind of alternate reality, sort of pseudo-reality, where the kids are put through the ringer and put into these ridiculously bad situations. You know, they get put in front of a firing squad, the burger joint they go to always gives them food poisoning, if they say three words like “I don’t know” by accident they get horrific green slime dumped on them, and so on and so on. His theory was that by doing so, it might make kids feel better about their own crappy situations. And he really hit on something and it worked.\n\nSo despite the puerile surface of the show, there is a real deep understanding about what kids wanted and what they were going through and what they wanted to see reflected on TV. That’s why the show was kind of revolutionary in a lot of ways.\n\nAs its title suggests, Bizarre made no bones messing with the audience’s expectations of normality. Hosted by American comedian and impressionist John Byner, the series featured slapstick sketches, parodies, monologues, and performances by guest stand-up comics.\n\nByner’s comedy stylings were considered raunchy for the time, and indeed, during its run an uncensored version featuring nudity and swearing was made for Showtime along with a clean version for CTV.\n\nThough Byner and a rotating mostly American cast were featured throughout the series, it was show producer Bob Einstein and his creation Super Dave Osborne that ultimately became Bizarre‘s breakout hit. Eventually getting its own series, Super Dave, which featured a more family-friendly version of the character.\n\nAbsurd, irreverent and increasingly relevant with every year that passes, the Toronto troupe’s unique takes on modern life were beautifully unsubtle. Produced by SNL head honcho Lorne Michaels, the sketch series, which featured Kids Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch, Kevin McDonald, Mark McKinney and Scott Thompson, was, by all accounts, ahead of its time. With sketches based more on insular trauma than exterior populism — gender and sexual anxiety rather than popular culture references — The Kids in the Hall gained a popular cult following both in Canada and abroad before being taken off the air in 1995.\n\nAs a result, much of Canadian exports and imports have the Kids’ fingerprints all over them (often literally, with many going on to successful careers in front and behind the camera).\n\nOften airing as the latter half of a CBC comedy hour with the Kids in the Hall, CODCO was a no holds barred, off-the-wall, sketch comedy series which featured hard-edge satire and biting wit, all exposed with a lashing east-coast tongue.\n\nCODCO featured Tommy Sexton, Greg Malone, Mary Walsh, Cathy Jones, and Andy Jones and drew much of its humour lampooning the country’s perception of Newfoundlanders as boorish yokels. Turning such regionality on its head, CODCO was a sharp contrast to the Kids’ irreverent and absurdist generational satire – they didn’t just have an openly gay character as a political statement, they had skits called ‘Blaming Africa for AIDS.’ By 1993, down a member due to a controversy arising over a sketch about Irish priests, the group decided to voluntarily call it quits, setting the stage for a more measured but equally sharp news satire: Walsh’s brainchild, This Hour Has 22 Minutes.\n\nOne of Canadian sketch comedy’s most enduring characters, Red Green began life as a parody of an overly dull D.I.Y. outdoor show on Smith & Smith, but quickly grew his own following in Canada and the States (where it aired on PBS) as creator Steve Smith built out the handyman’s world – the fictional northwestern Ontario town of Possum Lake.\n\nFeaturing popular segments like The Possum Lodge Word Game, Handyman Corner and Adventures with Bill, The Red Green Show went through several permutations before landing at CBC in 1997, where it stayed until its finale almost ten years later.\n\nProving Smith’s theory that something can be so Canadian it works around the world, Red Green and his love of duct tape have outlasted the series, producing a film and multiple books.\n\nOriginally formed in Montreal in the 1970s, but transplanted shortly thereafter to Ontario, comedy troupe The Royal Canadian Air Farce was a hit on CBC Radio before successfully landing on Canadian television in the early 1990s following the success of a New Years special. Originally featuring Roger Abbott, Don Ferguson, Luba Goy and John Morgan, Air Farce has since featured a new generation of Canadian comics including Jessica Holmes and Darryl Hinds.\n\nNotable for its political and socio-economic satire of Canadian life — look no further than Mike from Canmore and chain-smoking bingo player Brenda — Air Farce could be seen as a national comic temperature, always threatening to boil over but in the end always quick-witted and good-natured.\n\nIn the wake of CODCO, comedy mainstay This Hour Has 22 Minutes was created in 1993, when comedy by Newfoundlanders made a strong return. In many ways ahead of its time as a fake news satire, 22 Minutes was the brainchild of CODCO alum Mary Walsh. Modeled on a CBC News broadcast, 22 Minutes took savage pleasure in mocking televised convention and regularly calling out the hypocrisy of Canada’s elected officials. While the news format allowed the cast a rich platform in which to pointedly slap their intended target, it was the sketches in which “experts” gave their opinions on the day’s events that allowed a pulpit for the stars, specifically Walsh and a young Rick Mercer, to rain down comical blows.\n\nHailed as the new, feminist face of Canadian comedy, Baroness von Sketch Show honours Canada’s long history of sketch comedy by breaking all the rules. Sketches run as fast-paced and irreverent takes on hot-button social issues, but do so with a fair share of Kids in the Hall absurdity and CODCO frankness. Featuring a series of short, internet-friendly sketches on anything from mom jeans to catcalling, Carolyn Taylor, Meredith MacNeill, Aurora Browne and Jennifer Whalen mine the embarrassing and satirize the absurd idiosyncrasies of navigating life as 40-something women in the modern world.\n\nEntering its fourth season on CBC, Baroness von Sketch Show is that rare show that manages to have a large following in Canada, the United States (where it airs on IFC) and the internet, where sketches like ‘Locker Room’ continue to accrue millions of views."
