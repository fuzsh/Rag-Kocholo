        "text": "404: Teenagers From Outer Space\n\nby Wyn Hilty\n\nOh, is he any relation to Christie Love?\n\nGet Christie Love! was a short-lived (1974-1975) TV series about a sexy Black undercover cop named Christie Love (Teresa Graves).\n\n[Sung.] Get David Love …\n\nA riff on the opening theme from Get Christie Love! (see previous note).\n\nAccording to Erma Bombeck, all teenagers are from outer space.\n\nErma Bombeck (1927-1996) was a humorist who had a popular syndicated newspaper column for decades. She tended to write about the stresses of family life, including raising children.\n\nNo, it’s a Devo hat.\n\nDevo was a geek-rock proto-new-wave band that hit its peak of popularity in the 1980s. In the video for their song “Whip It,” all the band members wore hats that looked like big red plastic flowerpots turned upside down.\n\nIt’s Audrey Hepburn’s hat from Breakfast at Tiffany’s.\n\nIn the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany’s, actress Audrey Hepburn, playing socialite Holly Golightly, wears a variety of hats, with the most famous being a wide-brimmed affair. That style of hat became briefly popular after the movie came out.\n\nRun, Toto, run!\n\nA line from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Toto was Dorothy’s dog.\n\n[Sung.] Witch theme.\n\nThis is the Wicked Witch of the West’s theme from The Wizard of Oz.\n\nOh, it’s Won Ton Ton, the dog that saved Hollywood.\n\nWon Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood is a 1976 film about an aspiring actress who finds that her dog winds up becoming the star. It starred Bruce Dern and Madeline Kahn.\n\nPac-Man!\n\nPac-Man is the most popular arcade game of all time, creating a veritable merchandising craze during the 1980s and causing millions of teenagers to blow their allowances on quarters. It was created by Japanese game designer Toru Iwatani in 1980.\n\nBidi-bidi-bidi.\n\nAn imitation of the C-3PO-like robot Twiki, from the Star Wars-like TV series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (NBC, 1979-1981).\n\nI am the egg man, oo koo ka choo.\n\nA line from the 1967 Beatles song “I Am the Walrus.” Sample lyrics: “I am the eggman, they are the eggmen/I am the walrus, goo goo g’joob.”\n\nOoh, now Michael Jackson will want him.\n\nIn the late 1980s a rumor spread in the tabloids that Michael Jackson had tried to purchase the bones of Joseph Merrick, also known as the Elephant Man. Merrick was a horrifically deformed man in Victorian England who was the subject of the 1980 film The Elephant Man. The rumor was proven false, but Jackson never seemed too outraged about it. In fact, in 1989 Jackson released a short film to accompany his song “Leave Me Alone,” which poked fun at this and other rumors about him; the film won a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 1990. The incident added to Jackson’s growing reputation for weirdness.\n\nLooks like the Elephant Man in the 25th century.\n\nSee previous note. Buck Rogers in the 25th Century was a sci-fi TV series starring Gil Gerard as a 20th-century astronaut revived 500 years in the future. It aired from 1979-1981.\n\nRay Liotta?!\n\nRay Liotta (1954-2022) was a versatile actor known for memorable roles in such films as Goodfellas (1990) and Field of Dreams (1989).\n\nEver since I was a kid, I always wanted to be a spaceman.\n\nAn imitation of Ray Liotta’s narration, which provides background and exposition throughout the 1990 mobster movie GoodFellas, directed by Martin Scorsese. Actual line: “As far back as I could remember, I’ve always wanted to be a gangster.” In 2007, the line came in at #20 in Premier magazine’s “100 Greatest Movie Lines.”\n\n[Sung.] I know I'd go from rags to riches …\n\n“Rags to Riches” is a song written by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross and recorded by Tony Bennett with Percy Faith and His Orchestra in 1953, going on to top the charts for eight weeks that year. The song is closely associated with the movie GoodFellas (see previous notes), which featured it prominently in a montage sequence near the beginning of the film. Sample lyrics: “I know I'd go from rags to riches/If you would only you say you care/And though my pocket may be empty/I'll be a millionaire.”\n\nBoy, I could sure go for a hamburger sandwich and some French fried potatoes. I’m a teenager, after all.\n\nA reference to Show 203, Jungle Goddess, whose stranded-in-the-jungle heroine laments, “What I wouldn’t give for a hamburger and some nice French fried potatoes.” Show 208, Lost Continent, then referenced the Jungle Goddess line, upgrading the dish to “a charbroiled hamburger sandwich and French fried potatoes,” and Show 507, I Accuse My Parents upped the ante again, referring in a host segment to “a big beefy charbroiled hamburger sammich and a French fried potatoes garnish.”\n\n[Imitating.] Welcome to Death Valley Days. The driver is either me or …\n\nDeath Valley Days was a radio, and then a television anthology series, set in the Wild West, that ran from 1930 to 1975. Each episode was introduced by a host; from 1965 to 1966 that host was Ronald Reagan, his final work as a professional actor before entering politics. However, this recurring riff is actually a reference to a moment in the “Phantom Creeps” short in Show 205, Rocket Attack USA, when a character says, “The driver is gone or he’s hiding” in a very Ronald Reagan-like voice. Some fans came to believe that “The driver is either missing or he’s dead” was something that Ronald Reagan was actually known for saying. Not true. (Thanks to Satellite News for this reference.)\n\nCool, they’ve got Marshall amps. Custom heads.\n\nMarshall is a British company that makes guitar amplifiers. The company first made it big in the 1960s and has remained popular among musicians since then.\n\nHey, it’s Harry Connick Jr.\n\nA pianist and singer who participated in (some say precipitated) the swing and big-band revival of the early 1990s. His big break came when he scored the 1989 film When Harry Met Sally. He has since gone on to act in several movies, most notably Copycat (1995) and Independence Day (1996). He is married to former model Jill Goodacre.\n\nYou know, you won’t see costuming like this till Marc Singer does V.\n\nV was a 1983 TV miniseries about a race of aliens that comes to Earth with a secret plan to steal the planet’s natural resources. It starred Marc Singer (the Beastmaster) as a cameraman who becomes suspicious of the aliens.\n\nOr Thomas Pynchon does V.\n\nThomas Pynchon is a novelist known for his incredibly complex and critically praised works. V. (1963) was his first novel, about an ex-sailor who falls in with a crowd of artists in the 1950s.\n\nI will pet him and keep him and call him George.\n\nThis is a paraphrase of a line in a Looney Tunes short called The Abominable Snow Rabbit (1961), in which the Abominable Snowman announces his intention of keeping Daffy Duck (disguised as a bunny) as a pet: “Just what I always wanted. My own little bunny rabbit. I will name him George, and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him ...” He repeats variants of this avowal several times throughout the short. The line is itself a reference to the John Steinbeck novel Of Mice and Men, in which the dimwitted ranch worker Lennie, who has a penchant for petting things to death, is shepherded through life by his friend George. (Thanks to Kim Phillips for pointing out the Steinbeck reference.)\n\nI see you have a machine that goes ping.\n\nA line from the 1983 film The Meaning of Life, by the demented geniuses of Monty Python’s Flying Circus.\n\nI’ve taken my pill, sir.\n\nOral contraceptive pills are packaged individually in blister packs, either in a circle or in rows, which are labeled to make it easy to know which pill to take on which day of the month.\n\nOf beer on the wall.\n\nThe song “99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall” is a popular English folk song sung in declining numerical order as each bottle is taken down and passed around. It is based on the 19th-century song “Ten Green Bottles.” A French scholar supposedly discovered poetry manuscripts dating to the 14th century containing a more primitive version of the lyrics.\n\nHi, Derek.\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a self-help system for alcoholics based on a twelve-step program and relying on the support of other alcoholics to help people quit drinking and live sober lives. A key component to the program is regular attendance of AA meetings, where protocol dictates that speakers introduce themselves by first name only, followed by “I’m an alcoholic,” to which the rest of the group responds “Hi, [first name].”\n\n[Sung.] Shannon is gone, they say she drifted out to …\n\nA line from the Henry Gross song “Shannon.” Sample lyrics: “Shannon, is gone I heard/She's drifting out to sea/She always loved to swim away/Maybe she'll find an island with a shaded tree/Just like the one in our backyard.”\n\nMrs. Carmichael, put that laser down.\n\nAn imitation of fastidious banker Mr. Mooney (played by Gale Gordon) in the TV sitcom The Lucy Show (1962-1968). Lucille Ball played Lucy Carmichael, a widow with two children and a substantial trust fund, which was administered by Mr. Mooney, who referred to Lucy as “Mrs. Carmichael.”\n\nMen don’t leave.\n\nMen Don’t Leave is a 1990 film starring Jessica Lange as a widow struggling to raise her two sons.\n\nOh, A Separate Peace.\n\nA Separate Peace is a novel by John Knowles about two friends at an English prep school just before World War II.\n\nI think what our bright young friend is trying to tell us is …\n\nA paraphrase of a line from the 1979 film Being There, adapted from the 1970 novella by Jerzy Kosinski. Peter Sellers plays a mentally challenged, middle-aged ex-gardener who is mistaken for a wealthy industrialist, and whose simple-minded remarks are taken as profound political allegory. So when he talks about gardening, another wealthy industrialist says: “I think what our insightful young friend is saying is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, but we’re upset by the seasons of our economy.”\n\nIt’s called Iron John.\n\nIron John was a 1990 book by poet Robert Bly that inspired the men’s movement of the 1990s, where men would gather to beat drums and discuss their feelings.\n\n[Sung.] Star Trek fight music.\n\nThis is the music that frequently played during fight scenes on the TV series Star Trek, which aired from 1966-1969. It was originally composed by Gerald Fried for the episode “Amok Time,” and its official title is “The Ritual/Ancient Battle/2nd Kroykah.” (Thanks to Bluejay Young for the info on Gerald Fried.)\n\nI’ll need an Ipecac.\n\nSyrup of Ipecac is an over-the-counter medicine meant to induce vomiting in the case of accidental poisoning.\n\nA mad, wonderful fool.\n\n“Oh, Moses, Moses, you mad, wonderful fool” is a line from the 1956 film epic The Ten Commandments.\n\nNow, I like you, Trevor, but you’re screwy, you got it? I’m the fellow wearing the roscoe, see? I like dames but they don’t like me.\n\nAn imitation of actor Edward G. Robinson (1893-1973), whose 50 year career on stage and screen is best remembered for gangster and tough guy roles in such films as Little Caesar (1931) and Key Largo (1948). “Roscoe” is an old slang term for a handgun, especially a revolver, used in detective stories and films in the first half of the 20th century. Frank Conniff tells us that \"Trevor\" was just a name they liked to use sometimes.\n\n[Sung.] Thrive, captain, thrive …\n\nA take on the 1970 Blues Image song “Ride Captain Ride.” Sample lyrics: “Ride, captain ride upon your mystery ship/Be amazed at the friends you have here on your trip/Ride captain ride upon your mystery ship/On your way to a world that others might have missed.”\n\nQueequeg?\n\nQueequeg is a character from Herman Melville’s novel Moby Dick, a South Sea islander who is covered head to toe in tattoos.\n\nPeter Arnett had one of those.\n\nPeter Arnett is a television and print journalist who has worked for the Associated Press, CNN, and NBC, among others. He earned a reputation as a trustworthy reporter, but in the early 21st century he stumbled into controversy after reporting things the government did not want said, particularly about the Iraq War.\n\nMort Sahl?\n\nMort Sahl (1927-2021) was a standup comedian and actor, one of the first to forgo the standard joke setup/punchline approach to standup comedy in favor of straightforward, conversational monologues that satirized current events and politics. His style paved the way for other comics such as Lenny Bruce, Dick Gregory, and George Carlin.\n\n“Prepare him for the isolation chamber.” What’s the question?\n\nOn the television quiz show Twenty-One, which aired from 1956-1958, two contestants would be placed in isolation booths and compete to answer questions of varying difficulty. Twenty-One was yanked off the air following revelations that the game was rigged, a story told in the film Quiz Show.\n\nMoses? Moses!\n\nIn the Bible, God speaks to Moses from out of a burning bush, promising him that he will deliver the Israelites from slavery in Egypt.\n\n“The high court will pardon him.” Oh, yeah, he’s a Kennedy.\n\nThe Kennedy family is one of the richest and most powerful in the nation. Founded by Joseph Kennedy Sr., the dynasty would grow to include President John F. Kennedy, attorney general and presidential candidate Robert Kennedy, and longtime Senator Ted Kennedy. The family has also been dogged by tragedy and scandal, such as Ted Kennedy’s plunge off a bridge on Chappaquiddick in 1969, a car crash that killed his passenger; despite leaving the scene of the accident and failing to report it for several hours, he was never charged in the case. The Kennedys’ power, money, and influence have largely protected its members from legal consequences; in 1991, to take a more recent example, William Kennedy Smith, nephew of the previously mentioned Kennedys, was charged with raping a woman he met at a Palm Beach nightclub. Despite his history (three other women were willing to testify he had assaulted them but were barred from doing so), Smith was acquitted. He has subsequently faced civil lawsuits from employees who accused him of sexual assault and sexual harassment; one was dismissed and one was settled out of court.\n\nI’m not dead. I’m getting better.\n\nA line from a scene in the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, in which a man tries to dump his protesting elderly relative onto a cart filled with dead plague victims.\n\nPaging Mr. Herman.\n\nA line from the Paul Reubens (1952-2023) film Pee-wee’s Big Adventure (1985).\n\nAgain with the finger.\n\nA reference to a line in The Sunshine Boys, a play by Neil Simon that was made into a 1975 film starring Walter Matthau and George Burns as two feuding vaudevillians. The actual line: “The finger! You’re starting again with the finger!”\n\nShut up, Gomer.\n\nProbably a reference to Gomer Pyle, the bumbling Marine who appeared on The Andy Griffith Show and Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. The role was played by Jim Nabors.\n\n“Let me …” Entertain you.\n\nA reference to the song “Let Me Entertain You” from the 1959 Stephen Sondheim musical Gypsy. Sample lyrics: “Let me entertain you/Let me make you smile/Let me do a few tricks/Some old and some new tricks/I'm very versatile.”\n\nRun your fastest! Jump your highest!\n\nOne of the original American brands of sneakers, PF Flyers (founded in 1937 by B.F. Goodrich) began using the slogan “Run Faster, Jump Higher” for their line of kid’s sneakers in 1944. PF Flyers later sponsored the kid’s animated TV show Jonny Quest (ABC, 1964-1965), and commercials on that series informed viewers that the shoes featured “the magic wedge, that helps you run your fastest and jump your highest.” Still around, the brand is now owned by Kassia Designs, LLC.\n\nThe loneliness of the alien runner.\n\nThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner is a 1962 film about a young man sentenced to a reformatory who finds solace in running.\n\nLife is simple here in Grover’s Corner.\n\nAn imitation of the Stage Manager, the narrator of the Thornton Wilder play Our Town. Grover’s Corners (not Corner) is the town of the title.\n\nGee, Davey.\n\nAn imitation of Goliath, the philosophical talking dog in Davey and Goliath, a claymation TV series that aired from 1962 to 1977. It was developed by Art Clokey, creator of Gumby, for the Lutheran Church as a Christian show for children.\n\nJim Henson’s Baretta Babies.\n\nJim Henson’s Muppet Babies was an animated television series that aired from 1984-1991. Baretta was a cop show starring Robert Blake as New York City undercover detective Tony Baretta. It aired from 1975-1978.\n\nLet’s watch as an alien visits one of our friendly Texaco stations.\n\nTexaco is a line of gas stations located nationwide. It was bought by Chevron in 2001, and Texaco stations have been disappearing ever since.\n\nWhat do I look like, the Shell Answer Man? Oh, that’s right, I am.\n\nThe Shell Answer Man was the star of various commercials and educational pamphlets put out by Shell Oil, in which he gave solutions to common car problems.\n\nSorry, Senator Helms.\n\nJesse Helms (1921-2008) was an ultraconservative senator from North Carolina who was immensely influential on U.S. foreign policy. First elected to the Senate in 1972, he tried to get an abortion ban into the Constitution, fought to institute school prayer, filibustered the Voting Rights Act, railed against homosexuals, and once tried to make Carol Moseley Braun, the first Black female senator, cry by singing “Dixie.” (He failed.) In 2001 he announced he would not seek re-election the following year. He died seven years later of vascular dementia.\n\nS'cuse me, is that a Sansabelt jumpsuit?\n\nSansabelt is a brand of men's trousers with an elasticized waistband--and hence no need for a belt. “Sans” is French for “without,” so … sans-a-belt. Get it? (Thanks to Christopher Brame for this reference.)\n\nIt’s Vince Sutton as Sergeant Carter.\n\nFrank Sutton (1923-1974) played the long-suffering Sgt.

It was part of a promotion for a Magic Convention, I think, as a way to entice wives and girlfriends to want to go to a magic convention—which they never do. I think the copy also read ‘the name of the game is HATS.’ So it fascinated me, still does–I think I may have read it to everyone in the writing room, and I remember Frank really laughing about it. That was it.” The “grandest of all …” addendum probably sprang from the mind of Frank Conniff.\n\nI did not say “Simon says.”\n\nSimon Says is an old kids’ game in which the “simon” tells the other children to do things—hop on one foot, touch their nose—prefacing each command with the words “Simon says.” If the simon omits those words when giving an order, anyone who performs the requested action is “out.”\n\nIambic pentameter.\n\nIambic pentameter is a meter used in poetry; it is one of the most common forms of English poetry.

In the 1980s its supposedly vapid teenage residents were satirized by, among other things, Moon Unit Zappa’s hit song “Valley Girl.”\n\nBelieve it, or not.\n\nAn imitation of Jack Palance (1919-2006) in his role as host of Ripley’s Believe It or Not! Palance’s show was the second iteration; the first version was a live TV show that premiered on NBC in 1949 and was hosted by Robert Ripley himself. Palance’s version aired from 1982 to 1986 on ABC, with a robust afterlife on cable. Palance seemed to truly savor delivering his signature line “Believe it … or not.”\n\nOh, now he’s going to sing “Ebony and Ivory.”\n\nA reference to the 1982 hit song “Ebony and Ivory” by Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney.

Drunk driving deaths went down by more than 50 percent over the next 30 years, but groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) remained unimpressed by their efforts, pointing out that at the same time the campaign was running, the companies were lobbying against raising the drinking age and toughening up legal blood alcohol levels for drunk driving.\n\nI don’t have any pants on.\n\nIn a recurring bit on Late Night with David Letterman (NBC, 1982-1993), Letterman would open a window in his high-rise office building and use a bullhorn to engage passersby on the sidewalk below, including the declaration, “I’m not wearing any pants!” Letterman’s production company is named Worldwide Pants.\n\nIt’s the lobster at the edge of town.\n\nA reference to the 1978 Bruce Springsteen song “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” Sample lyrics: “Well if she wants to see me/You can tell her that I’m easily found/Tell her there’s a spot out ’neath abram’s bridge/And tell her there’s a darkness on the edge of town.”\n\nThe Streets of San Francisco.

Come on down to Bargain Clown.\n\nIn a run-down strip mall in Hollywood, there was a famous sign that read “Bargain Clown Mart.” There was no such store; the sign actually signified the location of the nightclub The Three Clubs, as seen in the 1996 indie movie Swingers. The sign is gone now, but the phrase “Bargain Clown Mart” has gained a certain cult status. The Three Clubs Cocktail Lounge remains, with more traditional (but very stylish) signage out front.\n\nCome on, Joe, we gotta go, oh me oh my oh.\n\nA paraphrased line from the 1952 song “Jambalaya (On the Bayou)” written and originally recorded by country star Hank Williams.

In 2001 Limbaugh announced that he was going deaf, but he continued to do his radio show with the aid of cochlear implant surgery. An avid cigar enthusiast and former cigarette smoker, Limbaugh was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer in January of 2020, and died in February of 2021.\n\nDo not look at the man behind the curtain!\n\nA paraphrased line from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Actual line: \"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!\"\n\nWherever there’s a cop beating up a guy, I’ll be there.\n\nA line from the 1940 film The Grapes of Wrath, based on the novel by John Steinbeck. The full line: “Wherever there's a cop beatin’ up a guy, I’ll be there. I’ll be there in the way guys yell when they’re mad. I’ll be there in the way kids laugh when they’re hungry and they know supper’s ready, and when people are eatin’ the stuff they raise and livin’ in the houses they built, I’ll be there, too.”\n\nTomorrow is another day.\n\nThis is the final line from the 1939 film Gone With the Wind, spoken by Scarlett O’Hara (Vivien Leigh).\n\nAsk not what your country can do for you …\n\nA line from the 1961 inaugural address by President John F. Kennedy: “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.”\n\nOh, she came from Planet Claire.\n\nA reference to the song “Planet Claire” by the B-52’s. Sample lyrics: “She came from Planet Claire/I knew she came from there/She drove a Plymouth Satellite/Faster than the speed of light.”\n\nLook to the sky.\n\nIn the 1951 film The Thing from Another World, Ned “Scotty” Scott begs us all to “Watch the skies, everywhere, keep looking! Keep watching the skies!” The movie features an unrecognizable James “Marshal Dillon” Arness as the monster. A 1981 remake by director John Carpenter, titled The Thing, stars Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley. A 2011 prequel, also titled The Thing, manages to hit all the same beats as the John Carpenter film while ostensibly leading up to it. It stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead and a lot of Norwegians.\n\nHe turned into Bobby Goldsboro.\n\nBobby Goldsboro is a pop singer who had a string of hits in the late 1960s, including “Honey” and “Watching Scotty Grow.”\n\nDisneyland.\n\nSee above note.\n\n[Imitating.] Listen, if I don’t get in that car, I’m going to regret it.

[Clapping, whistling.] –Where’s Elaine? –Elaine. –Elaine, Elaine.\n\nJack LaLanne (1914-2011) was a fitness guru and motivational speaker who hosted the longest-running exercise program on television, from 1951-1985 (The Jack LaLanne Show). He did always maintain a whisper-thin figure. His wife, Elaine, frequently participated in the program, which had an audience made up primarily of stay-at-home moms. The extra “Elaines” might be a riff on the 1980 song “Elaine” by Swedish pop group ABBA. Sample lyrics: “A nowhere lane, a nowhere train for Elaine, Elaine, Elaine/Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, you know they're gonna get you/You try to break away, but they will never let you.”\n\n“Go!” Like you’ve never goed before.\n\nA riff on the 1983 synth-pop song “Maniac,” written and performed by Michael Sembello, which was used on the soundtrack of the popular film Flashdance, hit number one after the film’s release, and was nominated for an Oscar.

Inevitable. Walmarts, Megamall, lots of them.\n\nWalmart is the largest chain of retail stores in the United States. The first store was opened in 1962 by Sam Walton, offering discount merchandise at low prices. Walton opened many of his stores in small towns, where they often drove local merchants out of business by undercutting their prices. By the time of Walton’s death in 1992, there were more than 1,700 Walmart stores, by 2022 there were 10,585. “Megamall” is probably a reference to the Mall of America, one of the first, and largest, of America’s indoor malls, located in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota. To hear @bookworm1225 tell it, “No one in the Twin Cities calls it “The Mall of America.” It’s always “The Megamall.”\n\n“You must understand ...” I’m a magic man.\n\nA reference to the 1976 Heart song “Magic Man.” Sample lyrics: “But try to understand/Try to understand/Try try try to understand/I’m a magic man.”\n\nScarecrow, I’ll miss you least of all.\n\nA paraphrase of a line from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, spoken by Dorothy (Judy Garland) to the Scarecrow: “I think I’ll miss you most of all.”\n\nYeah, and they call the wind Maria.\n\nA reference to the song “They Call the Wind Maria” from the 1951 musical Paint Your Wagon.

The chain launched in 1962 and peaked in the 1970s with 278 locations, the last of which closed in 2009. During their '70s heyday, a seasonal promotion was the “Mr. Steak Summertime Steak and Clambake.”\n\n[Imitating.] I sound like Gilbert Gottfried.\n\nGilbert Gottfried (1955-2022) was a comedian and actor who performed with a distinctly shrill and gravelly voice; as a voice actor his best known role was that of the parrot Iago in the 1992 Disney animated film Aladdin. He was also the voice of the duck mascot in Aflac Insurance commercials, until a poorly received Twitter joke about the 2011 Japanese tsunami got him fired..\n\nOh, well, there’s got to be at least two more Russian aviators in that thing.\n\nA reference to the classic Marx Brothers movie A Night at the Opera (1935). The brothers stow away on board a ship headed for New York, and in order to get past immigration, Harpo steals the uniforms (and beards) of three famed Russian aviators traveling as passengers.\n\nAny cough drops, Dad?\n\nA reference to Smith Brothers cough drops. (Thanks to Kurt Steidl for this reference.)\n\nWe’ll kill the fatted calf now.\n\nTaken from the Parable of the Prodigal Son in the New Testament, the phrase “kill the fatted calf” is a metaphor for breaking out in celebration, especially to celebrate someone’s homecoming.\n\n“... it would likely spark the beginning of a revolution ...” Well, if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao …\n\nA reference to a line from the 1968 Beatles song “Revolution”: “You tell me it’s the institution/Well, you know/You better free your mind instead/But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao/You ain’t gonna make it with anyone anyhow.” (Thanks to Cliff Blau for this reference.)\n\nSuckers. So long, screw ya, see you in St. Louya.\n\nA variation on the classic Bugs Bunny line \"So long, screwy. See you in St. Louey!\" (Thanks to Joel Boutiere for this reference.)\n\nI’d like to sing “Rhinestone Cowboy.”\n\n“Rhinestone Cowboy” is a song written by Larry Weiss that became a number one hit for Glen Campbell in 1975. Sample lyrics: “I've been walking these streets so long/Singing the same old song/I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway/Where hustle is the name of the game/And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain.”\n\nThe papers want to know whose shirts you wear.\n\nA line from the 1969 song “Space Oddity” by David Bowie. One of Bowie’s signature songs, it tells the story of the failed mission of fictional astronaut “Major Tom.” Sample lyrics: “This is Ground Control to Major Tom/You’ve really made the grade/And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear/Now it’s time to leave the capsule if you dare.” The song is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock.\n\nHey, look, Old Faithful.\n\nOld Faithful is a geyser in Yellowstone National Park, located in Wyoming. It erupts more frequently than any other geyser—about once every ninety minutes—and is thus one of the most popular sights in the park.\n\nThey turned it into Mount Vesuvius.\n\nMount Vesuvius is a volcano near Naples, Italy. It is the only volcano on the European mainland that has erupted within the past century (its last eruption was in 1944).

Typical effects include walking on various surfaces to simulate the sound of footsteps, and hitting or smashing various objects, such as melons or a cut of beef, to simulate the sound of blows in a fight scene.\n\n[Sung.] Somewhere …\n\nThis is the opening to the song “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” from The Wizard of Oz (1939). Sample lyrics: “Somewhere over the rainbow/Way up high/There’s a land that I heard of/Once in a lullaby.”\n\nKilled in Vietnam.\n\nWhen the nostalgia junket that is American Graffiti (1973) ends, an epilogue over the cast photos jarringly informs you of their fates: one killed by a drunk driver, one MIA in Vietnam, one an insurance agent in Modesto, and one a writer in Canada. Animal House (1978) also tells you that one of its cast (Doug Neidermeyer) is killed in Vietnam, but it’s played for laughs. Assuming you think “killed by his own troops” is funny.\n\nMany of the Mercury players have never been in films before. Here are some of them.\n\nThe Mercury Theatre was a theater company founded by Orson Welles and John Houseman in the 1930s. It started as a stage troupe and beginning in 1938 it became a radio show, Mercury Theatre on the Air. Its most famous broadcast came on October 30, 1938, with the adaptation of War of the Worlds. Players included Agnes Moorehead and Joseph Cotton, among others. (Michael Folker points out that although a similar phrase appears in the credits of Citizen Kane, the actors listed are not actually called Mercury players in that film.)"
