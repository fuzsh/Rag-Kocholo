        "text": "Michael Dell, the billionaire Texan who founded Dell Technologies, has pledged $36 million of his foundation’s money to help disaster relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.\n\nThe gift from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation is the largest donation to date aimed at recovery efforts.\n\nMr. Dell was born in Houston, and the neighborhood where he grew up, Meyerland, was flooded by the storm.\n\n“This is our home,” he said in a statement. “It will take all of us working together, over the long term, to rebuild our Texas communities.”\n\nAs the scope of the devastation has become more clear in recent days, many companies have pledged to fund recovery efforts, including some of the big corporations who have benefited from Houston’s business-friendly policies.\n\nVerizon has pledged $10 million and Toyota $3 million. But Mr. Dell hopes to eventually raise $100 million.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
