        "text": "Michael Dell, the mastermind behind the eponymous PC label established in 1984, has since elevated his brainchild into one of the most prominent technology companies worldwide. His net worth, as of 2023, stands at a staggering US$53 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nDell has four kids with his wife Susan. The family has kept a low profile over the years, raising their children – Alexa, Zachary, Juliette and Kira – out of the public eye. One particular member of the Dell clan has been generating headlines since she was just 18 years old though.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the second eldest heir to the Dell fortune, Alexa Dell.\n\nAlexa Dell grew up in “The Castle”\n\nAlexa grew up with her family in a 33,000 sq ft home in Austin, Texas, about a 30km drive away from Round Rock, per The Real Deal. The sprawling estate is referred to by locals as “The Castle” and features 13 bathrooms, high security, a tennis court, indoor and outdoor pools, and views of Lake Austin. The same source states that Michael also owns another property nearby, 6D Ranch, and other homes including a US$100 million condo on Billionaire’s Row in Manhattan and a US$40 million Four Seasons penthouse in Boston.\n\nA flair for fashion\n\nA quick peep at Alexa’s Instagram page shows her keen eye for style. From Valentino summer dresses and Fendi outerwear to being fully decked in Dior, the 29-year-old fashionista pays attention to her wardrobe and the latest in-vogue trends. As a high school student, she also spent her summers working at fashion houses, per Insider, and her LinkedIn stated that she worked previously interned at Conde Nast’s W magazine in New York.\n\nShe appeared on #RichKidsofInstagram\n\nThe source added that Alexa had been documenting her every move on Twitter via GPS locations from her phone. This ended up as a wake-up call for Alexa, who shared her experiences years later in an interview with Insider, commenting, “It’s unfortunate because it obviously put my family at risk and our safety.” Alexa returned to social media soon after the incident, per The Independent.\n\nShe’s an equestrian\n\nIt seems that equestrianism is a sport that many of the world’s wealthiest individuals simply can’t do without, and Alexa is no exception. Her social media posts indicate a deep-seated affection for horses and the gear that accompanies them. And when it comes to the latter, Alexa’s choice is none other than the venerable Hermès Sellier Paris, the luxury brand that has been providing exquisite tailoring for riders and their equine companions since 1837.\n\nShe joined Bumble … and previously dated the founder of Tinder\n\nAfter studying at Columbia University, Alexa dropped out in 2013 to start working at a dating company, per Insider. She then started a tech consulting firm. At 20, she dated Tinder CEO Sean Rad, whom she met on the app, per the same source.\n\nIt appears that dating apps hold a particular fascination for Alexa. In 2016, she joined Bumble, assuming the role of company adviser and branding consultant.\n\nShe got engaged to a millionaire property investor\n\nAlexa made headlines again in 2017, when it was revealed that she was engaged to millionaire property mogul Harrison Refoua. He reportedly proposed with a 12-carat diamond ring worth up to US$3 million.\n\nWhilst it’s unclear whether the lovebirds have tied the knot yet, as there haven’t been any new public posts of them together, Alexa did welcome a baby boy in 2019.\n\nHer A-list circles\n\nOther celebrities she’s hung with include supermodel Cindy Crawford.\n\nShe looks up to her dad\n\nHaving a billionaire father to learn from certainly has its perks. “The advice that he’s given me is that hard work is really the foundation of success,” Alexa told Insider. She also described that growing up with him was like “having a front seat to the master class” and that ultimately she was inspired by her father to move into tech. “The idea is that if we can make the world a smaller place with technology, we can really exponentially expand the boundaries of innovation and what’s possible within the world,” Alexa said."
