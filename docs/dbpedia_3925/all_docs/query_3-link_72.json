        "text": "IT IS not hard to see why each year 6,000 Californians migrate to the capital of Texas. Austin, a city of about 600,000 people (with a further 400,000 in neighbouring towns), is just as rich, liberal and hip as northern California, but a lot easier to live in. The sort of house that would cost $500,000 in Palo Alto goes for just $150,000. Austin's public-sector schools are better. And despite complaints about its infrastructure (“The traffic lights aren't even synchronised,” moans one Motorola man), it is far easier to get around than Silicon Valley, and the air is noticeably cleaner."
