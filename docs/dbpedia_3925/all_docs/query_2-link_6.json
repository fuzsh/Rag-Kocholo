        "text": "Michael Dell appears to be showing Boston the blue screen of death.\n\nThe tech billionaire listed his condominium at 1 Franklin Street for $10.9 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. That’s the same price Dell, the chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, paid for the Millenium Tower penthouse in 2016, when the development was completed.\n\nDell’s unit is on the 59th floor of the 60-story, 440-unit skyscraper in Boston’s Financial District. The 4,100-square-foot unit has three bedrooms, a terrace and tall windows with views of the city and the harbor. The unit also comes with two parking spaces.\n\nGibson Sotheby’s International Realty’s Michael Carucci has the listing.\n\nThe luxury listing adds to Dell’s pattern in the city.\n\nDell in July put his condo two miles away at the Four Seasons Private Residences One Dalton Street in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood on the market. Dell paid $34 million for the unit in 2020 and listed it for $35 million, making it one of the most expensive homes available in the city.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nTracy Campion of Campion and Company has the Back Bay listing.\n\nDell’s home portfolio includes a $100 million duplex penthouse atop Extell Development’s One57 in Manhattan, a sprawling mansion in the Austin area and a four-acre compound in Hawaii.\n\nBeyond his legendary status in the tech world, Dell has risen as a real estate figure with his firm, MSD Partners. In Boston, it contributed to a $1 billion debt package to refinance the 36-story State Street Tower office skyscraper.\n\nIn New York, the company put together more than $1 billion in loans to refinance a skyscraper in Times Square and back a historic office-to-residential conversion. The firm is also active in markets including Miami and Austin.\n\nMSD also provided a $285 million loan to CGI Merchant Group for its acquisition of the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., debt CGI defaulted on this month."
