        "text": "Dell Technologies is now the Official Technology Sponsor of the Texas Longhorns\n\nAUSTIN, Texas – The University of Texas Athletics and Dell Technologies have announced today a multi-year relationship that establishes Dell as the Official Technology Sponsor, expanding a longstanding relationship between The University of Texas and Dell Technologies.\n\n“Dell Technologies has deep roots in Austin and with The University of Texas, beginning almost 40 years ago when Michael Dell started the company in his UT dorm room,” said Liz Matthews, Senior Vice President of Global Brand & Creative at Dell Technologies. “We are thrilled to continue to invest in our hometown and be a part of UT’s rich tradition of athletics. It’s a huge part of what makes Austin, Austin.”\n\nTexas Athletics will integrate leading edge solutions from Dell Technologies to power its gameday stats across all teams and competition venues. Through the expanded relationship, Dell will have promotional rights to co-brand with the iconic Texas Longhorns logo at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, the new Moody Center, and through official digital and social media platforms. Dell also will have significant designations at Moody Center as the founding partner to the men’s and women’s basketball teams’ future home.\n\n“With this expansion of our sponsor relationship with Dell Technologies, we are able to further enhance our student-athlete and fan experience,” UT Vice President and Athletics Director Chris Del Conte said. “The support of our sponsors is critical to our objective of being the nation’s premiere collegiate athletics department.”\n\nOn November 26, 2021, when Texas football hosts Kansas State, Dell Technologies will celebrate the researchers from the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), who have been powering discoveries across science and engineering for 20 years. TACC began with humble roots in 2001 with a hand-me-down computing cluster. Today TACC stands at the pinnacle of academic supercomputing in partnership with Dell Technologies and the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\n“Two decades ago, UT and Dell made a big bet on TACC and supercomputing,” said UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. “And, given the proliferation of data science, AI and machine learning across fields and throughout society, there’s no limit to TACC’s impact over the next 20 years.”\n\n“What Starts Here, Changes the World certainly is the case with the partnership between Texas Athletics and Dell Technologies,” said Chris Ogbonnaya, Senior Consultant, Dell Technolgies Global Sponsorships. “As a former University of Texas student-athlete and now Dell employee, I am thrilled to bring together two Austin institutions to have an even greater impact on our community and the world.”\n\nAll aspects of the longstanding relationship between Texas Athletics and Dell Technologies are managed by Longhorn Sports Properties, the university’s athletics multimedia rightsholder and locally based LEARFIELD team.\n\nAbout TACC\n\nThe Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) designs and operates some of the world’s most powerful computing resources. The center’s mission is to enable discoveries that advance science and society through the application of advanced computing technologies.\n\nAbout Dell Technologies\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) helps organizations and individuals build their digital future and transform how they work, live, and play. The company provides customers with the industry’s broadest and most innovative technology and services portfolio for the data era.\n\nAbout Longhorn Sports Properties"
