His father was a stockbroker and an orthodontist and his mother was a money manager. Two things inspired Dell more than anything; the first came to his parents and the second was business. Dell once confessed that he had craved computers as well as the stock market. At the early age of eight, he sat for a high school equivalency exam in the hope to venture into business. He did his schooling at Herod Elementary School in Houston, Texas</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a teenager, Dell kept doing several part-time jobs from where he would collect money to invest in precious metal and stocks business. At the age of 12, he operated a mail-order trading business for stamps and baseball cards and earned $2,000. At the age of 14, he received his first computer Apple II and studied details on how it worked and developed a knack for computers. During his studies at Memorial High School, he worked part-time as a marketing executive for the Houston Post and learned some precious selling strategies. He used to make cold calls and learned that the newlywed couples or newcomers in the area were easy-to-convert prospects.

Dell registered the company PC&rsquo;s Ltd which was run from a condo, selling $70,000+ worth of PC&rsquo;s and PC upgrades. In May of the same year, Dell was forced to relocate to bigger premises as well as incorporating the company to become Dell Computer Corporation.
