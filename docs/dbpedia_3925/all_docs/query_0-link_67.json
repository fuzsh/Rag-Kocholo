        "text": "Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell computers, plans to spend more time jetting from Austin to Boston. The Texas tycoon recently bought a $10.9 million luxury penthouse in the newly built Millennium Tower in Boston, according to the Austin Business Journal. The purchase was made by an LLC that reportedly belongs to him.\n\nThe Journal noted that Dell, whose net worth is a cool $20.7 billion, plans to keep his residence in Texas. However, he’ll be spending more time in the Bay State now that his company’s $67 billion acquisition of Massachusetts-based EMC Corp. is complete.\n\nThe building is located in Boston’s Downtown Crossing, and luxury residences in the tower’s “penthouse collection” are moving fast. A three-bedroom, 4.5-bath penthouse sold for $11,995,000 on Oct. 31, and a four-bedroom, 4.5-bath penthouse unit closed for $11.2 million on Nov. 4.\n\nDell’s penthouse is on the 59th floor and has three bedrooms, 4.5 baths, and floor-to-ceiling windows in every room.\n\nThere’s also a private terrace, a gas fireplace, and wide-plank wood and marble flooring. The unit comes with two parking spaces.\n\nThe glass high-rise, at 60 stories, is one of the tallest buildings in the city. It offers high-end amenities, including 24/7 concierge service, doormen, a screening room, a fitness facility, and a lap pool. Residents began moving in to the luxury tower in July 2016.\n\nThe building “sets the new standard for elegance and ultra-luxury offerings in New England,” says Richard Baumert, partner at Millennium Partners, which developed the building. “It affords residents the opportunity to indulge in the luxurious services and amenities of a five-star hotel, all from the comforts of their home in the sky,”\n\nWith Dell’s purchase, the Millennium Tower has a sold status topping 95% this month. The available inventory is shrinking, so you have to buy now if you’d like to rub elbows with Beantown’s elite."
