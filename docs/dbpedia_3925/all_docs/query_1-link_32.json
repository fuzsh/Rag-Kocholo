        "text": "“Come to the edge.\n\nWe might fall.\n\nCome to the edge.\n\nIt’s too high!\n\nCOME TO THE EDGE!\n\nAnd they came,\n\nAnd he pushed,\n\nAnd they flew”\n\n-Christopher Logue\n\nWouldn’t we all like to fly? But who amongst us are really willing to take the fall? Thankfully for Austin, Texas and for the future of technology development worldwide, Michael Dell was willing to take that fall!\n\nFrom a guy in his dorm room to an indisputable genius executive in charge of the world’s leading tech giant, Dell has inspired generations of Texans, including yours truly.\n\nI still remember the first time I met a couple of executive fanboys of Dell Computers at a film studio in California. In the early 90’s, I was fresh out of college and starting my career in enterprise software and clone computers sales. One of my major software sales accounts was a mid-sized movie studio based in California. This studio was a big fan of Dell Computers, even though they had never owned one.\n\nSince I was from Texas, they assumed I knew everything about Dell Computers and would naturally be selling them instead of the boring homogeneous knockoffs my company sold with our software products. People wanted Dell for its name and service. The legacy of excellence Dell started, impacted and inspired me to find a career path that sold excellence & vision instead of mediocrity. For that I am very grateful.\n\nFrom Dorm room to Dominance:\n\nIn the 1980s, Austin was a bastion for struggling musicians and songwriters seeking recognition and trying to launch their careers outside of Nashville. Aside from the music scene and some nascent companies in high-tech, there wasn’t anything remotely close to a large technology employer in Austin, until a young entrepreneur started assembling computers in his dorm room at UT. It’s truly amazing that he was able to take a singular idea to the levels he has, and it revolutionized an entire industry. His ability to anticipate change, innovate, and hire the right leaders has grown Dell into a juggernaut of the tech market.\n\nDell.com – Staying on top of the internet revolution!\n\nIn 1994, already a major player in the PC market, Dell saw an opportunity to expand his company and make his products accessible worldwide. Dell knew that the internet would soon revolutionize the way commerce was conducted worldwide and he quickly adapted. Dell launched its website and today counts almost 50% of its revenue from direct sales at www.dell.com. Dell showed adaptability & the ability to anticipate major market changes.\n\nSince then, Dell Computers not only has become one of the world’s largest PC makers, creating thousands of jobs worldwide, but in process changed the city of Austin and the State of Texas forever. Dell attracts countless people every year into one of the fastest growing large metropolitan areas in the country.\n\nEMC - $67 billion dollar bet\n\nIn October of 2015, Dell stepped to the edge once again. He agreed to buy EMC Corp for $67 billion dollars, making it the largest technology acquisition in the history. The buyout is part of Dell’s bigger vision of investing in enterprise technology and breaking the company’s reliance on the flattening PC market. The shift to storage and security is indeed the future of the tech market as storage is the massive, critical sector in IT now. In a quarterly meeting with EMC, David Goulden, CEO of EMC Information Infrastructure concluded that post-merger, there will be substantial new jobs created in addition to 170,000 employees worldwide. That’s great news given the other global economic indicators, and a great boon for Texas.\n\nRight Leadership – Rory Read\n\nDays after announcing the EMC buyout, Dell's COO and President of Worldwide Commercial Sales, Rory Read, was named \"Chief Integration Officer\" and tasked with leading the biggest tech integration in history. Rory has a wealth of global operations experience. He served as a CEO and President of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. before joining Dell Computers as COO and eventually leading the integration of Dell and EMC. Much like Michael, Rory is a passionate leader who understands customers, employees and market trends. He is a proven leader with an impressive record of driving profitable growth and he will do a great job integrating both organizations. Rory is another example of Dell’s history of hiring the right people in the right role, at the right time. It will exciting to see how his leadership will impact the global organization in the long term.\n\nSpirit of Texas:\n\nA company that started out in a dorm room to emerge as top PC producer and is now a global powerhouse, Dell shares the spirit of Texas! Texas is an economic powerhouse because it is a place where many talented people, entrepreneurs, and companies have come together and called it home. Dell no doubt has been one of those great Texas success stories. As the above poem illustrates, If you have a good idea, it pays to take the fall!\n\nAside from building his vision and creating jobs, Michael Dell and Susan Dell have been engaged in large scale philanthropy through their Dell foundation since 2000. That foundation has given nearly $1 billion to charitable causes, both globally and in the U.S., mainly focusing on childhood health, urban education, family economic stability and the Austin community. In a world that demonizes the wealthy, Dell’s generosity demonstrates exceptional commitment to others and a desire to do good in the world.\n\nDell is one of the more accessible large foundations and accepts grant applications on an ongoing basis via its website. http://www.msdf.org/grants/apply/\n\nThanks to Michael Dell for inspiring me and generations of other Texans. Incidentally, no one knows where the technology industry would be if Michael Dell hadn’t been willing to take a risk. What ideas do you have that you have been sidelining? Take a risk – be willing to fall. But just think – you might fly!"
