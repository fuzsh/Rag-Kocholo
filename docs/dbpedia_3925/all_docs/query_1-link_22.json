        "text": "The first time I sat down to talk with Michael Dell, the coronavirus had not disrupted life and business around the globe.\n\nWe discussed his journey from a precocious Texas schoolboy with an interest in computers to the billionaire chief executive of one of the world’s biggest technology companies, along with his views on taxes, immigration and philanthropy.\n\nMuch has changed since then. In a follow-up conversation this week, Mr. Dell described how his company, Dell Technologies, weathered early supply chain disruptions as the virus emerged in China, and went remote. Most of Dell’s more than 150,000 employees are still working from home. And while the company has not had to carry out large-scale layoffs, many of its small business customers are struggling to make payments amid the economic disruption.\n\nOver all, however, Mr. Dell struck an optimistic tone when asked how the pandemic would shape the world in the years ahead.\n\n“While 2020 will be seen as a kind of a tragic year with economic disruption and loss of life, there’s a couple of other stories that are going on here,” Mr. Dell said. “One is, it’s kind of amazing how much business and commerce and education and health care and everything else continued while all that was going on. That would not have been the case 15 or 20 years ago.”\n\nAnd this is just the beginning, he said.\n\n“I also think that 2020 will be a year of kind of great accelerations,” he said. “We’ve kind of got a glimpse of the future here.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
