        "text": "Michael & Susan Dell Foundation Learning Center, Lakeline Station Apartments, Austin, Texas\n\nThe community Michael & Susan Dell Foundation Learning Center is on the site of the Lakeline Station Apartments. The Learning Center will be the first “net zero” commercial building in Austin, ultimately producing more energy than it consumes. Additionally, surrounding the building are metal cisterns which store rainwater harvested from the roof and a landscape which includes edible plants such as a loquat grove, sunflowers, and veggies planted in raised gardening beds for the children.\n\nIn keeping with the inspired mission of our client, Foundation Communities, the space will host after-school and summer learning programs for children as well as “English as a second language” classes. For adults, the Learning Center will also provide financial coaching, exercise and nutrition classes, and help with health insurance enrollment."
