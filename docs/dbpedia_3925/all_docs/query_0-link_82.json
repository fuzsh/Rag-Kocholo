        "text": "This Tuesday Michael Dell gave a speech at the University of Texas which I attended.\n\nI had met Michael Dell before, and from what I understand, he doesn’t particularly like public speaking. The “speech” was actually a moderated conference with a UT professor, then was opened up for Q&A.\n\nThe moderated part was not as engaging as I had hoped, because the large audience was simply watching two people talk to each other. I had more hope for the Question & Answer session, but it turned out to be rather disappointing, not from Michael Dell’s responses, but the quality of the questions being asked.\n\nSome of the interesting points I picked up from the event were:\n\n“Try not to be the smartest person in the room. If you are, find another room.”\n\nHe wakes up at 6am every morning and works out (A very common theme I’m seeing).\n\nHe did not use investors to grow Dell. I started clapping when he said this.\n\nSaid managed services may be Dell’s next big thing. For example: If Boeing doesn’t want to do all their own printing, IT support etc…Dell will take care of it all.\n\nThe way you order pretty much anything in China is: 1.) You place an order online or on the phone. 2.) You receive two numbers, an order confirmation number and a Bank of China transaction number. 3.) You take your money (Often literally a sack of money) to the Bank of China, and they transfer it to Dell."
