        "text": "From orchestral concerts to product launches to live-tapings of popular television shows, the Michael & Susan Dell Hall is as versatile as it is grand. Designed in the classic performance space tradition, the Hall seats 2,442 people in three wrap-around levels including six boxes for private viewing. Dell Hall can be adjusted for acoustic or amplified musical productions and is equipped for movie screenings, live feeds, and projection screens, making every seat – whether in the front row or in the Parterre, Mezzanine, or Balcony levels – the best seat.\n\nEvery decision that went into the design and construction of the Long Center was driven by acoustics. Our professional design team, along with acoustician Mark Holden of Jae Holden and Associates, collaborated with a wide array of arts groups in Austin to ensure the Center’s acoustics do justice to the excellence on stage. The solutions devised and implemented by Holden and the design team include strategies that are innovative yet unobtrusive.\n\nTechnical elements such as concrete shielding for the roof, acoustic banners along the walls and a custom-crafted orchestra shell protect the audience chamber from external and ambient noises like coughing, candy wrappers, traffic, and thunder. Tiered seating provides a reflective surface for sounds, allowing it to travel further. The Long Center went a step further by channeling the air conditioning through acoustically transparent floor vents to eliminate acoustic dead zones found in many large halls."
