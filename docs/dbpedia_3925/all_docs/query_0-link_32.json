        "text": "Michael Dell, founder of Round Rock-based Dell Technologies, views himself as a technology optimist and has had a front row seat for its changes in the 40 years since he founded his company.\n\n\"It's all just the preview for what's to come,\" Dell said last week at South by Southwest. \"When I think about the future role that technology will play in the world, I think about the incredible innovations that we're already starting to see in health care driven by technology. ... There's never been a better time to be alive.\"\n\nAt a session titled \"Business, Life, and the Magic of Austin\" on Thursday, Dell said these hopeful views also extend to Central Texas.\n\n\"My optimism is not just about technology,\" he said. \"Technology has played a major role in all the great things that have happened in the world and certainly here in Central Texas.\"\n\nDell Technologies is one of the largest private employers in Central Texas, with 13,000 workers in the Austin area and 133,000 worldwide. The company saw strong pandemic-era growth as people shifted to working from home and demand for its personal computers and other products boomed. But it did cut 5% of its employees in 2023 to prepare for an expected economic downturn.\n\nThe founder and CEO spoke about his company and his thoughts on entrepreneurship, business, risk-taking and Austin in the SXSW session with Austin-based analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategies.\n\nFailure is a part of learning\n\nDell founded the company when he was a freshman at the University of Texas, and he said those early days taught him about the importance of developing a team.\n\n\"You've got to surround yourself with great people, stay curious, always be learning,\" he said. \"We learned that integrity, reputation are the most valuable things and took a long, long time to build up, and it's really easy to destroy.\"\n\nDell said he was fortunate to be able to get a lot of people to join him \"on this great adventure\" and that Austin turned out to be a great place for attracting employees.\n\nFailing and making mistakes are part of the learning process, he said, and it's important to be agile and flexible. He said that at Dell Technologies it's OK to make mistakes as long as the same mistakes aren't being made twice. He views it as better to try 10 things and get six right than to try five and get all five right.\n\n\"Nobody has the right answer,\" Dell said. \"You've got to go figure it out.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence development is enormous\n\n\"It's amazing to see the rapid pace of innovation and what's going on,\" Dell said, adding that technology comes in waves, but this one seems \"bigger, more important and more significant.\"\n\nHe said technology has always been a part of \"enabling human potential,\" and while he's optimistic about AI, he acknowledged it will be hard for regulators to imagine how fast the technology is evolving.\n\nAI development must be done \"in a thoughtful way and reflect our humanity, and I believe it's going to be enormous,\" he said.\n\nMoorhead said AI will transform businesses.\n\n\"The last big opportunity out there was the internet,\" he said. \"We're at the beginning of a transition that's not only going to make a lot of waves in the tech industry but also with people and corporations.\"\n\nOn taking Dell Technologies private\n\nDell, who founded Dell Technologies in 1984 and took the company public in 1988, made it private again in 2013 before returning to the public market in 2018. In the session, he said the period when Dell Technologies was a private company brought a lot of challenges, but ultimately it helped bring the company to its latest chapter. He added that public investors don't really like volatility, so going private was a way to accelerate the company's transformation.\n\n\"We're in an industry where the pace of change is only going to accelerate,\" Dell said. \"It's a 'make quick change or die' kind of industry, and major transformations involve financial volatility.\"\n\nAustin then and now\n\nDell said he has had a front row seat to watch Central Texas grow over the past several decades, and while it has grown significantly, the region has a great combination of innovative businesses and universities that make businesses of all sizes thrive.\n\n\"I believe that entrepreneurs go where their ideas flourish and are welcomed and there's opportunity. Capital goes where it's treated well,\" Dell said. \"Turns out Texas is a great place for that. ... It's been fun playing a part in that.\"\n\nDell said Austin's natural beauty and its balance of growth, development and mobility as well as all the things that make the city special will help it remain a great place full of opportunities.\n\n\"I'm bullish on Austin and Texas,\" he said.\n\nImportance of universities 'can't be overstated'\n\nDuring his session, Dell emphasized the role the University of Texas plays in making Austin's innovation scene and companies such as Dell Technologies possible, and he said higher education institutions bring incredible resources.\n\n\"The importance of the University of Texas and the other universities in Texas really can't be overstated,\" he said. \"If you find great companies, there's always a great university nearby. There's no place in the world where that doesn't exist.\"\n\nAdvice for a 9-year-old\n\nDell answered a question about life advice from perhaps the youngest audience member, a 9-year-old.\n\n\"Learn as much as you can. Dream big. Have as many experiences and learnings as you possibly can. Prepare yourself for the future,\" Dell said. \"Find something you're interested in and curious about exploring, and hopefully parents will let you do it.\""
