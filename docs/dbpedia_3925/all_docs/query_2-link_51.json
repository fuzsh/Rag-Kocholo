        "text": "Michael Dell is unloading shares in Dell for the first time in almost three years as his company’s stock soars on artificial-intelligence optimism. Dell’s chief executive officer has been selling on a near daily basis since March 6 and has now disposed of more than 4 million shares worth about $465 million. He however still owns half of the Texas-based company, the largest asset behind his $94.2 billion fortune.\n\nDell’s shares jumped 32% on March 1 to a record high after the company reported sales and profit that beat analyst’s estimates, fuelled by demand for technology that can support AI applications. The stock gained 40% this year through Monday’s close.\n\nMichael Dell, 59, who founded the company in 1984 while a student at the University of Texas at Austin, joins a growing number of tech billionaires selling stakes in their companies. The list includes Meta Platforms Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel."
