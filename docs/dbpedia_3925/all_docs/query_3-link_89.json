        "text": "Dell Technologies CEO focused on future, not on legacy.\n\nMichael Dell is not yet ready to talk about his legacy.\n\n\"Ask me when I’m 90 or something. I’m still feeling pretty young here,\" says Dell, who at 54 has seen the company he founded in his University of Texas dorm room 35 years ago grow into one of the world's biggest technology providers, transforming from PC maker to end-to-end technology company.\n\nSitting in a conference room at Dell Technologies corporate headquarters in Round Rock, the company's billionaire founder and CEO would much prefer to focus on the here and now, rather than how history might remember him.\n\n\"We’re constantly evolving and learning and changing and ... being curious,\" Dell said. \"At the end of the day, our business is all about solving the unsolved problems that our customers have, both now and in the future.\"\n\nREAD MORE: How Dell Technologies is fighting to stay ahead of the technology curve\n\nThe American-Statesman sat down for a one-on-one interview with Dell to talk about the company's growth and evolution, its future in Central Texas — and, yes, what the long-term legacy might be for both Dell Technologies and the man who created it. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAmerican Statesman: How does Central Texas play a role in the innovation coming out of Dell, and how has the growth of Austin’s tech industry impacted innovation at Dell?\n\nMichael Dell: This is where we started, and it’s always been a great place to attract talent. People who went to school here want to stay here. People that didn’t go to school here want to come here.\n\nIf you want to find a great company, I can guarantee you there’s a great university right nearby. It doesn’t exist anywhere in the world where there’s a great company and there’s no great university right nearby. Also, if you widen the circle out — let’s say 100-mile radius — the student population grows to 150,000 or something like that with all of the universities in the area. That’s kind of the foundation of what allows us to attract and retain great talent and drive innovation.\n\nWhat are the technology trends you expect to see in the future coming out of Dell?\n\nFirst of all, technology is breaking out of its traditional box or domain. If you went into a business or a government organization or nonprofit and you say, 'What is technology?' They’d sort of talk about the IT department. Now, it’s pretty much everything. You can’t find an industry that isn’t reimagining itself given what’s happening with the explosion in data, AI, machine learning, new ways of consuming technology, AR, VR.\n\nNow, you have computers and sensors and microcontrollers, everything that has electrons going through it. So everything becomes intelligent and then it becomes connected and that creates enormous explosion in data. Every organization kind of needs to reimagine itself given all of that, and it’s a big, big change.\n\nAI is taking the cost of predicting things to zero, so a lot of industries, retail, finance, manufacturing, etc., are having to reimagine their whole business. That requires all kinds of new infrastructure, new capabilities. We’re poised to help our customers do that. We’re helping our customers do that.\n\nDo you consider Dell to be the real anchor of the Austin tech sector?\n\nWe’ll let other people decide that. There’s a lot of great companies here, and I’m sure there will be many, many more created. It’s a wonderful place to live and have as our headquarters.\n\nDo you envision significant changes to your local operations — either growth or cuts or totally moving things somewhere else?\n\nWe’re constantly evolving and learning and changing and — I think I said this in my (UT graduation) keynote — being curious. At the end of the day, our business is all about solving the unsolved problems that our customers have, both now and in the future. How did we get from Dobie dorm room to the company today? It’s by being curious and solving those unsolved problems.\n\nREAD MORE: At UT commencement, Michael Dell tells students to take risks, finish what they start\n\nOur job is to understand all of these customers’ requirements, and of course, we serve customers of all shapes and sizes and 180 countries around the world. And then our other job is to understand all of the molecular ingredients that go into technology products and solutions. It’s all of the AI, all of the photonics, all of the semiconductors, new materials, power storage systems, all of the molecular elements, and then the magic is creating the right solution at the intersection of those two things. And that’s what our 20,000-plus engineers and scientists and Ph.D.s are constantly doing. If we do that well, we’ll keep growing, and if we don’t, we’ll be gone.\n\nHas going public helped with that innovation you're trying to achieve?\n\nIt’s been almost seven years since I started the process, and the company’s transformed and evolved quite a lot. I think that period helped us accelerate the transformation. But, as I also said in my keynote, it’s a race with no finish line. We have to keep evolving and transforming. It’s just the way business works. And actually I think the pace is only accelerating.\n\nIt’s just going to go faster and faster. We got to a point last year where the public listing allowed us to simplify the capital structure and stay on offense and continue to be aggressive in gaining share and growing, so that’s what we decided to do.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, what is the ceiling for Dell Technologies in the coming years? The company did about $91 billion in revenue last fiscal year. Obviously $100 billion is in reach. Do you expect someday to reach $200 billion, or $500 billion?\n\nWe don’t make projections like that externally. We have all kinds of projection internally, but we don’t make them externally. At our annual financial analyst meeting we kind of give a framework for how we think about the business. But certainly we expect we’ll continue to grow.\n\nWith the growth and change and acquisitions in recent years, how close is Dell Technologies now to being the end-to-end technology company you envisioned and wanted it to be?\n\nAgain, from my commencement speech: Pleased but not satisfied. It’s something that people around here are used to hearing a lot. Certainly, if I look over the last 35 years, there’s a lot to be proud of. We won’t deny that, but I also think that our industry is just getting started in terms of its impact on the world and the opportunities that we have to make a positive difference with technology are just beginning. I still spend 99.99% of my time thinking about the future, not that past.\n\nI believe we are the best positioned in our industry and far more capable than any of our competitors in being able to do that. We have lots of opportunities to expand in adjacent areas, and we continue to pursue that organic growth, inorganic growth. And again, back to this broader theme, the role of technology continues to expand.\n\nWhat do you think the company's current legacy is, and what do you ultimately want it to be for Dell Technologies?\n\nMaybe we’re a little bit young to be talking about legacy. I mean, look, I think we’ve created a great business for sure.\n\nWe make products and services, and we do all of these things for customers. ... But I actually think the culture we’ve created inside the company might be the most important thing of all because it’s the thing that allows us to create all of the products and services. And that, I think, has lasting resonance and repeatability to it because you can look at any given product and say, ‘Oh, that’s a great product. It has No. 1 share in the world and all these customers buy it. Isn’t that a great thing?’ But how did that come to be? It came into being from the culture.\n\nI also think certainly there’s a reverberation in terms of the philanthropic impact that the companies made. Certainly our family set up a substantial foundation and while it does work all over the world, it does a lot of work here in Austin and across Texas. That’s certainly something to be very proud of.\n\nMany tech companies are expanding in Austin, including Apple Inc., which recently announced it is opening a new campus. What does this technology growth in Austin mean for Dell?\n\nYou know, this has been going on for some time with companies expanding here and growing here. I think it’s great for Austin. What we’ve seen is, I think, that most large tech companies is the way you go is not by hiring people from other companies, but you hire people right out of school. So we haven’t actually seen a tremendous number of people moving back and forth in that sense. And certainly, we hired several thousand people last year on a global basis. A very high percentage of them were what we consider early career, which includes graduates and people that are in their first two or three years.\n\nBack to this question of legacy: What do you see as your legacy as a business leader? Do you believe you're included among the greatest technology innovators?\n\nAsk me when I’m 90 or something. I’m still feeling pretty young here.\n\nWell, I would let other people decide that. I’m certainly very proud of what we’ve been building here at the company, what our family has been doing with our foundation. Those are certainly two notable things to be proud of."
