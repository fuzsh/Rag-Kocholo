        "text": "From Dell to Tesla, Austin has a burgeoning reputation as a Southern money-maker. Here are the 10 richest people who live in the city.\n\nCould Texas' capital be trading in its weirdness for wealth? The latest Forbes 400 list might help answer that question.\n\nFrom Dell to Tesla, Austin has a burgeoning reputation as a bastion for Southern money-makers. In the past 10 years alone, the city's millionaire population has grown 110%, and with more investment coming, that trend doesn't look as if it will slow anytime soon.\n\nHowever, in those 10 years, Austin has also become more alluring to the wealthiest of the wealthy, as its billionaire population now tops many states across the country. So who are these exorbitantly wealthy individuals, and why is Austin, and the rest of the Lone Star State, such an intriguing destination for them?\n\nWho are Austin's richest residents?\n\nThe 2023 Forbes \"400 Richest People in America\" list shows that Austin is home to 10 billionaires. This ranks it as the city with the 10th-highest billionaire population — although it is third in Texas behind Houston and Dallas.\n\nAs wealth continues to surge in Austin, here are the 10 richest people who call the city home, how they make their money and where they rank on the Forbes 400 list:\n\nElon Musk, first (Tesla, Space X, Boring Co.)\n\nMichael Dell, 11th (Dell Technologies)\n\nRobert F. Smith, 89th (private equity)\n\nJoe Gebbia, 96th (Airbnb)\n\nBert \"Tito\" Beveridge, 140th (Tito's Vodka)\n\nThai Lee, 204th (SHI International)\n\nJoe Liemandt, 215th (Trilogy)\n\nHayes Barnard, 304th (GoodLeap)\n\nDrayton McLane, 366th (McLane Group)\n\nJohn Paul Dejoria, 379th (Paul Mitchell, Patrón)\n\nWhich U.S. cities have the most billionaires?\n\nFrom coast-dwelling metros to ritzy beach havens to Southern cities trending upward, here are the 10 U.S. cities with the most billionaires in their area:\n\nSan Francisco, 68\n\nNew York, 60\n\nLos Angeles, 43\n\nChicago, 24\n\nHouston, 18\n\nDallas, 15\n\nMiami, 15\n\nWashington, 12\n\nSeattle, 11\n\nAustin, 10\n\nWhich states have the most billionaires?\n\nSome states have a pedigree for wealth and economic innovation, and perhaps the top four states on this list are predictable. However, from the fifth spot onward, there is a steep dropoff in billionaire population. Here are the states with the most billionaires:\n\nCalifornia, 186\n\nNew York, 135\n\nFlorida, 78\n\nTexas, 73\n\nIllinois, 23\n\nMassachusetts, 22\n\nPennsylvania, 18\n\nGeorgia, 18\n\nNevada, 17\n\nConnecticut, 13\n\nWashington, 13\n\nWhy does Texas have so many billionaires?\n\nThere is no way to determine why so many billionaires call Texas home; however, a few trends are worth mentioning. Texas is one of only nine states that does not have a state income tax, which makes it an appealing location for high-wealth individuals.\n\nTexas is also home to many of the most populous metro areas in America, such as San Antonio, Dallas, Houston and Austin. This naturally lends itself to innovation as Texas is home to the most Fortune 500 companies of any state with 55.\n\nBeck Andrew Salgado covers trending topics in the Austin business ecosystem for the American-Statesman.
