        "text": "Austin tech billionaire Michael Dell has completed his purchase of properties in Dallas' popular Knox Street neighborhood.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News first reported in January that a Dell family investment arm was planning to purchase more than a dozen buildings and land in the retail and business district on the eastern edge of Highland Park.\n\nAn affiliate of Dell's family investment firm — MSD Capital — completed the acquisition this week, county deed records show.\n\n\"We are excited to add this extraordinary property to MSD Capital's real estate portfolio,\" Coburn Packard, co-head of MSD Capital's real estate group, said in a statement. \"Together with The Retail Connection L.P. and our other partners, the MSD team looks forward to working with our neighbors to further enhance what already is regarded to be the premier street retail district in Dallas.\"\n\nTerms of the huge purchase were not disclosed but were estimated at as much as $250 million in value.\n\nDallas-based retail brokerage and development firm The Retail Connection teamed with Dell on the acquisition, which includes several blocks along Knox and Travis streets and McKinney and Cole avenues.\n\nRetail Connection CEO and co-founder Steve Lieberman has a personal connection to the Dell family. His sister, Susan Lynn Lieberman Dell, is Michael Dell's wife.\n\nThe purchase from longtime Knox Street player Sarofim Realty Advisors includes buildings that house Crate & Barrel, Pottery Barn, Z Gallerie, On the Border restaurant and other high-profile retail tenants.\n\nAlso in the sale is a six-story apartment and retail building at Cole and Armstrong avenues that houses grocer Trader Joe's.\n\nThe properties with more than 170,000 square feet of retail space, 165 luxury apartments and 11 acres of land were put up for sale last year by Sarofim.\n\nHolliday Fenoglio Fowler LP marketed the properties for sale.\n\nThe purchase was funded by a subsidiary of New York-based Blackstone Mortgage Trust, deed records show.\n\nLocated between East Dallas and the Park Cities, Knox Street has been a popular retail and business district for decades. Sarofim spent more 20 years acquiring property in the Knox Street neighborhood and building.\n\nDell is founder of Austin-based information technology firm Dell Technologies.\n\nMSD Capital is a private investment firm that was established in 1998 to exclusively manage the capital of Dell and his family. The firm manages assets valued at over $15 billion.\n\nThe New York-based company does direct investment in properties, provides real estate financing and invests in partnerships with other owners. The Dell company has invested in a wide range of properties, from Manhattan retail and office space to apartments in Florida.\n\n\"This investment represents a continuation of MSD Capital's longstanding strategy of investing in irreplaceable real estate in dynamic, growing markets,\" said Barry Sholem, co-head of MSD Capital's real estate group.\n\nThe Retail Connection, one of Texas' largest retail services and development firms, has been in business since 2003. The company represents over 30 million square feet of commercial real estate.\n\nRetail Connection was a partner in the recent $40 million redevelopment of the 30-acre Village on the Parkway shopping center on Dallas North Tollway in Addison. The company also developed the Arlington Highlands shopping center and has projects across the state."
