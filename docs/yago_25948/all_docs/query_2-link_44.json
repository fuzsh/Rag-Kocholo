        "text": "As we said in our Scottish new releases round-up for January, it’s been over three years since Josephine Sillars’ last release, and she’ll be pleased to hear we've not forgotten her. Originally from the Scottish Highlands, and now based in Leeds, Sillars releases new track Enemy tomorrow. With a more mature sound than on her previous releases, the single explores the kind of anxieties a lot of us likely experience day to day, as she worries that if she stops, people will forget who she is.\n\nMade with the support of Help Musicians' Do It Differently fund, it’s the first taste of what we can expect from her forthcoming Desperate Characters EP, currently slated for release on 26 March. “Enemy was inspired by the soundbite you hear at the end of the song: ‘I know that I've felt this, and I assume I'm not alone but I've often worried about, if I stop everyone will forget who I am’,” Sillars explains of the track’s foundations. “That's a worry that I have definitely felt, and the track evolved from that feeling of fear into the realisation that a lot of time, those thoughts and fears are self-inflicted and not a reflection of reality.\n\n“I’m excited for people to hear this track because musically it’s pretty different to anything I’ve released before. It definitely has a more trip-hop influence than my older music and I'm super proud of it. Enemy was written with my bandmate Kieran Watson, and I wrote the lyrics last, which is the opposite to how I normally write. We had been listening to a lot of Björk that day.”\n\nThe Skinny are delighted to be premiering Enemy, which you can listen to in the below SoundCloud player (click here if it’s not displaying correctly)."
