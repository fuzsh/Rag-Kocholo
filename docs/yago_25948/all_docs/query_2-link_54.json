        "text": "A Desperate Character\n\nA DESPERATE CHARACTER\n\nI\n\n... We were a party of eight in the room, and we were talking of\n\ncontemporary affairs and men.\n\n'I don't understand these men!' observed A.: 'they're such desperate\n\nfellows.... Really desperate.... There has never been anything like\n\nit before.'\n\n'Yes, there has,' put in P., a man getting on in years, with grey hair,\n\nborn some time in the twenties of this century: 'there were desperate\n\ncharacters in former days too, only they were not like the desperate\n\nfellows of to-day. Of the poet Yazikov some one has said that he had\n\nenthusiasm, but not applied to anything--an enthusiasm without an\n\nobject. So it was with those people--their desperateness was without an\n\nobject. But there, if you'll allow me, I'll tell you the story of my\n\nnephew, or rather cousin, Misha Poltyev. It may serve as an example of\n\nthe desperate characters of those days.\n\nHe came into God's world, I remember, in 1828, at his father's native\n\nplace and property, in one of the sleepiest corners of a sleepy province\n\nof the steppes. Misha's father, Andrei Nikolaevitch Poltyev, I remember\n\nwell to this day. He was a genuine old-world landowner, a God-fearing,\n\nsedate man, fairly--for those days--well educated, just a little\n\ncracked, to tell the truth--and, moreover, he suffered from epilepsy....\n\nThat too is an old-world, gentlemanly complaint.... Andrei\n\nNikolaevitch's fits were, however, slight, and generally ended in sleep\n\nand depression. He was good-hearted, and of an affable demeanour, not\n\nwithout a certain stateliness: I always pictured to myself the tsar\n\nMihail Fedorovitch as like him. The whole life of Andrei Nikolaevitch\n\nwas passed in the punctual fulfilment of every observance established\n\nfrom old days, in strict conformity with all the usages of the old\n\northodox holy Russian mode of life. He got up and went to bed, ate his\n\nmeals, and went to his bath, rejoiced or was wroth (both very rarely, it\n\nis true), even smoked his pipe and played cards (two great\n\ninnovations!), not after his own fancy, not in a way of his own, but\n\naccording to the custom and ordinance of his fathers--with due decorum\n\nand formality. He was tall, well built, and stout; his voice was soft\n\nand rather husky, as is so often the case with virtuous people in\n\nRussia; he was scrupulously neat in his dress and linen, and wore white\n\ncravats and full-skirted snuff-coloured coats, but his noble blood was\n\nnevertheless evident; no one could have taken him for a priest's son or\n\na merchant! At all times, on all possible occasions, and in all possible\n\ncontingencies, Andrei Nikolaevitch knew without fail what ought to be\n\ndone, what was to be said, and precisely what expressions were to be\n\nused; he knew when he ought to take medicine, and just what he ought to\n\ntake; what omens were to be believed and what might be disregarded ...\n\nin fact, he knew everything that ought to be done.... For as everything\n\nhad been provided for and laid down by one's elders, one had only to be\n\nsure not to imagine anything of one's self.... And above all, without\n\nGod's blessing not a step to be taken!--It must be confessed that a\n\ndeadly dulness reigned supreme in his house, in those low-pitched, warm,\n\ndark rooms, that so often resounded with the singing of liturgies and\n\nall-night services, and had the smell of incense and Lenten dishes\n\nalmost always hanging about them!\n\nAndrei Nikolaevitch--no longer in his first youth--married a young\n\nlady of a neighbouring family, without fortune, a very nervous and\n\nsickly person, who had had a boarding-school education. She played the\n\npiano fairly, spoke boarding-school French, was easily moved to\n\nenthusiasm, and still more easily to melancholy and even tears....\n\nShe was of unbalanced character, in fact. She regarded her life as\n\nwasted, could not care for her husband, who, 'of course,' did not\n\nunderstand her; but she respected him, ... she put up with him; and\n\nbeing perfectly honest and perfectly cold, she never even dreamed of\n\nanother 'affection.' Besides, she was always completely engrossed in\n\nthe care, first, of her own really delicate health, secondly, of the\n\nhealth of her husband, whose fits always inspired in her something\n\nlike superstitious horror, and lastly, of her only son, Misha, whom\n\nshe brought up herself with great zeal. Andrei Nikolaevitch did not\n\noppose his wife's looking after Misha, on the one condition of his\n\neducation never over-stepping the lines laid down, once and for all,\n\nwithin which everything must move in his house! Thus, for instance, at\n\nChristmas-time, and at New Year, and St. Vassily's eve, it was\n\npermissible for Misha to dress up and masquerade with the servant\n\nboys--and not only permissible, but even a binding duty.... But, at\n\nany other time, God forbid! and so on, and so on.\n\nII\n\nI remember Misha at thirteen. He was a very pretty boy, with rosy little\n\ncheeks and soft lips (indeed he was soft and plump-looking all over),\n\nwith prominent liquid eyes, carefully brushed and combed, caressing and\n\nmodest--a regular little girl! There was only one thing about him I did\n\nnot like: he rarely laughed; but when he did laugh, his teeth--large\n\nwhite teeth, pointed like an animal's--showed disagreeably, and the\n\nlaugh itself had an abrupt, even savage, almost animal sound, and there\n\nwere unpleasant gleams in his eyes. His mother was always praising him\n\nfor being so obedient and well behaved, and not caring to make friends\n\nwith rude boys, but always preferring feminine society. 'A mother's\n\ndarling, a milksop,' his father, Andrei Nikolaevitch, would call him;\n\n'but he's always ready to go into the house of God.... And that I am\n\nglad to see.' Only one old neighbour, who had been a police captain,\n\nonce said before me, speaking of Misha, 'Mark my words, he'll be a\n\nrebel.' And this saying, I remember, surprised me very much at the time.\n\nThe old police captain, it is true, used to see rebels on all sides.\n\nJust such an exemplary youth Misha continued to be till the eighteenth\n\nyear of his age, up to the death of his parents, both of whom he lost\n\nalmost on the same day. As I was all the while living constantly at\n\nMoscow, I heard nothing of my young kinsman. An acquaintance coming from\n\nhis province did, it is true, inform me that Misha had sold the paternal\n\nestate for a trifling sum; but this piece of news struck me as too\n\nwildly improbable! And behold, all of a sudden, one autumn morning there\n\nflew into the courtyard of my house a carriage, with a pair of splendid\n\ntrotting horses, and a coachman of monstrous size on the box; and in the\n\ncarriage, wrapped in a cloak of military cut, with a beaver collar two\n\nyards deep, and with a foraging cap cocked on one side, _� la diable\n\nm'emporte_, sat ... Misha! On catching sight of me (I was standing at\n\nthe drawing-room window, gazing in astonishment at the flying equipage),\n\nhe laughed his abrupt laugh, and jauntily flinging back his cloak, he\n\njumped out of the carriage and ran into the house.\n\n'Misha! Mihail Andreevitch!' I was beginning, ... 'Is it you?'\n\n'Call me Misha,'--he interrupted me. 'Yes, it's I, ... I, in my own\n\nperson.... I have come to Moscow ... to see the world ... and show\n\nmyself. And here I am, come to see you. What do you say to my\n\nhorses?... Eh?' he laughed again.\n\nThough it was seven years since I had seen Misha last, I recognised him\n\nat once. His face had remained just as youthful and as pretty as\n\never--there was no moustache even visible; only his cheeks looked a\n\nlittle swollen under his eyes, and a smell of spirits came from his\n\nlips. 'Have you been long in Moscow?' I inquired.\n\n'I supposed you were at home in the country, looking after the\n\nplace.' ...\n\n'Eh! The country I threw up at once! As soon as my parents died--may\n\ntheir souls rest in peace--(Misha crossed himself scrupulously, without\n\na shade of mockery) at once, without a moment's delay, ... _ein, zwei,\n\ndrei!_ ha, ha! I let it go cheap, damn it! A rascally fellow turned up.\n\nBut it's no matter! Anyway, I am living as I fancy, and amusing other\n\npeople. But why are you staring at me like that? Was I, really, to go\n\ndragging on in the same old round, do you suppose? ... My dear fellow,\n\ncouldn't I have a glass of something?'\n\nMisha spoke fearfully quick and hurriedly, and, at the same time, as\n\nthough he were only just waked up from sleep.\n\n'Misha, upon my word!' I wailed; 'have you no fear of God? What do you\n\nlook like? What an attire! And you ask for a glass too! And to sell such\n\na fine estate for next to nothing....'\n\n'God I fear always, and do not forget,' he broke in.... 'But He is good,\n\nyou know--God is.... He will forgive! And I am good too.... I have\n\nnever yet hurt any one in my life. And drink is good too; and as for\n\nhurting,... it never hurt any one either. And my get-up is quite the most\n\ncorrect thing.... Uncle, would you like me to show you I can walk\n\nstraight? Or to do a little dance?'\n\n'Oh, spare me, please! A dance, indeed! You'd better sit down.'\n\n'As to that, I'll sit down with pleasure.... But why do you say nothing\n\nof my greys? Just look at them, they're perfect lions! I've got them on\n\nhire for the time, but I shall buy them for certain, ... and the\n\ncoachman too.... It's ever so much cheaper to have one's own horses. And\n\nI had the money, but I lost it yesterday at faro. It's no matter, I'll\n\nmake it up to-morrow. Uncle, ... how about that little glass?'\n\nI was still unable to get over my amazement. 'Really, Misha, how old are\n\nyou? You ought not to be thinking about horses or cards, ... but going\n\ninto the university or the service.'\n\nMisha first laughed again, then gave vent to a prolonged whistle.\n\n'Well, uncle, I see you're in a melancholy humour to-day. I'll come\n\nback another time. But I tell you what: you come in the evening to\n\nSokolniki. I've a tent pitched there. The gypsies sing, ... such\n\ngoings-on.... And there's a streamer on the tent, and on the streamer,\n\nwritten in large letters: \"The Troupe of Poltyev's Gypsies.\" The\n\nstreamer coils like a snake, the letters are of gold, attractive for\n\nevery one to read. A free entertainment--whoever likes to come! ... No\n\nrefusal! I'm making the dust fly in Moscow ... to my glory! ... Eh? will\n\nyou come? Ah, I've one girl there ... a serpent! Black as your boot,\n\nspiteful as a dog, and eyes ... like living coals! One can never tell\n\nwhat she's going to do--kiss or bite! ... Will you come, uncle? ...\n\nWell, good-bye, till we meet!'\n\nAnd with a sudden embrace, and a smacking kiss on my shoulder, Misha\n\ndarted away into the courtyard, and into the carriage, waved his cap\n\nover his head, hallooed,--the monstrous coachman leered at him over his\n\nbeard, the greys dashed off, and all vanished!\n\nThe next day I--like a sinner--set off to Sokolniki, and did actually\n\nsee the tent with the streamer and the inscription. The drapery of the\n\ntent was raised; from it came clamour, creaking, and shouting. Crowds of\n\npeople were thronging round it. On a carpet spread on the ground sat\n\ngypsies, men and women, singing and beating drums, and in the midst of\n\nthem, in a red silk shirt and velvet breeches, was Misha, holding a\n\nguitar, dancing a jig. 'Gentlemen! honoured friends! walk in, please!\n\nthe performance is just beginning! Free to all!' he was shouting in a\n\nhigh, cracked voice. 'Hey! champagne! pop! a pop on the head! pop up to\n\nthe ceiling! Ha! you rogue there, Paul de Kock!'\n\nLuckily he did not see me, and I hastily made off.\n\nI won't enlarge on my astonishment at the spectacle of this\n\ntransformation. But, how was it actually possible for that quiet and\n\nmodest boy to change all at once into a drunken buffoon? Could it all\n\nhave been latent in him from childhood, and have come to the surface\n\ndirectly the yoke of his parents' control was removed? But that he had\n\nmade the dust fly in Moscow, as he expressed it--of that, certainly,\n\nthere could be no doubt. I have seen something of riotous living in my\n\nday; but in this there was a sort of violence, a sort of frenzy of\n\nself-destruction, a sort of desperation!\n\nIII\n\nFor two months these diversions continued.... And once more I was\n\nstanding at my drawing-room window, looking into the courtyard.... All\n\nof a sudden--what could it mean? ... there came slowly stepping in at the\n\ngate a pilgrim ... a squash hat pulled down on his forehead, his hair\n\ncombed out straight to right and left below it, a long gown, a leather\n\nbelt ... Could it be Misha? He it was!\n\nI went to meet him on the steps.... 'What's this masquerade for?'\n\nI demanded.\n\n'It's not a masquerade, uncle,' Misha answered with a deep sigh: since\n\nall I had I've squandered to the last farthing--and a great repentance\n\ntoo has come upon me--so I have resolved to go to the Sergiev monastery\n\nof the Holy Trinity to expiate my sins in prayer. For what refuge was\n\nleft me? ... And so I have come to you to say good-bye, uncle, like a\n\nprodigal son.'\n\nI looked intently at Misha. His face was just the same, rosy and fresh\n\n(indeed it remained almost unchanged to the end), and the eyes, liquid,\n\naffectionate, and languishing--and the hands, as small and white.... But\n\nhe smelt of spirits.\n\n'Well,' I pronounced at last, 'it's a good thing to do--since there's\n\nnothing else to be done. But why is it you smell of spirits?'\n\n'A relic of the past,' answered Misha, and he suddenly laughed, but\n\nimmediately pulled himself up, and, making a straight, low bow--a monk's\n\nbow--he added: 'Won't you help me on my way? I'm going, see, on foot to\n\nthe monastery....'\n\n'When?'\n\n'To-day ... at once.'\n\n'Why be in such a hurry?'\n\n'Uncle, my motto always was, \"Make haste, make haste!\"'\n\n'But what is your motto now?'\n\n'It's the same now.... Only, make haste towards _good_!'\n\nAnd so Misha went off, leaving me to ponder on the vicissitudes of\n\nhuman destiny.\n\nBut he soon reminded me of his existence. Two months after his visit, I\n\ngot a letter from him, the first of those letters, of which later on he\n\nfurnished me with so abundant a supply. And note a peculiar fact: I\n\nhave seldom seen a neater, more legible handwriting than that\n\nunbalanced fellow's. And the wording of his letters was exceedingly\n\ncorrect, just a little flowery. Invariable entreaties for assistance,\n\nalways attended with resolutions to reform, vows, and promises on his\n\nhonour.... All of it seemed--and perhaps was--sincere. Misha's\n\nsignature to his letters was always accompanied by peculiar strokes,\n\nflourishes, and stops, and he made great use of marks of exclamation.\n\nIn this first letter Misha informed me of a new 'turn in his fortune.'\n\n(Later on he used to refer to these turns as plunges, ... and frequent\n\nwere the plunges he took.) He was starting for the Caucasus on active\n\nservice for his tsar and his country in the capacity of a cadet! And,\n\nthough a certain benevolent aunt had entered into his impecunious\n\nposition, and had sent him an inconsiderable sum, still he begged me to\n\nassist him in getting his equipment. I did what he asked, and for two\n\nyears I heard nothing more of him.\n\nI must own I had the gravest doubts as to his having gone to the\n\nCaucasus. But it turned out that he really had gone there, had, by\n\nfavour, got into the T---- regiment as a cadet, and had been serving in\n\nit for those two years. A perfect series of legends had sprung up there\n\nabout him. An officer of his regiment related them to me.\n\nIV\n\nI learned a great deal which I should never have expected of him.--I\n\nwas, of course, hardly surprised that as a military man, as an officer,\n\nhe was not a success, that he was in fact worse than useless; but what I\n\nhad not anticipated was that he was by no means conspicuous for much\n\nbravery; that in battle he had a downcast, woebegone air, seemed\n\nhalf-depressed, half-bewildered. Discipline of every sort worried him,\n\nand made him miserable; he was daring to the point of insanity when only\n\nhis _own personal_ safety was in question; no bet was too mad for him to\n\naccept; but do harm to others, kill, fight, he could not, possibly\n\nbecause his heart was too good--or possibly because his 'cottonwool'\n\neducation (so he expressed it), had made him too soft. Himself he was\n\nquite ready to murder in any way at any moment.... But others--no.\n\n'There's no making him out,' his comrades said of him; 'he's a flabby\n\ncreature, a poor stick--and yet such a desperate fellow--a perfect\n\nmadman!' I chanced in later days to ask Misha what evil spirit\n\ndrove him, forced him, to drink to excess, risk his life, and so\n\non. He always had one answer--'wretchedness.'\n\n'But why are you wretched?'\n\n'Why! how can you ask? If one comes, anyway, to one's self, begins to\n\nfeel, to think of the poverty, of the injustice, of Russia.... Well,\n\nit's all over with me! ... one's so wretched at once--one wants to put a\n\nbullet through one's head! One's forced to start drinking.'\n\n'Why ever do you drag Russia in?'\n\n'How can I help it? Can't be helped! That's why I'm afraid to think.'\n\n'It all comes, and your wretchedness too, from having nothing to do.'\n\n'But I don't know how to do anything, uncle! dear fellow! Take one's\n\nlife, and stake it on a card--that I can do! Come, you tell me what I\n\nought to do, what to risk my life for? This instant ... I'll ...'\n\n'But you must simply live.... Why risk your life?'\n\n'I can't! You say I act thoughtlessly.... But what else can I do? ... If\n\none starts thinking--good God, all that comes into one's head! It's only\n\nGermans who can think! ...'\n\nWhat use was it talking to him? He was a desperate man, and that's all\n\none can say.\n\nOf the Caucasus legends I have spoken about, I will tell you two or\n\nthree. One day, in a party of officers, Misha began boasting of a sabre\n\nhe had got by exchange--'a genuine Persian blade!' The officers\n\nexpressed doubts as to its genuineness. Misha began disputing. 'Here\n\nthen,' he cried at last; 'they say the man that knows most about sabres\n\nis Abdulka the one-eyed. I'll go to him, and ask.' The officers\n\nwondered. 'What Abdulka? Do you mean that lives in the mountains? The\n\nrebel never subdued? Abdul-khan?' 'Yes, that's him.' 'Why, but he'll\n\ntake you for a spy, will put you in a hole full of bugs, or else cut\n\nyour head off with your own sabre. And, besides, how are you going to\n\nget to him? They'll catch you directly.' 'I'll go to him, though, all\n\nthe same.' 'Bet you won't!' 'Taken!' And Misha promptly saddled his\n\nhorse and rode off to Abdulka. He disappeared for three days. All felt\n\ncertain that the crazy fellow had come by his end. But, behold! he came\n\nback--drunk, and with a sabre, not the one he had taken, but another.\n\nThey began questioning him. 'It was all right,' said he; 'Abdulka's a\n\nnice fellow. At first, it's true, he ordered them to put irons on my\n\nlegs, and was even on the point of having me impaled. Only, I explained\n\nwhy I had come, and showed him the sabre. \"And you'd better not keep\n\nme,\" said I; \"don't expect a ransom for me; I've not a farthing to bless\n\nmyself with--and I've no relations.\" Abdulka was surprised; he looked at\n\nme with his solitary eye. \"Well,\" said he, \"you are a bold one, you\n\nRussian; am I to believe you?\" \"You may believe me,\" said I; \"I never\n\ntell a lie.\" (And this was true; Misha never lied.) Abdulka looked at me\n\nagain. \"And do you know how to drink wine?\" \"I do,\" said I; \"give me as\n\nmuch as you will, I'll drink it.\" Abdulka was surprised again; he called\n\non Allah. And he told his--daughter, I suppose--such a pretty creature,\n\nonly with an eye like a jackal's--to bring a wine-skin. And I began to\n\nget to work on it. \"But your sabre,\" said he, \"isn't genuine; here, take\n\nthe real thing. And now we are pledged friends.\" But you've lost your\n\nbet, gentlemen; pay up.'\n\nThe second legend of Misha is of this nature. He was passionately fond\n\nof cards; but as he had no money, and could never pay his debts at cards\n\n(though he was never a card-sharper), no one at last would sit down to a\n\ngame with him. So one day he began urgently begging one of his comrades\n\namong the officers to play with him! 'But if you lose, you don't pay.'\n\n'The money certainly I can't pay, but I'll put a shot through my left\n\nhand, see, with this pistol here!' 'But whatever use will that be to\n\nme?' 'No use, but still it will be curious.' This conversation took\n\nplace after a drinking bout in the presence of witnesses. Whether it was\n\nthat Misha's proposition struck the officer as really curious--anyway he\n\nagreed. Cards were brought, the game began. Misha was in luck; he won a\n\nhundred roubles. And thereupon his opponent struck his forehead with\n\nvexation. 'What an ass I am!' he cried, 'to be taken in like this! As if\n\nyou'd have shot your hand if you had lost!--a likely story! hold out\n\nyour purse!' 'That's a lie,' retorted Misha: 'I've won--but I'll shoot\n\nmy hand.' He snatched up his pistol--and bang, fired at his own hand.\n\nThe bullet passed right through it ... and in a week the wound had\n\ncompletely healed.\n\nAnother time, Misha was riding with his comrades along a road at\n\nnight ... and they saw close to the roadside a narrow ravine like a deep\n\ncleft, dark--so dark you couldn't see the bottom. 'Look,' said one of\n\nthe officers, 'Misha may be a desperate fellow, but he wouldn't leap\n\ninto that ravine.' 'Yes, I'd leap in!' 'No, you wouldn't, for I dare say\n\nit's seventy feet deep, and you might break your neck.' His friend knew\n\nhis weak point--vanity.... There was a great deal of it in Misha. 'But\n\nI'll leap in anyway! Would you like to bet on it? Ten roubles.' 'Good!'\n\nAnd the officer had hardly uttered the word, when Misha and his horse\n\nwere off--into the ravine--and crashing down over the stones. All were\n\nsimply petrified.... A full minute passed, and they heard Misha's voice,\n\ndimly, as it were rising up out of the bowels of the earth: 'All right!\n\nfell on the sand ... but it was a long flight! Ten roubles you've lost!'\n\n'Climb out!' shouted his comrades. 'Climb out, I dare say!' echoed\n\nMisha. 'A likely story! I should like to see you climb out. You'll have\n\nto go for torches and ropes now. And, meanwhile, to keep up my spirits\n\nwhile I wait, fling down a flask....'\n\nAnd so Misha had to stay five hours at the bottom of the ravine; and\n\nwhen they dragged him out, it turned out that his shoulder was\n\ndislocated. But that in no way troubled him. The next day a bone-setter,\n\none of the black-smiths, set his shoulder, and he used it as though\n\nnothing had been the matter.\n\nHis health in general was marvellous, incredible. I have already\n\nmentioned that up to the time of his death he kept his almost childishly\n\nfresh complexion. Illness was a thing unknown to him, in spite of his\n\nexcesses; the strength of his constitution never once showed signs of\n\ngiving way. When any other man would infallibly have been seriously ill,\n\nor even have died, he merely shook himself, like a duck in the water,\n\nand was more blooming than ever. Once, also in the Caucasus ... _this_\n\nlegend is really incredible, but one may judge from it what Misha was\n\nthought to be capable of.... Well, once, in the Caucasus, in a state of\n\ndrunkenness, he fell down with the lower half of his body in a stream of\n\nwater; his head and arms were on the bank, out of water. It was\n\nwinter-time, there was a hard frost, and when he was found next morning,\n\nhis legs and body were pulled out from under a thick layer of ice, which\n\nhad formed over them in the night--and he didn't even catch cold!\n\nAnother time--this was in Russia (near Orel, and also in a time of\n\nsevere frost)--he was in a tavern outside the town in company with seven\n\nyoung seminarists (or theological students), and these seminarists were\n\ncelebrating their final examination, but had invited Misha, as a\n\ndelightful person, a man of 'inspiration,' as the phrase was then. A\n\nvery great deal was drunk, and when at last the festive party got ready\n\nto depart, Misha, dead drunk, was in an unconscious condition. All the\n\nseven seminarists together had but one three-horse sledge with a high\n\nback; where were they to stow the unresisting body? Then one of the\n\nyoung men, inspired by classical reminiscences, proposed tying Misha by\n\nhis feet to the back of the sledge, as Hector was tied to the chariot of\n\nAchilles! The proposal met with approval ... and jolting up and down\n\nover the holes, sliding sideways down the slopes, with his legs torn and\n\nflayed, and his head rolling in the snow, poor Misha travelled on his\n\nback for the mile and a half from the tavern to the town, and hadn't as\n\nmuch as a cough afterwards, hadn't turned a hair! Such heroic health had\n\nnature bestowed upon him!\n\nV\n\nFrom the Caucasus he came again to Moscow, in a Circassian dress, a\n\ndagger in his sash, a high-peaked cap on his head. This costume he\n\nretained to the end, though he was no longer in the army, from which he\n\nhad been discharged for outstaying his leave. He stayed with me,\n\nborrowed a little money ... and forthwith began his 'plunges,' his\n\nwanderings, or, as he expressed it, 'his peregrinations from pillar to\n\npost,' then came the sudden disappearances and returns, and the showers\n\nof beautifully written letters addressed to people of every possible\n\ndescription, from an archbishop down to stable-boys and mid-wives! Then\n\ncame calls upon persons known and unknown! And this is worth noticing:\n\nwhen he made these calls, he was never abject and cringing, he never\n\nworried people by begging, but on the contrary behaved with propriety,\n\nand had positively a cheerful and pleasant air, though the inveterate\n\nsmell of spirits accompanied him everywhere, and his Oriental costume\n\ngradually changed into rags. 'Give, and God will reward you, though I\n\ndon't deserve it,' he would say, with a bright smile and a candid blush;\n\n'if you don't give, you'll be perfectly right, and I shan't blame you\n\nfor it. I shall find food to eat, God will provide! And there are people\n\npoorer than I, and much more deserving of help--plenty, plenty!' Misha\n\nwas particularly successful with women: he knew how to appeal to their\n\nsympathy. But don't suppose that he was or fancied himself a\n\nLovelace....Oh, no! in that way he was very modest. Whether it was that\n\nhe had inherited a cool temperament from his parents, or whether indeed\n\nthis too is to be set down to his dislike for doing any one harm--as,\n\naccording to his notions, relations with a woman meant inevitably doing\n\na woman harm--I won't undertake to decide; only in all his behaviour\n\nwith the fair sex he was extremely delicate. Women felt this, and were\n\nthe more ready to sympathise with him and help him, until at last he\n\nrevolted them by his drunkenness and debauchery, by the desperateness of\n\nwhich I have spoken already.... I can think of no other word for it.\n\nBut in other relations he had by that time lost every sort of delicacy,\n\nand was gradually sinking to the lowest depths of degradation. He once,\n\nin the public assembly at T----, got as far as setting on the table a\n\njug with a notice: 'Any one, to whom it may seem agreeable to give the\n\nhigh-born nobleman Poltyev (authentic documents in proof of his\n\npedigree are herewith exposed) a flip on the nose, may satisfy this\n\ninclination on putting a rouble into this jug.' And I am told there\n\nwere persons found willing to pay for the privilege of flipping a\n\nnobleman's nose! It is true that one such person, who put in only one\n\nrouble and gave him _two_ flips, he first almost strangled, and then\n\nforced to apologise; it is true, too, that part of the money gained in\n\nthis fashion he promptly distributed among other poor devils ... but\n\nstill, think what a disgrace!\n\nIn the course of his 'peregrinations from pillar to post,' he made his\n\nway, too, to his ancestral home, which he had sold for next to nothing\n\nto a speculator and money-lender well known in those days. The\n\nmoney-lender was at home, and hearing of the presence in the\n\nneighbourhood of the former owner, now reduced to vagrancy, he gave\n\norders not to admit him into the house, and even, in case of necessity,\n\nto drive him away. Misha announced that he would not for his part\n\nconsent to enter the house, polluted by the presence of so repulsive a\n\nperson; that he would permit no one to drive him away, but was going to\n\nthe churchyard to pay his devotions at the grave of his parents. So in\n\nfact he did.\n\nIn the churchyard he was joined by an old house-serf, who had once been\n\nhis nurse. The money-lender had deprived this old man of his monthly\n\nallowance, and driven him off the estate; since then his refuge had been\n\na corner in a peasant's hut. Misha had been too short a time in\n\npossession of his estate to have left behind him a particularly\n\nfavourable memory; still the old servant could not resist running to the\n\nchurchyard as soon as he heard of his young master's being there. He\n\nfound Misha sitting on the ground between the tombstones, asked for his\n\nhand to kiss, as in old times, and even shed tears on seeing the rags\n\nwhich clothed the limbs of his once pampered young charge.\n\nMisha gazed long and silently at the old man. 'Timofay!' he said at\n\nlast; Timofay started.\n\n'What do you desire?'\n\n'Have you a spade?'\n\n'I can get one.... But what do you want with a spade, Mihailo\n\nAndreitch, sir?'\n\n'I want to dig myself a grave, Timofay, and to lie here for time\n\neverlasting between my father and mother. There's only this spot left me\n\nin the world. Get a spade!'\n\n'Yes, sir,' said Timofay; he went and got it. And Misha began at once\n\ndigging in the ground, while Timofay stood by, his chin propped in his\n\nhand, repeating: 'It's all that's left for you and me, master!'\n\nMisha dug and dug, from time to time observing: 'Life's not worth\n\nliving, is it, Timofay?'\n\n'It's not indeed, master.'\n\nThe hole was already of a good depth. People saw what Misha was about,\n\nand ran to tell the new owner about it. The money-lender was at first\n\nvery angry, wanted to send for the police: 'This is sacrilege,' said he.\n\nBut afterwards, probably reflecting that it was inconvenient anyway to\n\nhave to do with such a madman, and that it might lead to a scandal,--he\n\nwent in his own person to the churchyard, and approaching Misha, still\n\ntoiling, made him a polite bow. He went on with his digging as though he\n\nhad not noticed his successor. 'Mihail Andreitch,' began the\n\nmoney-lender, 'allow me to ask what you are doing here?'\n\n'You can see--I am digging myself a grave.'\n\n'Why are you doing so?'\n\n'Because I don't want to live any longer.'\n\nThe money-lender fairly threw up his hands in amazement. 'You don't\n\nwant to live?'\n\nMisha glanced menacingly at the money-lender. 'That surprises you?\n\nAren't you the cause of it all? ... You? ... You? ... Wasn't it you,\n\nJudas, who robbed me, taking advantage of my childishness? Aren't you\n\nflaying the peasants' skins off their backs? Haven't you taken from\n\nthis poor old man his crust of dry bread? Wasn't it you? ... O God!\n\neverywhere nothing but injustice, and oppression, and evil-doing....\n\nEverything must go to ruin then, and me too! I don't care for life, I\n\ndon't care for life in Russia!' And the spade moved faster than ever in\n\nMisha's hands.\n\n'Here's a devil of a business!' thought the money-lender; 'he's\n\npositively burying himself alive.' 'Mihail Andreevitch,' he began\n\nagain: 'listen. I've been behaving badly to you, indeed; they told me\n\nfalsely of you.'\n\nMisha went on digging.\n\n'But why be desperate?'\n\nMisha still went on digging, and kept throwing the earth at the\n\nmoney-lender's feet, as though to say, 'Here you are, land-grabber.'\n\n'Really, you 're wrong in this. Won't you be pleased to come in to have\n\nsome lunch, and rest a bit?'\n\nMisha raised his head. 'So that's it now! And anything to drink?'\n\nThe money-lender was delighted. 'Why, of course ... I should think so.'\n\n'You invite Timofay too?'\n\n'Well, ... yes, him too.'\n\nMisha pondered. 'Only, mind ... you made me a beggar, you know.... Don't\n\nthink you can get off with one bottle!'\n\n'Set your mind at rest ... there shall be all you can want.'\n\nMisha got up and flung down the spade.... 'Well, Timosha,' said he to\n\nhis old nurse; 'let's do honour to our host.... Come along.'\n\n'Yes, sir,' answered the old man.\n\nAnd all three started off to the house together. The money-lender knew\n\nthe man he had to deal with. At the first start Misha, it is true,\n\nexacted a promise from him to 'grant all sorts of immunities' to the\n\npeasants; but an hour later, this same Misha, together with Timofay,\n\nboth drunk, were dancing a galop in the big apartments, which still\n\nseemed pervaded by the God-fearing shade of Andrei Nikolaevitch; and an\n\nhour later still, Misha in a dead sleep (he had a very weak head for\n\nspirits), laid in a cart with his high cap and dagger, was being driven\n\noff to the town, more than twenty miles away, and there was flung under\n\na hedge.... As for Timofay, who could still keep on his legs, and only\n\nhiccupped--him, of course, they kicked out of the house; since they\n\ncouldn't get at the master, they had to be content with the old servant.\n\nVI\n\nSome time passed again, and I heard nothing of Misha.... God knows what\n\nhe was doing. But one day, as I sat over the samovar at a\n\nposting-station on the T---- highroad, waiting for horses, I suddenly\n\nheard under the open window of the station room a hoarse voice, uttering\n\nin French the words: 'Monsieur ... monsieur ... prenez piti� d'un pauvre\n\ngentil-homme ruin�.' ... I lifted my head, glanced.... The\n\nmangy-looking fur cap, the broken ornaments on the ragged Circassian\n\ndress, the dagger in the cracked sheath, the swollen, but still rosy\n\nface, the dishevelled, but still thick crop of hair.... Mercy on us!\n\nMisha! He had come then to begging alms on the high-roads. I could not\n\nhelp crying out. He recognised me, started, turned away, and was about\n\nto move away from the window. I stopped him ... but what could I say to\n\nhim? Give him a lecture? ... In silence I held out a five-rouble note;\n\nhe, also in silence, took it in his still white and plump, though\n\nshaking and dirty hand, and vanished round the corner of the house.\n\nIt was a good while before they gave me horses, and I had time to give\n\nmyself up to gloomy reflections on my unexpected meeting with Misha; I\n\nfelt ashamed of having let him go so unsympathetically.\n\nAt last I set off on my way, and half a mile from the station I observed\n\nahead of me, in the road, a crowd of people moving along with a curious,\n\nas it seemed rhythmic, step. I overtook this crowd--and what did I see?\n\nSome dozen or so beggars, with sacks over their shoulders, were walking\n\ntwo by two, singing and leaping about, while in front of them danced\n\nMisha, stamping time with his feet, and shouting, 'Natchiki-tchikaldy,\n\ntchuk, tchuk, tchuk! ... Natchiki-tchikaldy, tchuk, tchuk, tchuk!'\n\nDirectly my carriage caught them up, and he saw me, he began at once\n\nshouting, 'Hurrah! Stand in position! right about face, guard of the\n\nroadside!'\n\nThe beggars took up his shout, and halted; while he, with his peculiar\n\nlaugh, jumped on to the carriage step, and again yelled: Hurrah!\n\n'What's the meaning of this?' I asked with involuntary astonishment.\n\n'This? This is my company, my army--all beggars, God's people, friends\n\nof my heart. Every one of them, thanks to you, has had a glass; and\n\nnow we are all rejoicing and making merry! ... Uncle! Do you know it's\n\nonly with beggars, God's people, that one can live in the world ... by\n\nGod, it is!'\n\nI made him no answer ... but at that moment he struck me as such\n\na kind good creature, his face expressed such childlike\n\nsimple-heartedness.... A light seemed suddenly as it were to dawn upon\n\nme, and I felt a pang in my heart.... 'Get into the carriage,' I said\n\nto him. He was taken aback....\n\n'What? Into the carriage?'\n\n'Yes, get in, get in,' I repeated; 'I want to make you a suggestion. Sit\n\ndown.... Come along with me.'\n\n'Well, as you will.' He sat down. 'Well, and you, my honoured friends,\n\nmy dear comrades,' he added, addressing the beggars, 'fare-well, till we\n\nmeet again.' Misha took off his high cap, and bowed low. The beggars all\n\nseemed overawed.... I told the coachman to whip up the horses, and the\n\ncarriage rolled off.\n\nThe suggestion I wanted to make Misha was this: the idea suddenly\n\noccurred to me to take him with me to my home in the country, about\n\nfive-and-twenty miles from that station, to rescue him, or at least to\n\nmake an effort to rescue him. 'Listen, Misha,' I said; 'will you come\n\nalong and live with me? ... You shall have everything provided you; you\n\nshall have clothes and linen made you; you shall be properly fitted out,\n\nand you shall have money to spend on tobacco, and so on, only on one\n\ncondition, that you give up drink.... Do you agree?'\n\nMisha was positively aghast with delight; he opened his eyes wide,\n\nflushed crimson, and suddenly falling on my shoulder, began kissing me,\n\nand repeating in a broken voice, 'Uncle ... benefactor ... God reward\n\nyou.' ... He burst into tears at last, and taking off his cap fell to\n\nwiping his eyes, his nose, his lips with it.\n\n'Mind,' I observed; 'remember the condition, not to touch strong drink.'\n\n'Damnation to it!' he cried, with a wave of both arms, and with this\n\nimpetuous movement, I was more than ever conscious of the strong smell\n\nof spirits with which he seemed always saturated.... 'Uncle, if you\n\nknew what my life has been.... If it hadn't been for sorrow, a cruel\n\nfate.... But now I swear, I swear, I will mend my ways, I will show\n\nyou.... Uncle, I've never told a lie--you can ask whom you like.... I'm\n\nhonest, but I'm an unlucky fellow, uncle; I've known no kindness from\n\nany one....'\n\nHere he broke down finally into sobs. I tried to soothe him, and\n\nsucceeded so far that when we reached home Misha had long been lost in a\n\nheavy sleep, with his head on my knees.\n\nVII\n\nHe was at once assigned a room for himself, and at once, first thing,\n\ntaken to the bath, which was absolutely essential. All his clothes, and\n\nhis dagger and cap and torn boots, were carefully put away in a loft; he\n\nwas dressed in clean linen, slippers, and some clothes of mine, which,\n\nas is always the way with poor relations, at once seemed to adapt\n\nthemselves to his size and figure. When he came to table, washed, clean,\n\nand fresh, he seemed so touched and happy, he beamed all over with such\n\njoyful gratitude, that I too felt moved and joyful.... His face was\n\ncompletely transformed.... Boys of twelve have faces like that on Easter\n\nSundays, after the communion, when, thickly pomaded, in new jacket and\n\nstarched collars, they come to exchange Easter greetings with their\n\nparents. Misha was continually--with a sort of cautious\n\nincredulity--feeling himself and repeating: 'What does it mean? ... Am I\n\nin heaven?' The next day he announced that he had not slept all night,\n\nhe had been in such ecstasy.\n\nI had living in my house at that time an old aunt with her niece; both\n\nof them were extremely disturbed when they heard of Misha's presence;\n\nthey could not comprehend how I could have asked him into my house!\n\nThere were very ugly rumours about him. But in the first place, I knew\n\nhe was always very courteous with ladies; and, secondly, I counted on\n\nhis promises of amendment. And, in fact, for the first two days of his\n\nstay under my roof Misha not merely justified my expectations but\n\nsurpassed them, while the ladies of the household were simply enchanted\n\nwith him. He played piquet with the old lady, helped her to wind her\n\nworsted, showed her two new games of patience; for the niece, who had a\n\nsmall voice, he played accompaniments on the piano, and read Russian and\n\nFrench poetry. He told both the ladies lively but discreet anecdotes; in\n\nfact, he showed them every attention, so that they repeatedly expressed\n\ntheir surprise to me, and the old lady even observed how unjust people\n\nsometimes were.... The things--the things they had said of him ... and\n\nhe such a quiet fellow, and so polite ... poor Misha! It is true that at\n\ntable 'poor Misha' licked his lips in a rather peculiar, hurried way, if\n\nhe simply glanced at the bottle. But I had only to shake my finger at\n\nhim, and he would turn his eyes upwards, and lay his hand on his\n\nheart ... as if to say, I have sworn.... 'I am regenerated now,' he\n\nassured me.... 'Well, God grant it be so,' was my thought.... But\n\nthis regeneration did not last long.\n\nThe first two days he was very talkative and cheerful. But even on the\n\nthird day he seemed somehow subdued, though he remained, as before, with\n\nthe ladies and tried to entertain them. A half mournful, half dreamy\n\nexpression flitted now and then over his face, and the face itself was\n\npaler and looked thinner. 'Are you unwell?' I asked him.\n\n'Yes,' he answered; 'my head aches a little.' On the fourth day he was\n\ncompletely silent; for the most part he sat in a corner, hanging his\n\nhead disconsolately, and his dejected appearance worked upon the\n\ncompassionate sympathies of the two ladies, who now, in their turn,\n\ntried to amuse him. At table he ate nothing, stared at his plate, and\n\nrolled up pellets of bread. On the fifth day the feeling of compassion\n\nin the ladies began to be replaced by other emotions--uneasiness and\n\neven alarm. Misha was so strange, he held aloof from people, and kept\n\nmoving along close to the walls, as though trying to steal by unnoticed,\n\nand suddenly looking round as though some one had called him. And what\n\nhad become of his rosy colour? It seemed covered over by a layer of\n\nearth. 'Are you still unwell?' I asked him.\n\n'No, I'm all right,' he answered abruptly.\n\n'Are you dull?'\n\n'Why should I be dull?' But he turned away and would not look me\n\nin the face.\n\n'Or is it that wretchedness come over you again?' To this he made no\n\nreply. So passed another twenty-four hours.\n\nNext day my aunt ran into my room in a state of great excitement,\n\ndeclaring that she would leave the house with her niece, if Misha was to\n\nremain in it.\n\n'Why so?'\n\n'Why, we are dreadfully scared with him.... He's not a man, he's a\n\nwolf,--nothing better than a wolf. He keeps moving and moving about, and\n\ndoesn't speak--and looks so wild.... He almost gnashes his teeth at me.\n\nMy Katia, you know, is so nervous.... She was so struck with him the\n\nfirst day.... I'm in terror for her, and indeed for myself too.' ... I\n\ndidn't know what to say to my aunt. I couldn't, anyway, turn Misha out,\n\nafter inviting him.\n\nHe relieved me himself from my difficult position. The same day,--I was\n\nstill sitting in my own room,--suddenly I heard behind me a husky and\n\nangry voice: 'Nikolai Nikolaitch, Nikolai Nikolaitch!' I looked round;\n\nMisha was standing in the doorway with a face that was fearful,\n\nblack-looking and distorted. 'Nikolai Nikolaitch!' he repeated ... (not\n\n'uncle' now).\n\n'What do you want?'\n\n'Let me go ... at once!'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Let me go, or I shall do mischief, I shall set the house on fire or cut\n\nsome one's throat.' Misha suddenly began trembling. 'Tell them to give\n\nme back my clothes, and let a cart take me to the highroad, and let me\n\nhave some money, however little!'\n\n'Are you displeased, then, at anything?'\n\n'I can't live like this!' he shrieked at the top of his voice. 'I can't\n\nlive in your respectable, thrice-accursed house! It makes me sick, and\n\nashamed to live so quietly! ... How _you_ manage to endure it!'\n\n'That is,' I interrupted in my turn, 'you mean--you can't live without\n\ndrink....'\n\n'Well, yes! yes!' he shrieked again: 'only let me go to my\n\nbrethren, my friends, to the beggars! ... Away from your\n\nrespectable, loathsome species!'\n\nI was about to remind him of his sworn promises, but Misha's frenzied\n\nlook, his breaking voice, the convulsive tremor in his limbs,--it was\n\nall so awful, that I made haste to get rid of him; I said that his\n\nclothes should be given him at once, and a cart got ready; and taking\n\na note for twenty-five roubles out of a drawer, I laid it on the\n\ntable. Misha had begun to advance in a menacing way towards me,--but\n\non this, suddenly he stopped, his face worked, flushed, he struck\n\nhimself on the breast, the tears rushed from his eyes, and muttering,\n\n'Uncle! angel! I know I'm a ruined man! thanks! thanks!' he snatched\n\nup the note and ran away.\n\nAn hour later he was sitting in the cart dressed once more in his\n\nCircassian costume, again rosy and cheerful; and when the horses\n\nstarted, he yelled, tore off the peaked cap, and, waving it over his\n\nhead, made bow after bow. Just as he was going off, he had given me a\n\nlong and warm embrace, and whispered, 'Benefactor, benefactor ...\n\nthere's no saving me!' He even ran to the ladies and kissed their hands,\n\nfell on his knees, called upon God, and begged their forgiveness! Katia\n\nI found afterwards in tears.\n\nThe coachman, with whom Misha had set off, on coming home informed me\n\nthat he had driven him to the first tavern on the highroad--and that\n\nthere 'his honour had stuck,' had begun treating every one\n\nindiscriminately--and had quickly sunk into unconsciousness.\n\nFrom that day I never came across Misha again, but his ultimate fate I\n\nlearned in the following manner.\n\nVIII\n\nThree years later, I was again at home in the country; all of a sudden a\n\nservant came in and announced that Madame Poltyev was asking to see me.\n\nI knew no Madame Poltyev, and the servant, who made this announcement,\n\nfor some unknown reason smiled sarcastically. To my glance of inquiry,\n\nhe responded that the lady asking for me was young, poorly dressed, and\n\nhad come in a peasant's cart with one horse, which she was driving\n\nherself! I told him to ask Madame Poltyev up to my room.\n\nI saw a woman of five-and-twenty, in the dress of the small tradesman\n\nclass, with a large kerchief on her head. Her face was simple, roundish,\n\nnot without charm; she looked dejected and gloomy, and was shy and\n\nawkward in her movements.\n\n'You are Madame Poltyev?' I inquired, and I asked her to sit down.\n\n'Yes,' she answered in a subdued voice, and she did not sit down. 'I am\n\nthe widow of your nephew, Mihail Andreevitch Poltyev.'\n\n'Is Mihail Andreevitch dead? Has he been dead long? But sit down, I\n\nbeg.'\n\nShe sank into a chair.\n\n'It's two months.'\n\n'And had you been married to him long?'\n\n'I had been a year with him.'\n\n'Where have you come from now?'\n\n'From out Tula way.... There's a village there,\n\nZnamenskoe-Glushkovo--perhaps you may know it. I am the daughter of the\n\ndeacon there. Mihail Andreitch and I lived there.... He lived in my\n\nfather's house. We were a whole year together.'\n\nThe young woman's lips twitched a little, and she put her hand up to\n\nthem. She seemed to be on the point of tears, but she controlled\n\nherself, and cleared her throat.\n\n'Mihail Andreitch,' she went on: 'before his death enjoined upon me to\n\ngo to you; \"You must be sure to go,\" said he! And he told me to thank\n\nyou for all your goodness, and to give you ... this ... see, this little\n\nthing (she took a small packet out of her pocket) which he always had\n\nabout him.... And Mihail Andreitch said, if you would be pleased to\n\naccept it in memory of him, if you would not disdain it.... \"There's\n\nnothing else,\" said he, \"I can give him\" ... that is, you....'\n\nIn the packet there was a little silver cup with the monogram of Misha's\n\nmother. This cup I had often seen in Misha's hands, and once he had even\n\nsaid to me, speaking of some poor fellow, that he really was destitute,\n\nsince he had neither cup nor bowl, 'while I, see, have this anyway.'\n\nI thanked her, took the cup, and asked:\n\n'Of what complaint had Misha died? No doubt....'\n\nThen I bit my tongue ... but the young woman understood my unuttered\n\nhint.... She took a swift glance at me, then looked down again, smiled\n\nmournfully, and said at once: 'Oh no! he had quite given that up, ever\n\nsince he got to know me ... But he had no health at all! ... It was\n\nshattered quite. As soon as he gave up drink, he fell into ill health\n\ndirectly. He became so steady; he always wanted to help father in his\n\nland or in the garden, ... or any other work there might be ... in spite\n\nof his being of noble birth. But how could he get the strength? ... At\n\nwriting, too, he tried to work; as you know, he could do that work\n\ncapitally, but his hands shook, and he couldn't hold the pen properly.\n\n... He was always finding fault with himself; \"I'm a white-handed poor\n\ncreature,\" he would say; \"I've never done any good to anybody, never\n\nhelped, never laboured!\" He worried himself very much about that.... He\n\nused to say that our people labour,--but what use are we? ... Ah,\n\nNikolai Nikolaitch, he was a good man--and he was fond of me ... and\n\nI... Ah, pardon me....'\n\nHere the young woman wept outright. I would have consoled her, but I did\n\nnot know how.\n\n'Have you a child left you?' I asked at last.\n\nShe sighed. 'No, no child.... Is it likely?' And her tears flowed faster\n\nthan ever.\n\n'And so that was how Misha's troubled wanderings had ended,' the old man\n\nP. wound up his narrative. 'You will agree with me, I am sure, that I'm\n\nright in calling him a desperate character; but you will most likely\n\nagree too that he was not like the desperate characters of to-day;\n\nstill, a philosopher, you must admit, would find a family likeness\n\nbetween him and them. In him and in them there's the thirst for\n\nself-destruction, the wretchedness, the dissatisfaction.... And what it\n\nall comes from, I leave the philosopher to decide.'\n\nBOUGIVALLE, _November_ 1881."
