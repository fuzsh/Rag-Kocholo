        "text": "His heart rate begins to slow. His adrenaline rush subsides. He has slayed the dragon lady with some of the finest lines in filmdom. “I’m not the guy you kill. I’m the guy you buy.”\n\nLaw-firm fixer Michael Clayton sits in the back of a taxi in New York City. He should be beaming. Yet, everything on actor George Clooney’s face says Clayton has arrived not at a victory celebration but on the tipping point between emptiness and “Now what?”\n\nIn 2007’s “Michael Clayton,” writer-director Tony Gilroy nailed one of the best final shots in an American movie. Period. So forget that he had “The Return of Julia Roberts as Leading Lady” hanging over his new and enjoyable shell game of a caper, “Duplicity.”\n\nHow was he going to top, even match, that shot?\n\n“I was thinking about it a lot when we were trying to finish ‘Duplicity,’ ” he says.\n\n“For both films, the final shots were really open-ended, deep into production and starting to make everyone panic. They were both late-breaking developments.”\n\nBefore becoming a director, Gilroy had a reputation as a screenwriter of the burnished script. So this approach was hardly the norm.\n\n“That’s not the way we work, really. They were nervy, the rare moment of bravery.”\n\n“Nervy” is not a bad way to characterize Gilroy’s style. He embraces tricky structures to support classic and meaningful movie payoffs.\n\nIn “Duplicity,” Gilroy keeps his eye on corporate high jinks. Roberts and Clive Owen play former spies now in the business of corporate espionage. Or, as they call it, “competive intelligence.”\n\nTo borrow another phrase, if the toxic dealings of an agribusiness concern in “Micheal Clayton” made for tragedy, the quadruple crosses in “Duplicity” are farce. Not the easy ha-ha sort, but richer.\n\nTake the lavish pleasure Gilroy brings to bear on a clash of industry titans played by Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson: Their physical match is ridiculous in its ferocity; but the energy hints at the bouts to come.\n\n“Duplicity” is foremost a romance. It begins when a guy meets a gal. In the blazing sun of Dubai, MI6 agent Ray Koval (Owen) walks up to CIA operative Claire Stenwick (Roberts). He wears a knee brace over his summer suit. Her print dress accents her decolletage. It’s all so satifyingly glamorous.\n\nAnyone fond of the psychological in “Rear Window,” in which Jimmy Stewart sits out the film in a wheelchair, knows Ray is at a disadvantage.\n\nEven if his come-on smacks of no such thing.\n\nWhen he wakes up alone in their hotel room (the first of many) without a cache of documents, well . . .\n\nGilroy, too, was disarmed by one of his leading lady’s gifts.\n\n“Increasingly over time, I came to believe she knew way better than I did what the camera was going to do with her,” he says. “There were so many times where we’d do a couple of takes and I’d say, “Let’s do one more,” and she’d say, “You know I’ll give you that, but you’re going to use number three.”\n\nHe used number three.\n\n“Duplicity” is a brisk blend of the marvelously old-fashioned and the up-to-date.\n\nLike films of yore, the opening banter is delivered with snap by stars. But the movie’s most postmodern trait is Gilroy’s shuffled, twisted narratives.\n\nTo run a confidence game like “Duplicity,” you have to have confidence in your editor. Gilroy’s younger brother, John, also cut “Michael Clayton.”\n\nThe two, along with brother Dan, are sons of Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Frank D. Gilroy (“The Subject Was Roses”). They were raised in Washingtonville, an upstate New York town of blue-collar fortitude.\n\n“We work shoulder to shoulder from the very beginning,” says Gilroy. “He’s helping me build the film from the very first day. I made him a co-producer, so we could bring him on preproduction. He’s really, really, really good.”\n\nFor a spell, Steven Spielberg was interested in directing “Duplicity.” Reportedly, he could never quite be sure of his compass in the thicket of reversals and more reversals. And the screenplays Gilroy wrote for the Jason “Bourne” franchise reiterate his taste for the zigzagging. His relationships with the directors of those films, however, were not smooth.\n\nFor years, “I fancied myself a pure screenwriter,” he says. ” ‘Oh I don’t want to be a director. I don’t want to do all that.’ ”\n\nBut, “Over time it gets wearying and frustrating to not have things be exactly, or bend exactly, the way you want them to.”\n\nGilroy penned “Dolores Claiborne,” “Devil’s Advocate” and “Proof of Life,” all directed by friend Taylor Hackford.\n\n“We couldn’t have been more collaborative. He’s like my brother,” says Gilroy. “Even still, it’s not yours. You want to finally see if it can be yours once. You may find you don’t like the job.\n\n“I found I was more built for the job than I thought.” He’ll get no argument from us."
