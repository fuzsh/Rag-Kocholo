The film garnered him Academy Award® nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, as well as Directors Guild and Writers Guild award nominations. The writer/director/producer then followed Michael Clayton with his second directorial effort based on his own screenplay, the critically acclaimed thriller Duplicity, starring Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. A veteran screenwriter, Gilroy also spent seven years working on the first three Bourne films: The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. In 2012, Gilroy co-wrote and directed the fourth installment of the series, TheBourne Legacy, starring Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton.\n\nGilroy also served as a consulting producer on Netflix’s hit series House of Cards during the show’s third and fourth seasons.
