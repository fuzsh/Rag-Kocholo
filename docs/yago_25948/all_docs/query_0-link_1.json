        "text": "Frank D. Gilroy’s drama about a middle-aged, middle class, childless Brooklyn Heights couple stuck in an unhappy marriage. Starring Shirley MacLaine, Kenneth Mars and Chris Gampel.\n\nAdapted from the novel of the same name by Paula Fox, which was published a year earlier, the story concerns Sophie Brentwood (Shirley MacLaine) who is down in the dumps, and not without decent reason.\n\nHer gang of pals is collapsing, her Brooklyn, New York area is in abrupt decline and her marriage to an enthusiastically closed-off attorney named Otto (Kenneth Mars) is crumbling.\n\nSophie attempts to reach out to old acquaintances and her husband’s former partner (Chris Gampel), but these attempts ultimately leave her feeling even more isolated.

It is certainly not a film that has been particularly appreciated, especially in terms of the influx of character-driven dramas that took a more simple approach during this period – and it isn’t helped by the fact that it covers some very bleak subjects, which are far from comforting or endearing, which can sometimes keep us at arm’s length – but as one of the more…"
