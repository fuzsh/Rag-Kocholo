        "text": "\"People who've watched the film have told me, 'Wow. You've really skewered journalism,\"' says veteran screenwriter and first-time director Dan Gilroy about his movie Nightcrawler. \"My point is actually we're not trying to skewer journalism. We're trying to display a very complicated mechanism or system as it exists. Ultimately, we, people, individuals, are the end users of the product that's shown on TV. We as a race seem statistically to be inclined to watch graphic, lurid images.\"\n\nThe movie, which opens nationwide today, stars Jake Gyllenhaal (End of Watch) as Louis Bloom, a petty thief who discovers he can make far more cash peddling horrific video footage of accidents and crime scenes than he ever did hawking stolen scrap metal.\n\nWhile Lou's rise to the top of the Los Angeles journalism world might seem surreal or even gothic, in cities like it and Philadelphia and Chicago, being a freelance news videographer, or \"nightcrawler,\" is a very real way to make a living.\n\nAs the Santa Monica-born Gilroy explains, \"It's actually not in the film, but the specific reason is that local Los Angeles news is a union [shop], and from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. unions sometimes go to double and sometimes triple time, and the local Los Angeles stations don't want to pay that union rate, because it's not worth it to them, so it creates this vacuum. So freelancers come in and fill the void.\n\n\"It's a very large market. This to me is one of the most interesting things about Los Angeles is that it's over 800 square miles. When they go out at night, it's almost like fishing. You can put yourself in the [San Fernando] Valley, in the hopes that something in the Valley is happening, but if it's happening all the way in the south end, you've got a 45-minute drive on a good night, so they're racing around.\n\n\"Robert Elswitt, our D.P. [director of photography, The Master, There Will Be Blood], Jake and I went out at 100 miles an hour screaming through L.A. at night with [police] scanners blaring. It's a really kinetic, vibrant world, and when I heard about it, I was immediately intrigued.\"\n\nThe writer-director, and former journalist, also found the profession fascinating because the late hours, the pressure and the competition for scoops lead to ethical lapses.\n\n\"We went out with the nightcrawler who was our technical advisor,\" Gilroy says, \"and he told us point-blank, 'Eight or nine months ago, I sat on the 405' -- a big four-lane freeway that goes very fast -- 'and a car stalled out.' Rather than call the police, he got his camera out and waited. And sure enough, five minutes later, there was a three-car pileup, seriously. And he sold the footage for thousands of dollars. He said, 'I didn't cause the accident. I just filmed it.'\"\n\nAn 'Endearing' Anti-Hero\n\nLou prospers in this world because he has no qualms about getting grisly images even if he has to manipulate a crime scene or withhold evidence that could help solve the crimes he covers.\n\nIn most movies, Lou would be a clear-cut villain for doing stuff like that. In a monologue he delivers informing his favorite client (Rene Russo, Gilroy's wife) and the audience that local news across the country only devotes 20 seconds per broadcast to local government -- a fact someone like Will McAvoy of HBO's The Newsroom would intone as a warning -- Lou is giddy.\n\n\"When he's spouting the facts about local television news, the only reason he gets excited, I feel, and Jake does it so well when he does the performance is because he sees that's the window that allows him to succeed,\" Gilroy says. \"I believe if we came back 10 years after this movie was made, Lou would be running a major corporation. ... We always approached the character in some ways as naive and innocent, even as ultimately dangerous and sociopathic as he is. There's a naivete, almost an endearing naivete -- I use the word 'endearing' in quotes because I know a lot of people will not look at the character that way. Jake and I were always looking for almost a childlike quality when he comes across something new.\n\n\"I'm always trying to find what's bad about my good characters and what's good about my bad characters.\"\n\nWith a Little Help\n\nBecause of the delicate subject matter and its challenging protagonist, Gilroy and his collaborators had to maximize a meager budget and had to work as quickly as nightcrawlers do to complete the film.\n\n\"It was very challenging because we didn't have enough money or enough time. We only had 27 days and a slightly more than $8 million budget in Los Angeles, and we had over 80 locations,\" he says.\n\nIt probably doesn't hurt that his older brother, Tony (who earned Oscar nominations for writing and directing Michael Clayton), produced the film and his twin brother, John, edited it. All three are the sons of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and screenwriter Frank D. Gilroy (The Subject Was Roses).\n\nEven though the film is deeply personal to Dan Gilroy, he uses the pronoun \"we\" to describe the making of it more frequently than \"I\" throughout the 20-minute interview.\n\nHaving contributed scripts to movies as diverse as his brother Tony's The Bourne Legacy, Real Steel, Two For the Money, Chasers, The Fall and Freejack, Gilroy says he and his older sibling had an unusual advantage when they moved up to the director's chair.\n\n\"Tony and I have a similar arc in that we did not direct our first film until our mid-50s. Tony was maybe 52. I'm 55 now. What you get from starting later in life is that Tony and I have been on 50 movie sets where we're watching other directors work. At a certain point in your [sixth] decade of life, if you've paid attention and the material is good, you're ahead of the game in terms of directing your first film.\n\n\"When somebody gets a chance to direct, there are certain pitfalls you can land in, like 'I've got so much angst and anger built up in me for not being able to direct and suddenly, I'm going to make a 'message movie.' It's an enormous trap. Films are like campfire stories: their first and foremost aim is to entertain and engage. Anything that comes after that is a bonus.\"\n\nMovieStyle on 10/31/2014"
