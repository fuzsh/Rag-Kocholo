Adriaen van Stalbemt later returned to Antwerp, becoming a master in the St. Luke’s Guild around 1609. He is documented as having spent almost a year in England (1633-34), where he painted two views of Greenwich with King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria (still in the Royal Collection). His eclectic style reveals the infuences of Jan Breughel I, Hendrick van Balen, Paul Bril and Adam Elsheimer, to whom a group of Stalbemt’s pictures had previously been given (see K. Andrews, ‘A Pseudo-Elsheimer Group: Adriaen van Stalbemt as Figure painter’, in: The Burlington Magazine, CXV, 1973, pp. 301-6). This beautifully preserved painting exhibits Stalbemt’s characteristically meticulous brush technique and the extent of the infuence by Jan Breughel I. A copper plate with the same measurements, depicting An Allegory of Winter sold with Christie’s, Amsterdam, 13 November 1990, lot 207, may well have been a pendant to the present composition. A nearly identical pair of pictures by Adriaen van Stalbemt, larger and on panel, is recorded to have been with De Jonckheere in the past.\n\n11\n\n8 Abel Grimmer (Antwerp 1570/3-1610/30) and Attributed to Hendrick van Steenwijck I (Kampen 1540/60-1603 Frankfurt am Main) The interior of a Gothic church with fgures walking through the isle, probably a christening procession, other fgures praying in the background indistinctly signed (?) and dated twice ‘1586’ (lower centre) oil on panel 31.6 x 46.8 cm. €15,000-20,000\n\nUS$20,000-25,000\n\nPROVENANCE: Dr. H.

Keyes, Esaias van den Velde, Doornspijk, 1984, p. 152, no. 118, as Esaias van de Velde.\n\nAlthough published in the monograph by Keyes as painted by Van de Velde, the attribution is questioned by the RKD, The Hague, who propose an alternative attribution to Reyer Claesz. Suycker (Haarlem 1590/1600-1653).\n\nCollection Lürmann, Bremen. with P. de Boer, Amsterdam, where acquired by the father of the late owner in 1938, as dated 1645.\n\nThis hithero unknown portrait sheds a new light on the relatively early oeuvre of Van Brekelenkam. Its pendant, Portrait of a boy, holding a slice of bread, in a feigned oval (fg. 1), formerly in the Dr. Anton C.R. Dreesmann Collection (19732002), in 1938 also with P. de Boer, Amsterdam (see: ‘Oude Schilderstukken uit vele scholen in kunsthandel P. de Boer: Een zoo juist verworven collectie’, in : De Telegraaf, 26 August 1938, the present lot illustrated), and sold with Christie’s, London, 11 April 2002, lot 540, was dated by Lasius to circa 1660 (see: A. Lasius, Quiringh van Brekelenkam, Doornspijk, 1992, pp. 146-7, no. 234). However, with the present picture dated 1649, this pair follows the earliest dated picture of 1648 (Domestic Cares, Museum De Lakenhal, Leiden, inv. no. 47), which, in turn, shows a strong debt to Gerard Dou. The present work is a particularly charming example of Brekelenkam’s style painted with typically broad and fuent brushstrokes, in brownish tones, depicting a single fgure - perhaps one of his children - with a high degree of warmth and feeling, often lacking in the works of his Leiden contemporaries.\n\n15\n\n13\n\nLittle is known of Brekelenkam’s career, which seems to have been for the most part spent in relative poverty. The frst mention of him is by Jacob Weyerman (De Levens-beschryvingen der Nederlandsche Konstschilders en Konst-schilderessen, 2, The Hague, 1729), which related that ‘Jan Steen opened up an inn or rather a little pub ... He had plenty of business but his customers seldom paid up promptly, as most were penniless painters. Frans van Mieris, Ary de Vois, Quiring Breekelekamp [sic] and Jan Lievens were his daily customers and came at all hours of the day and night...’ Similarly, an unknown author reviewing Gerard Hoet’s 1752 Catalogus of naamlyst van schilderyen (quoted by Lasius, op. cit., p. 11): ‘The painters of his time, who called him simply Quiringh, often sought his company, as he was very witty and funny, having as well the gift of being able to imitate everyone’s speech and mannerisms. He was a little man, had many children and domestic cares and very little means...’. Fig. 1.

Schulz, Aert van der Neer, Doornspijk, 2002, p. 280, no. 624, as probably by Anthonie van Borssom.\n\nThe rich impasto in the lower right foreground might suggest that the panel was used earlier by the artist for a diferent, unfnished composition: seen top right, this passage represents a cloudy blue sky.\n\nUS$39,000-64,000\n\nThe present picture, depicting no less than eighteen diferent fower types in a glass vase, is the smallest painting known by this artist (see: N. Janssen, Paintings of Maria van Oosterwijck, part 2 ‘Flower still lives’, no. B25; http:/www. mariavanoosterwijck.nl/B25). The small size of the panel may suggest that it was painted as a showpiece: a virtuoso demonstration of the artist’s skill at depicting diferent fowers. Indeed, the presence of Van Oosterwijck’s signature on such a large scale, carved in marble and somewhat disproportionate to the composition itself, suggests that she was particularly proud of this painting. Maria van Oosterwijck was the daughter of a wealthy clergyman, whose frst studio was said to be in her grandfather’s vicarage in Delft. The still life artist Willem van Aelst courted her, but she never married. Her paintings were eagerly collected and her patrons included Louis XIV of France, Emperor Leopold I and Stadholder-King William III.\n\n17\n\n15 (actual size)\n\nTHE PROPERTY FROM A DECEASED DUTCH PRIVATE COLLECTOR (LOTS 7-24)\n\n16 School of Rotterdam, c. 1650 A couple seated at a table, eating oysters oil on panel 24.5 x 18.9 cm €2,000-3,000\n\nUS$2,600-3,800\n\nPROVENANCE: with C.P.A. & G.R.

LVI, as dated 1607.\n\nWith its charming naïveté the present summer scene is a typical example of Abel Grimmer’s art. In paintings such as the present one, Abel continued the successful landscape formula invented by his father and teacher Jacob Grimmer (c. 1525/6-1589/1609). The Grimmers specialized in small landscapes and their paintings often constitute sets of the ‘Four Seasons’, as is the case with the present work, or the ‘Twelve Months of the Year’. Both father and son favoured the tondo shape. These circular paintings owe their popularity to the unmistakably decorative efect, to which their distinctly schematic layout contributes as well. However, on close inspection, they are surprisingly sophisticated in terms of composition and colouring. This is beautifully demonstrated in the present painting, which, dated 1611, is a mature production of the artist. Grimmer cleverly exploits the round format to create a varied composition with a convincing sense of space and atmosphere, and replete with lively detail. The view accommodates a veritable fête champêtre on the verdant slope in the foreground, followed by middle zone with a castle in a pond and a gondola approaching. A sandy road emerges beyond, the shallow curve it makes past a farmhouse faintly echoing the round outlines of the painting. Clumps of lush green trees and hills further harmoniously balance the composition. Bertier de Sauvigny (op.cit.) lists another, unsigned version of this composition on panel, 12 cm. diameter (no. 15, p. 263 and reproduced in colour on p. 344, pl. 87).\n\n21\n\n(actual size)\n\nTHE PROPERTY FROM A DECEASED DUTCH PRIVATE COLLECTOR (LOTS 7-24)\n\n22 Jacob Grimmer (Antwerp 1525/6-1589/1609) An Allegory of Summer; A summer landscape with fgures haying, a village beyond oil on panel, tondo 16.3 cm. diam. €25,000-35,000\n\nUS$32,000-44,000\n\nPROVENANCE: L.A.

Grimmer instead depicted his own rural environment. Novel in his peaceful Flemish landscapes is the high degree of realism, which is borne out in a sensitive rendition of the atmosphere and of the scenery. His works earned him a reputation well beyond the borders of Flanders already during his lifetime and he was praised as one of the best landscapists of his time by Giorgio Vasari and, later, Karel van Mander. Grimmer’s landscapes are still noted for their charming naïveté and refned execution. Typical for Grimmer in the present summer scene, is the slightly elevated vantage point and fat, uninterrupted view from foreground to background. It provides the setting for farmhouses and numerous, tiny fgures. The latter not only ofer a pretext for colourful accents to the muted palette of greens, they make up amusing scenes of their own. The immediate foreground shows a pond with a family of ducks and in the right foreground a group of peasants enjoys a picnic. One peasant is busy harvesting wheat, a traditional emblem of summer, and sheaves of wheat are scattered across the middle zone. Across from an amorous scene against one of the sheaves, a couple is angling on the verge of the brook to the left. The skyline of a town can be glimpsed in the distance, where an onion shaped spire rises up. The tondo shape was a trademark of Jacob Grimmer and he often used it for series of the ‘Four Seasons’, such as in the case of the present work, or of the ‘Twelve Months of the Year’. Grimmer masterfully used the round form as an aid to shape the composition. The present painting is probably a mature production by the artist.\n\n23\n\n(actual size)\n\nTHE PROPERTY FROM A DECEASED DUTCH PRIVATE COLLECTOR (LOTS 7-24)\n\n23\n\n23 Circle of Paul Bril (Antwerp/Breda 1553/4-1626 Rome) A mountainous river landscape with travelers crossing a bridge, a town on the mountainside to the right dated ‘1603’ (lower right) oil on copper, stamped on the reverse with the coat-of-arms of the city of Antwerp and the maker’s mark of Pieter Stas (active in Antwerp c. 1587-1610) 21.7 x 28.2 cm. €6,000-8,000\n\n24 Attributed to Marcellus Coffermans (active in Antwerp 1549-1575) The Nativity; The Three Warriors before David with Water from the Well near the Gate of Bethlehem; and The Adoration of the Magi oil on panel 13.8 x 8.8 cm.; 13.7 x 9.5 cm.; 13.7 x 9.6 cm. €15,000-20,000\n\n(3) US$20,000-25,000\n\nUS$7,700-10,000 PROVENANCE:\n\nPROVENANCE: Anonymous sale; Phillips, London, 5 July 1994, lot 67, as Paul Bril. with P. de Boer, Amsterdam, where acquired by the late owner in 1995, as Paul Bril.\n\nThis composition is a liberal adaption of Bril’s print from 1590, which was part of a series of two prints.

XIII; 24-30), depicts a summer’s day with peasants resting in the shade of the foliage, at the edge of a wood. A plough sits abandoned in the soil before them and most farm workers, including a mother, child, and their dog, are fast asleep. To the right two horses are visible and birds muster in the ploughed feld on the left hand side. In the distance, just before the valley below, one farmer is working the land, likely referring directly to Matt. XIII, verse 25. Although Dr. Klaus Ertz (1979, op. cit. and 1984, op. cit., nos. 5-7) lists three other versions of this composition following Jan Breughel the Elder, a painted prototype by the artist appears no longer to exist. A drawing in a private Dutch collection formerly in the collection of J.A. Duval le Camus (1814-1878), Paris - and a gouache on vellum, in 1997 with Johnny van Haeften, both attributed to Breughel the Elder, do however depict the exact same scene as the present picture, but both are rather independent art works and not studies for a painting or a modello for the studio. Of the versions mentioned by Ertz in his monograph on Jan Breughel the Younger, the one in the Granata collection in Rovigo, is closest to the present composition (see: Ertz, 1984, op. cit., p. 187, no. 6).\n\n38 OLD MASTERS & 19 th CENTURY ART\n\nTHE PROPERTY OF MR.

Ludke, David Teniers der Jüngere 1610-1690: Alltag und Vergngen in Flandern, Karlsruhe, 2005, pp. 280-1, nr. 89, ill.\n\nThe Miraculous draught of fshes is a subject taken from St. John (21; 1-8), that represents a pivotal moment in the early history of Christianity.1 The episode evolves around Christ’s appearance after his resurrection to his disciples and highlights Saint Peter’s future leading role in spreading the Christian faith. When the disciples did not immediately recognized Christ, he asked them: “Friends, haven’t you any fsh?” After their confrmation they had not, Christ replied: “Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will fnd some.” Upon doing so, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fsh. Teniers selected the emotionally charged moment when Christ is recognized and Peter steps into the water to meet Christ. The meeting of the calm and dignifed Saviour with the devout Saint Peter is purposefully contrasted and subtly isolated from the rest of the scene with the other disciples, who are struggling to secure their catch. Teniers rarely painted religious or mythological themes although there are examples from every phase of his career. 2 The Miraculous draught of fshes is a subject he painted on one more occasion, which is a slightly bigger version of our painting only known through an etching by Thomas Major (1714 or 1720-1799), published in 1752 in a John well-known print series called The Most Capital Paintings in England (fg. 1). 3 Because this type of theme is quite uncommon for Teniers and both treatments are executed on relatively big dimensions, the paintings may well have been commissions. Teniers’ religious scenes are mostly styled as genre pieces or they are set outdoors with the landscape taking precedence over the actual subject. Although the latter is not the case in the present work, Teniers did seize the occasion to explore the landscape motif here, while at the same time enlivening it with anecdotal, genre-like detail of which the lovely scene in the background is a fne example. The sweeping seascape and beautiful sky, with its arresting atmospheric efects, such as the bundle of concentrated sunlight breaking through the cloud formations, are superbly executed and heighten the drama of the religious scene. Margret Klinge (op. cit.) dates the present painting to the end of the 1650s, when the artist was living in Brussels. This painting is to be included in the forthcoming monograph with catalogue raisonné, currently in preparation by Dr. Margret Klinge, Düsseldorf.\n\n1. This subject is the so-called second Miraculous draught of fshes, not to be confused with the more frequently depicted frst story related by Luke (5; 1-11), which took place before Christ’s death on the cross and which contains the well-known passage in which he tells his pupils: “from now on you will be fshers of men”. 2.

He was admitted to the Utrecht Guild of St. Luke in 1616 at the age of forty and was active in the city until 1660. He served as dean of the Guild in 1623-4. Droochsloot is known primarily for genre scenes, but he also painted landscapes and historical subjects.\n\nPROVENANCE: with van Diemen, The Hague. with P. de Boer, Amsterdam, 1939. Anonymous sale; Koller, Zurich; 18-22 June, 1985, lot 5057.\n\nThe fshing village of Egmond aan Zee with its sandy beaches and distinctive church, was a popular excursion site for numerous landscape painters in the 17th century. Although beach and coastal scenes make up only a small part of Salomon van Ruysdael’s oeuvre, he is known to have painted several views of Egmond aan Zee, in the early 1660s. The artist appears to have been drawn to the coast especially between 1660 and 1665, when he also depicts views of Zantvoort and Scheveningen.\n\nThe present view is thus rare in his oeuvre, as it is painted much earlier than his other depictions of beach villages. Furthermore, this view shows the approach to the village looking towards the sea, unlike Ruysdael’s other depictions of Egmond aan Zee, in which the village is usually seen from the other side.\n\n56 Cornelis Snellinck (Rotterdam or Antwerp? c.1605-1669 Rotterdam) Noah’s Ark signed ‘c. snellinck’ (lower right) oil on panel 90.4 x 125 cm. €10,000-15,000\n\nUS$13,000-19,000\n\nPROVENANCE: with Kunstgalerie Tomasz Metlewicz, Vienna, by 1970.\n\nA larger version of the present composition, also executed on panel, was with Noortman, Maastricht by 2007.

Private Collection. with P. de Boer, Amsterdam, by 1997, where acquired in 2000 by the present owners.\n\nBetween enormous, awe-inspiring clifs, brick huts and wooden structures sit along the coastline of a bay. The extremely large scale of the landscape and the overcast sky make the primitive architecture, workmen and vessels on the water appear insignifcant. The ships fy Dutch fags and the Amsterdam painter Jan Beerstraten no doubt represented part of a Dutch overseas colony. By the 1650s, when Beerstraten painted this coastal view, the Dutch Republic conducted trade in many and remote corners of the world. Given the northern and isolated outlook of the landscape Dr. Thomas Fusenig suggests in a letter, dated 19 November 2009, to the present owners that the site could be Smeerenburg. Smeerenburg was one of the settlements on Amsterdam, a small island north of Spitsbergen bordering on the Arctic Ocean, which was used for whale fshery. The Northern or Greenland Company, with ofces in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Delft, Hoorn and Enkhuizen, facilitated the whaling industry. The hunting took place during the summer months, initially close to the shores. Here settlements, such as Smeerenburg, were constructed, where the whales were cut up and the whale-oil refned. The crude houses on the beach, which are too small to be inhabited, are probably blubber ovens used for cooking the whale oil. Although whaling constituted an important commercial industry throughout the seventeenth century it only became a more frequently treated subject in painting during the last decades of the century. Paintings by Ludolf Backhuysen, Abraham van Salm, Wigerus Vitringa and Abraham Storck show the spectacle of whale hunting in pale wintery tonalities with ships in narrow waters amidst ice foes. In Beerstraten’s painting, which, given its quite large dimensions, must have been a commission, the sublime and savage landscape is the primary motif. Beerstraten not only very convincingly visualized the barren clifs and rocks, which he never can have studied in real life, but also the decidedly un-Dutch fall of light on the water and menacing cloudscape. The artist beautifully captured the eccentric poetry of the extreme landscape. A painting with a similar composition, but smaller in size, can be found in the Statens Museum, Copenhagen (inv. no. 44). The most notable diference being the clifs on the left side, depicted in the present painting, but not in the Statens Museum work.\n\n(detail)\n\n49\n\nPROPERTY FROM A DECEASED ESTATE (LOTS 58-63)\n\n58\n\n59\n\n58 Pieter Bout (Brussels 1658-1719) and Adriaen Fransz.

He spent the early part of his career under the infuence of Hendrick van Steenwijck the Elder and his son Hendrick van Steenwijck the Younger, whose works Neefs copied, for example in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden. In his Golden Cabinet of the noble art of painting of 1661, biographer Cornelis de Bie celebrated Neefs for his depiction of churches, praising in particular his representations of pillars, doors, portals and altars. He wrote that looking at his paintings produced the sensation of being in a church (C. de Bie, Golden Cabinet, Antwerp, 1661, p. 155). The elements praised by De Bie can all be found in the present church interior, which holds a strong resemblance to the Antwerp Cathedral, but, like most of Neefs’ works, contains elements of architectural fantasy.

Ie.20.\n\nColourful harbour scenes, replete with anecdotal detail, such as the present, were a specialty of Willaerts, and earned him early acclaim. In 1661 the Flemish author Cornelis de Bie praises the poetic qualities of his art and the 18th century artists’ biographer Arnold Houbraken singles out both the naturalness and artfulness as well as the degree of detail of his river scenes and marines as the foundation of his fame.1 Although this painting is generally dated to around 1630, the costumes of the elegantly dressed fgures in the foreground were the height of fashion around 1615, strongly suggesting that the work is relatively early and from that time.2 The carefully arranged composition of the imposing panoramic riverscape and the refned treatment of the landscape, vessels and fgures support an early date as well. Showing the artist at the peak of his creative powers, this capriccio is a supreme production of the master. The scene is imaginary, but the square church tower rising up from behind the city walls at the right is unmistakably modelled on that of the Buurkerk in Utrecht. Beautifully observed is the soft light of a setting sun, subtly spreading across the scene and calling up the atmosphere of a late afternoon. The stylized rendition of the fgures and many details, such as the small white-crested waves in the river, the trees and the fortifcations add a naive charm to the painting’s appeal. Adam Willaerts counts as one of the great pioneers of Dutch marine painting. Merging infuences of Southern Netherlandish art, in particular Jan Brueghel the Elder and Hendrick Vroom, he forged the signature style that became his trademark. In Utrecht, where he spent his entire productive life, the artist repeatedly fulflled leading positions in the painters’ guild and lead a busy studio, training numerous pupils, among them his three sons Abraham, Cornelis and Isaac, who would become competent painters in their own right.\n\n1.

(central piece); and 43 x 14.7 cm. (wings) €10,000-15,000\n\nUS$13,000-19,000\n\nThe present triptych is likely the fruit of a collaboration of diferent artists, as was a common practice in medieval workshops in Antwerp. The fgures might be of a diferent hand than the architecture, as well as the landscape elements in the immediate foreground, which have been meticulously rendered with a high degree of naturalism. The central composition is based on the left wing of Hans Memling’s diptychon in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich (inv. no. 680), which is dated to circa 1490. The state of conservation has been nicely preserved and the loose and sketchy underdrawing is beautifully visible in various parts, especially in Mary and the Child.\n\n67\n\n83\n\n83 Circle of Jan de Beer (Antwerp c. 1475-1528) The Lamentation of Christ tempera and oil on panel 90.8 x 117.7 cm. €5,000-7,000\n\nUS$6,400-8,900\n\n84 Bruges School, C. 1530 The Penitent Saint Jerome oil on panel 48.3 x 33.7 cm. €4,000-6,000\n\nUS$5,100-7,600\n\nPROVENANCE: Kommerzienrat Dr. Otto Gastell (1855-1924, a railway car manufacturer in Mainz); thence by descent to the present family member.\n\n84\n\n68 OLD MASTERS & 19 th CENTURY ART\n\n85\n\nLITERATURE:\n\n~85 Follower of Titian\n\nW.

Comparable to the latter’s portraits of the 1530s, the emperor is depicted bust-length, his body outlined against a blue background. The face is not idealized and reproduces Charles’ distinctive features with his prominent jaw and bulging lower lip. He wears a jewelled collar of fresteels, and although meticulously dispayed, it is missing the emblem of the Golden Fleece, usually hanging from the chain and referring to his royal status. This present lot is sold with a copy of an old certifcate, dated 20 September 1966, from Alfred Stange, attributing the painting to the workshop of Lucas Cranach and dating it to 1548.\n\n70 OLD MASTERS & 19 th CENTURY ART\n\n87\n\n89\n\n87 Circle of Antonio Moro (Utrecht 1519-1575 Antwerp) A portrait of Margaretha of Parma (1522-1586), bust-length, in a black brocade dress with an organza ruf and an elaborately decorated headdress oil on canvas 56.2 x 42.2 cm. in an Italian carved giltwood frame, second half 18th century €5,000-7,000\n\nUS$6,400-8,900\n\n88 Circle of Gerard David (Oudewater 1440-1523 Bruges) Christ as Salvator Mundi oil on panel 56.2 x 44.1 cm. €6,000-8,000\n\nUS$7,700-10,000\n\nPROVENANCE: Anonymous sale; Sotheby’s, Monaco, 19 June 1994, lot 600, where purchased by the present owner.\n\n88\n\nThis striking representation of Christ can be interpreted as the merging of the Salvator Mundi (the Saviour of the World) and the Vera Efgies. The frontal portrayal of Christ was established as early as the 13th century through a description contained in the so-called Letter of Lentulus and became standard in 15th century art. The composition derives from Quentin Massijs’ (1466-1530) Salvator Mundi in the Royal Museum, Antwerp (inv.no. 241).\n\n71\n\n90\n\n89 Follower of Pieter Coecke Van Aelst\n\n~90 Follower of Corneille de la Haye, called Corneille de Lyon\n\nThe Descent from the Cross\n\nPortrait of a cardinal, traditionally said to be Cesare Borgia (1475-1507), bust length, against a blue background\n\noil on panel 69.8 x 48.6 cm. €4,000-6,000\n\nUS$5,100-7,600\n\noil on panel 20.2 x 16.6 cm. €15,000-25,000\n\nThe prototype for the present composition was attributed to Pieter Coecke van Aelst by Friedländer in 1936 and described by Marlier as a pupil of Bernard van Orley (See: G.

Primarily known for his drawings, De Beijer is known to have painted very few pictures. The present painting, with its linear style and extensive graphic detailing, clearly reveals the artist’s training as a draughtsman and relates directly to a drawing with the same view (see: H. Romers, 2000, op. cit., no. 1030a) (fg. 1). In 1770 Paul van Liender produced a print after this composition, for Pieter Fouquet’s\n\nFig. 1.

Jacob Otten Husly, a Dutch architect and teacher, was likely the frst owner of this painting. He had an active interest in drawings and both the graphic style of De Beijer’s painting and the subject must have appealed to him. In the year before its execution, 1758, Otten Husly was the co-founder of a society that preceded the ‘Amsterdamse Stadstekenacademie’. In 1765 he became its director and in 1773 he founded the School for Drawing in Amsterdam. Otten Husly is best known as one of the earliest practitioners in The Netherlands of the Neo-Classical and Palladian style. He designed the Town Halls at Weesp and Groningen, and the Felix Meritis Society Building in Amsterdam. He also assisted in the decorations for the so-called Oval Room, the frst room of the Teylers Museum, Haarlem. The present lot was sold in 1798, together with one other painting and two drawings by Jan de Beijer, as part of his collection sale after he had died.

Leaning with his other hand on a stone balustrade, he stands in front of a magnifcent garden vase, a river landscape with sloping hills beyond. The scene takes place at dusk under a cloudy sky, evoking a lyric mood. A bright bundle of evening light illuminates the sitter’s face and attire, while the impatient black horse in the background, eager to be ridden by its owner, adds a sense of drama. The horse is a clear allusion to the sitter’s aristocratic aspirations. The latter’s exotic and expensive dress serve the same purpose. The padded gown of silk damask is loosely draped over the sitter’s shoulders, creating eloquent folds and giving the image a timeless air. Having studied with Rembrandt, Nicolaes Maes began his career in his native Dordrecht painting religious subjects, genre scenes and portraits. In the course of the 1660s Maes gradually developed the elegant signature style that would make him one of the most sought-after portrait painters of elite society in the country. The present work, painted in a refned palette of warm hues, is an exquisite example. The provenance of Maes’s portrait lists a few important owners. It no doubt entered the extremely diverse collection of the banker and collector Dr. Von Schnitzler of Cologne through his second wife, Ottilia Henriette Josephine Mumm von Schwarzenstein, daughter of the previous owner, the wine magnate Christian Mumm von Schwarzenstein. For many years Von Schnitzler played an active role in the cultural life of Cologne, especially in the Kölnischer Kunstverein, which promoted contemporary art, and as a supporter of the Wallraf-Richartz Museum. The next owner, Heinz Kisters, was a leading collector of Old Master Paintings and an art dealer in Cologne, who counted the German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer among his clients.\n\n83\n\nPROPERTY FROM THE COLLECTION OF A DUTCH LADY (LOTS 108-116)\n\n108\n\n108 Jan Baptist van Fornenburgh (Antwerp 1585-1648 The Hague) A lizard, rose, peaches and other fowers on a stone ledge signed with initials ‘.IB.

Ševcˇík (ed.), Hane Seifertové k 75. narozeninám, Prague 2009, pp. 46-51.\n\nThe present lot is a rather remarkable painting: not only is it a very rare subject within the oeuvre of De Heem, it also appears to be one of the very earliest, painted barn interiors in the history of Dutch art. Furthermore, there are no fgures present, which distinguishes it from any contemporary trend or genre tradition. Fred Meijer dates the picture to circa 1629 and states: “This early barn interior seems to have emerged without any specifc precedent.” Thusfar the earliest, dated barn interior is a drawing by Herman Saftleven of 1630. The genre of painted barn interiors emerged, mainly in Rotterdam, in the early 1630s, but often with a peasant couple or other fgures, such as in the oeuvres of Pieter de Bloot or Herman and Cornelis Saftleven. De Heem experimented with visual efects of space and light in an empty barn interior at least once more; one later composition, dated 1631, is known. We are grateful to Fred Meijer of the RKD, The Hague, for confrming the attribution and his kind help in cataloguing this lot.

To be included in the forthcoming monograph with catalogue raisonné currently in preparation by Dr. Margret Klinge, Düsseldorf.\n\nENGRAVED: Antoine Masson (1636-1700), etching 121 x 184 mm.\n\nIn the 1560s, Pieter Bruegel the Elder introduced peasants’ dances and weddings into Netherlandish art and from then onwards they remained a highly characteristic subject in Flemish genre painting. A worthy continuator and innovator of the rich tradition, Teniers made a specialty of them, often showing peasant weddings, kermesses and dancing and feasting peasants in front of taverns. Whereas Adriaen Brouwer, and occasionally Rubens, focussed on the excesses of peasant life, portraying base desires, Teniers advocated a more positive image of his rustic protagonists. In the present village feast, as in his numerous other interpretations of the subject, a merry, harmonious atmosphere prevails. This village feast is a late work, painted around 1680 as suggested by the dress of the fashionable violinist in the right middle zone. The colourful scene takes place at Castle Drij Toren, the artist’s proud and lordly possession, which here serves as a backdrop in the right background. Teniers had bought the estate in 1662/63 from Jan van Brouchoven, the second husband of Rubens’s second wife, Hélène Fourment. Drij Toren was situated in the small village of Perk halfway between Brussels and Mechelen, not far from Rubens’s castle Het Steen in Elewijt. Today, only an entrance gate is preserved of the complex of buildings. Looking at the multitude of drinking, eating and dancing peasants the artist’s utter joy in painting this beloved subject is apparent. A born storyteller with a keen eye for detail and thorough psychological understanding, Teniers’s scene vibrates with emotion and human interaction. Wonderful details are the still life of earthenware plates and bowls and a copper pot in the right foreground and the two magpies circling around the castle, strongly enhancing the suggestion of depth. The French painter and printmaker Antoine Masson (1636-1700) made an etching of the present painting, which, although undated, must have been executed quite soon after completion, implying that it had ended up in a French collection almost immediately. Much later, this lot surfaced in Paris with Baron de Beurnonville, whose collection was one of the most distinguished formed in France in the second half of the nineteenth century. Dispersed in sales between 1872 and 1906, it comprised more than 1,000 paintings, besides drawings and works of art. The emphasis was on Northern schools of the ffteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including for instance Rembrandt’s Landscape with an Obelisk of 1638 (Boston, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum), but French and Italian painting was represented by superior works as well, such as Drouais’s Portrait of Madame de Pompadour (London, National Gallery) and Tiepolo’s Triumph of Flora (San Francisco, M.H. de Young Memorial Museum). One other distinguished owner was the railway magnate Collis Potter Huntington, who also owned Vermeer’s Woman tuning a lute (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art) and who was the uncle of Henry E. Huntington, who founded the well-known Huntington Library in San Marino, California.\n\n(detail)\n\n126 No Lot\n\n97\n\n98 OLD MASTERS & 19 th CENTURY ART\n\n127\n\n127 Flemish School, late 18th Century Danaë\n\n128 Johann Friedrich August Tischbein (Maastricht 1750-1812 Heidelberg)\n\noil on canvas 133.4 x 185.5 cm.\n\nPortrait of a lady, bust-length, in a blue satin dress with white lace and a white ribbon\n\n€10,000-15,000\n\nUS$13,000-19,000\n\nPROVENANCE: (Possibly) with Georg A.
