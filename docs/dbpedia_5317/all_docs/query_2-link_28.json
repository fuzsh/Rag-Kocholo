        "text": "In Francisco de Holanda’s original account, Michelangelo asserts that the art of the Northerners is only suitable for the feeble-minded and has a strong emotional effect on them, for it concentrates on the mere surface of things and on deceiving the eye: ‘in Flanders they paint to deceive the gaze directed at the external’. We do not know whether the master ever said this; what is more important is that contemporary Dutchmen took the statement seriously. Both Karel van Mander and Samuel van Hoogstraten repeated that Michelangelo regarded oil as only fit for the weaker sex (calling it vrouwen ambacht, woman’s craft, and wijvenwerk, wives’ work). In their treatises, which contain specific information on artists’ materials and practical issues such as brushwork, the gendered language attributed to Michelangelo resonates. The gender division was related to the Italian stereotypical view of painting materials in the Netherlands, an assumption rooted in the myth about the invention of oil paint. It was said that this Netherlandish technique was pitting a deceptive, seductive, and illusory art against the true conception of art based on antiquity’s linear purity. Van Hoogstraten, for instance, said that Jan van Eyck only discovered oil paint ‘after long, alchemistic research’, a view he shared with his Italian predecessor, Vasari, who for the same reasons described Van Eyck as a ‘sophist’, seeking intellectual misdirection. As late as the eighteenth century, Arnold Houbraken condemned a style that indulged in the blending (verdrijven) of colors, which led to weak chiaroscuro and soft highlights, calling this a feminine (vrouwelyk) manner — in this, we hear a remote echo of De Holanda. This article explores the afterlife of Michelangelo’s remarks in Dutch art theory. Even though the fresco versus oil dichotomy lost its practical significance for painters in the Netherlands, the opposition of a masculine versus a feminine choice of materials, brushes and illusionistic techniques kept determining the debate throughout the century. The male-female opposition thus adds to that great opposition that Jan Emmens identified as the key differentiation in Dutch art theory: the pitting of learned against vulgar painting, which was essentially an elaboration of the ancient division between the Attic and Asian styles in rhetoric. As this article argues, Emmens ignored the opposition’s fundamentally gendered nature. It is striking that a very practical element of art theory — relating to binding medium, pigments and brushwork — became attached to a very indeterminate and wide-ranging one, namely gender. ‘Color’, in effect, appears as a problematic term with meanings ranging from the most material one (the pigment itself) to a metaphorical one (for instance, in relation to a woman’s makeup) and ultimately an ideological one (the ‘rhetorical colors’ that should be applied with utmost care for a text or artwork to remain persuasive). An echo of all these connotations resonates in the modern English — and Dutch — usage of the term ‘colored’ as, according to the Oxford Dictionary of English, ‘imbued with an emotive or exaggerated quality’.\n\nIn 1670 Willem Goeree (1635-1711) published a small treatise titled Inleyding tot de practijck der al-gemeene schilder-konst (Introduction to the practice of the general art of painting), which was the first of several writings on the arts. Eight years later Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627-1678) published his lengthier Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst (Introduction to the academy of painting). Even though art historians paid less attention to the versatile Goeree, when they discuss them the two writers together they are often treated as if they were of one accord. However, after reading the texts of Van Hoogstraten en Goeree, one might be struck more by the differences rather than by the similarities. They discuss comparable themes, but the reader seems at times to enter another world. Van Hoogstraten’s writings bear traits that are, for a large part, rooted in the old humanistic and traditional Aristotelian-scholastic school of 'bookish culture'. He shows an accumulative manner of collecting data, not only in his thoughts, but also in the way he transmits these thoughts. Goeree is just as long-winded, but we see a more analytical approach of his topics which at times reveal traces of the New Philosophy. Also an inclination to mathematize and analyse the arts forms a distinct contrast between the two authors. These differences become manifest on different levels: in the organization of their chapters, in the way they render their information, in their opinions on the intellectual development of the artist, and in their views on the aspect of chance in art.\n\nIn 1690 Gerard de Lairesse met the most dreaded destiny a painter can meet. He went blind. The last twenty-one years of his life he spent in darkness, pondering on art and conceiving a program that was meant to help future painters create images of unparalleled beauty and perfection. De Lairesse’s concepts first materialized in theGrondlegginge ter teekenkonst of 1701, and ultimately in the 1707 Groot Schilderboek,which was his greatest achievement. In art history, however, his magnum opus has often been misinterpreted and considered to be no more than a boring spin-off of earlier French art theory. This is making things too easy though, especially because De Lairesse’s encyclopedic treatise not only mentioned more of the so-called lower genres, but also proposed a coherent program for their reform. It is this aspect of De Lairesse’s work in particular that still represents much uncharted territory, and I have therefore chosen it as the focus of my book. That De Lairesse devoted so much space in his Groot Schilderboek to the lower genres was not at all a bad idea, for by the time he was dictating his thoughts to his sons, genre painting, landscape, portraiture and still-life dominated Dutch art production. Their evident popularity had led painters to specialize, and De Lairesse was sufficiently practical not to neglect or condemn this, but to take these specializations seriously and try and develop an agenda which might ennoble them. Another reason why these different genres played such an important role in De Lairesse’s writings on art, was because they had come to occupy an important place in the grand interiors of Amsterdam mansions, many of which De Lairesse had decorated himself. His elaborate painted ensembles in a classicist style would look best in combination with serious and elegant pictures in the collections of his patrons too. Completely in tune with this ideal, which most late 17th-century Dutch art lovers must have shared, the Groot Schilderboek provided painters with detailed instructions on how to bestow their works of art with the qualities of the antique, no matter what genre they worked in. In this fashion De Lairesse not only tried to convert others to his own artistic idiom, but also helped his fellow artists to cope with the ebb and flow of the Dutch art market, which at that time was indeed undergoing a major transformation. Comparing and contrasting the program for the lower genres as presented in the Groot Schilderboek with what is found in earlier art literature, as well as contextualizing it within contemporary Dutch theory and practice, this book will present De Lairesse as a true pioneer in the domain of art theory. It will explain how he employed the antique to transfer the qualities of history painting onto its less important kin, so as to uplift these lesser genres, to make them worthwhile of an enlightened patron’s interest, and perhaps even fit to be presented next to the finest of histories."
