        "text": "Accompanying the related exhibition, Leiden circa 1630: Rembrandt Emerges illuminates the early career of Rembrandt and his peers. Essays explore the artists in broader contexts, including Leiden’s historical and cultural profile, process and novelty in printmaking, the city’s art market and the history of collecting paintings by the master in Canada. The four essays, accompanied by entries on the works featured in the exhibition, offer profound insight into the motivations, aspirations and achievements of an extraordinary group of artists.\n\nCommissioned by the Dutch Association of Art Historians (VNK), every year a young art historian is asked to compile a bibliography. This year's bibliography is focused on fine and decorative arts from the period of 1550-1700. It gives an overview of all the scientific publications by Dutch art historians published between 2014 and 2018. With a clear categorization and artists ordered alphabetically, it is a useful and interdisciplinary tool for all art historians interested in the early modern period. With a preface by prof. dr. Reinier Baarsen"
