It is certain that he was baptised in Antwerp in 1649 and that he studied under the older artist of the same name, worked closely with him and probably also accompanied him on journeys to the Danish court. Both Gysbrechts were famous for their extremely refined trompe l'oeil paintings.\n\nThe present painting, signed by Franciscus Gysbrechts, shakes the viewer's secure point of view in many ways. On the first level, it depicts a wooden wall in the studio: A shelf attached to a wooden wall with painting utensils lying on it leads the viewer into the artist's working space. The semicircular upper end of the painting with the painted blue curtain was added later. On the shelf is a Vanitas still life lavishly staffed with a wide variety of elements, which in turn has trompe-l'oeil qualities: the objects in a stone niche are painted so vividly that they seem to project not only into the pictorial space of the (painted) studio, but also into that of the real viewer. Similar colours and similar materials in the different picture levels intertwine them in a sophisticated way. A play on being and appearance. This in turn leads to the level of content of the picture painted in the painting. Multiple objects demonstrate that the world of the senses and earthly wealth is fleeting and vain. Time, transience and death are to be brought to the viewer's mind, whereby the crown of corn stalks worn by the skull points to the Eucharist and the eternal life that is actually to be striven for.\n\nWith the \"total painting\", Franciscus Gysbrechts thus also questions the ephemeral art of painting itself with all its sophistication, and challenges the viewer to permanently question his real and spiritual standpoints.\n\nContact:\n\nDr. Davide Dossi\n\nFine Art\n\n+49 221 92 58 62 200\n\nPrint this lot | Recommend lot |"
