Use the Real Presence Eucharistic Education and Adoration Association PEA Manual as a guide to put a PEA chapel in your parish.\n\nDue to the possibility that a site has been closed or merged with another parish, please confirm that the information for a particular Eucharistic Adoration site is still valid by contacting the parish directly, either by phone or by checking online via searching the web.\n\n\"The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.\" (John 12:35-36)"
