        "text": "On June 1, 2023, Bishop David Konderla of the Diocese of Tulsa and Eastern Oklahoma, consecrated Saint Francis Health System Sacred Heart of Jesus to entrust its staff, patients and visitors - past, present and future - and all of our locations and work to His blessings of mercy and healing.\n\nThe Sacred Heart of Jesus is an image of the love of God, which is at the center of Catholic healthcare. The image, illustrating Jesus’ heart—wounded by the soldier’s lance and enflamed with love—is a reminder that God’s love for us is like a blazing fire in which we place all our hope, particularly when we suffer.\n\nThe Sacred Heart teaches us that the healing Christ offers is not an escape from woundedness, or the erasing of all the painful events of our life. The healing Jesus brings is that which comes from taking refuge in His heart. In Christ’s love, we receive courage and strength to “stand in the wound,” inviting Him to bring forth blessings from our suffering, just as He poured blessings upon us from His cross.\n\nIn acknowledgement of the unique suffering the tragedy of June 1, 2022 brought, the Consecration offers us an opportunity to invite God to heal us in our woundedness and, as wounded healers, to extend His presence and healing ministry in all we do."
