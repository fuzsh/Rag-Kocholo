        "text": "In the early days before statehood of what is now Oklahoma, missionary priests rode by horseback or drove by buggy across the land. So zealous were these missionary priests for the salvation of souls, to which great work they had dedicated their lives, that they willingly suffered the hardships of inclement weather, hunger, thirst, and numerous other inconveniences inseparable from pioneer missionary labor.\n\nForemost among these early missionary priests was Father Felix Degrasse, O.S.B, a monk of Sacred Heart Abbey, Sacred Heart, Oklahoma. In the early 1890's, Fr. Felix began celebrating Mass in Shawnee in the homes of early settlers; the Timmonses, the Cassidys, The Dierkers, the Gleasons and the Philip Secks. Later Welch's Feed Store on West Main Street cam to be used regularly for Sunday Mass.\n\nIn August of 1895 Father Felix Degrasse, O.S.B., purchased lots at the corner of Ninth and Park Streets and construction of the first church and rectory under the title of St. Benedict began. The first church was built in the style of an auditorium and when St. Benedict School opened in October of 1896, and was housed in this building the sanctuary was separated from the school during school hours by a curtain. A large pot-bellied stove served as the source of heat and kerosene lamps furnished the light.\n\nBy 1905, St. Benedict Parish had grown quite noticeably and there was much talk of needing a new church and of changing location. One Sunday, ad Father Maurus Fuerstenberg, O.S.B., the associate pastor, was asking what should be done about it, a long freight train came puffing and whistling by and that incident decided the question. In due time, therefore, the present site of the Church at Kickapoo and Benedict Streets was purchased and the church building from Ninth and Park Streets was moved to the new location. On July 29 1906, the cornerstone of a new brick church was laid and on May 12, 1907, the new St. Benedict Church was dedicated.\n\nIn 1915, the old church building was sold to Peter Marak, Sr., who moved it to the corner of Kickapoo and Dewey streets and used the building as a grocery store and feed store. There it stayed until destroyed by a cyclone on March 28, 1924.\n\nIn 1962, under the pastorship of Father James Murphy, O.S.B., the inside of the church underwent extensive remodeling. In 2006, the stained glass windows were refurbished and plate glass was installed on the outside to fit the tracery of the wood frames and ventilated. The wood frames were also repaired and painted.\n\nSt. Benedict Parishioners continue their journey of faith, worshiping daily in St. Benedict Church. The mission of the parish continues to be: \"a worshiping Roman Catholic Community in Shawnee, Oklahoma, who strive to live the mission of Jesus Christ through prayers, the Sacraments, the study of His work, the teachings of His Church, and through stewardship. The parishioners are committed to minister to all parishioners and non-parishioners with love, respect and support. Inspired by God, with the aid of the Holy Spirit, they wish to achieve a true sense of family and help all attain eternal life.\""
