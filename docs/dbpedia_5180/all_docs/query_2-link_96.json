        "text": "The FCS (formerly called I-AA) enters its 47th season in 2024 after beginning in 1978. In honor of that history, here are 47 players to know for the 2024 season.\n\nThis is not a ranking of the top 47 players in the FCS, meaning some fan-favorite players will be left off the list. However, those players are likely to be on the national radar all season long.\n\nThat said, let's dive into the 47-player list.\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nMark Gronowski | South Dakota State\n\nTommy Mellott | Montana State\n\nCam Miller | North Dakota State\n\nAidan Bouman | South Dakota\n\nCole Gonzalez | Western Carolina\n\nWill McElvain | Central Arkansas\n\nConnor Watkins | Villanova\n\nClifton McDowell | McNeese\n\nThe most important player to know this year in the FCS is Mark Gronowski, the reigning Walter Payton Award winner for two-time defending champion South Dakota State. Then there are playoff stalwarts Tommy Mellott and Cam Miller and Montana State and North Dakota State. Keep an eye out for Clifton McDowell at McNeese, who transferred there after starting in the FCS title game for Montana.\n\nQB1: 2024's post-transfer portal top 10 returning FCS quarterbacks\n\nRunning backs\n\nMalik Grant | Rhode Island\n\nJarett Hunter | Howard\n\nJaMar Curtis | Lafayette\n\nLan Larison | UC Davis\n\nEli Gillman | Montana\n\nKayvon Britten | Tarleton State\n\nBronson Yoder | William & Mary\n\nCollin Guggenheim | Nicholls\n\nThere are plenty of talented running backs in the FCS this year. Malik Grant was a star at Sacred Heart before transferring to Rhode Island this fall and JaMar Curtis had a breakout season leading Lafayette to the Patriot League title. Speaking of the postseason, we last saw Jarett Hunter lead Howard to the Celebration Bowl and reigning Jerry Rice Award winner Eli Gillman lead Montana to the FCS title game.\n\nGAMES TO WATCH: The 20 best nonconference games for the 2024 FCS season\n\nWide receivers\n\nCarter Bell | South Dakota\n\nNick DeGennaro | Richmond\n\nEfton Chism III | Eastern Washington\n\nJunior Bergen | Montana\n\nWe all should know Junior Bergen's name after his electrifying playoff run both as a receiver and as a returner in 2023. All of the wide receivers on this list can take over a game.\n\nOffensive line\n\nGus Miller | South Dakota State\n\nEvan Beerntsen | South Dakota State\n\nNick Taiste | South Carolina State\n\nJackson Slater | Sacramento State\n\nCharles Grant | William & Mary\n\nMarcus Wehr | Montana State\n\nGus Miller and Evan Beerntsen lead what's expected to again be one of the best offensive lines in the FCS, even after South Dakota State lost linemen to the NFL. Yet, the Big Sky might have the top two offensive linemen in the country, Jackson Slater and Marcus Wehr, who have NFL aspirations of their own. Don't sleep on Nick Taiste or Charles Grant on the east coast; both could be First-Team All-Americans come season's end.\n\nUPSET ALERT: 12 potential FCS-over-FBS upsets in 2024\n\nDefensive linemen\n\nCkelby Givens | Southern\n\nElijah Williams | Morgan State\n\nNick Gaes | South Dakota\n\nBrody Grebe | Montana State\n\nDavid Walker | Central Arkansas\n\nMarlon Taylor | Chattanooga\n\nJosiah Silver | New Hampshire\n\nFinn Claypool | Drake\n\nThe list of defensive linemen is a good mix of pass rushers and run stoppers from inside and on the edge. Leading the group is David Walker, a third-place finisher for the Buck Buchanan Award in 2022 and a finalist in 2023. My favorite interior rusher is Ckelby Givens from Southern, who finished last year with 21 tackles for loss and seven sacks.\n\n2024 HBCU football: Following the 2024 HBCU football season from start to finish\n\nLinebacker\n\nAdam Bock | South Dakota State\n\nJames Conway | Fordham\n\nAmir Abdullah | Illinois State\n\nMicah Davey | McNeese\n\nWhen healthy, Adam Bock is one of the best defensive players in the FCS. If he stays healthy all season, expect him to live up to the billing. James Conway has made no fewer than 127 tackles in his first three seasons. He's 163 tackles away from the career record. Micah Davey is a tackling machine, while Amir Abdullah is a terror of the edge.\n\nPORTAL: 2024 FCS transfer portal recap\n\nDefensive backs\n\nKhalil Baker | Elon\n\nKendall Bohler | Florida A&M\n\nRex Connors | UC Davis\n\nCaleb Curtain | Elon\n\nTaMuarion Wilson | Central Arkansas\n\nCole Wisniewski | North Dakota State\n\nAbraham Williams | Idaho\n\nTrevin Gradney | Montana\n\nTucker Large | South Dakota State\n\nThere's plenty of star power in the secondary this year. Cole Wisniewski was dominant last year, and TaMaurion Wilson and Rex Connors are always around the football. Kendall Bohler has shutdown corner potential on the outside, while Tucker Large is known for his timely turnovers for the two-time defending champions. Large also contributes to the return game, but the best return man in all of college football is Abraham Williams. Williams, a Weber State transfer, heads to Idaho this fall and is only two kickoff returns for touchdowns away from tying the NCAA career record at seven total."
