        "text": "Breakfast and Lunch Program\n\nSacred Heart Catholic School operates a breakfast and lunch program. The cost of lunch is $2.75 and breakfast is $1.75. Please send payment in an envelope with each child’s name and grade marked on it. Families may send one check and it will be divided among siblings. If you would like to eat with your child in the cafeteria, please call the office by 9:00 a.m. to reserve a lunch. Remember to sign in at the school office before going to the cafeteria. Payment for the adult lunch should be made in the office. Guests may not charge their lunch to their child’s account. Occasionally the lunch menu may be changed without notice due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nSacred Heart participates in the federal lunch program sponsored by the United States government. This program provides for free or reduced breakfast and lunch to qualifying families. The application is available through the school office. You must apply each year. Until the application is approved and parents are notified, the cost for lunch is $2.75 and breakfast is $1.75. Parents are advised to complete and turn in the application before school starts.\n\nAs part of the federal lunch program, each school must publish the federal government’s procedure on how to file a Civil Rights complaint. The procedure follows: all complaints, written or verbal, will be accepted by SHCS and submitted to the School Nutrition Programs, Oklahoma Department of Human Services or sent directly to Director, Office of Civil Rights, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW Washington, D.C. 20250-9410, or 800-795-3272 (voice) or 202-720-6382 (TTY). It is necessary that the information provided be sufficient to determine the identity of the agency or individual toward which the complaint is directed, and to indicate the possibility of a violation. Only the USDA Director of Civil Rights can reject a complaint based on lack of merit. Anonymous complaints shall be handled as any other complaint.\n\nThe federal lunch program requires that milk be served with the meal. Students who are allergic to milk must provide the school cafeteria with a doctor’s note indicating the allergy. Juice will be substituted for milk in those cases. This must be provided each year. There is not a microwave oven available for student use.\n\nFast food lunches (McDonald’s, Sonic, etc.) may not be brought to school for lunch. Students may not bring glass containers or carbonated beverages. All food must be consumed in the cafeteria unless the classroom teacher gives permission. Breakfast from home must be consumed before entering the cafeteria.\n\nStudents in grades 6 – 8 may purchase extra items from the cafeteria. Students on the free or reduced lunch program may also purchase extra items; however, the extra items must be paid for at the full cost. Students on the free or reduced lunch program who bring a lunch from home and take milk or juice will be charged the full price for the milk or juice."
