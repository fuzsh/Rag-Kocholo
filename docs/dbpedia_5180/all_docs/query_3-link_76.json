        "text": "Schools at War Scrapbooks\n\nThis collection was prepared from 1942-1943 by 253 individual Oklahoma schools both public and parochial. The scrapbooks document each school's efforts to support WWII. All of the scrapbooks list the schoolâ€™s name, number of enrollment, number of teachers, and dollar amount of scrap gathered. Images in the scrapbooks include school buildings, students, towns, and cities where schools are located. Short school histories, compositions, and drawings by students and newspaper clippings are also found between the pages of these scrapbooks."
