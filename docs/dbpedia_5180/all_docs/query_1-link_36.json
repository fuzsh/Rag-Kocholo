        "text": "Sacred Heart Abbey Cemetery is located east of Asher and west of Konawa. From the intersection of Hwy. 177 and Hwy. 39, go east on Hwy. 39 for seven miles. At NS-348, turn left and go north almost one mile. Turn left and proceed west about 1/2 mile {on past the church} until you come to a gate and the Sacred Heart Mission sign. Proceed through the gate to the top of the hill. Turn left and go maybe 200 yards. The cemetery is on your left. I have listed the graves by row starting from the west end of the cemetery with plots proceeding from north to south. Examples: R2-4 would be the fourth grave in from the north end of row 2. R1-3 would be the third grave in from the north end of the first row at the west end of the cemetery. Note: Many of the name plates are missing from the crosses and could not be included here."
