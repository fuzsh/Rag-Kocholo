        "text": "The first mass at The Blessed Stanley Rother shrine will take place this weekend. It's also the joining of 2 parishes, Sacred Heart and Holy Angels. But, the creation of this new parish, means the closing of Holy Angels, which has been around for nearly 100 years.\n\nWhen Holy Angels’ doors were first opened, there was rarely any extra space.\n\n“I looked forward to it every Sunday, just to see our people,” Father Russell Hewes said.\n\nHoly Angels was a place of joy.\n\n“All the children, there were so many children. It was just amazing, all these people,” Father Hewes said. “It just kept getting fuller and fuller.”\n\nNow, Holy Angels stands empty.\n\n“Just a lot of good memories here,” Father Hewes said. “It was a beautiful place. Our friendships that were established, our faith, our encounters with God, prayers we said together.”\n\nThis past weekend was the last service at Holy Angels.\n\n“You know, when you close up a parish, it’s like a death in the family,” Father Hewes said.\n\nThis weekend the parish will join those at Sacred Heart in the new shrine of The Blessed Stanley Rother."
