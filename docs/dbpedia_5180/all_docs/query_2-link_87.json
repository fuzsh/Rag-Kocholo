        "text": "William “Bill” August Glotzbach, 87, Paxico, Kansas, passed away Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at his home surrounded by family. Bill was born March 8, 1937, on the family farm near Paxico, the son of Vincent M. & Juanita A. (Stitz) Glotzbach. He later raised his own family on the same farm where he was born.\n\nOn June 14, 1958, Bill and Virginia H. Michaelis were united in marriage at Holy Name Catholic Church in Alma, Kansas. They celebrated 66 years of marriage and raised eight children.\n\nBill is survived by his wife Virginia; children: Donna (Mark) Lytle, Lansing; Charles Glotzbach, Georgia; Wayne Glotzbach; Vincent (Annette) Glotzbach; Mary (Randy Miller) Glotzbach, all of Paxico; Dorothy (Billy) Hughart, Shawnee; Lynn (Jack) Metz; Keith (Valerie) Glotzbach, both of Topeka; his brother Merle (Rita) Glotzbach, Paxico; and sister, Marian (Bob) Hutley, Oregon; 34 Grandkids, 60 Great Grandkids with one on the way, and six Great Great Grandkids.\n\nBill was preceded in death by his parents, his sisters, Nadine Seitz, Laverne Hurla, Sr., Philomene Glotzbach, Rose Steck, and a great granddaughter Autumn Smith.\n\nWhile he grew up farming and continued to farm the family ground, he had bigger dreams. He took mail order courses to become a refrigerator repairman and then started Bill’s Refrigeration in 1968. He proudly served the surrounding communities for over 50 years before he retired. It changed names over the years as his business expanded but he always took the time to get to know his customers on a personal level and took care of them like family. He would tell us of a high school teacher that told him he needed to study more or he’d end up being a ditchdigger. Years later he dug that teacher’s grave.\n\nHis pride and joy, besides his kids, was his 1954 Bel Air that he and mom refinished after he retired. We thought he was nuts when he drug home this packrat-filled, rusty old car but he proved us wrong. He was a member of the Flint Hills Eliminator Car Club. He and mom enjoyed taking the ’54 to car shows over the years and won many awards. Together they traveled the first half of the Route 66 trip from Chicago down to Oklahoma in the ‘54.\n\nBill also refinished his 1979 Chevrolet dually work pickup truck and a John Deere 60 tractor that he farmed with. He enjoyed driving his tractor through the Flint Hills as a member of the Flint Hills Tractor Club.\n\nHe enjoyed working in his vegetable garden, never had enough flowers growing around the yard and he would crochet during the winter months. Every child, grandchild and some great grandchildren have a treasured crocheted blanket from him.\n\nMass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 10:00 am Saturday August 10, 2024, at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, 22298 Newbury Rd, Paxico, Kansas 66526. Interment will be at the Sacred Heart Catholic Cemetery. Bill will lie in state at Sacred Heart Church and the family will receive friends from 5:00 pm until the Rosary at 7:00 pm on Friday, August 9, 2024. Bill was an active member of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, Knights of Columbus Council, and he was a 4th Degree Knight. Memorial contributions may be made to the Sacred Heart Catholic Church or the Knights of Columbus Council #1392."
