        "text": "We asked: Longtime San Diego Chargers quarterback and fan favorite Philip Rivers has retired after 17 NFL seasons. How will you most remember him?\n\nRivers was about more than football\n\nEven though the Chargers left their decades-long home in San Diego, I never stopped rooting for Philip Rivers. Though the team moved two hours north, the distance couldn’t be measured in miles; despite the schism, I still pulled for No. 17. Growing up, I was always a fan of football, but after the team in my own backyard acquired Rivers in a draft day trade when I was in my teens, I started to become a San Diego Chargers fan.\n\nAll the memories that stick out in my Chargers fandom have Rivers at its center — the 2006 14-2 year, the AFC Championship year, the 4-8 year when they were left for dead and made the playoffs, the playoff win over the Colts at the Q, where the buzz from Mission Valley was felt all over San Diego County, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention blown fourth-quarter leads and heartbreaking losses. But who remembers the bad times when the good times were so good?\n\nYou felt the electricity in the air going to Chargers games: getting off the trolley, making your way to the most brutal structure known as Qualcomm Stadium (R.I.P.), but knowing No. 17 was on the field you knew you had a shot to win the game, and I will always be glad that I got to see a Chargers victory in person in their final season in America’s Finest City.\n\nTo Chargers fans, he was a fiery competitor with infectious enthusiasm who always gave it his all. To competitors he was a G-rated trash talker who will point out when defenders are lined up incorrectly, but he always had personality, and to San Diegans he will always be a legend.\n\n<bsp-module data-state=\"{\"cms.site.owner\":{\"_ref\":\"00000163-26ee-da3a-a1ff-6eefbc380000\",\"_type\":\"ae3387cc-b875-31b7-b82d-63fd8d758c20\"},\"cms.content.publishDate\":1611931212559,\"cms.content.publishUser\":{\"_ref\":\"00000169-a62f-dc05-abeb-a76fb0f90000\",\"_type\":\"6aa69ae1-35be-30dc-87e9-410da9e1cdcc\"},\"cms.content.updateDate\":1611931212559,\"cms.content.updateUser\":{\"_ref\":\"00000169-a62f-dc05-abeb-a76fb0f90000\",\"_type\":\"6aa69ae1-35be-30dc-87e9-410da9e1cdcc\"},\"module\":{\"internalName\":\"Responses from social media\",\"rawHtml\":\"\n\n\\\\n\n\n\\\\n\n\n\\\\n\n\n\\\\n\n\n\",\"_id\":\"00000177-4e94-def3-a7ff-5ed773e50001\",\"_type\":\"6f306102-b80d-3eee-867b-5033471f141b\"},\"theme.00000166-300c-ddc8-a177-f44f8d870000.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs.alignment\":null,\"theme.00000166-300c-ddc8-a177-f44f8d870000.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template\":null,\"_id\":\"00000177-4e94-def3-a7ff-5ed773c70000\",\"_type\":\"c5b60bfe-fc18-3e1d-bd70-75608e803f66\"}”>\n\nOf course, people can point out his draft day cohorts won several Super Bowls but there is more to life than hardware, passing yards and touchdowns. It’s what you mean to the people in your city and community. When he was first drafted he even spoke at my Catholic high school about the importance of faith, which he wore on his sleeve. And San Diego also meant a lot to Rivers: He even gave the scoop on his retirement to the U-T, the paper that followed his playing career the closest. It’s the little things.\n\nNo. 17 retired after a symmetrical 17 years in the league. Nunc coepi is a phrase Rivers used in his retirement statement. It’s a Latin phrase that means “Now I begin.” Life is an endless series of beginnings and endings, and now I will have to begin watching football again without my favorite quarterback and the player that means the most to me.\n\nWhat else can be said, other than the man rocked a bolo tie like no other. Happy trails, Philip Rivers.\n\nDustan Reidinger, Lemon Grove\n\nNo. 17 left his mark on the sports scene\n\nAs lifelong San Diego (not Los Angeles) Chargers season ticket holders, my family and I had the pleasure of watching some great quarterbacks. The likes of John Hadl, Dan Fouts, Drew Brees and, finally, Philip Rivers made every game an exciting prospect.\n\nI will admit that I was not an instant Rivers fan. I was mad that ownership gave up on Brees when he was injured in a meaningless game, trying to recover a loose ball. However, Rivers grew on me rather quickly. He led the team with skill, passion and exuberance. His G-rated tirades were fun to watch and usually fired up the team as well as the fans.\n\n<bsp-module data-state=\"{\"cms.site.owner\":{\"_ref\":\"00000163-26ee-da3a-a1ff-6eefbc380000\",\"_type\":\"ae3387cc-b875-31b7-b82d-63fd8d758c20\"},\"cms.content.publishDate\":1611931330100,\"cms.content.publishUser\":{\"_ref\":\"00000169-a62f-dc05-abeb-a76fb0f90000\",\"_type\":\"6aa69ae1-35be-30dc-87e9-410da9e1cdcc\"},\"cms.content.updateDate\":1611931330100,\"cms.content.updateUser\":{\"_ref\":\"00000169-a62f-dc05-abeb-a76fb0f90000\",\"_type\":\"6aa69ae1-35be-30dc-87e9-410da9e1cdcc\"},\"module\":{\"internalName\":\"rivers retires\",\"rawHtml\":\"\n\n\\\\n\n\n\\\\n\n\n\\\\n\n\n\\\\n\n\n\",\"_id\":\"00000177-4e97-def3-a7ff-5ed740f20007\",\"_type\":\"6f306102-b80d-3eee-867b-5033471f141b\"},\"theme.00000166-300c-ddc8-a177-f44f8d870000.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs.alignment\":null,\"theme.00000166-300c-ddc8-a177-f44f8d870000.:core:enhancement:Enhancement.hbs._template\":null,\"_id\":\"00000177-4e97-def3-a7ff-5ed740d50000\",\"_type\":\"c5b60bfe-fc18-3e1d-bd70-75608e803f66\"}”>\n\nOn and off the field, Philip Rivers is a class act. He wore his heart on his sleeve and left it in San Diego when ownership heartlessly moved the team north. His love of family, faith and community are stellar traits that have endeared him to San Diegans. His work with foster children through his foundation exemplify his love and care for the most vulnerable members of our community.\n\nI finally came to realize that the signings of Brees in New Orleans and Rivers in San Diego were cathartic for both cities. I will always remember Philip staying on the field long after the clock ran out on his last game at Qualcomm. He made his way around the stadium perimeter, talking to fans with tears in his eyes. It was a sad moment but one that will remain with me forever. Philip Rivers, the man and player, is on my Mount Rushmore list of greatest San Diego quarterbacks ever.\n\nKathy Cappos Hardy, Chula Vista\n\nRivers always will be tied to San Diego\n\nI was an intensely devoted San Diego Chargers fan for 56 years because of my dad. When the Chargers left San Diego, I was devastated and very sad. However, I have learned to cherish my blessing of being a fan all those years.\n\nOne of the ways I dealt with the loss was to keep following Philip Rivers and Antonio Gates (until he retired). I have a great love and admiration for Rivers. There are many qualities I admire about him — love of family, his moral values, his love of football, his treatment of fellow players, his appreciation of the San Diego fans (which he mentioned in his retirement speech).\n\nI was impressed with Rivers keeping his home in San Diego while in Los Angeles and commuting every week during the season. Also, a couple of years ago during the season he came back to San Diego specifically to be at the 2019 Salute to Champions. All this demonstrates his love of family, San Diego fans and our beautiful city.\n\nHe has always tried to help fellow players and to share his enthusiasm for the game with them. He treats all those with whom he is involved in football with respect. This shows his love of the game and of his fellow human beings.\n\nHis love of his family is amazing to me. What a role model he is as a husband and father. I believe all of his children except one were born in San Diego. let’s fact check. I am happy they were able to spend part of their lives in wonderful San Diego. I love the way Rivers talks — so down-to-earth, simple and direct, expressing emotions and thoughts in a manner respectful of persons of all ages.\n\nAs a fan I thank Rivers for all of the excitement of his play for so many years. Whether or not he was feeling well physically he always came to the field 100 percent. I cherish all the games I watched at the stadium as a season ticket holder or on television.\n\nI have a dream that brings me much happiness. It is of the day when San Diego fans can locally celebrate Rivers and all that he means to us. Also we will be celebrating the induction of Rivers into the NFL Hall of Fame, I am certain.\n\nPamela Beckett Stahl, Escondido\n\nRivers’ love of his community showed\n\nHow will I remember Philip Rivers? Let me count the ways: leader, hard worker, dedicated, loyal, determined, tough, learner, competitor, always honoring his opponent — just a good old southern boy with old-school values. I will remember Rivers most for being the loving family man San Diegans learned to admire as a hero and role model all sports fanatics crave. It is hard to believe that it was 17 years ago when that other guy presented San Diegans with such a memorable gift demanding a trade as soon as the San Diego Chargers honored him with the first round draft pick in the college draft. Holy moly, my children were 21 and 19 years of age, and good golly, I was 47 when the San Diego Chargers made Rivers a Charger.\n\nMy favorite San Diego Charger of all time still is Lance Alworth. As a young fan I had a 6-foot poster on my bedroom door, but LaDanian Tomlinson is up there, and Rivers is right near “Bambi,” too. I’m proud to say I have been a San Diego Chargers fan since my parents used to drop my brother, Ed, and me off at Balboa Stadium to watch childhood idols like John Hadl, Paul Lowe, Keith Lincoln, “Speedy” Duncan, Willie Frazier, Dan Fouts, Junior Seau, Ernie Ladd and Earl Faison, among many others who played the sport we all dreamed of playing during the two-hand touch games we played on our dead-end street on Maple Street off Fairmont Avenue.\n\nHe turned in so many monumental performances it is hard to remember all of them, but in general he made so many players better because of his knowledge of the game and grit. One of his top receivers out because of an injury or leaving the club for greener pastures and free agency? No problem, he would make the receiver who had never played much in the NFL an overnight star with his guidance and encouragement along with his uncanny accuracy.\n\nI wish Rivers well in his quest to guide a high school football team to success in Alabama. I thank him for so many enjoyable hours watching his San Diego Chargers football teams on Sunday afternoons. Thank you for always doing your job the best it could be done despite having such greedy owners. Maybe Rivers will bring his football team out west to play the Poway Titans in one of those first games of the season. It would be nice for this former two-time season ticket holder and all San Diego Chargers fans to have one more opportunity to give Rivers one more standing ovation.\n\nJim Valenzuela, Poway\n\nRivers made friends playing for Chargers\n\nPhilip Rivers is/was by far my favorite player. So many exciting years in San Diego, then the dagger of going to Los Angeles. Ouch.\n\nHeck, I became a Colts fan for this past season. Always doing his best, competing to the very end with 100 percent. He “should” have been in at least two Super Bowls, but that’s the breaks. A few missed field goals and some key team mistakes cost him big time, but not his fault. He’s one of the top quarterbacks of all time, in my opinion.\n\nI’m just really glad he came to San Diego. He was appreciated and admired by so many here. A real team player and he must have been the greatest teammate to play with. A gentleman, family man — who wouldn’t want him for a next-door neighbor? Seriously missing him already. Without Rivers, and the Chargers now in Los Angeles — they could have been the “SoCal Chargers” — I’m just losing my interest in any special team.\n\nHe’s a special man moving on to the next phase in life. Thanks, Philip, for so many fond memories.\n\nClif Quinn, Blossom Valley"
