        "text": "Philip Rivers welcomed his 10th child with his wife, Tiffany Rivers.\n\nThe former NFL quarterback announced earlier this month that his wife gave birth to their son Andrew Joseph Rivers on Oct. 30.\n\n“It’s awesome. Tiffany is awesome,” he said during an interview with AL.com. “It doesn’t matter if it’s the first child or the 10th child. It’s an awesome miracle every time. Everyone is home now, and everyone is good.”\n\nThe Rivers clan now has seven girls — Anna, 4, Clare, 8, Rebecca, 10, Sarah,14, Grace, 17, Caroline, 18, and Halle, 21 — and three boys — Andrew, Peter, 13, and Gunner, 15.\n\nMeanwhile, Philip’s eldest son, Gunner, appears to be following in his footsteps as he is the quarterback on St. Michael Catholic’s freshman football team in Fairhope, Ala., where he coaches.\n\n“There is a chance for a Rivers to be throwing it around or catching it or tackling or doing something for the Cardinals for a long time,” he added.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers alum previously gushed over his growing family when he announced Tiffany’s pregnancy in July 2023.\n\n“We’ve had one pretty much every two years and now this is the longest gap,” Rivers told AL.com. “We are all fired up. Everyone was pulling for a boy.\n\n“Even our girls wanted a boy.”\n\nRivers said that both his parents come from families of nine and he wanted to carry out their legacy.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“We thought we would be the third generation of nine, but we decided to go double-digits — or I should say we didn’t decide it. God decided,” he continued.\n\nAfter 17 years in the NFL, Philip retired in 2021.\n\nHe finished out his glory days with the Indianapolis Colts after spending 16 years with the Chargers.\n\nRivers’ seven girls and two boys, with one of their sons getting ready to be the starting quarterback at St. Michael Catholic, where Rivers coaches."
