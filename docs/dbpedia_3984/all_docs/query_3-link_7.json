        "text": "San Diegans have lost a famous neighbor.\n\nPhilip Rivers has moved “permanently” from San Diego to Florida to be closer to his family, the free-agent quarterback texted to ESPN on Sunday morning.\n\n“What this means football-wise is to be determined but it was time for us to move back closer to home,” Rivers said in the text, reported Adam Schefter and Chris Mortensen.\n\nWhile Rivers had said many times he planned to move to or near the Alabama town where he and wife Tiffany grew up after he retired from the NFL, the move now will uproot his nine children, the oldest of which is beginning college this year.\n\nSeemingly, the move reduces the chances that Rivers, 38, will return to the Chargers if he decides to resume his NFL career in 2020.\n\nThe Chargers are the only NFL team to employ Rivers, an eight-time Pro Bowler, since former General Manager A.J. Smith obtained him in a draft-day trade in 2004.\n\nHe hasn’t missed a start since taking over for Drew Brees, the Hall of Fame-bound, John Butler-draftee who left to sign with the New Orleans Saints in March 2006. Rivers led the Bolts to AFC West titles between 2006-09.\n\nTo maintain his family’s San Diego lifestyle and continuity, Rivers commuted from his north San Diego home to Orange County the past three years after the Chargers relocated from Mission Valley to Costa Mesa. Though Rivers took the team to a 12-4 record in 2018, the franchise’s AFC West title drought stretched to a 10th year this past season, as Team Spanos went 5-11 and 0-6 in the division.\n\nFlorida is where Rivers previously spent parts of his offseason, and where he threw passes to Chargers tight end Hunter Henry last offseason.\n\nA home in the Florida panhandle has afforded the Rivers family a getaway spot that’s closer to the couple’s parents in Alabama.\n\n“They wanted a place where they could gather with both their families,” designer Meredith McBrearty, described as a childhood friend Tiffany lived with during high school, told Southern Home magazine in June 2017. “They first called on me to do their San Diego house when they moved there, and then they asked me to create a beach house to host gatherings with their Alabama family.”\n\nPutting year-round roots down in Florida also takes Rivers from a state with a high income tax to one with no income tax.\n\nWhen Rivers last commented publicly on his football future, at season’s end a few weeks ago, he said wanted to play in 2020 and that he wanted again to lead the Chargers, his only NFL employer.\n\nBut he also said he’d have a better sense of his desires, once the 2019 season receded a few weeks. There was a lot to consider, he said.\n\nIf Rivers decides he wants to extend his NFL career, it’s not clear, at least today, that any team and he are a super fit.\n\nThe Chargers and Rivers would have the advantage of starting any negotiation with a lot of common ground, and residency in Florida wouldn’t preclude Rivers from setting up lodging near the Chargers facility.\n\nRivers has spent several years with many of the team’s players who ended the season on the roster. They included offensive players such as receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, running back Austin Ekeler and standout center Mike Pouncey, all under team control for next season. But it was a bumpy ride in 2019, the team finishing in last place.\n\nOther than the Chargers, the Indianapolis Colts and Tampa Bay Bucs would seem the best of the candidates for Rivers, who’ll turn 39 in the final month of the 2020 season. The Colts employ two former Chargers coaches known to admire Rivers, in head coach Frank Reich and offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni, and have two very good interior blockers. The Bucs feature two stellar, aggressive pass-catchers, Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, who are fits for Rivers’ turn-it-loose style.\n\nThe Colts’ dome and Tampa’s warmth also would favor Rivers, whose arm strength is ordinary.\n\nBut it’s not clear that the Colts and Bucs will move on from their 2019 quarterbacks, Jacoby Brissett and Jameis Winston.\n\nAs for the Chargers, veteran hybrid quarterback Tyrod Taylor is a candidate to start in 2020. Taylor played for Chargers coach Anthony Lynn with the Bills and reunited with Lynn last March under a two-year contract.\n\nOddly, Lynn showed almost no trust in Taylor last year, perhaps out of respect to Rivers and his long career with the club.\n\nIn the few instances that Taylor entered the game other than in mop-up time, Rivers also remained on the field, splitting out to receiver, not exactly an alarming matchup for defenses.\n\nThe season’s two most crucial plays involving Taylor were clunky read-option runs that failed, in part due to poor blocking against dialed-in defenses.\n\nTaylor was an effective starter for the Bills, recording a 92.5 passer rating, an excellent touchdown-interception ratio of 51-16 and an average of 5.1 yards per carry. The Bills went 22-20 in his starts between 2015-17.\n\nHe appeared uncomfortable as the Browns starter after joining Cleveland in a trade. In three starts, the last of which dealt him a concussion, Taylor compiled a 61.5 passer rating. But he earned praised as a mentor to top draftee Baker Mayfield. Browns coach Hue Jackson, later dismissed, famously asked Mayfield if he noticed that Taylor started his workdays in the early morning and put in long hours.\n\nWith the Chargers last year, Taylor was a mentor to rookie Easton Stick, a fifth-round draftee who also has good mobility. If the Chargers, who hold the No. 6 draft pick, were to draft a potential franchise quarterback, Taylor could reprise his mentor role.\n\nRivers, if he plays next season, will look to throw fewer crucial interceptions than last year. And he’ll want to sharply improve his intra-divisional results after assembling a 71.1 passer rating with seven touchdown passes and 12 interceptions against AFC West rivals, the teams that know him best."
