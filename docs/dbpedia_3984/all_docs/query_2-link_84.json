        "text": "San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers was a legit MVP candidate last season, but he never won the honors. At 34 years old, it’s very easy to simply question if his time has passed.\n\nAROUND COVER32\n\n2016 Preview: Predictions for the NFC South division\n\n2016 Preview: This year’s top five DPOY candidates\n\nKick Returns: Devin Hester hates new touchback rule\n\nPEDs: League to talk with three stars in June\n\nChargers News: Military service deferred to play in NFL\n\nChargers News: Top 5 Chargers of All Time\n\nPhilip Rivers has been like a bottle of fine wine, getting better with age. He continues to put up MVP numbers season after season and last year, he did it without starters. Most of the team got hurt but Rivers continued to charge forward. Rivers has yet to win the coveted MVP award.\n\nHowever, that can all change fast. With premiere names on the upcoming 2016 roster like, Allen, Benjamin and Gates, Rivers can sure make a run for the MVP award and at the same time lead the Chargers to the AFC title and eventually to the promise land.\n\nThe running game should provide a much better cover for Rivers and give him time to throw the rock. Philip is on pace(at least on paper)to have one of his best seasons yet. Gates won’t be his only target.\n\nHunter Henry could be a legitimate candidate to be the Offensive Rookie of the Year(OROY), while Benjamin gives Rivers another lethal weapon. He is automatically an upgrade over the last couple of seasons. We saw various receivers come and go for the Chargers. Rivers has several key receivers and tight ends and finally has his arsenal in place.\n\nHis offensive line should get much better under Matt Slauson as well. In order for Rivers to win the award he will not only have to put up great numbers like he did last season, but he will have to put the Chargers high up on the AFC ladder and into the playoffs.\n\nThe season hasn’t started yet but Rivers gets a lot of credit not only for what he has shown he is capable of but also with the targets he will be doing it with."
