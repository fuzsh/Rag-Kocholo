        "text": "At the moment, Tiffany and Phillip have nine children – seven girls and two boys. Isn’t that phenomenal? The couple welcomed their first child, a daughter named Hall , on July 6, 2002. Another daughter, Caroline , followed in 2005. The third child and daughter, Grace , arrived a year later. Then in 2008 they had their first son and fourth child, Gunner .\n\nIn 2010 the fourth daughter and fifth child arrived. Second son and sixth child, Peter Bald followed the next year 2011. Rebecca , sixth daughter and seventh child arrived two years later – 2013. Clare followed in 2015. Then baby number nine and seventh daughter, Anna hit the world on March 27, 2019.\n\nBeing married and becoming a mother apparently didn’t give Tiffany a chance to pursue a career at a young age. She is primarily focused on her wifely and motherly responsibilities at her family home in San Diego, California.\n\nFacts about Philip River’s wife\n\n1. She is a year younger than Phillip\n\nWhile Phillip Rivers was born in 1981, Tiffany was born in 1982. At the time of their marriage, they were 19 and 18 years old respectively.\n\n2. Tiffany became Catholic the day before her wedding\n\nUnlike Phillip, who was born and raised Catholic, Tiffany embraced the faith on the eve of her wedding. The couple have since embraced the religion, raised their children in the faith, and have never missed a crowd. Phillip himself has even made it his duty to receive communion before each of his matches.\n\n3 . Co-founder of Rivers of Hope\n\nIn 2010, Tiffany and Phillip founded Rivers of Hope, a charity focused on finding permanent housing for orphans aged 12 and older. They also provide financial support to other charities that support child adoption. However, the couple closed the foundation in 2013 after deciding to help the children “behind the scenes.”\n\n4. Hermosa recently launched swimwear\n\nOn March 1, 2019, Tiffany Rivers, in collaboration with her longtime friend Marisa De Lecce, launched Hermosa, a brand of stylish yet conservative swimwear. In a world where skin is showing in the name of swimwear, Tiff and her friend Mimi saw the need to provide the market with swimwear that showed less skin. The brand name “Hermosa” means “beautiful” in Spanish.\n\n5. She married Phillip when he had nothing\n\nAt the time Tiffany married Phillips, the latter had nothing – not a dime to his name. In fact, it was Phillip’s mother who told Tiffany that her son would marry her, having previously shown Phillip to his mother.\n\n6. Her family is everything to her husband – it’s Phillip River’s #1\n\nAlthough Phillip is an in-demand footballer, Rivers would not have anything that would come at the expense of his family. Despite his burning passion for football, his family remains his top priority.\n\nPhillip was present at the births of all his children except one. And all the kids confirm that he always wants to be with them when he’s not on the pitch. Tiffany’s husband is the most selfless person she has ever known! While Tiff adores her husband very much, Phil himself believes that without his wife he would never have gotten to where he is today!\n\n7. And finally… Why the Nine Children?\n\nI wonder why are nine children from an 18 year marriage? Here’s the answer: Tiff and Phil are devout Catholics and because of their Catholic faith they say no to birth control. Furthermore, their early marriage was also inspired by their faith as they had to maintain their chastity until they became husband and wife."
