        "text": "With Philadelphia assigned as one of ten regional centers for federal agencies, federal resources within the District are abundant. As one of the Nation's largest, the District Court has 37 sitting judges, 5 bankruptcy court judges and 11 magistrate judges. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, with 19 judges, is also located within the federal courthouse in the city. In addition to its historical sites, Philadelphia is home to major Department of Defense (DOD) buying commands, a bulk mail center, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regional return center, and many other facilities.\n\nIn contrast to the urban character of its largest city, the District's eight other counties, Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery and Northampton, reflect a mixture of settings and cultures. With the completion of a new interstate highway and the redevelopment of its regional airport, the Lehigh Valley cities of Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton are now in a position to reap the benefits of the suburban expansion that has been occurring across the country. Chester, Montgomery and Bucks counties have recognized significant growth in both residential and business development based in large part to the success of the technology and retail industries. Lancaster County, with its farms and rolling hills, remains home to the Pennsylvania Dutch, farmers, tradesmen and other artisans who supply all of the District's communities with fresh produce, new home construction, crafts and many other products.\n\nPhiladelphia, both a city and county, is the country's sixth largest metropolis, housing over 1.6 million people, and the birthplace of our Nation. The city is rich in historical significance including Independence National Historic Park, the home and resting place of Benjamin Franklin, and many other sites. Situated along the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, Philadelphia is a thriving seaport that is also noted for its world renowned educational system of colleges and universities, including four medical schools. Business is also well established in the fields of health care, government, insurance, and international travel and trade. Additionally, the city's economy is enhanced by its strategic location along the Northeast Corridor between New York and Washington and is serviced by multiple interstate highways, rail and an ever-expanding international airport."
