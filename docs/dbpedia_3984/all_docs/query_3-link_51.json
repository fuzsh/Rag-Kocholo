        "text": "COSTA MESA, Calif. -- After much deliberation, Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers chose to make a minor sacrifice for the betterment of his family.\n\nFirst reported by the San Diego Union-Tribune, Rivers confirmed in this conversation with Darren Smith of the The Mighty 1090 AM Radio that he, wife, Tiffany, and the couple’s eight children will remain in their home in Rancho Santa Fe just north of San Diego, and that he will commute to work once training camp ends and the regular season begins for the Chargers.\n\nRivers has played in the NFL for 13 seasons, all with the Chargers in San Diego. All but one of his eight children were born in San Diego.\n\nRivers said he’ll hire a driver and create a mobile quarterback room with televisions for film study during the commute.\n\n“We just thought it was best for me and my family to go this route -- that it was at least worth a try this first season, being that it wasn’t too far,” Rivers said. “There’s two things I didn’t want to compromise: I didn’t want to compromise my preparation/being a teammate. I love being a teammate, so I didn’t want to compromise that because I’m going back and forth. And I wasn’t going to compromise my time spent away from my family.\n\n“Really, ultimately, at the end of the day I just felt like not only time with my family, but what gave them when I am working daily put them in the best environment and kept things as normal as possible. So that’s what we came to, and we’ll find out if we’re right or not.”\n\nMy take: Rivers initially had reservations about the Chargers relocating to L.A. but has gradually embraced the idea of playing in a new city. But it’s understandable that he’d like to keep his home life as comfortable as possible with the changes at his work place.\n\n• Louis Casiano Jr. of the Orange County Register previews the Chargers’ opening training camp by interviewing A.G. and John Spanos about the team’s new setup at Jack Hammett Sports Complex. The Orange County Register also includes a breakdown of the new facility.\n\nMy take: The Chargers will have more space available at the team’s new digs for training camp, including a fan-experience area.\n\n• John Kosko of Pro Football Focus ranks the Chargers running back group No. 11 in the NFL.\n\nMy take: That’s about right, although the Chargers certainly could move into the top 10 with another strong performance from Melvin Gordon this season.\n\n• Ricky Henne of Chargers.com talks with head coach Anthony Lynn about new addition Cardale Jones."
