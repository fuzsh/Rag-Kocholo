        "text": "Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers is enjoying his offseason after a great 2018 campaign, along with his wife Tiffany, kids and now their ninth child, which was born last week, Anna Rivers, the team announced on Tuesday.\n\nIt is quite the love story for Philip and Tiffany. The two began dating way back in middle school and eventually got married after Rivers’ freshman year at North Carolina State.\n\nThe ages of their current children range from 16 to 3: Halle (16), Caroline (13), Grace (12), Gunner (10), Sarah (8), Peter (7), Rebecca (5) and Clare (3).\n\nWhen the Chargers moved from San Diego to Los Angeles, Philip and Tiffany elected to keep the family in San Diego rather than move to a new city. Rivers makes the commute work thanks to a luxurious $200,000 SUV and a driver.\n\nAfter the announcement his newborn, Twitter didn’t hold back with their humor, which has been the case ever since he has continuously been adding more kids to his family."
