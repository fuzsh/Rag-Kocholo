        "text": "Philip Michael Rivers (born December 8, 1981) is an American football quarterback for the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at North Carolina State University, and was drafted in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft with the fourth overall pick by the New York Giants, who traded him to the Chargers for their first overall pick, quarterback Eli Manning. Rivers' career passer rating of 95.7 is fourth-best all-time among NFL quarterbacks with at least 1,500 passing attempts. Rivers is ranked 3rd all-time in consecutive starts by a quarterback in NFL history. After starting Chargers' quarterback Drew Brees went to the New Orleans Saints following the 2005 season, Rivers came off the bench to lead the Chargers to a 14-2 record in his first season as a starter. In 2007, he helped the Chargers win their first playoff game since 1994 after beating the Tennessee Titans in the wildcard round of the 2007 playoffs and eventually leading them to the AFC Championship Game."
