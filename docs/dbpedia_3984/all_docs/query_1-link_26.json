        "text": "A Man of Greatness\n\nPhilip Rivers is undoubtedly a man with extreme talent. An NFL quarterback who is underestimated and underrated. Neither Philip Rivers nor the Chargers have received a Super Bowl win; should that take away from the countless awards and records he has broken? Does a Super Bowl make or break a player’s true status? {THESIS}\n\nThe History of Philip Rivers\n\nPhilip Rivers was born on December 8, 1981 in Decatur, Alabama. A small town on the outskirts of Birmingham, Alabama. Philip’s parents, Steve and Joan Philips, had two more children following Philip when he was in his teens. His brother and sister, Stephen and Anna. Philip was into sports since the age of two; He loved football and basketball. His competitive edge came from his mother, while the athletic ability that Philip shows on the field was instilled in him by his father. Philip was so confidant in his athletic ability that at the age of eleven he turned in a Sports Illustrated cover page with his face plastered on it for a school project. Not only did Philip believe in his abilities but so did his parents. They were so confident that Philip would receive a full ride scholarship thru college that they chose not to put money aside. Philip skipped throwing a youth-sized football around and jumped right to a college-sized football. He had already established his unique throwing action that would continue to be talked about for years to come.(Kennedy)\n\nPhilip followed in his father’s footsteps, who was once a linebacker for Mississippi State in the 1970’s and moved on to be the head coach for Athen’s High School, where Philip attended. Philip would play his first official game in 1996 and not see a bench until he was a rookie in the NFL. It was then that his...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n... plays making it a 69-yard touchdown drive. Unfortunately, following that touchdown it all fell apart. He threw his first interception, was sacked three times and ended up fumbling the ball in his own end-zone.\n\nSports Illustrated\n\nWork Cited\n\nTrotter, Jim. “QB PHILIP Rivers.” Sports Illustrated (October 8, 2011): 58-59.\n\nAcademic Search Complete.
