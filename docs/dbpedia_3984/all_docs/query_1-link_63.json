        "text": "NFL.com has posted a video of Philip Rivers with him mic'd up for sound. Unfortunately, since their website doesn't allow you to embed videos elsewhere you'll have to click on this link their page.\n\nIt's got some incredible footage of him introducing himself to other players, doing some light running, throwing footballs and chatting (surprise! surprise!) with different players. He talks with Kubiak about how Norv is a big numbers guy when it comes to play names. Ben Roethlisberger is interested in how many kids Phil has. Rivers tells Big Ben and Andy Dalton that this year they brought all six kids to Hawaii. He also tells Dalton what his least favorite throw in football is. He also seems very excited about this \"Pat n' Go\" drill. Later, he has tell to Mike Wallace to take it down a notch since his speed takes him farther than Rivers can throw. He also gives Brandon Marshall the skinny that Vincent Jackson only practices on full speed (in case you missed him, that's VJ running the reverse and whizzing by the camera). Antonio Gates looks sweaty as practice concludes. Ryan Mathews makes a few appearances as well.\n\nThis is Philip Rivers' 4th time being selected for the Pro Bowl and his 3rd consecutive election. His selection seemed a bit dubious at first given some of his struggles this season. However, given the crop of AFC QBs, especially Tom Brady ineligible due to his Super Bowl preparation, Rivers seems as good of a selection as any."
