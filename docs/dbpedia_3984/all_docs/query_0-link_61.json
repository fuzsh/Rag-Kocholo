Tiffany is awesome,\" Rivers said. \"It doesn't matter if it's the first child or the 10th child. It's an awesome miracle every time. Everyone is home now, and everyone is good.\"\n\nRivers and TIffany now have three sons to go along with seven daughters. Aside from Andrew the other nine children range in age between 5 and 21.\n\nThe eight-time Pro Bowler spent the first 16 years of his career with the Chargers before heading to Indianapolis for one last swan song. He retired at the conclusion of the 2020 campaign, stating that he believed it was the right time.\n\nRivers retired with 63,440 passing yards—good for the sixth-most in NFL history."
