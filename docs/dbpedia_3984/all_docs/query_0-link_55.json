        "text": "The Alabama Crimson Tide continue to make coaching hires as new head coach Kalen DeBoer finalizes his staff.\n\nAlabama hired Buffalo head coach Maurice Linguist as a defensive backs coach, but appear to not be done yet making secondary hires.\n\nThe Crimson Tide are expected to hire Wisconsin Co-Defensive Coordinator and safeties coach Colin Hitschler as an assistant on Coach DeBoer's new staff.\n\nCoach Hitschler coached at Cincinnati, Arkansas State, and South Alabama as well. The Crimson Tide will look to have Coach Hitschler help to rebuild and develop a secondary with just one returning starter from last season: Malachi Moore.\n\nThe Crimson Tide lost Jaylen Key to the NFL draft and Caleb Downs to the transfer portal, where he is currently uncommitted. Alabama hopes that a young defense will be able to take the necessary strides to compete at a high level this upcoming season.\n\nThe Crimson Tide coaching staff is coming together. This is what it looks like currently:\n\nHC: Kalen DeBoer\n\nOC: Ryan Grubb\n\nRB: Rob Gillespie\n\nWR: JaMarcus Shephard\n\nOL: Scott Huff\n\nTE: Nick Sheridan\n\nDC: Kane Wommack\n\nDL: Freddie Roach\n\nDB: Maurice Linguist\n\nDB: Colin Hitschler\n\nGeneral Manager: Courtney Morgan"
