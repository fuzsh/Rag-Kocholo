        "text": "Asked a few years ago if he had any interest in the broadcast booth when his playing days are done, Philip Rivers shot the idea down quickly. Wasn’t his thing, he said. Wasn’t even something that was on his radar.\n\nMaybe that’s surprising, maybe not, but when you stop and think about it, Rivers in the booth makes so much sense: He’s sharp, well-spoken, witty — not to mention as cerebral on the field as Manning or Brady or Brees. It’s not hard to imagine him making the same type of transition that Tony Romo did. He could be that good behind a mic.\n\nBut no thanks, Rivers said. He wasn’t even curious.\n\nWhy not?\n\n“Because you can’t win games in the booth,” he said.\n\nYou can in Fairhope, Ala., where Rivers will take over his son’s high school team at St. Michael Catholic whenever his NFL career comes to a close. What became official this past spring has been on his mind for a decade and a half, probably even longer.\n\nKevin Acee, a veteran sportswriter at The San Diego Union-Tribune, remembers visiting Rivers in his hometown of Decatur, Ala., in 2007 after his first season as the Chargers’ starting quarterback. Rivers told Acee then what the plan was.\n\nHe was going to play as long as he could, as long as he still felt that pull, as long as he could contribute. Then he was going to coach.\n\n“And I never had a doubt in my mind that’s exactly what he would do, no matter what offers came his way,” Acee said.\n\nIt hit Rivers early this week, what Sunday could mean if his team doesn’t win and a few other teams don’t lose. Sunday will be Rivers’ 251st consecutive start in the NFL, including the playoffs.\n\nIt also could be his last.\n\n“Shoot, yeah, it has crossed my mind,” he admitted. “Certainly, don’t intend that it will be, don’t hope that it is, but certainly, I think you have to acknowledge that it is a possibility.”\n\nIf their season ends Sunday — if the Colts become just the third team in history to go 11-5 and miss the playoffs — it will further cloud what already figures to be a murky offseason for their 39-year-old quarterback. In so many ways, Rivers has delivered on everything the Colts asked of him, lifting a stagnant offense from the mire it was slogging through at the end of last season.\n\nBut there’s also this: The missive was clear at the outset of the season. The Colts weren’t paying their starting quarterback $25 million to miss the playoffs.\n\nSurely, after 17 years, Rivers won’t want to go out like that, right?\n\n“Without speaking out of turn, it didn’t make a huge difference to me if it was a two-year deal or a one-year thing,” Rivers said Thursday night, driving home from the team facility. “I think that was just what was best for both sides. If I came in here and stunk it up, I was gonna be done anyway. It’d be like, ‘Man, this is brutal, let me just go coach.’ But if it went well, and we got in the playoffs and made a run, let’s do it again.\n\n“I still feel that way. I don’t want to speak in absolutes because there is still dust to be settled, whenever this season ends, and I’ll talk about it with my family, and the Colts have their side, but I still feel the same way. I hope there is a Year 2 (here). I think I’m really gonna want to play again.”\n\nGunner Rivers is 13 and a sixth-grader. That means he’s got just over two years until he’s a high school freshman at St. Michael Catholic.\n\n“If he was an eighth-grader,” his Dad said, “we would have a little bit different decision on our hands.”\n\nThat window offers Rivers at least another season, and another shot, if he wants it. Rivers is playing on a bum toe, wrapping up his 15th season as a starting quarterback in the NFL. He’ll again be a free agent come March.\n\nWill the Colts want him back?\n\nWill he want another season?\n\nDon’t hang on, he’s been telling himself in recent years. Don’t be that player who stays too long.\n\nRivers never wanted to be the player who couldn’t let go, whose ego blinded him from the hard-to-swallow reality that creeps up on every player his age: that he couldn’t do it anymore. The game has meant everything to him since he was a young kid, bouncing around on the field while his dad Steve coached the local high school team, scrapping his way into the pile so he could spot the football and measure for a first down.\n\nDeep down, he knows it’ll be unspeakably hard to give it up.\n\nSteve was in on the conversation last winter, same with his wife Tiffany. Were 16 seasons enough? Should he just walk away?\n\n“Had they all been like, ‘Philip, you need to shut it down,’ if they all felt that way, I probably wouldn’t be sitting here,” Rivers said this week.\n\nBut they didn’t think he was done, and they were right.\n\nSo much about Rivers’ first season in Indianapolis has rejuvenated him. Coming in, he relished the chance to earn the respect of a new collection of teammates. He jumped on the offensive linemen’s text thread in the spring and would send the group voice messages every week, shouting into his phone about how excited he was to get to play with them.\n\nHe formed a friendship with T.Y. Hilton. He bonded with Jacoby Brissett. He reunited with head coach Frank Reich and offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni, who happens to be all of five months older than him. “I think we both grew up watching ‘Saved By the Bell’,” Sirianni says with a laugh. Rivers now hands the football off to one running back, Jonathan Taylor, who on draft day referred to him as “Mr. Rivers,” and another, Nyheim Hines, who can remember being six years old and cheering for Rivers when he was the QB at N.C. State.\n\nHe’s formed new routines, none more important than Chick-fil-A Tuesdays: It’s the family’s first stop after he picks up the kids from school on his way home from the Colts’ practice facility. The whole group — all 11 of them — were amped a few weeks back, on the eve of Indy’s first snowfall. Fifteen years in sunny San Diego meant the family had never woken up to snow.\n\n“You’ve never heard children talk about the weather and when the snow was going to start (more than us),” Rivers said. “They were fired up.”\n\nThe plan all along wasn’t one season in Indianapolis, but more.\n\n“Certainly, you hoped it was going to be longer than one year,” Rivers said this spring.\n\nReich confirmed as much, then did so again recently, his conviction strengthened by Rivers’ body of work in 2020.\n\n“If he wants it, he’s got multiple years of good football left in him,” Reich said.\n\nDoes Rivers think so? Is he hanging on?\n\n“From a football standpoint, having some success, as a team and individually, playing well enough to punch it in and score some points and win some games, it has been fulfilling,” he said. “I mean, we’ve won 10 games. If we win Sunday we’re an 11-win team. We’re a good football team, dang it.\n\n“Whatever happens, there’s still the desire and the hope that we’ll be back and make another run. But I hope there’s a lot more ball to play this year.”\n\nPrivately, Rivers knew what had been said about him after his final year with the Chargers, knew plenty of pundits had written him off as an aging gunslinger whose play was too reckless to justify.\n\nHe was honest about it last summer: The criticism left him steaming.\n\n“I knew I still had something left,” he said.\n\nSo did his teammates. Not long after Rivers signed with the Colts, his phone buzzed. It was an old rival and a new ally.\n\n“I believe in you, and I believe you got plenty left in the tank,” Justin Houston texted. “Now let’s go win.”\n\nFor the most part, the Colts have. They’re 10-5. A win Sunday over lowly Jacksonville (1-14), which stunned Indy, 27-20, in Week 1, and the Colts — no matter what happens with their wacky playoff scenario — will have their first 11-win season in six years.\n\nAsk those around Rivers every day if they believe he should be back, and the responses are resounding.\n\n“Ain’t no question,” linebacker Darius Leonard said. “He’s been balling. I don’t see any slow up (in his ability), besides him not leaving the pocket. But he’s never been fast (anyway).”\n\nShould he return to the Colts, free-agent-to-be T.Y. Hilton wants Rivers to again be the one throwing him passes.\n\n“Absolutely,” Hilton said, asked if Rivers should get another shot with the Colts. “It would be dumb for him not to be.”\n\nThere are moments in practice each week, in between the playful barbs tossed between Rivers and Leonard — “He hits you where it hurts, that’s all I’m gonna say” Leonard said of Rivers’ trash talk, laughing — where defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus will pull Rivers aside and ask him about certain disguises, wanting to know what they look like from a veteran quarterback’s perspective. In Indianapolis, Rivers has become more than a resource. He’s become another coach.\n\nRivers chats with teammates like Leonard, Kenny Moore and Xavier Rhodes regularly on the practice field, letting them know what tells they’re showing pre-snap, and what those tells give away.\n\nReich likens his QB’s football mind to that of Peyton Manning — whom Reich coached in Indianapolis for three seasons — and even Dan Marino, whom he played against for years in the AFC East. A few weeks back, while the Colts’ offensive coaches were poring through film of a recent game, Reich watched Rivers check out of a play and then had to ask himself this question: How did he know to do that?\n\n“We’re sitting here as coaches watching the tape 50 times,” Reich said, “and he sees something or feels something on the field that nobody felt except for him.”\n\nWhat’s stood out to Reich about his quarterback late this season: how little Rivers has had to alter his game despite the nagging turf toe he’s has had to play through since mid-November. It’s not like Rivers could run before; now he’s even more hindered.\n\nThus, so much of his game rests between the ears. After the Steelers loss Sunday, Reich reviewed every audible Rivers made at the line of scrimmage. Eighty percent of them were correct.\n\n“Philip has the gift like a Dan Marino did, like a Peyton Manning did,” Reich said. “That, ‘Hey, I can’t get out of the pocket, but I can beat you with my mind. I’m going to get the ball out quick. I can accelerate through my progressions faster than anybody else.’ ”\n\nIf it was a gamble to bring Rivers in, a then-38-year-old who’d thrown 20 interceptions last season and mulled retirement, it was Reich’s gamble most of all. General manager Chris Ballard signed off, owner Jim Irsay signed off, but it was Reich who made it known Rivers was his top choice.\n\nAnd it didn’t always look like the shrewdest decision, not after Rivers threw more picks (five) than touchdowns (four) over his first five starts, and cost the Colts dearly with two second-half interceptions in a messy loss to the Browns in Week 5.\n\nReich said then Rivers was the least of his worries, and the coach took flak for the comment. But it was obvious to anyone watching: Rivers wasn’t playing like a $25 million investment.\n\nHe has since.\n\nThe thought has crossed Reich’s mind in recent weeks, as Rivers — bum toe and all — has led the Colts in their playoff push.\n\n“I’m human,” Reich admitted, asked if he’s felt any validation for the decision to sign Rivers back in the spring.\n\n“Yeah, it’s putting your neck on the line for somebody,” Reich said. “But OK. This is the kind of guy you want to put your neck on the line for.”\n\n(Top photo of Rivers: Chris Unger / Getty Images)"
