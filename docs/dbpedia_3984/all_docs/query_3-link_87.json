        "text": "COSTA MESA — Emmitt Smith punched in a game-winning touchdown. Mike Sherman coached against Mike Tice. Billy Volek threw for 334 yards.\n\nThese were all events that transpired on the second weekend of November 2004 — the last time the NFL regular season went without either Eli Manning or Philip Rivers as a starting quarterback. Since being traded for each other more than 13 years ago, they have put together a couple of impressive streaks: Manning has started 203 consecutive games for the Giants, not counting playoff appearances; Rivers, who sat behind Drew Brees for two seasons, has started 180 for the Chargers.\n\nBarring catastrophe, they will stretch their respective records Sunday at MetLife Stadium, taking turns on the field in their third meeting as professionals.\n\n“I’m looking forward to it,” Rivers said. “You’re not playing the other quarterback, but this could be the last time we’re both out there playing each other.”\n\nIn terms of quarterback durability and longevity, Brett Favre — who started a 297 consecutive games for the Packers, Jets and Vikings — stands in his own stratosphere. But step down from those lofty heights, and few can compare to Manning and Rivers.\n\nOnly one other quarterback — Manning’s older brother, Peyton — stands above them, and Eli could pass him next month. No active quarterbacks are within 50 starts of tying Rivers’ current mark.\n\n“Everyone wants to say it’s because I’m tougher than guys, and I don’t think that’s true,” Rivers said. “There’s an element of that, though. I think just growing up, that’s just the way it was. My dad used to always say, ‘Don’t lay out there on the field. If you have any kind of injury, you get off unless you can’t walk.'”\n\n“Any time you can play that many consecutive games and starts, you’re doing something right,” Chargers cornerback Casey Hayward said.\n\nThis is not necessarily an indictment on any player who has missed games. All ailments are not created equal, and given the league’s opaque injury reports, it can be difficult for outsiders to tease out the severity of each individual case.\n\n“I’m not sitting here encouraging guys to play and jeopardize their career,” Rivers said.\n\nBoth Rivers and Manning have seen their streaks threatened by close calls. The latter suffered a high ankle sprain in 2013, and would have missed games had the injury not occurred in the regular-season finale.\n\nIn January 2008, Rivers played on a torn ACL, and returned to the practice field four months later with a heavy brace. In December 2014, a bulging disc in his back had him considering surgery. The line between courageous and foolish is thin, and the 35-year-old has been fortunate to land on the right side of it.\n\n“I don’t do it for any reason, or any pat on the back,” Rivers said. “I feel very blessed to be able to have been able to be upright. But you hope that it may have some little impact — and not just from me, but from a lot of guys. ‘Shoot, if he’s going, then I’m going.’ …You really want to build a culture of that.\n\n“It’s not about me. It’s about all of us. ‘That’s a gritty, tough scrappy team that plays when they’re a little banged up and they just find a way to be out there with one another.’ Because I do think that can build morale, and it builds trust too.”\n\nInjury report\n\nLinebacker Jatavis Brown (ankle) was dressed for the warm-ups portion of Wednesday’s practice, but did not participate. He said Monday that he expects to play against the Giants this weekend.\n\nThe Chargers also held out right tackle Joe Barksdale (foot) and running back Branden Oliver (hamstring) were also held out.\n\nLeft guard Matt Slauson (tricep) and rookie receiver Mike Williams were both limited. Williams has yet to play this season due to a disk herniation in his lower back."
