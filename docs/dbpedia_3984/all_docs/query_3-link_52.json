        "text": "Leading up to the 50th Anniversary celebration of Carter-Finley Stadium this Saturday against Notre Dame, GoPack.com will recall some of the top games in the history of the Wolfpack's Stadium. Today, we look at five games from 1998 to 2003.\n\nPart 1: 1966-1975\n\nPart 2: 1975-1986\n\nPart 3: 1986-1997\n\nNC State 24, Florida State 7, Sept. 12, 1998\n\nAfter giving up a touchdown on the second play of the game, the Mike O'Cain-led Wolfpack intercepted first-year quarterback Chris Weinke six times en route to beating the No. 2 ranked Seminoles. It is the highest ranked opponent the Wolfpack has ever beaten at Carter-Finley, and the highest ranked team State had beaten since 1967 when it beat second-ranked Houston on the road.\n\nNC State 38, Syracuse 17, Oct. 1, 1998\n\nThe unranked Pack upsets the No. 11 Orangemen and future All-Pro quarterback Donovan McNabb for the second year in a row, in a nationally televised Thursday night contest.\n\nNC State 30, Georgia Tech 23 (OT), Sept. 21, 2000\n\nThe legend of quarterbackPhilip Rivers was born a few weeks earlier in a double-overtime win over Arkansas State, but he was introduced to a national television audience in this Thursday night ESPN thriller in Chuck Amato's first year as head coach. Rivers, the freshman quarterback, brought the Wolfpack back from a 13-0 halftime deficit with three touchdown passes to sophomore wide receiver Koren Robinson, including a 23-yard game-winner in overtime.\n\nNC State 17, Florida State 7, Nov. 23, 2002\n\nAfter losing three consecutive games, the Wolfpack seemed to be reeling after its school-record 9-0 start to the season. But the defense ruled the day against the Seminoles, earning the Wolfpack a bid to the Gator Bowl, where it beat Notre Dame to cap off a school-record 11-win season.\n\nNC State 51, Virginia 37, Nov. 1, 2003\n\nIn a game that featured two of the ACC's most prolific passers, NC State's Philip Rivers and Virginia's Matt Schaub (the reigning ACC Offensive Player of the Year), the guy who made the difference was a semi-healthy T.A. McLendon. With 23 seconds remaining in a tie game, the tailback who had two arthroscopic knee surgeries in the previous 16 days broke free for a 38-yard touchdown that sent the sell-out crowd into a frenzy. Safety Victor Stephens provided the final points when he intercepted a pass in the final seconds and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown."
