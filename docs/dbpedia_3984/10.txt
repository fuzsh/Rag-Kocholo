Background

Philip Michael Rivers was born on December 8, 1981, in Alabama, the United States, to Steve, the head coach of the Decatur High football team, and his wife, Joan, a teacher. He has two siblings, Stephen and Anna Rivers. Rivers aspired to be a Minnesota Vikings player right from his childhood. He made his goal clear in fifth grade when for a school project, he was asked to make a poster about his dreams and aspirations.

His official start in football happened in the year 1994 when he was in the seventh grade. Since ninth grade, he has worn only the number 17 jersey to honor his father, who wore the same number during his student days in high school. Rivers was a member of the Athens High School football team after his father became the head coach there. Despite receiving offers from Auburn and Alabama, Rivers established himself as the best prep passer in the state. To have more playing time, he finally decided to join none. He was eventually recruited as a quarterback by North Carolina State. Rivers broke nearly every N.C. State and A.C.C. passing record during his collegiate career.

After his first two seasons in a backup role, he served as the Chargersâ€™ starting quarterback from 2006 to 2019. During this time, he was named to eight Pro Bowls while leading the team to four division titles and six post-season appearances. In 2007, he assisted the franchise in winning its first playoff game since 1994 and reaching the A.F.C. Championship Game. Although he was not successful in the post-season and never made a Super Bowl appearance, he is still considered one of the greatest quarterbacks to never have played in a Super Bowl. In 2001, he married Tiffany, his high school sweetheart.
